        "A: Actually, I was born Abraham Wertman, but never called Abraham, never, never and I tried\nto find out why, and I was never given a straight answer. It seems that some distant relative that\nthey honored, but my parents never called me Abraham, my ca -- I was called Mundek, M-u-n-d-\ne-k, which is a nickname mostly used by Polish Jews, you know, it\u2019s not a typical Polish\nnickname, and it was Mundek, M-u-n-d-e-k, and that was my name, I was known as Mundek.\nBut I have a document to show -- actually, I received a copy of my birth certificate in 1993 from\nthe Polish authorities in Warsaw, and they had actually -- were able to get a copy for me, so it\ndid --",

        "Q: -- during this period before the war.",
        "A: Before the war, yes. Well, I -- I had a very happy childhood. I was the -- my mother\u2019s only\nchild, and there were two other brothers, but they were half brothers whose mother died when\nshe was very young, of a brain tumor. But we were very, very close, so I was never -- til about\nnine years of age, I wasn\u2019t aware that they were not my real brothers, I mean I -- were on -- half -\n- half brothers. And my fi -- so I was the only one who was born actually in L\u2019vov. I was sort of\nthe city born child. The others were born in smaller t -- in small towns a -- where my father came\nfrom. My father was in the dairy business. We had a small dairy plant where he would\nmanufacture milk products like cheeses and heavy creams and butter and that sort of thing, and\nget up four in the morning to receive the milk from the farms, and then produce it and\nmanufacture it and also have a small retail store as well. Hard work and -- and we also had a\ncousin living with us and I have a photo of the place that I was born, I was able to obtain that,\ntoo.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s great.",
        "A: And so I had a relative -- very happy childhood, until about -- when I was about eight years\nold, my parents divorced.",
        "Q: Now, can we go back -- let\u2019s go back a little bit be -- before then. You -- your father\u2019s name is\nHenry.",

        "Q: How would you describe this personality and your mother\u2019s personality?",
        "A: Well, let\u2019s see. My father was a very hard working -- very, I would say authoritarian, sor --\nyou know, very disciplined, always concerned about -- about making a good living. A good\nprovider. My mother was 10 years younger and she was, I would say maybe a little more worldly\nthan my father. And perhaps the trouble began when she felt that perhaps there was more to life\nthan just working an -- all the time, and so difficulties develo -- [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you feel that as a child? Did you feel the difficulties?",
        "A: I began to -- to see some discord there, but I wasn\u2019t that close, I was very young at the time,\nyou know, and I guess I didn\u2019t pay that much attention, although I did feel there\u2019s some tension\nthere and I would overhear arguments, etcetera. Now my -- my mother\u2019s family -- and she had\nthree sisters and two brothers, lived in Danzig, which is Gdansk. Was a freest city of Danzig.\nAnd I remember she would take me -- she took me once when I -- before the divorce and also\nafter the divorce I stayed with her for about a year in Danzig cause she wanted to have me close\nby. And of course, then the war intervened, and things went really bad, you know.",
        "Q: Was it difficult for you when they divorced? Was that a --",
        "A: Was very difficult.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It was difficult from the point of view that -- that my father was middle class, fairly well-to-\ndo. My mother was left penniless because under Polish law there was no division of property,\nanything like that, and -- and I didn\u2019t -- he did not really give her any -- give her much support at\nall, if any. [indecipherable] part of the other presumed feelings about the divorce. So -- so I felt\nbadly about it and my mother decided to leave me with my father cause she felt that I could be\ncared for better in the -- you know, in the --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- with my father s -- and the rest of the family.",
        "Q: Did you then see her on a regular basis? [indecipherable]",
        "A: I saw her from pi -- yes, I saw her from time -- while she was still in -- in L\u2019vov, you know,\nuntil -- until close of the war, you know [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And did she remarry?",
        "A: She did not remarry.",
        "Q: She didn\u2019t.",
        "A: No, she did not, but she went back to her small town of Tarnogrod just after the -- 1939, war\nbroke out, you know.",
        "Q: So how -- what was her name, her first name?",
        "A: Her name was -- was Leah, or what would be Lisa --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- in [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And maiden name Truk, T-r-u-k.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And how old was your older stepbrother?",
        "A: Okay, I had two.",
        "Q: Or how much older than you. You had two --",
        "A: Seven years older, the middle one and then the other one 10 years older.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, and what was the -- the names of the two boys?",
        "A: Okay, the -- one was Mo -- Moshe -- or Moses, and the oldest one was Mordechai.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And we called them Mordtku and Moshku was the -- was the nicknames in polan -- in Polish.",
        "Q: And even though there was such a big difference in age, were you close?",
        "A: I was very, very close to mi -- the middle one, you know, the -- my next, we are very, very\nclose.",
        "Q: Moshe, uh-huh.",
        "A: In fact, he always claimed that a -- that my mother was like a true mother to him.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: She was -- because he was like five years old when his mother died. So we were very close\nand -- so it was a generally the pretty happy home environment, and I was -- we were spoiled\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: You were spoiled?",
        "A: I was spoiled.",
        "Q: Right. Was it a religious household?",
        "A: Not very, no. My father came from a very Orthodox -- as most Jews of his generation. Back\non [indecipherable] I don\u2019t think he ever had any public school education, his education was\nmainly in the Jewish, you know, s -- studies and so forth and -- and I have an early picture of him\nwith [indecipherable] beard and hat, which I\u20191ll show you later.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So he was more of, I would say, more worldly, although -- excuse me.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: We did have a -- a kosher household, per se, but my father shaved, you know, and he would\ngo to services occasionally. But he was beginning to question himself the -- the -- the -- the real\nOrthodoxy. He -- he tried to be more modern, living in the big city, you know, feeling free from\nthe constraints of his small town and close relatives that he lived with, so he felt more free to do\nthat.",
        "Q: Do you remember celebrating holidays?",
        "A: Oh yes, indeed, yeah, we did, and my father would -- on Friday night he would use -- you\nknow, make a Kiddush, he had a good voice, which he was proud of, so he used it to full\nadvantage, you know, to -- to sing a fancy, you know, Kiddush, and we had the usual chicken\nsoups and --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- Gefilte fish, and all that sort of thing, and he would ca -- take me occasionally to services,\nyou know, and -- but -- but generally I don\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t remember him actually even using\nthe daily prayer, the tefillin, you know, that you would use. I don\u2019t think he bothered with that, if\nI remember. So he was really going far --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- far away from the -- you know --",
        "Q: So what was the Jewish commu -- were -- were you living amongst mainly Jews, or was it\nfairly mixed?",
        "A: Yes, I lived on a street called Pilnikarska, which was several apartment buildings, almost\nclose to the center of the city, and we lived in a two story building. The upper story was a set of\nrooms, and the business itself was downstairs, you know with the little factory there. And there\nwas actually a stable with a couple of horses because the milk was being picked up at the railroad\nstation early in the morning, so we had a couple of workers there, we had also workers in the\nfactory. And most of the neighbors on our street were Jewish, was fair -- heavily Jewish because\nL\u2019vov actually had a population of 110,000. Actually, later on it swelled to oh -- to a 150,000\nmore. So all a total population of 340, so it\u2019s only one-third, you know, was the third largest\nJewish community i1-in Poland. So -- so that was a very heavy population there. And so the kids\nthat I would play with were mostly Jewish, wi -- you know, and -- and interestingly also that --\nwhich we'll -- we\u2019ll get back to later, when I begin to assume a different identity, is that actually\nmy native language was Polish. I like -- like families today, you know, where the -- first\ngeneration, you know, they speak Polish, and their parents speak Chine -- I mean peak -- speak\nEnglish and the parents speak Chinese, or whatever. Well, I spoke Polish, and of course, my\nparents spoke Yiddish. So I did understand everything they said, but I would always answer in\nPolish, which helped me a lot later on, because my Polish was very, very good, and very clean\nand very native Polish, unlike many others, who -- you know, from smaller towns, who did not\nhave that -- that advantage.",
        "Q: Now was this -- was this kind of thing fairly typical of the Jewish community, the kids were\ngoing to a public school, not a Jewish school?",
        "A: Public school, yes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That was typical maybe of the larger cities like L\u2019vov.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Not of the smaller communities so much. In the smaller communities they may -- may have\ngone to some public school, but they would also go to the cheder, you know, to study, you know,\nthe Talmud, and the --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- the [indecipherable] kind of thing.",
        "Q: And that -- and that you didn\u2019t do?",
        "A: No, no, not at all, no, no.",
        "Q: Were there Jewish youth groups in L\u2019vov, or not?",
        "A: There were some Jewish youth groups, I was very young, I didn\u2019t belong to any. My -- my\nbrother did, you know, he was -- he belonged to organization called Betar, which was -- which I\nwas kind of a -- unhappy about as I gre -- grow and understood because I was [indecipherable] to\nthe right of center, you know, Jewish organization. But he was -- he belonged to Betar and -- and\nwas fairly active in that. That wasn\u2019t -- you know, they had some uniforms of their own, all that.\nBut that was early -- in the early stages, later on became much more difficult, even before the\nwar, because the -- there was a lot of -- obviously some anti-Semitism that -- 1t was prevalent.\nAnd incidentally, L\u2019vov also had a very, very high Ukrainian population. It was one third Jewish,\none third Ukrainian, one th-third Polish. And L\u2019vov being western Ukraine was a cradle of -- of\nUkrainian nationalism and was a -- a lot of animosity between the Poles, and the Ukrainian and\nthe Jews. So the Jews basically, a lot of the Jews had a -- had a kind of a double -- double\nwhammy, they were obviously hated by the Ukrainians and of course, a lot of the Poles were\nalso, you know, anti -- anti-Semites. So -- so that was a big problem for the L\u2019vov Jewish\npopulation.",
        "Q: Did -- did you feel that as a child growing up?",
        "A: I felt 1t occasionally, in public school, when sometimes a teacher would make some funny\nJewish, you know, imitating Jewish words, or -- or one of the kids would speak maybe a little bit\nof a what I would call a Jewish Polish, you know, he would kind of make some f-fun of that and\nall that, but generally I did not feel a direct -- direct thing. I was never, you know, accosted or\nattacked or anything like that or -- or by -- by -- by other kids because we were pretty -- ina\npretty heavily Jewish population where I -- where I lived, you know.",
        "Q: Right. And do you recall your brothers talking about that at all? Ha-having any experience?",
        "A: Well -- well, there were restrictions in getting to a higher education. You know, there were\nquotas involved and all that, and so my brother went to -- to a -- a commerce high school, you\nknow, tried to get a degree there, and that didn\u2019t last very long, but my father -- my brother never\nmentioned any -- any overt or direct confrontations as such, because again, the Jewish\ncommunity, even though it wasn\u2019t a modern city like L\u2019vov, was still very, very closely knit, you\nknow, and there was very little interaction, except for the -- some the servants that would work,\nor some workers that would come to work, etcetera. So that was a -- a -- socially fairly isolated, I\nwould say.",
        "Q: Would you have called yourself upper middle class, do you think?",
        "A: I would say middle class, maybe not upper, but middle. Certainly comfortably middle, not\nupper.",
        "Q: How -- how did you find out that your parents were going to get divorced? Did your mother\ncome to you, your father come to you, or they just --",
        "A: Well, I knew -- I knew that there were difficulties, I knew there were problems, and I knew\nwhen my mother took me with her to Danzig, to Gdansk, I knew that I -- that things were wrong,\nthings were bad. My mother never told me directly that she was -- that she was going to be\ndivorced, so sh -- but I found out si -- very shortly after, especially when my father began to look\nfor another -- for a new companion, you know, to -- to try to remarry.",
        "Q: Did you resent that?",
        "A: Well, I did resent it to some degree, because he never told me that he would do that, and he\nmarried a woman who actually was a housekeeper, was 22 years younger than --",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: -- he, and that was very, very hard. Tha-that -- I resented that he never told -- told us that, he\ncame one day, left with her, and then he came back and says, \u201cWell, meet your new mother.\u201d\nYou know.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Y-Yeah. Which was very, very hard, that was -- that was very hard, and -- and also the fact\nthat he wouldn\u2019t support my mother, that -- that -- that --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- that both -- that hurt, because I was living in a fairly comfortable household, and yet my\nmother was in a very small apartment, she had to -- she tried to do some physical therapy to earn\na living. So that was very, very hard. Yeah, I -- I kind of never forgave him for that.",
        "Q: Right. And I guess your older brothers also felt similarly.",
        "A: Oh very much so, because he really was very close to my mother, you know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: My -- the oldest brother was -- I wasn\u2019t very close to him because he was a little bit, I would\nsay what you might call today, learning disadvantaged, or slow learning. Mordechai. And he\nbasically helped my father in th -- in -- in the -- in the shop and in the s -- business. So I wasn\u2019t\nthat close to him, even though he was a very gentle soul, I didn\u2019t have much to do with him, per\nse. But with Moshe who is now George, we were -- we were close, yeah, we quite often slept\ntogether, and you know, in the -- and of course our house -- our home was always full of visitors\nbecause you know, the big city. They would come from the small shtetl as it were, you know,\nand -- and visit the big city, you know, that was a big thing for them. So we had visitors because\nmy -- my father had four brothers and one sister, spread in many places in Poland. None\nsurvived, incidentally.",
        "Q: None?",
        "A: None, none, n-nor their families.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So your mother leaves when? You think it\u2019s 1937? 1936 --",
        "A: By 1936 --",
        "Q: -- or \u00b037?",
        "A: -- I -- there\u2019s [indecipherable] she -- that\u2019s when they were divorced and [indecipherable] and\nshe went --",
        "Q: So you\u2019re like seven years old? Six, seven?",
        "A: Yeah well, she was born in -- in 1905, so she was about 30 -- 31 - 32 years old.",
        "Q: And you keep in touch with her until \u201939, or \u00b041, at -- at whi --",
        "A: No, no, actually, actually -- actually, til about 1940 - \u201941 because under the -- as you may\nrecall, in 1939, when Hitler attacked Poland, the Germans were on the outskirts, close to L\u2019vov --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and we fully expected them to come, and then overnight, all of a sudden you see the\nRussians are here. So from 1939 to \u201941 --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- we were under the Soviets [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And was that a big change for your life?",
        "A: Oh, enormous change --",
        "Q: Enormous change.",
        "A: Enormous change.",
        "Q: And how -- can you say --",
        "A: Personally, through myself, it was -- well, the change was that first of all my father lost his\nbusiness because the Russian -- there was no private enterprise allowed, so that -- so ac --\neverything was expropriated. All the -- all -- you know, so my father lost -- they did allow us to\nstay in the apartment, which was -- which was in a way unusual, because [indecipherable] they\nwould chase you out.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And my father lost everything, you know, he lost his business, they took away everything\nfrom him, and they even searched the apartment to see whether there\u2019s any -- any monies or\nvaluables, or whatever, they would appropriate, because to them that was the you -- you know,\nthey were called the -- the kulogs, you know, the exploiters of the masses. Fortunately, the\nworkers actually did say that -- they did speak well of my father. So that helped, you know, in\nsome ways. But he lost it. So from -- so that was a -- a -- obviously a total loss, and -- and then\nmy father tried to make a living, you know, or black market was a -- was the -- was the thing to\ndo to try to, you know, scrape up a living and get a work permit, everybody had to work, you\nknow, my -- my brother worked for the railroad doing some -- he was mechanically inclined so\nhe did some locomotive repairs, and -- and I went to school, you know, I went to -- to a school\nand -- and then I -- all of a sudden the -- the Ukraine became the foreign language. Incidentally,\nbefore the war, before 1939, the foreign language was German, ironically, and the reason why it\nwas German is because for Poland, German was a very important language because it was a\nlanguage of science, of technology, which Poland always lacked. You know, like tools and\nimplements and machinery was -- was always in German. Moreover, L\u2019vov itself was under\nAustria for 150 years, so there was a lot of German influence in the -- in the -- in that area, too.\nIn fact, L\u2019vov was known as Lemberg, in German. And in Yiddish always Lemberg, you know,\nfor the Yiddish speaking. Like I would refer it to L\u2019wow, which is the Polish way of saying\nL\u2019 wow, L-w-o-w. But my father would always say Lemberg.",
        "Q: Lemberg.",
        "A: Yeah, right. So -- but then when this -- when the Russians took over that part of Poland, we\nwent to school and instead of German, it was Ukrainian.",
        "Q: So you were speaking German in school?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: As a language of --",
        "A: That was -- that was the foreign language that we were taught. No, no, Polish was the\nlanguage.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I see, okay.",
        "A: But we started early on [indecipherable] on a pla -- you know. He -- we started actually in\ngrade four we started already a foreign language, and that was German, was the foreign\nlanguage.",
        "Q: So now the foreign language was Ukrainian?",
        "A: Wa -- was Ukrainian, the -- the [indecipherable]. So Ukrainian because that became the\nUkrainian Soviet Republic, you know, from 1939 to \u201941.",
        "Q: Right. And was this -- was this harsh for you? I mean, the fact that your father loses his\nbusiness, that means there\u2019s much less money coming in.",
        "A: Oh sure.",
        "Q: So your life changes in a radical way.",
        "A: It\u2019s change -- changed -- 1-it changed in a way that -- that -- that we were not sure of food, but\n-- but we -- but there was no extravagance, there was no -- we had to kind of pull in a little bit,\nbut my father was very, very entrepreneurial and very adept in -- in scraping things up and so\nforth and got very into -- into doing all kinds of things. So we were not really that badly off,\nactually. We\u2019ll manage to -- to -- you know, to live fairly comfortably, fairly comfortably.",
        "Q: And his second -- well, his third wife now.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What\u2019s her name?",
        "A: Eugenia, Genya, Eugenia.",
        "Q: Eugenia -- you -- do you then become somewhat clo -- I mean, was she nice to you, as kids?",
        "A: We had big problems.",
        "Q: You had big problems.",
        "A: Because she was only about five years older than my brother. And being -- and being -- and\nbeing a housekeeper, you know, when you\u2019re young, you -- you don\u2019t have that sense of -- of --\nof -- of appreciation, of -- of a new role that -- that someone assumed, especially with my mother\nstill alive, and to be told here\u2019s a new mother, you know, 1-1s -- is kind of -- is hard. And she\ncame from a very small town in the pro -- in provinces, and -- and she tried to please my father\nby being very frugal, you know, to my father, the epitome of -- of womanhood was to be a good\nhousekeeper, and you know, a good -- a good -- frugal housekeeper and of course a very devoted\nwife, you know, and so he didn\u2019t ask us whether we would -- what we would th-think about her,\nyou know, being the new -- the new lady of the home, as it were. He just decided to do it, that\nwas his way of doing things. So we had some -- we had real problems with that, you know,\nSerious --",
        "Q: And it probably was difficult for her, though you would not necessarily have known that,\nbecause she\u2019s walking into this --",
        "A: Right, sure.

And of course he did come from a very modest background.\nAnd so in one way, you know -- but he didn\u2019t have that balance, you know, he didn\u2019t have that\nbalance, but -- but he loved music, you know, he had a good voice, he -- he was very, very\nintelligent, very bright. He knew the Scriptures really well, he knew the Talmud inside out, you\nknow. His favorite oc-occupation was to get into some -- some dialog with some -- some rabbis\nyou know, to show off his own knowledge of it, and -- and find some faults or errors 1n their -- in\ntheir knowledge, you know, of it. So that was one of his favorite pa -- you know, things that he\nwould -- and he read a lot, Jewish newspapers and so -- but no, he was very good to me when I\nwas very, very young. He\u2019d always have some candy in his pocket and all that. But then when I\nwas -- and -- and I was the only child of -- of my mother so he kind of doted on me.

In September, I -- I want to go back. In September\nwhen -- when the Germans attacked Poland, and they were on the outskirts of [indecipherable]\nwe were fully prepared for the -- for the Germans to arrive, you know? And then the Russians\ncame overnight, and they came with this huge, huge tanks, tore up the streets, you know, the\ncobblestones, and the overhead electrical for the -- you know, for streetcars, and because they\nhad these -- these lumbering, monstrous tanks. So -- so that was our first encounter with them.\nAnd -- and things have changed, you know? Now, we became very soon aware of the problems.\nWe already heard obviously before -- before the -- the -- the -- you know, bef -- before this\nwhole thing happened, all the problems of the war, and th -- obviously in the attack on Poland.\nAs you know, it was their -- their German blitzkrieg, which 1s a lightning war, with the\nchivalrous Polish cavalry attacking German tanks, you know, which was -- that was one of the\nthings that was so sad, you know, they just didn\u2019t -- they -- they -- just they couldn\u2019t fight the\nGermans at all, I mean they were just -- and so we had many, many refugees in L\u2019vov. In fact\nour house was full of refugees. We had one time -- there was my -- my -- my brother\u2019s mother\u2019s\nfamily. I remember that one time there was a family with six children cou -- staying with us in\nour -- in our home as refugees. And there were -- at one time, I think the record showed that\nthere was like a -- maybe a hundred thousand Jews that actually migrated or escaped from the --\nfrom the other side into -- into L\u2019vov, you know. And one of the ironies of war, which may be\nnot that well known, is that those refugees who came to L\u2019vov, desperately tried to stay in L\u2019vov.\nThey wanted to stay at L\u2019vov under the -- you know, because they felt they may be safe under\nthe Russians. But the Russians issued an edict that any Jew who did not -- was not a resident\nprior to 1939, had to be evacuated, had to leave. So they forcefully evacuated thousands and\nthousands of Jews from L\u2019vov to the far east of Russia. And these survived --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- you see. And yet many of them desperately tried -- they we -- tried to bribe authorities, they\ntried to get false papers and all that. And that didn\u2019t work at all, I mean, the Russians were very,\nvery strict. And I recall my father sending parcels to these relatives that were actually, you know,\ntaking ba -- taking it to -- to Russia, and these actually survived. And I remember them after the\nwar, you know, that they actually survived. So -- so there\u2019s one of those ironies, if you will, of\nthe war that people that didn\u2019t know what to do, with so much confusion and so forth and they\nactually survived, and the native, or the local people perished [indecipherable]",

You know, we had this short\nwave radio -- radio, and -- and wasn\u2019t -- was middle waves, actually, and we listened to BBC,\nright, London, this is London calling, you know. And we had all these -- you know, and also\nthere was an \u00e9migr\u00e9 Polish government in -- in London, so there were some Polish broadcasts as\nwell.

We just thought\nthat this was maybe part of the overall war effort as it were, and the Jews were considered also as\nbeing communists, you know, a lot of Jews belonged to the left or -- you know, socialists an --\norganizations, so the Germans may have been using this as an excuse to -- you know, to restrict\nand confine the Jews and so forth, and using that as a -- as a -- as a -- aS a co -- So there were a\nlot of mixed, mixed feelings.

        "Q: There\u2019s nothing.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: Are you going outside and playing with friends at all, or are you basically staying inside?",
        "A: Oh no, no. We\u2019re basically staying inside as much. I mean, there was some movement,\nsometimes I -- my father would send me out to try to fetch something, or a -- there was still some\nmovement, because you know there just -- there was a lot of co-mingling still between the Poles,\nUkrainians and the Jews. And of course anybody, any Jew who was -- who wore the traditional\nhat and beard and all that, would certainly risk a -- a -- a beating, if not a killing, you know, and\nso forth, so they stayed at home. Younger people [indecipherable] moved around. So there was\nstill quite a bit of movement, you know. Streetcars were operating, actually the streetcars were\neven operating inside the ghetto until the -- until later on, you know, because of still a lot of\nmovement into the ghetto, from the ghetto. So -- so that was -- I mean, there was no school, no --\nthere was no education, there was nothing. It was just a matter of -- of trying to -- to live from\none day to the next.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: We had very little contact, everybody was kind of on their own. There was a boy across the\nstreet, was a baker\u2019s son, I remember seeing him briefly. I don\u2019t know what happened, what they\n-- where they went. Everybody was trying to -- to do whatever they could to --",

        "Q: -- about what was happening to you?",
        "A: No, no I didn\u2019t wrote at that time, no I did not. There were -- no, it was just -- just a totally --\ntotal loss of a -- of a -- of reality as it were, you know, a sense of -- you know, from day to day.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. So how did you eat?",
        "A: Well, was whatever he could buy on the black market. Black market was the thing, you know.\nUsed to try to get some food. We had some -- I remember he had some potatoes stashed in the\nbasement from before, you know, and some canned stuff. And -- and we tried to do -- to eat that,\nof course. You know, food was scarce, was -- was a -- was a big problem.",
        "Q: And how in heaven\u2019s name did they feed Helen, this new baby?",
        "A: Was very hard. She was breastfeeding, and did the best she could.",

        "A: Very difficult.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Was very difficult. Was very, very, very difficult. It was a kind of suspense of belief if you\nwill -- if you -- if you -- what I mean -- I mean not believing that this is really happening, this is\nre-real, you know? So --",

        "A: Maybe.",
        "Q: Did it destroy something in you when you saw all of these people --",
        "A: I would not say that it destroyed, I was young. You know, when you\u2019re that young, you don\u2019t\nhave that sense of danger as 1t were, you know. You have a sense, of course, of terrible\ndisappointment and terrible hurt and injury. But I never feared for my life, per se, you know? I\nguess when you\u2019re very young, you -- you don\u2019t have those feelings of -- of eminent -- imminent\ndanger as it were. I mean, I had more fear later on when I tried to be somebody else. But I did\nwear my armband, of course, because I was 13 years old in August, you know.",
        "Q: So you --",
        "A: So I did wear an armband and -- and I recall incidentally that because of my looks -- we were\nnot allowed to walk on the sidewalk in L\u2019vov. When you wore an armband you had to walk on\nthe roadway and dodge whatever traffic there was, horse drawn or -- or -- or -- or cars, you\nknow. Not many -- many civilian cars, but you know, German cars, or what. And I remember a\nlot -- some of the Polish people looking at me kind of surprised because they were wondering\nwhether I was just playing games or something, or trying to imitate a Jew. Because here was this\n-- this -- this blonde, you know, blue eyed kid that absolutely didn\u2019t look Jewish at all, you know,\nwearing this armband with a -- with a Star of David, you know, and -- and I thought that was,\nyou know, kind of strange, but --",
        "Q: What was that like for you to put on that arm -- do you remember the first time you put it on?",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I kind of felt tainted, you know, I felt like I was -- you know, like I was -- I felt like\nanybody could spit at me, anybody could -- could kick me or beat me up, anything like that. That\nwas a very bad feeling, you know.",
        "Q: Did it happen?",
        "A: No, fortunately not, no I did not have that problem. I did -- I did lose my bicycle, that was just\ntaken away from me. Of course, that was soon as the -- you know, they -- I had a bicycle which I\nwas very proud of, was given to me a -- maybe -- I think 1t was under the Russians that my father\nobtained a bicycle somehow. And that was, you know, I wa -- I was ripped off, you know, that\nwas taken away. I didn\u2019t try to ride it, 1t was just in the -- stayed there in the -- in\n[indecipherable] the house. But no, I -- I -- I don\u2019t remember being a -- being accosted\npersonally, you know, although I saw a lot of beatings a-and -- and this kind of, you know,\natrocities, especially in the ghetto, you know, that was really bad.",
        "Q: Did you see people being shot?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Oh yes. I saw people -- I mean that was -- that was wanton. I mean, you know, I saw -- I\nremember turning the corner and I -- and we saw this Ukraine pulling down and shooting an old\nwoman. You know, just -- just -- I don\u2019t know whether it was target practice for him or what,\nyou know, but he just -- just did that, you know, and that -- and then I remember -- I didn\u2019t\nactually see the actual hanging, but I remember once coming into the ghetto from the outside and\nthere was this -- there were about seven or eight like lamp posts, you know, and there was\nhanging, you know, there was a public, you know, it was public hanging of -- of Jews right --\nhanging from the lamp post. They left them there for about -- I think couple of days, just to\nfrighten the people.",
        "Q: And what did that do to you?",
        "A: Terrible, was just very, very scary. Very scary. Just horrible. Was hard to describe.",
        "Q: Did you talk about it with your father?",
        "A: Oh, I mentioned it, I mention it to him when I saw him later on and I said -- and he heard\nabout it, cause it was be -- it was well-known. It was one of those Aktions, they called that\n[indecipherable] Aktions that the Germans did from time to time just to s -- just to keep\neverybody in check, just to -- to frighten the populace, and whatever pretext they could use to do\nthat, you know. But at that time, even in the ghetto, we still -- I did not he -- I was not aware -- I\nwas -- know there were transports. We knew there were people taken on the train to be sent\nsomewhere. But I-I don\u2019t -- did not hear about the crematoria, about the Auschwitz, or the\nBuchenwalds, or the Treblinkas and all that. At that time, didn\u2019t hear that.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That was still not -- people still felt that they were going somewhere, possibly to some labor\ncamps and all that, because there were labor camps surrounding the city.",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: Okay. Michael, before I ask you about going into the -- the ghetto in L\u2019vov, do you remember\npeople selling furniture and bringing clothes and having to bring fur because the Germans were\nasking for -- they were --",
        "A: Well, it was mainly, mainly there was collections of that, you know, for -- from -- but mainly\nthe Germans were much more interested in -- in -- in -- in money and jewelry and gold, you\nknow. Precious metals. Art objects, you know, and stuff like that. Basic clothing, I don\u2019t\nremember that as being a priority for them. But -- but 1t was a s -- just horrible in a sense that\nthere was, you know, there was never enough, you know, there was constantly -- and what I\nthink what the Germans tried to do is to get as much as they could before they -- before herding\neverybody into the ghetto, you know, because that was a time where they could actually grab\nthings and you were not allowed to bring anything to the ghetto than what you can carry. You\nknow, there was no -- no carriages of any kind, or -- or bicycles, anything like that. Whatever\nyou could car -- drag on your ba -- you know, hold on your back or suitcases and stuff. So there\nwas no [indecipherable] like -- occasionally I think they may have been able to hire maybe a -- a\n-- a-- a Pole or a Ukrainian with a -- with a cart or something like that if they could a -- if you\ncould pay for it, but generally you could see mass -- just procession of people just going into it\nwith -- with their basic belongings.",
        "Q: How -- how did you find out that you were supposed to go into the ghetto?",
        "A: All right, de -- there was announcements made, you know, there were pol -- you know, in --\nin -- in Poland the basic announcement that was made was not made on the radio or anything\nthat, they usually by -- by placards and by -- you know, they called aficias, you know, they put\non -- on -- on kiosks, you know, on -- on walls and all that. And it was just an announcement\nmade that as of that date, which was in November, everybody must -- must -- you know, they\nwere -- they were establish a district, you know, which is down the Zulkeyewska-\nZamarstynowska district, kind of a poor section of town, that everybody has to go into that area,\nthat was the ghetto. And -- and people were aware of the ghetto coming because there were\nghettos already established in the other part of Poland, which was under the Germans for two\nyears, you know, they started with the ghetto. So that -- so it was not totally unexpected that you\nhave to go into a ghetto. But it was very traumatic because people just have to leave everything\nbehind, you know, I mean even though they knew that -- they knew that they would, just the fact\nthat they had to do it, and when you do it, when you leave all of your lifetime belongings, all\nyour precious things, you -- you know, we didn\u2019t even have enough room for photographs, tha --\nthat -- I the -- there was no family photographs of when I was -- I remember I s -- I -- I had baby\nphotographs, you know, like you know, with my bare bottom on a -- on a -- on a bare rug, and all\nthese photographs taken as baby -- a ba -- and childhood pictures, nothing, I mean, because there\n-- because this was -- this was just a burden, you know, you had to -- clothing and -- and -- and\nwhatever you could take with you, you know, you took, but you didn\u2019t take albums or -- or -- or -\n- or -- or books, or anything like that, you know, that was just a -- something that you couldn\u2019t --\ncouldn\u2019t handle even. So that was totally lost, you know, all the family photographs, any kind of\npersonal belongings, mementos, whatever, what you will.",
        "Q: So who made -- how much time did you have once you saw the notice? Did you have weeks,\nor --",
        "A: They have about -- they ta -- they said originally I believe it was like 30 days or 40 days, 45\ndays, and I guess it was extended because they just couldn\u2019t handle all of it. But by -- I would\nsay by -- probably by mid-December, most of the -- most of the Jews were -- there were still\nsome Jews left outside by papers, who had connections as it were, with the Judenrat or were\nspecially singled out by the Germans as desirable to -- you know, to -- for want some work to be\ndone, or -- or special work to be done and so forth. They were very selective about who they\nconsidered desirable and who not. So -- so by, I would say, by the -- by the end of December or\nso, you know, close to that, most of the -- of the Jews were in the ghetto, but that was still left\nopen, it was still open back and forth and -- and Jews with work permits could leave the ghetto,\nthey wer -- worked outside the ghetto, they -- there were all kinds of laborer camps established,\nyou know, within the city, to work for the German, you know, ni -- whatever it was, clothing\nmanufacturer, all kinds of manufacturing. Cause the Germans took advantage of every -- of\nevery able body since all of their -- their men were in the army, you know, so they used Poles\nand Jews and Ukrainians, and -- for whatever labors -- requirements they had, or they felt was --\nwas necessary for the war effort, you know.",
        "Q: Do you remember the day you left your house and went into the ghetto?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the exact day. I remember making two trips. I remember one trip with --\nwith -- I mentioned to you, with my brother\u2019s grandmother, and then I came back and then I -- I\nmay have gone maybe once or twice, you know, because you were able -- you were allowed to\ngo in and out, you know, so you could make several trips before your domicile was empty and\nlooted, or whatever, so you were able to -- to do that. So I -- it may have been more than one trip,\nmaybe several trips, bringing in as much as a -- you know, could by -- but by that time you see,\nthere was no help, my brother was already in the camp, my -- my oldest was in the army, the\nRussian army. So there was just my father, Mose -- Genya, and -- and Helen, and then there was\nalso a cousin. My brother\u2019s sister\u2019s son, Chana Koch was her name, from Tomaszow. And so she\nwas -- she was with us too, and so she kind of -- and she also spoke Ukrainian, and she kind of\nlooked like a peasant, you know, with a kerchief. You did everything to hide your -- you know,\nyour identity, as 1t were. And you took a chance by taking your armband off, and -- which I did\nseveral times, just to be able to move around, you know, to be more -- more -- more free. And\nthen eventually just ended up in the ghetto finally, you know.",
        "Q: So how -- how were the decisions made as to what to take? Or was --",
        "A: Whatever you are allowed to take.",
        "Q: What --",
        "A: You were just allowed to take what you could carry with you. And -- and if you could get\nsome help, if you could get somebody to -- to -- to -- to -- to a cart, or he -- not your so -- not\nyour own, but if you can hire somebody, and pay with whatever, with your watch or with your\nmoney, or with ev -- then they would do that, you know, but --",
        "Q: And you can bring more in.",
        "A: Can bring more in.",
        "Q: But now how -- how was it decided where you were going to stay?",
        "A: Oh, that was basically you tried to -- my -- m-my father tried to find a place. You tried to -- to\nget into the ghetto and locate a place, and we found a place which 1s like a -- an old house where\nwe used a downstairs and another family used upstairs. These were homes that were vacated,\nobviously by -- by the residents who -- who, you know, ventured out for much better quarters,\nand it was a good deal, you know, a good swap for them. So there were a lot of them were just --\njust left, even with some of the -- some of the old furniture, or old cots, or old, you know, straw\nmats, you know, mattresses and stuff like that. So we find that -- you know, you find that place\nthat --",
        "Q: This is going to sound naive, but I\u2019m -- I -- I -- I -- how does one just sort of say, well this is\nmine? Do you put a sign on the door?",
        "A: Well, a --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] have it --",
        "A: -- s-some of them were assigned.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And some of them, you know, some were just open and you just -- you just -- you just went --\ngot in there and --",
        "Q: And stayed.",
        "A: -- and took it, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And the -- did the Judenrat have anything to do with the assignments of these places?",
        "A: Some of it did, I think they probably -- they -- they -- they tried to assign a lot of the people,\nable bodied workers, you know, into si -- into quarters that they felt were easier to access in\nterms of getting in -- you know, to f -- to work and so forth. So there were some -- some of it was\nby the Judenrat and some of it was a -- just on your own. You Just tried to find whatever you\ncould on your own. Because, you see, there was still a lot of movement available, you know, if\nyou -- as long as you wore an armband at that time, you still could move. You could move into\nthe ci -- out and in -- out of the city and so forth. Now, you had to have papers where you could\nhave been stopped at any moment. If you didn\u2019t have papers you were -- you\u2019d have been taken\naway or shot or beaten up, or whatever. You had to have work papers. And the first thing that my\nfather did, being entrepreneurial as he was, he got some work papers. He never -- he didn\u2019t work,\nbut he got the pap -- papers, he paid for them. So he had always a work paper, you know. Ar --\nArbeitschein, you know. But he didn\u2019t work, no, no, he was able to get away with it.",
        "Q: Now, you said there were a number of times when you -- you\u2019d leave the ghetto area, and\ntake off your -- your badge.",
        "A: Well, s-sometimes when I -- when I wanted to carry something, or -- or -- or get something,\nyou know, like buy some -- some food or something, to be sure that I wasn\u2019t -- you know, that it\nwasn\u2019t taken away from me, I would take the armband off surreptitiously, and then once I was in\nthe ghetto, I would put it on again, you know. But I had to be very careful about that, you know.\nI mean, if I had been spotted by somebody doing that, I would have been in real trouble. But you\nknow, again, when you\u2019re young, you -- you -- you -- you\u2019re fearless in a way, you know. And to\nme it was -- was daring and I -- I -- I mean, I feel like every time I would take it off, I feel like I -\n- like I vanquished some -- you know, like I was getting even, as it were, you know? And I was\nproud of myself that I -- that I was able to do that, even though I was -- I was scared, obviously.\nSo -- and -- so these are carn -- now -- now there is -- now I\u2019m coming to a very, very traumatic\nexperience, which 1s our very first close call in the ghetto, if I may. One day, the door burst open,\na Ukrainian came in with his gun and said, \u201cCome with me.\u201d My father was away, he was doing\nsomething somewhere, was just Genya and Helen and I. Didn\u2019t allow to take anything with us,\nand was walking us to a transport. There was a railroad station Zamarstynowska, and we know\nby the direction that we are going to a transport [indecipherable] there were -- at that time that\nwas already starting to load people to wherever the destination they decided. He -- and he pulled\na gun, and with the gun he was walking us towards that. That was one time when I felt it was --\nwas the end, was the beginning of the end. Genya was holding Helen in her arms and started to\nspeak Ukrainian to the guard, and begging him to let us go. And she said, \u201cFor the fear of God,\nplease let us go. Look at this child in my arms, look at this young boy.\u201d She said, \u201cDo please let\nus go. We don\u2019t,\u201d -- you know, \u201cwhy -- why don\u2019t you do that?\u201d And then he spotted a gold\nwatch on Genya\u2019s wrist, and he took the -- the watch and he said, \u201cGo away.\u201d We were about\nmaybe 10 minutes away from the railroad station. Now that was one time when I cried, really\ncried, because I saw this poor Helen and Genya, and -- and I thought myself, what will my father\ndo when he comes home and we\u2019re gone? Cause this happened so often, you know, that a worker\nwould go, you know, to a -- to a camp, to a labor camp -- these were workshops, you know,\nwithin the ghetto. He would come home and -- and his family would be gone. He\u2019d never know -\n- you didn\u2019t know from one hour to the next. You didn\u2019t know whether you would come back\nfrom work. Because if you did something that they didn\u2019t like, didn\u2019t like the way you looked, or\nthe way this, that was it, you know, they took you away, or -- or you never -- you d -- you\ndisappeared. So this was one time when I really broke down. So there\u2019s one -- one of many close\ncalls. But this was one that was a -- that was our really first call, especially with that gun drawn,\nyou know, where we\u2019re facing, really facing -- and then we didn\u2019t even -- I didn\u2019t even know\nwhether he was going to shoot us on the way to, which he could have easily done, because there\nwere shootings all over, you know, I mean, it\u2019s almost like -- like hearing sirens, and the fire --\nfire engines in New York City when you live in Manhattan, you know, after a while you just --\nyou just hear it, and -- and you don\u2019t hear it, you know, the gunshots and -- and -- and -- and\nscreams, or whatever, you know. And -- so I thought -- I didn\u2019t know whether he was going to\neven bother with us -- taking us to the -- to the -- to the railroad station, to the yards, or whether\nhe was going to shoot us right on the way to. So that was really bad, that was really bad. That\nwas when I began to really, really began to feel the -- the -- the -- the depth of that -- of that -- of\nthat atrocity, the depth of that -- of that human degradation, you know? And that total feeling of\nhelplessness, you know, totally -- totally helpless, you know. Totally at the mercy of -- of -- of a\nwhim, of -- of a want, and you know, just as -- just -- just is -- 1s incredible when you think about\nit, you know? That you could just -- anybody -- anybody that could just do whatever they wanted\nwith you. Whatever they wanted. With no restraint. No restrictions. So the life in the ghetto, you\nknow, was -- was very hard. Food was very, very scarce, people were starving. My father, again,\nwas able to scrape up things. We did not -- maybe had one meal a day. Frozen potato peels were\nat a premium. Frozen potato peels. The things that were discarded, you know, by the -- by the\nrestaurants, or by the place, whatever, you know, by others. But we managed. We didn\u2019t starve to\ndeath. I'd -- I was, you know, hungry at times, but -- but I didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t really starve, per se,\nwhere I -- where I couldn\u2019t sleep because I was too hungry to sleep. And -- and then there was a\ntime, too, when my father establish a contact with a gentleman from Warsaw by the name of\nZaremba -- Zaremba, who would come into the ghetto, and he would trade with -- in gold and in\n-- and in gold coins and all that, because the people trying to -- to buy -- be able to buy food on\nthe black market, would sell whatever they could salvage of their personal jewelry, valuables,\ngold coins and sell it to [indecipherable]. So he would come into this -- to -- to -- into the ghetto,\nwas still wide open, and my father would do business with him, you know, by trading, and then\nin some ways helping those people to -- to get money to be able to buy things, and also, of\ncourse, trying to make some money for himself. So this Mr. Zaremba, that was the contact that\nI\u2019m using -- mention [indecipherable] advisory, because that has a tremendous impact on my\nfuture survival, as it were.",
        "Q: Before we go into the details of that, what is -- Eugenya -- is Eugen -- Eugenia or Genya --",
        "A: Oh Genya, [indecipherable] be called as Genya, yeah.",
        "Q: Was her voice -- when she talked to this Ukrainian guard, as calm as yours?",
        "A: It was a pleading voice. I didn\u2019t say anything. I would -- I didn\u2019t know --",
        "Q: So [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "A: -- she was -- it -- it was a -- it was a really pleading, begging for mercy.

        "A: He could have taken the gold watch and -- and -- and -- and shoot us, but you know, maybe\nhe was ambivalent, or maybe he was -- maybe he was taken by the fact that she spoke Ukrainian,\ninstead of begging in Yiddish, as some might, you know, who did not speak Ukrainian\n[indecipherable] probably spoke Ukrainian. There were many Jews in -- in -- in -- in -- in L\u2019vov,\nmany who didn\u2019t speak even a g -- decent Polish.",

Could have been\nMajdanek, Treblinka, depending on the -- on the workload and -- and -- and the capacity of the --\nof the trains and the -- and the -- and the -- the cars available and the distances involved and so\nforth.

        "Q: Was there a kind of social hierarchy in the ghetto so people -- you know, were wealthier\npeople, people [indecipherable]",
        "A: Definitely.",
        "Q: -- and -- and other difference --",
        "A: There were -- well, there was the Judenrat, you know, and the -- and the Judenrat had a lot of\npeople working with them. And I guess, by virtue of their -- their work, which -- and I\u2019m not\ntrying to be critical now, I\u2019m just trying to say that -- that -- that they try -- they thought they\nwere helping, you know, and then since they weren\u2019t, they obviously had a more privileged\nstatus that the Germans didn\u2019t bother them. I mean they let them live, as it were, and they let\nthem maybe give them some rations of food or whatever, you know, a helper. And there were\nalso, of course, people that were well off. They had the monies to -- to obtain things in the black\nmarket. They had monies to maybe buy a -- a -- a labor permit like my father had, you know. On\nthe other hand there were many, many very poor ones, you know. I mean, the higher -- the -- the\nsocial structure of the Jews involved was typical of -- of -- of -- of social structures and maybe\neven like nowadays here at home in the States, there were -- they were not just merchants, they\nwere cobblers, they were tailors, they were -- and in street where I live, you know, there was a\nbaker across the street. There was a -- a -- a -- a -- a-- you know, a shoemaker. There was even --\neven one that -- that had a horse and buggy, you know, that -- they call them fiacres, you know,\nthey were -- they were like taxis, you know, horse -- horse drawn taxis, you know, the old type\nyou know with the -- that you see in Stanley Park, you know, in New York. And so there were\nall stratas. In fact, we even have a couple Jewish prostitutes that we knew of.",
        "Q: In the ghetto?",
        "A: In -- no, no, no, in L\u2019vov.",
        "Q: In L\u2019vov.",
        "A: In L\u2019vov. Now I-I\u2019m using this advisorly because -- because to -- to res -- to respond to your\nquestion about the strata of the social structure, there was -- there were all kinds of different\nstructures, unlike the small shtetls where you had only maybe a few merchants and maybe a\ncobbler or something. In the big cities they -- you had all classes of society, represented by the\nJews, which is not ba -- maybe that well known. So -- so as a result, these people who went into\nthe ghetto were obviously the same -- same groups, of social groups. And the ones that -- that --\nthat were poor obviously the ones -- the first ones to -- to -- too poor to die of -- of -- of -- of\nstarvation, of san -- poor sanitation, of lack of clothing. You know, winters can be very se -- very\nsevere in Poland, you know, it\u2019s got a severe, you know, si -- a kind of a -- you know, northern\nCanadian, if you will, climate, you know, like a climate of like a Winnipeg. Very, very below\nzero temperatures. In fact, I remember I got once frostbite, that was before the war, on my toes,\njust going to school and going back, because I -- because the school was closed and I insisted on\ngoing to school because I felt a sense of duty, I must go to school, I must go to school. My\nparents insisted I don\u2019t go, well sure enough I went and by the time I came back, I had frostbite\non two of my toes, you know, and I was sick for several days, you know, and long healing\nprocess. So -- so that what happened, you know, the -- the ones that were -- and of course many\n[indecipherable] of the young men, maybe some of the poor [indecipherable] Jewish police of\nthe ghetto, they felt that they could -- this is one -- there was one way of -- of also prolonging the\nsurvivals -- prolonging the -- the -- the -- the way of life, or trying to, you know, trying to -- to --\nto manage not to be sent away. So they were [indecipherable] they were policemen that they --\nthey used -- that they used by the Germans as Jewish police to keep order or carry out, you\nknow, some of the orders that the Germans used, especially in rounding up people, you know, for\n-- for the labor camps and checking documents and so forth.",
        "Q: Were they hated in the ghetto, the Jewish police?",
        "A: They were not liked in the ghetto. No, they\u2019re definitely not liked in the ghetto at all. In fact, I\nwould say probably most of them were hated. Because they were -- they were -- they saw them\ndoing the kind of things that -- that they were and -- and I don\u2019t think -- th-they were hated. They\nwere basically hated, I\u2019m sure. And I -- and I\u2019m su -- I\u2019m sure many of them thought they were\ndoing good things, th-they -- they were helping, like the Judenrat, you know? But in the end of it,\nthey didn\u2019t, obviously. They didn\u2019t help, no, nothing helps. Nothing helped.",
        "Q: And did people -- were they angry at the Judenrat as well, that they didn\u2019t like what they were\ndoing, there was [indecipherable |",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that was generally -- I think that the feeling was that the Judenrat was -- was\ntrying to help, but I don\u2019t think that they were -- they were thinking that they were doing any\ngood, per se. From what I know my -- my father didn\u2019t have a very high opinion of the Judenrat.\nHe felt that they were just -- just being a mouthpiece for the Germans, or you know, trying to\nkeep things together. And so historically one could argue that perhaps they did help, you know,\nin some ways to prolong the -- the -- the agony as it were, you know.",
        "Q: And did you notice people being selfish, corrupt, stealing from each other. I mean, what did\nyou notice about the --",
        "A: Well, that -- ? ve been thinking about that all, and you know, I came to the conclusion that --\nthat a lot -- some of them just -- just trying to survive did some very unspeakable things. Can you\nblame them for it? I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what I could really say that they did it on\npurpose. They did it because they -- they felt that that --as that was one way of surviving. And\none of the things that I remember my father commenting about some of the Jewish police -- I\ndidn\u2019t see it myself, but commenting, that actually they would, in rounding up old people, those\nare the priorities, getting the old and the sick and get ri -- getting rid of them. That he actually\nsaw it himself, that they were actually taking their parents and marching them off because they\nwere told to round up old people and so forth. And that was -- I\u2019m sure that was not done a lot.\nWas an aberration, but it only was a -- it was an example of -- of what can be done, how -- you\nknow, to -- to the psyche of a human under -- under these terrible conditions, you know. How it\ndestroys any sense of -- of propriety, any sense of -- of reason and then -- and family feelings and\nyou know, like that. Self preservation, misguided, sick.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re going to change the tape now.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: Okay. Michael, when we ended in the last tape, we were -- I was asking you about a kind of\nhierarchy in the -- in the ghetto, and I wanted to know whether -- you spoke about your father\ntelling a story about police -- Jewish police taking their parents. I want to know if you ever saw\nanything, people mistreating each other. Di -- not that you heard of it, but you were watching\nwhat people were doing and how they were behaving.",
        "A: I have not really seen myself, actual, any kind of physical violence against one another. What\nI saw is people with anguish on their faces, obviously people were hungry. People also not\nknowing who was who, you know, having -- look -- having -- looking with fear, looking with\ndistrust, with apprehension. You know, when this happens day after day after day after day, it\nwears and it becomes a -- almost a way of life, you know, you -- you -- you feel hunted and\nhaunted and so I saw that, you know. I -- I mean there was -- certainly there wasn\u2019t ever any kind\nof humor, or any kind of -- of -- of -- of what shall I say, feeling of relax -- of relaxation in any\nway, everything was tense. The air was tense, and -- and because the ghetto was open, you see, it\nwas open to everybody to go in and out, in fact the streetcar was going all the way to the end of\nthe line, which I used later on when I left the ghetto, and -- so anybody could come in, you know,\nand they -- and you looked and you didn\u2019t know who was who. Obviously people who -- the\nJews wore -- wore armbands, but when you ra -- walked the street and you ran into somebody\nwithout one, who was that person? Was a Ukrainian, was it a Pole, was it a friend, was it a foe?\nWas it a secret police, you know, because they use a lot of secret police without -- no uniforms.\nWhat would happen next, you know? You -- yo-you -- you walk to -- you know, you try to -- to\navoid that -- that person. So it was just a -- a kind of a -- a feeling of siege, a feeling of a -- a\nsiege mentality, okay? With hunger, with -- with -- you know, and -- and -- and one of the things\nthat I -- I saw 1s a lot of the -- of the hearses, you know, that that -- you saw a lot of that horse\ndrawn -- cause they were collecting bodies. And that, of course, that did it to Jews who worked\non the -- so you saw that, and that be -- that was a common scene. You know, you turn the\ncorner, you walk the street and there was an-another one hearse, and -- and a -- maybe another\none somewhere else. So you saw that, you know, and -- but -- but as far as overt mistreating per\nse, I did not see that.",
        "Q: I mean even psychologically, not necessarily physically. You say people didn\u2019t -- there was\nno humor. Do -- do you remember your mood?",
        "A: Well, my mood was basically one of -- of -- of anger, some fear. Sometimes feeling of\nhunger, and basically also a feeling of loneliness, you know, I was -- I was -- I didn\u2019t have any\nfriends, I didn\u2019t have anybody to -- to associate with, and I lost all my -- the contact with all my -\n- my playmates, my -- my classmates, you know. So I was totally alone, you know, and when\nyou\u2019re 13 years old, you need companionship, you need -- you need to -- to you know, you --\nyou want to -- to -- to play, you want to associate with somebody because you\u2019re not a grown-up,\nyou know, you don\u2019t have much in common with the adults, you know. So there was this feeling\nof isolation and loneliness, you know, this [indecipherable] living from one day to the next, not\nknowing what\u2019s going to happen next.",
        "Q: But there were other kids in the ghetto?",
        "A: There were other kids in the ghetto, but -- but -- but there was not much -- much\n[indecipherable]. Everybody was just -- was just a survival feeling, you know. I mean, that -- that\n-- you didn\u2019t play in the streets, no way. You wouldn\u2019t dare to do that, you wouldn\u2019t want to do\nthat. I think if you played and had fun probably somebody would descend on you -- even on the\nkids, you know, and then and so there was -- there was not -- none of that. I mean, I would walk,\nyou know, I would maybe take a walk and -- and go there and look around and -- and so forth,\nbut I -- I had no -- there was no way of -- of having, at least in my area where I was, no\nplaymates, nobody to really exchange any thoughts or ideas or whatever, you know. And you\ndidn\u2019t even dare to talk about it, you know, you didn\u2019t know whom you were talking to.",
        "Q: Did you see a change in your father and in Genya, did their personalities become harsher in\ntheir way of behaving different than you had seen before?",
        "A: Well, they -- I think -- I think my father never showed much of that himself, he was always\nsort of tough and survival type of, you know, person. Genya, I would say was probably more --\nmore affected, more distraught. She was -- I think she was -- she took it very hard when -- when\nHelen was given away, losing her child. But that was the only way, that was, you know, my\nfather had this -- this -- always a sense of trying to see what can be -- can be done to survive, you\nknow, that was one of his -- was always this -- this -- he had that very strong survival instinct and",
        "Q: So it was his idea to do that?",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sure, oh definitely, I -- we had to pay for it too, you know, this was not done for free.\nSo -- so that was that feeling, too. So she was -- she was very -- very badly -- t-took -- it was\nvery bad for her to do that. And also, my father was out, you know, since he had a work permit,\nhe could mingle, he could go out there and he could scrounge and do whatever he could, while\nshe was always at home, you know, I mean, she was -- she didn\u2019t -- she didn\u2019t work. So therefore\nshe -- she was basically just as much alone as I was, you know? My brother was already in camp,\nyou know, so -- so there was just like the days -- from one day to the next, you know, I mean just\n-- you lose a sense of time, you lose a sense of -- of balance and -- and then you -- you -- down\nthe street you see some people that lived there and all of a sudden they\u2019re -- they\u2019re gone, you\nknow. So -- so it was basically as I said before, it was just a total feeling of -- of a -- of a siege\nmentality, of a -- you know, being totally -- being sort of a -- a hopelessness, you know, if you\nwill.",
        "Q: Where did the food come from when you went to Winniki, to -- to bring food to your brother?",
        "A: Okay, now Genya would prepare some food, you know, she would make it and she would put\nin a -- in acardboard container. And then I would go out of the ghetto, the ghetto was still open\nat the time, and -- actually even with the armband, and I would go all the way out. I would walk.\nIt was maybe 10 miles or so, but for a young kid 10 miles isn\u2019t that far. Or more, maybe more,\nI\u2019m not exactly the distance.",
        "Q: One way\u201d",
        "A: But most of the time -- one way -- but most of the time it was not Winniki, it was -- it was\nactually -- in Winniki I think 1t was maybe once or twice, but maybe half a dozen times I went to\nthe opposite direction, actually in the direction of the Janowska lager -- Janowska camp, I should\nsay. And there there was a quarry where my brother George was working in a -- with a group of\nother inmates, and as I said before, he -- by hand, you know, they were actually breaking up\nboulders and stones and crushing them to create the -- the -- the gravel for the -- for the roads\nbecause that\u2019s what the -- the Germans were always trying to keep their roads, you know, going,\nyou know, for the -- for the armies, for the -- the troops and for the -- and so forth. So he was\nthere, you know, and that was -- that was a terrible sight to see these men who were not -- you\nknow, not even used to this hard physical labor, you know, they were -- to be able to all day\nlong, can you imagine all day long standing there and -- and with hammers breaking -- breaking\nstones with very little breaks, you know, maybe four minutes at a time. And like eight or 10\nhours a day, you know. So many died, you know, my -- my -- my George relates the -- the -- the\nfact that many who couldn\u2019t -- who were weak, you know, or cou -- or wou -- couldn\u2019t -- you\nknow, couldn\u2019t make it, you know, were just shot and so I remember that, so that\u2019s why we got\nthe food and that was -- that helped them a lot. But then -- course when I -- when I left, and of\ncourse when they would -- they wouldn\u2019t allow food later on and he made some contacts with\nsome local peasants where he -- they were helping him out a little bit too, but -- but he had a\nvery, very rough time of it. He had typhoid fever in the camp, he was almost shot because of\nthat. There was an outbreak of typhoid fever, which kind of decimated the camp that he was in\nand they brought in new people into the camp. So that\u2019s how -- that\u2019s what happened with the --\nwith that.",
        "Q: Was it -- was it dangerous for you to walk on [indecipherable]",
        "A: At that time it wasn\u2019t that dangerous because the ghetto was still open, there was still a lot of\ncommunication. And when I brought the food, at that time the guards allowed food. They still\nallowed food at that early stage. They just didn\u2019t bother, you know, with that, and I was a young\nkid, you know, so I just went over. And -- and you can imagine what the other -- when they saw\nfood, what happened. Of course my brother would share some of it with them, too, you know,\nbecause they were -- everybody was hungry there. They gave them food but obviously nowhere\nnear enough for the physical exertion and the fill of hard labor. I mean you -- just incredible\nwhen you -- just the sight of those poor -- poor people doing that. It was just like a deliberate\nway of -- of, you know, of killing them with -- with -- with -- with forced labor, because how\nmuch could they accomplish, you know, by -- by breaking up stones, you know, manually, you\nknow, I mean there\u2019s just a -- we just -- but they did, you know, and they -- they built the roads\nand -- and my brother eventually ended up on a -- on a steamroller, you know, and so forth, he\u2019s\na -- he has his own story to tell about that.",
        "Q: Were you a -- were you able to spend a little time with your brother, or you came with food\nand you left?",
        "A: Oh no, no, I just came with food, and -- and when he finished eating I would bring -- I would\ntake the -- the pots, they -- there was a couple stacked up back --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and I just watched him eat, which took very little time, believe me, you know, he just\ngulped it down, practically. And then I would just bring it back and I was able to do it a few\ntimes. I think maybe no more than maybe three or four times.",
        "Q: I see, so this wasn\u2019t a long term --",
        "A: Yeah, oh, no, no, no, it wasn\u2019t an ongoing thing, no, you couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t do that.",
        "Q: This must have been hard on you. I don\u2019t mean the walk, but seeing him in that place.",
        "A: Oh God, it was horrible, was just horrible to see him because you know, was horrible. And to\nsee all these other young -- young men, they -- they se -- they selected those, you know, for -- for\nthe labor and -- and was just a -- t -- horrible sight. I feel sorry for -- I p -- feel badly for my -- I\nmean from one trip to the next, I didn\u2019t even know whether he would survive, you know,\nwhether I would see him again.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Cause you didn\u2019t know. And then the -- and then they had occasions when they were\nmarching back to the camp from the day\u2019s work, sometimes they would get stopped, and at\nrandom they would pick out some of these and -- and shoot them. In fact, they had a -- they --\nthey -- one of those camp com -- commandants had a rule that for every inmate that tried to\nescape, even if he was caught, they would sic -- shoot six -- six of -- of the -- of the -- of the\ninmates in the camp, and that\u2019s -- so -- so that happened too, and he almost got shot, so -- so he --\nhe had a really tough time of it, but he managed just to survive.",
        "Q: So how did it happen that you were going to leave L\u2019vov ghetto? Is there something that\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Okay, okay, now my father obviously realized, you know, that something -- that how -- how\nwe -- how are we going to survive, you know. He didn\u2019t know what -- what -- you know, he tried\nto work out something. Escaping from the ghetto was impossible. Even when there was open,\nyou know, there was no way. He couldn\u2019t do it himself because he would be immediately\nrecognized as being a Jew. Genya wouldn\u2019t leave my father. And so he came upon this idea, and\none morning he said -- he prepared, you know, getting prepared a little backpack, and he sa --\nand he gave me a birth certificate in Latin, with the name of Mieczyslaw Wereszczyszyn. And he\nsaid, \u201cYou take this, you go to the railroad station, you buy a ticket for Warsaw, and you\u2019re\ngoing to go to Mr. Zaremba\u2019s apartment.\u201d So he did arrange with Mr. Zaremba, the business\nassociate of his to -- for me to at least get to him. Whether he was -- I was going to stay with him\nor not I didn\u2019t know that, but that was the address he gave me in Warsaw.",
        "Q: So there\u2019s no preparation [indecipherable] nothing.",
        "A: There was absolutely no preparation, no, my father wasn\u2019t like that, he said, hey, this is it. He\ndidn\u2019t ask me am I afraid to go, or -- or what to do. He said, this is what you have to do, this 1s\nwhat you do. And he obtained this birth certificate, I guess, on the black market, whatever it was.\nIt looked very, very authentic, as it will be evident later on from my -- from my talk here. And --\nand that\u2019s what I did. I remember taking that little backpack. He gave me enou -- gave me money\nfor the railroad ticket. Then he told me that in my jacket there was a sewn in gold coin, the\npurpose of which I didn\u2019t know exactly what he wanted for, but I realized later on what it was\nfor. And I remember taking the backpack, and we were on a -- a -- our ghetto was on a street\ncalled Sienna, S-1-e-n-n-a, Sienna Street. And just about two blocks away was the last stop of the\nstreetcar, and that was like in the spring of \u201942, I don\u2019t know exactly the date, but it was before\nthe ghetto was closed, you know. I believe the ghetto was closed in August, I believe, of \u201942,\nright? That was before then. It was a nice day, warm day. And I remember before I turned the\ncorner, I took off my armband and threw it away, jumped on the streetcar and went straight to the\nrailroad station. Bought a ticket for Warsaw. Nobody questioned, there was a lot of movement\nthere, I mean, you know. After all, you\u2019re not a li -- little baby when you\u2019re 13 year old, you\u2019re a\nyoung boy. And I got on the train and went towards Warsaw. And this is when I had my second\nclose call, very, very close call. As we were riding on the train, all of a sudden the train was\nstopped. It was somewhere near Lublin, which is a city in the Lublin province, okay? Everybody\nout. The whole train was emptied out. And here were the Germans, SS with some civilians,\nsetting up a table. Everybody out? Everybody in line? And everybody show documents. And\nthen they would say left and right. Right were older people, women with documents, Poles,\nUkrainians, you name it, whatever. Maybe even some civilian Germans who were let go right\naway. On the left they [indecipherable] some young men -- many young men. And then I heard\nthe murmur, the talk among those that this another one of those round-ups for Polish workers\nthat the Germans periodically would grab to send them to their factories, wherever it was,\nwhether it\u2019s in Poland or Germany or any place, to work in their factories because they were\nshort of manpower, because everybody was in the -- on the -- you know, in the army, the\nGerman army. So I had no choice, I had to go in. So I showed my -- my birth certificate, he\nlooked at me, left. I guess they felt that I was old enough to maybe be a worker, too. I was in\ngood shape. So, what\u2019s next then? Okay, I asked around, they said well -- one of the guys said,\nwhat they do is they take you into a staging area overnight and in the morning you go to a public\nbath because they want to -- to delouse you, as they called it, you know, before you go anywhere\nelse, you know, and so forth. And then you -- and then they ship you out. And these guys, you\nknow, they didn\u2019t care, they were Poles you know, so they were -- some of them had -- had\nvodka with them and this and that, you know, and there were -- there were [indecipherable] say\nwell, that\u2019s what we have to do, we have to ta -- these are the ones that obviously didn\u2019t have any\npapers, working papers. So I spend a kind of a sleepless night because I knew that if I went to a\npublic bath my anatomy would immediately betray me and that would be the end of it, the end of\nit. Whether they would have informed on me, or whether they would just kick me out you know,\nand -- but the guards were there, you know, they were -- they obviously didn\u2019t want anybody to\nrun away. So in the morning, as we were -- and I left my backpack behind, of course, because\nyou would -- after the bath you would go back to the camp again, right, and then from there they\nwould transport you and load you on a train and wherever they -- you know, they ship. So as we\nwere walking towards the bathhouse, and I thought okay, here is the end of that, right? At the\nbathhouse, one of the guys, he said, \u201cRun away, run away.\u201d Because they kind of -- there was\nanother guard, there was one of the people there, because I was the kid, I was the youngest, there\nwas nobody in my age in that group. In fact, I guess they probably thought what is he doing\nhere? You know, I mean, this young kid doesn\u2019t belong. And one of the Ukrainian guards kind of\n-- was turned his back -- and this was a busy area, and the guy says, \u201cGo, run away.\u201d And I just\nran. And I ran right across the street, left my -- my -- my backpack, still had my ticket wa -- on\nme, fortunately I didn\u2019t leave it in my backpack. And went on the next train, continued to\nWarsaw. You know, when you think about it -- when I think about it, 1t just seems unreal. Just\nunreal. And then on the train --",
        "Q: Wait, one second. How come you weren\u2019t scared to just run? What -- what did --",
        "A: Because I had no choice.",
        "Q: There\u2019s one -- uh-huh.",
        "A: I had no -- I had no choice. In fact, when I ran I thought I was going to hear a shot behind me.\n[ -- I just ran. I mean what -- there was nothing that I could do. I thought myself, this is it. I had\nto do that. You know, cause I was still -- I didn\u2019t do it on my own, I was kind of encouraged, I\nsay hey, run, go, go, go, go. It was -- I mean, I had no choice because -- because I\u2019m sure that if I\n-- if -- if they had discovered, there were enough of them whoever it was that would -- would\nhave informed on me. Some may -- would have not, maybe some would have just, you know,\nsaid tha -- but somebody sure would have, cause there were just too many of them not to have at\nleast one or two that would have said, hey this -- this Jewish kid, you know, he -- he da -- has no\nright to live, you know, I mean, kill him. I had no choice. When you have no choice you just do\nit.",
        "Q: And what was in your backpack that you left?",
        "A: Just some belong -- some underwear, you know, a sweater, [indecipherable] nothing --\nnothing of any --",
        "Q: So you have the jacket with the --",
        "A: Jacket --",
        "Q: -- the gold coin.",
        "A: -- gold coin sewn into the lining of the jacket.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the ticket in my pocket.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And my -- and my birth certificate --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- you know, on me. And I\u2019m --",
        "Q: So you [indecipherable] on the train again.",
        "A: -- on a train to Warsaw. And then I\u2019m in -- on the train to Warsaw, and I sit in this -- in this --\nin this cabin, you know, there was like -- on the train. And that was pretty crowded. And then\nthere was this woman looking at me sort of askance. She didn\u2019t know what to make of me, you\nknow, she thought, you know. So she asked me, cross yourself. Now, this not a simple thing.\nMost Jewish kids wouldn\u2019t know how to do it, even, or if they did it they wouldn\u2019t do it right. I\nhappened to have known how to do that. Because in Poland what you have to do is you have go\nthis, this, this, this and this. You have to close your hands. Just going this way is not enough.\nThis is how you do it, you go this way and that. And left and right, not right and left, to cross\nyourself. So I did that. And I guess she thought, well if this kid were Jewish, he wouldn\u2019t be\ndoing that, you know. They have these -- these ideas, you know, that a Jew on penalty of death\nmaybe wouldn\u2019t cross himself, you know, because I [indecipherable] you know. But any rate, I\ndid that, and that was it, so she just let go. So that was, you know, another one of those incidents.\nSo I arrive in Warsaw on a beautiful, warm day. Big Warsaw railroad station. Big sign in\nGerman, wheels must turn for victory.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Oh yeah, that was a very common slogan. \u201cRader mussen rollen ftir den Sieg,\u201d you know.\nAnd then another big sign saying, \u201cDeutschlands Sieg an allen Fronten.\u201d Deutsch -- German\nvictory on all fronts. Okay? So I go out there, busy, busy Warsaw. And as I turn the corner, I see\nplacards, which I never saw before, in Polish. Any person hiding, harboring or abetting, or\nfacilitating a Jew is punishable by death. That was the first time that I ever saw this, I never saw\nthis in L\u2019vov. I guess they wa -- didn\u2019t need the -- the -- you know, it was to [indecipherable |\nthere, you know. So that was -- that\u2019s the way I -- that was my greeting in Warsaw just -- just as\nsoon as I turned the corner, without any backpack and so forth. And I knocked on the door of the\nZarembas and of course they took me in. And they knew I was coming. And I stayed with the\nZarembas for about two or three days. And I didn\u2019t know what to expect. But there\u2019s one thing I\ndid instinctively. I gave them the gold coin. Because it crossed my mind that I couldn\u2019t do\nanything with it, and it -- I -- it crossed my mind that my father probably did that on purpose, he\ndidn\u2019t tell me to do that, to give them -- give him the gold coin, maybe in payment or -- or just --\njust to reward him for the fact that he took it upon himself for me to -- to see him, you know, to -\n- because after all, it was very dangerous you know, for anybody to -- you know, this Mr.\nZaremba, his wife was -- was known as a Volksdeutscher. Now, do you know what that 1s?",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you explain it?",
        "A: Volksdeutscher was a category that the Germans established for any Poles that had German\nancestry, that had any kind of German ca -- German -- in their blood, so to speak. So they were\nkind of folk Germans. They were given special privileges, status, you know, preferential work\nand all that. So she was a Volksdeutscher and they often had German visitors because of that.\nSometimes army people, military. It seems to me -- and I was never told this -- that they were a\nlittle bit concerned about me, since people that they knew they had no children. All of a sudden,\nwho 1s this kid? What\u2019s this kid doing here? I don\u2019t know for sure, but Zaremba had a plan for\nme, and within about three or four days, he introduced me to a new life in Warsaw.",
        "Q: All right, that\u2019s a perfect ending for this part of the tape. We\u2019ll move on to the next tape.\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: Michael, I want to go back a little bit. First of all, how easy was it for you to find the house of\nthe Zarembas\u201d?",
        "A: Wasn\u2019t very hard. Th-They lived right near the railroad station, and Ij -- I just asked\nsomebody, you know, in the street as to where it is and they just pointed it out to me and so forth.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Because I didn\u2019t have any luggage with me, and so I was like a kid, maybe they thought I was\non an errand, or I was --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- picking something up, whatever, you know. So I went to the Zaremba, fortunately they\nwere home, you know, I knocked on the door and there they were.",
        "Q: And were they warm people, were they --",
        "A: They were friend -- oh yes, they were very nice, very warm people. Of course, Zaremba knew\nmy father, she -- she met me -- his wife met me for the first time --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- she was really nice. They had no children, and they had German visitors in uniform and\n[indecipherable] and of course Zaremba took advantage of this by, you know, doing all kinds of\nblack marketeering and stuff. But I don\u2019t f -- I didn\u2019t feel that comfortable. I wa -- not so much I\nwas af -- afraid, it\u2019s just the proximity of them, you know, really bothered me. I -- I just didn\u2019t\nwant to -- didn\u2019t want to be in the same room, you know, as it were, you know, and all this, with\ntheir -- you know, drinking and talking and then the -- all that, you know, and so forth. And\nenjoying their victories, you know, and the -- and the -- etcetera. So --",
        "Q: Did they talk about what was going on with Jews?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did they say anything about that?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t.",
        "A: No, I -- I -- I [indecipherable] I did knew German quite well, you know, even though I was a\nkid, which be -- which will be interesting comment Ill make later on about -- about how I had to\ncurtail my German. But -- so about -- oh, about three days or four days, he took me to this place\nwhich was a workshop, a little plant by the name of Boleslaw Konarski, I mention the address,\nand I'll spell it later. And introduced me as a distant relative\u2019s son, a half-orphan from the\nprovince of Tarnopol -- cause that\u2019s where my birth certificate, and he knew about the birth\ncertificate -- who wants to learn a trade. Who wants to learn a trade, you know. Now it was very\ncommon to have orphans or kids that didn\u2019t go to high school to learn a trade. And the way it\nworked was that you actually lived on the premises, you ate and slept on the premises, and you\nworked on the premises. And I slept on a loft with a couple of other kids about my age, and I was\nput to work. Now, Polish which was perfect was a L\u2019vov Polish. And the L\u2019vov Polish dialect\nwas very much divided by the Warsaw people. It was sort of analogous to let\u2019s say a Chicago\nEnglish versus Brooklyn English, okay? With Warsaw English being clipped, sort of you know,\nshort and clipped, whereas as you know the Brooklyn is the singsong and all those yishes, and all\nthat. So they kind of identified almost the -- the L\u2019vov Polish with Jews, with Jewish Poles. And\nI caught this right away, they -- where they kind of started to kind of laugh at me, you know,\nthey -- there\u2019s some jokes about that in Polish about the -- about the L\u2019vov dialect. And this was\na dialect spoken not only by -- by, you know, lower classes, was just a -- a typical, you know,\neven -- even in the -- you know, in New York, a good New York English is not like a -- like a\nMidwestern English, even -- even the -- you know, among the intellectuals. So I had to quickly\nlearn the Warsaw dialect. I was very conscious of that, I was very concerned because I knew I\nwou -- I was afraid that they may question that, that I may have -- you know. And my biggest,\nbiggest problem was again being circumcised. That preyed on my mind virtually 24 hours a day,\nbecause when you live with young -- wa -- other boys, you know, and you associate with them,\nand you -- and you -- and you there, you know, boys tend to play games, you know. They\u2019d hi --\nsometimes they compare anatomies, you know, and all that. And I was very, very concerned\nabout that because the minute that would happen, you know, I -- I often thought to myself, what\nwould they do if they were to discover -- what would they -- what would they do. And I didn\u2019t\nthink that they would inform on me because they were very, very pate -- you know, Poles were\nvery anti-German. But they would definitely kick me out, you know. I mean, they would not kick\nme, because I mean, they could be all killed for that, you know. Or maybe some of them --\nmaybe some of the, you know, workers would actually maybe even inform on me, because we\nlived in this place where there were -- at first there were three apprentices, and there were four\njourneymen as they called them. These are the foremen, the journeymen, th-the ones that the --\nthat they knew their trade and all that. And was hard to tell among them, who -- who would be,\nyou know, who would be the one that would actually -- would actually denounce me or -- to the -\n- to the authorities being Jewish. So that was constantly on my mind, and I was very concerned\nabout that. And fortunately I -- I -- we never got into that. You know, I ended up with -- with\nonly one. There were two more boys, and there was one -- one apprentice by the name of Janek.\nAnd he was kind of, you know, h-he -- he -- he was a little bit of a -- how shall I say? Quiet and -\n- and not so outgoing. So I -- we never had occasion to [indecipherable]. We slept in the same --\non the same loft, and -- and we worked, you know. And the -- the place of work -- what they\nmanufactured there, or manufactured was rawhide harnesses for the utility workers on -- on\npoles, you know, they climbed the poles. Rawhide harnesses. Was very, very hard work, you\nknow, to si -- you had to sew it by hand. They were -- they used underarm holsters for the secret\npolice. That was one of the jobs too, that they had to -- to -- to work on. All kinds of bags, and\nwallets and this kind of stuff, okay. The owners lived on the sa -- everything was on one level,\nyou know, the owners, their qua -- you know, their bedroom, their workshop and everything was\non the same level. And not too long after I started there, because of my age, 13 years old, I was\ngoing to be 14 in the fall, there was a law that you had to get a Kennkarte. A Kennkarte means in\nGerman -- Kenn is to know, and karte was like ai -- I.D. na -- I.D. card, okay? And you had to\ngo to the local authorities to pick it up, to the police, to the Gestapo, you know. So what do you\ndo now? I had no choice, I had to go. I couldn\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t -- I\u2019m not going to go. I didn\u2019t\nknow what they were doing there, whether they had suspi -- you know, whether they were\nscreening people for the -- for the -- for the -- and I went. I showed them my birth certificate, I\ntold them I was working for the firm of Boleslaw Konarski. Boom, I got a Kennkarte. So here I\nwas officially now an official Aryan. No phony, no, no, you know [indecipherable] I was\nofficially an Aryan, no more Jewish, you know, right? Except for my anatomy I was no more\nJewish. And living in Warsaw at that time, I encountered a number of things -- that was even\nbefore -- before the following year, before the ghetto. In other words, when you\u2019re on the streets\nof Warsaw -- after work, you know, I and this kid, we were just roaming around, you know, and\nso forth. They had these -- the police was walking down the street and they would periodically\nstop people and ask for I.D.s and round-ups. And what they were looking for basically is\nundocumented Poles. They were looking also for resistance because Warsaw already had a\nstrong resistance movement at that time. And of course they\u2019re looking for Jews, or people that\nwere trying to escape, Jews who tried to -- to -- to escape from the ghetto, who were -- were out\nof the ghetto. And what they would do is -- oh, and incidentally, in addition to those placards\nwhich said harboring a Jew, you know, is -- 1-it would be death penalty, they had placards\nshowing how to identify a Jew. And they were showing -- presumably that was all developed by\n-- by this -- I think it was Rosenberg was the German guy who pr -- who apparently claimed that\nthere are certain anatomical features in the Jewish face which are 100 percent Jewish, okay? By\nvirtue of the shape of the nose, by virtue of the shape of the ears. By some bone structure, by the\ncranial structure, whatever it was, with very elaborate charts, you know, as to how to identify the\nJews. And that was done in Polish, so that Poles who were inclined to do so, you know, would be\n-- or Ukrainians, whoever it was -- and there were a lot of Estonians and Latvians too at that\ntime, cause they were the guards of the -- many of them were guards of the ghetto, would be able\nto identify a Jew and maybe report him to the -- to the Germans, who would be very grateful for\nit, \u2019m sure, you know. So that was another thing. So what they would do 1s as they were walking\ndown the streets, and they were -- have these quick round-ups. If the -- 1f somebody looks\nsuspicious, you know, a -- a male, of course, they would take him around the corner and let him\ndrop his pants, you know, to check to see whether he was circumcised. Now circumcision was\nlike a hundred percent giveaway in Poland, which is very hard to understand here, because I\nmean we know that -- and I -- I-I know the trend today is maybe not to do it as much, but I know\nthat virtually -- and especially the United States, I mean, mer -- many hun -- millions of men are\ncircumcised, of whatever background, wha -- you know, right? Whether it\u2019s Muslim or ca -- or\nCatholic, Protestant and so forth. In Poland, this was not done. In fact, I remember hearing a\nstory that if someone who was not Jewish was circumcised, had to have some iron proof\ndocumentation that for medical reasons, and whatever -- I don\u2019t know whether that person, you\nknow, ever -- how he -- how they -- they managed to sur -- to -- to live, you know, to have -- to\nprove that -- that he was not Jewish, because that was -- they would -- there was no questions\nasked, you know. I mean, that was it. Was kind of ironical. In fact, in fact, I heard of cases where\nsome Jewish men tried to go through surgery to create some kind of false foreskin, or enlarge the\nskin, which always failed, you know, in order to hide the fact they were circumcised. You may\nhave heard about that. So that was another fact, and now come April 1943, the ghetto uprising in\nWarsaw. And I was not far from the ghetto in terms of -- of being able to actually see the smoke\nand the shooting. And sometimes I would see a column of me -- of people, of Jews from the\nghetto being marched out for -- obviously to be taken somewhere to a transport, to a\nconcentration camp. And I believe that lasted for about three or four, three weeks or so, when the\nghetto was obviously destroyed, and -- and that wa -- that made a tremendous impact on me, I\nmean I was -- I kind of felt helpless. I -- I felt -- that was when I really felt a sense of great guilt,\nthat here I was, you know, on the outside, you know, and I was getting away with it, and here\nwere these people [indecipherable] they were fighting for their lives and so forth, there was\nnothing I could do about it. I mean, I certainly wasn\u2019t brave enough, or thinking that I would just\nrun into the ghetto and join them, you know. That would have tote -- it would have been -- you\nknow, I mean I -- you had to try to survive, you know, and tha -- and that was my fortune that I\nwas able to be on the other side, even though not knowing what the next day would bring for me,\nyou know. So that was very bad, that was -- that was -- and we knew about it actually, you know,\nthat was known that it was a ghetto uprising, even though there wasn\u2019t much talked about it\nwhere I worked, you know. But peop -- that -- you know, there wa -- it was known that there was\nan uprising in the ghetto.",
        "Q: And did you hear things about the ghetto prior to the uprising, and about the deportations? I\nmean, by this time, is it clear to you that there are death camps, or you still don\u2019t know?",
        "A: Yes, I did know about it. I did know about a death camp of Auschwitz, because -- because the\nson of the ow -- well, the woman who was -- of the -- of the firm, she was a common law wife of\nthis -- this master of the shop. Her son was actually a Pole. He was in -- he was in Auschwitz for\na short while, they had a section for non-Jews, you know, near -- near ausch -- Auschwitz. And\nhe was -- he came back from Auschwitz, and he mentioned that Auschwitz was, you know, there\nwas a concentration camp in Auschwitz, and so on, so he did talk about that, about -- briefly\nabout his experiences. And he said, \u201cOh, there\u2019s a lot of Jews there, s -- they\u2019re getting all\nkilled,\u201d you know, but -- yeah.",
        "Q: And you believed this?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh absolutely.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Absolutely. But I didn\u2019t -- he -- he just mentioned that in general, you know. So I -- I knew, I\nknew. By that time I already knew -- knew about that there\u2019s a -- there was a concentration camp\nin Auschwitz.",
        "Q: And by this time, by April \u201943, you\u2019re in Warsaw for how long?",
        "A: Well, it was just about --",
        "Q: From the spring of \u201942.",
        "A: -- the spring of \u201942, yeah.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s almost a year?",
        "A: Almost a year, exactly, exactly, I was there.",
        "Q: Do you start feeling somewhat safer, or you continue --",
        "A: I felt safer in the sense that I was kind of established there.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know, that I was -- I was accepted, and of course I was -- I was part of that -- of that -- of\nthat ambience. I would go to church, you know, I -- I -- I -- my -- this kid who -- who was with\nme, Janek, you know, we learned how to skip confession, you know, when -- cause the woman,\nshe was very, very religious, so she was chase us out, you know, always to go to church on\nSunday. So we went in and out, you know, cause a kid was not interested. And when the time\nwas for confession we would go to the -- pretend like to the confession, we found a booth that\nwasn\u2019t occupied, so we pretended like we are at the -- you know, doing confe -- going into\nconfession, kneeling there, you know, and then after a little while, you know, cro -- go up, cross\nourselves, and -- and leave, you know. So -- so I was kind of accepted as part of the -- of that --\nof that working family, as it were. But -- but I was always, always, always concerned about\ndiscovery. I wa -- that was always on my mind. Why\u201d Because -- because there were the -- the\ncustomers who came in, there were a lot of secret police guys that came in to pick up holsters,\nthere were -- and -- and -- and they saw me working, you know, and all that. And you never\nknew who would kind of look at me and say wait a minute, this kid looks more like -- he must be\nJewish, or something like that. You know, or he looks Jewish, or -- even though I really didn\u2019t,\nyou know. But who knows, you know, I mean you -- you never knew that, what would happen.\nSo -- so I was -- there\u2019s always that -- that lingering concern, as it were, on my mind you know,\nand fear as well, that I may be discovered. But of course, I had a much easier time of it than --\nthan like -- than say my brother was in the -- in the camp, you know, so I was -- felt -- felt in\nsome ways fortunate that -- you know, that I was where I was, you know --",
        "Q: Were you ever in a situation where you came close -- someone came close to seeing that you\nwere circumcised?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. So you were very careful how you dressed and undressed --",
        "A: Careful how I dress and undress and all that, and don\u2019t forget I -- we never -- we never based\n[indecipherable] always had this -- you know there were just a -- just you wash your -- th-the\nlower part of your body didn\u2019t get much -- much sanitation as it were, you know. You just\nwashed the upper body, the feet or legs and this and that, so -- so I never -- th-there -- there was\nno -- there was no shower, you know, and then --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- or bath or anything like that. But -- but when I undress, sure, at night, dressi -- undressing\nand dressing, always -- because that was there, it was there, I -- I knew, I was aware of it, and --\nand there was no doubt about it, that --",
        "Q: And nobody questioned you that you were doing some -- you were dressing and undressing in\na way --",
        "A: Not at all, no --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- you see, that was why I had to learn to be very casual about it, you know, that\u2019s one of the\nthings that the -- the -- the survival instincts, I guess, teaches you. At the same time I had to\nbehave casually and at the same time in a guarded way, you know. And with ke -- you know, I\nlived on the -- you know, in -- in the loft there, and that was dark, you know, and we would\nclimb up the ladder and go to -- go to sleep. You know, you don\u2019t -- when you\u2019re young you\ndon\u2019t sleep tha -- you don\u2019t need that much sleep, so it was very late, usually in the evening, and\n-- and so forth, and I -- and then on Sundays we were free, and -- and I remember one incidence\nwhich reminds me that one of the friends of this -- this owner of the firm, by the name of\nBoleslaw Konarski was the owner, he -- she ran the business, only he was kind of a -- an\nalcoholic, you know, would go on two, three day binges, was away, you know. And then would\ncome back home with -- you know, with -- with no -- penniless and all that. And one of his\nfriends once came in, I believe, and he made a comment in Polish what really scared me. He\nsays, \u201cHe must be -- he must be part Jewish,\u201d to this Boleslaw Konarski. Just like that. He 1s\nfrom a Jew, in Polish, he said. [indecipherable] he must be somewhat from a Jew. He didn\u2019t say I\nwas Jewish, but maybe from a Jew. And then Boleslaw said, oh come on, no, no. Do not be\nridiculous. Something like that. That was the end of that. That was another true incident. I still\nremember the way the words that he used. I think he is a little bit of a -- from a Jew. But other\nthan that -- and then -- so these sights in Warsaw were very, very, very bad, you know, they --\nthey -- they -- this whole idea of a -- of -- just constant round-ups of people. But life went on,\nyou know, and Warsaw is a very, very busy city. And then I befriended a family who are\nrelatives of the owner of this -- of this -- of this pl -- workshop. There was a family of four\ndaughters living ap -- in a small, little village outside of Warsaw, on the other side of the Vistula,\non the roo -- east bank of the Vistula, near Praga. Praga was basically part of Warsaw, it was --\nit\u2019s called Praga, not Prague, Czechoslovakia, Praga. Was like part of the Warsaw, but that was\ncalled Praga, which was the -- was one side of the -- of the river. And there was one -- one of the\ndaughters who I was very smitten with, she was about two, three years older.",
        "Q: This is Danka?",
        "A: Danka, Danielle, Danka, exactly. And -- and I guess that saved me -- saved my life, that my\nknowledge of Danka will save my life, too. Because I would visit them occasionally on -- on\nSundays I would go out there with the commuter railroad, maybe a 15 minute trip. And the\nfather, he was a carpenter, and there were four daughters. And I [indecipherable] I befriended her\nand we were very friendly and I was -- so I would stay there for the day, some days overnight\nand take a very early -- early commuter back into the city. And I think this was going on for\nabout maybe six, seven months and one weekend, one weekend -- not weekend, but it was a sun\n-- I think it was late Saturday maybe, I was able to get away. I was there, and the next day the\nPolish uprising broke out in Warsaw. Here I am again, no belongings, no clothing, just visiting\nthis family. No way to get back to Warsaw because it was the uprising, was the Polish uprising.\nWas a massive, massive uprising in August of 1944. Huge uprising. The city was just -- I mean,\noh my God, I mean it was tremendous -- you could actually hear it, even 10 - 12 miles away, you\ncould hear the explosion and -- and so forth. And the Russians were not -- nearby. They weren\u2019t\nvery far at all. Now as you know, what happened in the Polish uprising was that it lasted for\nabout two months. It was totally destroyed. Warsaw the city was destroyed. The population was\nevacuated. And if I had stayed in Warsaw, who knows what would have happened? I would have\nmaybe run into the same business of being taken somewhere and wo -- to a work camp, maybe\ngoing to another bathhouse, or who the hell knows what, you know. Or killed maybe in the\nuprising itself, cause it was a very massive uprising. Tens of thousands you know, of -- of\nunderground force there. But we were just observers from th -- you know, from the suburbs, as --\nyou know. And this co -- this oh -- this -- this father of that family, by the name of Bozym was\nhis last name, B-o-z - dot - y-m, Bozym. There was an field artillery unit, a German field artillery\nunit camped right in that little village up the hill to [indecipherable] farm. You know, what they\nwould do, they would just -- wherever they want they just took over a farm, killed the -- the --\nyou know, confiscated the -- the -- the -- the livestock you know, and butchered it for their own\nuse, and so on. So they a -- took over the farm. And Mr. Bozym was a [indecipherable] that was\nlooking for work obviously, to do something, and that field artillery unit needed some repairs to\nbe made on their -- some of their storage equipment, whatever it was. And he took with me as an\nassistant, an apprentice. Not apprentice, but an assistant. So we worked there for a few days\nwhile this was still going on in Warsaw. And we worked a circular saw. Equipment was very\nrusty. There was no guard on the circular saw at all. And I had a narrow piece of wood which I\nwas trying to cut and I cut off half of my finger on it. Okay? And the blade clo -- was so close to\nthis, I almost lost a second finger, too. Cut my finger and I was bleeding. So the German who\nwas in charge, the staff -- staff sergeant there, grabbed one of -- grabbed a -- a car, and took me -\n- and they asked one of the s-soldiers there to take me to the field hospital, which was only about\nmaybe a mile away, th-the German field hospital, because that finger was still hanging on it, you\nknow, it wasn\u2019t cut off completely, just hanging, just by the skin. So here I am in the German\nfield hospital with all these wounded from the f -- the front was nearby -- wounded, and I was\nsitting there waiting cause there were m -- there were priorities, you know, there were people\nwith li -- you know, all kinds of, you know, with -- with si -- major operations and all that, and I\nwas waiting my turn. So they looked at me, they grabbed me because this German said, well this\nis a Polish worker that worked those -- and they cut off the rest of that finger, and they dropped\nmy pants because they gave me a shot. You know, it was a form of either antibiotic, or\nsomething, for just a minute. And I was turned away from the guy who gave me the shot, you\nknow, just on that side. And here I am again, exposed, you know. Is somebody watching over\nme? I don\u2019t believe it. Somebody else might be -- feel that way. At any rate -- so I was all\nbandaged up, you know, and went back. And -- and this was something that\u2019s very, very hard to\nbelieve, but when I went back, and I reported back to the -- that -- to th-that German place, this\nguy asked me to wait. He was the -- the -- his name was Gabe Reuter -- Gabe Reuter.\n[indecipherable] meister Gabe Reuter. He was a field artillery staff commandant. And he gave\nme this piece of paper. Of course, I st -- I knew German. And I'll translate for you that piece of\npaper and you won\u2019t believe what it says. It said in it, the Polish worker Mieczyslaw\nWereszczyszyn was injured while working for our unit, and he intends after his recovery, to join\nthe German army as a -- as a volunteer. As a volunteer. Now here [indecipherable] nice Jewish\nkid from -- from L\u2019vov, you know, volunteering into the German army, right? Now he did that as\na big favor to me, because he felt by having this piece of paper, I will be able to get some, you\nknow, privileges, you know, I would maybe get some bread or something. He was -- he just tha -\n- totally on his own. I certainly wouldn\u2019t have asked him for it. Would never even occurred to\nme. I didn\u2019t even know there was such a thing as being able to volunteer into the German army,\nbut maybe by that time they were desperate for volunteers because, you know, the front was\nmoving, they were moving, moving, moving, you know, west. So here I have this document,\nnow -- now I\u2019m a real, true Aryan with a -- with a -- with a Kennkarte, you know, and on top of\nthat, I have this document that says here is a live wire for the German army, you know. And\nactually th-that did help me. I was able to get some bread from some of the German youths,\ncause we were scrounging for food, and I would show it, and I -- and I wore this for a long, long\ntime, even after I was healed pretty much, I still wore this, you know, in a kind of, you know, in\na sling, as a -- you know, right? And I actually helped the family, you know, that they -- the --\nthe family, because I was able to get some bread, and etcetera. So that was my -- my injury, as it\nwere, you know, and fortunately I didn\u2019t get an infection because, you know, with the bandages\nand so here I am as a -- so that was ano -- another close call that I had.",

        "A: Oh yeah, I felt grown up, sure I did.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I -- I certainly did. And -- and the interesting part too, speaking I -- I made a --\nallusions to German, my German language. I learned how to speak a broken German Polish, you\nknow, just -- in other words, I -- just throwing in a word of German here and there, which was\nknown that some kids would learn German in public school. So instead of really speaking\nGerman the way I knew German, since I also lived in Danzig, you may recall, I would kind of\nspeak a broken [indecipherable] German, which helped me also to get some bread, you know,\nfrom the Germans or some food when I had my -- my paper as a vol -- as a future volunteer, you\nknow, in German army. So that was also kind of -- I -- I kind of thought that was really funny in\nsome times, because here I am trying to speak, straining to speak German, you know, a few\nwords here and there, to ingratiate myself so I could, you know, get some food. But then of\ncourse, trouble began again because the front was approaching. Now, you may recall that the\nRussians deliberately stopped on the outskirts of Praga because the Warsaw uprising was not\nsponsored by the Communist Polish exiled regime, by the London regime, okay? Which was --\nwhich was the -- the -- th-the other side. So they decided, and it\u2019s, I think, historically\ndocumented, to let the Poles kill themselves, you know, before they had their own Polish army,\nwhich is part of the Russian army, take Warsaw. And of course, that was a complete catastrophe,\ndisaster because of course the -- the Polish uprising finally failed, and the Germans regained, you\nknow, the -- the -- the front and so forth. And while the uprising was finished by -- perhaps by\nbeginning of October, started in August, the -- the pol -- the -- the -- the Russians began to\nadvance towards the Vistula River, and we had to leave, you know, they had to evacuate all the\ncivilian population. And that\u2019s why really tough times started, too. That was another period of\ngreat hunger for us, because we crossed the -- we had to cross the river, into -- onto the other\nside, you know, because the Russian was -- were advancing. And that was still during the\nuprising it\u2019s se -- that happen, because the Russians were moving -- inching up. And I remember\nlike today, we are walking through a field and all of a sudden we saw these thousands of\nparachutes, what looked like thousands of parachutes, which was one of those big drops that the\nallied -- you know, the Americans dropped on Warsaw. And as you know, 90 percent or more of\nit fell into the German hands. That was one of those terrible, terrible blunders, you know, of the -\n- of the -- of this whole operation. And wa -- where the -- where the Polish resistance hoped to\nget all of that -- all these ammunition supplies and the Germans got all pri -- virtually all of it.\nAnd actually, we were wal -- as we were walking, we saw th -- the sky was almost dark. There\nmust have been thousands of these drop -- of the parachutes coming down. So that was one --\nanother experience. And -- and then we tried to walk from one village to another village, trying\nto get some food, we were hungry. In fact, I w -- the one episode is where we actually -- I slept\non the cemetery, you know, on the na -- on the graves, you know, because we had no other place\nto sleep. It was cold. And -- and that was a very tough time. We were very, very -- we had no\nfood. We maybe ate once a day. Sometimes we would eat some -- some potatoes and -- and then\n-- and cucumbers there was [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And you were with Danka and her family [indecipherable]",
        "A: I was with the family, right, right. The -- there was -- there was Danka and her sister --\nyounger sister. The two oldest sisters went away and they -- they -- they went separately\nsomewhere. And there were there just the parents and the -- and the two sisters and myself. And\nthere were other families, you know, sometimes we went a group together. And sometimes the --\nthe -- the local farmers would take pity on us and let us sleep in the barn, you know, and there\nwas no food, and -- and -- and I remember where there was a cow, soon enough the Germans\ncame and took away the farmer\u2019s cow, you know, so there was no -- no milk, and -- and no food,\nso it was very, very tough. And that lasted through that period of -- of -- of December and\nJanuary, just the begin -- towards the end of December, and one night we wake up and who do\nwe see? Russians, on their trucks, you know? Then I said to myself, okay, I\u2019m alive. I made it. I\nmade it. January 1945 is when Warsaw is liberated, finally, after being totally wiped out. And I\nnever told the family that I was Jewish, but I did tell Danka that I was. And she wasn\u2019t shocked.\nWas surpri -- I would never -- she may have been s-surprised. But I soon realized that actually\nthis was not a -- a true lang -- lasting romance. You know, she was older than I, and what was\ninfatuation was not really a -- a real -- something that it was going to last, even though I would, if\nshe were willing, I probably would have want it to last, maybe, at -- at that time, anyway. And --\nand there were different Russians from the Russians that were, you know, retreating in -- in\n1941, I mean, those were victorious Russians. And they were trying to give out food, and finally\ngot -- we got some food from the -- from one of the -- some of the Russians, they were friendly.\nThey could -- they recognized right away the -- what the -- they didn\u2019t know whether they were\nJews, necessary, but they -- they could see they\u2019re -- they\u2019re refugees and just hungry, starving\npeople, and all that. So -- so that\u2019s how -- how I ended being Mieczyslaw Wereszczyszyn.",
        "Q: And became Mundek --",
        "A: And became Mundek Wertman again, you know, later on.",
        "Q: But you had no papers to say that you were Wertman.",
        "A: I had no papers. I had no papers. They had to take my word for it, the Jewish authority,\nJewish agency, you know, had to take my word for it. My first notion was obviously to try to\nfind family. And the movement of the front was such that the -- there was constantly Russians\ndriving back and forth in their trucks, so forth. So I left the fam -- the -- the -- the Bozym family,\njumped on one of the trucks and just went east, you know. And my intention was to go to Lublin\nbecause L\u2019vov was already taken over by the Russians there, and they had a border, you know,\nthey -- they -- they did not let people in, so L\u2019vov became -- you know, they annexed L\u2019vov to\nthe -- to the Ukrainian Republic, even at that time they already established a -- a border. But I\nknew I had an uncle in Lublin, one of my father\u2019s brothers, who had a bakery. And of my\nfather\u2019s four brothers and a sister, I only knew two of the -- of his siblings. One was the uncle in\nLublin, and the other one was the sister on to -- Tomaszow, because when I was a little boy I\nwould visit her. The other three brothers I never met. And they were spread out, you know, in\ndifferent parts of Poland. And I remember checking into Lublin, and already at -- by that time --\nand it may have been weeks -- few weeks after, they already had some established now, the\nJewish agencies started to -- you know, to help out, you know, in establishing a registry of\nsurvivors. There was the HIAS, H-I-A-S, and the AJDC, you know, it [indecipherable] agency.\nAnd there was a registry and I went into this re -- first I was asking about my uncle and they said\nno, he 1s de -- he is -- he is not al -- he perished, you know, they didn\u2019t have any record of him.\nAnd then I checked with the registry and lo and behold I see my father\u2019s name. I see Genya\u2019s\nname, I see my brother\u2019s name, I see Helen\u2019s name and I see my cousin\u2019s name, my -- my -- you\nknow, my cousin\u2019s. I just couldn\u2019t believe it. I thought maybe this was registry of the dead, not\nof the living. And they had an address there, and I went there and sure enough, there was Genya,\nand there\u2019s Helen. And my father wasn\u2019t in on that day. And that was the first time that I took a\nreal bath in I don\u2019t know how many years, three years, four years, a real bath, because I was\nreally dirty. And -- and then I found out the story as to how my father survived, and how my\nbrother survived. And I didn\u2019t know anything about my mother. There was no -- no -- no record\nof it until -- much later I found out what happened to her. And the way my father survived was\nthat before the ghetto closed in July, I believe -- in June, I believe, in 1943, when the ghetto was\nclosed, just before it closed, my father arranged with a Polish vegetable gardener to be hidden.\nAnd of course he paid them money for it. But he had some money stashed away, he would pay\nmonthly because he was afraid to give him up front because the guy would probably spend it and\n-- you know, and so forth. And for 18 months my father didn\u2019t see the sun, the daylight. He was\nhidden there with Genya, Helen was given away, and with that cousin, with this Chana Koch, in\na small area, was like a cubicle. And was given food maybe like once a day or something. The\ngardener would bring food. And in that same building there were German railroad workers that\nactually lived in that building. And they were separated just by a very thin wall from the places\nwhere the German railroas -- railroad workers would congregate and -- you know, and have fun\nand have their -- their drinking parties and all kinds of things. So he had to keep very, very quiet\nwhen the workers were there. There was no sanitation, there was no toilet. They just -- whatever\nwater they could get, they would use that, and -- so -- so they ha -- instead of using -- using a\ntoilet, you use something else and then get rid of it at night, da -- in the dark of night. My brother\nGeorge was fortunate he was able to live outside the camp itself because he was on a steamroller\nthat I mentioned before, working it. But towards the end of the -- he knew what was going on\nbecause he was outside, so he could hear the -- what they were talking about, th-the guards and\nthe -- the Germans and the Ukrainians. He knew that the camp was going to be liquidated. And\nhe happened to know where my father was hidden because one of my father\u2019s friends, who had\nhappened to be a Ukrainian, had some contacts [indecipherable] in the camp, you know, and he\nwas -- communicated with him, so he knew where my father was. And on the night that he was\ngoing to be -- when the camp was liquidated they were taking -- he escaped from the caboose of\nthat steamroller while the Germans were waiting outside, asking to get dressed, he escaped\nthrough a rear little window -- it\u2019s on -- on -- it\u2019s on his tape -- and ran away and hid, you know,\nfor a couple nights, and joined my father -- was able to join my father in that hiding place. And\nhe was with my father for a full year, until liberation. And the -- and -- and wa -- L\u2019 vov was\nliberated, I believe in July of \u201945. No, not in July of \u201945, I\u2019m sorry, no, no, I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m\nwrong, cause the war ended in May of 1944. It was liberated I think it was in -- if I\u2019m not\nmistaken it must have been in the -- I have it written down. I think in July of \u201944, possibly, \u00b044.\nHe -- so they -- that was a very tough time for them, but they managed to survive in this hiding\nplace. And -- and what happened is they moved to -- to -- to Lublin, my father, you know, moved\nto -- moved to Lublin after -- after the -- the liberation, and established himself there -- tried to\nestablish himself there. And one of my cousins, who was a partisan in one of the forests of --\nnear Lublin, which was not far from Tarnogrod when my mother was there, he knew that my\nmother died in a -- in a mass shooting, liquidating the small remnant of that Jewish community in\n1943. 1943. She worked as a nurse, apparently and then that -- so that\u2019s how I found out, cause\nhe was one of the survivors, too.",
        "Q: And you found this out within a year or so?",
        "A: Right, yeah. These were very chaotic times and -- a-and just -- just -- just th-the remnants of\nthe survivors and the chaos and the -- and the -- trying to find survivors, trying to look for\nsurvivors and -- and as I said before, you know, my father had four brothers. They all were\nmarried, had children, and for the -- the two cousins, one cousin my father\u2019s brother\u2019s son, and\nthey -- my father\u2019s sister\u2019s daughter were the only two other of the family that acta -- that s --\nthat survived of my father\u2019s family. So -- so that was -- you know, of course, we all looked bad,\nyou know, kind of emaciated and -- but fortunately not in terribly bad health at all, you know,\nsomehow. And when I heard of my mother\u2019s death, you know, that was very hard for me. I was\nreally -- it\u2019s kind of a -- hit me very hard. Especially in the light of the fact that 1f she had stayed\nwith my father, if my father didn\u2019t divorce her, because he did it, she would have survived. You\nalways think about that, you know. And she was so young, 38 years old, you know. She was very\ngood to me. Bright, intelligent. Very socially aware. My father accused her of being a Socialist,\nwhich was -- was the strongest insult he could use, you know, cause he was obviously not. And\nshe st -- he always accused her of being too free thinking. Too -- too -- too sympathetic to the --\nto the strikers, to the laborers, you know, to the workers, and all that. So -- so that was very bad.\nThat was a bitter pill, especially in the light of our very bad relations with the stepmother, you\nknow, it was -- it was very, very bad. That has caused me a lot of anguish. And you never forget\nthat, you know. And on the top of it all, after many years when my father separated from Genya,\nand they didn\u2019t live -- for [indecipherable] years they were separated, he would say, \u201cIf I could\nonly bring your mother back alive.\u201d And you know, I mean that was, you know, if I could only\ndo that. So, after so many years he had regrets, as it were, you know. So it was -- it was pretty\nhard. But -- but it\u2019s ancient history now. Maybe not so ancient for those who still remember it.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: Not at all? Not nasty comments, not too bad at what\u2019s happened, nothing?",
        "A: Nothing. The -- the people that I lived with in Warsaw and worked with, were basically very\nstaunch Polish Nationalists. You know, they -- they -- they really hated the Germans. And maybe\nbecause of that, they took a sort of a stand of they didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t ex -- they didn\u2019t want to\nexpress any anti-Semitic feelings, even though they may have harbored them. But I did not hear\nanything really negative per se at all about -- about Jews. In fact, nothing was said about Jews at\n-- at -- in -- in -- during our th -- there was no remarks made, or cracks made about -- about the\nJews. I don\u2019t know whether I was -- whether the Poles in Warsaw perhaps were more -- more\nworldly in a sense, in general, as opposed to maybe L\u2019vov, which was so heavily uk -- Ukrainian\nand Polish and all this strife and all this constant turmoil. Warsaw was more homogenous in\nterms of the Polish population. Maybe more sophisticated, I don\u2019t know. But I know that -- and I\ndidn\u2019t hear this, so it\u2019s not a direct answer to your question, but -- but during the -- the Jewish\nuprising, there was some help given to the -- to the Jewish aba -- by the Poles. So there was some\ncontacts made with the Polish underground, per se. And I was not aware that the Poles actually\nhelped at all, the Germans to fight the Jewish ghetto, you know. Unlike in L\u2019vov, for example,\nwhere -- where there were just volunteers galore, you know, to -- to help to enter the ghetto. In\nfact, the -- the guards of the -- of the Jewish ghetto were actually Estonian and Latvians, many of\nthem, which I don\u2019t know whether this is well known. And the reason for it being is that the\nLatvian and Estonians and Lithuanians had great hopes for having independent -- you know,\nwant to be independent of Russia, you know, they always been an -- you know, under the\nRussian thumb, as it were, you know, and so maybe that -- somehow they felt that that would be\nsome way of -- of maybe getting Germans to give them some independence. In the same ways\nthe Ukrainians were hoping that they were -- that the Germans would give them a -- a country --\na statehood, or a bas -- or some kind of independence, some kind of autonomy. But they were,\nand they were [indecipherable] ferocious, you know, from -- so -- so I think perhaps in general,\nmaybe -- and I don\u2019t know whether this is a fact, this 1s only my -- my -- my -- my impression,\nbecause I didn\u2019t hear any overt anti-Semitism within my immediate surrounding, perhaps this\nwas maybe typical of -- of other urban Warsaw people, you know, of the -- of the urban people,\nthe people who live in Warsaw itself. Now that is just supposition at this point.",

        "A: I would see -- I would see it just walking down the street, you know, I could see it from a\ndistance.

And that I said -- oh, I did see once a column of people being\nmarched away, nearby. I don\u2019t know where I was there, maybe I was getting closer because I\nwas curious. But I never was actually close enough to actually see the ghetto wall, per se, or be\nclose enough because I -- I didn\u2019t want to do that, I was scared, really, to -- to get too close to it,\nyou know.

And it was hard work, too.

I had to keep in line, just do my --my work and -- and try to be modest about it, and -\n- not that I was necessarily that skilled, but I mean, I -- I learned. You know, I -- I applied myself\nto it, in fact, probably more than maybe the other kid because I wanted to -- to do a good job, you\nknow, so they would keep me instead of kicking me out and saying go back to Zaremba, you\nknow, we don\u2019t want you. Which could have happened any time. Or if they didn\u2019t have enough\nwork, they may have just said, hey go.

Now what kind of a life are we going to\nhave now? We knew we couldn\u2019t establish ourselves and we couldn\u2019t get jobs, there was no jobs.\nI mean, a lot of the Poles who were forced labor, Poles themselves, were just coming back to\ntheir own homes, trying to recover their own things, you know? I mean, you couldn\u2019t -- there\nwas no jobs available. And -- and in some ways there 1s also a feeling of resentment if not\noutright hostility by some of the Polish people, who many of them suffered too, of course not --\nnot like the Jews, who -- who were -- in some ways there was some jealousy too, because they --\nthe Jews were getting help. The Jews were getting American money from the Jewish agencies\nand so forth, you know, so -- so they weren\u2019t hung -- they weren\u2019t hungry, I mean they were\ngetting money, they could get some food and they were helped and all that, you know? So that in\nitself created frictions and tensions which later resulted as you know in -- in outbreaks of -- of\nanti-Semitism and -- and -- and killings and so forth. So -- so it isn\u2019t like the Jews who survived\nfelt welcome, or felt -- they didn\u2019t feel any different in some ways than way before, you know,\nalthough there wasn\u2019t any of that overt antise -- anti-Semitism, it certainly wasn\u2019t a welcoming\nplace. It wasn\u2019t like coming back home.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: There was no home.",
        "Q: There was no home.",
        "A: There was no home. And there was no place to go really, you didn\u2019t know what to do with\nyourself, until you began to think about emigration, you know, until you begin make contacts\nwith the -- with -- with the -- you know, with the Canada, America, Australia, you know. You\ncouldn\u2019t go to Israel because until 1948 Israel was not a state. As we mentioned before, you\nknow, the -- the -- the -- the British had a embargo, you know, and they were constantly\ncapturing these boats, you know, and -- and putting them to -- into internment camps in Cyprus\nand others. Now who wanted to go back into a ghetto again, into a camp, you know? And even\nthough in the internment camp was obviously not a ghetto, there weren\u2019t -- but still, you know,\nyou -- you -- your -- your freedom was gone again. So many of the Jews, like in Poland, didn\u2019t --\ndidn\u2019t want to go, didn\u2019t want to take that -- that risk. You didn\u2019t feel like going there. You\nwanted to be free. You wanted to -- to -- to -- to -- to recapture some of that loss, you know. I\nnever went to high school. I never experienced a high school life and the high school sports. My\neducation stopped at the grade six or f-five and a half. I had no education, no high school. I\ndidn\u2019t -- you know, it -- all I was 1s just ap -- an apprentice for a few years, so I didn\u2019t have all\nthat experience. So I had no skills, per se. I mean, I certainly wasn\u2019t going to work in a leather\nshop, and then what leather shop would -- would even take me? There was -- you know, I mean,\nthere was a -- there was no need for my skills. So -- so there was like an emptiness, you know,\nreally. And -- and at the same feeling of sort of a carefree thing, you know, from one day to the\nnext, you know, you felt like. So as a result, people are roaming around. They were going --\ngoing -- get on trains, traveling, going places, you know, hoping to find something there,\nsomething here and -- and in fact George and I ended up in Romania, you know, we thought we\nmaybe going towards -- towards Palestine, trying to maybe get there. We still thought maybe\nthere was a way of -- of doing it. And by the time we reached Romania we -- we -- we couldn\u2019t\ngo any farther, they -- they wouldn\u2019t let us go -- go through, we couldn\u2019t get to Greece, so -- so\nafter -- for a few months of traveling and [indecipherable] we finally end up going back to\nPoland, cause at that time there was no -- we couldn\u2019t -- there was no emigration as yet, it wasn\u2019t\nall set up yet, 1t was chaos. Just think about trying to reconstruct these things, you know, trying\nto get people together. And so we ended up in the -- in the western part of Poland, which is\noriginally German, you know when -- you know the deal that was made by Churchill, Roosevelt\nand Stalin. They gave eastern Poland to Russia, to Soviet Russia and they took away part of the\nwestern Poland -- western Poland -- I mean eastern Germany, including Danzig to the Germans.\nSo these were sort of the new territories, and we had hoped maybe could establish ourselves for\nawhile there. So we ended up in -- in Leignitz, Legnica Leignitz which is one a -- which is a\ntown in the -- in that part of Poland and try to -- to maybe open a store or something, trying to\nmake a living there. So -- but that -- for awhile, that didn\u2019t last very long either. And in the\nmeantime my father ended up in Munich, Germany, 1946, and Germany become the major,\nmajor staging area for emigration. All the DP camps, displaced person camps were all\nestablished in a lot of Germany, Munich and other places and so forth. And that\u2019s where he\neventually ended up. And I got there in 1947. And end up and then I -- it was another stage in my\nlife there, you know, as a DP in Germany for about three years.",

        "A: Seven.",
        "Q: -- seven. And you\u2019re 19 years old.",
        "A: Right. Okay, I came to Munich and my father was already there with Genya and Helen. And\nmy brother married since then.",
        "Q: That was fast.",
        "A: He found -- yeah, he found his spouse and still while they were in Poland, and he actually con\n-- made contact with her in Romania. And her name was Frieda, they\u2019re still married to this very\nday. And so he was there, too, and then I arrived, and I took a little room in [indecipherable] of\nthe apartments outside the DP camp. And my first interest was in trying to get some education.\nAnd I want to learn English, I want to learn French. So I had a pridis -- some private lessons, but\nof course I want to get a job, too. So I joined the international refugee organization, IRO, and I\nwas assigned to the desk where they handled hardship cases. Now hardship cases were --\nprimarily meant expectant mothers, you know, displaced person expectant mother, because they\nwere to be expedited sooner so that they would get to the -- wherever they were going, and have\ntheir babies there, instead of having them in the DP camp itself, where conditions weren\u2019t really\nthat good. I mean, they were -- they were fine, you know, but they were camps, basically refugee\ncamps. So I handled those cases too, tho -- mainly those cases and worked there and -- and then I\nbecame an allied civilian as a result of that, which gave me PX privileges. Now you know PX\nprivileges, at that time, for a -- for a boy like me, you know, from the -- from the ghetto, was a\nbig thing, because I was able to go to the PX and buy all the American, you know, goodies, you\nknow, the candies, and the -- and the cigarettes at that time, of course, too, you know, and -- and\nso forth. But at any rate, that was interesting work. And -- and of course the idea was to -- to\nemigrate, you know, obviously the -- living in Germany post-war was -- was -- it was not -- you\nknow, you -- you didn\u2019t feel comfortable. They -- there was still a time when a lot of the German\nprisoners of war were coming home, you know, they were recovering from the war. They were\nreleased, of course, much sooner than \u00b047, but they were still recovering and -- and there was a\nlot of shortages of food, you know, there were rations. And Munich was badly damaged in the\nwar too, so there was a lot of poverty around and -- and -- and of course, I spoke German well, so\nI had no trouble communicating. Wer -- you know, living quarters were very crowded, they were\ncrowded in with other German families. You had a room, and there were other German families\nin the other rooms, you know, in the same apartment, etcetera. But I enjoyed the work very\nmuch, you know. It gave me contact with the English speaking people because the people in\ncharge were Americans from the United States, from the agencies, from the IRO, from -- from\nHIAS and AJDC, which is the -- the a -- American Jewish --",

        "Q: So the IRO was an offshoot --",
        "A: Well, the IRO was sort of a -- I think it was a s -- was established -- I wonder whether that\nwas a United Nations agency possibly, but I think there was under also as as -- as in under the\nauspices or under some connection with the -- with the AJDC and -- and HIAS, but which\nhandles the Jewish part.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because the DPs were full of non-Jews as well. Those DP camps were not only Jews, they\nwere all kinds, there were Poles and -- and all kinds of nationalities, all -- all people that were\ndisplaced, you know, people that were displaced persons who -- who were in German work\ncamps or something and they didn\u2019t go back, you know, they wanted to emigrate. So -- so the\nIRO was more of a -- of an overall umbrella, as it were. And HIAS and the AJDC were kind of\naffiliated, or sister agencies that were working with the -- with the Jewish people, so I was --",
        "Q: Did you ge -- sorry.",
        "A: Sorry.",
        "Q: Did you get a salary?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: They paid you?",
        "A: Oh yes, I got -- well, that\u2019s how I got my money for the -- yeah --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- that was -- that was -- that was like my first paying job, you know, because I didn\u2019t get\nmuch money when I was an apprentice.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Maybe some pocket money and food, that\u2019s about all. See, I -- I had to get a salary, not very\nmuch, but I get a -- got enough, so I lived fairly comfortably then, and -- and then it -- where I\nbegan to re -- slowly began to feel maybe I\u2019m getting back into a normal mode of life. And then\nmy father was sponsored by someone in Canada -- you see, you ha -- you still had to have\nsponsorship, which is kind of really tough because -- because on one hand here you\u2019re s -- you\u2019re\na survivor and then you have to wait for a year -- or for two or three years, which 1s terrible, I\nmean that\u2019s something that I -- was very hard for me to understand as to why -- why these -- you\nknow, the Canadian, American [indecipherable] people at that time were so reluctant to bring\nthese people in, even though you were carefully checked medically, you know, if you had\ntuberculosis they wouldn\u2019t let you out, you had to be treated, and blood tests and all kinds of\nthings because they didn\u2019t want to obviously bring in sick people into -- into the country, into\nCanada or the United States. But you had that waiting period and these people in the -- in DP\ncamps, while -- while it was a far cry from being in a ghetto, still I mean, they were -- they had\nfood and they had some clothing, but that\u2019s about -- you know, they didn\u2019t have -- there was no\nwork, you know, per se. And there was just like waiting, waiting to -- to -- to -- to emigrate, and\nmany of them I guess had to be absorbed, and then -- and then maybe in European countries and\nso forth. So this was -- it was going on for a number of years. Because when I left -- left in 1950,\nwhen I emigrated Canada, the DP camps were still ac -- still -- still in existence. So that\u2019s another\naberration if you will, of -- of history and some sense that -- that these people were still sort of\nsecond class citizens, even though they were -- many of them were Jewish survivors and many of\nthem were -- were others, you know, other nationalities. So my f -- I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: I was going to ask you, did you know someone named Amy Gottlieb, who worked for the\nJDC in Munich?",
        "A: Not -- I --",
        "Q: No.",

        "Q: What camp were you in, actually?",
        "A: It was in the Munich camp, I\u2019m trying to remember the name of it, there was a large camp\nright -- right outside -- right -- right -- right outside of Munich, one of the -- one of the big ones,\nand I may have the name of it in my files somewhere, but I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t have it -- maybe I still\nhave it with me, I can look it up.",
        "Q: So it took you three years to get out of --",
        "A: Yeah, so my father got -- got out, I think, in 1949, when he got out first and then I followed\nhim. He kind of -- he was sponsored by -- by -- by people at -- that he made contact with in\nVancouver, British Columbia, and then he sponsored me, and then I followed him, and then I\nended up in 1950, in Vancouver, British Columbia, in Canada.",
        "Q: Did you feel really liberated then?",
        "A: I felt -- yeah, well, it was an adventure, was a new country, I -- finally I found maybe this was\na new -- new beginnings and new world for me, yes indeed, yeah, right. That was a -- a time\nwhen I -- and of course I was aware that I was older than most kids of my age who were -- went\nto high school and so forth, because I was already like 22 -- close to being 22, I think it was,\nearly in 1950 and I was born in August. But you know, 22 years old was kind of old even for --\nfor a freshman in college, and I had this desire to go to college, and my father wasn\u2019t really\ntotally encouraging cause he felt that I should maybe get a trade, you know. His idea at that time\nwas I should learn how to repair typewriters. That would have been a big help to me, right, later\non, you know, to repair typewriters, you know. Yeah, right? He thought that was a great thing,\nyou know, from his vantage point, you know, typewriters was a -- was a mechanically advanced,\nyou know, equipment, you know, and so forth. Repairing typewriters would give me a ma -- give\nme a pretty good living, you know, so -- and of course, I -- I didn\u2019t think that was attra -- exactly\nwhat I wanted to do. So what I did was -- is I went to a college entrance preparatory school in\nVancouver, by the name of Surepass, which was a funny name of the --",
        "Q: Showpass?",
        "A: Because you were -- you were sure to pass, you know, right, so it\u2019s called Surepass, that was\nthe name of it.",
        "Q: Surepass?",
        "A: Surepass. And I took for one -- one year, you know, I took this matriculate -- I took the\nexamination and I was able to get my college entrance examination at the University of British\nColumbia.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And -- and this was with -- with -- only with a five and a half or five grade hi -- school, you\nknow. But I studied hard, you know, and I took some courses and -- in that school and they --\nthey kind of knew what to learn, what to study and maybe they had a history of re -- you know,\nthey knew -- didn\u2019t know exactly what exam would contain, but they had a backlog of -- of the\nkind of exams that they would give, and so they steered the courses towards -- but you know, I\ngot a fairly good -- good background, and I enter -- and I entered the University of British\nColumbia, and went to college then, and so -- and my father was at that time -- of course tuition\nwas only like maybe 300 dollars a -- a semester or something like that, so it wasn\u2019t a terrible\nburden to my father because my father when he got the -- came to Canada he had some money\nwith him, and then he got in the construction business and he built a -- a rental property, so he\nwas okay, he was always the entrepreneur, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: This was -- this was his great, great forte is to -- is to make a living, you know\n[indecipherable] to -- to be able to -- to do that. It was, I guess, in his genes. And so I went to the\nUniversity of British Columbia, and then I took summer jobs, you know, like working for the\nHudson\u2019s Bay, you know, as a clerk and doing all kinds of things. And then I -- after a year I\nlived on campus of the University of British Columbia. And -- and then I took a year out before\nthis -- before the final year, before the -- the -- the -- the senior year and worked full time just to\nmake some money, and this is during that time I met Ethel. You know, and I lived by myself.\nRelationship with -- with Genya was very bad. And my father had big problems there, too.\nGeorge was in his own business, he was in the -- he was always mechanically inclined, so he got\ninto -- into the dry cleaning supplies business in --",
        "Q: In Canada, also?",
        "A: -- in kota -- in Canada and Vancouver also. And I was very fortunate that I graduated ahead of\nthe class of 1955, head of the graduating class and the faculty of arts. And I got the -- the -- the\nGovernor general\u2019s medal for -- for the -- for number one, and so that was -- that was a -- and on\nthe strength of that I got a fellowship for -- for Yale, you know. So I kind of made up for a little\nbit of lost time.",
        "Q: So you got a Master\u2019s from Yale?",
        "A: I got Master\u2019s from Yale, yeah.",
        "Q: In languages?",
        "A: In -- no, in foreign area studies.",
        "Q: In foreign area studies, uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah, international. I had at one time maybe -- I had an idea of perhaps going into the foreign\nservice, but then I was handicapped because in order to go into the foreign service, the United\nStates had the law that you had to be a citizen for 10 years before you could join the foreign\nservice. So 10 years, and I -- I didn\u2019t ob -- obviously not, and I didn\u2019t -- I -- I was not, I was just\na -- just a -- I was only a -- a ra -- you know, a -- a resident with a -- for one year when I got my\nMaster\u2019s degree, so I -- I didn\u2019t want to wait that long. So I thought that maybe I would go to --\nthen I got another fellowship for Columbia to continue for a PhD., perhaps in -- in -- in that area.\nAnd I got restless, I -- somehow academia did not attract me a-any more, I felt I need to get with\nthe mainstream, I wanted to -- to maybe establish my -- I -- I had great, great desire to mix, to be\nin a mainstream, because of this isolation of all the years, you know, I -- I wanted -- I didn\u2019t want\nto be isolated in the -- in the fee -- in the academia. And the close I got to the academia, I got\nvery restless with the faculty life and the -- some of the backbiting that I came across, you know,\nin this, you know, so -- so -- so in a kind of an historical interesting thing too, is that when I got\nmy fellowship for Columbia University, the director of the Russian Institute was no one bu-but\nZbigniew Brzezinski. And it\u2019s interesting speculate what would have happened if I had\ncontinued. And he was Polish, as you know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Whether I would have been his right hand, or -- or maybe I would have continued with him\nand -- and ended up in the high echelons of -- of -- of government and you know, and that -- and\nso forth, you know, and the -- but I didn\u2019t take that route and I decided to go into the -- into the\nbusiness world. And interesting, my father never thought I would be a good businessman. Yeah,\nhe always thought that I had two left hands, which is [indecipherable] his expression. I -- I was\ntoo -- I was too soft, I was too sensitive, you know, I wasn\u2019t tough enough. I wasn\u2019t cut out for\nthe business world. Well, I proved him wrong, because I was very, very successful in the\nbusiness world. And I did climb the corporate la -- you know, a corporate scale and I got some\nvery important corporate jobs and -- and was president of companies and sit on board of directors\nand all that kind of stuff, until I retired and I got into my own -- my own business, but -- so I did\nprove him wrong, you know, so -- because when I -- when I joined the -- when I went into -- into\nthe retail business, I went on the executive training of Macy\u2019s in New York, he thought that I\nwasted all that time going to college. You know, was a total waste, even though I told him that\nwithout a college education they wouldn\u2019t accept you into -- into executive training. But he\ncouldn\u2019t -- he couldn\u2019t -- he thought I was -- I was just -- just talking nonsense, he said he\ncouldn\u2019t -- he couldn\u2019t understand. He said, you don\u2019t need a college education to be -- to go to\nwork in a store, you know. He thought I was, you know, the clerk or something, I mean who\nwants to -- who needs a college education to -- to stand behind the counter and -- you know, and\n-- and sell and sell the haberdashery or whatever, you know, or housewares. So at any rate, so\nthat was -- that was basically what has happened and -- and of course having been fortunate\nenough to meet Ethel and to put up with me and with all my baggage that I carried with me, it\nwasn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t easy and -- and it was this cultural gap, too, you know, when you -- and I -- I\nwas very self conscious about my background. I was self conscious about -- about my accent,\nabout not speaking English well, you know, I had such a terrible, terrible desire to fit in, to be\none of the -- of the masses. I didn\u2019t want to be a -- a -- a outsider. I didn\u2019t want to be asked, hey,\nyou speak, you know, where you from, you know. You have an accent, you know. That used to\nbother -- bother me a lot, you know. Maybe it was me, you know, maybe it was -- you know,\nwas maybe foolish on my part of -- to feel that way, but in Vancouver, which is more of a\nprovincial town, you know, people wouldn\u2019t hesitate to ask you. In New York you can speak all\nkinds of language, nobody pays attention to you. But in Vancouver, you know, you open your\nmouth and -- and not that they were that terribly interested in you, all they want to hear where\nyou from, you know. They didn\u2019t know -- they didn\u2019t want to say wow, gee, you know, where\nyou from and how -- when did you come or anything like that. All they wanted to know is where,\nyou know, just to satisfy their superficial curiosity as it were, you know. So -- so that bothered\nme quite a bit, and -- and of course my accent was much, much heavier, you know. In fact, Ethel\nkids me about the fact when we first started to date, you know, I -- I still didn\u2019t know how to say\nt-h properly, and I -- I would say wiz instead of with, you know. And that sort of thing, so --",

        "A: The very first time.",
        "Q: Why now?",
        "A: Well, actually, I was lucky because I -- all I did was return -- I had the form from the\nmuseum, which sat on my desk for about two or three years. And there was a name which I don\u2019t\nthink that lady is -- is any longer with -- with your department, but if you gave me the name I\nmay recall that.",
        "Q: Amy Reuben?",
        "A: No. There was somebody else.",
        "Q: Arwin?",
        "A: Mm-mm. Well, maybe it was more than even two or three years ago. At any rate, it sat on my\ndesk and I had maybe -- whatever it was, I had a survivor\u2019s block, I didn\u2019t register because that\nwas a kind of a form very similar to the -- to -- well, it was the original form that I sent in, that\nwas the -- the very same form that I sent in. And I finally filled it out and I put down, you know,\nand all that, with the Mieczyslaw Wereszczyszyn business and all that, and I got a call. I didn\u2019t\nexpect to get a call. I didn\u2019t expect to -- to be a -- to ask for the interview. I didn\u2019t know whether\nI would qualify, whether my background was dramatic enough to -- you know, to qualify for\nthat. So lo and behold, I get this call from Elizabeth, would I be willing to do that, and I said of\ncourse I would. And that happened to be coincidental with -- with star -- I started to write, I have\nlike a chapter of my memoirs, I started to do that. So there was [indecipherable] for two this\nreally, that I did. Why didn\u2019t I do it sooner? Again, I -- I just -- I didn\u2019t -- maybe I -- because I\ndidn\u2019t feel that my story was -- was that important, you know, in the scheme of things. Maybe I\ndidn\u2019t want to go through this whole -- the past, you know, trying to relive all that and go\nthrough this -- through these very painful, terrible memories, you know. You know, maybe I\ndidn\u2019t want to do this so I don\u2019t lose faith in humanity, you know. Because I\u2019ve always been an\noptimist and I still am. I believe that humankind can be better. I strongly believe in that, and I\nstrongly believe that -- that life is sacred, that human life is sacred, whether it\u2019s one or one\nmillion or six million or whatever, you know. Every human life is sacred in my -- and I deeply\nbelieve in that, that\u2019s my -- that\u2019s my religion, as it were. I am a member of the Ethical Culture\nSociety. And this is my religion, ethical humanist. So I have a very strong feeling about that. So\nmaybe I didn\u2019t want to do that because I didn\u2019t want to -- to nibble at that -- at that st-strong\nfeeling. I didn\u2019t want to lose, maybe -- maybe come bitter again, you know, a-about that, or lose\n-- lose faith in humanity, become distrustful, you know. And so I\u2019m very happy, I\u2019m very happy\nnow. I\u2019m happy to be alive. And I\u2019m very happy to be able to tell you my story. And I sure hope\nthat it -- it\u2019Il be of interest to -- to other viewers and I\u2019m ready and willing and able at any time to\n-- if they have any further questions or anything more t-to -- to talk about, because there\u2019s so\nmuch --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that -- I said a lot and there\u2019s maybe more to be said.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sure there is.",
        "A: SO --",
        "Q: Well, I want to thank you for being so open.",

        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Eight\nBeginning Tape Nine",
        "Q: And what is this photo here? Now you can explain.",
        "A: Okay, well this is a picture of my mother when I was about eight years old, would have been\nthe year of 1936.",
        "Q: And she would have been how old do you think?",
        "A: About 31.",
        "Q: And -- and her name?",
        "A: Her name was -- was Leah, the -- we used to call her Liecha in Yiddish, what today would\nhave been known as Lisa.",
        "Q: Lisa Sarah?",
        "A: Lisa Sarah wert -- Lisa Sarah Wertman. Maiden name Truk. These are pictures of my\nmother\u2019s parents. Their name was Truk, and Sarah was the -- was the mother and Zander was the\nfather. And this was taken about the same time, about 1936, where they lived in Danzig. And\nthey both perished in the Holocaust.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Okay, this is one of the earliest pictures I have of myself, I was about four years old, taken on\na horse, which was kind of a staged picture at the time, and -- course it was taken in L\u2019vov. This\nis a street scene in L\u2019vov when my grandmother was visiting and it\u2019s a picture of her and my\nmother and myself, and I may have been about what, five years old at the time. As you can see\nfrom it, that -- we were -- it was cold weather and I\u2019m kind of well covered for the -- for the\nelements here. Okay, this was taken in a town called Sopwot, which was near Danzig. It was a\nresort town and a beach, and I was four or five years old at the time, one -- on one of my visits to\nDanzig. And on the picture, starting from the right is my mother, next to her is my grandmother.\nNext to her, standing, is the sister of -- my aunt, sister of my mother. And sitting right behind me\nis Abrun Truk, who is one of -- one of the brothers of my mother. And I have very -- very, very\npleasant memories because that was still a time of peace and it was a beautiful resort area. And I\nhad a lot of -- lot of fun at the time, on the beach, playing in the sand. Okay, this was taken a bit\nlater, I was at that time, possibly 10 year old, 10 or 11, shortly before the war, and again it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s -- brings back memories, of course, of my childhood. Kind of a little bit studied picture, but -\n- but it -- it ref -- 1t shows -- shows pretty accurately my -- my Aryan look. Now this is a very\ninteresting picture because it shows my mother and her brother Ben, who was very dear to us,\njust before he left Danzig, in 1939, he was able to escape from Danzig and my mother was still\nin Danzig at that time. So she was the only one of her sisters and brothers who was -- who stayed\nbehind, while the others were able to leave Danzig and survive abroad. Okay, now this is a shot\nof -- of my typical work day when I was working as an apprentice, and when I was the Aryan\nMieczyslaw Wereszczyszyn, and my work was at the sewing machines, sometimes it was away\nfrom the machine doing other things. But I did a lot of sewing and as you can see, there are\npatterns hanging behind, and pieces of leather. So that was a typical -- typical work day shot for\nme. Okay, the other picture, the small picture shows me with a typical apron that we all wore\nbecause we did a lot of cutting leather and dirty work as well. Just in the -- in the courtyard of the\n-- of the workshop that I worked in.",
        "Q: The one on your left.",
        "A: Okay, this is a street scene, one of the ladies I befriended. I didn\u2019t know her for very long, but\nwe happened to be walking down the street and there was a shot taken. And this is typical, with\nthe hat, that I looked at, and -- and again it shows -- it shows me in -- in -- in Warsaw. This shot\nwas taken when I was visiting the family, the Bozym family in the -- in the suburb of Warsaw\nand the woman in -- that is with me a -- the young lady is one of the sisters of the family that I --\nthat I was friendly with. It just shows my blonde hair and my overall looks at the time. Okay, this\nwas Mr. Bozym, who was the father of the -- of the family and he was a carpenter and he is the\none that I worked with at that German infantry unit in the -- the artillery unit where I was injured\nworking with him at the time. And he was a very gentle soul, and a very, very friendly chap.\nOkay, now this 1s actually a post-war picture, that was 1947, taken in Munich when I was 19\nyears old, but it pretty much illustrates what I looked like and how I was able to -- to pass as an\nAryan with my wavy blonde hair, blue eyes, and at that time not -- not very prominent Jewish\nnose. Was in [indecipherable] already, I\u2019m not sure when he moved. Wait now, this 1s a very,\nvery early picture of my father, it\u2019s very interesting because he was only 25 years old at the time\nand the woman beside him is the mother -- his first wife, the mother of George and Mordechai,\nand was taken 1920, and it shows my father with a beard and a typical hat worn at that time, so\nreminiscent of -- of \u201cFiddler on the Roof.\u201d And he -- I don\u2019t ever -- I don\u2019t remember ever him\nhaving -- with a beard, so it must have been way back when, and then when -- he decided to\nshave his beard when he moved to L\u2019vov. This is a photo of my brother George and his wife\nFrieda, taken in Munich in 1947. He was, by then, pretty much recovered from his ordeal on the -\n- in the -- in the camp of Winniki, and trying to estab -- get himself established and of course\nwaiting for emigration.",
        "Q: And George is the son of your father --",
        "A: Right, and George is the son of my -- my father\u2019s first wife. Yeah, my -- my half-brother,\nseven years older. This is a shot of my -- my father and I, taken 1948 in Munich, Germany. And\nagain it shows my appearance, and my father didn\u2019t really look that stern, but he always had a\nvery serious expression on his face. And at that time he had that mu -- moustache, which he\nwould later shave, but he had that moustache for many, many years. We sometimes kidded him\nabout it, saying why do you w -- why do you wear a -- why do you have a Hitler moustache, but\nit was the fashion of the time. [indecipherable] after the war, but -- okay, now this -- this piece of\npaper 1s very interesting and important historically because it d -- it authenticates my name of\nMieczyslaw Wereszczyszyn. It was taken right after the war, where I had to register with the\nlocal authorities. My other documents were -- were lost and destroyed, but this survived. And it\nactually shows that I registered under that name and I also paid a fee for the registration.",
        "Q: You were t --",
        "A: Okay, this is a -- I never, of course, had my original birth certificates, all those documents\nwere lost, you know, in the Holocaust and in 1993, when I applied for Medicare, I was\nencouraged to try to obtain a birth certificate because the Medicare authorities felt that it\u2019s a\ngood -- good thing to have for the record. So I wrote to the authorities in Warsaw, Polish\nauthorities, giving my name as Wertman, Abraham, because that was my original birth certificate\nname, and ga -- giving them th -- my -- my address in L\u2019vov and the place and the street where I\nwas born, without giving them the name of my parents and sure enough, they were able to\nactually dig up all the records and this is in Polish, saying that this a -- a copy -- an abbreviated\ncopy of my birth certificate, listing of course my name as Wertman, Abraham, showing the date\nof August 30, 1928. City of birth, L\u2019vov, and the name of my father, Chuna Wertman, which is\ncorrect, and of course -- and my mother\u2019s Sarah Leah Truk, which was her maiden name. So I\nwas glad to actually have a -- an -- a real, authentic birth certificate. Ba -- four -- thr --three --\nthree -- four years ago, three years ago -- wait!",
        "Q: Oops, my mistake, go ahead.",
        "A: About three years ago, my brother George and Frieda, shown here decided t -- to take a trip to\nPoland and to -- just as part of their itinerary. And they went to the street with -- where I was\nborn, where we all lived, and the two photos show the outside, which is a street that\u2019s numbers\nstill there, 6A, and the street name, Pilnikarska, which is not shown here. And of course it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s in disrepair, but that\u2019s sort of the gate where we -- where we -- the entrance to it, and the\nupper windows is where we lived, and the lower part, which is on the -- on the right hand side\nhere, were some other apartments that my father would rent out, and it shows the interior --\ninterior court, and on the right hand side was a stable where my father kept some horses for his --\nwith a wagon and where he would get milk from the -- from the railroad station for his\nprocessing of milk and for the milk products, and so forth. On the left was the -- part of the\nfactory and the store, and it looks boarded up now, so it\u2019s really in -- in bad repair, but\ninterestingly it\u2019s still -- it\u2019s still there.\nEnd of Tape Nine\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "A: Yes, I lived on a street called Pilnikarska, which was several apartment buildings, almost\nclose to the center of the city, and we lived in a two story building. The upper story was a set of\nrooms, and the business itself was downstairs, you know with the little factory there. And there\nwas actually a stable with a couple of horses because the milk was being picked up at the railroad\nstation early in the morning, so we had a couple of workers there, we had also workers in the\nfactory. And most of the neighbors on our street were Jewish, was fair -- heavily Jewish because\nL\u2019vov actually had a population of 110,000. Actually, later on it swelled to oh -- to a 150,000\nmore. So all a total population of 340, so it\u2019s only one-third, you know, was the third largest\nJewish community i1-in Poland. So -- so that was a very heavy population there. And so the kids\nthat I would play with were mostly Jewish, wi -- you know, and -- and interestingly also that --\nwhich we'll -- we\u2019ll get back to later, when I begin to assume a different identity, is that actually\nmy native language was Polish. I like -- like families today, you know, where the -- first\ngeneration, you know, they speak Polish, and their parents speak Chine -- I mean peak -- speak\nEnglish and the parents speak Chinese, or whatever. Well, I spoke Polish, and of course, my\nparents spoke Yiddish. So I did understand everything they said, but I would always answer in\nPolish, which helped me a lot later on, because my Polish was very, very good, and very clean\nand very native Polish, unlike many others, who -- you know, from smaller towns, who did not\nhave that -- that advantage.",

But he was -- he belonged to Betar and -- and\nwas fairly active in that. That wasn\u2019t -- you know, they had some uniforms of their own, all that.\nBut that was early -- in the early stages, later on became much more difficult, even before the\nwar, because the -- there was a lot of -- obviously some anti-Semitism that -- 1t was prevalent.\nAnd incidentally, L\u2019vov also had a very, very high Ukrainian population. It was one third Jewish,\none third Ukrainian, one th-third Polish. And L\u2019vov being western Ukraine was a cradle of -- of\nUkrainian nationalism and was a -- a lot of animosity between the Poles, and the Ukrainian and\nthe Jews. So the Jews basically, a lot of the Jews had a -- had a kind of a double -- double\nwhammy, they were obviously hated by the Ukrainians and of course, a lot of the Poles were\nalso, you know, anti -- anti-Semites. So -- so that was a big problem for the L\u2019vov Jewish\npopulation.",
        "A: I felt 1t occasionally, in public school, when sometimes a teacher would make some funny\nJewish, you know, imitating Jewish words, or -- or one of the kids would speak maybe a little bit\nof a what I would call a Jewish Polish, you know, he would kind of make some f-fun of that and\nall that, but generally I did not feel a direct -- direct thing. I was never, you know, accosted or\nattacked or anything like that or -- or by -- by -- by other kids because we were pretty -- ina\npretty heavily Jewish population where I -- where I lived, you know.",
        "A: Well -- well, there were restrictions in getting to a higher education. You know, there were\nquotas involved and all that, and so my brother went to -- to a -- a commerce high school, you\nknow, tried to get a degree there, and that didn\u2019t last very long, but my father -- my brother never\nmentioned any -- any overt or direct confrontations as such, because again, the Jewish\ncommunity, even though it wasn\u2019t a modern city like L\u2019vov, was still very, very closely knit, you\nknow, and there was very little interaction, except for the -- some the servants that would work,\nor some workers that would come to work, etcetera.

        "A: Well, I did resent it to some degree, because he never told me that he would do that, and he\nmarried a woman who actually was a housekeeper, was 22 years younger than --",

        "A: Y-Yeah. Which was very, very hard, that was -- that was very hard, and -- and also the fact\nthat he wouldn\u2019t support my mother, that -- that -- that --",
        "A: -- that both -- that hurt, because I was living in a fairly comfortable household, and yet my\nmother was in a very small apartment, she had to -- she tried to do some physical therapy to earn\na living. So that was very, very hard. Yeah, I -- I kind of never forgave him for that.",
        "A: Oh very much so, because he really was very close to my mother, you know.",

And he\nbasically helped my father in th -- in -- in the -- in the shop and in the s -- business. So I wasn\u2019t\nthat close to him, even though he was a very gentle soul, I didn\u2019t have much to do with him, per\nse. But with Moshe who is now George, we were -- we were close, yeah, we quite often slept\ntogether, and you know, in the -- and of course our house -- our home was always full of visitors\nbecause you know, the big city. They would come from the small shtetl as it were, you know,\nand -- and visit the big city, you know, that was a big thing for them. So we had visitors because\nmy -- my father had four brothers and one sister, spread in many places in Poland. None\nsurvived, incidentally.",

        "A: No, no, actually, actually -- actually, til about 1940 - \u201941 because under the -- as you may\nrecall, in 1939, when Hitler attacked Poland, the Germans were on the outskirts, close to L\u2019vov --",
        "A: -- and we fully expected them to come, and then overnight, all of a sudden you see the\nRussians are here. So from 1939 to \u201941 --",

        "A: Oh, enormous change --",
        "A: Enormous change.",
        "A: Personally, through myself, it was -- well, the change was that first of all my father lost his\nbusiness because the Russian -- there was no private enterprise allowed, so that -- so ac --\neverything was expropriated. All the -- all -- you know, so my father lost -- they did allow us to\nstay in the apartment, which was -- which was in a way unusual, because [indecipherable] they\nwould chase you out.",
        "A: And my father lost everything, you know, he lost his business, they took away everything\nfrom him, and they even searched the apartment to see whether there\u2019s any -- any monies or\nvaluables, or whatever, they would appropriate, because to them that was the you -- you know,\nthey were called the -- the kulogs, you know, the exploiters of the masses. Fortunately, the\nworkers actually did say that -- they did speak well of my father. So that helped, you know, in\nsome ways. But he lost it. So from -- so that was a -- a -- obviously a total loss, and -- and then\nmy father tried to make a living, you know, or black market was a -- was the -- was the thing to\ndo to try to, you know, scrape up a living and get a work permit, everybody had to work, you\nknow, my -- my brother worked for the railroad doing some -- he was mechanically inclined so\nhe did some locomotive repairs, and -- and I went to school, you know, I went to -- to a school\nand -- and then I -- all of a sudden the -- the Ukraine became the foreign language. Incidentally,\nbefore the war, before 1939, the foreign language was German, ironically, and the reason why it\nwas German is because for Poland, German was a very important language because it was a\nlanguage of science, of technology, which Poland always lacked. You know, like tools and\nimplements and machinery was -- was always in German. Moreover, L\u2019vov itself was under\nAustria for 150 years, so there was a lot of German influence in the -- in the -- in that area, too.\nIn fact, L\u2019vov was known as Lemberg, in German. And in Yiddish always Lemberg, you know,\nfor the Yiddish speaking. Like I would refer it to L\u2019wow, which is the Polish way of saying\nL\u2019 wow, L-w-o-w. But my father would always say Lemberg.",
        "A: Yeah, right. So -- but then when this -- when the Russians took over that part of Poland, we\nwent to school and instead of German, it was Ukrainian.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: That was -- that was the foreign language that we were taught. No, no, Polish was the\nlanguage.",

        "A: Oh sure.",
        "A: It\u2019s change -- changed -- 1-it changed in a way that -- that -- that we were not sure of food, but\n-- but we -- but there was no extravagance, there was no -- we had to kind of pull in a little bit,\nbut my father was very, very entrepreneurial and very adept in -- in scraping things up and so\nforth and got very into -- into doing all kinds of things. So we were not really that badly off,\nactually. We\u2019ll manage to -- to -- you know, to live fairly comfortably, fairly comfortably.",

And she\ncame from a very small town in the pro -- in provinces, and -- and she tried to please my father\nby being very frugal, you know, to my father, the epitome of -- of womanhood was to be a good\nhousekeeper, and you know, a good -- a good -- frugal housekeeper and of course a very devoted\nwife, you know, and so he didn\u2019t ask us whether we would -- what we would th-think about her,\nyou know, being the new -- the new lady of the home, as it were. He just decided to do it, that\nwas his way of doing things. So we had some -- we had real problems with that, you know,\nSerious --",
        "A: Right, sure. And she, of course, tried to assume authority, you know, she trying to assert\nherself now that she assumed that role from a housekeeper or servant to the actual lady to the --\nto the -- of the household, you know, to be in charge of it and so forth. So it -- she tr -- had to --\nyou know, and so it just didn\u2019t mesh at all, didn\u2019t mesh, you know. It was not -- 1t was that lack\nof sensitivity and -- perhaps on both parts, although we were kind of blaming her because she\nwas the adult and we were the kids --",
        "A: -- you know, so we kind of expected, perhaps her, to -- to understand the situation better, but -",
        "A: Yes, indeed. Well, my father was totally becoming detached from it, you know, so --",
        "A: To very young children, yes. Very much so, when we were very, very young, he was very\naffectionate. When we got older, not so much, you know.",
        "A: We were more of a -- his favorite expression would be, what did you accomplish today? You\nknow, at the end of the day that was -- that was his way of -- of ma-making sure that you -- that\nyou were hard working and responsible and all that, you know, and -- and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a tough life,\nyou know, that was his -- his way. And of course he did come from a very modest background.\nAnd so in one way, you know -- but he didn\u2019t have that balance, you know, he didn\u2019t have that\nbalance, but -- but he loved music, you know, he had a good voice, he -- he was very, very\nintelligent, very bright. He knew the Scriptures really well, he knew the Talmud inside out, you\nknow. His favorite oc-occupation was to get into some -- some dialog with some -- some rabbis\nyou know, to show off his own knowledge of it, and -- and find some faults or errors 1n their -- in\ntheir knowledge, you know, of it. So that was one of his favorite pa -- you know, things that he\nwould -- and he read a lot, Jewish newspapers and so -- but no, he was very good to me when I\nwas very, very young. He\u2019d always have some candy in his pocket and all that. But then when I\nwas -- and -- and I was the only child of -- of my mother so he kind of doted on me.

        "A: Well, let me give you a -- give you a -- it comes back to me. In 1939 when -- when Germany -\n- | think it was in June 22\u2122 when they attack, and then by the end of the month they were -- they\nactually were in -- I\u2019m sorry -- I\u2019m sorry. In September, I -- I want to go back. In September\nwhen -- when the Germans attacked Poland, and they were on the outskirts of [indecipherable]\nwe were fully prepared for the -- for the Germans to arrive, you know? And then the Russians\ncame overnight, and they came with this huge, huge tanks, tore up the streets, you know, the\ncobblestones, and the overhead electrical for the -- you know, for streetcars, and because they\nhad these -- these lumbering, monstrous tanks. So -- so that was our first encounter with them.\nAnd -- and things have changed, you know? Now, we became very soon aware of the problems.\nWe already heard obviously before -- before the -- the -- the -- you know, bef -- before this\nwhole thing happened, all the problems of the war, and th -- obviously in the attack on Poland.\nAs you know, it was their -- their German blitzkrieg, which 1s a lightning war, with the\nchivalrous Polish cavalry attacking German tanks, you know, which was -- that was one of the\nthings that was so sad, you know, they just didn\u2019t -- they -- they -- just they couldn\u2019t fight the\nGermans at all, I mean they were just -- and so we had many, many refugees in L\u2019vov. In fact\nour house was full of refugees. We had one time -- there was my -- my -- my brother\u2019s mother\u2019s\nfamily. I remember that one time there was a family with six children cou -- staying with us in\nour -- in our home as refugees. And there were -- at one time, I think the record showed that\nthere was like a -- maybe a hundred thousand Jews that actually migrated or escaped from the --\nfrom the other side into -- into L\u2019vov, you know. And one of the ironies of war, which may be\nnot that well known, is that those refugees who came to L\u2019vov, desperately tried to stay in L\u2019vov.\nThey wanted to stay at L\u2019vov under the -- you know, because they felt they may be safe under\nthe Russians. But the Russians issued an edict that any Jew who did not -- was not a resident\nprior to 1939, had to be evacuated, had to leave. So they forcefully evacuated thousands and\nthousands of Jews from L\u2019vov to the far east of Russia. And these survived --",
        "A: -- you see. And yet many of them desperately tried -- they we -- tried to bribe authorities, they\ntried to get false papers and all that. And that didn\u2019t work at all, I mean, the Russians were very,\nvery strict. And I recall my father sending parcels to these relatives that were actually, you know,\ntaking ba -- taking it to -- to Russia, and these actually survived. And I remember them after the\nwar, you know, that they actually survived. So -- so there\u2019s one of those ironies, if you will, of\nthe war that people that didn\u2019t know what to do, with so much confusion and so forth and they\nactually survived, and the native, or the local people perished [indecipherable]\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: We -- we -- we heard --",

But not, at that point we were not aware of the full extent of the\nHolocaust in terms of the -- of the crematoria and the -- and the mass slaughter. And the -- at\nleast I did not personally hear that, or was aware of it.

We did not believe that it would last. We -- we knew that this\nwas maybe just a -- because my father would make comments. You know, we had this short\nwave radio -- radio, and -- and wasn\u2019t -- was middle waves, actually, and we listened to BBC,\nright, London, this is London calling, you know. And we had all these -- you know, and also\nthere was an \u00e9migr\u00e9 Polish government in -- in London, so there were some Polish broadcasts as\nwell. A -- so we heard commentaries about that fact that there\u2019s -- you know, there\u2019s -- there\u2019s\nmaybe just a -- a pause for the Germans, you know, that this was not going to last. We -- in fact,\nwe didn\u2019t believe it. When it happened, it was a -- just a total surprise, seeing Russians in L\u2019vov\nwas just -- because we fully expected the Germans to -- to arrive. And of course there was also\nthe gener -- still a disbelief that the Germans would go that far, you know. We thought that\nperhaps this was a -- a -- a temporary prob -- you know, thing that the Germans were -- were\nrevenged themselves because of the Versailles Treaty of the first World War, you know, because\nthey felt they were mistreated by the allies, and -- and they trying to use the Jews as scapegoats,\nand of course that -- and there\u2019s always this history of Jewish persecution and -- and sc -- so\nthere was this mixed feeling because -- because the feeling was that the Germans with that high\nculture, with that -- with a tremendous contribution to civilization, how could they possibly be --\nbe prone to -- to -- to -- to do that, you know, to really try to destroy a people. We just thought\nthat this was maybe part of the overall war effort as it were, and the Jews were considered also as\nbeing communists, you know, a lot of Jews belonged to the left or -- you know, socialists an --\norganizations, so the Germans may have been using this as an excuse to -- you know, to restrict\nand confine the Jews and so forth, and using that as a -- as a -- as a -- aS a co -- So there were a\nlot of mixed, mixed feelings. There was -- there was still a kind of a -- the way I remember\nhearing adults talk -- I me -- I -- obviously I was too young to participate, is that there was a kind\nof a disbelief that -- that this was going to get that much -- much worse, you know, that this was\nmaybe part of the overall war situation as it were, until a little later.",
        "A: Well, I -- I think there was an -- for the -- for a -- for awhile there was a mixed bag, but with\nthe German successes in the west, you know, when they overran all of Europe practically, okay,\nand also with the -- with the London, you know, blitz, too, and all that, and knowing the history\nof the relationship between Germany and Russia you know, and -- and -- and knowing the -- the\n-- the German ne -- expansionism and need -- needing the Ukraine as -- as their breadbasket, you\nknow, to -- to f -- fuel the war effort. The feeling was that this may -- might not last it, you know,\nI mean. When and how we didn\u2019t know, of course, you know.",

        "A: No, they didn\u2019t, no. No, no. I don\u2019t whether they -- actually whether we had the radio at the\ntime when they -- you know, the confiscated business, or whether my father acquired one. I\u2019m\nnot sure, but we -- I know we did have one.",
        "A: There were -- no, there was Ukrainian newspapers. Yiddish newspapers were eventually --\nthey were published later on, but obviously with their -- with a Soviet tinge, as it were.",

        "A: Although -- as long as the official language was Russian or Ukrainian, they did. So there was\nno restriction per se in terms of -- of that, you know.

And he ended up in a camp in\nWinniki, which was a suburb of L\u2019vov, where he spent over two years in -- in the -- 1n this,\nwhich was a -- like a concentration camp, actually a forced labor camp. And he had a very tough\ntime with that, you know, he -- so he -- he was never in the -- in the ghetto, you know, because\nthe ghetto didn\u2019t open til November, is when they opened the ghetto and herded everybody into\nthe ghetto. So he was -- and ironically that was done -- I think it was the Jewish police that --\ncause they didn\u2019t know, they were just told to s -- you know, we need some workers, you know,\nfor a few hours and so he ended up in the camp.",

He was this --\nthe camp consisted of about -- male only, but of -- about 250 approximately, inmates in that\ncamp. And they were doing roadwork, they were in a quarry, breaking stones manually for road\nbuilding. So the ghetto was still open and I was able to get out of the ghetto and bring him some\nfood, and also actually was one oth -- one -- one time I actually went into his camp, I was\nallowed to go inside.

        "A: Oh absolutely, oh yes, oh yes indeed. It was a -- it was just -- just -- yeah, like the world was\ncoming to an end, you know, I mean it was total, total -- was chaos, you know, people don\u2019t\nknow what to do. The -- the Germans required tribute, you know, of monies, and gold, and so\nforth, and they established this Jewish council called the Judenrat, you know, through whom they\nchanneled the -- all their demands. And of course, the Judenrat hoped that they would be a buffer\nto help, you know, mitigate some of these things, and so -- and then in November is when we\nstarted to go into the ghetto, and they gave us [indecipherable] a deadline of 30 days or 35 days,\nbut they extended that because they just couldn\u2019t manage to get everybody in that they -- and\nthen on the way to the ghetto, they would pick out older people. I remember an incident -- and\nthese things come to mind as you -- as you speak, is that my brother\u2019s, Moshe George,\ngrandmother was with us at that time, and we were crossing a bridge on Peltewna Street into the\nghetto, and what they were doing is they were picking out old people, or frail people and\nwouldn\u2019t even let them into the ghetto, they just took them out and -- took them away and shot\nthem. So I -- so I have this grandmother put a kerchief on and I was talking to her in Ukrainian as\nwe were crossing, as we walk -- because there was a lot of traffic back and forth. And of course,\nI was blonde and blue eyed, didn\u2019t look Jewish at all. So I spoke to her in Ukrainian and we were\n-- we just crossed, you know, I mean they didn\u2019t pay attention to us because there was so much\nmovement, so I was able to get her into the ghetto and she subsequently died a natural death\nwhile in the ghetto.

And of course anybody, any Jew who was -- who wore the traditional\nhat and beard and all that, would certainly risk a -- a -- a beating, if not a killing, you know, and\nso forth, so they stayed at home. Younger people [indecipherable] moved around. So there was\nstill quite a bit of movement, you know. Streetcars were operating, actually the streetcars were\neven operating inside the ghetto until the -- until later on, you know, because of still a lot of\nmovement into the ghetto, from the ghetto.

Not many -- many civilian cars, but you know, German cars, or what. And I remember a\nlot -- some of the Polish people looking at me kind of surprised because they were wondering\nwhether I was just playing games or something, or trying to imitate a Jew. Because here was this\n-- this -- this blonde, you know, blue eyed kid that absolutely didn\u2019t look Jewish at all, you know,\nwearing this armband with a -- with a Star of David, you know, and -- and I thought that was,\nyou know, kind of strange, but --",

They left them there for about -- I think couple of days, just to\nfrighten the people.",
        "A: Terrible, was just very, very scary. Very scary. Just horrible. Was hard to describe.",
        "A: Oh, I mentioned it, I mention it to him when I saw him later on and I said -- and he heard\nabout it, cause it was be -- it was well-known. It was one of those Aktions, they called that\n[indecipherable] Aktions that the Germans did from time to time just to s -- just to keep\neverybody in check, just to -- to frighten the populace, and whatever pretext they could use to do\nthat, you know. But at that time, even in the ghetto, we still -- I did not he -- I was not aware -- I\nwas -- know there were transports. We knew there were people taken on the train to be sent\nsomewhere. But I-I don\u2019t -- did not hear about the crematoria, about the Auschwitz, or the\nBuchenwalds, or the Treblinkas and all that. At that time, didn\u2019t hear that.",
        "A: That was still not -- people still felt that they were going somewhere, possibly to some labor\ncamps and all that, because there were labor camps surrounding the city.\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: Well, it was mainly, mainly there was collections of that, you know, for -- from -- but mainly\nthe Germans were much more interested in -- in -- in -- in money and jewelry and gold, you\nknow. Precious metals. Art objects, you know, and stuff like that. Basic clothing, I don\u2019t\nremember that as being a priority for them. But -- but 1t was a s -- just horrible in a sense that\nthere was, you know, there was never enough, you know, there was constantly -- and what I\nthink what the Germans tried to do is to get as much as they could before they -- before herding\neverybody into the ghetto, you know, because that was a time where they could actually grab\nthings and you were not allowed to bring anything to the ghetto than what you can carry. You\nknow, there was no -- no carriages of any kind, or -- or bicycles, anything like that. Whatever\nyou could car -- drag on your ba -- you know, hold on your back or suitcases and stuff. So there\nwas no [indecipherable] like -- occasionally I think they may have been able to hire maybe a -- a\n-- a-- a Pole or a Ukrainian with a -- with a cart or something like that if they could a -- if you\ncould pay for it, but generally you could see mass -- just procession of people just going into it\nwith -- with their basic belongings.",
        "A: All right, de -- there was announcements made, you know, there were pol -- you know, in --\nin -- in Poland the basic announcement that was made was not made on the radio or anything\nthat, they usually by -- by placards and by -- you know, they called aficias, you know, they put\non -- on -- on kiosks, you know, on -- on walls and all that. And it was just an announcement\nmade that as of that date, which was in November, everybody must -- must -- you know, they\nwere -- they were establish a district, you know, which is down the Zulkeyewska-\nZamarstynowska district, kind of a poor section of town, that everybody has to go into that area,\nthat was the ghetto. And -- and people were aware of the ghetto coming because there were\nghettos already established in the other part of Poland, which was under the Germans for two\nyears, you know, they started with the ghetto. So that -- so it was not totally unexpected that you\nhave to go into a ghetto. But it was very traumatic because people just have to leave everything\nbehind, you know, I mean even though they knew that -- they knew that they would, just the fact\nthat they had to do it, and when you do it, when you leave all of your lifetime belongings, all\nyour precious things, you -- you know, we didn\u2019t even have enough room for photographs, tha --\nthat -- I the -- there was no family photographs of when I was -- I remember I s -- I -- I had baby\nphotographs, you know, like you know, with my bare bottom on a -- on a -- on a bare rug, and all\nthese photographs taken as baby -- a ba -- and childhood pictures, nothing, I mean, because there\n-- because this was -- this was just a burden, you know, you had to -- clothing and -- and -- and\nwhatever you could take with you, you know, you took, but you didn\u2019t take albums or -- or -- or -\n- or -- or books, or anything like that, you know, that was just a -- something that you couldn\u2019t --\ncouldn\u2019t handle even. So that was totally lost, you know, all the family photographs, any kind of\npersonal belongings, mementos, whatever, what you will.",
        "A: They have about -- they ta -- they said originally I believe it was like 30 days or 40 days, 45\ndays, and I guess it was extended because they just couldn\u2019t handle all of it. But by -- I would\nsay by -- probably by mid-December, most of the -- most of the Jews were -- there were still\nsome Jews left outside by papers, who had connections as it were, with the Judenrat or were\nspecially singled out by the Germans as desirable to -- you know, to -- for want some work to be\ndone, or -- or special work to be done and so forth. They were very selective about who they\nconsidered desirable and who not. So -- so by, I would say, by the -- by the end of December or\nso, you know, close to that, most of the -- of the Jews were in the ghetto, but that was still left\nopen, it was still open back and forth and -- and Jews with work permits could leave the ghetto,\nthey wer -- worked outside the ghetto, they -- there were all kinds of laborer camps established,\nyou know, within the city, to work for the German, you know, ni -- whatever it was, clothing\nmanufacturer, all kinds of manufacturing. Cause the Germans took advantage of every -- of\nevery able body since all of their -- their men were in the army, you know, so they used Poles\nand Jews and Ukrainians, and -- for whatever labors -- requirements they had, or they felt was --\nwas necessary for the war effort, you know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the exact day. I remember making two trips. I remember one trip with --\nwith -- I mentioned to you, with my brother\u2019s grandmother, and then I came back and then I -- I\nmay have gone maybe once or twice, you know, because you were able -- you were allowed to\ngo in and out, you know, so you could make several trips before your domicile was empty and\nlooted, or whatever, so you were able to -- to do that. So I -- it may have been more than one trip,\nmaybe several trips, bringing in as much as a -- you know, could by -- but by that time you see,\nthere was no help, my brother was already in the camp, my -- my oldest was in the army, the\nRussian army. So there was just my father, Mose -- Genya, and -- and Helen, and then there was\nalso a cousin. My brother\u2019s sister\u2019s son, Chana Koch was her name, from Tomaszow. And so she\nwas -- she was with us too, and so she kind of -- and she also spoke Ukrainian, and she kind of\nlooked like a peasant, you know, with a kerchief. You did everything to hide your -- you know,\nyour identity, as 1t were. And you took a chance by taking your armband off, and -- which I did\nseveral times, just to be able to move around, you know, to be more -- more -- more free.

        "A: Can bring more in.",
        "A: Oh, that was basically you tried to -- my -- m-my father tried to find a place. You tried to -- to\nget into the ghetto and locate a place, and we found a place which 1s like a -- an old house where\nwe used a downstairs and another family used upstairs. These were homes that were vacated,\nobviously by -- by the residents who -- who, you know, ventured out for much better quarters,\nand it was a good deal, you know, a good swap for them. So there were a lot of them were just --\njust left, even with some of the -- some of the old furniture, or old cots, or old, you know, straw\nmats, you know, mattresses and stuff like that. So we find that -- you know, you find that place\nthat --",
        "A: Well, a --",
        "A: -- s-some of them were assigned.",
        "A: And some of them, you know, some were just open and you just -- you just -- you just went --\ngot in there and --",
        "A: -- and took it, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Some of it did, I think they probably -- they -- they -- they tried to assign a lot of the people,\nable bodied workers, you know, into si -- into quarters that they felt were easier to access in\nterms of getting in -- you know, to f -- to work and so forth. So there were some -- some of it was\nby the Judenrat and some of it was a -- just on your own. You Just tried to find whatever you\ncould on your own. Because, you see, there was still a lot of movement available, you know, if\nyou -- as long as you wore an armband at that time, you still could move. You could move into\nthe ci -- out and in -- out of the city and so forth. Now, you had to have papers where you could\nhave been stopped at any moment. If you didn\u2019t have papers you were -- you\u2019d have been taken\naway or shot or beaten up, or whatever. You had to have work papers. And the first thing that my\nfather did, being entrepreneurial as he was, he got some work papers. He never -- he didn\u2019t work,\nbut he got the pap -- papers, he paid for them. So he had always a work paper, you know. Ar --\nArbeitschein, you know. But he didn\u2019t work, no, no, he was able to get away with it.",
        "A: Well, s-sometimes when I -- when I wanted to carry something, or -- or -- or get something,\nyou know, like buy some -- some food or something, to be sure that I wasn\u2019t -- you know, that it\nwasn\u2019t taken away from me, I would take the armband off surreptitiously, and then once I was in\nthe ghetto, I would put it on again, you know. But I had to be very careful about that, you know.\nI mean, if I had been spotted by somebody doing that, I would have been in real trouble. But you\nknow, again, when you\u2019re young, you -- you -- you -- you\u2019re fearless in a way, you know. And to\nme it was -- was daring and I -- I -- I mean, I feel like every time I would take it off, I feel like I -\n- like I vanquished some -- you know, like I was getting even, as it were, you know? And I was\nproud of myself that I -- that I was able to do that, even though I was -- I was scared, obviously.\nSo -- and -- so these are carn -- now -- now there is -- now I\u2019m coming to a very, very traumatic\nexperience, which 1s our very first close call in the ghetto, if I may. One day, the door burst open,\na Ukrainian came in with his gun and said, \u201cCome with me.\u201d My father was away, he was doing\nsomething somewhere, was just Genya and Helen and I. Didn\u2019t allow to take anything with us,\nand was walking us to a transport. There was a railroad station Zamarstynowska, and we know\nby the direction that we are going to a transport [indecipherable] there were -- at that time that\nwas already starting to load people to wherever the destination they decided. He -- and he pulled\na gun, and with the gun he was walking us towards that. That was one time when I felt it was --\nwas the end, was the beginning of the end. Genya was holding Helen in her arms and started to\nspeak Ukrainian to the guard, and begging him to let us go. And she said, \u201cFor the fear of God,\nplease let us go. Look at this child in my arms, look at this young boy.\u201d She said, \u201cDo please let\nus go. We don\u2019t,\u201d -- you know, \u201cwhy -- why don\u2019t you do that?\u201d And then he spotted a gold\nwatch on Genya\u2019s wrist, and he took the -- the watch and he said, \u201cGo away.\u201d We were about\nmaybe 10 minutes away from the railroad station. Now that was one time when I cried, really\ncried, because I saw this poor Helen and Genya, and -- and I thought myself, what will my father\ndo when he comes home and we\u2019re gone? Cause this happened so often, you know, that a worker\nwould go, you know, to a -- to a camp, to a labor camp -- these were workshops, you know,\nwithin the ghetto. He would come home and -- and his family would be gone. He\u2019d never know -\n- you didn\u2019t know from one hour to the next. You didn\u2019t know whether you would come back\nfrom work. Because if you did something that they didn\u2019t like, didn\u2019t like the way you looked, or\nthe way this, that was it, you know, they took you away, or -- or you never -- you d -- you\ndisappeared. So this was one time when I really broke down. So there\u2019s one -- one of many close\ncalls. But this was one that was a -- that was our really first call, especially with that gun drawn,\nyou know, where we\u2019re facing, really facing -- and then we didn\u2019t even -- I didn\u2019t even know\nwhether he was going to shoot us on the way to, which he could have easily done, because there\nwere shootings all over, you know, I mean, it\u2019s almost like -- like hearing sirens, and the fire --\nfire engines in New York City when you live in Manhattan, you know, after a while you just --\nyou just hear it, and -- and you don\u2019t hear it, you know, the gunshots and -- and -- and -- and\nscreams, or whatever, you know. And -- so I thought -- I didn\u2019t know whether he was going to\neven bother with us -- taking us to the -- to the -- to the railroad station, to the yards, or whether\nhe was going to shoot us right on the way to. So that was really bad, that was really bad. That\nwas when I began to really, really began to feel the -- the -- the -- the depth of that -- of that -- of\nthat atrocity, the depth of that -- of that human degradation, you know? And that total feeling of\nhelplessness, you know, totally -- totally helpless, you know. Totally at the mercy of -- of -- of a\nwhim, of -- of a want, and you know, just as -- just -- just is -- 1s incredible when you think about\nit, you know? That you could just -- anybody -- anybody that could just do whatever they wanted\nwith you. Whatever they wanted. With no restraint. No restrictions. So the life in the ghetto, you\nknow, was -- was very hard. Food was very, very scarce, people were starving. My father, again,\nwas able to scrape up things. We did not -- maybe had one meal a day. Frozen potato peels were\nat a premium. Frozen potato peels. The things that were discarded, you know, by the -- by the\nrestaurants, or by the place, whatever, you know, by others. But we managed. We didn\u2019t starve to\ndeath. I'd -- I was, you know, hungry at times, but -- but I didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t really starve, per se,\nwhere I -- where I couldn\u2019t sleep because I was too hungry to sleep. And -- and then there was a\ntime, too, when my father establish a contact with a gentleman from Warsaw by the name of\nZaremba -- Zaremba, who would come into the ghetto, and he would trade with -- in gold and in\n-- and in gold coins and all that, because the people trying to -- to buy -- be able to buy food on\nthe black market, would sell whatever they could salvage of their personal jewelry, valuables,\ngold coins and sell it to [indecipherable]. So he would come into this -- to -- to -- into the ghetto,\nwas still wide open, and my father would do business with him, you know, by trading, and then\nin some ways helping those people to -- to get money to be able to buy things, and also, of\ncourse, trying to make some money for himself. So this Mr. Zaremba, that was the contact that\nI\u2019m using -- mention [indecipherable] advisory, because that has a tremendous impact on my\nfuture survival, as it were.",
        "A: Oh Genya, [indecipherable] be called as Genya, yeah.",

Just ya -- and saying\nto him, yeah I remember her say, \u201cBoitishe Bokha,\u201d have fear of God, and I was appealing to his\n-- whatever religious, you know -- and they were religious, ironically, very religious, the\nUkrainians. That was the Ukrainian or -- Catholic Orthodox church, Catholic church -- Orthodox\n-- somewhat Orthodox -- Eastern Orthodox. And saying, \u201cPlease, please, let us go.

        "A: There were -- well, there was the Judenrat, you know, and the -- and the Judenrat had a lot of\npeople working with them. And I guess, by virtue of their -- their work, which -- and I\u2019m not\ntrying to be critical now, I\u2019m just trying to say that -- that -- that they try -- they thought they\nwere helping, you know, and then since they weren\u2019t, they obviously had a more privileged\nstatus that the Germans didn\u2019t bother them. I mean they let them live, as it were, and they let\nthem maybe give them some rations of food or whatever, you know, a helper. And there were\nalso, of course, people that were well off. They had the monies to -- to obtain things in the black\nmarket. They had monies to maybe buy a -- a -- a labor permit like my father had, you know. On\nthe other hand there were many, many very poor ones, you know. I mean, the higher -- the -- the\nsocial structure of the Jews involved was typical of -- of -- of -- of social structures and maybe\neven like nowadays here at home in the States, there were -- they were not just merchants, they\nwere cobblers, they were tailors, they were -- and in street where I live, you know, there was a\nbaker across the street. There was a -- a -- a -- a -- a-- you know, a shoemaker. There was even --\neven one that -- that had a horse and buggy, you know, that -- they call them fiacres, you know,\nthey were -- they were like taxis, you know, horse -- horse drawn taxis, you know, the old type\nyou know with the -- that you see in Stanley Park, you know, in New York. And so there were\nall stratas. In fact, we even have a couple Jewish prostitutes that we knew of.",
        "A: In -- no, no, no, in L\u2019vov.",
        "A: In L\u2019vov. Now I-I\u2019m using this advisorly because -- because to -- to res -- to respond to your\nquestion about the strata of the social structure, there was -- there were all kinds of different\nstructures, unlike the small shtetls where you had only maybe a few merchants and maybe a\ncobbler or something. In the big cities they -- you had all classes of society, represented by the\nJews, which is not ba -- maybe that well known. So -- so as a result, these people who went into\nthe ghetto were obviously the same -- same groups, of social groups. And the ones that -- that --\nthat were poor obviously the ones -- the first ones to -- to -- too poor to die of -- of -- of -- of\nstarvation, of san -- poor sanitation, of lack of clothing. You know, winters can be very se -- very\nsevere in Poland, you know, it\u2019s got a severe, you know, si -- a kind of a -- you know, northern\nCanadian, if you will, climate, you know, like a climate of like a Winnipeg. Very, very below\nzero temperatures. In fact, I remember I got once frostbite, that was before the war, on my toes,\njust going to school and going back, because I -- because the school was closed and I insisted on\ngoing to school because I felt a sense of duty, I must go to school, I must go to school. My\nparents insisted I don\u2019t go, well sure enough I went and by the time I came back, I had frostbite\non two of my toes, you know, and I was sick for several days, you know, and long healing\nprocess. So -- so that what happened, you know, the -- the ones that were -- and of course many\n[indecipherable] of the young men, maybe some of the poor [indecipherable] Jewish police of\nthe ghetto, they felt that they could -- this is one -- there was one way of -- of also prolonging the\nsurvivals -- prolonging the -- the -- the -- the way of life, or trying to, you know, trying to -- to --\nto manage not to be sent away. So they were [indecipherable] they were policemen that they --\nthey used -- that they used by the Germans as Jewish police to keep order or carry out, you\nknow, some of the orders that the Germans used, especially in rounding up people, you know, for\n-- for the labor camps and checking documents and so forth.",
        "A: They were not liked in the ghetto. No, they\u2019re definitely not liked in the ghetto at all. In fact, I\nwould say probably most of them were hated. Because they were -- they were -- they saw them\ndoing the kind of things that -- that they were and -- and I don\u2019t think -- th-they were hated. They\nwere basically hated, I\u2019m sure. And I -- and I\u2019m su -- I\u2019m sure many of them thought they were\ndoing good things, th-they -- they were helping, like the Judenrat, you know? But in the end of it,\nthey didn\u2019t, obviously. They didn\u2019t help, no, nothing helps. Nothing helped.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that was generally -- I think that the feeling was that the Judenrat was -- was\ntrying to help, but I don\u2019t think that they were -- they were thinking that they were doing any\ngood, per se. From what I know my -- my father didn\u2019t have a very high opinion of the Judenrat.\nHe felt that they were just -- just being a mouthpiece for the Germans, or you know, trying to\nkeep things together. And so historically one could argue that perhaps they did help, you know,\nin some ways to prolong the -- the -- the agony as it were, you know.",
        "A: Well, that -- ? ve been thinking about that all, and you know, I came to the conclusion that --\nthat a lot -- some of them just -- just trying to survive did some very unspeakable things. Can you\nblame them for it? I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what I could really say that they did it on\npurpose. They did it because they -- they felt that that --as that was one way of surviving. And\none of the things that I remember my father commenting about some of the Jewish police -- I\ndidn\u2019t see it myself, but commenting, that actually they would, in rounding up old people, those\nare the priorities, getting the old and the sick and get ri -- getting rid of them. That he actually\nsaw it himself, that they were actually taking their parents and marching them off because they\nwere told to round up old people and so forth. And that was -- I\u2019m sure that was not done a lot.\nWas an aberration, but it only was a -- it was an example of -- of what can be done, how -- you\nknow, to -- to the psyche of a human under -- under these terrible conditions, you know.

You know, when this happens day after day after day after day, it\nwears and it becomes a -- almost a way of life, you know, you -- you -- you feel hunted and\nhaunted and so I saw that, you know. I -- I mean there was -- certainly there wasn\u2019t ever any kind\nof humor, or any kind of -- of -- of -- of what shall I say, feeling of relax -- of relaxation in any\nway, everything was tense. The air was tense, and -- and because the ghetto was open, you see, it\nwas open to everybody to go in and out, in fact the streetcar was going all the way to the end of\nthe line, which I used later on when I left the ghetto, and -- so anybody could come in, you know,\nand they -- and you looked and you didn\u2019t know who was who. Obviously people who -- the\nJews wore -- wore armbands, but when you ra -- walked the street and you ran into somebody\nwithout one, who was that person?

You -- yo-you -- you walk to -- you know, you try to -- to\navoid that -- that person. So it was just a -- a kind of a -- a feeling of siege, a feeling of a -- a\nsiege mentality, okay? With hunger, with -- with -- you know, and -- and -- and one of the things\nthat I -- I saw 1s a lot of the -- of the hearses, you know, that that -- you saw a lot of that horse\ndrawn -- cause they were collecting bodies. And that, of course, that did it to Jews who worked\non the -- so you saw that, and that be -- that was a common scene. You know, you turn the\ncorner, you walk the street and there was an-another one hearse, and -- and a -- maybe another\none somewhere else. So you saw that, you know, and -- but -- but as far as overt mistreating per\nse, I did not see that.",
        "A: Well, my mood was basically one of -- of -- of anger, some fear.

And there there was a quarry where my brother George was working in a -- with a group of\nother inmates, and as I said before, he -- by hand, you know, they were actually breaking up\nboulders and stones and crushing them to create the -- the -- the gravel for the -- for the roads\nbecause that\u2019s what the -- the Germans were always trying to keep their roads, you know, going,\nyou know, for the -- for the armies, for the -- the troops and for the -- and so forth. So he was\nthere, you know, and that was -- that was a terrible sight to see these men who were not -- you\nknow, not even used to this hard physical labor, you know, they were -- to be able to all day\nlong, can you imagine all day long standing there and -- and with hammers breaking -- breaking\nstones with very little breaks, you know, maybe four minutes at a time. And like eight or 10\nhours a day, you know. So many died, you know, my -- my -- my George relates the -- the -- the\nfact that many who couldn\u2019t -- who were weak, you know, or cou -- or wou -- couldn\u2019t -- you\nknow, couldn\u2019t make it, you know, were just shot and so I remember that, so that\u2019s why we got\nthe food and that was -- that helped them a lot. But then -- course when I -- when I left, and of\ncourse when they would -- they wouldn\u2019t allow food later on and he made some contacts with\nsome local peasants where he -- they were helping him out a little bit too, but -- but he had a\nvery, very rough time of it. He had typhoid fever in the camp, he was almost shot because of\nthat. There was an outbreak of typhoid fever, which kind of decimated the camp that he was in\nand they brought in new people into the camp.

        "A: At that time it wasn\u2019t that dangerous because the ghetto was still open, there was still a lot of\ncommunication. And when I brought the food, at that time the guards allowed food.

And -- and you can imagine what the other -- when they saw\nfood, what happened. Of course my brother would share some of it with them, too, you know,\nbecause they were -- everybody was hungry there. They gave them food but obviously nowhere\nnear enough for the physical exertion and the fill of hard labor. I mean you -- just incredible\nwhen you -- just the sight of those poor -- poor people doing that. It was just like a deliberate\nway of -- of, you know, of killing them with -- with -- with -- with forced labor, because how\nmuch could they accomplish, you know, by -- by breaking up stones, you know, manually, you\nknow, I mean there\u2019s just a -- we just -- but they did, you know, and they -- they built the roads\nand -- and my brother eventually ended up on a -- on a steamroller, you know, and so forth, he\u2019s\na -- he has his own story to tell about that.",

        "A: -- and I just watched him eat, which took very little time, believe me, you know, he just\ngulped it down, practically. And then I would just bring it back and I was able to do it a few\ntimes. I think maybe no more than maybe three or four times.",
        "A: Yeah, oh, no, no, no, it wasn\u2019t an ongoing thing, no, you couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t do that.",

I feel sorry for -- I p -- feel badly for my -- I\nmean from one trip to the next, I didn\u2019t even know whether he would survive, you know,\nwhether I would see him again.",
        "A: Cause you didn\u2019t know. And then the -- and then they had occasions when they were\nmarching back to the camp from the day\u2019s work, sometimes they would get stopped, and at\nrandom they would pick out some of these and -- and shoot them. In fact, they had a -- they --\nthey -- one of those camp com -- commandants had a rule that for every inmate that tried to\nescape, even if he was caught, they would sic -- shoot six -- six of -- of the -- of the -- of the\ninmates in the camp, and that\u2019s -- so -- so that happened too, and he almost got shot, so -- so he --\nhe had a really tough time of it, but he managed just to survive.",
        "A: Okay, okay, now my father obviously realized, you know, that something -- that how -- how\nwe -- how are we going to survive, you know. He didn\u2019t know what -- what -- you know, he tried\nto work out something. Escaping from the ghetto was impossible. Even when there was open,\nyou know, there was no way. He couldn\u2019t do it himself because he would be immediately\nrecognized as being a Jew. Genya wouldn\u2019t leave my father. And so he came upon this idea, and\none morning he said -- he prepared, you know, getting prepared a little backpack, and he sa --\nand he gave me a birth certificate in Latin, with the name of Mieczyslaw Wereszczyszyn. And he\nsaid, \u201cYou take this, you go to the railroad station, you buy a ticket for Warsaw, and you\u2019re\ngoing to go to Mr. Zaremba\u2019s apartment.\u201d So he did arrange with Mr. Zaremba, the business\nassociate of his to -- for me to at least get to him. Whether he was -- I was going to stay with him\nor not I didn\u2019t know that, but that was the address he gave me in Warsaw.",
        "A: There was absolutely no preparation, no, my father wasn\u2019t like that, he said, hey, this is it. He\ndidn\u2019t ask me am I afraid to go, or -- or what to do. He said, this is what you have to do, this 1s\nwhat you do. And he obtained this birth certificate, I guess, on the black market, whatever it was.\nIt looked very, very authentic, as it will be evident later on from my -- from my talk here. And --\nand that\u2019s what I did. I remember taking that little backpack. He gave me enou -- gave me money\nfor the railroad ticket. Then he told me that in my jacket there was a sewn in gold coin, the\npurpose of which I didn\u2019t know exactly what he wanted for, but I realized later on what it was\nfor. And I remember taking the backpack, and we were on a -- a -- our ghetto was on a street\ncalled Sienna, S-1-e-n-n-a, Sienna Street. And just about two blocks away was the last stop of the\nstreetcar, and that was like in the spring of \u201942, I don\u2019t know exactly the date, but it was before\nthe ghetto was closed, you know. I believe the ghetto was closed in August, I believe, of \u201942,\nright? That was before then. It was a nice day, warm day. And I remember before I turned the\ncorner, I took off my armband and threw it away, jumped on the streetcar and went straight to the\nrailroad station. Bought a ticket for Warsaw. Nobody questioned, there was a lot of movement\nthere, I mean, you know. After all, you\u2019re not a li -- little baby when you\u2019re 13 year old, you\u2019re a\nyoung boy. And I got on the train and went towards Warsaw. And this is when I had my second\nclose call, very, very close call. As we were riding on the train, all of a sudden the train was\nstopped. It was somewhere near Lublin, which is a city in the Lublin province, okay? Everybody\nout. The whole train was emptied out. And here were the Germans, SS with some civilians,\nsetting up a table. Everybody out? Everybody in line? And everybody show documents. And\nthen they would say left and right. Right were older people, women with documents, Poles,\nUkrainians, you name it, whatever. Maybe even some civilian Germans who were let go right\naway. On the left they [indecipherable] some young men -- many young men. And then I heard\nthe murmur, the talk among those that this another one of those round-ups for Polish workers\nthat the Germans periodically would grab to send them to their factories, wherever it was,\nwhether it\u2019s in Poland or Germany or any place, to work in their factories because they were\nshort of manpower, because everybody was in the -- on the -- you know, in the army, the\nGerman army. So I had no choice, I had to go in. So I showed my -- my birth certificate, he\nlooked at me, left. I guess they felt that I was old enough to maybe be a worker, too. I was in\ngood shape. So, what\u2019s next then? Okay, I asked around, they said well -- one of the guys said,\nwhat they do is they take you into a staging area overnight and in the morning you go to a public\nbath because they want to -- to delouse you, as they called it, you know, before you go anywhere\nelse, you know, and so forth. And then you -- and then they ship you out. And these guys, you\nknow, they didn\u2019t care, they were Poles you know, so they were -- some of them had -- had\nvodka with them and this and that, you know, and there were -- there were [indecipherable] say\nwell, that\u2019s what we have to do, we have to ta -- these are the ones that obviously didn\u2019t have any\npapers, working papers. So I spend a kind of a sleepless night because I knew that if I went to a\npublic bath my anatomy would immediately betray me and that would be the end of it, the end of\nit. Whether they would have informed on me, or whether they would just kick me out you know,\nand -- but the guards were there, you know, they were -- they obviously didn\u2019t want anybody to\nrun away. So in the morning, as we were -- and I left my backpack behind, of course, because\nyou would -- after the bath you would go back to the camp again, right, and then from there they\nwould transport you and load you on a train and wherever they -- you know, they ship. So as we\nwere walking towards the bathhouse, and I thought okay, here is the end of that, right? At the\nbathhouse, one of the guys, he said, \u201cRun away, run away.\u201d Because they kind of -- there was\nanother guard, there was one of the people there, because I was the kid, I was the youngest, there\nwas nobody in my age in that group. In fact, I guess they probably thought what is he doing\nhere? You know, I mean, this young kid doesn\u2019t belong. And one of the Ukrainian guards kind of\n-- was turned his back -- and this was a busy area, and the guy says, \u201cGo, run away.\u201d And I just\nran. And I ran right across the street, left my -- my -- my backpack, still had my ticket wa -- on\nme, fortunately I didn\u2019t leave it in my backpack. And went on the next train, continued to\nWarsaw. You know, when you think about it -- when I think about it, 1t just seems unreal. Just\nunreal. And then on the train --",

I thought myself, this is it. I had\nto do that. You know, cause I was still -- I didn\u2019t do it on my own, I was kind of encouraged, I\nsay hey, run, go, go, go, go. It was -- I mean, I had no choice because -- because I\u2019m sure that if I\n-- if -- if they had discovered, there were enough of them whoever it was that would -- would\nhave informed on me. Some may -- would have not, maybe some would have just, you know,\nsaid tha -- but somebody sure would have, cause there were just too many of them not to have at\nleast one or two that would have said, hey this -- this Jewish kid, you know, he -- he da -- has no\nright to live, you know, I mean, kill him. I had no choice. When you have no choice you just do\nit.",

        "A: -- you know, on me. And I\u2019m --",
        "A: -- on a train to Warsaw. And then I\u2019m in -- on the train to Warsaw, and I sit in this -- in this --\nin this cabin, you know, there was like -- on the train. And that was pretty crowded. And then\nthere was this woman looking at me sort of askance. She didn\u2019t know what to make of me, you\nknow, she thought, you know. So she asked me, cross yourself. Now, this not a simple thing.\nMost Jewish kids wouldn\u2019t know how to do it, even, or if they did it they wouldn\u2019t do it right. I\nhappened to have known how to do that. Because in Poland what you have to do is you have go\nthis, this, this, this and this. You have to close your hands. Just going this way is not enough.\nThis is how you do it, you go this way and that. And left and right, not right and left, to cross\nyourself. So I did that. And I guess she thought, well if this kid were Jewish, he wouldn\u2019t be\ndoing that, you know. They have these -- these ideas, you know, that a Jew on penalty of death\nmaybe wouldn\u2019t cross himself, you know, because I [indecipherable] you know. But any rate, I\ndid that, and that was it, so she just let go. So that was, you know, another one of those incidents.\nSo I arrive in Warsaw on a beautiful, warm day. Big Warsaw railroad station. Big sign in\nGerman, wheels must turn for victory.",
        "A: Oh yeah, that was a very common slogan. \u201cRader mussen rollen ftir den Sieg,\u201d you know.\nAnd then another big sign saying, \u201cDeutschlands Sieg an allen Fronten.\u201d Deutsch -- German\nvictory on all fronts. Okay? So I go out there, busy, busy Warsaw. And as I turn the corner, I see\nplacards, which I never saw before, in Polish. Any person hiding, harboring or abetting, or\nfacilitating a Jew is punishable by death. That was the first time that I ever saw this, I never saw\nthis in L\u2019vov. I guess they wa -- didn\u2019t need the -- the -- you know, it was to [indecipherable |\nthere, you know. So that was -- that\u2019s the way I -- that was my greeting in Warsaw just -- just as\nsoon as I turned the corner, without any backpack and so forth. And I knocked on the door of the\nZarembas and of course they took me in. And they knew I was coming. And I stayed with the\nZarembas for about two or three days. And I didn\u2019t know what to expect. But there\u2019s one thing I\ndid instinctively. I gave them the gold coin. Because it crossed my mind that I couldn\u2019t do\nanything with it, and it -- I -- it crossed my mind that my father probably did that on purpose, he\ndidn\u2019t tell me to do that, to give them -- give him the gold coin, maybe in payment or -- or just --\njust to reward him for the fact that he took it upon himself for me to -- to see him, you know, to -\n- because after all, it was very dangerous you know, for anybody to -- you know, this Mr.\nZaremba, his wife was -- was known as a Volksdeutscher. Now, do you know what that 1s?",
        "A: Volksdeutscher was a category that the Germans established for any Poles that had German\nancestry, that had any kind of German ca -- German -- in their blood, so to speak. So they were\nkind of folk Germans. They were given special privileges, status, you know, preferential work\nand all that. So she was a Volksdeutscher and they often had German visitors because of that.\nSometimes army people, military. It seems to me -- and I was never told this -- that they were a\nlittle bit concerned about me, since people that they knew they had no children. All of a sudden,\nwho 1s this kid? What\u2019s this kid doing here? I don\u2019t know for sure, but Zaremba had a plan for\nme, and within about three or four days, he introduced me to a new life in Warsaw.\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: Wasn\u2019t very hard. Th-They lived right near the railroad station, and Ij -- I just asked\nsomebody, you know, in the street as to where it is and they just pointed it out to me and so forth.",
        "A: Because I didn\u2019t have any luggage with me, and so I was like a kid, maybe they thought I was\non an errand, or I was --",
        "A: -- picking something up, whatever, you know. So I went to the Zaremba, fortunately they\nwere home, you know, I knocked on the door and there they were.",
        "A: They were friend -- oh yes, they were very nice, very warm people. Of course, Zaremba knew\nmy father, she -- she met me -- his wife met me for the first time --",
        "A: -- she was really nice. They had no children, and they had German visitors in uniform and\n[indecipherable] and of course Zaremba took advantage of this by, you know, doing all kinds of\nblack marketeering and stuff. But I don\u2019t f -- I didn\u2019t feel that comfortable. I wa -- not so much I\nwas af -- afraid, it\u2019s just the proximity of them, you know, really bothered me. I -- I just didn\u2019t\nwant to -- didn\u2019t want to be in the same room, you know, as it were, you know, and all this, with\ntheir -- you know, drinking and talking and then the -- all that, you know, and so forth. And\nenjoying their victories, you know, and the -- and the -- etcetera. So --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No, I -- I -- I [indecipherable] I did knew German quite well, you know, even though I was a\nkid, which be -- which will be interesting comment Ill make later on about -- about how I had to\ncurtail my German. But -- so about -- oh, about three days or four days, he took me to this place\nwhich was a workshop, a little plant by the name of Boleslaw Konarski, I mention the address,\nand I'll spell it later. And introduced me as a distant relative\u2019s son, a half-orphan from the\nprovince of Tarnopol -- cause that\u2019s where my birth certificate, and he knew about the birth\ncertificate -- who wants to learn a trade. Who wants to learn a trade, you know. Now it was very\ncommon to have orphans or kids that didn\u2019t go to high school to learn a trade. And the way it\nworked was that you actually lived on the premises, you ate and slept on the premises, and you\nworked on the premises. And I slept on a loft with a couple of other kids about my age, and I was\nput to work. Now, Polish which was perfect was a L\u2019vov Polish. And the L\u2019vov Polish dialect\nwas very much divided by the Warsaw people. It was sort of analogous to let\u2019s say a Chicago\nEnglish versus Brooklyn English, okay? With Warsaw English being clipped, sort of you know,\nshort and clipped, whereas as you know the Brooklyn is the singsong and all those yishes, and all\nthat. So they kind of identified almost the -- the L\u2019vov Polish with Jews, with Jewish Poles. And\nI caught this right away, they -- where they kind of started to kind of laugh at me, you know,\nthey -- there\u2019s some jokes about that in Polish about the -- about the L\u2019vov dialect. And this was\na dialect spoken not only by -- by, you know, lower classes, was just a -- a typical, you know,\neven -- even in the -- you know, in New York, a good New York English is not like a -- like a\nMidwestern English, even -- even the -- you know, among the intellectuals. So I had to quickly\nlearn the Warsaw dialect. I was very conscious of that, I was very concerned because I knew I\nwou -- I was afraid that they may question that, that I may have -- you know. And my biggest,\nbiggest problem was again being circumcised. That preyed on my mind virtually 24 hours a day,\nbecause when you live with young -- wa -- other boys, you know, and you associate with them,\nand you -- and you -- and you there, you know, boys tend to play games, you know. They\u2019d hi --\nsometimes they compare anatomies, you know, and all that. And I was very, very concerned\nabout that because the minute that would happen, you know, I -- I often thought to myself, what\nwould they do if they were to discover -- what would they -- what would they do. And I didn\u2019t\nthink that they would inform on me because they were very, very pate -- you know, Poles were\nvery anti-German. But they would definitely kick me out, you know. I mean, they would not kick\nme, because I mean, they could be all killed for that, you know. Or maybe some of them --\nmaybe some of the, you know, workers would actually maybe even inform on me, because we\nlived in this place where there were -- at first there were three apprentices, and there were four\njourneymen as they called them. These are the foremen, the journeymen, th-the ones that the --\nthat they knew their trade and all that. And was hard to tell among them, who -- who would be,\nyou know, who would be the one that would actually -- would actually denounce me or -- to the -\n- to the authorities being Jewish. So that was constantly on my mind, and I was very concerned\nabout that. And fortunately I -- I -- we never got into that. You know, I ended up with -- with\nonly one. There were two more boys, and there was one -- one apprentice by the name of Janek.\nAnd he was kind of, you know, h-he -- he -- he was a little bit of a -- how shall I say? Quiet and -\n- and not so outgoing. So I -- we never had occasion to [indecipherable]. We slept in the same --\non the same loft, and -- and we worked, you know. And the -- the place of work -- what they\nmanufactured there, or manufactured was rawhide harnesses for the utility workers on -- on\npoles, you know, they climbed the poles. Rawhide harnesses. Was very, very hard work, you\nknow, to si -- you had to sew it by hand. They were -- they used underarm holsters for the secret\npolice. That was one of the jobs too, that they had to -- to -- to work on. All kinds of bags, and\nwallets and this kind of stuff, okay. The owners lived on the sa -- everything was on one level,\nyou know, the owners, their qua -- you know, their bedroom, their workshop and everything was\non the same level. And not too long after I started there, because of my age, 13 years old, I was\ngoing to be 14 in the fall, there was a law that you had to get a Kennkarte. A Kennkarte means in\nGerman -- Kenn is to know, and karte was like ai -- I.D. na -- I.D. card, okay? And you had to\ngo to the local authorities to pick it up, to the police, to the Gestapo, you know. So what do you\ndo now? I had no choice, I had to go. I couldn\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t -- I\u2019m not going to go. I didn\u2019t\nknow what they were doing there, whether they had suspi -- you know, whether they were\nscreening people for the -- for the -- for the -- and I went. I showed them my birth certificate, I\ntold them I was working for the firm of Boleslaw Konarski. Boom, I got a Kennkarte. So here I\nwas officially now an official Aryan. No phony, no, no, you know [indecipherable] I was\nofficially an Aryan, no more Jewish, you know, right? Except for my anatomy I was no more\nJewish. And living in Warsaw at that time, I encountered a number of things -- that was even\nbefore -- before the following year, before the ghetto. In other words, when you\u2019re on the streets\nof Warsaw -- after work, you know, I and this kid, we were just roaming around, you know, and\nso forth. They had these -- the police was walking down the street and they would periodically\nstop people and ask for I.D.s and round-ups. And what they were looking for basically is\nundocumented Poles. They were looking also for resistance because Warsaw already had a\nstrong resistance movement at that time. And of course they\u2019re looking for Jews, or people that\nwere trying to escape, Jews who tried to -- to -- to escape from the ghetto, who were -- were out\nof the ghetto. And what they would do is -- oh, and incidentally, in addition to those placards\nwhich said harboring a Jew, you know, is -- 1-it would be death penalty, they had placards\nshowing how to identify a Jew. And they were showing -- presumably that was all developed by\n-- by this -- I think it was Rosenberg was the German guy who pr -- who apparently claimed that\nthere are certain anatomical features in the Jewish face which are 100 percent Jewish, okay? By\nvirtue of the shape of the nose, by virtue of the shape of the ears. By some bone structure, by the\ncranial structure, whatever it was, with very elaborate charts, you know, as to how to identify the\nJews. And that was done in Polish, so that Poles who were inclined to do so, you know, would be\n-- or Ukrainians, whoever it was -- and there were a lot of Estonians and Latvians too at that\ntime, cause they were the guards of the -- many of them were guards of the ghetto, would be able\nto identify a Jew and maybe report him to the -- to the Germans, who would be very grateful for\nit, \u2019m sure, you know. So that was another thing. So what they would do 1s as they were walking\ndown the streets, and they were -- have these quick round-ups. If the -- 1f somebody looks\nsuspicious, you know, a -- a male, of course, they would take him around the corner and let him\ndrop his pants, you know, to check to see whether he was circumcised. Now circumcision was\nlike a hundred percent giveaway in Poland, which is very hard to understand here, because I\nmean we know that -- and I -- I-I know the trend today is maybe not to do it as much, but I know\nthat virtually -- and especially the United States, I mean, mer -- many hun -- millions of men are\ncircumcised, of whatever background, wha -- you know, right? Whether it\u2019s Muslim or ca -- or\nCatholic, Protestant and so forth. In Poland, this was not done. In fact, I remember hearing a\nstory that if someone who was not Jewish was circumcised, had to have some iron proof\ndocumentation that for medical reasons, and whatever -- I don\u2019t know whether that person, you\nknow, ever -- how he -- how they -- they managed to sur -- to -- to live, you know, to have -- to\nprove that -- that he was not Jewish, because that was -- they would -- there was no questions\nasked, you know. I mean, that was it. Was kind of ironical. In fact, in fact, I heard of cases where\nsome Jewish men tried to go through surgery to create some kind of false foreskin, or enlarge the\nskin, which always failed, you know, in order to hide the fact they were circumcised. You may\nhave heard about that. So that was another fact, and now come April 1943, the ghetto uprising in\nWarsaw. And I was not far from the ghetto in terms of -- of being able to actually see the smoke\nand the shooting. And sometimes I would see a column of me -- of people, of Jews from the\nghetto being marched out for -- obviously to be taken somewhere to a transport, to a\nconcentration camp. And I believe that lasted for about three or four, three weeks or so, when the\nghetto was obviously destroyed, and -- and that wa -- that made a tremendous impact on me, I\nmean I was -- I kind of felt helpless. I -- I felt -- that was when I really felt a sense of great guilt,\nthat here I was, you know, on the outside, you know, and I was getting away with it, and here\nwere these people [indecipherable] they were fighting for their lives and so forth, there was\nnothing I could do about it. I mean, I certainly wasn\u2019t brave enough, or thinking that I would just\nrun into the ghetto and join them, you know. That would have tote -- it would have been -- you\nknow, I mean I -- you had to try to survive, you know, and tha -- and that was my fortune that I\nwas able to be on the other side, even though not knowing what the next day would bring for me,\nyou know. So that was very bad, that was -- that was -- and we knew about it actually, you know,\nthat was known that it was a ghetto uprising, even though there wasn\u2019t much talked about it\nwhere I worked, you know. But peop -- that -- you know, there wa -- it was known that there was\nan uprising in the ghetto.",
        "A: Yes, I did know about it. I did know about a death camp of Auschwitz, because -- because the\nson of the ow -- well, the woman who was -- of the -- of the firm, she was a common law wife of\nthis -- this master of the shop. Her son was actually a Pole. He was in -- he was in Auschwitz for\na short while, they had a section for non-Jews, you know, near -- near ausch -- Auschwitz. And\nhe was -- he came back from Auschwitz, and he mentioned that Auschwitz was, you know, there\nwas a concentration camp in Auschwitz, and so on, so he did talk about that, about -- briefly\nabout his experiences. And he said, \u201cOh, there\u2019s a lot of Jews there, s -- they\u2019re getting all\nkilled,\u201d you know, but -- yeah.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh absolutely.",
        "A: Absolutely. But I didn\u2019t -- he -- he just mentioned that in general, you know. So I -- I knew, I\nknew. By that time I already knew -- knew about that there\u2019s a -- there was a concentration camp\nin Auschwitz.",

        "A: Almost a year, exactly, exactly, I was there.",
        "A: I felt safer in the sense that I was kind of established there.",
        "A: You know, that I was -- I was accepted, and of course I was -- I was part of that -- of that -- of\nthat ambience. I would go to church, you know, I -- I -- I -- my -- this kid who -- who was with\nme, Janek, you know, we learned how to skip confession, you know, when -- cause the woman,\nshe was very, very religious, so she was chase us out, you know, always to go to church on\nSunday. So we went in and out, you know, cause a kid was not interested. And when the time\nwas for confession we would go to the -- pretend like to the confession, we found a booth that\nwasn\u2019t occupied, so we pretended like we are at the -- you know, doing confe -- going into\nconfession, kneeling there, you know, and then after a little while, you know, cro -- go up, cross\nourselves, and -- and leave, you know. So -- so I was kind of accepted as part of the -- of that --\nof that working family, as it were. But -- but I was always, always, always concerned about\ndiscovery. I wa -- that was always on my mind. Why\u201d Because -- because there were the -- the\ncustomers who came in, there were a lot of secret police guys that came in to pick up holsters,\nthere were -- and -- and -- and they saw me working, you know, and all that. And you never\nknew who would kind of look at me and say wait a minute, this kid looks more like -- he must be\nJewish, or something like that. You know, or he looks Jewish, or -- even though I really didn\u2019t,\nyou know. But who knows, you know, I mean you -- you never knew that, what would happen.\nSo -- so I was -- there\u2019s always that -- that lingering concern, as it were, on my mind you know,\nand fear as well, that I may be discovered. But of course, I had a much easier time of it than --\nthan like -- than say my brother was in the -- in the camp, you know, so I was -- felt -- felt in\nsome ways fortunate that -- you know, that I was where I was, you know --",

And with ke -- you know, I\nlived on the -- you know, in -- in the loft there, and that was dark, you know, and we would\nclimb up the ladder and go to -- go to sleep. You know, you don\u2019t -- when you\u2019re young you\ndon\u2019t sleep tha -- you don\u2019t need that much sleep, so it was very late, usually in the evening, and\n-- and so forth, and I -- and then on Sundays we were free, and -- and I remember one incidence\nwhich reminds me that one of the friends of this -- this owner of the firm, by the name of\nBoleslaw Konarski was the owner, he -- she ran the business, only he was kind of a -- an\nalcoholic, you know, would go on two, three day binges, was away, you know. And then would\ncome back home with -- you know, with -- with no -- penniless and all that. And one of his\nfriends once came in, I believe, and he made a comment in Polish what really scared me. He\nsays, \u201cHe must be -- he must be part Jewish,\u201d to this Boleslaw Konarski. Just like that. He 1s\nfrom a Jew, in Polish, he said. [indecipherable] he must be somewhat from a Jew. He didn\u2019t say I\nwas Jewish, but maybe from a Jew. And then Boleslaw said, oh come on, no, no. Do not be\nridiculous. Something like that. That was the end of that. That was another true incident. I still\nremember the way the words that he used. I think he is a little bit of a -- from a Jew. But other\nthan that -- and then -- so these sights in Warsaw were very, very, very bad, you know, they --\nthey -- they -- this whole idea of a -- of -- just constant round-ups of people. But life went on,\nyou know, and Warsaw is a very, very busy city. And then I befriended a family who are\nrelatives of the owner of this -- of this -- of this pl -- workshop. There was a family of four\ndaughters living ap -- in a small, little village outside of Warsaw, on the other side of the Vistula,\non the roo -- east bank of the Vistula, near Praga. Praga was basically part of Warsaw, it was --\nit\u2019s called Praga, not Prague, Czechoslovakia, Praga. Was like part of the Warsaw, but that was\ncalled Praga, which was the -- was one side of the -- of the river. And there was one -- one of the\ndaughters who I was very smitten with, she was about two, three years older.",
        "A: Danka, Danielle, Danka, exactly. And -- and I guess that saved me -- saved my life, that my\nknowledge of Danka will save my life, too. Because I would visit them occasionally on -- on\nSundays I would go out there with the commuter railroad, maybe a 15 minute trip. And the\nfather, he was a carpenter, and there were four daughters. And I [indecipherable] I befriended her\nand we were very friendly and I was -- so I would stay there for the day, some days overnight\nand take a very early -- early commuter back into the city. And I think this was going on for\nabout maybe six, seven months and one weekend, one weekend -- not weekend, but it was a sun\n-- I think it was late Saturday maybe, I was able to get away. I was there, and the next day the\nPolish uprising broke out in Warsaw. Here I am again, no belongings, no clothing, just visiting\nthis family. No way to get back to Warsaw because it was the uprising, was the Polish uprising.\nWas a massive, massive uprising in August of 1944. Huge uprising. The city was just -- I mean,\noh my God, I mean it was tremendous -- you could actually hear it, even 10 - 12 miles away, you\ncould hear the explosion and -- and so forth. And the Russians were not -- nearby. They weren\u2019t\nvery far at all. Now as you know, what happened in the Polish uprising was that it lasted for\nabout two months. It was totally destroyed. Warsaw the city was destroyed. The population was\nevacuated. And if I had stayed in Warsaw, who knows what would have happened? I would have\nmaybe run into the same business of being taken somewhere and wo -- to a work camp, maybe\ngoing to another bathhouse, or who the hell knows what, you know. Or killed maybe in the\nuprising itself, cause it was a very massive uprising. Tens of thousands you know, of -- of\nunderground force there. But we were just observers from th -- you know, from the suburbs, as --\nyou know. And this co -- this oh -- this -- this father of that family, by the name of Bozym was\nhis last name, B-o-z - dot - y-m, Bozym. There was an field artillery unit, a German field artillery\nunit camped right in that little village up the hill to [indecipherable] farm. You know, what they\nwould do, they would just -- wherever they want they just took over a farm, killed the -- the --\nyou know, confiscated the -- the -- the -- the livestock you know, and butchered it for their own\nuse, and so on. So they a -- took over the farm. And Mr. Bozym was a [indecipherable] that was\nlooking for work obviously, to do something, and that field artillery unit needed some repairs to\nbe made on their -- some of their storage equipment, whatever it was. And he took with me as an\nassistant, an apprentice. Not apprentice, but an assistant. So we worked there for a few days\nwhile this was still going on in Warsaw. And we worked a circular saw. Equipment was very\nrusty. There was no guard on the circular saw at all. And I had a narrow piece of wood which I\nwas trying to cut and I cut off half of my finger on it. Okay? And the blade clo -- was so close to\nthis, I almost lost a second finger, too. Cut my finger and I was bleeding. So the German who\nwas in charge, the staff -- staff sergeant there, grabbed one of -- grabbed a -- a car, and took me -\n- and they asked one of the s-soldiers there to take me to the field hospital, which was only about\nmaybe a mile away, th-the German field hospital, because that finger was still hanging on it, you\nknow, it wasn\u2019t cut off completely, just hanging, just by the skin. So here I am in the German\nfield hospital with all these wounded from the f -- the front was nearby -- wounded, and I was\nsitting there waiting cause there were m -- there were priorities, you know, there were people\nwith li -- you know, all kinds of, you know, with -- with si -- major operations and all that, and I\nwas waiting my turn. So they looked at me, they grabbed me because this German said, well this\nis a Polish worker that worked those -- and they cut off the rest of that finger, and they dropped\nmy pants because they gave me a shot. You know, it was a form of either antibiotic, or\nsomething, for just a minute. And I was turned away from the guy who gave me the shot, you\nknow, just on that side. And here I am again, exposed, you know. Is somebody watching over\nme? I don\u2019t believe it. Somebody else might be -- feel that way. At any rate -- so I was all\nbandaged up, you know, and went back. And -- and this was something that\u2019s very, very hard to\nbelieve, but when I went back, and I reported back to the -- that -- to th-that German place, this\nguy asked me to wait. He was the -- the -- his name was Gabe Reuter -- Gabe Reuter.\n[indecipherable] meister Gabe Reuter. He was a field artillery staff commandant. And he gave\nme this piece of paper. Of course, I st -- I knew German. And I'll translate for you that piece of\npaper and you won\u2019t believe what it says. It said in it, the Polish worker Mieczyslaw\nWereszczyszyn was injured while working for our unit, and he intends after his recovery, to join\nthe German army as a -- as a volunteer. As a volunteer. Now here [indecipherable] nice Jewish\nkid from -- from L\u2019vov, you know, volunteering into the German army, right? Now he did that as\na big favor to me, because he felt by having this piece of paper, I will be able to get some, you\nknow, privileges, you know, I would maybe get some bread or something. He was -- he just tha -\n- totally on his own. I certainly wouldn\u2019t have asked him for it. Would never even occurred to\nme. I didn\u2019t even know there was such a thing as being able to volunteer into the German army,\nbut maybe by that time they were desperate for volunteers because, you know, the front was\nmoving, they were moving, moving, moving, you know, west. So here I have this document,\nnow -- now I\u2019m a real, true Aryan with a -- with a -- with a Kennkarte, you know, and on top of\nthat, I have this document that says here is a live wire for the German army, you know. And\nactually th-that did help me. I was able to get some bread from some of the German youths,\ncause we were scrounging for food, and I would show it, and I -- and I wore this for a long, long\ntime, even after I was healed pretty much, I still wore this, you know, in a kind of, you know, in\na sling, as a -- you know, right? And I actually helped the family, you know, that they -- the --\nthe family, because I was able to get some bread, and etcetera. So that was my -- my injury, as it\nwere, you know, and fortunately I didn\u2019t get an infection because, you know, with the bandages\nand so here I am as a -- so that was ano -- another close call that I had.",

        "A: Oh yeah, I -- I certainly did. And -- and the interesting part too, speaking I -- I made a --\nallusions to German, my German language. I learned how to speak a broken German Polish, you\nknow, just -- in other words, I -- just throwing in a word of German here and there, which was\nknown that some kids would learn German in public school. So instead of really speaking\nGerman the way I knew German, since I also lived in Danzig, you may recall, I would kind of\nspeak a broken [indecipherable] German, which helped me also to get some bread, you know,\nfrom the Germans or some food when I had my -- my paper as a vol -- as a future volunteer, you\nknow, in German army. So that was also kind of -- I -- I kind of thought that was really funny in\nsome times, because here I am trying to speak, straining to speak German, you know, a few\nwords here and there, to ingratiate myself so I could, you know, get some food. But then of\ncourse, trouble began again because the front was approaching. Now, you may recall that the\nRussians deliberately stopped on the outskirts of Praga because the Warsaw uprising was not\nsponsored by the Communist Polish exiled regime, by the London regime, okay? Which was --\nwhich was the -- the -- th-the other side. So they decided, and it\u2019s, I think, historically\ndocumented, to let the Poles kill themselves, you know, before they had their own Polish army,\nwhich is part of the Russian army, take Warsaw. And of course, that was a complete catastrophe,\ndisaster because of course the -- the Polish uprising finally failed, and the Germans regained, you\nknow, the -- the -- the front and so forth. And while the uprising was finished by -- perhaps by\nbeginning of October, started in August, the -- the pol -- the -- the -- the Russians began to\nadvance towards the Vistula River, and we had to leave, you know, they had to evacuate all the\ncivilian population. And that\u2019s why really tough times started, too. That was another period of\ngreat hunger for us, because we crossed the -- we had to cross the river, into -- onto the other\nside, you know, because the Russian was -- were advancing. And that was still during the\nuprising it\u2019s se -- that happen, because the Russians were moving -- inching up. And I remember\nlike today, we are walking through a field and all of a sudden we saw these thousands of\nparachutes, what looked like thousands of parachutes, which was one of those big drops that the\nallied -- you know, the Americans dropped on Warsaw. And as you know, 90 percent or more of\nit fell into the German hands. That was one of those terrible, terrible blunders, you know, of the -\n- of the -- of this whole operation. And wa -- where the -- where the Polish resistance hoped to\nget all of that -- all these ammunition supplies and the Germans got all pri -- virtually all of it.\nAnd actually, we were wal -- as we were walking, we saw th -- the sky was almost dark. There\nmust have been thousands of these drop -- of the parachutes coming down. So that was one --\nanother experience. And -- and then we tried to walk from one village to another village, trying\nto get some food, we were hungry. In fact, I w -- the one episode is where we actually -- I slept\non the cemetery, you know, on the na -- on the graves, you know, because we had no other place\nto sleep. It was cold. And -- and that was a very tough time. We were very, very -- we had no\nfood. We maybe ate once a day. Sometimes we would eat some -- some potatoes and -- and then\n-- and cucumbers there was [indecipherable]",
        "A: I was with the family, right, right. The -- there was -- there was Danka and her sister --\nyounger sister. The two oldest sisters went away and they -- they -- they went separately\nsomewhere. And there were there just the parents and the -- and the two sisters and myself. And\nthere were other families, you know, sometimes we went a group together. And sometimes the --\nthe -- the local farmers would take pity on us and let us sleep in the barn, you know, and there\nwas no food, and -- and -- and I remember where there was a cow, soon enough the Germans\ncame and took away the farmer\u2019s cow, you know, so there was no -- no milk, and -- and no food,\nso it was very, very tough. And that lasted through that period of -- of -- of December and\nJanuary, just the begin -- towards the end of December, and one night we wake up and who do\nwe see? Russians, on their trucks, you know? Then I said to myself, okay, I\u2019m alive. I made it. I\nmade it. January 1945 is when Warsaw is liberated, finally, after being totally wiped out. And I\nnever told the family that I was Jewish, but I did tell Danka that I was. And she wasn\u2019t shocked.\nWas surpri -- I would never -- she may have been s-surprised. But I soon realized that actually\nthis was not a -- a true lang -- lasting romance. You know, she was older than I, and what was\ninfatuation was not really a -- a real -- something that it was going to last, even though I would, if\nshe were willing, I probably would have want it to last, maybe, at -- at that time, anyway. And --\nand there were different Russians from the Russians that were, you know, retreating in -- in\n1941, I mean, those were victorious Russians. And they were trying to give out food, and finally\ngot -- we got some food from the -- from one of the -- some of the Russians, they were friendly.\nThey could -- they recognized right away the -- what the -- they didn\u2019t know whether they were\nJews, necessary, but they -- they could see they\u2019re -- they\u2019re refugees and just hungry, starving\npeople, and all that. So -- so that\u2019s how -- how I ended being Mieczyslaw Wereszczyszyn.",
        "A: And became Mundek Wertman again, you know, later on.",
        "A: I had no papers. I had no papers. They had to take my word for it, the Jewish authority,\nJewish agency, you know, had to take my word for it. My first notion was obviously to try to\nfind family. And the movement of the front was such that the -- there was constantly Russians\ndriving back and forth in their trucks, so forth. So I left the fam -- the -- the -- the Bozym family,\njumped on one of the trucks and just went east, you know. And my intention was to go to Lublin\nbecause L\u2019vov was already taken over by the Russians there, and they had a border, you know,\nthey -- they -- they did not let people in, so L\u2019vov became -- you know, they annexed L\u2019vov to\nthe -- to the Ukrainian Republic, even at that time they already established a -- a border. But I\nknew I had an uncle in Lublin, one of my father\u2019s brothers, who had a bakery. And of my\nfather\u2019s four brothers and a sister, I only knew two of the -- of his siblings. One was the uncle in\nLublin, and the other one was the sister on to -- Tomaszow, because when I was a little boy I\nwould visit her. The other three brothers I never met. And they were spread out, you know, in\ndifferent parts of Poland. And I remember checking into Lublin, and already at -- by that time --\nand it may have been weeks -- few weeks after, they already had some established now, the\nJewish agencies started to -- you know, to help out, you know, in establishing a registry of\nsurvivors. There was the HIAS, H-I-A-S, and the AJDC, you know, it [indecipherable] agency.\nAnd there was a registry and I went into this re -- first I was asking about my uncle and they said\nno, he 1s de -- he is -- he is not al -- he perished, you know, they didn\u2019t have any record of him.\nAnd then I checked with the registry and lo and behold I see my father\u2019s name. I see Genya\u2019s\nname, I see my brother\u2019s name, I see Helen\u2019s name and I see my cousin\u2019s name, my -- my -- you\nknow, my cousin\u2019s. I just couldn\u2019t believe it. I thought maybe this was registry of the dead, not\nof the living. And they had an address there, and I went there and sure enough, there was Genya,\nand there\u2019s Helen. And my father wasn\u2019t in on that day. And that was the first time that I took a\nreal bath in I don\u2019t know how many years, three years, four years, a real bath, because I was\nreally dirty. And -- and then I found out the story as to how my father survived, and how my\nbrother survived. And I didn\u2019t know anything about my mother. There was no -- no -- no record\nof it until -- much later I found out what happened to her. And the way my father survived was\nthat before the ghetto closed in July, I believe -- in June, I believe, in 1943, when the ghetto was\nclosed, just before it closed, my father arranged with a Polish vegetable gardener to be hidden.\nAnd of course he paid them money for it. But he had some money stashed away, he would pay\nmonthly because he was afraid to give him up front because the guy would probably spend it and\n-- you know, and so forth. And for 18 months my father didn\u2019t see the sun, the daylight. He was\nhidden there with Genya, Helen was given away, and with that cousin, with this Chana Koch, in\na small area, was like a cubicle. And was given food maybe like once a day or something. The\ngardener would bring food. And in that same building there were German railroad workers that\nactually lived in that building. And they were separated just by a very thin wall from the places\nwhere the German railroas -- railroad workers would congregate and -- you know, and have fun\nand have their -- their drinking parties and all kinds of things. So he had to keep very, very quiet\nwhen the workers were there. There was no sanitation, there was no toilet. They just -- whatever\nwater they could get, they would use that, and -- so -- so they ha -- instead of using -- using a\ntoilet, you use something else and then get rid of it at night, da -- in the dark of night. My brother\nGeorge was fortunate he was able to live outside the camp itself because he was on a steamroller\nthat I mentioned before, working it. But towards the end of the -- he knew what was going on\nbecause he was outside, so he could hear the -- what they were talking about, th-the guards and\nthe -- the Germans and the Ukrainians. He knew that the camp was going to be liquidated. And\nhe happened to know where my father was hidden because one of my father\u2019s friends, who had\nhappened to be a Ukrainian, had some contacts [indecipherable] in the camp, you know, and he\nwas -- communicated with him, so he knew where my father was. And on the night that he was\ngoing to be -- when the camp was liquidated they were taking -- he escaped from the caboose of\nthat steamroller while the Germans were waiting outside, asking to get dressed, he escaped\nthrough a rear little window -- it\u2019s on -- on -- it\u2019s on his tape -- and ran away and hid, you know,\nfor a couple nights, and joined my father -- was able to join my father in that hiding place. And\nhe was with my father for a full year, until liberation. And the -- and -- and wa -- L\u2019 vov was\nliberated, I believe in July of \u201945. No, not in July of \u201945, I\u2019m sorry, no, no, I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m\nwrong, cause the war ended in May of 1944. It was liberated I think it was in -- if I\u2019m not\nmistaken it must have been in the -- I have it written down. I think in July of \u201944, possibly, \u00b044.\nHe -- so they -- that was a very tough time for them, but they managed to survive in this hiding\nplace. And -- and what happened is they moved to -- to -- to Lublin, my father, you know, moved\nto -- moved to Lublin after -- after the -- the liberation, and established himself there -- tried to\nestablish himself there. And one of my cousins, who was a partisan in one of the forests of --\nnear Lublin, which was not far from Tarnogrod when my mother was there, he knew that my\nmother died in a -- in a mass shooting, liquidating the small remnant of that Jewish community in\n1943. 1943. She worked as a nurse, apparently and then that -- so that\u2019s how I found out, cause\nhe was one of the survivors, too.",
        "A: Right, yeah. These were very chaotic times and -- a-and just -- just -- just th-the remnants of\nthe survivors and the chaos and the -- and the -- trying to find survivors, trying to look for\nsurvivors and -- and as I said before, you know, my father had four brothers. They all were\nmarried, had children, and for the -- the two cousins, one cousin my father\u2019s brother\u2019s son, and\nthey -- my father\u2019s sister\u2019s daughter were the only two other of the family that acta -- that s --\nthat survived of my father\u2019s family. So -- so that was -- you know, of course, we all looked bad,\nyou know, kind of emaciated and -- but fortunately not in terribly bad health at all, you know,\nsomehow. And when I heard of my mother\u2019s death, you know, that was very hard for me. I was\nreally -- it\u2019s kind of a -- hit me very hard. Especially in the light of the fact that 1f she had stayed\nwith my father, if my father didn\u2019t divorce her, because he did it, she would have survived. You\nalways think about that, you know. And she was so young, 38 years old, you know. She was very\ngood to me. Bright, intelligent. Very socially aware. My father accused her of being a Socialist,\nwhich was -- was the strongest insult he could use, you know, cause he was obviously not. And\nshe st -- he always accused her of being too free thinking. Too -- too -- too sympathetic to the --\nto the strikers, to the laborers, you know, to the workers, and all that. So -- so that was very bad.\nThat was a bitter pill, especially in the light of our very bad relations with the stepmother, you\nknow, it was -- it was very, very bad. That has caused me a lot of anguish. And you never forget\nthat, you know. And on the top of it all, after many years when my father separated from Genya,\nand they didn\u2019t live -- for [indecipherable] years they were separated, he would say, \u201cIf I could\nonly bring your mother back alive.\u201d And you know, I mean that was, you know, if I could only\ndo that. So, after so many years he had regrets, as it were, you know. So it was -- it was pretty\nhard. But -- but it\u2019s ancient history now. Maybe not so ancient for those who still remember it.",

        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Nothing. The -- the people that I lived with in Warsaw and worked with, were basically very\nstaunch Polish Nationalists. You know, they -- they -- they really hated the Germans. And maybe\nbecause of that, they took a sort of a stand of they didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t ex -- they didn\u2019t want to\nexpress any anti-Semitic feelings, even though they may have harbored them. But I did not hear\nanything really negative per se at all about -- about Jews. In fact, nothing was said about Jews at\n-- at -- in -- in -- during our th -- there was no remarks made, or cracks made about -- about the\nJews. I don\u2019t know whether I was -- whether the Poles in Warsaw perhaps were more -- more\nworldly in a sense, in general, as opposed to maybe L\u2019vov, which was so heavily uk -- Ukrainian\nand Polish and all this strife and all this constant turmoil. Warsaw was more homogenous in\nterms of the Polish population. Maybe more sophisticated, I don\u2019t know. But I know that -- and I\ndidn\u2019t hear this, so it\u2019s not a direct answer to your question, but -- but during the -- the Jewish\nuprising, there was some help given to the -- to the Jewish aba -- by the Poles. So there was some\ncontacts made with the Polish underground, per se. And I was not aware that the Poles actually\nhelped at all, the Germans to fight the Jewish ghetto, you know. Unlike in L\u2019vov, for example,\nwhere -- where there were just volunteers galore, you know, to -- to help to enter the ghetto. In\nfact, the -- the guards of the -- of the Jewish ghetto were actually Estonian and Latvians, many of\nthem, which I don\u2019t know whether this is well known. And the reason for it being is that the\nLatvian and Estonians and Lithuanians had great hopes for having independent -- you know,\nwant to be independent of Russia, you know, they always been an -- you know, under the\nRussian thumb, as it were, you know, and so maybe that -- somehow they felt that that would be\nsome way of -- of maybe getting Germans to give them some independence. In the same ways\nthe Ukrainians were hoping that they were -- that the Germans would give them a -- a country --\na statehood, or a bas -- or some kind of independence, some kind of autonomy. But they were,\nand they were [indecipherable] ferocious, you know, from -- so -- so I think perhaps in general,\nmaybe -- and I don\u2019t know whether this is a fact, this 1s only my -- my -- my -- my impression,\nbecause I didn\u2019t hear any overt anti-Semitism within my immediate surrounding, perhaps this\nwas maybe typical of -- of other urban Warsaw people, you know, of the -- of the urban people,\nthe people who live in Warsaw itself.

        "A: I find it interesting.",
        "A: Cause I work with my hands. It was -- 1t was -- in a way it was [indecipherable] I could\nconcentrate on. I had to concentrate to learn it. After awhile 1t became sort of automatic, you\nknow, and in some cases mindless, you know, you just did it, because you learned how to do it,\nbut -- but for awhile -- took a long time to learn. And it was hard work, too. So -- so that part of\nit was -- was actually very fortunate because it -- 1t took time, you know, and you kill time by\ndoing it, and -- and you -- you glad you -- you -- you done with it, you know, when you\u2019re done.\nAnd -- and I didn\u2019t want to show off like I knew better, or I did it better than the other kid or\nsomething. I had to keep in line, just do my --my work and -- and try to be modest about it, and -\n- not that I was necessarily that skilled, but I mean, I -- I learned. You know, I -- I applied myself\nto it, in fact, probably more than maybe the other kid because I wanted to -- to do a good job, you\nknow, so they would keep me instead of kicking me out and saying go back to Zaremba, you\nknow, we don\u2019t want you. Which could have happened any time. Or if they didn\u2019t have enough\nwork, they may have just said, hey go. I don\u2019t know what would have happened if they said --\nwhether the Zarembas would take me back or not, you know, or else -- who knows?

And -- and my major thing was to find family, to find my\nmother, to find relatives, and to -- but -- but in one experience, the Warsaw experience, one thing\nthat it taught me in a kind of a [indecipherable] very unusual way, is that I had an opportunity to\nlive with a Gentile family, which was totally alien to me. And I learned how the other peoples --\nyou know, how to learn, I mean I -- I think that sort of those germs of human -- humanism kind\nof began to -- to -- to -- to take root in my psyche as it were, because -- because they were\npeople, they were a -- they were pe -- they were not Jewish, but they were people who -- who --\nmany of them had -- had the good qualities about them.

Unfortunately there wasn\u2019t enough of them,\nyou know, because if there were many of them, more had -- would have survived, of course, you\nknow. So -- so that was the situation there.

I mean, the Polish -- the\nPolish government itself was -- was virtually nonexistent, I mean trying to establish -- their own\ncountry were destroyed really, I mean the destruction was enormous in many cities. Krakow --\nKrakow was spared, basically, but -- but L\u2019vov was damaged badly, Lublin was all bombed, and\n-- and many of the cities and -- so the destruction was enormous because the Russians in 1939\nwhen they came in, they were, you know, there was bombardment there, you know, because they\ninvaded Poland from the east, so there was some fighting going on then, [indecipherable] the\nGermans from the west, you know.

And -- and realizing that, you know, was just a terrible, terrible\nshock to me of knowing that -- knowing that they -- they -- there was no record of them, you\nknow. You know, first -- first -- cause nobody said they -- that they would -- th-the -- the answer\nwas there\u2019s no record, you know, until such time as you really knew that obviously they\nperished.

        "A: -- there was no -- there was no bodies. So -- and of course the -- the -- the -- the also the -- the\nstark reality was also what now? Okay, we survived. Now what kind of a life are we going to\nhave now? We knew we couldn\u2019t establish ourselves and we couldn\u2019t get jobs, there was no jobs.\nI mean, a lot of the Poles who were forced labor, Poles themselves, were just coming back to\ntheir own homes, trying to recover their own things, you know? I mean, you couldn\u2019t -- there\nwas no jobs available. And -- and in some ways there 1s also a feeling of resentment if not\noutright hostility by some of the Polish people, who many of them suffered too, of course not --\nnot like the Jews, who -- who were -- in some ways there was some jealousy too, because they --\nthe Jews were getting help. The Jews were getting American money from the Jewish agencies\nand so forth, you know, so -- so they weren\u2019t hung -- they weren\u2019t hungry, I mean they were\ngetting money, they could get some food and they were helped and all that, you know? So that in\nitself created frictions and tensions which later resulted as you know in -- in outbreaks of -- of\nanti-Semitism and -- and -- and killings and so forth. So -- so it isn\u2019t like the Jews who survived\nfelt welcome, or felt -- they didn\u2019t feel any different in some ways than way before, you know,\nalthough there wasn\u2019t any of that overt antise -- anti-Semitism, it certainly wasn\u2019t a welcoming\nplace. It wasn\u2019t like coming back home.",
        "A: There was no home.",
        "A: There was no home. And there was no place to go really, you didn\u2019t know what to do with\nyourself, until you began to think about emigration, you know, until you begin make contacts\nwith the -- with -- with the -- you know, with the Canada, America, Australia, you know. You\ncouldn\u2019t go to Israel because until 1948 Israel was not a state. As we mentioned before, you\nknow, the -- the -- the -- the British had a embargo, you know, and they were constantly\ncapturing these boats, you know, and -- and putting them to -- into internment camps in Cyprus\nand others. Now who wanted to go back into a ghetto again, into a camp, you know? And even\nthough in the internment camp was obviously not a ghetto, there weren\u2019t -- but still, you know,\nyou -- you -- your -- your freedom was gone again. So many of the Jews, like in Poland, didn\u2019t --\ndidn\u2019t want to go, didn\u2019t want to take that -- that risk. You didn\u2019t feel like going there. You\nwanted to be free. You wanted to -- to -- to -- to -- to recapture some of that loss, you know. I\nnever went to high school. I never experienced a high school life and the high school sports. My\neducation stopped at the grade six or f-five and a half. I had no education, no high school. I\ndidn\u2019t -- you know, it -- all I was 1s just ap -- an apprentice for a few years, so I didn\u2019t have all\nthat experience. So I had no skills, per se. I mean, I certainly wasn\u2019t going to work in a leather\nshop, and then what leather shop would -- would even take me? There was -- you know, I mean,\nthere was a -- there was no need for my skills. So -- so there was like an emptiness, you know,\nreally. And -- and at the same feeling of sort of a carefree thing, you know, from one day to the\nnext, you know, you felt like. So as a result, people are roaming around. They were going --\ngoing -- get on trains, traveling, going places, you know, hoping to find something there,\nsomething here and -- and in fact George and I ended up in Romania, you know, we thought we\nmaybe going towards -- towards Palestine, trying to maybe get there. We still thought maybe\nthere was a way of -- of doing it. And by the time we reached Romania we -- we -- we couldn\u2019t\ngo any farther, they -- they wouldn\u2019t let us go -- go through, we couldn\u2019t get to Greece, so -- so\nafter -- for a few months of traveling and [indecipherable] we finally end up going back to\nPoland, cause at that time there was no -- we couldn\u2019t -- there was no emigration as yet, it wasn\u2019t\nall set up yet, 1t was chaos. Just think about trying to reconstruct these things, you know, trying\nto get people together. And so we ended up in the -- in the western part of Poland, which is\noriginally German, you know when -- you know the deal that was made by Churchill, Roosevelt\nand Stalin. They gave eastern Poland to Russia, to Soviet Russia and they took away part of the\nwestern Poland -- western Poland -- I mean eastern Germany, including Danzig to the Germans.\nSo these were sort of the new territories, and we had hoped maybe could establish ourselves for\nawhile there. So we ended up in -- in Leignitz, Legnica Leignitz which is one a -- which is a\ntown in the -- in that part of Poland and try to -- to maybe open a store or something, trying to\nmake a living there. So -- but that -- for awhile, that didn\u2019t last very long either. And in the\nmeantime my father ended up in Munich, Germany, 1946, and Germany become the major,\nmajor staging area for emigration. All the DP camps, displaced person camps were all\nestablished in a lot of Germany, Munich and other places and so forth. And that\u2019s where he\neventually ended up. And I got there in 1947. And end up and then I -- it was another stage in my\nlife there, you know, as a DP in Germany for about three years.",
        "A: Okay.\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "A: Seven.",
        "A: Right. Okay, I came to Munich and my father was already there with Genya and Helen. And\nmy brother married since then.",
        "A: He found -- yeah, he found his spouse and still while they were in Poland, and he actually con\n-- made contact with her in Romania. And her name was Frieda, they\u2019re still married to this very\nday. And so he was there, too, and then I arrived, and I took a little room in [indecipherable] of\nthe apartments outside the DP camp. And my first interest was in trying to get some education.\nAnd I want to learn English, I want to learn French. So I had a pridis -- some private lessons, but\nof course I want to get a job, too. So I joined the international refugee organization, IRO, and I\nwas assigned to the desk where they handled hardship cases. Now hardship cases were --\nprimarily meant expectant mothers, you know, displaced person expectant mother, because they\nwere to be expedited sooner so that they would get to the -- wherever they were going, and have\ntheir babies there, instead of having them in the DP camp itself, where conditions weren\u2019t really\nthat good. I mean, they were -- they were fine, you know, but they were camps, basically refugee\ncamps. So I handled those cases too, tho -- mainly those cases and worked there and -- and then I\nbecame an allied civilian as a result of that, which gave me PX privileges. Now you know PX\nprivileges, at that time, for a -- for a boy like me, you know, from the -- from the ghetto, was a\nbig thing, because I was able to go to the PX and buy all the American, you know, goodies, you\nknow, the candies, and the -- and the cigarettes at that time, of course, too, you know, and -- and\nso forth. But at any rate, that was interesting work. And -- and of course the idea was to -- to\nemigrate, you know, obviously the -- living in Germany post-war was -- was -- it was not -- you\nknow, you -- you didn\u2019t feel comfortable. They -- there was still a time when a lot of the German\nprisoners of war were coming home, you know, they were recovering from the war. They were\nreleased, of course, much sooner than \u00b047, but they were still recovering and -- and there was a\nlot of shortages of food, you know, there were rations. And Munich was badly damaged in the\nwar too, so there was a lot of poverty around and -- and -- and of course, I spoke German well, so\nI had no trouble communicating. Wer -- you know, living quarters were very crowded, they were\ncrowded in with other German families. You had a room, and there were other German families\nin the other rooms, you know, in the same apartment, etcetera. But I enjoyed the work very\nmuch, you know. It gave me contact with the English speaking people because the people in\ncharge were Americans from the United States, from the agencies, from the IRO, from -- from\nHIAS and AJDC, which is the -- the a -- American Jewish --",
        "A: -- committee --",
        "A: -- Joint committee.",
        "A: Well, the IRO was sort of a -- I think it was a s -- was established -- I wonder whether that\nwas a United Nations agency possibly, but I think there was under also as as -- as in under the\nauspices or under some connection with the -- with the AJDC and -- and HIAS, but which\nhandles the Jewish part.",
        "A: Because the DPs were full of non-Jews as well. Those DP camps were not only Jews, they\nwere all kinds, there were Poles and -- and all kinds of nationalities, all -- all people that were\ndisplaced, you know, people that were displaced persons who -- who were in German work\ncamps or something and they didn\u2019t go back, you know, they wanted to emigrate. So -- so the\nIRO was more of a -- of an overall umbrella, as it were. And HIAS and the AJDC were kind of\naffiliated, or sister agencies that were working with the -- with the Jewish people, so I was --",
        "A: Sorry.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Oh yes, I got -- well, that\u2019s how I got my money for the -- yeah --",
        "A: -- that was -- that was -- that was like my first paying job, you know, because I didn\u2019t get\nmuch money when I was an apprentice.",
        "A: Maybe some pocket money and food, that\u2019s about all. See, I -- I had to get a salary, not very\nmuch, but I get a -- got enough, so I lived fairly comfortably then, and -- and then it -- where I\nbegan to re -- slowly began to feel maybe I\u2019m getting back into a normal mode of life. And then\nmy father was sponsored by someone in Canada -- you see, you ha -- you still had to have\nsponsorship, which is kind of really tough because -- because on one hand here you\u2019re s -- you\u2019re\na survivor and then you have to wait for a year -- or for two or three years, which 1s terrible, I\nmean that\u2019s something that I -- was very hard for me to understand as to why -- why these -- you\nknow, the Canadian, American [indecipherable] people at that time were so reluctant to bring\nthese people in, even though you were carefully checked medically, you know, if you had\ntuberculosis they wouldn\u2019t let you out, you had to be treated, and blood tests and all kinds of\nthings because they didn\u2019t want to obviously bring in sick people into -- into the country, into\nCanada or the United States. But you had that waiting period and these people in the -- in DP\ncamps, while -- while it was a far cry from being in a ghetto, still I mean, they were -- they had\nfood and they had some clothing, but that\u2019s about -- you know, they didn\u2019t have -- there was no\nwork, you know, per se. And there was just like waiting, waiting to -- to -- to -- to emigrate, and\nmany of them I guess had to be absorbed, and then -- and then maybe in European countries and\nso forth. So this was -- it was going on for a number of years. Because when I left -- left in 1950,\nwhen I emigrated Canada, the DP camps were still ac -- still -- still in existence. So that\u2019s another\naberration if you will, of -- of history and some sense that -- that these people were still sort of\nsecond class citizens, even though they were -- many of them were Jewish survivors and many of\nthem were -- were others, you know, other nationalities. So my f -- I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: Not -- I --",
        "A: -- didn\u2019t ring -- doesn\u2019t -- not -- not in that camp, there were several camps --",
        "A: It was in the Munich camp, I\u2019m trying to remember the name of it, there was a large camp\nright -- right outside -- right -- right -- right outside of Munich, one of the -- one of the big ones,\nand I may have the name of it in my files somewhere, but I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t have it -- maybe I still\nhave it with me, I can look it up.",
        "A: Yeah, so my father got -- got out, I think, in 1949, when he got out first and then I followed\nhim. He kind of -- he was sponsored by -- by -- by people at -- that he made contact with in\nVancouver, British Columbia, and then he sponsored me, and then I followed him, and then I\nended up in 1950, in Vancouver, British Columbia, in Canada.",
        "A: I felt -- yeah, well, it was an adventure, was a new country, I -- finally I found maybe this was\na new -- new beginnings and new world for me, yes indeed, yeah, right. That was a -- a time\nwhen I -- and of course I was aware that I was older than most kids of my age who were -- went\nto high school and so forth, because I was already like 22 -- close to being 22, I think it was,\nearly in 1950 and I was born in August. But you know, 22 years old was kind of old even for --\nfor a freshman in college, and I had this desire to go to college, and my father wasn\u2019t really\ntotally encouraging cause he felt that I should maybe get a trade, you know. His idea at that time\nwas I should learn how to repair typewriters. That would have been a big help to me, right, later\non, you know, to repair typewriters, you know. Yeah, right? He thought that was a great thing,\nyou know, from his vantage point, you know, typewriters was a -- was a mechanically advanced,\nyou know, equipment, you know, and so forth. Repairing typewriters would give me a ma -- give\nme a pretty good living, you know, so -- and of course, I -- I didn\u2019t think that was attra -- exactly\nwhat I wanted to do. So what I did was -- is I went to a college entrance preparatory school in\nVancouver, by the name of Surepass, which was a funny name of the --",
        "A: Because you were -- you were sure to pass, you know, right, so it\u2019s called Surepass, that was\nthe name of it.",
        "A: Surepass. And I took for one -- one year, you know, I took this matriculate -- I took the\nexamination and I was able to get my college entrance examination at the University of British\nColumbia.",
        "A: And -- and this was with -- with -- only with a five and a half or five grade hi -- school, you\nknow. But I studied hard, you know, and I took some courses and -- in that school and they --\nthey kind of knew what to learn, what to study and maybe they had a history of re -- you know,\nthey knew -- didn\u2019t know exactly what exam would contain, but they had a backlog of -- of the\nkind of exams that they would give, and so they steered the courses towards -- but you know, I\ngot a fairly good -- good background, and I enter -- and I entered the University of British\nColumbia, and went to college then, and so -- and my father was at that time -- of course tuition\nwas only like maybe 300 dollars a -- a semester or something like that, so it wasn\u2019t a terrible\nburden to my father because my father when he got the -- came to Canada he had some money\nwith him, and then he got in the construction business and he built a -- a rental property, so he\nwas okay, he was always the entrepreneur, you know.",
        "A: This was -- this was his great, great forte is to -- is to make a living, you know\n[indecipherable] to -- to be able to -- to do that. It was, I guess, in his genes. And so I went to the\nUniversity of British Columbia, and then I took summer jobs, you know, like working for the\nHudson\u2019s Bay, you know, as a clerk and doing all kinds of things. And then I -- after a year I\nlived on campus of the University of British Columbia. And -- and then I took a year out before\nthis -- before the final year, before the -- the -- the -- the senior year and worked full time just to\nmake some money, and this is during that time I met Ethel. You know, and I lived by myself.\nRelationship with -- with Genya was very bad. And my father had big problems there, too.\nGeorge was in his own business, he was in the -- he was always mechanically inclined, so he got\ninto -- into the dry cleaning supplies business in --",
        "A: -- in kota -- in Canada and Vancouver also. And I was very fortunate that I graduated ahead of\nthe class of 1955, head of the graduating class and the faculty of arts. And I got the -- the -- the\nGovernor general\u2019s medal for -- for the -- for number one, and so that was -- that was a -- and on\nthe strength of that I got a fellowship for -- for Yale, you know. So I kind of made up for a little\nbit of lost time.",
        "A: I got Master\u2019s from Yale, yeah.",
        "A: In -- no, in foreign area studies.",
        "A: Yeah, international. I had at one time maybe -- I had an idea of perhaps going into the foreign\nservice, but then I was handicapped because in order to go into the foreign service, the United\nStates had the law that you had to be a citizen for 10 years before you could join the foreign\nservice. So 10 years, and I -- I didn\u2019t ob -- obviously not, and I didn\u2019t -- I -- I was not, I was just\na -- just a -- I was only a -- a ra -- you know, a -- a resident with a -- for one year when I got my\nMaster\u2019s degree, so I -- I didn\u2019t want to wait that long. So I thought that maybe I would go to --\nthen I got another fellowship for Columbia to continue for a PhD., perhaps in -- in -- in that area.\nAnd I got restless, I -- somehow academia did not attract me a-any more, I felt I need to get with\nthe mainstream, I wanted to -- to maybe establish my -- I -- I had great, great desire to mix, to be\nin a mainstream, because of this isolation of all the years, you know, I -- I wanted -- I didn\u2019t want\nto be isolated in the -- in the fee -- in the academia. And the close I got to the academia, I got\nvery restless with the faculty life and the -- some of the backbiting that I came across, you know,\nin this, you know, so -- so -- so in a kind of an historical interesting thing too, is that when I got\nmy fellowship for Columbia University, the director of the Russian Institute was no one bu-but\nZbigniew Brzezinski. And it\u2019s interesting speculate what would have happened if I had\ncontinued. And he was Polish, as you know.",
        "A: Whether I would have been his right hand, or -- or maybe I would have continued with him\nand -- and ended up in the high echelons of -- of -- of government and you know, and that -- and\nso forth, you know, and the -- but I didn\u2019t take that route and I decided to go into the -- into the\nbusiness world. And interesting, my father never thought I would be a good businessman. Yeah,\nhe always thought that I had two left hands, which is [indecipherable] his expression. I -- I was\ntoo -- I was too soft, I was too sensitive, you know, I wasn\u2019t tough enough. I wasn\u2019t cut out for\nthe business world. Well, I proved him wrong, because I was very, very successful in the\nbusiness world. And I did climb the corporate la -- you know, a corporate scale and I got some\nvery important corporate jobs and -- and was president of companies and sit on board of directors\nand all that kind of stuff, until I retired and I got into my own -- my own business, but -- so I did\nprove him wrong, you know, so -- because when I -- when I joined the -- when I went into -- into\nthe retail business, I went on the executive training of Macy\u2019s in New York, he thought that I\nwasted all that time going to college. You know, was a total waste, even though I told him that\nwithout a college education they wouldn\u2019t accept you into -- into executive training. But he\ncouldn\u2019t -- he couldn\u2019t -- he thought I was -- I was just -- just talking nonsense, he said he\ncouldn\u2019t -- he couldn\u2019t understand. He said, you don\u2019t need a college education to be -- to go to\nwork in a store, you know. He thought I was, you know, the clerk or something, I mean who\nwants to -- who needs a college education to -- to stand behind the counter and -- you know, and\n-- and sell and sell the haberdashery or whatever, you know, or housewares. So at any rate, so\nthat was -- that was basically what has happened and -- and of course having been fortunate\nenough to meet Ethel and to put up with me and with all my baggage that I carried with me, it\nwasn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t easy and -- and it was this cultural gap, too, you know, when you -- and I -- I\nwas very self conscious about my background. I was self conscious about -- about my accent,\nabout not speaking English well, you know, I had such a terrible, terrible desire to fit in, to be\none of the -- of the masses. I didn\u2019t want to be a -- a -- a outsider. I didn\u2019t want to be asked, hey,\nyou speak, you know, where you from, you know. You have an accent, you know. That used to\nbother -- bother me a lot, you know. Maybe it was me, you know, maybe it was -- you know,\nwas maybe foolish on my part of -- to feel that way, but in Vancouver, which is more of a\nprovincial town, you know, people wouldn\u2019t hesitate to ask you. In New York you can speak all\nkinds of language, nobody pays attention to you. But in Vancouver, you know, you open your\nmouth and -- and not that they were that terribly interested in you, all they want to hear where\nyou from, you know. They didn\u2019t know -- they didn\u2019t want to say wow, gee, you know, where\nyou from and how -- when did you come or anything like that. All they wanted to know is where,\nyou know, just to satisfy their superficial curiosity as it were, you know. So -- so that bothered\nme quite a bit, and -- and of course my accent was much, much heavier, you know. In fact, Ethel\nkids me about the fact when we first started to date, you know, I -- I still didn\u2019t know how to say\nt-h properly, and I -- I would say wiz instead of with, you know. And that sort of thing, so --",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m doing fi -- I think I\u2019m doing better, you know. I seem to be doing better.",
        "A: Two daughters.",
        "A: Three grandsons.",
        "A: Yes. Very much [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The very first time.",
        "A: Well, actually, I was lucky because I -- all I did was return -- I had the form from the\nmuseum, which sat on my desk for about two or three years. And there was a name which I don\u2019t\nthink that lady is -- is any longer with -- with your department, but if you gave me the name I\nmay recall that.",
        "A: No. There was somebody else.",
        "A: Mm-mm. Well, maybe it was more than even two or three years ago. At any rate, it sat on my\ndesk and I had maybe -- whatever it was, I had a survivor\u2019s block, I didn\u2019t register because that\nwas a kind of a form very similar to the -- to -- well, it was the original form that I sent in, that\nwas the -- the very same form that I sent in. And I finally filled it out and I put down, you know,\nand all that, with the Mieczyslaw Wereszczyszyn business and all that, and I got a call. I didn\u2019t\nexpect to get a call. I didn\u2019t expect to -- to be a -- to ask for the interview. I didn\u2019t know whether\nI would qualify, whether my background was dramatic enough to -- you know, to qualify for\nthat. So lo and behold, I get this call from Elizabeth, would I be willing to do that, and I said of\ncourse I would. And that happened to be coincidental with -- with star -- I started to write, I have\nlike a chapter of my memoirs, I started to do that. So there was [indecipherable] for two this\nreally, that I did. Why didn\u2019t I do it sooner? Again, I -- I just -- I didn\u2019t -- maybe I -- because I\ndidn\u2019t feel that my story was -- was that important, you know, in the scheme of things. Maybe I\ndidn\u2019t want to go through this whole -- the past, you know, trying to relive all that and go\nthrough this -- through these very painful, terrible memories, you know. You know, maybe I\ndidn\u2019t want to do this so I don\u2019t lose faith in humanity, you know. Because I\u2019ve always been an\noptimist and I still am. I believe that humankind can be better. I strongly believe in that, and I\nstrongly believe that -- that life is sacred, that human life is sacred, whether it\u2019s one or one\nmillion or six million or whatever, you know. Every human life is sacred in my -- and I deeply\nbelieve in that, that\u2019s my -- that\u2019s my religion, as it were. I am a member of the Ethical Culture\nSociety. And this is my religion, ethical humanist. So I have a very strong feeling about that. So\nmaybe I didn\u2019t want to do that because I didn\u2019t want to -- to nibble at that -- at that st-strong\nfeeling. I didn\u2019t want to lose, maybe -- maybe come bitter again, you know, a-about that, or lose\n-- lose faith in humanity, become distrustful, you know. And so I\u2019m very happy, I\u2019m very happy\nnow. I\u2019m happy to be alive. And I\u2019m very happy to be able to tell you my story. And I sure hope\nthat it -- it\u2019Il be of interest to -- to other viewers and I\u2019m ready and willing and able at any time to\n-- if they have any further questions or anything more t-to -- to talk about, because there\u2019s so\nmuch --",
        "A: -- that -- I said a lot and there\u2019s maybe more to be said.",
        "A: SO --",
        "A: I want to thank you very much. You have no idea -- you\u2019Il never know what you did here is --\nis just -- I\u2019m most, most grateful and appreciative of that. And -- and I want to, from the depth of\nmy heart, I really thank you so much.",
        "A: Thank you.\nBeginning Tape Nine",
        "A: Okay, well this is a picture of my mother when I was about eight years old, would have been\nthe year of 1936.",
        "A: About 31.",
        "A: Her name was -- was Leah, the -- we used to call her Liecha in Yiddish, what today would\nhave been known as Lisa.",
        "A: Lisa Sarah wert -- Lisa Sarah Wertman. Maiden name Truk. These are pictures of my\nmother\u2019s parents. Their name was Truk, and Sarah was the -- was the mother and Zander was the\nfather. And this was taken about the same time, about 1936, where they lived in Danzig. And\nthey both perished in the Holocaust.",
        "A: Okay, this is one of the earliest pictures I have of myself, I was about four years old, taken on\na horse, which was kind of a staged picture at the time, and -- course it was taken in L\u2019vov. This\nis a street scene in L\u2019vov when my grandmother was visiting and it\u2019s a picture of her and my\nmother and myself, and I may have been about what, five years old at the time. As you can see\nfrom it, that -- we were -- it was cold weather and I\u2019m kind of well covered for the -- for the\nelements here. Okay, this was taken in a town called Sopwot, which was near Danzig. It was a\nresort town and a beach, and I was four or five years old at the time, one -- on one of my visits to\nDanzig. And on the picture, starting from the right is my mother, next to her is my grandmother.\nNext to her, standing, is the sister of -- my aunt, sister of my mother. And sitting right behind me\nis Abrun Truk, who is one of -- one of the brothers of my mother. And I have very -- very, very\npleasant memories because that was still a time of peace and it was a beautiful resort area. And I\nhad a lot of -- lot of fun at the time, on the beach, playing in the sand. Okay, this was taken a bit\nlater, I was at that time, possibly 10 year old, 10 or 11, shortly before the war, and again it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s -- brings back memories, of course, of my childhood. Kind of a little bit studied picture, but -\n- but it -- it ref -- 1t shows -- shows pretty accurately my -- my Aryan look. Now this is a very\ninteresting picture because it shows my mother and her brother Ben, who was very dear to us,\njust before he left Danzig, in 1939, he was able to escape from Danzig and my mother was still\nin Danzig at that time. So she was the only one of her sisters and brothers who was -- who stayed\nbehind, while the others were able to leave Danzig and survive abroad. Okay, now this is a shot\nof -- of my typical work day when I was working as an apprentice, and when I was the Aryan\nMieczyslaw Wereszczyszyn, and my work was at the sewing machines, sometimes it was away\nfrom the machine doing other things. But I did a lot of sewing and as you can see, there are\npatterns hanging behind, and pieces of leather. So that was a typical -- typical work day shot for\nme. Okay, the other picture, the small picture shows me with a typical apron that we all wore\nbecause we did a lot of cutting leather and dirty work as well. Just in the -- in the courtyard of the\n-- of the workshop that I worked in.",
        "A: Okay, this is a street scene, one of the ladies I befriended. I didn\u2019t know her for very long, but\nwe happened to be walking down the street and there was a shot taken. And this is typical, with\nthe hat, that I looked at, and -- and again it shows -- it shows me in -- in -- in Warsaw. This shot\nwas taken when I was visiting the family, the Bozym family in the -- in the suburb of Warsaw\nand the woman in -- that is with me a -- the young lady is one of the sisters of the family that I --\nthat I was friendly with. It just shows my blonde hair and my overall looks at the time. Okay, this\nwas Mr. Bozym, who was the father of the -- of the family and he was a carpenter and he is the\none that I worked with at that German infantry unit in the -- the artillery unit where I was injured\nworking with him at the time. And he was a very gentle soul, and a very, very friendly chap.\nOkay, now this 1s actually a post-war picture, that was 1947, taken in Munich when I was 19\nyears old, but it pretty much illustrates what I looked like and how I was able to -- to pass as an\nAryan with my wavy blonde hair, blue eyes, and at that time not -- not very prominent Jewish\nnose. Was in [indecipherable] already, I\u2019m not sure when he moved. Wait now, this 1s a very,\nvery early picture of my father, it\u2019s very interesting because he was only 25 years old at the time\nand the woman beside him is the mother -- his first wife, the mother of George and Mordechai,\nand was taken 1920, and it shows my father with a beard and a typical hat worn at that time, so\nreminiscent of -- of \u201cFiddler on the Roof.\u201d And he -- I don\u2019t ever -- I don\u2019t remember ever him\nhaving -- with a beard, so it must have been way back when, and then when -- he decided to\nshave his beard when he moved to L\u2019vov. This is a photo of my brother George and his wife\nFrieda, taken in Munich in 1947. He was, by then, pretty much recovered from his ordeal on the -\n- in the -- in the camp of Winniki, and trying to estab -- get himself established and of course\nwaiting for emigration.",
        "A: Right, and George is the son of my -- my father\u2019s first wife. Yeah, my -- my half-brother,\nseven years older. This is a shot of my -- my father and I, taken 1948 in Munich, Germany. And\nagain it shows my appearance, and my father didn\u2019t really look that stern, but he always had a\nvery serious expression on his face. And at that time he had that mu -- moustache, which he\nwould later shave, but he had that moustache for many, many years. We sometimes kidded him\nabout it, saying why do you w -- why do you wear a -- why do you have a Hitler moustache, but\nit was the fashion of the time. [indecipherable] after the war, but -- okay, now this -- this piece of\npaper 1s very interesting and important historically because it d -- it authenticates my name of\nMieczyslaw Wereszczyszyn. It was taken right after the war, where I had to register with the\nlocal authorities. My other documents were -- were lost and destroyed, but this survived. And it\nactually shows that I registered under that name and I also paid a fee for the registration.",
        "A: Okay, this is a -- I never, of course, had my original birth certificates, all those documents\nwere lost, you know, in the Holocaust and in 1993, when I applied for Medicare, I was\nencouraged to try to obtain a birth certificate because the Medicare authorities felt that it\u2019s a\ngood -- good thing to have for the record. So I wrote to the authorities in Warsaw, Polish\nauthorities, giving my name as Wertman, Abraham, because that was my original birth certificate\nname, and ga -- giving them th -- my -- my address in L\u2019vov and the place and the street where I\nwas born, without giving them the name of my parents and sure enough, they were able to\nactually dig up all the records and this is in Polish, saying that this a -- a copy -- an abbreviated\ncopy of my birth certificate, listing of course my name as Wertman, Abraham, showing the date\nof August 30, 1928. City of birth, L\u2019vov, and the name of my father, Chuna Wertman, which is\ncorrect, and of course -- and my mother\u2019s Sarah Leah Truk, which was her maiden name. So I\nwas glad to actually have a -- an -- a real, authentic birth certificate. Ba -- four -- thr --three --\nthree -- four years ago, three years ago -- wait!",
        "A: About three years ago, my brother George and Frieda, shown here decided t -- to take a trip to\nPoland and to -- just as part of their itinerary. And they went to the street with -- where I was\nborn, where we all lived, and the two photos show the outside, which is a street that\u2019s numbers\nstill there, 6A, and the street name, Pilnikarska, which is not shown here. And of course it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s in disrepair, but that\u2019s sort of the gate where we -- where we -- the entrance to it, and the\nupper windows is where we lived, and the lower part, which is on the -- on the right hand side\nhere, were some other apartments that my father would rent out, and it shows the interior --\ninterior court, and on the right hand side was a stable where my father kept some horses for his --\nwith a wagon and where he would get milk from the -- from the railroad station for his\nprocessing of milk and for the milk products, and so forth. On the left was the -- part of the\nfactory and the store, and it looks boarded up now, so it\u2019s really in -- in bad repair, but\ninterestingly it\u2019s still -- it\u2019s still there.\nEnd of Tape Nine\nConclusion of Interview\n"
