        "A: And in the hallway there was pump with water. So it was not running water in your kitchen or\n[indecipherable] we have to carry the water in pails, bring it to the apartment to kitchen, and use\nit. Or washing whatever you have to wash -- we didn\u2019t have showers.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Not even a bathroom in the room, we had to go outdoors.",
        "Q: You have to go outdoors for the bathroom.",
        "A: Yes, yes. And a -- a funny story.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: The bathroom thing that they used, my grandmother Chana used to take a pail of all the dirty\nstuff, that we peed, or other things and throw it out at night somewhere on a corner that doesn\u2019t\ntouch nobody or will not smell some in the middle of the street. So I -- she was very superstition.\nSo, she took me with her sometime and sometime my mom. I didn\u2019t understand then, but I will\ntell you what she did. They were so superstitious then that they believed that dead bodies, dead\npeople walk at night around us, but we don\u2019t see them. So she used to say, before she spilled that\ndirt, she used to say, \u201cScheidem, scheidem,\u201d -- scheidem is like dead bodies, \u201cScheidem, gay\navek, gay avek.\u201d",
        "Q: Go away.",
        "A: Go away. We have things to do, go away, don\u2019t stay in front of us. On all four sides. East,\nwest, south, no-north, wherever. Four sides she turned, and she say the same thing --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- scheidem, scheidem [indecipherable], please excuse me, go away. And then, after she went\nto all the four sides, she did the business, she threw it away. And I was standing, and I was really\nafraid. I didn\u2019t know exactly what scheidem 1s, but she explained like dead bodies and this. I\ndidn\u2019t associate with d-dead bodies then, I didn\u2019t see too many. So I couldn\u2019t understand, but\nwhen I got older, I know the superstitious, you know, people had in the old days, everybody 1s\nsuperstitious. So I understood the way they treated the dead bodies with respect, that they might\nbe hurt by her. This is a very funny thing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: There are many things. I used to -- my Aunt Reisl, which 1s like a -- a rose, yeah? She was the\nonly sister of six brothers. She was beautiful, she was a seamstress with her husband also,\nHerman.",
        "Q: This is the sister of your father?",
        "A: Of my father. They had four children. Two of the names I remember. One, the name -- the\nfirst born by everybody in the family Szlinger was Mordechai, Mijatek. Okay, in Polish, Miyatek.\nLike a translation from Yiddish Mordechai. And the baby girl was Bronia, Bronka they call. And\nthe two others, younger, I don\u2019t remember. They were all redheads. We were a family of\nredheads and I had a lot of freckles. I still have -- that hair, it\u2019s colored, I\u2019m not red originally, I\nhave gray, and then my hair become very dark, after they were cutting my hair in Russia a lot, so\nit becames black, really changed the color. But it was a very happy family. They were not rich,\nbut happy together and singing and dancing, all the movies they saw they were singing the songs.\nThat\u2019s what I talked about Molitik -- and how do I know Molly Pickens? From them.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then I saw her movies. I saw her in Yentl in \u201cFiddler on the Roof.\u201d",
        "Q: You did, yes, in New York?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: When -- when you -- you and your brother and your mother and father get on this horse and\nbuggy, yes? And there\u2019s no other family members, those --",
        "A: They didn\u2019t want to.",
        "Q: They wou -- they wouldn\u2019t go.",
        "A: No. My father came at night, and he prepared us before, told my mom to do some gathering\nthings, clothing, food for the children, everything. It was fall, November was already cold and\nraining. And he asks the brothers and the sisters, also he can get some horses and buggies,\nrenting for money, and run away. So my grandmother Chanaleh -- Chana and others say that my\nbro -- my father\u2019s a meshugener, a crazy. Where you taking young children in such a cold\nbitterness, you running away, why? He says, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be worse. Germany 1s going to kill\nevery Jew, and they going to make camps.\u201d So my buba Chana say, \u201cYou crazy. Before, in the\n14\u2019s, there was a war, nothing happened, we were only hungry. But nothing happened to Jews.\u201d\nSo he said, \u201cWho wants to come with us?\u201d He has a premonition or he knew something from the\norganization what\u2019s going on -- to happen. And seeing dead body in the streets, and dead horses,\nand German running with German Shepherds, and beating every old man or young man, or\ntaking Jewish beards and cut them with blood running. He saw that it\u2019s not good, so he brought\nthat at night, the horse, and my mom was ready. We did not understand anything then, I didn\u2019t\nknow what\u2019s going on. I cried, my brother cried, we were -- you know, hushed up by my mom,\nmy father, and we left. We left Warsaw burning, Warsaw was burning.",
        "Q: Do you re --",
        "A: I remember the fire.",
        "Q: You do?",
        "A: Like, do you see, \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d, the burning of Atlanta?",
        "Q: Mm-hm, yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s how --",
        "Q: That\u2019s how it looked?",
        "A: -- I remember that, too.",
        "Q: And the smell.",
        "A: And the smell and everything and the danger. And the smell of dead bodies, and Germans\nstanding all this, and Polacks standing, you know, they think that never happen to them, and they\nwere happy, smiling, they showing like this. Like they going to be slaughtered like this, you\nknow? They were happy.",
        "Q: Did you see --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- Polish gentiles doing that --",
        "A: Yeah, yes. Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- around the neck? Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yes. So, at night we didn\u2019t know where we running. We\u2019re running and running a few days.\nWe went -- my father told my mom in Jewish that we\u2019re going to a border between Poland and\nRussia. There\u2019s many borders. We went to a place called Zaremby-Koscielne. It\u2019s a Polish -- it\u2019s\na -- Koscielne means churches, a place of churches. There were probably a lot of churches in\nthat, that\u2019s why it\u2019s called Zaremby-Koscielne in Polish. Kosciel is me -- 1s Polish, a church. So\nwe went to Zaremby-Koscielne. It was raining, cold. We had some clothes, some this, but it was\nwet, we were soaked wet. They -- the horse and buggy -- the buggy wa -- the carriage was open,\nwe didn\u2019t have any cover, only a -- the blankets which were soaked already, and we came to that\nplace. It was woods and a big field, raining, dark and -- and gray, very bitter cold, and we\nstopped there. The German -- that was a border between Russia and Polish. I don\u2019t know exactly\nthe geography, but it\u2019s -- was somewhere in the south, it\u2019s -- was -- bete -- we were supposed to\ngo to Bialystok. It was Russian border then, now Bialystok is back Polish.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Bialystok means a white mountain, Bialystok. And we stood in Zaremby-Koscielne, Germans\nwere around us with dogs, of course, and from the trees, the pine trees, my father made like a\nchalash, like the Indian live in this. But the rain penetrated anywhere, so we were wet there, the\nbedding that they brought, everything was soaked, we were cold, my feet were frozen, and my\nbrother cried, my brother cried, he was always hungry. He was a baby, he didn\u2019t understand. One\nday they took everybody out on the field, like gathering together. My father was holding my\nbrother on his ha -- in his hand. I was holding my mother\u2019s hand, nothing else, and the Germans\ncame like making an ins-inspection. Who this and this and my brother cried, Mordechai cried, so\nmy father held him like this and said, shh. So the German came over with this stick, the rubber\nstick, slashed my father\u2019s face with it, and with such a rage. I don\u2019t know why, there was no\nreason. He just beat him with that and cr -- and here was open and blood was running his -- over\nthe -- his face, so my -- we all cried. I cried, my mom cried and my brother cried very much. So\nthe German, zai schtul, mas schtul, be quite. And we stopped. So the German came, one German\nhad a piece of salami like the [indecipherable] thing, he gave it to my brother.",
        "Q: Gave him a piece, or gave him the whole thing? A -- a little piece.",
        "A: Like -- like this length, yeah --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- anarrow piece of good wurst, salami. And my father took and shared with all four of us, we\nate. And he says to him, you have very nice children, but don\u2019t stay here. That means he was\nhuman. He had to do his job, the German, but he told us, my father especially not to be here,\nbecause Germany is taking young men to the country and they started already, they prepared for\nconcentration camps. We didn\u2019t know that then, but now, after this, you know the history, they\nprepared that in Poland, the railroads and the barracks, they were built before the concentration --\nyears before, they prepared. And I don\u2019t understand one thing. Did they not realize what is it for?\nNobody spoke about it, nobody knew about it? That\u2019s a puzzle to me, because it was done\nbefore, years before. All the barracks, all the railroads to go from all -- it was a big, big project to\ndo, from all over Europe to bring trains to this place. To Treblinka, to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: You think they made new tracks? Uh-huh.",
        "A: They prepared long time before they started to do it. And I think the Polish government knew\ntoo, but it was not a Communist government there, it was other. So, when --",
        "Q: So he warned your father to go away.",
        "A: -- when -- when the German gave us salami and everything, where everybody was happy,\nthey say go to your places, my father said to my mom -- I knew later, I didn\u2019t know as a child\nwhat happened, that you stay with the children, try to break the border. Go to Russia, and I am\nrunning to Bialystok and I will wait for you in the synagogue. There was a big Jewish synagogue\nin Bialystok. And over there we will meet. I don\u2019t know when we will come. My father\ndisappeared the next day. We didn\u2019t know anything, we cried. My mom said, shh to me. My\nbrother didn\u2019t understand, he was little. But she told me, \u201cSurele, don\u2019t cry. Your father will\ncome. We will meet with Father. Just be good girl.\u201d We didn\u2019t have food, but the German didn\u2019t\nbother then so much, so my mom went -- she left us alone with some other older people to\nwatch, and she went to work. There were a lot of Jewish Polish families living there in Zaremby-\nKoscielne, and she went to look for work, whatever. She could cook, she could clean, she could\ndo anything, watch children, and she found a little job by very rich family that they came from\nRussia pal -- they -- they send them to this place like, you know, a punishment, something, the\nCommunists or whatever. And she cleaned there, she cooked and she brought some food for us,\nwhatever leftover, potatoes, a little bit chicken, whatever, bread. We were happy to have that.",
        "Q: Where are you staying? Are you outside?",
        "A: On the field.",
        "Q: On the field, are there other --",
        "A: On the field as a -- for long.",
        "Q: -- refugees there?",
        "A: Refugee -- like a refugee place. It was not wired, nothing. It was [indecipherable] from all the\nsides surrounded. It was like a field, open field between woods.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re outside, you have no shelter?",
        "A: No, nothing.",
        "Q: Nothing.",
        "A: Nothing, that -- the pine trees my father cut that they put together like in a V --",
        "Q: In the V.",
        "A: That was all.",
        "Q: That was all.",
        "A: Everything. When was nice weather my mother took out the -- the goosefeathers, you know,\nthe blanket from goosefeather, very heavy. They call it a perine in Yiddish. It\u2019s like a\ngoosefeather blanket, very heavy. I still have one. It\u2019s good for the winter, it\u2019s light.",
        "Q: And what did she do, put it outside so it would dry?",
        "A: To dry, yeah, and then to cover us at night that we don\u2019t feel cold. My feet were swollen from\ncold, I couldn\u2019t walk. My toes, still today when it\u2019s bad weather --",
        "Q: You feel it.",
        "A: -- [have my big toes swollen bigger, and they itch. Before, I had blisters, it was swollen from\nthe cold and I had blisters, I couldn\u2019t even walk. But there was no medication to -- to heal it, just\ntime did it, but I still feel when it\u2019s very cold I feel they bother me like needles coming through,\nand -- and psychological -- psychologically I will always remember this thing what happened,\nbecause it was a tremendous impact on my life as a child, to go through this and not\nunderstanding why. Now I know why. I know the politics, I know what happened, now I know\nwhy. But then, what the German did to children and later on with the camps, that was terrible\nwhat they did. That was the worst part. These were intelligent, educated people. Germany was a\nvery advanced -- with everything, technologically, and a -- and how could a nation do that to\nevery people in the world, and not just Jews, to Russian, [indecipherable] and Gypsies.",
        "Q: How do you --",
        "A: Exterminating millions and millions and the whole world stood still. Why? Nobody cared.\nNobody said anything. So when we tried to smuggle the border, my mother tried every evening\nto -- there were the booths, and there was a Polish soldier on this side, Russian soldier -- you\nknow, they like -- on the border they had a booth, yes, one Polish flag and one side the Russian\nflag, and soldiers in their uniforms. The Russians stood with the rifles, and the Polish with the\nrifles. So my mother took us every day, sometime in the evening, sometime in the afternoon, but\nnot at dark, and she spoke Russian and she spoke Polish to the other. I remember the Russian\nsoldier got upset, he took the rifle and say in Russian, \u201cDavai na zad.\u201d Go back. My mother\ndidn\u2019t want to move back, and she started to beg and cry. He pushed her with the carabine -- with\nthe rifle, with the other side, with the wooden side, pushed her in here and my mother fell, and\nshe didn't move. And we thought my -- the mother is dead. Me and my brother started to cry.\nMomma, Momma, we spoke Polish. Momma stine, Momma styoff in Yiddish. Get up, get up\nMomma. You not dead, you not dead. And the -- my mother was like fainted or whatever, she\ndidn\u2019t move. So the soldier came over, the Russian, yelling at us, davai na zad, but we didn\u2019t\nknow what davai na zad is. Go back, go back. But s -- I cry, |say Momma, Momma. And they\nspoke Polish on the border, the Russian spoke Polish. I said to him in Polish, \u201cMy mom is dead?\nMy mom is not living?\u201d So he say, \u201cYour mom 1s going to be fine.\u201d He went down, I don\u2019t know\nwhat he said to her. She later told me. When she came to herself, sh -- he picked her up, he -- her\n-- she was all in mud, it was muddy, rainy, and we went back to our place. And she tried again.\nWith the Polish soldier nothing, they -- they were very rude, they couldn\u2019t do it. One day -- she\nkept separ -- now I understand she kept secrets from me or brother -- my brother was little. She\ncouldn\u2019t tell me. And she said one day to me, \u201cSurele, gather everything what we have the little\nbundles, put everything together and we go for a walk in the evening.\u201d It was a nice evening, it\nwas not raining and it wasn\u2019t cold, it was dry. And we walked. I was holding my mom by the\nskirt because she was holding my brother, he couldn\u2019t walk too much. And Mordechai, my\nbrother, the chubby guy, always was hungry, always. He liked food and was hungry. He was\ncrying because he was hungry. And whenever I had a piece of bread she gave us the same ration,\nI cut a piece for him later. I knew he will cry, so I gave him my share. One evening we went to\nthe woods, didn\u2019t tell us anything. She say we going here, maybe we\u2019ll find something to eat,\nsome grass growing or mushrooms, you know, wild mushrooms, wild grass, and we\u2019 ll find. And\nit was dark, it was twilight, you know, it wasn\u2019t light any more. But we could still see, and we\nwere walking along the line and there was a wire, you know, there were -- it was wired, the\nwhole thing. And all of a sudden my mom says, \u201cSit here, let\u2019s sit here.\u201d We sat on the grass, my\nmother went to the wire to the gate, and underneath she pushed it up, there was like a hole. Later\nI find out that the soldier, when he beat her and she was laying like that, he told her, at night you\ngo here, and there is a open wire. And you go to the woods. And he told her what to expect. She\ndidn\u2019t say anything to us, nothing, we were too little, and we could tell. So what happened? She\ndigged a little bit, she pushed my brother underneath, fine, she pushed me, and then she made a\nlittle higher, I was holding up the wire a little bit, lifted it as much as I could for five years old.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So we went through, and we had a little thing, my mother was holding my brother, I was her\nskirt, because she needed two hands, always with her skirt, she was wearing a long skirt, warm.\nAnd we\u2019re walking, and it\u2019s dark and I used to hear stories about wolves and -- and wild animals,\nthat they going to eat us up, and my mom said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, nobody is going to eat us, there\u2019s\nnobody, it\u2019s too cold.\u201d All of a sudden -- we walk, we walk maybe an hour or more, I see some\nlight. I had very good vision, I see some light far away like a little light. I said, Mama, Mama\n[speaks Yiddish] in Yiddish, I said to her, \u201cLook, there\u2019s some light.\u201d She says, \u201cShh, don\u2019t say.\u201d\nShe knew where we going. We came closer, there\u2019s a little wooden shack, like, and lights. We\ncame in, we knocked into the door, a older woman opened the door. And there was a man -- I\nfeel chills when I tell that, because I remember that story well. And the woman said to her, to my\nmother, in Polish, \u201c\u201cWho are you?\u201d Kto ty jest? So my mom says, \u201cI\u2019m running from Warsaw,\nthe Germans killed my f -- husband, he is not alive. I have two sick children, please help me.\u201d So\nshe say, \u201cCome in.\u201d Inside there was that woman, an older man, probably her husband and a\nyoung woman, maybe the daughter. They gave us food, they washed us, and they put us on the h-\nhay, there was hay on the floor. And she give us covers to cover ourself for night, and she says,\nin Polish she said to my mom, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything who let you through. This is the border\nbetween this -- we live here many years, we speak Polish and Russian. This is our home, but this\nis the border between Poland and Russia.\u201d",

        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. We came with the Russian soldiers, with this, to Bialystok. In Bialystok it was a big\nshul. I remember many, many people, children, men, women. Everybody yelling, screaming,\nrushing, ri -- calling names, looking for names, Moishe, Chaim, all kind of Jewish names. Chani,\n[indecipherable]. People were looking for one another. It was a big, big place with benches, you\nknow, and -- and they were looking. And my mom started to yell my father\u2019s name, Moishe,\nMoishe, you know, his name.

He went somewhere, but he has to come.\u201d Anyway, my father\nappeared after awhile, and we were all crazy crying. I hugged him by the feet because he was a\ntall man. And he -- he held my brother in his arm, and my mother, crying, everybody hugging,\nhappy that we are alive. And he said, okay, now we going to stay here, we\u2019ll find a place. After\ntwo days my mom find a job. There was a lot of Polish and Jewish rich people in Bialystok.\nThey spoke Yiddish, Polish and Russian because it was on the border. To tell you the truth, the --\nBi-Bialystok Jews, according to my mom and father\u2019s story, were not pleasant to us. They call us\nin Russian the runner ise -- the runner ups, the runners. They call it biezency in Russian.\nBiezency is people who are running. Biezency. So my mom find a job in a very good family. She\nwas cooking, cleaning, washing, and we were staying with them.

        "Q: Excuse me. Uh-huh.",

        "A: Yeah. I say, \u201cMordechai, don\u2019t call me mama, I\u2019m not your mama.\u201d You know, I was seven,\neight years old --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- how can I be your mama? You called me mama. So I was angry, and as a child, I -- I\nwanted to defend myself to be more mature. I don\u2019t want you to call me mama, I\u2019m not your\nmama. I\u2019m your sister, Sarah. We spoke Russian then. We -- with my mom we spoke Yiddish\nand Polish and with him, he was little, he didn\u2019t know Yiddish or Polish then, spoke Russian to\nme. So we spoke Russian.",
        "Q: So did he change? Did he call you sister? Or did he always call you mama?",
        "A: Oh yeah, later on, yeah.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: He -- you saw the pictures, a very big man, very caring, very lovely, good looking man. He\nhas -- I -- I miss him very much. My brother died of cancer of the liver, and he had diabetes. And\nthe last time I visited Israel in November, and I si -- I took him to the Dead Sea, to -- I knew he is\nsick, to give him some good time together, because my younger sister, who was so spoiled by us,\nwe were taking care of her as a child, has no feelings. And she doesn\u2019t even talk to -- she didn\u2019t\ntalk to my brother, and doesn\u2019t talk to me.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: I don\u2019t understand. We are from the same parents, and everybody has a different attitude.\nMaybe because me and my brother were always attached to the hip because of the war, because\nof being by ourselves. We didn\u2019t have any trauma, no -- no problems to be with one another,\nalways looked for me. Even when I was 14 - 15 in Poland, used to go out with boys, and have\nfriends and he always wanted to come to me. I chased him away. I said, \u201cGo home.\u201d \u201cT will tell\nMom that you\u2019re going out with boys.\u201d I said, \u201cAII right. I\u2019m going out with boys, these are my\nfriends, you go home.\u201d It was very hard to separate him from me.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But we were very close all the time, even though I went to America, and he in Israel, we\nalways kept in touch.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He married twice, he had the first wife, that\u2019s -- you saw the picture, Tamara, she\u2019s from\nMorocco Jews, Moroccan Jews, a nice family. They have two children, a daughter, Anat, she\u2019s\nnow 46 or something, and named a son, Moishe, after my father, Mojes -- Moishe in Hebrew.\nAnd Moishe has two beautiful daughters. And now it was born on my brother\u2019s birthday,\nDecember 14, 2006, a boy was born, looks exactly like my brother.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And they call him Mordechai Eli, and I spoke to them, they say that he is a copy of\nMordechai. I hope to see them.",
        "Q: I hope so too.",
        "A: I hope to see them. Very lovely, I love them very much, and I am a very family oriented\nperson. I love my fa-family, I like my children, my grandchildren, everybody. I don\u2019t have\ngrudges against nobody because my life was hard and I now will not concentrate on being angry\nat somebody or being against somebody or hating somebody. I always find love in my heart for\nother people to be helpful. And I miss my brother.",
        "Q: Right, I bet you do.",
        "A: I miss him very much.",
        "Q: Do y -- do you remember the day your father left to go to the Russian army?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t understand too much. My mom cried.",
        "Q: You were six.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: 1941, right? So you --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- were six years old. Or five.",
        "A: He was a tall, nice looking man, slim. And he said to us not to cry. He hugged me, my\nbrother, my mom, he said it wou -- \u201cThe war will not last long, and I will be back. You just be\ngood to one another, help your mom, and be good to your brother.\u201d I say, \u201cYes, I will, but I want\nyou to come back.\u201d He say, \u201cI will.\u201d So, when he left for the army, we didn\u2019t know anything\nwhere he 1s, what he is doing, no letters, nothing. We did not receive. So, when my -- the war\nstarted in \u00b041, we stayed a few months with the -- in the Ukraine with that woman, Babushka we\ncall her, grandma. She was a very nice person, but my mom say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to stay in\nUkraine.\u201d I -- she say, \u201cWhy Perlina?\u201d Perlina -- she was Perla in Yiddish, but in Russian they\ncall her Perlina. And -- \u201cWhy? Stay here. We\u2019ll take care of the children, you will work.\u201d My\nmom say, I have -- she told me later, \u201cI have memory from my father, born in Kiev, and telling\nme stories about anti-Semitism in Ukraine, how much they were against Jews.\u201d And they\ncollaborated with the Germans, Ukraines, a lot of them. So my mother remembered that, her\nfather\u2019s story, and she evacuated. There was like a Jewish Polish organization that they provided.\nSo we were staying in a different place, and I don\u2019t remember exactly, not long. And then we\nfind out -- oh, my father\u2019s brother, Yukel, and his wife, and daughter and son were living in\nMagnito Gorsk. It\u2019s in Ural.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They found that my father was wounded, and he was living in Shchyokino, two -- near the\nforest --",
        "Q: Near Tula.",
        "A: Tula.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, somehow he -- he tried, my mother tried to write and there was like a Polish organization.\nThere was a Polish writer woman, was named Wanda Waszylewska. You call it with a W,\nWanda Waszylewska. She was a writer and very active for Jews and Polish people to come\ntogether to live like a Polish society. And through her we find where my father is and through\nmy -- my uncle that they were keeping track of Jewish people and Polish people from Poland.\nAnd we traveled, and my mom, my -- me, my -- my brother in trains, it was very far away.",
        "Q: Yes, I imagine, from --",
        "A: Yes. We traveled all over Russia. They were not elegant trains, it was like cattle trains. Hay in\nthe middle, and there was a little stove, not to keep -- to keep warm, not cold. So one day we had\nbread that was like put in the oven, and like toasted. Dry bread toasted in a sack. And we were\ntransferred from one train to another, and Mom gave me the sack to hold on my back, that sack\nwith bread. It was not that heavy because it was dry, it was not heavy. And pef -- people were\nrunning and pushing to go into the trains, and -- cattle train actually, it was very high up, there\nwas no steps down, nothing. They did not provide any luxury for the refugees. And I remember\nsomebody pulled me up to the train and my mom was behind and pushing my brother up. So I\nheld my brother\u2019s hand and in one hand I had the sack. All of a sudden I feel light, there is no\nsack. Somebody took it away, we never find it. We cried. We didn\u2019t have our chlebushka, you\nknow, like my brother cried, Mama, chlebushka? Mama, give me bread. He was always hungry\nand he always cried. Chlebushka. I call him chlebushka always, you know? That -- that was the\nRussian word for bread, but in a very nickname like -- like endearing. It\u2019s called chleb in\nRussian.",
        "Q: Bread.",
        "A: But chlebushka is something like -- like somebody you love, you call babushka, like this, you\nknow, they --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- add. So that was chlebushka for him, and we didn\u2019t have it. Imagine in such a situation,\npeople running, hungry, somebody steals from a child, that sack with the -- we call it suchary,\nsuchary, that dry bread. And we didn\u2019t have what to eat, and the train was going and going with\nno stop. We didn\u2019t know where we going.",
        "Q: Oh, you weren't sure where you were going?",
        "A: Mm-mm, we didn\u2019t know. And when it stopped, everybody run out, because people -- excuse,\nwere relieving themself on the hay there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: On the straw. So when there\u2019s a train stop, we have to get -- jump down and go pee or do\nsome other things. And sometime the train all of a sudden start moving.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So my mom threw me to one wagon, my brother too, and somebody grabbed her by the hand\nto pull her to another wagon.",
        "Q: Into another wagon.",
        "A: And the train goes and goes, how long we don\u2019t know, and we cry, Mama, Mama, we both\ncry. And finally, after a few hours it stops, so my mom came running to us, hugged us. We cried,\nbecause we were happy to see. So my mom say, never again we go, we always keep hands\ntogether. Whatever happen, happen. And the trains, at the station, they had hot water. They call it\nin Russian kipiatok, kipiatok it\u2019s like boiling water. And we get the hot water and whoever had a\npiece of bread put it in that water so we have something warm to -- to have for the stomach, you\nknow? So --",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t have any food?",
        "A: No. But they gave us some, Russians.",
        "Q: They did?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: A piece of bread a day, or whatever, they gave us some, so we save for the next day. I always\nsaved bread. I cut like a small piece and put under the pillow, it was not a pillow like here, soft\nand comfortable. Something that you put under your head, and I always kept a piece of bread\nhidden. And when my brother cried for chlebushka, to get bread, I always got a piece and gave it\nto him, and he was satisfied and happy. We were very attached to one another. And then we\ncome, after months of traveling, we come to Tula. That\u2019s the city not far from Moscow, that city\nTula, and from Tula the organizat-zation, a Polish organization brought us together and they\ntransfer us to Shchyokino, where my father was, you know?",
        "Q: So your father was not in Tula --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- he was in Shchyokino.",
        "A: It was cold in the Russian Gora Shchyokino, the city of Shchyokino, and Tulskaya Obles,\nTula like -- like Washington [indecipherable] Maryland, yeah? That was the region.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Tulskaya Obles, the -- the suburbs or whatever, of Tula. Tula was not far away, but it was a\nnice, big city, because later we went there. And my father lived in a place called in Russian\nobszy zycie, it\u2019s communal life, communal life like a community in barracks. Everybody had a\nbed like two, four or five people in one room, with a small petition like in the hospital, you\nknow, they have this curtain --",
        "Q: Curtain.",
        "A: -- on the bed, and -- and we didn\u2019t see our father for a long time, I didn\u2019t recognize him. He\ngot -- he was wounded in the -- in his leg, so he limped a little bit. But he got skinny and not the\nfather I remember. And we were also children that grew a little bit and got skinny, without hair.",
        "Q: So you --",
        "A: So we all cried. We cried. It was like kind of frightened of him, the way he looked. And he\ncried to find us and my mom. And life started. So, as a family, we got a little room, separate\nfrom the place where he stayed single. We got a little room, a long, little co -- like the same\nwidth, but longer, with one window, two beds with straw mattresses and a stove in the middle,\nlike they call it [speaks Russian here], the Russian stove that you burn on coal or wood, and no\ngas. And no running water, never in the house, not --",
        "Q: You haven\u2019t had running water for a very long time.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: We used to carry, my mom -- in the Russia, if you see Russian old movies, you have like a --\na wooden [indecipherable] like it\u2019s half round and it has two hooks, one hook for one pail, and\nthe other, and you carry it on your shoulder like this, with the -- I used to carry that.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Mm-hm. But smaller buckets, you know?",
        "Q: Right, because you were smaller.",
        "A: I used to sit down, kneel it -- kneel, and then pick it up with my shoulder, and stand up. And\nof course the water was -- because I was shaking, not steady on my legs, so this was spilling, you\nknow, spill. But I run, barefoot, and was summertime, and we didn\u2019t have clothes enough and\nmy mom, from whatever she could do over her clothes she sew for me like a sarafan, you know,\nlike with no sleeves underneath, you wear a blouse and whatever. And that\u2019s what -- and\nbarefoot all summer long we run barefoot, and I had a glass splinters in my legs, and wood in my\nlegs, and you ask he -- I looked like a tomboy. I was very active. My hair was shaven, still cor --\nshort, didn\u2019t have hair.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Just a little bit in front, like here, and straight, with freckles. I still have freckles, I cover them\nwith --",
        "Q: Not too many. You cover them up.",
        "A: -- with make-up a little bit. With freckles, my brother also had freckles. I even have on my\nhands freckles. But -- and then we were happy to be together with my father.",
        "Q: How long did it take you to get used to your father again?",
        "A: Oh, it took awhile, months.",
        "Q: It did?",
        "A: I -- yeah. And he --",
        "Q: Were you frightened of him in some way?",
        "A: No, we were not frightened. It just -- he was not the same person like we remember, warm\nand loving. He was like keeping distance from the army, from being wounded, and he start\ndrinking, and the -- they taught him how to drink alcohol. He started to drink, so -- he worked\nvery hard, he worked with iron. They were melting iron in a big factory, and making like all kind\nof -- I don\u2019t know, ammunition or whatever, parts or whatever. He worked very hard, and they\nwere rationing us with bread. So while he was working very hard, a physical job, he got a ration\nof bread daily, a kilo bread. Kilo bread is like two -- two and something pounds. A kilo bread.\nMy mom had a half of it, half a kilo bread, and we got together, me and my brother, half a kilo.\nSo we had two kilo breads, which you will think it\u2019s a lot, yeah, it\u2019s like a loaf of bread for four\npeople. But except bread, we didn\u2019t have anything to eat. We didn\u2019t have butter, we didn\u2019t have\nmarmalade, we didn\u2019t have any butter or whatever. And my mom used to say, in Yiddish she\nsay, \u201cGod, when I am going to eat a piece of white bread with butter?\u201d I looked at her, \u201cMama,\nwhat is butter?\u201d [speaks foreign language here]. You know it? That\u2019s what she wanted. White\nbread --",
        "Q: Bread with butter.",
        "A: -- with butter. Then I went to school --",
        "Q: Tell me something. Were you sick at all, you and -- besides the malaria --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- because of not getting proper nutrition?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. At this place, we got sick with the eyes. My a -- my eyes and my brother\u2019s eyes,\nwhen it come evening, we didn\u2019t see anything. Why -- and his eyes got swollen with a lot of pus\ncoming out, like -- like this, like balloons. My -- we didn\u2019t see, we were walking like blind, like\nthis, you know?",
        "Q: At night?",
        "A: In the evening, yes.",
        "Q: Evening.",
        "A: Stretching my brother behind me, holding me like this, and I was walking like --",
        "Q: What was [indecipherable |",
        "A: -- like a zombie. We didn\u2019t know. Later I find out. My mother took us to the doctors there, to\na clinic and they used to put very strong drops into our eyes. It was burning like hell. We cried\njust that when she touched us. They put drops and she washed our eyes with some lukewarm\nwater, with the nice cleaning, you know, ma -- fabric. So she wiped our eyes. During the day it\nwas fine, we could see. When evening came -- they call it in Russian -- I will say and then\ntranslate kurina slepota. Kurina means chicken blindness. That\u2019s how they call it. It was not a\nprofessional medical name.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But that was the symptoms that a lot of people, usually children, had because we didn\u2019t have\nvitamins, we didn\u2019t have proper food and hygiene, nothing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So that\u2019s -- children were dying like flies there.",
        "Q: Of that?",
        "A: Yeah. Not just from that.",
        "Q: From other things.",
        "A: They had brain sickness. They were swollen.",
        "Q: They had what sickness? Whe --",
        "A: Brain.",
        "Q: Brain.",
        "A: The brain -- was attacking the children\u2019s brain, they died like flies. We -- remember that\nevery other day we lived in a barrack, it was -- each one had their own, like 30 families and we\nknew one another. Every other day there was a -- a funeral for the children. And one family, two,\nthree kids died. They got swollen and this and brain damage or whatever, fever, and they died.\nAnd you know, out of this sadness, we run to the cemetery because there was a tradition that\nwhen they buried somebody, they gave you a little bit -- a small piece of bread with honey. And\nthis for us, it\u2019s irony, it\u2019s sad, was like a holiday to get a piece of bread with honey, we never\nsaw honey.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And that was a tradition. And they were buried, a lot of friends I remember, 1n particular one\nlittle girl with blue eyes, her name was Nina. And then her brother, younger brother died, too.\nBut life must go on. We had -- I went to school -- I went to second grade, third grade. I learned\nvery fast Russian, to write in Russian and read. We didn\u2019t have books, or didn\u2019t have paper to\nwrite, like you have nice paper. My father cut up from the newspaper the white side, sewed it up\nwith the needle and thread and I used to write on this my homework and everything. I-It\u2019s not a\nfairy tale --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- it\u2019s the truth, I remember that. And --",
        "Q: So he sewed these strips of paper together so --",
        "A: Yeah, this -- the white strips from the newspaper.",
        "Q: -- so that you would have a whole --",
        "A: Yeah, that I could write, you know? It was clean, narrow and long --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- so I could -- and we had not a pen that you have ink inside. We had a inker, a little thing\nand we put the pen into the ink --",
        "Q: Right, so you write.",
        "A: -- and write til it end. And we put spots on it, you know, they were spreading li --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We call it clocks",
        "Q: Especially on the newspaper it would spread.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: We have to stop the tape.",
        "A: Okay. Oh my God.\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: We ended where you were going to school, but I want to go back to all of these sicknesses\nand the children dying.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Was this very hard on you --",
        "A: Very.",
        "Q: -- to see all these children?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were you --",
        "A: We were actually very scared.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And especially my parents. You couldn\u2019t help it, what\u2019s -- was happening, it was like an\nepidemic.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And young children were dying. Nobody could explain why and how it comes, they just got\nswollen, got high fever, like a brain fever or whatever, and then the next day or two they were\ngone. And was --",
        "Q: So it was really fast, also?",
        "A: It was fast, it was fast and there were too many children age six, seven, like that, died. And\nout of that tragedy that I understand today, we were happy to run to the cemetery to get this piece\nof bread with honey.",
        "Q: Yes. So it was --",
        "A: Can you imagine --",
        "Q: Yes, I can imagine --",
        "A: -- that survival --",
        "Q: -- what survival does.",
        "A: -- that survival does. We were crying. I remember that Ninotchka -- her name was Ninotchka\nwith blue eyes, blonde hair, Russian child, was beautiful, always playing, she was chubby. And I\nwas the skinny one and the mother sometime brought me a piece of potato, like baked in the\noven. They call it kartoshka in Russian. And they were very nice people, Russian people, the\npeasants or whatever. They were very hospitable.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Very nice people. And we live like brothers and sisters, we played.",
        "Q: Then she died.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: A lot. And then her little brother died, too [indecipherable]. I remem --",
        "Q: Were you scared?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: You were scared.",
        "A: But we didn\u2019t understand about dead too much, because they said -- they were very religious,\nthe people, the Russian and they said that they go to heaven. I ask my mom what is heaven\nbecause we were not religious at all. We knew Jewish, we knew we Jewish, and my mom say,\n\u201cIn heaven it\u2019s a place of like beautiful trees, beautiful green flowers and nice weather and all the\npeople are happy and playing together, children, so she went to heaven.\u201d So one day I cry, I say,\n\u2018T don\u2019t want to go to heaven.\u201d She say, \u201cWhy?\u201d I say, \u201cBecause she\u2019s not around here. I miss\nher and if I go to heaven I will not see you or my brother.\u201d I already started to think about things\nlike that. I say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to heaven, I want to be here with you.\u201d And my mom hugged\nme, she say, \u201cOkay Surele, you\u2019re not going to heaven. You\u2019re growing old here, and this is the\nhell.\u2019 So we live -- we are in hell now.",
        "Q: Did you get sick again, or was it the eye sickness, maybe --",
        "A: No, after the eye sickness, we were eating better, because my mom worked and my father\nworked, and they had a lot of -- we didn\u2019t have enough bread probably, but there was on the\nmarket always, potatoes, or a carrot to buy and this, and she cooked soup, you know?",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: She cooked a lot of soup with bread, if you can. And so we put a piece of bread like this, in\nthe spoon like that, it was dripping --",
        "Q: Dripping onto the bread",
        "A: -- so we don\u2019t lose the liquid, so it went on the bread, and then the bread was, you know, e-\neaten.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was very dear, like a commodity. If you give me today gold, I will not cherish that like that\npiece of bread and soup. Then my sister came. We did not know that Mom is pregnant and I did\nnot understand. I was already nine years old.",

I said, do whatever, I am on my own, not going with you.\nI am going by myself. This is my woods too. You know, I was then not letting do anything to\nme. So I picked -- first what I did, I ate the berries, whatever they grow. The toot -- the\nblueberries, and all kind of berries, the raspberries, everything. First what I did, I ate.

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Put in the sack, and put mushrooms. I pick mushroom. I knew each mushroom by name and\nwhich mushroom is poisonous. I learned from them. So I put the mushrooms in this. And there\nwas also wild, like -- it was like -- no, green -- no, how you call it, the green chives?",

We are Polish\nrefugee. There was no anti-Semitism there then. They didn\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s because of a\nsmall place, they didn\u2019t know that we are Jews or that -- they call me Szurka, that\u2019s -- that was a\nRussian name. Surele my mom called me, and Szurka in Russian. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a short name\nfrom Alexandra in Russian.",

My mom was pregnant and my father used to work night shifts.\nIt was like 24 hours, from time when he went to work, it was like 24 hours, then he came home.\nHe was earning good money, and bread, you know. There was rations, bread. So one night in the\nmorning, it was like two o\u2019clock in the morning, my s -- mother started to -- I don\u2019t know how\nyou say in English, is [Yiddish word] like in Yiddish, oy, oy, she was moaning.

There was a little table in the middle, a window, and me and my brother in one bed\non straw, no mattress, nothing. And we cover with a cover, with a ma -- coat, or whatever. And\nmy mom start to moan and she woke me up, Surele, Surele. When there was something wrong,\nshe spoke to me in Yiddish, not in Russian, you know? So I woke up, I say, \u201cMama, what\nhappen?\u201d I cried. She said, oy, like this. She say, \u201cGo and bring that babushka.\u201d There was an\nold lady. It was like from our place to go through a railroad that was a slope going up -- up, and\nthere was a railroad and then you go down to the village, and I knew where she lived, the\nbabushka. So, it was almost three in the morning, I run, and it was April. It was raining before, it\nwas mud all over because the roads were not paved, there were no roads in the village. And I put\nmy mother\u2019s shoes, of course, her size was, I think, 39 then, and I was little. I put my mother\u2019s\nshoes, and I\u2019m running. I put something on myself, I don\u2019t remember what I put, something, and\nI running and crying, running and crying. And that -- my mother should not die, my mother\nshould not die, my mother is sick. I go fast to -- to get babushka, she will help her. So, the\nbabushka lived in a small hut also, nobody had a hou -- tall houses, nobody. It was a barrack, one\nroom and that\u2019s it. No luxuries. So I knocked in the window, in the babushka\u2019s window. M -- she\nwas prepared. She told my mother, if something happened to you, send Szuritska -- send Szura to\ncall me, and I will come. So, I knocked in the window a few times, nobody answer, and I start\nscreaming, \u201cBabushka, Babushka, come, my mom is dying.\u201d In Russian [speaks Russian]. I -- I\nthought my mom is dying. So she say, Szurka, like this, she was an old woman -- I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe she was not old then. She was wearing that scarf on the head. A short woman, blue eyes, I\nremember her. We call her babushka, we didn\u2019t know the name. And the babushka came out, she\nsaid to me, \u201cRelax, what happened?\u201d I say, \u201cMama is dying, Mama is in pain, Mama is dying.\nShe send me to you to come.\u201d Okay. So we\u2019re running, running, and there is water, dark, and my\nmother\u2019s shoes were stuck in the mud, and I left it there. I didn\u2019t have time to go back to ge-get\nit, so I took the other shoe off, I\u2019m barefoot, I run, and I remember where that shoe is, you know?\nSo, my mom\u2019s shoes, and she came to the room, she saw my mother, she took me and my\nbrother out, pushed us out of the door. And she said, \u201cStay here, don\u2019t come in.\u201d We don\u2019t know\nwhat happened to Mom, we crying. My brother even more than me, he was crying. He say,\n\u201cWhat happened to mom, she is going to die.\u201d I said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Mordechai. Stay put quiet, be\nquiet. We won\u2019t -- we don\u2019t know, maybe she will not die. The babushka will help.\u201d We -- I\ndon\u2019t know how long we stayed, a few hours.",

My mom didn\u2019t have what to eat. So she said, the babushka, \u201cThis is your little\nsister.\u201d Now we -- we were happy that Mom didn\u2019t die, but there was a sister, we didn\u2019t know\nhow it comes, why?

        "A: They all perished there. But they were heroes. They fought for the Eretz -- Eretz Israel, for\ntheir country. They were very patriotic, young people. We settled in -- in Wroclaw. I went to a\nPolish school nearby because I didn\u2019t know to write and to read in Polish, only in Russian.",

And that was\nnearby, like second street from our house, and my mom sent us to school because it was close,\nand that she didn\u2019t have to take us far away because she was working and my father. So we live\nin one room apartment with a kitchen, but there was running water in the house, and electricity.",
        "Q: Oh, really, running water -- really?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Ever after the -- even right after the war?",
        "A: Yeah, after the war, it was -- Wroclaw was a very beautiful German city. After the war was\ntaking over, and I saw German people being thrown out from the apartments, took whatever they\ncould with them. It was a long, long walk. And I stood with tears in my eyes, although Germans\ndid a lot of atrocity to us, but they were children and old people, mostly, because young Germans\nwere killed in the front or whatever. They were orphans with grandparents, walking and pushing\nthe pushcarts in a long line. As a child that went through a lot, I felt very sorry. Some Polacks\nthrew rocks at them. Farflucta ju -- Deutsche, they called them dirty Deutsch like they called\nfarflucta Juden to us, the Germans.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And at school, in the Polish school, I felt terrible. First of all the Polacks are all blonde\nmostly, blue eyes. I had dark hair. They pulled my hair all the time. Oh, look at that Jewess.\n[speaks Polish here]. You know in Polish [Polish] in a nice way, that Jewess has dark hair.\nWhere did you come from? You killed our Jesus. I didn\u2019t know what Jesus is, what religion,\nnothing then. In Russia there was no religion, nobody talked about anything. I came home\ncrying, dirty Jew, dirty Jew [Polish] like in Polish the parshiva like somebody has a disease, you\nknow, uncurable disease. I never seen such hatreds during the war with the Russian like I\nencountered in Poland. They were so against everything and everybody, especially Jews. Jews\nkilled Jesus, Jews are bad, we have to kill the Jews. I said to my mom, I\u2019m not going to that\nschool. My mom said, where would you go? It\u2019s far away, this is close. I said, I\u2019m not going to\nthat school, they call me names and I don\u2019t know even why. One day she went there and there\nwas a priest, a young priest and she spoke to that priest. He was teaching religion. I approached\nthat priest, I said in Polish -- I learned fast, I said [speaks Polish] you -- like your highness,\npriests, 1n Polish there\u2019s an expression, \u201cCan I stay on the lesson when you teaching religion?\u201d\nHe say, \u201cWhy? You not Catholic.\u201d I says, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference? I want to know why they call\nme dirty Jew, can you explain that to me? Am I dirty? I have dark hair, but I went through the\nwar, and I am surviving, and now I came to free Poland, and I am a dirty Jew.\u201d He said, \u201cWell,\nPll give you a book about the New Testament, and if you don\u2019t understand something, you ask.\u201d\nI read that New Testament, about how the world was created, and about Jesus, where he was\nborn and the Holy Mary. I see they are Jewish too, you know, they came from Israel, from\nNazareth, from the -- Jesus Christ came from the dynasty of David the King. King David. I\nstarted to analyze, I said, \u201cWhy am I a dirty Jew? You also Jewish.\u201d I asked the priest -- I started\nto -- to be more political. You also Jewish, because Jesus Christ and Holy Mary was Jewish. And\nI read the New Testament, but I don\u2019t know the Old Testament. I don\u2019t know anything about\nreligion because in my house they told us we are Jewish and that was it. We didn\u2019t go to\nsynagogue, my parents didn\u2019t go nowhere. There was later, a Jewish synagogue, beautiful, built\n800 years ago by German Jews in that city, and Hitler used to come to Wroclaw and had\nspeeches in a big hall, which 1s still there. It\u2019s a beautiful city. I started bec -- I became very\nconscious of ma -- about my past, and who am I. I ask question, Mama -- in Polish then -- who\nare we? We Jewish, you say. Why don\u2019t we go to pray? Why the Polacks have churches, and\nthey call us dirty Jew, why? Always why. M-My mom said, \u201cI cannot answer you all this. They\ndon\u2019t like us and that\u2019s all, because they claim we killed Jesus Christ.\u201d I say, \u201cBut that\u2019s not true.\nHe was Jewish.\u201d And then there were the Romans. You know, I know very well the history, and\nI just pushed them like this. Nobody can win with me. I said, \u201cI am who I am and you are who\nyou are.\u201d You have to be human. And I found out that there is opening a Jewish school, but it\u2019s\nvery far away from us, where we live. And I said to Mom, \u201cMama, I\u2019m going to Jewish school.\u201d\nShe started [speaks foreign language here] \u201cWhere are you running?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to a\nJewish school.\u201d And while we going to a Jewish school, they will not call us dirty Jew, and no\nanti-Semites, and I don\u2019t want to see them. And beside, they going to feed us there. Food is very\nimportant. They going to give us lunch at school. What I did, like I am a organizer that they call\nme always, commander, my friends, I\u2019m a very organizer, so I said to my friends at the street,\nJewish chi-children, \u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s go register.\u201d That was summertime. We go to\nregister to a Jewish school, and it\u2019s very far away, we have to take two tramways, there was\nelectric s --",

        "A: -- streetcars, and then the communication of buses. It took like an hour to get each way. I got\nall my friends, my Jewish friends from this street, from the other street, we went in the summer,\nwe registered. And now is a problem. The school starts. All of the children speak Russian, they\ncame from Russia, different ages, nobody knows to write or read Polish or Russian, and we s --\nall speak rush -- Polish or Yiddish, and we speak Russian. It\u2019s like [indecipherable]. So, the\nteachers were some of them older, some of them -- and they had a dilemma with different ages,\nhow to place the children in classes, according to their brain and intelligence, everything. They\nput older children, like 10 - 11, because we\u2019re -- I was in the first grade. I was a big girl, and they\nwere little kids. I was embarrassed. I was taller than them. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to that class.\u201d\nSo what they did, very good thing, they gather all the older children that they don\u2019t belong to the\nfirst grade, 10 - 11 - 12 even, and we got into one class, it was intensive study, because we had\nbackground in Russian, we already knew how to read.",

So, I\nwas good, and then we studied Polish and Yiddish to write alphabet and everything for a whole\nyear. And then, according to ages, they placed us in different classes. I went to the fourth grade,\nso I didn\u2019t lose too much.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "A: Two tramways we took, and you know, switched? It took like an hour and a half to get each\nway, but we didn\u2019t mind. We walked home, back, if we wanted to save money to see a movie.",
        "Q: Right.",

So they\nvisited once in awhile, and I remember Zaide Todres, he was the only zaide I had, grandparent --\ngrandfather, because the other one died young, my father\u2019s side. So I had two bubas, granddau --\nba -- mothers, they were wonderful, the family was wonderful and we were all living together,\nand happy. And Chanukah or other holidays, Jewish holidays, they gave us a lot of gifts and\nsweets, and we were happy.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: There was no difference, we never discuss that we are different, or whatever. They spoke\nPolish, we spoke Jewish, but I was home. I never went to a kindergarten there.",
        "A: Because they decided we don\u2019t have money, they poor people, they raise the children in the\nhouse, and there was a buba to -- to look after us, and there was an uncle [indecipherable] who\nlived together in the same area, so I never went then.",
        "A: Yeah, when I became conscious, when Germany invaded Poland, and they bombed Warsaw.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I -- I -- [remember many things. First of all I remember fire, burning houses, burning trees.\nGlass, broken glass, and people running and yelling and shooting. German, with the big German\nshepherd, the dogs --",
        "A: -- with their uniform. Big, tall men with the German uniform with the hats, and the -- the\nboots, they had the high --",
        "A: -- leather boots, and holding the dog next to. And we -- when Warsaw was bombed, we didn\u2019t\nhave electricity, didn\u2019t have water in the apartment. So we were going -- first of all, my father\nwas very active in a Jewish Bund. they call it, the organization, that he was always being arrested\nbefore the first of May or whatever, because they made riots. It was very political organization,\nused to wear a Jewish uniform. And he knew what\u2019s going to happen, and said to the family,\n\u201cWe have to leave Warsaw, we have to go away, they\u2019re going to kill all Jews, because Germans\nkill -- Germans do all that atrocity, I see and we know it.\u201d But nobody was expecting anything.\nMy grandmother Chana and the other brother says to my father, du meshugener, Moishe. \u201cYou\ncrazy. Why you going away, why you want to run away?\u201d He says, \u201cI have to.\u201d So my\ngrandmother says, \u201cBut we have the war before,\u201d 1914, the far -- first war, World War, \u201cnothing\nhappened, they da -- we were hungry, we didn\u2019t have food, but nothing happened to us, nobody\nkilled us. Just people who were on the front, in the line, they were killed sometime, but nothing\nwill happen to us, why to run away?\u201d He said, \u201cI am going away. I take my wife and the\nchildren. Who wants to come with me? I\u2019m going to hire a buggy with a horse, and we\u2019ll run\naway from Warsaw.\u201d Nobody listened.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Yeah --",
        "A: -- they talking --",
        "A: They were talking in front of me, and I was asking later questions when I understood more,\nwhy, and this and my father came -- well, first I want to tell you how I got encountered with the\nGerman, with the atrocity.",
        "A: Since there was no water in the house, we had to go with pails and get water on the cemetery,\nnot far, they call it Powanski, the cemetery in Warsaw. So we have to get water, there was a\npump, and water running. So people stood on line and got water in pails. So I had a little pail\nalso I was carrying and my mother had two. We brought water, whatever we could we gave to\nthe buba, to everybody. They also went to get water. So what I seen, young German soldiers with\nthe dogs, with the shepherds, with the big stick wi -- you know, like a big pole and a rubber, very\nheavy rubber. They put a Jewish man that was walking, with a beard, you can see it\u2019s a Chassidic\nJew. They grabbed him, and the Germans said [speaks foreign language here] you dirty Jew. And\ntook a knife out from his boot, and cut it with -- not just the beard, with the -- it was running\nblood, he touch his flesh, and pushed him aside, he fell. So many things that they stepped with\nthe dogs, you know, like very vicious. And my father saw that, and I was crying and my mom\nsaid, Surele -- I was holding her dress because she -- her hands were busy with the two pi -- pails\nof water, I was holding her dress, and she said to me in Yiddish Surele [speaks Yiddish here],\nclose your eyes, my child. Surele she called me all the time, and I loved that name. And she said,\nSurele [Yiddish], don\u2019t look. Please let\u2019s go fast home. And I saw that horses lying, electric\npoles, because they bombed Warsaw. So whatever there was bombing, houses destroyed, sa --\nthe streets, there was a chaos. People didn\u2019t know where to go, what to do. So one evening my\nfather decided to bring a carriage with a horse, and he said to my mom [speaks Yiddish], take\nwhatever you can, but not [indecipherable]. They sew in, because they had nice jewelry, nice\nclothe -- my father was dressed very elegant, in suit. I used to shine his shoes, it has to be like a\nmirror. In Poland still as a big girl I did that. He taught me.",
        "A: He was so pedantic, so meticulous.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Some things that -- yeah. My mother had a few rings, a wedding band, and a few rings, my\nfather too. They sew it into the clothing, you know? They had dresses, a coat in winter. It was\nSeptember, November already, it was cold and raining, so we gathered all the warm clothes. My\nmom had a few small suitcases with food for us. So my fa -- my si -- brother was dressed very\nnice, he had a -- a gray coat, a small, with a little heart, you know, you g -- pull it, close it here.\nHe was so cute. And shoes, and they put us -- everybody cried, and nobody wanted to come with\nus.",
        "A: Yes. I cried, too, and my mom held my eyes so that I should not see. It was nighttime and\nthey were running and the city of Warsaw was burning. And people running and noises all over.\nI never forget that. And I ask a question once, my mom and dad -- we spoke mostly Yiddish at\nhome --",
        "A: -- but we knew Polish, too. I say [speaks foreign language here], \u201cWhy is this happening?\nWhy?\u201d So my father say, \u201cBecause we are Jews. Because Germans hate us, they want to destroy\nus.\u201d I said, \u201cBut why? What did we do different. We are living here, you were born here, your\nfather was born in -- everybody was living, they have roots. Why?\u201d He said, \u201cI cannot explain\nwhy, that\u2019s what happens.\u201d And we run, we run out of Warsaw, burning Warsaw.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: Yeah, we run away.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: I didn't understand then. I knew that he had a uniform and thing, and he used to disappear for\ndays, you know, they used to arrest him, and th-the whole bunch. And I didn\u2019t know that. Mom\nused to say, oh, your father went away, he\u2019ll come home soon, he has some business, this and\nthat. But at those days I -- I didn\u2019t comprehend --",
        "A: -- what it is, what Bund is, nothing.",
        "A: But he was a long, long, time member, and they were fighting against the Nazis --",
        "A: -- and everything.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if some left, I know that -- I know a few who just died. Meed was his name,\nBenjamin Meed.",
        "A: He was also in the same organizati-zation --",
        "A: -- as my father, yeah, and he has this ghetto si -- Warsaw ghetto survivor organization --",
        "A: -- that he was running it. I used to attend.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: There was, in the corridor -- li-lived in apartments and there was like a hallway.",
        "A: And in the hallway there was pump with water. So it was not running water in your kitchen or\n[indecipherable] we have to carry the water in pails, bring it to the apartment to kitchen, and use\nit. Or washing whatever you have to wash -- we didn\u2019t have showers.",
        "A: Not even a bathroom in the room, we had to go outdoors.",
        "A: Yes, yes. And a -- a funny story.",
        "A: The bathroom thing that they used, my grandmother Chana used to take a pail of all the dirty\nstuff, that we peed, or other things and throw it out at night somewhere on a corner that doesn\u2019t\ntouch nobody or will not smell some in the middle of the street. So I -- she was very superstition.\nSo, she took me with her sometime and sometime my mom. I didn\u2019t understand then, but I will\ntell you what she did. They were so superstitious then that they believed that dead bodies, dead\npeople walk at night around us, but we don\u2019t see them. So she used to say, before she spilled that\ndirt, she used to say, \u201cScheidem, scheidem,\u201d -- scheidem is like dead bodies, \u201cScheidem, gay\navek, gay avek.\u201d",
        "A: Go away. We have things to do, go away, don\u2019t stay in front of us. On all four sides. East,\nwest, south, no-north, wherever. Four sides she turned, and she say the same thing --",
        "A: -- scheidem, scheidem [indecipherable], please excuse me, go away. And then, after she went\nto all the four sides, she did the business, she threw it away. And I was standing, and I was really\nafraid. I didn\u2019t know exactly what scheidem 1s, but she explained like dead bodies and this. I\ndidn\u2019t associate with d-dead bodies then, I didn\u2019t see too many. So I couldn\u2019t understand, but\nwhen I got older, I know the superstitious, you know, people had in the old days, everybody 1s\nsuperstitious. So I understood the way they treated the dead bodies with respect, that they might\nbe hurt by her. This is a very funny thing.",
        "A: There are many things. I used to -- my Aunt Reisl, which 1s like a -- a rose, yeah? She was the\nonly sister of six brothers. She was beautiful, she was a seamstress with her husband also,\nHerman.",
        "A: Of my father. They had four children. Two of the names I remember. One, the name -- the\nfirst born by everybody in the family Szlinger was Mordechai, Mijatek. Okay, in Polish, Miyatek.\nLike a translation from Yiddish Mordechai. And the baby girl was Bronia, Bronka they call. And\nthe two others, younger, I don\u2019t remember. They were all redheads. We were a family of\nredheads and I had a lot of freckles. I still have -- that hair, it\u2019s colored, I\u2019m not red originally, I\nhave gray, and then my hair become very dark, after they were cutting my hair in Russia a lot, so\nit becames black, really changed the color. But it was a very happy family. They were not rich,\nbut happy together and singing and dancing, all the movies they saw they were singing the songs.\nThat\u2019s what I talked about Molitik -- and how do I know Molly Pickens? From them.",
        "A: And then I saw her movies. I saw her in Yentl in \u201cFiddler on the Roof.\u201d",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t want to.",
        "A: No. My father came at night, and he prepared us before, told my mom to do some gathering\nthings, clothing, food for the children, everything. It was fall, November was already cold and\nraining. And he asks the brothers and the sisters, also he can get some horses and buggies,\nrenting for money, and run away. So my grandmother Chanaleh -- Chana and others say that my\nbro -- my father\u2019s a meshugener, a crazy. Where you taking young children in such a cold\nbitterness, you running away, why? He says, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be worse. Germany 1s going to kill\nevery Jew, and they going to make camps.\u201d So my buba Chana say, \u201cYou crazy. Before, in the\n14\u2019s, there was a war, nothing happened, we were only hungry. But nothing happened to Jews.\u201d\nSo he said, \u201cWho wants to come with us?\u201d He has a premonition or he knew something from the\norganization what\u2019s going on -- to happen. And seeing dead body in the streets, and dead horses,\nand German running with German Shepherds, and beating every old man or young man, or\ntaking Jewish beards and cut them with blood running. He saw that it\u2019s not good, so he brought\nthat at night, the horse, and my mom was ready. We did not understand anything then, I didn\u2019t\nknow what\u2019s going on. I cried, my brother cried, we were -- you know, hushed up by my mom,\nmy father, and we left. We left Warsaw burning, Warsaw was burning.",
        "A: I remember the fire.",
        "A: Like, do you see, \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d, the burning of Atlanta?",
        "A: That\u2019s how --",
        "A: -- I remember that, too.",
        "A: And the smell and everything and the danger. And the smell of dead bodies, and Germans\nstanding all this, and Polacks standing, you know, they think that never happen to them, and they\nwere happy, smiling, they showing like this. Like they going to be slaughtered like this, you\nknow? They were happy.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yes. Yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes. So, at night we didn\u2019t know where we running. We\u2019re running and running a few days.\nWe went -- my father told my mom in Jewish that we\u2019re going to a border between Poland and\nRussia. There\u2019s many borders. We went to a place called Zaremby-Koscielne. It\u2019s a Polish -- it\u2019s\na -- Koscielne means churches, a place of churches. There were probably a lot of churches in\nthat, that\u2019s why it\u2019s called Zaremby-Koscielne in Polish. Kosciel is me -- 1s Polish, a church. So\nwe went to Zaremby-Koscielne. It was raining, cold. We had some clothes, some this, but it was\nwet, we were soaked wet. They -- the horse and buggy -- the buggy wa -- the carriage was open,\nwe didn\u2019t have any cover, only a -- the blankets which were soaked already, and we came to that\nplace. It was woods and a big field, raining, dark and -- and gray, very bitter cold, and we\nstopped there. The German -- that was a border between Russia and Polish. I don\u2019t know exactly\nthe geography, but it\u2019s -- was somewhere in the south, it\u2019s -- was -- bete -- we were supposed to\ngo to Bialystok. It was Russian border then, now Bialystok is back Polish.",
        "A: Bialystok means a white mountain, Bialystok. And we stood in Zaremby-Koscielne, Germans\nwere around us with dogs, of course, and from the trees, the pine trees, my father made like a\nchalash, like the Indian live in this. But the rain penetrated anywhere, so we were wet there, the\nbedding that they brought, everything was soaked, we were cold, my feet were frozen, and my\nbrother cried, my brother cried, he was always hungry. He was a baby, he didn\u2019t understand. One\nday they took everybody out on the field, like gathering together. My father was holding my\nbrother on his ha -- in his hand. I was holding my mother\u2019s hand, nothing else, and the Germans\ncame like making an ins-inspection. Who this and this and my brother cried, Mordechai cried, so\nmy father held him like this and said, shh. So the German came over with this stick, the rubber\nstick, slashed my father\u2019s face with it, and with such a rage. I don\u2019t know why, there was no\nreason. He just beat him with that and cr -- and here was open and blood was running his -- over\nthe -- his face, so my -- we all cried. I cried, my mom cried and my brother cried very much. So\nthe German, zai schtul, mas schtul, be quite. And we stopped. So the German came, one German\nhad a piece of salami like the [indecipherable] thing, he gave it to my brother.",
        "A: Like -- like this length, yeah --",
        "A: -- anarrow piece of good wurst, salami. And my father took and shared with all four of us, we\nate. And he says to him, you have very nice children, but don\u2019t stay here. That means he was\nhuman. He had to do his job, the German, but he told us, my father especially not to be here,\nbecause Germany is taking young men to the country and they started already, they prepared for\nconcentration camps. We didn\u2019t know that then, but now, after this, you know the history, they\nprepared that in Poland, the railroads and the barracks, they were built before the concentration --\nyears before, they prepared. And I don\u2019t understand one thing. Did they not realize what is it for?\nNobody spoke about it, nobody knew about it? That\u2019s a puzzle to me, because it was done\nbefore, years before. All the barracks, all the railroads to go from all -- it was a big, big project to\ndo, from all over Europe to bring trains to this place. To Treblinka, to Auschwitz.",
        "A: They prepared long time before they started to do it. And I think the Polish government knew\ntoo, but it was not a Communist government there, it was other. So, when --",
        "A: -- when -- when the German gave us salami and everything, where everybody was happy,\nthey say go to your places, my father said to my mom -- I knew later, I didn\u2019t know as a child\nwhat happened, that you stay with the children, try to break the border. Go to Russia, and I am\nrunning to Bialystok and I will wait for you in the synagogue. There was a big Jewish synagogue\nin Bialystok. And over there we will meet. I don\u2019t know when we will come. My father\ndisappeared the next day. We didn\u2019t know anything, we cried. My mom said, shh to me. My\nbrother didn\u2019t understand, he was little. But she told me, \u201cSurele, don\u2019t cry. Your father will\ncome. We will meet with Father. Just be good girl.\u201d We didn\u2019t have food, but the German didn\u2019t\nbother then so much, so my mom went -- she left us alone with some other older people to\nwatch, and she went to work. There were a lot of Jewish Polish families living there in Zaremby-\nKoscielne, and she went to look for work, whatever. She could cook, she could clean, she could\ndo anything, watch children, and she found a little job by very rich family that they came from\nRussia pal -- they -- they send them to this place like, you know, a punishment, something, the\nCommunists or whatever. And she cleaned there, she cooked and she brought some food for us,\nwhatever leftover, potatoes, a little bit chicken, whatever, bread. We were happy to have that.",
        "A: On the field.",
        "A: On the field as a -- for long.",
        "A: Refugee -- like a refugee place. It was not wired, nothing. It was [indecipherable] from all the\nsides surrounded. It was like a field, open field between woods.",
        "A: No, nothing.",
        "A: Nothing, that -- the pine trees my father cut that they put together like in a V --",
        "A: That was all.",
        "A: Everything. When was nice weather my mother took out the -- the goosefeathers, you know,\nthe blanket from goosefeather, very heavy. They call it a perine in Yiddish. It\u2019s like a\ngoosefeather blanket, very heavy. I still have one. It\u2019s good for the winter, it\u2019s light.",
        "A: To dry, yeah, and then to cover us at night that we don\u2019t feel cold. My feet were swollen from\ncold, I couldn\u2019t walk. My toes, still today when it\u2019s bad weather --",
        "A: -- [have my big toes swollen bigger, and they itch. Before, I had blisters, it was swollen from\nthe cold and I had blisters, I couldn\u2019t even walk. But there was no medication to -- to heal it, just\ntime did it, but I still feel when it\u2019s very cold I feel they bother me like needles coming through,\nand -- and psychological -- psychologically I will always remember this thing what happened,\nbecause it was a tremendous impact on my life as a child, to go through this and not\nunderstanding why. Now I know why. I know the politics, I know what happened, now I know\nwhy. But then, what the German did to children and later on with the camps, that was terrible\nwhat they did. That was the worst part. These were intelligent, educated people. Germany was a\nvery advanced -- with everything, technologically, and a -- and how could a nation do that to\nevery people in the world, and not just Jews, to Russian, [indecipherable] and Gypsies.",
        "A: Exterminating millions and millions and the whole world stood still. Why? Nobody cared.\nNobody said anything. So when we tried to smuggle the border, my mother tried every evening\nto -- there were the booths, and there was a Polish soldier on this side, Russian soldier -- you\nknow, they like -- on the border they had a booth, yes, one Polish flag and one side the Russian\nflag, and soldiers in their uniforms. The Russians stood with the rifles, and the Polish with the\nrifles. So my mother took us every day, sometime in the evening, sometime in the afternoon, but\nnot at dark, and she spoke Russian and she spoke Polish to the other. I remember the Russian\nsoldier got upset, he took the rifle and say in Russian, \u201cDavai na zad.\u201d Go back. My mother\ndidn\u2019t want to move back, and she started to beg and cry. He pushed her with the carabine -- with\nthe rifle, with the other side, with the wooden side, pushed her in here and my mother fell, and\nshe didn't move. And we thought my -- the mother is dead. Me and my brother started to cry.\nMomma, Momma, we spoke Polish. Momma stine, Momma styoff in Yiddish. Get up, get up\nMomma. You not dead, you not dead. And the -- my mother was like fainted or whatever, she\ndidn\u2019t move. So the soldier came over, the Russian, yelling at us, davai na zad, but we didn\u2019t\nknow what davai na zad is. Go back, go back. But s -- I cry, |say Momma, Momma. And they\nspoke Polish on the border, the Russian spoke Polish. I said to him in Polish, \u201cMy mom is dead?\nMy mom is not living?\u201d So he say, \u201cYour mom 1s going to be fine.\u201d He went down, I don\u2019t know\nwhat he said to her. She later told me. When she came to herself, sh -- he picked her up, he -- her\n-- she was all in mud, it was muddy, rainy, and we went back to our place. And she tried again.\nWith the Polish soldier nothing, they -- they were very rude, they couldn\u2019t do it. One day -- she\nkept separ -- now I understand she kept secrets from me or brother -- my brother was little. She\ncouldn\u2019t tell me. And she said one day to me, \u201cSurele, gather everything what we have the little\nbundles, put everything together and we go for a walk in the evening.\u201d It was a nice evening, it\nwas not raining and it wasn\u2019t cold, it was dry. And we walked. I was holding my mom by the\nskirt because she was holding my brother, he couldn\u2019t walk too much. And Mordechai, my\nbrother, the chubby guy, always was hungry, always. He liked food and was hungry. He was\ncrying because he was hungry. And whenever I had a piece of bread she gave us the same ration,\nI cut a piece for him later. I knew he will cry, so I gave him my share. One evening we went to\nthe woods, didn\u2019t tell us anything. She say we going here, maybe we\u2019ll find something to eat,\nsome grass growing or mushrooms, you know, wild mushrooms, wild grass, and we\u2019 ll find. And\nit was dark, it was twilight, you know, it wasn\u2019t light any more. But we could still see, and we\nwere walking along the line and there was a wire, you know, there were -- it was wired, the\nwhole thing. And all of a sudden my mom says, \u201cSit here, let\u2019s sit here.\u201d We sat on the grass, my\nmother went to the wire to the gate, and underneath she pushed it up, there was like a hole. Later\nI find out that the soldier, when he beat her and she was laying like that, he told her, at night you\ngo here, and there is a open wire. And you go to the woods. And he told her what to expect. She\ndidn\u2019t say anything to us, nothing, we were too little, and we could tell. So what happened? She\ndigged a little bit, she pushed my brother underneath, fine, she pushed me, and then she made a\nlittle higher, I was holding up the wire a little bit, lifted it as much as I could for five years old.",
        "A: So we went through, and we had a little thing, my mother was holding my brother, I was her\nskirt, because she needed two hands, always with her skirt, she was wearing a long skirt, warm.\nAnd we\u2019re walking, and it\u2019s dark and I used to hear stories about wolves and -- and wild animals,\nthat they going to eat us up, and my mom said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, nobody is going to eat us, there\u2019s\nnobody, it\u2019s too cold.\u201d All of a sudden -- we walk, we walk maybe an hour or more, I see some\nlight. I had very good vision, I see some light far away like a little light. I said, Mama, Mama\n[speaks Yiddish] in Yiddish, I said to her, \u201cLook, there\u2019s some light.\u201d She says, \u201cShh, don\u2019t say.\u201d\nShe knew where we going. We came closer, there\u2019s a little wooden shack, like, and lights. We\ncame in, we knocked into the door, a older woman opened the door. And there was a man -- I\nfeel chills when I tell that, because I remember that story well. And the woman said to her, to my\nmother, in Polish, \u201c\u201cWho are you?\u201d Kto ty jest?

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: The three. We were not -- never separated. I clinged to my mother, my mother took care of\nthe brother, the little baby boy.",
        "A: And because he always cried, he was not like I. I don\u2019t understand myself how I was patient\nat this age of five, five and something, that I never cried and I never ask for anything, I always\nheld my mother\u2019s skirt. Be -- I -- I was afraid to be separated because people used to run and\nlosing one another and yelling and not finding one another. That was terrible show. But I\nremember. So we slept, they gave us food 1n that little shack.",
        "A: Yes. And they gave us dry clothes, you know, like a big rubashka, she will ask what it is, like\na nightgown --",
        "A: -- but made of cotton, rough cotton, you know, with long sleeve and long -- it was too long\nfor me, for my age, but I kept warm. I was so warm, it was so good and dry, you know?",

In the morning\nyou will have to leave.\u201d So my mom cried, she said, \u201cWhere would I go with the little sick\nchildren? My child\u2019s legs are frozen, Sarah\u2019s legs.\u201d So she say -- she gave me some bandages to\ncover the wounds and she gave us food and my mom took out her wedding band and gave it to\nthem because we didn\u2019t have money to pay. She didn\u2019t want to tell -- take it, as -- and Momma\nsays, \u201cTake it. Maybe one days you will help somebody also. You need that.\u201d In the morning we\nwere sleeping very comfortable then all of a sudden we woke up to light. There was like a\nflashlight coming down [indecipherable] on the floor, flashlight came to our face. I opened my\neyes and got scared. And my mom say vynish, vynish, don\u2019t cry. And the Russian ask my mom,\n\u201cYou a Russian?\u201d Because her father came from Kiev, he taught her Russian, Yiddish, write and\nspeak. My grandfather Todres from Kiev, he was an educated man. And she spoke to them in\nRussian, they spoke Russian and he ask her [indecipherable] and I remember he ask where are\nyou from, why are you running, where is your husband? Fast. She say, \u201cMy husband is dead, the\nGerman killed him.\u201d And I looked, I -- I didn\u2019t say a word. And he ask me [speaks Russian\nhere], in Russian. \u201cGirl, come here, come here, we\u2019ll give you some candies,\u201d and this, and one\nof the soldier took me and he hugged me. He say that I have nice long hair, curly hair. I\u2019m a nice\nlooking girl, and my brother, he was holding us, gave us something to eat. And he say in\nRussian, \u201cWhere 1s your father?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know my father.\u201d I started to cry, \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow, the German took him.\u201d So he says, \u201cOkay. We came with the wagon, with the horse and\nwe\u2019re going to tel -- take you to the border. Whatever you have, gather. In a half an hour we\u2019re\ngoing to take you away from here. You cannot stay here.\u201d So the woman, that Polish woman told\nMom in Polish that -- don\u2019t be afraid, these Russian soldiers they don\u2019t want any spies in the\nborder because Russia was not at war then --",
        "A: -- with Germany. But they were very careful. So they took us on a horse and buggy, and --\nover the woods, it was still twilight -- it was like not yet day, you know, like four o\u2019clock, five\no\u2019clock in the morning. And my mother was sitting in the wagon, also spread with the hay, and\nthe horse took us and the soldiers in front with the carabine, you know, with the rifle, and we\nwent. How long I don\u2019t remember, it was long enough, over the woods, then we came on the sk -\n- on the skirts of the woods. There was a city. I see a city because I remember Warsaw was a big\ncity, big houses and people running, this and that, and he brought us to the synagogue in\nBialystok.",
        "A: Yes. We came with the Russian soldiers, with this, to Bialystok. In Bialystok it was a big\nshul. I remember many, many people, children, men, women. Everybody yelling, screaming,\nrushing, ri -- calling names, looking for names, Moishe, Chaim, all kind of Jewish names. Chani,\n[indecipherable]. People were looking for one another. It was a big, big place with benches, you\nknow, and -- and they were looking. And my mom started to yell my father\u2019s name, Moishe,\nMoishe, you know, his name. And all of a sudden somebody came to my mom and say, \u201cWho do\nyou looking for?\u201d [speaks foreign language here], who you looking for? She say, \u201cMoishe\nSzlinger,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, Moishe Szlinger, I know, I saw him yesterday. A tall man, skinny man\nwith dark brown hair?\u201d \u201cYes, yes, that\u2019s my husband.\u201d \u201cI saw him.\u201d He called another man, and\nhe says, \u201cDo you know where Moishe Szlinger is? That\u2019s his wife and children.\u201d He said,\n\u2018\u201c\u2018Moishe, yeah, he has to come. He went somewhere, but he has to come.\u201d Anyway, my father\nappeared after awhile, and we were all crazy crying. I hugged him by the feet because he was a\ntall man. And he -- he held my brother in his arm, and my mother, crying, everybody hugging,\nhappy that we are alive. And he said, okay, now we going to stay here, we\u2019ll find a place. After\ntwo days my mom find a job. There was a lot of Polish and Jewish rich people in Bialystok.\nThey spoke Yiddish, Polish and Russian because it was on the border. To tell you the truth, the --\nBi-Bialystok Jews, according to my mom and father\u2019s story, were not pleasant to us. They call us\nin Russian the runner ise -- the runner ups, the runners. They call it biezency in Russian.\nBiezency is people who are running. Biezency. So my mom find a job in a very good family. She\nwas cooking, cleaning, washing, and we were staying with them. My father left --",
        "A: -- again. My father was involved with politics, he knew what was going on, that the German\nare still looking, you know. Bialystok 1s still Polish, but any day it can become either Russian, or\nGermany comes there. So --",
        "A: No, the Russians, no. The Russians were in between, you know? So it was like already end of\n1939, winter. We stood there a few months and then they -- there was rumors, there was writings\nthat if Jews from Poland want to go to Russia to work for a year, they have to sign out papers\nthat they going to be in Russia working, and after a year if they want to stay, they become\nRussian citizens.",
        "A: My father came to my mom and say, \u201cPerla, what do you mean? To go or not?\u201d She say, \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing. I don\u2019t want to come to Warsaw because I don\u2019t know if they are alive. Let\u2019s sign.\u201d So\nthey signed. There were people around us, Polish, Russian speaking, and they signed like an\naffidavit to become Russian citizens and work in Russia. So they took --",
        "A: In Bialystok, yeah. There was a border between Poland, and it was like a neutral city.\nEverybody was there. So, there was a big gathering and my father discussed it with the mom.",
        "A: I hear --",
        "A: -- but I didn\u2019t comprehend what is -- I -- later, when I became older, I ask all the question and\nwe talked about it.",
        "A: How we came, why we came. So my father said to me, we came and we saved our lives.",
        "A: And all my brothers and sister went to the ghetto. But that\u2019s later, I will tell you --",
        "A: -- how we found out. So we signed and they send us to a border town, it\u2019s called Ufa. It was --\nI don\u2019t know what kind -- because they have the oldest countries in Russia separated by this.\nUfa, you ca -- spell it U-f-a.",
        "A: It\u2019s [speaks foreign language here]. Because there were many ethnic people in Russia then,\nafter the revolution.",
        "A: They each had their own like, unity. So we went to Ufa for a year. They signed to work. We\ncame there, it was bitter cold, winter, snow up to -- over the head. They took me and my brother\nto like a kindergarten. They c -- it\u2019s a center for children, it\u2019s for six days a week. The seventh\nday they could take the children to their homes and return them the next day. We had food and\nclothing, whatever. There were many orphans there. They call it Yasly, Yasly like a kindergarten\nfor younger children, you know, not -- there is another word for that, too, but it\u2019s for little kids,\nyou know?",
        "A: I said, we cried.",
        "A: We cried.",
        "A: They had to work.",
        "A: My mom was working like a factory, they were making bricks, from all kind of material and\nshe used to carry this heavy stuff to put it away. And my father worked also with fire there, th-\nthey were making all kind of ironwork.",
        "A: Probably it was military, I think.",
        "A: It was a secret, but I assumed when we were talking, there was then a secret, my mom was\ncarrying bricks, and this, and once the brick fell on her leg and she couldn\u2019t walk, she was in a\ncast. And that was for one year. And I remember on Saturday night they used to pick us up.\nSaturday afternoon after work, and the road was full of snow, and there was a railroad in the\nmiddle, we were walking on the railroad.",
        "A: Another railro -- road, regular railroad, and on [indecipherable] side the snow was so high,\nmountains of snow all over, that -- my father was tall, he couldn\u2019t reach the top of it, you know?\nAnd they used to carry us, my mom, and my brother and I was holding their hands. And all ofa\nsudden you hear [indecipherable] was the -- the locomotive, toot too, like a long -- they knew\nthat people walking on it. So, when my father saw from far away the locomotive coming, he\nthrew me on the slope of the -- of the snow, and my brother --",
        "A: -- to the other side, and they were standing each one like squeezing themself between that --\nthe railroad and --",
        "A: -- the train that came in the snow. We don\u2019t know how long it lasted til the train went slowly\nthrough, the wagons, everything. We were freezing. My brother cried, always crying. He was\nsuch a prince. He -- he was always uncomfortable, always hungry. He could not take anything\ndifferent, you know, that\u2019s it\u2019s discomforting. Always crying. So when this is -- we were used to\nit already because it happen all the time, they threw us over, you know, on the snow. And they\nlived in a little room with a kitchen, so we had food, and this, and the next day they took us when\nthey were going to work, they took us back to that kindergarten where all the children were.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have toys.",
        "A: They fed us. We -- we -- they told stories, we were singing. My father liked to sing and dance\nand my mom had a won -- beautiful voice. And I s -- we sang all the Yiddish Polish songs with\nthem. Me, I loved them. And the next day they went to work, they brought us back. Th-The --\nthink the first time when they saw me, they didn\u2019t recognize me. And I yelled, \u201cMama, Mama,\nTata.\u201d And they look at me, I have no hair. They shaved our hair, because people had lice,\nchildren too. There was no soap, no nothing.",
        "A: I -- I was shaved and a little like sprigs of hair coming, I had dark hair. Shaved and I have like\na kerchief. You see that picture in that album? This is my first picture when I came from Russia\nand every -- I did not have long hair, only shaved here in the back, and here a little like -- I don\u2019t\nknow how to --",

        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah, everybody\u2019s, everybody\u2019s hair, ev-everybody was bald, all the children.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t feel it that way because first of all we had food to eat and a bed to sleep.",
        "A: And mostly we sleeped in two -- two people in one narrow bed, children, and my brother\ndidn't want to get separated --",
        "A: -- from me, so I slept with him. He was a little boy, he peed at night on the bed, and all of a\nsudden I feel a warm liquid.",
        "A: And then cold. He peed, and that was life. I couldn\u2019t change it. If I could put something under\nthere, but we -- we got used to it. And we lived for a year like that. And that was 1940, s --",

        "A: But mostly women.",
        "A: Mostly women, not --",
        "A: No, not terrible. The terrible thing 1s that we were separated for a whole week.",
        "A: Because they had to work.",
        "A: That we were separated, little, nobody to take. But in Ukraine, in Donbass, they worked, my\nmom and father, also in the factory.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what they were doing, carrying something.

        "A: He was chubby then, he was very good. Our hair started to grow, you know --",
        "A: -- they were very good, it was a nice warm climate. The only thing, it was hard that my\nparents had to work and we both got malaria.",
        "A: Me and my brother. And when you have malaria, all of sudden you have chills, or all of a\nsudden you will get hot, you know? When you have high temperature, you getting chills --",
        "A: -- if you cold.",
        "A: So we were shivering like -- like this and my mom had to work and we were locked in the\nroom by ourselves, me and my brother. You see, today, they would put you in a hospital.",
        "A: But we had to survive, and we did.",
        "A: And it was a hard time. And -- but, was a good year, and then was a terrible thing what\nhappened. Russia was going to war in June.",
        "A: 1941.",
        "A: They took my father to the army. Stopping?",
        "A: Oh my, you will have a lot of tape.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, my -- we were -- it was in Ukraine, in Donbass, and we lived at this little room from the\nRussian old lady who rented to us, and me and my brother got sick. And all of a sudden --\nmalaria 1s like you have the chills, and you start shivering, and you shaking, your body\u2019s shaking\nand then you cannot even say a word. Your teeth are teetering. And all -- when the temperature\ngoes away, you feel cold, normal. It\u2019s only when you have the high fever you start shivering.\nAnd my mom didn\u2019t have a choice, she had to leave us alone. Actually, I didn\u2019t start from the\nbeginning. It was 1941 in Ukraine when my father was taken to the Russian army, to the front.\nMom and us two children were left in Ukraine, and she worked and we got sick.",
        "A: Yes, yes --",
        "A: -- yes. We got sick, and she had to work. So the babushka, the woman, the older lady that we\ncalled Babushka, it\u2019s like grandma, she was very good to us. She used to bring water, or\nwhatever she could give us, a little bit soup to eat. But we actually stayed by ourselves in the\nroom. And I cover -- when I was sick and shivering, my brother covered me, and I covered him\nwhen he needed to be pampered. And we stayed alone. We stayed alone.",
        "A: Maybe a -- weeks -- maybe weeks, yeah. When we got better, the temperature broke, we were\nvery weak, and tired, and sick. We couldn\u2019t walk. It was very hard, and we didn\u2019t have\nmedication. They should give us canine -- caneen?",
        "A: Quinine.",
        "A: Qanina they call it in Russian. Once my mother got a dose of that from a doctor they gave us,\nbut that was all, we -- we just had to recover by ourselves. Drinking water, or crying and that was\nall.",
        "A: It tooks week -- weeks. Slowly we made step by step in the house holding by the furniture,\nlike this, holding on, standing up, walking. And my brother was always holding me by my\nclothes, or I hold his hand. He never was separated, never. And since his death, I miss him very\nmuch. We were very close. We had a lot of good memories, and he called me Mama.",
        "A: He called --",
        "A: As a child. And I beat him up. I say, I\u2019m not your mama.",
        "A: Yeah. I say, \u201cMordechai, don\u2019t call me mama, I\u2019m not your mama.\u201d You know, I was seven,\neight years old --",
        "A: -- how can I be your mama? You called me mama. So I was angry, and as a child, I -- I\nwanted to defend myself to be more mature. I don\u2019t want you to call me mama, I\u2019m not your\nmama. I\u2019m your sister, Sarah. We spoke Russian then. We -- with my mom we spoke Yiddish\nand Polish and with him, he was little, he didn\u2019t know Yiddish or Polish then, spoke Russian to\nme. So we spoke Russian.",
        "A: Oh yeah, later on, yeah.",
        "A: He -- you saw the pictures, a very big man, very caring, very lovely, good looking man. He\nhas -- I -- I miss him very much. My brother died of cancer of the liver, and he had diabetes. And\nthe last time I visited Israel in November, and I si -- I took him to the Dead Sea, to -- I knew he is\nsick, to give him some good time together, because my younger sister, who was so spoiled by us,\nwe were taking care of her as a child, has no feelings. And she doesn\u2019t even talk to -- she didn\u2019t\ntalk to my brother, and doesn\u2019t talk to me.",
        "A: I don\u2019t understand. We are from the same parents, and everybody has a different attitude.\nMaybe because me and my brother were always attached to the hip because of the war, because\nof being by ourselves. We didn\u2019t have any trauma, no -- no problems to be with one another,\nalways looked for me. Even when I was 14 - 15 in Poland, used to go out with boys, and have\nfriends and he always wanted to come to me. I chased him away. I said, \u201cGo home.\u201d \u201cT will tell\nMom that you\u2019re going out with boys.\u201d I said, \u201cAII right. I\u2019m going out with boys, these are my\nfriends, you go home.\u201d It was very hard to separate him from me.",
        "A: But we were very close all the time, even though I went to America, and he in Israel, we\nalways kept in touch.",
        "A: He married twice, he had the first wife, that\u2019s -- you saw the picture, Tamara, she\u2019s from\nMorocco Jews, Moroccan Jews, a nice family. They have two children, a daughter, Anat, she\u2019s\nnow 46 or something, and named a son, Moishe, after my father, Mojes -- Moishe in Hebrew.\nAnd Moishe has two beautiful daughters. And now it was born on my brother\u2019s birthday,\nDecember 14, 2006, a boy was born, looks exactly like my brother.",
        "A: And they call him Mordechai Eli, and I spoke to them, they say that he is a copy of\nMordechai. I hope to see them.",
        "A: I hope to see them. Very lovely, I love them very much, and I am a very family oriented\nperson. I love my fa-family, I like my children, my grandchildren, everybody. I don\u2019t have\ngrudges against nobody because my life was hard and I now will not concentrate on being angry\nat somebody or being against somebody or hating somebody. I always find love in my heart for\nother people to be helpful. And I miss my brother.",
        "A: I miss him very much.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t understand too much. My mom cried.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: He was a tall, nice looking man, slim. And he said to us not to cry. He hugged me, my\nbrother, my mom, he said it wou -- \u201cThe war will not last long, and I will be back. You just be\ngood to one another, help your mom, and be good to your brother.\u201d I say, \u201cYes, I will, but I want\nyou to come back.\u201d He say, \u201cI will.\u201d So, when he left for the army, we didn\u2019t know anything\nwhere he 1s, what he is doing, no letters, nothing. We did not receive. So, when my -- the war\nstarted in \u00b041, we stayed a few months with the -- in the Ukraine with that woman, Babushka we\ncall her, grandma. She was a very nice person, but my mom say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to stay in\nUkraine.\u201d I -- she say, \u201cWhy Perlina?\u201d Perlina -- she was Perla in Yiddish, but in Russian they\ncall her Perlina. And -- \u201cWhy? Stay here. We\u2019ll take care of the children, you will work.\u201d My\nmom say, I have -- she told me later, \u201cI have memory from my father, born in Kiev, and telling\nme stories about anti-Semitism in Ukraine, how much they were against Jews.\u201d And they\ncollaborated with the Germans, Ukraines, a lot of them. So my mother remembered that, her\nfather\u2019s story, and she evacuated. There was like a Jewish Polish organization that they provided.\nSo we were staying in a different place, and I don\u2019t remember exactly, not long. And then we\nfind out -- oh, my father\u2019s brother, Yukel, and his wife, and daughter and son were living in\nMagnito Gorsk. It\u2019s in Ural.",
        "A: They found that my father was wounded, and he was living in Shchyokino, two -- near the\nforest --",
        "A: Tula.",
        "A: So, somehow he -- he tried, my mother tried to write and there was like a Polish organization.\nThere was a Polish writer woman, was named Wanda Waszylewska. You call it with a W,\nWanda Waszylewska. She was a writer and very active for Jews and Polish people to come\ntogether to live like a Polish society. And through her we find where my father is and through\nmy -- my uncle that they were keeping track of Jewish people and Polish people from Poland.\nAnd we traveled, and my mom, my -- me, my -- my brother in trains, it was very far away.",
        "A: Yes. We traveled all over Russia. They were not elegant trains, it was like cattle trains. Hay in\nthe middle, and there was a little stove, not to keep -- to keep warm, not cold. So one day we had\nbread that was like put in the oven, and like toasted. Dry bread toasted in a sack. And we were\ntransferred from one train to another, and Mom gave me the sack to hold on my back, that sack\nwith bread. It was not that heavy because it was dry, it was not heavy. And pef -- people were\nrunning and pushing to go into the trains, and -- cattle train actually, it was very high up, there\nwas no steps down, nothing. They did not provide any luxury for the refugees. And I remember\nsomebody pulled me up to the train and my mom was behind and pushing my brother up. So I\nheld my brother\u2019s hand and in one hand I had the sack. All of a sudden I feel light, there is no\nsack. Somebody took it away, we never find it. We cried. We didn\u2019t have our chlebushka, you\nknow, like my brother cried, Mama, chlebushka? Mama, give me bread. He was always hungry\nand he always cried. Chlebushka. I call him chlebushka always, you know? That -- that was the\nRussian word for bread, but in a very nickname like -- like endearing. It\u2019s called chleb in\nRussian.",
        "A: But chlebushka is something like -- like somebody you love, you call babushka, like this, you\nknow, they --",
        "A: -- add. So that was chlebushka for him, and we didn\u2019t have it. Imagine in such a situation,\npeople running, hungry, somebody steals from a child, that sack with the -- we call it suchary,\nsuchary, that dry bread. And we didn\u2019t have what to eat, and the train was going and going with\nno stop. We didn\u2019t know where we going.",
        "A: Mm-mm, we didn\u2019t know. And when it stopped, everybody run out, because people -- excuse,\nwere relieving themself on the hay there.",
        "A: On the straw. So when there\u2019s a train stop, we have to get -- jump down and go pee or do\nsome other things. And sometime the train all of a sudden start moving.",
        "A: So my mom threw me to one wagon, my brother too, and somebody grabbed her by the hand\nto pull her to another wagon.",
        "A: And the train goes and goes, how long we don\u2019t know, and we cry, Mama, Mama, we both\ncry. And finally, after a few hours it stops, so my mom came running to us, hugged us. We cried,\nbecause we were happy to see. So my mom say, never again we go, we always keep hands\ntogether. Whatever happen, happen. And the trains, at the station, they had hot water. They call it\nin Russian kipiatok, kipiatok it\u2019s like boiling water. And we get the hot water and whoever had a\npiece of bread put it in that water so we have something warm to -- to have for the stomach, you\nknow? So --",
        "A: No. But they gave us some, Russians.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: A piece of bread a day, or whatever, they gave us some, so we save for the next day. I always\nsaved bread. I cut like a small piece and put under the pillow, it was not a pillow like here, soft\nand comfortable. Something that you put under your head, and I always kept a piece of bread\nhidden. And when my brother cried for chlebushka, to get bread, I always got a piece and gave it\nto him, and he was satisfied and happy. We were very attached to one another. And then we\ncome, after months of traveling, we come to Tula. That\u2019s the city not far from Moscow, that city\nTula, and from Tula the organizat-zation, a Polish organization brought us together and they\ntransfer us to Shchyokino, where my father was, you know?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It was cold in the Russian Gora Shchyokino, the city of Shchyokino, and Tulskaya Obles,\nTula like -- like Washington [indecipherable] Maryland, yeah? That was the region.",
        "A: Tulskaya Obles, the -- the suburbs or whatever, of Tula. Tula was not far away, but it was a\nnice, big city, because later we went there. And my father lived in a place called in Russian\nobszy zycie, it\u2019s communal life, communal life like a community in barracks. Everybody had a\nbed like two, four or five people in one room, with a small petition like in the hospital, you\nknow, they have this curtain --",
        "A: -- on the bed, and -- and we didn\u2019t see our father for a long time, I didn\u2019t recognize him. He\ngot -- he was wounded in the -- in his leg, so he limped a little bit. But he got skinny and not the\nfather I remember. And we were also children that grew a little bit and got skinny, without hair.",
        "A: So we all cried. We cried. It was like kind of frightened of him, the way he looked. And he\ncried to find us and my mom. And life started. So, as a family, we got a little room, separate\nfrom the place where he stayed single. We got a little room, a long, little co -- like the same\nwidth, but longer, with one window, two beds with straw mattresses and a stove in the middle,\nlike they call it [speaks Russian here], the Russian stove that you burn on coal or wood, and no\ngas. And no running water, never in the house, not --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: We used to carry, my mom -- in the Russia, if you see Russian old movies, you have like a --\na wooden [indecipherable] like it\u2019s half round and it has two hooks, one hook for one pail, and\nthe other, and you carry it on your shoulder like this, with the -- I used to carry that.",
        "A: Mm-hm. But smaller buckets, you know?",
        "A: I used to sit down, kneel it -- kneel, and then pick it up with my shoulder, and stand up. And\nof course the water was -- because I was shaking, not steady on my legs, so this was spilling, you\nknow, spill. But I run, barefoot, and was summertime, and we didn\u2019t have clothes enough and\nmy mom, from whatever she could do over her clothes she sew for me like a sarafan, you know,\nlike with no sleeves underneath, you wear a blouse and whatever. And that\u2019s what -- and\nbarefoot all summer long we run barefoot, and I had a glass splinters in my legs, and wood in my\nlegs, and you ask he -- I looked like a tomboy. I was very active. My hair was shaven, still cor --\nshort, didn\u2019t have hair.",
        "A: Just a little bit in front, like here, and straight, with freckles. I still have freckles, I cover them\nwith --",
        "A: -- with make-up a little bit. With freckles, my brother also had freckles. I even have on my\nhands freckles. But -- and then we were happy to be together with my father.",
        "A: Oh, it took awhile, months.",
        "A: I -- yeah. And he --",
        "A: No, we were not frightened. It just -- he was not the same person like we remember, warm\nand loving. He was like keeping distance from the army, from being wounded, and he start\ndrinking, and the -- they taught him how to drink alcohol. He started to drink, so -- he worked\nvery hard, he worked with iron. They were melting iron in a big factory, and making like all kind\nof -- I don\u2019t know, ammunition or whatever, parts or whatever. He worked very hard, and they\nwere rationing us with bread. So while he was working very hard, a physical job, he got a ration\nof bread daily, a kilo bread. Kilo bread is like two -- two and something pounds. A kilo bread.\nMy mom had a half of it, half a kilo bread, and we got together, me and my brother, half a kilo.\nSo we had two kilo breads, which you will think it\u2019s a lot, yeah, it\u2019s like a loaf of bread for four\npeople. But except bread, we didn\u2019t have anything to eat. We didn\u2019t have butter, we didn\u2019t have\nmarmalade, we didn\u2019t have any butter or whatever. And my mom used to say, in Yiddish she\nsay, \u201cGod, when I am going to eat a piece of white bread with butter?\u201d I looked at her, \u201cMama,\nwhat is butter?\u201d [speaks foreign language here]. You know it? That\u2019s what she wanted. White\nbread --",
        "A: -- with butter. Then I went to school --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. At this place, we got sick with the eyes. My a -- my eyes and my brother\u2019s eyes,\nwhen it come evening, we didn\u2019t see anything. Why -- and his eyes got swollen with a lot of pus\ncoming out, like -- like this, like balloons. My -- we didn\u2019t see, we were walking like blind, like\nthis, you know?",
        "A: In the evening, yes.",
        "A: Stretching my brother behind me, holding me like this, and I was walking like --",
        "A: -- like a zombie. We didn\u2019t know. Later I find out. My mother took us to the doctors there, to\na clinic and they used to put very strong drops into our eyes. It was burning like hell. We cried\njust that when she touched us. They put drops and she washed our eyes with some lukewarm\nwater, with the nice cleaning, you know, ma -- fabric. So she wiped our eyes. During the day it\nwas fine, we could see. When evening came -- they call it in Russian -- I will say and then\ntranslate kurina slepota. Kurina means chicken blindness. That\u2019s how they call it. It was not a\nprofessional medical name.",
        "A: But that was the symptoms that a lot of people, usually children, had because we didn\u2019t have\nvitamins, we didn\u2019t have proper food and hygiene, nothing.",
        "A: So that\u2019s -- children were dying like flies there.",
        "A: Yeah. Not just from that.",
        "A: They had brain sickness. They were swollen.",
        "A: Brain.",
        "A: The brain -- was attacking the children\u2019s brain, they died like flies. We -- remember that\nevery other day we lived in a barrack, it was -- each one had their own, like 30 families and we\nknew one another. Every other day there was a -- a funeral for the children. And one family, two,\nthree kids died. They got swollen and this and brain damage or whatever, fever, and they died.\nAnd you know, out of this sadness, we run to the cemetery because there was a tradition that\nwhen they buried somebody, they gave you a little bit -- a small piece of bread with honey. And\nthis for us, it\u2019s irony, it\u2019s sad, was like a holiday to get a piece of bread with honey, we never\nsaw honey.",
        "A: And that was a tradition. And they were buried, a lot of friends I remember, 1n particular one\nlittle girl with blue eyes, her name was Nina. And then her brother, younger brother died, too.\nBut life must go on. We had -- I went to school -- I went to second grade, third grade. I learned\nvery fast Russian, to write in Russian and read. We didn\u2019t have books, or didn\u2019t have paper to\nwrite, like you have nice paper. My father cut up from the newspaper the white side, sewed it up\nwith the needle and thread and I used to write on this my homework and everything. I-It\u2019s not a\nfairy tale --",
        "A: -- it\u2019s the truth, I remember that. And --",
        "A: Yeah, this -- the white strips from the newspaper.",
        "A: Yeah, that I could write, you know? It was clean, narrow and long --",
        "A: -- so I could -- and we had not a pen that you have ink inside. We had a inker, a little thing\nand we put the pen into the ink --",
        "A: -- and write til it end. And we put spots on it, you know, they were spreading li --",
        "A: We call it clocks",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Okay. Oh my God.\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Very.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We were actually very scared.",
        "A: And especially my parents. You couldn\u2019t help it, what\u2019s -- was happening, it was like an\nepidemic.",
        "A: And young children were dying. Nobody could explain why and how it comes, they just got\nswollen, got high fever, like a brain fever or whatever, and then the next day or two they were\ngone. And was --",
        "A: It was fast, it was fast and there were too many children age six, seven, like that, died. And\nout of that tragedy that I understand today, we were happy to run to the cemetery to get this piece\nof bread with honey.",
        "A: Can you imagine --",
        "A: -- that survival --",
        "A: -- that survival does. We were crying. I remember that Ninotchka -- her name was Ninotchka\nwith blue eyes, blonde hair, Russian child, was beautiful, always playing, she was chubby. And I\nwas the skinny one and the mother sometime brought me a piece of potato, like baked in the\noven. They call it kartoshka in Russian. And they were very nice people, Russian people, the\npeasants or whatever. They were very hospitable.",
        "A: Very nice people. And we live like brothers and sisters, we played.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: A lot. And then her little brother died, too [indecipherable]. I remem --",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: But we didn\u2019t understand about dead too much, because they said -- they were very religious,\nthe people, the Russian and they said that they go to heaven. I ask my mom what is heaven\nbecause we were not religious at all. We knew Jewish, we knew we Jewish, and my mom say,\n\u201cIn heaven it\u2019s a place of like beautiful trees, beautiful green flowers and nice weather and all the\npeople are happy and playing together, children, so she went to heaven.\u201d So one day I cry, I say,\n\u2018T don\u2019t want to go to heaven.\u201d She say, \u201cWhy?\u201d I say, \u201cBecause she\u2019s not around here. I miss\nher and if I go to heaven I will not see you or my brother.\u201d I already started to think about things\nlike that. I say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to heaven, I want to be here with you.\u201d And my mom hugged\nme, she say, \u201cOkay Surele, you\u2019re not going to heaven. You\u2019re growing old here, and this is the\nhell.\u2019 So we live -- we are in hell now.",
        "A: No, after the eye sickness, we were eating better, because my mom worked and my father\nworked, and they had a lot of -- we didn\u2019t have enough bread probably, but there was on the\nmarket always, potatoes, or a carrot to buy and this, and she cooked soup, you know?",
        "A: She cooked a lot of soup with bread, if you can. And so we put a piece of bread like this, in\nthe spoon like that, it was dripping --",
        "A: -- so we don\u2019t lose the liquid, so it went on the bread, and then the bread was, you know, e-\neaten.",
        "A: It was very dear, like a commodity. If you give me today gold, I will not cherish that like that\npiece of bread and soup. Then my sister came. We did not know that Mom is pregnant and I did\nnot understand. I was already nine years old.",
        "A: It was \u00b045, ni -- April of \u201945, and my mom got sick. We thought that my mom is going to die,\nme and my brother, we cried. We didn\u2019t know, they didn\u2019t tell us what sh -- what is -- I saw my\nmom a little bit rounded like she is gaining weight. Looks good, and she worked, and that was\nall, you know? In the meantime, in the summer, I was running with the girls, dancing, they had\nmusic or they play and dance, you know the Russian folks dances, they -- they sing chastushk1,\nchastushki means like the -- the couplets, like the words that -- the folk songs about girls and\nboys loving one another and this and singing. I remember the songs.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: [sings 1n Russian]",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s what -- like pay attention to that song, put your ears on top of your head so you\nhear better, because they going to sing that folk song chastushki -- there is no explanation what\nchastushki is, so it will be -- you will be very happy about that. And then you make ee-ee noises\nand dance and you\u2019re like this, like that, you know, the Russian folks dancer, have you seen\nsometime Russian folk dancers --",
        "A: -- or th-they\u2019re -- they\u2019re very like country songs.",
        "A: Right, like square dancers? That\u2019s -- that\u2019s what, very nice, and I was an expert in that with\nthe girls. Always Szurka, Szurka, they call me Szurka, [indecipherable] go dance. I say no, I was\nshy in the beginning. But then I -- I dance and sang. Barefoot, of course.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have shoes. So, it was very happy, and there were bigger girls, and in summertime\nthey had woods, beautiful woods -- forest. They used to go summertime to the forest, the girls,\nlike they were maybe 12 - 14 or older. Nice Russian girls, only girls, going to the woods to pick\nberries, they had white berries, wild. Wild nuts growing, with the green things. And sometimes\nwe had, like in the spring, on the fields, some potatoes leftover from the previous years, so they\nwere frozen from the winter, we picked. So I told my mom, make a sack. From a sack, make like\na -- a -- like a rucksack, to have strings here --",
        "A: -- so put it together, string it, and I have it on my bag, whatever I pick. And then she gave me\na big container with the close-up, you know, and a mu -- a long one, like a pail, and\n[indecipherable] in the summer, four -- four o\u2019clock in the summer, the girls didn\u2019t want to take\nme with them. They were older and they were afraid that I will start crying, I will be tired, so\nthey always when they saw me, Szurka, go home. You not coming with us to the woods. We\u2019re\nnot going to take, there is a bridge to cross, there is water, you can fall in. We don\u2019t want you.\nBut I will pick for you. I will help you pick berries, everything. Please take me. I will not cry.\nNo, you go home. So what I do? I told my mom, I was crying, I say \u201cThey don\u2019t want to take\nme.\u201d And she say, \u201cThey\u2019re right. You a little girl and you don\u2019t go there, we don\u2019t need that.\u201d I\nsay, \u201cMom, I am going.\u201d So what I did, I woke up earlier, like two o\u2019clock in the morning. I\ndidn\u2019t sleep probably a whole night, and it was like grayish outside, in the summer, 1-it\u2019s like\nApril, May, something, I was going. I went by myself.",
        "A: Through the woods. I knew the way and I was far away ahead of them, and when they saw\nme, they chased me with -- with rocks. I said, do whatever, I am on my own, not going with you.\nI am going by myself. This is my woods too. You know, I was then not letting do anything to\nme. So I picked -- first what I did, I ate the berries, whatever they grow. The toot -- the\nblueberries, and all kind of berries, the raspberries, everything. First what I did, I ate. I stuffed\nmy face with it, I was all red around, I didn\u2019t care, it was good. Then I picked the -- from the\ntrees the nuts with the green covers.",
        "A: Put in the sack, and put mushrooms. I pick mushroom. I knew each mushroom by name and\nwhich mushroom is poisonous. I learned from them. So I put the mushrooms in this. And there\nwas also wild, like -- it was like -- no, green -- no, how you call it, the green chives?",
        "A: The green chives?",
        "A: But that was wild. But it looks the same. I pulled it out with the roots.",
        "A: It has a little head, white head, I put it in the sack. Everything, I brought home, whatever the -\n- and the mushrooms and everything. I even learned to eat raw mushrooms then. I ate. I picked\nup everything, I helped them to pick, there -- there was a river, they went swimming in the river,\nwashing up, washing the mushrooms, everything. And we had a picnic. We were singing and\ndancing together. I never was behind them, I never let them be, you know, letting me down. And\n[ -- | -- that was good memories for me.",
        "A: Later they accepted me, yes.",
        "A: They accepted, they were waiting for me, I was waiting before them. They accepted me. And\nthen they didn\u2019t know about who we are, Jewish, they call us we are Polacks. We are Polish\nrefugee. There was no anti-Semitism there then. They didn\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s because of a\nsmall place, they didn\u2019t know that we are Jews or that -- they call me Szurka, that\u2019s -- that was a\nRussian name. Surele my mom called me, and Szurka in Russian. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a short name\nfrom Alexandra in Russian.",
        "A: Alexandra means they called Szura as a nickname, you know? So I was Szurka. And when I\ncame home, my mom saw all this [indecipherable] so she say in Yiddish -- my mom was very\nfrighten about poisonous things, so she say, [speaks Yiddish here]. \u201cWhat happened? Like a\ndisease, she\u2019s going to poison us all with all this stuff she brought. You know, who 1s going to\ndo? I said, \u201cI know how to do.\u201d I cleaned it, the mushrooms. We cut the mushrooms. If we had\nthe -- the sibilus, the yel -- the green thing.",
        "A: Chives, we call it sibilus in Yiddish, cebula in Polish. And wi -- my mom washed it, she\nchopped it and put water and put the mushrooms. We didn\u2019t have any grease or butter, whatever.\nIt was a good soup with bread, and we all ate. And that was summer, we were not hungry, and\nhappy. And I had a good time with them, they -- they learned to respect me, to dance and sing gu\n-- together. And they were going out with boys of course, they were older than me and then was\none man -- wa -- young boy, Pyeta was his name, he liked me to be his girlfriend. I didn't\nunderstand that.",
        "A: Yes, I said -- they started young then.",
        "A: Some of them even were pregnant, the girls, they didn\u2019t care if there was a husband, and --",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah. They have kids. And a lot of tragedies --",
        "A: -- you know, but that was life.",
        "A: No, barefoot, barefoot. All summer barefoot.",
        "A: In the winter I was wearing my mom\u2019s shoes. I\u2019Il tell you what happened in April when my\nsister was supposed to get born. My mom was pregnant and my father used to work night shifts.\nIt was like 24 hours, from time when he went to work, it was like 24 hours, then he came home.\nHe was earning good money, and bread, you know. There was rations, bread. So one night in the\nmorning, it was like two o\u2019clock in the morning, my s -- mother started to -- I don\u2019t know how\nyou say in English, is [Yiddish word] like in Yiddish, oy, oy, she was moaning. I said, \u201cMama,\nwhat happen?\u201d I slept with -- there was one bed here, was single bed, my mom slept with my\nfather here. There was a little table in the middle, a window, and me and my brother in one bed\non straw, no mattress, nothing. And we cover with a cover, with a ma -- coat, or whatever. And\nmy mom start to moan and she woke me up, Surele, Surele. When there was something wrong,\nshe spoke to me in Yiddish, not in Russian, you know? So I woke up, I say, \u201cMama, what\nhappen?\u201d I cried. She said, oy, like this. She say, \u201cGo and bring that babushka.\u201d There was an\nold lady. It was like from our place to go through a railroad that was a slope going up -- up, and\nthere was a railroad and then you go down to the village, and I knew where she lived, the\nbabushka. So, it was almost three in the morning, I run, and it was April. It was raining before, it\nwas mud all over because the roads were not paved, there were no roads in the village. And I put\nmy mother\u2019s shoes, of course, her size was, I think, 39 then, and I was little. I put my mother\u2019s\nshoes, and I\u2019m running. I put something on myself, I don\u2019t remember what I put, something, and\nI running and crying, running and crying. And that -- my mother should not die, my mother\nshould not die, my mother is sick. I go fast to -- to get babushka, she will help her. So, the\nbabushka lived in a small hut also, nobody had a hou -- tall houses, nobody. It was a barrack, one\nroom and that\u2019s it. No luxuries. So I knocked in the window, in the babushka\u2019s window. M -- she\nwas prepared. She told my mother, if something happened to you, send Szuritska -- send Szura to\ncall me, and I will come. So, I knocked in the window a few times, nobody answer, and I start\nscreaming, \u201cBabushka, Babushka, come, my mom is dying.\u201d In Russian [speaks Russian]. I -- I\nthought my mom is dying. So she say, Szurka, like this, she was an old woman -- I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe she was not old then. She was wearing that scarf on the head. A short woman, blue eyes, I\nremember her. We call her babushka, we didn\u2019t know the name. And the babushka came out, she\nsaid to me, \u201cRelax, what happened?\u201d I say, \u201cMama is dying, Mama is in pain, Mama is dying.\nShe send me to you to come.\u201d Okay. So we\u2019re running, running, and there is water, dark, and my\nmother\u2019s shoes were stuck in the mud, and I left it there. I didn\u2019t have time to go back to ge-get\nit, so I took the other shoe off, I\u2019m barefoot, I run, and I remember where that shoe is, you know?\nSo, my mom\u2019s shoes, and she came to the room, she saw my mother, she took me and my\nbrother out, pushed us out of the door. And she said, \u201cStay here, don\u2019t come in.\u201d We don\u2019t know\nwhat happened to Mom, we crying. My brother even more than me, he was crying. He say,\n\u201cWhat happened to mom, she is going to die.\u201d I said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Mordechai. Stay put quiet, be\nquiet. We won\u2019t -- we don\u2019t know, maybe she will not die. The babushka will help.\u201d We -- I\ndon\u2019t know how long we stayed, a few hours.",
        "A: And out --",
        "A: -- yeah, yeah. I was 10.",
        "A: Yeah. It\u2019s was April fifth, 1945, that\u2019s when my sister was born, Rosa. Now her name is in\nHebrew Shoshana. Means rose. All of a sudden the door is open, you can come in, you have a\nsistreechka, a sister, in Russian.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking at all. My brother\u2019s holding\nme like this. He always was, you know, attached to me. And we see the baby. My mom, I never\nforget that picture, and I couldn\u2019t understand what it is then, but now I know, gave birth on\nstraw, no mattress, covered -- when we saw her she was all bloody, she didn\u2019t have time to wash,\nshe wanted us to -- in. And there\u2019s a little bundle laying, covered with my brother\u2019s coat, a gray\ncoat. Covered, we only see the face. Is meowing like a kitten. Meow-ow. Sh-she was born very\nlittle, very weak. My mom didn\u2019t have what to eat. So she said, the babushka, \u201cThis is your little\nsister.\u201d Now we -- we were happy that Mom didn\u2019t die, but there was a sister, we didn\u2019t know\nhow it comes, why? So, we went in -- I went with babushka back, I got that shoe, I didn\u2019t forget -\n- forget my shoe --",
        "A: -- that was Mom\u2019s shoe, with -- with mud, everything, I brought it back, I was barefoot. I\nbrought that shoe. My father came in the morning from work, and of course he was happy, a\nbubeleh, a bubeleh, he call her bubeleh like a little doll, in Yiddish, bubeleh. And what we have\nto do, my Mom said to me, Sarah -- \u201cSurele, go and register your sister to the registry,\u201d there was\nan office.",
        "A: It was like maybe one kilometer, I don\u2019t know how in miles how much is a kilometer. Two,\nthree -- two miles, I think.",
        "A: Yeah, a mile and a half, yeah. I am 10 years old, a lot of women standing on a line, I am\nstanding a line. When my line came, my time came, I hold a piece of paper the babushka gave\nme that a female this was born, named Rosa Szlinger [indecipherable] she -- she was registered\nlady that she brought children to the world, she knew what to write. And I cannot get through,\nthat window was higher than me, and I -- he sees that piece of paper only, on the desk",
        "A: Not the person, he sees a piece of hand and that piece of paper. And I said -- my voice, that\u2019s\nwhat he told me later, h-he went out to look, who\u2019s that. And I said, \u201cThis is my sister,\u201d in\nRussian, \u201cRosa, who was born, and you write down -- and give me a piece of paper that she was\nborn this day, my mother told me.\u201d He looked at me, everybody was laughing that I, a little child\n10 years old, go register my sister.",
        "A: You know? She still has that paper --",
        "A: -- later was translated, yes. A female girl named Rosa Szlinger was born at this date, April for\n-- in town of Shchyokino Tulaskaya Obles. That\u2019s the certificate of birth. When sometime my\nsister said something, I say, if not me, you wouldn\u2019t be born.",
        "A: Not registered.",
        "A: We did hear about the war.",
        "A: There was a radio for everybody in the barrack, like a plate, a radio.",
        "A: And a loudspeaker that we heard that our armies did this, they -- they killed German, they\noccupied this city, in Russian. When there was, in the middle of the night, if there was special\nannouncement, good things, in middle of the night everybody came out in the barrack of the\nrooms to hear what the speaker is say. I never forget that night that was -- I\u2019m getting chills. Ni --\nMay fifth, 1945, and the speaker is dead already, his name is Leviyatan, he was a Jewish speaker.\nBut he announced during the war and after, all the news, what\u2019s happening on the front. So he --\nall of a sudden is quiet in the morning, like four o\u2019clock in the morning, and we hear doooo, like\nsomething moving, like -- like a wa -- noise. And then, three times, Gavorit Moskva. Rut -- rush\n-- Moskva is speaking. Gavorit Moskva, three times. And Sivodnya -- I remember like today, in\nRussian. Today our Red Army beat the Germans and they capitulated and it\u2019s our victory.\n[speaks Russian here]. Today is our victory. You have no idea -- I ha -- can cry now. Everybody\njumped out of the rooms and there was such a holiday. Music was playing, people hugging one\nanother, people dancing in the street, there was nobody discriminated, like one family happy that\nthe war ended, because everybody suffered. The Russian people, the Jewish people, everybody\nsuffered. And that was a great day, and the music, the loudspeaker and everybody dancing in the\nstreet and hugging. And I remember this day we got white bread. That was my mother dream\n[speaks Yiddish here], and that was the piece of white bread, everybody got white bread.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: There was none.",
        "A: Butter came later.",
        "A: Butter came later, and --",
        "A: Because there was a shortage of everything.",
        "A: They -- th-they didn\u2019t have wheat, everything went to the front, everything went to the\nhospitals, and we people, si -- not sick, we had this muddy bread, like -- like -- I call 1t glue, you\ncould glue it to the wall, you know. It was hard, and it was some kind of, I don\u2019t know what,\nstraw in it, or whatever. But it was bread.",
        "A: And I was very happy that the war ended, and then Wanda Waszylewska, the same writer,\nPolish, organized that people, Polish people, even though my father and mother signed to\nbecome citizen of Russia, they registered to go back to Poland.",
        "A: Okay. So short.\nEnd of Tape Five\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "A: Where we -- where were we?",
        "A: Yeah, yes.",
        "A: Yeah, yes. People actually came before the war ended, wounded men without legs, invalids,\nwithout an arm, without an eye. So people ask, what happened to you? And since it was an open\ncommunity that we lived, and I was going to school, and there were also Russian propaganda,\nand they were telling about concentration camps, I knew about Auschwitz, Dachau --",
        "A: -- Treblinka, yeah. But I did not understand exactly, as a child, what it is the atrocity.",
        "A: I knew.",
        "A: And when we came back to Poland after that, and we came in July of \u201945, we came to Poland,\nit took a few months after the war, not too long, because of the organization and w-we came to\nthe city, not to Warsaw where my -- my father and mom was born, we came to Wroclaw, it was\nbefore Germany --",
        "A: Breslau.",
        "A: Th-They call it [speaks foreign language here] taking over land. It used to belong to Silesia.\nIn Silesia they call it Shlonsk in Poland. There\u2019s upper Silesia and middle Silesia in German,\nthere\u2019s a higher and lower Silesia. It still now belonged to Poland. That\u2019s why we came. We\ncame to Wroclaw, a torn down, burned down city, huge city in ruins. We came because my\nfather\u2019s brother Yukel with his family was there. They met us, Luba, my cousin, his daughter,\nYukel\u2019s daughter, and the boy, Mordechai met us. So my father ask, where is my brother, Yukel?\nSo she burst into tears and she said that he is no more. He died a month ago. He had tuberculosis,\nhe was very sick and his wife Gitl died in Russia before that. So he came to Poland with the two\nchildren. Luba was a lot older than me, 10 years older, and Mordechai, my cousin is two years\nolder than me. So we came and the two, girl and boy had an apartment where they live and --\nwith the father. We came to their apartment, the four of us, how many -- five of us.",
        "A: Yeah, my sister was there, the baby, a few months old. She was born in April, that was July\nsomething, so she was a few months old, and we came to live with them. We didn\u2019t have\nanything, no clothes, no nothing, no shoes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: My father didn\u2019t want to stay one single day longer and my mom. They wanted to come home\nand seek if somebody is still alive, because we corresponded with them. They got letters in\nRussia from Warsaw up to 1943. They were writing -- that\u2019s what my mom told me in Yiddish,\nthat they have to leave their apartments, and they going to give them another apartments, all Jews\ntogether, it\u2019s -- it was a ghetto creating in Warsaw, but they didn't know any better what will\nhappen to them. So don\u2019t worry about us, the apartment that you left with the things is intact. We\nclosed the doors and everything 1s being checked, and nobody touched anything. That was so\nimportant to them, the apartment with the furniture.",
        "A: To us it was not relevant then. What we went through, running away and leaving things --\nwhile running you leave the heavy stuff because you cannot carry it. So -- and that was the end\nand we did not see one of them, nobody was alive. They all perished in the Warsaw ghetto.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No. First we came from Russia to Wroclaw to live with his brother, and we didn\u2019t find my --\nmy uncle alive, so we took another apartment next door, to live separate, and my cousin Luba,\nhis -- Yukel\u2019s daughter --",
        "A: -- was older, she was 18 or something, she was working. A beautiful girl. And Mordechai, my\ncousin, was 14, and then they were creating kibbutz\u2019s -- kibbutz for young Jewish people to\nemigrate to Israel. Since he didn\u2019t have a father and mother, at age of 14, when we came we met\nMordechai, my cousin, very lovely, he was in a kibbutz already, Shomer Hatzair, they called the\nkibbutz, and he was on his way to emigrate to Israel. The sister, Luba was older, she didn\u2019t want\nhim to go, but he didn\u2019t want to stay in Poland and he emigrated to Israel, is still til today, he\nlives all his life in a kibbutz. He married there, he has a daughter, and he lives now in Golan\nHeights, Kibbutz Dafna.",
        "A: In \u00b0*48.",
        "A: After.",
        "A: Almost.",
        "A: Yeah. In four -- they were [indecipherable] they were -- they very politically inclined, th-they\nwere maybe brainwashed to go, young children --",
        "A: -- didn\u2019t know any better what Israel 1s.",
        "A: But they were fighting, and I know a lot of boys that volunteered to go to Israel to fight, and\nthey nev -- I\u2019ve never met them again. They di -- they were not alive.",
        "A: They all perished there. But they were heroes. They fought for the Eretz -- Eretz Israel, for\ntheir country. They were very patriotic, young people. We settled in -- in Wroclaw. I went to a\nPolish school nearby because I didn\u2019t know to write and to read in Polish, only in Russian.",
        "A: Three. Third.",
        "A: Mm-hm, third grade.",
        "A: 10 --",
        "A: -- 11, yeah.",
        "A: Thir -- I went to Polish school, I didn\u2019t know Polish, only Russian and Yiddish. And that was\nnearby, like second street from our house, and my mom sent us to school because it was close,\nand that she didn\u2019t have to take us far away because she was working and my father. So we live\nin one room apartment with a kitchen, but there was running water in the house, and electricity.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, after the war, it was -- Wroclaw was a very beautiful German city. After the war was\ntaking over, and I saw German people being thrown out from the apartments, took whatever they\ncould with them. It was a long, long walk. And I stood with tears in my eyes, although Germans\ndid a lot of atrocity to us, but they were children and old people, mostly, because young Germans\nwere killed in the front or whatever. They were orphans with grandparents, walking and pushing\nthe pushcarts in a long line. As a child that went through a lot, I felt very sorry. Some Polacks\nthrew rocks at them. Farflucta ju -- Deutsche, they called them dirty Deutsch like they called\nfarflucta Juden to us, the Germans.",
        "A: And at school, in the Polish school, I felt terrible. First of all the Polacks are all blonde\nmostly, blue eyes. I had dark hair. They pulled my hair all the time. Oh, look at that Jewess.\n[speaks Polish here]. You know in Polish [Polish] in a nice way, that Jewess has dark hair.\nWhere did you come from? You killed our Jesus. I didn\u2019t know what Jesus is, what religion,\nnothing then. In Russia there was no religion, nobody talked about anything. I came home\ncrying, dirty Jew, dirty Jew [Polish] like in Polish the parshiva like somebody has a disease, you\nknow, uncurable disease. I never seen such hatreds during the war with the Russian like I\nencountered in Poland. They were so against everything and everybody, especially Jews. Jews\nkilled Jesus, Jews are bad, we have to kill the Jews. I said to my mom, I\u2019m not going to that\nschool. My mom said, where would you go? It\u2019s far away, this is close. I said, I\u2019m not going to\nthat school, they call me names and I don\u2019t know even why. One day she went there and there\nwas a priest, a young priest and she spoke to that priest. He was teaching religion. I approached\nthat priest, I said in Polish -- I learned fast, I said [speaks Polish] you -- like your highness,\npriests, 1n Polish there\u2019s an expression, \u201cCan I stay on the lesson when you teaching religion?\u201d\nHe say, \u201cWhy? You not Catholic.\u201d I says, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference? I want to know why they call\nme dirty Jew, can you explain that to me? Am I dirty? I have dark hair, but I went through the\nwar, and I am surviving, and now I came to free Poland, and I am a dirty Jew.\u201d He said, \u201cWell,\nPll give you a book about the New Testament, and if you don\u2019t understand something, you ask.\u201d\nI read that New Testament, about how the world was created, and about Jesus, where he was\nborn and the Holy Mary. I see they are Jewish too, you know, they came from Israel, from\nNazareth, from the -- Jesus Christ came from the dynasty of David the King. King David. I\nstarted to analyze, I said, \u201cWhy am I a dirty Jew? You also Jewish.\u201d I asked the priest -- I started\nto -- to be more political. You also Jewish, because Jesus Christ and Holy Mary was Jewish. And\nI read the New Testament, but I don\u2019t know the Old Testament. I don\u2019t know anything about\nreligion because in my house they told us we are Jewish and that was it. We didn\u2019t go to\nsynagogue, my parents didn\u2019t go nowhere. There was later, a Jewish synagogue, beautiful, built\n800 years ago by German Jews in that city, and Hitler used to come to Wroclaw and had\nspeeches in a big hall, which 1s still there. It\u2019s a beautiful city. I started bec -- I became very\nconscious of ma -- about my past, and who am I. I ask question, Mama -- in Polish then -- who\nare we? We Jewish, you say. Why don\u2019t we go to pray? Why the Polacks have churches, and\nthey call us dirty Jew, why? Always why. M-My mom said, \u201cI cannot answer you all this. They\ndon\u2019t like us and that\u2019s all, because they claim we killed Jesus Christ.\u201d I say, \u201cBut that\u2019s not true.\nHe was Jewish.\u201d And then there were the Romans. You know, I know very well the history, and\nI just pushed them like this. Nobody can win with me. I said, \u201cI am who I am and you are who\nyou are.\u201d You have to be human. And I found out that there is opening a Jewish school, but it\u2019s\nvery far away from us, where we live. And I said to Mom, \u201cMama, I\u2019m going to Jewish school.\u201d\nShe started [speaks foreign language here] \u201cWhere are you running?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to a\nJewish school.\u201d And while we going to a Jewish school, they will not call us dirty Jew, and no\nanti-Semites, and I don\u2019t want to see them. And beside, they going to feed us there. Food is very\nimportant. They going to give us lunch at school. What I did, like I am a organizer that they call\nme always, commander, my friends, I\u2019m a very organizer, so I said to my friends at the street,\nJewish chi-children, \u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s go register.\u201d That was summertime. We go to\nregister to a Jewish school, and it\u2019s very far away, we have to take two tramways, there was\nelectric s --",
        "A: -- streetcars, and then the communication of buses. It took like an hour to get each way. I got\nall my friends, my Jewish friends from this street, from the other street, we went in the summer,\nwe registered. And now is a problem. The school starts. All of the children speak Russian, they\ncame from Russia, different ages, nobody knows to write or read Polish or Russian, and we s --\nall speak rush -- Polish or Yiddish, and we speak Russian. It\u2019s like [indecipherable]. So, the\nteachers were some of them older, some of them -- and they had a dilemma with different ages,\nhow to place the children in classes, according to their brain and intelligence, everything. They\nput older children, like 10 - 11, because we\u2019re -- I was in the first grade. I was a big girl, and they\nwere little kids. I was embarrassed. I was taller than them. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to that class.\u201d\nSo what they did, very good thing, they gather all the older children that they don\u2019t belong to the\nfirst grade, 10 - 11 - 12 even, and we got into one class, it was intensive study, because we had\nbackground in Russian, we already knew how to read.",
        "A: To study Yiddish and Polish. And it to -- they call it a chong. Chong means to pull, you know,\npull everybody out.",
        "A: And they call it the chong, and we studied for a year, very intensely. I knew mathematic\nbetter than everybody because I was there in third grade, in Russia.",
        "A: And I knew how to multiply and this, they didn't know how to put one and one together. So, I\nwas good, and then we studied Polish and Yiddish to write alphabet and everything for a whole\nyear. And then, according to ages, they placed us in different classes. I went to the fourth grade,\nso I didn\u2019t lose too much.",
        "A: So I studied history, Jewish history, I still have -- it was then in Polish history [Polish] I have\nthat book, the history of Jews.",
        "A: Yes. I have that book. I brought it with me always. And -- and we were very happy there.\nFirst of all, they gave us lunch in the Jewish school. We studied Russian, Polish, Yiddish,\nhistory, geography, whatever other gr -- in the same grade. Mathematics, and I knew\nmathematics good because from Russia. And we were very happy.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: Mordechai was like glued to my hip.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: He was not.",
        "A: But he went -- he was, accordingly to his age --",
        "A: -- he learned Yiddish and Polish [indecipherable]",
        "A: By tram.",
        "A: Two tramways we took, and you know, switched? It took like an hour and a half to get each\nway, but we didn\u2019t mind. We walked home, back, if we wanted to save money to see a movie.",
        "A: Mama couldn\u2019t give us money to go see a movie. It was not that expensive, but for them it\nwas, SO we always sneaked in without money.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Opera.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: For nothing.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I just looked at them, all the cashiers or whatever, people were standing in the\ndoor, and I was looking at them like with some expression like for longing.",
        "A: So they knew me, I was coming all the time.",
        "A: And the guy saw me th -- th -- when they started, he just made with the hand, a gesture with\nthe hand like come in. And I was happy.",
        "A: And my mom used to say, you bring a bed and stay there --",

That\u2019s how they were.\nIn Israel, he was not too much drinking, because it was hot, the climate was hot. He worked with\na horse and buggy.

And they\nare na -- my neighbors, I know them for a long time, belonged to the same synagogue, but he\nnever paid attention to me, he never knew me. And we went at the Jewish organization in New\nYork, it\u2019s called Hidden Children. There was a Hanukkah party in December three years ago.\nAnd some friend brought him over to our table.
