One morning, we heard all\nkinds of gunfire, bombs and guns and maybe by the next\nday, the Germans occupied Lithuania. It was not--there\nwas very little resistance from the Lithuanians against\nthe Germans: 'A' because the Russians were too strong,\n'B' because the Lithuanians were very much pro-German\nand they welcome it.\nSB: Um, what other changes?
