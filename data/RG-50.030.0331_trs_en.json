        "Q: Before we get into some of the specific battles, I wanted to ask you a few general questions\nabout when you were with the partisans. It seemed like there were a lot of different groups.\nHow coordinated were you all?",
        "A: Talking about 1943, at that particular time, there was a total coordination.",
        "Q: You mean, when the Soviets came in?",
        "A: I mean, when we had contact with Moscow.",
        "Q: Prior to that?",
        "A: But prior to that, there were a lot of groups on their own. Be that they were fighting for the\nsame cause, when I mean the same cause, I mean that there were Soviet partisans. Or at the\nsame time, there were other type of partisans which I had before mentioned. We used to call\nthem \"the white.\" When we talk about Soviets, we always talk about red, so, therefore, the\nwhite Poles, for instance, those were Polish partisans who were against the Soviets, while\nthey also were against the Nazis. And to top it all off, they also were against the Jews.",
        "Q: This is the AK?",
        "A: That was the AK, which is called Army Krajowa. In other words, the land army or\nnationalist army, which they were. And they really had, to the best of my knowledge, they\nwere very much supported from London, England. That they were, because Chechovky (ph)\nwas one of them, which it was the former marshal sort of in Poland. And there were people\nwho were -- the Polish, who were saved from the outbreak of war who retreated to England.\nAnd from there they sort of carried on a certain amount of work.",
        "Q: You had contact with them?",
        "A: Well, we had contact with them, be that we, that we got some of their guys sort of by way of\nsurrounding them and knowing what was going on. It was our job to know who the enemy\nwas. And really who the enemy was, besides the Germans, was a big story to tell about it,\nbecause they had implants in all of these here ways in order for them to know what's going\non. And every once in a while, as I aforementioned in my other chapters, was that we located\nsome prisoners. We found prisoners who sort of came -- we knew there were many POWs\nwho joined the ranks of the partisans that were specific spies, German spies, implants. And\nwe learned how to discover the way they were signified by the Nazis. They would have a\ntatoo maybe underneath the arm just like the Gestapo would have. And some of them, which\nfor hiding purposes, when we started to undress them, we found maps that they were\ncarrying with them. And we knew that a guy who escapes a Prisoner of War Camp is not\nequipped with a map, and he's not equipped with a compass or anything like that because\nthat would have been foolish to think. So that suspicion -- and believe me, we made them\ntalk. The command made them talk, and this is how we knew of the various groups. Before\ngoing too long, I would like to mention at this point here that my wife lost a brother to one of\nthese here AK types you already identified them by their name, or I call them the National\nPolish Partisan Group. But he and another young kid -- they both were of the age of 14, 15,\nand their best job to be invisible at their work is because they were kids. And their job used\nto be more to go, as we call them, to the trains. They would look through main rails, and\nthose kids, they were not so visible -- and plant a mine over there and then go off. And then\nthere would be other explosions. They were caught by this, which it was on the other side of\nNiemen, as we called it. The other side of the river. And they were caught up, and needless\nto say, that they were immediately recognized to be Jews. And for that reason alone, they\nwere killed and shot. Nothing else, you know. So first their being kids. Second, they were\npartisans, maybe the priority would have been Jews -- that they were Jewish, and that's what\nit was. So evidence like this, it was known to us. As I will enter a little bit later, telling you\non one time that we were purposely sent like masqueraded in disguise of the Polish partisans\nbecause our command definitely wanted to implant partisans on the other side of the Niemen\nnear Grodno and we were on a search missions, which I will tell it when I come to this part\nof talking about , yes.",
        "Q: What I'm trying to understand is that -- there were different groups that were Soviet\npartisans. Before everything was coordinated through Moscow, was there any order to this?\nWas there any coordination?",
        "A: It was coordination that a command would meet sometimes together and talk about certain\nwork and plans, if it was planned a coordinated attack. So this guy would be on flanked, and\nthis partisan would use so many men, the other one. So to say that there was coordination,\nyes. But it wasn't the kind of coordination by command and so on. In other words, a staff was\norganized in 1943 before we made full contact with the paratroopers that were sent to us.\nBecause at the same time, which I must tell you, in that same year a little bit later, drops\nfrom planes through the night became visible even in our area, while before it used to be just\nin the big forest. But they would drop to us supplies, and with these supplies came messages,\nand so on in the same way. The supplies were weapons mostly. Not so much that it was of\nfoodstuff or anything like that, but that was -- and later on in '43, we had radio operators with\nus who were in constant contact with Moscow, as well as the other outposts of staff.",
        "Q: While we're on this, well, you might as well tell me how things changed in '43, because this\nseems to be where we're headed.",
        "A: Well, I touched base in earlier part, but here specifically, for instance, when we're talking\nabout the attack, where we attacked the garrison in Ruda Slaska. This was already an\norganized from all, because the participation was flanked by all the partisans in maybe\nlocated in 30-mile distance -- 30 mile, I mean square mile -- throughout all the forest. But\nvarious groups were brought in, be that they were ambushed, be they were in the fighting,\nand it was a real preplanned because for the first time, we were shown off at that time a\nPanzer truck and we were shown up at that particular time -- that Panzer truck drove in in the\nvicinity nearby. Not exactly. And the first shot was fired from a cannon, which it was\nsomething again hard to believe that we mustered that, but it was done because we heard\noriginally before attack that they built up bunkers. Now, to specify who they are, which is\nfound on the map, that would have been on the main road. The main road we're talking about\nwas a dirt road going through the forest. It was not a real road to the extent of the woods\nroad, what we mean. And it was leading between the between towards Gotha,\nOsweja, and from there you used to go to Lida. So, in other words, it was all dividing the\nforest with that road. And there settlements away from the road, not too far, where farmers\nused to have their farms. And mostly the soil over there was not too good for other than to\ngrow potatoes on. So these farmers, their livelihood came in normal times that they used to\nwork in the forest, be lumberjacks, or so on. In Ruda Slaska, there was also plains where\nthey used to make turpentine and tar, which it was again a derivative from this here pine\ntrees that were growing over there. So that was implied a good way for us to make that we\ncould sort of the forest -- we were all limited for miles and miles away, without roads. That\nwas the main important issue to talk about. There was only one leading road, and that road\nwas in Ruda Slaska. And, as I said preceding this here chapter, while I was speaking of the\nattack that we had on the Russian and that there came back reinstalled a new now garrison in\nthe Russian. At the same time, while we retreated, as I aforementioned, they put up that\ngarrison in Ruda Slaska. Ruda Slaska garrison, while it was serving the area, was basic a\nservice area for the Germans to control the forest. And, therefore, they chose over that to be\nUkrainians, which they were former -- they were with General Lassov (ph), an army who\nturned around, and instead of fighting the Germans, joined the Germans. And the Germans\nmade their darned best to utilize to their advantage General Lassov's (ph) army, so that\ngarrison, while it had I am sure some Germans 1n it too, was basically Ukrainians. Where,\nagain, the Ukrainian language versus the Soviet language 1s sort of similar to each other, so it\nwas -- and we had in our midst a lot of Ukrainians, who were former Soviet fighters, rather\nsoldiers who did not want to retreat or become POWs and remained in the forest. Because, as\nI said, that was a party out of the partisans. So, therefore, it was for the Germans a new kind\nof thing to bring in an enemy who it was harder for us to control, because they knew they\nwere permitted Ukrainian. They didn't necessarily have to speak German while they learned\nalready to speak German. So that became the biggest, sort of in a way, a trap to our existence\nbecause it was too close for comfort. They could, for instance, if they wanted to make an\nattack of artillery on the forest they could have at any given time, you know, attack with\ncertain shells. And you don't know which way or where, but it would have definitely made a\nbig problem to the farmers and to us. So that's when the command decided not to wait what\nis going to be later, but they by all costs, which I mean cost of lives, that we must attack and\nwe must destroy that garrison. First of all, that no other garrison should be planted around,\nsort of in that -- and we organized. Again, it was already the staff, the General's staff, which\nwas controlling and they brought in forces from all kinds and the innovation, like I said, from\nthe artillery. And the Panzer trucks, sort of as to call it, was issued there. It was a hard battle\nfor us for the first time to ensue because supplies of ammunition were hard for us. It was\neither to buy food or to buy horse, that they could supply to us. And no matter how much\nammunition we all carried with us, we never carried enough ammunition to ensue a battle\nthree or four hours. And that's what the battle was, and we succeeded -- only because of that\nartillery fight, we succeeded to drive them out. Meaning, they retreated, so they came back at\na time later and restarted again. But our satisfaction was that we showed the enemy, well,\nyou have no safety ground over here. And from there on, the miserable life ensued until\nliberation. It was the last year, sort of, for us of the war, and we were talking about the year\nright now, let's say, between August of 1943 to about August 1944. But those forests a year\nlater became liberated by the Red Army. So that was the hardest year to survive as a fighting\nor partisans at all in the forest.",
        "Q: But that, too, the fact that at this time everything was coordinating through Moscow. You\nwere able to get more and better supplies, and that there was really system, I guess.",
        "A: Yes. And a command.",
        "Q: Yeah. How did that change the way you operated?",
        "A: Okay. Before a command of a group, as I said, firstly the names have changed. It was no\nlonger Zychov's (ph) group or Bullock's (ph) group or Fredia Kommunarsk's group. All of\nsudden, there was names, for instance, at that particular time. We started to hear organizing\nof the kids. We started to hear Russian names of heroes. You know what I mean, to be\nnamed, you know what mean? And this is the way it had gone on to a total change that the\nSoviet ties to the all extent that even the name. The other innovation was that all of a sudden,\nit began to get the commissars. And the commissars, as you have probably heard over about\nit, they were political commanders. So while even at a time as we were, we still had to give\nour ears to these political commissars. To hear the stories of Communism and Socialism and\nwhat their aim is and all of that. So this was a big kind of innovation that it's sort of in a way\nunbelievable. How was it going to happen? Yes, it did. In other words, no matter what we\nwere exposed to, we must have been exposed to politicizing the situation in the same way.\nThe second -- the third change was -- I already said the name changed, the command post\nand so on. The third was that from now on, no commander was a commander that he made\nhis own decisions. Any operation, even for instance, the territory was divided from where we\ndraw our supplies and which type of farmers could we come to get supplies from. In other\nwords, sort of not attack our own. So before it was we knew the area, the commander knew,\nfor instance, in these here settlements don't go barter because we got too many of our own\npeople. So we don't even go to ask them not to give food. We would come and take, let's say,\ncattle or whatever it is, and give them a receipt, so that when the Red Army came, you will\nbe paid for it. We knew it's not -- you know what I mean, but that was the way it went on,\nsort of to make it official, other than it used to be saying we robbed the farmers for food.\nWell, too, I don't say you don't because certain times like when the situation was bad, we\nwere blockaded, we couldn't help it; we had to carry things on on our own. But in the most of\nthe cases, the territory was divided that this and this companies go for their needs here and\nthere. And other companies use someplace else, and that's the way it was. When a battle\nneeded to be organized, it was decided in the general staff.",
        "Q: Was this an improvement or a problem?",
        "A: As a Jew we feel it improved one thing, that we sort of felt we were not an open prey. That\nthere's more authority; however, individually meeting up as used to call them the\n\"Easterners\" was touching. That's how we used to refer to them. Those who were the\nparatroopers who were thrown down. Jokes still went on. We saw a big change, the\ncame to be used to show off the command of a lieutenant or captain, while\nbefore they used to make them on the collar, you know what I mean the way it was. So we\nsaw anew, different insignias. Different changes. But above all, our fear for anti-Semitism,\nwe felt -- because we had, for instance, in our midst talking about the political commissar,\nCaptain Bavidoff (ph), and he was leading his group which it was strictly a political\ncommissar with printing little newsletters and all of this. And he was Jewish himself, sort of,\nyou know, it's sort of you felt you have somebody who you can depend on. So to put it\ntogether in capsule, anti-Semitism, perhaps, changed to be a little bit less because of that.\nHowever, it still was in there. It was a poison ivy that we couldn't get rid of it, and we\ncouldn't get rid of it as far as identifying many instances. And maybe we were too much in\npain to accuse easily anti-Semites, but it was not just easily. It was many, many subjects that\neither were bold enough to see that it was anti-Semitism.",
        "Q: But it got better?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So what happened next? I know we've these events to talk about, but. . .",
        "A: Well, the Ruda-Slaska battle, as you see, I capsulized it very small because I don't want to\ntake up. And the next battle will be Cozlo-Chechnya (ph).",
        "Q: But let me just ask you a question. At some point later you joined the Red Army, but this\nwas -- no, you didn't?",
        "A: What do you mean? I personally?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: No, I never joined the Red Army. No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I was only along with them from the partisans, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. So what do you want to tell me about this next battle?",
        "A: Okay. Just as Ruda Slaska was a very important thing for us to knock out, and we were freed\nfor about a few months, that they were knocked out. So (a) it was satisfaction. On the other\nside, controlling the other main artery which it was a much better road -- going through it\nwasn't like a forest road -- was Cozlo-Chechnya (ph). The Germans managed that after so\nmany miles apart they sort of build garrisons of controlling certain landmarks to be of their\nown, utilizing the local militia, the local people, which they were in the militia, and few\nGermans. You got to remember the importance of that particular time, the Germans said to\nmake an elite force out of them. Well, their elite force was to killing the Jews in these here\nspecial groups, which they were doing in Byelorussia and Ukraine and killing them on the\nspot. So rounding up Jews to kill from the ghettos or otherwise, that was their elite force.\nThey had everything one could wish for, and they always were told, \"If you don't do that,\nyou're going to be sent to the front lines.\" And the sending to the front lines to face the\nRussian front was a big punishment because, as history told us and we know already with\nMarshal Polis (ph) at that time, which would be the armies which the big rift did happen.\nAnd the Soviet's Army at that particular time was fighting really to the bitter end. There was\nno retreating and no giving up, so if 1t meant one-on-one fights after when it happened and\nthe Germans retreated, it was that. So the Germans did not have that 10 days with Moscow\nthat originally the way in '41, that was their slogan. Within 10 days they'll be in Moscow.\nThey realized that by 1943 how fast only was how fast are they retreating, and they did not\nwant to retreat faster than they were beat out. So the Germans used to keep that to their\nforces. Hey, if you're not going to behave well, you go to the front lines. To the Russian front\nlines. So a lot of the local people were given a choice. If you do not want to be drafted to go\nto the front lines, you have a choice to serve in the militia. So a lot of them who did want\neither escaped and joined the force. So we had another incoming force because of that. And\nthose people became good fighters, because they were fighting for their own local causes. So\nthey built there for, like I said, Ruda Slaska over here. Cozlo-Chechnya, which it was an\nended field say between Slonium and on the way like we were going to Lida, so that was a\nbig post that they built a big garrison. And that garrison was taking care of all of these area.\nThis was a new trick again that our command devised. That while we wanted to attack\nCozlo-Chechnya (ph), we didn't directly come to attack it there, but we went to attack\nanother place. The other place was a big bridge. It was a wooden bridge over the Niemen\nRiver in Melnitsa was the name of that little town nearby. So we sent forces in setting up,\nyou know, places setting up in hiding and I was -- the forces to jump out in case the German\npolice come going there. So we set up ambushes on them, so we came, poured gasoline,\nnaphtha, whatever we could get a hold of, including turpentine on that wooden bridge. And\nwe started to set a fire. We knew that once that bridge is going to go a fire, and that would be\ndropped a tremendous communication on a main road like this here. That the Cozlo-\nChechnya (ph) outpost over there would go, everybody would go out to come there to fight\nthe partisans while putting out the fire at the same time. It worked. No sooner they started to\nrun and that was about 30 miles away. No sooner all their vehicles and we saw them in from\nLida posts. The way they're starting to run towards that bridge that we set a fire, we attacked\nthem. And then easily with a few troops that were left in there, so it was no problem for us to\ntake over. It was one Jew, we used to call him \"The Bearded Moses.\" And he was a short\nman with a beard and he was the most heroic person known in that battle of Cozlo-Chechnya\n(ph). He by that time had killed about 15 policemen, until the 16 policemen from the back\nsaw it. You know what I mean, that what he is there. He ended him and with a single bullet\nkilled sort of our -- The Bearded Moses. And he was well known in the area for his heroism\nand so on. So, as I started to say, we captured; we had a big battle and the Howitzer was the\nsounding of time that we sent out. Which again, it was a new type of cannon, and I was at the\nmoment serving near the Howitzer as the second man. And between all the partisans which\nthey were needed to be -- so two parts. It wasn't a matter that this group, that group, all\npartisans who were on the force were taking place on that battle. And within a few hours, no\nsooner they found out over there, we told their people coming out, they started to go back.\nAs they started to go back, they were engaged in fire with us, because we attacked them. So\nit was not just the garrison itself. They suffered tremendous casualty and they suffered the\nprestige that once more the partisans were able to come and knock out the major post\nconnecting and even threaten. The bridge was burned apart. It took them weeks to have it\nrepaired, so basically our aim, what we wanted, is disrupt German communication and\ndisrupt the going on that they had to bring more forces and use people. So, per se, what we\nshowed the Soviet Union was answered in all ways the way we were doing it. However, this\ntime it was no longer a local job, but was a command coming all the way -- who know,\nmaybe it came even from Moscow. I am not equipped to tell you exactly.",
        "Q: A couple of questions for clarification. Can you guess at how many partisans would have\nbeen involved in this operation?",
        "A: I guesstimate that at least it was between 800 to 1,000 partisans. At least, because to cover\njust basically the area even in a thin kind of a way from all command posts. We're talking a\nperimeter of battle that at times lasted for about maybe 10, 15 miles. In other words, they\nwere fighting in one area near the bridge. Then around Cozlo-Chechnya (ph), which it was a\nsmall, little town, but it was quite a garrison established over there. So again, we showed the\nbiggest amount of power as it was previously ever displayed because on direction, we didn't\nuse that much of a force. Ruda Slaska, we didn't use that much of a force.",
        "Q: So that means these 1,000 or whatever number partisans maybe were broken into companies\nof a hundred...",
        "A: Correct, correct.",
        "Q: Okay. And there were men and women fighting?",
        "A: Were men and women, yes.",
        "Q: And...",
        "A: It stands out to me, one -- Rachel was her name -- and she was with Fania (ph)\nKommunarsk. I mentioned the name to him before. Rumor had it she was his girlfriend, and\nto look at that young lady dressed with a uniform on that horse, it was not so common to our\nera, you know what I mean, to see a young lady in uniform and horseback riding and be\nparticipating 1n battle. So a lot of these here things became more obvious at this time, that the\nfighting by young ladies were justified, you know what I mean, and so on. And they were\nrenowned about it, we knew it. We saw it.",
        "Q: Were the women treated differently than the men, than the partisans. . .",
        "A: Well, they were always a female. That still went on, and in any army, you can understand. A\nfemale had her priorities. Of course, the commander when he wanted a girl, she was his girl.\nYou know what I mean? So call it what you want to, but the feminine wish or ways, or\nwhatever it 1s, was very much visible at a particular time. Even when she was riding on a\nhorse. Even though that she was, you know, a good fighter and so on, it still was, on the\nother hand, that intuition of her feminine.",
        "Q: Were women given as much responsibility or different kinds of responsibilities?",
        "A: Well, to answer you did we have a commander woman, no. So, obviously, you can\nunderstand to judge from here that it was still a man's world and not a woman's world, or\nequal world. No. However, it was -- in the Russian Army to see women, it was no novelty.\nWe already seen it from '39 when the Soviets came to us. So it was perhaps different than we\nsaw it from the Polish Army from before, but women were in the Soviet Army as an equality\nmarker. So that part talking from a Soviet point of view, if you want to say, it was no\nnovelty. But in the partisans, yes, it was a novelty to see because if I was going to\npercentage-wise in any company, if they could have been one percent, it was already a big\nmarker. You could find, for instance, in our company there maybe were seven or eight\nwomen, and, like I say, the most of them were in the kitchen. Which, you know, where is a\nwoman's place? As sort of saying, it's in the kitchen. And they were utilized in the kitchen.\nYes. Or in a, let's say, as nursing, for instance, in the hospital. So it was as the past was for\nplacing the women in this kind of a ways. You know what I mean, yes.",
        "Q: But there were women who were on the front lines fighting?",
        "A: Yes. In the Soviet regular army. But with the partisans, depending on the occasion and\nwhere.",
        "Q: Well, there's one other thing that confuses me a little bit. When you talk about going into a\ngarrison and you use the word, \"police,\" are you talking about local recruits or Germans?",
        "A: Police, whenever we speak, we never referred to Germans. That was local. So being that\nthey used to be called by the Russian name of militia or the German police were organized --\nthe head of the police was a German. Or there were a few much, which it was jobs for the\nGermans who maybe were either injured or deserved the rank. That they were not going to\nthe front lines, so from the front lines, from the hospitals, they were given sort of something\nbetter.",
        "Q: Change tape.",
        "A: But with or without , It was contribution made by the local companies to supply people\nto join these paratroopers right now on that special mission. I was picked to be one basically\nbecause I spoke fluent Polish. Secondly, because I hailed from that area from Poland, and\nwith me was another young man. He was a Nordic, blonde hair, and could be easily\nmasqueraded as a non-Jew, which it happened as we shall tell later. That I was sort of in a\nway almost discovered that I am not what I am supposed to have been because I couldn't\nhide my face and makeup, we didn't use at the time. So the other boy's name which also was\nJewish and he was from my platoon was Polotchik (ph), that's what his name was. And we\nhad local area people join us. One guy who was a graduator of Polish officers\u2019 school,\nSurgay (ph), Surgay Balli (ph). That was his name, he was sort of Polish and white and\nRussian mixed in him, so either way you would call him Polish would be correct. Russian\nwould be again correct. And, of course, he was fluent in his Polish, and here I'm going to\nmake a point. They asked if anybody has pictures from the past to be a sort of identification\nto show when we meet up with this here AK underground or Polish underground, that's sort\nof to prove that we are authentic. So he had a picture in uniform as an officer cadet, and that\nwas while graduating his officers' school. Which in other times, that would give him -- in\nLondon, and is a ticket to be arrested and sent to Siberia. And this time, it served the purpose\nvery well, and he could show it off. So we were four of us from the locals, Surgay (ph) and\nanother guy who was a Polish-speaking white Russian, and I and then it was Polotchik (ph).\nSo the rest eight of them, including the commander of our group, were all easterners, as we\ncall them or referred to them, or paratroopers that were dropped. And they are disguised to\nsay that they joined the Polish Army in protest against the Communists and, therefore,\nthey're willing to give their life to fight with the Polish for the cause, that they are anti-\nCommunist. So it sort of was a supportive kind of thing, and every one of us was made up\nlike the documents, so it was really produced like in legal kind of a manner and way. And\nonce we crossed the Niemen, we started to go on the other side and we made our way up\nsouth, sort of that we knew in certain areas that there were more white Poles that were\noperating by night as partisans. By day, they were doing their regular work be as farmers, or\nwhatever their work took. And from talking and inquiries, we found out to make the contact\nto somebody, and we all, therefore, did not go in. But it was just Surgay -- per se, it used to\nbe Surgay and the commander or two would go in from the easterners, or rather the\nparatroopers. And I or would be in there because it's supportive evidence to carry on\na good conversation in Polish. The Russian at the time would keep quiet because he did not\nspeak Polish. So this 1s the way our contact was made and the groundwork was laid. They\ntook it for all the scripture that we told them that we are coming from around Warsaw and\nwe are trying to establish here a Polish partisan. In other words, that we will be able to help\ncreate because, you know, since there are surrogate partisans so we want to be on our side\nand do our work. And we used to be led from one pool to the other. Transportation was\nprovided by us, horses -- it was horseback riding. And at times, it did entail about a whole\nnight riding on a horseback, just having something covered on the horses. Did not have no\nsaddles or anything like this here, so it was -- when you got off that horse, you walked\naround like in a barrel. You couldn't stretch out, and that was part of it. In our weapons we\nhad at that time we had some automatic and the majority was end-shooters, automatic pistols\nand so on. So we didn't show a lot of weapons we'd ask for, for whatever reason it was. And\non one of these here occasions, 1t must have been maybe the third day and we used to were\ntrained and told that whenever you entered a Polish house, you're going to have to cross\nheart, you have to kneel to say your prayers. You had show the whole rigmarole that it looks\nlike authentic, and you cannot go away. And this is what it was, the Polish system and the\nPolish star, and all of us including myself as much as it hurt me to say some of those words.\nBut for lifesaving idea, you do a lot of things that you ask forgiveness, you know, in your\nheart. But you do it in order to survive and I did it. Again, it was the food eating kind, it's\nthey were serving pork and more pork. And to us, it was a novelty of having this food served\nbecause it was not like that. They went their normal way. And drinking, of course, rum. One\nof these nights we then first had to say our prayer. We sat behind the table, drinking had\nstarted with moonshine and Polish Vodka, you know, that some of it was shown to us. And\nthe host which was sitting across like from me at a table, and he says in Polish, \"\nwhich it means, \"You know what? To me, it looks like he's a Jew.\" I controlled my emotion\nnot to turn colors and quick, Surgay , aS I said Surgay, what you call it, picked up\nthis conversation and says, \"You know, it's funny you should say it,\" he says to him,\n\"because he's a Georgian.\" And the makeup of the Georgian people, which Stalin was one of\nthe Georgian, would be of the dark skin. And a lot of them could be taken, you would take\nfor -- they liked the long sideburns which I did wear long sideburns sometimes. If I would\nhave, it would have been an appropriate image to portray that that's what it was. But here\nwas a fast-acting period that took place, and he took over and I did not want to get in\ninvolved with talking. Basically, trembling inside as to what it is, so 1t went away smooth\nand the evening was ended. However, when our evening had ended and Polotchik, my other\nguy, was on patrol, because every time we entered a house there two guys on the outside on\npatrol watching because no matter how safe they told us to feel, we never knew this surprise\nthat it might ensue or might happen. So afterwards when we get together, I says look, this\nand this happened. And I believe you ought to know about it, and that's why I'm telling you. I\ndon't tell you from this moment on, neither I will not enter a house at all. However, you must\nbe with me for our own safety, because if we become a danger to our mission, what we're\nabout to do, remember they'll kill us both. So there will be nobody to say that it was wrong.\nSo accidents do happen, you know what I mean, and that could be that. So it was honestly an\nawakening and vice-versa because now on, it was guard each other. The reason I'm telling\nyou that that this is how anti-Semitism was penetrating, as I mentioned a few times before,\nthat in your own, no matter how safe you wanted to feel, you did not have that safety feeling\nthat you do not have to watch. Because we know from experience of how many Jews were\nkilled, which how do you describe it, that it was not an accident? You have to have the proof\nto prove it, and there was no one to question this.",
        "Q: But you were talking about with...",
        "A: Polotchik.",
        "Q: ... Polish. That's different than within your group.",
        "A: Yes, but I was talking to him one-on-one at this particular time, and he understood it and he\njoined with me. And from there on until the end of that mission ended, which we were\ntraveling around and we were already nearing the area in the forest near Grodno. But the fact\nremains that while our command suspected that the Polish partisans and the National Polish\npartisans where a resistance became very understandable to us, and they are visible. And\nthey had an easier way of operating because they did not have -- you know, the Germans did\nnot know who, what and where. For as long as the population didn't tell about you, bring you\nup, you were operating safe. So they could be where they are, do what they want to, and\nmanage to stay away, not to be -- maybe there are people Poland in the militia. It could be\npossible, I don't -- I don't doubt that a bit, but since I don't know the facts exactly, I don't\nwish to dwell on it too much. Until finally our mission ended, it was about 10 days.",
        "Q: Let's stop for a second. (noise)",
        "A: As easily I talk about it after that, that it ensued and happened at that time, I hope you get my\nunderstanding. That every minute of the day was a hard minute to pass because we were\nreally watching ourselves against two enemies. You never know did the Polish really take us\nfor granted or didn't they? And again, let's not forget the Germans.",
        "Q: It doesn't sound like it's getting quieter.",
        "A: The 10 days of agony really is not worthy enough a word to use as I said describing our\nordeal what we had go through. Being dressed in a Polish uniform, acting something that we\nare not, and all that rigmarole going through with it, prayers. Not I nor the Gentiles in our\ngroup were praying type of people in those days at all. Especially being from the Soviet side.\nSo all this here was -- I don't know to say what it was the worst part of it. But one thing\nwhich I did not say it, and I want to tell it. I disclosed the situation to the commander of our\ngroup. In another word way, I spoke to Polotchik. I says, \"You know,\" I didn't want to use\nbecause of it, \"I don't mind it to stay outside any time that we go into a house or anything\nlike this here. In other words, to be on patrol.\" And that was a well-taken word because this\nis the worst you can ask for, to be on patrol. In case of trouble, you're the first one to die. So\nthey didn't mind it, and especially these guys inside, it will be a drink and so on. And I did\nnot mind it at all to forsake it. And our mission, as Polish partisans, was nearing and we\npolitely took our uniforms off, burned them so there should be no recognition or anything\nlike that whatsoever. And now, we ensued to find a new place, to find is there any partisans\nat all in the area. We ran up on a place in the forest, what they called it ;\nwhich it means \"The Holy Mud\" place which it was, it was almost. And while going through\nthis forest and speaking to a Polish person from the area, he was the one speaking that telling\nus as a farmer that there are partisans in that area. And what we ran up against was a family\ncamp, but they, as a matter of fact, explained us that regular partisans as many times as they\nstarted to act over here, but in a short time later, they sort of get lost, and they don't know the\noutcome. Be that they got killed, be that they moved to other forests, or whatever it is. But\nseeing they were using that as a hiding place, they were very cautious and careful to have us\ncome in over there. We needed a guide at that particular time to know the area, and we found\ntwo of the Jewish people over there who knew the area exactly well. And they did not mind\nto become our guides and be with us for the period that we were. Our mission was at that\ntime, once we turned back in as Soviet partisans, to show the Germans that there are\npartisans over here. And how could we show it to the Germans or see what kind of reaction\ncomes from them? We went downing a telephone in a few places that we had to cut on the\nposts, just cut the wires and so on. And at one time, we used a new system that we tried. We\nhad already the plastic explosives where we would take and wrap it around so no longer did\nwe have to use a saw to cut it down. But we would wrap around this here and put in a\ncapsule, and from distance turn on -- from distance, turn it on and by one shot, the whole\npost, the telephone post, would blow up in the air. And devise to make it was disrupted, so to\nus, it was sort of like a fiasco, something we never experienced before 1n an action. And\nthat's why it was progress that we have seen in a different way of doing those things.\nBecause you could set it off very easily, in a few minutes. Just to wrap around, around the\ntree, you know, with a piece the explosive and blow up, in other words, a telephone like this\nhere. So that was our mission at that time and we did accomplish. We also had a train to go\nby rails that we where to explode some rail, train about it to do. So that was the three things\nthat we were involved in doing: Cutting down the telephone poles, disrupting\ncommunication, also burned down a bridge which it was a connecting small bridge in a side\nroad and -- which it was leading to a city. And also, blow up some rail, which it was -- when\nI think about blowing up the rail, when I think about it, I still shudder. Because we came to\nthat mission, and we really the night before did a lot of drinking. And while the drinking\ndidn't bother me in most cases, at this time -- but all of a sudden, while they used at that\nparticular time, they used to call it a shuntle. This was the rod to clean out your rifles with,\nand we had to put it in that fender ring so that would serve for the right train, and the train\nwould go by as to be able to go ahead to touch it and make an explosion.",
        "Q: Let's stop here a second. Don't move. Do you remember where we were?",
        "A: Yes. As I started to tell you, with my long coat, we were wearing army coats, which they\nwere long coats at that time. We really dressed back -- dressed back in army uniforms of the\nRussian Army, so this sort of did not have them with us, but we got them. And I'll tell you\nwhen. How they got them, I don't even know to tell you. But we got them and we were\nchanged over as Russian soldiers. Not fully, but almost. And all of a sudden, I saw that I\nattached the piece of steel or rather wire, that it was in between that ring which that was the\none to trigger it for an explosion. I saw it there, and I don't know -- I didn't know what to say.\nShould we run or whatever we should do, some kind of a motion, because -- and calmly we\nwent away. Looks like all the other Jew, there were three of us over there. The other two had\nseen it at the same time, and we retreated and we went away. Now, we did it like we used to\nbefore in other places. We retreated about maybe a half a mile away into the forest, and we\nwere waiting for a passing train. Whenever, we did not have a schedule, and the trains in\nthose years did not run on schedule either. Because military trains had priority and the other\npriority, which I know it now and I did not know it then, was trains carrying Jews to the\ncamps. They were the priority number one almost like the army trains at that particular time.\nSo -- and we heard a train in about an hour later, and we were just retreating waiting because\nwe wanted to know the damage. On the other hand, we couldn't even find out where the\ndamage was. So we heard an explosion, so we scored our three-way things that we had. We\nhad a bridge blown up, we did that. We had the train which we had accomplished that. The\ndamage what it was, we did not even wait, we retreated from there immediately upon the\nexplosion towards the forest because we were not too well familiar with the area. But we had\na map of the local area that we obtained, and military map which we knew whereabouts we\nhave to aim because we did not accept to go ahead to ask people our ways around, because\nwe couldn't trust anybody. So all in all, we found out that we knew about this group of\npeople who were in hiding which was like a family camp. Special partisans, we didn't make\ncontact with any of them. And we started through a different route now to go back to our\nbases on the other side of the Niemen. We decided at this time to go in our way without\nhorseback riding as we were going this way, so we knew it's going to be a long haul to it.\nAnd it took us -- well, it took us 10 days to go to the mission, we didn't see it. It took us two\nweeks until we finally came to the Niemen River near our area, and we had to get somebody\nwith a little boat and a gun that we met, a farmer. We had a little boat that he had, a canoe\nmore or less, to get us across on the other side. Seeing that there were 12, it was impossible\nfor all of us to go in. So we spread out like a few guy with machine guns around both sides in\ncase of attack, and once we landed on the other side, we were doing -- the same group was\ndoing for the others. To take cover until we were all on the other side. There we were on our\nown terms, we knew our ways around, and we finally came to our place where camp was set\nbefore. And our camp was still there because we were prepared that, who know, maybe we\ndid not have no telephones or any communications to know what animals. But it so\nhappened that everything was in place . And of course, our commander did his\nreporting and we were returning at this time back to our former group. A new group was\nformed and we were in it. This was the time really that I was named commandeer before\ncommander -- platoon commander before that mission. But now I was assigned a platoon,\nand I was commanding that, and we were right now working, not with the former group of\npartisans. But we were working right now with the paratroopers. And a new mission had\nstarted to ensue which it was taking -- it took us a few months to get all the equipment\ntogether. Like rubber boats were thrown down to us. Not boats, but, you know, the ones that\nare blown in the air and you can go which the army was using. And we prepared a new\nmission to be established which it looked almost like a front line break-through. Do you have\nthis on the tape? How far?\nVideographer: We're at 24 minutes.",
        "A: The new mission to be was a break-through. But right now, it was a unified command to that\nnew mission. It was the command from General Castankovich (ph) that was leading it, but\nour general staff was also involved. And there was more than 1,200 partisans got together\nnear the Niemen River, and at this time we were not looking or worried about who will\ndisrupt us. For the first time as we used to do our missions at night, this mission was done in\nbroad daylight. And as we came and we started on the Niemen to set up this here little\npontoon, sort of like. And our five guys to go through across, and it was set up right away\nalongside that perimeter at that time to be ready for attack. All we were wondering where the\npolice or where are the Polish partisans we already knew were in that area. The amount of so\nmuch armor that we had and the amount of so many people all gathered at one time on both\nsides of the Niemen River as it happened, because we went through. It would have taken us\ntoo long to get through all of it in one spot, so in various perimeters, we used so many people\nto get across the other side of the Niemen.",
        "Q: Where -- can you name a town that's in this area...",
        "A: Okay. We were crossing at this particular time, I with my group at that time were crossing\nnear the City Lida. And Lida is very -- I would say, kilometer-wise at that particular time, it\nmust have been maybe 30 or 40 kilometers, no more, to Lida that the crossing was taking\nplace. And as we came on the other side, we were given horses and wagons, which they\nwere confiscated from farmers and we were going just like a regular army would go. Some\nof them, we would be walking, but when we were walking, we were not marching scattered\nout. We were walking in a four across, but it was not next to each other. We were walking so\nmuch between each other that if we had to drop, take a position military style, that we were\nable to do that.",
        "Q: Why was it decided to do this in broad daylight?",
        "A: They wanted to show a big force. While previous times they did not want to show -- you go\na group of 12, a group of 20, the biggest missions in the partisans were achieved with small\ngroups unless an attack on a garrison. So right now they wanted -- you know, people\nexaggerate. When they see 1,200, I'm sure that the word got around that it was probably a\nforce of 2,000 to maybe 3,000. It's a usual way people repeat something like that, it looks\nbigger. And the command by all price, wanted at that particular time to show a big force.\nAnd we were going and we were not stopped or disrupted in any way while we were going\nat that time through forests. We didn't go through -- but the newest we had guys on horses to\nspot in settlements, to find out the reaction, what people are talking about it. And they were\nfilling us in that the militia was fleeing small garrisons or small militia places, because to\nthem it looked like a breakthrough from the front line, and it looks like they landed over\nhere. In Bialystok, at that particular time -- Bialystok is a big city and 1t was maybe 120, 150\nkilometers away. They were on ready massed two full divisions equipped to go to the front\nlines, and they took these few divisions and threw it at us. So we did not even have enough\ntime to get situated in the area. Which it was on day three, all of a sudden, airplanes above\nand what the airplanes did, the bombs -- was gasoline bombs. So the forest became on fire.\nSomething that 1t was never done before. (A) The Germans never bombed the forest with\nairplanes; second, with this type of gasoline bombs. So these gasoline bombs made so much\npanic that we did not know -- it didn't matter whether on a compass or the map, which way\nyou're going. Because you went to the right, you see more forests on fire. And with all of this\nhere, by the time that day was over, we were an army demolished in a way. Not from killing,\nbut in small groups. And any of the light armaments like we had the light artillery pieces\nwere all left and mined and a new retreat back started in a new fashion in small groups.\nEnd of tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: When did this take place?",
        "A: This I remember quite well because it was in December because coming back we know the\nice on the Niemen River, there were floating pieces of ice. And I know the time because\nChristmastime is a visible part, that I remember because it was a big, important thing to\nremember. But a big disaster happened to us at that time. I do not want to omit a very\nimportant story personally that I ensued on that day before the total retreat had started. I was\nlaid out with my platoon in front line. And when I say, \"platoon,\" I'm talking about 20-\nsomething guys. And all we had was two live machine guns. The one on the tripod with a\nround base was one of them. And the other one was a similar one. In other words, we had 10\nshooter rifles. All of a sudden, we heard the roar of tanks. So the roar of tanks, all of that had\nhappened before the airplanes showed up on the scene. I jumped a little bit the gun before.\nWhen I heard the roar of tanks, I sent one of my guys to tell to the commander of his that it's\nnoticeable, the tanks, and what have I got -- what kind of change of command, let's say, new\nposition. Because I told him I don't even have in my platoon one entire armored gun to shoot\nthem. So what with rifles, how am I going to shoot against them? And as they became closer,\nI decided to retreat on my own way without a command, and I went to the commander and\ntold him, I says, \"Look, there is infantry walking alongside the tanks, and there 1s at least\nvisible from distance, I had someone climb up on a tree, and they saw at least six tanks. \"\nBecause how far can you see, you know what I mean without field glasses or so on. So I\nsays, \"I know you probably did not have a chance so I retreated.\" He says, \"How dare you to\nretreat; we didn't tell you.\" I says, \"Do you think we're going to be able fight against this\nforce? With this, you don't have a chance.\" It didn't take another minute or two while we\nwere talking, a guy running come in and says, \"We are all ordered not to open fire, but we'll\nretreat. We'll retreat in a position like we came to the force away from where we were laid up\nalongside that road.\" And as soon nightfall came, my commander brought me into the high\ncommand to stand trail. I almost thought I am going to be shot. How dare was I to take and\nretreat my platoon on my own? My thing was since I had no ammunition, which it was a\nfact, to even attack a tank, why was I to disclose our position? We would wind up we would\nhave suffered a lot of casualties. It looks like command saw my plea much better than my\nimmediate commander from the company, and was case dismissed. But I was afraid that that\nwas curtains for me at that particular time because I did 1t on my own. As it turned out to be\nlater, I was allowed, of course, that I made a good decision by retreating my platoon to them.\nSeeing that the command would have come to me anyhow a few minutes later. So then after\nthe airplanes showed on the scene, which it was closer to the afternoon already, and so far\nthey did not start shooting directly. But all of a sudden, it burst out cannon shooting, which\nprobably it was from the tanks approaching. Although we, by that time, were retreated from\nthe area because that looked like the whole forest was going along the main road and the\nmain road going, I mean, going through the forest. Not a regular road to outside. And the\nroads in the forest were dirt roads as we can best way express it. But their tanks, you see,\ncould go through these roads. And wherever they stepped on trees, they stepped on trees.\nThey made their own roads out. That night the command told us that we are not going to\nensue fighting. We are going to retreat back to our base. We do not want to go 1n groups of\nmore than 10 because groups more than 10 will require too much exposure. And we were to\nmarch only by night, and if anyone is caught or whatever it is, it's -- you know what I mean,\nyou're just running. Cannot tell them our mission or anything like that. However, we were all\nasked that each one of us carry at this time more ammunition. So each of them were loaded\nup with more ammunition on ourselves. We walked and we came there, all right? And only\nthing was in favor was that it wasn't snowing at that time. It was just cold, but it wasn't\nsnowing. And food became a problem because as we went through the forest, we found\nblueberries or anything, we couldn't go ahead to have the luxury to stop at farmers until\nfinally a few days later and closer to our areas, that's when we began to go eat. When we\ncame near the Niemen, and our group to go across which it was -- I was 10 men or 12. I\nbelieve it was about 12 men with me. And there was another group divided for not so many.\nEach that we were walking away from each other, but not too far a distance that we couldn't\ncontact with each other. In case a fight ensues, that we could depend on the other one to help\nus. Either flank them or they would flank us. And when we came to the Niemen, we heard\nshots coming from all sides which later on, we discovered it was our own guys who were\npatrolling that area of the edge of the forest near the Niemen that they did not know what's\ngoing on. And they thought sort of maybe the Poles, the AK, are trying to come on this side.\nBecause they didn't look like an army, and, therefore, they fired the shots. A few casualties\nwere done, nothing is done to my platoon but some of the others. And the order was we\ngrabbed horses at that time from farmers, and anybody who was carrying a machine gun was\nallowed to sit on a horse. Alongside the horse, some other guys were swimming along,\nbecause pieces of ice were floating on that river. And by the time I came over on the other\nside of the Niemen, I managed one thing to do, not to stop. It became so the whole uniform\nthat I was dressed in, I became like a walking mountain of ice. But I was aware of myself, I\nkept sort of seeing that I'm alive and keep walking as well as I could until finally reached the\nfirst farmhouse. When I came into the first farmhouse, I found plenty more partisans who did\nprobably like myself. The woman of the house availed herself tremendously, and in that area\npeople used to have ovens which served them in their houses. That oven was cooking, for\nbaking as well as for heat. And on top, there was a place even to climb up and to sleep there.\nAnd since I had to get undressed, she gave me a change of something and put my clothing to\ndry out. There was moonshine there to drink, so we had a good drink. And on top of that\nstove, I climbed on. I fell asleep, needless to say, and by later on by morning -- that was the\nwooded area, so we didn't worry about because we knew it was clear because it was clear as\nfar as Germans were concerned, the police. And we started to make our way back to camp,\nwhere it was. So that was from a happy occasion as we marched as soldiers and brave guys\nto make it believe that it was a breakthrough, all of a sudden, for Christmas it was our dire\nmoment that we did not succeed. However, command did not stop with their idea. What they\ndid at this time instead of sending a big group and an army like they did, we were moving in\nthe same amount of people while we were retreating. In small groups, no bigger companies\nthan 20 people at one time were ordered where in a direction to meet in the forests around\nGrodno. And within, I would say, maybe two weeks to three weeks, we had a brand new\nforce organized in the forests over there. The front line -- by that time, I'm talking about in\nJanuary of 1944 -- the front lines began to become visible. That the Byelorussian, that they\nwere almost at the beginning in January of '44, that the army were entering 1n certain spots in\nthe Ukraine and in the forest. And we did not realize that within six, seven months, the army\nwill be here. We thought all along that maybe once the army becomes near, we would sort of\nbe discharged. But that was not Russia's idea or the Soviets saying -- we were at that\nparticular time pushed to go closer to Grodno. They had already their assignment. I\nremember vividly that the night before when I went to place a mine on the road -- at that\nparticular time we used a lot mines. We, you know, even used mines to put on the road\nbecause the retreating soldiers by the Soviet Army, we did not think that the Red Army is\nclose by. And I believe that that blowup of that mine, that 1t exploded on a truck that we\nfound out the next day was already that the Red Army is reaching. I jumped right now -- at\nleast about eight, nine months. In the area where my wife was and the area from originally I\nwas with the partisans, they came out of the forests about July, early August. I, as I said, still\nwe were involved with all of this here things, did not get discharged out of that until\nsometime in September. And a new mission was awaiting for me to get started because\nimmediately it was for 10 days that we were -- that the army was fighting the battle. On one\nside, the Soviets. And the other side, the Germans. A lot of Germans were left behind for\npurposes. They had the high churches as usual in the north. And on top of these churches,\nthey found them -- they placed themselves with glasses and they were able to tell the other\nside where the artillery is located to how we are to load firing. And their accuracy was\nbeyond belief. On the third round, they knocked the battery out. To the right, to the left, the\nturbine was in the center and your battery is all to pieces like .",
        "Q: I'm getting a little confused.",
        "A: You're get confused?",
        "Q: I'm getting confused about -- because you started jumping around a bit, saying that your wife\nwas -- at a certain time you were -- tell me where all of you are again.",
        "A: We are right now at a new area of the forest from where we started with the paratroopers.",
        "Q: In the winter of '44?",
        "A: In the winter of -- we are talking in January, February of '44. And I said God only would\nhave known that about six, seven months later the Red Army would already come in.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a question.",
        "A: Go right ahead.",
        "Q: Well, this is stx months later or whatever, the Red Army did come in. In those days, can you\n-- if you think back, did six months seem like an eternity, or did it...",
        "A: Six months, definitely an eternity. There is no ifs about it. Every day was long, but the closer\nthe front lines became reaching, the closer we used to see Soviet airplanes in the air flying\nthrough because we used to begin to see them now flying through our missions to bomb or\nso on. It sort of put in a new hole in life. It was still being possible to believe that really the\nfront lines are coming closer to us and the Soviets are returning. It was only like everybody\nhad one prayer, that we would live to see that. Because a new way had started in all this\nforce over there. While we were a way closer to Grodno, as I said, in small groups that we\nwere asked to come to this end. We must have had a force of about 800 partisans over there\nin various places. The old territory from where we descended sort of from, right now began\nto fill up with retreating Germans. And the partisans had suffered more casualties in this here\nlast month of the war as they did in two and a half years prior to that. Because first of all, the\narmy was afraid to retreat by the regular open road, so they used the forest. When they were\ngoing through the forest, there was no holy places for them as special by any army. And they\nhad their equipment, and, of course, the partisans could not help it. If they ensued in a little\nfight, the Germans did not stop with a fight because to them regrouping and retreating was\nmore important. So maybe a fight would ensue, they would look the opening where they\ncould do the best and get out. So that gave the partisans sort of another way of running away.\nBut there was nowhere to hide and nowhere to run to escape. And the biggest amount, my\nbest friends that I was to through the years were killed in the last -- in these here ensuing\nbattles of that time. I came out -- as a matter of fact, not to jump it. When the Red Army\nneared our places, one of the companies -- when the commander came, I was assigned at that\ntime to be in the other staff. And he came to telling the staff that the Red Army came and\ntook away his men. They need to refuse, where he in all kind of language stated to me, \"Who\nis your commander? Am I your commander? Am I the staff, or the guy in the Red Army?\nWhat right did you have?\" And he used them -- all the language to them, \"I don't care how\nyou get your men back. If they have to desert, let them desert. I want you to go and get your\nmen back.\" To his dismay, he couldn't keep up -- find his men. And this is a whole chaos at\nthat time existed, and until we finally came out on the outside after the 10 days' battle that\nhad ensued around the Niemen until the Russians break through. And after the encirclement,\nlike I said, you see, we were asked to come outside. What the partisans at that particular time\nwere asked to do was to keep going over on the streets and keep a vigil on the streets. At that\nparticular time we weren't -- did not have yet the order. As soon we found Germans hiding or\nanything and they surrendered, we didn't obey by the law. We would take them out in the\nfield and kill them. Of course, and take the ammunition away from them. So no sooner, a\nfew days all of that went on, there was an order issued that the partisans are no longer to kill\nthe Germans who are surrendering, because it's against the law. It was bring them -- and a\ncamp was started with POWs. It was sort of a defeating purpose to us, that command, but we\nhad to obey the order. And immediately the Soviets started to -- at that particular time, they\nwere probably in the front levels maybe two, three days. But they already had the\nadministration mapped out to what offices each building would be located. And before long,\nthey started taking to service the local population. The population was ordered that anybody\nbetween the ages of 21 to 55 is to register in an induction center to go back into service. The\nlocal population, which I'm speaking of at that place in Grodno, were Polish. That was not a\npart of Byelorussia, that was part of Poland. And that's the last thing that was on their mind is\nto be going, riding out to be taken to go do soldiering for the Soviet Union. The hate still was\nimbedded in them, so it was embedded all the way, you couldn't help it. So my new\nassignment was that I had to form a new platoon because a lot of them already went out in\nthe open and got jobs as accountants or whatever it is in the civilian life, and they were\ndischarged from this staff, which it was also in one of the buildings inside Grodno. For my\nluck, I did it. Firstly, I had a big dilemma with myself. I could not face the outside. To me,\nthe outside was atrocious. It was fearful. And second of all, I was afraid once I go out, they're\ntaking away my gun. To me, the gun was my life; 1t was my protection. It was everything I\nwanted, that's how I was. So one of the guys would come to me that he was a ;\ntoo. He was an accountant by trade. And he says, \"Herr, what is the matter with you?\" It was\nhard for me to describe -- was his name. He wrote a book in Yiddish. To the\nbest of knowledge, it was never translated. He wrote about me. The book in Yiddish title 1s\n\"The Participation of the Jews in the Soviet Underground.\" And he generalized that in\ntelling. He didn't stop on particular issues, but he generalized it to tell about the whole scope\nand all the various partisans that existed and to prove the Jews were participating in it. So he\ncame out, 1t makes sense, he was an accountant. He says, \"Herr, I understand you're going to\ncome out, too. Why don't you go and get a job?\" I went to my commander at that particular\ntime after that, and he says to me, \"Where do you think I'm going to send you? I'm going to\nsend you to the militia to go for a job? You stay here. I'll tell you when you're going to be\ndischarged.\" And I remained there. The next day we had a call from a colonel, a local\ncolonel, who needed soldiers. He did not have enough of the regular army. Whenever they\ndidn't have enough soldiers, they turned to the partisans at this particular time to go ahead\nand supply. So I got an order to send somebody for patrol to watch that colonel. I literally\nsent them 10 men, and every man that I sent came back. No, it was a general, excuse me.\nThat the general would not accept them as to be. And all they had to do 1s patrol the house. I\nbecame flabbergasted until I decided that I'm going to be the one and with the permission of\nmy commander, he allowed me, that I'm going to go on duty and serve it. I came in ina\nmilitary form, saluted to him, told him my rank, what I am. He was Jewish, a Semite. And\nafter, he says to me, \"Sit down.\" I sat down, and the biggest thing what had happened to me\nthat I did not expect to hear a Soviet General to say shalom. He said some Jewish. He says,\n\"Who did you send me? What kind of soldiers?\" I said, \"They're not soldiers. They were\npartisans. They were not trained soldiers. They were not inducted in the army.\" And they\nwere -- so they came and told him when they came on duty, he gave them up-and-down\nlook. \"Hey, come on. I don't need no farmer here.\" So he says, \"You see, you came like a\nsoldier. You saluted, you told your rank. I take you like a regular man in the army.\" So I told\nhim, \"I'm the platoon commander. My platoon is no longer because it was diversified to\nother things. And since you rejected 10 men, I had no alternative, so with the permission of\nmy commander, I came.\" \"Sit down, have a drink.\" You know, Russian style. You know,\nlike tea in England. That's how Russians were, that you have a drink that you show your\nhospitality and you show your closeness. I was afraid even to ask him too many questions,\nbut since he himself used that word, \"shalom,\" I took it for granted that he's open and he\nsays, \"Don't worry about it. I'll get somebody else for patrol. You're my concern.\" Because\nit's the first time that I met somebody who wanted to hear what happened. He didn't let me\nstay on duty, he asked me to stay there with him. And I stayed there for two days, and\nafterwards, I was called because I was to take my platoon and join the induction center\nbecause we had to bring the inductees about 60, 70 miles away to another city which it's\ncalled Monastyrok. Because the railroads were totally disrupted; the railroad did not go any\nfurther than Monastyrok. And so we mustered and within a few days a nice few thousand,\nmaybe over 5, 6,000 and we put them in rows. We had to march to get them out from the\ninduction center with bayonets. And the women and children and everybody was like a\ndemonstration. They're crying over why their men are taken from them and so on. And some\nof them tried to pay off. I knew from the grapevine that one of my platoon guys, because he\nlater came and asked me. And I told him that \"If you talk to me again about bribe, I'm going\nto have you arrested.\" So I don't want to hear about and I don't know -- so he understood that\nI don't want to be involved, but I wouldn't to hear. He was a Jewish boy from my platoon,\nand I sort of see and don't see, you know, and don't know. But whatever he wanted to do, he\nwent. And a lot of them what they did, they would write on a piece of paper that you have\nthis list. That period was mostly that you show up in Grodno, they'll take him, but they\nwouldn't induct him again. So what he did, in the meanwhile, they got someone that will\ngive you watches; someone will give you gold pieces and so on. I did not want to be a party\nto all of that, as I aforementioned. We loaded them into trains, and we went as far the old\nborder of the Soviet/Polish border. Over there, the military KGB took over and I was given\npapers to go back. I would say this would finalize this part of the chapter, and after that we're\ngoing have to talk about the liberation and what had happened in the field.",
        "Q: How much is left on this tape?\nVideographer: How much time we have. 25 minutes.",
        "A: 25 minutes? Okay. For me again, a human life had started with papers from the Soviet\ngovernment written in it that every place I show up with my platoon, no matter how many I\nhave, the head of this location of settlement is to provide me with my men, food, and shelter\nand a place to sleep. The trains at that particular time were all the military. It was a high\ncourt to get you something, a passenger train. So we didn't care, whatever we could get on on\na train, for my whole platoon I remained with one Gentile boy. Because I couldn't get hold\nhim under any other circumstances, who was with me and I knew the farm place from where\nhe came from that he had a mother and sister. And many times in the partisan life before I\njoined the paratroopers, we would stop off to his house and everything like that. So he was\nthe only one, Nathan, the guy that I told you was his name who was the bad guy who was\ntaking bribes, he, of course, realized the way I am. So he wanted to lose me faster than I\ncould go, I had to be lost. So we went in different directions, and we finally ended up on a\nmilitary train on the way to Baranovichi. From Baranovichi, if we get, we're going to work\nour way down further to go to his farm or back to direction to see why we can wind up over\nthere. In the meanwhile while we are in that military train, I already in between time stopped\noff in Minsk because I knew already that I was curious for me to see what's Minsk. And\nMinsk was already liberated months and months before. And I found out through the\npartisans that our main staff that was located in Grodno no longer is in Grodno, but it's right\nnow in Minsk located. I went there to be registered and to get my validated things. And I had\nto make another trip afterwards. The first thing I got up there was two medals that they gave\nme. One medal is for being a partisan, and the other medal was that I received at the time for\nbeing a heroic partisan. So all of sudden, when I was on this train with Walodia (ph)\ntogether, I had the two medals. He didn't get no medals or anything like that. He only got the\npartisan validation, it looked like a medal that everyone was given in Minsk. So when we got\non the train and that was a military train, within hours a guy comes over and I could\nrecognize by his hat, that this color hats and so on belong to the NK VD, we used to call it at\nthat time, which later turned to be KGB 1n due time later. He got involved in conversation\nand he asked me for documents. So I showed him the documents, firstly, these were given to\nme by the KGB when I was released from my platoon to go back. And the other documents\nthat I already had on me for the medals was that I was a partisan, and he found very\ninteresting to ask me. He says, \"I want to stay with you. You're going to fill me in and tell me\nwhat took place in the partisans.\" Because to him was a total new story that he heard about it\nthat Stalin used to rob and , but he never heard or known what activities and what\nhad went on. So \"Where are you going?\" he asked me. And I tried to say here, Walodia (ph)\nhere has a mother because he was from the and a sister, and I at the same time want\nto go back to that direction to see maybe somebody survived that I know from the partisans\nto me. And then I'm going to go to look for work. He says, \"You don't have to look for work.\nI'm going to take you to work.\" Then he told me that he's a lieutenant and probably going to\nget the rank of captain, and he's going to Baranovichi, which he will be inducting people for\nwork in the KGB. I realized that the KGB man will never say no more other things like that\nwhich at this particular time, I let him talk to me and I accepted it. And we were friends on\nthe train until we got to Baranovichi, the whole period, too. And that's how another phase of\nmy life had started. So that lieutenant did not let his eyes off of me and my partner, and we\nfinally descended in Baranovichi. And he made sure that I come with him and register in the\nemployment agency where he turned me into a captain in charge of that. To Walodia, my\nfriend, he says, \"The militia is right nearby. Let him go back there, and he gave him his name\nif any questions.\" And he registered there for a job and he'll be there.",
        "Q: When you use -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but when you use the term, \"militia,\" you're\nalways referring to the local soldiers?",
        "A: No, the local police. In Russia in the Soviet Russia, there was no such thing as police. It was\nalways militia. The militia was, you know what I mean, when we use saying the voluntary.\nThat was not voluntary, but that was a police force. Take the police department in any city,\nand I refer militia; that's what I mean.",
        "Q: Okay, you're talking about the local police when you say militia?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Okay. Just want to be correct.",
        "A: Yeah. All right. So Walodia registered there, and we made out with him that after\nregistration we both want to take a two weeks' vacation, sort of to speak, so he can go to his\nfarm. Because actually 1t was harvest time at that time, we're talking about September at the\ntime. The biggest harvest time in that area which his mother having a small farm, would\nhave needed a hand. There wasn't enough. So it was a good reason that they didn't mind that.\nAnd they let me go with him because I was going as sort of a farm hand to help him on his\nfarm. And at the same time, I just said I'll go. So we got a date within two weeks to meet up\nback, I and the officer of the KGB. And he and the office of the local police or militia, as\nthey were called. And while I went -- I already arrived now, they issued me new papers\nbecause in the Soviet Union you did not travel anyplace without having the justified papers.\nAnd the justified papers weren't meaning a permit. You see, at a time later on we had to get\npassports because you always had to have your ID with you. But at the time, they gave me\nand Walodia papers that we can go to the area. You had to specify where you're going, who\nyou're going to see, what you're going do about it. And papers in hand, we had already on the\ntrain free passage. No nothing like this here to go back to his farm in his little -- which it was\nlocated not to far from Russia. It was in a way sort of a happy journey for the first time for\nhim. The more I get freer and the more my eyes were seeing the free world, the more I\nbecame sort of shaken up. I could not take freedom. You did not have a psychiatrist at that\ntime or a doctor to go to for help to help you overcome. You just had to work it out. When I\ncame to his house, his mother gave him a changeover and she gave me a changeover. I was\ntreated like part of the family, which at that particular time was again a novelty item for a\nJew. A novelty item for survival from stuff like this here. So we, of course, we had dinner\nand a few drinks, and afterwards, the two of us went out in the little -- it was a farm\nsettlement, maybe I would say, maybe 60 to 80 families. And they all had farms, small\nfarms, around there, and there with a harmonica, you know what I mean, dancing and\ndrinking, which it was all a celebration. After all, they got a hero back, Walodia, which he\ngrew up in this here. And I, being the former commander of Walodia, which I used to come\nas a partisan with Walodia a lot of times, so I knew enough people in his settlement more\nthan just his mother and so son. We had another guy with us.",
        "Q: I don't know what this noise is.",
        "A: Some of these little things that I forgot myself to take and put it in a drawer and so on. Yes,\nthere was also a few more guys who were in our brigade serving as partisans from the same\nsettlement. And the other ones were inducted, while they would not be the paratroopers like\nwe were. Let's see, I was where?",
        "A: You were talking about you were at the settlement and everyone was happy to see Walodia\nhome and...",
        "Q: Walodia, yeah. So I said for this settlement they saw two heroes, Walodia and me. And the\ngreetings they gave me almost made a change in my heart and soul of thinking the way my\nfuture is to go. I went down so low as to say to myself I'm going to farm with Walodia and\nI'm going to forget any longer that I'm a Jew or was a Jew. Because the greeting, the way I\nwas received for the days ensuing, and that always went on a week's time. Each morning I\nwould go ahead with Walodia on his land and it was harvest time, get involved with the\nsame thing he was doing. At night we would go out together like Russian style to have some\ndrinking. And I figured, hey, what the heck, that's the life to live. I'll go back to all that\nsorrow, I thought maybe that's an escape for me. Then comes Friday, Walodia says to me,\n\"Harold, aren't you going to go into Debrecen to see your Jews?\" And that struck me quick\nlike a lightening went through my body, you know. I says what am I thinking about going to\nbecome a non-Jew, and I immediately began to think you can run, but you cannot hide. And\nhis words to me about -- he didn't say, \"Harold, how about going into town and to see our\npartisans,\" because the Jews that he was making reference to were not survivors, they were\npartisans but they were in other companies or groups likely. But they were basically with us\nin the forest. That issue for him saying Jews instead of partisans, it's like gave me a tremor in\nmy body that no, that was not the way to think the way I was thinking those few days. I'm\ngoing to probably become a Gentile and get married and forget about all that. I said to him,\n\"Oh, yes, Walodia. I was thinking to tell you about it, but I did not have the nerve of\ndisrupting all that work that you have on the farm. But, please, whenever time will permit\nyou, I would want to go in to visit.\" And not using that word, \"Jews,\" with out partisan\nfriends, and not using it in singular, but using much rather plural. However, I says, \"Let us\ncross near the Jewish cemetery of Debrecen because I will ask sort of for you to make a stop\nthere.\" Because in that cemetery I had both my grandparents. They still died before, no\nmatter what the tribulations were as I was talking about, so they still were brought to burial\nthere. My father also was buried there. So I sort of, like I say, was all of a sudden another\nperson again. And as we came to the cemetery, needless to say, that I could never see the\nheadstones that were put because the headstones were desecrated by the local area during\nthat year, which they were made to sidewalks and everything else. So my trip was not fully\nin vain because at least I saw that not only were the local, the living destroyed and harassed,\nbut even the dead did not have their peace to remain in peace in the places where they were\nplaced there. I did my share of crying, and all of a sudden, I was not a hero. The killer, the\npartisan that I was, I became the Jew again. Time was not running fast enough for me to\ncome into Debrecen, so I could meet up with some of my former mates that I was together in\nthe group or being in the other group. And I found the girls that I remembered that\nhad rode with us, so they sort of cling together. Nobody returned back into their homes, but\nmuch rather in one's home, the girls were staying. So they were in one home, the three girls\nwere staying together. One of the girls that I remembered when I was with , we sort\nof shared backs because sleeping at night and her husband was the bosky, which I mentioned\nwho had run away at that time from our areas to Mariansk\u00e9, she was there. And then I saw, I\nmet two more, and, of course, they were very happy at, you know what I mean, that I did\ncome. Basically, there were more girls by comparison to say a lot, than the Jews. And then I\nwent to meet up with the Dalchovitz (ph) family, and at the time I already heard that three\ngirls from Debrecen went to Baranovichi and they situated themselves with work over there.\nThey did not want to remain in a smaller town like Briesen was. Be that it was some fear,\nthat's why they cling. The man would stay in one house even if 1t was their house, former\nhouse I mean, or someone else's. But it wasn't like somebody moved in especially like the\nDalchovitz. At that particular time, there were three brothers. So it's understanding that they\nwere in their former home that they reclaimed. But the girls, I found that three of those living\nones were left and they could have, in other words, moved in back to theirs. But they stayed\nin the one house over there. And we did not hear of any bad feelings about it for the\nreturning partisans when they came to Debrecen. A lot of them reclaimed their properties\nwithout even going through the legal process. Be that the Gentiles were fearful of invoking\nthe law on them will hurt their future, or they did it as a gesture of their own, I would not be\nable to at this time to place judgment to tell you one way or the other. Because either way or\nboth of things would have been accurate and assumption. And I told them that I have\nundertaken a job in Baranovichi, and I will look up our girls over there, the three of them,\nsince I know now that they are in Baranovichi, near. So my stay over there was burning\nunder my feet. That whole epithet with Walodia bringing me back out of sort of, I don't want\nto use that word, that was a dream. Because if it was a dream, I must have to call it a bad\ndream. Or facing again the places of murder. Seeing in the middle of the town that for that\nshort little trme the partisans were there, they built a fence around. Painted up in white, and\nsort of put on an insignia to say that here are buried all those killed in the massacre of\nDebrecen. You know, without knowing the amount or whatever it is and that sort of\nremained like a monument place that I believe I last heard of that it was a little bit\nimprovement, more sign for that place. Because as I stated it before in my recordings to say\nthey were afraid to take them out to the big pits that the Russian making because of the fear\nof the partisans. So we saw that the pits filled up with lime on the top, that we whatever we\nare could find Debrecen. But the difference was now that I saw friends and I saw a sign\ntelling who 1s buried underneath there.",
        "Q: You didn't have any family or...",
        "A: Of course, my brothers, my sister, my uncles, my aunts. I had quite a big family which I\ndon't till this day were they killed and burned inside the ghetto or were they brought out and\nkilled in these holes in the center of the town, which they were led from the bombings when\nthe war had started.",
        "Q: No one left?",
        "A: No, no one survived it. I had my uncle which I mentioned who in my hideout came, and he\nsurvived them and he came to the forest. He told me that my brother started to fight the\npolice back and they didn't shoot him, but they beat him to death on the outside of the\napartment. So that's what I was told by him. And what had happened the fate of where they\nwere buried? My uncle and my rest of the brothers and sisters, I did not know. So perhaps\nmaybe this is the bitterness in me over why I never cared to return to Debrecen to face the\nevil. To see the injustices the way people and that era, and with no one to turn to to their help\nor to their safety. So I cut shorter even the time and then I returned to Baranovichi. When I\nreturned to Baranovichi, I looked up those three girls. Russa (ph) was the one you recollect\nin my conversation telling that she was the one taking care of that fuhrer. And it\nwas another girl, there was another girl who her boyfriend that she was dating at the time\nmet the last few days of liberation to them in the forest, he met his death at that time while on\na mission fighting there. And I, of course -- she was his girlfriend, and so she was in\nbedroom, and then was one more, Sonja, which she's in the USA. As a matter of fact, she\nlives in one of the condos in Boca, which I've seen. But she was living in New York before.\nSo those three girls housed themselves together, and often they told me that they used to get\nJewish guys as pilots or so coming to their apartment. So all of a sudden, I was invited by\nthem sort of to become a frequent visitor whenever I have time, you know. Which when time\npermitted me, I was. Now, I must step over to tell you another epithet which it happened\nwhile being in the NK VD. The NK VD work, which it may sound odd in the Soviet Union\nthat it went on, really I had one payroll check, but I was doing the work of four. I was a\nsecretarial job. I was the man in charge of the whole auto -- in other words, they had so many\nautos in the department, I was the one issuing for them gasoline tickets. I was the one doing\nthe accounting of consumption of all of that. And I also was the one responsible with another\njob that once a Minsk car would go to bring all kinds of stuff, be uniforms or whatever the\ndepartment needed, which it was located in Minsk. They kept it in Byelorussia, so as I say --\nand before the holidays so any roundups, I had to go duty as a KGB which I was assigned\nwith maybe two more guys and go to the houses. As the time of year it is, as I say, the war\nwas not over in total as yet, because the war went on until about May the 7th or the 8th when\nit was declared the war was over. So every time before a holiday was nearing, we used to\nhave to go to search homes and search passports and different documents. Because we were\ntold there are crime going on, and there are many people who resist the Soviet system\nbecause we used to give our political speeches. And it's our job to go and turn all of these\nhere criminals in. On one of these here journeys, one day it happened I was again the head of\nthe group, there were three of us. I knock on the door, and then I'm jumping the gun because\nthat happened already when I was married. I got married in January of 1945, and, you know,\nwe are quite a bit off yet. We are still talking about September, you know, August,\nSeptember, nearing October.",
        "Q: Let's just stick with the...",
        "A: So with that mission at that particular time, we were assigned to look for criminals. What\nwas the criminal? Somebody who did not report to be inducted. That was a criminal.\nEverybody in their passport had to have a separate page stamped from the induction center\nthat he's released from induction because maybe he was not fit medically -- I mean,\nphysically. Maybe he wasn't. There were other deficiencies, but on the passport if you did\nnot have that stamp or that page proving to you that you were released from service\nbecoming a soldier in other words, being inducted, you had to turn them in. And believe me\na lot of ttmes maybe the people have fear, did not have the documents with them, and we\nused to round up so much time. And then if they were questioned, they didn't find anything\nto hold them, they would let them out. Now, that particular night I'm knocking on the door,\nand I was first to knock on the door. And I keep telling them, I said, \"Make the lights. This is\nthe KGB coming for an inspection. Everybody come out holding their passports ready for\nexamination.\" In 1t comes out a voice in Yiddish with Hebrew stating say, \" ,\"\nwhich translating that into English means Hebrew or Jew, keep on walking. It sounds so\nstrange in a way and it got me in a very peculiar way. I went outside, closed the door, and I\nsaid -- the others say, \"Something going on?\" I says, \"Everything is in order. Everything is\nfine. Let us proceed to the next mission.\" He left me, however, with a feeling, I feel like I\nmust go back to that place. Find out who was that guy who was talking. You know what I\nmean? So sure enough, the next day in the middle of the day I'm coming there in uniform. I\nknock on the door, and I met him in there. I says, \"I was the guy last night. Who was the one\nwho said,\" \"? And he said he don't want to commit himself until -- which by\ncoincidence of how it would be, that was a cousin. A first cousin to my wife who was also a\npartisan at . And he was trying to beat, because the war was coming over, who\nwanted to be inducted? And after a while surviving a ghetto, surviving a partisan, and right\nnow he had to go back to fight? Besides the man was older, but he was still leading the\ncriterion of age, and he could not have any other way of saving himself from not going. So\nthey were really hiding out sort of waiting all of the days until it will come to an end and the\ninduction probably won't be here. Which I had to tell him, we got to talk word for word he\nwas with the , and word for word we got to talk about who I know and what,\nwhere and when. And I tried to tell him, give htm my wife's name. He says, \"You know,\nthat's my first cousin.\" So it was such a coincidence, we're thrown again 1n a funny kind of\nsituation. I tried to tell, I says, \"I'm working the KGB. I hope you understand. We met now,\nbut I cannot give my head for you guys' hiding. At this moment, you better do what you want\nto do. I don't want to find you again when I come here. I really cannot protect you, so you\ngot to do what you got to do.\" Which they moved away back, you know what I mean,\nsomeplace else. And, you know, it so happens neither one of them was inducted. They got\nthemselves secure jobs that they shouldn't be able to be inducted. And that was another little\nstory to tell what had happened over there. The next thing what had happened to me over\nthere that every time the captain would see me from the employment, he would turn around\nand say to me, \"You know, you need to go back to school because on your post that you\nhave, you can only -- must be at least a first lieutenant. You have no rank. We keep you here\nbecause we don't have any men, and besides you deserve it. You were in the partisans,\" and\nso on. So I says, \"Where 1s that school at?\" And he would tell me the school that was in\nRussia. In my mind I did not have the love for the Soviet system even then in my mind, and\nit was sort of a secretive part in me because you could not talk or disclose. In other words, I\ndidn't ask to go to work to the KGB. I was sort of forced into it in a way. And I started to tell\nhim that at the moment I wish I could get just a little bit more time to get the past out of my\nsystem. I mean, you know, the war is about -- not over yet, and I will take 1t under\nconsideration. Because over there they tell you to do, but it's got to come in a form that you\nask for it. That I will find in the proper time the papers to be sent to a special school of\nofficers to be able to further my career. At the same time to get an apartment was terrible.\nMany nights I would sleep in the apartment because as much as the man responsible for\nfinding housing and the housing man with a family they implanted somebody. And they used\nto say find room for Harold or Joe, or whatever it is and that's what it was. For families, it\nwas almost impossible because a lot of the houses were burned, you know, and destroyed.\nAnd here there was influx of so many more Soviets coming in because to take over the\noffices and make it under their control. So it was -- I got in a very bad mood, and one day I\ncome into the office. And I say to my captain there, which he was the boss of the\nemployment, I says, \"I decided that I want to join the service.\" He says, \"Wait a minute, you\nlittle so-and-so. Do you know where you're at? Have you forgotten that you're working for\nthe KGB? In the KGB, you're not coming to tell me what you are going to do, what you\nintend to do. We are going to tell you what to do, when to do it.\" He says, \"I will tell you\nwhether you can go and register as a volunteer to go to the army. Besides, we are on a\nspecial statute. You cannot be drafted without us from the KGB allowing you to serve. And\nyou cannot serve in the KGB of the military. You haven't got the education and you haven't\ngot the rank. So, therefore, get 1t out of your head and don't you dare ever come to ask me\nthings like that on your own.\" It fell not on deaf ears, but very open ears. I began to feel more\nscared than I felt secure before. I had a problem at that particular time, as I said, with\nhousing. And with food, I did not have so much a problem because I was eating in the\nofficers' restaurant, and at officers' restaurant the food was much better. I had a guy, Captain\nTrusoff (ph), who was 1n charge of financial department, and he would give me extra\ncoupons because we wore Russian cards at that time. But in the restaurant for the officers,\nyou could eat what you want and as much as you want, but had to have that card. So\nwhenever I wanted to have more than one meal I would go to Captain Trusoff (ph), and I\nwas a young man and I was a hungry person at the time for years when I was coming back to\nmyself. So he would see to it that if I need something, Captain Trusoff (ph) would be at my\nside. Before long behind that announcements that all the people who came from the formerly\nPoland and wish to return back can right now come and register at the Polish Soviet\nCommission and, you know, the hours and everything like that. Naively, I think nothing of\nit. I forget myself again and the words that he said about the KGB. I go ahead and register\nmyself the place that I was born. They knew that I was born in the city, you know, that it was\nin Poland. And I tell them when I register that I'm willing for a settlement to go back to\nPoland, not thinking for one moment that everything from that office is going to come\nimmediately to the KGB and they will immediately know that I went again to do something\nwithout permission, especially not an assignment. And that's this thing what had happened\nthe following the day when I came to work -- do we have enough time? When I came to\nwork, my door was locked. My boss locked the door. The other secretary was not let in to\ncome in, and he asked me to face him to sit down at his desk. And he started a full\ninvestigation about Harold. State your name. State your address. State your age. Where were\nyou born, and tell him all about myself like my history and the way I was in the partisans.\nAnd I was a platoon commander, and all of this here. And then he turns around, as if he\nwouldn't know, \"Tell me, I see you're wearing two medals. Would you explain me what\nthese medals is?\" I say to him, \"But I already told you before when I was hired here on the\njob what these medals are. What do you want ask me?\" In the meanwhile, tantrum is setting\nin on me. But he bangs his hand on the table, and he says, \"I already told you many times\nwhen I ask a question, you are to answer now when I ask you, and not to tell me that you\nalready. When I ask you any question, you must answer it to me.\" Okay. So I tell him what\nthese here two medals stand for. I already -- as I said which I will tell in another part, the\nway I got married and what had happened, was wearing a ring that my father-in-law bought\nme at that time. He says, \"What is that ring which you're wearing? Don't you know that that's\na showing of bourgeois?\" In other words, in our system, people do not wear rings because I\nanswered him that it's a ring that I got from my father-in-law as a gift from getting married.\nOkay.",
        "Q: We're going to stop.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: Now, I'm just trying to remember where we were when we stopped.",
        "A: We still are talking about right now that I registered, heard about registration to go back to\nPoland, 1f you remember. And I said I'm right now with the boss in my office with a locked\ndoor. And he's asking me all sorts of questions.",
        "Q: Okay. Let's pick up here.",
        "A: Okay. Ready? The questions ensued until about lunch hour. The lunch hour we started at 1\no'clock at that time. The boss called a halt and we're going for lunch. Since I was eligible and\nused to go to the same officers' restaurant as him, he told me they're going to stop right now\nand go for lunch. To my surprise when I came out to the restaurant, so many officers, all of\nsudden, like the news spread out. Everybody all of a sudden found out that Harold registered\nto go to Poland, and everybody knows, but Harold didn't know about it, see? And here I'm\nput to a dilemma, some officers be that they served in the police, be that they worked 1n the\nKGB with me, taking it for a total shock as if to say how dare you do a thing like that? You\nbrought shame on us. Here, look at him. He 1s a -- look at him, he 1s a second lieutenant.\nLook at the other one in all kinds of ranks. You're living here in a country where the Jews\nhave all the privileges and all the rights, and you are trying to away? I says, \"What do you\nmean, trying to go away? It was published for anybody who was born in Poland who can\nreturn back.\" \"Why do you want to go back to Poland?\" I said, \"Poland is the same. We are\nin Poland as it's here. Maybe by hook or by crook, I can look up some of my families or\nwhatever it 1s. I am not escaping, or anything like that. I would like to go ahead to see that.\"\n\"No, no, no. Poland is anti-Semitic, and you have no rights and business to go back.\" I says -\n- so he says to me, \"I want you -- I cannot order you -- that you must go back and withdraw\nyour registration. All of us officers here, you're loved by us all. We like you, you must return\nour rights to us now because you brought shame on us. And you must be erasing that. So the\nonly way for you to do it is you must go back and resign.\" There at lunch I meet up also with\nCaptain Trusoff, who I said was the head of the finance department, and he was a very fast-\ntalking guy, a man who could talk so fast that you could hardly hear him as fast as he was\nsaying. But he was a tremendous able man in the area of financing and accounting and so on.\nAnd often would like to talk with me and train me in that endeavor, which it meant more\nwork for me, you know. And he says, \"Harold, what are you trying to do?\" Here, a captain in\nthe KGB. I tell him the story. He said, \"Don't tell me none of which you're trying to tell the\nothers. You don't like it here. You want to run away from here because you want to go to\nAmerica. You still like the story of commerce and everything like that. So I don't want to\nbuy anything of this here.\" Listening to him, and he was like my right hand supplying with\nfood and so on, I was sort of under his guard. I cannot afford him not to turn against me. I\nsaid, \"Captain Trusoff, would you please tell me what you would like for me to do? I will\nlisten.\" He says, \"Good. You go and ask permission from your boss, and you go back to the\ncommission over there and make an official resignation. And everything will be fine, stay\nlike this here.\" I says, \"I'm going to ask my boss and I will do it. And thank you for advising\nme. I'm sorry I caused all of that to you.\" I apologized to all of them, and that's it. We went to\neat. Coming back, my boss started with the questions. I told him, I says, \"Please forgive me.\nI would like to ask a favor of you.\" He says, \"What is it?\" I says, \"I realized after talking to\nCaptain Trusoff and naming my name all the other officers, that I made a grave mistake. I\ndid not make that mistake maliciously or knowingly. I made that mistake for not thinking\nabout what I was doing, so I beg your pardon of forgiveness. And I want to get time so I can\ngo to the commission and register -- and in other words, resign officially on the document.\nWould you tell me that I can do it?\" He says, \"Tomorrow, you can do it in the regular hours\nof lunch. You can go there and resign.\" And he began to continue still with his questioning\nand he said that's the good thing that what I did now, and he appreciates it very much that I'm\nrestoring my dignity of the office, the job over here. And he knows that that is not going to\nhurt my qualifications of whatever it is further to be done. And I was turning back to my\nwork, the secretary came back in, and I thought maybe that it's all over. Two hours later, I\nwas called into another office, and again, the same thing started again. What it meant is now,\nthey were trying to compare notes as to what I was asked earlier, am I going to be repeating\nagain. I became so annoyed with it and so scared that I ran up a fever. We used to have a big\nbreak of the hours between 6:00 and 8:00 for two hours. Which it was like dinnertime. I told\nthe officer that I'm in charge that I am -- I feel like I have a fever, and I don't think I'll be able\nto walk home. I need the help of a taxi -- I mean, I said taxi. A cab, we did not have taxis\nthere. So I was given a cab to be taken home. When I came home, I took a thermometer and\nequal to the temperature as we would have, I almost had a 101 and 1/2. And I was shivering\nwhen I came into the house that I was living in it, where also former partisans and some of\nthem came back. So I tried to tell them the story, what had ensued with me, what it's all\nabout, and that I have a problem. How can I relay that message to my wife, which she was in\nShevchenko or or Chita or it's any of the three names that it's been called, all three,\nto tell her what had transpired over here? And when time came for me to come back to work,\nI didn't. And all of sudden, I hear the roar of a car. And in those days when you heard a roar\nfrom a car, it could have been only from the police of the KGB because civilian people did\nnot driving cars. And when I look out of the window, I saw the Commandant himself came\nin and walked in the house. He came into the house, asked me, \"How come you're not at\nwork?\" I tell him, I says, \"I developed a temperature, that's how I was taken. I couldn't come\nhome.\" And I show him the temperature. He says, \"I have an order to bring you back, so I\ndon't want to hear any of your excuses, temperature, whatever it is.\" Well, the women over\nthere in the house on the other side, \"Harold, take off your ring.\" I was having a watch.\n\"Take off the watch.\" I was under the pretension that I'm taken in to be arrested, no other\nway. And I'm leaving them a message, you know what I mean? One woman is offering me to\ntake a sandwich with me, you know what I mean? I say, \"I'm not hungry.\" Who could eat at\na time like that? And I came, was brought back to the office, to my office that I worked from.\nI'm sitting there for a half-hour and almost like malaria got on me. I was shivering. And I\ncould see the boss, the captain is not in. And like I expressed so many times before, I was in\nthat time a rebel. I picked up the phone and called the general. The general was the head of\nthe whole regional KGB. He was a hero from the war missing one hand, which he had lost in\nbattle. And that's what had helped him regain to have that rank what he got over there. And\nat times each one of us had assignments to be on guard duty for 24 hours in the main office\ninto various assignments. Some of them were encoding and decoding and some of them were\njust answering the phone and so on.",
        "Q: Would you just stop a second? Ready?",
        "A: I'm speaking now from the time I came home, like I said?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: No more from the time I came home. Asking for the (inaudible). All this interviewing got me\nshaken up to so much that I just -- my feet wouldn't walk. I felt very weak, and I had to\nsummon that they should send out a car to take me home for the big break, which they did.\nAnd I went by car way home. As soon I came into the apartment, I disclosed to my friends\nbecause I want you to know each room meant a family is living. It wasn't an apartment when\nI mean to say that one person had two rooms or three rooms. The whole house where I'm\nreferring to had about four rooms, but four rooms meant four families were living there. And\nthose families, with the exception of one, were also who was survivors that they survived in\nthe forest. That one family was in the Soviet Union at that time before the war broke out, so\nthey were saved from the agony of the ghetto and so on. And they just came back from the\nSoviet Union, so to them it was a different story to know what had happened and to find out\nhow much they missed the hangman in their own right. So I came in there, told them the\nwhole story what had ensued. I immediately got words from the people advising take off\nyour ring, take off your watch. Because the atmosphere became that I probably will wind up\nunder arrest, and who know what the outcome will be? My biggest worry was how do I get\nthe news to my wife, who was Shevchenko or at the time, which it was -- sure, by\ntrain it was not too far. But telephones, we did not have. The only way if I would want to get\n-- if I was to know somebody from the KGB and call him and come and tell them, which you\nknow that was a dream that I could not even dream about. But people used to come daily to\nBaranovichi from Chita, and I knew another family over there whose husband also the same\nage as my wife's and she was going to school in the same way. He used to work for the KGB\nin the -- on the railroad KGB, and her parents were also from the same city, from Chita. And,\ntherefore, I decided that someone should go to her and through her maybe would be able to\nget words to my wife about what is going on. Because I did not know will I be arrested, or\nwhat it will take place at the time. So, anyways, I came home. I couldn't eat or go to eat, and\nI couldn't go back to work since I started to take my temperature. I felt that I have a\ntemperature, and the temperature registered equal to our temperature reading about 101 over,\nyou know. I was shivering and everything like that. My being back to work was supposed to\nbe at 8 o'clock; 6:00 to 8:00 was the two hours. It must have been about 20 past 8:00 that we\nheard the roar of a car. And to hear the roar of a car was not a common thing because\ncivilians did not drive around in cars. So a car we could only hear from an official, and the\nofficial would either be KGB or the police, any of these here places. I took a look who's\ngoing out with the car, and it was the Commandant, as we would call him. The Commandant\nis the head person who was in charge of providing every necessary thing for all the working\npeople in the KGB in that building. And he also had a rank, it was his control so if you\nneeded housing, he was the one providing housing for you. If you needed to go be\ntransferred someplace, whatever, what arrangements would have been transportation and so,\nhe would provide that, too. And I say to him, \"I cannot go back to work. I have a\ntemperature.\" He says, \"I got an order, and you know that an order is to be filled out, you\nhave to come to come with me and I'm taking you. Okay? Don't let me use force,\" he says,\n\"Harold.\" I says, \"No, no. I didn't say that.\" I went in, came into my office where he let me\nout. No one is there, my boss 1s not there. I have no one to talk with. Now, I used that word\n6:00 to 8:00 because we did not have prescribed hours that you work to 10:00 or until 12:00.\nSometimes we would work till the wee hours, till 12 o'clock. And at times, before I had my\napartment -- my apartment I only got after I got married to my wife. Otherwise, a lot of\ntimes, I would sleep 1n the office like this here on the table or on the floor, one of the two.\nBecause apartments was at a dire shortage in Baranovichi in those days. So I see he's not\nthere, and here I'm feeling shivering like malaria with a fever. I picked up the telephone to\ntalk directly to the general. The general was the head of the whole regional KGB department,\nand he knew of me from before. Because I used to be there sometimes that we used to have\non a 24-hour guard, and I would be there. And he would like for me to tell him stories of the\npartisans or he would tell me stories about the front lines. He lost his left arm, and that's what\nhe was rewarded. In other words, that post that he was gotten. And I call him up, and he says\nto me, \"What can I do for you?\" I tell him. \"I was brought here to my office because of my\nboss' request. I am sick with a fever, and he is not even there. I don't know what he wants me\nfor.\" He says, \"Your boss 1s sitting right next to me over here. Why don't you speak to him\ndirectly?\" I says, \"Thank you very much,\" you know. He gave him the phone and I talked to\nhim. I says, \"I really don't know why you brought me here. I am sick. That's why I asked\nbefore to have a car taking me home. I have a fever.\" As we're speaking, \"I've got about 41\ndegrees which it's a high fever.\" 42 is the highest. I says, \"I cannot be on my feet; I'm\nshivering.\" He says, \"Okay. Well, I'm going to order you a cab and you go back home.\" This\nis the way I saw right there the way the KGB works. You're sick or whatever it 1s, everybody\nis calm, composed, and you will not realize. And no one came telling me what I was called\nfor or what it was all about. And I was taken back home. As I was taken back home, I had a\nhard time to fall asleep that night. I wanted -- I thought falling asleep would do me the best. I\njust lie awake, and I don't know what I really did to myself. Why did I think that stupidly to\nget involved with registering to go back to Poland and everything like that? And I almost\nthought I put my life on the line, and my biggest worry how do I get words to Sonja, to my\nwife about what's going on? Anyways, in the morning, I showed to work, and with the last\nwhatever force I had I walked. I didn't -- first of all, there was no phone that I could call in to\nhave a car pick me up. And to await the decency I knew that it would not happen, so I got up\nwith an early start and showed up for work. And as I came to work, I saw my boss and the\nrest of them. No conversation ensued about anything like that. I went over to him only and\nsaid, \"Do you remember that you permitted me today at my lunch hour time to go to the\noffice, the mixed commission of the Polish and Soviet, and resign?\" He says, \"Yes, I\nremember. What are you trying to ask me?\" I says, \"I'm trying to confirm at this time since\nwe're getting to our lunch hour. I think I'd rather go before I eat. Is it okay with you?\" He\nsays, \"You may leave right now.\" And I left right into that office and resigned. And the\nreason resigning, I was asked what it is, I wrote in, \"I realized that I have made a mistake.\nThat really I have no reason to go back to Poland. I feel good to where I am, and I'm happy\nto remain here.\" I came into the restaurant and I met some of the officers again that I met the\nday before, and I was trying to tell them the good news about that I resigned. \"Oh, we knew\nthat you're the right kind of guy and you know the right thing what to do.\" And everybody\nsort of instead of shying away from me like they did the big day, the previous day. Now, all\nof sudden, they came a little closer. \"We are very happy what you did, and you'll be very\nhappy with had happened.\" But in my heart I figured I cannot resign really from that. And I\nhad to plan a new way and justify in my mind what to do about escaping the Soviet Union at\nall.",
        "Q: Okay. Now, pardon me for asking this, but when you say, \"resign,\" you're using it a little\ndifferently than I would, I think. When you said you went in to resign, what does that mean?",
        "A: You write a paper resignation, like you resign of a job.",
        "Q: You're resigning from the KGB?",
        "A: No. Resigning from wanting to go to Poland.",
        "Q: Okay. That's what I needed to get clear. It's a little different.",
        "A: That means I wrote a resignation. First, I applied that I wanted permission to go Poland.\nNow, I did the reverse. There was another form that I filled out that I no longer wished to go\nto Poland.",
        "Q: So you basically revoked your former . . .",
        "A: I revoked -- if that word, \"revoked\" makes you better feeling about it, that's fine.",
        "Q: It just makes -- I just wanted to be clear.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Let me ask you one other thing while we're stopped here. You used the term, \"KGB.\" You\nbegan by using the term, \"NK VD.\" Are these the same organization you're talking about?",
        "A: NKVD was used through the years. However, as of late maybe for the last -- before the\nSoviet was broken up, but maybe even under the resistance way back about 20 years, this\ndepartment, which it was the security department of the Soviet Union, was changed. And the\nacronym of the words were no longer NK VD, but they remain KGB; also, the acronym of\nthe office of security for the Soviet Union.",
        "Q: So you used...",
        "A: So I used that merely that the reader, whichever way he knows or he heard, that's either it's\nNKVD or KGB, it's one of the same offices that it was changed. As of today when we refer\nto Soviet, they still refer to KGB because of the later...",
        "Q: Thank you. One other thing I think we need to go back to before you leave the Soviet Union.\nYou're mentioning a wife. Now, nowhere do I know how you met someone or where you got\nmarried or when. So can we backtrack and you tell me how that wound up?",
        "A: Yes. I'll backtrack this part till I come to tell you the rest of this story because I decided that\nthat decision must be done with me and my wife and her father. Because no longer could I in\nmy life think of myself, I had a partner to worry and help me decide my future. I met my\nwife after I became platoon commander. I became platoon commander sometimes in early\n'43. Afterwards I was taken away from my brigade, former brigade as I was, and was\nadopted to the new brigade that 1t was formed by Geno Tsinko (ph) which they were known\neither as the easterners or the paratrooper division and so on. In my platoon that I was given\nthe charge of was one young man who hails from the same city as my wife came from who\nalso was coming from the same hiding hut, let's refer to it as a hut, because it was built in a\npart of the ground and above the ground. And in that hut were living quite a few families in\nthe family camp, as I mentioned before. But the family camp was not close to us; it was close\nto the other people from her home town, or as we would call them in fighting groups of the\ntrap.",
        "Q: Her home town was?",
        "A: Zential (ph), . in Yiddish, the way they called it. They had a special\nname. So we had heard that young man live before and he decided to join the fighting part\nand he was put into my platoon. Through him while we would have to come on certain\nassignment things that were taking place, I needed a guide because that area was not as well\nfamiliar to me in the new place where we were at that time operating. So these guides, we\nhad the guides who were in that hiding house that he knew, I think, every tree, where it's\nlocated in the forest. Because he used to deal with live cattle buying, you know what I mean,\nbefore. So he would often be with the farmers involved, and that man used to be an uncle to\nthat guy, Lade (ph) was his name, who was in my platoon. So he would take me there at\ntimes when we would go because he wanted to visit with them. In the meanwhile on one of\nthose occasions, I spotted my present wife who was there. There were more girls besides her,\nand this is what the start that the romance had started. Of course, she had two guards with\nher, her brother, who survived; and her father, may he rest in peace now. But he survived and\ncame with us to the United States just as well. So she was well cared for by them, and I only\nwas able to talk, you know, with that little talk. And at night, when we would go to sleep,\nthey would make sure that I don't touch my present wife because father and brother were\nright in place in the right places. So it used to be that I, from talking, that I began to sort of\nget a liking for her, but I was not in the era a lover, per se. I had previous, which I didn't\nmention, I had a girl that I again was asked to be in love with her. And -- but we had to\ndisrupt it under the circumstances because they wanted to live in the family camp, and I said\nI didn't come to the forest for any other reason but to fight. And I, therefore, did not want to\nhear about family camp at all. And while from occasion to occasion, I used to meet up with\nher to help her out. But again I disrupt 1t because she wanted to get serious, and I was not a\nperson at the time for seriousness as to get involved even for dating steady. I was very much\n-- | was very much afraid in case, you know, from one thing leads to another, and who\nknow? You make the girl pregnant, and then you get killed. Why bring in another person\nirresponsibly? The way I was feeling at the time. And in all to tell you is babies were born.\nAbortions were performed. There was all kinds of things that it goes on in regular life, went\non also in the forest. Under different circumstances, of course, not the way it here goes on,\nbut it still went on and it's a fact to state. Afterwards when we got liberated, when I came\nback from my march for the two weeks that I went with Walodia, my wife held a grudge --\nmy present wife held a grudge at me for a while over why I didn't stop at her home town. But\nI rather decided to go with Walodia to his home and to go to Chita. And be for what it's\nworth it while I was working in the KGB, one day while going from work -- to work early in\nthe morning, I think from distance I saw somebody look like her. And the other girl which\nwas a girlfriend who lived in that same apartment which I later wound up living. And before\nlong, I closed the door and exited out and I make sure to my eyes that I had seen her. I met\nwith her and talked with her, and the girl told me now where she lives, and I promised her\nthat I will be in touch. And our romance began to sort of start. To tell you how it was with\nme in those days, I did not write letters. I wrote poems rather, and this was my expressing a\nlove to her and so on. By the way, if I didn't mention, I have six or seven published poems,\nwhich I have the books, and the majority of them are dedicated to the Holocaust and some of\nthem -- 1n one of them in the poems, like I said, I used that same words, I didn't come to the\nforest to fight -- I mean, to just hide, but I came to the forest to fight. And that's what's\nmaking my rhyming words. If you'll be interested some day, I'll let you read them, but it's\nbeen work that I did. And that's how we used to do, and from time to time she would come to\nvisit to my home town. She had where to stay, but with me, I did not get the time off to be\nable to do it.",
        "Q: How far was Baranovichi from Chita?",
        "A: I would say in the kilometers way of saying, at least I would say about a hundred kilometers.\nBecause first of all, from her to the railroad station, we had to walk about 16 kilometers. It\nwasn't such an easy task, and believe it or not in those years, winter or not, we would walk\nfrom the train station to her house and, of course, I used to walk and keep my pistol open. I\nmean, just in case. But that was again what I said, the training from the forest and gun on the\nside sort of made me satisfied that I worked for the KGB. Because I couldn't part with that\npistol at that particular time.",
        "Q: When did you get married?",
        "A: We got married January 5, 1945. After -- now, before I got married, I tried to ask -- because\nyou had to fill out forms and write for permission to get married. And since she was in her\nhome town, she couldn't come to me. Since she was working in a place, a publishing place\nfor the local paper, so she was typesetter, and she couldn't get permission because there was\nno one to replace her. I couldn't get permission because I was filling three, four jobs all the\ntime. So it was sort of we couldn't get to each other, so I was denied the third time after\nwriting to get off. After the third time denial, I did not ask anymore. On a clear Monday --\nbut it was not so clear -- it was a stormy snow at that time in Baranovichi, I decided to call\nher friend -- not the girlfriend that I aforementioned before, but the family, Briner (ph) was\nher name, to call on her because she was sort of trying to talk me into getting married sooner\nand that the better part of my life would have been improved and so on. And we made a\nfriendship sort of through that time through her friend who was living in the city. So I\nfrequently used to come visiting with them so I could hear regards from Sonja and so on. So\nI went over there to her, and I told her, I says, \"Look, we are going tonight.\" \"What do you\nmean, Harold? Did they give you permission?\" I says, \"I have no permit. We are going to the\nrailroad station. We are going tonight to Chita or Gottingen (ph), so I did. Snow or no snow,\nwe came there. We walked that walk all the way to the house, and when I came into the\nhouse, Sonja was by herself and she was shocked. Why didn't I tell her before? Her father\nwould have been able to prepare. I says, \"Tell you what? I couldn't tell you. But if I write to\nyou a letter that I'm trying to go ahead and take off without a permit, you should understand\nbetter than that. I came, it's tonight.\" So the first thing she went running to find her father.\nHer father then was playing cards in another house, and he came in. And, of course, it was a\nproblem. He wouldn't permit me to go sleep with her, obviously, to say. So we decided\ntomorrow, the following day, Tuesday, that we are going to go into -- it was called Zachs\n(ph). Zachs was the marriage license department officially in the Soviet Union, so we went\nto make that official. No sooner we got registered there and everything like that, I got a note\nto the house. Because the guys that were former partisans were working in the KGB here and\nwith the police also the same way. So they came quickly to the house to tell me that they are\nnot going to arrest me, but I have a warranty for my arrest and now that I came to the\nofficialdom -- everything was tied into the KGB. If you got married, the KGB got some of\nthe knowledge about it, too, because that's how they controlled the population. I being aware\nor not aware, I did it and I didn't care. I was the rebel at the time that I didn't care what's\ngoing tomorrow or the next hour. So they said to me, \"Harold, when do you decide to go\nback?\" I says, \"I plan on going back Thursday, no later.\" They say, \"Okay, we'll cover you\ntill Thursday, but Thursday you better get your fanny out of here because otherwise we got\nto arrest you.\" Of course, it looks like the KGB was notified officially after that where I am\nand that I'm on my way back and I'll be there. And my father-in-law, may he rest in peace,\ngave me Vodka to take home because he used to do black market dealing. He used to make\nthe uppers for boots, and boots in those days was like a jeweler, you know. Everybody liked\nto have a pair of boots, and that gave him enough from the farmers who from making boots,\nthat will would bring him all kinds of food in the house so it was no shortage. And before\nlong he used to go into black marketeer to get the other materials, leather and so on. He\nwould go to Vilna or other places for the raw materials. So she got him, and we already were\nmarried officially sort of the next morning because it was, and for that night we planned on a\nTuesday night to plan to have an official Jewish ceremony. So we got a hold the acting sort\nof rabbi, who was also a man who was in the partisans, but he was a blacksmith. And\nthrough history we know there were blacksmith rabbis 1n the times of the sages, so it was a\n. However, it came to write exuba (ph), meaning the marital contract, he tells me he\ndoes not know how. I says, \"I do know how, but, you know, I was a student of that. But it's\nillegitimate, you cannot write your own contract. It must be fulfilled by somebody else.\" So\nwe decided just in his presence and the presence of witnesses to give hands and it became\nsort of a married officialdom with all the other things, but without getting that official\ndocument, exuba (ph). But officially we went through the whole -- and the guys were there,\nthe former partisans, we had a house party to celebrate our wedding. But it was officially as\nit could be. Legally and officially, although not for the Jewish. So that's when we got\nmarried, and I came back. For greetings when I came in, I was arrested. I was asked to\nsurrender my gun immediately. The Commandant took me under arrest and charged me with\ndesertion. The thing, he put me into the jailhouse. A few hours later, after two hours, no one\nother than the general himself is coming down. And he says to him to the Commandant,\n\"Why did you arrest him?\" So he said he did, he had the order for desertion, so he turned\naround to me. \"Would you please tell me what has transpired?\" I tell him, I says, \"Three\ntimes I made applications filed through my boss that he knows for giving me permission to\ngo and get married.\" I says, \"I thought getting married is constitutional. However, I needed\nto do it in writing. I did, I lived up to it and three times I was turned down. So I got tired.\" He\nsays, \"I got to put boss in jail.\" He says, \"Get him out.\" He says, \"Not you.\" I thanked him,\nand afterwards I said to the Commandant, \"You see, I brought you salami and Vodka,\" and\nwe turned it into sort of a festive mood. And I went back to my office to continue my work,\nand no charges whatever. But at the same time I was fearful, so I left words with my father-\nin-law and discussed the issue of escape with him. And I said to him, \"Let's wait over a week\nor two. And please go ahead under this and this name.\" As I said at the outset of my\nrecording that my birth name was Zuckerman. I changed Zuckerman to Zissman; that's when\nthe changing took place. I registered because as Zissman, there was no one they can trace it\nto. So I didn't care how long it will take them to find out who that Zissman 1s. Rather that is\nthe KGB problem, but I told them they send in my brother-in-law -- my present brother-in-\nlaw, he went in sort of to be the person and they knew him. You know, in small towns they\nknew each other, and my new name became -- as far as the Polish government was\nconcerned, was Zissman and it was all changed. And I was awaiting when the papers will be\nready for them to let me know and I'll make the escape. However, deep in me -- and I was\ncalled now to go ahead for duty at the office of the general. I was afraid that somebody's not\nplaying and I said to my boss, I said, \"Why are you sending me after all I committed?\" He\nsays, \"You were told already too many times. When something's wrong, we'll tell you. You\nhave no reason for me to tell you. You asked to go for duty; you going to go up for the\nduty, and that's all. And ask yourself, I don't ask you to go out to get a new\nand mines.\" I did go and the next day after jury duty I was called to do my regular\nwork which since I was planning my going to Minsk which it was part of the once a month\nthat I would go for supplies, the uniform or the other one. And that used to be a week's going\naway. I would take a train to go to Minsk, and once I used to be saddled with more of my\nneeds than I had to supply and the supplies were there in order, I used to call for a truck and\nthey would send up a truck for me to come in. From Minsk to Baranovichi, it used to be\nmore than a day's driving because firstly, the road and the transportation type of trucks, the\nway it was. I, therefore, instead of going on the train to Minsk turned around and went to\nChita, to my wife's home town, and finding out that my father-in-law got the papers already\nfor me. If not, I got to know a time now because I'm afraid that it's burning under my feet to\nremain without doing anything about it. I did not trust the Soviet Union and the KGB that\nthey are not ultimately going to arrest me, okay?\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: I finished all of that, I think. Yeah. I was right now...",
        "Q: Well, your last words, you were in Chita and you were saying something to the effect that\nyou knew you had to leave the Soviet Union.",
        "A: Although like I said, I repented in the way they wanted me to do. But my own mind did not\nleave rest with me to make this here my permanent home. I still figured -- and I talked it over\nwith my wife before leaving Chita and her father that as soon they can have the proper\npapers, which I said I had them do under an assumed name, ready for me that I will come\nand get the papers or else he can bring them to me to Baranovichi with the papers and we are\ngoing to do. I had to get the goodwill of my wife and her father to go along with the program\nwhich that was part and I was going to get married, that I made up at first to say. If we\ncannot escape from here, there 1s no use in me getting involved and getting married.\nHowever, if that's what you want to do, that's fine with me. I'm willing one way or the other,\nso which I'm trying to say even though I said one thing, I still -- my mind was set out to do\nsomething else. I used this time period for detour to go to Chita just to find out how far the\npapers were going. To my amazement when I came there, I found out that it was a Polish\nholiday and the commission was closed; therefore, by no means could they get the papers\nready that particular day. Since I had to go to Minsk which it was my regular route time of\nthe month to pick up supplies, I hurried with -- my father-in-law gave me to take along some\nVodka and some butter and other things because you had to bribe the officials to get work\ndone, even in the KGB. So when you wanted to have work done fast, as it happened that I\nwas detained for one day being over there, so I decided at this time not to lose any more\ntime. And I came back to the train station and I couldn't get a civilian train, but 1t was a\nmilitary train, showing them documents that I was working for the KGB, and I had to go to\nMinsk. The commander permitted me to go with their train, which that helped to make up\ntime because their train was a direct train that it was going all the way to Minsk. So I made\nup quite a bit of time, as he promised, to have gotten a passenger train regularly going to\nMinsk. When I came to Minsk, I had my guy, which I usually used to call first. He was a\nJewish boy named Rueben, which he was born in Minsk and lived in Minsk. And he was\nworking also for the KGB. So I called him to tell him that I'm in town. He said, \"Harold,\nweren't you supposed to be here yesterday?\" I says, \"Why do you say that?\" He says, \"Please\nclear it up to me.\" He says, \"Major Spock (ph),\" which that was his name, \"was here\nyesterday in the office looking for you.\" I says, \"I did not know that Spock was supposed to\nbe here.\" Which I did not want to disclose to him, so it immediately gave me food for\nthought that they are not trusting me. And they sent Spock to set up to check for me to see\ndid I really go to Minsk or perhaps I went elsewhere. So my suspicion was correct. I came,\ntherefore, and I told them, \"Tell the boys I got good stuff for them. I got Vodka, I got butter\nand other things. Here 1s my order.\" And by all means I must have that order ready because\nat that particular time that was already Tuesday, I said Wednesday, I'm going to call a truck,\nso I must have it ready by Wednesday so when my truck comes -- so Thursday for traveling\nand that's it. Which I, instead of going to the office now, called my office in Baranovichi,\ntalking to my captain, the boss, and telling him that everything is going along all right. And it\nlooks like by all means he should be able to send out a truck tomorrow, because I'll have\neverything under control. I said, \"By the way\" -- I didn't. I says, \"I understand that Spock\nwas looking here for me. Is there any reason what?\" \"I did not know,\" he pretends, \"that\nSpock was there, so I could understand that he tried still again to prey on me.\" I says, \"No,\nno, no, no. Spock was not looking for you. And if he did, I don't know why. I don't know\nwhere Spock is at all.\" And I went about my business and by all means possible Thursday I\nwas back in town with everything. And my boss says to me, very graciously he says, \"You\nsee, and you want to leave us? Nobody can do things that good as you do. Everything is\norganized, and you're back.\" He gave me a lot of praise and fine. I says, \"I'm going to have a\nsurprise. My wife is here in town, and I want to bring her to you tomorrow to see.\" Because\nmy plans were to proceed already. My father-in-law, my brother-in-law and my wife were\nalready in the apartment because, as I said, I told them whenever the papers will be ready,\nask no questions. You come here. I cannot let time lost -- get lost over here because I got a\njump up and proceed. And now that I came back and I told my father-in-law the story, so\nthey saw it was on the nght track. So again to show you in a way you can say naive; on the\nother one you can see how brainwashed people are. As I said before, that I was trying to get\nmy wife to move to Baranovichi, and she couldn't leave her job. I wanted permission for me\nto move to Chita, and I couldn't get it. So when I came, I introduced her. My father-in-law\nand brother-in-law, no. I introduced her to him. I said, \"This 1s my wife. Meet her.\" He says,\n\"You see, I told someday she'll be here.\" I says, \"Of course, you helped a lot.\" I got enough\nto go along for the life story that he had a lot of help to it. And my plan was as soon as they\nsay goodbye, we are going to -- as soon as they see him, they're going to say goodbye to her\nfather and brother. And we are going to get to the station. We were not -- the office was not\ntoo far from the main station to go on train. I had to obtain tickets, which my father-in-law\nwent to get them. I did not even want to be seen in anything like that. So my brother-in-law\nand father-in-law did. And I came back to the apartment, took off my uniform, let my belt\nwith the gun, you know, and the whole thing come there. And I said to my brother-in-law, I\nsays, \"Please, tomorrow morning take it in. They'll ask you questions, you know, from not --\nyou came and you saw that I'm not there and I left the belting on, you did not know who is\nthat in the house.\" Which he did and day afterwards came back to look in the apartment.\nMaybe they can find something about it, and he says he doesn't know. As it was told to me\nlater another guy from the who also served in the KGB, on the military KGB, he\nand that other guy which I aforementioned before who was with my wife's friend, married to\nmy wife's friend, the two of them were sent all the way to Bialystok to look for me. I went on\nthe train that evening and by morning I was in Bialystok. Bialystok was Poland, and that was\nnot capital as Russia, but that was the big city. From where I grew up or from where I was\nborn, it was 150 miles either way to go to either of the cities. Coincidentally, when I came\nthere and I got into a house -- there wasn't hotels to go into then -- we used to go to\ngatherings where Jews are and it was on the move over there of all Europe. People were\nmoving, coming back and going someplace, and other ones just for speculative purposes.\nThe trains were loaded; people were on the top of the trains. Wherever they could room to\nget on a train people were there.",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "A: Now, we are talking about early May, not early the Ist or the 2nd, but it was in May of 19 --\nit had to be about -- to finish what I'm going to say -- had to be about May the 11th or 10th.\nSomething like here, of 1945. So we came there and take a look in the house. I found from\nmy home town a guy who went to school with. We used to rent an apartment when we first\nmoved to that city, that was our first apartment that we rent from his family to live in. And he\ntells me the good news as I had to tell him. Nobody was left. He was in hiding. And I say to\nhim I would like to go to Sri Lanka to visit it. He says please don't do that because one of the\nguys which he told me, which was also a guy of our age, who lived through in hiding, the\nfirst day he came back towards Sr Lanka, he was shot dead and killed. Well, they didn't --\nseeing us come back meant one thing, which I gave you to read about, the article. It meant\none thing, returning the apartments or returning the homes or the buildings to the Jews. It\nwas confiscated by their volition from the Germans and the Polish government, which it was\nestablished right after the war came to an end in that part which the Soviets liberated, they\ndid not look into it about the Poles should return with a public property, of their own\nproperty, which it was unofficially taken by them. So they didn't want to give it up, so it was\neasier to kill the Jews who claimed that instead of giving up theirs. I understand as of late the\nrule changed a little because they tried at one time to -- a lot of them claimed the properties\nyears afterwards when they came Poland. And the Polish government made a trick about it.\nYeah, you didn't pay the taxes in so many years. So now, how much the tax would be to pay\nwas more than the value of the house would be on the market. So that was another way, that\nway they did not have to return properties to Jews. I understand as of late right now, they\nchanged that any public property -- like, for instance, a synagogue, a Jewish school, or the\ncemeteries or any lots of that nature that had belonged to the community as one, if they had\nclaims to prove through legal means, they would return it back to the community. But they\ndidn't have to return it back to any personal owner. But that's what they tried to do. Maybe it\nwas another Yeshua imitation that you should back to Poland, so I listened to him, and didn't\ndare to go to the -- not to my birth town or to the home town that I lived from where I was\nchased out in 1939. And we decided -- I met somebody else who I knew in Baranovichi\nalready from my home town, and he came asked me would I go with him for black\nmarketing assignment. They used to go into Czechoslovakia. They used to go into Germany,\nbring certain things from there and get farm goods where they could be more available on\nthis end and that's how it went on. And people were doing this here black marketeering quite\nfreely at the time. There was no interference by any of the governments at that particular\ntime because the public was in need of means. And the governments were not ready and able\nto help them restore. So they were happy that no on is making demands on them. Well, my\nwife heard that, she says, \"No, you're not going.\" And I, you know, I did not want to separate\nmyself, although the means would have helped us, you know. Another thing happened to\nme, my father-in-law brought me -- he gave me along to take along when I was escaping, to\ntake a box of yeast. Yeast, they used to make moonshine and everything like that. And yeast\nwas coming in a can at that particular time, was easily accessible, and was the means of\ngetting money. When I came to the house where I met my friend, I had over there light flints\nand this here and it was stolen the first day. So I had a bad taste about being in -- so I said to\nmy wife, \"We cannot go here. We cannot go there.\" We heard that Lodz is building up a\nJewish community, and we heard a lot of people that we knew from were going to Lodz. So\nthese days, it was very easy to decide, you get your stuff which you have, cover, or whatever\nit is that he was carrying around in knapsack like, and you go to Lodz. We came to Lodz, we\nfound a lot of the former partisans which were there from same force as we were. And we\nfound a lot more people from various cities. It was quite a big returning place, Jews from the\ncamps and so on. That Jews survived in camps, I did not know until in Baranovichi when I\nworked for the KGB. That one day we were told that a train is passing by town on the way to\nVilna and in it there were inmates from camps that survived the concentration camps. Only\nthen, which it means in '45 of May, maybe about April or so, did I for the first time I went\npurposely to the station to see how these people looked. And that's the first time I saw the\nuniform with the stripes and I saw the faces of people who survived. Because to our own\nmeaning we thought the Jews were murdered out the same as it happened in our areas. That\nthere were massacres, and they killed them out. We had no idea of knowledge that there\nwere such things as concentration camps. So it was the first time that I saw that in about\nApril in Baranovichi, and then here coming to Bialystok and Lodz, I found out the other\nparts of survivors 1n inmates in concentration camps.",
        "Q: I'm curious what your reaction was to them, the people you met who had come from the\ncamps, what you saw...",
        "A: It was as much as if I was to be thrown into a different world altogether on a different part of\nthe world. It was the most unbelievable thing for me and many more about me who came out\nof the forests or for hiding to see people surviving especially after I found out what the\nconcentration camps were all about. You, for instance, until you read it, you didn't know\nabout it either, but to us survivors, it was a new phenomenon. A new strange thing to find\nout. And it was some in all -- although I spoke to those people, it sounded a very\ndisbelievable type of story, but that's what it was. And we did not even know how to treat it.\nYou did not know. Do you feel better about it with these people that you met? Do you have\nany conversation? Because to go on and have conversation, we had nothing in common\nbecause that was not the way things happened at all. To go on our conversation that we did\nwas again, strange people, what are you telling me about it? We have suffered; we were in\ncamps, and you were killing and murdering and doing this here, like this here fighting the\nGermans. It was a strange story for them to believe, and it was as strange to us to believe\ntheir plight and their story.",
        "Q: What were they like?",
        "A: Well, you saw a lot of people who were on their way to one thing. Did not have the colors.\nRemember, some of the camp when I talk to you about May 1945, like the Soviets freed\nthem in '44 or early part of '45. Between January of 1945 on the occupied part by the Soviets,\nall these camps were already liberated. You know, at that particular time, which we were\nthere in a way of speech five months. So it still was traveling going on toward around\nEurope, and for documents, the Red Cross was very busy locating people. Getting them\ntogether, helping them go to get passage to go back to their place from where they were\ntaken and so on. So it was quite busy places, so in Lodz, since we brought some things with\nus, you know that now the yeast was stolen. The flints were stolen. We had to go -- so one\nmorning, I says, \"Let me go to the marketplace,\" because it used to be like flea markets right\nthere. And people would bring whatever they want to sell, and at the same time for the things\nthat they needed other came to buy. So I took -- we had some covers and so on, and I figured\nwhatever it 1s, we don't need the covers any longer. And that would be the means for me to\nget some money. As I went to the market and I sold it and I'm on the way back to go back to\nthe apartment where we were. And next to the apartment, how things could sometimes fall in\nline, there was guy from my wife's town from Chita, and he was a baker and he had a bakery\nthere in Lodz. So one thing, if nothing else, we had bread. And he wouldn't take a nickel\nfrom us even for the bread. He was a dear friend of (sirens)... And he knew my wife's\nfamily quite well. So as I said, bread we had. Butter or any of the other things that we had to\ngo to obtain. So I sold it, that put a little money in my pocket at that time some of the things\nyou had. And while going, I take a look across the street from me. I see the same Major\nSpock on one of the streets going, and this is in Lodz. I almost felt in disbelief that I did not\nwant to trust my eyesight, that I had seen him. I says would they send somebody after me so\ndearly? For what, what I worth to them? But I asked no questions. When I saw him, I didn't\nwant to think of myself, that it's an oasis; I took it for real. Back then in Lodz, they have big\ndoors that they close up for at night and everybody is in, so you can drive in. And they have\na smaller doorway you can come through, and these big doors are just like it's the building 1s\nclosed off. I backed into one of these here and on the back of me to wait for a little while to\nlose sight of the man, and through a different way I started walking back home. I came home\nand tell my wife what had happened, and she says to me, \"What are you going to do?\" I says,\n\"I'm going to the organization.\" Understand, the organization of the partisans and Zionists'\norganization 1s being active, and people come to enlist themselves with them. Either those\nwho want to go for Israel, it already became active. I says, \"I cannot take chances to stay.\"\nShe says, \"Harold, we just heard yesterday through somebody\" -- every day people were\ncoming in -- that her father and her brother are trying to become over here. And we should\nstay in one place, so we can get together. The reason they couldn't go because his brother\nwho was taken to the army from the forest was supposed to be discharged, and he let them\nknow that he's coming back to Chita. So they were waiting, he was waiting for him. That's\nall he had left was one brother. And the family ties of those years were not like we know of\nties today, so that held him off. So I told her, I says, \"Make up your mind to remember who\nyou want to wait for, your father or for me to take a risk.\" I says, \"I will not take that risk, so\nlet me go and get registered.\" And I went to where they registered and told them what it was\nall entailed. They immediately told me where to go to an address. It was at the edge of town\nand over there was a closed, and it was like an underground organization again, which it was\na Zionist organization.",
        "Q: Who did you register with?",
        "A: That place -- I was told if you want to go and have passage to get somebody out to take care\nof you, go to this and this building and you'll find him. This kind of things went on all the\ntime. People wanted to run. People wanted to move. Legal ways to look was almost an\nimpossible -- next to impossible. So I came over there to that building with my wife. They\ntold us she cannot have no packages, so it was a good thing that didn't have mine because I\nsold it, other than what we had on our backs. And they told me that it's going to be a group of\na hundred guys together. They all were Zionists, young Zionists. All people of my age and\nmy wife's age. And it was meant, too, that we are going on the way to get into some\ncountries that we'll be able to get passage to come to Israel. The first destination was Prague,\nCzechoslovakia. Over here, we were sent to the Red Cross and will make documents\nbecause it's to go through. And the Red Cross made us documents as we were inmates and\nwanting to come back home. From every country we could not go to same. For instance, you\nhad to go through the Russian -- Russians were in Czechoslovakia, first of all important --\nand we wanted to go over to the British side or the American side was much further. But the\nBritish side was closer; it was in Austria. In Austria, there were the Germans -- I mean, the\nSoviets, while in Austria were also the British. And that's what our aim was, so you had to\nsay why do you want to go to Austria in Red Cross. Because at that particular time we acted\nthat we are Austrian Jews. You know, it was make up by this -- you couldn't tell the right\nthings because, otherwise, you did not know how about the KGB, is over here, too. So I\nbecame a man, same name -- because you didn't want to confuse the issues, but now I'm an\nAustrian Jew who is returning back home from the camps that I was freed. And that's how it\nwas, the whole thing. In Prague when we came, the Red Cross had a station and we were\ngiven food, and we're given shelter, if anything wanted, and they helped us with providing\ntransportation more. Our destination according now according to, you know, to the group\nevery 10 people had a head man. I was made the head of the 10 guys who were with me.\nAnd then we had a main commander. Our destination from Czechoslovakia was to go\nRomania to Budapest. And how you get passage, we did not want to be seen a hundred\npeople at one time, so we used to be in our group of the 10 and the other 10, and we used to\ncommunicate.",
        "Q: You meant Bucharest, not Budapest?",
        "A: No, I meant Budapest. Hungary.",
        "Q: Hungary? Oh, I thought you said Romania.",
        "A: Originally, excuse me. I must clarify that. Originally, we were supposed to go to Romania.\nAt the last moment was changed to go to Budapest and get further notice. We came into that\ntrain and it was a packed train. There were nuns and Polish people of all sorts and who\nknows, maybe Czechs and everybody was traveling at that particular time. On the roof, the\nmen of us went up on the roof, to make sure there was a place for the women. So the women\nwere left sitting inside. The men were either on the platform or else they went up on the roof.\nOn the roof there five of us, all former partisans. We supposedly don't understand Russian\nbecause otherwise would have been a bad deal. And these Russians were drunk and they are\nstarting to talk amongst themselves that they are going to go downstairs to rape the women.\nAnd then to go ahead to steal, they would take baggages and everything like that. It's hard for\na person who hasn't lived through that era. Now, we had a quick decision to make. What do\nwe do? How do I know that my woman 1s not going to get involved, or his woman, the other\none or anything like that? We made a quick decision. We cannot let these two Russians go\ndown. Since we were five of us there, we sort of split it, two, two, and one and then cover.\nTo cover, they were three -- yeah, they were three, not two. And we figure when we come to\na bridge while the train is traveling, we push that one guy to the right side, the other two to\nthe left side, and the one comes back to help. And since they were drunk, we know we would\nhave no problem. But it was again taking a risky chance, what we're trying to do. And sure\nenough, as we came to a bridge within a couple of minutes we got rid of these drunks. And\nnow, we are driving, we couldn't wait till we get to Budapest because actually we are now\nwe are fugitives. We pushed -- who knows whether they got killed or didn't get killed, but\nwe couldn't allow ourselves to remain. Just maybe they will not, maybe they're just talking.\nYou know, it's too serious a thing, and knowing that we are on a mission with all of these\nhere things that we cannot tell the whole thing, what it's all about. And we came to Budapest.\nAs soon we came, we were told to be to the Community Israeli there, which it means the\nJewish Community. It was staged the first march of people to march to the consulate at that\ntime and protest demanding the United Nations to grant Israel as a state, and we were the\nfirst people of that time to do it. And remember, it was under the control of the Soviets while\nthe Soviets were not as evident to see. That's what it was -- the part not in Poland, not in\nCzechoslovakia, not in Hungary at that time were the Soviets as evident as when you went\non the street. You know you saw a soldier here and there and the other, and whoever were\ntheir own people we did not know for the rest. And after that march, we were brought into\nthe house, and over there they had them like bunk beds made up, and that was our place.\nThey had a kitchen so it was sort of like a community type life setup, and that was done in\nthe former school, the Hebrew school, near the temple. That's where they located us. Of all\nthings being together, the same rabbi who gave us the marriage at that particular time, he\nwas one in that group, too, with us. So they were sleeping underneath, and they were\nsleeping on the top. As things would have it, come by night when we were all sleep,\nsomething broke. I injured almost from that piece of wood that almost fell. It's only a sideline\nwhich it happened.",
        "Q: Okay. Let's change tapes right now.",
        "A: ... some of this here that was going, so I said within a few days, we got our briefings and we\nhad to make new documents now. Now, we are traveling to Austria with another pretext, and\nall of a sudden we were turned out to be right now Greek Jews that we are going to, you\nknow, I mean, to look. Because we never wanted to tell the destination where we are going.\nIt was they never questioned why do you go round about ways. Maybe you should have\ngone some other ways, they didn't ask the questions. And it all was done by the Red Cross\nand the Red Cross was just going along with our wishes, you know, at that particular time.\nSo we had new documents now made. Everything is sealed, and they gave us to take along\nwith us salami. Everybody had to take so much salami and other things because we were told\nthat the food in Austria at the time was very critical, and especially there wasn't probably\nenough hunts for them to go out and get it. So while the means were in Austria, Austria was -\n- I mean, in Budapest, in Hungary, the means of foodstuff and everything like that was\neasier. So all of us had to give so much, we had to turn it in to the kitchen when we come to\nGrozny. We were ordered that only in groups of three, no more than three people, we should\npretend when we get off the train that we are people from the area. Not to draw any attention\nas stuff like this. People come off the train and they walked to their destination, we were\ngiven an outline of how to follow the strausses, that was the streets, until we reached their\nhotel. We all knew that the hotel was in the center, there was another nearby, so there was no\nmistakes. And above all, which I didn't mention before, while traveling like this here sort of\nas illegals, we used to get linguistic speaking. For instance, when we left Poland to\nCzechoslovakia, and from Czechoslovakia to -- we were forbidden to speak any Russian at\nall. We converse in Hebrew. We could converse in Yiddish; in Polish, it's fine. But Russian,\nfor one thing, no. Because we were supposedly going as inmates from concentration camps,\nand we had no reason to know Russian. Then we were, for instance, going now from\nBudapest to Grozny, you converse in Hebrew. He who doesn't speak Hebrew, speaks\nnothing, you know what I'm saying? Because we were as a different element it goes on, and\nall of that was briefed to like I say I was a headman of 10. So, in other words, you know\nwhat I mean, I was the leader of these 10 guys, and we all knew who the leader is, the main\nleader if any questions were.",
        "Q: I have a question. The various instructions you got, going to Prague and then to Bucharest or\nBudapest and back to Grozny, did you get -- in each place, did you get a new set of\ninstructions?",
        "A: Absolutely. We didn't get all the instructions further than today, we are going from here to\nthere. At the end of this destination, we got new instructions, so if somebody would have\ncome to me and asked me, \"Where are you going from Budapest?\" I did now know until I\nwas told it's not Bucharest, but it's Grozny, you see. And we finally came to Grozny,\nsurrendered our food in the hotel, and then we had to beg for food later. I mean, why, what,\nwhere, no questions asked. It happens with organizations. When it becomes government\norganizations, it takes some of the normal ways -- it will never go, but that's what it was. In\nthat hotel, I met up one guy who was with us in the forest. He was with Captain Davidoff\n(ph), 1f you heard me mention with the easterners, that he was serving there with him. And\nhis wife and my wife and I, we knew them personally well, and somehow or other, we had\nour group of guys which it was partisans. We had some from our area, some other partisans\nwere from an area called Valin (ph), which is the Ukraine, the western part of Ukraine which\nagain was Poland before 1939. And we sort of everybody was linking with his own, sort of.\nAnd immediately we were taking sort of charge as the partisans\u2019 area. Hey, you need muscle\nguys? We are here and we are available and we have the means to do it and carry it out. So\nbefore long while we are going from Grozny, yeah from then Grozny in the hotel, we\nwere told nothing when you're leaving the hotel what -- nothing. What saw day by day that\ncertain faces are no longer around. So I come over to this guy, I'll refer to him as Lusik (ph),\nthat was his name. And I find out immediately, he tells me that he is a guide. He guides\npeople how to cross the border. The aim of it, I to find out, 1s to cross over to the British\nzone, and this was still have to be so quietly done because it was still the Soviet zone\noccupied in Austria in this part. Although later on, Grozny becomes, the Soviets retreat until\nthey readjusted the borders. So he told me he's a guide. I says, \"Hey, can you do anything for\nus? When are we going to leave? How long are we going to stay here?\" And he said, \"Don't\nrush. Nobody's going to remain. Everybody's going to sent out.\" And it sort of was very\nstrange, but, you know, you put two and two together you get to understand. The guys with\nmoney paid off and they were -- so he was telling me he was taken through the Elk\nMountains to cross over. All of a sudden, I was summoned in the office to come in. They\nsay, \"Harold, tomorrow 12 guys, all of the partisans male and female, you're going to get a\ndirection where to go. You're going to go across.\" We was supposed to from there take the\ntrain to Klagenfurt (ph). From Klagenfurt, we were supposed to come to the way near the\nriver. The river was the Mur. The Mur River 1s a narrow river, but a fast flowing river. And\nwe made a decision that we are going to form like a chain. One swimmer, one no swimmer.\nOne swimmer, one no swimmer. And I was leading the chain this here the 10 of us actually\nin a way by the time we stretch were almost, but not too far would we stand on this end of\nthe water to the other. But in order to hold as I'm starting to enter with my chain already\nlinked up, a galloping horse with a Soviet, \"Halt.\" And they saying halt in German, then in\nRussian \"Stoi.\" In other words stand still, halt. And the first thing he's starting to ask, \"Who\nis the leader?\" \"We don't have no leader.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"We're trying to go on the\nother side of the river to go over there. We're going to visit relatives, so that's our shortcut.\"\nHe picks me, he says, \"The rest of you stay here. You come with me.\" Comes with him.\nWhat do you think, I was arrested. So I figure now, I run a half of Europe over away, and\nhere I'm being arrested by the Soviets. Knowing their scheme of things and everything like\nthat, I figure ultimately they got me and now they'll have a good right to charge me for\ndesertion. My wife realizing what it is, and I say my words to her. I says, \"Please, you have\nto have somebody go back to Grozny. They must come and bail me out. You know, the\nsituation; we cannot wait days.\" So immediately as soon they arrest them, so two guys went\nto board a train and they came back to Grozny, and they started tending on the table. To\nmake a long story about two mile, they were from Grozny, back with money and I was\nbailed out. Now, where do we go? We come back to Grozny to the hotel. Now, I come to the\noffice and I get my group together. I says, \"You know, we are partisans, right? Don't dare try\nto ask us to fight because we'll make a fight here to no matter what it costs. If it means to\ndestroy the hotel, we'll destroy it.\" I says, \"My group is going to be sent and you see you\nhave Lusik, he is the guide; he is going to take it.\" \"But, Baba, you cannot do it.\" I says,\n\"Okay. I have men stationed at all the exits already, two men.\" I says, \"If you want to declare\nwar, we'll make it war nght away.\" So I says, \"My ultimatum is not to be changed.\" I says,\n\"The first group going out of here today is going to be my group. Whatever more you have, I\nam not interested. I cannot let myself to be chances.\" I says, \"I was bailed out this time, I\ndon't know what the next time will be.\" And I got Lusik to my side. I says, \"You heard what\nI said, huh? And believe me, I mean it. I'm not going to deviate.\" Okay, it's settled, and they\nsay Lusik and his wife, \"You and Sonja come to be with us.\" And they tell us we're going to\ngo into a barn. The barn is on the zone border. The Russians are going to try to search in this\nhere. If you don't hide well enough anything they'll take away. They were looking for\nanything, , gold, rings, whatever it is. They were plain robbing, and we were paying\nthem off anyways. The guide used to give them -- let's assume if he give them some money\nor Vodka, for a bottle of Vodka, you did a lot of things. And if you heard it said, it's not just\nsaid, it was a true fact. But I was standing -- my wife at that time had a ring, other things. So\nshe did it in the old plan. We had, you know, from knitting yarn, so she made a ball of yarn\nout of it, and whatever we wanted to hide, we put it on the inside. And with the needle, you\nknow what I mean, so it looks very innocent that you know in the midst of starting to knit\nsomething, and that's how we got. We did not have that much to hide to begin with, but some\nguys in the group -- not in my group so much as the other -- were people who had money,\nyou know what I mean, that they had -- how they got it, speculating my things it's none of\nmy business what they had. And now we came in there, we were one, two, three that the\nRussians, and the rest of the group were on the other side of the barn. And there within a few\nhundred feet or so we were on British territory. Instructions were given to us that we must\nwalk very quietly because we are going to enter a British camp. And that British camp was a\npart of the United Nation camps, and they are going to separate us, so prepare yourself. The\nBritish office ran their camps like that. The men separate, and the women separate. That's\nstill the old British ways. So here we got in our midst some guys, coming in New York, I\nknew them quite well. And those people started yelling, and I asked them please behave.\nYou were told it's the English zone, we must enter quietly, and we must not yell. What are\nyou doing? Looks Sheila's hiding some stuff, maybe gold or who knows from him, and she\nremained behind. And they're making yelling noise. And I asked them to please stop, they\ndidn't. I and two more guys grabbed the man by his hand and the other guy with the other --\nwe carried them in inside. There was a warm stove, we put them under the stove. After that\nthe group of guys saw that here's a bunch of rebels, which it was the partisans and each time\neach one of us would look back, we would be looked sideways, you know what I'm saying.\nAnd all of a sudden, it became quiet. We were in that camp for about two days, and one\nnight we were told to get ready because pick-up time is going to be tonight. The Fifth Army,\nwhich it was the British Army stationed there on the border of Austria and Italy, they had a\nbig group from the Israelis, or at that particular time, call them Palestinian Jews who were\nserving in the Fifth Army and that was supported by them. So they are the ones who were\nhelping us, in other words, getting into Italy from there. And this is what it was, it was\nbringing in from one type of camp to another international United Nation camps in\nexchange. But this is how the root was all worked out to bring people, you know, to each\ntheir destination, Palestine. They picked us up on that truck and brought us to their camp\nwhere they were already on the Italian side. Clovishia (ph) was the name of the big city\nnearby. And for the first time we sat down over there to eat at tables, and, you know, the\nlooks of challah, they served us challah. We couldn't get it over, sort of we are used to before\nthe war challah was served on a Saturday, Friday. But here in the middle of the day, you\nknow what I mean, weak challah and the food they served up, it was out of this world. We\nwere led in to take showers and clean up. It was just like somebody opened up the doors to a\nnew world in existence that we did not know existed. From there they took us into Bologna.\nIn Bologna, we were let to go in to join the international camps, which they were the Armra\n(ph), if you've heard about it. They were supported. In that, of course, they deloused us,\nexcuse me for saying, and everything like that. And we were waiting for assignment of\nwhere, but it was warm in Italy in that part at that time of year. So literally in a park, we were\njust with bundles on our back, whichever one had something to cover himself to sleep on and\nwe were on the streets. The next day that we were there in Bologna in that place in that\ncamp, rather, 5,000 armed trucks were brought in which they were survivors of the\nMauthausen camps. Among all these people in the camps, my wife recognized an uncle of\nhers, his brother. We were last thing -- he was living in Slonim, not in the same town at that\ntime because that's where he got married. He was living there. So now we begin to see\nliterally face-to-face survivors from concentration camps and at this moment on the way it\nhappened that as soon he got registered, we kept ourselves together. We made like a family.\nNow, we are a family of three, and our next destination from there was Verona. From\nBologna, we were sent to Verona.",
        "Q: Well, these people were really fresh out of camp.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: This was not five months after the fact.",
        "A: They were just brought from Mauthausen.",
        "Q: What were they like?",
        "A: There wasn't one of them who looked normal. When I mean \"normal,\" one was swollen. One\nwas almost dying, you know what I'm saying, and one had more strength than the other. And\nit just was a matter of how badly you were damaged while being there before the Americans\npicked them up. Because remember, Mauthausen was -- and Buchenwald and all of this here\nwere liberated by the American Army, and that was the zone -- you know, it was zones\ndivided at that time. In Italy, for instance, there were the British, the Polish Army, there was\nalso the American Army.",
        "Q: What was the reaction in you and your wife, when you met these people?",
        "A: The reaction would be just like you come to a museum in a wax museum, and you see faces.\nAnd you almost pretend you see a living beings. That's what the people appeared to us in the\nfirst day. Within a short while, the picture changed to the better because those who needed\nhelp, hospitalization or whatever it is, were hospitalized. We kept ourselves with the uncle of\nmy wife right there, and he didn't step away from us and we didn't from him. And our next\ndestination was not so much where the camp wanted to send us to, but our leader which\nwanted us to be transferred was to Modena. And in Modena they gave us where it was a\nmilitary academy before, they gave us that academy to make houses. And all these people,\nwe were together over 6,000 people a group, all coming there, that was territory of the\nAmericans. So mind you, within a few feet away from us there were a camp from German\nprisoner of wars. And since we were brought there, every day started, you know, throwing\nwith bottles, throwing with rocks. Just the face to look of these Germans. Of course, the MPs\ndid not want a bit about it, and we started to say to the MPs, \"Either you relocate us, or you\nrelocate them. We cannot stand and be idle or do nothing like this here looking at yesterday's\nNazis who they did what they did to us.\" And what they did, they kept us in that camp and\nthey relocated. Within one day they emptied out the POW camp, and they took them away to\nanother place. And the military academy became ours, and life in that military academy,\nwhat can I tell you, it was on the floor. Wherever there was room you saw people. At night it\nwas used to ensue fights because one would step on each other going through. So it was\nanother way of being in a camp. To us who were in the partisans who didn't go through that\ntype of camps, it was a new way of life. We had a small room. In that small room, let's see,\nthere was I with my wife. There was another couple, I have even some pictures if -- you\nknow what I mean, from there if you sometimes will be interested, I'll let you make copies of\nthat. So they were telling -- that place over there in a single room, we were more than three\nfamilies. I mean, there singles, a few guys and there was another family who -- she comes\nhere in the wintertime. Her husband is no longer alive. And they were with us in that room in\nModena. And it was mixed children, I mean if you joined the administration, they made an\nadministration. So they came under the administration. And for the first time I had the\nopportunity to see a young lady from Britain coming in the name of, again, Jewish Tradition\nCommittee (ph). The American joined and they came to the administration trying to find out\nwhat kind of help that they can provide. And we tried to tell them where do want to start? Do\nyou need blankets? I says, \"Of course, we need blankets.\" Do you need this -- my demand to\nthem was at that time they must get the children out of this camp firsthand. Within a few\ndays, since in Italy sex for money was available, some youngsters, yesterday's survivors\nfrom the camps, wound up with venereal diseases. And we realized that mixture and makeup\nof women who were married and women maybe who were pregnant and young children, you\ntake this young child of 15 or 16 who survived the camp, that kid cannot be easily told by\nsomebody what to do. And they listened to us, I even have a picture to show it, where one\nday they took all the youngsters out and they took them away to another place making a\nkibbutz really. But that was a place where the youngsters were taken out and those who were\nvenereal stricken with venereal disease had to be, of course, hospitalized. But it was a new\nstory of my life to live in a camp which I did not want the best of it to take, you know what I\nmean, but you had to do the best under the administration.",
        "Q: How long were you in this camp?",
        "A: Literally, we were a few months in there because of the ensuing thing. As in now had started\nbecause they wanted to have leadership to know to go on. We knew there would be\nforthcoming more of the refugees. And I at that time was transferred to Milano. Near Milano\nin Italy we had on a farm area over there, that it was an official seminar, my wife went with\nme. And we had various speakers because it was a big political issue in Israel. While they\nwanted to save as many to get to Israel, it was at that time who and on which side will these\npeople join? Are they going to join the Jabotinsky side, or are they going to go with the Ben\nGurion side? And with the Israelis it was immediately, number one, and that's what it started.\nThat seminar started to teach us, us the future , the leaders, because I became a\nleader and a kibbutz. That was my best way of working my way out from the camp, you\nknow what I mean. Meanwhile I was assigned a place, and that was a training place. We\nstarted -- it was on a farm area. We started to teach people how to ride on tractors, how to do\nfarm work, while we provided this farm work for free. But it gave us a place of starting of\nhow to prepare until they would come with a truck and pick so many of them up, and they\nwere ready illegally to be shipped out be by boat or other ways to destination Palestine.",
        "Q: Did Anwar let you do this or they didn't know about it?",
        "A: The Anwar could not know anything about it at all. The old Anwar was given support in the\ncamps. Outside of the camps, we in many instances was the only support whatsoever. I did\nnot get back in support until I come back later in the story to Florence when my wife became\npregnant.",
        "Q: And so you were able to move in and out of these camps as you could?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. It was you take care of your what you can. The only thing you sign, which\nthey made us sign is that nobody 1s going to go to get a job. It was forbidden for any of the\nrefugees or the displaced persons 1n these camps, that's what the international organization\nguaranteed them. Because we were so hungry for things, we would probably do the same\nthing as it went on in Asia and everything like that. Work for next to nothing and ruin Italian\nworkers because of that. So that agreement was made available to us that we cannot go to\nlook jobs. The only thing our guys started to do, they started black marketeering. And, you\nknow, like those flea market you know to be in this country, you find a lot of flea markets in\nEuropean countries. And flea markets is how to control, people don't buy license, you know\nwhat I'm saying. And that's what the way was with some, and some of them were arrested by\nthe Italian government for doing, because I once -- I'll tell you the story later. Once I got in\ntouch with family here, my relatives rather, they used to send me packages. And cigarettes\nwas the best thing they're demanding for me to get. Not because of my habit of smoking,\nbecause cigarettes were like dollars in the bank. To sell a carton of cigarettes was nothing,\nyou know what I mean, it was the easiest to do. And it is money, the food was available in all\nsorts. But we were getting support through the international organization, and our people\nunfortunately did not know how to use it. You talk to these people about oatmeal, oatmeal in\nEurope until we came to Italy was not made as oatmeal flakes. But in the United States, that\nwas the means so these people were used to 1f you want to make oatmeal soup, you had the\nkernels; you don't have this here. So what was the place, we used to take things like this to\nthe marketplace and sell. They would give us condensed milk, you know. What do we do\nwith condensed milk? Nobody now who were in those countries knew of a such a thing as\ncondensed milk. Milk comes from a cow, and that's what you know about it. But there is no\nsuch thing. Powdered milk we knew because the Soviets used powdered, you know, soups\nand so on. Did you have anything here to ask me at this point?",
        "Q: Well, I tell you, we don't have too much time left on the tape, do we? We need to change the\ntape; then we'll go on.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "A: So as I aforementioned, I was working with the camp administration in Modena, Italy. I\nworked for a while, and became very, very disgusted since help was not forthcoming so\nsoon. The only good part for me to remember about Modena with the American soldiers\nbeing there because in my worst way, I wanted to communicate now with United States to\ntell a sister to my mother, my aunt -- she's still altve. She's in a home here. I just visit her\nyesterday, as a matter of fact. And she had a letter in her possession which I knew that my\nmother was pleading her that she should save me and see to make papers like would come to\nthe United States. She filled out her wishes before the war in 1939, and I believe I\naforementioned it in part that I was awaiting my passage in September, but Hitler disrupted\nme by declaration -- not the undeclared war in September, when it broke up. So all I\nremained now is we just had past story to tell about it. And I wanted at this time not just to\nlook for relatives, but to tell them where I am. That was impossible to send out from Modena\nat that time mail. The mail was still being organized. Remember we are talking about the late\npart in May, and I'm talking maybe perhaps right now in June of 1945. Where everything\nwas just unfolding with the end of World War II, and a lot of it started sort of a new life\nagain. So while the soldiers used to come to camp be from the MP and the others, and\nAmerican boys, soldiers that had cameras, they were very curious about us. And finding out\nthat we were the survivors and what it was, so they would come, get involved in\nconversation. And one day, I find a soldier and I take a look by his looks, I says, \"Are you\nJewish?\" I didn't speak English, I spoke Italian already at that time, and I spoke Yiddish with\nhim. So he says to me, \"Yes,\" in Yiddish. I says now that's the perfect man I want to. I says,\n\"I want from you one thing. To get in touch with an aunt of mine that she lives in Chicago.\"\n\"Chicago? Oh, I come from Chicago.\" And I tell him the address. I remembered that address\nby heart, because that was the way in Europe it was to continue into knowledge. I used to --\nmy mother used to make write a few sentences to my aunt, and, therefore -- and write the\naddress. So this was the aunt, she was a favorite of mine as a child. And therefore for writing\nfor so many times, I remembered 4455 North Drake Avenue, Chicago by heart. Did not have\na zip code in those years, but the rest of it, I knew. So I said to his soldier, I says, \"Please, I\nbet you I drove my aunt nuts by now because somebody would go to Moscow, I would tell\nthem here's the address. Drop in the mail and say it, 'Your sister's oldest son, Harold, is\nalive.\"\" Somebody here would go to Carmos (ph), whatever it is. So she got all this here over\nhere, and she almost went out of her cotton-picking mind. What am I doing? So when I got\nthis soldier, I say to her, I says, \"I hope she received, tell her, all my messages from before.\nTell her I'm in this camp. You know how to describe the address. You know it's the military\nacademy of Modena. And maybe you would let me use your mail until the post office will be\nestablished that I can maintain a correspondence with her.\" He says, \"Oh, they'll be no\nproblem.\" I gave him my name and I referred to, you know what I mean, the way it was and\ntried to tell her, I wrote to her in Yiddish because I knew that the best way. So I says she can\nput it in it, and I told her in short, I says who I am and I'm the only one who survived,\nremained alive. I'm right now in Italy in Modena and through the help of an American\nJewish soldier, I was able to mail it to you. It took about maybe two weeks or three weeks,\nand I got -- because the post for the army was going fast. It was not as it was for civilian. I\ngot -- he brought me a response and an answer that she got it all and now she wants to know\n-- now she's starting lecture me. Which, God bless her, that's what she used to do. She says,\n\"Harold, if you're single, stay single. If you're married, try not to have any children. But let\nus get in touch closer, we'll see to make papers to bring you.\" At that particular time, it\nsounded like remote, even to us. And here I had to go ahead to have sort of a correspondence\nmisunderstanding with her. I'm not ready to come to America, I say at that time, I want to go\nto Israel. And she kept on pleading I was full of flame and fire, but going to Palestine. And\nhere I'm trying to get to her not to make papers for me. So I tried to say I cannot ask you to\nmake papers yet at this time, but I'll keep it in mind. When I'm settled, I'm going to let you\nknow. In the meanwhile, whatever you want to help me otherwise, and I don't tell her in this\nfirst letter that I'm married and I'm in this, that and the other. I did not want to write too much\non a piece of paper somebody, you know what I mean, lets me use his mail. So in this letter\nwhen I got to read it, you can imagine how my wife felt at that particular time. Don't get\nmarried; don't have children. Little did I know that a little while later in about six months\nlater, we'll find out that my wife is pregnant, too. And that was peace at that time. That's why\nshe made -- three times she made papers until she made the proper papers. While she didn't\nwant to listen to me, she made papers for me as a single person. When she got more letters\nthat I'm married, so now she started to make in two names because we didn't tell her that my\nwife is pregnant. Why tell her? It was a remote thing we did not know. So then she had to\nmake the third time the papers when my daughter was born and she was born in Florence. So\nall in all, from Modena, I sought to join a seminar now for leadership seminar, which it was\ncreated at that time. And we had speakers from us one very outstanding Professor Garfinkel,\nwhich he became my idol for a while. And at that particular time, we were with mixed\nemotions. How do we train in the kibbutz these illegals when they come there? Everybody\nwanted them to be on their party, but 1t was not a one-way party who was helping the DPs at\nthat time. Bother parties were helping, and you had speakers on both sides to do.",
        "Q: You're talking about what you mentioned before, the Jabotinsky, versus the .. .",
        "A: Correct. The . In other words, both sides wanted to hunt new blood. You know, they\nwere actually hunting for new memberships and affiliations. I'll never forget one of the\nspeeches, it was so many years later by Professor Garfinkel. And I tried to ask a lot of people\nthat question when it was posed, and nobody could answer it. What does terror mean? And a\nlot of people lose themselves to answer the question. His idealism as a professor speaking to\nus, which he used, terror is an expression by a strong -- like he brought out Germany, like he\nbrought out the Soviet Union -- who has nothing to lose and he can get involved 1n terror.\nTerror is also a means by someone who cannot lost anymore either because he has nowhere\nto go, so it's as a last resort. So he tried to say in his speech, Professor Garfinkel at that time,\nthat Israel at this time is not in a way that she has a lot to lose. So, therefore, by going to go\nahead and extend terror at that particular time, we may lose what we achieved. So, therefore,\nwe should go ahead and train our people who go to Israel that they should join the left,\n, the Labor Party, which they were anti-terrorists instead of joining the right,\nwhich it was the Jabotinsky people who were pro-terror, that was their way of driving the\nBritish out and free the land. As we all know the outcome in 1948 after big maneuvers and\neverything like that, Israel was granted statehood. Well, all through this time we had a big\nproblem as of to prepare the newcomers to Israel that they should be aware of what's going\non at least on both ends and let them make an intelligence like that. So every time while I\ngained at that time leadership to become a leader for my kibbutz, and that kibbutz was not to\nfar from Modena. I successfully sent away from there a few groups, that they were trained\nand the training meant in a way almost brainwashing. Tell them what's going on while\nteaching him certain trades, and being the kibbutz was always meant to do something and in\na grand way. And since we made a kibbutz to be near farms, so it was good for us that we\nwere away from the city. We could do more things that we wanted to do while the city, the\ngovernment would not allow us for these here things. And this is the way a network was set\nup of people to be sent illegally to bypass the British, because the British white paper came\nout at that time which forbade for the Jews even as the DPs to come legally to Israel. So\nthat's what had stopped a lot of escaping before the war broke out, and that's what had\nstopped afterwards. But by hook or by crook, illegals were available. These same people\nwho faced the war and faced all its tribulation were ready to go back to Israel under all\ncircumstances possible, and a lot of them did give their life right there in the first battles that\nensued before Israel became a state. Others survived and they remained Israeli citizens and\nprovided a good home for themselves and for their offsprings. But the fact remains that these\npeople that after going through all the agony of war, being in the camps, us, the partisans\nfrom the forest, did not stop to say enough 1s enough. But they still were willing to give their\ngiven years what they had with them to go to fight for a cause. So again, we became new\nsoldiers to go out and fight for Israel at this time, and no longer for our personal things\nourselves and that was all about. I did successfully have a few kibbutz and any time I ask my\nsuperiors when is my turn to go, \"No, we still need you. We still need you.\" They kept on\nknocking it down. \"You get legal passage to Israel and you'll get it.\" One day I come and I\nhave the new good news to break to them. I used to come to Rome or Milano, and we were\nnear Milano, Milano was our point. And I tried to tell them, \"I have good news and bad\nnews. I said the good news 1s that I'm going to become a father. The bad news is I'm on the\nroad, how can I go ahead to do this here?\" And I did one thing which I want to admit to\nmyself at that time again, a personal thing. When I found out that my wife is pregnant, I took\ntime off. We knew that in Italy, there was some of the doctors from our forest that were with\nus. And there were two doctors over there, Rockover (ph) and Mastnig (ph) which that's how\nhe was he called. They both were surgeons, they saved a lot of lives during the war. And that\nwas in Venice or Venezia, the way it's called in Italian. They were living in a hotel. I took\nmy wife and made a trip to Venice, ready to do an abortion. I'm glad she's not present, she\ndoesn't like for me to talk about it. And we knew that it was done, just like in the forest. Dr.\nMastniq, as a matter of fact, died here a couple of years ago in Florida. He says, \"Yes, we are\ndoing it, Harold, but we won't do it to you.\" I says, \"Why? Please, I cannot afford to have a\nchild nght now.\" He says, \"First, yet you cannot afford for your wife to have an abortion.\" I\nsays, Why?\" He says, \"Look, there's a chance if we abort the first time that she may not be\nable to bear children. You will not be happy not to have a family.\" And I stopped begging\nhim, I understood it. And we both went home brokenhearted which later on in years in New\nYork when I used to come to visit my father-in-law in the summer months with the\ngrandchildren, and one day I go to my father-in-law, he says, \"I'm going to say hello to Dr.\nMesnick (ph).\" I come into there and I show him my daughter. He said to me, \"Is that what\nyou tried to destroy?\" I begged him not to talk about it because I did not want my daughter\neven to know. She was too young even to be talked about a subject like this here at the time.\nBut it was sort of how much all the agony I could get, I even got it from this part, too, in the\nright way, and it was -- I was a joyful person after that. Seeing that there is life and we got\nthe rebuilding to do. The only thing we had to stop at second child. My son was born in\nChicago; it was due to both children my wife had to have two Cesarean sections. And the\nbirth of daughter in Florence, Italy was a hard story to tell him. So he gave me the same\ndoctor, Manonovich (ph) was his name, he was also a refugee who survived from Greece,\nthe camps. And he gave me a letter when I told him we are going to America, and he says,\n\"Please, don't have her suffer. When you come to America, give that letter to a doctor. So if\nyour wife gets pregnant again, let her not go through with her pain.\" And little did I realize\nthat the same Cesarean section with my wife, by 5 o'clock in the afternoon, she got up, put\nher lipstick on, and it was, again -- in Italy, she was in a Catholic hospital, the maternita. She\nwas in the hospital for a whole month. And talking the way people were nice to us,\nespecially the Italians, they immediately understood that I was Jewish. Most likely, I'm\nkosher; they did not serve any kosher food. They couldn't bring it in. Because I gave them\nthe chocolates that I used to, Nestle's and Hershey that my relatives used to send me and the\ncigarettes, they permitted me, first of all, to have a bed in the hospital so I could be with my\nwife all the time. I could bring in food from the outside like chicken, and they permitted me\nto set up there that I could cook for her soup and a piece of chicken. So she had her means.\nSo it's undescribable to see it, 1t was a Catholic church, but Italians were very gracious to the\ndisplaced persons who came there after the war. And I thought I want to bring that out\nwhenever I have an opportunity to tell about it and I just did. So when I came telling them\nthat, they said, \"Well, wait. You can still be working.\" A few months later, my wife at that\ntime must have gone into the eight months or so. They say to me, \"Now, with your group,\nyou're going to be taken.\" I says, \"I with my group? No, I'm not risking two lives. My group\ncould be sent,\" and I says, \"I want to be -- from now on, I'm going to go to Florence.\"\nFlorence, Italy was kept through the United Nations and all the other organizations as a place\nfor the sick and the pregnant. In there we had the facilities and the Jewish community in\nFlorence was very supportive about it to oversee as to find us villas and so on. And they\nwould give us a lot of voluntary help to go on, so that we had a clinic there where a doctor\nwere on the premises all the time. And the pregnant women, as understandable, were an\nimportant issue at the time. We saw so much destruction and we wanted to see a fulfillment\nof replenishment. So we were under good car, so if anybody was pregnant and they wanted\nto be in Florence, it was an open city, like send them there. Then we turned back into the\nUnited Nations, to Anwar, they used to get each month so much money, which individually\nwe couldn't live on it. But while we were living like in a kibbutz, we could provide it. I went\nback to a kibbutz, but this kibbutz were really of people who were not going to Israel, but\nthey were waiting for passage to any other country that would accept them. And the majority\ndid register to go, like I at that particular time registered to go the United States. And we\nused to take, all of us, put in the money to sort of like a family, you know, together.\nEverybody would get certain things we would sell because we could not adhere ourselves to\nthe Italian foods. Spaghetti was a new issue to us. Polish people don't eat spaghetti; they eat\nother foods, but not spaghetti. The only thing in pasta we knew was, you know, to make\nother things, but not spaghetti. So it was a new diet and it was new things. So we used to\nhave everybody served in the kitchen, woman or man took their turn. And which we used to\nhave a collective kitchen, and we would sit down in the dining room. And we were culturally\n-- which I have pictures to prove that whatever we wore. We did not just seen to come there\nand just have our meal, and we were creative in the same way. And I awaited passage until I\nleft. Let's see, in 1948 in February, I got passage, and that's when I came to New York.",
        "Q: Now, this what you were calling it kibbutz was in the Florence area, right? It wasn't a park?",
        "A: No, that one I say I joined it, again, it was the form of a kibbutz created on another kibbutz\nlike, well, like it was in the...",
        "Q: Collective living arrangement?",
        "A: Correct. It was a collective living type. And we referred to them -- you know, which I have\nthe pictures. I will show them to you, which we called it a kibbutz. Kibbutz Alvet, which we\ncalled it, which it was a part of the labor movement in Israel and it was culturally when on.\nBut we worked it in means of a kibbutz that way, that we would share the responsibility\ntogether. We would all work together for all things that needed to be done. So it needed to be\ndone cleaning, our own people did the cleaning and cooking.",
        "Q: What about religion there?",
        "A: Okay. We had found over there room enough in the villa that we were living to make like a\nsynagogue inside of it. And believe it not, one year for the High Holidays when I was the\none who was doing the pray conducting, the prayers as a cantor. And right up to the holidays\nwhen I got the visa, everybody was joking, saying, \"You see, you prayed well. It\nimmediately worked.\" So...",
        "Q: Did that feel good about it, to be able to be a Jew again?",
        "A: It felt more than good, because like I say understanding that , which means I\nbelieve and being Jewish, this was the biggest expression by the survivors to give. Much\nmore than any Jew any part in the world who did not through Hitler. Because we were the\nones that when we came back and say we believe, that we don't come back with sort of\nblaming God for what had happened. But the majority was when we come the conclusion\nthat we always ask so where was man? Why look for the invisible? Why look to the thing\nthat we don't know who and where? But we do know where man 1s. We do know that man\ndid not care including the United States did not give a helping hand to stop. They did not\nopen their doors for immigration. We know the facts that even the St. Clures (ph) when they\ndocked which it was a movie made, \"The Voyage of the Damned.\" And a few among the\npeople could not be saved even to let into the United States. So you can understand that any\none of us who wanted to return back to Jewish life, who wanted to start praying again did a\nbig issue with himself that we justified ourselves and we turned our anger, not to God, but\nour angered returned to man. And any time whenever I wrote something about it or I spoke, I\nstill ask the same question. So where was man in those days? And I still feel justified with\nmy question. Not to ask where God was or where God is or what did God do, I would not\nwant to find out that there is a God who really tried to have us punished because of\nsomething we did wrong. Because I believe that God 1s referred to me as a father. God 1s\nreferred to me as a person who loves me as a father, and, therefore, this type of god cannot\ngo ahead to ask that I should be killed, murdered, maimed, all of these here things for\ndisobedience. A father does not ask for that. A father does not even want to surrender his\nchild for something little bit he did to community. So when you say the return back to\nbelieve was easy perhaps at once, but you felt something is missing in our life that we\nsurvived. And I believe religion was one of the basic things that we sought and we found\nourselves in. I have a lot about any results saying in many instances, but I don't want to --\nthis is not the place.",
        "Q: How much time do we have on this tape left?\nVideographer: We've got about five minutes, but I need to stop.",
        "A: Red light.",
        "Q: Sure if you guys are. Everything's on?",
        "A: I see red lights. Is that supposed to be the red lights?\nVideographer: Yeah, we're rolling.",
        "A: No, I'm not.",
        "Q: I think when we stopped, you were talking about religion, and that you didn't -- you blame\nmankind, but your experiences didn't make you resentful of being Jewish. Is that what you . .",
        "A: I wanted to make a point, and I'll read already it one more time. I said God 1s invisible to us.\nWe don't know where he is or what he 1s, but it's part of our belief. That is, the\n, | believe. What I believe in something really that other than created by man\nafterwards that we don't have a way of following the Moses or the things like that. But the\nHolocaust, per se, I do no want to make that a God issue, that God punished the Jews, that's\nwhy it happened or any other ways. I rather would turn to the things that is visible to us. Man\nis visible to us. We know, the mere fact that Germany, being the most cultural place of\nEurope at the time it happened could produce such an evil man as Adolph Hitler. And there\nwasn't enough, after all the tries that they tried to get rid of him, to rise up against him and\ndestroy him. After what he did to Germany besides what he do in the process to so many\nmillions of non-Jews as well as the six million Jews who he was having a war against the\nJews. So that's my interpretation. I cannot see the Holocaust in any other way or form as the\nwar against the Jews because at any time, the preparation legally he got them through\nNuremberg to make everything legal what he did afterwards. Which I mean at this time, the\nhumanization program, the right of taking away from all of them that they're not even\nhumans; they're subhumans. And, therefore, he prepared it so that the people should not feel\nthat they're doing an injustice, but the people are getting rid of a menace or something, it's\nnot so. So when man let one person, one person's religion, if you -- I want to call it a religion,\nbecause he believed in it, in Nazism -- go as far as it was worded to let destroy people and\ndestroy their offspring and so on. How can I turn to ask for -- to look for the invisible or the\nperson that I cannot speak personally or ask him questions? This is why my conviction past\nWorld War II, past the Holocaust, remains that believing in the invisible, believing in the\nJewish theology, believing in all the creation, that this did is something worth analyzing\nagain, and it's something worth living. And I remain Jewish, that's a fact. I almost tried to get\naway with it as I told in my chapter. And I'm happy till this day with the conviction I made\nnot to work against the tide, but to go with the tide. And I feel very comfortably today that I\ndo not ask the Almighty what he did.",
        "Q: During the war years, was religion at all important to you? Was it a source of strength? Did\nyou resent it? Did you think about it?",
        "A: Perhaps it's hard for you to memorize what we did earlier, but I did tell you in the most\nhorrendous days of my life being in the ghetto, that I was exposed and be with a brother to\nmy father and he was a rabbi. And I have told you the way he was speaking to me, that we\nmust go on and doing it because in the 14th century with the , God had so much\nfaith in the Jewish people that he could put them to an exposure like he did, and he had the\nfaith in them that they will not convert for the sake of remaining living people. But much\nrather they were strong enough to say no. Do you want to be Jewish? And they remained\nJewish. And, you see, the fleeing rabbis felt so distasteful with the trying to enforce on them\nthat they threw on, as we call it, a herem. A herem means forbidden. That it was forbidden\nfor Jews to return back to Spain, even after the change of government and rather because it\nwas off limits sort of to speak as in modern language we would say for Jewish to continue\nalive over there.",
        "Q: But I understand. I remember your telling me about your uncle.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But how did that lesson carry with you while you were fighting in the forest?",
        "A: Well, when I was fighting in the forest, to me he was already gone. I don't know, he was\ntaken to another city. In Slonim ghetto, they sort of had a hospital. He was...",
        "Q: Not your uncle, but how did the religion message affect you while you were fighting?",
        "A: Okay. Firstly, let's remember what I said to you in the other words.",
        "Q: Let me just ask you one favor. Try not to refer to what you've already told me.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Pretend this is the first time you've told me.",
        "A: Okay, all right. Being the fact that I was in a Soviet underground, for me to think religiously\ncould have been a bad way about it because religion was a no-no in the Soviet system. So\neven in the forest, we had the politicians come back to us when the paratroopers showed up\nand the whole idea of brainwashing restarted again. So for me to think at that time\nreligiously would have been the biggest crime I could have done after to myself, speaking in\nthe first undertone. Now, in my inner sanctum, did I think of religion? I used to look at the\nstars at night. Being around and doing something and seeing the moon shining, and I would\nsometimes say, \"God, can't you do something for me?\" So to answer whether I totally\ndissipated or got away from that, no. That little spark was in me. And I remember when I\nwent out of that ghetto going to the forest, a prayer went up to me. No more like when Jacob\nran away from his brother, Esau. And he sort of tried to make a contract with God. Say, \"If\nyou save me, I will be your servant for all the duration of my life.\" That night, with moon\nand the stars my witnesses, that's what my prayer was. And maybe he listened. But I did\nsurvive, but I didn't survive to fail him; I survived to go on, and I will go on like that. I feel\ncomfortable to bring Jewishness and religion into my house and through my family I have\nbeen a member of a synagogue all through the years being in America, even at times 1t was\nhard financially to do so. So on that question I must say I feel good about it, without asking\nthe questions. To me, it feels the same thing as if a young person gets killed. It's a pain, but\nyou don't keep on brooding on it for all your life. When you're reminded, you feel the pain\nagain. But you try to go with your life without brooding on it all the time. That's the best\nanswer I can give when it comes to the religious during the war and especially after the war.\nI'm happy that there are still Jews in this world who want to go on and live as Jews.",
        "Q: In your writings, you came up with a theme, \"Torn Between Tyrants.\"",
        "A: \"Torn Between Tyrants.\"",
        "Q: What does that mean?",
        "A: In my life as a youngster on through coming to the United States, I stumbled every time on a\ntyrant. Be the tyrannical part of Hitler, be the tyrannical part that I've seen before Hitler\ninvaded Poland that I've seen from the Nationalist Party, be it the time when I used to go to\nschool and rocks was thrown at me by children who lived in the neighborhood. Not because\nI did anything to them, but it was always that one answer, you are a Jew. And it sort of\nbecame a theology, being a Jew means you got to pay in any kind of way. So even rocks\nthrown at you means part of you because it's not thrown at you because you are Harold; it's\nthrown because the Jewish -- you are a Jew. So I cannot help it but go on in the way I'm\ndoing. It looks like it's over. You're ready?",
        "Q: You were talking about how you were always castigated for being a Jew, torn between\ntyrants.",
        "A: This is one part I tried to bring out. I, for instance, always had to challenge a tyrant. To me,\nthe tyrant was when I remember one day during the war when I was with my grandfather\nfrom my mother's side. And it was a debate at that time whether I shouldn't be let go to\nVilna, so in Vilna I could meet up with the American Counsel, I can perhaps go to the\nUnited States. At that particular time, my father would not permit me to go on my own, so he\nsays, \"See if your grandfather, after all, he's got all his children there, if your grandfather will\ntake you to go with him, then you can go. Otherwise, I will not permit it.\" And that was the\ndecision making that we had to take out a passport because the law came out whoever wants\nto stay here in the Soviet Union must obtain a passport. That's the rule of the land. Those\npeople who do not wish to take out passport can return back to Germany which it was sort of\na critical kind of way. And there was some who did not wish to remain under Communist\nregime, and they went and signed up to go back to Germany -- to the occupied Poland under\nGermany. And the fortunate thing that had happened at a later time was an unfortunate thing\nit happened then. The KGB rounded them up by night on trucks and loaded them into trains,\nand to Siberia they went. Those people survived the whole war. Some of them were drafted\nto the army, they were of age. Otherwise, they could join later on into the Polish Army that\nStalin created into. And so a bad thing of yesterday became a good thing for tomorrow, but\nat the time there was a tyrannical thought and a tyrannical thing that I grew up with. And\nwhen I and my grandfather together went 1n to have a passport, the captain and the police\nstarted yelling it \"How come\" -- he didn't ask a question why you didn't come any earlier and\nstuff like that. But in a blistering voice he sort of dared to speak so loud to my grandfather,\nwhich my grandfather still had the beard. He always had the beard long enough to remind\nme of Casimir, The Great, one of the Polish kings that were in existence. And I always used\nto refer to him, in jokingly speaking, which he wouldn't tolerate that, of course. So again,\neven a little 1tem like that over why we were late and I come and making the passport. I\ncouldn't tell him I wanted to escape to go to Vilna maybe wind up in America, that would be\nthe wrong thing. So I saw sort of tyranny in the workings. Afterwards when I decided to be a\ngood boy through school and I volunteered to go to do certain jobs, and I started believing\nthat working make a person better and everything like that, I volunteered to go to work on\nthe factory level. It was near Bialystok where they were building housings for the military at\nthat particular time. I was a frail, in a way of speech, young guy who never did do hard labor\nwork. The hardest thing in labor I did was sawing, chopping wood or sawing that thing for\nthe purpose. Being a Zionist, it used to be a summer type of chore that you wanted to go help\nthem. The money that we were paid we used to put it sort of cooperatively, be able to go to a\nsummer camp where we was practicing Zionist scouting and so on and so forth. But I wasn't\nused to carry a wheelbarrow like, you know, that you had to be the husky kind of guy. And I\nlasted two weeks, and while being there again, I found tyrannical ways. All of a sudden\nwhen all the preaching to me was equality and Socialism, there I found out for the first time\nof my young life that they had rates of pay. One guy for the same work was rated one kind of\na pay. One kind -- the other guy was rated maybe less or more. Now, that was not Socialism,\nthat was not Communism; that was Capitalism. I was smart enough to understand it from my\nschool years when those subjects were taught in school about what Capitalism is and what\nSocialism is. So again, in my own young mind then and even up till today, 1t was sort of a\ntyrannical kind of a way, okay? And each time later with Nazis entering in the same way and\ngoing through the selections, right and left, and being beaten up, and being taken to Slonim\nto jail, and then winding up in a work labor camp until the partisans freed us. All I saw was\ntyranny, and then I finally am the free man and I'm in the forest. I'm already -- every time I\nturn around, I still see anti-Semitism. I still see all kinds, that people are sort of valueless\ninstead of being valuable. You know how hard we thing about today when we hear an\naccident one person dead, a child died, or be from an airplane or anything like that, it makes\nfont page headlines and everything like that. Look how life meant through that era of years,\nbe on the Soviet side, be on the Nazi side, life was meaningless. For a guy to kill somebody\neven in the forest, he did not have to wait for a court martial as it was later years organized\nwhen the paratroopers, and all of a sudden life became -- be a little bit more with a meaning.\nThey couldn't go ahead, just pick the pistol and kill somebody. They had to stand trial. Even\nthe police and Germans that we captured as POWs, they were not just taken out and shot.\nThere was a trial. It was conducted in front of -- at least to make it look like a trial. So again,\ntyranny is in work, so no matter how I put myself together in the picture when I started to\nwrite about it, I though the best title for it would be \"Torn Between Tyrants.\" I remember\none time, it entered my mind -- and as a matter of fact, I even wrote a poem naming it like\nthis here -- \"Memories That Linger On.\" But I did not find that to be strong enough to\ndescribe my living at a time and all I went through to be just memories that linger on.\nEverybody has memories lingered on. But \"Torn Between Tyrants\" stood up to me because\nreally that's what I was telling in my story, and I am telling it today the same way.",
        "Q: Do you think that that's still the way of life?",
        "A: It justifies me of the past; however, I divorced myself of the tyrannical seeing and feeling\nunless I talk about the Ku Klux Klan, and I find that even in a free society as we live in the\nUnited States, that in order for us to be free, we must tolerate even the people who are not\nworthy to be tolerated, but that is really our freedom. Therefore, therefore, I am not faced\nwith a tyrannical way unless I think, just think of the story with Skokie when the Nazis\nwanted to come and march. In part, listening and seeing that people have still this kind of gut\nfeeling in them to do to prove that Hitler was right is tyranny to me. Because again as I say,\nwhere is man to understand man? If I'm right, I'm right; and if I'm wrong, at least point me\nout where I'm wrong. You cannot always live by the lying propaganda about it. So \"Torn\nBetween Tyrants\" is not any longer a part of my life, but 1t was definitely a part of me and\npart of my life between the late '30s until liberation came and then after until maybe until I\nfelt differently when I came to the United States.",
        "Q: Let's talk about the partisans. For Jewish people who went to fight with the partisans, was\nthere a different commitment and a different situation than for the Soviet partisans? Different\nresponsibilities, different. . .",
        "A: Let me bring in a little story over here. We know for a fact that on many occasions that it\nhappened. That Hitler tried to use the partisans in focus among Jews, so what they did on a\nfew occasions send Jews to go. And they wired them, like I said -- not wire them as we\nunderstand it of today. With certain criteria, they supplied them where to go and they'll take\nyou in. And your job will be to remember some of the things and come back, as their\nlocation, what are they involved, how much ammunition do they have, and so on. And I\ncannot attest to this moment that it was anti-Semitism because I was not there listening to the\ntrial or anything like that. But the fact stands out that there were on a few occasions the Jews\nmet their death, they didn't believe that they did in order to save their lives and were willing\nto give the cooperation of the Germans. And they probably did it with the hope that they will\nbe understood, so their argument was then why didn't they come clean originally to say,\n\"Look, I've been sent here by the Germans. I am to do this and that and the other. However,\nthat was my best way of escaping or coming.\" So argumentive, who knows? Maybe the\nperson listening to their testimony at the time was not seeing the world this, he only saw to\nkill Jew is no crime. So yes, it did happen in many kind of ways. And Jews, even when I\nescaped and I came to the forest, it was not as easily as a guy from the local areas who did\nnot want to go to Germany for labor or who did not want to be inducted in the German Army\nwhich they made all of those openings for them. Although they had them in separate corps,\nyou know what I mean, serving. When they came and they escaped and they told their\nreason, 1t was on his home turf, remember. He probably was not from many miles away, he\nwas from the area. And it was very easy, it wasn't a question will they accept him; it was a\nquestion only where is he going to be placed? Is he going to be placed in our battalion or in\nanother battalion, whatever it is? But he had an easy home, much easier than fleeing. Now,\nthe only time I could say that it wasn't a problem was after the massacre in Germany, in\nChita. After the massacre, for instance -- or before that massacre in Bentschen. When the\nJews came, it was another story. There was, however, a fact that from Chita, one -- the most\nintelligent at the time would have been in our midst, who rose to be an attorney. And he was\nparty, which again to say that's what Hitler tried to do, to annihilate the first thing, then come\nagainst you. If he once he has the brains out, everything will be easy for him to achieve his\ngoal of the final solution. So he, a man came and organized a group, and he came to the\nforest. He's been shot, he did not live in the forest more than days before being killed. And\nagain, what would you say? Was that an act of anti-Semitism? Was it an act of jealousy\nbecause he was intelligent? Take 1t for what it's worth it. I am not familiar for the time\nserving 1n that area as a partisan, that a Gentile person was treated the same way as that\nVoretsky (ph) was, you know, from Chita. That we know a fact, and tell you one more thing.\nWe had a guy by the name of Bo Levine (ph); that was his name. The man had the highest\nmedal, he was responsible for downing more trains in our midst at that time than anybody\nelse. Sure, everybody knew Bo Levine, a blonde guy. There was not much to see that he was,\nyou know, six-foot tall, a husky kind of guy. He was of an average height, you know, five-\nnine, five-ten, stuff like this here. But that man had only one thing in his mind, what the\ntyrannical ways taught him to do. Is to go and seek vengeance. There were cases where we,\nall of us were involved in vengeance-seeking, because there were anti-partisans or anti-\nSoviets, but then in some cases, some went to take vengeance to those that we knew who\ncame into the ghetto and robbed from Jews or anything like this here. Yes, we went to seek\nvengeance, too.",
        "Q: So you're saying that for a Jew to go to the forest and be a partisan was a difficult risk?",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely. He was another story, and I am talking now when you use that word,\n\"partisans,\" I'm talking about if he came and fall into the partisans, that there were Soviet\npartisans. If he came into the National Polish Partisans or in the Ukraine part we called them\nBondarises (ph). These here people were just doing the same job that the Nazis did outside,\nand they were poisoned by the same thing. They were anti-Soviet and they were anti-\nGerman just the same, and Jew what they to. So be that it was the era of the time that\nthe poison of anti-Semitism got so many or be for or any reason to describe, a Jew was not\ntreated to join in the partisans as easily as a non-Jew. So this, for the records, I want to testify\nand make clear, that that was the case.",
        "Q: You started to talk about the fact that you had to kill people. You had to avenge those who\nhad done you or your family wrong. And yet, I see here a very, very sensitive man, and I'm\nwondering what gave you the strength and the toughness to do what you did.",
        "A: I describe in many of the writings that I did before that humanity had to turn to savagery in\norder to survive. Not because that's what their wish. Even in my poems I say the same things\nabout it. It's very hard to describe the person you become. To give you an analogy how we\ntrain to escape in case of a fire from a tall building, and the facts speak that no matter how\nmuch training we do when the real fire happens, people still get confused and they do things\ndifferently than they anticipated. And the bottom line and the final analysis is that the curing\nwas not because of training. It perhaps helped but it wasn't that. The same thing, situations of\nthat nature as in my way when you had to think only positive in order to survive, because\nnegativism would only be a matter of how soon will you be dead. Murder, beating, or\nwhatever it 1s, but how soon will you be dead? So you could not project or map yourself out\na program that this is justifiable or this is not justifiable. And at the times, I don't know if in a\nbad situation what I would turn. When I had testified in Skokie before the Nazis had to\nmarch, and I was at city hall at that particular time in Skokie, they asked me a similar\nquestion. \"Mr. Zissman, what would you do if Collins and his gang come to march on\nSkokie?\" I says, \"I cannot give you a real answer. Am I going to grab a stone, and hit --\nthrow at him? Am I going to maybe to take a bottle, take it with me and throw a whole bottle\nat him? I don't know the outburst that it could project, this is why I'm pleading with you do\nnot let these people march because they will only create certain evil out of people who do not\nintend in a normal way to do that. And this is my best way to analogize or use that metaphor\nto you about it, how could human beings do certain things? I know from facts because of\npolice when we captured them and they told us. Before a massacre or anything like that\nhappened, the Germans, they did not want them to be sober because people under the\ninfluence act totally different -- act totally different as they do when they don't have that\nalcohol. So this is -- again, I'm only using that as a metaphor. People change at times of\nhorror or stuff like this. I was changed, too. And I want to be making this testimony right\nnow. Yes?",
        "Q: So to some extent, you become your enemy?",
        "A: Your enemy or survival. Or survival. I cannot use my own enemy, I can use the word that\nyou do various things to survive, and I would justify that because you have to.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "Q: When you were fighting...",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: ... what do you think was your greatest difficulty?",
        "A: Basically, at first when I was fighting the greatest difficulty was to get involved in killing\nbecause I still to this day do not want to use that method as what we were doing as\nkilling. It was defending. It was self-defense. Even the Bible tells us that if someone that\nif someone rises to kill you, you rightfully have the right to stand up and kill him. So I\nmust make that clear that our way was not that we were coming from a culture to say that\nthat's the only way to do. Our way was everything must be done in order to not let the\nenemy win. Oddly the enemy was instilled in us and in me precisely about it, and I wrote\nit one time talking and interviewing somebody from the camps. And I asked the same\nquestion, did the barbed wire electrified being everywhere in the camps, how come so\nfew threw themselves? I said I know and I heard of cases where people threw themselves\non the wires in order to get it over with from all the sufferings. But that wouldn't that be\ncommon sense to say in a case like that where you gave up life and you know you have\nno escape. So why let the person get the best out of you? Go ahead and get it over with.\nBut the fact remains that life is very dear. That is the reason we stop sometimes to\neulogize one little child who didn't show anything in life, and we eulogize one little\nmurder that it happened and we take it at the same thing. And this always must remain a\nseparation between murder and self-defense. We cannot take it as for granted that a\nperson uses a gun to kill to name him a killer. He sometimes uses a gun to kill to stay\nalive, to defend himself of the other one who 1s trying to kill him.",
        "Q: Do you have any thoughts on why more people didn't fight?",
        "A: Yes. When I first came to the forest and for a while I was very bitter that I did not have a\nlot more followers like myself. And the fact remains of the group that I had organized in\nthe ghetto in Briesen, not a single one after all the talk with it, not one who was on my\ngroup or in my group at that time, which it fell through, survived. Not one. The best fact\nagain is with my uncle, that he came out of hiding, crying and hugging and telling me\nwhy didn't you listen to your Harold? And this is a known fact of life that people at times\ndo not want to listen to righteous person, but then they come eulogizing why didn't we\nlisten? And that was the same bitterness that I had in me for quite a while that I didn't,\neven though seeing the hardship and the facts that the bottom line was that I was\naccepted. Even if it took me three weeks to get there, the bottom line was that the four of\nus, when we came we only found one Jew who I used to feel hurt about calling him a\nJew. The man was assimilated, he had birth already, his parents were no longer Jewish\nand he was not understanding a single word, although the guy who came with me\ncouldn't speak Yiddish either. He learned Yiddish later during the period of time because\nhe was also sort of an assimilated Jew. And I often used to, with the other ones, say, \"I'll\ntell you, when I am here, at least I have a reason. I am Jewish. I don't want to offend\nyou.\" Because I used to talk to him, I says, \"Tell me, what did you know about Jews?\" He\nsays, \"Nothing. To me, a Jew did not stop for one moment to think.\" I did not have a\nguilty feeling that I am not practicing Judaism, you know, so I says, \"This is where my\nhurt feels when I see your hurt, I feel I'm hurting for something. And here I see you're\nhurting for nothing, so I'm probably putting your case above mine, so please never be\nmad for my questions I'm asking you.\" And I still proceed to say more should have\nsacrificed their lives by escaping instead of just justifying the means that there was no\nway out.",
        "Q: I see as still a fighter. Can you talk just for a little bit about the long-term impact that\nyour experiences have had on you?",
        "A: In my mind, if I remember when my son reach the age and he was in college and all of us\nAmericans at the time had the feeling of Vietnam. In our hearts we were almost complete\nminded. My wife used to put me to that question, what would do if Michael is called? It\nwas a bad answer, but I did it. I say, if called to fight, I would let him go and fight. As a\nmother, my wife thought in those years the same as some of them could try with their\nsons to run to Canada. Maybe perhaps if I was a married man when that happened\ninfluenced by someone I loved, or maybe be a father of a child or so, maybe it wouldn't\nbe so easy for me for settle with fighting ideas. So in a way I feel that the picture changes\nwhen you become a father. The picture changes when you think of your son. I remember\nthe first ttme when I was in Israel and I used to look and all the questions that were on\nmy mind before of Jews, that they are not fighting and this and that and the other. And I\nlooked in our family, here my first cousin -- he's married to a young lady that she's a\nmilitary person. She's by now probably a colonel in the army. He works for a defense\nfactory. I took a look at my wife's family, where a father son, both of them, he survived\nas a matter of fact by being in Russia at the time. But coming back when I tried to tell\nhim let's stay together, why do you want to go to Israel? I also wanted to go to Israel, but\nI didn't. And he did not want to listen to me, to one word. And he went to Israel, and it's\ntrue, the family got splintered, you know what I mean, and split up like this here. But I\nknow, and I was very curious to find out at the time -- as we know here, they both were\nfighting under Rabin at the time when they were there. And I asked him, \"How did you\nfeel about it?\" He says if I had to go tomorrow, they call me and they call my son at the\nsame time, I say we are going. There is not such as well, you know mean, I have all of\nthis here. Basically, my own thoughts had I been in Israel, either I would have been dead\nby now. But I would have definitely been in the armed services. At the time in the '40s\nwhen I was supposed to go illegally at that time, I couldn't see myself becoming, you\nknow what I mean, continuing my education. Maybe the time will change, but primarily I\nknow I would have been in field. I would have been -- be that it was the Haganah or the\nat that time or later when it became a regular army, I know. That's what my\nmind changed because of that, sort of that fighting was not any longer a trade of some\nand not for others. But I saw fighting must be a trade of everybody, you must be prepared\nto fight and not prepared just to dwell over books and signs and so on.",
        "Q: You're talking about the spiritual fight as well as physical fight?",
        "A: Correct. Correct. I think it belongs with each other. Maybe in some other nationalities\nwhich I could not have the feeling. I wasn't somebody else, I was me. Maybe it's a\ndifferent situation. Maybe they in some nationalities look at fighting that it's a part of\npatriotism and the guy who didn't fight is not a patriot. I believe it's wrong because not\neverybody can be a fighter, no longer that everybody can be a doctor. Not everybody can\nbe a scientist. Not everybody can be anything else. I say for a person to resort to be able\nto go to fight, I believe it's something in the person himself. I cannot see that he's just\ngoing and lagging because these guys, they are the first one to raise that white flag once\nthey are in the armies. And I could not be thinking that way, but in the Jewish way -- let\nme speak to what I am and what I know. I believe we must retrain our offsprings. It\ncannot be said that a Jewish boy cannot go to learn how to shoot a gun or to go to a\ncourse where guns are being taught how to shoot and where, or the same story of being\nhunting. We always used to have a criteria and a joke that when a Jew became a Gentile\nafter he does everything else he could do with the Gentile in church and everything else.\nBut the story goes after he had to join him when he went hunting, he says that I cannot\ndo. Why do I have to go kill that animal? And as we know, that's a popular thing, and we\nknow for the record if we were start looking around, that few Jews are hunters. But you\nsay Gentile, it's sort of an inborn thing with them that hunting season, they got to go, they\ngot to see that blood and kill that little animal, you know what I mean, or so on or the\nother. Regardless what it is, but that's a whole admission to go duck hunting or to go deer\nhunting and so on. I believe we must learn from history. We are an old, old nation of\nsurvival, but perhaps it's time for us to look into it from a different perspective. That to\nsurvive as we see the religious person with the beard in Israel and with the tefillin on his\nhead, he stays and prays the gun on his arm. We must tolerate it, not look down on it\nbecause that, I believe, is the only way of survival.",
        "Q: To stay vigilant?",
        "A: To stay vigilant and not be different this case than the other nations around. You cannot\ngo by the story of what at that time Esau and Jacob were blessed by their father where he\ntold to Esau, \"You shall live on your sword.\" While he told Jacob to be -- it's good,\nmeaningful things and I believe it doesn't hurt to do both. You can still become a rabbi,\nyou can still become a student of theology. You can become a student what you want.\nBut don't look down that it comes a time that you have to resort to be drafted in the\nservice and you have to go to defend your country. I believe that's the way it should be.\nWe know past doing the Czar, during the other one, that the Jews were no good for\nanything but they drafted them in the service anyway. They were good for meat for the\ncannon, for cannon meat, you know, and so on. And there were, therefore, a lot Jews who\ndid not want to go serve because they couldn't have the kosher foods, you know what I\nmean, served to them and so on. And they would desert a lot of times because it was\nagainst their belief religiously. And in other words, why should I go fight for somebody\nthat when I get through fighting -- the analogy would go again with the black people of\nthe United States. That when they had to go fighting, they couldn't be together with the\nwhite man who was fighting the same enemy. So there are certain changes must come\ntrue in life as it goes on, and the changes is with understanding. So to answer you, I am\nstill a fighter, yes.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you want to add?",
        "A: Well, this part, I believe, you can talk and bring out more Biblical stories or more of the\nother one stories. I used to say that 1f we were to hail after the kingdom of the day of\nDavid, King Solomon, we would have been another people. However, we must\nunderstand that all of that happened when we were a country on own land, and in order to\nbe a country, we had to have a military. We had to have an army. But when we were\ndriven out or taken off our land, so we saw the holiday of poor what it tells us. The story\nwith Mordecai, the story with Esther. Speaking about it, a lot of people see something\nmissing in the while story, that it goes on, and at times they are very despondent. Because\nlook what Mordecai did, he told is niece to go ahead and get married to a non-Jew, which\nit remains questionable to a student who starts learning. That student has to be so much\naccommodating to justify that. For the sake of survival, you do everything. I, for instance,\njustify what Mordecai did. If that were the man that Esther had to go and engage herself\nto become that queen, that through way she could help her people if it meant her to go in\non that thing and become at that moment to get married to a non-Jew and the outcome\nwas that she remains the hero. We don't call it the scroll of Mordecai; we call it the scroll\nof Esther. So the whole story of Esther became. So we can take it and see the difference.\nIf that would have happened in Israel perhaps like the high priest when 1t comes when it\ncome with the story of Hanukkah. He showed, he and his sons were the first ones to rise\nand kill these people who wanted to switch him over to the Greek mythology at that\nparticular time and become of a different belief and the pig and everything like this here.\nBut he was a leader, and he rose, so maybe if something like that would have happened\nby one of the conquerors in Israel, we would have had another story to tell again of\nheroism when it happened. But since it happened outside the realm and the country of\nIsrael, there was only one way to do, is politically. And that's what Mordecai did, he did a\npolitical thing in order to save the Jews at that time of Persia. But it's confusing when you\nstart reading at times and remain Jewish like the question is asked. You can go on on so\nmany various historical facts.",
        "Q: Okay, but I don't -- yeah, but...",
        "A: But it's only going to come to the same conclusion, so if you want to dwell, you'll find it.\nMore and more to what I just am saying or said. And I want to conclude in it in saying in\norder to survive as a nation for the years and years and centuries to come, we see the\nchange and the change was started from Israel. We see the capabilities, no one in the\nworld with modern weaponry had ever created a thing like Entebbe where the whole\nworld was rocked, of how they did stand up and do it. So that's what I am saying, you\nmust stand up, but you must also train. I'm all for the way it is in Israel, but I'm only\nagainst that one thing. That they still give a person who is religious, they give him, in\nother words, a way that he can because of that avoid being drafted in the army. I believe\nthat cannot be done. If that a person is a conscientious objector for killing, let him work\nin a hospital. Let him work someplace where he can create his holy mission, save lives.\nDon't have to go up, that's still a soldier. A soldier who saved the other injured one is still\na soldier. He can still continue with his rabbinical or theological ways of prayer and\neverything like that. But that must be done, we cannot exclude somebody because he is of\nreligious belief that he should not serve in an army. I don't believe in this theory at all,\nand I hope someday this will be changed.",
        "Q: What you're saying is we need a commitment to community?",
        "A: Absolutely. It's community and country, belongs to everybody. It cannot be delegated to\njust some, and the rest of it just to stand and applaud. It's everybody's job and it's\neverybody's duty.",
        "Q: Go ahead and stop tape. What are we up to now?",
        "A: Okay. We're looking at an event that took place where two brothers with the beards are\nwitnessing a marriage to we see the son of the bride and groom. On the top line, you see\nme with a cap on. Next to me is my mother. Next to my mother is my father. Below him,\nthe bearded guy is his father. And at the bottom row where we see children, so you see to\nmy right that's my brother next to me. Next to him with that little bib on him, that's my\nyoungest brother. Now, next to him is a cousin of mine which he belongs to this part of\nthe family. Then the last one to the left if my sister. So there you have the family of all\nfour of us taken on this picture shown at a wedding ceremony that it took place before the\nwar.",
        "Q: Do you remember what year this was and what town?",
        "A: It was in the town of Ostrava. I would approximately say that that had to be in the year no\nlater than 1936, about 1936, you know, at the time.",
        "Q: How many people from that picture survived the war?",
        "A: None of them. I'm the only one who survived of all of these here people. Here you see a\npicture when there were visitors in our family and that young lady who's not seen in this\npicture was a photographer. They came from a city called near Warsaw. And it\nwas our house, the background as you see, where my mother and all the four children are\nthere. My father, of course, is away on business, so he couldn't be in that picture. So as\nyou see, I and my brother are wearing the school uniforms because I attended a parochial\ntype school where a uniform was a part of the attire that we had to wear. So you see on\nthe top, Iam. Below me 1s my brother with a school uniform. Next to me is my youngest\nbrother. Then is my mother, and there is my sister, who actually she was the third in the\nfamily. So this is what this picture is all about.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And, unfortunately, you see I'm smoking a cigarette, which looks like -- got me smoking\nin later years very young, but I'm very happy that I gave up smoking, at least almost 10\nyears. So I'm on a tricycle in my city of , at the age of about three at that\nparticular time. By the way, all these pictures that we are going to be seeing, I didn't\nbring them with me, but I got them in the United States from the family -- from the\nrelatives that they had it here. And that was sort of gift to me about it. This picture was a\nreproductive picture that I did do in Italy after I received the picture from the USA from\nmy aunt with a big picture of the wedding at first. That they reproduced it for me in Italy.",
        "Q: Who is that?",
        "A: That's my father and my mother. The original pictures, I already said, was the first thing\nthat we shot. From that picture, I reproduced all of that. And here is showing my mom\nand dad.",
        "Q: What year?",
        "A: I, again, would say like it was before. That it had to be about 1936. '35 or '36. This\npicture was -- oh, not yet? I'll wait. This picture was done in 1945 when we first came to\nItaly. As you see, I'm wearing the jacket like the Eisenhower army jacket that I was\ndressed in. And at least it proves to me when I look at it today that I was young at once,\neven after all the hostilities that I went through and when I came to Italy. Next to me 1s\nmy wife. And I believe our faces, if you want to be a good judge, will say that a lot of\ngrief is looking from these faces from the past, which it was still haunting on us. And\nthat's the reason you see the seriousness and the grim look on the picture by both of us.",
        "Q: One more.",
        "A: This picture here was taken at approximately in June of 1945, where in my story I told us\nthat we had in the military academy of Modena where we were stationed, it was about\n7,000 refugees which 5,000 of them were ex-inmates from Mauthausen, who were\nbrought in in one day on trucks. And over there in this camp there was mixture of kids\nwho came out of camps, who probably were taken to the camps when they were real\nyoung. And at this time, they were 17 and 16. And it was a tragedy, within a few days\nthese kids went out on the streets of Italy and some of them got infected with VD\ndiseases. And, therefore, while I was working on the administration of the camp, our first\nplea was to all the people who came for us, which it was the Israeli Army stationed with\nthe British together. It was also the U.S. Army soldiers which they were nearby. I don't\nremember the army or which number they were in, but they were with us. So our plea to\nthem was please get these kids out and let them be situated in a separate camp. So here\nwe see in this picture a truck, and we see the image, we see some Israeli soldiers, rather\nnear me where I'm standing -- I'm standing at the side here, and next to me the guy, Vina\n(ph), who's dressed in a sports coat and tie, and then...",
        "Q: You're in the white shirt?",
        "A: Yeah. I'm in the white shirt. Then there is a soldier, an Israeli soldier next. So in basic\ntheory or story, what it is all about, that this was the truck on which one the youngsters\nare loaded on. And there were about a few trucks, maybe a column of 10 or 12 pulling\nout of the camps, taking those youngsters in to a children's camp where there were only\nchildren supervised by trained teachers until they were taken to Israel at a little later time.\nSo here you can see for yourself the first survivors of the Holocaust, be from inmates of\ncamps, be from partisans. Like all these young guys that you see around me are former\npartisans in the forest near the forest where I was coming from in the same way. Tell me\nwhat I'll say. Please forgive me for the former frame, that it was I said on the left side. I'm\nhere on the right side of the picture dressed in the shorts, and my arms clutched. Next to\nme is a partisan. Next to him 1s a partisan. And next to this guy is an Israeli soldier who\nserved with the British Fifth Army, who was the head of the group who came to take the\nkids out of camp to bring them to their own camp. The next one is Vina (ph) is his\nname. He was also a partisan, but he was not in our forest. He was in the\nForest, which it was near Vilna. So on this picture you will find people who were partisan\nfighters, former inmate of concentration camps in the back row. And from distance, we\nsee the truck where on this truck, the children who will be taken to their own camp.",

        "A: (Sonja) Take from left to right, top standing, how do you say it? Standing. My cousin,\nEllen Lauren (ph). You want both names? Okay. My mother, Goldie. My father, Hirsh.\nAnd the middle one is my mother's sister, Visha (ph). And my cousin, Heinda.",
        "Q: Where are they, in the back?",
        "A: Oh, in this. Okay, I wasn't supposed to? Then my cousin, Heinda. And my brother,\n. Then it's me, Sonja right there. And that's my uncle, Laurel (ph). This is my\nbrother, Penhaus (ph). My cousin, Laura. My aunt, Coleen. Her son, Eddie. And my\nbrother, Darren. And this is my brother, Eddie. This is him.",

    "questions": [
        "Q: Before we get into some of the specific battles, I wanted to ask you a few general questions\nabout when you were with the partisans. It seemed like there were a lot of different groups.\nHow coordinated were you all?",
        "Q: You mean, when the Soviets came in?",
        "Q: Prior to that?",
        "Q: This is the AK?",
        "Q: You had contact with them?",
        "Q: What I'm trying to understand is that -- there were different groups that were Soviet\npartisans. Before everything was coordinated through Moscow, was there any order to this?\nWas there any coordination?",
        "Q: While we're on this, well, you might as well tell me how things changed in '43, because this\nseems to be where we're headed.",
        "Q: But that, too, the fact that at this time everything was coordinating through Moscow. You\nwere able to get more and better supplies, and that there was really system, I guess.",
        "Q: Yeah. How did that change the way you operated?",
        "Q: Was this an improvement or a problem?",
        "Q: But it got better?",
        "Q: So what happened next? I know we've these events to talk about, but. . .",
        "Q: But let me just ask you a question. At some point later you joined the Red Army, but this\nwas -- no, you didn't?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. So what do you want to tell me about this next battle?",
        "Q: A couple of questions for clarification. Can you guess at how many partisans would have\nbeen involved in this operation?",
        "Q: So that means these 1,000 or whatever number partisans maybe were broken into companies\nof a hundred...",
        "Q: Okay. And there were men and women fighting?",
        "Q: And...",
        "Q: Were the women treated differently than the men, than the partisans. . .",
        "Q: Were women given as much responsibility or different kinds of responsibilities?",
        "Q: But there were women who were on the front lines fighting?",
        "Q: Well, there's one other thing that confuses me a little bit. When you talk about going into a\ngarrison and you use the word, \"police,\" are you talking about local recruits or Germans?",
        "Q: Change tape.",
        "Q: But you were talking about with...",
        "Q: ... Polish. That's different than within your group.",

        "Q: When did this take place?",
        "Q: I'm getting a little confused.",

        "Q: In the winter of '44?",
        "Q: Let me ask you a question.",
        "Q: Well, this is stx months later or whatever, the Red Army did come in. In those days, can you\n-- if you think back, did six months seem like an eternity, or did it...",
        "Q: How much is left on this tape?",
        "Q: When you use -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but when you use the term, \"militia,\" you're\nalways referring to the local soldiers?",
        "Q: Okay, you're talking about the local police when you say militia?",
        "Q: Okay. Just want to be correct.",
        "Q: I don't know what this noise is.",
        "Q: Walodia, yeah. So I said for this settlement they saw two heroes, Walodia and me. And the\ngreetings they gave me almost made a change in my heart and soul of thinking the way my\nfuture is to go. I went down so low as to say to myself I'm going to farm with Walodia and\nI'm going to forget any longer that I'm a Jew or was a Jew. Because the greeting, the way I\nwas received for the days ensuing, and that always went on a week's time. Each morning I\nwould go ahead with Walodia on his land and it was harvest time, get involved with the\nsame thing he was doing. At night we would go out together like Russian style to have some\ndrinking. And I figured, hey, what the heck, that's the life to live. I'll go back to all that\nsorrow, I thought maybe that's an escape for me. Then comes Friday, Walodia says to me,\n\"Harold, aren't you going to go into Debrecen to see your Jews?\" And that struck me quick\nlike a lightening went through my body, you know. I says what am I thinking about going to\nbecome a non-Jew, and I immediately began to think you can run, but you cannot hide. And\nhis words to me about -- he didn't say, \"Harold, how about going into town and to see our\npartisans,\" because the Jews that he was making reference to were not survivors, they were\npartisans but they were in other companies or groups likely. But they were basically with us\nin the forest. That issue for him saying Jews instead of partisans, it's like gave me a tremor in\nmy body that no, that was not the way to think the way I was thinking those few days. I'm\ngoing to probably become a Gentile and get married and forget about all that. I said to him,\n\"Oh, yes, Walodia. I was thinking to tell you about it, but I did not have the nerve of\ndisrupting all that work that you have on the farm. But, please, whenever time will permit\nyou, I would want to go in to visit.\" And not using that word, \"Jews,\" with out partisan\nfriends, and not using it in singular, but using much rather plural. However, I says, \"Let us\ncross near the Jewish cemetery of Debrecen because I will ask sort of for you to make a stop\nthere.\" Because in that cemetery I had both my grandparents. They still died before, no\nmatter what the tribulations were as I was talking about, so they still were brought to burial\nthere. My father also was buried there. So I sort of, like I say, was all of a sudden another\nperson again. And as we came to the cemetery, needless to say, that I could never see the\nheadstones that were put because the headstones were desecrated by the local area during\nthat year, which they were made to sidewalks and everything else. So my trip was not fully\nin vain because at least I saw that not only were the local, the living destroyed and harassed,\nbut even the dead did not have their peace to remain in peace in the places where they were\nplaced there. I did my share of crying, and all of a sudden, I was not a hero. The killer, the\npartisan that I was, I became the Jew again. Time was not running fast enough for me to\ncome into Debrecen, so I could meet up with some of my former mates that I was together in\nthe group or being in the other group. And I found the girls that I remembered that\nhad rode with us, so they sort of cling together. Nobody returned back into their homes, but\nmuch rather in one's home, the girls were staying. So they were in one home, the three girls\nwere staying together. One of the girls that I remembered when I was with , we sort\nof shared backs because sleeping at night and her husband was the bosky, which I mentioned\nwho had run away at that time from our areas to Mariansk\u00e9, she was there. And then I saw, I\nmet two more, and, of course, they were very happy at, you know what I mean, that I did\ncome. Basically, there were more girls by comparison to say a lot, than the Jews. And then I\nwent to meet up with the Dalchovitz (ph) family, and at the time I already heard that three\ngirls from Debrecen went to Baranovichi and they situated themselves with work over there.\nThey did not want to remain in a smaller town like Briesen was. Be that it was some fear,\nthat's why they cling. The man would stay in one house even if 1t was their house, former\nhouse I mean, or someone else's. But it wasn't like somebody moved in especially like the\nDalchovitz. At that particular time, there were three brothers. So it's understanding that they\nwere in their former home that they reclaimed. But the girls, I found that three of those living\nones were left and they could have, in other words, moved in back to theirs. But they stayed\nin the one house over there. And we did not hear of any bad feelings about it for the\nreturning partisans when they came to Debrecen. A lot of them reclaimed their properties\nwithout even going through the legal process. Be that the Gentiles were fearful of invoking\nthe law on them will hurt their future, or they did it as a gesture of their own, I would not be\nable to at this time to place judgment to tell you one way or the other. Because either way or\nboth of things would have been accurate and assumption. And I told them that I have\nundertaken a job in Baranovichi, and I will look up our girls over there, the three of them,\nsince I know now that they are in Baranovichi, near. So my stay over there was burning\nunder my feet. That whole epithet with Walodia bringing me back out of sort of, I don't want\nto use that word, that was a dream. Because if it was a dream, I must have to call it a bad\ndream. Or facing again the places of murder. Seeing in the middle of the town that for that\nshort little trme the partisans were there, they built a fence around. Painted up in white, and\nsort of put on an insignia to say that here are buried all those killed in the massacre of\nDebrecen. You know, without knowing the amount or whatever it is and that sort of\nremained like a monument place that I believe I last heard of that it was a little bit\nimprovement, more sign for that place. Because as I stated it before in my recordings to say\nthey were afraid to take them out to the big pits that the Russian making because of the fear\nof the partisans. So we saw that the pits filled up with lime on the top, that we whatever we\nare could find Debrecen. But the difference was now that I saw friends and I saw a sign\ntelling who 1s buried underneath there.",

        "Q: Okay. That's what I needed to get clear. It's a little different.",

        "Q: Thank you. One other thing I think we need to go back to before you leave the Soviet Union.\nYou're mentioning a wife. Now, nowhere do I know how you met someone or where you got\nmarried or when. So can we backtrack and you tell me how that wound up?",

    "answers": [
        "A: Talking about 1943, at that particular time, there was a total coordination.",
        "A: I mean, when we had contact with Moscow.",
        "A: But prior to that, there were a lot of groups on their own. Be that they were fighting for the\nsame cause, when I mean the same cause, I mean that there were Soviet partisans. Or at the\nsame time, there were other type of partisans which I had before mentioned. We used to call\nthem \"the white.\" When we talk about Soviets, we always talk about red, so, therefore, the\nwhite Poles, for instance, those were Polish partisans who were against the Soviets, while\nthey also were against the Nazis. And to top it all off, they also were against the Jews.",
        "A: That was the AK, which is called Army Krajowa. In other words, the land army or\nnationalist army, which they were. And they really had, to the best of my knowledge, they\nwere very much supported from London, England. That they were, because Chechovky (ph)\nwas one of them, which it was the former marshal sort of in Poland. And there were people\nwho were -- the Polish, who were saved from the outbreak of war who retreated to England.\nAnd from there they sort of carried on a certain amount of work.",
        "A: Well, we had contact with them, be that we, that we got some of their guys sort of by way of\nsurrounding them and knowing what was going on. It was our job to know who the enemy\nwas. And really who the enemy was, besides the Germans, was a big story to tell about it,\nbecause they had implants in all of these here ways in order for them to know what's going\non. And every once in a while, as I aforementioned in my other chapters, was that we located\nsome prisoners. We found prisoners who sort of came -- we knew there were many POWs\nwho joined the ranks of the partisans that were specific spies, German spies, implants. And\nwe learned how to discover the way they were signified by the Nazis. They would have a\ntatoo maybe underneath the arm just like the Gestapo would have. And some of them, which\nfor hiding purposes, when we started to undress them, we found maps that they were\ncarrying with them. And we knew that a guy who escapes a Prisoner of War Camp is not\nequipped with a map, and he's not equipped with a compass or anything like that because\nthat would have been foolish to think. So that suspicion -- and believe me, we made them\ntalk. The command made them talk, and this is how we knew of the various groups. Before\ngoing too long, I would like to mention at this point here that my wife lost a brother to one of\nthese here AK types you already identified them by their name, or I call them the National\nPolish Partisan Group. But he and another young kid -- they both were of the age of 14, 15,\nand their best job to be invisible at their work is because they were kids. And their job used\nto be more to go, as we call them, to the trains. They would look through main rails, and\nthose kids, they were not so visible -- and plant a mine over there and then go off. And then\nthere would be other explosions. They were caught by this, which it was on the other side of\nNiemen, as we called it. The other side of the river. And they were caught up, and needless\nto say, that they were immediately recognized to be Jews. And for that reason alone, they\nwere killed and shot. Nothing else, you know. So first their being kids. Second, they were\npartisans, maybe the priority would have been Jews -- that they were Jewish, and that's what\nit was. So evidence like this, it was known to us. As I will enter a little bit later, telling you\non one time that we were purposely sent like masqueraded in disguise of the Polish partisans\nbecause our command definitely wanted to implant partisans on the other side of the Niemen\nnear Grodno and we were on a search missions, which I will tell it when I come to this part\nof talking about , yes.",
        "A: It was coordination that a command would meet sometimes together and talk about certain\nwork and plans, if it was planned a coordinated attack. So this guy would be on flanked, and\nthis partisan would use so many men, the other one. So to say that there was coordination,\nyes. But it wasn't the kind of coordination by command and so on. In other words, a staff was\norganized in 1943 before we made full contact with the paratroopers that were sent to us.\nBecause at the same time, which I must tell you, in that same year a little bit later, drops\nfrom planes through the night became visible even in our area, while before it used to be just\nin the big forest. But they would drop to us supplies, and with these supplies came messages,\nand so on in the same way. The supplies were weapons mostly. Not so much that it was of\nfoodstuff or anything like that, but that was -- and later on in '43, we had radio operators with\nus who were in constant contact with Moscow, as well as the other outposts of staff.",
        "A: Well, I touched base in earlier part, but here specifically, for instance, when we're talking\nabout the attack, where we attacked the garrison in Ruda Slaska. This was already an\norganized from all, because the participation was flanked by all the partisans in maybe\nlocated in 30-mile distance -- 30 mile, I mean square mile -- throughout all the forest. But\nvarious groups were brought in, be that they were ambushed, be they were in the fighting,\nand it was a real preplanned because for the first time, we were shown off at that time a\nPanzer truck and we were shown up at that particular time -- that Panzer truck drove in in the\nvicinity nearby. Not exactly. And the first shot was fired from a cannon, which it was\nsomething again hard to believe that we mustered that, but it was done because we heard\noriginally before attack that they built up bunkers. Now, to specify who they are, which is\nfound on the map, that would have been on the main road. The main road we're talking about\nwas a dirt road going through the forest. It was not a real road to the extent of the woods\nroad, what we mean. And it was leading between the between towards Gotha,\nOsweja, and from there you used to go to Lida. So, in other words, it was all dividing the\nforest with that road. And there settlements away from the road, not too far, where farmers\nused to have their farms. And mostly the soil over there was not too good for other than to\ngrow potatoes on. So these farmers, their livelihood came in normal times that they used to\nwork in the forest, be lumberjacks, or so on. In Ruda Slaska, there was also plains where\nthey used to make turpentine and tar, which it was again a derivative from this here pine\ntrees that were growing over there. So that was implied a good way for us to make that we\ncould sort of the forest -- we were all limited for miles and miles away, without roads. That\nwas the main important issue to talk about. There was only one leading road, and that road\nwas in Ruda Slaska. And, as I said preceding this here chapter, while I was speaking of the\nattack that we had on the Russian and that there came back reinstalled a new now garrison in\nthe Russian. At the same time, while we retreated, as I aforementioned, they put up that\ngarrison in Ruda Slaska. Ruda Slaska garrison, while it was serving the area, was basic a\nservice area for the Germans to control the forest. And, therefore, they chose over that to be\nUkrainians, which they were former -- they were with General Lassov (ph), an army who\nturned around, and instead of fighting the Germans, joined the Germans. And the Germans\nmade their darned best to utilize to their advantage General Lassov's (ph) army, so that\ngarrison, while it had I am sure some Germans 1n it too, was basically Ukrainians. Where,\nagain, the Ukrainian language versus the Soviet language 1s sort of similar to each other, so it\nwas -- and we had in our midst a lot of Ukrainians, who were former Soviet fighters, rather\nsoldiers who did not want to retreat or become POWs and remained in the forest. Because, as\nI said, that was a party out of the partisans. So, therefore, it was for the Germans a new kind\nof thing to bring in an enemy who it was harder for us to control, because they knew they\nwere permitted Ukrainian. They didn't necessarily have to speak German while they learned\nalready to speak German. So that became the biggest, sort of in a way, a trap to our existence\nbecause it was too close for comfort. They could, for instance, if they wanted to make an\nattack of artillery on the forest they could have at any given time, you know, attack with\ncertain shells. And you don't know which way or where, but it would have definitely made a\nbig problem to the farmers and to us. So that's when the command decided not to wait what\nis going to be later, but they by all costs, which I mean cost of lives, that we must attack and\nwe must destroy that garrison. First of all, that no other garrison should be planted around,\nsort of in that -- and we organized. Again, it was already the staff, the General's staff, which\nwas controlling and they brought in forces from all kinds and the innovation, like I said, from\nthe artillery. And the Panzer trucks, sort of as to call it, was issued there. It was a hard battle\nfor us for the first time to ensue because supplies of ammunition were hard for us. It was\neither to buy food or to buy horse, that they could supply to us. And no matter how much\nammunition we all carried with us, we never carried enough ammunition to ensue a battle\nthree or four hours. And that's what the battle was, and we succeeded -- only because of that\nartillery fight, we succeeded to drive them out. Meaning, they retreated, so they came back at\na time later and restarted again. But our satisfaction was that we showed the enemy, well,\nyou have no safety ground over here. And from there on, the miserable life ensued until\nliberation. It was the last year, sort of, for us of the war, and we were talking about the year\nright now, let's say, between August of 1943 to about August 1944. But those forests a year\nlater became liberated by the Red Army. So that was the hardest year to survive as a fighting\nor partisans at all in the forest.",
        "A: Yes. And a command.",
        "A: Okay. Before a command of a group, as I said, firstly the names have changed. It was no\nlonger Zychov's (ph) group or Bullock's (ph) group or Fredia Kommunarsk's group. All of\nsudden, there was names, for instance, at that particular time. We started to hear organizing\nof the kids. We started to hear Russian names of heroes. You know what I mean, to be\nnamed, you know what mean? And this is the way it had gone on to a total change that the\nSoviet ties to the all extent that even the name. The other innovation was that all of a sudden,\nit began to get the commissars. And the commissars, as you have probably heard over about\nit, they were political commanders. So while even at a time as we were, we still had to give\nour ears to these political commissars. To hear the stories of Communism and Socialism and\nwhat their aim is and all of that. So this was a big kind of innovation that it's sort of in a way\nunbelievable. How was it going to happen? Yes, it did. In other words, no matter what we\nwere exposed to, we must have been exposed to politicizing the situation in the same way.\nThe second -- the third change was -- I already said the name changed, the command post\nand so on. The third was that from now on, no commander was a commander that he made\nhis own decisions. Any operation, even for instance, the territory was divided from where we\ndraw our supplies and which type of farmers could we come to get supplies from. In other\nwords, sort of not attack our own. So before it was we knew the area, the commander knew,\nfor instance, in these here settlements don't go barter because we got too many of our own\npeople. So we don't even go to ask them not to give food. We would come and take, let's say,\ncattle or whatever it is, and give them a receipt, so that when the Red Army came, you will\nbe paid for it. We knew it's not -- you know what I mean, but that was the way it went on,\nsort of to make it official, other than it used to be saying we robbed the farmers for food.\nWell, too, I don't say you don't because certain times like when the situation was bad, we\nwere blockaded, we couldn't help it; we had to carry things on on our own. But in the most of\nthe cases, the territory was divided that this and this companies go for their needs here and\nthere. And other companies use someplace else, and that's the way it was. When a battle\nneeded to be organized, it was decided in the general staff.",
        "A: As a Jew we feel it improved one thing, that we sort of felt we were not an open prey. That\nthere's more authority; however, individually meeting up as used to call them the\n\"Easterners\" was touching. That's how we used to refer to them. Those who were the\nparatroopers who were thrown down. Jokes still went on. We saw a big change, the\ncame to be used to show off the command of a lieutenant or captain, while\nbefore they used to make them on the collar, you know what I mean the way it was. So we\nsaw anew, different insignias. Different changes. But above all, our fear for anti-Semitism,\nwe felt -- because we had, for instance, in our midst talking about the political commissar,\nCaptain Bavidoff (ph), and he was leading his group which it was strictly a political\ncommissar with printing little newsletters and all of this. And he was Jewish himself, sort of,\nyou know, it's sort of you felt you have somebody who you can depend on. So to put it\ntogether in capsule, anti-Semitism, perhaps, changed to be a little bit less because of that.\nHowever, it still was in there. It was a poison ivy that we couldn't get rid of it, and we\ncouldn't get rid of it as far as identifying many instances. And maybe we were too much in\npain to accuse easily anti-Semites, but it was not just easily. It was many, many subjects that\neither were bold enough to see that it was anti-Semitism.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, the Ruda-Slaska battle, as you see, I capsulized it very small because I don't want to\ntake up. And the next battle will be Cozlo-Chechnya (ph).",
        "A: What do you mean? I personally?",
        "A: No, I never joined the Red Army. No.",
        "A: I was only along with them from the partisans, yes.",
        "A: Okay. Just as Ruda Slaska was a very important thing for us to knock out, and we were freed\nfor about a few months, that they were knocked out. So (a) it was satisfaction. On the other\nside, controlling the other main artery which it was a much better road -- going through it\nwasn't like a forest road -- was Cozlo-Chechnya (ph). The Germans managed that after so\nmany miles apart they sort of build garrisons of controlling certain landmarks to be of their\nown, utilizing the local militia, the local people, which they were in the militia, and few\nGermans. You got to remember the importance of that particular time, the Germans said to\nmake an elite force out of them. Well, their elite force was to killing the Jews in these here\nspecial groups, which they were doing in Byelorussia and Ukraine and killing them on the\nspot. So rounding up Jews to kill from the ghettos or otherwise, that was their elite force.\nThey had everything one could wish for, and they always were told, \"If you don't do that,\nyou're going to be sent to the front lines.\" And the sending to the front lines to face the\nRussian front was a big punishment because, as history told us and we know already with\nMarshal Polis (ph) at that time, which would be the armies which the big rift did happen.\nAnd the Soviet's Army at that particular time was fighting really to the bitter end. There was\nno retreating and no giving up, so if 1t meant one-on-one fights after when it happened and\nthe Germans retreated, it was that. So the Germans did not have that 10 days with Moscow\nthat originally the way in '41, that was their slogan. Within 10 days they'll be in Moscow.\nThey realized that by 1943 how fast only was how fast are they retreating, and they did not\nwant to retreat faster than they were beat out. So the Germans used to keep that to their\nforces. Hey, if you're not going to behave well, you go to the front lines. To the Russian front\nlines. So a lot of the local people were given a choice. If you do not want to be drafted to go\nto the front lines, you have a choice to serve in the militia. So a lot of them who did want\neither escaped and joined the force. So we had another incoming force because of that. And\nthose people became good fighters, because they were fighting for their own local causes. So\nthey built there for, like I said, Ruda Slaska over here. Cozlo-Chechnya, which it was an\nended field say between Slonium and on the way like we were going to Lida, so that was a\nbig post that they built a big garrison. And that garrison was taking care of all of these area.\nThis was a new trick again that our command devised. That while we wanted to attack\nCozlo-Chechnya (ph), we didn't directly come to attack it there, but we went to attack\nanother place. The other place was a big bridge. It was a wooden bridge over the Niemen\nRiver in Melnitsa was the name of that little town nearby. So we sent forces in setting up,\nyou know, places setting up in hiding and I was -- the forces to jump out in case the German\npolice come going there. So we set up ambushes on them, so we came, poured gasoline,\nnaphtha, whatever we could get a hold of, including turpentine on that wooden bridge. And\nwe started to set a fire. We knew that once that bridge is going to go a fire, and that would be\ndropped a tremendous communication on a main road like this here. That the Cozlo-\nChechnya (ph) outpost over there would go, everybody would go out to come there to fight\nthe partisans while putting out the fire at the same time. It worked. No sooner they started to\nrun and that was about 30 miles away. No sooner all their vehicles and we saw them in from\nLida posts. The way they're starting to run towards that bridge that we set a fire, we attacked\nthem. And then easily with a few troops that were left in there, so it was no problem for us to\ntake over. It was one Jew, we used to call him \"The Bearded Moses.\" And he was a short\nman with a beard and he was the most heroic person known in that battle of Cozlo-Chechnya\n(ph). He by that time had killed about 15 policemen, until the 16 policemen from the back\nsaw it. You know what I mean, that what he is there. He ended him and with a single bullet\nkilled sort of our -- The Bearded Moses. And he was well known in the area for his heroism\nand so on. So, as I started to say, we captured; we had a big battle and the Howitzer was the\nsounding of time that we sent out. Which again, it was a new type of cannon, and I was at the\nmoment serving near the Howitzer as the second man. And between all the partisans which\nthey were needed to be -- so two parts. It wasn't a matter that this group, that group, all\npartisans who were on the force were taking place on that battle. And within a few hours, no\nsooner they found out over there, we told their people coming out, they started to go back.\nAs they started to go back, they were engaged in fire with us, because we attacked them. So\nit was not just the garrison itself. They suffered tremendous casualty and they suffered the\nprestige that once more the partisans were able to come and knock out the major post\nconnecting and even threaten. The bridge was burned apart. It took them weeks to have it\nrepaired, so basically our aim, what we wanted, is disrupt German communication and\ndisrupt the going on that they had to bring more forces and use people. So, per se, what we\nshowed the Soviet Union was answered in all ways the way we were doing it. However, this\ntime it was no longer a local job, but was a command coming all the way -- who know,\nmaybe it came even from Moscow. I am not equipped to tell you exactly.",
        "A: I guesstimate that at least it was between 800 to 1,000 partisans. At least, because to cover\njust basically the area even in a thin kind of a way from all command posts. We're talking a\nperimeter of battle that at times lasted for about maybe 10, 15 miles. In other words, they\nwere fighting in one area near the bridge. Then around Cozlo-Chechnya (ph), which it was a\nsmall, little town, but it was quite a garrison established over there. So again, we showed the\nbiggest amount of power as it was previously ever displayed because on direction, we didn't\nuse that much of a force. Ruda Slaska, we didn't use that much of a force.",
        "A: Correct, correct.",
        "A: Were men and women, yes.",
        "A: It stands out to me, one -- Rachel was her name -- and she was with Fania (ph)\nKommunarsk. I mentioned the name to him before. Rumor had it she was his girlfriend, and\nto look at that young lady dressed with a uniform on that horse, it was not so common to our\nera, you know what I mean, to see a young lady in uniform and horseback riding and be\nparticipating 1n battle. So a lot of these here things became more obvious at this time, that the\nfighting by young ladies were justified, you know what I mean, and so on. And they were\nrenowned about it, we knew it. We saw it.",
        "A: Well, they were always a female. That still went on, and in any army, you can understand. A\nfemale had her priorities. Of course, the commander when he wanted a girl, she was his girl.\nYou know what I mean? So call it what you want to, but the feminine wish or ways, or\nwhatever it 1s, was very much visible at a particular time. Even when she was riding on a\nhorse. Even though that she was, you know, a good fighter and so on, it still was, on the\nother hand, that intuition of her feminine.",
        "A: Well, to answer you did we have a commander woman, no. So, obviously, you can\nunderstand to judge from here that it was still a man's world and not a woman's world, or\nequal world. No. However, it was -- in the Russian Army to see women, it was no novelty.\nWe already seen it from '39 when the Soviets came to us. So it was perhaps different than we\nsaw it from the Polish Army from before, but women were in the Soviet Army as an equality\nmarker. So that part talking from a Soviet point of view, if you want to say, it was no\nnovelty. But in the partisans, yes, it was a novelty to see because if I was going to\npercentage-wise in any company, if they could have been one percent, it was already a big\nmarker. You could find, for instance, in our company there maybe were seven or eight\nwomen, and, like I say, the most of them were in the kitchen. Which, you know, where is a\nwoman's place? As sort of saying, it's in the kitchen. And they were utilized in the kitchen.\nYes. Or in a, let's say, as nursing, for instance, in the hospital. So it was as the past was for\nplacing the women in this kind of a ways. You know what I mean, yes.",
        "A: Yes. In the Soviet regular army. But with the partisans, depending on the occasion and\nwhere.",
        "A: Police, whenever we speak, we never referred to Germans. That was local. So being that\nthey used to be called by the Russian name of militia or the German police were organized --\nthe head of the police was a German. Or there were a few much, which it was jobs for the\nGermans who maybe were either injured or deserved the rank. That they were not going to\nthe front lines, so from the front lines, from the hospitals, they were given sort of something\nbetter.",
        "A: But with or without , It was contribution made by the local companies to supply people\nto join these paratroopers right now on that special mission. I was picked to be one basically\nbecause I spoke fluent Polish. Secondly, because I hailed from that area from Poland, and\nwith me was another young man. He was a Nordic, blonde hair, and could be easily\nmasqueraded as a non-Jew, which it happened as we shall tell later. That I was sort of in a\nway almost discovered that I am not what I am supposed to have been because I couldn't\nhide my face and makeup, we didn't use at the time. So the other boy's name which also was\nJewish and he was from my platoon was Polotchik (ph), that's what his name was. And we\nhad local area people join us. One guy who was a graduator of Polish officers\u2019 school,\nSurgay (ph), Surgay Balli (ph). That was his name, he was sort of Polish and white and\nRussian mixed in him, so either way you would call him Polish would be correct. Russian\nwould be again correct. And, of course, he was fluent in his Polish, and here I'm going to\nmake a point. They asked if anybody has pictures from the past to be a sort of identification\nto show when we meet up with this here AK underground or Polish underground, that's sort\nof to prove that we are authentic. So he had a picture in uniform as an officer cadet, and that\nwas while graduating his officers' school. Which in other times, that would give him -- in\nLondon, and is a ticket to be arrested and sent to Siberia. And this time, it served the purpose\nvery well, and he could show it off. So we were four of us from the locals, Surgay (ph) and\nanother guy who was a Polish-speaking white Russian, and I and then it was Polotchik (ph).\nSo the rest eight of them, including the commander of our group, were all easterners, as we\ncall them or referred to them, or paratroopers that were dropped. And they are disguised to\nsay that they joined the Polish Army in protest against the Communists and, therefore,\nthey're willing to give their life to fight with the Polish for the cause, that they are anti-\nCommunist. So it sort of was a supportive kind of thing, and every one of us was made up\nlike the documents, so it was really produced like in legal kind of a manner and way. And\nonce we crossed the Niemen, we started to go on the other side and we made our way up\nsouth, sort of that we knew in certain areas that there were more white Poles that were\noperating by night as partisans. By day, they were doing their regular work be as farmers, or\nwhatever their work took. And from talking and inquiries, we found out to make the contact\nto somebody, and we all, therefore, did not go in. But it was just Surgay -- per se, it used to\nbe Surgay and the commander or two would go in from the easterners, or rather the\nparatroopers. And I or would be in there because it's supportive evidence to carry on\na good conversation in Polish. The Russian at the time would keep quiet because he did not\nspeak Polish. So this 1s the way our contact was made and the groundwork was laid. They\ntook it for all the scripture that we told them that we are coming from around Warsaw and\nwe are trying to establish here a Polish partisan. In other words, that we will be able to help\ncreate because, you know, since there are surrogate partisans so we want to be on our side\nand do our work. And we used to be led from one pool to the other. Transportation was\nprovided by us, horses -- it was horseback riding. And at times, it did entail about a whole\nnight riding on a horseback, just having something covered on the horses. Did not have no\nsaddles or anything like this here, so it was -- when you got off that horse, you walked\naround like in a barrel. You couldn't stretch out, and that was part of it. In our weapons we\nhad at that time we had some automatic and the majority was end-shooters, automatic pistols\nand so on. So we didn't show a lot of weapons we'd ask for, for whatever reason it was. And\non one of these here occasions, 1t must have been maybe the third day and we used to were\ntrained and told that whenever you entered a Polish house, you're going to have to cross\nheart, you have to kneel to say your prayers. You had show the whole rigmarole that it looks\nlike authentic, and you cannot go away. And this is what it was, the Polish system and the\nPolish star, and all of us including myself as much as it hurt me to say some of those words.\nBut for lifesaving idea, you do a lot of things that you ask forgiveness, you know, in your\nheart. But you do it in order to survive and I did it. Again, it was the food eating kind, it's\nthey were serving pork and more pork. And to us, it was a novelty of having this food served\nbecause it was not like that. They went their normal way. And drinking, of course, rum. One\nof these nights we then first had to say our prayer. We sat behind the table, drinking had\nstarted with moonshine and Polish Vodka, you know, that some of it was shown to us. And\nthe host which was sitting across like from me at a table, and he says in Polish, \"\nwhich it means, \"You know what? To me, it looks like he's a Jew.\" I controlled my emotion\nnot to turn colors and quick, Surgay , aS I said Surgay, what you call it, picked up\nthis conversation and says, \"You know, it's funny you should say it,\" he says to him,\n\"because he's a Georgian.\" And the makeup of the Georgian people, which Stalin was one of\nthe Georgian, would be of the dark skin. And a lot of them could be taken, you would take\nfor -- they liked the long sideburns which I did wear long sideburns sometimes. If I would\nhave, it would have been an appropriate image to portray that that's what it was. But here\nwas a fast-acting period that took place, and he took over and I did not want to get in\ninvolved with talking. Basically, trembling inside as to what it is, so 1t went away smooth\nand the evening was ended. However, when our evening had ended and Polotchik, my other\nguy, was on patrol, because every time we entered a house there two guys on the outside on\npatrol watching because no matter how safe they told us to feel, we never knew this surprise\nthat it might ensue or might happen. So afterwards when we get together, I says look, this\nand this happened. And I believe you ought to know about it, and that's why I'm telling you. I\ndon't tell you from this moment on, neither I will not enter a house at all. However, you must\nbe with me for our own safety, because if we become a danger to our mission, what we're\nabout to do, remember they'll kill us both. So there will be nobody to say that it was wrong.\nSo accidents do happen, you know what I mean, and that could be that. So it was honestly an\nawakening and vice-versa because now on, it was guard each other. The reason I'm telling\nyou that that this is how anti-Semitism was penetrating, as I mentioned a few times before,\nthat in your own, no matter how safe you wanted to feel, you did not have that safety feeling\nthat you do not have to watch. Because we know from experience of how many Jews were\nkilled, which how do you describe it, that it was not an accident? You have to have the proof\nto prove it, and there was no one to question this.",
        "A: Polotchik.",
        "A: Yes, but I was talking to him one-on-one at this particular time, and he understood it and he\njoined with me. And from there on until the end of that mission ended, which we were\ntraveling around and we were already nearing the area in the forest near Grodno. But the fact\nremains that while our command suspected that the Polish partisans and the National Polish\npartisans where a resistance became very understandable to us, and they are visible. And\nthey had an easier way of operating because they did not have -- you know, the Germans did\nnot know who, what and where. For as long as the population didn't tell about you, bring you\nup, you were operating safe. So they could be where they are, do what they want to, and\nmanage to stay away, not to be -- maybe there are people Poland in the militia. It could be\npossible, I don't -- I don't doubt that a bit, but since I don't know the facts exactly, I don't\nwish to dwell on it too much. Until finally our mission ended, it was about 10 days.",
        "A: As easily I talk about it after that, that it ensued and happened at that time, I hope you get my\nunderstanding. That every minute of the day was a hard minute to pass because we were\nreally watching ourselves against two enemies. You never know did the Polish really take us\nfor granted or didn't they? And again, let's not forget the Germans.",
        "A: The 10 days of agony really is not worthy enough a word to use as I said describing our\nordeal what we had go through. Being dressed in a Polish uniform, acting something that we\nare not, and all that rigmarole going through with it, prayers. Not I nor the Gentiles in our\ngroup were praying type of people in those days at all. Especially being from the Soviet side.\nSo all this here was -- I don't know to say what it was the worst part of it. But one thing\nwhich I did not say it, and I want to tell it. I disclosed the situation to the commander of our\ngroup. In another word way, I spoke to Polotchik. I says, \"You know,\" I didn't want to use\nbecause of it, \"I don't mind it to stay outside any time that we go into a house or anything\nlike this here. In other words, to be on patrol.\" And that was a well-taken word because this\nis the worst you can ask for, to be on patrol. In case of trouble, you're the first one to die. So\nthey didn't mind it, and especially these guys inside, it will be a drink and so on. And I did\nnot mind it at all to forsake it. And our mission, as Polish partisans, was nearing and we\npolitely took our uniforms off, burned them so there should be no recognition or anything\nlike that whatsoever. And now, we ensued to find a new place, to find is there any partisans\nat all in the area. We ran up on a place in the forest, what they called it ;\nwhich it means \"The Holy Mud\" place which it was, it was almost. And while going through\nthis forest and speaking to a Polish person from the area, he was the one speaking that telling\nus as a farmer that there are partisans in that area. And what we ran up against was a family\ncamp, but they, as a matter of fact, explained us that regular partisans as many times as they\nstarted to act over here, but in a short time later, they sort of get lost, and they don't know the\noutcome. Be that they got killed, be that they moved to other forests, or whatever it is. But\nseeing they were using that as a hiding place, they were very cautious and careful to have us\ncome in over there. We needed a guide at that particular time to know the area, and we found\ntwo of the Jewish people over there who knew the area exactly well. And they did not mind\nto become our guides and be with us for the period that we were. Our mission was at that\ntime, once we turned back in as Soviet partisans, to show the Germans that there are\npartisans over here. And how could we show it to the Germans or see what kind of reaction\ncomes from them? We went downing a telephone in a few places that we had to cut on the\nposts, just cut the wires and so on. And at one time, we used a new system that we tried. We\nhad already the plastic explosives where we would take and wrap it around so no longer did\nwe have to use a saw to cut it down. But we would wrap around this here and put in a\ncapsule, and from distance turn on -- from distance, turn it on and by one shot, the whole\npost, the telephone post, would blow up in the air. And devise to make it was disrupted, so to\nus, it was sort of like a fiasco, something we never experienced before 1n an action. And\nthat's why it was progress that we have seen in a different way of doing those things.\nBecause you could set it off very easily, in a few minutes. Just to wrap around, around the\ntree, you know, with a piece the explosive and blow up, in other words, a telephone like this\nhere. So that was our mission at that time and we did accomplish. We also had a train to go\nby rails that we where to explode some rail, train about it to do. So that was the three things\nthat we were involved in doing: Cutting down the telephone poles, disrupting\ncommunication, also burned down a bridge which it was a connecting small bridge in a side\nroad and -- which it was leading to a city. And also, blow up some rail, which it was -- when\nI think about blowing up the rail, when I think about it, I still shudder. Because we came to\nthat mission, and we really the night before did a lot of drinking. And while the drinking\ndidn't bother me in most cases, at this time -- but all of a sudden, while they used at that\nparticular time, they used to call it a shuntle. This was the rod to clean out your rifles with,\nand we had to put it in that fender ring so that would serve for the right train, and the train\nwould go by as to be able to go ahead to touch it and make an explosion.",
        "A: Yes. As I started to tell you, with my long coat, we were wearing army coats, which they\nwere long coats at that time. We really dressed back -- dressed back in army uniforms of the\nRussian Army, so this sort of did not have them with us, but we got them. And I'll tell you\nwhen. How they got them, I don't even know to tell you. But we got them and we were\nchanged over as Russian soldiers. Not fully, but almost. And all of a sudden, I saw that I\nattached the piece of steel or rather wire, that it was in between that ring which that was the\none to trigger it for an explosion. I saw it there, and I don't know -- I didn't know what to say.\nShould we run or whatever we should do, some kind of a motion, because -- and calmly we\nwent away. Looks like all the other Jew, there were three of us over there. The other two had\nseen it at the same time, and we retreated and we went away. Now, we did it like we used to\nbefore in other places. We retreated about maybe a half a mile away into the forest, and we\nwere waiting for a passing train. Whenever, we did not have a schedule, and the trains in\nthose years did not run on schedule either. Because military trains had priority and the other\npriority, which I know it now and I did not know it then, was trains carrying Jews to the\ncamps. They were the priority number one almost like the army trains at that particular time.\nSo -- and we heard a train in about an hour later, and we were just retreating waiting because\nwe wanted to know the damage. On the other hand, we couldn't even find out where the\ndamage was. So we heard an explosion, so we scored our three-way things that we had. We\nhad a bridge blown up, we did that. We had the train which we had accomplished that. The\ndamage what it was, we did not even wait, we retreated from there immediately upon the\nexplosion towards the forest because we were not too well familiar with the area. But we had\na map of the local area that we obtained, and military map which we knew whereabouts we\nhave to aim because we did not accept to go ahead to ask people our ways around, because\nwe couldn't trust anybody. So all in all, we found out that we knew about this group of\npeople who were in hiding which was like a family camp. Special partisans, we didn't make\ncontact with any of them. And we started through a different route now to go back to our\nbases on the other side of the Niemen. We decided at this time to go in our way without\nhorseback riding as we were going this way, so we knew it's going to be a long haul to it.\nAnd it took us -- well, it took us 10 days to go to the mission, we didn't see it. It took us two\nweeks until we finally came to the Niemen River near our area, and we had to get somebody\nwith a little boat and a gun that we met, a farmer. We had a little boat that he had, a canoe\nmore or less, to get us across on the other side. Seeing that there were 12, it was impossible\nfor all of us to go in. So we spread out like a few guy with machine guns around both sides in\ncase of attack, and once we landed on the other side, we were doing -- the same group was\ndoing for the others. To take cover until we were all on the other side. There we were on our\nown terms, we knew our ways around, and we finally came to our place where camp was set\nbefore. And our camp was still there because we were prepared that, who know, maybe we\ndid not have no telephones or any communications to know what animals. But it so\nhappened that everything was in place . And of course, our commander did his\nreporting and we were returning at this time back to our former group. A new group was\nformed and we were in it. This was the time really that I was named commandeer before\ncommander -- platoon commander before that mission. But now I was assigned a platoon,\nand I was commanding that, and we were right now working, not with the former group of\npartisans. But we were working right now with the paratroopers. And a new mission had\nstarted to ensue which it was taking -- it took us a few months to get all the equipment\ntogether. Like rubber boats were thrown down to us. Not boats, but, you know, the ones that\nare blown in the air and you can go which the army was using. And we prepared a new\nmission to be established which it looked almost like a front line break-through. Do you have\nthis on the tape? How far?\nVideographer: We're at 24 minutes.",
        "A: The new mission to be was a break-through. But right now, it was a unified command to that\nnew mission. It was the command from General Castankovich (ph) that was leading it, but\nour general staff was also involved. And there was more than 1,200 partisans got together\nnear the Niemen River, and at this time we were not looking or worried about who will\ndisrupt us. For the first time as we used to do our missions at night, this mission was done in\nbroad daylight. And as we came and we started on the Niemen to set up this here little\npontoon, sort of like. And our five guys to go through across, and it was set up right away\nalongside that perimeter at that time to be ready for attack. All we were wondering where the\npolice or where are the Polish partisans we already knew were in that area. The amount of so\nmuch armor that we had and the amount of so many people all gathered at one time on both\nsides of the Niemen River as it happened, because we went through. It would have taken us\ntoo long to get through all of it in one spot, so in various perimeters, we used so many people\nto get across the other side of the Niemen.",
        "A: Okay. We were crossing at this particular time, I with my group at that time were crossing\nnear the City Lida. And Lida is very -- I would say, kilometer-wise at that particular time, it\nmust have been maybe 30 or 40 kilometers, no more, to Lida that the crossing was taking\nplace. And as we came on the other side, we were given horses and wagons, which they\nwere confiscated from farmers and we were going just like a regular army would go. Some\nof them, we would be walking, but when we were walking, we were not marching scattered\nout. We were walking in a four across, but it was not next to each other. We were walking so\nmuch between each other that if we had to drop, take a position military style, that we were\nable to do that.",
        "A: They wanted to show a big force. While previous times they did not want to show -- you go\na group of 12, a group of 20, the biggest missions in the partisans were achieved with small\ngroups unless an attack on a garrison. So right now they wanted -- you know, people\nexaggerate. When they see 1,200, I'm sure that the word got around that it was probably a\nforce of 2,000 to maybe 3,000. It's a usual way people repeat something like that, it looks\nbigger. And the command by all price, wanted at that particular time to show a big force.\nAnd we were going and we were not stopped or disrupted in any way while we were going\nat that time through forests. We didn't go through -- but the newest we had guys on horses to\nspot in settlements, to find out the reaction, what people are talking about it. And they were\nfilling us in that the militia was fleeing small garrisons or small militia places, because to\nthem it looked like a breakthrough from the front line, and it looks like they landed over\nhere. In Bialystok, at that particular time -- Bialystok is a big city and 1t was maybe 120, 150\nkilometers away. They were on ready massed two full divisions equipped to go to the front\nlines, and they took these few divisions and threw it at us. So we did not even have enough\ntime to get situated in the area. Which it was on day three, all of a sudden, airplanes above\nand what the airplanes did, the bombs -- was gasoline bombs. So the forest became on fire.\nSomething that 1t was never done before. (A) The Germans never bombed the forest with\nairplanes; second, with this type of gasoline bombs. So these gasoline bombs made so much\npanic that we did not know -- it didn't matter whether on a compass or the map, which way\nyou're going. Because you went to the right, you see more forests on fire. And with all of this\nhere, by the time that day was over, we were an army demolished in a way. Not from killing,\nbut in small groups. And any of the light armaments like we had the light artillery pieces\nwere all left and mined and a new retreat back started in a new fashion in small groups.\nEnd of tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: This I remember quite well because it was in December because coming back we know the\nice on the Niemen River, there were floating pieces of ice. And I know the time because\nChristmastime is a visible part, that I remember because it was a big, important thing to\nremember. But a big disaster happened to us at that time. I do not want to omit a very\nimportant story personally that I ensued on that day before the total retreat had started. I was\nlaid out with my platoon in front line. And when I say, \"platoon,\" I'm talking about 20-\nsomething guys. And all we had was two live machine guns. The one on the tripod with a\nround base was one of them. And the other one was a similar one. In other words, we had 10\nshooter rifles. All of a sudden, we heard the roar of tanks. So the roar of tanks, all of that had\nhappened before the airplanes showed up on the scene. I jumped a little bit the gun before.\nWhen I heard the roar of tanks, I sent one of my guys to tell to the commander of his that it's\nnoticeable, the tanks, and what have I got -- what kind of change of command, let's say, new\nposition. Because I told him I don't even have in my platoon one entire armored gun to shoot\nthem. So what with rifles, how am I going to shoot against them? And as they became closer,\nI decided to retreat on my own way without a command, and I went to the commander and\ntold him, I says, \"Look, there is infantry walking alongside the tanks, and there 1s at least\nvisible from distance, I had someone climb up on a tree, and they saw at least six tanks. \"\nBecause how far can you see, you know what I mean without field glasses or so on. So I\nsays, \"I know you probably did not have a chance so I retreated.\" He says, \"How dare you to\nretreat; we didn't tell you.\" I says, \"Do you think we're going to be able fight against this\nforce? With this, you don't have a chance.\" It didn't take another minute or two while we\nwere talking, a guy running come in and says, \"We are all ordered not to open fire, but we'll\nretreat. We'll retreat in a position like we came to the force away from where we were laid up\nalongside that road.\" And as soon nightfall came, my commander brought me into the high\ncommand to stand trail. I almost thought I am going to be shot. How dare was I to take and\nretreat my platoon on my own? My thing was since I had no ammunition, which it was a\nfact, to even attack a tank, why was I to disclose our position? We would wind up we would\nhave suffered a lot of casualties. It looks like command saw my plea much better than my\nimmediate commander from the company, and was case dismissed. But I was afraid that that\nwas curtains for me at that particular time because I did 1t on my own. As it turned out to be\nlater, I was allowed, of course, that I made a good decision by retreating my platoon to them.\nSeeing that the command would have come to me anyhow a few minutes later. So then after\nthe airplanes showed on the scene, which it was closer to the afternoon already, and so far\nthey did not start shooting directly. But all of a sudden, it burst out cannon shooting, which\nprobably it was from the tanks approaching. Although we, by that time, were retreated from\nthe area because that looked like the whole forest was going along the main road and the\nmain road going, I mean, going through the forest. Not a regular road to outside. And the\nroads in the forest were dirt roads as we can best way express it. But their tanks, you see,\ncould go through these roads. And wherever they stepped on trees, they stepped on trees.\nThey made their own roads out. That night the command told us that we are not going to\nensue fighting. We are going to retreat back to our base. We do not want to go 1n groups of\nmore than 10 because groups more than 10 will require too much exposure. And we were to\nmarch only by night, and if anyone is caught or whatever it is, it's -- you know what I mean,\nyou're just running. Cannot tell them our mission or anything like that. However, we were all\nasked that each one of us carry at this time more ammunition. So each of them were loaded\nup with more ammunition on ourselves. We walked and we came there, all right? And only\nthing was in favor was that it wasn't snowing at that time. It was just cold, but it wasn't\nsnowing. And food became a problem because as we went through the forest, we found\nblueberries or anything, we couldn't go ahead to have the luxury to stop at farmers until\nfinally a few days later and closer to our areas, that's when we began to go eat. When we\ncame near the Niemen, and our group to go across which it was -- I was 10 men or 12. I\nbelieve it was about 12 men with me. And there was another group divided for not so many.\nEach that we were walking away from each other, but not too far a distance that we couldn't\ncontact with each other. In case a fight ensues, that we could depend on the other one to help\nus. Either flank them or they would flank us. And when we came to the Niemen, we heard\nshots coming from all sides which later on, we discovered it was our own guys who were\npatrolling that area of the edge of the forest near the Niemen that they did not know what's\ngoing on. And they thought sort of maybe the Poles, the AK, are trying to come on this side.\nBecause they didn't look like an army, and, therefore, they fired the shots. A few casualties\nwere done, nothing is done to my platoon but some of the others. And the order was we\ngrabbed horses at that time from farmers, and anybody who was carrying a machine gun was\nallowed to sit on a horse. Alongside the horse, some other guys were swimming along,\nbecause pieces of ice were floating on that river. And by the time I came over on the other\nside of the Niemen, I managed one thing to do, not to stop. It became so the whole uniform\nthat I was dressed in, I became like a walking mountain of ice. But I was aware of myself, I\nkept sort of seeing that I'm alive and keep walking as well as I could until finally reached the\nfirst farmhouse. When I came into the first farmhouse, I found plenty more partisans who did\nprobably like myself. The woman of the house availed herself tremendously, and in that area\npeople used to have ovens which served them in their houses. That oven was cooking, for\nbaking as well as for heat. And on top, there was a place even to climb up and to sleep there.\nAnd since I had to get undressed, she gave me a change of something and put my clothing to\ndry out. There was moonshine there to drink, so we had a good drink. And on top of that\nstove, I climbed on. I fell asleep, needless to say, and by later on by morning -- that was the\nwooded area, so we didn't worry about because we knew it was clear because it was clear as\nfar as Germans were concerned, the police. And we started to make our way back to camp,\nwhere it was. So that was from a happy occasion as we marched as soldiers and brave guys\nto make it believe that it was a breakthrough, all of a sudden, for Christmas it was our dire\nmoment that we did not succeed. However, command did not stop with their idea. What they\ndid at this time instead of sending a big group and an army like they did, we were moving in\nthe same amount of people while we were retreating. In small groups, no bigger companies\nthan 20 people at one time were ordered where in a direction to meet in the forests around\nGrodno. And within, I would say, maybe two weeks to three weeks, we had a brand new\nforce organized in the forests over there. The front line -- by that time, I'm talking about in\nJanuary of 1944 -- the front lines began to become visible. That the Byelorussian, that they\nwere almost at the beginning in January of '44, that the army were entering 1n certain spots in\nthe Ukraine and in the forest. And we did not realize that within six, seven months, the army\nwill be here. We thought all along that maybe once the army becomes near, we would sort of\nbe discharged. But that was not Russia's idea or the Soviets saying -- we were at that\nparticular time pushed to go closer to Grodno. They had already their assignment. I\nremember vividly that the night before when I went to place a mine on the road -- at that\nparticular time we used a lot mines. We, you know, even used mines to put on the road\nbecause the retreating soldiers by the Soviet Army, we did not think that the Red Army is\nclose by. And I believe that that blowup of that mine, that 1t exploded on a truck that we\nfound out the next day was already that the Red Army is reaching. I jumped right now -- at\nleast about eight, nine months. In the area where my wife was and the area from originally I\nwas with the partisans, they came out of the forests about July, early August. I, as I said, still\nwe were involved with all of this here things, did not get discharged out of that until\nsometime in September. And a new mission was awaiting for me to get started because\nimmediately it was for 10 days that we were -- that the army was fighting the battle. On one\nside, the Soviets. And the other side, the Germans. A lot of Germans were left behind for\npurposes. They had the high churches as usual in the north. And on top of these churches,\nthey found them -- they placed themselves with glasses and they were able to tell the other\nside where the artillery is located to how we are to load firing. And their accuracy was\nbeyond belief. On the third round, they knocked the battery out. To the right, to the left, the\nturbine was in the center and your battery is all to pieces like .",
        "A: You're get confused?",
        "A: We are right now at a new area of the forest from where we started with the paratroopers.",
        "A: In the winter of -- we are talking in January, February of '44. And I said God only would\nhave known that about six, seven months later the Red Army would already come in.",
        "A: Go right ahead.",
        "A: Six months, definitely an eternity. There is no ifs about it. Every day was long, but the closer\nthe front lines became reaching, the closer we used to see Soviet airplanes in the air flying\nthrough because we used to begin to see them now flying through our missions to bomb or\nso on. It sort of put in a new hole in life. It was still being possible to believe that really the\nfront lines are coming closer to us and the Soviets are returning. It was only like everybody\nhad one prayer, that we would live to see that. Because a new way had started in all this\nforce over there. While we were a way closer to Grodno, as I said, in small groups that we\nwere asked to come to this end. We must have had a force of about 800 partisans over there\nin various places. The old territory from where we descended sort of from, right now began\nto fill up with retreating Germans. And the partisans had suffered more casualties in this here\nlast month of the war as they did in two and a half years prior to that. Because first of all, the\narmy was afraid to retreat by the regular open road, so they used the forest. When they were\ngoing through the forest, there was no holy places for them as special by any army. And they\nhad their equipment, and, of course, the partisans could not help it. If they ensued in a little\nfight, the Germans did not stop with a fight because to them regrouping and retreating was\nmore important. So maybe a fight would ensue, they would look the opening where they\ncould do the best and get out. So that gave the partisans sort of another way of running away.\nBut there was nowhere to hide and nowhere to run to escape. And the biggest amount, my\nbest friends that I was to through the years were killed in the last -- in these here ensuing\nbattles of that time. I came out -- as a matter of fact, not to jump it. When the Red Army\nneared our places, one of the companies -- when the commander came, I was assigned at that\ntime to be in the other staff. And he came to telling the staff that the Red Army came and\ntook away his men. They need to refuse, where he in all kind of language stated to me, \"Who\nis your commander? Am I your commander? Am I the staff, or the guy in the Red Army?\nWhat right did you have?\" And he used them -- all the language to them, \"I don't care how\nyou get your men back. If they have to desert, let them desert. I want you to go and get your\nmen back.\" To his dismay, he couldn't keep up -- find his men. And this is a whole chaos at\nthat time existed, and until we finally came out on the outside after the 10 days' battle that\nhad ensued around the Niemen until the Russians break through. And after the encirclement,\nlike I said, you see, we were asked to come outside. What the partisans at that particular time\nwere asked to do was to keep going over on the streets and keep a vigil on the streets. At that\nparticular time we weren't -- did not have yet the order. As soon we found Germans hiding or\nanything and they surrendered, we didn't obey by the law. We would take them out in the\nfield and kill them. Of course, and take the ammunition away from them. So no sooner, a\nfew days all of that went on, there was an order issued that the partisans are no longer to kill\nthe Germans who are surrendering, because it's against the law. It was bring them -- and a\ncamp was started with POWs. It was sort of a defeating purpose to us, that command, but we\nhad to obey the order. And immediately the Soviets started to -- at that particular time, they\nwere probably in the front levels maybe two, three days. But they already had the\nadministration mapped out to what offices each building would be located. And before long,\nthey started taking to service the local population. The population was ordered that anybody\nbetween the ages of 21 to 55 is to register in an induction center to go back into service. The\nlocal population, which I'm speaking of at that place in Grodno, were Polish. That was not a\npart of Byelorussia, that was part of Poland. And that's the last thing that was on their mind is\nto be going, riding out to be taken to go do soldiering for the Soviet Union. The hate still was\nimbedded in them, so it was embedded all the way, you couldn't help it. So my new\nassignment was that I had to form a new platoon because a lot of them already went out in\nthe open and got jobs as accountants or whatever it is in the civilian life, and they were\ndischarged from this staff, which it was also in one of the buildings inside Grodno. For my\nluck, I did it. Firstly, I had a big dilemma with myself. I could not face the outside. To me,\nthe outside was atrocious. It was fearful. And second of all, I was afraid once I go out, they're\ntaking away my gun. To me, the gun was my life; 1t was my protection. It was everything I\nwanted, that's how I was. So one of the guys would come to me that he was a ;\ntoo. He was an accountant by trade. And he says, \"Herr, what is the matter with you?\" It was\nhard for me to describe -- was his name. He wrote a book in Yiddish. To the\nbest of knowledge, it was never translated. He wrote about me. The book in Yiddish title 1s\n\"The Participation of the Jews in the Soviet Underground.\" And he generalized that in\ntelling. He didn't stop on particular issues, but he generalized it to tell about the whole scope\nand all the various partisans that existed and to prove the Jews were participating in it. So he\ncame out, 1t makes sense, he was an accountant. He says, \"Herr, I understand you're going to\ncome out, too. Why don't you go and get a job?\" I went to my commander at that particular\ntime after that, and he says to me, \"Where do you think I'm going to send you? I'm going to\nsend you to the militia to go for a job? You stay here. I'll tell you when you're going to be\ndischarged.\" And I remained there. The next day we had a call from a colonel, a local\ncolonel, who needed soldiers. He did not have enough of the regular army. Whenever they\ndidn't have enough soldiers, they turned to the partisans at this particular time to go ahead\nand supply. So I got an order to send somebody for patrol to watch that colonel. I literally\nsent them 10 men, and every man that I sent came back. No, it was a general, excuse me.\nThat the general would not accept them as to be. And all they had to do 1s patrol the house. I\nbecame flabbergasted until I decided that I'm going to be the one and with the permission of\nmy commander, he allowed me, that I'm going to go on duty and serve it. I came in ina\nmilitary form, saluted to him, told him my rank, what I am. He was Jewish, a Semite. And\nafter, he says to me, \"Sit down.\" I sat down, and the biggest thing what had happened to me\nthat I did not expect to hear a Soviet General to say shalom. He said some Jewish. He says,\n\"Who did you send me? What kind of soldiers?\" I said, \"They're not soldiers. They were\npartisans. They were not trained soldiers. They were not inducted in the army.\" And they\nwere -- so they came and told him when they came on duty, he gave them up-and-down\nlook. \"Hey, come on. I don't need no farmer here.\" So he says, \"You see, you came like a\nsoldier. You saluted, you told your rank. I take you like a regular man in the army.\" So I told\nhim, \"I'm the platoon commander. My platoon is no longer because it was diversified to\nother things. And since you rejected 10 men, I had no alternative, so with the permission of\nmy commander, I came.\" \"Sit down, have a drink.\" You know, Russian style. You know,\nlike tea in England. That's how Russians were, that you have a drink that you show your\nhospitality and you show your closeness. I was afraid even to ask him too many questions,\nbut since he himself used that word, \"shalom,\" I took it for granted that he's open and he\nsays, \"Don't worry about it. I'll get somebody else for patrol. You're my concern.\" Because\nit's the first time that I met somebody who wanted to hear what happened. He didn't let me\nstay on duty, he asked me to stay there with him. And I stayed there for two days, and\nafterwards, I was called because I was to take my platoon and join the induction center\nbecause we had to bring the inductees about 60, 70 miles away to another city which it's\ncalled Monastyrok. Because the railroads were totally disrupted; the railroad did not go any\nfurther than Monastyrok. And so we mustered and within a few days a nice few thousand,\nmaybe over 5, 6,000 and we put them in rows. We had to march to get them out from the\ninduction center with bayonets. And the women and children and everybody was like a\ndemonstration. They're crying over why their men are taken from them and so on. And some\nof them tried to pay off. I knew from the grapevine that one of my platoon guys, because he\nlater came and asked me. And I told him that \"If you talk to me again about bribe, I'm going\nto have you arrested.\" So I don't want to hear about and I don't know -- so he understood that\nI don't want to be involved, but I wouldn't to hear. He was a Jewish boy from my platoon,\nand I sort of see and don't see, you know, and don't know. But whatever he wanted to do, he\nwent. And a lot of them what they did, they would write on a piece of paper that you have\nthis list. That period was mostly that you show up in Grodno, they'll take him, but they\nwouldn't induct him again. So what he did, in the meanwhile, they got someone that will\ngive you watches; someone will give you gold pieces and so on. I did not want to be a party\nto all of that, as I aforementioned. We loaded them into trains, and we went as far the old\nborder of the Soviet/Polish border. Over there, the military KGB took over and I was given\npapers to go back. I would say this would finalize this part of the chapter, and after that we're\ngoing have to talk about the liberation and what had happened in the field.\nVideographer: How much time we have. 25 minutes.",
        "A: 25 minutes? Okay. For me again, a human life had started with papers from the Soviet\ngovernment written in it that every place I show up with my platoon, no matter how many I\nhave, the head of this location of settlement is to provide me with my men, food, and shelter\nand a place to sleep. The trains at that particular time were all the military. It was a high\ncourt to get you something, a passenger train. So we didn't care, whatever we could get on on\na train, for my whole platoon I remained with one Gentile boy. Because I couldn't get hold\nhim under any other circumstances, who was with me and I knew the farm place from where\nhe came from that he had a mother and sister. And many times in the partisan life before I\njoined the paratroopers, we would stop off to his house and everything like that. So he was\nthe only one, Nathan, the guy that I told you was his name who was the bad guy who was\ntaking bribes, he, of course, realized the way I am. So he wanted to lose me faster than I\ncould go, I had to be lost. So we went in different directions, and we finally ended up on a\nmilitary train on the way to Baranovichi. From Baranovichi, if we get, we're going to work\nour way down further to go to his farm or back to direction to see why we can wind up over\nthere. In the meanwhile while we are in that military train, I already in between time stopped\noff in Minsk because I knew already that I was curious for me to see what's Minsk. And\nMinsk was already liberated months and months before. And I found out through the\npartisans that our main staff that was located in Grodno no longer is in Grodno, but it's right\nnow in Minsk located. I went there to be registered and to get my validated things. And I had\nto make another trip afterwards. The first thing I got up there was two medals that they gave\nme. One medal is for being a partisan, and the other medal was that I received at the time for\nbeing a heroic partisan. So all of sudden, when I was on this train with Walodia (ph)\ntogether, I had the two medals. He didn't get no medals or anything like that. He only got the\npartisan validation, it looked like a medal that everyone was given in Minsk. So when we got\non the train and that was a military train, within hours a guy comes over and I could\nrecognize by his hat, that this color hats and so on belong to the NK VD, we used to call it at\nthat time, which later turned to be KGB 1n due time later. He got involved in conversation\nand he asked me for documents. So I showed him the documents, firstly, these were given to\nme by the KGB when I was released from my platoon to go back. And the other documents\nthat I already had on me for the medals was that I was a partisan, and he found very\ninteresting to ask me. He says, \"I want to stay with you. You're going to fill me in and tell me\nwhat took place in the partisans.\" Because to him was a total new story that he heard about it\nthat Stalin used to rob and , but he never heard or known what activities and what\nhad went on. So \"Where are you going?\" he asked me. And I tried to say here, Walodia (ph)\nhere has a mother because he was from the and a sister, and I at the same time want\nto go back to that direction to see maybe somebody survived that I know from the partisans\nto me. And then I'm going to go to look for work. He says, \"You don't have to look for work.\nI'm going to take you to work.\" Then he told me that he's a lieutenant and probably going to\nget the rank of captain, and he's going to Baranovichi, which he will be inducting people for\nwork in the KGB. I realized that the KGB man will never say no more other things like that\nwhich at this particular time, I let him talk to me and I accepted it. And we were friends on\nthe train until we got to Baranovichi, the whole period, too. And that's how another phase of\nmy life had started. So that lieutenant did not let his eyes off of me and my partner, and we\nfinally descended in Baranovichi. And he made sure that I come with him and register in the\nemployment agency where he turned me into a captain in charge of that. To Walodia, my\nfriend, he says, \"The militia is right nearby. Let him go back there, and he gave him his name\nif any questions.\" And he registered there for a job and he'll be there.",
        "A: No, the local police. In Russia in the Soviet Russia, there was no such thing as police. It was\nalways militia. The militia was, you know what I mean, when we use saying the voluntary.\nThat was not voluntary, but that was a police force. Take the police department in any city,\nand I refer militia; that's what I mean.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: Yeah. All right. So Walodia registered there, and we made out with him that after\nregistration we both want to take a two weeks' vacation, sort of to speak, so he can go to his\nfarm. Because actually 1t was harvest time at that time, we're talking about September at the\ntime. The biggest harvest time in that area which his mother having a small farm, would\nhave needed a hand. There wasn't enough. So it was a good reason that they didn't mind that.\nAnd they let me go with him because I was going as sort of a farm hand to help him on his\nfarm. And at the same time, I just said I'll go. So we got a date within two weeks to meet up\nback, I and the officer of the KGB. And he and the office of the local police or militia, as\nthey were called. And while I went -- I already arrived now, they issued me new papers\nbecause in the Soviet Union you did not travel anyplace without having the justified papers.\nAnd the justified papers weren't meaning a permit. You see, at a time later on we had to get\npassports because you always had to have your ID with you. But at the time, they gave me\nand Walodia papers that we can go to the area. You had to specify where you're going, who\nyou're going to see, what you're going do about it. And papers in hand, we had already on the\ntrain free passage. No nothing like this here to go back to his farm in his little -- which it was\nlocated not to far from Russia. It was in a way sort of a happy journey for the first time for\nhim. The more I get freer and the more my eyes were seeing the free world, the more I\nbecame sort of shaken up. I could not take freedom. You did not have a psychiatrist at that\ntime or a doctor to go to for help to help you overcome. You just had to work it out. When I\ncame to his house, his mother gave him a changeover and she gave me a changeover. I was\ntreated like part of the family, which at that particular time was again a novelty item for a\nJew. A novelty item for survival from stuff like this here. So we, of course, we had dinner\nand a few drinks, and afterwards, the two of us went out in the little -- it was a farm\nsettlement, maybe I would say, maybe 60 to 80 families. And they all had farms, small\nfarms, around there, and there with a harmonica, you know what I mean, dancing and\ndrinking, which it was all a celebration. After all, they got a hero back, Walodia, which he\ngrew up in this here. And I, being the former commander of Walodia, which I used to come\nas a partisan with Walodia a lot of times, so I knew enough people in his settlement more\nthan just his mother and so son. We had another guy with us.",
        "A: Some of these little things that I forgot myself to take and put it in a drawer and so on. Yes,\nthere was also a few more guys who were in our brigade serving as partisans from the same\nsettlement. And the other ones were inducted, while they would not be the paratroopers like\nwe were. Let's see, I was where?",
        "A: You were talking about you were at the settlement and everyone was happy to see Walodia\nhome and...",
        "A: Of course, my brothers, my sister, my uncles, my aunts. I had quite a big family which I\ndon't till this day were they killed and burned inside the ghetto or were they brought out and\nkilled in these holes in the center of the town, which they were led from the bombings when\nthe war had started.",
        "A: No, no one survived it. I had my uncle which I mentioned who in my hideout came, and he\nsurvived them and he came to the forest. He told me that my brother started to fight the\npolice back and they didn't shoot him, but they beat him to death on the outside of the\napartment. So that's what I was told by him. And what had happened the fate of where they\nwere buried? My uncle and my rest of the brothers and sisters, I did not know. So perhaps\nmaybe this is the bitterness in me over why I never cared to return to Debrecen to face the\nevil. To see the injustices the way people and that era, and with no one to turn to to their help\nor to their safety. So I cut shorter even the time and then I returned to Baranovichi. When I\nreturned to Baranovichi, I looked up those three girls. Russa (ph) was the one you recollect\nin my conversation telling that she was the one taking care of that fuhrer. And it\nwas another girl, there was another girl who her boyfriend that she was dating at the time\nmet the last few days of liberation to them in the forest, he met his death at that time while on\na mission fighting there. And I, of course -- she was his girlfriend, and so she was in\nbedroom, and then was one more, Sonja, which she's in the USA. As a matter of fact, she\nlives in one of the condos in Boca, which I've seen. But she was living in New York before.\nSo those three girls housed themselves together, and often they told me that they used to get\nJewish guys as pilots or so coming to their apartment. So all of a sudden, I was invited by\nthem sort of to become a frequent visitor whenever I have time, you know. Which when time\npermitted me, I was. Now, I must step over to tell you another epithet which it happened\nwhile being in the NK VD. The NK VD work, which it may sound odd in the Soviet Union\nthat it went on, really I had one payroll check, but I was doing the work of four. I was a\nsecretarial job. I was the man in charge of the whole auto -- in other words, they had so many\nautos in the department, I was the one issuing for them gasoline tickets. I was the one doing\nthe accounting of consumption of all of that. And I also was the one responsible with another\njob that once a Minsk car would go to bring all kinds of stuff, be uniforms or whatever the\ndepartment needed, which it was located in Minsk. They kept it in Byelorussia, so as I say --\nand before the holidays so any roundups, I had to go duty as a KGB which I was assigned\nwith maybe two more guys and go to the houses. As the time of year it is, as I say, the war\nwas not over in total as yet, because the war went on until about May the 7th or the 8th when\nit was declared the war was over. So every time before a holiday was nearing, we used to\nhave to go to search homes and search passports and different documents. Because we were\ntold there are crime going on, and there are many people who resist the Soviet system\nbecause we used to give our political speeches. And it's our job to go and turn all of these\nhere criminals in. On one of these here journeys, one day it happened I was again the head of\nthe group, there were three of us. I knock on the door, and then I'm jumping the gun because\nthat happened already when I was married. I got married in January of 1945, and, you know,\nwe are quite a bit off yet. We are still talking about September, you know, August,\nSeptember, nearing October.",
        "A: So with that mission at that particular time, we were assigned to look for criminals. What\nwas the criminal? Somebody who did not report to be inducted. That was a criminal.\nEverybody in their passport had to have a separate page stamped from the induction center\nthat he's released from induction because maybe he was not fit medically -- I mean,\nphysically. Maybe he wasn't. There were other deficiencies, but on the passport if you did\nnot have that stamp or that page proving to you that you were released from service\nbecoming a soldier in other words, being inducted, you had to turn them in. And believe me\na lot of ttmes maybe the people have fear, did not have the documents with them, and we\nused to round up so much time. And then if they were questioned, they didn't find anything\nto hold them, they would let them out. Now, that particular night I'm knocking on the door,\nand I was first to knock on the door. And I keep telling them, I said, \"Make the lights. This is\nthe KGB coming for an inspection. Everybody come out holding their passports ready for\nexamination.\" In 1t comes out a voice in Yiddish with Hebrew stating say, \" ,\"\nwhich translating that into English means Hebrew or Jew, keep on walking. It sounds so\nstrange in a way and it got me in a very peculiar way. I went outside, closed the door, and I\nsaid -- the others say, \"Something going on?\" I says, \"Everything is in order. Everything is\nfine. Let us proceed to the next mission.\" He left me, however, with a feeling, I feel like I\nmust go back to that place. Find out who was that guy who was talking. You know what I\nmean? So sure enough, the next day in the middle of the day I'm coming there in uniform. I\nknock on the door, and I met him in there. I says, \"I was the guy last night. Who was the one\nwho said,\" \"? And he said he don't want to commit himself until -- which by\ncoincidence of how it would be, that was a cousin. A first cousin to my wife who was also a\npartisan at . And he was trying to beat, because the war was coming over, who\nwanted to be inducted? And after a while surviving a ghetto, surviving a partisan, and right\nnow he had to go back to fight? Besides the man was older, but he was still leading the\ncriterion of age, and he could not have any other way of saving himself from not going. So\nthey were really hiding out sort of waiting all of the days until it will come to an end and the\ninduction probably won't be here. Which I had to tell him, we got to talk word for word he\nwas with the , and word for word we got to talk about who I know and what,\nwhere and when. And I tried to tell him, give htm my wife's name. He says, \"You know,\nthat's my first cousin.\" So it was such a coincidence, we're thrown again 1n a funny kind of\nsituation. I tried to tell, I says, \"I'm working the KGB. I hope you understand. We met now,\nbut I cannot give my head for you guys' hiding. At this moment, you better do what you want\nto do. I don't want to find you again when I come here. I really cannot protect you, so you\ngot to do what you got to do.\" Which they moved away back, you know what I mean,\nsomeplace else. And, you know, it so happens neither one of them was inducted. They got\nthemselves secure jobs that they shouldn't be able to be inducted. And that was another little\nstory to tell what had happened over there. The next thing what had happened to me over\nthere that every time the captain would see me from the employment, he would turn around\nand say to me, \"You know, you need to go back to school because on your post that you\nhave, you can only -- must be at least a first lieutenant. You have no rank. We keep you here\nbecause we don't have any men, and besides you deserve it. You were in the partisans,\" and\nso on. So I says, \"Where 1s that school at?\" And he would tell me the school that was in\nRussia. In my mind I did not have the love for the Soviet system even then in my mind, and\nit was sort of a secretive part in me because you could not talk or disclose. In other words, I\ndidn't ask to go to work to the KGB. I was sort of forced into it in a way. And I started to tell\nhim that at the moment I wish I could get just a little bit more time to get the past out of my\nsystem. I mean, you know, the war is about -- not over yet, and I will take 1t under\nconsideration. Because over there they tell you to do, but it's got to come in a form that you\nask for it. That I will find in the proper time the papers to be sent to a special school of\nofficers to be able to further my career. At the same time to get an apartment was terrible.\nMany nights I would sleep in the apartment because as much as the man responsible for\nfinding housing and the housing man with a family they implanted somebody. And they used\nto say find room for Harold or Joe, or whatever it is and that's what it was. For families, it\nwas almost impossible because a lot of the houses were burned, you know, and destroyed.\nAnd here there was influx of so many more Soviets coming in because to take over the\noffices and make it under their control. So it was -- I got in a very bad mood, and one day I\ncome into the office. And I say to my captain there, which he was the boss of the\nemployment, I says, \"I decided that I want to join the service.\" He says, \"Wait a minute, you\nlittle so-and-so. Do you know where you're at? Have you forgotten that you're working for\nthe KGB? In the KGB, you're not coming to tell me what you are going to do, what you\nintend to do. We are going to tell you what to do, when to do it.\" He says, \"I will tell you\nwhether you can go and register as a volunteer to go to the army. Besides, we are on a\nspecial statute. You cannot be drafted without us from the KGB allowing you to serve. And\nyou cannot serve in the KGB of the military. You haven't got the education and you haven't\ngot the rank. So, therefore, get 1t out of your head and don't you dare ever come to ask me\nthings like that on your own.\" It fell not on deaf ears, but very open ears. I began to feel more\nscared than I felt secure before. I had a problem at that particular time, as I said, with\nhousing. And with food, I did not have so much a problem because I was eating in the\nofficers' restaurant, and at officers' restaurant the food was much better. I had a guy, Captain\nTrusoff (ph), who was 1n charge of financial department, and he would give me extra\ncoupons because we wore Russian cards at that time. But in the restaurant for the officers,\nyou could eat what you want and as much as you want, but had to have that card. So\nwhenever I wanted to have more than one meal I would go to Captain Trusoff (ph), and I\nwas a young man and I was a hungry person at the time for years when I was coming back to\nmyself. So he would see to it that if I need something, Captain Trusoff (ph) would be at my\nside. Before long behind that announcements that all the people who came from the formerly\nPoland and wish to return back can right now come and register at the Polish Soviet\nCommission and, you know, the hours and everything like that. Naively, I think nothing of\nit. I forget myself again and the words that he said about the KGB. I go ahead and register\nmyself the place that I was born. They knew that I was born in the city, you know, that it was\nin Poland. And I tell them when I register that I'm willing for a settlement to go back to\nPoland, not thinking for one moment that everything from that office is going to come\nimmediately to the KGB and they will immediately know that I went again to do something\nwithout permission, especially not an assignment. And that's this thing what had happened\nthe following the day when I came to work -- do we have enough time? When I came to\nwork, my door was locked. My boss locked the door. The other secretary was not let in to\ncome in, and he asked me to face him to sit down at his desk. And he started a full\ninvestigation about Harold. State your name. State your address. State your age. Where were\nyou born, and tell him all about myself like my history and the way I was in the partisans.\nAnd I was a platoon commander, and all of this here. And then he turns around, as if he\nwouldn't know, \"Tell me, I see you're wearing two medals. Would you explain me what\nthese medals is?\" I say to him, \"But I already told you before when I was hired here on the\njob what these medals are. What do you want ask me?\" In the meanwhile, tantrum is setting\nin on me. But he bangs his hand on the table, and he says, \"I already told you many times\nwhen I ask a question, you are to answer now when I ask you, and not to tell me that you\nalready. When I ask you any question, you must answer it to me.\" Okay. So I tell him what\nthese here two medals stand for. I already -- as I said which I will tell in another part, the\nway I got married and what had happened, was wearing a ring that my father-in-law bought\nme at that time. He says, \"What is that ring which you're wearing? Don't you know that that's\na showing of bourgeois?\" In other words, in our system, people do not wear rings because I\nanswered him that it's a ring that I got from my father-in-law as a gift from getting married.\nOkay.",
        "A: We still are talking about right now that I registered, heard about registration to go back to\nPoland, 1f you remember. And I said I'm right now with the boss in my office with a locked\ndoor. And he's asking me all sorts of questions.",
        "A: Okay. Ready? The questions ensued until about lunch hour. The lunch hour we started at 1\no'clock at that time. The boss called a halt and we're going for lunch. Since I was eligible and\nused to go to the same officers' restaurant as him, he told me they're going to stop right now\nand go for lunch. To my surprise when I came out to the restaurant, so many officers, all of\nsudden, like the news spread out. Everybody all of a sudden found out that Harold registered\nto go to Poland, and everybody knows, but Harold didn't know about it, see? And here I'm\nput to a dilemma, some officers be that they served in the police, be that they worked 1n the\nKGB with me, taking it for a total shock as if to say how dare you do a thing like that? You\nbrought shame on us. Here, look at him. He 1s a -- look at him, he 1s a second lieutenant.\nLook at the other one in all kinds of ranks. You're living here in a country where the Jews\nhave all the privileges and all the rights, and you are trying to away? I says, \"What do you\nmean, trying to go away? It was published for anybody who was born in Poland who can\nreturn back.\" \"Why do you want to go back to Poland?\" I said, \"Poland is the same. We are\nin Poland as it's here. Maybe by hook or by crook, I can look up some of my families or\nwhatever it 1s. I am not escaping, or anything like that. I would like to go ahead to see that.\"\n\"No, no, no. Poland is anti-Semitic, and you have no rights and business to go back.\" I says -\n- so he says to me, \"I want you -- I cannot order you -- that you must go back and withdraw\nyour registration. All of us officers here, you're loved by us all. We like you, you must return\nour rights to us now because you brought shame on us. And you must be erasing that. So the\nonly way for you to do it is you must go back and resign.\" There at lunch I meet up also with\nCaptain Trusoff, who I said was the head of the finance department, and he was a very fast-\ntalking guy, a man who could talk so fast that you could hardly hear him as fast as he was\nsaying. But he was a tremendous able man in the area of financing and accounting and so on.\nAnd often would like to talk with me and train me in that endeavor, which it meant more\nwork for me, you know. And he says, \"Harold, what are you trying to do?\" Here, a captain in\nthe KGB. I tell him the story. He said, \"Don't tell me none of which you're trying to tell the\nothers. You don't like it here. You want to run away from here because you want to go to\nAmerica. You still like the story of commerce and everything like that. So I don't want to\nbuy anything of this here.\" Listening to him, and he was like my right hand supplying with\nfood and so on, I was sort of under his guard. I cannot afford him not to turn against me. I\nsaid, \"Captain Trusoff, would you please tell me what you would like for me to do? I will\nlisten.\" He says, \"Good. You go and ask permission from your boss, and you go back to the\ncommission over there and make an official resignation. And everything will be fine, stay\nlike this here.\" I says, \"I'm going to ask my boss and I will do it. And thank you for advising\nme. I'm sorry I caused all of that to you.\" I apologized to all of them, and that's it. We went to\neat. Coming back, my boss started with the questions. I told him, I says, \"Please forgive me.\nI would like to ask a favor of you.\" He says, \"What is it?\" I says, \"I realized after talking to\nCaptain Trusoff and naming my name all the other officers, that I made a grave mistake. I\ndid not make that mistake maliciously or knowingly. I made that mistake for not thinking\nabout what I was doing, so I beg your pardon of forgiveness. And I want to get time so I can\ngo to the commission and register -- and in other words, resign officially on the document.\nWould you tell me that I can do it?\" He says, \"Tomorrow, you can do it in the regular hours\nof lunch. You can go there and resign.\" And he began to continue still with his questioning\nand he said that's the good thing that what I did now, and he appreciates it very much that I'm\nrestoring my dignity of the office, the job over here. And he knows that that is not going to\nhurt my qualifications of whatever it is further to be done. And I was turning back to my\nwork, the secretary came back in, and I thought maybe that it's all over. Two hours later, I\nwas called into another office, and again, the same thing started again. What it meant is now,\nthey were trying to compare notes as to what I was asked earlier, am I going to be repeating\nagain. I became so annoyed with it and so scared that I ran up a fever. We used to have a big\nbreak of the hours between 6:00 and 8:00 for two hours. Which it was like dinnertime. I told\nthe officer that I'm in charge that I am -- I feel like I have a fever, and I don't think I'll be able\nto walk home. I need the help of a taxi -- I mean, I said taxi. A cab, we did not have taxis\nthere. So I was given a cab to be taken home. When I came home, I took a thermometer and\nequal to the temperature as we would have, I almost had a 101 and 1/2. And I was shivering\nwhen I came into the house that I was living in it, where also former partisans and some of\nthem came back. So I tried to tell them the story, what had ensued with me, what it's all\nabout, and that I have a problem. How can I relay that message to my wife, which she was in\nShevchenko or or Chita or it's any of the three names that it's been called, all three,\nto tell her what had transpired over here? And when time came for me to come back to work,\nI didn't. And all of sudden, I hear the roar of a car. And in those days when you heard a roar\nfrom a car, it could have been only from the police of the KGB because civilian people did\nnot driving cars. And when I look out of the window, I saw the Commandant himself came\nin and walked in the house. He came into the house, asked me, \"How come you're not at\nwork?\" I tell him, I says, \"I developed a temperature, that's how I was taken. I couldn't come\nhome.\" And I show him the temperature. He says, \"I have an order to bring you back, so I\ndon't want to hear any of your excuses, temperature, whatever it is.\" Well, the women over\nthere in the house on the other side, \"Harold, take off your ring.\" I was having a watch.\n\"Take off the watch.\" I was under the pretension that I'm taken in to be arrested, no other\nway. And I'm leaving them a message, you know what I mean? One woman is offering me to\ntake a sandwich with me, you know what I mean? I say, \"I'm not hungry.\" Who could eat at\na time like that? And I came, was brought back to the office, to my office that I worked from.\nI'm sitting there for a half-hour and almost like malaria got on me. I was shivering. And I\ncould see the boss, the captain is not in. And like I expressed so many times before, I was in\nthat time a rebel. I picked up the phone and called the general. The general was the head of\nthe whole regional KGB. He was a hero from the war missing one hand, which he had lost in\nbattle. And that's what had helped him regain to have that rank what he got over there. And\nat times each one of us had assignments to be on guard duty for 24 hours in the main office\ninto various assignments. Some of them were encoding and decoding and some of them were\njust answering the phone and so on.",
        "A: I'm speaking now from the time I came home, like I said?",
        "A: No more from the time I came home. Asking for the (inaudible). All this interviewing got me\nshaken up to so much that I just -- my feet wouldn't walk. I felt very weak, and I had to\nsummon that they should send out a car to take me home for the big break, which they did.\nAnd I went by car way home. As soon I came into the apartment, I disclosed to my friends\nbecause I want you to know each room meant a family is living. It wasn't an apartment when\nI mean to say that one person had two rooms or three rooms. The whole house where I'm\nreferring to had about four rooms, but four rooms meant four families were living there. And\nthose families, with the exception of one, were also who was survivors that they survived in\nthe forest. That one family was in the Soviet Union at that time before the war broke out, so\nthey were saved from the agony of the ghetto and so on. And they just came back from the\nSoviet Union, so to them it was a different story to know what had happened and to find out\nhow much they missed the hangman in their own right. So I came in there, told them the\nwhole story what had ensued. I immediately got words from the people advising take off\nyour ring, take off your watch. Because the atmosphere became that I probably will wind up\nunder arrest, and who know what the outcome will be? My biggest worry was how do I get\nthe news to my wife, who was Shevchenko or at the time, which it was -- sure, by\ntrain it was not too far. But telephones, we did not have. The only way if I would want to get\n-- if I was to know somebody from the KGB and call him and come and tell them, which you\nknow that was a dream that I could not even dream about. But people used to come daily to\nBaranovichi from Chita, and I knew another family over there whose husband also the same\nage as my wife's and she was going to school in the same way. He used to work for the KGB\nin the -- on the railroad KGB, and her parents were also from the same city, from Chita. And,\ntherefore, I decided that someone should go to her and through her maybe would be able to\nget words to my wife about what is going on. Because I did not know will I be arrested, or\nwhat it will take place at the time. So, anyways, I came home. I couldn't eat or go to eat, and\nI couldn't go back to work since I started to take my temperature. I felt that I have a\ntemperature, and the temperature registered equal to our temperature reading about 101 over,\nyou know. I was shivering and everything like that. My being back to work was supposed to\nbe at 8 o'clock; 6:00 to 8:00 was the two hours. It must have been about 20 past 8:00 that we\nheard the roar of a car. And to hear the roar of a car was not a common thing because\ncivilians did not drive around in cars. So a car we could only hear from an official, and the\nofficial would either be KGB or the police, any of these here places. I took a look who's\ngoing out with the car, and it was the Commandant, as we would call him. The Commandant\nis the head person who was in charge of providing every necessary thing for all the working\npeople in the KGB in that building. And he also had a rank, it was his control so if you\nneeded housing, he was the one providing housing for you. If you needed to go be\ntransferred someplace, whatever, what arrangements would have been transportation and so,\nhe would provide that, too. And I say to him, \"I cannot go back to work. I have a\ntemperature.\" He says, \"I got an order, and you know that an order is to be filled out, you\nhave to come to come with me and I'm taking you. Okay? Don't let me use force,\" he says,\n\"Harold.\" I says, \"No, no. I didn't say that.\" I went in, came into my office where he let me\nout. No one is there, my boss 1s not there. I have no one to talk with. Now, I used that word\n6:00 to 8:00 because we did not have prescribed hours that you work to 10:00 or until 12:00.\nSometimes we would work till the wee hours, till 12 o'clock. And at times, before I had my\napartment -- my apartment I only got after I got married to my wife. Otherwise, a lot of\ntimes, I would sleep 1n the office like this here on the table or on the floor, one of the two.\nBecause apartments was at a dire shortage in Baranovichi in those days. So I see he's not\nthere, and here I'm feeling shivering like malaria with a fever. I picked up the telephone to\ntalk directly to the general. The general was the head of the whole regional KGB department,\nand he knew of me from before. Because I used to be there sometimes that we used to have\non a 24-hour guard, and I would be there. And he would like for me to tell him stories of the\npartisans or he would tell me stories about the front lines. He lost his left arm, and that's what\nhe was rewarded. In other words, that post that he was gotten. And I call him up, and he says\nto me, \"What can I do for you?\" I tell him. \"I was brought here to my office because of my\nboss' request. I am sick with a fever, and he is not even there. I don't know what he wants me\nfor.\" He says, \"Your boss 1s sitting right next to me over here. Why don't you speak to him\ndirectly?\" I says, \"Thank you very much,\" you know. He gave him the phone and I talked to\nhim. I says, \"I really don't know why you brought me here. I am sick. That's why I asked\nbefore to have a car taking me home. I have a fever.\" As we're speaking, \"I've got about 41\ndegrees which it's a high fever.\" 42 is the highest. I says, \"I cannot be on my feet; I'm\nshivering.\" He says, \"Okay. Well, I'm going to order you a cab and you go back home.\" This\nis the way I saw right there the way the KGB works. You're sick or whatever it 1s, everybody\nis calm, composed, and you will not realize. And no one came telling me what I was called\nfor or what it was all about. And I was taken back home. As I was taken back home, I had a\nhard time to fall asleep that night. I wanted -- I thought falling asleep would do me the best. I\njust lie awake, and I don't know what I really did to myself. Why did I think that stupidly to\nget involved with registering to go back to Poland and everything like that? And I almost\nthought I put my life on the line, and my biggest worry how do I get words to Sonja, to my\nwife about what's going on? Anyways, in the morning, I showed to work, and with the last\nwhatever force I had I walked. I didn't -- first of all, there was no phone that I could call in to\nhave a car pick me up. And to await the decency I knew that it would not happen, so I got up\nwith an early start and showed up for work. And as I came to work, I saw my boss and the\nrest of them. No conversation ensued about anything like that. I went over to him only and\nsaid, \"Do you remember that you permitted me today at my lunch hour time to go to the\noffice, the mixed commission of the Polish and Soviet, and resign?\" He says, \"Yes, I\nremember. What are you trying to ask me?\" I says, \"I'm trying to confirm at this time since\nwe're getting to our lunch hour. I think I'd rather go before I eat. Is it okay with you?\" He\nsays, \"You may leave right now.\" And I left right into that office and resigned. And the\nreason resigning, I was asked what it is, I wrote in, \"I realized that I have made a mistake.\nThat really I have no reason to go back to Poland. I feel good to where I am, and I'm happy\nto remain here.\" I came into the restaurant and I met some of the officers again that I met the\nday before, and I was trying to tell them the good news about that I resigned. \"Oh, we knew\nthat you're the right kind of guy and you know the right thing what to do.\" And everybody\nsort of instead of shying away from me like they did the big day, the previous day. Now, all\nof sudden, they came a little closer. \"We are very happy what you did, and you'll be very\nhappy with had happened.\" But in my heart I figured I cannot resign really from that. And I\nhad to plan a new way and justify in my mind what to do about escaping the Soviet Union at\nall.",
        "A: You write a paper resignation, like you resign of a job.",
        "A: No. Resigning from wanting to go to Poland.",
        "A: That means I wrote a resignation. First, I applied that I wanted permission to go Poland.\nNow, I did the reverse. There was another form that I filled out that I no longer wished to go\nto Poland.",
        "A: I revoked -- if that word, \"revoked\" makes you better feeling about it, that's fine.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: NKVD was used through the years. However, as of late maybe for the last -- before the\nSoviet was broken up, but maybe even under the resistance way back about 20 years, this\ndepartment, which it was the security department of the Soviet Union, was changed. And the\nacronym of the words were no longer NK VD, but they remain KGB; also, the acronym of\nthe office of security for the Soviet Union.",
        "A: So I used that merely that the reader, whichever way he knows or he heard, that's either it's\nNKVD or KGB, it's one of the same offices that it was changed. As of today when we refer\nto Soviet, they still refer to KGB because of the later...",
        "A: Yes. I'll backtrack this part till I come to tell you the rest of this story because I decided that\nthat decision must be done with me and my wife and her father. Because no longer could I in\nmy life think of myself, I had a partner to worry and help me decide my future. I met my\nwife after I became platoon commander. I became platoon commander sometimes in early\n'43. Afterwards I was taken away from my brigade, former brigade as I was, and was\nadopted to the new brigade that 1t was formed by Geno Tsinko (ph) which they were known\neither as the easterners or the paratrooper division and so on. In my platoon that I was given\nthe charge of was one young man who hails from the same city as my wife came from who\nalso was coming from the same hiding hut, let's refer to it as a hut, because it was built in a\npart of the ground and above the ground. And in that hut were living quite a few families in\nthe family camp, as I mentioned before. But the family camp was not close to us; it was close\nto the other people from her home town, or as we would call them in fighting groups of the\ntrap.",
        "A: Zential (ph), . in Yiddish, the way they called it. They had a special\nname. So we had heard that young man live before and he decided to join the fighting part\nand he was put into my platoon. Through him while we would have to come on certain\nassignment things that were taking place, I needed a guide because that area was not as well\nfamiliar to me in the new place where we were at that time operating. So these guides, we\nhad the guides who were in that hiding house that he knew, I think, every tree, where it's\nlocated in the forest. Because he used to deal with live cattle buying, you know what I mean,\nbefore. So he would often be with the farmers involved, and that man used to be an uncle to\nthat guy, Lade (ph) was his name, who was in my platoon. So he would take me there at\ntimes when we would go because he wanted to visit with them. In the meanwhile on one of\nthose occasions, I spotted my present wife who was there. There were more girls besides her,\nand this is what the start that the romance had started. Of course, she had two guards with\nher, her brother, who survived; and her father, may he rest in peace now. But he survived and\ncame with us to the United States just as well. So she was well cared for by them, and I only\nwas able to talk, you know, with that little talk. And at night, when we would go to sleep,\nthey would make sure that I don't touch my present wife because father and brother were\nright in place in the right places. So it used to be that I, from talking, that I began to sort of\nget a liking for her, but I was not in the era a lover, per se. I had previous, which I didn't\nmention, I had a girl that I again was asked to be in love with her. And -- but we had to\ndisrupt it under the circumstances because they wanted to live in the family camp, and I said\nI didn't come to the forest for any other reason but to fight. And I, therefore, did not want to\nhear about family camp at all. And while from occasion to occasion, I used to meet up with\nher to help her out. But again I disrupt 1t because she wanted to get serious, and I was not a\nperson at the time for seriousness as to get involved even for dating steady. I was very much\n-- | was very much afraid in case, you know, from one thing leads to another, and who\nknow? You make the girl pregnant, and then you get killed. Why bring in another person\nirresponsibly? The way I was feeling at the time. And in all to tell you is babies were born.\nAbortions were performed. There was all kinds of things that it goes on in regular life, went\non also in the forest. Under different circumstances, of course, not the way it here goes on,\nbut it still went on and it's a fact to state. Afterwards when we got liberated, when I came\nback from my march for the two weeks that I went with Walodia, my wife held a grudge --\nmy present wife held a grudge at me for a while over why I didn't stop at her home town. But\nI rather decided to go with Walodia to his home and to go to Chita. And be for what it's\nworth it while I was working in the KGB, one day while going from work -- to work early in\nthe morning, I think from distance I saw somebody look like her. And the other girl which\nwas a girlfriend who lived in that same apartment which I later wound up living. And before\nlong, I closed the door and exited out and I make sure to my eyes that I had seen her. I met\nwith her and talked with her, and the girl told me now where she lives, and I promised her\nthat I will be in touch. And our romance began to sort of start. To tell you how it was with\nme in those days, I did not write letters. I wrote poems rather, and this was my expressing a\nlove to her and so on. By the way, if I didn't mention, I have six or seven published poems,\nwhich I have the books, and the majority of them are dedicated to the Holocaust and some of\nthem -- 1n one of them in the poems, like I said, I used that same words, I didn't come to the\nforest to fight -- I mean, to just hide, but I came to the forest to fight. And that's what's\nmaking my rhyming words. If you'll be interested some day, I'll let you read them, but it's\nbeen work that I did. And that's how we used to do, and from time to time she would come to\nvisit to my home town. She had where to stay, but with me, I did not get the time off to be\nable to do it.",
        "A: I would say in the kilometers way of saying, at least I would say about a hundred kilometers.\nBecause first of all, from her to the railroad station, we had to walk about 16 kilometers. It\nwasn't such an easy task, and believe it or not in those years, winter or not, we would walk\nfrom the train station to her house and, of course, I used to walk and keep my pistol open. I\nmean, just in case. But that was again what I said, the training from the forest and gun on the\nside sort of made me satisfied that I worked for the KGB. Because I couldn't part with that\npistol at that particular time.",
        "A: We got married January 5, 1945. After -- now, before I got married, I tried to ask -- because\nyou had to fill out forms and write for permission to get married. And since she was in her\nhome town, she couldn't come to me. Since she was working in a place, a publishing place\nfor the local paper, so she was typesetter, and she couldn't get permission because there was\nno one to replace her. I couldn't get permission because I was filling three, four jobs all the\ntime. So it was sort of we couldn't get to each other, so I was denied the third time after\nwriting to get off. After the third time denial, I did not ask anymore. On a clear Monday --\nbut it was not so clear -- it was a stormy snow at that time in Baranovichi, I decided to call\nher friend -- not the girlfriend that I aforementioned before, but the family, Briner (ph) was\nher name, to call on her because she was sort of trying to talk me into getting married sooner\nand that the better part of my life would have been improved and so on. And we made a\nfriendship sort of through that time through her friend who was living in the city. So I\nfrequently used to come visiting with them so I could hear regards from Sonja and so on. So\nI went over there to her, and I told her, I says, \"Look, we are going tonight.\" \"What do you\nmean, Harold? Did they give you permission?\" I says, \"I have no permit. We are going to the\nrailroad station. We are going tonight to Chita or Gottingen (ph), so I did. Snow or no snow,\nwe came there. We walked that walk all the way to the house, and when I came into the\nhouse, Sonja was by herself and she was shocked. Why didn't I tell her before? Her father\nwould have been able to prepare. I says, \"Tell you what? I couldn't tell you. But if I write to\nyou a letter that I'm trying to go ahead and take off without a permit, you should understand\nbetter than that. I came, it's tonight.\" So the first thing she went running to find her father.\nHer father then was playing cards in another house, and he came in. And, of course, it was a\nproblem. He wouldn't permit me to go sleep with her, obviously, to say. So we decided\ntomorrow, the following day, Tuesday, that we are going to go into -- it was called Zachs\n(ph). Zachs was the marriage license department officially in the Soviet Union, so we went\nto make that official. No sooner we got registered there and everything like that, I got a note\nto the house. Because the guys that were former partisans were working in the KGB here and\nwith the police also the same way. So they came quickly to the house to tell me that they are\nnot going to arrest me, but I have a warranty for my arrest and now that I came to the\nofficialdom -- everything was tied into the KGB. If you got married, the KGB got some of\nthe knowledge about it, too, because that's how they controlled the population. I being aware\nor not aware, I did it and I didn't care. I was the rebel at the time that I didn't care what's\ngoing tomorrow or the next hour. So they said to me, \"Harold, when do you decide to go\nback?\" I says, \"I plan on going back Thursday, no later.\" They say, \"Okay, we'll cover you\ntill Thursday, but Thursday you better get your fanny out of here because otherwise we got\nto arrest you.\" Of course, it looks like the KGB was notified officially after that where I am\nand that I'm on my way back and I'll be there. And my father-in-law, may he rest in peace,\ngave me Vodka to take home because he used to do black market dealing. He used to make\nthe uppers for boots, and boots in those days was like a jeweler, you know. Everybody liked\nto have a pair of boots, and that gave him enough from the farmers who from making boots,\nthat will would bring him all kinds of food in the house so it was no shortage. And before\nlong he used to go into black marketeer to get the other materials, leather and so on. He\nwould go to Vilna or other places for the raw materials. So she got him, and we already were\nmarried officially sort of the next morning because it was, and for that night we planned on a\nTuesday night to plan to have an official Jewish ceremony. So we got a hold the acting sort\nof rabbi, who was also a man who was in the partisans, but he was a blacksmith. And\nthrough history we know there were blacksmith rabbis 1n the times of the sages, so it was a\n. However, it came to write exuba (ph), meaning the marital contract, he tells me he\ndoes not know how. I says, \"I do know how, but, you know, I was a student of that. But it's\nillegitimate, you cannot write your own contract. It must be fulfilled by somebody else.\" So\nwe decided just in his presence and the presence of witnesses to give hands and it became\nsort of a married officialdom with all the other things, but without getting that official\ndocument, exuba (ph). But officially we went through the whole -- and the guys were there,\nthe former partisans, we had a house party to celebrate our wedding. But it was officially as\nit could be. Legally and officially, although not for the Jewish. So that's when we got\nmarried, and I came back. For greetings when I came in, I was arrested. I was asked to\nsurrender my gun immediately. The Commandant took me under arrest and charged me with\ndesertion. The thing, he put me into the jailhouse. A few hours later, after two hours, no one\nother than the general himself is coming down. And he says to him to the Commandant,\n\"Why did you arrest him?\" So he said he did, he had the order for desertion, so he turned\naround to me. \"Would you please tell me what has transpired?\" I tell him, I says, \"Three\ntimes I made applications filed through my boss that he knows for giving me permission to\ngo and get married.\" I says, \"I thought getting married is constitutional. However, I needed\nto do it in writing. I did, I lived up to it and three times I was turned down. So I got tired.\" He\nsays, \"I got to put boss in jail.\" He says, \"Get him out.\" He says, \"Not you.\" I thanked him,\nand afterwards I said to the Commandant, \"You see, I brought you salami and Vodka,\" and\nwe turned it into sort of a festive mood. And I went back to my office to continue my work,\nand no charges whatever. But at the same time I was fearful, so I left words with my father-\nin-law and discussed the issue of escape with him. And I said to him, \"Let's wait over a week\nor two. And please go ahead under this and this name.\" As I said at the outset of my\nrecording that my birth name was Zuckerman. I changed Zuckerman to Zissman; that's when\nthe changing took place. I registered because as Zissman, there was no one they can trace it\nto. So I didn't care how long it will take them to find out who that Zissman 1s. Rather that is\nthe KGB problem, but I told them they send in my brother-in-law -- my present brother-in-\nlaw, he went in sort of to be the person and they knew him. You know, in small towns they\nknew each other, and my new name became -- as far as the Polish government was\nconcerned, was Zissman and it was all changed. And I was awaiting when the papers will be\nready for them to let me know and I'll make the escape. However, deep in me -- and I was\ncalled now to go ahead for duty at the office of the general. I was afraid that somebody's not\nplaying and I said to my boss, I said, \"Why are you sending me after all I committed?\" He\nsays, \"You were told already too many times. When something's wrong, we'll tell you. You\nhave no reason for me to tell you. You asked to go for duty; you going to go up for the\nduty, and that's all. And ask yourself, I don't ask you to go out to get a new\nand mines.\" I did go and the next day after jury duty I was called to do my regular\nwork which since I was planning my going to Minsk which it was part of the once a month\nthat I would go for supplies, the uniform or the other one. And that used to be a week's going\naway. I would take a train to go to Minsk, and once I used to be saddled with more of my\nneeds than I had to supply and the supplies were there in order, I used to call for a truck and\nthey would send up a truck for me to come in. From Minsk to Baranovichi, it used to be\nmore than a day's driving because firstly, the road and the transportation type of trucks, the\nway it was. I, therefore, instead of going on the train to Minsk turned around and went to\nChita, to my wife's home town, and finding out that my father-in-law got the papers already\nfor me. If not, I got to know a time now because I'm afraid that it's burning under my feet to\nremain without doing anything about it. I did not trust the Soviet Union and the KGB that\nthey are not ultimately going to arrest me, okay?\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: I finished all of that, I think. Yeah. I was right now...",
        "A: Although like I said, I repented in the way they wanted me to do. But my own mind did not\nleave rest with me to make this here my permanent home. I still figured -- and I talked it over\nwith my wife before leaving Chita and her father that as soon they can have the proper\npapers, which I said I had them do under an assumed name, ready for me that I will come\nand get the papers or else he can bring them to me to Baranovichi with the papers and we are\ngoing to do. I had to get the goodwill of my wife and her father to go along with the program\nwhich that was part and I was going to get married, that I made up at first to say. If we\ncannot escape from here, there 1s no use in me getting involved and getting married.\nHowever, if that's what you want to do, that's fine with me. I'm willing one way or the other,\nso which I'm trying to say even though I said one thing, I still -- my mind was set out to do\nsomething else. I used this time period for detour to go to Chita just to find out how far the\npapers were going. To my amazement when I came there, I found out that it was a Polish\nholiday and the commission was closed; therefore, by no means could they get the papers\nready that particular day. Since I had to go to Minsk which it was my regular route time of\nthe month to pick up supplies, I hurried with -- my father-in-law gave me to take along some\nVodka and some butter and other things because you had to bribe the officials to get work\ndone, even in the KGB. So when you wanted to have work done fast, as it happened that I\nwas detained for one day being over there, so I decided at this time not to lose any more\ntime. And I came back to the train station and I couldn't get a civilian train, but 1t was a\nmilitary train, showing them documents that I was working for the KGB, and I had to go to\nMinsk. The commander permitted me to go with their train, which that helped to make up\ntime because their train was a direct train that it was going all the way to Minsk. So I made\nup quite a bit of time, as he promised, to have gotten a passenger train regularly going to\nMinsk. When I came to Minsk, I had my guy, which I usually used to call first. He was a\nJewish boy named Rueben, which he was born in Minsk and lived in Minsk. And he was\nworking also for the KGB. So I called him to tell him that I'm in town. He said, \"Harold,\nweren't you supposed to be here yesterday?\" I says, \"Why do you say that?\" He says, \"Please\nclear it up to me.\" He says, \"Major Spock (ph),\" which that was his name, \"was here\nyesterday in the office looking for you.\" I says, \"I did not know that Spock was supposed to\nbe here.\" Which I did not want to disclose to him, so it immediately gave me food for\nthought that they are not trusting me. And they sent Spock to set up to check for me to see\ndid I really go to Minsk or perhaps I went elsewhere. So my suspicion was correct. I came,\ntherefore, and I told them, \"Tell the boys I got good stuff for them. I got Vodka, I got butter\nand other things. Here 1s my order.\" And by all means I must have that order ready because\nat that particular time that was already Tuesday, I said Wednesday, I'm going to call a truck,\nso I must have it ready by Wednesday so when my truck comes -- so Thursday for traveling\nand that's it. Which I, instead of going to the office now, called my office in Baranovichi,\ntalking to my captain, the boss, and telling him that everything is going along all right. And it\nlooks like by all means he should be able to send out a truck tomorrow, because I'll have\neverything under control. I said, \"By the way\" -- I didn't. I says, \"I understand that Spock\nwas looking here for me. Is there any reason what?\" \"I did not know,\" he pretends, \"that\nSpock was there, so I could understand that he tried still again to prey on me.\" I says, \"No,\nno, no, no. Spock was not looking for you. And if he did, I don't know why. I don't know\nwhere Spock is at all.\" And I went about my business and by all means possible Thursday I\nwas back in town with everything. And my boss says to me, very graciously he says, \"You\nsee, and you want to leave us? Nobody can do things that good as you do. Everything is\norganized, and you're back.\" He gave me a lot of praise and fine. I says, \"I'm going to have a\nsurprise. My wife is here in town, and I want to bring her to you tomorrow to see.\" Because\nmy plans were to proceed already. My father-in-law, my brother-in-law and my wife were\nalready in the apartment because, as I said, I told them whenever the papers will be ready,\nask no questions. You come here. I cannot let time lost -- get lost over here because I got a\njump up and proceed. And now that I came back and I told my father-in-law the story, so\nthey saw it was on the nght track. So again to show you in a way you can say naive; on the\nother one you can see how brainwashed people are. As I said before, that I was trying to get\nmy wife to move to Baranovichi, and she couldn't leave her job. I wanted permission for me\nto move to Chita, and I couldn't get it. So when I came, I introduced her. My father-in-law\nand brother-in-law, no. I introduced her to him. I said, \"This 1s my wife. Meet her.\" He says,\n\"You see, I told someday she'll be here.\" I says, \"Of course, you helped a lot.\" I got enough\nto go along for the life story that he had a lot of help to it. And my plan was as soon as they\nsay goodbye, we are going to -- as soon as they see him, they're going to say goodbye to her\nfather and brother. And we are going to get to the station. We were not -- the office was not\ntoo far from the main station to go on train. I had to obtain tickets, which my father-in-law\nwent to get them. I did not even want to be seen in anything like that. So my brother-in-law\nand father-in-law did. And I came back to the apartment, took off my uniform, let my belt\nwith the gun, you know, and the whole thing come there. And I said to my brother-in-law, I\nsays, \"Please, tomorrow morning take it in. They'll ask you questions, you know, from not --\nyou came and you saw that I'm not there and I left the belting on, you did not know who is\nthat in the house.\" Which he did and day afterwards came back to look in the apartment.\nMaybe they can find something about it, and he says he doesn't know. As it was told to me\nlater another guy from the who also served in the KGB, on the military KGB, he\nand that other guy which I aforementioned before who was with my wife's friend, married to\nmy wife's friend, the two of them were sent all the way to Bialystok to look for me. I went on\nthe train that evening and by morning I was in Bialystok. Bialystok was Poland, and that was\nnot capital as Russia, but that was the big city. From where I grew up or from where I was\nborn, it was 150 miles either way to go to either of the cities. Coincidentally, when I came\nthere and I got into a house -- there wasn't hotels to go into then -- we used to go to\ngatherings where Jews are and it was on the move over there of all Europe. People were\nmoving, coming back and going someplace, and other ones just for speculative purposes.\nThe trains were loaded; people were on the top of the trains. Wherever they could room to\nget on a train people were there.",
        "A: Now, we are talking about early May, not early the Ist or the 2nd, but it was in May of 19 --\nit had to be about -- to finish what I'm going to say -- had to be about May the 11th or 10th.\nSomething like here, of 1945. So we came there and take a look in the house. I found from\nmy home town a guy who went to school with. We used to rent an apartment when we first\nmoved to that city, that was our first apartment that we rent from his family to live in. And he\ntells me the good news as I had to tell him. Nobody was left. He was in hiding. And I say to\nhim I would like to go to Sri Lanka to visit it. He says please don't do that because one of the\nguys which he told me, which was also a guy of our age, who lived through in hiding, the\nfirst day he came back towards Sr Lanka, he was shot dead and killed. Well, they didn't --\nseeing us come back meant one thing, which I gave you to read about, the article. It meant\none thing, returning the apartments or returning the homes or the buildings to the Jews. It\nwas confiscated by their volition from the Germans and the Polish government, which it was\nestablished right after the war came to an end in that part which the Soviets liberated, they\ndid not look into it about the Poles should return with a public property, of their own\nproperty, which it was unofficially taken by them. So they didn't want to give it up, so it was\neasier to kill the Jews who claimed that instead of giving up theirs. I understand as of late the\nrule changed a little because they tried at one time to -- a lot of them claimed the properties\nyears afterwards when they came Poland. And the Polish government made a trick about it.\nYeah, you didn't pay the taxes in so many years. So now, how much the tax would be to pay\nwas more than the value of the house would be on the market. So that was another way, that\nway they did not have to return properties to Jews. I understand as of late right now, they\nchanged that any public property -- like, for instance, a synagogue, a Jewish school, or the\ncemeteries or any lots of that nature that had belonged to the community as one, if they had\nclaims to prove through legal means, they would return it back to the community. But they\ndidn't have to return it back to any personal owner. But that's what they tried to do. Maybe it\nwas another Yeshua imitation that you should back to Poland, so I listened to him, and didn't\ndare to go to the -- not to my birth town or to the home town that I lived from where I was\nchased out in 1939. And we decided -- I met somebody else who I knew in Baranovichi\nalready from my home town, and he came asked me would I go with him for black\nmarketing assignment. They used to go into Czechoslovakia. They used to go into Germany,\nbring certain things from there and get farm goods where they could be more available on\nthis end and that's how it went on. And people were doing this here black marketeering quite\nfreely at the time. There was no interference by any of the governments at that particular\ntime because the public was in need of means. And the governments were not ready and able\nto help them restore. So they were happy that no on is making demands on them. Well, my\nwife heard that, she says, \"No, you're not going.\" And I, you know, I did not want to separate\nmyself, although the means would have helped us, you know. Another thing happened to\nme, my father-in-law brought me -- he gave me along to take along when I was escaping, to\ntake a box of yeast. Yeast, they used to make moonshine and everything like that. And yeast\nwas coming in a can at that particular time, was easily accessible, and was the means of\ngetting money. When I came to the house where I met my friend, I had over there light flints\nand this here and it was stolen the first day. So I had a bad taste about being in -- so I said to\nmy wife, \"We cannot go here. We cannot go there.\" We heard that Lodz is building up a\nJewish community, and we heard a lot of people that we knew from were going to Lodz. So\nthese days, it was very easy to decide, you get your stuff which you have, cover, or whatever\nit is that he was carrying around in knapsack like, and you go to Lodz. We came to Lodz, we\nfound a lot of the former partisans which were there from same force as we were. And we\nfound a lot more people from various cities. It was quite a big returning place, Jews from the\ncamps and so on. That Jews survived in camps, I did not know until in Baranovichi when I\nworked for the KGB. That one day we were told that a train is passing by town on the way to\nVilna and in it there were inmates from camps that survived the concentration camps. Only\nthen, which it means in '45 of May, maybe about April or so, did I for the first time I went\npurposely to the station to see how these people looked. And that's the first time I saw the\nuniform with the stripes and I saw the faces of people who survived. Because to our own\nmeaning we thought the Jews were murdered out the same as it happened in our areas. That\nthere were massacres, and they killed them out. We had no idea of knowledge that there\nwere such things as concentration camps. So it was the first time that I saw that in about\nApril in Baranovichi, and then here coming to Bialystok and Lodz, I found out the other\nparts of survivors 1n inmates in concentration camps.",
        "A: It was as much as if I was to be thrown into a different world altogether on a different part of\nthe world. It was the most unbelievable thing for me and many more about me who came out\nof the forests or for hiding to see people surviving especially after I found out what the\nconcentration camps were all about. You, for instance, until you read it, you didn't know\nabout it either, but to us survivors, it was a new phenomenon. A new strange thing to find\nout. And it was some in all -- although I spoke to those people, it sounded a very\ndisbelievable type of story, but that's what it was. And we did not even know how to treat it.\nYou did not know. Do you feel better about it with these people that you met? Do you have\nany conversation? Because to go on and have conversation, we had nothing in common\nbecause that was not the way things happened at all. To go on our conversation that we did\nwas again, strange people, what are you telling me about it? We have suffered; we were in\ncamps, and you were killing and murdering and doing this here, like this here fighting the\nGermans. It was a strange story for them to believe, and it was as strange to us to believe\ntheir plight and their story.",
        "A: Well, you saw a lot of people who were on their way to one thing. Did not have the colors.\nRemember, some of the camp when I talk to you about May 1945, like the Soviets freed\nthem in '44 or early part of '45. Between January of 1945 on the occupied part by the Soviets,\nall these camps were already liberated. You know, at that particular time, which we were\nthere in a way of speech five months. So it still was traveling going on toward around\nEurope, and for documents, the Red Cross was very busy locating people. Getting them\ntogether, helping them go to get passage to go back to their place from where they were\ntaken and so on. So it was quite busy places, so in Lodz, since we brought some things with\nus, you know that now the yeast was stolen. The flints were stolen. We had to go -- so one\nmorning, I says, \"Let me go to the marketplace,\" because it used to be like flea markets right\nthere. And people would bring whatever they want to sell, and at the same time for the things\nthat they needed other came to buy. So I took -- we had some covers and so on, and I figured\nwhatever it 1s, we don't need the covers any longer. And that would be the means for me to\nget some money. As I went to the market and I sold it and I'm on the way back to go back to\nthe apartment where we were. And next to the apartment, how things could sometimes fall in\nline, there was guy from my wife's town from Chita, and he was a baker and he had a bakery\nthere in Lodz. So one thing, if nothing else, we had bread. And he wouldn't take a nickel\nfrom us even for the bread. He was a dear friend of (sirens)... And he knew my wife's\nfamily quite well. So as I said, bread we had. Butter or any of the other things that we had to\ngo to obtain. So I sold it, that put a little money in my pocket at that time some of the things\nyou had. And while going, I take a look across the street from me. I see the same Major\nSpock on one of the streets going, and this is in Lodz. I almost felt in disbelief that I did not\nwant to trust my eyesight, that I had seen him. I says would they send somebody after me so\ndearly? For what, what I worth to them? But I asked no questions. When I saw him, I didn't\nwant to think of myself, that it's an oasis; I took it for real. Back then in Lodz, they have big\ndoors that they close up for at night and everybody is in, so you can drive in. And they have\na smaller doorway you can come through, and these big doors are just like it's the building 1s\nclosed off. I backed into one of these here and on the back of me to wait for a little while to\nlose sight of the man, and through a different way I started walking back home. I came home\nand tell my wife what had happened, and she says to me, \"What are you going to do?\" I says,\n\"I'm going to the organization.\" Understand, the organization of the partisans and Zionists'\norganization 1s being active, and people come to enlist themselves with them. Either those\nwho want to go for Israel, it already became active. I says, \"I cannot take chances to stay.\"\nShe says, \"Harold, we just heard yesterday through somebody\" -- every day people were\ncoming in -- that her father and her brother are trying to become over here. And we should\nstay in one place, so we can get together. The reason they couldn't go because his brother\nwho was taken to the army from the forest was supposed to be discharged, and he let them\nknow that he's coming back to Chita. So they were waiting, he was waiting for him. That's\nall he had left was one brother. And the family ties of those years were not like we know of\nties today, so that held him off. So I told her, I says, \"Make up your mind to remember who\nyou want to wait for, your father or for me to take a risk.\" I says, \"I will not take that risk, so\nlet me go and get registered.\" And I went to where they registered and told them what it was\nall entailed. They immediately told me where to go to an address. It was at the edge of town\nand over there was a closed, and it was like an underground organization again, which it was\na Zionist organization.",
        "A: That place -- I was told if you want to go and have passage to get somebody out to take care\nof you, go to this and this building and you'll find him. This kind of things went on all the\ntime. People wanted to run. People wanted to move. Legal ways to look was almost an\nimpossible -- next to impossible. So I came over there to that building with my wife. They\ntold us she cannot have no packages, so it was a good thing that didn't have mine because I\nsold it, other than what we had on our backs. And they told me that it's going to be a group of\na hundred guys together. They all were Zionists, young Zionists. All people of my age and\nmy wife's age. And it was meant, too, that we are going on the way to get into some\ncountries that we'll be able to get passage to come to Israel. The first destination was Prague,\nCzechoslovakia. Over here, we were sent to the Red Cross and will make documents\nbecause it's to go through. And the Red Cross made us documents as we were inmates and\nwanting to come back home. From every country we could not go to same. For instance, you\nhad to go through the Russian -- Russians were in Czechoslovakia, first of all important --\nand we wanted to go over to the British side or the American side was much further. But the\nBritish side was closer; it was in Austria. In Austria, there were the Germans -- I mean, the\nSoviets, while in Austria were also the British. And that's what our aim was, so you had to\nsay why do you want to go to Austria in Red Cross. Because at that particular time we acted\nthat we are Austrian Jews. You know, it was make up by this -- you couldn't tell the right\nthings because, otherwise, you did not know how about the KGB, is over here, too. So I\nbecame a man, same name -- because you didn't want to confuse the issues, but now I'm an\nAustrian Jew who is returning back home from the camps that I was freed. And that's how it\nwas, the whole thing. In Prague when we came, the Red Cross had a station and we were\ngiven food, and we're given shelter, if anything wanted, and they helped us with providing\ntransportation more. Our destination according now according to, you know, to the group\nevery 10 people had a head man. I was made the head of the 10 guys who were with me.\nAnd then we had a main commander. Our destination from Czechoslovakia was to go\nRomania to Budapest. And how you get passage, we did not want to be seen a hundred\npeople at one time, so we used to be in our group of the 10 and the other 10, and we used to\ncommunicate.",
        "A: No, I meant Budapest. Hungary.",
        "A: Originally, excuse me. I must clarify that. Originally, we were supposed to go to Romania.\nAt the last moment was changed to go to Budapest and get further notice. We came into that\ntrain and it was a packed train. There were nuns and Polish people of all sorts and who\nknows, maybe Czechs and everybody was traveling at that particular time. On the roof, the\nmen of us went up on the roof, to make sure there was a place for the women. So the women\nwere left sitting inside. The men were either on the platform or else they went up on the roof.\nOn the roof there five of us, all former partisans. We supposedly don't understand Russian\nbecause otherwise would have been a bad deal. And these Russians were drunk and they are\nstarting to talk amongst themselves that they are going to go downstairs to rape the women.\nAnd then to go ahead to steal, they would take baggages and everything like that. It's hard for\na person who hasn't lived through that era. Now, we had a quick decision to make. What do\nwe do? How do I know that my woman 1s not going to get involved, or his woman, the other\none or anything like that? We made a quick decision. We cannot let these two Russians go\ndown. Since we were five of us there, we sort of split it, two, two, and one and then cover.\nTo cover, they were three -- yeah, they were three, not two. And we figure when we come to\na bridge while the train is traveling, we push that one guy to the right side, the other two to\nthe left side, and the one comes back to help. And since they were drunk, we know we would\nhave no problem. But it was again taking a risky chance, what we're trying to do. And sure\nenough, as we came to a bridge within a couple of minutes we got rid of these drunks. And\nnow, we are driving, we couldn't wait till we get to Budapest because actually we are now\nwe are fugitives. We pushed -- who knows whether they got killed or didn't get killed, but\nwe couldn't allow ourselves to remain. Just maybe they will not, maybe they're just talking.\nYou know, it's too serious a thing, and knowing that we are on a mission with all of these\nhere things that we cannot tell the whole thing, what it's all about. And we came to Budapest.\nAs soon we came, we were told to be to the Community Israeli there, which it means the\nJewish Community. It was staged the first march of people to march to the consulate at that\ntime and protest demanding the United Nations to grant Israel as a state, and we were the\nfirst people of that time to do it. And remember, it was under the control of the Soviets while\nthe Soviets were not as evident to see. That's what it was -- the part not in Poland, not in\nCzechoslovakia, not in Hungary at that time were the Soviets as evident as when you went\non the street. You know you saw a soldier here and there and the other, and whoever were\ntheir own people we did not know for the rest. And after that march, we were brought into\nthe house, and over there they had them like bunk beds made up, and that was our place.\nThey had a kitchen so it was sort of like a community type life setup, and that was done in\nthe former school, the Hebrew school, near the temple. That's where they located us. Of all\nthings being together, the same rabbi who gave us the marriage at that particular time, he\nwas one in that group, too, with us. So they were sleeping underneath, and they were\nsleeping on the top. As things would have it, come by night when we were all sleep,\nsomething broke. I injured almost from that piece of wood that almost fell. It's only a sideline\nwhich it happened.",
        "A: ... some of this here that was going, so I said within a few days, we got our briefings and we\nhad to make new documents now. Now, we are traveling to Austria with another pretext, and\nall of a sudden we were turned out to be right now Greek Jews that we are going to, you\nknow, I mean, to look. Because we never wanted to tell the destination where we are going.\nIt was they never questioned why do you go round about ways. Maybe you should have\ngone some other ways, they didn't ask the questions. And it all was done by the Red Cross\nand the Red Cross was just going along with our wishes, you know, at that particular time.\nSo we had new documents now made. Everything is sealed, and they gave us to take along\nwith us salami. Everybody had to take so much salami and other things because we were told\nthat the food in Austria at the time was very critical, and especially there wasn't probably\nenough hunts for them to go out and get it. So while the means were in Austria, Austria was -\n- I mean, in Budapest, in Hungary, the means of foodstuff and everything like that was\neasier. So all of us had to give so much, we had to turn it in to the kitchen when we come to\nGrozny. We were ordered that only in groups of three, no more than three people, we should\npretend when we get off the train that we are people from the area. Not to draw any attention\nas stuff like this. People come off the train and they walked to their destination, we were\ngiven an outline of how to follow the strausses, that was the streets, until we reached their\nhotel. We all knew that the hotel was in the center, there was another nearby, so there was no\nmistakes. And above all, which I didn't mention before, while traveling like this here sort of\nas illegals, we used to get linguistic speaking. For instance, when we left Poland to\nCzechoslovakia, and from Czechoslovakia to -- we were forbidden to speak any Russian at\nall. We converse in Hebrew. We could converse in Yiddish; in Polish, it's fine. But Russian,\nfor one thing, no. Because we were supposedly going as inmates from concentration camps,\nand we had no reason to know Russian. Then we were, for instance, going now from\nBudapest to Grozny, you converse in Hebrew. He who doesn't speak Hebrew, speaks\nnothing, you know what I'm saying? Because we were as a different element it goes on, and\nall of that was briefed to like I say I was a headman of 10. So, in other words, you know\nwhat I mean, I was the leader of these 10 guys, and we all knew who the leader is, the main\nleader if any questions were.",
        "A: Absolutely. We didn't get all the instructions further than today, we are going from here to\nthere. At the end of this destination, we got new instructions, so if somebody would have\ncome to me and asked me, \"Where are you going from Budapest?\" I did now know until I\nwas told it's not Bucharest, but it's Grozny, you see. And we finally came to Grozny,\nsurrendered our food in the hotel, and then we had to beg for food later. I mean, why, what,\nwhere, no questions asked. It happens with organizations. When it becomes government\norganizations, it takes some of the normal ways -- it will never go, but that's what it was. In\nthat hotel, I met up one guy who was with us in the forest. He was with Captain Davidoff\n(ph), 1f you heard me mention with the easterners, that he was serving there with him. And\nhis wife and my wife and I, we knew them personally well, and somehow or other, we had\nour group of guys which it was partisans. We had some from our area, some other partisans\nwere from an area called Valin (ph), which is the Ukraine, the western part of Ukraine which\nagain was Poland before 1939. And we sort of everybody was linking with his own, sort of.\nAnd immediately we were taking sort of charge as the partisans\u2019 area. Hey, you need muscle\nguys? We are here and we are available and we have the means to do it and carry it out. So\nbefore long while we are going from Grozny, yeah from then Grozny in the hotel, we\nwere told nothing when you're leaving the hotel what -- nothing. What saw day by day that\ncertain faces are no longer around. So I come over to this guy, I'll refer to him as Lusik (ph),\nthat was his name. And I find out immediately, he tells me that he is a guide. He guides\npeople how to cross the border. The aim of it, I to find out, 1s to cross over to the British\nzone, and this was still have to be so quietly done because it was still the Soviet zone\noccupied in Austria in this part. Although later on, Grozny becomes, the Soviets retreat until\nthey readjusted the borders. So he told me he's a guide. I says, \"Hey, can you do anything for\nus? When are we going to leave? How long are we going to stay here?\" And he said, \"Don't\nrush. Nobody's going to remain. Everybody's going to sent out.\" And it sort of was very\nstrange, but, you know, you put two and two together you get to understand. The guys with\nmoney paid off and they were -- so he was telling me he was taken through the Elk\nMountains to cross over. All of a sudden, I was summoned in the office to come in. They\nsay, \"Harold, tomorrow 12 guys, all of the partisans male and female, you're going to get a\ndirection where to go. You're going to go across.\" We was supposed to from there take the\ntrain to Klagenfurt (ph). From Klagenfurt, we were supposed to come to the way near the\nriver. The river was the Mur. The Mur River 1s a narrow river, but a fast flowing river. And\nwe made a decision that we are going to form like a chain. One swimmer, one no swimmer.\nOne swimmer, one no swimmer. And I was leading the chain this here the 10 of us actually\nin a way by the time we stretch were almost, but not too far would we stand on this end of\nthe water to the other. But in order to hold as I'm starting to enter with my chain already\nlinked up, a galloping horse with a Soviet, \"Halt.\" And they saying halt in German, then in\nRussian \"Stoi.\" In other words stand still, halt. And the first thing he's starting to ask, \"Who\nis the leader?\" \"We don't have no leader.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"We're trying to go on the\nother side of the river to go over there. We're going to visit relatives, so that's our shortcut.\"\nHe picks me, he says, \"The rest of you stay here. You come with me.\" Comes with him.\nWhat do you think, I was arrested. So I figure now, I run a half of Europe over away, and\nhere I'm being arrested by the Soviets. Knowing their scheme of things and everything like\nthat, I figure ultimately they got me and now they'll have a good right to charge me for\ndesertion. My wife realizing what it is, and I say my words to her. I says, \"Please, you have\nto have somebody go back to Grozny. They must come and bail me out. You know, the\nsituation; we cannot wait days.\" So immediately as soon they arrest them, so two guys went\nto board a train and they came back to Grozny, and they started tending on the table. To\nmake a long story about two mile, they were from Grozny, back with money and I was\nbailed out. Now, where do we go? We come back to Grozny to the hotel. Now, I come to the\noffice and I get my group together. I says, \"You know, we are partisans, right? Don't dare try\nto ask us to fight because we'll make a fight here to no matter what it costs. If it means to\ndestroy the hotel, we'll destroy it.\" I says, \"My group is going to be sent and you see you\nhave Lusik, he is the guide; he is going to take it.\" \"But, Baba, you cannot do it.\" I says,\n\"Okay. I have men stationed at all the exits already, two men.\" I says, \"If you want to declare\nwar, we'll make it war nght away.\" So I says, \"My ultimatum is not to be changed.\" I says,\n\"The first group going out of here today is going to be my group. Whatever more you have, I\nam not interested. I cannot let myself to be chances.\" I says, \"I was bailed out this time, I\ndon't know what the next time will be.\" And I got Lusik to my side. I says, \"You heard what\nI said, huh? And believe me, I mean it. I'm not going to deviate.\" Okay, it's settled, and they\nsay Lusik and his wife, \"You and Sonja come to be with us.\" And they tell us we're going to\ngo into a barn. The barn is on the zone border. The Russians are going to try to search in this\nhere. If you don't hide well enough anything they'll take away. They were looking for\nanything, , gold, rings, whatever it is. They were plain robbing, and we were paying\nthem off anyways. The guide used to give them -- let's assume if he give them some money\nor Vodka, for a bottle of Vodka, you did a lot of things. And if you heard it said, it's not just\nsaid, it was a true fact. But I was standing -- my wife at that time had a ring, other things. So\nshe did it in the old plan. We had, you know, from knitting yarn, so she made a ball of yarn\nout of it, and whatever we wanted to hide, we put it on the inside. And with the needle, you\nknow what I mean, so it looks very innocent that you know in the midst of starting to knit\nsomething, and that's how we got. We did not have that much to hide to begin with, but some\nguys in the group -- not in my group so much as the other -- were people who had money,\nyou know what I mean, that they had -- how they got it, speculating my things it's none of\nmy business what they had. And now we came in there, we were one, two, three that the\nRussians, and the rest of the group were on the other side of the barn. And there within a few\nhundred feet or so we were on British territory. Instructions were given to us that we must\nwalk very quietly because we are going to enter a British camp. And that British camp was a\npart of the United Nation camps, and they are going to separate us, so prepare yourself. The\nBritish office ran their camps like that. The men separate, and the women separate. That's\nstill the old British ways. So here we got in our midst some guys, coming in New York, I\nknew them quite well. And those people started yelling, and I asked them please behave.\nYou were told it's the English zone, we must enter quietly, and we must not yell. What are\nyou doing? Looks Sheila's hiding some stuff, maybe gold or who knows from him, and she\nremained behind. And they're making yelling noise. And I asked them to please stop, they\ndidn't. I and two more guys grabbed the man by his hand and the other guy with the other --\nwe carried them in inside. There was a warm stove, we put them under the stove. After that\nthe group of guys saw that here's a bunch of rebels, which it was the partisans and each time\neach one of us would look back, we would be looked sideways, you know what I'm saying.\nAnd all of a sudden, it became quiet. We were in that camp for about two days, and one\nnight we were told to get ready because pick-up time is going to be tonight. The Fifth Army,\nwhich it was the British Army stationed there on the border of Austria and Italy, they had a\nbig group from the Israelis, or at that particular time, call them Palestinian Jews who were\nserving in the Fifth Army and that was supported by them. So they are the ones who were\nhelping us, in other words, getting into Italy from there. And this is what it was, it was\nbringing in from one type of camp to another international United Nation camps in\nexchange. But this is how the root was all worked out to bring people, you know, to each\ntheir destination, Palestine. They picked us up on that truck and brought us to their camp\nwhere they were already on the Italian side. Clovishia (ph) was the name of the big city\nnearby. And for the first time we sat down over there to eat at tables, and, you know, the\nlooks of challah, they served us challah. We couldn't get it over, sort of we are used to before\nthe war challah was served on a Saturday, Friday. But here in the middle of the day, you\nknow what I mean, weak challah and the food they served up, it was out of this world. We\nwere led in to take showers and clean up. It was just like somebody opened up the doors to a\nnew world in existence that we did not know existed. From there they took us into Bologna.\nIn Bologna, we were let to go in to join the international camps, which they were the Armra\n(ph), if you've heard about it. They were supported. In that, of course, they deloused us,\nexcuse me for saying, and everything like that. And we were waiting for assignment of\nwhere, but it was warm in Italy in that part at that time of year. So literally in a park, we were\njust with bundles on our back, whichever one had something to cover himself to sleep on and\nwe were on the streets. The next day that we were there in Bologna in that place in that\ncamp, rather, 5,000 armed trucks were brought in which they were survivors of the\nMauthausen camps. Among all these people in the camps, my wife recognized an uncle of\nhers, his brother. We were last thing -- he was living in Slonim, not in the same town at that\ntime because that's where he got married. He was living there. So now we begin to see\nliterally face-to-face survivors from concentration camps and at this moment on the way it\nhappened that as soon he got registered, we kept ourselves together. We made like a family.\nNow, we are a family of three, and our next destination from there was Verona. From\nBologna, we were sent to Verona.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: They were just brought from Mauthausen.",
        "A: There wasn't one of them who looked normal. When I mean \"normal,\" one was swollen. One\nwas almost dying, you know what I'm saying, and one had more strength than the other. And\nit just was a matter of how badly you were damaged while being there before the Americans\npicked them up. Because remember, Mauthausen was -- and Buchenwald and all of this here\nwere liberated by the American Army, and that was the zone -- you know, it was zones\ndivided at that time. In Italy, for instance, there were the British, the Polish Army, there was\nalso the American Army.",
        "A: The reaction would be just like you come to a museum in a wax museum, and you see faces.\nAnd you almost pretend you see a living beings. That's what the people appeared to us in the\nfirst day. Within a short while, the picture changed to the better because those who needed\nhelp, hospitalization or whatever it is, were hospitalized. We kept ourselves with the uncle of\nmy wife right there, and he didn't step away from us and we didn't from him. And our next\ndestination was not so much where the camp wanted to send us to, but our leader which\nwanted us to be transferred was to Modena. And in Modena they gave us where it was a\nmilitary academy before, they gave us that academy to make houses. And all these people,\nwe were together over 6,000 people a group, all coming there, that was territory of the\nAmericans. So mind you, within a few feet away from us there were a camp from German\nprisoner of wars. And since we were brought there, every day started, you know, throwing\nwith bottles, throwing with rocks. Just the face to look of these Germans. Of course, the MPs\ndid not want a bit about it, and we started to say to the MPs, \"Either you relocate us, or you\nrelocate them. We cannot stand and be idle or do nothing like this here looking at yesterday's\nNazis who they did what they did to us.\" And what they did, they kept us in that camp and\nthey relocated. Within one day they emptied out the POW camp, and they took them away to\nanother place. And the military academy became ours, and life in that military academy,\nwhat can I tell you, it was on the floor. Wherever there was room you saw people. At night it\nwas used to ensue fights because one would step on each other going through. So it was\nanother way of being in a camp. To us who were in the partisans who didn't go through that\ntype of camps, it was a new way of life. We had a small room. In that small room, let's see,\nthere was I with my wife. There was another couple, I have even some pictures if -- you\nknow what I mean, from there if you sometimes will be interested, I'll let you make copies of\nthat. So they were telling -- that place over there in a single room, we were more than three\nfamilies. I mean, there singles, a few guys and there was another family who -- she comes\nhere in the wintertime. Her husband is no longer alive. And they were with us in that room in\nModena. And it was mixed children, I mean if you joined the administration, they made an\nadministration. So they came under the administration. And for the first time I had the\nopportunity to see a young lady from Britain coming in the name of, again, Jewish Tradition\nCommittee (ph). The American joined and they came to the administration trying to find out\nwhat kind of help that they can provide. And we tried to tell them where do want to start? Do\nyou need blankets? I says, \"Of course, we need blankets.\" Do you need this -- my demand to\nthem was at that time they must get the children out of this camp firsthand. Within a few\ndays, since in Italy sex for money was available, some youngsters, yesterday's survivors\nfrom the camps, wound up with venereal diseases. And we realized that mixture and makeup\nof women who were married and women maybe who were pregnant and young children, you\ntake this young child of 15 or 16 who survived the camp, that kid cannot be easily told by\nsomebody what to do. And they listened to us, I even have a picture to show it, where one\nday they took all the youngsters out and they took them away to another place making a\nkibbutz really. But that was a place where the youngsters were taken out and those who were\nvenereal stricken with venereal disease had to be, of course, hospitalized. But it was a new\nstory of my life to live in a camp which I did not want the best of it to take, you know what I\nmean, but you had to do the best under the administration.",
        "A: Literally, we were a few months in there because of the ensuing thing. As in now had started\nbecause they wanted to have leadership to know to go on. We knew there would be\nforthcoming more of the refugees. And I at that time was transferred to Milano. Near Milano\nin Italy we had on a farm area over there, that it was an official seminar, my wife went with\nme. And we had various speakers because it was a big political issue in Israel. While they\nwanted to save as many to get to Israel, it was at that time who and on which side will these\npeople join? Are they going to join the Jabotinsky side, or are they going to go with the Ben\nGurion side? And with the Israelis it was immediately, number one, and that's what it started.\nThat seminar started to teach us, us the future , the leaders, because I became a\nleader and a kibbutz. That was my best way of working my way out from the camp, you\nknow what I mean. Meanwhile I was assigned a place, and that was a training place. We\nstarted -- it was on a farm area. We started to teach people how to ride on tractors, how to do\nfarm work, while we provided this farm work for free. But it gave us a place of starting of\nhow to prepare until they would come with a truck and pick so many of them up, and they\nwere ready illegally to be shipped out be by boat or other ways to destination Palestine.",
        "A: The Anwar could not know anything about it at all. The old Anwar was given support in the\ncamps. Outside of the camps, we in many instances was the only support whatsoever. I did\nnot get back in support until I come back later in the story to Florence when my wife became\npregnant.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. It was you take care of your what you can. The only thing you sign, which\nthey made us sign is that nobody 1s going to go to get a job. It was forbidden for any of the\nrefugees or the displaced persons 1n these camps, that's what the international organization\nguaranteed them. Because we were so hungry for things, we would probably do the same\nthing as it went on in Asia and everything like that. Work for next to nothing and ruin Italian\nworkers because of that. So that agreement was made available to us that we cannot go to\nlook jobs. The only thing our guys started to do, they started black marketeering. And, you\nknow, like those flea market you know to be in this country, you find a lot of flea markets in\nEuropean countries. And flea markets is how to control, people don't buy license, you know\nwhat I'm saying. And that's what the way was with some, and some of them were arrested by\nthe Italian government for doing, because I once -- I'll tell you the story later. Once I got in\ntouch with family here, my relatives rather, they used to send me packages. And cigarettes\nwas the best thing they're demanding for me to get. Not because of my habit of smoking,\nbecause cigarettes were like dollars in the bank. To sell a carton of cigarettes was nothing,\nyou know what I mean, it was the easiest to do. And it is money, the food was available in all\nsorts. But we were getting support through the international organization, and our people\nunfortunately did not know how to use it. You talk to these people about oatmeal, oatmeal in\nEurope until we came to Italy was not made as oatmeal flakes. But in the United States, that\nwas the means so these people were used to 1f you want to make oatmeal soup, you had the\nkernels; you don't have this here. So what was the place, we used to take things like this to\nthe marketplace and sell. They would give us condensed milk, you know. What do we do\nwith condensed milk? Nobody now who were in those countries knew of a such a thing as\ncondensed milk. Milk comes from a cow, and that's what you know about it. But there is no\nsuch thing. Powdered milk we knew because the Soviets used powdered, you know, soups\nand so on. Did you have anything here to ask me at this point?",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "A: So as I aforementioned, I was working with the camp administration in Modena, Italy. I\nworked for a while, and became very, very disgusted since help was not forthcoming so\nsoon. The only good part for me to remember about Modena with the American soldiers\nbeing there because in my worst way, I wanted to communicate now with United States to\ntell a sister to my mother, my aunt -- she's still altve. She's in a home here. I just visit her\nyesterday, as a matter of fact. And she had a letter in her possession which I knew that my\nmother was pleading her that she should save me and see to make papers like would come to\nthe United States. She filled out her wishes before the war in 1939, and I believe I\naforementioned it in part that I was awaiting my passage in September, but Hitler disrupted\nme by declaration -- not the undeclared war in September, when it broke up. So all I\nremained now is we just had past story to tell about it. And I wanted at this time not just to\nlook for relatives, but to tell them where I am. That was impossible to send out from Modena\nat that time mail. The mail was still being organized. Remember we are talking about the late\npart in May, and I'm talking maybe perhaps right now in June of 1945. Where everything\nwas just unfolding with the end of World War II, and a lot of it started sort of a new life\nagain. So while the soldiers used to come to camp be from the MP and the others, and\nAmerican boys, soldiers that had cameras, they were very curious about us. And finding out\nthat we were the survivors and what it was, so they would come, get involved in\nconversation. And one day, I find a soldier and I take a look by his looks, I says, \"Are you\nJewish?\" I didn't speak English, I spoke Italian already at that time, and I spoke Yiddish with\nhim. So he says to me, \"Yes,\" in Yiddish. I says now that's the perfect man I want to. I says,\n\"I want from you one thing. To get in touch with an aunt of mine that she lives in Chicago.\"\n\"Chicago? Oh, I come from Chicago.\" And I tell him the address. I remembered that address\nby heart, because that was the way in Europe it was to continue into knowledge. I used to --\nmy mother used to make write a few sentences to my aunt, and, therefore -- and write the\naddress. So this was the aunt, she was a favorite of mine as a child. And therefore for writing\nfor so many times, I remembered 4455 North Drake Avenue, Chicago by heart. Did not have\na zip code in those years, but the rest of it, I knew. So I said to his soldier, I says, \"Please, I\nbet you I drove my aunt nuts by now because somebody would go to Moscow, I would tell\nthem here's the address. Drop in the mail and say it, 'Your sister's oldest son, Harold, is\nalive.\"\" Somebody here would go to Carmos (ph), whatever it is. So she got all this here over\nhere, and she almost went out of her cotton-picking mind. What am I doing? So when I got\nthis soldier, I say to her, I says, \"I hope she received, tell her, all my messages from before.\nTell her I'm in this camp. You know how to describe the address. You know it's the military\nacademy of Modena. And maybe you would let me use your mail until the post office will be\nestablished that I can maintain a correspondence with her.\" He says, \"Oh, they'll be no\nproblem.\" I gave him my name and I referred to, you know what I mean, the way it was and\ntried to tell her, I wrote to her in Yiddish because I knew that the best way. So I says she can\nput it in it, and I told her in short, I says who I am and I'm the only one who survived,\nremained alive. I'm right now in Italy in Modena and through the help of an American\nJewish soldier, I was able to mail it to you. It took about maybe two weeks or three weeks,\nand I got -- because the post for the army was going fast. It was not as it was for civilian. I\ngot -- he brought me a response and an answer that she got it all and now she wants to know\n-- now she's starting lecture me. Which, God bless her, that's what she used to do. She says,\n\"Harold, if you're single, stay single. If you're married, try not to have any children. But let\nus get in touch closer, we'll see to make papers to bring you.\" At that particular time, it\nsounded like remote, even to us. And here I had to go ahead to have sort of a correspondence\nmisunderstanding with her. I'm not ready to come to America, I say at that time, I want to go\nto Israel. And she kept on pleading I was full of flame and fire, but going to Palestine. And\nhere I'm trying to get to her not to make papers for me. So I tried to say I cannot ask you to\nmake papers yet at this time, but I'll keep it in mind. When I'm settled, I'm going to let you\nknow. In the meanwhile, whatever you want to help me otherwise, and I don't tell her in this\nfirst letter that I'm married and I'm in this, that and the other. I did not want to write too much\non a piece of paper somebody, you know what I mean, lets me use his mail. So in this letter\nwhen I got to read it, you can imagine how my wife felt at that particular time. Don't get\nmarried; don't have children. Little did I know that a little while later in about six months\nlater, we'll find out that my wife is pregnant, too. And that was peace at that time. That's why\nshe made -- three times she made papers until she made the proper papers. While she didn't\nwant to listen to me, she made papers for me as a single person. When she got more letters\nthat I'm married, so now she started to make in two names because we didn't tell her that my\nwife is pregnant. Why tell her? It was a remote thing we did not know. So then she had to\nmake the third time the papers when my daughter was born and she was born in Florence. So\nall in all, from Modena, I sought to join a seminar now for leadership seminar, which it was\ncreated at that time. And we had speakers from us one very outstanding Professor Garfinkel,\nwhich he became my idol for a while. And at that particular time, we were with mixed\nemotions. How do we train in the kibbutz these illegals when they come there? Everybody\nwanted them to be on their party, but 1t was not a one-way party who was helping the DPs at\nthat time. Bother parties were helping, and you had speakers on both sides to do.",
        "A: Correct. The . In other words, both sides wanted to hunt new blood. You know, they\nwere actually hunting for new memberships and affiliations. I'll never forget one of the\nspeeches, it was so many years later by Professor Garfinkel. And I tried to ask a lot of people\nthat question when it was posed, and nobody could answer it. What does terror mean? And a\nlot of people lose themselves to answer the question. His idealism as a professor speaking to\nus, which he used, terror is an expression by a strong -- like he brought out Germany, like he\nbrought out the Soviet Union -- who has nothing to lose and he can get involved 1n terror.\nTerror is also a means by someone who cannot lost anymore either because he has nowhere\nto go, so it's as a last resort. So he tried to say in his speech, Professor Garfinkel at that time,\nthat Israel at this time is not in a way that she has a lot to lose. So, therefore, by going to go\nahead and extend terror at that particular time, we may lose what we achieved. So, therefore,\nwe should go ahead and train our people who go to Israel that they should join the left,\n, the Labor Party, which they were anti-terrorists instead of joining the right,\nwhich it was the Jabotinsky people who were pro-terror, that was their way of driving the\nBritish out and free the land. As we all know the outcome in 1948 after big maneuvers and\neverything like that, Israel was granted statehood. Well, all through this time we had a big\nproblem as of to prepare the newcomers to Israel that they should be aware of what's going\non at least on both ends and let them make an intelligence like that. So every time while I\ngained at that time leadership to become a leader for my kibbutz, and that kibbutz was not to\nfar from Modena. I successfully sent away from there a few groups, that they were trained\nand the training meant in a way almost brainwashing. Tell them what's going on while\nteaching him certain trades, and being the kibbutz was always meant to do something and in\na grand way. And since we made a kibbutz to be near farms, so it was good for us that we\nwere away from the city. We could do more things that we wanted to do while the city, the\ngovernment would not allow us for these here things. And this is the way a network was set\nup of people to be sent illegally to bypass the British, because the British white paper came\nout at that time which forbade for the Jews even as the DPs to come legally to Israel. So\nthat's what had stopped a lot of escaping before the war broke out, and that's what had\nstopped afterwards. But by hook or by crook, illegals were available. These same people\nwho faced the war and faced all its tribulation were ready to go back to Israel under all\ncircumstances possible, and a lot of them did give their life right there in the first battles that\nensued before Israel became a state. Others survived and they remained Israeli citizens and\nprovided a good home for themselves and for their offsprings. But the fact remains that these\npeople that after going through all the agony of war, being in the camps, us, the partisans\nfrom the forest, did not stop to say enough 1s enough. But they still were willing to give their\ngiven years what they had with them to go to fight for a cause. So again, we became new\nsoldiers to go out and fight for Israel at this time, and no longer for our personal things\nourselves and that was all about. I did successfully have a few kibbutz and any time I ask my\nsuperiors when is my turn to go, \"No, we still need you. We still need you.\" They kept on\nknocking it down. \"You get legal passage to Israel and you'll get it.\" One day I come and I\nhave the new good news to break to them. I used to come to Rome or Milano, and we were\nnear Milano, Milano was our point. And I tried to tell them, \"I have good news and bad\nnews. I said the good news 1s that I'm going to become a father. The bad news is I'm on the\nroad, how can I go ahead to do this here?\" And I did one thing which I want to admit to\nmyself at that time again, a personal thing. When I found out that my wife is pregnant, I took\ntime off. We knew that in Italy, there was some of the doctors from our forest that were with\nus. And there were two doctors over there, Rockover (ph) and Mastnig (ph) which that's how\nhe was he called. They both were surgeons, they saved a lot of lives during the war. And that\nwas in Venice or Venezia, the way it's called in Italian. They were living in a hotel. I took\nmy wife and made a trip to Venice, ready to do an abortion. I'm glad she's not present, she\ndoesn't like for me to talk about it. And we knew that it was done, just like in the forest. Dr.\nMastniq, as a matter of fact, died here a couple of years ago in Florida. He says, \"Yes, we are\ndoing it, Harold, but we won't do it to you.\" I says, \"Why? Please, I cannot afford to have a\nchild nght now.\" He says, \"First, yet you cannot afford for your wife to have an abortion.\" I\nsays, Why?\" He says, \"Look, there's a chance if we abort the first time that she may not be\nable to bear children. You will not be happy not to have a family.\" And I stopped begging\nhim, I understood it. And we both went home brokenhearted which later on in years in New\nYork when I used to come to visit my father-in-law in the summer months with the\ngrandchildren, and one day I go to my father-in-law, he says, \"I'm going to say hello to Dr.\nMesnick (ph).\" I come into there and I show him my daughter. He said to me, \"Is that what\nyou tried to destroy?\" I begged him not to talk about it because I did not want my daughter\neven to know. She was too young even to be talked about a subject like this here at the time.\nBut it was sort of how much all the agony I could get, I even got it from this part, too, in the\nright way, and it was -- I was a joyful person after that. Seeing that there is life and we got\nthe rebuilding to do. The only thing we had to stop at second child. My son was born in\nChicago; it was due to both children my wife had to have two Cesarean sections. And the\nbirth of daughter in Florence, Italy was a hard story to tell him. So he gave me the same\ndoctor, Manonovich (ph) was his name, he was also a refugee who survived from Greece,\nthe camps. And he gave me a letter when I told him we are going to America, and he says,\n\"Please, don't have her suffer. When you come to America, give that letter to a doctor. So if\nyour wife gets pregnant again, let her not go through with her pain.\" And little did I realize\nthat the same Cesarean section with my wife, by 5 o'clock in the afternoon, she got up, put\nher lipstick on, and it was, again -- in Italy, she was in a Catholic hospital, the maternita. She\nwas in the hospital for a whole month. And talking the way people were nice to us,\nespecially the Italians, they immediately understood that I was Jewish. Most likely, I'm\nkosher; they did not serve any kosher food. They couldn't bring it in. Because I gave them\nthe chocolates that I used to, Nestle's and Hershey that my relatives used to send me and the\ncigarettes, they permitted me, first of all, to have a bed in the hospital so I could be with my\nwife all the time. I could bring in food from the outside like chicken, and they permitted me\nto set up there that I could cook for her soup and a piece of chicken. So she had her means.\nSo it's undescribable to see it, 1t was a Catholic church, but Italians were very gracious to the\ndisplaced persons who came there after the war. And I thought I want to bring that out\nwhenever I have an opportunity to tell about it and I just did. So when I came telling them\nthat, they said, \"Well, wait. You can still be working.\" A few months later, my wife at that\ntime must have gone into the eight months or so. They say to me, \"Now, with your group,\nyou're going to be taken.\" I says, \"I with my group? No, I'm not risking two lives. My group\ncould be sent,\" and I says, \"I want to be -- from now on, I'm going to go to Florence.\"\nFlorence, Italy was kept through the United Nations and all the other organizations as a place\nfor the sick and the pregnant. In there we had the facilities and the Jewish community in\nFlorence was very supportive about it to oversee as to find us villas and so on. And they\nwould give us a lot of voluntary help to go on, so that we had a clinic there where a doctor\nwere on the premises all the time. And the pregnant women, as understandable, were an\nimportant issue at the time. We saw so much destruction and we wanted to see a fulfillment\nof replenishment. So we were under good car, so if anybody was pregnant and they wanted\nto be in Florence, it was an open city, like send them there. Then we turned back into the\nUnited Nations, to Anwar, they used to get each month so much money, which individually\nwe couldn't live on it. But while we were living like in a kibbutz, we could provide it. I went\nback to a kibbutz, but this kibbutz were really of people who were not going to Israel, but\nthey were waiting for passage to any other country that would accept them. And the majority\ndid register to go, like I at that particular time registered to go the United States. And we\nused to take, all of us, put in the money to sort of like a family, you know, together.\nEverybody would get certain things we would sell because we could not adhere ourselves to\nthe Italian foods. Spaghetti was a new issue to us. Polish people don't eat spaghetti; they eat\nother foods, but not spaghetti. The only thing in pasta we knew was, you know, to make\nother things, but not spaghetti. So it was a new diet and it was new things. So we used to\nhave everybody served in the kitchen, woman or man took their turn. And which we used to\nhave a collective kitchen, and we would sit down in the dining room. And we were culturally\n-- which I have pictures to prove that whatever we wore. We did not just seen to come there\nand just have our meal, and we were creative in the same way. And I awaited passage until I\nleft. Let's see, in 1948 in February, I got passage, and that's when I came to New York.",
        "A: No, that one I say I joined it, again, it was the form of a kibbutz created on another kibbutz\nlike, well, like it was in the...",
        "A: Correct. It was a collective living type. And we referred to them -- you know, which I have\nthe pictures. I will show them to you, which we called it a kibbutz. Kibbutz Alvet, which we\ncalled it, which it was a part of the labor movement in Israel and it was culturally when on.\nBut we worked it in means of a kibbutz that way, that we would share the responsibility\ntogether. We would all work together for all things that needed to be done. So it needed to be\ndone cleaning, our own people did the cleaning and cooking.",
        "A: Okay. We had found over there room enough in the villa that we were living to make like a\nsynagogue inside of it. And believe it not, one year for the High Holidays when I was the\none who was doing the pray conducting, the prayers as a cantor. And right up to the holidays\nwhen I got the visa, everybody was joking, saying, \"You see, you prayed well. It\nimmediately worked.\" So...",
        "A: It felt more than good, because like I say understanding that , which means I\nbelieve and being Jewish, this was the biggest expression by the survivors to give. Much\nmore than any Jew any part in the world who did not through Hitler. Because we were the\nones that when we came back and say we believe, that we don't come back with sort of\nblaming God for what had happened. But the majority was when we come the conclusion\nthat we always ask so where was man? Why look for the invisible? Why look to the thing\nthat we don't know who and where? But we do know where man 1s. We do know that man\ndid not care including the United States did not give a helping hand to stop. They did not\nopen their doors for immigration. We know the facts that even the St. Clures (ph) when they\ndocked which it was a movie made, \"The Voyage of the Damned.\" And a few among the\npeople could not be saved even to let into the United States. So you can understand that any\none of us who wanted to return back to Jewish life, who wanted to start praying again did a\nbig issue with himself that we justified ourselves and we turned our anger, not to God, but\nour angered returned to man. And any time whenever I wrote something about it or I spoke, I\nstill ask the same question. So where was man in those days? And I still feel justified with\nmy question. Not to ask where God was or where God is or what did God do, I would not\nwant to find out that there is a God who really tried to have us punished because of\nsomething we did wrong. Because I believe that God 1s referred to me as a father. God 1s\nreferred to me as a person who loves me as a father, and, therefore, this type of god cannot\ngo ahead to ask that I should be killed, murdered, maimed, all of these here things for\ndisobedience. A father does not ask for that. A father does not even want to surrender his\nchild for something little bit he did to community. So when you say the return back to\nbelieve was easy perhaps at once, but you felt something is missing in our life that we\nsurvived. And I believe religion was one of the basic things that we sought and we found\nourselves in. I have a lot about any results saying in many instances, but I don't want to --\nthis is not the place.\nVideographer: We've got about five minutes, but I need to stop.",
        "A: Red light.",
        "A: I see red lights. Is that supposed to be the red lights?\nVideographer: Yeah, we're rolling.",
        "A: No, I'm not.",
        "A: I wanted to make a point, and I'll read already it one more time. I said God 1s invisible to us.\nWe don't know where he is or what he 1s, but it's part of our belief. That is, the\n, | believe. What I believe in something really that other than created by man\nafterwards that we don't have a way of following the Moses or the things like that. But the\nHolocaust, per se, I do no want to make that a God issue, that God punished the Jews, that's\nwhy it happened or any other ways. I rather would turn to the things that is visible to us. Man\nis visible to us. We know, the mere fact that Germany, being the most cultural place of\nEurope at the time it happened could produce such an evil man as Adolph Hitler. And there\nwasn't enough, after all the tries that they tried to get rid of him, to rise up against him and\ndestroy him. After what he did to Germany besides what he do in the process to so many\nmillions of non-Jews as well as the six million Jews who he was having a war against the\nJews. So that's my interpretation. I cannot see the Holocaust in any other way or form as the\nwar against the Jews because at any time, the preparation legally he got them through\nNuremberg to make everything legal what he did afterwards. Which I mean at this time, the\nhumanization program, the right of taking away from all of them that they're not even\nhumans; they're subhumans. And, therefore, he prepared it so that the people should not feel\nthat they're doing an injustice, but the people are getting rid of a menace or something, it's\nnot so. So when man let one person, one person's religion, if you -- I want to call it a religion,\nbecause he believed in it, in Nazism -- go as far as it was worded to let destroy people and\ndestroy their offspring and so on. How can I turn to ask for -- to look for the invisible or the\nperson that I cannot speak personally or ask him questions? This is why my conviction past\nWorld War II, past the Holocaust, remains that believing in the invisible, believing in the\nJewish theology, believing in all the creation, that this did is something worth analyzing\nagain, and it's something worth living. And I remain Jewish, that's a fact. I almost tried to get\naway with it as I told in my chapter. And I'm happy till this day with the conviction I made\nnot to work against the tide, but to go with the tide. And I feel very comfortably today that I\ndo not ask the Almighty what he did.",
        "A: Perhaps it's hard for you to memorize what we did earlier, but I did tell you in the most\nhorrendous days of my life being in the ghetto, that I was exposed and be with a brother to\nmy father and he was a rabbi. And I have told you the way he was speaking to me, that we\nmust go on and doing it because in the 14th century with the , God had so much\nfaith in the Jewish people that he could put them to an exposure like he did, and he had the\nfaith in them that they will not convert for the sake of remaining living people. But much\nrather they were strong enough to say no. Do you want to be Jewish? And they remained\nJewish. And, you see, the fleeing rabbis felt so distasteful with the trying to enforce on them\nthat they threw on, as we call it, a herem. A herem means forbidden. That it was forbidden\nfor Jews to return back to Spain, even after the change of government and rather because it\nwas off limits sort of to speak as in modern language we would say for Jewish to continue\nalive over there.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, when I was fighting in the forest, to me he was already gone. I don't know, he was\ntaken to another city. In Slonim ghetto, they sort of had a hospital. He was...",
        "A: Okay. Firstly, let's remember what I said to you in the other words.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay, all right. Being the fact that I was in a Soviet underground, for me to think religiously\ncould have been a bad way about it because religion was a no-no in the Soviet system. So\neven in the forest, we had the politicians come back to us when the paratroopers showed up\nand the whole idea of brainwashing restarted again. So for me to think at that time\nreligiously would have been the biggest crime I could have done after to myself, speaking in\nthe first undertone. Now, in my inner sanctum, did I think of religion? I used to look at the\nstars at night. Being around and doing something and seeing the moon shining, and I would\nsometimes say, \"God, can't you do something for me?\" So to answer whether I totally\ndissipated or got away from that, no. That little spark was in me. And I remember when I\nwent out of that ghetto going to the forest, a prayer went up to me. No more like when Jacob\nran away from his brother, Esau. And he sort of tried to make a contract with God. Say, \"If\nyou save me, I will be your servant for all the duration of my life.\" That night, with moon\nand the stars my witnesses, that's what my prayer was. And maybe he listened. But I did\nsurvive, but I didn't survive to fail him; I survived to go on, and I will go on like that. I feel\ncomfortable to bring Jewishness and religion into my house and through my family I have\nbeen a member of a synagogue all through the years being in America, even at times 1t was\nhard financially to do so. So on that question I must say I feel good about it, without asking\nthe questions. To me, it feels the same thing as if a young person gets killed. It's a pain, but\nyou don't keep on brooding on it for all your life. When you're reminded, you feel the pain\nagain. But you try to go with your life without brooding on it all the time. That's the best\nanswer I can give when it comes to the religious during the war and especially after the war.\nI'm happy that there are still Jews in this world who want to go on and live as Jews.",
        "A: \"Torn Between Tyrants.\"",
        "A: In my life as a youngster on through coming to the United States, I stumbled every time on a\ntyrant. Be the tyrannical part of Hitler, be the tyrannical part that I've seen before Hitler\ninvaded Poland that I've seen from the Nationalist Party, be it the time when I used to go to\nschool and rocks was thrown at me by children who lived in the neighborhood. Not because\nI did anything to them, but it was always that one answer, you are a Jew. And it sort of\nbecame a theology, being a Jew means you got to pay in any kind of way. So even rocks\nthrown at you means part of you because it's not thrown at you because you are Harold; it's\nthrown because the Jewish -- you are a Jew. So I cannot help it but go on in the way I'm\ndoing. It looks like it's over. You're ready?",
        "A: This is one part I tried to bring out. I, for instance, always had to challenge a tyrant. To me,\nthe tyrant was when I remember one day during the war when I was with my grandfather\nfrom my mother's side. And it was a debate at that time whether I shouldn't be let go to\nVilna, so in Vilna I could meet up with the American Counsel, I can perhaps go to the\nUnited States. At that particular time, my father would not permit me to go on my own, so he\nsays, \"See if your grandfather, after all, he's got all his children there, if your grandfather will\ntake you to go with him, then you can go. Otherwise, I will not permit it.\" And that was the\ndecision making that we had to take out a passport because the law came out whoever wants\nto stay here in the Soviet Union must obtain a passport. That's the rule of the land. Those\npeople who do not wish to take out passport can return back to Germany which it was sort of\na critical kind of way. And there was some who did not wish to remain under Communist\nregime, and they went and signed up to go back to Germany -- to the occupied Poland under\nGermany. And the fortunate thing that had happened at a later time was an unfortunate thing\nit happened then. The KGB rounded them up by night on trucks and loaded them into trains,\nand to Siberia they went. Those people survived the whole war. Some of them were drafted\nto the army, they were of age. Otherwise, they could join later on into the Polish Army that\nStalin created into. And so a bad thing of yesterday became a good thing for tomorrow, but\nat the time there was a tyrannical thought and a tyrannical thing that I grew up with. And\nwhen I and my grandfather together went 1n to have a passport, the captain and the police\nstarted yelling it \"How come\" -- he didn't ask a question why you didn't come any earlier and\nstuff like that. But in a blistering voice he sort of dared to speak so loud to my grandfather,\nwhich my grandfather still had the beard. He always had the beard long enough to remind\nme of Casimir, The Great, one of the Polish kings that were in existence. And I always used\nto refer to him, in jokingly speaking, which he wouldn't tolerate that, of course. So again,\neven a little 1tem like that over why we were late and I come and making the passport. I\ncouldn't tell him I wanted to escape to go to Vilna maybe wind up in America, that would be\nthe wrong thing. So I saw sort of tyranny in the workings. Afterwards when I decided to be a\ngood boy through school and I volunteered to go to do certain jobs, and I started believing\nthat working make a person better and everything like that, I volunteered to go to work on\nthe factory level. It was near Bialystok where they were building housings for the military at\nthat particular time. I was a frail, in a way of speech, young guy who never did do hard labor\nwork. The hardest thing in labor I did was sawing, chopping wood or sawing that thing for\nthe purpose. Being a Zionist, it used to be a summer type of chore that you wanted to go help\nthem. The money that we were paid we used to put it sort of cooperatively, be able to go to a\nsummer camp where we was practicing Zionist scouting and so on and so forth. But I wasn't\nused to carry a wheelbarrow like, you know, that you had to be the husky kind of guy. And I\nlasted two weeks, and while being there again, I found tyrannical ways. All of a sudden\nwhen all the preaching to me was equality and Socialism, there I found out for the first time\nof my young life that they had rates of pay. One guy for the same work was rated one kind of\na pay. One kind -- the other guy was rated maybe less or more. Now, that was not Socialism,\nthat was not Communism; that was Capitalism. I was smart enough to understand it from my\nschool years when those subjects were taught in school about what Capitalism is and what\nSocialism is. So again, in my own young mind then and even up till today, 1t was sort of a\ntyrannical kind of a way, okay? And each time later with Nazis entering in the same way and\ngoing through the selections, right and left, and being beaten up, and being taken to Slonim\nto jail, and then winding up in a work labor camp until the partisans freed us. All I saw was\ntyranny, and then I finally am the free man and I'm in the forest. I'm already -- every time I\nturn around, I still see anti-Semitism. I still see all kinds, that people are sort of valueless\ninstead of being valuable. You know how hard we thing about today when we hear an\naccident one person dead, a child died, or be from an airplane or anything like that, it makes\nfont page headlines and everything like that. Look how life meant through that era of years,\nbe on the Soviet side, be on the Nazi side, life was meaningless. For a guy to kill somebody\neven in the forest, he did not have to wait for a court martial as it was later years organized\nwhen the paratroopers, and all of a sudden life became -- be a little bit more with a meaning.\nThey couldn't go ahead, just pick the pistol and kill somebody. They had to stand trial. Even\nthe police and Germans that we captured as POWs, they were not just taken out and shot.\nThere was a trial. It was conducted in front of -- at least to make it look like a trial. So again,\ntyranny is in work, so no matter how I put myself together in the picture when I started to\nwrite about it, I though the best title for it would be \"Torn Between Tyrants.\" I remember\none time, it entered my mind -- and as a matter of fact, I even wrote a poem naming it like\nthis here -- \"Memories That Linger On.\" But I did not find that to be strong enough to\ndescribe my living at a time and all I went through to be just memories that linger on.\nEverybody has memories lingered on. But \"Torn Between Tyrants\" stood up to me because\nreally that's what I was telling in my story, and I am telling it today the same way.",
        "A: It justifies me of the past; however, I divorced myself of the tyrannical seeing and feeling\nunless I talk about the Ku Klux Klan, and I find that even in a free society as we live in the\nUnited States, that in order for us to be free, we must tolerate even the people who are not\nworthy to be tolerated, but that is really our freedom. Therefore, therefore, I am not faced\nwith a tyrannical way unless I think, just think of the story with Skokie when the Nazis\nwanted to come and march. In part, listening and seeing that people have still this kind of gut\nfeeling in them to do to prove that Hitler was right is tyranny to me. Because again as I say,\nwhere is man to understand man? If I'm right, I'm right; and if I'm wrong, at least point me\nout where I'm wrong. You cannot always live by the lying propaganda about it. So \"Torn\nBetween Tyrants\" is not any longer a part of my life, but 1t was definitely a part of me and\npart of my life between the late '30s until liberation came and then after until maybe until I\nfelt differently when I came to the United States.",
        "A: Let me bring in a little story over here. We know for a fact that on many occasions that it\nhappened. That Hitler tried to use the partisans in focus among Jews, so what they did on a\nfew occasions send Jews to go. And they wired them, like I said -- not wire them as we\nunderstand it of today. With certain criteria, they supplied them where to go and they'll take\nyou in. And your job will be to remember some of the things and come back, as their\nlocation, what are they involved, how much ammunition do they have, and so on. And I\ncannot attest to this moment that it was anti-Semitism because I was not there listening to the\ntrial or anything like that. But the fact stands out that there were on a few occasions the Jews\nmet their death, they didn't believe that they did in order to save their lives and were willing\nto give the cooperation of the Germans. And they probably did it with the hope that they will\nbe understood, so their argument was then why didn't they come clean originally to say,\n\"Look, I've been sent here by the Germans. I am to do this and that and the other. However,\nthat was my best way of escaping or coming.\" So argumentive, who knows? Maybe the\nperson listening to their testimony at the time was not seeing the world this, he only saw to\nkill Jew is no crime. So yes, it did happen in many kind of ways. And Jews, even when I\nescaped and I came to the forest, it was not as easily as a guy from the local areas who did\nnot want to go to Germany for labor or who did not want to be inducted in the German Army\nwhich they made all of those openings for them. Although they had them in separate corps,\nyou know what I mean, serving. When they came and they escaped and they told their\nreason, 1t was on his home turf, remember. He probably was not from many miles away, he\nwas from the area. And it was very easy, it wasn't a question will they accept him; it was a\nquestion only where is he going to be placed? Is he going to be placed in our battalion or in\nanother battalion, whatever it is? But he had an easy home, much easier than fleeing. Now,\nthe only time I could say that it wasn't a problem was after the massacre in Germany, in\nChita. After the massacre, for instance -- or before that massacre in Bentschen. When the\nJews came, it was another story. There was, however, a fact that from Chita, one -- the most\nintelligent at the time would have been in our midst, who rose to be an attorney. And he was\nparty, which again to say that's what Hitler tried to do, to annihilate the first thing, then come\nagainst you. If he once he has the brains out, everything will be easy for him to achieve his\ngoal of the final solution. So he, a man came and organized a group, and he came to the\nforest. He's been shot, he did not live in the forest more than days before being killed. And\nagain, what would you say? Was that an act of anti-Semitism? Was it an act of jealousy\nbecause he was intelligent? Take 1t for what it's worth it. I am not familiar for the time\nserving 1n that area as a partisan, that a Gentile person was treated the same way as that\nVoretsky (ph) was, you know, from Chita. That we know a fact, and tell you one more thing.\nWe had a guy by the name of Bo Levine (ph); that was his name. The man had the highest\nmedal, he was responsible for downing more trains in our midst at that time than anybody\nelse. Sure, everybody knew Bo Levine, a blonde guy. There was not much to see that he was,\nyou know, six-foot tall, a husky kind of guy. He was of an average height, you know, five-\nnine, five-ten, stuff like this here. But that man had only one thing in his mind, what the\ntyrannical ways taught him to do. Is to go and seek vengeance. There were cases where we,\nall of us were involved in vengeance-seeking, because there were anti-partisans or anti-\nSoviets, but then in some cases, some went to take vengeance to those that we knew who\ncame into the ghetto and robbed from Jews or anything like this here. Yes, we went to seek\nvengeance, too.",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely. He was another story, and I am talking now when you use that word,\n\"partisans,\" I'm talking about if he came and fall into the partisans, that there were Soviet\npartisans. If he came into the National Polish Partisans or in the Ukraine part we called them\nBondarises (ph). These here people were just doing the same job that the Nazis did outside,\nand they were poisoned by the same thing. They were anti-Soviet and they were anti-\nGerman just the same, and Jew what they to. So be that it was the era of the time that\nthe poison of anti-Semitism got so many or be for or any reason to describe, a Jew was not\ntreated to join in the partisans as easily as a non-Jew. So this, for the records, I want to testify\nand make clear, that that was the case.",
        "A: I describe in many of the writings that I did before that humanity had to turn to savagery in\norder to survive. Not because that's what their wish. Even in my poems I say the same things\nabout it. It's very hard to describe the person you become. To give you an analogy how we\ntrain to escape in case of a fire from a tall building, and the facts speak that no matter how\nmuch training we do when the real fire happens, people still get confused and they do things\ndifferently than they anticipated. And the bottom line and the final analysis is that the curing\nwas not because of training. It perhaps helped but it wasn't that. The same thing, situations of\nthat nature as in my way when you had to think only positive in order to survive, because\nnegativism would only be a matter of how soon will you be dead. Murder, beating, or\nwhatever it 1s, but how soon will you be dead? So you could not project or map yourself out\na program that this is justifiable or this is not justifiable. And at the times, I don't know if in a\nbad situation what I would turn. When I had testified in Skokie before the Nazis had to\nmarch, and I was at city hall at that particular time in Skokie, they asked me a similar\nquestion. \"Mr. Zissman, what would you do if Collins and his gang come to march on\nSkokie?\" I says, \"I cannot give you a real answer. Am I going to grab a stone, and hit --\nthrow at him? Am I going to maybe to take a bottle, take it with me and throw a whole bottle\nat him? I don't know the outburst that it could project, this is why I'm pleading with you do\nnot let these people march because they will only create certain evil out of people who do not\nintend in a normal way to do that. And this is my best way to analogize or use that metaphor\nto you about it, how could human beings do certain things? I know from facts because of\npolice when we captured them and they told us. Before a massacre or anything like that\nhappened, the Germans, they did not want them to be sober because people under the\ninfluence act totally different -- act totally different as they do when they don't have that\nalcohol. So this is -- again, I'm only using that as a metaphor. People change at times of\nhorror or stuff like this. I was changed, too. And I want to be making this testimony right\nnow. Yes?",
        "A: Your enemy or survival. Or survival. I cannot use my own enemy, I can use the word that\nyou do various things to survive, and I would justify that because you have to.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Basically, at first when I was fighting the greatest difficulty was to get involved in killing\nbecause I still to this day do not want to use that method as what we were doing as\nkilling. It was defending. It was self-defense. Even the Bible tells us that if someone that\nif someone rises to kill you, you rightfully have the right to stand up and kill him. So I\nmust make that clear that our way was not that we were coming from a culture to say that\nthat's the only way to do. Our way was everything must be done in order to not let the\nenemy win. Oddly the enemy was instilled in us and in me precisely about it, and I wrote\nit one time talking and interviewing somebody from the camps. And I asked the same\nquestion, did the barbed wire electrified being everywhere in the camps, how come so\nfew threw themselves? I said I know and I heard of cases where people threw themselves\non the wires in order to get it over with from all the sufferings. But that wouldn't that be\ncommon sense to say in a case like that where you gave up life and you know you have\nno escape. So why let the person get the best out of you? Go ahead and get it over with.\nBut the fact remains that life is very dear. That is the reason we stop sometimes to\neulogize one little child who didn't show anything in life, and we eulogize one little\nmurder that it happened and we take it at the same thing. And this always must remain a\nseparation between murder and self-defense. We cannot take it as for granted that a\nperson uses a gun to kill to name him a killer. He sometimes uses a gun to kill to stay\nalive, to defend himself of the other one who 1s trying to kill him.",
        "A: Yes. When I first came to the forest and for a while I was very bitter that I did not have a\nlot more followers like myself. And the fact remains of the group that I had organized in\nthe ghetto in Briesen, not a single one after all the talk with it, not one who was on my\ngroup or in my group at that time, which it fell through, survived. Not one. The best fact\nagain is with my uncle, that he came out of hiding, crying and hugging and telling me\nwhy didn't you listen to your Harold? And this is a known fact of life that people at times\ndo not want to listen to righteous person, but then they come eulogizing why didn't we\nlisten? And that was the same bitterness that I had in me for quite a while that I didn't,\neven though seeing the hardship and the facts that the bottom line was that I was\naccepted. Even if it took me three weeks to get there, the bottom line was that the four of\nus, when we came we only found one Jew who I used to feel hurt about calling him a\nJew. The man was assimilated, he had birth already, his parents were no longer Jewish\nand he was not understanding a single word, although the guy who came with me\ncouldn't speak Yiddish either. He learned Yiddish later during the period of time because\nhe was also sort of an assimilated Jew. And I often used to, with the other ones, say, \"I'll\ntell you, when I am here, at least I have a reason. I am Jewish. I don't want to offend\nyou.\" Because I used to talk to him, I says, \"Tell me, what did you know about Jews?\" He\nsays, \"Nothing. To me, a Jew did not stop for one moment to think.\" I did not have a\nguilty feeling that I am not practicing Judaism, you know, so I says, \"This is where my\nhurt feels when I see your hurt, I feel I'm hurting for something. And here I see you're\nhurting for nothing, so I'm probably putting your case above mine, so please never be\nmad for my questions I'm asking you.\" And I still proceed to say more should have\nsacrificed their lives by escaping instead of just justifying the means that there was no\nway out.",
        "A: In my mind, if I remember when my son reach the age and he was in college and all of us\nAmericans at the time had the feeling of Vietnam. In our hearts we were almost complete\nminded. My wife used to put me to that question, what would do if Michael is called? It\nwas a bad answer, but I did it. I say, if called to fight, I would let him go and fight. As a\nmother, my wife thought in those years the same as some of them could try with their\nsons to run to Canada. Maybe perhaps if I was a married man when that happened\ninfluenced by someone I loved, or maybe be a father of a child or so, maybe it wouldn't\nbe so easy for me for settle with fighting ideas. So in a way I feel that the picture changes\nwhen you become a father. The picture changes when you think of your son. I remember\nthe first ttme when I was in Israel and I used to look and all the questions that were on\nmy mind before of Jews, that they are not fighting and this and that and the other. And I\nlooked in our family, here my first cousin -- he's married to a young lady that she's a\nmilitary person. She's by now probably a colonel in the army. He works for a defense\nfactory. I took a look at my wife's family, where a father son, both of them, he survived\nas a matter of fact by being in Russia at the time. But coming back when I tried to tell\nhim let's stay together, why do you want to go to Israel? I also wanted to go to Israel, but\nI didn't. And he did not want to listen to me, to one word. And he went to Israel, and it's\ntrue, the family got splintered, you know what I mean, and split up like this here. But I\nknow, and I was very curious to find out at the time -- as we know here, they both were\nfighting under Rabin at the time when they were there. And I asked him, \"How did you\nfeel about it?\" He says if I had to go tomorrow, they call me and they call my son at the\nsame time, I say we are going. There is not such as well, you know mean, I have all of\nthis here. Basically, my own thoughts had I been in Israel, either I would have been dead\nby now. But I would have definitely been in the armed services. At the time in the '40s\nwhen I was supposed to go illegally at that time, I couldn't see myself becoming, you\nknow what I mean, continuing my education. Maybe the time will change, but primarily I\nknow I would have been in field. I would have been -- be that it was the Haganah or the\nat that time or later when it became a regular army, I know. That's what my\nmind changed because of that, sort of that fighting was not any longer a trade of some\nand not for others. But I saw fighting must be a trade of everybody, you must be prepared\nto fight and not prepared just to dwell over books and signs and so on.",
        "A: Correct. Correct. I think it belongs with each other. Maybe in some other nationalities\nwhich I could not have the feeling. I wasn't somebody else, I was me. Maybe it's a\ndifferent situation. Maybe they in some nationalities look at fighting that it's a part of\npatriotism and the guy who didn't fight is not a patriot. I believe it's wrong because not\neverybody can be a fighter, no longer that everybody can be a doctor. Not everybody can\nbe a scientist. Not everybody can be anything else. I say for a person to resort to be able\nto go to fight, I believe it's something in the person himself. I cannot see that he's just\ngoing and lagging because these guys, they are the first one to raise that white flag once\nthey are in the armies. And I could not be thinking that way, but in the Jewish way -- let\nme speak to what I am and what I know. I believe we must retrain our offsprings. It\ncannot be said that a Jewish boy cannot go to learn how to shoot a gun or to go to a\ncourse where guns are being taught how to shoot and where, or the same story of being\nhunting. We always used to have a criteria and a joke that when a Jew became a Gentile\nafter he does everything else he could do with the Gentile in church and everything else.\nBut the story goes after he had to join him when he went hunting, he says that I cannot\ndo. Why do I have to go kill that animal? And as we know, that's a popular thing, and we\nknow for the record if we were start looking around, that few Jews are hunters. But you\nsay Gentile, it's sort of an inborn thing with them that hunting season, they got to go, they\ngot to see that blood and kill that little animal, you know what I mean, or so on or the\nother. Regardless what it is, but that's a whole admission to go duck hunting or to go deer\nhunting and so on. I believe we must learn from history. We are an old, old nation of\nsurvival, but perhaps it's time for us to look into it from a different perspective. That to\nsurvive as we see the religious person with the beard in Israel and with the tefillin on his\nhead, he stays and prays the gun on his arm. We must tolerate it, not look down on it\nbecause that, I believe, is the only way of survival.",
        "A: To stay vigilant and not be different this case than the other nations around. You cannot\ngo by the story of what at that time Esau and Jacob were blessed by their father where he\ntold to Esau, \"You shall live on your sword.\" While he told Jacob to be -- it's good,\nmeaningful things and I believe it doesn't hurt to do both. You can still become a rabbi,\nyou can still become a student of theology. You can become a student what you want.\nBut don't look down that it comes a time that you have to resort to be drafted in the\nservice and you have to go to defend your country. I believe that's the way it should be.\nWe know past doing the Czar, during the other one, that the Jews were no good for\nanything but they drafted them in the service anyway. They were good for meat for the\ncannon, for cannon meat, you know, and so on. And there were, therefore, a lot Jews who\ndid not want to go serve because they couldn't have the kosher foods, you know what I\nmean, served to them and so on. And they would desert a lot of times because it was\nagainst their belief religiously. And in other words, why should I go fight for somebody\nthat when I get through fighting -- the analogy would go again with the black people of\nthe United States. That when they had to go fighting, they couldn't be together with the\nwhite man who was fighting the same enemy. So there are certain changes must come\ntrue in life as it goes on, and the changes is with understanding. So to answer you, I am\nstill a fighter, yes.",
        "A: Well, this part, I believe, you can talk and bring out more Biblical stories or more of the\nother one stories. I used to say that 1f we were to hail after the kingdom of the day of\nDavid, King Solomon, we would have been another people. However, we must\nunderstand that all of that happened when we were a country on own land, and in order to\nbe a country, we had to have a military. We had to have an army. But when we were\ndriven out or taken off our land, so we saw the holiday of poor what it tells us. The story\nwith Mordecai, the story with Esther. Speaking about it, a lot of people see something\nmissing in the while story, that it goes on, and at times they are very despondent. Because\nlook what Mordecai did, he told is niece to go ahead and get married to a non-Jew, which\nit remains questionable to a student who starts learning. That student has to be so much\naccommodating to justify that. For the sake of survival, you do everything. I, for instance,\njustify what Mordecai did. If that were the man that Esther had to go and engage herself\nto become that queen, that through way she could help her people if it meant her to go in\non that thing and become at that moment to get married to a non-Jew and the outcome\nwas that she remains the hero. We don't call it the scroll of Mordecai; we call it the scroll\nof Esther. So the whole story of Esther became. So we can take it and see the difference.\nIf that would have happened in Israel perhaps like the high priest when 1t comes when it\ncome with the story of Hanukkah. He showed, he and his sons were the first ones to rise\nand kill these people who wanted to switch him over to the Greek mythology at that\nparticular time and become of a different belief and the pig and everything like this here.\nBut he was a leader, and he rose, so maybe if something like that would have happened\nby one of the conquerors in Israel, we would have had another story to tell again of\nheroism when it happened. But since it happened outside the realm and the country of\nIsrael, there was only one way to do, is politically. And that's what Mordecai did, he did a\npolitical thing in order to save the Jews at that time of Persia. But it's confusing when you\nstart reading at times and remain Jewish like the question is asked. You can go on on so\nmany various historical facts.",
        "A: But it's only going to come to the same conclusion, so if you want to dwell, you'll find it.\nMore and more to what I just am saying or said. And I want to conclude in it in saying in\norder to survive as a nation for the years and years and centuries to come, we see the\nchange and the change was started from Israel. We see the capabilities, no one in the\nworld with modern weaponry had ever created a thing like Entebbe where the whole\nworld was rocked, of how they did stand up and do it. So that's what I am saying, you\nmust stand up, but you must also train. I'm all for the way it is in Israel, but I'm only\nagainst that one thing. That they still give a person who is religious, they give him, in\nother words, a way that he can because of that avoid being drafted in the army. I believe\nthat cannot be done. If that a person is a conscientious objector for killing, let him work\nin a hospital. Let him work someplace where he can create his holy mission, save lives.\nDon't have to go up, that's still a soldier. A soldier who saved the other injured one is still\na soldier. He can still continue with his rabbinical or theological ways of prayer and\neverything like that. But that must be done, we cannot exclude somebody because he is of\nreligious belief that he should not serve in an army. I don't believe in this theory at all,\nand I hope someday this will be changed.",
        "A: Absolutely. It's community and country, belongs to everybody. It cannot be delegated to\njust some, and the rest of it just to stand and applaud. It's everybody's job and it's\neverybody's duty.",
        "A: Okay. We're looking at an event that took place where two brothers with the beards are\nwitnessing a marriage to we see the son of the bride and groom. On the top line, you see\nme with a cap on. Next to me is my mother. Next to my mother is my father. Below him,\nthe bearded guy is his father. And at the bottom row where we see children, so you see to\nmy right that's my brother next to me. Next to him with that little bib on him, that's my\nyoungest brother. Now, next to him is a cousin of mine which he belongs to this part of\nthe family. Then the last one to the left if my sister. So there you have the family of all\nfour of us taken on this picture shown at a wedding ceremony that it took place before the\nwar.",
        "A: It was in the town of Ostrava. I would approximately say that that had to be in the year no\nlater than 1936, about 1936, you know, at the time.",
        "A: None of them. I'm the only one who survived of all of these here people. Here you see a\npicture when there were visitors in our family and that young lady who's not seen in this\npicture was a photographer. They came from a city called near Warsaw. And it\nwas our house, the background as you see, where my mother and all the four children are\nthere. My father, of course, is away on business, so he couldn't be in that picture. So as\nyou see, I and my brother are wearing the school uniforms because I attended a parochial\ntype school where a uniform was a part of the attire that we had to wear. So you see on\nthe top, Iam. Below me 1s my brother with a school uniform. Next to me is my youngest\nbrother. Then is my mother, and there is my sister, who actually she was the third in the\nfamily. So this is what this picture is all about.",
        "A: And, unfortunately, you see I'm smoking a cigarette, which looks like -- got me smoking\nin later years very young, but I'm very happy that I gave up smoking, at least almost 10\nyears. So I'm on a tricycle in my city of , at the age of about three at that\nparticular time. By the way, all these pictures that we are going to be seeing, I didn't\nbring them with me, but I got them in the United States from the family -- from the\nrelatives that they had it here. And that was sort of gift to me about it. This picture was a\nreproductive picture that I did do in Italy after I received the picture from the USA from\nmy aunt with a big picture of the wedding at first. That they reproduced it for me in Italy.",
        "A: That's my father and my mother. The original pictures, I already said, was the first thing\nthat we shot. From that picture, I reproduced all of that. And here is showing my mom\nand dad.",
        "A: I, again, would say like it was before. That it had to be about 1936. '35 or '36. This\npicture was -- oh, not yet? I'll wait. This picture was done in 1945 when we first came to\nItaly. As you see, I'm wearing the jacket like the Eisenhower army jacket that I was\ndressed in. And at least it proves to me when I look at it today that I was young at once,\neven after all the hostilities that I went through and when I came to Italy. Next to me 1s\nmy wife. And I believe our faces, if you want to be a good judge, will say that a lot of\ngrief is looking from these faces from the past, which it was still haunting on us. And\nthat's the reason you see the seriousness and the grim look on the picture by both of us.",
        "A: This picture here was taken at approximately in June of 1945, where in my story I told us\nthat we had in the military academy of Modena where we were stationed, it was about\n7,000 refugees which 5,000 of them were ex-inmates from Mauthausen, who were\nbrought in in one day on trucks. And over there in this camp there was mixture of kids\nwho came out of camps, who probably were taken to the camps when they were real\nyoung. And at this time, they were 17 and 16. And it was a tragedy, within a few days\nthese kids went out on the streets of Italy and some of them got infected with VD\ndiseases. And, therefore, while I was working on the administration of the camp, our first\nplea was to all the people who came for us, which it was the Israeli Army stationed with\nthe British together. It was also the U.S. Army soldiers which they were nearby. I don't\nremember the army or which number they were in, but they were with us. So our plea to\nthem was please get these kids out and let them be situated in a separate camp. So here\nwe see in this picture a truck, and we see the image, we see some Israeli soldiers, rather\nnear me where I'm standing -- I'm standing at the side here, and next to me the guy, Vina\n(ph), who's dressed in a sports coat and tie, and then...",
        "A: Yeah. I'm in the white shirt. Then there is a soldier, an Israeli soldier next. So in basic\ntheory or story, what it is all about, that this was the truck on which one the youngsters\nare loaded on. And there were about a few trucks, maybe a column of 10 or 12 pulling\nout of the camps, taking those youngsters in to a children's camp where there were only\nchildren supervised by trained teachers until they were taken to Israel at a little later time.\nSo here you can see for yourself the first survivors of the Holocaust, be from inmates of\ncamps, be from partisans. Like all these young guys that you see around me are former\npartisans in the forest near the forest where I was coming from in the same way. Tell me\nwhat I'll say. Please forgive me for the former frame, that it was I said on the left side. I'm\nhere on the right side of the picture dressed in the shorts, and my arms clutched. Next to\nme is a partisan. Next to him 1s a partisan. And next to this guy is an Israeli soldier who\nserved with the British Fifth Army, who was the head of the group who came to take the\nkids out of camp to bring them to their own camp. The next one is Vina (ph) is his\nname. He was also a partisan, but he was not in our forest. He was in the\nForest, which it was near Vilna. So on this picture you will find people who were partisan\nfighters, former inmate of concentration camps in the back row. And from distance, we\nsee the truck where on this truck, the children who will be taken to their own camp.",
