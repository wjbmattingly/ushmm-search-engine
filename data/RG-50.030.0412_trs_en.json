And m-my mother\u2019s what -- what\nshe was doing, what she -- what she was, a -- an medical person, and they allowed her to live in\nMoscow, because at that time, under the Tsar, Jews were not a-allowed to live in Moscow, unless\nthey were engineers, technicians and medical people.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And what was your mother at the time?",
        "A: She was fercherka, which is a -- a -- more than registered nurse. I think they have now this\nkind of people who work with the physicians, surgeons and so on, and they\u2019re very close to --\nthey didn\u2019t graduate as -- as doctors, but they had --",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that 1t was a very dangerous street. You shouldn\u2019t walk around. There is a very good book\nab-about what was going on in Moscow at that time, by Jeromski, who was a writer, and -- and\nhe wrote about the son and -- and -- and father who met ge -- ac -- accidentally that they were\nworking together in a -- some kind of labor, slave labor or whatever. It wasn\u2019t slave labor\nbecause they were free to go. And she -- this guy who had gi-given him a place to live, told\nthem, don\u2019t wander too much around Moscow, it\u2019s a very dangerous place. And it was. It was\nshooting innocent people [indecipherable] somebody brought out to uncover their name, and --\nand they were just shooting around the city, yeah.",

It -- it was a complete chaos and he was trying\nto get to Odessa, but my mother\u2019s brother said that -- that they never seen him.",

        "A: I think my mother decided to go back to Warsaw and she was looking for a way no -- down\nthere. She probably found out about echelon. It used to be called echelon, this train. This was set\nup by -- I don\u2019t know, it ma -- it must be later than \u201918, because when Poland regained their\nstatus as -- as a -- as a country, they decided to help the Polish people to come back. And if you -\n- if you fi -- if you ever were a citizen of Poland, you could apply and look for a -- for a s -- town\nwhere it will stop. So probably my mother did that, find out where -- where it 1s. But before that,\nwe went to Krasnodar, which 1s a town close to Caucasian mountains, where my grandparents on\nma -- my mother\u2019s side lived. And we went there and stayed, I d -- don\u2019t know how long.",
        "Q: Was that nice for you to be there?",
        "A: I think it was nice, yes, 1t was v-very nice house with the verandas [indecipherable] and -- and\nthere was a huge tree where our neighbor made for children to climb in, and there was a little\nhouse there, but they didn\u2019t let me go.

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: SO --",
        "Q: So you went to Warsaw.",
        "A: Yes, we went to Warsaw by echelon, a train which stopped at Rostov. Rostov on -- on Don,\nwhich is dona in Polish, whatever. I keep forget -- Dniep -- no. I keep forgetting --",

        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- on this -- on the trip, yeah, that\u2019s all I remember [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And what are you, about five or six at this point?",
        "A: No, I probably was six or seven, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And when we came to Poland I -- I didn\u2019t speak Polish yet, and I remember later -- later\n[indecipherable] in -- in school that was a poli -- teacher of Polish, and he reminded me all the\ntime that I am -- that I am putting the -- the sentences in a way Russians put it. And -- and so it\nwas kind of a long way. So we cou -- we came to Warsaw in \u201922, I think. \u201922 [indecipherable],\nand I went to school, and the school was co-educational, which was a big, big st-step forward.",
        "Q: What was it called?",
        "A: Co-educational.",

        "A: Unthinkable. And we were there for a couple of years.",
        "Q: Was this a private school?",
        "A: It was a private school, yeah.",
        "Q: So your mother had a fair amount of money to be able to do that?",
        "A: No, she didn\u2019t, but she started to work, and I -- I really don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know how she\nmanaged, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And your sister went to that same school as well?",

        "Q: Nothing.",
        "A: No, that was unreligious house, and --",
        "Q: Totally non-religious. So did you learn about Judaism at all, or [indecipherable] much?",

        "A: No --",
        "Q: -- anti-Semitism?",
        "A: -- not at all, not at all.

But I -- I don\u2019t\nthink it ever came th-through this. There were a lot of fights between s-students in the -- at the\nuniversity, mm-hm.",
        "Q: But before we get to the university years, tell me a little bit about growing up with a single\nmother, obviously, which I don\u2019t know that wasn\u2019t so typical at the time. It was --",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t, and well, we had the -- a helper.",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And so it wasn\u2019t harsh. I mean, we were not rich or anything, you know, that was far from\nthere. But we were get -- getting along fine. And my grandmother -- I slept in the same room\nwith my grandmother, and she collapsed and died of probably a heart attack.",
        "Q: And when was that? That was later?",

And the last one I went was in different part of\nWarsaw, and it was kind of funny because the school was on a -- a high building, that was high\nprobably at that time, it was nine floors or something like that, and the school was on eight and\nnine floor. And we had a different entrance because the tenants who lived in -- in the --\ndemanded that that will ha -- but sometimes we got out and come down the stairs of the tenants\nand rang the -- the -- yeah, what is it?",

        "Q: In di -- in journalism or not?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember what she was taking in there.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And you were living at home, both of you?",
        "A: At home, yeah, both of us.",
        "Q: Yes, and your mother is, of course, continuing to work.",
        "A: Right, yeah.",
        "Q: So, in 1939, when the Germans attacked Poland, is this a big surprise?",
        "A: Not such a big surprise, but the -- well, the -- the government was telling us absolutely\nsomething entirely different. That we\u2019re strong and -- and that they have tanks made of, I don\u2019t\nknow, cartons or whatever. I-It was unbelievable. We just couldn\u2019t believe that -- that\u2019s coming.\nAnd it came, first of September, 1939, and we heard the bombing coming closer and closer. And\nthen it didn\u2019t take long. But of course, Warsaw was fighting through for another 20 days or\nsomething like that. And then they came -- they came marching the main street of Warsaw.",
        "Q: And you remember that.",
        "A: Right. But before that it was a kind of a -- a -- a week or 10 days that they were free, the --\nand I remember with my sister that we were walking in Warsaw ruined -- n-not ruined the way it\nwas ruined after the uprising, but it -- 1t was pretty badly damaged, and one thing I remember\nvery well, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a dead horse on the street, you know. Some -- there were no dead people, so\nI saw the -- the horse there.",
        "Q: Just the horse.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: That must have been a big shock walking around under those circumstances.",
        "A: Oh yeah, it was, but 1t was quiet, and pe -- people were shoot -- just going around, not\nknowing what\u2019s going to come. And then they -- they get -- got in, and they marched in. The --\nin this thoroughfare of Warsaw.",
        "Q: And did you go and look, or could you see it from your apartment [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, no, nobody came out.",
        "Q: Nobody came out.",
        "A: Nobody, no, they were empty street.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: Yes. So that was kind of a quiet two months, and everybody was waiting for orders -- what is\n-- what is going to happen to us. And it started to happen 1-in early fall, October.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That they -- they were just [indecipherable]",
        "Q: The what? The --",
        "A: [indecipherable] word for at -- not advertising, how they say, placard.",
        "Q: Announcements?",
        "A: A whats?",
        "Q: Announcements?",
        "A: Announcement, but n-not by radio, but by --",
        "Q: Posters?",
        "A: Posters, posters, that\u2019s right. That there is a typhus, and that they going to change the --\nWarsaw, and the Jews have to come out and live at certain places. They didn\u2019t say exactly where,\nbut later on they did say, and w-we thought, you know, that we will just stay at home, but we\ndidn\u2019t. We were told to move inside the ghett -- the ghetto didn\u2019t exist --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- actually, at the time. And the wall didn\u2019t go up until we were already inside. And the wall\nusually was running through the half of the street. So we were looking for something and we\ncouldn\u2019t find anyone. Then my -- our dentist, who lived inside of this perimeter where -- where\nwe -- we could live too, offered us living quarters, so we decided to move there. It was a\n[indecipherable] complete [indecipherable]. It was 1940 October. And we moved whatever we\ncould, just by hand, and by a little cart which my -- my d -- my daughter\u2019s husband found\nsomewhere.",
        "Q: You mean your sister\u2019s husband.",
        "A: My -- my sister, what -- what\u2019d I say, daughter?",

        "A: I did -- never had a daughter. So, see how mixed up I am? Okay. Well --",
        "Q: Let me ask you something.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: Are there rumors going around? What are people saying to each other w-with this -- wi --",
        "A: Just rumors. Rumors and posters, that\u2019s all.",

        "Q: -- council in October, right?",
        "A: -- he was, uh-huh, right.",
        "Q: And what did you think of that?",
        "A: Well, we thought it\u2019s probably wonderful, but we didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I had the --\nthe first -- my ausweiss, which is a kind of a paper which shows that you are not ready for -- for\ndeportation. It was from -- from Judenrat, yeah. And because the f -- a friend of mine -- my\nfriend\u2019s father belonged to the -- to the [indecipherable], and so I got this ausweiss, which\nnothing was worth. I didn\u2019t work there.",
        "Q: That was in the beginning?",
        "A: That was in the beginning.",
        "Q: And what was his name? Your friend\u2019s father\u2019s name?",
        "A: Jelinski, right.",
        "Q: And he was on the council with Chernyokov?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Right. So was -- when you moved into the place, what was it -- what was it like?",
        "A: Well, we moved into this dentist, Anika was her name, and she let us a very large living\nroom, and facilities -- I mean in th -- in the kitchen, and then a very tiny room for my sister and\nher husband. And my mother le -- wasn\u2019t well at -- all of a sudden, because her first -- her first\nincident or ac -- or accident, happened when they bombarded Warsaw, and we were told by the -\n- that we should hide behind -- inside of the houses, or inside of the gates of the houses. And she\ndid that, and this other -- arg -- other group, too, and she saw a little who was crying, and she\ngave her a candy. And somebody remark, you shouldn\u2019t do that, cause there\u2019s spies now, you\u2019re\nnot supposed to do it. And before she knew, a policeman came in and I -- I nof -- not arrested\nher, but took her to -- to a -- the 0 -- office -- police office and charged her with something, but\nthey -- he let her go. She was very upset about it. And since then she wasn\u2019t very well.",
        "Q: Was this the Jewish police who picked her up?",

        "Q: Jewish police who picked her up, or the --",
        "A: There wasn\u2019t any Jewish police at that time --",
        "Q: At that time.",
        "A: -- no. The f -- the Judenrat started to form po-police and so on --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- on -- on demand from Gestapo and Germans.",
        "Q: And did you think your mother was getting depressed, or she was getting physically ill?",
        "A: Oh she -- no, she -- no, she wasn\u2019t well physically, and then depressed also, yeah.",

        "A: How bo -- how what?",
        "Q: How old do you think your mother was?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. Probably over 50, yeah.",
        "Q: Over 50.",
        "A: 50, yeah, or 56, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And how was your grandmother at this time?",

        "A: No --",
        "Q: -- set up.",
        "A: -- there\u2019s nothing to do there. It was just because I knew the people there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, actually, you know what Germans were doing, they were preparing us for all this\nwhat was coming, by depressing us, that we are much less regular people than -- then the -- the\nother folks.",
        "Q: Did it work?",
        "A: Yeah. I -- the -- that we are --",

        "A: -- not as good as -- as German people.",
        "Q: And how did that make you feel?",
        "A: Terrible, terrible. I -- at this time in 40\u2019s, and early \u201941, I used to go outside to our friends\nwho never moved from their places, counting probably on the -- the -- that -- that they didn't\nknow [indecipherable] leaving, or they -- they knew, but they didn\u2019t disclose that. And they\nprevailed until the uprising.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: I\u2019m talking about not the uprising in ghetto --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- I\u2019m talking about the German uprising --",
        "Q: The Polish uprising in \u00b044.",
        "A: -- right, right.",
        "Q: And you were able to go in and out of the ghetto before [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, yes, there were possibility and I -- I went several times. Just [indecipherable] took off the\n-- the band on -- on your right hand and -- and went and it was won -- wonderful. It\u2019s a feeling\nlike something very heavy [indecipherable].",
        "Q: Was it dangerous for you to leave?",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: But you had a --",
        "A: Unless a -- I would -- I don\u2019t know, I probably didn\u2019t look very much Jewish, or something. I\ndidn\u2019t have any problem. But it wa -- didn\u2019t last very long, cause they closed this -- this courts.\nThese were courts.",
        "Q: Courts? [indecipherable]",

        "A: Right, mm-hm.",
        "Q: And it was -- what was the color, do you remember?",
        "A: White with blue, the David --",
        "Q: So this must have been also extremely strange for you, and for everybody else.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. But you know, there was so many things around us which were terrible. First of\nall, the change of the living quarters. The -- the -- the surrounding, and you know, somebody\u2019s\nelse house you live, and tha -- there was a lack of food. There was a -- our housekeeper, who\nused to come to our regular place where we used to live, and she brought some food from -- from\nreich. Reich was -- was anything which 1s -- which Germans occupied, it was called reich, r-e-1-\nc-h.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they were o-occupied [indecipherable] and -- and they -- it was m-more contact with\nother people, and here all of a sudden we\u2019re cut off of everything. And there was nothing to -- to\nlive by.",
        "Q: So this was the least of it, having the armband, it was not -- was not as [indecipherable]",
        "A: The armband -- the armband worked only in -- in the ghetto. When you go out -- you couldn\u2019t\ngo out with your armband. Out of the ghetto you couldn\u2019t go.",
        "Q: Did -- did things change really immediately when you moved, so that there was much less\nfood, water, electricity --",
        "A: No wa -- there was water.",
        "Q: There was water?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, for a long time, mm-hm. But food, yes, there were -- you know, the little boys\nwere smuggling bread and all kinds of food. But when you paid the [indecipherable] which was\nthe German, later on in the day, in -- lots of food came into ghetto by --",
        "Q: They smuggled it.",
        "A: You know, by -- yeah, mm-hm.",
        "Q: And then, what were they [indecipherable]",
        "A: Everything has been smuggled, yeah.",
        "Q: And they would sell it sort of like a black market, they would sell it so they could get --",
        "A: Yes, expensive, yeah.",
        "Q: But you weren\u2019t working, your mother wasn\u2019t working, so how did you get food?",
        "A: Well, we ha -- we had some money, and I -- wi -- we sold out a lot of th -- table sel -- silver\nand so on when we still were outside there, the ghetto, I went to -- to a market and sold out for\nwhatever, flo-flour or what 1s -- oil or whatever.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And how did you bring in the stuff that you bought?",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t ghetto at the time.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, so it was still [indecipherable |",
        "A: No, it was before, yeah.",
        "Q: -- that was alright. Before the wall was put up.",
        "A: Right, yeah.",
        "Q: And did you go see your friends when you went out?",
        "A: Yes, I went to my friends, I went to a friend very far away.",
        "Q: And did they suggest --",
        "A: Well, they -- they helped us a little bit, as much as they could, but not too much. We actually\nsold out everything before we went to ghetto, and we just lived day by day.",
        "Q: Did you think when you left the ghetto, in order to sell out stuff, that at some point maybe you\nshould [indecipherable]",
        "A: I didn\u2019t go out of the ghetto to sell.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t -- I know [indecipherable] yes, when you --",
        "A: That was before that, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- when you moved into the area that became the ghetto.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did you ever think of staying outside of that area, or --",
        "A: Well, yes I did, but I didn't see any possibility. My sister could go to Brazil before we went to\nghetto, when somebody gave her papers.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And -- but she didn\u2019t. It -- it wasn\u2019t that -- it wasn\u2019t yet so strong feeling that we can\u2019t get --\nthat we can\u2019t get through, you know, in -- in a few months, in a year. We got this bullet --\nbulletin, a Polish bulletin that it will not last long an-and so on, and you know, this kind of\nthings. But the real break-out was the Stalingrad offensive and that was much, much later.",
        "Q: So tell -- let\u2019s go back. When -- when the -- when the wall is built, do you now have this\nfeeling of what --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- this is not going to end so soon. Something --",
        "A: Right, of course. And we lived with this dentist friend and she had her windows turned into\nthe place where they checking it out, the ghetto, and I looked what was go -- what\u2019s going on.\nYou know they s -- they were beating the small children with [indecipherable] and cutting the\nJewish Hassidim, the beards, and laughing [indecipherable] all -- was right there.",
        "Q: So it was just getting worse and worse?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you now begin to see dead bodies, or was that later?",
        "A: Dead body was -- was later.",
        "Q: It was later.",
        "A: Yeah. Because they ev -- every -- every community, ev -- Jewish community which were left\nover, they were coming to Warsaw. It started to be, you know, not just wars -- Warsaw citizens,\nbut everybody else. And from Germany and -- and even from abroad, yeah.",
        "Q: So there\u2019s a huge number of people who come into a very, very small --",
        "A: Place, yeah.",
        "Q: -- area. There\u2019s almost 400,000 people --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] becomes the ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So this must have been awful.",
        "A: Awful. In --",
        "Q: Really chaotic --",
        "A: -- in living quarters, yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: The typhus really began at that time.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I had typhus, too.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes. It was in \u201942, in -- in winter and all of a sudden I became very ill, and it -- there was a --\nthere wasn\u2019t an -- even doctors available, but a friend doctor came and gave me some whatever. I\nwent through it with a very high fever, and if it -- it will become meningitis after the fever\nbecomes really high. But I --",
        "Q: But you got through it. So you were living with your mother, your grandmother, your sister,\nand your brother-in-law?",
        "A: No, grandmother wa-wasn\u2019t alive.",
        "Q: Your grandmother was gone.",
        "A: Yeah. Grandmother was gone yeah, that was long time before.",
        "Q: Before you moved?",
        "A: Before we moved, yeah.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Oh, much before we moved.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. She lived until, I don\u2019t know, \u201936 or seven yeah.",
        "Q: \u00b036 -- \u00b036. And is your brother-in-law working, your sister working, or 1s no one working?",
        "A: Well, he was working. We -- 1 -- you can\u2019t -- you can\u2019t say that --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- he was working. There was no workplace as [indecipherable] can imagine.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: There was, you know, some kind of a trading. You -- you had this and I give you that and\nthen you give me I don\u2019t know what, flour or -- or macaroni or whatever and -- and so on. Or\nyou have contact with the outside, meaning the Polish, which I had, and -- and could sell\nsomething to friends and they will give you any money. But that was all in the beginning, in the\nbeginning of the ghetto.",
        "Q: Right. And do you remember these self-help organizations, house committees around\nWarsaw?",
        "A: As far as I remember, it didn\u2019t -- it had nothing to do with me.",
        "Q: So did y -- you didn't know about s -- any soup kitchens, or --",
        "A: Well, they were organized, all those kind of things, but I was out of the area.",
        "Q: You were out of that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I see. And what about -- I do know that there were lots of -- there were lots of cultural\nactivities, some [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yes, there was, mm-hm. I was once only --",
        "Q: Once?",
        "A: -- ina -- in some kind of a -- a garden, you know, put up as a -- as a kind of a caf\u00e9 or\nwhatever.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah. But it was only once. And th -- well, a lot of it is in -- pianist 1s a -- di-did you read\nthat? Yeah, well, he has a -- a different approach to that, yeah, but I didn\u2019t know. Well, it was --\nyou know, it was for people who really made money, and some did. And some had contact with\nthe Gestapo. They thought this will help them to -- to get out of the deportation. But a-at the last\ntime, it did not.",
        "Q: Mm. So as -- let\u2019s talk between 1940, in November, when -- when the ghetto -- when the\nghetto really becomes enclosed, until before the deportations, what do you begin to think about\nthe Judenrat at this time? Do you -- are you -- do you think they\u2019re doing a good job? Are you\nangry with them? Do you wonder what\u2019s --",
        "A: About Judenrat?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, it di -- you know, they -- they just couldn\u2019t do much. They were told one day they have\nto -- to send 10,000 Jewish men for work. And where would they find those 10,00 Jews?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And it would -- was a -- a very bad job, I should say.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, they -- they couldn\u2019t come out of it right. And once they were arrested, all of them, and\nthere was a saying all over the ghetto that something bad is coming, and they were -- and they let\nthem out in a couple of days. So we didn't know much about it, what was going on. We knew the\n[indecipherable] commando, which was in later years used to get people out of the houses, and\nmarch them to Umschlagplatz.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That was a special unit, special German unit. And they -- they had also Lithuanians,\nUkrainians, and -- and there -- that\u2019s what they help us, and dogs.",
        "Q: And dogs. And did you think that the Judenrat had kind of a special privileges, that they got\nmore food, or they were more --",
        "A: Maybe they had easier to get food, but I don\u2019t think they were ever paid or -- or anything. I --\nI have no 1--",
        "Q: [indecipherable] didn\u2019t know --",
        "A: -- yeah, right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I -- I -- I knew only -- the demands were very well known, that they need more and more\npeople t-to work.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. And they -- the Judenrat couldn\u2019t handle it, it -- 1t was too -- too difficult to get 10,000\npeople to work one day, it was --",
        "Q: Did you hear things about an underground movement, or the political movements in the\nghetto?",
        "A: Very late, yes I had, because my -- my daught -- my sister husband, chi -- joined them for\nawhi -- as much as I know before I left ghetto.",
        "Q: Was involved.",
        "A: Was involved.",
        "Q: And do you know with what group he was involved?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t, no. There were very -- as -- as far as I know, there were very few who really took\npart in the ghetto uprising and it was absolutely unbelievable what they have done. In the first\nday of the uprising, the Germans pulled out, it was such a strong --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- but of course later on it\u2019s -- it\u2019s [indecipherable] 1t was tragic.",
        "Q: Right. But did you -- be-before the deportations, did you know that there were political\ngroups talking about what they should do, or what they were capable of doing?",
        "A: Yeah, well, not much, not much. That it -- 1t was chaotic at first, you know?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But later on when they decided to -- to -- to do that, th-there was smuggling of -- of weapons\nand I heard about it, I knew that exists.",
        "Q: Right. But that was not something that you were involved with?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: When you were outside, di -- were th -- the puli -- the Catholics talking about underground or\nnot?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, I heard through Stefan, uh-huh.",
        "Q: And when did -- did -- when did you see Stefan for the first time after the occupation? Do you\nremember?",
        "A: I came out through the courts --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- and I walked the -- the main street of Warsaw, [indecipherable] Koska, and I s -- I seen\nhim, but I didn't approach him. It was too dangerous at that time. But he saw me, and he\napproached me, and we went for coffee and he told me about his -- his marching o -- 0 -- the --\nyou know, because there were orders and six or seven September from radio, that all able men to\ncarry weapons should go out toward the east.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And he and his colleagues left. And that was a walking march, cause they didn\u2019t have any\ncars, nothing --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- right, yeah. It was something somebody [indecipherable]. And he went to Lvov, which is\nLviv now. [indecipherable]. And they found out there is no -- no army, nothing. So they turned\naround and heard that Warsaw is completely demolished. And so they came back and he found\nout that he has to move out of th -- of his apartment where he lived, cause this part of Warsaw\nwas given to Gestapo and other officers.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So what was he -- when you met him, was he involved with --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- the underground at this time?",
        "A: Yeah, at -- at first he was -- he opened a little store or whatever in books, but he didn\u2019t -- he\ndidn\u2019t succeed. So he -- he got -- he got -- he had the friend in the taxation department and she\ngave him a ausweiss to go to ghetto. And [indecipherable] the people with taxes. Of course, he\ndidn\u2019t -- there wasn\u2019t anyone to whom he can give the taxes.",
        "Q: So he was supposed to -- there were tax collectors?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Right? There were also people collecting money for gas, for electricity, as far as I understand\nit.",
        "A: I think so, but I don\u2019t -- don\u2019t recall that.",
        "Q: So he was supposed to collect taxes for the Polish government?",
        "A: He was supposed to -- yeah, mm-hm, right.",
        "Q: And did he ever s --",
        "A: Not Polish government --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] whatever",
        "A: -- yeah, yeah, right.",
        "Q: Was -- did he succeed?",
        "A: No, he didn\u2019t. He -- he just tried to get to the certain places, and there was nobody, or they\nchanged their address, or they not living any more, yeah. So that was his job, and that\u2019s why he\ngot the ausweiss, which let him go into the --",
        "Q: Go in and out.",
        "A: -- yeah. So he visited his friends, his Jewish friends, and he dow -- he visited us too, and he\nbrought sardines from Portugal, and soap.",
        "Q: And soap.",
        "A: Which was a very important thing. Kind of a -- is kind of a large --",
        "Q: Large soap\u201d?",
        "A: Is kind -- yeah.",
        "Q: So how often did he come into the ghetto, do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: Well, oh once a week or --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- something, yeah.",
        "Q: So you would see him once a week?",
        "A: Right. And he -- he told me finally in October -- think it was October, \u201942 or some -- that his\nausweiss 1s running out and if I want to come out to his apartment, I am welcome.",
        "Q: And what did you think?",
        "A: I didn't think anything about it. Well, you know, it -- it -- well, going back it\u2019s so difficult. It\u2019s\nso difficult to -- to know what I\u2019d been thinking each time, after each catastrophe. It -- 1t\u2019s very\nhard to thi -- maybe I didn't think at all.",
        "Q: Maybe you just passed it by.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] he said it -- uh-huh. Were you becoming close friends at this point, were you\nbe -- o-or not?",
        "A: W-We were -- we were friends, yeah.",
        "Q: You were friends.",
        "A: Or re -- I know -- I knew some people who lived with him --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- and that was the connection, it was -- he -- he had a -- a [indecipherable] who was\nFinkelstein actually. And they had the an-antique store in Warsaw -- I mean, before the war, and\nshe lived there and another couple, a Polish couple live. The apartment was large --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- as -- for the -- for the Steins.",
        "Q: For the Steins, right.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",

        "A: Okay.",

        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- and continue in a few minutes.",
        "A: Yeah. This was one --\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Okay. Let\u2019s talk about when you actually have a job in the Tebbins shop. It -- when did --\nhow did --",
        "A: Yeah, was a -- was a job.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: It was a job for ausweiss, you know.",
        "Q: When you got the special pass.",
        "A: Right. And I don\u2019t remember, I just went there and was told that I -- I can work there. And\nthey were sewing the camouflage outside, the camouflage an-and the white part was underneath\nso they could, you know, in snow -- in snow, it doesn\u2019t show. And I didn\u2019t know how to sew on\nthat, you know, sewing machine. So I was -- hadn\u2019t finished some of the thing. And th-the hours\nwere terrible, because it was -- I don\u2019t remember, from eight to -- to one or two o-or from four to\n-- to 12 o\u2019clock at night. And we were fall asleep, of course, all of us. And we got food there, and\nthey brought it in large kettle with soup, which wasn\u2019t soup [indecipherable]. There was some --\nsome food at the very end, so it was lucky, you know, to get the --",
        "Q: You mean at the bottom of the pot.",
        "A: At the bottom of the p -- yeah.",
        "Q: I see. So did you try to wait the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, some did, of course, yes. But -- and there was bread, I think to the na -- probably now\nit\u2019s a very -- very much looked after, this kind of bread which was dark -- black and you had all -\n- all seven grains, or eight grains, whatever.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And -- and th -- I worked there, but th-the first time which I got into this big walk, you know,\nthrough the Warsaw to deportation that -- I wasn\u2019t at Tebbins, I was at home, whatever I want --\nwent to look for some -- something, I don\u2019t remember what. And I was swept out with this large\ncrowd which was filling in both sidewalks and the middle of the road, they were just going\npeople with children, with -- with bundles of -- of -- of food -- not food, I don\u2019t know what, and\nthat -- and we were going toward Meeska, toward the Umschlagplatz and the gates were closed\nwhen the took out the people from the -- from the houses, they closed the gates. You know,\nthat\u2019s kind of gates what you come at 11 o\u2019clock that used to be, and you had to wake up the --\nthe guy who takes care of the -- an-and give him 20 cents or whatever because you came late. So\nthey were -- they were closed tight --",
        "Q: You mean, outside -- the outside gates --",
        "A: -- outside, right, yeah.",
        "Q: -- of the house, yeah.",
        "A: Because the houses were -- they had that -- the gate was open over there, and you come in and\nwalk to the right or to the left or further down where it\u2019s called Pardvuka, which was a larger part\n[indecipherable] something like that, where the housekeepers were -- were cleaning the rugs\nfrom upstairs. A-And -- but one of -- if wi -- I recognized one of the policemen that I knew him,\nand he recognized me, and he showed me on the way to Umschlagplatz that one of the gates is a\nlittle bit open, not completely shut, and I followed that. Came out of the crowd and I thought\nwell, I\u2019ve nothing to lose, and sneak in the -- the -- the gate. And there was a lot of people there,\nand we waited for a couple of hours until everything calmed down, and the people who were\nhiding in -- in the apartments, they came out and they told us how to go to -- to different streets.\nBut the streets, you know, they -- the houses were cut like alleys so you can go through one\nstreet to another without coming out on the main street.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And so I went home and they couldn\u2019t believe that I -- I am still there.",
        "Q: So they were frightened because they saw all these people and they knew you were in the\nStreet.",
        "A: Oh they -- they knew nobody -- nobody came out of it, and so they were very happy about it.",
        "Q: What did -- what did you know about these deportations at this time?",
        "A: Oh, we know a lot, but we thought, you know, Judenrat helping to that. That this 1s all some\nlies. Those are young boys who just fled, you know, the [indecipherable] and -- and th-that\u2019s not\ntrue, it\u2019s -- but we started to believe that is something wrong at the end of the line. But a lot of\npeople did believe.",
        "Q: So in -- in \u00b042, when the deportations begin, you\u2019ve heard stuff about Treblinka?",
        "A: Even before that.",
        "Q: E-Even before.",
        "A: Not trebli -- not a name --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- th-th-there were other names. There was Sobibor and there were -- th-there were -- that\nwasn\u2019t the only trebli --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Treblinka was the one which took so many lives. That was the -- the end. There was no --\nnobody, you know, nobody a-as far as I know nobody escaped from Treblinka.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, do you?",
        "Q: Well, there was an escape later. There [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, maybe yeah. Because some were left to | -- sort out the -- whatever th-the others left.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Yeah. But --",
        "Q: So what did you be -- do you remember what you believed? After -- at the attack on Russia,\nthere\u2019s a lot of killing that goes on.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Right? That the Germans are killing. Do you hear about those killings as the Germans are\nattacking Russia in \u201941?",
        "A: Oh yeah, we knew about it, yeah.",
        "Q: You do? And what did --",
        "A: Cause we -- we had this bulletin from [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Who -- who brought in the -- the bulletins.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we knew what was go-going on in the world, and it\u2019s -- it was getting, you know, better,\nand -- but who knew when it will end? We -- we t -- we thought at first, you know, when we\nlived outside the ghetto, that this will last half a year, a year --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- but not five.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Well, w-we -- we just didn\u2019t -- I -- we didn\u2019t have time to think about it, you know? I-It -- it\nwas struggling every day. Every day you need food, you need -- your mother is not well. It -- it\nwasn\u2019t the -- the only -- when we got this news, it was far away, and nobody cares. Nobody\ncared. There was a time which I later found out, that Americans and English knew everything\nwhat is going on. So -- not only through Karski, there were many other people who -- who came\nand -- and w-were telling what was going on, not only with Jews, but with Poles. And nobody\ncould believe that they\u2019re taking those people and just putting them under gas. At -- at first they\nwere just r -- large vans, which we\u2019ve heard about it. No -- nobody believed it. It was -- it was\nimpossible to believe. So everybody thought, you know, where are we going? But later on, it\nstarted to dawn on us that this is the end, and everybody who could -- there was building of hide-\na-way kind of things. You have a stove and you -- behind the stove there is a room there, and the\n-- SO 1-- you put the stove at -- at the -- at the entrance, and there was nobody there. So these\npeople survived. How they survived, it was terrible, because I was in one of those ones, and I\nwas told that there were small children with us, and the parents knew if we hear somebody\ncoming [indecipherable] or SS, or what -- whatever, that we ca -- we just have to smother the\nchild. Yes. And since then, when I went to one of those because I was not at home, I was going\nout, and there was an alarm that Ukrainians are coming, and I didn\u2019t go an -- any more to these\nhiding places, yeah.",
        "Q: To this -- uh-huh.",
        "A: But there was a lot of these hiding places, and I think until they -- they -- the up -- uprising in\nghetto, that a lot of people were safe this way. Oh, I -- of course, I -- I don\u2019t know. A lot of\npeople outside the ghettos w-were saved to the --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- until the Polish uprising.",
        "Q: Let me go back a little bit, to the work. How -- do you remember about how many people\nwere working in that shop?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t remember exactly, but in my room there were probably 40.",
        "Q: 14?",
        "A: 40.",
        "Q: 40.",
        "A: 40.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But th-there were other rooms, you know, where they were working. Actually, they -- I must\nsay on behalf of Tebbins that he was giving those ausweiss rather knowingly, that those people\ndon\u2019t know how to sew.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Including you.",
        "A: Including me, yeah.",
        "Q: So nobody trained you on the machines?",
        "A: No, I -- no, I started to -- to use the machine when I was out of there, yeah. So that was --",
        "Q: Was there -- were there Germans -- German officials in the shop?",
        "A: No, no --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- nobody, nobody. When the -- that -- that was kind of a relief, that was nobody there except\nthe supervisors. One was called Jan -- Jahn -- Jan -- H -- J-a-h-n. And when I was liberated\nalready outside in Quakenbrick where we li -- used to live for awhile at the -- with the Polish\npress, I saw a man on the street and I thought it was Jahn, and I told Stefan, he said, oh, you have\nideas. I saw him another time, and I was so sure that it was Jahn, but Stefan said no, that\u2019s\nprobably not. I gave up. You give up on -- on the lot of things. When we were at the -- under the\nbureau [indecipherable] under the British and we occupied as part of Germany, we got the print\nshop for our -- our newspaper. And the -- the owner of the print shop was coming to those\njournalists, and telling them, I never was a Nazi, I never -- never had anything to do with them,\nand [indecipherable] a-anything, he would say. And they were listening just, you know. Nothing\n-- nothing happened to any of those people, and he was a Nazi, there is no -- but there were a lot\nof them who had to join the -- the -- the party, because of their living. He had very nice print\nshop and -- and he wanted to keep it, yeah.",
        "Q: Wer -- were you able -- did you get something other than soup so that you -- some food that\nyou were able to bring back to your mother and your sister and brother-in-law, or not?",
        "A: N-No, no.",
        "Q: You couldn\u2019t. And of course there was no pay, there was no -- it -- the only thing you got was\nfood.",
        "A: No, that that I seen. I didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: How long did you work there?",
        "A: That\u2019s -- you know, it\u2019s difficult for me to say, I -- I -- I do-don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Months? Years?",
        "A: I -- until -- right -- well, maybe a few months. Until the moment when the -- the second\nUmschlagplatz happened to me, and then I stopped working, and the only food it was -- which\nwas smuggled and w-we bought, and it was pretty bad.",
        "Q: So the first time you escaped deportation, you were just -- you-you\u2019re just sort of swept along\non the street. You never get to the Umschlagplatz.",
        "A: No, I didn't.",
        "Q: Right. So that was probably July, do you think, \u201942?",
        "A: That was July \u00b042.",
        "Q: The first -- the first wave of --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- the deportations.",
        "A: 20 - something, 25\".",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: It was a -- a crowd which is difficult to explain. We were walking one by one, and the\nchildren didn\u2019t cry. It was quiet.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. Nobody tried to escape. We were paralyzed. I-It was a unbelievable scene, just those\ndogs marching, an-and there weren\u2019t too many Gestapo people, they called -- those are special\nforces -- were special forces I heard, at home. And at -- that what you struck by the absolutely\nparalyzed people walking. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s unbelievable, I -- it -- 1t -- the -- the way I -- I -- I looked at\nthis Jewish policeman, I thought I know him, and he kind of made it -- eye contact to me, and I\nthought he showed me with his eyes the -- the next gate, which was how -- and that was it.",
        "Q: So how do you explain the fact that you were not paralyzed?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know. Some people were not, you know. Some people made their way probably\nin other gates. I -- I have no idea.",
        "Q: I guess it\u2019s surprising that you would say it was so quiet. I would have expected --",
        "A: It was quiet.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Maybe a -- a whimper of a -- the child or something li --",
        "Q: But not much.",
        "A: -- but no, no, no. The same was the second time when I was at Umschlagplatz.",
        "Q: So now --",
        "A: Nobody said anything.",
        "Q: Really. So how -- how did it happen that you were at the Umschlagplatz the second time?\nWould that have been in July again, or wa -- August [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, no, it was -- no, it was later, it was September probably --",
        "Q: September?",
        "A: -- yeah. And I was walking, y-you know, to get some money or food, I don\u2019t know what. I\nwent to Paviar Street, and all of a sudden I see a rush of people, but not as big, not as large as the\nprevious one, the July one. And I was caught in it, and I walked with them. A young woman\nwalked with me and we exchanged some words, but not much. And we went to a barrack which\nwas -- I don\u2019t know what it was before, you know, because it\u2019s -- was kind of remod with table\nand -- and chairs. And the chairs were made of steel, you know, the kind of -- something like\nwhat we use now when a lot of people come. And we found a place and we sit down and waited\nfor the train.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re at the Umschlagplatz you think?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: You\u2019re at the Umschlagplatz?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re waiting.",
        "A: And outside there was no -- no Germans inside, or maybe they were at the doors, but outside\nthe -- were Ukrainians with dogs. And that was it, it was kind of quiet, nobody talked unless\nwhispered to somebody. And I noticed that some people are going around and behind me, going\nto something which is open, and stairs are leading. And I talked to my companion, I said, I think\nthere is something there. And she said, yes I know. How do you know? Somebody probably\nescape, but she said Ukrainians come later and shoot the people who are hiding. So there is no\nway. I said, well let\u2019s try. And she tells -- she said no, I don\u2019t want to because I still hope that PII\nfind my family. I didn\u2019t say it -- anything. And she took money out of her -- you know, the -- the\n-- there used to be [indecipherable] which is -- they were different kind of -- there were no tights,\nbut they were draw -- you know, yo-you draw from your corset and tie your --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- your -- yeah --",
        "Q: Your -- your stockings.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And she -- she -- I said, Iam going. And she took out money out of, you know, her stocking,\nand gave it to me. I turned around and you know that -- these iron chairs were noisy, so I tried\nnot to make noise. I got up and sl-slinked down, and went dis -- up the stairs.",
        "Q: So did you go on the floor? So you didn't stand up?",
        "A: I -- almost didn\u2019t stand up. I was just crouching, li-like this, and I walk.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: When I went the stairs, they were dark and when I came up, it -- it was a -- a door to some\nkind of a attic or -- or I don\u2019t know what it was, and wa -- there were some furniture, sa -- some\nthings were lying down, but it was completely dark. And I went there and I -- I just sit down on\nthe floor. And it was quiet, very quiet. I think I -- my heart was, of course, pounding. It stopped\npounding after maybe I don\u2019t know, half an hour or so. And I probably fell asleep, because what\nI heard the next, 1t was [indecipherable] of these chairs and steps and later on schnell, schnell, the\nUkrainians with the dogs, and it -- it took quite awhile. And I felt that people are around me,\nyeah.",
        "Q: But you didn't see anybody?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t see, because it was dark.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, they -- it was a stockroom, so some kind of a -- a -- and then I heard the train\nand the doors closing down. And we waited. I think we all fell asleep probably. Kind of a early\nmorning, we heard voices. One vo-voice, or two maybe, and they said, just stay where you are,\ndon\u2019t move. And we -- we thought what is -- but in Polish, not [indecipherable] and we thought,\nwa -- what is it? And came there, either they were dressed like medical people or they -- they put\nit on, I -- I have no idea. And they let us out and took us to the hospital.

        "A: Oh, of course I did.",
        "Q: So were you worried that somebody was going to stop you and arrest you?",
        "A: Well no, it was very funny because it started to snow when wi -- I waited at this\n[indecipherable], the housekeeper who -- who done this for money. When he let me out, there\nwas su -- suddenly the rushka, you know what\u2019s the rushka? The rushka is a horse driven --",

        "Q: Oh, she was the one who never went?",
        "A: Yeah, she was the one. And later on she -- Stefan arranged for her an apartment at the same\nhouse and she moved to this apartment. And then wer -- then came the uprising in ghetto, and\ntelephone from my sister that they are going to -- with Tebbins [indecipherable] and that was the\nlast time I heard from her.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- but at that time we didn\u2019t have a phone. She called from somewhere.",
        "Q: And did you ever find out what had happened?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: And wa -- th -- were they -- were they taken to where she said?",
        "A: Yes. They shot them, all of them.",

        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t know, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Not yet, not yet, because Stefan always reminds me when he came and potatoes were boiling\nand I was asking my mother, mom, ho-how much salt, do I put salt? So it was a --",
        "Q: So your living conditions were actually much better together?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Of course, yeah.",
        "Q: Did -- did you find it, I don\u2019t know, disturbing or odd that the difference between the ghetto\nsituation and the rest of occupied Warsaw was so different?",
        "A: Yeah, well, it was different, yes, 1t was different, but th -- they suffered a lot, too, and all of a\nsudden, you know, comes a German outfit and rounds up several blocks and takes out people\nfrom trams and take them to -- to Germany to work, or just shoot them for no reason. And some\nwho were taking part in underground were taken out and you know, they -- they were shooting\nthem or taking them to a concentration camp. So they suffered, yeah --",
        "Q: And -- but what --",
        "A: -- a lot.",
        "Q: -- di -- I imagine --",
        "A: I mean, in regular circumstances, Poles suffered a lot. But you can\u2019t compare to what was\nhappening in ghettos. There is no comparison.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, there were others who will come and ask for money and -- and other addresses where a\n-- where Jews live [indecipherable] you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -- 1t\u2019s always a -- and it was also on\nthe Poles side, if you find a Gestapo or SS or whatever, they find the house where Jews are\nhidden, they would shoot everybody or take everybody to a concentration camp.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So it was -- it was quite a decision to take Jews in, especially men.",
        "Q: Why especially men?",
        "A: Well, they were circumcised.",
        "Q: Oh, oh, taking in Jewish men, uh-huh, I see what you mean, yes, right. So they could be easily\nfound out. So do you think more women were -- were saved in these circumstances than men --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: -- because it was less dangerous?",
        "A: Probably.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Probably. Well, men usually, at the ghetto situation in the beginning and later, they choose to\ngo east.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And that was a good idea. That -- thi -- it doesn\u2019t mean that they didn\u2019t wind up in a gulag.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, for different reasons. But there 1s a -- was a much higher chance for them to stay\nalive.",

        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- in [indecipherable] you did?",
        "A: Yeah. We knew.",
        "Q: And was --",
        "A: And Stefan left at four o\u2019clock, the first of August. But, well, it -- it was also a terrible time,\nterrible time, especially at the end when the uprising went down.",
        "Q: Yes, cause it was [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, we had to wait for the Red Cross to -- to make sure that we are -- be treated as -- not as\nbandits, but as fighters.",
        "Q: As POW -- you mean as soldiers.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: So the Red Cross came in?",
        "A: Oh, Red Cross came in, yeah, uh-huh.",
        "Q: And so Stefan is taken as a prisoner of war?",
        "A: Right, and me too.",
        "Q: And you too?",
        "A: Right. I was working at the hospital at that time. I started to work when the uprising started,\nand I stayed there, and we were taken.",

        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: Few, very few nurses who could be, you know, taking care of the wounds, or -- or things like\nthat. But -- and that was the only thing I\u2019ve been doing.",
        "Q: Hm. And so the Germans actually respected the -- the Red Cross [indecipherable]",
        "A: The finally day there, yeah, respected and -- well, 1t was -- you know, it was quiet all of a\nsudden. [indecipherable] Warsaw came out and we went also to the house which we lived in.\nAnd the only thi -- we -- he was a reporter for the uprising and wrote, also. And we hide it -- his\nfilms and his -- some things which were valuable.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And his portrait. He had a portrait done, 30\u2019s or something, still hanging.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And we came to it in the late 60\u2019s. A friend of -- of the house which we left that in her\nbasement, and she wrote to us that she has it, do you want it?",
        "Q: Oh, wow.",

        "A: I-It was a long one. We -- we just took, you know, break for the night and it -- everything was\nempty and things were trashed out because I think the Russians already took care of the -- of the\nbetter things and left it there, yeah. There were chicken wandering around, but no sign of -- of\nGermans, who used to live there. So we came to Elba river, and there on one side were the\nRussians, on the other side were -- were Americans. And the Russians read what the Belgians\ngave them, whatever they had and -- and they just said --",

        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Why didn\u2019t you want to go back to Poland?",
        "A: Well, it was Communism, Stalin. And for Stefan nothing to do there.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: And where were you staying?",
        "A: I was staying in a -- a -- a kind of a camp which sorted out people, you know, where they go,\nwhat -- what they want to do, or advertise in the papers. There were certain paper -- papers which\nwere names of people who -- who are looking for someone.",

Well, we just didn\u2019t\ndo anything to them. We were kind to them. But, you know, I don\u2019t know, every German, they --\nthey went through certain bad times, the -- the bombardment and -- and -- and this whole Hitler\nidea, that not everybody was with it, but they went along with him.

        "Q: But how did you make that decision, since you hadn\u2019t been able to make that decision before?\nYou\u2019re still with your family, so you must be feeling some obligation towards them.",
        "Q: I see. Really? So you left through that hidi -- that -- that tunnel? Is that how you got out of\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So then, how did you get out?",

        "Q: Right. And do you think that the -- the Polish ca -- the Catholics that you were meeting, the\nnon-Jews that you were meeting understood that there was such a [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Why especially men?",
        "Q: Oh, oh, taking in Jewish men, uh-huh, I see what you mean, yes, right. So they could be easily\nfound out. So do you think more women were -- were saved in these circumstances than men --",
        "Q: -- because it was less dangerous?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Right.",

The -- the -- the surrounding, and you know, somebody\u2019s\nelse house you live, and tha -- there was a lack of food. There was a -- our housekeeper, who\nused to come to our regular place where we used to live, and she brought some food from -- from\nreich.

        "A: And it would -- was a -- a very bad job, I should say.",
        "A: Yeah, they -- they couldn\u2019t come out of it right. And once they were arrested, all of them, and\nthere was a saying all over the ghetto that something bad is coming, and they were -- and they let\nthem out in a couple of days. So we didn't know much about it, what was going on. We knew the\n[indecipherable] commando, which was in later years used to get people out of the houses, and\nmarch them to Umschlagplatz.",

        "A: -- but of course later on it\u2019s -- it\u2019s [indecipherable] 1t was tragic.",
        "A: Yeah, well, not much, not much. That it -- 1t was chaotic at first, you know?",
        "A: But later on when they decided to -- to -- to do that, th-there was smuggling of -- of weapons\nand I heard about it, I knew that exists.",

        "A: And he and his colleagues left. And that was a walking march, cause they didn\u2019t have any\ncars, nothing --",
        "A: -- right, yeah. It was something somebody [indecipherable]. And he went to Lvov, which is\nLviv now. [indecipherable]. And they found out there is no -- no army, nothing.

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, at -- at first he was -- he opened a little store or whatever in books, but he didn\u2019t -- he\ndidn\u2019t succeed. So he -- he got -- he got -- he had the friend in the taxation department and she\ngave him a ausweiss to go to ghetto. And [indecipherable] the people with taxes. Of course, he\ndidn\u2019t -- there wasn\u2019t anyone to whom he can give the taxes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I think so, but I don\u2019t -- don\u2019t recall that.",

        "A: -- yeah, yeah, right.",
        "A: No, he didn\u2019t. He -- he just tried to get to the certain places, and there was nobody, or they\nchanged their address, or they not living any more, yeah. So that was his job, and that\u2019s why he\ngot the ausweiss, which let him go into the --",
        "A: -- yeah. So he visited his friends, his Jewish friends, and he dow -- he visited us too, and he\nbrought sardines from Portugal, and soap.",
        "A: Which was a very important thing. Kind of a -- is kind of a large --",
        "A: Is kind -- yeah.",
        "A: Well, oh once a week or --",
        "A: -- something, yeah.",
        "A: Right. And he -- he told me finally in October -- think it was October, \u201942 or some -- that his\nausweiss 1s running out and if I want to come out to his apartment, I am welcome.",
        "A: I didn't think anything about it. Well, you know, it -- it -- well, going back it\u2019s so difficult. It\u2019s\nso difficult to -- to know what I\u2019d been thinking each time, after each catastrophe. It -- 1t\u2019s very\nhard to thi -- maybe I didn't think at all.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: W-We were -- we were friends, yeah.",
        "A: Or re -- I know -- I knew some people who lived with him --",
        "A: -- and that was the connection, it was -- he -- he had a -- a [indecipherable] who was\nFinkelstein actually. And they had the an-antique store in Warsaw -- I mean, before the war, and\nshe lived there and another couple, a Polish couple live. The apartment was large --",
        "A: -- as -- for the -- for the Steins.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. This was one --\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: Yeah, was a -- was a job.",
        "A: It was a job for ausweiss, you know.",
        "A: Right. And I don\u2019t remember, I just went there and was told that I -- I can work there. And\nthey were sewing the camouflage outside, the camouflage an-and the white part was underneath\nso they could, you know, in snow -- in snow, it doesn\u2019t show. And I didn\u2019t know how to sew on\nthat, you know, sewing machine. So I was -- hadn\u2019t finished some of the thing. And th-the hours\nwere terrible, because it was -- I don\u2019t remember, from eight to -- to one or two o-or from four to\n-- to 12 o\u2019clock at night. And we were fall asleep, of course, all of us. And we got food there, and\nthey brought it in large kettle with soup, which wasn\u2019t soup [indecipherable]. There was some --\nsome food at the very end, so it was lucky, you know, to get the --",
        "A: At the bottom of the p -- yeah.",
        "A: Well, some did, of course, yes. But -- and there was bread, I think to the na -- probably now\nit\u2019s a very -- very much looked after, this kind of bread which was dark -- black and you had all -\n- all seven grains, or eight grains, whatever.",
        "A: And -- and th -- I worked there, but th-the first time which I got into this big walk, you know,\nthrough the Warsaw to deportation that -- I wasn\u2019t at Tebbins, I was at home, whatever I want --\nwent to look for some -- something, I don\u2019t remember what. And I was swept out with this large\ncrowd which was filling in both sidewalks and the middle of the road, they were just going\npeople with children, with -- with bundles of -- of -- of food -- not food, I don\u2019t know what, and\nthat -- and we were going toward Meeska, toward the Umschlagplatz and the gates were closed\nwhen the took out the people from the -- from the houses, they closed the gates. You know,\nthat\u2019s kind of gates what you come at 11 o\u2019clock that used to be, and you had to wake up the --\nthe guy who takes care of the -- an-and give him 20 cents or whatever because you came late. So\nthey were -- they were closed tight --",
        "A: -- outside, right, yeah.",
        "A: Because the houses were -- they had that -- the gate was open over there, and you come in and\nwalk to the right or to the left or further down where it\u2019s called Pardvuka, which was a larger part\n[indecipherable] something like that, where the housekeepers were -- were cleaning the rugs\nfrom upstairs. A-And -- but one of -- if wi -- I recognized one of the policemen that I knew him,\nand he recognized me, and he showed me on the way to Umschlagplatz that one of the gates is a\nlittle bit open, not completely shut, and I followed that. Came out of the crowd and I thought\nwell, I\u2019ve nothing to lose, and sneak in the -- the -- the gate. And there was a lot of people there,\nand we waited for a couple of hours until everything calmed down, and the people who were\nhiding in -- in the apartments, they came out and they told us how to go to -- to different streets.\nBut the streets, you know, they -- the houses were cut like alleys so you can go through one\nstreet to another without coming out on the main street.",
        "A: And so I went home and they couldn\u2019t believe that I -- I am still there.",
        "A: Oh they -- they knew nobody -- nobody came out of it, and so they were very happy about it.",
        "A: Oh, we know a lot, but we thought, you know, Judenrat helping to that. That this 1s all some\nlies. Those are young boys who just fled, you know, the [indecipherable] and -- and th-that\u2019s not\ntrue, it\u2019s -- but we started to believe that is something wrong at the end of the line. But a lot of\npeople did believe.",
        "A: Even before that.",
        "A: Not trebli -- not a name --",
        "A: -- th-th-there were other names. There was Sobibor and there were -- th-there were -- that\nwasn\u2019t the only trebli --",
        "A: Treblinka was the one which took so many lives. That was the -- the end. There was no --\nnobody, you know, nobody a-as far as I know nobody escaped from Treblinka.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, do you?",
        "A: Yeah, maybe yeah. Because some were left to | -- sort out the -- whatever th-the others left.",
        "A: Yeah. But --",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Oh yeah, we knew about it, yeah.",
        "A: Cause we -- we had this bulletin from [indecipherable]",
        "A: Who -- who brought in the -- the bulletins.",
        "A: And we knew what was go-going on in the world, and it\u2019s -- it was getting, you know, better,\nand -- but who knew when it will end? We -- we t -- we thought at first, you know, when we\nlived outside the ghetto, that this will last half a year, a year --",
        "A: -- but not five.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, w-we -- we just didn\u2019t -- I -- we didn\u2019t have time to think about it, you know? I-It -- it\nwas struggling every day. Every day you need food, you need -- your mother is not well. It -- it\nwasn\u2019t the -- the only -- when we got this news, it was far away, and nobody cares. Nobody\ncared. There was a time which I later found out, that Americans and English knew everything\nwhat is going on. So -- not only through Karski, there were many other people who -- who came\nand -- and w-were telling what was going on, not only with Jews, but with Poles. And nobody\ncould believe that they\u2019re taking those people and just putting them under gas. At -- at first they\nwere just r -- large vans, which we\u2019ve heard about it. No -- nobody believed it. It was -- it was\nimpossible to believe. So everybody thought, you know, where are we going? But later on, it\nstarted to dawn on us that this is the end, and everybody who could -- there was building of hide-\na-way kind of things. You have a stove and you -- behind the stove there is a room there, and the\n-- SO 1-- you put the stove at -- at the -- at the entrance, and there was nobody there. So these\npeople survived. How they survived, it was terrible, because I was in one of those ones, and I\nwas told that there were small children with us, and the parents knew if we hear somebody\ncoming [indecipherable] or SS, or what -- whatever, that we ca -- we just have to smother the\nchild. Yes. And since then, when I went to one of those because I was not at home, I was going\nout, and there was an alarm that Ukrainians are coming, and I didn\u2019t go an -- any more to these\nhiding places, yeah.",
        "A: But there was a lot of these hiding places, and I think until they -- they -- the up -- uprising in\nghetto, that a lot of people were safe this way. Oh, I -- of course, I -- I don\u2019t know. A lot of\npeople outside the ghettos w-were saved to the --",
        "A: -- until the Polish uprising.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t remember exactly, but in my room there were probably 40.",
        "A: 40.",
        "A: 40.",
        "A: But th-there were other rooms, you know, where they were working. Actually, they -- I must\nsay on behalf of Tebbins that he was giving those ausweiss rather knowingly, that those people\ndon\u2019t know how to sew.",
        "A: Including me, yeah.",
        "A: No, I -- no, I started to -- to use the machine when I was out of there, yeah. So that was --",
        "A: No, no --",
        "A: -- nobody, nobody. When the -- that -- that was kind of a relief, that was nobody there except\nthe supervisors. One was called Jan -- Jahn -- Jan -- H -- J-a-h-n. And when I was liberated\nalready outside in Quakenbrick where we li -- used to live for awhile at the -- with the Polish\npress, I saw a man on the street and I thought it was Jahn, and I told Stefan, he said, oh, you have\nideas. I saw him another time, and I was so sure that it was Jahn, but Stefan said no, that\u2019s\nprobably not. I gave up. You give up on -- on the lot of things. When we were at the -- under the\nbureau [indecipherable] under the British and we occupied as part of Germany, we got the print\nshop for our -- our newspaper. And the -- the owner of the print shop was coming to those\njournalists, and telling them, I never was a Nazi, I never -- never had anything to do with them,\nand [indecipherable] a-anything, he would say. And they were listening just, you know. Nothing\n-- nothing happened to any of those people, and he was a Nazi, there is no -- but there were a lot\nof them who had to join the -- the -- the party, because of their living. He had very nice print\nshop and -- and he wanted to keep it, yeah.",
        "A: N-No, no.",
        "A: No, that that I seen. I didn\u2019t.",
        "A: That\u2019s -- you know, it\u2019s difficult for me to say, I -- I -- I do-don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I -- until -- right -- well, maybe a few months. Until the moment when the -- the second\nUmschlagplatz happened to me, and then I stopped working, and the only food it was -- which\nwas smuggled and w-we bought, and it was pretty bad.",
        "A: No, I didn't.",
        "A: That was July \u00b042.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: 20 - something, 25\".",
        "A: It was a -- a crowd which is difficult to explain. We were walking one by one, and the\nchildren didn\u2019t cry. It was quiet.",
        "A: Yes. Nobody tried to escape. We were paralyzed. I-It was a unbelievable scene, just those\ndogs marching, an-and there weren\u2019t too many Gestapo people, they called -- those are special\nforces -- were special forces I heard, at home. And at -- that what you struck by the absolutely\nparalyzed people walking. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s unbelievable, I -- it -- 1t -- the -- the way I -- I -- I looked at\nthis Jewish policeman, I thought I know him, and he kind of made it -- eye contact to me, and I\nthought he showed me with his eyes the -- the next gate, which was how -- and that was it.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know. Some people were not, you know. Some people made their way probably\nin other gates. I -- I have no idea.",
        "A: It was quiet.",
        "A: Yeah. Maybe a -- a whimper of a -- the child or something li --",
        "A: -- but no, no, no. The same was the second time when I was at Umschlagplatz.",
        "A: Nobody said anything.",

        "A: -- yeah. And I was walking, y-you know, to get some money or food, I don\u2019t know what. I\nwent to Paviar Street, and all of a sudden I see a rush of people, but not as big, not as large as the\nprevious one, the July one. And I was caught in it, and I walked with them. A young woman\nwalked with me and we exchanged some words, but not much. And we went to a barrack which\nwas -- I don\u2019t know what it was before, you know, because it\u2019s -- was kind of remod with table\nand -- and chairs. And the chairs were made of steel, you know, the kind of -- something like\nwhat we use now when a lot of people come. And we found a place and we sit down and waited\nfor the train.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: And outside there was no -- no Germans inside, or maybe they were at the doors, but outside\nthe -- were Ukrainians with dogs. And that was it, it was kind of quiet, nobody talked unless\nwhispered to somebody. And I noticed that some people are going around and behind me, going\nto something which is open, and stairs are leading. And I talked to my companion, I said, I think\nthere is something there. And she said, yes I know. How do you know? Somebody probably\nescape, but she said Ukrainians come later and shoot the people who are hiding. So there is no\nway. I said, well let\u2019s try. And she tells -- she said no, I don\u2019t want to because I still hope that PII\nfind my family. I didn\u2019t say it -- anything.

And I went there and I -- I just sit down on\nthe floor. And it was quiet, very quiet. I think I -- my heart was, of course, pounding. It stopped\npounding after maybe I don\u2019t know, half an hour or so. And I probably fell asleep, because what\nI heard the next, 1t was [indecipherable] of these chairs and steps and later on schnell, schnell, the\nUkrainians with the dogs, and it -- it took quite awhile. And I felt that people are around me,\nyeah.",

Kind of a early\nmorning, we heard voices. One vo-voice, or two maybe, and they said, just stay where you are,\ndon\u2019t move. And we -- we thought what is -- but in Polish, not [indecipherable] and we thought,\nwa -- what is it?

        "A: Or -- or once we had to run through the kitchen entrance, run away from the same kind of\npeople.",
        "A: Yeah, well --",

        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t know, no.",
        "A: Not yet, not yet, because Stefan always reminds me when he came and potatoes were boiling\nand I was asking my mother, mom, ho-how much salt, do I put salt? So it was a --",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "A: Of course, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, well, it was different, yes, 1t was different, but th -- they suffered a lot, too, and all of a\nsudden, you know, comes a German outfit and rounds up several blocks and takes out people\nfrom trams and take them to -- to Germany to work, or just shoot them for no reason. And some\nwho were taking part in underground were taken out and you know, they -- they were shooting\nthem or taking them to a concentration camp. So they suffered, yeah --",
        "A: -- a lot.",
        "A: I mean, in regular circumstances, Poles suffered a lot. But you can\u2019t compare to what was\nhappening in ghettos. There is no comparison.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. The one I met, yeah.",
        "A: Well, there were others who will come and ask for money and -- and other addresses where a\n-- where Jews live [indecipherable] you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -- 1t\u2019s always a -- and it was also on\nthe Poles side, if you find a Gestapo or SS or whatever, they find the house where Jews are\nhidden, they would shoot everybody or take everybody to a concentration camp.",
        "A: So it was -- it was quite a decision to take Jews in, especially men.",

        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Probably.",
        "A: Probably. Well, men usually, at the ghetto situation in the beginning and later, they choose to\ngo east.",
        "A: And that was a good idea. That -- thi -- it doesn\u2019t mean that they didn\u2019t wind up in a gulag.",
        "A: You know, for different reasons. But there 1s a -- was a much higher chance for them to stay\nalive.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yeah. We knew.",
        "A: And Stefan left at four o\u2019clock, the first of August. But, well, it -- it was also a terrible time,\nterrible time, especially at the end when the uprising went down.",
        "A: Well, we had to wait for the Red Cross to -- to make sure that we are -- be treated as -- not as\nbandits, but as fighters.",
        "A: Right, right.",

        "A: And we came to it in the late 60\u2019s. A friend of -- of the house which we left that in her\nbasement, and she wrote to us that she has it, do you want it?",
        "A: So we did. It was all in holes and Stefan took it into basement. So Peter and I, we took it out\nand I started walking -- Connecticut was at that time famous for the small art stores and I went\nfrom one to another and they said no, no.

        "A: A wagon, yeah. And we didn\u2019t know where we were going. So -- and once in awhile they\nwould open up that, and a crowd of people were coming with vegetables and all kinds of -- of\ngoodies.",
        "A: Yeah, and --",
        "A: On a train.",
        "A: On a train, yeah.",

        "A: So we knew that we were not going to Auschwitz.",
        "A: No, they were -- they w -- those were all the Germans who -- would took care of the train.\nAnd the same was the -- at the camp too. There was one accident. They warn us that we have to\n[indecipherable] the -- the windows, taking care by hanging the -- the blankets or something, and\none blanket fell, half of it, and the guard from the camp shoot, and shot a li -- a young girl from\nour -- yeah.

        "A: No, not the camp --",
        "A: -- but close by, yeah, very close by, yeah. Dresno.",
        "A: Well, it was hunger, and that was it. But at Christmastime we got Red Cross packages, right.\nOne package like that was for four people, and there were cigarettes and some sweets, goodies.\nAnd we divided it, who smoked took the cigarettes and -- and so on, we divided that too, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, no.",

        "A: Very much, yeah. Well, they came, you know, and they opened a food storage of Nazis.\nThere were a few Nazis killed and I -- I don\u2019t know what they were before they came. I think\nprobably some Russians did that. And -- and they came and they opened the storage with rice\nand who knows what, and started to feed us. It wasn\u2019t a good idea because we were not prepared\nfor that, yeah.",
        "A: Well, a little bit, yeah.",

        "A: I-It was a long one. We -- we just took, you know, break for the night and it -- everything was\nempty and things were trashed out because I think the Russians already took care of the -- of the\nbetter things and left it there, yeah. There were chicken wandering around, but no sign of -- of\nGermans, who used to live there. So we came to Elba river, and there on one side were the\nRussians, on the other side were -- were Americans.

And we went -- when we were living in England -- oh, we\nbought a house, and we were renting the upstairs and living downstairs. And it -- it -- it was a\nkind of -- quite shortcomings, a lot of shortcomings.

        "A: Well, probably is, but you know, I\u2019m not the only one who 1s open to tin -- t-telling. My\nPolish friends don\u2019t know much about it, they -- they know that I am Jewish, but that\u2019s all. They\n-- I don\u2019t think they want to listen to that. And I don\u2019t want to talk --",
