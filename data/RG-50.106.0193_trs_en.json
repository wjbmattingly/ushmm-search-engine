        "Q: Just go back a little bit before the war. So you had family in Vienna. The majority of your\nrelatives was in Vienna. Then you had Uncle William in Maribor, just across the border and you\nhad grandparents in Czechoslovakia.",
        "A: And an aunt and uncle in Zagreb.",
        "Q: In Zagreb. So how much were the contacts maintained. Did you travel to those places? Did\nthey come to visit you?",
        "A: Well with the one, and I -- while we lived in the 20\" district in Vienna where I was born,\nthere the neighboring apartment was and again by that time Uncle Willie had already got money.\nSo and there was his father, my grandfather. So he lived there with his young daughter. Now\nwhen he died and I still remember when he died because my mother was terribly, she was -- to\nme what she always told me about him I always compared him with Fiddler on the Roof because\nhe was selling agricultural machinery. And he always, he always told me that, he always talked\nto God because he would have to go plow a field.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nBut you know when Pesach come always in spring, right, when fathers have to buy agricultural\nmachinery for their field. So he would say now will you get them to buy from me? You must.\nI\u2019ve got all these children. I\u2019ve got to buy clothes for them. And it all costs money. Where do I\nget it from? From you. You must do that and then obviously he always managed to get some\norders. Because that was a time when farmers wanted. And he would then say well thank you\nvery much. You\u2019ve done it again. Now remember. The year, next year. They\u2019ll want the same\nservice. You know he was very much, to me he was always representing Fiddler on the Roof.",
        "Q: How was your childhood? How do you remember your childhood cause these were the years\nbefore the war, Hitler\u2019s rise to power?",
        "A: I was you know we lived in this 20\" district which was all Jewish. And when I went into\nprimary school there wasn\u2019t a non-Jewish child in my class. But as I, when these things as I told\nyou, my father was one of the early free thinkers in Vienna. This was quite an important thing.\nAnd so he reasoned and because my mother came from very old sort of background so she was\nvery keen to bring her children up as good German. But my father had reined(?) her and he kept\narguing that you want our children to have a moral behavior. But you don\u2019t need religion for\nthat. You can bring them up as moral citizens, that they care for what their society, this was the\nearly socialism.\nI mean and then and he was involved in the abolition of the monarchy. And also he, when the\nFirst World War, when the Austrian empire lost, there was no demobilization. Wherever,\nwhoever had survived, wherever they were, the soldiers I mean, they could just go home.\nNobody would help them. There was no telephone. Nothing. So my mother was then expecting\nher second child which was created when he came home on this special leave. So she didn\u2019t\nknow whether she still had a husband, which you know I never could understand when I was a\nlittle -- this brother of mine, she always favored. And I always was very jealous of him. First of\nall he was a weakling because she had been pregnant for then, very difficult period. And I was\nvery strong. I was born in 22, when Uncle Willie was already supporting us.\nSo and he would say, he would sit his children next to each other and he would under the table\npinch me and I would go plunk. And my mother would say now don\u2019t hit your brother and he\nwould sit there like with an angel face. He hadn\u2019t done anything. He would, nothing.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nSo he was never my favorite brother.",
        "Q: That\u2019s your brother Kurt? It was Otto who was your favorite brother.",
        "A: But Otto, Otto on the other hand was -- the age difference you see when you are six years and\nyour brother is 16, you think he is an old man. And you\u2019re a child. But then when he was 80 and\nI was 70, it was no age difference. The age difference disappears once, and he has always been\nmy one. And he has always been very innovative. He has been a fantastic. I really miss him.",
        "Q: So how were you brought up? You said you weren\u2019t brought up in the Jewish tradition but\nyou were brought up in this humanistic?",
        "A: Yes well we were all very left wing. Kurt actually had an article published in the Vienna\nWorker, which was newspaper of the left wing when he was about ten years old.",
        "Q: That\u2019s precocious.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What did he write his article about?",
        "A: Yes, he read the newspapers and he wrote an article and you know obviously an article\nwritten for the Worker by a ten year old. And they knew my father. And also when I was at\nschool, in primary school. By that time we had the first social democratic government. And they\nwere really wonderful. There were many Jews involved. So the education minister knew my\nfather. But my father by that time had a job working for his brother in law, Paul\u2019s father.",
        "Q: What did he do for Paul\u2019s father?",
        "A: He was a salesman. He sold the textiles.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",

        "A: In Yugoslavia.",
        "Q: Did he speak the language?",
        "A: Well he spoke Hungarian and he also learned different Slovenish and Croat but I guess he\ncan\u2019t have been very fluent. But he knew enough to sell.",
        "Q: So when did Uncle Willie get rich?",
        "A: Well because he had this family.",
        "Q: When?",
        "A: When. Long before I was born. Because when I was born, actually his mother in law came\nbecause there was this age difference between my elders ten years and you know he was 1912\nand I was 19 --. She came, she met Uncle Willie in Vienna. And she met my parents and she\nsaid to my -- couldn\u2019t you have taken care having another child. Why do you need another child\nbecause she wasn\u2019t really keen on her son in law to having all these burdens. He was very good.",
        "Q: So was he supporting his family?",
        "A: She helped him. She said you will go to Yugoslavia and start making textiles.",
        "Q: But after he made it in Yugoslavia, was he supporting his brothers and sisters as well? Was he\nsending money to your --",
        "A: No, she didn\u2019t have a say in \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "Q: No, no. Your Uncle Willie did he support his brothers and sisters? Did he send money for\nexample to your mother or to \u2014",
        "A: No she didn\u2019t, he did.",
        "Q: Yeah he did, yeah. Did he?",
        "A: He did but she didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Did he do that on regular basis?",
        "A: No we were not her favorite. I mean obviously she wanted her daughter to --",
        "Q: Yes, yes but I\u2019m talking about your uncle. Did your uncle regularly send money so to your\nfamily and to Taya and to his father.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And to the family in Zagreb?",
        "A: Always and he came to visit and that\u2019s where I remember that we were going into the poshest\nexpensive restaurant. You know we were living in this you know middle to lower middle class\nJewish district.",
        "Q: Do you remember any special occasion when he would come. Would he come for holidays or\nwould he come for birthdays?",
        "A: Yeah and then he took us to some, and there was dancing. And Auntie Taya who never\nmarried and her role was always unlucky in love. That much I \u2014 she was in love with a father\nwith a man who was the father of four daughters and lived below us. So and he had a son so\nwhen she couldn\u2019t get the father she fell in love with the brother and it was the son. So she was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nalways unlucky in love. But she didn\u2019t want to admit this in front of the brother who was\nsupporting her. So we went to a restaurant where there was dancing. So there were gigolos. So\nshe went. We thought she had gone to the loo but then she left, she left the table. She talked to\nthe waiter that one of the gigolos. You didn\u2019t of course know who would come and ask her. And\nwe were all saying you know \u2014 she was a bit fat. She wasn\u2019t very attractive. But she felt she had\nto show her brother and you know when I heard my father, when once she was dancing, Uncle\nWillie was saying, I don\u2019t think he really wanted her, don\u2019t get excited. You know this one, Paul\nwon\u2019t remember that because he was a few years younger.",
        "Q: Where would you go for a posh dinner. Do you remember any --",
        "A: Yes, in the center, you know in the stadt, in the inner city. I mean with all the, Sacher,\nSacher Koffle.",
        "Q: And he would take you there for any special occasion or just every time he came?",
        "A: When he came. I don\u2019t, I can\u2019t remember why he would come. And I mean he, I think he\nwas really, very, very fond of my mother because to him she was like his mother. She had\nbrought him up. So you know you can understand.",
        "Q: Did you go to Maribor when you were children? Did you go to visit them?",
        "A: Yes, I also remember that my aunt, Uncle Willie\u2019s wife had a sister, you know the daughter of\nthis older, earlier one in fact. And she came. We were then in Rovas Goslate [ph] now and\nUncle Willie asked my father to be responsible for the running. He had another factory in r, no,\nthat was what was the place. I can\u2019t remember now.",
        "Q: It was in Maribor. There were two factories in Maribor.",
        "A: No, but it was in a different place because my father, he asked my father, put my father there\nto run that place. Actually I learned the song, Chacharano, Chacharano [ph] because we heard\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nthe soldiers walk past and sing it. And so and then after my, after the director of this factory\ncame back from his summer leave, my father took us to Rovas Goslate and at that time the sister\nof my aunt, uncle Willie\u2019s wife had a, she was married but not to a rich man. And but she was\nalways the pretty jealous of her sister who had done so well. And she had a little girl who was a\nyear younger than I was. That, well actually I think it was two years before the Nazis, before,\nmust have been in 1936.",
        "Q: Do you remember what their names were? The sister and the daughter?",
        "A: No, whatever.",
        "Q: Cause Paul\u2019s mother was called \u2014",
        "A: Paul will remember. Paul will remember. And so my aunt then thought well she\u2019ll take her\nsister for summer holiday to Spoleto, to Split, which was a sea side. And she would have to take\nher sister and her little girl. So these were two young women who were a team to be admired by\nmen. And so we were staying. And so she needed somebody for this niece of hers. And I suited\nthe bill. And so they asked, she asked my parents and they asked me and I said yes, of course I'll\ngo. I was keen to go. And for me it was a (inaudible) to herself. She was about my age. We\u2019ll\nhave a good time. But this, so we had the room together. I had the room with this niece of hers.\nAnd they were two sisters. So every evening in a very popular town. For me this was heaven.\nAnd we\u2019d have dinner in this restaurant where there was a lot of dancing. And these two women\nwere very keen to be asked to dance and they really were. So this younger little girl, whatever\nher name was, was very worried that her mother was betraying her father. Because there were\nmen. We all had (inaudible). And this young girl always stood at the bar because the two sisters\nhad the room next to her, also had a (inaudible). And they were all men calling. Hello. Hello,\nhello. Go for walks you know. And she\u2019d say I can\u2019t. What does mother do? And then one of\nthem -- I mean still were men (inaudible) with her. He and one of these guys who were\ninterested. I mean these were holiday flirtations came and she must have told him that she had\nthis daughter. And he came and brought a doll.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "Q: A dog?",
        "A: A doll and when she saw this doll she goes (sound effect) and the head of the doll fell off and\nI was like poor doll you know and she was very, I mean that was very stupid. But that man\nobviously had no children and wasn\u2019t married. And then she told him. Did you tell him that I\nlike playing with dolls. And but she had, she was much smaller than -- I was a tall girl and\nlooked much older. But she looked like a little girl. So her mother got away with it, saying she\nhad a very little girl. So this guy was obviously trying to endear himself to her and bringing\ndolls. But the little girl wasn\u2019t that little, not very young. But then one evening, I also remember\nso they were, we were sitting and eating and the music played for dancing. And a young man\ncame walked, so that he looked that he was coming to our table, so these two sort of you know.\nAnd do you know who he asked. Me. So. And I wasn\u2019t there you know for me, it was -- I\nwasn\u2019t going. I couldn\u2019t dance. But that really was infradig.",
        "Q: So this was still sort of the good times before everything went, so when would that be\nroughly, in 32.",
        "A: Well it was in 1936.",
        "Q: Oh 36. Ok. Yeah. But how did you were there, you came from a family where father was\npolitically engaged, so how is that commented in the family, Hitler\u2019s rise to power and the rise of\nNazism in general. Was that something that you discussed with your father? Was that something\nthat worried them greatly or did they think it would just pass?",
        "A: No my father was so committed to this and actually there was a, the guy who was called\nTambour. I don\u2019t know whether that name means some -- he was one of the major politicians, a\nJewish. And he was in the government and the Social Democratic and actually he arranged for us\nto move then. Because we only had a very small apartment. When my father came home every\nmonth. He was home for at least one week because Yugoslavia had a law that only Yugoslavs\ncould work for Yugoslav firms. So my father was an Austrian citizen and he was working for a\nYugoslav firm. So Uncle Willie actually got him a certificate that he was working for a Czech\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nfirm. So you could, a foreigner could work for a Czech firm. But and that was actually the\nreason then that when the going got bad, when we were expelled from Yugoslavia that my father\nwas taken to prison. Because before that, he had that certificate and he\u2019d write the politician and\nthe police in these places where he was selling because you couldn\u2019t hide that you were selling\nYugoslav produced goods.",
        "Q: But that happened after the Anschluss and after you fled Yugoslavia.",
        "A: So before that he would come. And he would still be friends and this was this guy who was in\nthe, he was never in the government because he was in Yugoslavia. But he still had this friend\nand when the minister of education came to visit the primary school where I was, he looked, he\nwent into the classroom and he looked at the register. And he saw my, Trude Grunewald. So\nTrude Grunewald. The minister of education and what does he want and he said is your father\nSiegfried Grunewald? And I said yes. And he said give him my best greetings. I am very fond.\nWas I (sigh) you know when I told my father you know he was thrilled. So then when the,\nTambour, then we got an apartment in the Karl Marx which was then a new. I don\u2019t know\nwhether you realize that this Austrian social, first social democratic government pioneered\ncouncil housing. They built these council houses which was then followed, and I remember\nseeing King Edward who them resigned because of Mrs. Simms.",
        "Q: A love story.",
        "A: So because anybody, any important person that came to him, they always took them to the\nKarl because it was a fantastically planned building.",
        "Q: So this was the Karl Marx hof?",
        "A: Yeah this was a, remember being and you\u2019ve been to Vienna.",
        "Q: I\u2019ve been to Vienna yes.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: But you haven\u2019t seen the Karl Marx. It was in Grinzing so I then had to change schools.\nAnd this is where you saw me, when I was at the play.",
        "Q: And this was a non-Jewish neighborhood now\u2019?",
        "A: There was no, there were just a few. You see sort of the revere, the government wanted to put\na few Jewish middle class families with all, because all the others were people who they had\ntaken out of the slums and put them into brand new bright apartments. And I mean the\nconservatives would say, they will also be black. They will all be turned \u2014 but they kept it and in\na sense that saved our lives. We never had very atrocious persecution because most of them were\nin a pro, I mean the whole -- there was Dollfuss before the Anschluss and also what nobody\nknew. We didn\u2019t even know that when we left there. That there was sort of the top floor was\nsupposed to be for hanging up. There was one building in the center which had washing\nmachines in 1930, automatic -- well you just pressed the button as we do now and it washed.\nAnd it even had ironing. I would go and every apartment had two days per month in the washing\nmachine to do their wash.\nAnd my mother would take her sheets down, put them in the washing, take them out and I would\nthen come to help her iron them because she would just put them in the roller and I would take\nthem out the other side. And so all the important people, the VIPs that came were all shown.\nAnd King Edward was shown when we had our, there.",
        "Q: Was there an elevator as well?",
        "A: No it was ground floor. Actually there was a first floor where because there were no baths.\nYou couldn\u2019t have a, you had to go to this public bath. Again you could go however many times\nyou wanted as a, you have an apartment there. But there wasn\u2019t a lift there, the stairs.",
        "Q: But you said that this was about the time when you started feeling anti-Semitism in school?",
        "A: Yes, I had never experienced. I mean my mother was terribly upset because she took me to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nthis new school because I had gone to school 1n this very Jewish area. So anti-Semitism, and I\nwas a very unfriendly little girl. I never you know my mother she was very friendly. She knew\neverybody and everybody knew her. When she went shopping, she would take me. Well when I\nwas little, I would say, when her female friends say well hello little girl. And my mother said,\nwell say hello. It is not my friend. Why should I say hello. And I made up a story that I am not\nreally my parents\u2019 child. I loved the sea and I have been for one summer we had been to Tsir\nGranitsa [ph] which is a holiday resort. And that gave me the idea, I must have been a child of\ngypsies.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Because I was born by the sea and I made up that the gypsies were living by the sea because I\nliked it. They were, I would be the child of gypsies. But then my parents paid for me and so I\nam now adopted. I still remember my mother\u2019s face was always so upset and she always used to\nsay, why do you tell me this story. I said well you\u2019re not from the family, you\u2019re not from the\nseaside and I love the sea. So I must be. I was very logical really. But not to the, you know\nclever or what not.\nBut my father was all right because I was the apple of his eye. I couldn\u2019t do wrong and\nparticularly when I brought him greetings from the minister of education.",
        "Q: What would you say was the turning point where, when you and your family really realized\nthat things would go terribly wrong?",
        "A: Well, Otto my brother, ten years older, he went to the technological college in Vienna, not\nreally (inaudible). And he was there as being at you know technical and this was I mean Austria\nwas always anti-Semitic. There was a special police for, that looked after the universities. And\nevery year when the students come and those who came from Jewish parents, they had to walk\nthrough a court on both sides anti-Semites and they would just run and be beaten. And the police\nwould just stand there and not interfere.",
        "Q: When did that start, which year did that start?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: Well it was as long as I remember that my brother. That was long in 19, he must have been\nhe was born in 12 so he must have been about 22, 24 so in the early 30s but it might have been\nbefore because I only know because he -- a knuckle duster. You know what a knuckle duster. He\njoined when the Jews joined what was called the Schutzbund which was the organization to\ndefend the social democratic government. But there was a schutzbund for workers and there was\na schutzbund for students. And he was with the schutzbund for children. And he came home and\nhe showed me his knuckle duster. And he said I will not just be beaten. I will also return it and I\nwas greatly impressed.\nBut then and do you know we had Dollfuss, does the name Dollfuss. Well Dollfuss there was a\nin February 1934 there was a general strike because it involved, there was a Chris -- Dollfuss\nwas. You know what I find very interesting, all the partisan were socialists. You had Hitler was\na national socialist. Dollfuss and Schuschnigg were Christian Socialists. Every party was\nsocialist. It was the thing to be, but they were quite different from the \u2014 but they didn\u2019t. So we\nthen had the general strike and the Schutzbund the fighting unit was then and what they never\ntold that I mean but the Schutzbund means that. My brother also knew what but he never told\nthem that the Karl Marx, all the top floors you could walk. It was one kilometer, a sort of oval\nbuilding inside gardens and playgrounds and wash house and you know bars and everything. It\nwas all in it, but you could walk. Of course you could go up one stair and come out another. And\nthis enabled a lot of them, because there was lots of fighting.\nNow my brother Otto being, having been with the university students come fighting unit, and but\nhe knew my father was, and Schuschnigg. No, then that was later. In 1934 there was a general\nstrike and so there was fighting. They wanted to defend and Dollfuss and the Karl Marx building\nis a the flat ground, but there is the Hoinvalta [ph] which was a high, when there was a big\nfootball ground and this is where Dollfuss put cannon to shoot them so they couldn\u2019t, they only\nhad machine guns. But they fought and so they were -- I was then 12 years old and all the\nschools were closed. And when I turned up at school, my friends always thought oh there comes\nthe heroine. But this was when the first, that the first should you know kill -- because and also,\nso my brother had to report because they all knew their players were the reservists.\nBut then my father was already traveling in there as well, so he knew that my mother was home\nwith two small children. So he got permission to go home. And when he came and we were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nsitting because we were glued to the wireless because everybody wanted to know what\u2019s going\non. And we were deadly silent as my mother was very worried that her son she knew he was\nwith them. And there he came and she was all over him. And he said I\u2019ve only come, leave to\nfind out how you all are coping but I\u2019ve got to go back. And my mother, you can\u2019t go back. I\nmean she depended on him to help her you know in the household. He was her big help. There\nwas a wonderful relationship. He was very close to her. She was very close to him. He wasn\u2019t\nvery close to my father.\nSo when he wanted to go and was going to there, she knelt. I still, and clutched his legs and\ndidn\u2019t want him to go. And he tore himself loose and he walked out. And we were all sitting you\nknow the two of us, Kurt my brother and my mother was tears and crying. And I didn\u2019t know\nwhat to say.\nAnd then we heard the first shot and of course we sat there and we thought he had just gone.\nHe\u2019s dead. A few minutes later he came back. I think I wrote this in my auto (phone ringing)",
        "Q: Ok.",
        "A: It sort of is the basis for my concern for the poorest and for my sort of left wing politics began\nthen.",
        "Q: In 43, no in 34.",
        "A: In 1934. Because my brother, then my father was in Yugoslavia and couldn\u2019t reach us\nbecause we had no telephone there. And but he had a colleague who was also from Vienna, also\na Jewish family and they lived in the second district which was all Jewish. So there would be no\nSchutzbund by it. And he told his colleagues to bring his family in Vienna and get them to\ncontact us that we could stay with them. We should get out of this dangerous because there were\ntimes driving. If they saw a face coming to a window, they would shoot and of course we were\nall keen to look out. And anyway we then went to this family and my brother when we listened\nto the radio, they then executed some of the leaders of the strike which were some of his friends.\nSo you know this was my first sort of real experience of how awful and how extreme\nconservative, extreme fascist governments can be.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nAnd then Otto said to me, now listen. Little sister, listen carefully. When somebody comes, he\nwon\u2019t tell you he\u2019s a policeman but if he asks you any question, you just say I don\u2019t know. Soa\npoliceman came and my mother sort of just looked at me. She didn\u2019t say anything. And he then\nsaid what\u2019s your name little girl. And I said I don\u2019t know. How old are you? I don\u2019t know.\nThis policeman must have thought this poor kid doesn\u2019t even, must be crazy. For every\nquestion. I just said I don\u2019t know. I mean just as well that he didn\u2019t know. And he didn\u2019t ask me\nwhy you would say -- I might have said well my brother told me to.",
        "Q: But logically you should have said I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: So this was when I sort of the first experience because and I mean he said to me. Because if\nyou said that I you know had gone out to, go back to the Schutzbund then your brother might be\nput into jail and you don\u2019t want that. No. So I always said no, I don\u2019t know. And well then came\nof course Dollfuss was assassinated. And Schuschnigg came.",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: And that was in 1937. Dollfuss was, Schuschnigg. And I mean both of them were really\nextreme Christian socialists. And they were both anti-Semitic and they were the, followed -- I\nmean very much the same policies as Hitler. But they didn\u2019t want Austria to be part of Germany.\nAnd so that was why Dollfuss was assassinated. Then his buddy Schuschnigg became the\nchancellor and Hitler asked, by that time Hitler was in government in Germany. And of course\nhe being an Austrian and having been in jail in Austria, obviously now he is a, I mean\nGotitmaster fell and it was such a pity that he committed suicide but they couldn\u2019t you know\nput him in jail and really in --",
        "Q: Who? Hitler?",
        "A: Yeah because he must have been. Because it was so obvious. He was a little guy who would\nnever dreamt of being Hitler and people would shout Heil Hitler. I mean when you now see the\nfilms when he made his speeches. He looks like a maniac.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "Q: How did it seem back then? You saw him. You saw him when he came to Vienna in 38. How\ndid it feel? How did it look?",
        "A: For me it was really a mass hypnosis. I had never been subjected. I mean for me this was a\nturning point altogether. Again it was Otto who rang me and developed a story. He told me to go\nto the Yugoslav embassy and ask for Mr. Miderman. Take our passport. When you meet Mr.\nMiderman, he rang home. He was out. And he was very clever because he was, you know there\nwas Bloomsbury house in London. Have you heard of that?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: This is where all the refugees had to register. Right. His registration number was 257. He got\nhere very soon. And you know how? Because the year before in 19, summer 1937 he went with\nKurt, my two brothers went hitchhiking. And in Switzerland, a lift, asking for a lift. And this was\nthe thing for students to do. And they got a lift in Switzerland from an English Jewish couple\nwho were driving around Europe. And they quickly established that they were also Jewish\nbecause by that time it was also already on the cards that we were going to be part of Germany.\nAnd Otto was always innovative. They were driving in a car. And they then went to Salzburg.\nAnd of course a Jewish couple stayed in a posh hotel. But they stayed in the new Salzburg. But\nhe said to Kurt look we get up early tomorrow and we wash their car. Make it look clean,\nsparkling. When they come down they see that. And they saw that and they thought these two are\nnice lads. You know. Washed our car. And they were driving to Vienna so they took them to\nthe, they showed them around Vienna. We were in Yugoslavia when they were there. And so\nOtto then -- when Hitler, when Austria was annexed wrote to them and said please can you send\nus, send me a fraudulent correspondence. Say that I am at the, what they were doing in London\nwas to buy second hand cars and sell them and he said you write to me as if I was your, working\nfor you and your agent in Austria in buying old car and shipping them to you. And they did that.\nAnd he was so early so and then he always liked English. He made his what would be called\nschool leaving certificate and they had to write a long essay and he wrote it about Jack London in\nEnglish.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "Q: So when did he go to England? Which year? 38?",
        "A: In 1938 before. He was the first one of us.",
        "Q: So before the Anschluss.",
        "A: No after the Anschluss.",
        "Q: Just after.",
        "A: But a few weeks after because he immediately -- and also I mean there were so many\ninteresting things. We had my youngest uncle, my youngest paternal uncle was a very nice guy.\nDuring the First World War he went onto the allied side. He went over from the Austrian Empire\nand he was in China. They went to China then. From, from Russia and my grandparents didn\u2019t\nknow. There was no communication. There was no register where he was or whether he was still\nalive and he turned up then so and he was quite a, I mean I loved him.",
        "Q: Do you remember his name?",
        "A: Amin, Amin Grunewald and he had a very attractive wife who walked out on him. But\nanyway he came to Vienna after the Anschluss and said I\u2019Il take you all to Czechoslovakia.\nYou'll be all right there. They all perished in Auschwitz. At first in Theresienstadt. I have still\ngot cousins in Czechoslovakia. In Czech.",
        "Q: But did they think that Czechoslovakia was safe?",
        "A: Yeah and untouchable because said well the Czechs give us visas. And he said I\u2019Il tell you\nwhat. I marry Trude. He wanted to marry, I mean just as a formality. He didn\u2019t want me as his\nwife but and I worked out, I would be my brother\u2019s aunt and would be my mother\u2019s sister in law\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nand I had great fun. But ultimately the dream of that. He said you\u2019ll be next and so they were. So\nOtto was very clever.",
        "Q: So what was the plan. So obviously Otto was the mastermind of your escape.",
        "A: Was the mastermind.",
        "Q: What was the plan in 38?",
        "A: Well the plan was that he would go to and he did go to England and he would get us English\nvisas. And he did but much later.",
        "Q: Did, who financed all this? Did he have money?",
        "A: Well he just, you know he worked as a packer in this slave labor. I mean he had a degree as\nan electrical engineer. But they would not employ him that way.",
        "Q: And how did he get to England? Did he hitchhike or?",
        "A: No, no. He went by train. But that was very early. But then he, it\u2019s interesting. All my life\nthat\u2019s why I say he\u2019s been my role model. Because he would then write to me what I should do.\nHe wouldn\u2019t write to Kurt. Because Kurt was just weak. He was a sick, sickly child so he was\nafraid to go out. He stayed home. Only I and I was, he told Otto said, you dress yourself as one\nof the German girls and then you go and see Mr. Miderman. And on that day, was a day as you\nsaw, Hitler came to Austria, to Vienna.",
        "Q: So Hitler comes to Vienna and you go to the Yugoslav embassy dressed up in Hitler Jugend\noutfit.",
        "A: And a\u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "Q: But you ended up in the crowds as well at one point. Can you describe that?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, because you see the thing was, he didn\u2019t he said well you just go by the\nunderground. We have them. There was an underground already in Vienna and that went right to\nthe Ringstrasse, you know the circular road. And that\u2019s where you go out. Have, will have to\nget out and then you walk along and that\u2019s where. What he didn\u2019t know and I didn\u2019t know was\nfirst of all, all the Nazi government that quickly took over and welcomed Hitler, was offering\nfree transport to all the Austrians. To come and welcome the Fuhrer. That\u2019s why there were all\nthe people there. And I didn\u2019t know that. But I went on when everybody went onto the\nunderground so I followed. And then I got into a carriage and there was an elderly lady and there\nwas a place next to her.\nSo I sat there in my nice uniform and she said you\u2019re also going to welcome the Fuhrer. And at\nthat point I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to say because I was taught you know a moral way and you\nmust never tell a lie. And that was sort of not, but then I -- and I must say on that day, as I sat\nthere. I kind of, I was catapulted into a little, I felt now I have to make decision, lie or no lie. And\nthat\u2019s what I did. So then when we have got to the circular road and we all got out. There were\nthese masses of people already there. And just then his carriage came and he was standing there.\nLike you see in the film.",
        "Q: So you saw Hitler?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How close were you?",
        "A: Well I was because I was a young girl in a marching uniform they let me right through you\nknow the sort of barricades.",
        "Q: Where did you get the Nazi uniform?",
        "A: A Nazi uniform. My brother, Otto had told me at that time was a white blouse and navy skirt,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nwhite half socks, black shoe. I had that. I mean that\u2019s, I guess why they made that their uniform\nbecause every girl would have that.",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t a special outfit?",
        "A: No, no it wasn\u2019t. I just there you go.",
        "Q: And you had platinum blond braids?",
        "A: My mother was terrified because she knew from the radio that everybody could go free and\nHitler would make us welcome. He made his first speech and that speech was on the\nSchwarzenberg Platz which was opposite the Yugoslav embassy.",
        "Q: Did you listen to the speech?",
        "A: No I didn\u2019t. After I, I had shouted Heil Hitler and then I stopped and I thought what had I\ndone.",
        "Q: Why did you do it?",
        "A: (both talking) Hitler. Everybody and in a sense with hindsight I think I would have been\nlynched if I hadn\u2019t shouted Heil Hitler. In the first row. So it was, but I didn\u2019t do it as a survival\nstrategy. I was literally hypnotized. There was millions of people screaming their heads off so\nyou know what do you do? You join them. But then when I got to and there\u2019s this Jewish queue\nin front of the Yugoslav embassy and they all looked at me. What do I do now? You know Otto\nhadn\u2019t sort of prepared for me for, all he had said was take our passports, get our mothers to give\nyou all our passports and go and ask for Mr. Miderman. That\u2019s all I knew. But he didn\u2019t tell me\nhow he knew him. And you know what should I say when I meet him. So at that point really I\nbecame another one. I told my second lie. You know when I saw this and I managed the guard.\nAnd the guard, my second lie was. I still remember. The guard said well what do you want. I\nsaid I want to see Mr. Miderman. And he said do you know Mr. Miderman. And I said yes of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\ncourse. You know but you know at a moment\u2019s notice. And then when I saw Mr. Miderman and\nhe even said how did you know about me. Why did you come here? So I took out my passport\nand said to him I\u2019ve come to collect visas. He said who told you about me. And it was at that\npoint that I thought, but before this I had seen that he was packing so I thought I didn\u2019t know\nwhat he was but he was packing. He didn\u2019t seem resident there. So I didn\u2019t know. Otto hadn\u2019t\ntold me but immediately I said Otto can\u2019t have known him. He is obviously somebody that is\ngoing somewhere now. And then he told me he was the ambassador for Yugoslavia and since\nAustria was no more an independent state he was moving back to Belgrade. That was all and he\ncouldn\u2019t give any visas then. But he said well who told you. And I think Otto. I don\u2019t know how\nbut ultimately you know how he knew. Did I say that in the \u2014 he signed the waivers. We\u2019d been\nto Yugoslavia. He signed them so he read Mr. Miderman signs the visas. So she must go and see\nMr. Miderman. And for him it was simple. But that I wouldn\u2019t know what to say didn\u2019t occur to\nhim. So I thought at the spur of the moment if I say my brother had sent me, he would say well\nwho is your brother. And how do I explain that? So I then produced Uncle Willie. And said my\nuncle rang me last night. I was lying right left and center. The sort of moral behavior\ndisappeared.",
        "Q: And he knew your uncle.",
        "A: But that I never found out. But once I had said he rang me and he had said I should meet Mr.\nMiderman at the embassy, he didn\u2019t ask me anymore. Whether he knew him or not but I think I\ndon\u2019t know. But I\u2019ve worked out that he might not have known him but might have thought he\nshould have known him. And he was I said to, he is one of the biggest textile manufacturers in\nYugoslavia. You must know him. What he, what went on his mind I don\u2019t know but it was that,\nthat he then put his arm around my shoulder and he said well I\u2019ll try and find it. And he walked\nme to the counsel and just knocked and (inaudible) pushed me in and said I am bringing you a\nyoung friend. She needs visas. Help her. Well it took three months, but I went there when you\nknow and then when I got the visas he said, the counsel said well how did you know Mr.\nMiderman. And I said he was just a friend.",
        "Q: Did you tell him that you were Jewish?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Ok so you got the visas for Yugoslavia, for the whole family.",
        "A: The thing is at that time before that Otto was in England. My father was in Yugoslavia and\nwe, there was supposed to be a plebiscite for the Austrians to vote yes or no, whether we want,\nAustria wanted to be in West Germany. Now I think now when I remember that crowd that I\nsaw that Hitler needed have no worry. He would have been voted in anyways. But he didn\u2019t wait\nfor that. But all the Jews, by that time, my father knew. I mean he had known that he was\nJewish. But he also knew what the Jews were suffering in Germany. So he then knew, you know\nhe must come, all the Jews who were outside Austria, but were Austrian citizens were all making\nback to Austria to cast their vote in the hope that they would influence the result.\nSo my father had rang us by that time. We had a telephone and said I am just going on the train\nbut just then about five minutes before, we had just heard Schuschnigg\u2019s last speech. And that\nwas horrifying because he was always, he made a lot of speeches, all Austria must vote and must\nvote for independence. That\u2019s what he knew. And he was making another speech and all of a\nsudden you heard as if things were knocked about and you didn\u2019t know. I mean you listen to the\nradio and you heard knocking. And then you heard him say, people are just coming in and they\nare taking me away. This is the end of Austria. God bless Austria and Horst Wesselneed [ph],\nyou know the German which goes today Germany, belongs to us. Tomorrow the whole world.\nSo we knew the Nazis had, but what had happened was that the Nazi, German troops Hitler had\nalready arranged for the German troops to cross the river, I mean Austria didn\u2019t have a\n(inaudible).\nSo this was the end. And my father then rang. And Otto answered the phone. My father said I am\njust going to the station to catch the train to be home. And Otto said well you know it was\ninteresting. Immediately you felt the Nazis would be listening to what you say. I mean they\nweren't that efficient to hacking, phone hacking, right. Murdoch now has been doing.\nBut this was sort of mentality. So then Otto said don\u2019t come back and my father said but I must\nbe with you. Listen to me. Don\u2019t come back. Finish. I can\u2019t tell you anymore. Listen to what\nyour radio is saying. And my father was never in Austria after that which was very difficult for\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nme because to him, I remained his little girl that can\u2019t make, little girls don\u2019t make decisions.\nYou know important what you should do, what you shouldn\u2019t. But before that after that, when\nOtto was in England, he wrote to me that he had a network of friends also Jewish. But they were\nall social democrats. It was that that bound them together, not their (inaudible). And one of\nthem, he actually died in England, last year. He was a close friend of Otto\u2019s. And he was married\nalready and he had, they were living in Italy. So he wrote to, Otto was trying to get Kurt out but\nhe couldn\u2019t get him. Otto then flirted with one old lady who worked in the British home office\nwho was in charge of giving visas. And he had a reason why he flirt, and he ultimately got a visa\nfor Kurt. But he didn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t get it quick enough and he too knew that Kurt was really very\nfrightened and it was hard there. So this friend said, because Austrians didn\u2019t need a visa for\nItaly but if you went by train you could cross the border. But not if you had a passport with a big\nred J. The Italians didn\u2019t want that.\nBut ordinary Austrians, not Jewish could just go in. So he then, this friend from him, who settled\nin Italy, wrote to Otto and told him send your brother. He knew Kurt. And he actually stayed\nwith them in Italy. They said send him by air, because the Italians had not yet realized that you\ncan fly and that you can arrive in the country, the border people, the border police was trained.\nYou see a passport with a red J, back, no you know but they flew. At the airports they hadn\u2019t\ntrained police, trained people who spoke there.",
        "Q: So Kurt flew from Vienna to Italy.",
        "A: I got Kurt. Kurt wouldn\u2019t go out. I, so Otto wrote to me. You went to the chet [ph] the Italian\ntravel there and then book a flight as early as you can for Kurt to fly to Italy. Once you\u2019ve got the\nticket tell me and he will get, arrange that he will be met on arrival. And that\u2019s what I did. And I\nwas very cross then when I came back. Kurt then flew to Italy and second week in May and the\nAnschluss was in March. And he was very cross with me that I hadn\u2019t got him a flight the day\nafter. So that\u2019s why there was never a very close relationship with him.",
        "Q: So Kurt is off to England. You stayed with your mother in Vienna and your father was in\nYugoslavia.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: With Uncle Willie.",
        "A: Yeah he was, they were still traveling.",
        "Q: But they were preparing to leave already at that time sort of, they converted",
        "A: No they weren\u2019t prepared.",
        "Q: Do you remember when they converted, when they changed their names from Lubel to\nLaditch cause it was in 38, after the Anschluss.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember that?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you consider converting? Was that ever a discussion in your family?",
        "A: No, no because there were in Austria in Vienna, sharks. When I came out of the Yugoslav\nembassy, there was one guy that asked me what I had been doing there. And I said I\u2019ve come to\ncollect visas. I had and he said have you go them yet. I said no. He said well if you convert, I\ncan get you a birth certificate of grandparents, because you had to have at least two, grand, non-\nJewish, Christian.",
        "Q: So there were people who were offering those services in front of the embassy?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: Yes, yes and I mean I, Otto didn\u2019t tell me about him so I didn\u2019t bother. But it wasn\u2019t only me\nthat he stopped because he knew all those Jews that were in the queue, they are unlikely to get\nthe visas.",
        "Q: So who would be these people, Jews, non-Jews?",
        "A: Well I thought that that guy looked to me as if he was Jewish but I never asked his name or\nanything but there were quite a lot of sharks there.",
        "Q: But you never considered conversion? Why not?",
        "A: Because first of all to we didn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t know whether it would work. You\u2019d have to put\nthe money down. Whether you went and then they said well fraud, I mean these were only\nfraudulent documents. Whether they would accept them because you would have to produce\nyour grandparents.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t consider converting in a church for example because churches also gave\ncertificates.",
        "A: No but not for your grandparents. No. You have to think of the total implication and yes and\nthey convert you. I mean there was the book Michel, Michel, did you ever see that. A little boy\nwhose parents were Jewish in France. Whose parents gave him in to a convent through the nuns,\nsay. And after the war, the parents perished but some relative were in Israel and they then went\nto find him. They had to fight because the nuns wanted to keep him. And this little boy\nobviously, I have here actually a very interesting thing. I go swimming to the Metropole which\nis a hotel here. Have a leisure center and they usually have fire alarms and usually they have\ntraining. So if you are in the pool, you go and just put the dressing on and you have to go\nupstairs to the reception. And then it goes all clear and that\u2019s all finished.\nBut once at last a door. We were all from the pool standing, we were in the, all dressing room.\nAnd there was a young woman and I was sort of shaking my head showing that I was impatient.\nIt wasn\u2019t, why do they keep us in here. But actually then the fire brigade came and there had\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nbeen an actual fire. And one person had lit an electric fire and that had caught something and so\nthere had been a fire in the room. But there was this young woman who somehow, I don\u2019t know\nwhy it is when I find a fellow Jew. I somehow feel that they are fellow Jews.\nI don\u2019t know what it is. Do you know? You feel some sort of affinity and there was this young\nwoman, looking very Jewish. Pale but quite hefty. So I said what do you think and so we began\nto talk and then they offered us all coffee and we sat having coffee. And she said where are you\nfrom. So I always say I am a Jewish refugee from Vienna cause you heard me say it.\nAnd she said you know my father is also from Vienna. Well her story, she is called Popper, P-O-\nP-P-E-R and she is a lovely young woman. So she also told her parents about my autobiography.\nHer paternal grandparents had a restaurant in the center of Vienna. It might have been one of the\nrestaurants that Uncle Willie had taken us. But certainly were well off. So they bought\nimmediately as the Anschluss occurred, a holiday ticket I think to Cyprus and off they went,\nbefore they introduced a red J on the passports. When you had money you could go. So they\nwent there and then they went from Cyprus they went to Kenya. And in Kenya his parents put\nhim into a monastery school and he converted to Catholicism. And he is, he looks like the\nstricher [ph] Jews. He has been, she brought them here. Her mother is a good England British, I\nthink an Anglican but not a Jew. He is a devout Catholic and he brought up, she has a brother so\ntwo children. And both of them were forced to go to church on Sunday and confess and all the\nparaphernalia. And she is now claiming everywhere, she is second generation Jewish. And we\nhad her you know Michele, the adopted daughter. And we always have a big Seder because there\nwere other couples from Sussex University. Jewish, who also had children of the age as ours\nwere. SO we every year it was at a different house.\nBut then was my husband conducted the Seder. My husband had died so Michele said mommy\ndon\u2019t because we were usually 30 or 40 people. So it was quite a lot for me. She said I\n(inaudible) it will be just our family and (inaudible) since then she has (inaudible). So this year\ntoo and so I said Michele can I bring this Popper. I asked her, would you. She said I\u2019d love to\nsee her so she came and she is now, she wants to convert. She feels very ill at ease (\u2019?).\nSo you know there are cases but he feels but here, I had him here when DT Rolner this poet from\nIsrael was staying with me. Just coincidentally her parents came to see her so she said can I bring\nthem along. I said yes, bring them along. And we\u2019ll see how your father feels about meeting an\nIsraeli poet whose mother had been to Auschwitz and who was (inaudible). And I have never\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nseen him so ill at ease. I said well 1s this all new to you. And I sort of pretended I didn\u2019t know\nanything about anti-Semitism. Well I feel very sorry for her. So some, I mean obviously there are\nsome who even became bishops.",
        "Q: Oh yeah of course. There was even a pope allegedly.",
        "A: Yeah. But do you know, that you don\u2019t know. You know Kate who was just married Prince\nWilliam. She\u2019s, her mother is Jewish.",
        "Q: I didn\u2019t know that.",
        "A: So actually",
        "Q: So we\u2019ll have a Jewish British king one of these days.",
        "A: No, Michelle\u2019s husband found it out I mean. Kate is his wife\u2019s name and she\u2019s now Princess\nKate, but her grandmother was a (inaudible) Jewess. And so her mother is obviously Jewish and\nso is She. So that\u2019ll be the first Jewish queen in England.",
        "Q: That\u2019s good news. Ok. Let\u2019s go back to Yugoslavia and how you fled cause we need to get to\nAlbania. That\u2019s the important part of the story. So you got the visas eventually for Yugoslavia\nand then you traveled.",
        "A: Well that was also very interesting you see. When we arrived there Uncle Willie, we had my\nmother had from her father had been given some gold pieces for each one of us. When we were\nborn her father presented. And that she kept and she didn\u2019t want to leave so, I mean I decided.\nAnd she wanted, she thought she would get her furniture back and all her household. So I had to\nfind packers and in Vienna we called that a lift. You know big case and things, put all the, and so\nI had to decide this doesn\u2019t go, but this can. And my mother wanted, on top of it, she wanted the\nawards that my father had got at the First World War. And I said look who will look at them.\nEven if they\u2019re saved, that won\u2019t change them. And so and actually I gave a lot to our neighbors\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nin the Karl Marx building. And then when we, before we made back from the Ring, I wanted a\nfilm that will show that people helped her. So the film director who I told you is a Bronx Jew\nand now is married to a Swedish woman, who made the film without getting any money out of it.\nHe thought that we needed money because we needed to pay expenses. It costs things to process\nthem. So we\u2019re meeting the (inaudible). We each put some money in, but not enough. So he then\nsaid well he wanted to sort of build the whole film and he thought we could get the money\nbecause I say and this is true the first society that has made me feel I belong. The first group of\npeople. Because sociologically you know that none no individual can live as an individual, we all\nhave to belong to a group of people. Feeling we belong.\nAnd in Vienna I thought I was a girl, Austrian girl. They didn\u2019t think of me like that. I was\nthrown out of school. And then I came to Yugoslavia. And of course I wasn\u2019t a Yugoslav citizen\nbut my father and my mother then wanted to bring those gold pieces. I had a boyfriend as I\n(inaudible) and it was really when the, you know when our teacher at the last minute gave us our\ncertificate at the school which was a catchment school for all the Jewish kids. And the teachers\nweren't trained teachers. They were real Nazis. They were SS. They turned up in SS uniforms.\nAnd his speech was when he distributed our last certificates. I think that\u2019s in my autobiography\nwas I am sure that very few of you will manage to get out. But those few who will get out will\ndie in the gutter. That he told to 14, 15 year old kids.\nSo and I had this, I had you know we were, my mother never had enough money to give me a\nbirthday party. But my school pals were all kids from Jewish parents. So I always got my mother\nto let me have some presents because I was invited but I could never (inaudible) around. So but\nin this school they made it a catchment school. The words and it was a high class, high Jewish\nclass, the rich Jews had their children in this school. That school they made into a catchment\nschool. So well some of them were kids that had been there and my boyfriend who wooed me,\nhe sort of was the first one that I saw that way. And we were, and we were not allowed to be out.\nJews were not allowed after work. So I would stay the night in his house. A nice (inaudible) for\nme this was. And he would sort of put his arm around me and he said well even in the gutter I\nwill love you.\nSo I then met him in London. By that time his father had a little money, put me. That\u2019s another\nthing. I don\u2019t know whether you read this. Why there was, I?ll come to Albania. In Albania, I\nwas the only young girl. And there was a group and they joined you know about them. They\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nwere wonderful. Wherever Jewish refugees turned up they would provide subsistence money.\nAs long as there was a resident Jewish family.",
        "Q: So they were present in Albania? The Joint?",
        "A: No, well I was in Yugoslavia for the time. And we went, we took my mother took this gold\npieces and I then came up with the idea, how do you get, she said well if the Nazis, if they see us\nwith our passport with the red J, the border control, they will search our luggage and if they find\nour gold, they will take them. And that\u2019s my most precious gold. So I came up with the idea we\nwill have rolls, have rolls and in the rolls Pll put the gold pieces and we got them nine bolts of\n(satin?) at one end. But at the station in Maribor, my father and uncle where they waited for. And\nfortunately the border we were at one end of the train and the border control started at the other\nend. So Uncle Willie said come on out and we got out and we never went to the border control\ndidn\u2019t see anything.\nBut then the first night, I mean now that I\u2019m old I can understand. For my parents it was their\nfirst stay together after horrible months for my father who was always worried, how do we\nsurvive and he knew my mother (inaudible) and I, this boyfriend had come to the station in\nVienna to see me off with a big bunch of roses to show me. And these roses I took with me. By\nthe time we got to Maribor they had wilted but I put them in a, I asked Uncle Willie. Auntie, his\nwife wasn\u2019t there. I can\u2019t remember where she was. She may have been in England. Because\nPaul and his brother were in school in England. And so I said can I have vase please. And of\ncourse they have an army of (servants?) and so I got the vase and I put these old sort of looking\nroses into it. And I put the photograph of my boyfriend there. And I cried my heart out because\nmy parents, you know for them this was the first night they spent together after you know. And\nhe couldn\u2019t understand that I had grown up. That I had now come to be the decision maker. I, in\na sense was the head of the family. Otto was in England. He was in Yugoslavia. Kurt was in\nEngland, in Italy. And I was with mama. And so who didn\u2019t dare to go and he treated me like his\nyou know little girl. And I said",
        "Q: So what did you do in Maribor? You stayed in your uncle\u2019s house. Do you remember the\nhouse? Was it a big house?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: Yes, I remember that. It was a lovely, 1t was big house and it had many rooms. I had a room\nto myself.",
        "Q: Was that in the center or was that the house next to the factory?",
        "A: No it wasn\u2019t next to it. You had to drive to the factory.",
        "Q: So it was in the center and it was a house?",
        "A: In a nice area.",
        "Q: A family house?",
        "A: Where other people who were equally wealthy. So \u2014",
        "Q: Did your uncle help you in any way to travel to Albania or to with, your visas?",
        "A: There were difficulties. I don\u2019t know whether Paul knew about it or whether he told you.\nWhen my father was a traveling, I told you was an illegal salesman. So before he bribed them\nbut then once the police knew that he couldn\u2019t go back because he\u2019d always gone back to\nAustria. And now they knew, he couldn\u2019t go back so they wanted big bribes and he refused to\npay. So they put him into jail.",
        "Q: Your father?",
        "A: My father. In Novizant [ph]. You know Novizant? Where there were Jewish customers of\nhim. Now this he told the Jewish customers that we were with my mother\u2019s sister. So they\ncontacted us and told us that he was in jail and we should arrange. So of course my mother\ncontacted Uncle Willie and said my husband is in, you must do something. So he did and he got\na, he then wanted, and they said well get him to Zagreb. So that we can be together at least. But\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nhe would have come as a prisoner. But Uncle Willie paid for a private detective to bring him to\ntravel. So he wasn\u2019t traveling but again you know you must think that all these men who were\nafter me but it really was very strange. I was 16 years and there was a, there were in Zagreb also\nsharks. But there was one guy who had been with the police and he came along when he heard\nthat my father was coming with a private. He contacted us and said you don\u2019t have to leave, I can\nhelp you to get permits to stay. What did he want to do? He told my mother that I must go with\nhim to a small place by the seaside and stay with him a few days. He will arrange our permits.\nAnd my mother said no. No, no. But he then, so then he came and he, I mean he said to me, will\nyou kiss me. And I said you don\u2019t look like that I would kiss you. And he then said well if you\nkiss me, I go with you to the train station when your father arrives. Well I did kiss him because\nthat was very important for me.\nMy father got out with this private detective and my father, you know I was his little girl and\nthere he was. He said that\u2019s what your father has come to. He went on his knees in front of me.\nYour father came as a prisoner. And I said don\u2019t be so silly. \u2019 ve seen worse things happening.\nYou were lucky. You haven\u2019t seen all those things that I have seen. But he was crying then.",
        "Q: He was humiliated.",
        "A: He was feeling and we had to, and so he came. He then, this shark took us in his police car to\nmy aunt and that\u2019s where we stayed. But then the thing was that it was obvious that my father,\nwe would all have to go because the police came to check on us, our tourist visas were finished\nso they said if you can find another place, another country that will have you we don\u2019t mind. We\nare not against you but if you can\u2019t find anyone, we will ship you to the border. And we knew.\nSo my father and my mother were really so (inaudible). I mean they said to me what do you\nwant to get out of life. There\u2019s nothing. We have not (inaudible) so why should we move. And\nyou know now I think I should write something about my parental generation because they were\nthe ones that were hit most. They had lost everything. They had no future, they had nothing to\nlook forward to. So you know and there were suicides and one can understand it. But I didn\u2019t. I\nwasn\u2019t when I was 15 or 16 years, you are not ready.",
        "Q: So how did you travel through Yugoslavia? By trains or \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: To Yugoslavia. We came from Vienna by train to Maribor.",
        "Q: But then from Yugoslavia, when you went to Albania you had to cross Yugoslavia.",
        "A: Again Uncle Willie paid for a private detective to travel with us. Otherwise we would have\nhad to \u2014 who got the police, agreed they would, he would take our passports. We weren\u2019t\nallowed to have them.",
        "Q: So he accompanied you \u2014",
        "A: We went by train from Zagreb to Spoleto, to Split and there, from there we went by ship. To\nDurr\u00e9s, the port in Albania. And the private detective handed over our passports to the captain.\nSo he fulfilled his commitment. But again we were, I mean the whole, friends of my aunt and\nuncle, everybody came to see us off. And there were so many boxes of chocolates and you know\neverybody felt very sorry for us. We were going, we were so (inaudible). And my mother said to\nUncle Willie, tell us we can\u2019t take it. So I then said, look. And money we could take only the\nequivalent of 50 pounds. And this is what my father said to me. He said, he told me he said you\nknow you are a young girl. You are really lovely but we arrive in a country that we don\u2019t know.\nWe don\u2019t know a soul there with 50 pounds. How long do you think we can survive? Can you\nthink at all? So Ivan and you mustn\u2019t take any more. So I then remembered how I had taken the\ngold pieces out. So I did the same with the chocolates. I hid, took them you know big box of\nchocolate, a bag of chocolates and put at the bottom money. Also we had 100 pounds. We took\nthe next of it.\nBut then I was standing. My parents, they sat in one of the apartment, compartments of the train\nand I stood on the, in the passage with the detective who was traveling with us. And so we\nstarted chatting. And I then said opened the door and said to my mother, I would like to offer\nour friend here chocolate. She thought I must be crazy you know. He\u2019d discover something but\nI didn\u2019t \u2014 but the thing was, this was you know and this was another one who I feel saved my\nlife. But my life inasmuch as my confidence that there are people who want to help because he\nasked me why. He didn\u2019t know why we, why he had to come with us. Why are we being thrown\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nout. So I told him and I told him about a few things that I'd seen in Vienna. And so he then said\nlook, he said Pll marry you. He said now don\u2019t worry. You will not be in any problem and we\nwill not have any problem and I will ask your parents and I said no, don\u2019t ask them. But he said\nif I marry you, it will be you and your parents will have automatically permits to stay.\nSo there was a guy who worked for the police who was prepared to help us. And really he may\nhave been in difficulties, likely to have been difficulties if he married, go in the next day and if\nwe got married. So there was another one like Mr. Miderman who didn\u2019t really know what, why\nand what he was doing. So as you have heard me say to my granddaughter when she asked me\nwhat does swimming upstream mean. And I said it means that I had to fight all the way in my\nlife.\nBut every time somebody cropped up and helped and that\u2019s quite true. So and then we arrived\nby ship. Now that was another thing. On that ship was a German couple. Because they had\nbought the journey on that ship on the premise that they would just take them to Greece because\nthat ship was going to Albania and further on and so on.\nAnd they couldn\u2019t get ashore to get to resort, to Greece. And they had a little baby and that little\nbaby was, they couldn\u2019t pay so the captain didn\u2019t know what to do. He didn\u2019t have, and he kept\nthem. They actually helped in the kitchen. And they cleaned the ship. Whatever became of them\nI don\u2019t know. But they were going up and back (inaudible). so this was (fortune?) .\nBut then when we landed in Albania, the port, my father said well where do we go now. You are\nthe decision maker, tell me. Where do you want us to go. And I didn\u2019t know, but then as I\nwalked down the plank, I saw two men who were obviously Austrian refugees. From the\nclothing were there. And they recognized us and they welcomed us. And said one thing you may\nbe sure. You\u2019ve come to a very friendly country. And they were. And I was then you know I\nwas the only girl because all the other, there was one German couple. Her husband was a senior\nengineer, had been a senior engineer in a German factory. So she insisted when anybody wanted\nto talk to her, you had to say Frau Ober Engineer. We were all, had no money, nothing. All\nstated but we had to leave Frau Ober Engineer. And this and that\u2019s where I stole money and stole\nbread. And I was hungry. Because you know we had, it was a very orthodox church rule there.\nAnd I now saw the first Jewish wedding. There was a couple in their 30s from Germany who\nwere married under German rule, but not under the Jewish religion. And they wanted to go to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nwhat still is Palestine. And they had to have a Jewish wedding certificate. So we had a proper\nJewish wedding. I mean it was fantastic to see the bride with the handkerchief .",
        "Q: Did you make pictures?",
        "A: No we didn\u2019t have a camera. No, well I didn\u2019t have a camera. This is now, didn\u2019t have a\ncamera then.",
        "Q: Stop for a minute.",
        "A: Well the photographers of the wedding and in Budapest of King Zog. King Zog married a\nHungarian aristocratic young woman. Her mother was Hungarian aristocracy. And her father I\nthink was an American. And I don\u2019t know how she got, when she got them. They told them. So\nthey told us we are welcome here and so we were. And now you see the grandson regards me as\nhis grandmother and he said you haven\u2019t seen a photo. He\u2019s a very nice young man. Imperial\nthat he sends me. Because I told him I felt I owe my life to Albania. Because when I went round\nas I told you to all the consulates asking for visas, none was prepared. But Albania, the counsel\nsaid, I mean when they received me and all the uncles were. They put the door in my face when\nI showed the guard \u2014",
        "Q: Which consulates did you go to? Who closed the door in your face? You went to the\nAmerican consulate.",
        "A: The British, the Norwegian, the Swedish, the Danish. All the countries where one would\nhave thought they would have some empathy.",
        "Q: Did you try, I don\u2019t know, Australia, Canada.",
        "A: Yeah, no. So because by that time they were all we had to let (inaudible) the passport.",
        "Q: And that was in Yugoslavia already?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: You were trying to get the visas for the next --",
        "A: Yugoslavs were slowing as well. And they said unless we can leave to another country and\nthey will have us, they will send us back.",
        "Q: So when did you arrive to Albania?",
        "A: In, just after the Kristallnacht. On the 20\u201c of November. On my Otto\u2019s birthday.",
        "Q: 38? 39? 38?",
        "A: Yeah. So in 30 but the British then Otto then worked to try and, he got a visa for Kurt. Kurt\nwas also in England. But then to get us not in time to get the British visa so that we could get\nhere before England really opened up. Because England, only Churchill who realized because\nwhat was his name, Chamberlain who went to Germany and came back waving the peace treaty.",
        "Q: Peace of our life time in 38.",
        "A: Yeah so. Then they were prepared to have unskilled female labor.",
        "Q: In the United Kingdom.",
        "A: In England.",
        "Q: And that was end of the year 38.",
        "A: No that was beginning February 1939.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "Q: How long did you stay in Albania?",
        "A: Until there were, until birthday. No we were three days before \u2014",
        "Q: So from September 38 to sort of April 39. What did you do all those months in Albania?",
        "A: Well [ll tell you what I did. When I got there even the Greek Orthodox and even the\nChristian women would all go around veiled and would not go in the street, except prostitutes.\nOther women would not go in the street without a chaperone, a male chaperone. So there was I\ncoming with socks, short dresses. I mean my school uniform and what I used to wear in school.\nAnd there was a girl. And you see the richer Albanians sent their children into boarding school\nfor education to Italy. So then they came back so there was a group of young Albanians who\nreally didn\u2019t have to work. They didn\u2019t have to do anything to get money.\nAnd they really didn\u2019t know. They were bored stiff and when they saw me they came and they\nsurrounded me and I didn\u2019t know Albanian. They talked Albanian and I didn\u2019t know Italian or\nany and, andI felt scared and they touched my shoulder and then I said in French, I could do\ncolloquial in French. And they spoke French and I said what are you doing? What do you think?\nAnd they said well are you a real girl. I said I\u2019m a girl. I know that you know why am I? So then\nthey said well women don\u2019t go like you so I then said well I come from a different culture. And\nthere was a famous actor, an Albanian called Moishe. They knew him, who was very famous. I\nknew of him. He played in drama performances in Vienna. And he was very good and had a big\nreputation.\nSo they asked me did I know him and I said yes, I know of him. So I then, they wanted to know\nfor them it was sort of Austrian in general, and Vienna in particular were sort of the center of\nsophistication and education. It was, they built up Vienna in like a dream setting. Not the way I\nremembered it.",
        "Q: Did anyone speak German?",
        "A: No, no.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "Q: So how did you communicate, in French?",
        "A: French. So then one of them who was called Dowana he said well his father had died just\nbefore I arrived in Durr\u00e9s. And he had two younger sisters that were in boarding school. But the\nmother now, since the father has just died, doesn\u2019t want to send them back. Would I be prepared\nto teach them German, French and mathematics so that they would have some edu. So I said yes.\nI said well how old are they? Well I was then 16. Going on for 17 and they were 14 and 15. So\nthat I wasn\u2019t much older than them. But I wasn\u2019t going to miss out on that. So he then took me to\nhis home which was right opposite the sea, opposite the harbor. It was lovely and they had like\nthe Muslims, the women live in purdah. You know there\u2019s women, there\u2019s a female section of\nthe quarter, living quarters and the male one. And so obviously the girls were in the female one.\nAnd I fitted into this. So I remember I was really very cheeky. I did, I mean I knew French. I\nhad done colloquial French, but I wasn\u2019t perfect, by any means. And there are many things that I\ndidn\u2019t know the French for.\nWell I was teaching it. Well how do you teach a language to others when you have no language\nin common. If you and I know English and I want to teach you Albanian, well I can tell you the\nEnglish words and learn like I said. But if, if we don\u2019t have a common language it is very\ndifficult. So what I then did was to point this little chair and I would say the English, the French\nand the German word, if I knew the French. The German I would know. And they would write it\ndown. And the next day I would say what is this? And I\u2019d expect them to know. Well sometimes\nthey asked me for the French word and I had no idea. So you know what I did. I invented French\nwords. But I said the words so quickly that they couldn\u2019t write them down. So the next day then I\nwent back and I had a dictionary all right. I knew the word. Next day I would say well what is\nthis, French, German. You know it in German, yes, you know it in French. Now we have. Well\nwrite it down now properly.\nNow I have been trying to find the heirs of this Dowana family. Because they were wonderful\nto me. The women of the house, their mothers and aunts and all the relatives that were there, they\nwere all very nice to me. First of all they always served me with coffee, Turkish coffee and\nbiscuits which was great really for me. And secondly, from their house, their house was a lovely\nbig house right opposite the port. I sat there with looking out well obviously this is a chair. And\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nI would look out at the port. And I always loved the sea, and I told you. I told my mother I was\nborn at the sea.\nSo and they were all so nice to me and I had a nice environment and I had regularly something to\ndo and they paid me there. But I was the only refugee that they all saw",
        "Q: Where did you live? Was there a place for all the refugees to live or did you stay with\nfamilies?",
        "A: Well that\u2019s where the Joint came in. These two men that met us, told, first of all they said,\nthey took us to a hotel which was the dirtiest and filthiest place. I mean this was for my parents\nyou know we had to say go and have a bottle of eau de cordel [ph] which we had to the loo. I\nmean it was, and the linens were dirty. And it was really awful. But these two men had said you\nmust just stay there for a week because we will look at your credentials. But if you pass, which\nwe think you will, you can then move, because what they had done, the Joint, there were some\nJewish shops around. And there were also Jewish salesmen from Salonika, selling to these\nJewish shop keepers. And the Joint was sending money. However many refugees turned up and\nlived because they had rented a house next to the police station. And they got, and the shop\nkeeper that got the money from the Joint always had to get a piece of paper from the board of\nguardians. These were elderly Polish or Austrian Jews and to send it to the Joint that they would\nalways continue sending.\nIt was very, very little. I mean really as a growing girl I was starving. And I, and there was a\nlarder which was always locked and once they had forgotten to lock it. And I saw it open and I\nsneaked in and I got a big piece of bread and I was delighted. But next day I was hauled before\nthe board of guardians. That you don\u2019t do and my father burst into tears. You know his little girl.\nHe couldn\u2019t supply enough food that. I mean it was natural, but I didn\u2019t feel terribly guilty. I was\nangry. There was bread. Why shouldn\u2019t I?",
        "Q: So the Joint was paying for this house where the refugees were living. How many people\nwere there in the house?",
        "A: Well when we got there, there were about 35.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "Q: 35. Did you manage to either keep in touch with any of those people or to find them after the\nwar?",
        "A: Well now you see after we left, then Otto got visas.",
        "Q: So you left for England?",
        "A: We left but wait a moment. He got me one as a hairdresser apprentice and my mother as a\ndomestic. Well we weren\u2019t terribly delighted but better going to England was good. So but not\nfor my father. So we tried to delay leaving him because he was really suicidal. He would go\nalong the shore and was ready to jump in. And you know it was very difficult. So we felt that\nmy mother didn\u2019t want to leave her husband and I didn\u2019t want to leave my father. But Otto kept\nextending our visas, but then he sent me a letter and he said listen, unless you arrive before the\nend of April, 1939, in England I cannot extend them. You will never be able to come here. So\nyou better come with mother and he said I promise you and mother, you talk with mother and tell\nher he will do anything just to get a visa. And he did. My father came a week before the war\nstarted.",
        "Q: Wasn\u2019t there also a story where you were giving language classes to the Italian counsel or\nambassador that become very important later on?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. The Italian counsel heard that I was teaching German because these were elite\nfamilies and I guess there were evening dinners and they must obviously have been together with\nthe local elite.",
        "Q: So there would be what associated with the royal family or the aristocracy.",
        "A: Yeah so and he was a very nice guy and he said, they told him you know that I was teaching\ntheir daughters. So he said tell her I want to see her and so they told me and I went. Ad he then\ntold me that he wanted me to, he wanted to learn German because Mussolini and Hitler were in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nItaly and it was when they were together, Germany. I mean Mussolini was Hitler\u2019s role model.\nHe really, he wasn\u2019t anti-Semitic at first, for a long time but in terms of his \u2014 you know that\nMussolini invented the term fascisma [ph]. So you know he was the role model. So this counsel\nthought it would help him in his career to know German. And so I started teaching him. And I\nthink you must remember this out of my autobiography. Then we were still there when Mussolini\noccupied Albania. And this counsel became the first governor of the coastal region.\nSo the war, the Jewish \u2014 we thought that Mussolini would hand us refugees like a present over to\nHitler. Because it seemed obvious. We were the only thing that Mussolini got out of Albania.\nThat Hitler may want. So we were all terribly -- I mean they were just everybody. We were\nsitting in a cellar when the fighting was going on. And what was really moving was the next door\npolicemen were worried because they told us. I mean you could see the big warships on the\nhorizon. It was a port and Italy had big ships. The only ship that Albania had was the private\nyacht of King Zog. I mean that couldn\u2019t defend. And the policemen told us all they have to\ndefend Durr\u00e9s against the Italian onslaught is three machine guns. And there, the roof of their\npolice station was flat. And one of these three machine guns was standing there. They told us\nthat. And they said well when the Italians will come ashore we will have to shoot. That\u2019s our\njob. And the Italians will want to knock out these three machine guns. And if they fail, if they\nmiss, then they will kill you. And we don\u2019t want that. And we thought, we sat together. And we\nthought we would, Hitler would throw us out and treated us like nothing. And here were these\nlittle policemen worried about our life. It was really very moving. And I tell them that now too\nso they then said well tonight they told us, the onslaught was coming. They would come ashore.\nSo first of all you have to find a house with a cellar because not many houses had cellars. Only\nthe richest. And the richest had gone inland, the Albanian. But they left their servants to take care\nof their \u2014 but we you know we went in and we checked that they have a cellar. The servants\nwanted to stop us or they weren\u2019t too strong, strong enough to do that. So we found a house not\ntoo far from where our house was.\nBut before this I must tell you, there were Salonika salesmen, Jewish salesmen selling goods.\nAnd well one of them was called Major. Very nice. He was 45 years old. For me he was like he\nhad two feet in the grave because you know when you\u2019re 16, 17, 45 seems \u2014 but he fell in love\nwith me. You must think everybody fell into, that was my life. And so he asked my father for\ngive information so that he could marry me. At first he had asked me and I said I don\u2019t want to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nmarry anybody. And then he asked my father and my father said no, she was far too young. But\nhe, then he also came to see -- but he had money. So he was always getting me presents and I\ndidn\u2019t want them because I thought that make me dependent. And anyway when it comes then a\nlittle story and a little lie. So we stayed in the cellar during the onslaught and we heard the\nshooting. And they then said we, our guardians had a meeting. And said let\u2019s surrender. Let\u2019s\nnot be sort of taken, but let\u2019s surrender. Let\u2019s say we know we are going to go to the next\nconcentration camp, but let\u2019s do it with our heads up. Let\u2019s show them that we have courage.\nSo ok. So they said well then the shooting stopped and so they said well now we will go and\nsomebody who has, who can speak Italian must lead us. Well who could do that? I was the only\none. In teaching German and French I picked up, I\u2019m not fluent but I picked up. So they gave me\na stick and a white handkerchief for army and I should lead. So I led and I was trying to say in\nItalian, as best as I could. We are a group of German and Austrian Jewish refugees and I kept\nrepeating this in my mind as we were walking along. And we must have been a really crazy lot,\nlooking, you know these old men and women were shuffling along and wearing different kind of\nclothing.\nAnyway, and then came three Italians, one an officer with two guys from around the corner and\nsaw us. And shouted halt. So I said stop. So we stopped. And then as I had expected, he came\nup to me and said who are you? And so and he did. So I then said in my, in the sentences I had\nrehearsed. I said we are a group of German and Austrian -- and he didn\u2019t let me go any further. I\ndidn\u2019t get, have to say Jewish refugees. He put his arm around my shoulder and said Tedesk1,\nGerman. Italian, friends, amigo,. amigo. I didn\u2019t disillusion him. And so in a sense that was\nanother saving. So then he put his two soldiers in charge of walking. He said where do you live?\nAnd I said over there. I didn\u2019t say that was the police station. And so he walked us back. But on\nthe way back I thought well if they look through our rooms and if the police had wanted to hide\ntheir guns, then they might have put some into our rooms and if these Italian soldiers find them\nthen the friendship will be off.\nBut they didn\u2019t. They let us go. They looked through them but the soldiers said the police\nhadn\u2019t hidden anything. But then I heard somebody knock at the back, where we had the window\nlooking out at the wasteland and there was a guy standing in Albanian uniform because they had\na very small unit of soldiers. And he made me understand that he wants clothing. He wants to get\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nrid of his uniform. So I gave him one pajama of my father. And he stuck, changed there and this\nwas my contribution to the freedom fight of Albania.\nBut then the next day the, who was then the governor, the Italian ex Italian counsel, his car came\nto our residence and a uniformed driver, chauffeur had a letter And he had, the guardians went\nto the door. And it was addressed to me. So they were all excited. Says now we mean, we are\nbeing sent to the concentration camp. And I opened it and it said now I need you even more and\nhe sent me a letter with so many stamps and he sent every day his car, was picking me up and\nthere are so many guard posts on the way because they had just occupied Albania. I actually\nwent last July when I made this film because King Zog\u2019s car was at the top of the hill and of\ncourse King Zog had fled. So this new governor of the city had moved into King Zog\u2019s castle.\nSo we went, I got in touch with the grandson and I said well they want to film it. So they\nallowed us in because there weren\u2019t many people. So this is and then I have to -- and then my\nGreek boyfriend said, and he knew we had the -- among the young lot who were my sort of I was\nthe pied piper and they followed me was a travel agent. Because I had gone, since we had the\nvisas for England, I went to the French ambassador and said can I fly because Air France was the\nonly airline that would fly from Albania to Paris, fuel, stop there for refuel and then go on to\nLondon. So that\u2019s the plane that I thought we were taking. But they told me I should go to the\nFrench ambassador to make sure and do you know they were bastards. We would have, my\nmother and I would have just stayed the 20 minutes that it would have taken them to refuel. But\nthey did not. And they said we do not want refugees in our country. At a later date they may have\nhad different stories.\nSo then among this lot of young men, was one travel agent. So I asked him. I said well how can\nI get from here because I can\u2019t go by train. I have to go you know flying there. I can\u2019t fly. So\nhow do I get there. So he then said there is one cargo ship that goes from Naples to\nSouthampton and if you board that, there was one coming that would get you to Southampton on\nthe 25\" of April. So that was all right. So and we paid him and the Joint sent money for our\nfriend. I had one. But this Salonika guy said my dear I want to give you 500 pound. I want to do\nit. And I thought no, I\u2019m not being bought for 500 pounds and said no I don\u2019t. He then said well\nlook don\u2019t be so silly. I'll give you the 500 and you take it. If you do not need them. If you don\u2019t\nhave to use them I\u2019ll give you my, the details of my bank account in London and you pay the 500\npounds into that bank. And that is what I did.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nBut I am sure because all the Salonika Jews went into Auschwitz and it was this, he was the\ngeneral secretary of the you know, the Austrian . He was then the officer for the German army.\nAnd they occupied Salonika and ordered them all out. So I\u2019m sure that this, not only he had an\naccount that I know because, but I can kill myself for not writing it down. Because I am sure\nthere is a lot of Salonika money invested in the British and American banks. But no, I mean the\nheirs. This guy was not married. I don\u2019t know how many were married, how many had children.\nBut the second generation wouldn\u2019t know the details . So why don\u2019t the American Jewish -- \u2019m\ntrying here the Jewish community, why don\u2019t they sort of write to the \u2014 they said I should do it.\nWell I can\u2019t do it. But a Jewish community representative can say you know the Swiss banks.\nThe American and Britain have really been very tough and gotten a lot of money out of it. But\nthey themselves have never said we also have some money. And they must have it.\nBecause you know the rich Jews in Europe and particularly a country like Greece, Salonika will\nhave invested, will have bank accounts here. So the Swiss had to pay up. Why don\u2019t they, why\ndon\u2019t the British. Or the American money. But no, nobody wants to take that on.",
        "Q: So then you did eventually come to England, the both of you, your mother and yourself. But\ntell us about the journey to England.",
        "A: Well that\u2019s what you want. So my brother said I must be arriving with my mother before the\nend of April so this travel agent in Durr\u00e9s gave me a voucher. I paid with part of the Joint money\nfor the journey and I had a voucher for two cabin, for two people to have a cabin on this cargo\nship that was supposed to arrive in Naples about 25, about in the first week of April. So off we\nwent. And my mother, Otto had said you must come because if you do not arrive in England,\nbefore the end of April you won\u2019t be able, whatever it is. So I wrote (inaudible) for him to do.\nSo I took my mother. We were crying a lot and she, you know it\u2019s very sad really if you leave by\nship because the land gets smaller and smaller as you depart. You know air flight is quick.",
        "Q: Did you like traveling by boat?",
        "A: Yes I do, but not if you leave somebody behind who you would like to have with you. And\nmy father was getting smaller and smaller.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "Q: But there were other refugees who stayed behind. You weren\u2019t the only two who left then?",
        "A: Yeah, it was on that day. But most of them were hidden during the war. For most of them\nyou can see it. You want to see the rescue in Albania. Most of them were hidden. And there is\nactually one who married an American. She is called Joanna Newman with whom I am in touch.\nShe said, I can\u2019t remember. She said that she arrived with her parents also from Yugoslavia.\nThey were from Germany, but then they made it to Yugoslavia and from Yugoslavia they were\nthrown out and they came to Durr\u00e9s. But I had, I must admit I have no recollection. But that\ndoesn\u2019t mean that, she was obviously there. And in that film you can see her in fact. She seems a\nvery nice lady.\nAnd now I\u2019m on the Albania Mafia and so because there is a lady in New York who 1s called,\nshe is a dentist, a doctor, Anna Cohen and she now also wants me to come and tell my story to\nher American Jewish lot and we are on very friendly terms but I have never met her. So I now\nknow quite a lot of them. And they all, she you can see her on that film. She was born in Albania\nduring the war and her mother was saved because they also -- what she has been doing for\nAlbania is when there are youngsters who have been diagnosed with a disease for which they\ndon\u2019t have any treatment in Albania. There are quite a lot of such individuals. That she will\narrange, she will get the medical report. And if she knows, she will then establish whether if they\nare in New York they can get the treatment that will make them well again. She gets money,\nshe\u2019s got money in her fund. She pays for them. They fly to New York. She arranges their\ntreatment. Once they are well again, back they go. So also during the war. She also feels in a\nsense she was born there. And if the Albanians hadn\u2019t saved her mother, she wouldn\u2019t be there\neither.",
        "Q: So then you arrived to Naples. By boat.",
        "A: So in Naples we stayed for the first, and while we were in Albania the men made the furniture\nout of orange boxes. My father made beds. We slept on hearths or in boxes or cupboards and but\nthe Joint money helped us to stay in a hotel. Not a posh one but so I left my mother in the hotel.\nFor her this was, she was still broken hearted, having had to leave my father. But she felt for the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nfirst time she was sleeping in a bed. We were both there. And I said you stay here. I\u2019Il go and get\nour tickets for the cargo ship. So I had the voucher and I went to this address. I found it and I\nproduced my voucher. And they said oh it\u2019s a pity. What date do you have to be in England? I\nsaid end of April. They said well this ship is two months delayed.\nYou know I tell this story always to the kids and when I will say that. It\u2019s oh. When you feel you\n\u2014there\u2019s nothing. And I didn\u2019t know a soul. I mean how was I to know? And I knew my mother,\nif I tell her she wouldn\u2019t say really that\u2019s it. So I went outside and had a good cry for myself.\nAnd then I said well then I said I must let me Otto know what the problem is. Because I realized\nI mean if we can\u2019t get to England then he can\u2019t do anything but at least he would know what\nhappened.\nBut then I looked up and you know this Italian travel agency, cit, C-I-T is still was then still\nworking. And it still, you can still see Cit Italian. So I looked up and there was Cit, so I said well\nmaybe this is a sign. So I went in with our passports. And I said I need a flight to London from\nhere. Can it? And he said no problem. He said have you got the money to pay. I mean I was a\nyoung one and I got out, I had money. Dollars so, it was safe. So he said no problem at all and\nso he rang Air France. And he said well the passports I wouldn\u2019t be (inaudible). No. We won\u2019t\ntell them. Well he rang other airlines, but of course the planes needed and couldn\u2019t fly such long\ndistances. Everyone had to refuel on the way. So we had a tough time. But the only airline that\nwould take us was KLM. But KLM was, we were boarding and we had to go by train from\nNaples to Milan.\nAnd in Milan at the airport we could get onto the KLM flight. And the KLM flight went,\nCologne, Frankfurt, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, London.\nSo I knew so that is when I wrote a letter. I mean in a sense like Horst Teers mother when she\nwas on the train to Auschwitz, writing her last letter. I wrote a letter to Otto and I said we were\non a flight, KLM. We are supposed to arrive in London but if we can\u2019t get through Germany,\nthen you know where we to look. But that\u2019s all I could say and I gave him the time we were due.\nBut then I said well how do I get it to him. So I went to talk to the KLM steward and that he is\nanother one who had saved my life. Because really when you come and see you know taken\nevery step, it was really true. Somebody turned up that helped. Because I said you know I said\nyou know we are Jewish refugees. You can see our passport and I said do we have to get out\nwhen we dock at German ports. They said yes, the Germans don\u2019t allow anybody to remain on\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nthe plane. So first stop was Cologne and I said to mother and as we landed we saw all those\nswastika flags and all those SS young men and SA brown u \u2014 I mean it was really, you know it\nbrought back all we had seen in Vienna. We thought we got out. And my mother was terrified so\nI said listen. We\u2019ll walk straight and we will show we are not scared. So we all had to go through\nimmigration so when I showed our passport, he said (German) you know what are the\nrequirement, (inaudible) have to do. So I said no, we\u2019re not returning to your country. I said\nyou can see we have an English visa and that\u2019s what our tickets say and that\u2019s where we are\ngoing. So he said ok and thankful. And we sat down but then when we got to Cologne, we all\nhad to get out of there. And the airport was full of people from passengers from all over the\nworld. And they announced over the loudspeaker Frau Und [ph] report. So I then thought well\ncouldn\u2019t we disappear in this , how would they find, but then I realized with our passports\nbecause everybody had to fill out so then that\u2019s when the worst (inaudible) in my life. Because\ntwo Nazi bitches, really you can\u2019t use any other term. They were in the female SA, SS uniforms,\nblack skirts black, jackets, swastika and they took us into a small room and then said now strip.\nStrip? I felt you know I couldn\u2019t say, but what they were after was what we were smuggling.\nThey went through every seam in our you know skirts and I mean I can\u2019t describe and then they\nwere beating us and my mother collapsed and I had to pick her up and they would then say stop\nhelping this cow of a Jew. And I mean it just, I don\u2019t want to remember that.\nBut then fortunately I had this letter. I had forgotten that I had it in one of the pockets in my\njacket. The letter from this, what used to be the Italian cultural and it was in the government,\nwith all these stamps and the letter said that you know Miss senorina, senorina Trude, it was all\nin Italian is a friend of the governor of the coastal area of Albania and should be allowed to pass\nbecause that was for their know. And when they saw this one of them said, what\u2019s this. And I\nsaid, I then so again I must say when I think my daughters or my granddaughters wouldn\u2019t have\nbut they hadn\u2019t been through everything that I had. I said that\u2019s the only thing that we\u2019ll say.\nSo I said don\u2019t you understand Italian. And they said no. I said well then you\u2019re very stupid and I\ngot a big beating but then she said well what does it say? So I then said but I read out something\nwhich wasn\u2019t there at all. I said and I know the governor. I know that they are on the flight to\nLondon and that senorina Trude Grunewald will let me know when she arrives. And if I don\u2019t\u2019\nhear I will check up on her. I made that up on the spur of the moment. And she said you\u2019re lying\nand I said is there nobody. I said everybody like you who doesn\u2019t understand. Tell him tell me.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nit should be in Italian. Italy is your friend. So what are you talking? I got a lot of bashing, but I\ndon\u2019t \u2014 so one of them said to the other, look after these two Jews. And she went out and she\ncame back and she obviously had found somebody who had read this and understood that it was\nthe Governor of Italian governor of the coastline of Albania.\nSo she said get dressed and so we were bleeding and we were not in a fit state. And my mother\ncertainly wasn\u2019t so when I helped her to dress, they stopped me from helping her and it was\nterrible. And then we were dressed and they said now you can go back on your plane. So I said\nour passports because they had them on the (inaudible). They said you have no right. You can\ncall yourself very lucky that we let you go so don\u2019t ask for anything. If I were you two.

I\u2019ve been looking for her and\nthrough the Albanian embassy, where there is one young woman whose parents live in Durr\u00e9s\nand they are so keen on helping me find my outcome. So she wrote to her parents and she found\nthat this young woman, she\u2019s lovely. She now works for the American embassy in Tirana. But\nshe now has a lot of property because after the communists went out, now they, everybody who\nhad property can reclaim them. So the house in which I was sitting and watching the port, the\ndevelopers got it and so she got some money from that. But they knocked it down and put a -- I\ndon\u2019t know about seven or eight floors apartment building where there are shops. And she said\nyou must come and stay with me. I have three such (boards?) and she is just, I mean she drove\nme everywhere and she calls me Grandma and I mean I can have everything.\nShe gave me when I left, you know in Albania they make specially strong brandy.

So he lived there with his young daughter. Now\nwhen he died and I still remember when he died because my mother was terribly, she was -- to\nme what she always told me about him I always compared him with Fiddler on the Roof because\nhe was selling agricultural machinery. And he always, he always told me that, he always talked\nto God because he would have to go plow a field.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nBut you know when Pesach come always in spring, right, when fathers have to buy agricultural\nmachinery for their field. So he would say now will you get them to buy from me? You must.\nI\u2019ve got all these children. I\u2019ve got to buy clothes for them. And it all costs money. Where do I\nget it from? From you. You must do that and then obviously he always managed to get some\norders. Because that was a time when farmers wanted. And he would then say well thank you\nvery much. You\u2019ve done it again. Now remember. The year, next year. They\u2019ll want the same\nservice. You know he was very much, to me he was always representing Fiddler on the Roof.",
        "A: I was you know we lived in this 20\" district which was all Jewish. And when I went into\nprimary school there wasn\u2019t a non-Jewish child in my class. But as I, when these things as I told\nyou, my father was one of the early free thinkers in Vienna. This was quite an important thing.\nAnd so he reasoned and because my mother came from very old sort of background so she was\nvery keen to bring her children up as good German. But my father had reined(?) her and he kept\narguing that you want our children to have a moral behavior. But you don\u2019t need religion for\nthat. You can bring them up as moral citizens, that they care for what their society, this was the\nearly socialism.\nI mean and then and he was involved in the abolition of the monarchy. And also he, when the\nFirst World War, when the Austrian empire lost, there was no demobilization. Wherever,\nwhoever had survived, wherever they were, the soldiers I mean, they could just go home.\nNobody would help them. There was no telephone. Nothing. So my mother was then expecting\nher second child which was created when he came home on this special leave. So she didn\u2019t\nknow whether she still had a husband, which you know I never could understand when I was a\nlittle -- this brother of mine, she always favored. And I always was very jealous of him. First of\nall he was a weakling because she had been pregnant for then, very difficult period. And I was\nvery strong. I was born in 22, when Uncle Willie was already supporting us.\nSo and he would say, he would sit his children next to each other and he would under the table\npinch me and I would go plunk. And my mother would say now don\u2019t hit your brother and he\nwould sit there like with an angel face. He hadn\u2019t done anything. He would, nothing.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nSo he was never my favorite brother.",

But then when he was 80 and\nI was 70, it was no age difference. The age difference disappears once, and he has always been\nmy one. And he has always been very innovative. He has been a fantastic. I really miss him.",

And also when I was at\nschool, in primary school. By that time we had the first social democratic government. And they\nwere really wonderful. There were many Jews involved.

She came, she met Uncle Willie in Vienna. And she met my parents and she\nsaid to my -- couldn\u2019t you have taken care having another child. Why do you need another child\nbecause she wasn\u2019t really keen on her son in law to having all these burdens. He was very good.",

That much I \u2014 she was in love with a father\nwith a man who was the father of four daughters and lived below us. So and he had a son so\nwhen she couldn\u2019t get the father she fell in love with the brother and it was the son. So she was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nalways unlucky in love. But she didn\u2019t want to admit this in front of the brother who was\nsupporting her. So we went to a restaurant where there was dancing. So there were gigolos. So\nshe went. We thought she had gone to the loo but then she left, she left the table. She talked to\nthe waiter that one of the gigolos. You didn\u2019t of course know who would come and ask her. And\nwe were all saying you know \u2014 she was a bit fat. She wasn\u2019t very attractive. But she felt she had\nto show her brother and you know when I heard my father, when once she was dancing, Uncle\nWillie was saying, I don\u2019t think he really wanted her, don\u2019t get excited. You know this one, Paul\nwon\u2019t remember that because he was a few years younger.",

Actually I learned the song, Chacharano, Chacharano [ph] because we heard\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nthe soldiers walk past and sing it. And so and then after my, after the director of this factory\ncame back from his summer leave, my father took us to Rovas Goslate and at that time the sister\nof my aunt, uncle Willie\u2019s wife had a, she was married but not to a rich man. And but she was\nalways the pretty jealous of her sister who had done so well. And she had a little girl who was a\nyear younger than I was. That, well actually I think it was two years before the Nazis, before,\nmust have been in 1936.",
        "A: No, whatever.",
        "A: Paul will remember. Paul will remember. And so my aunt then thought well she\u2019ll take her\nsister for summer holiday to Spoleto, to Split, which was a sea side. And she would have to take\nher sister and her little girl. So these were two young women who were a team to be admired by\nmen. And so we were staying. And so she needed somebody for this niece of hers. And I suited\nthe bill. And so they asked, she asked my parents and they asked me and I said yes, of course I'll\ngo. I was keen to go. And for me it was a (inaudible) to herself. She was about my age. We\u2019ll\nhave a good time. But this, so we had the room together. I had the room with this niece of hers.\nAnd they were two sisters. So every evening in a very popular town. For me this was heaven.\nAnd we\u2019d have dinner in this restaurant where there was a lot of dancing. And these two women\nwere very keen to be asked to dance and they really were. So this younger little girl, whatever\nher name was, was very worried that her mother was betraying her father. Because there were\nmen. We all had (inaudible). And this young girl always stood at the bar because the two sisters\nhad the room next to her, also had a (inaudible). And they were all men calling. Hello. Hello,\nhello. Go for walks you know. And she\u2019d say I can\u2019t. What does mother do? And then one of\nthem -- I mean still were men (inaudible) with her. He and one of these guys who were\ninterested. I mean these were holiday flirtations came and she must have told him that she had\nthis daughter. And he came and brought a doll.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: A doll and when she saw this doll she goes (sound effect) and the head of the doll fell off and\nI was like poor doll you know and she was very, I mean that was very stupid. But that man\nobviously had no children and wasn\u2019t married. And then she told him. Did you tell him that I\nlike playing with dolls. And but she had, she was much smaller than -- I was a tall girl and\nlooked much older. But she looked like a little girl. So her mother got away with it, saying she\nhad a very little girl. So this guy was obviously trying to endear himself to her and bringing\ndolls. But the little girl wasn\u2019t that little, not very young. But then one evening, I also remember\nso they were, we were sitting and eating and the music played for dancing. And a young man\ncame walked, so that he looked that he was coming to our table, so these two sort of you know.\nAnd do you know who he asked. Me. So. And I wasn\u2019t there you know for me, it was -- I\nwasn\u2019t going. I couldn\u2019t dance. But that really was infradig.",
        "A: Well it was in 1936.",
        "A: No my father was so committed to this and actually there was a, the guy who was called\nTambour. I don\u2019t know whether that name means some -- he was one of the major politicians, a\nJewish. And he was in the government and the Social Democratic and actually he arranged for us\nto move then. Because we only had a very small apartment. When my father came home every\nmonth. He was home for at least one week because Yugoslavia had a law that only Yugoslavs\ncould work for Yugoslav firms. So my father was an Austrian citizen and he was working for a\nYugoslav firm. So Uncle Willie actually got him a certificate that he was working for a Czech\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nfirm. So you could, a foreigner could work for a Czech firm. But and that was actually the\nreason then that when the going got bad, when we were expelled from Yugoslavia that my father\nwas taken to prison. Because before that, he had that certificate and he\u2019d write the politician and\nthe police in these places where he was selling because you couldn\u2019t hide that you were selling\nYugoslav produced goods.",
        "A: So before that he would come. And he would still be friends and this was this guy who was in\nthe, he was never in the government because he was in Yugoslavia. But he still had this friend\nand when the minister of education came to visit the primary school where I was, he looked, he\nwent into the classroom and he looked at the register. And he saw my, Trude Grunewald. So\nTrude Grunewald. The minister of education and what does he want and he said is your father\nSiegfried Grunewald? And I said yes. And he said give him my best greetings. I am very fond.\nWas I (sigh) you know when I told my father you know he was thrilled. So then when the,\nTambour, then we got an apartment in the Karl Marx which was then a new. I don\u2019t know\nwhether you realize that this Austrian social, first social democratic government pioneered\ncouncil housing. They built these council houses which was then followed, and I remember\nseeing King Edward who them resigned because of Mrs. Simms.",
        "A: So because anybody, any important person that came to him, they always took them to the\nKarl because it was a fantastically planned building.",
        "A: Yeah this was a, remember being and you\u2019ve been to Vienna.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: But you haven\u2019t seen the Karl Marx. It was in Grinzing so I then had to change schools.\nAnd this is where you saw me, when I was at the play.",
        "A: There was no, there were just a few. You see sort of the revere, the government wanted to put\na few Jewish middle class families with all, because all the others were people who they had\ntaken out of the slums and put them into brand new bright apartments. And I mean the\nconservatives would say, they will also be black. They will all be turned \u2014 but they kept it and in\na sense that saved our lives. We never had very atrocious persecution because most of them were\nin a pro, I mean the whole -- there was Dollfuss before the Anschluss and also what nobody\nknew. We didn\u2019t even know that when we left there. That there was sort of the top floor was\nsupposed to be for hanging up. There was one building in the center which had washing\nmachines in 1930, automatic -- well you just pressed the button as we do now and it washed.\nAnd it even had ironing. I would go and every apartment had two days per month in the washing\nmachine to do their wash.\nAnd my mother would take her sheets down, put them in the washing, take them out and I would\nthen come to help her iron them because she would just put them in the roller and I would take\nthem out the other side. And so all the important people, the VIPs that came were all shown.\nAnd King Edward was shown when we had our, there.",
        "A: No it was ground floor. Actually there was a first floor where because there were no baths.\nYou couldn\u2019t have a, you had to go to this public bath. Again you could go however many times\nyou wanted as a, you have an apartment there. But there wasn\u2019t a lift there, the stairs.",
        "A: Yes, I had never experienced. I mean my mother was terribly upset because she took me to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nthis new school because I had gone to school 1n this very Jewish area. So anti-Semitism, and I\nwas a very unfriendly little girl. I never you know my mother she was very friendly. She knew\neverybody and everybody knew her. When she went shopping, she would take me. Well when I\nwas little, I would say, when her female friends say well hello little girl. And my mother said,\nwell say hello. It is not my friend. Why should I say hello. And I made up a story that I am not\nreally my parents\u2019 child. I loved the sea and I have been for one summer we had been to Tsir\nGranitsa [ph] which is a holiday resort. And that gave me the idea, I must have been a child of\ngypsies.",
        "A: Because I was born by the sea and I made up that the gypsies were living by the sea because I\nliked it. They were, I would be the child of gypsies. But then my parents paid for me and so I\nam now adopted. I still remember my mother\u2019s face was always so upset and she always used to\nsay, why do you tell me this story. I said well you\u2019re not from the family, you\u2019re not from the\nseaside and I love the sea. So I must be. I was very logical really. But not to the, you know\nclever or what not.\nBut my father was all right because I was the apple of his eye. I couldn\u2019t do wrong and\nparticularly when I brought him greetings from the minister of education.",
        "A: Well, Otto my brother, ten years older, he went to the technological college in Vienna, not\nreally (inaudible). And he was there as being at you know technical and this was I mean Austria\nwas always anti-Semitic. There was a special police for, that looked after the universities. And\nevery year when the students come and those who came from Jewish parents, they had to walk\nthrough a court on both sides anti-Semites and they would just run and be beaten. And the police\nwould just stand there and not interfere.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: Well it was as long as I remember that my brother. That was long in 19, he must have been\nhe was born in 12 so he must have been about 22, 24 so in the early 30s but it might have been\nbefore because I only know because he -- a knuckle duster. You know what a knuckle duster. He\njoined when the Jews joined what was called the Schutzbund which was the organization to\ndefend the social democratic government. But there was a schutzbund for workers and there was\na schutzbund for students. And he was with the schutzbund for children. And he came home and\nhe showed me his knuckle duster. And he said I will not just be beaten. I will also return it and I\nwas greatly impressed.\nBut then and do you know we had Dollfuss, does the name Dollfuss. Well Dollfuss there was a\nin February 1934 there was a general strike because it involved, there was a Chris -- Dollfuss\nwas. You know what I find very interesting, all the partisan were socialists. You had Hitler was\na national socialist. Dollfuss and Schuschnigg were Christian Socialists. Every party was\nsocialist. It was the thing to be, but they were quite different from the \u2014 but they didn\u2019t. So we\nthen had the general strike and the Schutzbund the fighting unit was then and what they never\ntold that I mean but the Schutzbund means that. My brother also knew what but he never told\nthem that the Karl Marx, all the top floors you could walk. It was one kilometer, a sort of oval\nbuilding inside gardens and playgrounds and wash house and you know bars and everything. It\nwas all in it, but you could walk. Of course you could go up one stair and come out another. And\nthis enabled a lot of them, because there was lots of fighting.\nNow my brother Otto being, having been with the university students come fighting unit, and but\nhe knew my father was, and Schuschnigg. No, then that was later. In 1934 there was a general\nstrike and so there was fighting. They wanted to defend and Dollfuss and the Karl Marx building\nis a the flat ground, but there is the Hoinvalta [ph] which was a high, when there was a big\nfootball ground and this is where Dollfuss put cannon to shoot them so they couldn\u2019t, they only\nhad machine guns. But they fought and so they were -- I was then 12 years old and all the\nschools were closed. And when I turned up at school, my friends always thought oh there comes\nthe heroine. But this was when the first, that the first should you know kill -- because and also,\nso my brother had to report because they all knew their players were the reservists.\nBut then my father was already traveling in there as well, so he knew that my mother was home\nwith two small children. So he got permission to go home. And when he came and we were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nsitting because we were glued to the wireless because everybody wanted to know what\u2019s going\non. And we were deadly silent as my mother was very worried that her son she knew he was\nwith them. And there he came and she was all over him. And he said I\u2019ve only come, leave to\nfind out how you all are coping but I\u2019ve got to go back. And my mother, you can\u2019t go back. I\nmean she depended on him to help her you know in the household. He was her big help. There\nwas a wonderful relationship. He was very close to her. She was very close to him. He wasn\u2019t\nvery close to my father.\nSo when he wanted to go and was going to there, she knelt. I still, and clutched his legs and\ndidn\u2019t want him to go. And he tore himself loose and he walked out. And we were all sitting you\nknow the two of us, Kurt my brother and my mother was tears and crying. And I didn\u2019t know\nwhat to say.\nAnd then we heard the first shot and of course we sat there and we thought he had just gone.\nHe\u2019s dead. A few minutes later he came back. I think I wrote this in my auto (phone ringing)",
        "A: It sort of is the basis for my concern for the poorest and for my sort of left wing politics began\nthen.",
        "A: In 1934. Because my brother, then my father was in Yugoslavia and couldn\u2019t reach us\nbecause we had no telephone there. And but he had a colleague who was also from Vienna, also\na Jewish family and they lived in the second district which was all Jewish. So there would be no\nSchutzbund by it. And he told his colleagues to bring his family in Vienna and get them to\ncontact us that we could stay with them. We should get out of this dangerous because there were\ntimes driving. If they saw a face coming to a window, they would shoot and of course we were\nall keen to look out. And anyway we then went to this family and my brother when we listened\nto the radio, they then executed some of the leaders of the strike which were some of his friends.\nSo you know this was my first sort of real experience of how awful and how extreme\nconservative, extreme fascist governments can be.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nAnd then Otto said to me, now listen. Little sister, listen carefully. When somebody comes, he\nwon\u2019t tell you he\u2019s a policeman but if he asks you any question, you just say I don\u2019t know. Soa\npoliceman came and my mother sort of just looked at me. She didn\u2019t say anything. And he then\nsaid what\u2019s your name little girl. And I said I don\u2019t know. How old are you? I don\u2019t know.\nThis policeman must have thought this poor kid doesn\u2019t even, must be crazy. For every\nquestion. I just said I don\u2019t know. I mean just as well that he didn\u2019t know. And he didn\u2019t ask me\nwhy you would say -- I might have said well my brother told me to.",
        "A: So this was when I sort of the first experience because and I mean he said to me. Because if\nyou said that I you know had gone out to, go back to the Schutzbund then your brother might be\nput into jail and you don\u2019t want that. No. So I always said no, I don\u2019t know. And well then came\nof course Dollfuss was assassinated. And Schuschnigg came.",
        "A: And that was in 1937. Dollfuss was, Schuschnigg. And I mean both of them were really\nextreme Christian socialists. And they were both anti-Semitic and they were the, followed -- I\nmean very much the same policies as Hitler. But they didn\u2019t want Austria to be part of Germany.\nAnd so that was why Dollfuss was assassinated. Then his buddy Schuschnigg became the\nchancellor and Hitler asked, by that time Hitler was in government in Germany. And of course\nhe being an Austrian and having been in jail in Austria, obviously now he is a, I mean\nGotitmaster fell and it was such a pity that he committed suicide but they couldn\u2019t you know\nput him in jail and really in --",
        "A: Yeah because he must have been. Because it was so obvious. He was a little guy who would\nnever dreamt of being Hitler and people would shout Heil Hitler. I mean when you now see the\nfilms when he made his speeches. He looks like a maniac.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: For me it was really a mass hypnosis. I had never been subjected. I mean for me this was a\nturning point altogether. Again it was Otto who rang me and developed a story. He told me to go\nto the Yugoslav embassy and ask for Mr. Miderman. Take our passport. When you meet Mr.\nMiderman, he rang home. He was out. And he was very clever because he was, you know there\nwas Bloomsbury house in London. Have you heard of that?",
        "A: This is where all the refugees had to register. Right. His registration number was 257. He got\nhere very soon. And you know how? Because the year before in 19, summer 1937 he went with\nKurt, my two brothers went hitchhiking. And in Switzerland, a lift, asking for a lift. And this was\nthe thing for students to do. And they got a lift in Switzerland from an English Jewish couple\nwho were driving around Europe. And they quickly established that they were also Jewish\nbecause by that time it was also already on the cards that we were going to be part of Germany.\nAnd Otto was always innovative. They were driving in a car. And they then went to Salzburg.\nAnd of course a Jewish couple stayed in a posh hotel. But they stayed in the new Salzburg. But\nhe said to Kurt look we get up early tomorrow and we wash their car. Make it look clean,\nsparkling. When they come down they see that. And they saw that and they thought these two are\nnice lads. You know. Washed our car. And they were driving to Vienna so they took them to\nthe, they showed them around Vienna. We were in Yugoslavia when they were there. And so\nOtto then -- when Hitler, when Austria was annexed wrote to them and said please can you send\nus, send me a fraudulent correspondence. Say that I am at the, what they were doing in London\nwas to buy second hand cars and sell them and he said you write to me as if I was your, working\nfor you and your agent in Austria in buying old car and shipping them to you. And they did that.\nAnd he was so early so and then he always liked English. He made his what would be called\nschool leaving certificate and they had to write a long essay and he wrote it about Jack London in\nEnglish.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",

        "A: No after the Anschluss.",
        "A: But a few weeks after because he immediately -- and also I mean there were so many\ninteresting things. We had my youngest uncle, my youngest paternal uncle was a very nice guy.\nDuring the First World War he went onto the allied side. He went over from the Austrian Empire\nand he was in China. They went to China then. From, from Russia and my grandparents didn\u2019t\nknow. There was no communication. There was no register where he was or whether he was still\nalive and he turned up then so and he was quite a, I mean I loved him.",
        "A: Amin, Amin Grunewald and he had a very attractive wife who walked out on him. But\nanyway he came to Vienna after the Anschluss and said I\u2019Il take you all to Czechoslovakia.\nYou'll be all right there. They all perished in Auschwitz. At first in Theresienstadt. I have still\ngot cousins in Czechoslovakia. In Czech.",
        "A: Yeah and untouchable because said well the Czechs give us visas. And he said I\u2019Il tell you\nwhat. I marry Trude. He wanted to marry, I mean just as a formality. He didn\u2019t want me as his\nwife but and I worked out, I would be my brother\u2019s aunt and would be my mother\u2019s sister in law\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nand I had great fun. But ultimately the dream of that. He said you\u2019ll be next and so they were. So\nOtto was very clever.",
        "A: Was the mastermind.",
        "A: Well the plan was that he would go to and he did go to England and he would get us English\nvisas. And he did but much later.",
        "A: Well he just, you know he worked as a packer in this slave labor. I mean he had a degree as\nan electrical engineer. But they would not employ him that way.",
        "A: No, no. He went by train. But that was very early. But then he, it\u2019s interesting. All my life\nthat\u2019s why I say he\u2019s been my role model. Because he would then write to me what I should do.\nHe wouldn\u2019t write to Kurt. Because Kurt was just weak. He was a sick, sickly child so he was\nafraid to go out. He stayed home. Only I and I was, he told Otto said, you dress yourself as one\nof the German girls and then you go and see Mr. Miderman. And on that day, was a day as you\nsaw, Hitler came to Austria, to Vienna.",
        "A: And a\u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: Yes. Yes, because you see the thing was, he didn\u2019t he said well you just go by the\nunderground. We have them. There was an underground already in Vienna and that went right to\nthe Ringstrasse, you know the circular road. And that\u2019s where you go out. Have, will have to\nget out and then you walk along and that\u2019s where. What he didn\u2019t know and I didn\u2019t know was\nfirst of all, all the Nazi government that quickly took over and welcomed Hitler, was offering\nfree transport to all the Austrians. To come and welcome the Fuhrer. That\u2019s why there were all\nthe people there. And I didn\u2019t know that. But I went on when everybody went onto the\nunderground so I followed. And then I got into a carriage and there was an elderly lady and there\nwas a place next to her.\nSo I sat there in my nice uniform and she said you\u2019re also going to welcome the Fuhrer. And at\nthat point I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to say because I was taught you know a moral way and you\nmust never tell a lie. And that was sort of not, but then I -- and I must say on that day, as I sat\nthere. I kind of, I was catapulted into a little, I felt now I have to make decision, lie or no lie. And\nthat\u2019s what I did. So then when we have got to the circular road and we all got out. There were\nthese masses of people already there. And just then his carriage came and he was standing there.\nLike you see in the film.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well I was because I was a young girl in a marching uniform they let me right through you\nknow the sort of barricades.",
        "A: A Nazi uniform. My brother, Otto had told me at that time was a white blouse and navy skirt,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nwhite half socks, black shoe. I had that. I mean that\u2019s, I guess why they made that their uniform\nbecause every girl would have that.",
        "A: No, no it wasn\u2019t. I just there you go.",
        "A: My mother was terrified because she knew from the radio that everybody could go free and\nHitler would make us welcome. He made his first speech and that speech was on the\nSchwarzenberg Platz which was opposite the Yugoslav embassy.",
        "A: No I didn\u2019t. After I, I had shouted Heil Hitler and then I stopped and I thought what had I\ndone.",
        "A: (both talking) Hitler. Everybody and in a sense with hindsight I think I would have been\nlynched if I hadn\u2019t shouted Heil Hitler. In the first row. So it was, but I didn\u2019t do it as a survival\nstrategy. I was literally hypnotized. There was millions of people screaming their heads off so\nyou know what do you do? You join them. But then when I got to and there\u2019s this Jewish queue\nin front of the Yugoslav embassy and they all looked at me. What do I do now? You know Otto\nhadn\u2019t sort of prepared for me for, all he had said was take our passports, get our mothers to give\nyou all our passports and go and ask for Mr. Miderman. That\u2019s all I knew. But he didn\u2019t tell me\nhow he knew him. And you know what should I say when I meet him. So at that point really I\nbecame another one. I told my second lie. You know when I saw this and I managed the guard.\nAnd the guard, my second lie was. I still remember. The guard said well what do you want. I\nsaid I want to see Mr. Miderman. And he said do you know Mr. Miderman. And I said yes of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\ncourse. You know but you know at a moment\u2019s notice. And then when I saw Mr. Miderman and\nhe even said how did you know about me. Why did you come here? So I took out my passport\nand said to him I\u2019ve come to collect visas. He said who told you about me. And it was at that\npoint that I thought, but before this I had seen that he was packing so I thought I didn\u2019t know\nwhat he was but he was packing. He didn\u2019t seem resident there. So I didn\u2019t know. Otto hadn\u2019t\ntold me but immediately I said Otto can\u2019t have known him. He is obviously somebody that is\ngoing somewhere now. And then he told me he was the ambassador for Yugoslavia and since\nAustria was no more an independent state he was moving back to Belgrade. That was all and he\ncouldn\u2019t give any visas then. But he said well who told you. And I think Otto. I don\u2019t know how\nbut ultimately you know how he knew. Did I say that in the \u2014 he signed the waivers. We\u2019d been\nto Yugoslavia. He signed them so he read Mr. Miderman signs the visas. So she must go and see\nMr. Miderman. And for him it was simple. But that I wouldn\u2019t know what to say didn\u2019t occur to\nhim. So I thought at the spur of the moment if I say my brother had sent me, he would say well\nwho is your brother. And how do I explain that? So I then produced Uncle Willie. And said my\nuncle rang me last night. I was lying right left and center. The sort of moral behavior\ndisappeared.",
        "A: But that I never found out. But once I had said he rang me and he had said I should meet Mr.\nMiderman at the embassy, he didn\u2019t ask me anymore. Whether he knew him or not but I think I\ndon\u2019t know. But I\u2019ve worked out that he might not have known him but might have thought he\nshould have known him. And he was I said to, he is one of the biggest textile manufacturers in\nYugoslavia. You must know him. What he, what went on his mind I don\u2019t know but it was that,\nthat he then put his arm around my shoulder and he said well I\u2019ll try and find it. And he walked\nme to the counsel and just knocked and (inaudible) pushed me in and said I am bringing you a\nyoung friend. She needs visas. Help her. Well it took three months, but I went there when you\nknow and then when I got the visas he said, the counsel said well how did you know Mr.\nMiderman. And I said he was just a friend.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: No.",
        "A: The thing is at that time before that Otto was in England. My father was in Yugoslavia and\nwe, there was supposed to be a plebiscite for the Austrians to vote yes or no, whether we want,\nAustria wanted to be in West Germany. Now I think now when I remember that crowd that I\nsaw that Hitler needed have no worry. He would have been voted in anyways. But he didn\u2019t wait\nfor that. But all the Jews, by that time, my father knew. I mean he had known that he was\nJewish. But he also knew what the Jews were suffering in Germany. So he then knew, you know\nhe must come, all the Jews who were outside Austria, but were Austrian citizens were all making\nback to Austria to cast their vote in the hope that they would influence the result.\nSo my father had rang us by that time. We had a telephone and said I am just going on the train\nbut just then about five minutes before, we had just heard Schuschnigg\u2019s last speech. And that\nwas horrifying because he was always, he made a lot of speeches, all Austria must vote and must\nvote for independence. That\u2019s what he knew. And he was making another speech and all of a\nsudden you heard as if things were knocked about and you didn\u2019t know. I mean you listen to the\nradio and you heard knocking. And then you heard him say, people are just coming in and they\nare taking me away. This is the end of Austria. God bless Austria and Horst Wesselneed [ph],\nyou know the German which goes today Germany, belongs to us. Tomorrow the whole world.\nSo we knew the Nazis had, but what had happened was that the Nazi, German troops Hitler had\nalready arranged for the German troops to cross the river, I mean Austria didn\u2019t have a\n(inaudible).\nSo this was the end. And my father then rang. And Otto answered the phone. My father said I am\njust going to the station to catch the train to be home. And Otto said well you know it was\ninteresting. Immediately you felt the Nazis would be listening to what you say. I mean they\nweren't that efficient to hacking, phone hacking, right. Murdoch now has been doing.\nBut this was sort of mentality. So then Otto said don\u2019t come back and my father said but I must\nbe with you. Listen to me. Don\u2019t come back. Finish. I can\u2019t tell you anymore. Listen to what\nyour radio is saying. And my father was never in Austria after that which was very difficult for\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nme because to him, I remained his little girl that can\u2019t make, little girls don\u2019t make decisions.\nYou know important what you should do, what you shouldn\u2019t. But before that after that, when\nOtto was in England, he wrote to me that he had a network of friends also Jewish. But they were\nall social democrats. It was that that bound them together, not their (inaudible). And one of\nthem, he actually died in England, last year. He was a close friend of Otto\u2019s. And he was married\nalready and he had, they were living in Italy. So he wrote to, Otto was trying to get Kurt out but\nhe couldn\u2019t get him. Otto then flirted with one old lady who worked in the British home office\nwho was in charge of giving visas. And he had a reason why he flirt, and he ultimately got a visa\nfor Kurt. But he didn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t get it quick enough and he too knew that Kurt was really very\nfrightened and it was hard there. So this friend said, because Austrians didn\u2019t need a visa for\nItaly but if you went by train you could cross the border. But not if you had a passport with a big\nred J. The Italians didn\u2019t want that.\nBut ordinary Austrians, not Jewish could just go in. So he then, this friend from him, who settled\nin Italy, wrote to Otto and told him send your brother. He knew Kurt. And he actually stayed\nwith them in Italy. They said send him by air, because the Italians had not yet realized that you\ncan fly and that you can arrive in the country, the border people, the border police was trained.\nYou see a passport with a red J, back, no you know but they flew. At the airports they hadn\u2019t\ntrained police, trained people who spoke there.",
        "A: I got Kurt. Kurt wouldn\u2019t go out. I, so Otto wrote to me. You went to the chet [ph] the Italian\ntravel there and then book a flight as early as you can for Kurt to fly to Italy. Once you\u2019ve got the\nticket tell me and he will get, arrange that he will be met on arrival. And that\u2019s what I did. And I\nwas very cross then when I came back. Kurt then flew to Italy and second week in May and the\nAnschluss was in March. And he was very cross with me that I hadn\u2019t got him a flight the day\nafter. So that\u2019s why there was never a very close relationship with him.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: No, no because there were in Austria in Vienna, sharks. When I came out of the Yugoslav\nembassy, there was one guy that asked me what I had been doing there. And I said I\u2019ve come to\ncollect visas. I had and he said have you go them yet. I said no. He said well if you convert, I\ncan get you a birth certificate of grandparents, because you had to have at least two, grand, non-\nJewish, Christian.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: Yes, yes and I mean I, Otto didn\u2019t tell me about him so I didn\u2019t bother. But it wasn\u2019t only me\nthat he stopped because he knew all those Jews that were in the queue, they are unlikely to get\nthe visas.",
        "A: Well I thought that that guy looked to me as if he was Jewish but I never asked his name or\nanything but there were quite a lot of sharks there.",
        "A: Because first of all to we didn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t know whether it would work. You\u2019d have to put\nthe money down. Whether you went and then they said well fraud, I mean these were only\nfraudulent documents. Whether they would accept them because you would have to produce\nyour grandparents.",
        "A: No but not for your grandparents. No. You have to think of the total implication and yes and\nthey convert you. I mean there was the book Michel, Michel, did you ever see that. A little boy\nwhose parents were Jewish in France. Whose parents gave him in to a convent through the nuns,\nsay. And after the war, the parents perished but some relative were in Israel and they then went\nto find him. They had to fight because the nuns wanted to keep him. And this little boy\nobviously, I have here actually a very interesting thing. I go swimming to the Metropole which\nis a hotel here. Have a leisure center and they usually have fire alarms and usually they have\ntraining. So if you are in the pool, you go and just put the dressing on and you have to go\nupstairs to the reception. And then it goes all clear and that\u2019s all finished.\nBut once at last a door. We were all from the pool standing, we were in the, all dressing room.\nAnd there was a young woman and I was sort of shaking my head showing that I was impatient.\nIt wasn\u2019t, why do they keep us in here. But actually then the fire brigade came and there had\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nbeen an actual fire. And one person had lit an electric fire and that had caught something and so\nthere had been a fire in the room. But there was this young woman who somehow, I don\u2019t know\nwhy it is when I find a fellow Jew. I somehow feel that they are fellow Jews.\nI don\u2019t know what it is. Do you know? You feel some sort of affinity and there was this young\nwoman, looking very Jewish. Pale but quite hefty. So I said what do you think and so we began\nto talk and then they offered us all coffee and we sat having coffee. And she said where are you\nfrom. So I always say I am a Jewish refugee from Vienna cause you heard me say it.\nAnd she said you know my father is also from Vienna. Well her story, she is called Popper, P-O-\nP-P-E-R and she is a lovely young woman. So she also told her parents about my autobiography.\nHer paternal grandparents had a restaurant in the center of Vienna. It might have been one of the\nrestaurants that Uncle Willie had taken us. But certainly were well off. So they bought\nimmediately as the Anschluss occurred, a holiday ticket I think to Cyprus and off they went,\nbefore they introduced a red J on the passports. When you had money you could go. So they\nwent there and then they went from Cyprus they went to Kenya. And in Kenya his parents put\nhim into a monastery school and he converted to Catholicism. And he is, he looks like the\nstricher [ph] Jews. He has been, she brought them here. Her mother is a good England British, I\nthink an Anglican but not a Jew. He is a devout Catholic and he brought up, she has a brother so\ntwo children. And both of them were forced to go to church on Sunday and confess and all the\nparaphernalia. And she is now claiming everywhere, she is second generation Jewish. And we\nhad her you know Michele, the adopted daughter. And we always have a big Seder because there\nwere other couples from Sussex University. Jewish, who also had children of the age as ours\nwere. SO we every year it was at a different house.\nBut then was my husband conducted the Seder. My husband had died so Michele said mommy\ndon\u2019t because we were usually 30 or 40 people. So it was quite a lot for me. She said I\n(inaudible) it will be just our family and (inaudible) since then she has (inaudible). So this year\ntoo and so I said Michele can I bring this Popper. I asked her, would you. She said I\u2019d love to\nsee her so she came and she is now, she wants to convert. She feels very ill at ease (\u2019?).\nSo you know there are cases but he feels but here, I had him here when DT Rolner this poet from\nIsrael was staying with me. Just coincidentally her parents came to see her so she said can I bring\nthem along. I said yes, bring them along. And we\u2019ll see how your father feels about meeting an\nIsraeli poet whose mother had been to Auschwitz and who was (inaudible). And I have never\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nseen him so ill at ease. I said well 1s this all new to you. And I sort of pretended I didn\u2019t know\nanything about anti-Semitism. Well I feel very sorry for her. So some, I mean obviously there are\nsome who even became bishops.",
        "A: Yeah. But do you know, that you don\u2019t know. You know Kate who was just married Prince\nWilliam. She\u2019s, her mother is Jewish.",
        "A: So actually",
        "A: No, Michelle\u2019s husband found it out I mean. Kate is his wife\u2019s name and she\u2019s now Princess\nKate, but her grandmother was a (inaudible) Jewess. And so her mother is obviously Jewish and\nso is She. So that\u2019ll be the first Jewish queen in England.",
        "A: Well that was also very interesting you see. When we arrived there Uncle Willie, we had my\nmother had from her father had been given some gold pieces for each one of us. When we were\nborn her father presented. And that she kept and she didn\u2019t want to leave so, I mean I decided.\nAnd she wanted, she thought she would get her furniture back and all her household. So I had to\nfind packers and in Vienna we called that a lift. You know big case and things, put all the, and so\nI had to decide this doesn\u2019t go, but this can. And my mother wanted, on top of it, she wanted the\nawards that my father had got at the First World War. And I said look who will look at them.\nEven if they\u2019re saved, that won\u2019t change them. And so and actually I gave a lot to our neighbors\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nin the Karl Marx building. And then when we, before we made back from the Ring, I wanted a\nfilm that will show that people helped her. So the film director who I told you is a Bronx Jew\nand now is married to a Swedish woman, who made the film without getting any money out of it.\nHe thought that we needed money because we needed to pay expenses. It costs things to process\nthem. So we\u2019re meeting the (inaudible). We each put some money in, but not enough. So he then\nsaid well he wanted to sort of build the whole film and he thought we could get the money\nbecause I say and this is true the first society that has made me feel I belong. The first group of\npeople. Because sociologically you know that none no individual can live as an individual, we all\nhave to belong to a group of people. Feeling we belong.\nAnd in Vienna I thought I was a girl, Austrian girl. They didn\u2019t think of me like that. I was\nthrown out of school. And then I came to Yugoslavia. And of course I wasn\u2019t a Yugoslav citizen\nbut my father and my mother then wanted to bring those gold pieces. I had a boyfriend as I\n(inaudible) and it was really when the, you know when our teacher at the last minute gave us our\ncertificate at the school which was a catchment school for all the Jewish kids. And the teachers\nweren't trained teachers. They were real Nazis. They were SS. They turned up in SS uniforms.\nAnd his speech was when he distributed our last certificates. I think that\u2019s in my autobiography\nwas I am sure that very few of you will manage to get out. But those few who will get out will\ndie in the gutter. That he told to 14, 15 year old kids.\nSo and I had this, I had you know we were, my mother never had enough money to give me a\nbirthday party. But my school pals were all kids from Jewish parents. So I always got my mother\nto let me have some presents because I was invited but I could never (inaudible) around. So but\nin this school they made it a catchment school. The words and it was a high class, high Jewish\nclass, the rich Jews had their children in this school. That school they made into a catchment\nschool. So well some of them were kids that had been there and my boyfriend who wooed me,\nhe sort of was the first one that I saw that way. And we were, and we were not allowed to be out.\nJews were not allowed after work. So I would stay the night in his house. A nice (inaudible) for\nme this was. And he would sort of put his arm around me and he said well even in the gutter I\nwill love you.\nSo I then met him in London. By that time his father had a little money, put me. That\u2019s another\nthing. I don\u2019t know whether you read this. Why there was, I?ll come to Albania. In Albania, I\nwas the only young girl. And there was a group and they joined you know about them. They\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nwere wonderful. Wherever Jewish refugees turned up they would provide subsistence money.\nAs long as there was a resident Jewish family.",
        "A: No, well I was in Yugoslavia for the time. And we went, we took my mother took this gold\npieces and I then came up with the idea, how do you get, she said well if the Nazis, if they see us\nwith our passport with the red J, the border control, they will search our luggage and if they find\nour gold, they will take them. And that\u2019s my most precious gold. So I came up with the idea we\nwill have rolls, have rolls and in the rolls Pll put the gold pieces and we got them nine bolts of\n(satin?) at one end. But at the station in Maribor, my father and uncle where they waited for. And\nfortunately the border we were at one end of the train and the border control started at the other\nend. So Uncle Willie said come on out and we got out and we never went to the border control\ndidn\u2019t see anything.\nBut then the first night, I mean now that I\u2019m old I can understand. For my parents it was their\nfirst stay together after horrible months for my father who was always worried, how do we\nsurvive and he knew my mother (inaudible) and I, this boyfriend had come to the station in\nVienna to see me off with a big bunch of roses to show me. And these roses I took with me. By\nthe time we got to Maribor they had wilted but I put them in a, I asked Uncle Willie. Auntie, his\nwife wasn\u2019t there. I can\u2019t remember where she was. She may have been in England. Because\nPaul and his brother were in school in England. And so I said can I have vase please. And of\ncourse they have an army of (servants?) and so I got the vase and I put these old sort of looking\nroses into it. And I put the photograph of my boyfriend there. And I cried my heart out because\nmy parents, you know for them this was the first night they spent together after you know. And\nhe couldn\u2019t understand that I had grown up. That I had now come to be the decision maker. I, in\na sense was the head of the family. Otto was in England. He was in Yugoslavia. Kurt was in\nEngland, in Italy. And I was with mama. And so who didn\u2019t dare to go and he treated me like his\nyou know little girl. And I said\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",

So he did and he got\na, he then wanted, and they said well get him to Zagreb. So that we can be together at least. But\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nhe would have come as a prisoner. But Uncle Willie paid for a private detective to bring him to\ntravel. So he wasn\u2019t traveling but again you know you must think that all these men who were\nafter me but it really was very strange. I was 16 years and there was a, there were in Zagreb also\nsharks. But there was one guy who had been with the police and he came along when he heard\nthat my father was coming with a private. He contacted us and said you don\u2019t have to leave, I can\nhelp you to get permits to stay. What did he want to do? He told my mother that I must go with\nhim to a small place by the seaside and stay with him a few days. He will arrange our permits.\nAnd my mother said no. No, no. But he then, so then he came and he, I mean he said to me, will\nyou kiss me. And I said you don\u2019t look like that I would kiss you. And he then said well if you\nkiss me, I go with you to the train station when your father arrives. Well I did kiss him because\nthat was very important for me.\nMy father got out with this private detective and my father, you know I was his little girl and\nthere he was. He said that\u2019s what your father has come to. He went on his knees in front of me.\nYour father came as a prisoner. And I said don\u2019t be so silly. \u2019 ve seen worse things happening.\nYou were lucky. You haven\u2019t seen all those things that I have seen. But he was crying then.",
        "A: He was feeling and we had to, and so he came. He then, this shark took us in his police car to\nmy aunt and that\u2019s where we stayed. But then the thing was that it was obvious that my father,\nwe would all have to go because the police came to check on us, our tourist visas were finished\nso they said if you can find another place, another country that will have you we don\u2019t mind. We\nare not against you but if you can\u2019t find anyone, we will ship you to the border. And we knew.\nSo my father and my mother were really so (inaudible). I mean they said to me what do you\nwant to get out of life. There\u2019s nothing. We have not (inaudible) so why should we move. And\nyou know now I think I should write something about my parental generation because they were\nthe ones that were hit most. They had lost everything. They had no future, they had nothing to\nlook forward to. So you know and there were suicides and one can understand it. But I didn\u2019t. I\nwasn\u2019t when I was 15 or 16 years, you are not ready.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: To Yugoslavia. We came from Vienna by train to Maribor.",
        "A: Again Uncle Willie paid for a private detective to travel with us. Otherwise we would have\nhad to \u2014 who got the police, agreed they would, he would take our passports. We weren\u2019t\nallowed to have them.",
        "A: We went by train from Zagreb to Spoleto, to Split and there, from there we went by ship. To\nDurr\u00e9s, the port in Albania. And the private detective handed over our passports to the captain.\nSo he fulfilled his commitment. But again we were, I mean the whole, friends of my aunt and\nuncle, everybody came to see us off. And there were so many boxes of chocolates and you know\neverybody felt very sorry for us. We were going, we were so (inaudible). And my mother said to\nUncle Willie, tell us we can\u2019t take it. So I then said, look. And money we could take only the\nequivalent of 50 pounds. And this is what my father said to me. He said, he told me he said you\nknow you are a young girl. You are really lovely but we arrive in a country that we don\u2019t know.\nWe don\u2019t know a soul there with 50 pounds. How long do you think we can survive? Can you\nthink at all? So Ivan and you mustn\u2019t take any more. So I then remembered how I had taken the\ngold pieces out. So I did the same with the chocolates. I hid, took them you know big box of\nchocolate, a bag of chocolates and put at the bottom money. Also we had 100 pounds. We took\nthe next of it.\nBut then I was standing. My parents, they sat in one of the apartment, compartments of the train\nand I stood on the, in the passage with the detective who was traveling with us. And so we\nstarted chatting. And I then said opened the door and said to my mother, I would like to offer\nour friend here chocolate. She thought I must be crazy you know. He\u2019d discover something but\nI didn\u2019t \u2014 but the thing was, this was you know and this was another one who I feel saved my\nlife. But my life inasmuch as my confidence that there are people who want to help because he\nasked me why. He didn\u2019t know why we, why he had to come with us. Why are we being thrown\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nout. So I told him and I told him about a few things that I'd seen in Vienna. And so he then said\nlook, he said Pll marry you. He said now don\u2019t worry. You will not be in any problem and we\nwill not have any problem and I will ask your parents and I said no, don\u2019t ask them. But he said\nif I marry you, it will be you and your parents will have automatically permits to stay.\nSo there was a guy who worked for the police who was prepared to help us. And really he may\nhave been in difficulties, likely to have been difficulties if he married, go in the next day and if\nwe got married. So there was another one like Mr. Miderman who didn\u2019t really know what, why\nand what he was doing. So as you have heard me say to my granddaughter when she asked me\nwhat does swimming upstream mean. And I said it means that I had to fight all the way in my\nlife.\nBut every time somebody cropped up and helped and that\u2019s quite true. So and then we arrived\nby ship. Now that was another thing. On that ship was a German couple. Because they had\nbought the journey on that ship on the premise that they would just take them to Greece because\nthat ship was going to Albania and further on and so on.\nAnd they couldn\u2019t get ashore to get to resort, to Greece. And they had a little baby and that little\nbaby was, they couldn\u2019t pay so the captain didn\u2019t know what to do. He didn\u2019t have, and he kept\nthem. They actually helped in the kitchen. And they cleaned the ship. Whatever became of them\nI don\u2019t know. But they were going up and back (inaudible). so this was (fortune?) .\nBut then when we landed in Albania, the port, my father said well where do we go now. You are\nthe decision maker, tell me. Where do you want us to go. And I didn\u2019t know, but then as I\nwalked down the plank, I saw two men who were obviously Austrian refugees. From the\nclothing were there. And they recognized us and they welcomed us. And said one thing you may\nbe sure. You\u2019ve come to a very friendly country. And they were. And I was then you know I\nwas the only girl because all the other, there was one German couple. Her husband was a senior\nengineer, had been a senior engineer in a German factory. So she insisted when anybody wanted\nto talk to her, you had to say Frau Ober Engineer. We were all, had no money, nothing. All\nstated but we had to leave Frau Ober Engineer. And this and that\u2019s where I stole money and stole\nbread. And I was hungry. Because you know we had, it was a very orthodox church rule there.\nAnd I now saw the first Jewish wedding. There was a couple in their 30s from Germany who\nwere married under German rule, but not under the Jewish religion. And they wanted to go to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nwhat still is Palestine. And they had to have a Jewish wedding certificate. So we had a proper\nJewish wedding. I mean it was fantastic to see the bride with the handkerchief .",
        "A: No we didn\u2019t have a camera. No, well I didn\u2019t have a camera. This is now, didn\u2019t have a\ncamera then.",
        "A: Well the photographers of the wedding and in Budapest of King Zog. King Zog married a\nHungarian aristocratic young woman. Her mother was Hungarian aristocracy. And her father I\nthink was an American. And I don\u2019t know how she got, when she got them. They told them. So\nthey told us we are welcome here and so we were. And now you see the grandson regards me as\nhis grandmother and he said you haven\u2019t seen a photo. He\u2019s a very nice young man. Imperial\nthat he sends me. Because I told him I felt I owe my life to Albania. Because when I went round\nas I told you to all the consulates asking for visas, none was prepared. But Albania, the counsel\nsaid, I mean when they received me and all the uncles were. They put the door in my face when\nI showed the guard \u2014",
        "A: The British, the Norwegian, the Swedish, the Danish. All the countries where one would\nhave thought they would have some empathy.",
        "A: Yeah, no. So because by that time they were all we had to let (inaudible) the passport.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yugoslavs were slowing as well. And they said unless we can leave to another country and\nthey will have us, they will send us back.",
        "A: In, just after the Kristallnacht. On the 20\u201c of November. On my Otto\u2019s birthday.",
        "A: Yeah. So in 30 but the British then Otto then worked to try and, he got a visa for Kurt. Kurt\nwas also in England. But then to get us not in time to get the British visa so that we could get\nhere before England really opened up. Because England, only Churchill who realized because\nwhat was his name, Chamberlain who went to Germany and came back waving the peace treaty.",
        "A: Yeah so. Then they were prepared to have unskilled female labor.",
        "A: In England.",
        "A: No that was beginning February 1939.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: Until there were, until birthday. No we were three days before \u2014",
        "A: Well [ll tell you what I did. When I got there even the Greek Orthodox and even the\nChristian women would all go around veiled and would not go in the street, except prostitutes.\nOther women would not go in the street without a chaperone, a male chaperone. So there was I\ncoming with socks, short dresses. I mean my school uniform and what I used to wear in school.\nAnd there was a girl. And you see the richer Albanians sent their children into boarding school\nfor education to Italy. So then they came back so there was a group of young Albanians who\nreally didn\u2019t have to work. They didn\u2019t have to do anything to get money.\nAnd they really didn\u2019t know. They were bored stiff and when they saw me they came and they\nsurrounded me and I didn\u2019t know Albanian. They talked Albanian and I didn\u2019t know Italian or\nany and, andI felt scared and they touched my shoulder and then I said in French, I could do\ncolloquial in French. And they spoke French and I said what are you doing? What do you think?\nAnd they said well are you a real girl. I said I\u2019m a girl. I know that you know why am I? So then\nthey said well women don\u2019t go like you so I then said well I come from a different culture. And\nthere was a famous actor, an Albanian called Moishe. They knew him, who was very famous. I\nknew of him. He played in drama performances in Vienna. And he was very good and had a big\nreputation.\nSo they asked me did I know him and I said yes, I know of him. So I then, they wanted to know\nfor them it was sort of Austrian in general, and Vienna in particular were sort of the center of\nsophistication and education. It was, they built up Vienna in like a dream setting. Not the way I\nremembered it.",
        "A: No, no.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: French. So then one of them who was called Dowana he said well his father had died just\nbefore I arrived in Durr\u00e9s. And he had two younger sisters that were in boarding school. But the\nmother now, since the father has just died, doesn\u2019t want to send them back. Would I be prepared\nto teach them German, French and mathematics so that they would have some edu. So I said yes.\nI said well how old are they? Well I was then 16. Going on for 17 and they were 14 and 15. So\nthat I wasn\u2019t much older than them. But I wasn\u2019t going to miss out on that. So he then took me to\nhis home which was right opposite the sea, opposite the harbor. It was lovely and they had like\nthe Muslims, the women live in purdah. You know there\u2019s women, there\u2019s a female section of\nthe quarter, living quarters and the male one. And so obviously the girls were in the female one.\nAnd I fitted into this. So I remember I was really very cheeky. I did, I mean I knew French. I\nhad done colloquial French, but I wasn\u2019t perfect, by any means. And there are many things that I\ndidn\u2019t know the French for.\nWell I was teaching it. Well how do you teach a language to others when you have no language\nin common. If you and I know English and I want to teach you Albanian, well I can tell you the\nEnglish words and learn like I said. But if, if we don\u2019t have a common language it is very\ndifficult. So what I then did was to point this little chair and I would say the English, the French\nand the German word, if I knew the French. The German I would know. And they would write it\ndown. And the next day I would say what is this? And I\u2019d expect them to know. Well sometimes\nthey asked me for the French word and I had no idea. So you know what I did. I invented French\nwords. But I said the words so quickly that they couldn\u2019t write them down. So the next day then I\nwent back and I had a dictionary all right. I knew the word. Next day I would say well what is\nthis, French, German. You know it in German, yes, you know it in French. Now we have. Well\nwrite it down now properly.\nNow I have been trying to find the heirs of this Dowana family. Because they were wonderful\nto me. The women of the house, their mothers and aunts and all the relatives that were there, they\nwere all very nice to me. First of all they always served me with coffee, Turkish coffee and\nbiscuits which was great really for me. And secondly, from their house, their house was a lovely\nbig house right opposite the port. I sat there with looking out well obviously this is a chair. And\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nI would look out at the port. And I always loved the sea, and I told you. I told my mother I was\nborn at the sea.\nSo and they were all so nice to me and I had a nice environment and I had regularly something to\ndo and they paid me there. But I was the only refugee that they all saw",
        "A: Well that\u2019s where the Joint came in. These two men that met us, told, first of all they said,\nthey took us to a hotel which was the dirtiest and filthiest place. I mean this was for my parents\nyou know we had to say go and have a bottle of eau de cordel [ph] which we had to the loo. I\nmean it was, and the linens were dirty. And it was really awful. But these two men had said you\nmust just stay there for a week because we will look at your credentials. But if you pass, which\nwe think you will, you can then move, because what they had done, the Joint, there were some\nJewish shops around. And there were also Jewish salesmen from Salonika, selling to these\nJewish shop keepers. And the Joint was sending money. However many refugees turned up and\nlived because they had rented a house next to the police station. And they got, and the shop\nkeeper that got the money from the Joint always had to get a piece of paper from the board of\nguardians. These were elderly Polish or Austrian Jews and to send it to the Joint that they would\nalways continue sending.\nIt was very, very little. I mean really as a growing girl I was starving. And I, and there was a\nlarder which was always locked and once they had forgotten to lock it. And I saw it open and I\nsneaked in and I got a big piece of bread and I was delighted. But next day I was hauled before\nthe board of guardians. That you don\u2019t do and my father burst into tears. You know his little girl.\nHe couldn\u2019t supply enough food that. I mean it was natural, but I didn\u2019t feel terribly guilty. I was\nangry. There was bread. Why shouldn\u2019t I?",
        "A: Well when we got there, there were about 35.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: Well now you see after we left, then Otto got visas.",
        "A: We left but wait a moment. He got me one as a hairdresser apprentice and my mother as a\ndomestic. Well we weren\u2019t terribly delighted but better going to England was good. So but not\nfor my father. So we tried to delay leaving him because he was really suicidal. He would go\nalong the shore and was ready to jump in. And you know it was very difficult. So we felt that\nmy mother didn\u2019t want to leave her husband and I didn\u2019t want to leave my father. But Otto kept\nextending our visas, but then he sent me a letter and he said listen, unless you arrive before the\nend of April, 1939, in England I cannot extend them. You will never be able to come here. So\nyou better come with mother and he said I promise you and mother, you talk with mother and tell\nher he will do anything just to get a visa. And he did. My father came a week before the war\nstarted.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. The Italian counsel heard that I was teaching German because these were elite\nfamilies and I guess there were evening dinners and they must obviously have been together with\nthe local elite.",
        "A: Yeah so and he was a very nice guy and he said, they told him you know that I was teaching\ntheir daughters. So he said tell her I want to see her and so they told me and I went. Ad he then\ntold me that he wanted me to, he wanted to learn German because Mussolini and Hitler were in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nItaly and it was when they were together, Germany. I mean Mussolini was Hitler\u2019s role model.\nHe really, he wasn\u2019t anti-Semitic at first, for a long time but in terms of his \u2014 you know that\nMussolini invented the term fascisma [ph]. So you know he was the role model. So this counsel\nthought it would help him in his career to know German. And so I started teaching him. And I\nthink you must remember this out of my autobiography. Then we were still there when Mussolini\noccupied Albania. And this counsel became the first governor of the coastal region.\nSo the war, the Jewish \u2014 we thought that Mussolini would hand us refugees like a present over to\nHitler. Because it seemed obvious. We were the only thing that Mussolini got out of Albania.\nThat Hitler may want. So we were all terribly -- I mean they were just everybody. We were\nsitting in a cellar when the fighting was going on. And what was really moving was the next door\npolicemen were worried because they told us. I mean you could see the big warships on the\nhorizon. It was a port and Italy had big ships. The only ship that Albania had was the private\nyacht of King Zog. I mean that couldn\u2019t defend. And the policemen told us all they have to\ndefend Durr\u00e9s against the Italian onslaught is three machine guns. And there, the roof of their\npolice station was flat. And one of these three machine guns was standing there. They told us\nthat. And they said well when the Italians will come ashore we will have to shoot. That\u2019s our\njob. And the Italians will want to knock out these three machine guns. And if they fail, if they\nmiss, then they will kill you. And we don\u2019t want that. And we thought, we sat together. And we\nthought we would, Hitler would throw us out and treated us like nothing. And here were these\nlittle policemen worried about our life. It was really very moving. And I tell them that now too\nso they then said well tonight they told us, the onslaught was coming. They would come ashore.\nSo first of all you have to find a house with a cellar because not many houses had cellars. Only\nthe richest. And the richest had gone inland, the Albanian. But they left their servants to take care\nof their \u2014 but we you know we went in and we checked that they have a cellar. The servants\nwanted to stop us or they weren\u2019t too strong, strong enough to do that. So we found a house not\ntoo far from where our house was.\nBut before this I must tell you, there were Salonika salesmen, Jewish salesmen selling goods.\nAnd well one of them was called Major. Very nice. He was 45 years old. For me he was like he\nhad two feet in the grave because you know when you\u2019re 16, 17, 45 seems \u2014 but he fell in love\nwith me. You must think everybody fell into, that was my life. And so he asked my father for\ngive information so that he could marry me. At first he had asked me and I said I don\u2019t want to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nmarry anybody. And then he asked my father and my father said no, she was far too young. But\nhe, then he also came to see -- but he had money. So he was always getting me presents and I\ndidn\u2019t want them because I thought that make me dependent. And anyway when it comes then a\nlittle story and a little lie. So we stayed in the cellar during the onslaught and we heard the\nshooting. And they then said we, our guardians had a meeting. And said let\u2019s surrender. Let\u2019s\nnot be sort of taken, but let\u2019s surrender. Let\u2019s say we know we are going to go to the next\nconcentration camp, but let\u2019s do it with our heads up. Let\u2019s show them that we have courage.\nSo ok. So they said well then the shooting stopped and so they said well now we will go and\nsomebody who has, who can speak Italian must lead us. Well who could do that? I was the only\none. In teaching German and French I picked up, I\u2019m not fluent but I picked up. So they gave me\na stick and a white handkerchief for army and I should lead. So I led and I was trying to say in\nItalian, as best as I could. We are a group of German and Austrian Jewish refugees and I kept\nrepeating this in my mind as we were walking along. And we must have been a really crazy lot,\nlooking, you know these old men and women were shuffling along and wearing different kind of\nclothing.\nAnyway, and then came three Italians, one an officer with two guys from around the corner and\nsaw us. And shouted halt. So I said stop. So we stopped. And then as I had expected, he came\nup to me and said who are you? And so and he did. So I then said in my, in the sentences I had\nrehearsed. I said we are a group of German and Austrian -- and he didn\u2019t let me go any further. I\ndidn\u2019t get, have to say Jewish refugees. He put his arm around my shoulder and said Tedesk1,\nGerman. Italian, friends, amigo,. amigo. I didn\u2019t disillusion him. And so in a sense that was\nanother saving. So then he put his two soldiers in charge of walking. He said where do you live?\nAnd I said over there. I didn\u2019t say that was the police station. And so he walked us back. But on\nthe way back I thought well if they look through our rooms and if the police had wanted to hide\ntheir guns, then they might have put some into our rooms and if these Italian soldiers find them\nthen the friendship will be off.\nBut they didn\u2019t. They let us go. They looked through them but the soldiers said the police\nhadn\u2019t hidden anything. But then I heard somebody knock at the back, where we had the window\nlooking out at the wasteland and there was a guy standing in Albanian uniform because they had\na very small unit of soldiers. And he made me understand that he wants clothing. He wants to get\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nrid of his uniform. So I gave him one pajama of my father. And he stuck, changed there and this\nwas my contribution to the freedom fight of Albania.\nBut then the next day the, who was then the governor, the Italian ex Italian counsel, his car came\nto our residence and a uniformed driver, chauffeur had a letter And he had, the guardians went\nto the door. And it was addressed to me. So they were all excited. Says now we mean, we are\nbeing sent to the concentration camp. And I opened it and it said now I need you even more and\nhe sent me a letter with so many stamps and he sent every day his car, was picking me up and\nthere are so many guard posts on the way because they had just occupied Albania. I actually\nwent last July when I made this film because King Zog\u2019s car was at the top of the hill and of\ncourse King Zog had fled. So this new governor of the city had moved into King Zog\u2019s castle.\nSo we went, I got in touch with the grandson and I said well they want to film it. So they\nallowed us in because there weren\u2019t many people. So this is and then I have to -- and then my\nGreek boyfriend said, and he knew we had the -- among the young lot who were my sort of I was\nthe pied piper and they followed me was a travel agent. Because I had gone, since we had the\nvisas for England, I went to the French ambassador and said can I fly because Air France was the\nonly airline that would fly from Albania to Paris, fuel, stop there for refuel and then go on to\nLondon. So that\u2019s the plane that I thought we were taking. But they told me I should go to the\nFrench ambassador to make sure and do you know they were bastards. We would have, my\nmother and I would have just stayed the 20 minutes that it would have taken them to refuel. But\nthey did not. And they said we do not want refugees in our country. At a later date they may have\nhad different stories.\nSo then among this lot of young men, was one travel agent. So I asked him. I said well how can\nI get from here because I can\u2019t go by train. I have to go you know flying there. I can\u2019t fly. So\nhow do I get there. So he then said there is one cargo ship that goes from Naples to\nSouthampton and if you board that, there was one coming that would get you to Southampton on\nthe 25\" of April. So that was all right. So and we paid him and the Joint sent money for our\nfriend. I had one. But this Salonika guy said my dear I want to give you 500 pound. I want to do\nit. And I thought no, I\u2019m not being bought for 500 pounds and said no I don\u2019t. He then said well\nlook don\u2019t be so silly. I'll give you the 500 and you take it. If you do not need them. If you don\u2019t\nhave to use them I\u2019ll give you my, the details of my bank account in London and you pay the 500\npounds into that bank. And that is what I did.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nBut I am sure because all the Salonika Jews went into Auschwitz and it was this, he was the\ngeneral secretary of the you know, the Austrian . He was then the officer for the German army.\nAnd they occupied Salonika and ordered them all out. So I\u2019m sure that this, not only he had an\naccount that I know because, but I can kill myself for not writing it down. Because I am sure\nthere is a lot of Salonika money invested in the British and American banks. But no, I mean the\nheirs. This guy was not married. I don\u2019t know how many were married, how many had children.\nBut the second generation wouldn\u2019t know the details . So why don\u2019t the American Jewish -- \u2019m\ntrying here the Jewish community, why don\u2019t they sort of write to the \u2014 they said I should do it.\nWell I can\u2019t do it. But a Jewish community representative can say you know the Swiss banks.\nThe American and Britain have really been very tough and gotten a lot of money out of it. But\nthey themselves have never said we also have some money. And they must have it.\nBecause you know the rich Jews in Europe and particularly a country like Greece, Salonika will\nhave invested, will have bank accounts here. So the Swiss had to pay up. Why don\u2019t they, why\ndon\u2019t the British. Or the American money. But no, nobody wants to take that on.",
        "A: Well that\u2019s what you want. So my brother said I must be arriving with my mother before the\nend of April so this travel agent in Durr\u00e9s gave me a voucher. I paid with part of the Joint money\nfor the journey and I had a voucher for two cabin, for two people to have a cabin on this cargo\nship that was supposed to arrive in Naples about 25, about in the first week of April. So off we\nwent. And my mother, Otto had said you must come because if you do not arrive in England,\nbefore the end of April you won\u2019t be able, whatever it is. So I wrote (inaudible) for him to do.\nSo I took my mother. We were crying a lot and she, you know it\u2019s very sad really if you leave by\nship because the land gets smaller and smaller as you depart. You know air flight is quick.",
        "A: Yes I do, but not if you leave somebody behind who you would like to have with you. And\nmy father was getting smaller and smaller.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: Yeah, it was on that day. But most of them were hidden during the war. For most of them\nyou can see it. You want to see the rescue in Albania. Most of them were hidden. And there is\nactually one who married an American. She is called Joanna Newman with whom I am in touch.\nShe said, I can\u2019t remember. She said that she arrived with her parents also from Yugoslavia.\nThey were from Germany, but then they made it to Yugoslavia and from Yugoslavia they were\nthrown out and they came to Durr\u00e9s. But I had, I must admit I have no recollection. But that\ndoesn\u2019t mean that, she was obviously there. And in that film you can see her in fact. She seems a\nvery nice lady.\nAnd now I\u2019m on the Albania Mafia and so because there is a lady in New York who 1s called,\nshe is a dentist, a doctor, Anna Cohen and she now also wants me to come and tell my story to\nher American Jewish lot and we are on very friendly terms but I have never met her. So I now\nknow quite a lot of them. And they all, she you can see her on that film. She was born in Albania\nduring the war and her mother was saved because they also -- what she has been doing for\nAlbania is when there are youngsters who have been diagnosed with a disease for which they\ndon\u2019t have any treatment in Albania. There are quite a lot of such individuals. That she will\narrange, she will get the medical report. And if she knows, she will then establish whether if they\nare in New York they can get the treatment that will make them well again. She gets money,\nshe\u2019s got money in her fund. She pays for them. They fly to New York. She arranges their\ntreatment. Once they are well again, back they go. So also during the war. She also feels in a\nsense she was born there. And if the Albanians hadn\u2019t saved her mother, she wouldn\u2019t be there\neither.",
        "A: So in Naples we stayed for the first, and while we were in Albania the men made the furniture\nout of orange boxes. My father made beds. We slept on hearths or in boxes or cupboards and but\nthe Joint money helped us to stay in a hotel. Not a posh one but so I left my mother in the hotel.\nFor her this was, she was still broken hearted, having had to leave my father. But she felt for the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nfirst time she was sleeping in a bed. We were both there. And I said you stay here. I\u2019Il go and get\nour tickets for the cargo ship. So I had the voucher and I went to this address. I found it and I\nproduced my voucher. And they said oh it\u2019s a pity. What date do you have to be in England? I\nsaid end of April. They said well this ship is two months delayed.\nYou know I tell this story always to the kids and when I will say that. It\u2019s oh. When you feel you\n\u2014there\u2019s nothing. And I didn\u2019t know a soul. I mean how was I to know? And I knew my mother,\nif I tell her she wouldn\u2019t say really that\u2019s it. So I went outside and had a good cry for myself.\nAnd then I said well then I said I must let me Otto know what the problem is. Because I realized\nI mean if we can\u2019t get to England then he can\u2019t do anything but at least he would know what\nhappened.\nBut then I looked up and you know this Italian travel agency, cit, C-I-T is still was then still\nworking. And it still, you can still see Cit Italian. So I looked up and there was Cit, so I said well\nmaybe this is a sign. So I went in with our passports. And I said I need a flight to London from\nhere. Can it? And he said no problem. He said have you got the money to pay. I mean I was a\nyoung one and I got out, I had money. Dollars so, it was safe. So he said no problem at all and\nso he rang Air France. And he said well the passports I wouldn\u2019t be (inaudible). No. We won\u2019t\ntell them. Well he rang other airlines, but of course the planes needed and couldn\u2019t fly such long\ndistances. Everyone had to refuel on the way. So we had a tough time. But the only airline that\nwould take us was KLM. But KLM was, we were boarding and we had to go by train from\nNaples to Milan.\nAnd in Milan at the airport we could get onto the KLM flight. And the KLM flight went,\nCologne, Frankfurt, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, London.\nSo I knew so that is when I wrote a letter. I mean in a sense like Horst Teers mother when she\nwas on the train to Auschwitz, writing her last letter. I wrote a letter to Otto and I said we were\non a flight, KLM. We are supposed to arrive in London but if we can\u2019t get through Germany,\nthen you know where we to look. But that\u2019s all I could say and I gave him the time we were due.\nBut then I said well how do I get it to him. So I went to talk to the KLM steward and that he is\nanother one who had saved my life. Because really when you come and see you know taken\nevery step, it was really true. Somebody turned up that helped. Because I said you know I said\nyou know we are Jewish refugees. You can see our passport and I said do we have to get out\nwhen we dock at German ports. They said yes, the Germans don\u2019t allow anybody to remain on\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nthe plane. So first stop was Cologne and I said to mother and as we landed we saw all those\nswastika flags and all those SS young men and SA brown u \u2014 I mean it was really, you know it\nbrought back all we had seen in Vienna. We thought we got out. And my mother was terrified so\nI said listen. We\u2019ll walk straight and we will show we are not scared. So we all had to go through\nimmigration so when I showed our passport, he said (German) you know what are the\nrequirement, (inaudible) have to do. So I said no, we\u2019re not returning to your country. I said\nyou can see we have an English visa and that\u2019s what our tickets say and that\u2019s where we are\ngoing. So he said ok and thankful. And we sat down but then when we got to Cologne, we all\nhad to get out of there. And the airport was full of people from passengers from all over the\nworld. And they announced over the loudspeaker Frau Und [ph] report. So I then thought well\ncouldn\u2019t we disappear in this , how would they find, but then I realized with our passports\nbecause everybody had to fill out so then that\u2019s when the worst (inaudible) in my life. Because\ntwo Nazi bitches, really you can\u2019t use any other term. They were in the female SA, SS uniforms,\nblack skirts black, jackets, swastika and they took us into a small room and then said now strip.\nStrip? I felt you know I couldn\u2019t say, but what they were after was what we were smuggling.\nThey went through every seam in our you know skirts and I mean I can\u2019t describe and then they\nwere beating us and my mother collapsed and I had to pick her up and they would then say stop\nhelping this cow of a Jew. And I mean it just, I don\u2019t want to remember that.\nBut then fortunately I had this letter. I had forgotten that I had it in one of the pockets in my\njacket. The letter from this, what used to be the Italian cultural and it was in the government,\nwith all these stamps and the letter said that you know Miss senorina, senorina Trude, it was all\nin Italian is a friend of the governor of the coastal area of Albania and should be allowed to pass\nbecause that was for their know. And when they saw this one of them said, what\u2019s this. And I\nsaid, I then so again I must say when I think my daughters or my granddaughters wouldn\u2019t have\nbut they hadn\u2019t been through everything that I had. I said that\u2019s the only thing that we\u2019ll say.\nSo I said don\u2019t you understand Italian. And they said no. I said well then you\u2019re very stupid and I\ngot a big beating but then she said well what does it say? So I then said but I read out something\nwhich wasn\u2019t there at all. I said and I know the governor. I know that they are on the flight to\nLondon and that senorina Trude Grunewald will let me know when she arrives. And if I don\u2019t\u2019\nhear I will check up on her. I made that up on the spur of the moment. And she said you\u2019re lying\nand I said is there nobody. I said everybody like you who doesn\u2019t understand. Tell him tell me.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nit should be in Italian. Italy is your friend. So what are you talking? I got a lot of bashing, but I\ndon\u2019t \u2014 so one of them said to the other, look after these two Jews. And she went out and she\ncame back and she obviously had found somebody who had read this and understood that it was\nthe Governor of Italian governor of the coastline of Albania.\nSo she said get dressed and so we were bleeding and we were not in a fit state. And my mother\ncertainly wasn\u2019t so when I helped her to dress, they stopped me from helping her and it was\nterrible. And then we were dressed and they said now you can go back on your plane. So I said\nour passports because they had them on the (inaudible). They said you have no right. You can\ncall yourself very lucky that we let you go so don\u2019t ask for anything. If I were you two. So we\nsort of go, went very slowly and trying to get back to the plane and the steward that I had given\nthe letter was standing, of course there were steps up to the door. And he was standing at the\ndoor, sort of waving, being very happy to see us. But then I sort of shook my head so he came\ndown the steps and said what\u2019s up. So and I said yes, we can go back to our plane but we don\u2019t\nhave passports and if we don\u2019t have passports I know we will never get in for England. So he\nsaid leave it to me and he went and he retrieved our -- so you know I felt like kissing him. But\nfoolishly I never tried to get his name. To say thank you because if he hadn\u2019t got our passports\nwe wouldn\u2019t be here now.\nSo there are so many people who all the way have done a good job and have really been helpful.",
        "A: What I would say to people who have had similar experiences?",
        "A: Well the most important lesson was I actually at this German airport that if I can survive that\nthen I now feel I can survive anything which is foolish because eventually we all are doomed to\ndie but I don\u2019t feel that I\u2019m ready for it because I feel I have so much to do. That I can\u2019t give up\nnow.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: Well then when we, when my father, Otto rang up because he was sort of courting this elderly\nspinster who was responsible. I forget her name but I\u2019ve seen the photograph. He showed me her\nphotograph and so my father was also there. So the immediate family were also there. But then\nit was during the war. When the first messages came out when the Red Cross had names.",
        "A: Well after the Evian, when America, when Hitler wanted to sell his Jews, but America\nwouldn\u2019t, wasn\u2019t prepared \u2014",
        "A: So then came the first news because then was actually the time when this final Solution. And\nI mean how people can say that this is an imagination of the Jews, when the Germans were so\nsystematic, record keepers and you can find out who went on what day into the gas chamber.",
        "A: Yeah. Because we, the first list came. And my father was after his relatives and my mother\nbut they weren\u2019t on that list. But that was about may have been in 1943, in 44.",
        "A: They reported, the Red Cross in autumn that Hit, that the Nazis had tried people killing with,\nby gas on people who were in lunatic asylums, right. That\u2019s when they experimented. When they\nsaw it work, they fairly well you can. You see the thing was which newspapers then reported\nhere that a lot of the German army had nervous breakdowns because they made the young\nchildren, women undress, dig a hole and then they shot them into it. This is what they had to do.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011\nWell you know you had to have a very strong c, you know conviction that this is what you need\nto do and what you should do. But normal people, I mean they weren\u2019t enough resisting but it\nmade them have nervous breakdowns. And it was that, that got the notice then to apply this to\nnot shoot, that these soldiers don\u2019t have to shoot. By gas you just put them in and say you go and\nhave a shower and they come out as bodies.",
        "A: Yes, I remember because there was Richard Dimbleby was a British, his sons were also now\njournalists. He was with the British forces who liberated Belsen and they found, actually every\nHolocaust memorial there, they showed those pictures. Frightening.",
        "A: The first time when you saw this, I mean just. You couldn\u2019t even watch it. I mean and you\ncouldn\u2019t imagine that your own grandmother, your own uncles and aunts and cousins would all\nhave gone through this.",
        "A: How did we find out about that. Uncle Willie found my mother. He was, actually ask Paul\nbecause he was with him. I can\u2019t remember what, how we got together but we \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes we knew that he \u2014 they had sailed to India first. And then so that much I know.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",
        "A: But finally I must tell you that this Dowana family where I was teaching, these two young\ngirls. Now this young man that was their brother and who arranged this teaching, while during\nthe Communist period in Albania he was obviously a very rich man and they actually I can show\nyou this. If you\u2019ve seen my diary, I\u2019ve got a certificate from the Dowana family which 1s dated, I\ncan show you that, November or December 1940. Saying how much they enjoyed and\nappreciated that I taught these two sisters, these two young girls and that they are very sorry that\nI had to leave.\nSo I\u2019ve since then wanted for this film, as you heard me say, you know I\u2019m a Jewish refugee. Do\nyou know about anything? And I couldn\u2019t find \u2014 when I was making this film in Albania, one of\nthe \u2014 I thought well one of, they must also be in their 80s but they would have been married and\nthey would have children. So I thought there must be some heir that will remember so I went\naround the dock and do you remember the Dowana. No, no, no. so and you heard then, then Rick\nsays well because it\u2019s 72 years since. But now this young Dowana was then got married. The\nbrother of those two girls I taught. And they had children who then, but then when the\ncommunists came in, he was put into jail and he then died.\nBut there is now a grand, his granddaughter, a young Dowana, they went to America to Florida.\nAnd she is now an American citizen. And I\u2019ve now found her. I\u2019ve been looking for her and\nthrough the Albanian embassy, where there is one young woman whose parents live in Durr\u00e9s\nand they are so keen on helping me find my outcome. So she wrote to her parents and she found\nthat this young woman, she\u2019s lovely. She now works for the American embassy in Tirana. But\nshe now has a lot of property because after the communists went out, now they, everybody who\nhad property can reclaim them. So the house in which I was sitting and watching the port, the\ndevelopers got it and so she got some money from that. But they knocked it down and put a -- I\ndon\u2019t know about seven or eight floors apartment building where there are shops. And she said\nyou must come and stay with me. I have three such (boards?) and she is just, I mean she drove\nme everywhere and she calls me Grandma and I mean I can have everything.\nShe gave me when I left, you know in Albania they make specially strong brandy. It\u2019s called\nDraki. She gave me a large, bottle. Would you like a little brandy.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 17, 2011",

Professor Epstein, thank\nyou very much for accepting to give this interview. Tell us a little bit about your family. Where\nwere you born, when, siblings, parents.\nGertrude Scarlett Epstein: Ok. Well I was born on the 13\" of July 1922 which makes me ninety\nyears old next, next July and my parents had two sons already. So I was the apple of my father\u2019s\neye because he always wanted a daughter and there I was. So I couldn\u2019t do wrong. But he came\nfrom what was then when he was born, Moravia, in Czechoslovakia. And his great grandfather\nwas actually an illegitimate child because that was during the period of Queen Theresa who ruled\nand very anti-Semitically the Austrian empire. And she introduced a law under her rule, they\nwere always introduced rather, that a certain number of Jewish weddings took, could take place.\nBut once that number had been achieved no more Jews could get married. Well my patrilineal\nancestors wanted to get married so 1n a sense my grandfather was an illegitimate child. And I\nguess if you want to go down the generations we\u2019re all successive generations, we\u2019re all\nillegitimate. And he was Jewish. But they were not Orthodox. And but they came actually from\na place, he was born and grew up in a place, my father, in Boscowice which is near Brno. And\nBoscowice has the oldest Jewish cemetery in the whole of that part of Europe. So it must have\nhad quite a large Jewish community. And there was \u2014"
