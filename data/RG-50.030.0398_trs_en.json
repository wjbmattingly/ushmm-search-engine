        "Q: Good morning, Amy.",
        "A: Good morning.",
        "Q: Nice to have you in Washington.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: Can you please tell us your full name? Your name at birth, and your name now, and when\nyou were born, and where?",
        "A: I was born Amy Zahl, that\u2019s Z-a-h-l, in London. I was born in 1919 on Holy Innocence\nDay, December the 28\".",
        "Q: What is Holy Innocence Day?",
        "A: December the 28\".",
        "Q: Does it mean something?",
        "A: In the Christian church it does.",
        "Q: Can you tell us what it means?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Oh, you don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Sorry.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a bit about your childhood and your parents and your siblings if you have\nany?",
        "A: Oh, yes. I was born into a family of two sisters and four brothers. Two of the brothers\nand one sister were half-brothers. They were children of a first husband of my mother\u2019s.\nMy parents were originally from Lithuania, as was my mother\u2019s first husband. In fact, I\nstill possess her Ketuba from Lithuania, and her permit to travel in the pale (ph) of\nRussia, and she came as immigrant as many people did at the time of the turn of the\ncentury when everybody seemed to be leaving for the United States, and she was one of\nthose immigrants that got stuck in Britain. As you probably know, almost all of them \u2014\nparticularly the Jews \u2014 intended to come to America where the streets were supposed to\nbe lined with gold, but my mother got left behind, and eventually met my father who\nmarried her, and I grew up in this large family as the youngest child, and it was rather\nnice.",
        "Q: What was your mother\u2019s name and your dad\u2019s name?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Kravitz, which 1s, I think, is a common name. She was married \u2014\nher first marriage was to a cousin. She was an orphan, according to what she told me \u2014\nI\u2019m sure she spoke the truth \u2014 and was married to a cousin, and the grandfather \u2014 her\ngrandfather who brought her up \u2014 felt 1t was important for her, also, to leave. I think she\nloved Lithuania and would\u2019ve liked to have stayed. You know, this story that people tell\nof pogroms are not always true. A lot of them left for economic reasons, just as\neverybody else left Europe for economic reasons.",
        "Q: And your dad?",
        "A: My father came from Russia, I think from Minsk, he told me. Some of his family went to\nHarbin in China, and eventually ended up in the United States, and they live in New\nYork. One of their sons has gone to Israel. My mother\u2019s relatives came to \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nif it\u2019s the midwest \u2014 they came to Ohio, and I know that as a child, they used to write me\nand send me dollars for candy, but I never met them, and I think, as happened in other\nfamilies, correspondence was sparse and eventually contact was lost.",
        "Q: And What was your father\u2019s name?",
        "A: My father was Nathan Zahl, Z-a-h-l. He had relatives in England who were on the stage,\nand they were in theater, and they were nice family.",
        "Q: So, what was it like growing up in this family with all these children?",
        "A: Well, they weren\u2019t children to me. They were all adults. I was a child growing up in a\nfamily of adults, and since ostensibly I was a weak child, I was always being sent away to\nrecuperate. So, I didn\u2019t grow up close to this family, close emotionally to this family. I\ndid to my eldest sister, who is really a half-sister, but I was very much, I think, a lone\nchild because everybody else was older than I. The next one in the family was five years\nolder than I.",
        "Q: And are there any particular characteristics of this family? Were you religious in the\nfamily? Not religious?",
        "A: We were not religious. My father was, I would say, a-religious.\n[Technical difficulty; asked to start over preceding part]",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sorry. From where?",
        "Q: Well, tell me about your family and in terms of are you a religious family? Were you not\na religious family?",
        "A: We were not a religious family in the sense we didn\u2019t attend synagogue. My father did\ntake me to the synagogue on all the holidays. He explained to me what was going on, but\nhe was not a religious man. The nice thing I remember about being Jewish, I suppose,\nwas the wonderful Friday evenings when we all gathered together, and on the holidays\nwhen friends would also come, and for the Passover when they would invite people who\ndidn\u2019t have family. My mother was a very generous, warm, and kind person, and she was\nalways inviting people into the house. She was very forward-looking, I think. I hope, that\nI have some of her characteristics.",
        "Q: What kind of political consciousness was there? You grew up at a time when there was a\nlot of upheaval in western Europe. Were you very conscious of it as you grew up in the\nlate \u201920s, in the early \u201930s in terms of what was going on in Germany?",
        "A: In the late \u201820s, I would say no. In England, we had, as you had, a tremendous\ndepression, economic depression. There was a lot of employment even \u2014 not even, but in\nmy family, too. I began to be aware that things were happening in Germany when I was\n14 or 15, a settlement house, of which I was member, began to have youngsters from\nGermany come to learn English, to help pass the time. They were builted (ph) locally,\nand I got to know some of them and felt awful that they had been sent to Britain, let\u2019s say\nin \u00b035-\u201936, without their parents \u2014 to a foreign country where most of them had no\nrelatives, and I felt very deeply about this. I think this is what affected me when\neventually the British asked for volunteers to go overseas. I felt 1t was important that I\nmust go.",
        "Q: Could you please explain what a settlement house is?",
        "A: A settlement house \u2014 we had them also in the United States \u2014 A settlement house is a\ncommunity center run usually by a voluntary agency, where youngsters and older people\ncome. They have classes, educational classes, classes for mothers, in the old days, I\nsuppose, they had classes teaching people English. It\u2019s a real community center.",
        "Q: So, tell me what these kids told you. I mean, I know you were conscious that they were\norphans \u2014 not orphans, but they were without their parents, without their family. Did they\ntell you about what had happened in Germany?",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t. They just \u2014 they didn\u2019t talk about it. One didn\u2019t ask. Firstly, being\nBritish, you\u2019re rather reticent, anyway, but one had a sense that these kids were alone,\nterribly alone. There was no family. There were no cousins. Occasionally, one would\nhave an aunt in the country, and that would be rather nice because she had family to\nrelate to, but in the 30s, many German parents \u2014 rather, not many, but a number of\nGerman parents who could afford it were sending their children to school in England\nbecause German law prohibited them from attending school. Very early on in, I think,\n1933, the first law came in which limited the number of Jewish children who could attend\nschool. And so, a number of them came to England to school, and they were taken in by\nfamilies. There was an organization called B\u2019nai B\u2019rith, which still exists, and they\nhelped a lot of these children, particularly the Orthodox Jewish children.",
        "Q: So, at what point do you think \u2014 was it after the war, or in 1939 that you became very\nconscious of what was happening? What drew you in 1943 to join the relief effort?",
        "A: Well, firstly the war came in \u201939. I remember we had the bombing in London, and 90\ndays of bombing constantly is not very pleasant.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: That was pretty awful. Very often, I would be scared and I\u2019d sit under a table, or I would\nlike people to think that I was brave and so I took tea to the shelters wearing my tin hat\nuntil I was going out one day with a young friend, and a piece of shrapnel went through\nhis tin hat, and he was no longer. It was frightening and yet, you didn\u2019t like to appear a\ncoward. We did things that we would never do. We went into the streets and put out\nincendiary bombs because, since the government, I suppose, wanted to know how many\nincendiaries had been dropped, they would pay us a half a crown which was about half a\ndollar in those days, to bring in the ends of incendiary bombs. So, we\u2019d go out and we\u2019d\npick these things up once the bomb had gone off. And, yet, we used to sit on the doorstep\noccasionally in an air raid, and say, \u201cWhat will we tell our children of the war?\u201d And, you\nknow, we were eating peanuts and we\u2019d say, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll tell them that we sat on the\ndoorstep eating peanuts.\u201d But, it was an interesting period because we never saw a fruit.\nIf anybody brought in an orange, if an American soldier gave somebody an orange or a\nbanana, we raffled it to the Red Cross. We didn\u2019t go hungry. We were never short of the\nmost awful bread you can ever imagine, and the American powdered egg, which we even\nthought made good cakes, you know, we had forgotten what a good cake tasted like. But,\nas I say, we were never hungry, and interestingly, we always knew we were going to win\nthe war. Don\u2019t ask me why, perhaps this was a moral booster, perhaps this was\nChurchill\u2019s speeches, but we never thought the Germans would overrun us. Of course, we\nalways suspected that we would be invaded, and this influenced, of course, the British\nattitude toward the refugees. We suspected everybody with a German accent of being a\nspy. It was a very difficult period for them, much more so than for us.",
        "Q: So, then, 90 days of bombing straight?",
        "A: Ninety days of bombing on London.",
        "Q: Was your house ever hit?",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: It was?",
        "A: Yeah, but my mother was okay, you know, the heck with the house.",
        "Q: So, where did you go? Did you stay in the house?",
        "A: I met recently a woman, she called me as a result of my book. She called me and she said,\n\u201cDo you remember, after the air raids when you\u2019d done all your rounds, you used to\ncome into our house and sleep on a bed or a mat or anywhere?\u201d No, I went to stay with\nfriends, and after the house was hit, we got my mother to leave London and go into the\ncountry. I wouldn\u2019t go. I felt safest in London, believe it or not. I couldn\u2019t bear the\nthought of being outside of London and seeing the bombs falling, because you could see\nthe fires.",
        "Q: And your mother was okay with your staying?",
        "A: My mother was okay. We were all okay. It\u2019s very interesting. There was no counseling 1n\nthose days, and I sometimes wonder if we have too much counseling when a child goes\nthrough a small trauma, true, a trauma, but in the old days going through this bombing,\nnobody came and counseled us and very often we were helping to dig bodies out of the\nAnderson shelters and finding people who were wounded badly, but we carried on. You\nknow, this was life.",
        "Q: So, you were then how old, 13?",
        "A: I was \u2014 no, I was older in 1939, I was 18, and in 1940, I was 19, but we had no prior\nexperience of this. The most wonderful thing to happen to us was when Hitler invaded\nRussia because then the bombing began to let up. And it was extraordinary because we\nall felt so guilty that here the Russians were taking what we had been having, and in those\ndays, Russia was our friend. The Cold War that came later seemed so \u2014 so different, so\ndifficult a period when we think of, we knew what the Russians were going through, that\nmillions were being killed by the Germans, millions and millions of them. I don\u2019t think\npeople even today realize how many millions of people were killed during that war\noutside of concentration camps. I mean, we talk of six million Jews dying, and that\nnumber, you can\u2019t imagine what six million is, and it was dreadful. There isn\u2019t a Jewish\nfamily, I think, worldwide, which didn\u2019t lose a relative, but in Russia, about 25 million\npeople died.",
        "Q: After 1941, when Russia was attacked, did you learn what was going on in terms of the\nkilling of Jews and did you know what had gone on in Germany in the \u201930s, rounding up\npolitical opponents and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses? Was there much knowledge that you had at\nthat point?",
        "A: If we read The Press and The Times published a lot of material. We knew. I\u2019m not saying\nI was very well-versed in what was happening. I knew Jews were being killed. I knew\nthey were being put in concentration camps because sometimes a friend would have a\ncousin who was 15, who\u2019d been brought out whose head was shaven, and he\u2019d been\nincarcerated in a concentration camp. We knew that people were being killed. We knew\nthat the Nazis were very nasty people, but when the killing really started, when the Final\nSolution started in 1942, I don\u2019t think we, as individuals, I don\u2019t remember, but I don\u2019t\nthink I knew this. We didn\u2019t trust the Germans. We knew they\u2019d kill every Jew they\ncould get their fingers on. So, from that point of view, we knew we had to be very\ncareful. For example, if you would walk along the country lane in England, or even an\nordinary street, and ask somebody directions, they\u2019d never tell you in case you were a\nspy. The sign posts were taken down. So, unless you knew the area in which you were\nvisiting, there was nothing you could do. We were terribly afraid of being invaded.\nOstens- you know, not ostensibly, obviously because we were 21 miles from the French\ncoast, not very far, and not too far across the North Sea to get to England, and attempts\nwere made to bring spies in. So, it was a very difficult period because, if you met\nsomebody you didn\u2019t know, you didn\u2019t discuss anything that might in some way give\nthem information.",
        "Q: Did you feel it was important when the Americans joined in the war effort? Was that a\ngood sign for you, or did you actually feel before then, \u201cWe\u2019ll win anyway.\u2019\u201d?",
        "A: I think before the Americans came, we thought we\u2019d win, but when the Americans came,\nHallelujah! Now, it was wonderful. It was wonderful because now we had an ally. Can\nyou imagine, in 1940, we were alone, totally alone, and many of us were making plans to\ntry to escape somewhere because we knew that, as Jews, we, too, would be taken by the\nGermans. But when the Americans, with the vast machinery for production, came into the\nwar, somehow we really knew we might win.",
        "Q: Did you also make plans to leave?",
        "A: Oh, yes \u2014 made plans, not really. Where could we go to? But, we dreamed of going up\nmaybe to Sweden, finding our way up there, but what would do with our parents? We\u2019re\na group of kids talking. You don\u2019t leave parents behind. But we thought we might find\nroots. We daydreamed. We daydreamed, but we really knew that if the Germans came to\nEngland, our lot was sealed. It was quite frightening.",
        "Q: So, what did you do after 1941? What happened between 1941 and \u201943, before you\njoined? What sort of a track? Had you gone to school? Had you finished high school?",
        "A: Yes, I was taking a course in social administration, and when I finished that course, I\nwent up to Birmingham during the course, actually to work at a settlement house in\nBirmingham, and then I went up to one in Nottingham where conditions were very\ndifferent from London. And it was there that I heard that the British government, being\nthe British government that it is, 1t always works closely with voluntary agencies, was\nasking for volunteers who would go overseas to any country to which they were sent with\nno prejudice, to help to save survivors both Jews and non-Jews, and I thought that was a\nmarvelous idea, but I was terrified of getting on a ship because ships could be sunk. You\nknow, we were losing so many ships during that war, but many people older than I were\nvolunteering, and, what the heck? I must say, at that time I talked to my mother because I\nwas her baby, and I told her what was happening and that it would be wonderful if we\nwould find Jews who survived because even in the \u201930s, as young as I was, I had some\ndaydream that I could go to Germany and rescue Jews. At least help them to get their\njewelry out so they could have some money when they came to England. My mother\nsaid, \u201cThey would never let you out.\u201d Or, \u201cThey\u2019d never let you in. You\u2019re Jewish.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cBut, Mother, they would never know.\u201d Of course, nobody would take me at age 16,\nbut when this call came, I did volunteer. There were some people I respected who had\nvolunteered, and the nice thing was I was chosen to go originally to Casablanca with a\nman called Friedman I think his name was. He was from Manchester. An American went\nas well. We were going to take care of Jews in a camp, but the French at that time were\nhaving trouble in Lebanon, so I learned, and so the British wouldn\u2019t allow any women\nout of the country. So, Morris Friedman went for Britain, and I waited for the next unit.\nHe went alone, and the next unit \u2014 each unit was ten persons. The first British-Jewish unit\nwas seven Jews and three Quakers, and there were units of the Red Cross, of the St.\nJohn\u2019s Ambulance Brigade, and all of the voluntary agencies that you know so well\ntoday. I think hundreds of people volunteered, and when I say volunteered, by the way,\nwe volunteered to go without salary, just to go wherever the government sent us to help\nsurvivors. And I knew we were going somewhere where it was warm because we were\nissued with a summer kit. I couldn\u2019t tell my mother where I was going. My father, by the\nway, died when I was 14. So, I\u2014 my father wasn\u2019t there to tell. But I knew we must be\ngoing somewhere where it was warm, but where? You know, one had no idea, and I must\nsay, I lied to my mother. I said I was going to a camp in Scotland for about a month, and\nwhen we came out of the camp, I would call her. And, of course, on February the 19\",\n1944, we got aboard a ship and sailed, and about a month later in convoy, landed in\nEgypt in Port Said.",
        "Q: Can we go back for a moment?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What sort of \u2014 when you signed up to do this? Was there training for all of you? Did you\nall meet together?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: All 200 people? So, could you describe that?",
        "A: Not all of us. The two of age groups met individually, and we had training camps at one\nof the Rothschild estates. I was a cook in one of them. So, the people would not only eat\ndecently, but be able to attend the various sessions. There was some very good people\nwho came and talked about what we might find, but who would know what we would\nfind? Nobody had any experience. What happened in these training sessions is that we\ngot to know each other, and we were all as different as chalk from cheese. Many of us\ndidn\u2019t know each other, and it was a way of getting to know each other, getting to know\nthe people who were doing the training. We were absolutely green when we arrived in\nEgypt, and as we took the train from Port Said down to Cairo, there were men on\nhorseback along the train shooting at us, just for fun. And, we were under the seats. You\nknow, and when I think of it, I don\u2019t think we were really scared. Who expected to be\nshot at? You know, you\u2019re coming to do relief work. We were in a camp in Maadi, M-a-\na-d-1, in Cairo for a while. We were allowed to read army records of what was happening,\nand that\u2019s when we really got to know what was happening in Germany. The British were\nbrining in Yugoslavs from the coast of Dalmatia. There was one camp that held about\n20,000 people, and there was another camp which we \u2014 we, the new units \u2014 were sent up\nto take care of on the Suez Canal, a place called Khataba, K-h-a-t-a-b-a, and when these\npeople came in, they were emaciated. They had women who were breastfeeding children\nof four and two. Their breasts were like envelopes. They had suffered tremendous\nmalnutrition. The British had taken them from Dalmatia to southern Italy, which was\nliberated, and then brought them into Egypt, but I must say the food that was provided for\nthem was excellent. The sun didn\u2019t hurt. They lived in tents. There were very few men.\nThey were mostly women and children, boys of 14 who had been in the army, who had\nlost limbs. And gradually they recovered. And my job at that time was to set up schools.\nWell, how do you set up schools for children when you have \u2014 there were two trained\nteachers, in fact, but no books, no pencils. We had learned some Yugoslav, and some of\nus were better at it than others. The army was wonderful. You could always get around\nthe quartermaster. And I discovered that there were little white stones in the sand in the\ndesert on which we were. So, we gathered the stones, and this how we taught them to\nwrite. We had \u2014 we were given a couple of tents, and then the ladies from Alexandria, as\nthere are always ladies who want to do good, came to the camp with shoes, and most of\nthese children hadn\u2019t worn shoes in their life, and they were afraid of these things. But we\nsay to them, \u201cLook, these ladies really are very kind. They\u2019re also bringing clothing.\nWhile they are here, please wear the shoes. When they\u2019re gone, you can take them off.\u201d It\nwas rather nice. I remember that instant.",
        "Q: How did you use the stones for writing?",
        "A: Oh, you formed letters with them. Later on, we were able to get some paper, and the\nladies from Alexandria actually were very good. When we told them what we needed,\nthey began to send paper and pencils in, and what we did, we sent some people from our\ncamp over to the larger camp of refugees, where they were trained to be teachers. They\nwere trained in one month to be schoolteachers and came back. They did a remarkable\njob. There was a war on, and everything was possible during the war. I think also because\nmost \u2014 well, I think almost all of us in Britain had suffered the bombing and suffered the\nwar. We could compromise, we could change things around, we learned very quickly to\nput up tents, we were sleeping four of us in a tent. I remember the dreadful latrines,\nwhich were seemed to me a mile long, and with hession, a sort of canvas in between, and\nyou lived like this. We ate fairly well. I was never sick. Some people got dysentery. I\ndidn\u2019t. Everything we ate on our own, which we weren\u2019t sure of, we put potassium tablets\nin the water to disinfect any nasty creatures, and we lived that way until October of \u201944.",
        "Q: I know you\u2019re going to move the next site, but let me ask you, when you saw these folks\nfrom Yugoslavia, what was your first impression? Were they telling the stories of what\nhad happened?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t have to tell stories. You looked at them. You looked at the babies with big\nstomachs and big heads, and some women were breastfeeding children of two and\nchildren of four. She was feeding two babies, because they had had no real food for so\nlong. In our units, by the way, there were many doctors who volunteered, women, and\nthey immediately set up a hospital, but we got a measles epidemic, and in eight weeks, I\nthink, we buried \u2014 no, six weeks, we buried over a hundred children, and that was\ndreadful because we lived within the hospital compound, and they crying of these women\nwas absolutely dreadful, dreadful. To lose a child, no parent should bury a child. It was\nawful for them.",
        "Q: So, you were in that camp for how long?",
        "A: Ten months.",
        "Q: Ten months?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, did you consider yourself now a seasoned relief worker at the end of the ten months?",
        "A: I never even thought of it that way. We had a job to do. We did our job. The Yugoslavs,\nas they got well, entertained us. They had beautiful singing voices, and they would sing\nin four, five parts. There were some others who were musicians, and they were very nice\npeople, very nice. They were very clean people. A lot of them, I would say for the most\npart, were peasant people, but, you know, they were human beings.",
        "Q: And so then, why did you \u2014 why were you sent away from that situation to another\nsituation?",
        "A: Oh, because southern Italy was liberated, and the allies were getting ready for the\nliberation of Yugoslavia, which we had been trained to enter. Trained in the sense that we\nlearned the language, we knew where we were going, we knew the kinds of jobs we\nwould do, and because of the work we had done in Egypt, we were trained to take care of\nYugoslavs who had gone through hell in this war. When we got to Italy, I happened to\nhave been in the first unit of ten people who were sent over to Italy in preparation for\ngoing into Yugoslavia, and Teeter was approached by the British American armies. I\u2019m\nnot quite sure of the chain of command. He said, \u201cWe\u2019ll do the job ourselves. Send us the\ngoods.\u201d And they did. They did a very good job. So, here we were, the rest of the unit had\ncome into Italy, we were sitting there. The Italians were very pleased to see us. The\nItalians were very nice actually. They were living under appalling conditions, having\nsuffered German occupation and British occupation, and they would have liked us to\nhave stayed, but we really had no job to do in Italy. And then we heard one organization\nworking in southern Italy called the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. They\nhad, I think it was one representative at the time, a man called Reuben Resnick, working\nthere, and we thought it would be an excellent idea if we could be seconded or loaned to\nthis outfit so that we could help them. We had been given by the army, as had all the\nunits, a three hundred weight truck, and a three ton truck. We all learned to drive that\nDodge which was double the clutch. It was terrifying, but we could all drive them, and\nwe had lots of supplies. And so in talking to the army, and the heads of the units did so,\nwe asked if we could join the American organization and they said, \u201cCertainly, and take\nall your supplies with you.\u201d It was a lot of give and take in those days. They\u2019re much\nmore difficult today. I don\u2019t know why. And so we loaned ourselves to the Joint. We\nwent up to Rome to start with. Florence was still occupied, I remember, because as it was\nliberated, some of our boys took matzohs up to Florence for the first Passover of the\nliberation. I was helping to get ready the first legal transport going to Palestine after the\nwar. I think it left on April the 12\", if my memory serves me, and I remember Moshe\nShertock - I think, yes, that was his name \u2014 went with us, and I and somebody from the\nJoint, Israel, or Gaynor Israel Jacobson, worked on that transport and got that going, and\nit was very interesting because there were \u201cX\u201d number of certificates. People still had to\nhave certificates from the British government to enter Palestine, and let\u2019s assume that we\nhad 300, and they were all numbered. As people got on, the cards of those in front were\ntaken and given to others at the back. So, although 300 were supposed to be on the ship,\nprobably there were 400 or 500. I never did know how many got on, and that ship went\noff. That was one of the things we did. We also, which were helping people who would\ncome in from Yugoslavia in small boats. I remember, the women would come in with\nhand grenades around their waists, great big burly women, very nice, but terrifying. And\nwe met a lot of people, and then, of course, the Germans were still trying to bomb us, and\nI know, I remember very distinctly, when the Germans came over, of course, the\nAmericans \u2014 the American civilians who hadn\u2019t seen any of this stuff, any of the\nbombing, would rush to the windows, and we Britishers would rush under the beds\nbecause we knew what shattered glass could do. It was an interesting time. When \u2014 yes, it\nwas an interesting time, and as Italy began to be liberated, some of our people were going\nup north. When Greece was liberated, I was asked by the European director of the Joint\nDistribution Committee, a very wonderful man called Dr. Joseph Schwartz. He was a\nrabbi by training, and really a very, very wonderful human being, one of my heroes. He\nasked me if, when Greece was liberated, I would go into Greece with their director, and\nof course, who would refuse? And, I was in Greece \u2014 well, the war was still on \u2014 when\nthe camps were liberated, and people, I think, don\u2019t realize that so many thousands of\npeople had been incarcerated in concentration camps and labor camps, and the army had\nno place for them once they were liberated, and the only thing they thought of doing was\nsending these people home. So, being in Greece at the time of the end of the war,\nsuddenly the trains began to come in with these young men and women, many of them\nspitting blood from tuberculosis, no families. Out of a total, I think, of 70,000 Jews in\nGreece, there were about a total of 10,000 who survived all together, both in hiding and\namong those who came back, and I remember some of them having to sleep in the street.\nIt was summer. It was June when they got back. They had to sleep in the street because\nthere were no sanitarium \u2014 no sanitarium beds for them, and it was very, very difficult\nbecause none of them family. There were girls with no sisters or brothers. There were\nboys with no family. Occasionally, you\u2019d see an adult who son or daughters had been\nkilled, and this organization, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, set up a\nhostel in Athens with a very wonderful local Greek lady called Mrs. Mossieri. I\u2019m sure\nher children are still alive. She was a go-getter, and she helped to set up this hostel. I\nwent with Israel Jacobson to Palestine at that time to meet with Golda Meir and Mr.\nSheretz Shatok (ph), and I can\u2019t think of the other gentleman\u2019s name at the moment, to\ntalk to them about supplies that we would need and also people were beginning to go\nthrough Athens to Palestine illegally. It was very easy. Perez was next to Athens. They\nsent in some of their units of workers. There were people, ostensibly press agents. All the\nmarvelous people, and one of the things that we asked at that time was that you slow\ndown the movement because the British would come to what was known as a Hachshara,\na camp, at Perez, and count the individuals there. And I remember the one day they came\nand they said, \u201cWhere is everybody?\u201d And we said, \u201cThey\u2019ve gone home.\u201d That was\nnice.",
        "Q: So, who were you working for then?",
        "A: I was working as a volunteer with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee.",
        "Q: So, you had left the British.",
        "A: Yes, we all split up. That whole unit of ten persons was split up. Some people went into\nAustria. Most of them stayed in Italy. There was a lot of work to do in Italy because\npeople were coming into Italy to try and go either to Palestine or to register with a\nconsulate, if an American consulate was open, to join family in the United States or to\nleave Europe \u2014 one thing people wanted to do was to leave Europe at this time.",
        "Q: Were you considered \u2014 I\u2019m not going to use the word traitor, because that 1s obviously\nmuch too extreme, but British policy was one thing about illegal immigration. You were\nnow working for an American organization. Did you feel as if you were 1n some sense\nworking against the policy of the Brits?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t?",
        "A: No, I was working to help refugees, survivors. And that\u2019s all I was doing, and whenever\nor wherever I could do it best was all that matter to me. It never occurred to me. I don\u2019t\nthink I\u2019m a political animal, actually, but no, that never occurred to me, and the\nAmericans had supplies. You see, after the war, I suppose, the Americans realized a) they\nmight have done more before the war, and b) they had money. The British were bankrupt\nby now. The British had nothing. They had no foreign currency. Everything was bombed.\nThey had no housing. I know how my family was living. No, I never felt disloyal at all. I\nwas only working to help survivors.",
        "Q: So, what was this trip? You went to Palestine by boat from Athens.",
        "A: No, we flew.",
        "Q: You flew?",
        "A: Yes, we flew.",
        "Q: Was that your first plane trip?",
        "A: Yes, it was my first plane ride.",
        "Q: Was that scary?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I had time to be scared. No, it wasn\u2019t. That\u2019s not true. It wasn\u2019t my first\nplane ride. In 1943, no, I beg your pardon, at the end of 1944, I was \u2014 I received word\nthat my mother was ill, and I managed to hitchhike on a plane to London, to Croyden\nAirport, and it was interesting because when I got to Croyden there was a big loud thump\nas a bomb, and I thought that the bombing was finished, and I said to the porter who was\nhelping me off, I said, \u201cWhat on earth is that?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s a doodlebug, lady.\u201d\nDoodlebug would be bombs which were unmanned that they were sending from Holland\ninto Britain and they suddenly stopped and dropped. I saw my mother. She was delighted,\nof course, to see me. She did survive that illness, and I managed to get back on a ship that\nwas going to Italy. And, so, I arrived back about a month later. That was my \u2014 sorry, that\nwas my first \u2014 the trip to England was my first plan trip.",
        "Q: So, let me ask you something. You had told your mother that you were going to Scotland\nfor a month to a camp, right? Well, obviously, you had been away for more than a month.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: Had you been writing to her so she finally knew what it was?",
        "A: No, she only heard from me once I landed in Egypt. The mail was so bad, very few\npeople had access to telephones, and they were often not working. I don\u2019t think it even\nworried her. My older brother, who actually was 21 years older than I, when I told him I\nwas going to volunteer, he said, \u201cMother will be terribly upset.\u201d I said, \u201cI have talked to\nher. She thinks it\u2019s a wonderful idea.\u201d Absolutely true. And I didn\u2019t tell him, either. I\ndidn\u2019t tell anybody in the family because you were sworn to secrecy. The ship could be\nsunk. And so they only heard from me after I arrived in Egypt.",
        "Q: Before we talk a little bit more about Greece, are there any particular people, incidents,\nthat you remember in Egypt or in Italy that really matter to you that you think might be\nimportant for people to know about?",
        "A: Initially, there weren\u2019t individuals that one would single out. Everybody who I knew was\ndoing a tremendous job. As I say, living in tents in the desert. We didn\u2019t feel that we were\nsuffering in any way. I guess we weren\u2019t being bombed, which was rather nice. We had a\njob to do. So, Egypt was okay. Occasionally, we could get into Cairo and see where\nnormal people lived and had normal facilities. No, Egypt was okay.",
        "Q: You are referring to the loo?",
        "A: Yes, yes, which, you know, we were using trenches in the desert. When we got to Italy,\nconditions there, 1n a sense, were not as good as in Egypt because the Italians had no\nheating in the houses in which were builted (ph) and there were little fires in the rooms\nwith pipes going out of the window. Fortunately, there was no carbon monoxide coming\nout of them. The Italians were suffering very badly. So, and we had no gripes. I mean, we\nwere well taken care of. By now, we had winter uniforms. We were dressed, by the way,\nas American army officers. We had PX facilities, which, to us, were fantastic. You know,\nwe hadn\u2019t seen some of the things we saw in the PX since before the war. We had very\nlittle money, but that didn\u2019t matter, you know.",
        "Q: Did they give you spending money?",
        "A: We had ten shillings, which at that time was, I suppose, something near two dollars. That\npaid for the dobe, the laundry, and whatever was left over.",
        "Q: Ten shillings per what? Per month? Per week?",
        "A: I think it was \u2014 it must have been a week because there was lots of laundry \u2014 yes, it was\nten shillings a week, I think. It would\u2019ve have had to been. Maybe it was a month. I don\u2019t\nremember. Money never bothered me. There was nowhere to spend it, anyway, and when\nwe were in the desert in Egypt, there certainly was no PX. The only time we met the PX\nwas when we arrived in Italy because the Americans were there, and they had the PX and\nthey were very generous. The American boys in the army were quite extraordinary. They\nwould give away their bomber jackets when they thought we were cold. You know,\nthey\u2019d pass them over to us. They\u2019d offer to buy anything they could for us in the PX,\nand those who had money were able to take care of themselves, and people were nice.\nYou know, they\u2019d buy stuff that we all could share. There were foodstuffs available in\nthe PX which we hadn\u2019t seen in a long time.",
        "Q: Can you give us an idea of what?",
        "A: Well, there were canned nuts. I remember loving peanuts, which we hadn\u2019t seen in years\nand years and years. The only thing we had that was cheap was we could buy liquor at\nseven and sixpence, I remember, for a bottle of scotch, and it was very good, I gather, for\nbribing people. I didn\u2019t drink, so, you know, I lost out there, but you know, these things\nin a sense didn\u2019t bother one. We were fed but we were doing a job. We weren\u2019t\nconcerned. I must be honest there.",
        "Q: So, what was the difference between the kind of food that the refugees would get that you\nmet in Yugoslavia?",
        "A: In Italy.",
        "Q: I mean, in Italy, and what you had?",
        "A: Or in Egypt.",
        "Q: Or in Egypt.",
        "A: Well, they cooked Yugoslav food, and they cooked very well, and occasionally they\nwould invite us to come and enjoy a meal with them because our food was cooked by the\nArab cooks, and it was okay. There was nothing wrong with it, but Yugoslavs are very\ngood cooks. It was heavier food than we were used to.",
        "Q: Who provided them with food?",
        "A: The army, and I suppose at that time it was the British army since the British were in\nEgypt, in control.",
        "Q: And then what happened in Italy? Who provided them? The same thing \u2014 the army\nprovided...",
        "A: The army provided the food for the refugees. Camps were immediately set up. One in\nSanta Maria di Bari, which is down on the heel of Italy. That was a Jewish DP camp.\nThen, there was another one in Cine Citta in Rome, which was the movie studio in Rome.\nThat was set up as a displaced persons camp because a lot of people were released who\ndidn\u2019t belong in Italy. There were Romanians, Hungarians, they were all nationalities,\nand no house to go to, or they couldn\u2019t go because those places weren\u2019t liberated yet.\nSo...",
        "Q: So, there were a lot of holding actions?",
        "A: Yeah, lots of holding actions for these people, and for others, they were sent home. I\ndon\u2019t know to what homes they were sent. I\u2019m talking not only of Jews at this point. A lot\nof the Russians were sent back, as you probably know, and I don\u2019t think a lot of them\nlasted. A lot of them had been volunteer workers with the Germans. Some of them were\nSlave laborers. It was a very, very difficult stage for the army because, for the most part,\nthey were still flushing out the Nazis, and yet they had this civilian population whom they\ndidn\u2019t understand, by the way. They tried to treat them when the camps were liberated as\nthough they were former Nazis. They locked them up in other camps until, you know, the\narmy came to understand who these people were and until there was communication with\nthe voluntary agencies like the American Joint Distribution Committee.",
        "Q: When was the first time that you saw Jews? Was that in Italy?",
        "A: There were very few \u2014 there were three or four or five or six 1n among the Yugoslavs, but\nI think they didn\u2019t stay long in the camp. I think they were able to cross the Suez into\nPalestine.",
        "Q: And was the same true in Italy?",
        "A: No, in Italy, it was different. Firstly, there were the displaced people. They were\nYugoslav Jews. They were Russian Jews. They were all kinds of Jews. They were Italian\nJews. In Rome, there was quite a community of Jews who had been in hiding. There was\na Jewish orphanage in Rome, for example, which had been taken over by the Catholics.\nThe Catholics had taken the Jewish children from the orphanage and had hidden them in\ntheir orphanage out of town, and then they\u2019d hidden them again, and when the Catholic\norphanage was bombed, the one that was out of town, the American Joint Distribution\nCommittee rebuilt it for them as a thank you for having saved the Jewish children, and\nthen our units \u2014 because we had volunteers \u2014 the Joint had administrators who, we had\nvolunteers who set up the orphanages again. They had experience in working in\norphanages. It was quite an exciting time in a way to do positive things \u2014 to see children\nsmiling, children who hadn\u2019t been incarcerated, because we\u2019d seen firstly the Yugoslav\nchildren who had been starving, and we began to get pictures of what was happening in\nGermany. We used to occasionally get shown German film that had been captured of the\nNazis throwing children over the balcony, you know, it was ghastly, ghastly.",
        "Q: Did you travel around Italy or did you stay primarily in Rome?",
        "A: No, I traveled around. I traveled around Italy.",
        "Q: So, what was your job, then, in terms of traveling around? What was your task?",
        "A: Right, for example, if I went down, let\u2019s say to Santa Maria di Bari, I would go there,\nfirst you\u2019d see how the camp was running. It was amazing how, without any experience,\none became an expert. I did have something kind of social administration training, and I\nthink I was instinctively an administrator. I would see what was needed 1n that camp. For\nexample, we had one of our unit members in charge of a search bureau which we set up\nimmediately because the important thing was to try to reunite families. We had no baby\nclothes because once people \u2014 the camps were liberated and people began to lead normal\nlives, women began to menstruate again. They hadn\u2019t menstruated all through the war,\nand being normal human beings they began to get pregnant and have babies. We needed\nsanitary napkins for the women. We needed baby clothing. We needed special food for\npregnant women. There were some older people who survived. We needed special food\nfor them. We needed doctors. We needed more social workers. And one could assess this,\nand gradually these people came in to work in the camps. It was exciting in the sense that\nyou felt you could do something positive, and then the most important thing, I think, at\nthat time was the search bureaus that we set up. And they were interesting because, for\nexample, you had to very quickly learn that the name \u201cSchwartz\u201d, for example, S-c-h-w-\na-r-t-z, can be spelled 30 different ways, and how do you distinguish? How do you find\nIvan Schwartz from Belgrade, for example? You then knew you had to have his\nbirthdays, his parents\u2019 names, their birthdays, where they were born, and you set up a\nvery good system internationally. The headquarters, at one point after Germany was\nliberated, was Arolsen in Germany. There was a big unit in London set up by the World\nJewish Congress and there was a big unit also in New York, and I think they were right.\nThe most important thing was to help people find family. This went on for years. It still\ngoes on. People are still finding relatives, close relatives.",
        "Q: Could you describe how people \u2014 there were no computers,",
        "A: Absolutely not.",
        "Q: So-",
        "A: And, no typewriters.",
        "Q: Right, so how did people find these lists? Where were the lists placed?",
        "A: Okay, Ill give you an example. If we were in Vienna, and you came and you said, \u201cMy\nname is Joan Koppelbaum. I come from Warsaw. I had a mother and father and three\nsisters and four brothers, and I managed to escape. I don\u2019t know what happened to them.\nMy parents, I think, were taken to a camp. I think my brothers and sisters may have\nescaped.\u201d What we would do, we would send these lists of people who are asking for\nrelatives to each office, and each office would contact the next office to see if they had\nany of these people registered with them. We did use the Red Cross, but we found we\nwere more efficient, I must be honest, than the Red Cross. Firstly, the Red Cross took\nmuch longer than we did. We knew that time was of the essence. These lists were passed\naround, and we all got copies of these lists. So, if we were looking for your relatives, we\ncould look and say, \u201cHey! Your aunt, we haven\u2019t found your parents yet, but your aunt is\nin Salzburg.\u201d And very often, of course, when these people came to our offices, all the\nwalls had their names written on them, and one would write, \u201cI\u2019m Ivan Schwartz. I\u2019m\ngoing to Rome.\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019m Ivan Schwartz. I\u2019m going to Munich. You will find me. I will\nbe with so-and-so.\u201d It was like the tom-toms working. And in the beginning, this 1s how\npeople found each other.",
        "Q: So, people would leave little messages about -",
        "A: Oh, they\u2019d scribble on our walls.",
        "Q: On your walls?",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: Not on paper?",
        "A: Oh, on the walls. And we had, let\u2019s say \u2014 we had five or six rooms, and these messages\nwere on the walls. We would also take notes from them, but \u2014 and, sometimes, a father\nwould find a son in the office, and I can\u2019t tell you the emotion of that moment.\nEverybody was so thrilled, and everybody cried. You know, I still get emotional because\nI saw so much of this. It was wonderful, wonderful, and then you would hear the sadness.\nYou know, \u201cYour mother got killed.\u201d Or \u201cI don\u2019t know where your mother is.\u201d And\nsometimes it would take months and months to trace a family member, and as I say, they\nare still tracing family members. I hear stories from Poland today where they are still\nfinding people alive in the States who they thought had died. You know, in the old days,\nwhere we had immigration at the turn of the century, relatives lost touch with each other,\nand after this calamity, they certainly lost contact.",
        "Q: Amy, you say that it was so wonderful to be able to do good things for people. That\u2019s\nclear. In these first two settings, in Egypt and Italy, it must also have been difficult. There\nmust have been hard times because people are not coming out of this whole. There\u2019s so\nmuch loss.",
        "A: But we hadn\u2019t suffered. They had suffered. This was the difference. We were there to\nhelp them. I don\u2019t think we ever thought of ourselves in this \u2014 I\u2019m being honest, I don\u2019t\nthink I ever felt that I had suffered anything at all. You know, it was just so wonderful\nwhen you found a relative for somebody or when you were able to find a house for\nsomebody to live in. I don\u2019t think, and I\u2019m not saying we weren\u2019t selfish people, we were\nnormal human beings, but the job was so in a sense exciting. Can you imagine going up\nto a town that\u2019s been liberated and the Jews there finding \u2014 there were Jews, mostly we\nwere British or the American in charge of the Joint would come up, and they\u2019d see us in\nuniform or they\u2019d see us, members of the Jewish Relief Units with the Shield of David on\nour shoulders and, you know, the Star of David on our berets. It was so hard for them to\nbelieve that Jews had survived as Jews without being taken prisoner or had come to help\nthem. I don\u2019t think \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine anybody that I know of, and we were all very\ndifferent people, being concerned for ourselves in that sense. I don\u2019t think we could\u2019ve\nbeen because we might eventually have gone home more quickly. I mean, some of us\nstayed on for years to help until the displaced persons camps were liberated.",
        "Q: And, describe again \u2014 you wore an American army uniform.",
        "A: Yes, I was an American army officer in uniform. My papers said I had the status of a\nlieutenant colonel, and it said, in fact, on my identity card that if I were taken prisoner by\nthe Germans, I was to be treated as an officer. I still have those documents.",
        "Q: And you wore the American army uniform in Egypt also?",
        "A: No, in Egypt, I was in British army officer\u2019s uniform.",
        "Q: And you wore skirts, or you wore-?",
        "A: We wore skirts. Women didn\u2019t wear trousers at that time. We wore skirts, and some of\nthe American women had nylon stockings. They must have been an inch thick, now that I\nremember, but of course, they got them at the PX and they gave us some. No, I think they\ngave us, I don\u2019t think they sold them to us, and it was wonderful to wear a decent pair of\nhose. You know, we hadn\u2019t had them in years. The Americans were very generous, I\nmust say, very generous.",
        "Q: How did you clean your clothes?",
        "A: That\u2019s a very good question, isn\u2019t it? When it was warm, of course, everything was\nwashed. I think the army had a cleaning service. I remember, in Vienna, there was an\nAmerican cleaners, and I met somebody who worked in Vienna with me, and she said,\n\u201cYou used to come around every week and ask if anybody had cleaning, and you would\ntake it to the cleaners for us.\u201d I don\u2019t remember it, but she told me this was so.",
        "Q: I was wondering because uniforms are fairly heavy.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Except in the summer.",
        "A: Right, no, we had, through the Red Cross, I think, or through the PX, we had a cleaning\nsystem. Funny, those things I don\u2019t even recall because I suppose that wasn\u2019t important to\nUS.",
        "Q: Was there any difference in status between the women who went over in the relief group\nand the men who went over? Were the men not lieutenant colonels, but higher than that?",
        "A: No. We all had the same status. Everybody had the same status. We had one unit leader, a\nwoman who ran our unit was Phyllis Gerson, who after the war, the British government\ngave what\u2019s known as a MB, a Master- a Member, rather, of the British Empire award to\nher for having served in this unit, and the British government was very interesting. They\nso valued our work, I think, that after the war they presented us with the same medals\nthey gave to fighting servicemen. I have mine. I would never use them, even the\ndecorative ones, because I didn\u2019t think we earned them. You know, we weren\u2019t fighting,\nbut I thought it was a very generous gesture.",
        "Q: Okay, I think we\u2019ll take a break now.",
        "A: Excellent. How\u2019s it going?",
        "Q: Fine.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Amy, let\u2019s go onto Greece. You were describing circumstances in Greece which sounded\nmuch worse in some ways than what you found in Egypt and Italy, and these were mainly\nGreek Jews who were coming back?",
        "A: Yes, these were Greek Jews. The situation was worse because in \u2014 firstly, in Egypt, we\nhad many volunteers working with the people who the British were bringing in from the\ncoast of Dalmatia. In Greece, we were two foreigners, there was the head of the Joint\nDistribution Committee and I, and some local workers, and in Egypt, they hadn\u2019t been in\nconcentration camp, and no matter how much people had suffered, they hadn\u2019t suffered\nthe brutality, the inhumanity of the Germans in the sense of the people who came back\nfrom concentration camps had. We had girls who came back who had tattooed across\ntheir stomachs, \u201cNur fuer ofitserin\u201d \u201cOnly for officers\u201d. They were used in brothels. The\nboys, very many of them, had been castrated. So, in addition to all their suffering, in one\nsense, the suffering was even worse than others, and yet, none of them had families to\ncome back to. There wasn\u2019t a mother and a father. If there was a brother, there was\nnobody else. If there was a sister, there was nobody else. There were no complete\nfamilies left in Greece. As I mentioned earlier, I remember very clearly, the population\namong Jews in Greece had been 70,000 before the war, and after the war there were\n10,000. That\u2019s a tremendous percentage of Jews who were killed.",
        "Q: Were most of the people who came back from the concentration camps from Auschwitz,\nor from labor camps that they had been sent to on death marches?",
        "A: They were from different concentration camps. I don\u2019t think any of them had been in\nlabor camps. I think they were in concentration camps, which were death camps.",
        "Q: This young girl that you said had a tattoo on her that said, \u201cOnly for officers\u201d, was she a\nJewish girl?",
        "A: Oh, yes, I\u2019m talking about the Jews. There were some non-Jews who came back to\nGreece. I must say we helped them, too, where we could, that we didn\u2019t differentiate. For\nthe most part, 1t was Jews who were deported.",
        "Q: What was the most difficult thing for you in helping these people?",
        "A: That we couldn\u2019t help them enough. They were so ill, so many of them. They were\nsuffering from TB, and there were no sanitaria where you could put them and nurse them\nback to health. You had, you know, we had to set up places extempore and put them in\nbeds. You didn\u2019t have the medical facilities. You didn\u2019t have the medicines, and at that\ntime, streptomycin wasn\u2019t yet available. So, you know, these people were really\nsuffering. They were very, very ill. They suffered tremendously, and it was very difficult\nto see it.",
        "Q: So, you \u2014 tuberculosis is very catching, so did you separate all with people who had\ntuberculosis, or couldn\u2019t you even know who had tuberculosis?",
        "A: One didn\u2019t know who had tuberculosis. Some were obviously tubercular because they\nwere spitting blood. We were not concerned for ourselves. It\u2019s an interesting question\nyou ask, because it never occurred to me that this was a contagious disease that I might\nget. It had never occurred to me. I\u2019m sure none of the other workers had thought of it in\nthat sense. The main concern was to get these people treated, and Greece had very few\nbeds available. Greece had suffered tremendously anyway under the Germans, you see.\nThey were occupied. And that was a very difficult time.",
        "Q: Did many die?",
        "A: Of our people-",
        "Q: No, I mean of the survivors who were coming back?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember them dying. I don\u2019t remember them dying. Maybe they had\nsurvived because they were so strong. Don\u2019t forget, they come out of camps, had been\nput onto trains, I\u2019m sure without any nursing facilities, and sent across Europe back to\nAthens. They had to have been strong to start with. I\u2019m sure the weak ones hadn\u2019t\nsurvived in the first instance.",
        "Q: You know, I think it\u2019s interesting, people don\u2019t necessarily think about how difficult it is\nafter a war, what it means to clean up and repair and at the same time take care of\nindividuals, so the picture is very graphic when you describe it this way, and you describe\npeople sleeping in the streets because there were not enough beds.",
        "A: There weren\u2019t \u2014 they were sleeping \u2014 I remember, I saw it, sleeping on benches in\nConstitution Square in Athens. As I say, it was a warm summer, but there were no places\nto put them. Eventually, gradually, we managed to find places, but some of those men\nwho had been through absolute hell were now sitting \u2014 sleeping in the square. And some\nof them were very angry. I remember, one came into the office once \u2014 it sounds funny at\nthis point \u2014 but, again, he was going to shoot Israel Jacobson, and I sort of stood between,\nthe brave one yet stupid, and he said, \u201cHey that\u2019s a Mauser. I always wanted a Mauser.\nWhat do you want for it?\u201d And this boy, I know this instinct so clearly, and Israel\nJacobson 1s alive \u2014 he can tell you the story, too \u2014 he said, \u201cI want 25 greenbacks.\u201d And I\ndon\u2019t remember whether he wanted them with the yellow seal or the red seal. They\nthought the different seals had different values, and we bought it from him, and I\nremember, we got a friend to row us out to the Aegian and we threw the gun into the\nwater. That was just \u2014 I remember that particularly, because when I stood between them,\nthis wrist was flicked out that way, and this one this way. Eventually my wrists were put\nback, I had terribly swollen hands. So, that was all right.",
        "Q: Why did that happen?",
        "A: Well, they went for me. You know, they were angry. It was all our fault, wasn\u2019t it? No,\nno, you can understand these men, for heaven\u2019s sake. They came back, there were no\nfamilies, and they wanted money and they knew we had, but not in the office. But, he\ncame \u2014 he was going to kill anybody, he thought. Maybe he didn\u2019t, but, you know, this\nwas a gesture.",
        "Q: It was a loaded gun?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. It probably was, yes. It probably was. He must have taken it from a\nGerman he had killed.",
        "Q: Did you get scared afterwards?",
        "A: There was no time, no. No, you can\u2019t be scared just because somebody is threatening to\nkill somebody else. You know, and you got in between. I had very sore hands for a bit,\nbut that was life.",
        "Q: Were there more women than men also in these circumstances, coming back to Greece,\nor was this a case of where there were more men than women? Do you remember?",
        "A: I seem to remember more men. There were some young girls who came back, a number\nof them from the island of Rhodes, and we couldn\u2019t send them to Rhodes because there\nfamilies had been killed. There were no families, and that\u2019s when we decided together\nwith this wonderful woman, Mrs. Mossieri, to set up this hostel to house these girls, and\nwe helped them, of course, immediately, also to join families. So, some of them came to\nthe States. Some went to Canada. Some of them stayed in Greece. Some went to Israel.\nWe tried to help them join families wherever we could because what 1s life without\nfamily?",
        "Q: How did the non-Jewish Greek population feel when these folks came back? I mean, they\nalso had suffered during the war. So, I don\u2019t know, were they able to help? Did they want\nto help? Or were they simply trying to get through it themselves?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the Greek hierarchy being interested. Now, maybe that\u2019s because I was\nso busy and never contacted them, but we were in contact with Mr. McVeigh who was\nthe American ambassador there because there was a change of currency at one point,\nwhich we tried to fight successfully. Spiros Sikuros was there. I went with him on a plane\nfrom Italy to Greece, and he was very nice because he helped us to get the Nuremburg\nlaws rescinded. They were still in effect in Greece after the war.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes, and I remember there was a man, a major called, Moish Perlman (ph), who later\nbecame, I think, the press attach\u00e9 for the Israeli government, 1f my memory serves me, I\nthink that\u2019s right. Spiros Sikuros, whose son was in the army. I traveled with him and his\nson on the plane to Athens, and he was very nice, and he helped to get the laws rescinded.\nIt was appalling that they were still in effect, but Greece was still trying to recover itself.\nI don\u2019t think they intended to keep them going, but they didn\u2019t of themselves suggest that\nthese laws be rescinded or the property laws be rescinded. It required this outside\npressure to get them done.",
        "Q: Now, even though people came back and there were no families, was there property, like\nhouses or apartments that they tried to take over?",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. There were houses, but there were people living in them, and you\ncan\u2019t just walk into a house when somebody else has taken over your home, and this\nrequired legal procedures, and it took time, and you had to have proof, and these people\nhad to find their papers. These things were not easy, but there were lawyers employed by\nthe Joint Distribution Committee to help these people to get property back, but it was\ndifficult. It took time, especially when you had a country like Greece where they\nthemselves had suffered so much under the Germans. They were still trying to provide\nrestitution to all the Greeks, let\u2019s say, in addition to the Jews. We were interested in\nhelping the remnants of the Jewish community, but the Greeks were interested in helping\nall Greeks. It worked slowly.",
        "Q: Excuse me, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: It worked very slowly.",
        "Q: In Eastern Europe, the Joint Distribution Committee often went around to the families\nwho were taken care of Jewish children, non-Jewish families, and sometimes kidnapped\nthem away. Was anything like that happening in Italy or in Greece? Had there been\nchildren in hiding who people wanted to keep?",
        "A: You\u2019re thinking particularly of Poland. That is a very interesting story. Not to my\nknowledge. Not to my knowledge. I didn\u2019t come across it. If it existed, I didn\u2019t know of\nit. But the sad thing in Poland, of course, was the fact that many of these people never\ntold the children who they kept that they were Jewish children until they were dying\nthemselves. And, of course, you know, you now have this Jewish school in Warsaw\nwhere those children\u2019s children attend. It\u2019s very \u2014 tough, tough questions. It\u2019s very hard\nto take 1n a baby of six weeks and four years later, when you\u2019ve loved it and nurtured it,\nto give it up.",
        "Q: How long were you in Greece?",
        "A: I was in Greece from April \u201945 until August \u201946.",
        "Q: A long time, April \u201945 to August 46.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t think of it in that sense. I was working.",
        "Q: So, were you traveling around Greece in the same way you were traveling around Italy?",
        "A: Not as much because you couldn\u2019t \u2014 1n the beginning, you couldn\u2019t travel around Greece.\nThe only way to travel that\u2019s safe from Athens to Salonica was by boat. There were no\nbridges. They had to be built. There were no roads. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Yes, we\ntraveled a little to see communities that we could. We\u2019d go up to \u2014 I\u2019m trying to\nremember \u2014 Yanina, which was north of Athens, or to the south, but you couldn\u2019t travel\naround much.",
        "Q: How did you travel when you did?",
        "A: To Salonica, by boat.",
        "Q: And on the roads, how did you go?",
        "A: We had Jeeps, army Jeeps.",
        "Q: So, you didn\u2019t go with a cart and a donkey?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. No, nobody had carts and stuff.",
        "Q: And was your work in Greece very similar to what you did in Italy? You were setting up-\n?",
        "A: I set up a welfare agency in Athens. These people needed money to buy, and my feeling\nwas you didn\u2019t hand out money to people. It was degrading to them to have to receive\ncharity in that sense. And I set up a system of relief whereby they came to the office, if it\nwas one person, there was that set amount. If it was two people, or a family, there were\ndifferent amounts, and we gave them checks, and they went to the bank and cashed their\nchecks. This was my feeling, and always has been that the only thing that people often\nhave left for themselves 1s their dignity, and this to me was one way of giving it back to\nthem. It worked very well.",
        "Q: And how did they cash a check if they didn\u2019t have an account?",
        "A: It was a Joint check, and we had an arrangement with the bank, of course. The bank knew\nus. Our money was coming in through the Bank of Greece. I think Varvaresso was the\npresident, and we knew him quite well. I remember on one occasion, when we had\ndeposited quite a large sum of money, and had been assured that that money would not be\ndevalued, because Greece was constantly devaluing, and one day when Israel Jacobson\nwas on his way by plane, I remember, up to Salonica, I heard that the bank that morning\nhad devalued the drachma, which meant that the $150,000 we had changed was now\nworth about $15. I sent somebody immediately to the airport to bring him back, stop him\ngoing, which we did, and then we got in touch with the American ambassador \u2014 I think\nhe was an ambassador, I\u2019m not sure already. I don\u2019t think he was consul. I think he was\nan ambassador, Mr. McVeigh, and they said, \u201cWell, we just have to accept this.\u201d And\nSpiros Sikuros of Fox Films, I think he was, said, \u201cWell, have to accept this.\u201d\u2019 And, I said\n\u2014and I said to Israel Jacobson, \u201cWe don\u2019t accept this. This is Jewish money that is hard\nto come by. It\u2019s voluntary donations. We\u2019ve got to fight this.\u201d And I remember we fought\nit, and we got our money back. I felt very good about it.",
        "Q: How does one fight a general devaluation of currency?",
        "A: Well, you go to the president who has assured you two days before there would be no\ndevaluation, and you face him with his promise. I mean, you\u2019re not scared. You can\u2019t\nhave 150,000 then the next day have 15, and you\u2019re trying to feed people who\u2019ve been\nstarving. It\u2019s amazing how much courage you get when, you know, there\u2019s something\nreally important here.",
        "Q: Was there a lot of black market in these places where you were, that you remember\u2019?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure there was. It wasn\u2019t talked about. In a sense, it wasn\u2019t black market. If they got,\nlet\u2019s say, cheese given them in cans, you got sick of that cheese. I\u2019ve tasted. So, you\nchanged it for eggs. If that\u2019s black market, there was black market. And there were\npeople were very glad to get it. Or there would be chocolate, which was very nutritious,\nhorrible stuff, and you could swap that for something else, for a can of bully beef or\nsomething. The black market never bothered me. Firstly, 1t was people getting foods that\nthey wanted, and foods they felt they needed, and they were trading. I don\u2019t see that that\nwas such \u2014 they weren\u2019t stealing anything. They were just exchanging, and since it\nwasn\u2019t an official exchange, it was known as a black market. This happened in Austria. It\ncertainly happened in Germany. I didn\u2019t see it as anything bad.",
        "Q: You seem to be describing barter, which I think may be somewhat different than black\nmarket, where people do make money, and-",
        "A: Oh, you\u2019re talking of jewelry and stuff like that. That happened, yes. I didn\u2019t see it in\nGreece, by the way. The first time I really came across it was in Germany.",
        "Q: Now, when you gave people money, or checks so they could have some money, was this\nsufficient so they could rent an apartment, perhaps, or was this really to enable them to\nget food and sustain themselves.",
        "A: Well, it was to help them more so to find places to live, and there was a group in the\ncommunity who was finding places. They weren\u2019t all Athenians. So, they didn\u2019t all own\nproperty in Athens, and they were able to, if they had money, they could rent a room and\nthey could buy food, and eventually we got food in through the American Joint\nDistribution Committee, which we could contribute both to individuals and through the\nsynagogue. The rabbi was there, Rabbi Basel, I think his name was. They were taken care\nof, minimally, I must say, because this 1s all we could do. The war had just finished. It\nwas hard to get stuff put aboard a ship. Money was the thing that you could get. So, we\nwould go into, or sent to Palestine for goods, for clothing, or to Egypt for goods and\nclothing. We were fortunate enough that we had \u2014 there was Mr. Charles Passman in\nPalestine, who was with the American Joint Distribution committee also, a wonderful\ncharacter. I knew him, and he would send us food and send us clothing, and I think we\ndid it also through the Jewish Community in Cairo. You bring back memories.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to go back to something because I\u2019m going to forget it if I don\u2019t remind you\nand me. You said you met Golda Meir on a trip from Italy to Palestine. What was she\ndoing and what were you meeting about?",
        "A: Well, she was a member of, I suppose, the hierarchy in the British \u2014 no, sorry, beg your\npardon \u2014 in the Palestine Jewish community. She was one of the political animals as well\nas Sharett, and I can\u2019t think of the others at the moment who I also met. We went to see\nher essentially because people were coming into Athens from the north, escapees. I think\nthe war was still on, and coming down to the hachshara (ph) that was in Perez, and there\nwasn\u2019t enough space. They weren\u2019t moving out quickly enough on the leaderships. I must\nsay the Joint wasn\u2019t arranging illegal movement. I know that.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t?",
        "A: No. It had a very clean nose in that sense. I think they were scared in the sense that if they\ndid anything illegally, and the American government discovered it, they wouldn\u2019t trust\nthem. I know when I was working on immigration, we were terribly careful. But the\nPalestinians were working their ships. We were feeding the people, and-",
        "Q: I was asking you about what the meeting was about with Golda Meir.",
        "A: Right, we went to see her because they were coming down rather quickly, and there\nwasn\u2019t enough space in the hachshara to house them, and we really went to ask her to\nslow down the movement a bit so that people came in more slowly, and could be shipped\nout, because the hachshara was rather small, and I guess she did her stuff. It was\ninteresting meeting these people.",
        "Q: Did you learn to speak Greek since you were there for so long, or at least, over a year?",
        "A: I had kitchen Greek. That\u2019s what I would say. It wasn\u2019t very good Greek, but I had an ear\nfor language, and could understand what was being said. No, I used English. I also began\nto learn German. I had no idea I was to eventually going to end up in German speaking\ncountries, but that I found easier. And the boys, many of them spoke, or the girls also\nspoke German. They spoke English, too, a number of them, and we, of course, operated\nwith interpreters.",
        "Q: Did you interview some of these survivors that had come back? Did you sit down and\ntalk with them or was work so overwhelming that that was not part of what you were\ndoing?",
        "A: Do you mean about their experiences in the camps?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they were ready to talk about it. It never occurred to me at that time, when\nsomebody came back, to talk about it experience in a concentration camp. When you sat\ndown with somebody, you talked to them about how many members of his family were\nthere? Did he know where they were? You talked for the future, not for the past. I must\nsay, in all my experience, I never consciously asked them to talk about their experience in\nconcentration camp. Firstly, for them it was very difficult, especially since they had gone\nin sometimes as a family \u2014 a father and two sons, and this was the only son who survived,\nand purely by the grace of God, no other reason. We never asked them to. Some of them\ndid tell you of their experiences, and you listened. We didn\u2019t ask questions. They had a\nneed to talk, and you had to have a good ear and listen. Some of it was horrific. Some of\nit was horrific, but no, I never remember asking about the experience in a camp.",
        "Q: Did you ever notice that the spoke with each other?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think they did. They had certain codes, I think. They hadn\u2019t all been in the\nsame camp, and those that had, the fact that they were together meant that they had\ncomfort. They were lucky. They had other people they could talk to about what they went\nthrough who would understand. I think they might also have thought we couldn\u2019t\npossibly understand, and how could we? How could we understand the brutality and the\nkillings and the horrific things that they had to do? No, you didn\u2019t ask.",
        "Q: As you heard some of this from people, I mean, since some people did speak with you,\ndid you \u2014 you seem to have an extremely positive outlook on life. I mean, it just shows in\nyou. Did this depress you and make you wonder about the capacity of human beings to\ncommit horrific acts like this that you had never thought of before? Did you think this\nwas just aberrant?",
        "A: No, I never thought it was aberrant. This was very intentional by many, many people. I\nthink when people would tell me their stories, I used to think, \u201cAnd they survived this.\u201d\nAnd the important thing was to get them away from this. I mean, how could people go\nthrough the kind of thing they had? The bombing 1n London was nothing compared to\nthis, and that horrified me. I was terrified. No, I seem to remember also when people\nwould come and tell some horrific stories that you couldn\u2019t cry with them. You were\nthere to help them. I used to say to some of the people who work for me, particularly\nwhen I went into Austria and then Germany, \u201cWe can\u2019t cry with them. We can cry for\nthem afterwards, but we have to help them.\u201d I don\u2019t know where this attitude came from,\nfrankly. I think it\u2019s always been there.",
        "Q: So, did you sometimes cry alone?",
        "A: Oh, when we got home and we would talk. We were a group living in the same apartment\nbuilding, and I remember Hannah Kisch, who was a wonderful woman, originally from\nLithuanian who immigrated to South Africa and came up to help us, and she would tell a\nstory and be sobbing, you know, and we would share stories that we\u2019d heard, but it didn\u2019t\nlast for long. We didn\u2019t have time to do this. You know, when we were working, we\nstarted, I suppose, at seven or eight in the morning, and who knows what time at night\nwe'd finish. There were no days off. There was no closing the office because it was dark\nor something. You were working all the time. Sometimes, some of the people were in the\noffice all night. I don\u2019t remember being, except once or twice in Salonica, working late\ninto the night, or in Italy when we were working on this transport to Palestine, working I\nthink all night through. I don\u2019t remember it, but you just did it, and 1t wasn\u2019t work, you\nsee, you were helping people. And I think we were lucky and a number of people who\nvolunteered to go overseas were of similar ilk, and if they weren\u2019t \u2014 some of them went\nhome after the year\u2019s contract was up, which was just as well.",
        "Q: I can see you\u2019re seeing somebody in your head. Yes?",
        "A: Yes. But that was all right. That was all right.",
        "Q: Did a number of people get sent home because they were not right for this kind of work?\nOr did people generally just go home on their own?",
        "A: I know of one person who was sent home. I think people left on their own. Some of them\ncouldn\u2019t take this kind of work. Remember, except for those in Britain who\u2019d been throw\nthe Blitz, so we\u2019d had some kind of upheaval in our lives, the average American who\ncame later to work, had had no upheaval. I remember one of the survivors writing to me\nafter he got to the States saying \u2014 we sent him to his aunt \u2014 and he was telling me he said\nhow terrible the food rationing was. Sugar was rationed she said during the war, and he\nsaid eventually he just had to pick-up and move out of her house. He said she was a\nlovely woman, but she had no understanding, and I think that\u2019s partly answer to the\nquestion of why did it take so long for people to start talking because nobody in a sense\nwas interested.",
        "Q: Did you mainly socialize with each other? Did you sometimes socialize with the\nsurvivors who would come?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. We socialized with each other. We weren\u2019t very many. When we had\ntime to socialize. We ate in a different place, obviously. We ate in the billets that we were\nput in, and some of these people were people I\u2019d normally in normal life have as friends,\nand we could socialize. But we were on different levels. We were \u2014 we were foreigners.\nWe were help that came in to help them. We socialized with the people we employed to\nwork with us, and that \u2014 most of them were wonderful people. You know, if you give\npeople a chance, they will. Some of them were gaz/onim, gangsters in English, but a lot\nof them were wonderful people. You couldn\u2019t socialize with everybody, obviously, but\nthe people we worked with, we socialized with. We would have dinner with them. Invite\nthem to our mess, you know, we were eating in an army mess, and that food was different\nfrom theirs. There wasn\u2019t very much socialization in the sense that we use that word. At\nnight, we were quite often very tired, and were glad to put our feet up. Some of them\nwould come and put their feet up with us and have a drink maybe and then go home. So,\nit wasn\u2019t socialization in the general sense of the word.",
        "Q: Did you sleep okay?",
        "A: Most of the time, yes, I think, under mosquito nets in Greece. It was malaria, still. And\nthere\u2019s a very nice instant I must tell you of. We were taking an antimalarial drug, which\nmade us yellow, and somebody came in, I think, from Palestine, and cabled to Paris that\nwe were looking very ill. We were very yellow, and so we were sent for two weeks to\nPalestine on vacation. How did you tell people this was a result of \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\nwas attaprin (ph), or something we were taking at the time that made us look very yellow.",
        "Q: So, what was that like to be in Palestine for two weeks?",
        "A: It was lovely.",
        "Q: Where were you?",
        "A: Well, we went to Jerusalem, and we went up to Rosh Pina, and met some friends who\u2019d\nbeen working in Greece, and went into Kibbutzim, and it was lovely. It was lovely to see\nnormal people leading normal lives. We were in Jerusalem, which was really a lovely,\nlovely city, a lovely city. It was very nice.",
        "Q: Did you meet up with some of the folks who had been in the camps and had -",
        "A: No, they hadn\u2019t gone yet.",
        "Q: They hadn\u2019t gone yet?",
        "A: No, I\u2019m talking of \u201945. No, they hadn\u2019t gone yet.",
        "Q: So, you at least had in these few years a two week vacation.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: And all ten of you went?",
        "A: Two of us.",
        "Q: Two of you?",
        "A: Oh, you\u2019re talking of the Jewish Relief Unit, no, when I talk of Greece, I was there alone\nwith a representative of the Joint Distribution Committee. Two of us went. No, the others\nwere either in Italy still, or had gone into Austria, but in terms of vacation, you never\nthought of vacation. I\u2019m not saying we were self-sacrificing. That never occurred to us.\nYou worked, and the work wasn\u2019t work. It didn\u2019t feel like work. It\u2019s very difficult to\nexplain. You were helping people who needed help desperately, and I guess we took days\noff occasionally. I don\u2019t remember, but I\u2019m sure we did, or we went \u2014 yes, we did, of\ncourse. We\u2019d go up and see one of the Greek ruins somewhere. You know, drive, take the\nJeep where you could drive to and have lunch at the seaside taverno, which was very\nnice. Oh, yes.",
        "Q: You were in Greece from April \u201945 to August \u201946, yes? So, in the beginning, it must have\nbeen much tougher, because the war is just over, or not quite over.",
        "A: In June.",
        "Q: In June, right.",
        "A: The Greeks were shooting up people reading the Communist newspapers in\nConstitutional Square, I remember. That was how they celebrated the end of the war. Our\noffice overlooked the Square.",
        "Q: You can see people being shot?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. You know, all in a days work, kind of thing. At a very early age, you got used\nto seeing this kind of thing, and it was horrible, horrible.",
        "Q: What was it like a year later? Were there sort of incremental changes, like every three\nmonths you could see a real difference?",
        "A: No, supplies began to come in. For example, we were very indiscriminate still at that time\nin using DDT to disinfest people. You know, in Egypt, we disinfested the Arabs, poor\nsouls. God knows how much we got up our own nostrils. Who knew it was such a\npoison? And we stopped using DDT at one point, but I remember puffing it into the\nArabs galobiers (ph), you know? Things began to change as people began to get a place\nto live, found family, decided they would immigrate, registered with a consulate, had\nfamily members contact them. Nobody would come in, and there was very little civilian\ntraffic between Europe and the United States or Australia, and they still couldn\u2019t go to\nPalestine except legally \u2014 if they were going legally on a certificate. So, movement was\nslow, but gradually things began to get a bit better, and as I say, as people began to find\nrelatives, things were better. It was very slow, very slow, and people were ill for a long\ntime, a long time, and to get property back took years. You couldn\u2019t see it in increments.\nIt didn\u2019t happen quickly. Look how long it took to get reparations from Germany. They\nstarted in \u00b045 and the reparations began to come through at the end of the \u201940s, and these\nwere with all the great powers working together and Germany willing to give back in\npart.",
        "Q: How was it that you came to go to Austria?",
        "A: In August of 1946, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, my hero, a blessing really \u2014 he really was a\nwonderful man with a wonderful sense of humor and a marvelous administrator \u2014 asked\nme if I would go up into Austria. He said President Truman in December of 1945, on the\n22\" of December, had passed \u2014 had issued a directive which enabled people who were\ndisplaced persons to get priority for American visas under the quota system. In other\nwords, they still had to go through the quota, but they would get visas rather than people,\nlet\u2019s say, who\u2019d lived in England or South America, and he said they\u2019d had somebody\nthere working, but who hadn\u2019t panned out, and would I do this? Well, I would have done\nanything this man asked me, and so I went up into Athens, but I knew nothing of\nAmerican immigration law, and I must say, I sat down for four days with this American\nimmigration law from 1924, I think it was, and then with the Truman Directive, and\ngradually began to get things together, and it didn\u2019t take too long. Firstly, here was\nsomething very positive. We were going to be able to help people to leave Austria \u2014\ndisplaced persons and Austrian Jews. And the first problem we had was that those Jews\nfrom Austria who had returned to Vienna from camps were not considered displaced\npersons by the consuls, but the International Refugee Organization had registered them as\ndisplaced persons, which they were. They didn\u2019t have their homes. They didn\u2019t have their\njobs. Some of their family members had been killed, and so, we set up a test case. When I\nsay we, I was very brazen, I must confess, and I established a precedent case showing\nhow this man \u2014 I won\u2019t give you his name, he lives in the States today \u2014 how this man\nhad lost family, had lost his home, had come back, had no where to live, was being\nhoused by the American voluntary agency, and essentially he was still a displaced person,\nand we won the case. So, he could get a visa and go to the United States. When this\nhappened, we could put through other Austrian Jews. There weren\u2019t too many left, and\nget them visas, and then we could help the others to get visas. And the interesting thing\nwas we began to work rather swiftly. My thought was firstly we must get young people\nout because the young people are the future of any community. Secondly, we must get all\nthose people out who have relatives who will help them. That meant they would not be a\ncharge on the voluntary agency\u2019s funds, which really had to harness its money, and also it\nwould give them back a normal life, and so these people began to move rather swiftly\nthrough the pipeline, and it worked very well until the first Displaced Persons Act,\nAmerican Displaced Persons Act of 1948. This in a sense sounds like a mythical story,\nbut I was in Vienna and some members of the Displaced Persons Commission, I'll think\nof their names in a moment \u2014 Carrousi (ph) and some other people, came into Vienna, I\nthink it was on a Saturday, maybe it was a Friday, and said, \u201c\u201cWe\u2019re ready to issue visas\nunder the Displaced Persons Act. Where are your job and housing assurances? On the\nbasis of those, we can give visas.\u201d Frankly, I\u2019d never seen a job and housing assurance. I\ndidn\u2019t know what it was. I knew we were going to have some, but we were waiting for\nour American agency to send the stuff over, and I said to these men, \u201cOur job and\nhousing assurances are at the printers, at the Allianz gebaude,\u201d which 1s the office where\nwe took all our mimeographing. If you would write one out for me, Ill go over there and\nget it mimeographed. I was lying. I\u2019d never seen one. They were very nice, these\ngentlemen. They wrote it out. I went over to the Allianz gebaude. I mimeographed about\n50. I had all the cases which I knew were okay. I issued a job and housing assurance for,\nand these went to the consulate and these people gave them visas. I called Munich and\ntold the director of immigration there what I had done and what the wording was on this\nthing so when these men eventually got to Salz \u2014 I beg your pardon \u2014 to Munich in a few\ndays, they were ready. Now, our people began to get visas, and I must say within about\nten days a cable came through to the director of the Joint in Austria, Harold Trobe, telling\nhim that was Amy Zahl was doing was illegal and please stop her at once. And he called\nme on the phone and told me this, and so I went to the consulate, I picked up every\nJewish case I could find whether we would have been working with them or not, issued\nthem job and housing assurances, and then stopped. Now, what happened was as the\nships began to take passengers to the States, and we were using army transports, there\nwere a lot of Jews in the first ship \u2014 ship, one ship, two ships, about four ships, and the\npress in the United States, of course, \u201cOnly Jews are getting visas.\u201d There were lots of\nanti-Semitic comments in the press, and I\u2019m sure if you look at the press at that time,\nyou'll find 1t was only because we were on the ball. What we did do, of course, was tell\nthe other agencies what they needed and how to go about it. We didn\u2019t have a counsel of\nvoluntary agencies in Vienna. We did when I got to Germany, but that was very\ninteresting. I felt as though I was doing sort of some really dirty work, but we were\nhelping people to get out.",
        "Q: Can you explain what a job and housing assurance is?",
        "A: Yes. In order to get a visa, you no longer needed an affidavit from an individual. What\nyou needed was instead an assurance that you would have a job when you got to the\nUnited States and that you would have housing. And voluntary agencies were allowed to\ngive these out because ostensibly, the voluntary agencies in the United States were going\ninto communities and asking them, and they were very good for all displaced persons,\nJewish and non-Jewish, to give job and housing assurances which they did. The Jewish\nand all the other agencies were very cooperative, and many displaced persons did get to\nthe United States on the basis of those job and housing assurances.",
        "Q: Amy, was the assurance of a particular job?",
        "A: A particular job.",
        "Q: For this particular person.",
        "A: For this particular person in a particular spot in the United States, in a particular town.",
        "Q: So, then, how did you do it?",
        "A: Okay. If, Ivan Schwartz came to me, and he had met the other provisions of the Truman\nDirective was \u2014 which were that you had to have been in the American, British or French\nzones of Austria or Germany or the British, French or American zones of Vienna or\nBerlin on December the 22\"\", 1945, you were eligible. If you were eligible, we could get\na job \u2014 we would contact the States and we would get \u2014 this is under normal\ncircumstances \u2014 a job and housing assurance for Ivan Schwartz to go to Seattle to be a\ntailor, which he had been before, and on the basis of that, providing he passed his medical\nwith the consulate, providing he passed his security with the CIC, the Counter\nIntelligence Corp, he would get a visa. Those were the only people who were eligible. So,\nwhat I did, since I had job and housing assurances already for people, I just had to sign a\nname to them. In a sense, I did it without authority.",
        "Q: And did you do it thinking this person could do this job?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You just did it to -",
        "A: I had no idea what job they did. I wanted to get these people out, and it worked.",
        "Q: Were these mainly men?",
        "A: Families.",
        "Q: Families?",
        "A: Oh, it was families and individuals. It was whoever was eligible under the provisions of\nthe directive.",
        "Q: But you know why I\u2019m asking? Because are these jobs that are assured mainly jobs for\nmen?",
        "A: Mostly, I would think they were jobs for men because women weren\u2019t a large part of the\nlabor force in \u201945. They were a very small part of the labor force except in munitions\nfactories and things like that, but in Europe women hadn\u2019t been part of the labor force\nbefore the war, and we\u2019re talking of people who hadn\u2019t worked since the war.",
        "Q: And may not have finished school...",
        "A: May not have finished school.",
        "Q: Was this and added burden for women then, unless they got married and were part of a\nfamily?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t seem to remember many individual women, and maybe as many\nwomen didn\u2019t survive. I don\u2019t remember as many women alone coming and trying to get\nout under the Displaced Persons Act. That\u2019s a fascinating question because, when I think,\nI always think of families or husband and wives or single men. I don\u2019t remember many\nsingle women.",
        "Q: Because one might wonder whether some of the women married sooner than they might\nhave, knowing that they might be able to get out if they were married, but not if they\nwere single.",
        "A: Right, and by the same token, some of the men might have married women they might\nnot otherwise have married because they were born in Germany, let\u2019s say, where the\nquota was good. They were still working on the quota system, remember. So, people\nmarried each other for different reasons, apart from the fact that they were fond of each\nother.",
        "Q: So, how long did you work in Austria?",
        "A: I worked in Austria from August \u201946 to October 48.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a long period. Could you describe, I mean, you were doing these visas, were you\ngoing around and explaining to people how they could get visas?",
        "A: Yes, I used to go into the camps and explain what the law was, how they could become\neligible. I had offices in Salzburg, in Linz, in Innsbruck, and I would call these people\ntogether who run the offices. So, we all ran on the same system. It was a tiring job ina\nway. You had to be on the ball all the time, and you had to have good people, but the\nsystem worked very well, and then, when in 1948, the Displaced Persons Act was passed,\nI was asked, again, by Dr. Schwartz to go into Germany.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t want you to get to Germany so fast.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: I want to talk about Austria a little bit. What was it like to \u2014 did you lecture? I mean, did\nyou get into a hall and lecture to a group of DPs to say this is what you-",
        "A: No, I learned German very quickly. I learned it because I didn\u2019t trust interpreters. I didn\u2019t\nknow if they were working for the Russians or for the French or for the British or for the\nAmericans, trying to catch me out. You learned to be very wary living in Vienna. For\nexample, we couldn\u2019t leave Vienna without a propesk, a permit, from the Russians. I still\nhave one as a matter of fact. And what we, I would do when I was going up to Salzburg\nor to Linz, the other side of the Russian zone, I would get on \u2014 there was an American\narmy train known as the Mozart, and we would get on that and that was not inspected by\nthe Russians, but you still had to have a permit to leave Austria. What was the rest of\nyour question?",
        "Q: I was asking whether you would get in front of a large group of DPs and lecture to them?",
        "A: No, I\u2019m sorry. I would go up, let\u2019s say, to Linz, and talk to the people in the office, and\nthen I\u2019d go into a camp and talk to them. I learned Yiddish, also, and I learned to speak\nwith a Polish accent. There\u2019s a different accent if you\u2019re a Russian Jew or Lithuanian\nJew. You have a softer accent. I would talk to them in German or in Yiddish about what\nthey had to do, and why it was taking so long from their point of view, that there was no\nneed to try and come, let\u2019s say, to the office in Vienna, which some of them would try to\ndo or to go to Salzburg. We didn\u2019t have the staff to cope with large numbers, but what\nwas happening and what we were doing and I think the fact that we kept them informed\nof what we were doing helped to stop any rioting that we might have had. I don\u2019t\nremember any rioting at all, actually. We had people who would be very irate and come\nin and bang the table and make all kinds of threats, but I think it helped having offices\nwhere, you may laugh at this, where we set up chairs where they could sit and wait,\nbecause when I first came in, there were no chairs for visitors. They lined up, and one by\none they went in and stood by a desk. Well, this whole thing of dignity which I\u2019d learned\nat a very early age. People \u2014 you don\u2019t give them dignity by making them stand and you\nsit. I remember, what we did in Vienna and I did it again in Germany. We got a great big\nurn, and made coffee, and the nicest person I could find, usually a nice Hungarian boy, I\nwould put in charge of the waiting room, and he\u2019d offer people coffee. They were unused\nto this. A lot of people wouldn\u2019t drink our coffee because they were ultra-orthodox, but\nother people would, and we would have newspapers in the office, and as I told you,\nthey\u2019d go along the walls scribbling their names and where they were going to or leaving\nnotes with somebody and they\u2019d meet each other. It became a meeting place. It worked. It\nworked. Sometimes, they had to wait a long time in order to get seen because we didn\u2019t\nhave colossal staff. The work was tedious. For the consuls, you had to have everything in\norder, and we weren\u2019t only working on American immigration. We were working on\nimmigration to Palestine. No, we weren\u2019t doing the Palestine immigration now. Palestine\nwas being handled by the Jewish agency. We were not working on Palestine. That\u2019s an\nerror. We were working on South America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South\nAfrica, and the paperwork was very slow, but people did begin to move out. But the\nTruman Directive was wonderful because, for the first time, numbers of people began to\nleave, numbers, and the Rothschild Hospital, which was housing so many of these\npeople, began gradually to get \u2014 to lessen in number its occupants. But it was hard work.",
        "Q: Amy, in \u201946, there are still people in DP camps who were not technically survivors, who\nhad left the country because of the war and they were accumulated in DP camps. Did you\nhave criteria for who you would give visas to?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t give visas. We were not judges. The people who in the DP camps, there were\nvery few survivors of concentration camps \u2014 I\u2019m thinking of Vienna \u2014 no, there were.\nThere were people who\u2019d survived camps. No, we made no criteria. How can you decide\nthat this need is greater than that need? You know, because he has a new baby and these\ndon\u2019t have a baby and they\u2019 ve both been through hell and only one of that couple had\nbeen through hell. No, no, no, you couldn\u2019t afford to be judgmental. You couldn\u2019t afford\nit. But, as long as they met the criteria, and not a great number did, but a fair number met\nthe criteria, we did everything we could to help them get in. The Immigration and\nNaturalization Service, I must say, were not very kindly disposed toward these people,\nand did everything they could to find some fault where they could deny them entry to the\nUnited States, and then you would have to appeal. This happened occasionally and\nsomebody was absolutely heartbroken when you knew that they were genuine and they\nwere refused entry by the INS having gone through all the medicals and all the other\nchecks, and had been given visas and had written to relatives that they were coming.\nThey suddenly found that Immigration and Naturalization Services found their papers\nwere not in order, let\u2019s say. Those were very hard times, very hard times.",
        "Q: And would you appeal for them?",
        "A: We had somebody with legal experience who appealed to the INS, and very often we\nwon our case, very often.",
        "Q: And what do you think the INS was doing? Were they being genuine? Were they simply\nnot wanting these folks to come in because they-?",
        "A: Well, I remember one of the \u2014 I know \u2014 I remember the name of the man who was in\ncharge of the INS in Munich. When he told Dorothea Green, who headed up the ORT,\nOrganization for Rehabilitation and Training, who is a very lovely lady, very handsome,\nand she was fighting for a case, and he said to her, \u201cLady, you\u2019re here to get these people\nin. We\u2019re here to keep them out.\u201d And she didn\u2019t lie. And I\u2019m sure this was their attitude.\nThey didn\u2019t like these people. After all, they didn\u2019t speak English. They weren\u2019t well\ndressed by a long shot, and these men didn\u2019t like them, and maybe they\u2019d been given\ninstructions to try and keep them out. I don\u2019t know. No, that was pretty tough, but the \u2014 in\nthe first instance, these people didn\u2019t go to the INS until they got to Bremen. So, they\nwere held back in Bremen. Later on, when the Displaced Persons Act came into being,\nthey sent the INS into different regions so people didn\u2019t accumulate in Bremen, but rather\nwent to Bremen knowing they were going to board a ship.",
        "Q: Did you sometimes take the information? Or were you sort of the administrative head of\nyour staff?",
        "A: What do you mean, did I take information?",
        "Q: Well, did you see with clients?",
        "A: I was in charge of the administration, but I handled what I considered to be difficult\ncases. For example, if one of my workers said to me, \u201cAmy, you know, I\u2019m not sure that\nthis man\u2019s papers are really genuine.\u201d Because I must say, the Joint was very, very\ncareful. It would\u2019ve been foolish for us to sponsor cases of people whose documents were\nfalse, because we might have ruined for everybody. I would then take on that case.\nFirstly, 1t was very time consuming, and there were plenty of people lined up, and I\ndeveloped a means of questioning people where, if they could pass my surveillance, I\nwould think that their papers were genuine. If it became apparent to me that really these\npapers were false, I would say to this person, \u201cYou know, we can get you into Canada as\neither a furrier or a tailor or this or that. So, you could \u2014 excuse me \u2014 you could meet your\nrelatives in the United States. Or, if you would like to take your family to Australia, we\u2019 ll\ntry and get you there.\u201d But, I would not sponsor that case. That case became a no-no in\nour office. No, we were very careful in that sense.",
        "Q: Can you give me a sense of what it would mean to have a false paper? What is that kind\nof documentation people had to have?",
        "A: Okay. It was sad. These people had to prove that they were in Austria, Germany or Italy\non December the 22\u2122, 1945. Now, some of them had gone back to Poland to look for\nfamily and not found them. So, on December the 22\" 1945, they were in Poland rather\nthan in Germany, and they would make false papers to say they were in a Germany town\non that date, so that they could pass. Now, it sound became apparent, for example, the\nImmigration and Naturalization Service would say to them, \u201cWhat color were the\nstreetcars in the town?\u201d because they knew. And very soon, of course, the survivors knew\nwhat color the streetcars were. When you think back, it was horrid to treat people with\nsuch indignity, people who had suffered so much and who had gone to look for relatives\nand this was their crime because, because of that, they couldn\u2019t get visas to the United\nStates. It was horrible.",
        "Q: You must have gotten angry at times, no?",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t afford to be angry. You had to find ways to overcome this stupidity. You\ngot angry for your clients because you knew they were decent and fine people who\nperhaps been in concentration camp, or they\u2019d be in Koraganda, in Russia because they\nhad fled to Russia from Poland, and then come back, and they worked in the mines. They\nsuffered, and here are these people treating them like gangsters because \u2014 criminals\nrather, because they hadn\u2019t been in a certain place on a certain date. They may have come\nover three days later, by the way, and that was awful. That made you very sad, very sad\nbecause sometimes a mother would get a visa and her adult son wouldn\u2019t. And then what\nwe try and do 1s help the adult son get to Canada because we knew that through Canada\nand the United States, they could work something out where the two relatives could be\njoined again. It was hard to watch.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s take a break.",
        "A: Excellent. Don\u2019t tell me an hour\u2019s gone through again!\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: Amy, give me some idea. You were in Austria for a rather long time, close to two years.",
        "A: More than two years.",
        "Q: More than two years. What was it like to be in Austria during that time? Did you meet\nwith Austrians as well as the refugees and the survivors that you were helping?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t meet with Austrians. It was a very difficult situation in the sense that Vienna\nwas occupied by the Americans, the French, the British and the Germans. Each had a\nsector, and there was an international sector, and one had to be very careful not to go into\nthe Russian sector at this time, because you could be arrested. So, it was a bit difficult.\nAlso, Vienna had been bombed, and the only accommodation they had for people like us\nwas in hotels and what were formerly known as studen (ph) hotels. Those were hotels\nwhere somebody came for an hour, and the rooms were very tiny, and that, I found, very\ndifficult to live with, and so I got myself a billet in a private home of some Austrians and\nhad at least a room and a bathroom that I could move around in to myself, and it was a bit\nfurther out from the center. So, it was fairly pleasant. But they had no heating and I had\nto supply coal to heat my room. But it wasn\u2019t bad. You know, I\u2019d come from England,\nremember, not too long ago, and we didn\u2019t have homes to heat after the bombing. So, that\nwas okay.",
        "Q: And were these older Austrians?",
        "A: No, these were younger people. The husband had been a Nazi, but as he said, if he\nweren\u2019t a member of the Nazi party, you couldn\u2019t run a business, and I must say, I\nbelieved him also that he was a decent man because, when I was there, he was often sent\npackages from Jews who he\u2019d help to get the Argentine, and they were sending him food\npackages. So, he couldn\u2019t have been all bad.",
        "Q: Is that your main association with Austrian citizens?",
        "A: I beg your pardon.",
        "Q: Is that your main association with Austrian citizens?",
        "A: With Austrian citizens, well, I had Austrians working in my office, Austrian Jews, but I\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 I had very little contact or almost no contact with Austrians per se.",
        "Q: Did other members \u2014 actually, how many members of your staff were there?",
        "A: In the immigration office? I had another person from England who was my secretary and\nconfidant, there was a man who originally had been from \u2014 had been Austrian, he now\nlived in Britain, and he helped. And then there must have been eight other local staff, and\nthey were Jewish, essentially because we wanted to give Jews employment, and so we\nwere about a dozen people in my office alone.",
        "Q: But, you had \u2014 you administered a number of offices?",
        "A: Yes, this was the Viennese office, which I worked in as well as administrating. Then I\nadministered the office in Salzburg, the one in Linz, which was the other side of the\nRussian zone, and the one in the French zone in Innsbruck, and then we had\nrepresentatives in all the displaced persons camps because we would go out to them to\nsave people having to travel to Vienna, which they couldn\u2019t do unless they had permits to\ngo through the Russian zone, and that, nobody was keen to do at this time. We would go\ninto the camps, and tell them things which were necessary for them to know, or collect\npapers, or bring them papers for signature. It was a bit of an awkward program, although\nit worked very well. Or they could go into Salzburg, where there papers were held. It was\nnot an easy situation actually because we were always worried that there might be\nRussians around trying to pick up people because sometimes we had Russian army\nofficers who were Jewish. For example, a woman came to me one day dressed almost in\nrags with dyed hair looking very ugly, and she said her husband and daughter were in\nPalestine. She was a doctor in the Russian army, and there was a certificate for Palestine\nfor her at the British consulate, could we help her? Well, the first thing you think 1s, \u201cA\nha! She\u2019s a spy. She wants to see what we\u2019re doing.\u201d And I took all her particulars and I\nwent across to the British consulate, and sure enough there was a certificate, but that\nwasn\u2019t enough as far as I was concerned. I contacted friends who were working with the\nJewish agency for Palestine, told them the story, and asked them to check in Palestine\nthat she did indeed have a husband and a daughter there, because one never knew how\nhonest these people were. There were many ways by which you could trick somebody,\nand the answer eventually came back that yes, her husband and daughter were there and\nthey confirmed her story. Now, how was I to get her out? She had to come at times when\nvery few people were around. I had to try and do everything so that she wouldn\u2019t be seen,\nand eventually I got her certificate, and how to send her to the airport which was in the\nRussian zone? And the only way to do it was to take her myself, and don\u2019t think I wasn\u2019t\nscared. I\u2019m not so brave, but she sat in the car with me and we handed in her papers, and\nmy propesk, my permit to go into the Russian zone, and we put her on a plane. And there\nwere others. I had a young woman who was working at the Polish consulate, who had a\nbrother in Canada. My goodness, my memory\u2019s going back, and she said she had a visa\nto go to Canada, and again, I was suspicious, and checked her out in the same way. I\nchecked through the consulate and then I checked with the agency, the Jewish agency\nworking in Montreal, and they confirmed her story, and she told the Poles at that time she\nwas going on vacation, and off she went to Canada. It was tricky doing this because you\nwere always suspicious that perhaps these people were not genuine, and that you might\nbe picked up yourself on the street because people were being picked up, particularly by\nthe Russians. People would be walking along and suddenly a car would stop, and like a\ngangster film, people would be whisked off and not seen again. It never happened to any\nof us. I\u2019m just adding drama to the story, I guess.",
        "Q: Who were they picking up? Who were they looking for?",
        "A: I have no idea.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know?",
        "A: No idea, perhaps they were Russians who\u2019d defected, could be.",
        "Q: Now, this Russian woman who had been a doctor in the army, why did you have to bring\nher into your offices when very few people were there?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t want her to be seen. Maybe I was scared, but I thought the less people who knew\nof her or who saw her, the better. I remember her name. Her name was Hasia Rapaport,\nand I remember it very distinctly.",
        "Q: Did you ever meet her later on?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Were you also nervous that people who would see her might denounce her to somebody?\nI mean, that there was-",
        "A: Well, they couldn\u2019t because they didn\u2019t \u2014 she liked look any other poor person in Vienna.\nShe had dyed red hair, and very \u2014 dressed very ordinarily, and heaven knows where she\ngot her clothes from. She wasn\u2019t in uniform when she came to my office. She was too\nsensible for that, and she had guts actually to come to the office, but her story was true.\nAnd I remember the Polish person, and often when we go to \u2014 out in the evening in\nVienna, we would meet Russian officers who were Jews in the Russian army who were\nnot going to defect. They were Russians, but when you had a husband and a daughter in\nPalestine, of course, you were going to defect if you could.",
        "Q: How did the husband and the daughter get to Palestine? Do you know?",
        "A: They must have gone when war started, or before war started. I have no idea. I didn\u2019t ask\nher that question, but they probably went \u2014 that\u2019s right, they couldn\u2019t have gone legally.\nThey must have gone the long way around \u2014 the land route as we call it, go through\nSiberia, and then make their way down.",
        "Q: Did you ever have a circumstance where the story was really not true and you had to say\nno to somebody?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember such a story. I don\u2019t think they would\u2019ve had the guts to come to us\nbecause they didn\u2019t know how we respond, I think. They may have been \u2014 we had\nGermans who tried to pass themselves off as displaced persons, as Jews, in order to get to\nthe United States, and sometimes somebody, let\u2019s say, at Bremen when they\u2019d pass and\nthey had their visa, would recognize them as having been in a concentration camp, had\nbeen one of the workers there, and of course they had to be imprisoned for their own\nsafety, but we discovered very early on that when a German held up his arms, his blood\ngroup number was tattooed under his arm. So, if we were suspicious, we could ask the\ndoctor or somebody to examine him, but I\u2019m sure Germans got through as Jewish\ndisplaced persons and probably lived a life as Jews. People try all kinds of things and get\naway with it.",
        "Q: Are there any other situations in Austria you would like to tell us about before we move\nto your next?",
        "A: Well, some of the things we did in Austria, we had to use our wits. I think that\u2019s\nessentially the thing. For example, I don\u2019t know if I had told you earlier about the people\nwho had visas for Uruguay?",
        "Q: No, tell us.",
        "A: And I knew that their relatives actually were living in Para\u2014I beg your pardon in the\nArgentine. Well, obviously, the Argentine at that time was not giving visas to Jews, and\nso the relatives over there were sensible or smart, they got visas for Paraguay and we\nwould get transit visas for the Argentine that one could get, and when they got to the\nArgentine, they had ways of whisking them off. So, I remember I would sometimes have\nto go up to Prague because that\u2019s where the consulate was, and I remember having a large\nfamily of about 13 people \u2014 Schmuck Lieberman and another name. I don\u2019t remember\nthem now. And I went into the consulate, and they weren\u2019t very ready to give visas\nbecause they consuls made their living, in a way, from the visa fees they charged. You\nknow, they were honorary consuls; they weren\u2019t civil servants. And so I would go in and\nvery brazenly say, \u201cOf course, I know your secretary will have to work extra time, and if\nthere\u2019s anything we could do to compensate for that we would be very happy.\u201d My way\nof offering a bribe, which was gladly accepted, and I would get these visas, and very\ndiscreetly in an envelope leave my payment and walk out. But, you see, people who\nhadn\u2019t been used to having to \u2014 what\u2019s the word? \u2014 find their way, wouldn\u2019t do this kind\nof thing, and I remember the very nice woman who was running the Prague office for the\nAmerican Joint was astounded that I could come to her within one day and show her that\nI had 13 visas. \u201cYou must have paid,\u201d she said. I said, \u201cWho would dream of paying?\u201d\nYou couldn\u2019t even tell your own what you were doing because if they didn\u2019t know\nthemselves how to do it, you could never teach them how.",
        "Q: How do you think you picked this up? Knowing how to arrange things, because you\u2019re\nright, people say, \u201cI don\u2019t pay for things. I don\u2019t barter for things. I simply do-\u201d",
        "A: Well, you had to know. I think you knew you had to do something. You had to get these\nvisas. You had to get these people out, and if you couldn\u2019t do it by being honest, since the\nArgentineans weren\u2019t offering visas, you had to do it dishonestly. I didn\u2019t think I was\ndoing anything dishonest because I was helping people to join relatives, and you thought\nof a thousand ways. How did people survive who didn\u2019t land in concentration camp, if\nthey didn\u2019t think of a thousand ruses to survive? And I suppose this is part of it.",
        "Q: So, but there is a difference because you said a number of times that you didn\u2019t want to\ndo anything that was illegal.",
        "A: Not if I could help it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But, when I had to get visas for the Argentine, transit visas, and I knew that the only way\nto get them was for the relatives to get the Paraguayan visas, there was no problem, and if\nI knew, as I did, that the consul was not anxious even to give transit visas to Jews, then\nyou had to get them by other means. I mean, look at the people who landed up in\nShanghai, before and during the war. They had no more intention of staying in Shanghai\nthen you or I would have had, but this was their way of getting out of Germany.",
        "Q: How did you distinguish between what was illegal and what was just sort of pushing the\nenvelope?",
        "A: I never even thought about what was legal or illegal. I did everything to my knowledge\nlegally, but when I had to help families get to a country that didn\u2019t want them, but I knew\nthey relatives could help them to stay there, and the general community wasn\u2019t against\nthem coming in, why not?",
        "Q: Amy, when you took this job \u2014 actually, did you start to get paid at any point?",
        "A: Yes, I did. After three years, Dr. Schwartz asked me if I\u2019d like to come on to the\nAmerican Joint\u2019s payroll, and I said I thought that would be nice because by then I mean,\nI was very broke. I had no money, and he offered me a salary at that time. It wasn\u2019t very\nhigh, but it was much more than I\u2019d been getting as a volunteer, and I felt, \u201cWell, three\nyears of voluntary service, I had paid my way.\u201d",
        "Q: So, does that mean, was it \u201946 or \u201947?",
        "A: This was in forty \u2014 toward the end of \u201946, I came on to the JDC payroll.",
        "Q: That was nice.",
        "A: No, I had to. I had no money.",
        "Q: But let me ask you something. You were in 1945, 26?",
        "A: No, no, 25.",
        "Q: Twenty-five years old, and you had this job of bringing-",
        "A: Helping people to-",
        "Q: Helping people to get-",
        "A: To the United States.",
        "Q: Did you think about yourself at this very young person doing this wonderful-?",
        "A: No, never. I take it for granted that I could do it. I didn\u2019t even think of it as \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nthink that I took it for granted. This was a job, and this was something I could do. I knew\nthat I had administrative ability. I knew that I knew how to work with people, and \u2014 but I\nnever thought of myself as doing anything special. I was always very pleased, for\nexample, when I could do something like I did for these people going to Paraguay\nostensibly and get their visas, because I helped them. I\u2019ve got pictures at home of them at\nthe railroad station. I took them to the station. We always gave flowers when people left.\nThat was quite European. You always presented people with flowers when they left.",
        "Q: Was that your idea?",
        "A: No, no, no, this was generally done, and I\u2019ve got, you know, the father with the beard,\nand they would have many kids with them, and I\u2019m sure many of those children were not\ntheir own, but how could you prove it. They had no original documents with them. They\nprobably were children of relatives, and why should I ask questions? We were saving\nyoung lives. It was something one took for granted, one did. During the war, the kinds of\nthings we did in Britain, you never thought of yourself as being anything special. You\njust did it.",
        "Q: Were there other people \u2014 were most of the people working for you your age? Were they\nmuch older? Were they younger?",
        "A: Some were older. Some were younger.",
        "Q: So, it was mixed?",
        "A: Mixed. Some of the men were older, quite a bit older, but it\u2019s interesting. I never thought\nof age in those days. I never thought that somebody was older or younger. Occasionally,\nyou would find you came into an office like when I came into Vienna, and there was a\nman working there much older than I who was very entrepreneurial, and I didn\u2019t trust him\nany further than I could throw a grand piano, and I knew I had to get rid of him. And it\ntook a little time, but very graciously, we paid him off and got him out because he was\ndishonest. He was taking money from people to get them visas, and that, to me, was\nanathema. So, I won\u2019t tell you his name. I remember it.",
        "Q: You do, but you won\u2019t tell right? So, what happened in 1948? You then got -",
        "A: Oh, in 1948, this was an interesting year. The Americans passed the Displaced Persons\nAct, the first one where displaced persons if they had job and housing assurances, could\nget visas for the United States. It didn\u2019t depend on which country they had lived. In other\nwords, it wasn\u2019t a quota system. And this was fascinating because, one day, I don\u2019t know\nif it was a Friday or a Saturday, we were in the office \u2014 I must say we didn\u2019t know\nwhether it was Monday or Tuesday or Saturday or Sunday when we worked \u2014 Mr. Gruzo\nand Henry Rosenfeld and some others from the Displaced Persons Commission in\nWashington appeared in my office, charming gentleman. They were ready to issue visas\nunder the Displaced Persons Act. Well, I assure you that none of the voluntary agency\npersonnel of all the agencies knew the first thing about what we were supposed to have\nhad, but they were ready to issue visas. And so, I said to them, \u201cUnfortunately, my job\nand housing assurances are at the printers, but if you\u2019d write one out for me. I'll take it\nover to the allianz gebaude,\u201d which was the American building where they had\nmimeograph machines, \u201cIll get some printed out, and you can start work.\u201d And so they\nwere very nice gentlemen. They wrote it down. I took it over, and came back with 50 or\n60, and we took the cases in my office and everyone they thought was eligible, I gave a\njob and housing assurance to, and pumps!, a few days later they were issuing the visas.\nThe next day, or perhaps that evening, I called our Munich office of the American Joint\nand told the man who was director there what we were doing and gave him the wording\nso that when these people arrived in Munich, they would be ready, and quite a number of\npeople got visas. In about ten days, a message came through from the United States from\nthe United Service for New Americans, which was our cooperating agency. They\ncontacted all the communities in the United States where there were relatives and actually\narranged the immigration of relatives to relatives or of people without relatives to people\nwho were offering them jobs and housing. They were very efficient. But they cabled our\nParis office saying, \u201cWhat Amy Zahl is doing is illegal. Tell her to stop immediately.\u201d\nAnd Harold Trobe who was director of the joint operation in Austria called me and said,\n\u201cAmy, I\u2019ve had this cable.\u201d And I said, \u201cHmm, very interesting. We will stop.\u201d And, of\ncourse, what I did, I went into the American Consulate where they were very cooperative,\nlet me put it that way, it was a very nice consul. Sometimes the consuls were not at all\ncooperative. In times when life was a stake before the war, the consuls were not very\ncooperative, but these people were very helpful. I looked through all the Jewish cases I\ncould find whether they were registered with the Joint Distribution Committee or with\nHIAS (ph), or not registered with an agency, and gave them all job and housing\nassurances, and then I stopped. Now, what happened as a result was these people got\nvisas. They were sent up to Bremen, and they were on the ships going to the States in\nlarger numbers than non-Jews sponsored by non-Jewish agencies because they hadn\u2019t had\nthis first encounter with the Displaced Persons Commission, and the press in New York\nwas rather anti-Semitic, you know, \u201conly Jews are getting visas.\u201d You can look up the\npress at the time and see these notices. What we did, of course, was to tell the Christian\nagencies what we had done, told them what the wording was so they could get started,\nbut I think we had more support from our agency than they had from theirs. I know when\nit came to children, for example, I was always horrified both when I was in Austria and\nlater in Germany to find children \u2014 and, when I say children, I mean youngsters under 18\n\u2014 still either in hostels or in camps. Although the American \u2014 I\u2019ve got the name of the\nagency, the refugee agency taking care of orphans \u2014 was working, they were working\nvery slowly, and I just couldn\u2019t bear the thought that there were kids without families still\nsitting in Austria and this is what? 18 months after the war ended. And so, what we\nwould do is take these children and take them away from the other agency, and get them\nvisas to go to the States. It was exciting in that you thought you were helping people, and\nbecause we could work so efficiently, we saw the results in a very short time. When I\nfinished the first batch in Austria, Dr. Schwartz came to me again in the October of 46,\nand said would I go into Germany and take over the operation there? With working very\nsuccessfully in Austria and I had very good assistance working in the Vienna office.\nEverybody was strained. I always worked as though I was leaving tomorrow. It was a\ngood way to work because it meant if I wanted to take time off, the office would\nfunction, the files would be working, and I felt that none of us should try to make\nourselves indispensable. We, after all, were working to save people\u2019s lives. I always felt\nthat. And so, on October the 28\", 1948, I came up into Munich, which was the head\noffice for the German operation, and there was chaos. The staff there were on strike.\nAbout 200 letters a day were coming in from the States because the American operations,\nas I mentioned earlier, were very efficient, and there was nobody working. They were on\nstrike. They wanted better pay. I was horrified. I came into the office and a young\nwoman, an American, Gladys Roth, was running the office at that time, and I wanted her\nto take over the volkcaserna (ph), where people went in order to get processed for\nAmerica. She was a very efficient worker, very sympathetic, spoke excellent Hungarian,\nspoke some German, and was a good worker. She too felt you had to help these people to\nget out \u2014 a wonderful sense of humor, by the way. She was a lifesaver. And I called these\npeople together who were on strike, and I said I would look into their salary claims, but\nnot unless they came back to work because what they were doing was stopping people\nleaving and they themselves were being stopped from leaving. So, this doesn\u2019t make\nsense to me. And I said, \u201cIll expect you all in the office tomorrow morning.\u201d I went to\nthe office in the morning and there was some staff, and the next morning there were a few\nmore, and I let word out that if the rest didn\u2019t come back to work by the end of the week I\nwas going to employ new people. They were all back. There were some troublemakers.\nFor example, the way they had been operating was if people had to go to Paris to pick up\ntransit visas, they would hire coaches on the trains, and two of the boys who worked in\nthe office would go on the train to Paris. Well, you know what this leaves them open to.\nThey could take cigarettes. They could do bribes. I don\u2019t know what they did, but I knew\nthis had to stop, and I let it go on for a little while. You don\u2019t change things immediately,\nand one day I said, \u201cYou know, we have to let these people really go out on their own so\nthat they face the world for the first time. So, let\u2019s try one train without you on it.\u201d Well,\nno, they found a thousand reasons, but I was very firm and the first train went off, and\nwas successful. And then I announced that no more would we have to accompany these\npeople. That was my way of handling that, and then in December, they decided to go on\nstrike again. I was 1n trouble because I didn\u2019t know what I could offer. Sam Haber was\nrunning the operation. He was a tough guy to cope with, and I said I would see them the\nnext day, and talk to them. I came to the office, and there was not a soul 1n sight. And I\nfelt, \u201cI have failed.\u201d I was so horrified, and what could I do, and my office was on the\nthird floor of this building, and I went up to the office and I opened the door and there\nwas a great big shout, \u201cHappy Birthday!\u201d I had forgotten it was my birthday, and they\nwere all up there. I wept. I was so astounded to find them all there, and friends, obviously\nthey were now my friends. I\u2019ve still got the birthday card they made me out of a manila\nfolder, that big and they\u2019d all signed it, and that was wonderful. From then on, we got\nalong very well. The men who had accompanied the people to Paris, I helped to\nimmigrate very quickly. I thought that was the best thing for them. And I tried not to\nemploy people who would have to immigrate now. The Czechs \u2014 you may not know this\nhistorically, you may know it better than I \u2014 had thrown out the volksdeutsch, and there\nwere some lovely young people amongst those who came into Germany who, through no\nfault of their own, were thrown out as revenge, and I employed some of these girls. I\nmade sure they hadn\u2019t been members of the BDM, the Bund Deutscher Mddel, and by the\nway, it was easy to check it because the Germans were so methodical, they had lists. So, I\nemployed these people, but then the rabbis were insulted. I was employing non-Jews\nwhen Jews needed jobs, and I met with them, and I said, \u201cMy job is to get the Jews out of\nhere who don\u2019t belong here, and the only way I can do that is to employ non-Jews who\nare clean and let the others get out.\u201d Some of these girls married Jewish boys. They were\nlovely girls, and they worked very efficiently, but these were some of the hurdles one had\nto cope with. The rabbis were always watching that we did the right thing. For example, I\nhad permission to send what we called \u201chighly pregnant women\u201d, women in their eighth\nmonth, by air to the States because if they couldn\u2019t leave and they had babies, they\ncouldn\u2019t go on these cargo \u2014 not cargo, these military ships and the visa might expire. It\nwas only good for four months. I had an arrangement with Air France. For every ten\npeople I put on a plane, I got one free seat. And so these women would come to me, you\nknow, \u201cI\u2019m in my ninth month.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m in my eighth month.\u201d And I got to the stage when I\ncould look at a woman, and say, \u201cYou\u2019re seven and a half months pregnant. You have\ntime.\u201d It was very funny because we played jokes together. I\u2019m just remembering this.\nWe sent a lot of people by air. Now, some of the ships sailed on a Saturday and the\nOrthodox Jews would not sail on Saturday. Some of the planes went on Friday evening.\nWe made arrangements with the captains of the planes and the captains of the ships. On\nthe planes, the passengers were allowed to embark before the Sabbath came in, therefore\nit was their home. They were allowed to get onto the ship the day before the Sabbath, so\nthat this already was their home, and there was no problem. But, you had to think of all\nkinds of things to stop people from staying behind. Occasionally, you\u2019d have somebody\nwho was having a pair of trousers made, and therefore he couldn\u2019t leave. It wasn\u2019t that he\nwas having trousers made. In a sense, a lot of these people were scared to leave. I think\nthat\u2019s what I thought about them, and so I would call his tailor and if he was having\ntrousers made, I used to tell him, \u201c\u201cYou have to have them by tonight because otherwise\nhe\u2019s going to lose his visa.\u201d The tailors were usually pretty good. They were either\ndisplaced pers- mostly displaced persons or Germans, and they knew what was\nhappening and they would finish the pants, and these people would go on. I only once\nmet a man in New York when I was there who at some kind of gathering, he looked at me\nand said, \u201cZie haben mae swandon heir sukammen.\u201d (ph) He was a German Jew who said\nI forced him to come to America, and his wife said, \u201cIgnore him.\u201d But, he was a man who\nwas having pants made. It was fascinating working with those people. People had all\nkinds of excuses for not going, and I really felt they were scared. After all, some of them\nwere coming to relatives they haven\u2019t seen since before the war or they had never seen. A\nmother\u2019s relative who had come a generation ago. I can understand it. I would be\nhorrified to have to go to a relative who was going to support me who I didn\u2019t know, or\nmy mother had told me stories they didn\u2019t like. It was fascinating, fascinating, but you\nhad to get \u2014 firstly, you had to get these people out of Germany. They were not wanted in\nGermany. There was no future for them in Germany. And secondly, one knew that once\nthey got to the States, they could begin to rebuild for themselves and the new children\nthey had. It was fortunate that so many of them did have children because this gave them\na future. They were concerned for their children, and that was one of the reasons for\nleaving. We also had situations where non-Jews had helped Jews in hiding, and I\nremember Andre Bulova\u2019s sister, Bulova watch company, his sister was a Mrs. Godem\n(ph) came to see me, and for some reason, she liked me. She said, \u201cDo you have people\nyou would like to help and you can\u2019t.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, P\u2019ve got heads of families who are\nnon-Jews.\u201d And we essentially helped families where the head of the family was a Jew\nbecause they would fit into a new community. She said, \u201cI will give you affidavits worth\na million dollars each, and you send them to my brother and we will find jobs for them.\u201d\nAnd there was one man who had hidden his wife through the war, and he did beautiful\nwork, enamel on silver, and he brought in several \u2014 I shall never forget this \u2014 several\nsmall dishes in a way to show me of work he did. It was all very beautiful, and when I\ntold Mrs. Godem, because she would come back and forth, she said, \u201c\u201cHe can do watch\ncovers. My brother would be very pleased to see him.\u201d And this man said to me, \u201cWhich\none do you like the best?\u201d Well, I knew he was saying to me, \u201cI will give you that one.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cThey\u2019re all beautiful.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t admire any, and the only gift I ever have or had\nfrom a survivor or from a refugee was a dish he sent to me. He knew I wouldn\u2019t take it.\nWe allowed them to bring flowers to the office, and sometimes it looked like a mortuary,\nthere were so many flowers, but gifts were forbidden because gifts lead to bribes. But I\nhave at home still this lovely tray he gave me. It\u2019s a dish about six inches in diameter, St.\nGeorge and the Dragon. I think he must have made it for me. And, they did very well in\nthe States. We had some wonderful people, we really did, who immigrated to the States,\nand America is richer for them. It really is. The operation in Germany went quite\nsuccessfully, I would say, because we got all the offices to work in the same fashion. We\nset up some of the filing systems. When we had people from Austria who came into\nGermany, we had the same system for handing them. There was one case of a young man\nwho I sent ostensibly to the States via Germany. His name was Miklaus Rezmowitz. He\nwas Hungarian. I had found him on the streets in Vienna, and what I did, I got the Joint\noffice to set up a small hostel for me where if I put kids there, they had a whole sheet to\nthemselves on the bed, and I tried to find them jobs, and I tried to get them out of the\ncountry as soon as possible. And I sent Mickey through Germany to the States. When I\ncame to Germany 18 months later, somebody told me \u2014 because there always was a\ngrapevine \u2014 that Mickey was working in a garage in Munich and I was horrified. This\nsweet little boy, to me he was a baby. And I got him to come to my office and he told me\nwhen he got to Munich, for some reason something happened and the visa wasn\u2019t picked\nup and nobody helped him, and he didn\u2019t want to write and tell me because I\u2019d been so\nkind to him, and so he let his visa lapse. Well, I started immediately to work on his visa,\nand discovered he had a brother in Sweden. I may have mentioned to you that even to this\nday, people are finding relatives. His brother had escaped to Sweden and was there, and I\ndecided when I eventually got Mickey\u2019s visa, I would bring the brother in from Sweden.\nEventually, we got a visa for Mickey, and I got his brother to come and we put him up in\nour apartment \u2014 I was sharing an apartment with three, two other girls, and the next\nmorning we brought the brother to the office \u2014 I\u2019ve got pictures of him \u2014 and where was\nMickey? He was no where to be found. He was out philandering somewhere, and when I\nbrought him to the office, and he met his brother for the first time since they were both\ntaken away, you can imagine the scene. It was wonderful. I then met Mickey again in\nNew York, and he told me he was so appreciative of what America did for him, he was\njoining the army. It was the Korean war, and I\u2019ve never heard from him since. So, I\u2019m\ngoing to the museum in Washington tomorrow to see if I, hopefully, don\u2019t find him on\nthe list that I should look at. But there were some wonderful stories. As I say, ve got\npictures of these two brothers in my office. There were some wonderful stories, and the\nolder men I employed in the office, some of them had come back from Shanghai, took\ncare of these youngsters for me, and behaved like fathers, you know, made sure they were\nin on time. It just was a very nice atmosphere in that place and made it easy to work.",
        "Q: Was this a much bigger operation that you had in Austria?",
        "A: A much, much bigger. Most of the displaced persons in Germany were in the American\nzone of Germany. It was a much bigger operation. I can tell you some interesting stories\nof things that happened because people think the camps were liberated and suddenly\nthere were no more camps, but there were the displaced persons camps, and let\u2019s say\npeople wanted to get to Canada, but how? They were ineligible for the United States\nbecause they didn\u2019t fit in with the criterion which was necessary to immigrate to the\nUnited States, and Canada would be offering a scheme to bring in tailors, or furriers.\nWell, the ORT organization was wonderful in Germany. We got doctors and lawyers to\ntrain as furriers. They could operate the same machines and they passed the exam, and\ncame to Canada, and they worked as doctors and as lawyers. They took their exams\nagain, and they were of benefit to Canada. Canada was foolish in many instances because\nthey were looking for brawn. They weren\u2019t looking for brain. America was much more\naware of what was available because of the kinds of refugees they had taken in at the\nbeginning or before the war, and so America got all kinds, but Canada took a long time to\nwake up. But what we would do again \u2014 we wanted it to help these people get out and if\nall they were taken was furriers, well you train these people as furriers, and they came to\nCanada. I don\u2019t think the consuls knew. I\u2019m sure that the people in Canada knew what we\nwere doing, but you know, you\u2019d get out 25 families at a time. It was wonderful.",
        "Q: So, who would do this training? Did you say to the DP camp personnel, \u201cIn order to get\nthis people out, train them as such and such\u201d? How would that work?",
        "A: Okay, good question. If we heard, because we all were constantly being fed information\nthat the Canadian government was looking for 50 furriers. We would pass word to the\nrepresentative of the Joint in the camp that the Canadians were looking for 50 furriers. He\nknew through discussion with us that what these people had to be able to show the\nrepresentatives of the government was that they knew how to operate the sewing machine\nthat took fur, that they knew how to cut fur, or they knew how to stitch, and by golly, the\nORT representative in the camp really showed them how. They trained very quickly, and\nwhen they came for the exams, they passed perfectly.",
        "Q: So, how were these people chosen do you think? Do you have any idea?",
        "A: They volunteered.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: If a doctor was hoping that he could go somewhere and work as a doctor, but saw that it\nwas useless, he\u2019d go anywhere because he knew once he got to that new country, he\ncould take exams again and work in his profession. People were not afraid to do the\ndirtiest menial work in order to get out of Germany, number one, and secondly, they\nwanted to set up a new life and start life again. So, they were very ready to do anything\nthat they could do to get out.",
        "Q: Now, was ORT the major or the only organization in the DP camps training people or\nwere there a number of different kinds?",
        "A: In the Jewish camps, and it was mainly ORT, I don\u2019t know of another organization that\nwas working. ORT trained people in mechanics. They trained \u2014 they still work today, by\nthe way. That organization was started in Russia, I think, after the First World War. It\u2019s\nan extraordinary organization. It still works around the world. It was the ORT which had\nmany, many training centers set up. They had good people. Very often they were\ndisplaced persons who were experts in their field training other displaced persons. They\nwere very well organized and they did a beautiful job.",
        "Q: Because a lot of the people who were in the DP camps were too young to have even\ngotten a profession. Right? They had gone through their teenage years sometimes, late\nteenage years, and hadn\u2019t finished.",
        "A: People who were in displaced persons camps, there were very few who were teenagers.",
        "Q: No, but their teenage years may have been through the war. So, they may have lost their\nlast couple of years of school.",
        "A: They may have. Yes, they may have been in their twenties. They certainly had lost\nschooling. They didn\u2019t have formal education. There weren\u2019t too many individual young\npeople. There weren\u2019t too many families with children who were in their twenties.\nFamilies were decimated, you have to remember, totally decimated, and if there \u2014 excuse\nme \u2014 if there were young people, they were individuals, and you\u2019re quite right, they had\nlost their schooling. They had no training. Firstly, they hadn\u2019t been to college. They\nhadn\u2019t gone to technical school, and they had no training in occupations. ORT was a\nGodsend. ORT was a Godsend to them.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something about the young women who were having babies. There was a\nletter written by Kaufman who was the head of the Jewish Agency for Palestine who\napparently visited the DP camps, and wrote, whether rightly or wrongly, that these young\nwomen who were having babies don\u2019t know how to be mothers, we have to send women\nhere to train these young women because these babies are coming and they don\u2019t know\nwhat to do or they don\u2019t even want to. Did you find in the DP camps where you were\nvisiting that this was not an easy time?",
        "A: Well, first thing, we had social workers in the camps. Secondly, this gentleman wasn\u2019t\naware, perhaps, that these young women had lost their mothers who normally would\u2019 ve\nhelped them through this period, and there were no older women around who\u2019d had\nbabies. They had been killed off. But they soon learned. These women had mother\u2019s\ninstinct. They were so thrilled to have babies, to start again. The men who were their\nhusbands, because there was no license there, there weren\u2019t women who weren\u2019t married\nhaving babies. These were young women who were married and having children, starting\na life again, starting a family again. They were very careful. I think they all cared. Some\nof them probably were better than others, but even in our society, we have women who\nare better than others in rearing children. But it was wonderful for us when they first\nstarted to get pregnant, because while they were incarcerated or in hiding, most women\ndidn\u2019t even menstruate. They only started to menstruate again when they were free. It\u2019s\nan interesting phenomenon how nature takes care of itself.",
        "Q: Do you know \u2014 do we know about how long it took for women to start menstruating\nagain?",
        "A: Yes, I think it must have been more than a year, even up to two years.",
        "Q: That long?",
        "A: Yes. It was more than a year because I remember being in the camps in Germany when\nthere was much rejoicing and we had to order from the States these sanitary napkins for\nthe women and condoms, by the way, because women were getting pregnant.",
        "Q: So, there were not condoms in the beginning?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No, right.",
        "A: Where would the condoms come from? They were ordered, which was rather nice. You\nknow, you \u2014 I had never thought of that. Who ever thinks of that kind of thing? You\nknow, a single girl brought up properly, but it was wonderful that they were even\nthinking about planning their families.",
        "Q: So, did they ask for condoms?",
        "A: I would assume so. They didn\u2019t ask of me, and I didn\u2019t officially know of this. I knew\nfrom the other people working in the camps that this was happening.",
        "Q: So, people were trying to be very careful knowing that-",
        "A: Yeah, if they had one baby, they didn\u2019t want another baby immediately. After all, they\nwere no grandparents who were going to rejoice in these children. There were no families\nthat were going to help them bring up these children. They were going into a new world\nall on their own, and a lot of these people in the camps wanted to go to the United States.\nThey did not want to go to Palestine. I\u2019m talking before the State of Israel. They very\ndefinitely wanted to go to the United States because a large percentage of them had\nfamily in the States, a large percentage, and I think they wanted to get away as far as they\ncould from the Russians and away from Europe and the Middle East. That was another\nfactor. And America still held out the dream for a lot of these people.",
        "Q: Was there \u2014 from what you remember as opposed to what you know from history \u2014 do\nyou remember a tension between Zionists and non-Zionists, because clearly the Zionists\nwanted people to say they wanted to go to Palestine.",
        "A: There was a lot of tension. There was a lot of tension between the non-Zionists and the\nZionists. Some people were almost forced to go to Palestine. I know I would give people\nletters to say they were registered with me for the United States so that they could not be\nforced onto a transport to Palestine. Remember also, at this time, there was a lot of illegal\nimmigration into Palestine and these people didn\u2019t want to go. They\u2019d suffered enough\nfrom their point of view. They had not been Zionists because if their parents had been\nZionists, they would have left Poland before the war and gone to Palestine. When one\nthinks of it, very few Jews really were going to Palestine from Poland, where there was\ntremendous poverty, tremendous anti-Semitism, long before the Hitler regime, and they\ndidn\u2019t go. It was a very difficult time for a lot of people, but it was a political situation\nand they were pushing these people to go. I was never in favor of it, I must say.",
        "Q: Do you remember Ben-Gurion visiting the DP camps?",
        "A: He came. Yes, he came up into the British zone. I didn\u2019t see him, but I remember that he\ncame and in certain camps where, for example, Yosele Rosensaft was heading the camp\nat Belsen. Yosele who was getting everybody to go to Palestine except he. He came to the\nUnited States with his wife. Ben-Gurion was up there. What Ben-Gurion did arrange was\nthat some of the children who had survived who the Zionists and Belsen would not allow\nto come to England, Martin Gilbert has written a book about the boys, well these were\nsome of the boys who might have been. They were not allowing these kids to come but,\nBen-Gurion spoke to Yosele and some others in the camp, and we did get a transport out\nof Belsen of youngsters to England, and these kids had sat there for so long, they were so\nill so many of them because they wanted the men to go to Israel because they didn\u2019t like\ngoing to Spevan (ph), and they didn\u2019t like the British Government policy and so the kids\nsuffered. They were used as political pawns. But Ben-Gurion, I must say, helped to ease\nthat situation.",
        "Q: So, these people in obviously \u2014 the war ends and life is hard as always.",
        "A: It resumes normally, politically among Jews who are Zionists and Jews who are not\nZionists. It resumes as it was before the war. People don\u2019t change, situations change.",
        "Q: Were people taught English or were they taught other languages when they were coming\nto the United States?",
        "A: Yes, there were courses, and there were other courses run for people who were\ncoming to the States or to English-speaking countries and numbers of refugees took\nadvantage of that. Once they knew they were going to get a visa, they were very good\nabout learning to speak the language.",
        "Q: Were there a lot of, or some, breakdowns of people who could not adjust to the loss of\nnot having a family, even if they got married? Did you notice it?",
        "A: Well, there were people who were depressed. There were people who were depressed,\nvery understandably, when you found you had a young man who had seen his parents and\nbrothers taken off and some policeman or another had pushed him to the side because\nthey had known each other on the street, and saved him and he found our none of his\nfamily had survived. A tremendous guilt feeling of being alive, and how do you help\npeople to get over that. Some people never did or never have. I know people who\nsurvived who have never gotten over the fact that they are the sole survivors of their\nfamily. Sometimes they\u2019ll find a person who lived in the same town who went through a\nsimilar experience, and they are as close as brother and sister or brothers because they\nshared similar experience. People are still suffering, and that\u2019s why I think, for many,\nmany years, most of the people who survived the war were not able to tell their children\nof their experiences. People say, \u201cWell, why is it only now this is coming to light?\u201d It\u2019s\nbeen very hard to talk about it, very hard.",
        "Q: So, why do you think now?",
        "A: Now, because time has passed and the children are asking the right question. The children\nare adult enough to be kind to their parents in the sense that they will ask the question\nkindly. The grandchildren ask the questions, and they\u2019re gradually loosening up as well.\nSome people have been for counseling. Some didn\u2019t need the counseling. Some needed to\ntell the story in order to ease their own souls, their own conscience. People felt very\nguilty about remaining alive.",
        "Q: [Pause.] How many people do you think you got out of Germany and Austria, if you had\nto put numbers on that?",
        "A: Well, I would think that we helped about 40,000 to get to the United States, and when\nyou think that each one was an individual visa, nothing was en masse. We worked seven\ndays a week, all the hours that were given us, and we never thought of it at that time. I\nused to skip out sometimes on a Sunday and go fishing, in fact. I love trout fishing, and\nonce I got caught fishing in illegal waters.",
        "Q: Is that your one illegal act?",
        "A: No, but a bottle of scotch handled that quite nicely. We used to be able to buy scotch at\nseven and sixpence a bottle, which was just over a dollar.",
        "Q: Did you keep the trout and cook it?",
        "A: No, no, when we caught them, we threw them back. That wasn\u2019t cricket. You didn\u2019t keep\nthe trout. You just caught it and threw it back. I didn\u2019t fish to have fish to eat.",
        "Q: You just fished for the-",
        "A: Sometimes we did. No, I\u2019m telling the truth completely. Sometimes we did, but that\u2019s\nright \u2014 the guy who drove us out \u2014 his mother used to clean them for us, because he used\nto fish also. But I didn\u2019t realize, actually, that we were fishing in illegal waters. This man\nwho was one of our drivers took us there, and he said, \u201cThis is where you can fish.\u201d So,\nwe fished until a policeman came up. And I was horrified. You know, really, I\u2019m the\ndirector of immigration of the American Joint Distribution Committee. I was petrified\nalso that I might be jailed, but my friend, Gladys Roth, had a way. She was very good.\nShe was a marvelous worker. Unfortunately, she died a few years ago. She would have\nhad wonderful stories to tell. She did a tremendous job and helped a tremendous number\nof people. We had some very fine people working with us. There was another woman\nwho came up from South Africa, another volunteer. South Africa also had volunteers. A\nwoman called Hannah Kisch who worked in my office in Munich who did a beautiful\njob. She was from Latvia and spoke beautiful Yiddish, and people loved her. She did a\nvery good job, and despite the fact that she was rather an emotional woman, was able to\nforget this, and when she had to bawl somebody out because they\u2019d done something that\nwasn\u2019t good, she could do it in the kind of Yiddish that they understood. She was a lovely\nwoman. We did have some wonderful women working with us, and some men, but\nmostly they were women. They did a tremendous job.",
        "Q: And what was the relationship between the zones with respect to the work? In Germany,\nwere you traveling between the zones more easily?",
        "A: Oh, yes, I didn\u2019t \u2014 never went into the Russian zone, and I never went into Berlin because\nI was told my name was on a list, and I didn\u2019t know whether this was true or not. After\nall, I had helped Russians to immigrate, and I was playing safe. Also, I was scared, and so\nI never went into the Russian zone in Germany or never went into Berlin. To this day,\nI\u2019ve not been to Berlin. I hope to go soon. I\u2019m hoping to find papers of the\nReichsfertreitung, the Jewish community organization, when I get there because none\nsome to have survived, and they did a fantastic job, but-",
        "Q: So, you went into the French zone and the British zone?",
        "A: Oh, yes, constantly up and down, up and down.",
        "Q: And you were obviously sometimes doing work for those people, as well.",
        "A: Oh, yes, and then I would take a group of people, let\u2019s say down to Genoa to get on a\nship, and I would escort them to the border. The police were wonderful at the Brenna (ph)\nPass. The Italians got to know me, and they would tell me, \u201cThe train\u2019s going to be a half\nhour, three-quarters of an hour late. Why don\u2019t you go to bed, and when we know the\ntrain\u2019s coming, we\u2019ll wake you?\u201d And, so I\u2019d go to the hotel, sometimes the train was an\nhour late, and somehow I'd hear the police shouting up at me or banging on the door, and\nI\u2019d get up. I had all the passports for these people, couldn\u2019t give passports out, and I\nwould accompany them down to Genoa, and the catabaneri (ph) in Genoa were very\ngood. They\u2019d invite me down to the docks, make sure that I had somebody with me, and\ntake me to the hotel and make sure that I had my room with a side doors locked, because\nmany hotels had rooms adjoining with doors that were unlocked. They always made sure\nthat the doors were locked before they would allow me into the hotels. They were very\nnice people. I was in Genoa maybe every three or four weeks. There was a wonderful\nwoman working for the Joint there called Elia Eliaskovitch her name was. She had come\nto Italy to study Anthropology before the war, got stuck there, and the catabaneri gave\nher a certificate to say that she was a Catholic. She survived all through the war, Elka\nEliaskovitch. I lost touch with her, but she knew every consul in Genoa, and she would\njust take me. We would get the visas that we needed and then she would take me down to\nthe shipping agents because shipping was very difficult to get, and she would always\nmanage to get shipping. She was a wonderful woman. She landed up I think in California,\nbut I never heard from her after she left. We did have some wonderful characters working\nin this total program.",
        "Q: So, you had to take all the passports together and put them en masse on the ship?",
        "A: No, no, what I did was I was getting the visas for all these people. So, I needed all the\npassports together, and I couldn\u2019t give them back to the people because I wanted them all\ntogether and to go. They only got their passports when they were getting on the ship.",
        "Q: I see. Okay, we\u2019re going to take another break.",
        "A: Is this making sense? Yeah?\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: Amy, I wanted to give people a sense of what the 1948 DP Immigration Act brought as\nopposed to what the Truman Directive was in 1945. What was the difference? I mean,\nwhat happened because of the Immigration Act?",
        "A: Well, it was very different from the Truman Directive. That gave the first ray of hope to\npeople that they might get to the United States, but when they passed the DP Act, this\nwas the first time, really, that people could come to the United States outside of a quota\nnumber and on the basis of a job and housing assurance which somebody perhaps they\ndidn\u2019t know had given them. Whereas, before affidavits were generally given by close\nrelatives who undertook, of course, to ensure that they would not be come a charge on\npublic funds. This was a totally different concept, and the Truman government at the time\nreally is to be congratulated in having shown a humanitarian aspect of US immigration\nlaw which until then had really kept people out.",
        "Q: So, this made a big different to your work?",
        "A: It made a tremendous difference because we could offer hope to many more people that\nthey could get to the United States. They didn\u2019t have to have visas \u2014 I beg your pardon \u2014\nthey didn\u2019t have to have affidavits from relatives. Many of them didn\u2019t have relatives\nwho wanted to go to the States. This also was important. It meant that people were given\na choice to an extent and how often had these people been given a choice after the war?\nThey came out of the camps or if they were Polish Jews who had fled into Russia and\nworked in the mines, and had gone back to the Poland, what choices had they had? It\nmight interest you, by the way, to know that among the people we took care of, the first\ncomplete Jewish families I found after the war were the Polish Jews who had fled to\nRussia when the Germans marched in. And, although they\u2019d suffered tremendous\nhardship, we had husbands and wives and children together. It was very interesting to see\nthis. As I said, they had \u2014 many of them had suffered. They\u2019d worked in the mines, and\nwhen do Jews work in mines, after all? They were tradesmen or employees, but they did\nsurvive as families.",
        "Q: Was this a source of resentment with the Jews who had come out of-?",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t \u2014 people weren\u2019t even aware. People were concerned for themselves. You\nhave to try and imagine what it was like to be in Germany after the war when either you\nwere a survivor of a camp \u2014 and there weren\u2019t too many remember \u2014 you were somebody\nwho had been encouraged to leave Poland, firstly because the Poles were still anti-\nSemitic. There had been pogroms in 1946 in Kielce, when Jews were killed again. You\nwere encouraged to leave because you hoped for a better life somewhere else. You didn\u2019t\nwant to be among the people you had been with, and everybody in a sense was concerned\nfor himself or herself. And you have to imagine also in these camps there was a total lack\nof privacy for people. They were sleeping in nissen (ph) huts. There was curtain in\nbetween families to give them some sort of privacy, but very little because it didn\u2019t stop\nvoices carrying. It was a very difficult time for these people, and our feeling generally\nwas the sooner we got them out of these \u2014 these people out of these conditions, the better.\nIt was a very, very tough time for these people. And although visitors who came to\nGermany \u2014 and there were many \u2014 and saw these people and they would talk very\nbravely, they didn\u2019t see how these people were living, what kind of latrine facilities there\nwere, what kind of washing facilities there were. There were no, obviously, there were no\nwashing machines, but what kind of laundry facilities there were, what kind of facilities\nthere were for the Orthodox Jews. It was an extraordinary difficult period, and these\npeople survived it. These are the people who were the survivors. They were amazing\npeople, and if there were occasionally arguments or quarrels, why not? I mean, this too\nwas normal.",
        "Q: So, people who visited did not see the conditions in terms of which people-",
        "A: Oh, yes, they saw the conditions. I\u2019m thinking of people who visited who were interested,\nlet\u2019s say, in raising money in the United States, and they came through and they saw the\ncamp. They may have even spent as much as a half a day, but you can\u2019t get a feel of a\nplace from that kind of experience.",
        "Q: Do you remember Harrison coming through to write the report for Truman about the\nconditions in the DP camp? Were you in that?",
        "A: No, he came through, I think, before I came into Germany. I\u2019m trying to think of which\nyear it was. Was it \u201949 that he came through?",
        "Q: I\u2019m trying to remember, but I can\u2019t.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t meet him.",
        "Q: There\u2019s one person who came to get a visa named Oscar Schindler, can you describe the\ncircumstances in terms of which he came to you, who came with him, how many times\nyou met him, what you did for him, and what you thought of him?",
        "A: He was an interesting character. Again, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, who was the European\nDirector of the JDC, came to me and told me really a fantastic story of a man whom a\nwhole group of survivors in Paris had just given a banquet. Who was this man? His name\nwas Oscar Schindler, and I really knew nothing about him at that time. And Dr. Schwartz\ntold me that Oscar Schindler had saved the lives of at least 1,200 Jews by having them\nwork in his factory in Poland, and Oscar Schindler had come back to Germany, had gone\nto Frankfurt. I think he had tried to set up a concrete factory, and was not successful. It\u2019s\ninteresting, this fantastic character didn\u2019t do very well. The Joint was helping to support\nhim at this time because they were so astounded by his efforts to save people who\nessentially were not of his own kind. They were Jews; he was a Catholic. He was a\nmember of the Nazi party, as most Germans were. And the fact that he had helped these\npeople, they were ready to do anything they could to help him. So, Dr. Schwartz said to\nme, \u201cAmy, you know the ropes. He will come to you. Perhaps he won\u2019t even come alone.\nHe may come with other people. I want you to try and send him wherever he wants to\ngo.\u201d Well, Oscar Schindler appeared in my office one day with his wife and two young\nJewish couples, and I sort of couldn\u2019t get the hang of what the relationship was, and they\nexplained to me in Yiddish that they always protected him because he looked like any\nother German Nazi. He had blue eyes and blonde hair, and was very fair, obviously, and\nthey were afraid if he came to my office, which was in the Jewish quarter of Munich, he\nmight be set upon. There were a lot of belligerent Jews at that time. Oscar, as I said,\ncame, and explained to me that what he really wanted to do was to set up a mink farm.\nNow, what he knew about mink farming, I had no idea, but 1t wasn\u2019t mine to question.\nAnd the place he wanted to do it was in the Argentine. The Argentine, I knew the\nArgentine consuls. I could get a visa for Oscar and his wife, no problem. They were\nCatholics. But, he said also, he would not go unless the two couples with him also got\nvisas because they were like family to him, and they felt he was family to them. He\u2019d\nsaved their lives, and they were never going to forget this. Well, I set about trying to get\nthe visas. As I say, it was not too difficult for Oscar and his wife. How to get visas for the\ntwo couples with him \u2014 on the application form for a Argentine visa, they asked religion.\nThey did on many applications at that time, asked the religion of the applicant, but it\ndidn\u2019t say explain anything. It didn\u2019t say, for example, if somebody was Orthodox, were\nthey Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Jewish Orthodox, \u201cA ha!\u201d I thought. I put\nOrthodox, and it was no problem. I got the visas, and eventually they went to the States.\nI\u2019m sorry, they went to the Argentine, but they were lovely people, all of them. Oscar was\nvery soft voiced, very pleasant. Who could imagine that this man \u2014 he was diminutive, he\nwasn\u2019t very tall \u2014 had the courage to do the kinds of things he did? I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve\nseen the film \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u2019, but a lot of that \u2014 the story in that film \u2014 is true. He was\nan extraordinary man to deal with, and in retrospect, quite a privilege to have met him. It\nwas interesting that we were so busy trying to help people that it never occurred to me\nthat here was somebody who was very, very special.",
        "Q: Did you talk with his wife, as well?",
        "A: Yes, she didn\u2019t do much talking, but she also was very nice. She\u2019s still alive, you know,\nliving in the Argentine. She was very pleasant, too.",
        "Q: Did he \u2014 did you talk to him at all about what he had done during the war, or not?",
        "A: No, you didn\u2019t talk to people. I think, firstly, he might have been embarrassed, but that\nisn\u2019t why he came to see me. Firstly, it would not have occurred to me, except to tell him\nwhat a wonderful human being he was, but you know, we really had no concept at that\ntime \u2014 this is 1949 \u2014 of the kinds of things that he had done to save so many people. I\nmean, he got people out of Auschwitz. Who ever got anybody out of Auschwitz? He was\nquite an extraordinary man.",
        "Q: Could you put together the man who was portrayed in the film and the man that you met\nin your office?",
        "A: Yes, to an extent. I think there\u2019s one part of the film where he goes into the basement to\nget wine, I think, it is Gert\u2019s basement and the young lady who works for him, a Jewish\nprisoner, who Gert is very nasty to, is down there and Oscar, if you remember the film,\nleans towards her and she thinks he\u2019s going to kiss her. And he pats her on the shoulder.\nHe said, \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t going to kiss you. I was going to kiss you actually only on the\nforehead, but to tell you you will be all right. I will take care of you.\u201d Now, when you\nthink of this man, he could\u2019ve abused this girl. He could\u2019ve abused any of the Jewish\nwomen in his care. He could\u2019ve raped them if he had to. He could\u2019ve done anything with\nthem because they owed their lives to him. He didn\u2019t touch one of them. Although in the\nfilm, he is shown as being a womanizer, it helps to sell a film. Let\u2019s face it, and he may\nhave been a womanizer, but the important thing about Oscar Schindler is he didn\u2019t touch\none of the prisoners. I think this tells you essentially the character of this man.",
        "Q: So, how long did it take you to get him the visa? (One second, please.) [Microphone\nadjusted.] How long did take you to get him out of Argentina? Or get him into Argentina,\nI\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: I think it took me about five or six weeks. There are all kinds of documents you have to\nfill in. You have to get passports. I had to get passports, take those passports for the\npeople who were going with him. They were Polish Jews, and they weren\u2019t going as\nPolish citizens. It was all rather complicated, and yet in a sense it was very normal for us\nto be doing the kind of thing we were doing. So, he came to the office on several\noccasions, and was always very pleasant, an extraordinary man.",
        "Q: Could we stop the film for just one second? [Tape break.] (Okay, we\u2019re rolling.) Are\nthere any other people whose stories you\u2019d like to tell us that you helped? That you\nhaven\u2019t told us about?",
        "A: There were some very wonderful survivors, but each story is a different story. The fact\nthat they were survivors, and remained decent human beings and people with a sense of\nhumor, and people with kindness, there are many stories of many kind people, and there\nwere people who survived who weren\u2019t kind people. I think people went into the camps \u2014\nrather, people who went into the camps as kind, decent human beings came out as such,\nand those who were gas/lonim, gangsters, when they went in, were gangsters when they\ncame out. People don\u2019t change. Their behavior changes, I think. There was some very\nwonderful people who survived, and very wonderful people, unfortunately, who didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: So, how \u2014 you were in Germany doing this job until 1952.",
        "A: I stayed in Germany until the Displaced Persons Act came to an end, and then I felt it was\ntime for me to go on. The American Joint wanted me to go down to Morocco where they\nhad a program, but I thought it was about time I started to sample normal life. You have\nto remember that, since I was a teenager, I\u2019d been working with displaced persons living\nan expatriate life, an exotic life in a way, but I felt that my biggest job had been done. I\u2019d\nhelped as many people as I could to immigrate to countries outside of Israel. We didn\u2019t\nhandle Israel. And it was about time I set myself up. And, so, I waited until the Act came\nto an end in May of \u201945, and then decided I would go to the United States and see where\nsome of these Americans with whom I\u2019d work came from.",
        "Q: So, from 1944, February, until 1952, May, you hadn\u2019t been back to England but once?",
        "A: Oh, no, no.",
        "Q: Had you been back more?",
        "A: Oh, I had been back. If I got a weekend, while my mother was alive, I would pop over to\nsee her as often as I could, which was perhaps every four months, six months. I\u2019d take a\nlong week. You know, it was a train overnight there, and spend a day with her, and come\nback. Maybe it was longer periods in between, but I did go and see her. My mother died\nin 1952, and I had been in London about three months before, and we had gone to the\nballet, and had a lovely evening, and that was my last memory of her.",
        "Q: You were very close to your mother.",
        "A: Yes, I liked her tremendously. She was a very kind woman, a very kind woman.",
        "Q: Was she both proud of your work and yet missing you a great deal, wishing that you were\nin London with her?",
        "A: Oh, I think she would have loved to have had me in London, but she was very proud of\nthe fact that, 1n a sense, I was giving service, 1s the way that she would put it, that I was\nhelping other people. I think if she had been younger, she might have done it herself.",
        "Q: What age did she die?",
        "A: She was in her late 60s.",
        "Q: So, she was not such an old woman?",
        "A: No, no. She\u2019d been sick.",
        "Q: And your decision to go to the United States rather than England.",
        "A: Well, I couldn\u2019t see myself in England having worked with the Americans for so long. I\nneeded a break, I felt. I had no home in England, anyway, and I thought I would come to\nthe States. I had friends in the States, Gladys Roth, with whom I had worked invited me\nalso to come and stay with her while she was on leave, and so I thought that was a good\nidea. And, when I came to the States I was invited by William Rosenwald, the son of\nJulius \u2014 was it Julius Rosenwald. Or was that his brother who started Sears Roebuck? \u2014\nwho had met me in Germany, asked me if I\u2019d come and run his philanthropies for him,\nand I thought I would try that. And I was working for him for about a year when the\nAmerican Joint again approached me and said they had a problem down in Brazil where\nthe last people who had been displaced persons camps, a lot of whom had been sent down\nthere and they were having a problem. Would I go down to Brazil and sort the situation\nout? Foolishly, I said yes. The Brazilian community that I dealt with, largely was the\nrefugee community. There were about 20,000 former refugees living in San Paulo, most\nof them very, very fine people. The people who had been sent in when the displaced\npersons camps were closing were difficult people, let me put it that way. Some of them\nwere mentally ill. Some of them should never have been sent. Some of them had no\ndesire to be there. It was a very, very difficult situation. I was physically attacked down\nthere for a change. I hadn\u2019t been physically attacked since I\u2019d been 1n Greece, and it was\nbroadcast, by the way, over the radio and some friends, including Norman Bentwich,\nProfessor Bentwich, heard in London, called my aunt, and I got frantic phone calls from\nLondon. I got another dislocation from that.",
        "Q: How did they attack you?",
        "A: Physically.",
        "Q: They just started beating you up?",
        "A: Well, they tried, yes, and you know, I\u2019m rather small. I\u2019m only five foot four, and these\nguys were big guys, and I\u2019m not a fighter, physically or mentally, I think, but after that I\nworked under police protection. And I used to come back to the hotel in which I lived\nunder police protection, and one of the very nice Swedish boys at the desk asked me,\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Because apparently the only other women who came back to the hotel under\npolice protection where the prostitutes.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. No, I had to explain to him that I\u2019d been attacked, you know. But, the community\nthat was established there, there was a Dr. Lorch, L-o-r-c-h, from Germany, his wife\nwho\u2019s actually Brazilian Jewish \u2014 she was a Klabin, of the Klabin family. The parents\nhad come to Brazil at the turn of the century from Lithuania, and they were a very, very\nwealthy family, and very concerned for refugees. They had worked on the refugees\ncommittee before the war, and they helped after the war. They were very kind to me, and\nthere were several other families who did a beautiful job down there, but these people\nwere people they hadn\u2019t met before. I hadn\u2019t met this kind before, actually. I set up a\nsmall loans committee to try and help them. Their visas weren\u2019t regular visas, you know,\nit\u2019s coming back to the old story, and I had to legalize them, and the Brazilian\ngovernment really didn\u2019t want to legalize them except for Jeiko (ph). Yes, and it was\nvery difficult. Eventually, the government settled. I must say, and I'll confess now that\none or two who were Germans who didn\u2019t know what they were letting themselves in for\nI sent back to Germany. One or two of them, I managed to get into Canada. And we set\nup a small loans committee so that a lot of these men could become hawkers. They\nbought goods on credit, and went to outlying villages just as the original Strausses did in\nthe United States. Some of them became very wealthy, and they calmed down. Some of\nthem were pretty awful people, and as with all groups, there was lovely people among\nthem. It was a very tough job. I stayed in Brazil for nine months. It was a tough\nassignment, a very tough assignment. When I came back to New York, and the British\nasked me \u2014 called me and said would I come to England? Because the British\ngovernment was now allowing what they called hardcore cases to come into England.\nHardcore cases for the British were families where the head of the family could not\nmaintain his family either because of physical illness or even that they might be mentally\ndisturbed, and so I went to England, and went into Austria, Germany, and Italy again to\nchoose hardcore cases to come to England. They were interesting, some of these people. I\nhad one young man who had been shot through the shoulder and had no profession. We\nbrought him to England. He was supposed to have had TB and be cured, but when we\ngot him to England, we discovered he still had TB, and the British were not really taking\nin TB cases. They had enough illnesses of their own, and so eventually, I took this man\nwho behaved as though he were mentally ill while he was England, eventually I took him\nback to Germany. We flew, and it was quite surprising. As we got off the plane, you\nnever would have known that he had behavior other than normal behavior. When they x-\nrayed him, he showed no signs of TB. I\u2019m sure they thought the British were trying to get\nrid of him. He was quite an extraordinary case. I think he couldn\u2019t face being outside the\nterritory in which he was captured. He was one of the strange cases. Others were families\nwith several sons and daughters. Some of them Orthodox Jews who made a very good\nadjustment to living in England. We moved them into areas where there were Orthodox\nJews. The Jewish Refugees Committee did a very good job on those people, and I\nremember another young \u2014 not a young couple, but a young man with older parents who\nthe British brought in, and had him trained as a surveyor. He had no college education,\nbut like many people in England, you could go into a profession and train on the job, and\nhe did very well and his parents adjusted very well. Those families on the whole, except\nfor this young man, who was very sad, were a success. And then, of course, I came back\nto the States. I became, I suppose, a cosmopolitan in a way in that I felt at home nowhere.\nI\u2019d worked for so long with displaced persons, in a sense, it was the only thing I knew.\nBut after coming to the States, one of my friends convinced me I ought to work with the\nNational Council of Jewish Women, their headquarters in New York. And I went to see\nthem, and I must say they were very anxious to get me. I don\u2019t know why, perhaps my\nexperience meant something to them. And I did work for them for \u2014 I\u2019m trying to think\nhow long \u2014 several years, until the wanderlust got me again, and I decided together with a\nfriend who was a published author that we\u2019d go off to China and see what the role of\nwomen was in the new China. I didn\u2019t realize we wouldn\u2019t get visas, but I gave up my\njob. My friend got an advance on a book about China. She was already, as I say, a\npublished author, and we landed in Tokyo \u2014 or rather, I landed in Tokyo. She was coming\nlater by ship. I flew in. And the first night that I was in the Frank Lloyd Wright Imperial\nHotel, it was a very interesting building. Everything was much too big for me. Everything\nwas high, and the first night I was there, I met charming gentleman in the smorgasbord\nrestaurant who eventually became my husband. We got married in London because my\nfamily couldn\u2019t think that somebody hat at last got me to say yes, and I ended up on the\nprairie in Illinois, on the flat, flat prairie, which I found devastating, absolutely\ndevastating. Nobody knew me. Nobody knew of the work that I had done. Nobody was\ninterested, and I decided, \u201cWell, if I\u2019m going to be stuck here\u201d because David was a\nlovely, lovely man, \u201cI\u2019m going to do something. I\u2019Il go back to school,\u201d which I had tried\nto do before I left England. I had gone to university in the evening, but of course couldn\u2019t\ncontinue because of the Blitz and things like that, and then I went overseas. I said to\nmyself, \u201cPll get my degree here.\u201d And in the time it normally takes a student not having\nbeen in school for a thousand years, I maintain a straight average \u2014 a straight-A average \u2014\ngot my undergraduate degree, got a Master\u2019s degree, and then decided I would do what I\nalways want to do and that was to get a PhD at the London School of Economics, and\nDavid thought that was a splendid idea. He was very kind, and I came to London again.\nThe semester was ten weeks. We had three semesters a year, and I had to be there for two\nyears. I managed to skip one while we went on sabbatical to Australia, which is another\nstory, meeting people I\u2019d sent there as refugees, and came back to the States, finished my\ndissertation, and in 1975, received my PhD from the London School of Economics. And\nthen I decided what one really had to do was to tell this story of what happened during\nand after the war because, as I say, nobody ever asked. Nobody seemed to be interested.\nThere was one professor at University of Illinois. His name was Winton Solberg. He was\nan intellectual history, and he asked me to write a course on the Holocaust. I thought this\nwas going to be a great opportunity. I wrote the course, but I was a woman, and the\nhistory department wasn\u2019t about to make funding available for me to teach the course.\nBut, women\u2019s movement was beginning to get going, and Joan Huber, who was head of\nthe department of sociology, said to me, \u201cAmy, you can teach that course in our\ndepartment.\u201d I have to go back and bit and tell you that I had competed for a job as an\nassistant to the vice president for academic affairs for the university, and there were two\npositions going. There were 77 applicants, and Edith Terwilliger and I got those\npositions. The former Vice President, P.T. Yankwich, now lives in Washington, as a\nmatter of fact. So, it was very interesting working for this man. He was very bright. He\nwas an intellectual, and he gave me time off to teach the course, and since I got paid for\nteaching the course, it meant I could employ a graduate assistant and pay her that money,\nso she had money during the semester. I gave the course over three or four semesters. It\nwas fascinating because the room which I was assigned filled very quickly, and the\ncomputer cut us off, and I found that the students taking the course were children from all\nends, or both ends, of the Jewish spectrum. They were children of strictly Orthodox\nparents, and children of non-Orthodox parents. They were children of survivors. They\nwere children of Polish immigrants who\u2019d come after the war, and one didn\u2019t know what\ntheir parents had done during the war, and all of them were interesting because, if I told\nthem, for example, the story of a pastor who had saved some Jews, they wanted proof,\nand my xeroxing bill was tremendous. I always brought evidence of anything I told them\nthat was positive about non-Jews who\u2019d helped Jews, and I used to say, \u201cThere were\ngood Germans. There were good Poles. There just weren\u2019t enough of them.\u201d They were\ninteresting groups of students because, as I discovered, those whose parents were\nsurvivors, they told me their parents told them nothing. And I would tell them, \u201cPerhaps\nyou can tell them something of what you\u2019ve learned in the class and see what their\nreaction is. Don\u2019t push them, but gently try to get their stories from them because it 1s\nstill so painful for them \u2014 for them to tell you these stories.\u201d They were very interesting\nstudents, and I kept in touch with them for a long time.",
        "Q: Did they ask you \u2014 did you tell them about what you had done after the war or did you\nnot tell them anything?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t tell them essentially, but I would \u2014 I think my classes were interesting because I\nwould tell them incidents of my experience. I didn\u2019t tell them in the sense that I\u2019ve told\nyou, but I would tell them of incidents and that I knew of these incidents because of this\nexperience. I think they believed me because they felt that I was talking from experience,\nso they enjoyed taking my course. I made it a difficult course. When I say I made it a\ndifficult course, I didn\u2019t make it easy because of my experience. They had to pass the\ngrade, too, but no, I didn\u2019t tell them because I \u2014 just like with Oscar Schindler, I didn\u2019t\nthink people were interested, and also, I find it very hard to talk about myself. I might tell\nyou this is the first time I\u2019ve ever done it. Nobody has ever asked me before.",
        "Q: Well, I\u2019m really grateful, and so is everybody else who is hearing this.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: Amy, you were asked to go back to England to create an archive. Can you talk about that,\nand talk about one of the pieces of information that you had found that really had been\nlost about the St. Louis?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Can you do that?",
        "A: My pleasure. After my husband died, the head of the World Jewish Fund for Jewish\nRelief, no sorry, got the name wrong, haven\u2019t I?",
        "Q: British Fund-",
        "A: Central British Fund for World Jewish Relief called me one day because she knew of my\nrelationship to the organization. She said they had found a tremendous stack of files in\none of the garages at one of the nursing homes, rather, one of the homes for the aged for\nformer refugees. Would I come and look at it? She knew that I came into England fairly\noften because I did have brothers and sisters there. And so I came and looked at the stack\nand was amazed. There were a tremendous number of case histories on individuals. They\nwere files on children who\u2019d been brought out from Austria and Germany on kinder\ntransports. There were minutes of meetings. And I said to this woman, Ava Mitchell,\n\u201cYou have a treasure trove here. You\u2019ve got the archives of your agency. Nobody knows\ntheir story.\u201d And she originally had been a refugee, by the way. She said, \u201c\u201cWould you put\nit together for us?\u201d Well, I wasn\u2019t an archivist, and I knew that the agency would never\nhave the money to employ an archivist. We have to remember that after the war, Britain\nwas still very poor. I said I thought I\u2019d like to do this. So, I packed my bags and came to\nLondon. They gave me a staff. Somebody had given them some money so that we can\nwork on this archive, and Bill & Howe (ph) did our microfilming for us. They were very\nhelpful, and they asked me to do a booklet on the archive, which I did which was\npublished which was rather nice. It took us about 18 months to put this stuff together, but\nit has proved invaluable. For example, one of the items we found were all the records of\npeople who had ever registered with the Jewish Refugees Committee from 1933 on, and\nthat would be from May the 18\", 1933, when the organization was started. It would have\nrecords of people who\u2019d been inquired about and you would find a card which would say,\n\u2018Helen Comb \u2014 deported through Tiresenstadt (ph) And it would give the date because\nsomebody had come in and given this information. And, even to this day, those cards are\nuseful. For example, if you want to prove that you came to England as a refugee, and\nclaim your pension or money from Germany or Austria or some funding which was due\nto you, we could look up your archive and see if your name was there, and it would give\nthe date that you arrived in England. Now, what happened ultimately, as we were\nworking through this archive, I began to see names which said \u201cSt. Louis\u2019, and that\nstruck me because I knew of the story of the St. Louis, this ghastly story of these people\nwho in high hopes went in party fashion, practically, to Cuba, not knowing that they were\ngoing to be refused entry, not knowing that all but about 22 would be refused entry\nbecause the 22 had paid the extra money that was required to get a permanent visa. And I\nstart to make cards on them, and I found about 110 of the people who came into England\nwhere it was marked St. Louis passengers, and I kept these cards. And then one day I\nheard from the museum, your museum, that you were going to do an exhibition on the\npeople who sailed on the St. Louis and the face of those who landed up in Europe, but\nyou really didn\u2019t have full records of those who landed in Britain, although you had\nnames. And I said, \u201cIf you give me all the names, I will be able to trace all of them. And I\nmust say it took me quite a while, I won\u2019t tell you how many weeks, to go through these\n\u2014 the microfilm, find these people, and take a picture of these people, and I found all 187\nof the people who landed in Britain, and I felt very pleased because it will help complete\nyour archive, and it shows the value of doing what we did and the money we spent on\nputting that archive together. Archives are terribly, terribly important, and I only hope\nthat people who may look at this film will realize if they have letters from people during\nthe war, before the war, after the war, which might be useful, to find out from an archivist\nwhere they might be useful. The family might not be interested, but an archive will be\nable to put history together, and without our history we have no future.",
        "Q: Well, Amy Gottlieb, it\u2019s been a real pleasure talking to you. Your book, \u201cMen of Vision\u201d\nis something people should read if they want to know about what Britain did, and the\nstories that you tell 1s particularly poignant now when we have 50-80 million refugees in\nthe world, and how difficult it 1s, and how much care it takes. And the care that you\u2019ve\ngiven these people, I\u2019m sure they all thank you, and we thank you for being here.",
        "A: Thank you. And I must say that there are volunteers today from many countries of the\nworld helping refugees overseas. I only hope they get the kind of the care that the British\ngave to the refugees from Germany and Austria before the war and during the war, and\nafter the war.",
        "Q: Yes, this history must be a repetition for you over and over again.",
        "A: Yes, you see the same kind of things happening that happened before. If I were younger,\nI would go out and help.",

        "Q: Thank you.",
        "A: [Badge shown.] The badge that you see was given to all members of Jewish Relief Units\nwho volunteered to go overseas during and after the war. For example, when Bergen-\nBelsen was liberated, more than a 100 people from England \u2014 doctors, nurses, lawyers,\nsocial workers, teachers, went into Bergen-Belsen to help those people who had survived\nthere. This was the badge that the Central British Fund had set up for us so that we would\nbe recognized as a Jewish team, so that survivors who saw the Shield of David would\nrealize that we were Jews who had come to help them, and perhaps ease their burden\nsomewhat.",
        "Q: And where did you wear this?",
        "A: We wore this badge on the beret that we had. We also wore a Shield of David in blue and\nwhite on our sleeves as our insignia. And we wore a British Army uniform at the time,\nBritish army officer\u2019s uniform, actually.",

        "Q: Fine.",

        "Q: Were most of the people who came back from the concentration camps from Auschwitz,\nor from labor camps that they had been sent to on death marches?",

        "Q: No, I mean of the survivors who were coming back?",
        "Q: You know, I think it\u2019s interesting, people don\u2019t necessarily think about how difficult it is\nafter a war, what it means to clean up and repair and at the same time take care of\nindividuals, so the picture is very graphic when you describe it this way, and you describe\npeople sleeping in the streets because there were not enough beds.",
        "Q: Why did that happen?",
        "Q: It was a loaded gun?",
        "Q: Did you get scared afterwards?",

        "Q: How did the non-Jewish Greek population feel when these folks came back? I mean, they\nalso had suffered during the war. So, I don\u2019t know, were they able to help? Did they want\nto help? Or were they simply trying to get through it themselves?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: Now, even though people came back and there were no families, was there property, like\nhouses or apartments that they tried to take over?",

        "Q: In Eastern Europe, the Joint Distribution Committee often went around to the families\nwho were taken care of Jewish children, non-Jewish families, and sometimes kidnapped\nthem away. Was anything like that happening in Italy or in Greece? Had there been\nchildren in hiding who people wanted to keep?",

        "Q: How does one fight a general devaluation of currency?",
        "Q: Was there a lot of black market in these places where you were, that you remember\u2019?",
        "Q: You seem to be describing barter, which I think may be somewhat different than black\nmarket, where people do make money, and-",
        "Q: Now, when you gave people money, or checks so they could have some money, was this\nsufficient so they could rent an apartment, perhaps, or was this really to enable them to\nget food and sustain themselves.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to go back to something because I\u2019m going to forget it if I don\u2019t remind you\nand me. You said you met Golda Meir on a trip from Italy to Palestine. What was she\ndoing and what were you meeting about?",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t?",
        "Q: I was asking you about what the meeting was about with Golda Meir.",
        "Q: Did you learn to speak Greek since you were there for so long, or at least, over a year?",
        "Q: Did you interview some of these survivors that had come back? Did you sit down and\ntalk with them or was work so overwhelming that that was not part of what you were\ndoing?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you ever notice that the spoke with each other?",
        "Q: As you heard some of this from people, I mean, since some people did speak with you,\ndid you \u2014 you seem to have an extremely positive outlook on life. I mean, it just shows in\nyou. Did this depress you and make you wonder about the capacity of human beings to\ncommit horrific acts like this that you had never thought of before? Did you think this\nwas just aberrant?",
        "Q: So, did you sometimes cry alone?",
        "Q: I can see you\u2019re seeing somebody in your head. Yes?",
        "Q: Did a number of people get sent home because they were not right for this kind of work?\nOr did people generally just go home on their own?",

        "Q: Two of you?",
        "Q: You were in Greece from April \u201945 to August \u201946, yes? So, in the beginning, it must have\nbeen much tougher, because the war is just over, or not quite over.",
        "Q: In June, right.",
        "Q: You can see people being shot?",
        "Q: What was it like a year later? Were there sort of incremental changes, like every three\nmonths you could see a real difference?",
        "Q: How was it that you came to go to Austria?",
        "Q: Can you explain what a job and housing assurance is?",

        "Q: And may not have finished school...",
        "Q: Was this and added burden for women then, unless they got married and were part of a\nfamily?",

        "Q: So, how long did you work in Austria?",
        "Q: That\u2019s a long period. Could you describe, I mean, you were doing these visas, were you\ngoing around and explaining to people how they could get visas?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t want you to get to Germany so fast.",
        "Q: I want to talk about Austria a little bit. What was it like to \u2014 did you lecture? I mean, did\nyou get into a hall and lecture to a group of DPs to say this is what you-",
        "Q: I was asking whether you would get in front of a large group of DPs and lecture to them?",
        "Q: Amy, in \u201946, there are still people in DP camps who were not technically survivors, who\nhad left the country because of the war and they were accumulated in DP camps. Did you\nhave criteria for who you would give visas to?",
        "Q: And would you appeal for them?",
        "Q: And what do you think the INS was doing? Were they being genuine? Were they simply\nnot wanting these folks to come in because they-?",
        "Q: Did you sometimes take the information? Or were you sort of the administrative head of\nyour staff?",
        "Q: Well, did you see with clients?",
        "Q: Can you give me a sense of what it would mean to have a false paper? What is that kind\nof documentation people had to have?",
        "Q: You must have gotten angry at times, no?",
        "Q: Let\u2019s take a break.",
        "Q: Amy, give me some idea. You were in Austria for a rather long time, close to two years.",
        "Q: More than two years. What was it like to be in Austria during that time? Did you meet\nwith Austrians as well as the refugees and the survivors that you were helping?",
        "Q: And were these older Austrians?",
        "Q: Is that your main association with Austrian citizens?",
        "Q: Is that your main association with Austrian citizens?",

        "Q: How did the husband and the daughter get to Palestine? Do you know?",
        "Q: Did you ever have a circumstance where the story was really not true and you had to say\nno to somebody?",
        "Q: Are there any other situations in Austria you would like to tell us about before we move\nto your next?",
        "Q: No, tell us.",
        "Q: How do you think you picked this up? Knowing how to arrange things, because you\u2019re\nright, people say, \u201cI don\u2019t pay for things. I don\u2019t barter for things. I simply do-\u201d",
        "Q: So, but there is a difference because you said a number of times that you didn\u2019t want to\ndo anything that was illegal.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: How did you distinguish between what was illegal and what was just sort of pushing the\nenvelope?",
        "Q: Amy, when you took this job \u2014 actually, did you start to get paid at any point?",
        "Q: So, does that mean, was it \u201946 or \u201947?",
        "Q: That was nice.",
        "Q: But let me ask you something. You were in 1945, 26?",

        "Q: Helping people to get-",
        "Q: Did you think about yourself at this very young person doing this wonderful-?",

        "Q: Were there other people \u2014 were most of the people working for you your age? Were they\nmuch older? Were they younger?",
        "Q: So, it was mixed?",
        "Q: You do, but you won\u2019t tell right? So, what happened in 1948? You then got -",
        "Q: Was this a much bigger operation that you had in Austria?",
        "Q: So, who would do this training? Did you say to the DP camp personnel, \u201cIn order to get\nthis people out, train them as such and such\u201d? How would that work?",
        "Q: So, how were these people chosen do you think? Do you have any idea?",

They were children of a first husband of my mother\u2019s.\nMy parents were originally from Lithuania, as was my mother\u2019s first husband. In fact, I\nstill possess her Ketuba from Lithuania, and her permit to travel in the pale (ph) of\nRussia, and she came as immigrant as many people did at the time of the turn of the\ncentury when everybody seemed to be leaving for the United States, and she was one of\nthose immigrants that got stuck in Britain. As you probably know, almost all of them \u2014\nparticularly the Jews \u2014 intended to come to America where the streets were supposed to\nbe lined with gold, but my mother got left behind, and eventually met my father who\nmarried her, and I grew up in this large family as the youngest child, and it was rather\nnice.",

        "A: Well, they weren\u2019t children to me. They were all adults. I was a child growing up in a\nfamily of adults, and since ostensibly I was a weak child, I was always being sent away to\nrecuperate. So, I didn\u2019t grow up close to this family, close emotionally to this family. I\ndid to my eldest sister, who is really a half-sister, but I was very much, I think, a lone\nchild because everybody else was older than I.

He explained to me what was going on, but\nhe was not a religious man. The nice thing I remember about being Jewish, I suppose,\nwas the wonderful Friday evenings when we all gathered together, and on the holidays\nwhen friends would also come, and for the Passover when they would invite people who\ndidn\u2019t have family. My mother was a very generous, warm, and kind person, and she was\nalways inviting people into the house. She was very forward-looking, I think. I hope, that\nI have some of her characteristics.",
        "A: In the late \u201820s, I would say no. In England, we had, as you had, a tremendous\ndepression, economic depression. There was a lot of employment even \u2014 not even, but in\nmy family, too. I began to be aware that things were happening in Germany when I was\n14 or 15, a settlement house, of which I was member, began to have youngsters from\nGermany come to learn English, to help pass the time. They were builted (ph) locally,\nand I got to know some of them and felt awful that they had been sent to Britain, let\u2019s say\nin \u00b035-\u201936, without their parents \u2014 to a foreign country where most of them had no\nrelatives, and I felt very deeply about this. I think this is what affected me when\neventually the British asked for volunteers to go overseas. I felt 1t was important that I\nmust go.",
        "A: A settlement house \u2014 we had them also in the United States \u2014 A settlement house is a\ncommunity center run usually by a voluntary agency, where youngsters and older people\ncome. They have classes, educational classes, classes for mothers, in the old days, I\nsuppose, they had classes teaching people English. It\u2019s a real community center.",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t. They just \u2014 they didn\u2019t talk about it. One didn\u2019t ask. Firstly, being\nBritish, you\u2019re rather reticent, anyway, but one had a sense that these kids were alone,\nterribly alone. There was no family. There were no cousins. Occasionally, one would\nhave an aunt in the country, and that would be rather nice because she had family to\nrelate to, but in the 30s, many German parents \u2014 rather, not many, but a number of\nGerman parents who could afford it were sending their children to school in England\nbecause German law prohibited them from attending school. Very early on in, I think,\n1933, the first law came in which limited the number of Jewish children who could attend\nschool. And so, a number of them came to England to school, and they were taken in by\nfamilies. There was an organization called B\u2019nai B\u2019rith, which still exists, and they\nhelped a lot of these children, particularly the Orthodox Jewish children.",
        "A: Well, firstly the war came in \u201939. I remember we had the bombing in London, and 90\ndays of bombing constantly is not very pleasant.",
        "A: That was pretty awful. Very often, I would be scared and I\u2019d sit under a table, or I would\nlike people to think that I was brave and so I took tea to the shelters wearing my tin hat\nuntil I was going out one day with a young friend, and a piece of shrapnel went through\nhis tin hat, and he was no longer. It was frightening and yet, you didn\u2019t like to appear a\ncoward. We did things that we would never do. We went into the streets and put out\nincendiary bombs because, since the government, I suppose, wanted to know how many\nincendiaries had been dropped, they would pay us a half a crown which was about half a\ndollar in those days, to bring in the ends of incendiary bombs. So, we\u2019d go out and we\u2019d\npick these things up once the bomb had gone off. And, yet, we used to sit on the doorstep\noccasionally in an air raid, and say, \u201cWhat will we tell our children of the war?\u201d And, you\nknow, we were eating peanuts and we\u2019d say, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll tell them that we sat on the\ndoorstep eating peanuts.\u201d But, it was an interesting period because we never saw a fruit.\nIf anybody brought in an orange, if an American soldier gave somebody an orange or a\nbanana, we raffled it to the Red Cross. We didn\u2019t go hungry. We were never short of the\nmost awful bread you can ever imagine, and the American powdered egg, which we even\nthought made good cakes, you know, we had forgotten what a good cake tasted like. But,\nas I say, we were never hungry, and interestingly, we always knew we were going to win\nthe war. Don\u2019t ask me why, perhaps this was a moral booster, perhaps this was\nChurchill\u2019s speeches, but we never thought the Germans would overrun us. Of course, we\nalways suspected that we would be invaded, and this influenced, of course, the British\nattitude toward the refugees. We suspected everybody with a German accent of being a\nspy. It was a very difficult period for them, much more so than for us.",
        "A: Ninety days of bombing on London.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, but my mother was okay, you know, the heck with the house.",
        "A: I met recently a woman, she called me as a result of my book. She called me and she said,\n\u201cDo you remember, after the air raids when you\u2019d done all your rounds, you used to\ncome into our house and sleep on a bed or a mat or anywhere?\u201d No, I went to stay with\nfriends, and after the house was hit, we got my mother to leave London and go into the\ncountry. I wouldn\u2019t go. I felt safest in London, believe it or not. I couldn\u2019t bear the\nthought of being outside of London and seeing the bombs falling, because you could see\nthe fires.",
        "A: My mother was okay. We were all okay. It\u2019s very interesting. There was no counseling 1n\nthose days, and I sometimes wonder if we have too much counseling when a child goes\nthrough a small trauma, true, a trauma, but in the old days going through this bombing,\nnobody came and counseled us and very often we were helping to dig bodies out of the\nAnderson shelters and finding people who were wounded badly, but we carried on. You\nknow, this was life.",
        "A: I was \u2014 no, I was older in 1939, I was 18, and in 1940, I was 19, but we had no prior\nexperience of this. The most wonderful thing to happen to us was when Hitler invaded\nRussia because then the bombing began to let up. And it was extraordinary because we\nall felt so guilty that here the Russians were taking what we had been having, and in those\ndays, Russia was our friend. The Cold War that came later seemed so \u2014 so different, so\ndifficult a period when we think of, we knew what the Russians were going through, that\nmillions were being killed by the Germans, millions and millions of them. I don\u2019t think\npeople even today realize how many millions of people were killed during that war\noutside of concentration camps. I mean, we talk of six million Jews dying, and that\nnumber, you can\u2019t imagine what six million is, and it was dreadful. There isn\u2019t a Jewish\nfamily, I think, worldwide, which didn\u2019t lose a relative, but in Russia, about 25 million\npeople died.",
        "A: If we read The Press and The Times published a lot of material. We knew. I\u2019m not saying\nI was very well-versed in what was happening. I knew Jews were being killed. I knew\nthey were being put in concentration camps because sometimes a friend would have a\ncousin who was 15, who\u2019d been brought out whose head was shaven, and he\u2019d been\nincarcerated in a concentration camp. We knew that people were being killed. We knew\nthat the Nazis were very nasty people, but when the killing really started, when the Final\nSolution started in 1942, I don\u2019t think we, as individuals, I don\u2019t remember, but I don\u2019t\nthink I knew this. We didn\u2019t trust the Germans. We knew they\u2019d kill every Jew they\ncould get their fingers on. So, from that point of view, we knew we had to be very\ncareful. For example, if you would walk along the country lane in England, or even an\nordinary street, and ask somebody directions, they\u2019d never tell you in case you were a\nspy. The sign posts were taken down. So, unless you knew the area in which you were\nvisiting, there was nothing you could do. We were terribly afraid of being invaded.\nOstens- you know, not ostensibly, obviously because we were 21 miles from the French\ncoast, not very far, and not too far across the North Sea to get to England, and attempts\nwere made to bring spies in. So, it was a very difficult period because, if you met\nsomebody you didn\u2019t know, you didn\u2019t discuss anything that might in some way give\nthem information.",
        "A: I think before the Americans came, we thought we\u2019d win, but when the Americans came,\nHallelujah! Now, it was wonderful. It was wonderful because now we had an ally. Can\nyou imagine, in 1940, we were alone, totally alone, and many of us were making plans to\ntry to escape somewhere because we knew that, as Jews, we, too, would be taken by the\nGermans. But when the Americans, with the vast machinery for production, came into the\nwar, somehow we really knew we might win.",
        "A: Oh, yes \u2014 made plans, not really. Where could we go to? But, we dreamed of going up\nmaybe to Sweden, finding our way up there, but what would do with our parents? We\u2019re\na group of kids talking. You don\u2019t leave parents behind. But we thought we might find\nroots. We daydreamed. We daydreamed, but we really knew that if the Germans came to\nEngland, our lot was sealed. It was quite frightening.",
        "A: Yes, I was taking a course in social administration, and when I finished that course, I\nwent up to Birmingham during the course, actually to work at a settlement house in\nBirmingham, and then I went up to one in Nottingham where conditions were very\ndifferent from London. And it was there that I heard that the British government, being\nthe British government that it is, 1t always works closely with voluntary agencies, was\nasking for volunteers who would go overseas to any country to which they were sent with\nno prejudice, to help to save survivors both Jews and non-Jews, and I thought that was a\nmarvelous idea, but I was terrified of getting on a ship because ships could be sunk. You\nknow, we were losing so many ships during that war, but many people older than I were\nvolunteering, and, what the heck? I must say, at that time I talked to my mother because I\nwas her baby, and I told her what was happening and that it would be wonderful if we\nwould find Jews who survived because even in the \u201930s, as young as I was, I had some\ndaydream that I could go to Germany and rescue Jews. At least help them to get their\njewelry out so they could have some money when they came to England. My mother\nsaid, \u201cThey would never let you out.\u201d Or, \u201cThey\u2019d never let you in. You\u2019re Jewish.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cBut, Mother, they would never know.\u201d Of course, nobody would take me at age 16,\nbut when this call came, I did volunteer. There were some people I respected who had\nvolunteered, and the nice thing was I was chosen to go originally to Casablanca with a\nman called Friedman I think his name was. He was from Manchester. An American went\nas well. We were going to take care of Jews in a camp, but the French at that time were\nhaving trouble in Lebanon, so I learned, and so the British wouldn\u2019t allow any women\nout of the country. So, Morris Friedman went for Britain, and I waited for the next unit.\nHe went alone, and the next unit \u2014 each unit was ten persons. The first British-Jewish unit\nwas seven Jews and three Quakers, and there were units of the Red Cross, of the St.\nJohn\u2019s Ambulance Brigade, and all of the voluntary agencies that you know so well\ntoday. I think hundreds of people volunteered, and when I say volunteered, by the way,\nwe volunteered to go without salary, just to go wherever the government sent us to help\nsurvivors. And I knew we were going somewhere where it was warm because we were\nissued with a summer kit. I couldn\u2019t tell my mother where I was going. My father, by the\nway, died when I was 14. So, I\u2014 my father wasn\u2019t there to tell. But I knew we must be\ngoing somewhere where it was warm, but where? You know, one had no idea, and I must\nsay, I lied to my mother. I said I was going to a camp in Scotland for about a month, and\nwhen we came out of the camp, I would call her. And, of course, on February the 19\",\n1944, we got aboard a ship and sailed, and about a month later in convoy, landed in\nEgypt in Port Said.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Not all of us. The two of age groups met individually, and we had training camps at one\nof the Rothschild estates. I was a cook in one of them. So, the people would not only eat\ndecently, but be able to attend the various sessions. There was some very good people\nwho came and talked about what we might find, but who would know what we would\nfind? Nobody had any experience. What happened in these training sessions is that we\ngot to know each other, and we were all as different as chalk from cheese. Many of us\ndidn\u2019t know each other, and it was a way of getting to know each other, getting to know\nthe people who were doing the training. We were absolutely green when we arrived in\nEgypt, and as we took the train from Port Said down to Cairo, there were men on\nhorseback along the train shooting at us, just for fun. And, we were under the seats. You\nknow, and when I think of it, I don\u2019t think we were really scared. Who expected to be\nshot at? You know, you\u2019re coming to do relief work. We were in a camp in Maadi, M-a-\na-d-1, in Cairo for a while. We were allowed to read army records of what was happening,\nand that\u2019s when we really got to know what was happening in Germany. The British were\nbrining in Yugoslavs from the coast of Dalmatia. There was one camp that held about\n20,000 people, and there was another camp which we \u2014 we, the new units \u2014 were sent up\nto take care of on the Suez Canal, a place called Khataba, K-h-a-t-a-b-a, and when these\npeople came in, they were emaciated. They had women who were breastfeeding children\nof four and two. Their breasts were like envelopes. They had suffered tremendous\nmalnutrition. The British had taken them from Dalmatia to southern Italy, which was\nliberated, and then brought them into Egypt, but I must say the food that was provided for\nthem was excellent. The sun didn\u2019t hurt. They lived in tents. There were very few men.\nThey were mostly women and children, boys of 14 who had been in the army, who had\nlost limbs. And gradually they recovered. And my job at that time was to set up schools.\nWell, how do you set up schools for children when you have \u2014 there were two trained\nteachers, in fact, but no books, no pencils. We had learned some Yugoslav, and some of\nus were better at it than others. The army was wonderful. You could always get around\nthe quartermaster. And I discovered that there were little white stones in the sand in the\ndesert on which we were. So, we gathered the stones, and this how we taught them to\nwrite. We had \u2014 we were given a couple of tents, and then the ladies from Alexandria, as\nthere are always ladies who want to do good, came to the camp with shoes, and most of\nthese children hadn\u2019t worn shoes in their life, and they were afraid of these things. But we\nsay to them, \u201cLook, these ladies really are very kind. They\u2019re also bringing clothing.\nWhile they are here, please wear the shoes. When they\u2019re gone, you can take them off.\u201d It\nwas rather nice. I remember that instant.",
        "A: Oh, you formed letters with them. Later on, we were able to get some paper, and the\nladies from Alexandria actually were very good. When we told them what we needed,\nthey began to send paper and pencils in, and what we did, we sent some people from our\ncamp over to the larger camp of refugees, where they were trained to be teachers. They\nwere trained in one month to be schoolteachers and came back. They did a remarkable\njob. There was a war on, and everything was possible during the war. I think also because\nmost \u2014 well, I think almost all of us in Britain had suffered the bombing and suffered the\nwar. We could compromise, we could change things around, we learned very quickly to\nput up tents, we were sleeping four of us in a tent. I remember the dreadful latrines,\nwhich were seemed to me a mile long, and with hession, a sort of canvas in between, and\nyou lived like this. We ate fairly well. I was never sick. Some people got dysentery. I\ndidn\u2019t. Everything we ate on our own, which we weren\u2019t sure of, we put potassium tablets\nin the water to disinfect any nasty creatures, and we lived that way until October of \u201944.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t have to tell stories. You looked at them. You looked at the babies with big\nstomachs and big heads, and some women were breastfeeding children of two and\nchildren of four. She was feeding two babies, because they had had no real food for so\nlong. In our units, by the way, there were many doctors who volunteered, women, and\nthey immediately set up a hospital, but we got a measles epidemic, and in eight weeks, I\nthink, we buried \u2014 no, six weeks, we buried over a hundred children, and that was\ndreadful because we lived within the hospital compound, and they crying of these women\nwas absolutely dreadful, dreadful. To lose a child, no parent should bury a child. It was\nawful for them.",
        "A: Ten months.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I never even thought of it that way. We had a job to do. We did our job. The Yugoslavs,\nas they got well, entertained us. They had beautiful singing voices, and they would sing\nin four, five parts. There were some others who were musicians, and they were very nice\npeople, very nice. They were very clean people. A lot of them, I would say for the most\npart, were peasant people, but, you know, they were human beings.",
        "A: Oh, because southern Italy was liberated, and the allies were getting ready for the\nliberation of Yugoslavia, which we had been trained to enter. Trained in the sense that we\nlearned the language, we knew where we were going, we knew the kinds of jobs we\nwould do, and because of the work we had done in Egypt, we were trained to take care of\nYugoslavs who had gone through hell in this war. When we got to Italy, I happened to\nhave been in the first unit of ten people who were sent over to Italy in preparation for\ngoing into Yugoslavia, and Teeter was approached by the British American armies. I\u2019m\nnot quite sure of the chain of command. He said, \u201cWe\u2019ll do the job ourselves. Send us the\ngoods.\u201d And they did. They did a very good job. So, here we were, the rest of the unit had\ncome into Italy, we were sitting there. The Italians were very pleased to see us. The\nItalians were very nice actually. They were living under appalling conditions, having\nsuffered German occupation and British occupation, and they would have liked us to\nhave stayed, but we really had no job to do in Italy. And then we heard one organization\nworking in southern Italy called the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. They\nhad, I think it was one representative at the time, a man called Reuben Resnick, working\nthere, and we thought it would be an excellent idea if we could be seconded or loaned to\nthis outfit so that we could help them. We had been given by the army, as had all the\nunits, a three hundred weight truck, and a three ton truck. We all learned to drive that\nDodge which was double the clutch. It was terrifying, but we could all drive them, and\nwe had lots of supplies. And so in talking to the army, and the heads of the units did so,\nwe asked if we could join the American organization and they said, \u201cCertainly, and take\nall your supplies with you.\u201d It was a lot of give and take in those days. They\u2019re much\nmore difficult today. I don\u2019t know why. And so we loaned ourselves to the Joint. We\nwent up to Rome to start with. Florence was still occupied, I remember, because as it was\nliberated, some of our boys took matzohs up to Florence for the first Passover of the\nliberation. I was helping to get ready the first legal transport going to Palestine after the\nwar. I think it left on April the 12\", if my memory serves me, and I remember Moshe\nShertock - I think, yes, that was his name \u2014 went with us, and I and somebody from the\nJoint, Israel, or Gaynor Israel Jacobson, worked on that transport and got that going, and\nit was very interesting because there were \u201cX\u201d number of certificates. People still had to\nhave certificates from the British government to enter Palestine, and let\u2019s assume that we\nhad 300, and they were all numbered. As people got on, the cards of those in front were\ntaken and given to others at the back. So, although 300 were supposed to be on the ship,\nprobably there were 400 or 500. I never did know how many got on, and that ship went\noff. That was one of the things we did. We also, which were helping people who would\ncome in from Yugoslavia in small boats. I remember, the women would come in with\nhand grenades around their waists, great big burly women, very nice, but terrifying. And\nwe met a lot of people, and then, of course, the Germans were still trying to bomb us, and\nI know, I remember very distinctly, when the Germans came over, of course, the\nAmericans \u2014 the American civilians who hadn\u2019t seen any of this stuff, any of the\nbombing, would rush to the windows, and we Britishers would rush under the beds\nbecause we knew what shattered glass could do. It was an interesting time. When \u2014 yes, it\nwas an interesting time, and as Italy began to be liberated, some of our people were going\nup north. When Greece was liberated, I was asked by the European director of the Joint\nDistribution Committee, a very wonderful man called Dr. Joseph Schwartz. He was a\nrabbi by training, and really a very, very wonderful human being, one of my heroes. He\nasked me if, when Greece was liberated, I would go into Greece with their director, and\nof course, who would refuse? And, I was in Greece \u2014 well, the war was still on \u2014 when\nthe camps were liberated, and people, I think, don\u2019t realize that so many thousands of\npeople had been incarcerated in concentration camps and labor camps, and the army had\nno place for them once they were liberated, and the only thing they thought of doing was\nsending these people home. So, being in Greece at the time of the end of the war,\nsuddenly the trains began to come in with these young men and women, many of them\nspitting blood from tuberculosis, no families. Out of a total, I think, of 70,000 Jews in\nGreece, there were about a total of 10,000 who survived all together, both in hiding and\namong those who came back, and I remember some of them having to sleep in the street.\nIt was summer. It was June when they got back. They had to sleep in the street because\nthere were no sanitarium \u2014 no sanitarium beds for them, and it was very, very difficult\nbecause none of them family. There were girls with no sisters or brothers. There were\nboys with no family. Occasionally, you\u2019d see an adult who son or daughters had been\nkilled, and this organization, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, set up a\nhostel in Athens with a very wonderful local Greek lady called Mrs. Mossieri. I\u2019m sure\nher children are still alive. She was a go-getter, and she helped to set up this hostel. I\nwent with Israel Jacobson to Palestine at that time to meet with Golda Meir and Mr.\nSheretz Shatok (ph), and I can\u2019t think of the other gentleman\u2019s name at the moment, to\ntalk to them about supplies that we would need and also people were beginning to go\nthrough Athens to Palestine illegally. It was very easy. Perez was next to Athens. They\nsent in some of their units of workers. There were people, ostensibly press agents. All the\nmarvelous people, and one of the things that we asked at that time was that you slow\ndown the movement because the British would come to what was known as a Hachshara,\na camp, at Perez, and count the individuals there. And I remember the one day they came\nand they said, \u201cWhere is everybody?\u201d And we said, \u201cThey\u2019ve gone home.\u201d That was\nnice.",
        "A: I was working as a volunteer with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee.",
        "A: Yes, we all split up. That whole unit of ten persons was split up. Some people went into\nAustria. Most of them stayed in Italy. There was a lot of work to do in Italy because\npeople were coming into Italy to try and go either to Palestine or to register with a\nconsulate, if an American consulate was open, to join family in the United States or to\nleave Europe \u2014 one thing people wanted to do was to leave Europe at this time.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I was working to help refugees, survivors. And that\u2019s all I was doing, and whenever\nor wherever I could do it best was all that matter to me. It never occurred to me. I don\u2019t\nthink I\u2019m a political animal, actually, but no, that never occurred to me, and the\nAmericans had supplies. You see, after the war, I suppose, the Americans realized a) they\nmight have done more before the war, and b) they had money. The British were bankrupt\nby now. The British had nothing. They had no foreign currency. Everything was bombed.\nThey had no housing. I know how my family was living. No, I never felt disloyal at all. I\nwas only working to help survivors.",
        "A: No, we flew.",
        "A: Yes, we flew.",
        "A: Yes, it was my first plane ride.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I had time to be scared. No, it wasn\u2019t. That\u2019s not true. It wasn\u2019t my first\nplane ride. In 1943, no, I beg your pardon, at the end of 1944, I was \u2014 I received word\nthat my mother was ill, and I managed to hitchhike on a plane to London, to Croyden\nAirport, and it was interesting because when I got to Croyden there was a big loud thump\nas a bomb, and I thought that the bombing was finished, and I said to the porter who was\nhelping me off, I said, \u201cWhat on earth is that?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s a doodlebug, lady.\u201d\nDoodlebug would be bombs which were unmanned that they were sending from Holland\ninto Britain and they suddenly stopped and dropped. I saw my mother. She was delighted,\nof course, to see me. She did survive that illness, and I managed to get back on a ship that\nwas going to Italy. And, so, I arrived back about a month later. That was my \u2014 sorry, that\nwas my first \u2014 the trip to England was my first plan trip.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: No, she only heard from me once I landed in Egypt. The mail was so bad, very few\npeople had access to telephones, and they were often not working. I don\u2019t think it even\nworried her. My older brother, who actually was 21 years older than I, when I told him I\nwas going to volunteer, he said, \u201cMother will be terribly upset.\u201d I said, \u201cI have talked to\nher. She thinks it\u2019s a wonderful idea.\u201d Absolutely true. And I didn\u2019t tell him, either. I\ndidn\u2019t tell anybody in the family because you were sworn to secrecy. The ship could be\nsunk. And so they only heard from me after I arrived in Egypt.",
        "A: Initially, there weren\u2019t individuals that one would single out. Everybody who I knew was\ndoing a tremendous job. As I say, living in tents in the desert. We didn\u2019t feel that we were\nsuffering in any way. I guess we weren\u2019t being bombed, which was rather nice. We had a\njob to do. So, Egypt was okay. Occasionally, we could get into Cairo and see where\nnormal people lived and had normal facilities. No, Egypt was okay.",
        "A: Yes, yes, which, you know, we were using trenches in the desert. When we got to Italy,\nconditions there, 1n a sense, were not as good as in Egypt because the Italians had no\nheating in the houses in which were builted (ph) and there were little fires in the rooms\nwith pipes going out of the window. Fortunately, there was no carbon monoxide coming\nout of them. The Italians were suffering very badly. So, and we had no gripes. I mean, we\nwere well taken care of. By now, we had winter uniforms. We were dressed, by the way,\nas American army officers. We had PX facilities, which, to us, were fantastic. You know,\nwe hadn\u2019t seen some of the things we saw in the PX since before the war. We had very\nlittle money, but that didn\u2019t matter, you know.",
        "A: We had ten shillings, which at that time was, I suppose, something near two dollars. That\npaid for the dobe, the laundry, and whatever was left over.",
        "A: I think it was \u2014 it must have been a week because there was lots of laundry \u2014 yes, it was\nten shillings a week, I think. It would\u2019ve have had to been. Maybe it was a month. I don\u2019t\nremember. Money never bothered me. There was nowhere to spend it, anyway, and when\nwe were in the desert in Egypt, there certainly was no PX. The only time we met the PX\nwas when we arrived in Italy because the Americans were there, and they had the PX and\nthey were very generous. The American boys in the army were quite extraordinary. They\nwould give away their bomber jackets when they thought we were cold. You know,\nthey\u2019d pass them over to us. They\u2019d offer to buy anything they could for us in the PX,\nand those who had money were able to take care of themselves, and people were nice.\nYou know, they\u2019d buy stuff that we all could share. There were foodstuffs available in\nthe PX which we hadn\u2019t seen in a long time.",
        "A: Well, there were canned nuts. I remember loving peanuts, which we hadn\u2019t seen in years\nand years and years. The only thing we had that was cheap was we could buy liquor at\nseven and sixpence, I remember, for a bottle of scotch, and it was very good, I gather, for\nbribing people. I didn\u2019t drink, so, you know, I lost out there, but you know, these things\nin a sense didn\u2019t bother one. We were fed but we were doing a job. We weren\u2019t\nconcerned. I must be honest there.",
        "A: In Italy.",
        "A: Or in Egypt.",
        "A: Well, they cooked Yugoslav food, and they cooked very well, and occasionally they\nwould invite us to come and enjoy a meal with them because our food was cooked by the\nArab cooks, and it was okay. There was nothing wrong with it, but Yugoslavs are very\ngood cooks. It was heavier food than we were used to.",
        "A: The army, and I suppose at that time it was the British army since the British were in\nEgypt, in control.",
        "A: The army provided the food for the refugees. Camps were immediately set up. One in\nSanta Maria di Bari, which is down on the heel of Italy. That was a Jewish DP camp.\nThen, there was another one in Cine Citta in Rome, which was the movie studio in Rome.\nThat was set up as a displaced persons camp because a lot of people were released who\ndidn\u2019t belong in Italy. There were Romanians, Hungarians, they were all nationalities,\nand no house to go to, or they couldn\u2019t go because those places weren\u2019t liberated yet.\nSo...",
        "A: Yeah, lots of holding actions for these people, and for others, they were sent home. I\ndon\u2019t know to what homes they were sent. I\u2019m talking not only of Jews at this point. A lot\nof the Russians were sent back, as you probably know, and I don\u2019t think a lot of them\nlasted. A lot of them had been volunteer workers with the Germans. Some of them were\nSlave laborers. It was a very, very difficult stage for the army because, for the most part,\nthey were still flushing out the Nazis, and yet they had this civilian population whom they\ndidn\u2019t understand, by the way. They tried to treat them when the camps were liberated as\nthough they were former Nazis. They locked them up in other camps until, you know, the\narmy came to understand who these people were and until there was communication with\nthe voluntary agencies like the American Joint Distribution Committee.",
        "A: There were very few \u2014 there were three or four or five or six 1n among the Yugoslavs, but\nI think they didn\u2019t stay long in the camp. I think they were able to cross the Suez into\nPalestine.",
        "A: No, in Italy, it was different. Firstly, there were the displaced people. They were\nYugoslav Jews. They were Russian Jews. They were all kinds of Jews. They were Italian\nJews. In Rome, there was quite a community of Jews who had been in hiding. There was\na Jewish orphanage in Rome, for example, which had been taken over by the Catholics.\nThe Catholics had taken the Jewish children from the orphanage and had hidden them in\ntheir orphanage out of town, and then they\u2019d hidden them again, and when the Catholic\norphanage was bombed, the one that was out of town, the American Joint Distribution\nCommittee rebuilt it for them as a thank you for having saved the Jewish children, and\nthen our units \u2014 because we had volunteers \u2014 the Joint had administrators who, we had\nvolunteers who set up the orphanages again. They had experience in working in\norphanages. It was quite an exciting time in a way to do positive things \u2014 to see children\nsmiling, children who hadn\u2019t been incarcerated, because we\u2019d seen firstly the Yugoslav\nchildren who had been starving, and we began to get pictures of what was happening in\nGermany. We used to occasionally get shown German film that had been captured of the\nNazis throwing children over the balcony, you know, it was ghastly, ghastly.",
        "A: No, I traveled around. I traveled around Italy.",
        "A: Right, for example, if I went down, let\u2019s say to Santa Maria di Bari, I would go there,\nfirst you\u2019d see how the camp was running. It was amazing how, without any experience,\none became an expert. I did have something kind of social administration training, and I\nthink I was instinctively an administrator. I would see what was needed 1n that camp. For\nexample, we had one of our unit members in charge of a search bureau which we set up\nimmediately because the important thing was to try to reunite families. We had no baby\nclothes because once people \u2014 the camps were liberated and people began to lead normal\nlives, women began to menstruate again. They hadn\u2019t menstruated all through the war,\nand being normal human beings they began to get pregnant and have babies. We needed\nsanitary napkins for the women. We needed baby clothing. We needed special food for\npregnant women. There were some older people who survived. We needed special food\nfor them. We needed doctors. We needed more social workers. And one could assess this,\nand gradually these people came in to work in the camps. It was exciting in the sense that\nyou felt you could do something positive, and then the most important thing, I think, at\nthat time was the search bureaus that we set up. And they were interesting because, for\nexample, you had to very quickly learn that the name \u201cSchwartz\u201d, for example, S-c-h-w-\na-r-t-z, can be spelled 30 different ways, and how do you distinguish? How do you find\nIvan Schwartz from Belgrade, for example? You then knew you had to have his\nbirthdays, his parents\u2019 names, their birthdays, where they were born, and you set up a\nvery good system internationally. The headquarters, at one point after Germany was\nliberated, was Arolsen in Germany. There was a big unit in London set up by the World\nJewish Congress and there was a big unit also in New York, and I think they were right.\nThe most important thing was to help people find family. This went on for years. It still\ngoes on. People are still finding relatives, close relatives.",
        "A: Absolutely not.",
        "A: And, no typewriters.",
        "A: Okay, Ill give you an example. If we were in Vienna, and you came and you said, \u201cMy\nname is Joan Koppelbaum. I come from Warsaw. I had a mother and father and three\nsisters and four brothers, and I managed to escape. I don\u2019t know what happened to them.\nMy parents, I think, were taken to a camp. I think my brothers and sisters may have\nescaped.\u201d What we would do, we would send these lists of people who are asking for\nrelatives to each office, and each office would contact the next office to see if they had\nany of these people registered with them. We did use the Red Cross, but we found we\nwere more efficient, I must be honest, than the Red Cross. Firstly, the Red Cross took\nmuch longer than we did. We knew that time was of the essence. These lists were passed\naround, and we all got copies of these lists. So, if we were looking for your relatives, we\ncould look and say, \u201cHey! Your aunt, we haven\u2019t found your parents yet, but your aunt is\nin Salzburg.\u201d And very often, of course, when these people came to our offices, all the\nwalls had their names written on them, and one would write, \u201cI\u2019m Ivan Schwartz. I\u2019m\ngoing to Rome.\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019m Ivan Schwartz. I\u2019m going to Munich. You will find me. I will\nbe with so-and-so.\u201d It was like the tom-toms working. And in the beginning, this 1s how\npeople found each other.",
        "A: Oh, they\u2019d scribble on our walls.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, on the walls. And we had, let\u2019s say \u2014 we had five or six rooms, and these messages\nwere on the walls. We would also take notes from them, but \u2014 and, sometimes, a father\nwould find a son in the office, and I can\u2019t tell you the emotion of that moment.\nEverybody was so thrilled, and everybody cried. You know, I still get emotional because\nI saw so much of this. It was wonderful, wonderful, and then you would hear the sadness.\nYou know, \u201cYour mother got killed.\u201d Or \u201cI don\u2019t know where your mother is.\u201d And\nsometimes it would take months and months to trace a family member, and as I say, they\nare still tracing family members. I hear stories from Poland today where they are still\nfinding people alive in the States who they thought had died. You know, in the old days,\nwhere we had immigration at the turn of the century, relatives lost touch with each other,\nand after this calamity, they certainly lost contact.",
        "A: But we hadn\u2019t suffered. They had suffered. This was the difference. We were there to\nhelp them. I don\u2019t think we ever thought of ourselves in this \u2014 I\u2019m being honest, I don\u2019t\nthink I ever felt that I had suffered anything at all. You know, it was just so wonderful\nwhen you found a relative for somebody or when you were able to find a house for\nsomebody to live in. I don\u2019t think, and I\u2019m not saying we weren\u2019t selfish people, we were\nnormal human beings, but the job was so in a sense exciting. Can you imagine going up\nto a town that\u2019s been liberated and the Jews there finding \u2014 there were Jews, mostly we\nwere British or the American in charge of the Joint would come up, and they\u2019d see us in\nuniform or they\u2019d see us, members of the Jewish Relief Units with the Shield of David on\nour shoulders and, you know, the Star of David on our berets. It was so hard for them to\nbelieve that Jews had survived as Jews without being taken prisoner or had come to help\nthem. I don\u2019t think \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine anybody that I know of, and we were all very\ndifferent people, being concerned for ourselves in that sense. I don\u2019t think we could\u2019ve\nbeen because we might eventually have gone home more quickly. I mean, some of us\nstayed on for years to help until the displaced persons camps were liberated.",
        "A: Yes, I was an American army officer in uniform. My papers said I had the status of a\nlieutenant colonel, and it said, in fact, on my identity card that if I were taken prisoner by\nthe Germans, I was to be treated as an officer. I still have those documents.",
        "A: No, in Egypt, I was in British army officer\u2019s uniform.",
        "A: We wore skirts. Women didn\u2019t wear trousers at that time. We wore skirts, and some of\nthe American women had nylon stockings. They must have been an inch thick, now that I\nremember, but of course, they got them at the PX and they gave us some. No, I think they\ngave us, I don\u2019t think they sold them to us, and it was wonderful to wear a decent pair of\nhose. You know, we hadn\u2019t had them in years. The Americans were very generous, I\nmust say, very generous.",
        "A: That\u2019s a very good question, isn\u2019t it? When it was warm, of course, everything was\nwashed. I think the army had a cleaning service. I remember, in Vienna, there was an\nAmerican cleaners, and I met somebody who worked in Vienna with me, and she said,\n\u201cYou used to come around every week and ask if anybody had cleaning, and you would\ntake it to the cleaners for us.\u201d I don\u2019t remember it, but she told me this was so.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right, no, we had, through the Red Cross, I think, or through the PX, we had a cleaning\nsystem. Funny, those things I don\u2019t even recall because I suppose that wasn\u2019t important to\nUS.",
        "A: No. We all had the same status. Everybody had the same status. We had one unit leader, a\nwoman who ran our unit was Phyllis Gerson, who after the war, the British government\ngave what\u2019s known as a MB, a Master- a Member, rather, of the British Empire award to\nher for having served in this unit, and the British government was very interesting. They\nso valued our work, I think, that after the war they presented us with the same medals\nthey gave to fighting servicemen. I have mine. I would never use them, even the\ndecorative ones, because I didn\u2019t think we earned them. You know, we weren\u2019t fighting,\nbut I thought it was a very generous gesture.",
        "A: Excellent. How\u2019s it going?\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Yes, these were Greek Jews. The situation was worse because in \u2014 firstly, in Egypt, we\nhad many volunteers working with the people who the British were bringing in from the\ncoast of Dalmatia. In Greece, we were two foreigners, there was the head of the Joint\nDistribution Committee and I, and some local workers, and in Egypt, they hadn\u2019t been in\nconcentration camp, and no matter how much people had suffered, they hadn\u2019t suffered\nthe brutality, the inhumanity of the Germans in the sense of the people who came back\nfrom concentration camps had. We had girls who came back who had tattooed across\ntheir stomachs, \u201cNur fuer ofitserin\u201d \u201cOnly for officers\u201d. They were used in brothels. The\nboys, very many of them, had been castrated. So, in addition to all their suffering, in one\nsense, the suffering was even worse than others, and yet, none of them had families to\ncome back to. There wasn\u2019t a mother and a father. If there was a brother, there was\nnobody else. If there was a sister, there was nobody else. There were no complete\nfamilies left in Greece. As I mentioned earlier, I remember very clearly, the population\namong Jews in Greece had been 70,000 before the war, and after the war there were\n10,000. That\u2019s a tremendous percentage of Jews who were killed.",
        "A: They were from different concentration camps. I don\u2019t think any of them had been in\nlabor camps. I think they were in concentration camps, which were death camps.",
        "A: Oh, yes, I\u2019m talking about the Jews. There were some non-Jews who came back to\nGreece. I must say we helped them, too, where we could, that we didn\u2019t differentiate. For\nthe most part, 1t was Jews who were deported.",
        "A: That we couldn\u2019t help them enough. They were so ill, so many of them. They were\nsuffering from TB, and there were no sanitaria where you could put them and nurse them\nback to health. You had, you know, we had to set up places extempore and put them in\nbeds. You didn\u2019t have the medical facilities. You didn\u2019t have the medicines, and at that\ntime, streptomycin wasn\u2019t yet available. So, you know, these people were really\nsuffering. They were very, very ill. They suffered tremendously, and it was very difficult\nto see it.",
        "A: One didn\u2019t know who had tuberculosis. Some were obviously tubercular because they\nwere spitting blood. We were not concerned for ourselves. It\u2019s an interesting question\nyou ask, because it never occurred to me that this was a contagious disease that I might\nget. It had never occurred to me. I\u2019m sure none of the other workers had thought of it in\nthat sense. The main concern was to get these people treated, and Greece had very few\nbeds available. Greece had suffered tremendously anyway under the Germans, you see.\nThey were occupied. And that was a very difficult time.",
        "A: Of our people-",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember them dying. I don\u2019t remember them dying. Maybe they had\nsurvived because they were so strong. Don\u2019t forget, they come out of camps, had been\nput onto trains, I\u2019m sure without any nursing facilities, and sent across Europe back to\nAthens. They had to have been strong to start with. I\u2019m sure the weak ones hadn\u2019t\nsurvived in the first instance.",
        "A: There weren\u2019t \u2014 they were sleeping \u2014 I remember, I saw it, sleeping on benches in\nConstitution Square in Athens. As I say, it was a warm summer, but there were no places\nto put them. Eventually, gradually, we managed to find places, but some of those men\nwho had been through absolute hell were now sitting \u2014 sleeping in the square. And some\nof them were very angry. I remember, one came into the office once \u2014 it sounds funny at\nthis point \u2014 but, again, he was going to shoot Israel Jacobson, and I sort of stood between,\nthe brave one yet stupid, and he said, \u201cHey that\u2019s a Mauser. I always wanted a Mauser.\nWhat do you want for it?\u201d And this boy, I know this instinct so clearly, and Israel\nJacobson 1s alive \u2014 he can tell you the story, too \u2014 he said, \u201cI want 25 greenbacks.\u201d And I\ndon\u2019t remember whether he wanted them with the yellow seal or the red seal. They\nthought the different seals had different values, and we bought it from him, and I\nremember, we got a friend to row us out to the Aegian and we threw the gun into the\nwater. That was just \u2014 I remember that particularly, because when I stood between them,\nthis wrist was flicked out that way, and this one this way. Eventually my wrists were put\nback, I had terribly swollen hands. So, that was all right.",
        "A: Well, they went for me. You know, they were angry. It was all our fault, wasn\u2019t it? No,\nno, you can understand these men, for heaven\u2019s sake. They came back, there were no\nfamilies, and they wanted money and they knew we had, but not in the office. But, he\ncame \u2014 he was going to kill anybody, he thought. Maybe he didn\u2019t, but, you know, this\nwas a gesture.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. It probably was, yes. It probably was. He must have taken it from a\nGerman he had killed.",
        "A: There was no time, no. No, you can\u2019t be scared just because somebody is threatening to\nkill somebody else. You know, and you got in between. I had very sore hands for a bit,\nbut that was life.",
        "A: I seem to remember more men. There were some young girls who came back, a number\nof them from the island of Rhodes, and we couldn\u2019t send them to Rhodes because there\nfamilies had been killed. There were no families, and that\u2019s when we decided together\nwith this wonderful woman, Mrs. Mossieri, to set up this hostel to house these girls, and\nwe helped them, of course, immediately, also to join families. So, some of them came to\nthe States. Some went to Canada. Some of them stayed in Greece. Some went to Israel.\nWe tried to help them join families wherever we could because what 1s life without\nfamily?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the Greek hierarchy being interested. Now, maybe that\u2019s because I was\nso busy and never contacted them, but we were in contact with Mr. McVeigh who was\nthe American ambassador there because there was a change of currency at one point,\nwhich we tried to fight successfully. Spiros Sikuros was there. I went with him on a plane\nfrom Italy to Greece, and he was very nice because he helped us to get the Nuremburg\nlaws rescinded. They were still in effect in Greece after the war.",
        "A: Yes, and I remember there was a man, a major called, Moish Perlman (ph), who later\nbecame, I think, the press attach\u00e9 for the Israeli government, 1f my memory serves me, I\nthink that\u2019s right. Spiros Sikuros, whose son was in the army. I traveled with him and his\nson on the plane to Athens, and he was very nice, and he helped to get the laws rescinded.\nIt was appalling that they were still in effect, but Greece was still trying to recover itself.\nI don\u2019t think they intended to keep them going, but they didn\u2019t of themselves suggest that\nthese laws be rescinded or the property laws be rescinded. It required this outside\npressure to get them done.",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. There were houses, but there were people living in them, and you\ncan\u2019t just walk into a house when somebody else has taken over your home, and this\nrequired legal procedures, and it took time, and you had to have proof, and these people\nhad to find their papers. These things were not easy, but there were lawyers employed by\nthe Joint Distribution Committee to help these people to get property back, but it was\ndifficult. It took time, especially when you had a country like Greece where they\nthemselves had suffered so much under the Germans. They were still trying to provide\nrestitution to all the Greeks, let\u2019s say, in addition to the Jews. We were interested in\nhelping the remnants of the Jewish community, but the Greeks were interested in helping\nall Greeks. It worked slowly.",
        "A: It worked very slowly.",
        "A: You\u2019re thinking particularly of Poland. That is a very interesting story. Not to my\nknowledge. Not to my knowledge. I didn\u2019t come across it. If it existed, I didn\u2019t know of\nit. But the sad thing in Poland, of course, was the fact that many of these people never\ntold the children who they kept that they were Jewish children until they were dying\nthemselves. And, of course, you know, you now have this Jewish school in Warsaw\nwhere those children\u2019s children attend. It\u2019s very \u2014 tough, tough questions. It\u2019s very hard\nto take 1n a baby of six weeks and four years later, when you\u2019ve loved it and nurtured it,\nto give it up.",
        "A: I was in Greece from April \u201945 until August \u201946.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t think of it in that sense. I was working.",
        "A: Not as much because you couldn\u2019t \u2014 1n the beginning, you couldn\u2019t travel around Greece.\nThe only way to travel that\u2019s safe from Athens to Salonica was by boat. There were no\nbridges. They had to be built. There were no roads. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Yes, we\ntraveled a little to see communities that we could. We\u2019d go up to \u2014 I\u2019m trying to\nremember \u2014 Yanina, which was north of Athens, or to the south, but you couldn\u2019t travel\naround much.",
        "A: To Salonica, by boat.",
        "A: We had Jeeps, army Jeeps.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. No, nobody had carts and stuff.",
        "A: I set up a welfare agency in Athens. These people needed money to buy, and my feeling\nwas you didn\u2019t hand out money to people. It was degrading to them to have to receive\ncharity in that sense. And I set up a system of relief whereby they came to the office, if it\nwas one person, there was that set amount. If it was two people, or a family, there were\ndifferent amounts, and we gave them checks, and they went to the bank and cashed their\nchecks. This was my feeling, and always has been that the only thing that people often\nhave left for themselves 1s their dignity, and this to me was one way of giving it back to\nthem. It worked very well.",
        "A: It was a Joint check, and we had an arrangement with the bank, of course. The bank knew\nus. Our money was coming in through the Bank of Greece. I think Varvaresso was the\npresident, and we knew him quite well. I remember on one occasion, when we had\ndeposited quite a large sum of money, and had been assured that that money would not be\ndevalued, because Greece was constantly devaluing, and one day when Israel Jacobson\nwas on his way by plane, I remember, up to Salonica, I heard that the bank that morning\nhad devalued the drachma, which meant that the $150,000 we had changed was now\nworth about $15. I sent somebody immediately to the airport to bring him back, stop him\ngoing, which we did, and then we got in touch with the American ambassador \u2014 I think\nhe was an ambassador, I\u2019m not sure already. I don\u2019t think he was consul. I think he was\nan ambassador, Mr. McVeigh, and they said, \u201cWell, we just have to accept this.\u201d And\nSpiros Sikuros of Fox Films, I think he was, said, \u201cWell, have to accept this.\u201d\u2019 And, I said\n\u2014and I said to Israel Jacobson, \u201cWe don\u2019t accept this. This is Jewish money that is hard\nto come by. It\u2019s voluntary donations. We\u2019ve got to fight this.\u201d And I remember we fought\nit, and we got our money back. I felt very good about it.",
        "A: Well, you go to the president who has assured you two days before there would be no\ndevaluation, and you face him with his promise. I mean, you\u2019re not scared. You can\u2019t\nhave 150,000 then the next day have 15, and you\u2019re trying to feed people who\u2019ve been\nstarving. It\u2019s amazing how much courage you get when, you know, there\u2019s something\nreally important here.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure there was. It wasn\u2019t talked about. In a sense, it wasn\u2019t black market. If they got,\nlet\u2019s say, cheese given them in cans, you got sick of that cheese. I\u2019ve tasted. So, you\nchanged it for eggs. If that\u2019s black market, there was black market. And there were\npeople were very glad to get it. Or there would be chocolate, which was very nutritious,\nhorrible stuff, and you could swap that for something else, for a can of bully beef or\nsomething. The black market never bothered me. Firstly, 1t was people getting foods that\nthey wanted, and foods they felt they needed, and they were trading. I don\u2019t see that that\nwas such \u2014 they weren\u2019t stealing anything. They were just exchanging, and since it\nwasn\u2019t an official exchange, it was known as a black market. This happened in Austria. It\ncertainly happened in Germany. I didn\u2019t see it as anything bad.",
        "A: Oh, you\u2019re talking of jewelry and stuff like that. That happened, yes. I didn\u2019t see it in\nGreece, by the way. The first time I really came across it was in Germany.",
        "A: Well, it was to help them more so to find places to live, and there was a group in the\ncommunity who was finding places. They weren\u2019t all Athenians. So, they didn\u2019t all own\nproperty in Athens, and they were able to, if they had money, they could rent a room and\nthey could buy food, and eventually we got food in through the American Joint\nDistribution Committee, which we could contribute both to individuals and through the\nsynagogue. The rabbi was there, Rabbi Basel, I think his name was. They were taken care\nof, minimally, I must say, because this 1s all we could do. The war had just finished. It\nwas hard to get stuff put aboard a ship. Money was the thing that you could get. So, we\nwould go into, or sent to Palestine for goods, for clothing, or to Egypt for goods and\nclothing. We were fortunate enough that we had \u2014 there was Mr. Charles Passman in\nPalestine, who was with the American Joint Distribution committee also, a wonderful\ncharacter. I knew him, and he would send us food and send us clothing, and I think we\ndid it also through the Jewish Community in Cairo. You bring back memories.",
        "A: Well, she was a member of, I suppose, the hierarchy in the British \u2014 no, sorry, beg your\npardon \u2014 in the Palestine Jewish community. She was one of the political animals as well\nas Sharett, and I can\u2019t think of the others at the moment who I also met. We went to see\nher essentially because people were coming into Athens from the north, escapees. I think\nthe war was still on, and coming down to the hachshara (ph) that was in Perez, and there\nwasn\u2019t enough space. They weren\u2019t moving out quickly enough on the leaderships. I must\nsay the Joint wasn\u2019t arranging illegal movement. I know that.",
        "A: No. It had a very clean nose in that sense. I think they were scared in the sense that if they\ndid anything illegally, and the American government discovered it, they wouldn\u2019t trust\nthem. I know when I was working on immigration, we were terribly careful. But the\nPalestinians were working their ships. We were feeding the people, and-",
        "A: Right, we went to see her because they were coming down rather quickly, and there\nwasn\u2019t enough space in the hachshara to house them, and we really went to ask her to\nslow down the movement a bit so that people came in more slowly, and could be shipped\nout, because the hachshara was rather small, and I guess she did her stuff. It was\ninteresting meeting these people.",
        "A: I had kitchen Greek. That\u2019s what I would say. It wasn\u2019t very good Greek, but I had an ear\nfor language, and could understand what was being said. No, I used English. I also began\nto learn German. I had no idea I was to eventually going to end up in German speaking\ncountries, but that I found easier. And the boys, many of them spoke, or the girls also\nspoke German. They spoke English, too, a number of them, and we, of course, operated\nwith interpreters.",
        "A: Do you mean about their experiences in the camps?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they were ready to talk about it. It never occurred to me at that time, when\nsomebody came back, to talk about it experience in a concentration camp. When you sat\ndown with somebody, you talked to them about how many members of his family were\nthere? Did he know where they were? You talked for the future, not for the past. I must\nsay, in all my experience, I never consciously asked them to talk about their experience in\nconcentration camp. Firstly, for them it was very difficult, especially since they had gone\nin sometimes as a family \u2014 a father and two sons, and this was the only son who survived,\nand purely by the grace of God, no other reason. We never asked them to. Some of them\ndid tell you of their experiences, and you listened. We didn\u2019t ask questions. They had a\nneed to talk, and you had to have a good ear and listen. Some of it was horrific. Some of\nit was horrific, but no, I never remember asking about the experience in a camp.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think they did. They had certain codes, I think. They hadn\u2019t all been in the\nsame camp, and those that had, the fact that they were together meant that they had\ncomfort. They were lucky. They had other people they could talk to about what they went\nthrough who would understand. I think they might also have thought we couldn\u2019t\npossibly understand, and how could we? How could we understand the brutality and the\nkillings and the horrific things that they had to do? No, you didn\u2019t ask.",
        "A: No, I never thought it was aberrant. This was very intentional by many, many people. I\nthink when people would tell me their stories, I used to think, \u201cAnd they survived this.\u201d\nAnd the important thing was to get them away from this. I mean, how could people go\nthrough the kind of thing they had? The bombing 1n London was nothing compared to\nthis, and that horrified me. I was terrified. No, I seem to remember also when people\nwould come and tell some horrific stories that you couldn\u2019t cry with them. You were\nthere to help them. I used to say to some of the people who work for me, particularly\nwhen I went into Austria and then Germany, \u201cWe can\u2019t cry with them. We can cry for\nthem afterwards, but we have to help them.\u201d I don\u2019t know where this attitude came from,\nfrankly. I think it\u2019s always been there.",
        "A: Oh, when we got home and we would talk. We were a group living in the same apartment\nbuilding, and I remember Hannah Kisch, who was a wonderful woman, originally from\nLithuanian who immigrated to South Africa and came up to help us, and she would tell a\nstory and be sobbing, you know, and we would share stories that we\u2019d heard, but it didn\u2019t\nlast for long. We didn\u2019t have time to do this. You know, when we were working, we\nstarted, I suppose, at seven or eight in the morning, and who knows what time at night\nwe'd finish. There were no days off. There was no closing the office because it was dark\nor something. You were working all the time. Sometimes, some of the people were in the\noffice all night. I don\u2019t remember being, except once or twice in Salonica, working late\ninto the night, or in Italy when we were working on this transport to Palestine, working I\nthink all night through. I don\u2019t remember it, but you just did it, and 1t wasn\u2019t work, you\nsee, you were helping people. And I think we were lucky and a number of people who\nvolunteered to go overseas were of similar ilk, and if they weren\u2019t \u2014 some of them went\nhome after the year\u2019s contract was up, which was just as well.",
        "A: Yes. But that was all right. That was all right.",
        "A: I know of one person who was sent home. I think people left on their own. Some of them\ncouldn\u2019t take this kind of work. Remember, except for those in Britain who\u2019d been throw\nthe Blitz, so we\u2019d had some kind of upheaval in our lives, the average American who\ncame later to work, had had no upheaval. I remember one of the survivors writing to me\nafter he got to the States saying \u2014 we sent him to his aunt \u2014 and he was telling me he said\nhow terrible the food rationing was. Sugar was rationed she said during the war, and he\nsaid eventually he just had to pick-up and move out of her house. He said she was a\nlovely woman, but she had no understanding, and I think that\u2019s partly answer to the\nquestion of why did it take so long for people to start talking because nobody in a sense\nwas interested.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. We socialized with each other. We weren\u2019t very many. When we had\ntime to socialize. We ate in a different place, obviously. We ate in the billets that we were\nput in, and some of these people were people I\u2019d normally in normal life have as friends,\nand we could socialize. But we were on different levels. We were \u2014 we were foreigners.\nWe were help that came in to help them. We socialized with the people we employed to\nwork with us, and that \u2014 most of them were wonderful people. You know, if you give\npeople a chance, they will. Some of them were gaz/onim, gangsters in English, but a lot\nof them were wonderful people. You couldn\u2019t socialize with everybody, obviously, but\nthe people we worked with, we socialized with. We would have dinner with them. Invite\nthem to our mess, you know, we were eating in an army mess, and that food was different\nfrom theirs. There wasn\u2019t very much socialization in the sense that we use that word. At\nnight, we were quite often very tired, and were glad to put our feet up. Some of them\nwould come and put their feet up with us and have a drink maybe and then go home. So,\nit wasn\u2019t socialization in the general sense of the word.",
        "A: Most of the time, yes, I think, under mosquito nets in Greece. It was malaria, still. And\nthere\u2019s a very nice instant I must tell you of. We were taking an antimalarial drug, which\nmade us yellow, and somebody came in, I think, from Palestine, and cabled to Paris that\nwe were looking very ill. We were very yellow, and so we were sent for two weeks to\nPalestine on vacation. How did you tell people this was a result of \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\nwas attaprin (ph), or something we were taking at the time that made us look very yellow.",
        "A: It was lovely.",
        "A: Well, we went to Jerusalem, and we went up to Rosh Pina, and met some friends who\u2019d\nbeen working in Greece, and went into Kibbutzim, and it was lovely. It was lovely to see\nnormal people leading normal lives. We were in Jerusalem, which was really a lovely,\nlovely city, a lovely city. It was very nice.",
        "A: No, they hadn\u2019t gone yet.",
        "A: No, I\u2019m talking of \u201945. No, they hadn\u2019t gone yet.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Two of us.",
        "A: Oh, you\u2019re talking of the Jewish Relief Unit, no, when I talk of Greece, I was there alone\nwith a representative of the Joint Distribution Committee. Two of us went. No, the others\nwere either in Italy still, or had gone into Austria, but in terms of vacation, you never\nthought of vacation. I\u2019m not saying we were self-sacrificing. That never occurred to us.\nYou worked, and the work wasn\u2019t work. It didn\u2019t feel like work. It\u2019s very difficult to\nexplain. You were helping people who needed help desperately, and I guess we took days\noff occasionally. I don\u2019t remember, but I\u2019m sure we did, or we went \u2014 yes, we did, of\ncourse. We\u2019d go up and see one of the Greek ruins somewhere. You know, drive, take the\nJeep where you could drive to and have lunch at the seaside taverno, which was very\nnice. Oh, yes.",
        "A: In June.",
        "A: The Greeks were shooting up people reading the Communist newspapers in\nConstitutional Square, I remember. That was how they celebrated the end of the war. Our\noffice overlooked the Square.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. You know, all in a days work, kind of thing. At a very early age, you got used\nto seeing this kind of thing, and it was horrible, horrible.",
        "A: No, supplies began to come in. For example, we were very indiscriminate still at that time\nin using DDT to disinfest people. You know, in Egypt, we disinfested the Arabs, poor\nsouls. God knows how much we got up our own nostrils. Who knew it was such a\npoison? And we stopped using DDT at one point, but I remember puffing it into the\nArabs galobiers (ph), you know? Things began to change as people began to get a place\nto live, found family, decided they would immigrate, registered with a consulate, had\nfamily members contact them. Nobody would come in, and there was very little civilian\ntraffic between Europe and the United States or Australia, and they still couldn\u2019t go to\nPalestine except legally \u2014 if they were going legally on a certificate. So, movement was\nslow, but gradually things began to get a bit better, and as I say, as people began to find\nrelatives, things were better. It was very slow, very slow, and people were ill for a long\ntime, a long time, and to get property back took years. You couldn\u2019t see it in increments.\nIt didn\u2019t happen quickly. Look how long it took to get reparations from Germany. They\nstarted in \u00b045 and the reparations began to come through at the end of the \u201940s, and these\nwere with all the great powers working together and Germany willing to give back in\npart.",
        "A: In August of 1946, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, my hero, a blessing really \u2014 he really was a\nwonderful man with a wonderful sense of humor and a marvelous administrator \u2014 asked\nme if I would go up into Austria. He said President Truman in December of 1945, on the\n22\" of December, had passed \u2014 had issued a directive which enabled people who were\ndisplaced persons to get priority for American visas under the quota system. In other\nwords, they still had to go through the quota, but they would get visas rather than people,\nlet\u2019s say, who\u2019d lived in England or South America, and he said they\u2019d had somebody\nthere working, but who hadn\u2019t panned out, and would I do this? Well, I would have done\nanything this man asked me, and so I went up into Athens, but I knew nothing of\nAmerican immigration law, and I must say, I sat down for four days with this American\nimmigration law from 1924, I think it was, and then with the Truman Directive, and\ngradually began to get things together, and it didn\u2019t take too long. Firstly, here was\nsomething very positive. We were going to be able to help people to leave Austria \u2014\ndisplaced persons and Austrian Jews. And the first problem we had was that those Jews\nfrom Austria who had returned to Vienna from camps were not considered displaced\npersons by the consuls, but the International Refugee Organization had registered them as\ndisplaced persons, which they were. They didn\u2019t have their homes. They didn\u2019t have their\njobs. Some of their family members had been killed, and so, we set up a test case. When I\nsay we, I was very brazen, I must confess, and I established a precedent case showing\nhow this man \u2014 I won\u2019t give you his name, he lives in the States today \u2014 how this man\nhad lost family, had lost his home, had come back, had no where to live, was being\nhoused by the American voluntary agency, and essentially he was still a displaced person,\nand we won the case. So, he could get a visa and go to the United States. When this\nhappened, we could put through other Austrian Jews. There weren\u2019t too many left, and\nget them visas, and then we could help the others to get visas. And the interesting thing\nwas we began to work rather swiftly. My thought was firstly we must get young people\nout because the young people are the future of any community. Secondly, we must get all\nthose people out who have relatives who will help them. That meant they would not be a\ncharge on the voluntary agency\u2019s funds, which really had to harness its money, and also it\nwould give them back a normal life, and so these people began to move rather swiftly\nthrough the pipeline, and it worked very well until the first Displaced Persons Act,\nAmerican Displaced Persons Act of 1948. This in a sense sounds like a mythical story,\nbut I was in Vienna and some members of the Displaced Persons Commission, I'll think\nof their names in a moment \u2014 Carrousi (ph) and some other people, came into Vienna, I\nthink it was on a Saturday, maybe it was a Friday, and said, \u201c\u201cWe\u2019re ready to issue visas\nunder the Displaced Persons Act. Where are your job and housing assurances? On the\nbasis of those, we can give visas.\u201d Frankly, I\u2019d never seen a job and housing assurance. I\ndidn\u2019t know what it was. I knew we were going to have some, but we were waiting for\nour American agency to send the stuff over, and I said to these men, \u201cOur job and\nhousing assurances are at the printers, at the Allianz gebaude,\u201d which 1s the office where\nwe took all our mimeographing. If you would write one out for me, Ill go over there and\nget it mimeographed. I was lying. I\u2019d never seen one. They were very nice, these\ngentlemen. They wrote it out. I went over to the Allianz gebaude. I mimeographed about\n50. I had all the cases which I knew were okay. I issued a job and housing assurance for,\nand these went to the consulate and these people gave them visas. I called Munich and\ntold the director of immigration there what I had done and what the wording was on this\nthing so when these men eventually got to Salz \u2014 I beg your pardon \u2014 to Munich in a few\ndays, they were ready. Now, our people began to get visas, and I must say within about\nten days a cable came through to the director of the Joint in Austria, Harold Trobe, telling\nhim that was Amy Zahl was doing was illegal and please stop her at once. And he called\nme on the phone and told me this, and so I went to the consulate, I picked up every\nJewish case I could find whether we would have been working with them or not, issued\nthem job and housing assurances, and then stopped. Now, what happened was as the\nships began to take passengers to the States, and we were using army transports, there\nwere a lot of Jews in the first ship \u2014 ship, one ship, two ships, about four ships, and the\npress in the United States, of course, \u201cOnly Jews are getting visas.\u201d There were lots of\nanti-Semitic comments in the press, and I\u2019m sure if you look at the press at that time,\nyou'll find 1t was only because we were on the ball. What we did do, of course, was tell\nthe other agencies what they needed and how to go about it. We didn\u2019t have a counsel of\nvoluntary agencies in Vienna. We did when I got to Germany, but that was very\ninteresting. I felt as though I was doing sort of some really dirty work, but we were\nhelping people to get out.",
        "A: Yes. In order to get a visa, you no longer needed an affidavit from an individual. What\nyou needed was instead an assurance that you would have a job when you got to the\nUnited States and that you would have housing. And voluntary agencies were allowed to\ngive these out because ostensibly, the voluntary agencies in the United States were going\ninto communities and asking them, and they were very good for all displaced persons,\nJewish and non-Jewish, to give job and housing assurances which they did. The Jewish\nand all the other agencies were very cooperative, and many displaced persons did get to\nthe United States on the basis of those job and housing assurances.",
        "A: A particular job.",
        "A: For this particular person in a particular spot in the United States, in a particular town.",
        "A: Okay. If, Ivan Schwartz came to me, and he had met the other provisions of the Truman\nDirective was \u2014 which were that you had to have been in the American, British or French\nzones of Austria or Germany or the British, French or American zones of Vienna or\nBerlin on December the 22\"\", 1945, you were eligible. If you were eligible, we could get\na job \u2014 we would contact the States and we would get \u2014 this is under normal\ncircumstances \u2014 a job and housing assurance for Ivan Schwartz to go to Seattle to be a\ntailor, which he had been before, and on the basis of that, providing he passed his medical\nwith the consulate, providing he passed his security with the CIC, the Counter\nIntelligence Corp, he would get a visa. Those were the only people who were eligible. So,\nwhat I did, since I had job and housing assurances already for people, I just had to sign a\nname to them. In a sense, I did it without authority.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I had no idea what job they did. I wanted to get these people out, and it worked.",
        "A: Families.",
        "A: Oh, it was families and individuals. It was whoever was eligible under the provisions of\nthe directive.",
        "A: Mostly, I would think they were jobs for men because women weren\u2019t a large part of the\nlabor force in \u201945. They were a very small part of the labor force except in munitions\nfactories and things like that, but in Europe women hadn\u2019t been part of the labor force\nbefore the war, and we\u2019re talking of people who hadn\u2019t worked since the war.",
        "A: May not have finished school.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t seem to remember many individual women, and maybe as many\nwomen didn\u2019t survive. I don\u2019t remember as many women alone coming and trying to get\nout under the Displaced Persons Act. That\u2019s a fascinating question because, when I think,\nI always think of families or husband and wives or single men. I don\u2019t remember many\nsingle women.",
        "A: Right, and by the same token, some of the men might have married women they might\nnot otherwise have married because they were born in Germany, let\u2019s say, where the\nquota was good. They were still working on the quota system, remember. So, people\nmarried each other for different reasons, apart from the fact that they were fond of each\nother.",
        "A: I worked in Austria from August \u201946 to October 48.",
        "A: Yes, I used to go into the camps and explain what the law was, how they could become\neligible. I had offices in Salzburg, in Linz, in Innsbruck, and I would call these people\ntogether who run the offices. So, we all ran on the same system. It was a tiring job ina\nway. You had to be on the ball all the time, and you had to have good people, but the\nsystem worked very well, and then, when in 1948, the Displaced Persons Act was passed,\nI was asked, again, by Dr. Schwartz to go into Germany.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: No, I learned German very quickly. I learned it because I didn\u2019t trust interpreters. I didn\u2019t\nknow if they were working for the Russians or for the French or for the British or for the\nAmericans, trying to catch me out. You learned to be very wary living in Vienna. For\nexample, we couldn\u2019t leave Vienna without a propesk, a permit, from the Russians. I still\nhave one as a matter of fact. And what we, I would do when I was going up to Salzburg\nor to Linz, the other side of the Russian zone, I would get on \u2014 there was an American\narmy train known as the Mozart, and we would get on that and that was not inspected by\nthe Russians, but you still had to have a permit to leave Austria. What was the rest of\nyour question?",
        "A: No, I\u2019m sorry. I would go up, let\u2019s say, to Linz, and talk to the people in the office, and\nthen I\u2019d go into a camp and talk to them. I learned Yiddish, also, and I learned to speak\nwith a Polish accent. There\u2019s a different accent if you\u2019re a Russian Jew or Lithuanian\nJew. You have a softer accent. I would talk to them in German or in Yiddish about what\nthey had to do, and why it was taking so long from their point of view, that there was no\nneed to try and come, let\u2019s say, to the office in Vienna, which some of them would try to\ndo or to go to Salzburg. We didn\u2019t have the staff to cope with large numbers, but what\nwas happening and what we were doing and I think the fact that we kept them informed\nof what we were doing helped to stop any rioting that we might have had. I don\u2019t\nremember any rioting at all, actually. We had people who would be very irate and come\nin and bang the table and make all kinds of threats, but I think it helped having offices\nwhere, you may laugh at this, where we set up chairs where they could sit and wait,\nbecause when I first came in, there were no chairs for visitors. They lined up, and one by\none they went in and stood by a desk. Well, this whole thing of dignity which I\u2019d learned\nat a very early age. People \u2014 you don\u2019t give them dignity by making them stand and you\nsit. I remember, what we did in Vienna and I did it again in Germany. We got a great big\nurn, and made coffee, and the nicest person I could find, usually a nice Hungarian boy, I\nwould put in charge of the waiting room, and he\u2019d offer people coffee. They were unused\nto this. A lot of people wouldn\u2019t drink our coffee because they were ultra-orthodox, but\nother people would, and we would have newspapers in the office, and as I told you,\nthey\u2019d go along the walls scribbling their names and where they were going to or leaving\nnotes with somebody and they\u2019d meet each other. It became a meeting place. It worked. It\nworked. Sometimes, they had to wait a long time in order to get seen because we didn\u2019t\nhave colossal staff. The work was tedious. For the consuls, you had to have everything in\norder, and we weren\u2019t only working on American immigration. We were working on\nimmigration to Palestine. No, we weren\u2019t doing the Palestine immigration now. Palestine\nwas being handled by the Jewish agency. We were not working on Palestine. That\u2019s an\nerror. We were working on South America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South\nAfrica, and the paperwork was very slow, but people did begin to move out. But the\nTruman Directive was wonderful because, for the first time, numbers of people began to\nleave, numbers, and the Rothschild Hospital, which was housing so many of these\npeople, began gradually to get \u2014 to lessen in number its occupants. But it was hard work.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t give visas. We were not judges. The people who in the DP camps, there were\nvery few survivors of concentration camps \u2014 I\u2019m thinking of Vienna \u2014 no, there were.\nThere were people who\u2019d survived camps. No, we made no criteria. How can you decide\nthat this need is greater than that need? You know, because he has a new baby and these\ndon\u2019t have a baby and they\u2019 ve both been through hell and only one of that couple had\nbeen through hell. No, no, no, you couldn\u2019t afford to be judgmental. You couldn\u2019t afford\nit. But, as long as they met the criteria, and not a great number did, but a fair number met\nthe criteria, we did everything we could to help them get in. The Immigration and\nNaturalization Service, I must say, were not very kindly disposed toward these people,\nand did everything they could to find some fault where they could deny them entry to the\nUnited States, and then you would have to appeal. This happened occasionally and\nsomebody was absolutely heartbroken when you knew that they were genuine and they\nwere refused entry by the INS having gone through all the medicals and all the other\nchecks, and had been given visas and had written to relatives that they were coming.\nThey suddenly found that Immigration and Naturalization Services found their papers\nwere not in order, let\u2019s say. Those were very hard times, very hard times.",
        "A: We had somebody with legal experience who appealed to the INS, and very often we\nwon our case, very often.",
        "A: Well, I remember one of the \u2014 I know \u2014 I remember the name of the man who was in\ncharge of the INS in Munich. When he told Dorothea Green, who headed up the ORT,\nOrganization for Rehabilitation and Training, who is a very lovely lady, very handsome,\nand she was fighting for a case, and he said to her, \u201cLady, you\u2019re here to get these people\nin. We\u2019re here to keep them out.\u201d And she didn\u2019t lie. And I\u2019m sure this was their attitude.\nThey didn\u2019t like these people. After all, they didn\u2019t speak English. They weren\u2019t well\ndressed by a long shot, and these men didn\u2019t like them, and maybe they\u2019d been given\ninstructions to try and keep them out. I don\u2019t know. No, that was pretty tough, but the \u2014 in\nthe first instance, these people didn\u2019t go to the INS until they got to Bremen. So, they\nwere held back in Bremen. Later on, when the Displaced Persons Act came into being,\nthey sent the INS into different regions so people didn\u2019t accumulate in Bremen, but rather\nwent to Bremen knowing they were going to board a ship.",
        "A: What do you mean, did I take information?",
        "A: I was in charge of the administration, but I handled what I considered to be difficult\ncases. For example, if one of my workers said to me, \u201cAmy, you know, I\u2019m not sure that\nthis man\u2019s papers are really genuine.\u201d Because I must say, the Joint was very, very\ncareful. It would\u2019ve been foolish for us to sponsor cases of people whose documents were\nfalse, because we might have ruined for everybody. I would then take on that case.\nFirstly, 1t was very time consuming, and there were plenty of people lined up, and I\ndeveloped a means of questioning people where, if they could pass my surveillance, I\nwould think that their papers were genuine. If it became apparent to me that really these\npapers were false, I would say to this person, \u201cYou know, we can get you into Canada as\neither a furrier or a tailor or this or that. So, you could \u2014 excuse me \u2014 you could meet your\nrelatives in the United States. Or, if you would like to take your family to Australia, we\u2019 ll\ntry and get you there.\u201d But, I would not sponsor that case. That case became a no-no in\nour office. No, we were very careful in that sense.",
        "A: Okay. It was sad. These people had to prove that they were in Austria, Germany or Italy\non December the 22\u2122, 1945. Now, some of them had gone back to Poland to look for\nfamily and not found them. So, on December the 22\" 1945, they were in Poland rather\nthan in Germany, and they would make false papers to say they were in a Germany town\non that date, so that they could pass. Now, it sound became apparent, for example, the\nImmigration and Naturalization Service would say to them, \u201cWhat color were the\nstreetcars in the town?\u201d because they knew. And very soon, of course, the survivors knew\nwhat color the streetcars were. When you think back, it was horrid to treat people with\nsuch indignity, people who had suffered so much and who had gone to look for relatives\nand this was their crime because, because of that, they couldn\u2019t get visas to the United\nStates. It was horrible.",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t afford to be angry. You had to find ways to overcome this stupidity. You\ngot angry for your clients because you knew they were decent and fine people who\nperhaps been in concentration camp, or they\u2019d be in Koraganda, in Russia because they\nhad fled to Russia from Poland, and then come back, and they worked in the mines. They\nsuffered, and here are these people treating them like gangsters because \u2014 criminals\nrather, because they hadn\u2019t been in a certain place on a certain date. They may have come\nover three days later, by the way, and that was awful. That made you very sad, very sad\nbecause sometimes a mother would get a visa and her adult son wouldn\u2019t. And then what\nwe try and do 1s help the adult son get to Canada because we knew that through Canada\nand the United States, they could work something out where the two relatives could be\njoined again. It was hard to watch.",
        "A: Excellent. Don\u2019t tell me an hour\u2019s gone through again!\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: More than two years.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t meet with Austrians. It was a very difficult situation in the sense that Vienna\nwas occupied by the Americans, the French, the British and the Germans. Each had a\nsector, and there was an international sector, and one had to be very careful not to go into\nthe Russian sector at this time, because you could be arrested. So, it was a bit difficult.\nAlso, Vienna had been bombed, and the only accommodation they had for people like us\nwas in hotels and what were formerly known as studen (ph) hotels. Those were hotels\nwhere somebody came for an hour, and the rooms were very tiny, and that, I found, very\ndifficult to live with, and so I got myself a billet in a private home of some Austrians and\nhad at least a room and a bathroom that I could move around in to myself, and it was a bit\nfurther out from the center. So, it was fairly pleasant. But they had no heating and I had\nto supply coal to heat my room. But it wasn\u2019t bad. You know, I\u2019d come from England,\nremember, not too long ago, and we didn\u2019t have homes to heat after the bombing. So, that\nwas okay.",
        "A: No, these were younger people. The husband had been a Nazi, but as he said, if he\nweren\u2019t a member of the Nazi party, you couldn\u2019t run a business, and I must say, I\nbelieved him also that he was a decent man because, when I was there, he was often sent\npackages from Jews who he\u2019d help to get the Argentine, and they were sending him food\npackages. So, he couldn\u2019t have been all bad.",
        "A: I beg your pardon.",
        "A: With Austrian citizens, well, I had Austrians working in my office, Austrian Jews, but I\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 I had very little contact or almost no contact with Austrians per se.",
        "A: In the immigration office? I had another person from England who was my secretary and\nconfidant, there was a man who originally had been from \u2014 had been Austrian, he now\nlived in Britain, and he helped. And then there must have been eight other local staff, and\nthey were Jewish, essentially because we wanted to give Jews employment, and so we\nwere about a dozen people in my office alone.",
        "A: Yes, this was the Viennese office, which I worked in as well as administrating. Then I\nadministered the office in Salzburg, the one in Linz, which was the other side of the\nRussian zone, and the one in the French zone in Innsbruck, and then we had\nrepresentatives in all the displaced persons camps because we would go out to them to\nsave people having to travel to Vienna, which they couldn\u2019t do unless they had permits to\ngo through the Russian zone, and that, nobody was keen to do at this time. We would go\ninto the camps, and tell them things which were necessary for them to know, or collect\npapers, or bring them papers for signature. It was a bit of an awkward program, although\nit worked very well. Or they could go into Salzburg, where there papers were held. It was\nnot an easy situation actually because we were always worried that there might be\nRussians around trying to pick up people because sometimes we had Russian army\nofficers who were Jewish. For example, a woman came to me one day dressed almost in\nrags with dyed hair looking very ugly, and she said her husband and daughter were in\nPalestine. She was a doctor in the Russian army, and there was a certificate for Palestine\nfor her at the British consulate, could we help her? Well, the first thing you think 1s, \u201cA\nha! She\u2019s a spy. She wants to see what we\u2019re doing.\u201d And I took all her particulars and I\nwent across to the British consulate, and sure enough there was a certificate, but that\nwasn\u2019t enough as far as I was concerned. I contacted friends who were working with the\nJewish agency for Palestine, told them the story, and asked them to check in Palestine\nthat she did indeed have a husband and a daughter there, because one never knew how\nhonest these people were. There were many ways by which you could trick somebody,\nand the answer eventually came back that yes, her husband and daughter were there and\nthey confirmed her story. Now, how was I to get her out? She had to come at times when\nvery few people were around. I had to try and do everything so that she wouldn\u2019t be seen,\nand eventually I got her certificate, and how to send her to the airport which was in the\nRussian zone? And the only way to do it was to take her myself, and don\u2019t think I wasn\u2019t\nscared. I\u2019m not so brave, but she sat in the car with me and we handed in her papers, and\nmy propesk, my permit to go into the Russian zone, and we put her on a plane. And there\nwere others. I had a young woman who was working at the Polish consulate, who had a\nbrother in Canada. My goodness, my memory\u2019s going back, and she said she had a visa\nto go to Canada, and again, I was suspicious, and checked her out in the same way. I\nchecked through the consulate and then I checked with the agency, the Jewish agency\nworking in Montreal, and they confirmed her story, and she told the Poles at that time she\nwas going on vacation, and off she went to Canada. It was tricky doing this because you\nwere always suspicious that perhaps these people were not genuine, and that you might\nbe picked up yourself on the street because people were being picked up, particularly by\nthe Russians. People would be walking along and suddenly a car would stop, and like a\ngangster film, people would be whisked off and not seen again. It never happened to any\nof us. I\u2019m just adding drama to the story, I guess.",
        "A: I have no idea.",
        "A: No idea, perhaps they were Russians who\u2019d defected, could be.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t want her to be seen. Maybe I was scared, but I thought the less people who knew\nof her or who saw her, the better. I remember her name. Her name was Hasia Rapaport,\nand I remember it very distinctly.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Well, they couldn\u2019t because they didn\u2019t \u2014 she liked look any other poor person in Vienna.\nShe had dyed red hair, and very \u2014 dressed very ordinarily, and heaven knows where she\ngot her clothes from. She wasn\u2019t in uniform when she came to my office. She was too\nsensible for that, and she had guts actually to come to the office, but her story was true.\nAnd I remember the Polish person, and often when we go to \u2014 out in the evening in\nVienna, we would meet Russian officers who were Jews in the Russian army who were\nnot going to defect. They were Russians, but when you had a husband and a daughter in\nPalestine, of course, you were going to defect if you could.",
        "A: They must have gone when war started, or before war started. I have no idea. I didn\u2019t ask\nher that question, but they probably went \u2014 that\u2019s right, they couldn\u2019t have gone legally.\nThey must have gone the long way around \u2014 the land route as we call it, go through\nSiberia, and then make their way down.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember such a story. I don\u2019t think they would\u2019ve had the guts to come to us\nbecause they didn\u2019t know how we respond, I think. They may have been \u2014 we had\nGermans who tried to pass themselves off as displaced persons, as Jews, in order to get to\nthe United States, and sometimes somebody, let\u2019s say, at Bremen when they\u2019d pass and\nthey had their visa, would recognize them as having been in a concentration camp, had\nbeen one of the workers there, and of course they had to be imprisoned for their own\nsafety, but we discovered very early on that when a German held up his arms, his blood\ngroup number was tattooed under his arm. So, if we were suspicious, we could ask the\ndoctor or somebody to examine him, but I\u2019m sure Germans got through as Jewish\ndisplaced persons and probably lived a life as Jews. People try all kinds of things and get\naway with it.",
        "A: Well, some of the things we did in Austria, we had to use our wits. I think that\u2019s\nessentially the thing. For example, I don\u2019t know if I had told you earlier about the people\nwho had visas for Uruguay?",
        "A: And I knew that their relatives actually were living in Para\u2014I beg your pardon in the\nArgentine. Well, obviously, the Argentine at that time was not giving visas to Jews, and\nso the relatives over there were sensible or smart, they got visas for Paraguay and we\nwould get transit visas for the Argentine that one could get, and when they got to the\nArgentine, they had ways of whisking them off. So, I remember I would sometimes have\nto go up to Prague because that\u2019s where the consulate was, and I remember having a large\nfamily of about 13 people \u2014 Schmuck Lieberman and another name. I don\u2019t remember\nthem now. And I went into the consulate, and they weren\u2019t very ready to give visas\nbecause they consuls made their living, in a way, from the visa fees they charged. You\nknow, they were honorary consuls; they weren\u2019t civil servants. And so I would go in and\nvery brazenly say, \u201cOf course, I know your secretary will have to work extra time, and if\nthere\u2019s anything we could do to compensate for that we would be very happy.\u201d My way\nof offering a bribe, which was gladly accepted, and I would get these visas, and very\ndiscreetly in an envelope leave my payment and walk out. But, you see, people who\nhadn\u2019t been used to having to \u2014 what\u2019s the word? \u2014 find their way, wouldn\u2019t do this kind\nof thing, and I remember the very nice woman who was running the Prague office for the\nAmerican Joint was astounded that I could come to her within one day and show her that\nI had 13 visas. \u201cYou must have paid,\u201d she said. I said, \u201cWho would dream of paying?\u201d\nYou couldn\u2019t even tell your own what you were doing because if they didn\u2019t know\nthemselves how to do it, you could never teach them how.",
        "A: Well, you had to know. I think you knew you had to do something. You had to get these\nvisas. You had to get these people out, and if you couldn\u2019t do it by being honest, since the\nArgentineans weren\u2019t offering visas, you had to do it dishonestly. I didn\u2019t think I was\ndoing anything dishonest because I was helping people to join relatives, and you thought\nof a thousand ways. How did people survive who didn\u2019t land in concentration camp, if\nthey didn\u2019t think of a thousand ruses to survive? And I suppose this is part of it.",
        "A: Not if I could help it.",
        "A: But, when I had to get visas for the Argentine, transit visas, and I knew that the only way\nto get them was for the relatives to get the Paraguayan visas, there was no problem, and if\nI knew, as I did, that the consul was not anxious even to give transit visas to Jews, then\nyou had to get them by other means. I mean, look at the people who landed up in\nShanghai, before and during the war. They had no more intention of staying in Shanghai\nthen you or I would have had, but this was their way of getting out of Germany.",
        "A: I never even thought about what was legal or illegal. I did everything to my knowledge\nlegally, but when I had to help families get to a country that didn\u2019t want them, but I knew\nthey relatives could help them to stay there, and the general community wasn\u2019t against\nthem coming in, why not?",
        "A: Yes, I did. After three years, Dr. Schwartz asked me if I\u2019d like to come on to the\nAmerican Joint\u2019s payroll, and I said I thought that would be nice because by then I mean,\nI was very broke. I had no money, and he offered me a salary at that time. It wasn\u2019t very\nhigh, but it was much more than I\u2019d been getting as a volunteer, and I felt, \u201cWell, three\nyears of voluntary service, I had paid my way.\u201d",
        "A: This was in forty \u2014 toward the end of \u201946, I came on to the JDC payroll.",
        "A: No, I had to. I had no money.",
        "A: No, no, 25.",
        "A: Helping people to-",
        "A: To the United States.",
        "A: No, never. I take it for granted that I could do it. I didn\u2019t even think of it as \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nthink that I took it for granted. This was a job, and this was something I could do. I knew\nthat I had administrative ability. I knew that I knew how to work with people, and \u2014 but I\nnever thought of myself as doing anything special. I was always very pleased, for\nexample, when I could do something like I did for these people going to Paraguay\nostensibly and get their visas, because I helped them. I\u2019ve got pictures at home of them at\nthe railroad station. I took them to the station. We always gave flowers when people left.\nThat was quite European. You always presented people with flowers when they left.",
        "A: No, no, no, this was generally done, and I\u2019ve got, you know, the father with the beard,\nand they would have many kids with them, and I\u2019m sure many of those children were not\ntheir own, but how could you prove it. They had no original documents with them. They\nprobably were children of relatives, and why should I ask questions? We were saving\nyoung lives. It was something one took for granted, one did. During the war, the kinds of\nthings we did in Britain, you never thought of yourself as being anything special. You\njust did it.",
        "A: Some were older. Some were younger.",
        "A: Mixed. Some of the men were older, quite a bit older, but it\u2019s interesting. I never thought\nof age in those days. I never thought that somebody was older or younger. Occasionally,\nyou would find you came into an office like when I came into Vienna, and there was a\nman working there much older than I who was very entrepreneurial, and I didn\u2019t trust him\nany further than I could throw a grand piano, and I knew I had to get rid of him. And it\ntook a little time, but very graciously, we paid him off and got him out because he was\ndishonest. He was taking money from people to get them visas, and that, to me, was\nanathema. So, I won\u2019t tell you his name. I remember it.",
        "A: Oh, in 1948, this was an interesting year. The Americans passed the Displaced Persons\nAct, the first one where displaced persons if they had job and housing assurances, could\nget visas for the United States. It didn\u2019t depend on which country they had lived. In other\nwords, it wasn\u2019t a quota system. And this was fascinating because, one day, I don\u2019t know\nif it was a Friday or a Saturday, we were in the office \u2014 I must say we didn\u2019t know\nwhether it was Monday or Tuesday or Saturday or Sunday when we worked \u2014 Mr. Gruzo\nand Henry Rosenfeld and some others from the Displaced Persons Commission in\nWashington appeared in my office, charming gentleman. They were ready to issue visas\nunder the Displaced Persons Act. Well, I assure you that none of the voluntary agency\npersonnel of all the agencies knew the first thing about what we were supposed to have\nhad, but they were ready to issue visas. And so, I said to them, \u201cUnfortunately, my job\nand housing assurances are at the printers, but if you\u2019d write one out for me. I'll take it\nover to the allianz gebaude,\u201d which was the American building where they had\nmimeograph machines, \u201cIll get some printed out, and you can start work.\u201d And so they\nwere very nice gentlemen. They wrote it down. I took it over, and came back with 50 or\n60, and we took the cases in my office and everyone they thought was eligible, I gave a\njob and housing assurance to, and pumps!, a few days later they were issuing the visas.\nThe next day, or perhaps that evening, I called our Munich office of the American Joint\nand told the man who was director there what we were doing and gave him the wording\nso that when these people arrived in Munich, they would be ready, and quite a number of\npeople got visas. In about ten days, a message came through from the United States from\nthe United Service for New Americans, which was our cooperating agency. They\ncontacted all the communities in the United States where there were relatives and actually\narranged the immigration of relatives to relatives or of people without relatives to people\nwho were offering them jobs and housing. They were very efficient. But they cabled our\nParis office saying, \u201cWhat Amy Zahl is doing is illegal. Tell her to stop immediately.\u201d\nAnd Harold Trobe who was director of the joint operation in Austria called me and said,\n\u201cAmy, I\u2019ve had this cable.\u201d And I said, \u201cHmm, very interesting. We will stop.\u201d And, of\ncourse, what I did, I went into the American Consulate where they were very cooperative,\nlet me put it that way, it was a very nice consul. Sometimes the consuls were not at all\ncooperative. In times when life was a stake before the war, the consuls were not very\ncooperative, but these people were very helpful. I looked through all the Jewish cases I\ncould find whether they were registered with the Joint Distribution Committee or with\nHIAS (ph), or not registered with an agency, and gave them all job and housing\nassurances, and then I stopped. Now, what happened as a result was these people got\nvisas. They were sent up to Bremen, and they were on the ships going to the States in\nlarger numbers than non-Jews sponsored by non-Jewish agencies because they hadn\u2019t had\nthis first encounter with the Displaced Persons Commission, and the press in New York\nwas rather anti-Semitic, you know, \u201conly Jews are getting visas.\u201d You can look up the\npress at the time and see these notices. What we did, of course, was to tell the Christian\nagencies what we had done, told them what the wording was so they could get started,\nbut I think we had more support from our agency than they had from theirs. I know when\nit came to children, for example, I was always horrified both when I was in Austria and\nlater in Germany to find children \u2014 and, when I say children, I mean youngsters under 18\n\u2014 still either in hostels or in camps. Although the American \u2014 I\u2019ve got the name of the\nagency, the refugee agency taking care of orphans \u2014 was working, they were working\nvery slowly, and I just couldn\u2019t bear the thought that there were kids without families still\nsitting in Austria and this is what? 18 months after the war ended. And so, what we\nwould do is take these children and take them away from the other agency, and get them\nvisas to go to the States. It was exciting in that you thought you were helping people, and\nbecause we could work so efficiently, we saw the results in a very short time. When I\nfinished the first batch in Austria, Dr. Schwartz came to me again in the October of 46,\nand said would I go into Germany and take over the operation there? With working very\nsuccessfully in Austria and I had very good assistance working in the Vienna office.\nEverybody was strained. I always worked as though I was leaving tomorrow. It was a\ngood way to work because it meant if I wanted to take time off, the office would\nfunction, the files would be working, and I felt that none of us should try to make\nourselves indispensable. We, after all, were working to save people\u2019s lives. I always felt\nthat. And so, on October the 28\", 1948, I came up into Munich, which was the head\noffice for the German operation, and there was chaos. The staff there were on strike.\nAbout 200 letters a day were coming in from the States because the American operations,\nas I mentioned earlier, were very efficient, and there was nobody working. They were on\nstrike. They wanted better pay. I was horrified. I came into the office and a young\nwoman, an American, Gladys Roth, was running the office at that time, and I wanted her\nto take over the volkcaserna (ph), where people went in order to get processed for\nAmerica. She was a very efficient worker, very sympathetic, spoke excellent Hungarian,\nspoke some German, and was a good worker. She too felt you had to help these people to\nget out \u2014 a wonderful sense of humor, by the way. She was a lifesaver. And I called these\npeople together who were on strike, and I said I would look into their salary claims, but\nnot unless they came back to work because what they were doing was stopping people\nleaving and they themselves were being stopped from leaving. So, this doesn\u2019t make\nsense to me. And I said, \u201cIll expect you all in the office tomorrow morning.\u201d I went to\nthe office in the morning and there was some staff, and the next morning there were a few\nmore, and I let word out that if the rest didn\u2019t come back to work by the end of the week I\nwas going to employ new people. They were all back. There were some troublemakers.\nFor example, the way they had been operating was if people had to go to Paris to pick up\ntransit visas, they would hire coaches on the trains, and two of the boys who worked in\nthe office would go on the train to Paris. Well, you know what this leaves them open to.\nThey could take cigarettes. They could do bribes. I don\u2019t know what they did, but I knew\nthis had to stop, and I let it go on for a little while. You don\u2019t change things immediately,\nand one day I said, \u201cYou know, we have to let these people really go out on their own so\nthat they face the world for the first time. So, let\u2019s try one train without you on it.\u201d Well,\nno, they found a thousand reasons, but I was very firm and the first train went off, and\nwas successful. And then I announced that no more would we have to accompany these\npeople. That was my way of handling that, and then in December, they decided to go on\nstrike again. I was 1n trouble because I didn\u2019t know what I could offer. Sam Haber was\nrunning the operation. He was a tough guy to cope with, and I said I would see them the\nnext day, and talk to them. I came to the office, and there was not a soul 1n sight. And I\nfelt, \u201cI have failed.\u201d I was so horrified, and what could I do, and my office was on the\nthird floor of this building, and I went up to the office and I opened the door and there\nwas a great big shout, \u201cHappy Birthday!\u201d I had forgotten it was my birthday, and they\nwere all up there. I wept. I was so astounded to find them all there, and friends, obviously\nthey were now my friends. I\u2019ve still got the birthday card they made me out of a manila\nfolder, that big and they\u2019d all signed it, and that was wonderful. From then on, we got\nalong very well. The men who had accompanied the people to Paris, I helped to\nimmigrate very quickly. I thought that was the best thing for them. And I tried not to\nemploy people who would have to immigrate now. The Czechs \u2014 you may not know this\nhistorically, you may know it better than I \u2014 had thrown out the volksdeutsch, and there\nwere some lovely young people amongst those who came into Germany who, through no\nfault of their own, were thrown out as revenge, and I employed some of these girls. I\nmade sure they hadn\u2019t been members of the BDM, the Bund Deutscher Mddel, and by the\nway, it was easy to check it because the Germans were so methodical, they had lists. So, I\nemployed these people, but then the rabbis were insulted. I was employing non-Jews\nwhen Jews needed jobs, and I met with them, and I said, \u201cMy job is to get the Jews out of\nhere who don\u2019t belong here, and the only way I can do that is to employ non-Jews who\nare clean and let the others get out.\u201d Some of these girls married Jewish boys. They were\nlovely girls, and they worked very efficiently, but these were some of the hurdles one had\nto cope with. The rabbis were always watching that we did the right thing. For example, I\nhad permission to send what we called \u201chighly pregnant women\u201d, women in their eighth\nmonth, by air to the States because if they couldn\u2019t leave and they had babies, they\ncouldn\u2019t go on these cargo \u2014 not cargo, these military ships and the visa might expire. It\nwas only good for four months. I had an arrangement with Air France. For every ten\npeople I put on a plane, I got one free seat. And so these women would come to me, you\nknow, \u201cI\u2019m in my ninth month.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m in my eighth month.\u201d And I got to the stage when I\ncould look at a woman, and say, \u201cYou\u2019re seven and a half months pregnant. You have\ntime.\u201d It was very funny because we played jokes together. I\u2019m just remembering this.\nWe sent a lot of people by air. Now, some of the ships sailed on a Saturday and the\nOrthodox Jews would not sail on Saturday. Some of the planes went on Friday evening.\nWe made arrangements with the captains of the planes and the captains of the ships. On\nthe planes, the passengers were allowed to embark before the Sabbath came in, therefore\nit was their home. They were allowed to get onto the ship the day before the Sabbath, so\nthat this already was their home, and there was no problem. But, you had to think of all\nkinds of things to stop people from staying behind. Occasionally, you\u2019d have somebody\nwho was having a pair of trousers made, and therefore he couldn\u2019t leave. It wasn\u2019t that he\nwas having trousers made. In a sense, a lot of these people were scared to leave. I think\nthat\u2019s what I thought about them, and so I would call his tailor and if he was having\ntrousers made, I used to tell him, \u201c\u201cYou have to have them by tonight because otherwise\nhe\u2019s going to lose his visa.\u201d The tailors were usually pretty good. They were either\ndisplaced pers- mostly displaced persons or Germans, and they knew what was\nhappening and they would finish the pants, and these people would go on. I only once\nmet a man in New York when I was there who at some kind of gathering, he looked at me\nand said, \u201cZie haben mae swandon heir sukammen.\u201d (ph) He was a German Jew who said\nI forced him to come to America, and his wife said, \u201cIgnore him.\u201d But, he was a man who\nwas having pants made. It was fascinating working with those people. People had all\nkinds of excuses for not going, and I really felt they were scared. After all, some of them\nwere coming to relatives they haven\u2019t seen since before the war or they had never seen. A\nmother\u2019s relative who had come a generation ago. I can understand it. I would be\nhorrified to have to go to a relative who was going to support me who I didn\u2019t know, or\nmy mother had told me stories they didn\u2019t like. It was fascinating, fascinating, but you\nhad to get \u2014 firstly, you had to get these people out of Germany. They were not wanted in\nGermany. There was no future for them in Germany. And secondly, one knew that once\nthey got to the States, they could begin to rebuild for themselves and the new children\nthey had. It was fortunate that so many of them did have children because this gave them\na future. They were concerned for their children, and that was one of the reasons for\nleaving. We also had situations where non-Jews had helped Jews in hiding, and I\nremember Andre Bulova\u2019s sister, Bulova watch company, his sister was a Mrs. Godem\n(ph) came to see me, and for some reason, she liked me. She said, \u201cDo you have people\nyou would like to help and you can\u2019t.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, P\u2019ve got heads of families who are\nnon-Jews.\u201d And we essentially helped families where the head of the family was a Jew\nbecause they would fit into a new community. She said, \u201cI will give you affidavits worth\na million dollars each, and you send them to my brother and we will find jobs for them.\u201d\nAnd there was one man who had hidden his wife through the war, and he did beautiful\nwork, enamel on silver, and he brought in several \u2014 I shall never forget this \u2014 several\nsmall dishes in a way to show me of work he did. It was all very beautiful, and when I\ntold Mrs. Godem, because she would come back and forth, she said, \u201c\u201cHe can do watch\ncovers. My brother would be very pleased to see him.\u201d And this man said to me, \u201cWhich\none do you like the best?\u201d Well, I knew he was saying to me, \u201cI will give you that one.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cThey\u2019re all beautiful.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t admire any, and the only gift I ever have or had\nfrom a survivor or from a refugee was a dish he sent to me. He knew I wouldn\u2019t take it.\nWe allowed them to bring flowers to the office, and sometimes it looked like a mortuary,\nthere were so many flowers, but gifts were forbidden because gifts lead to bribes. But I\nhave at home still this lovely tray he gave me. It\u2019s a dish about six inches in diameter, St.\nGeorge and the Dragon. I think he must have made it for me. And, they did very well in\nthe States. We had some wonderful people, we really did, who immigrated to the States,\nand America is richer for them. It really is. The operation in Germany went quite\nsuccessfully, I would say, because we got all the offices to work in the same fashion. We\nset up some of the filing systems. When we had people from Austria who came into\nGermany, we had the same system for handing them. There was one case of a young man\nwho I sent ostensibly to the States via Germany. His name was Miklaus Rezmowitz. He\nwas Hungarian. I had found him on the streets in Vienna, and what I did, I got the Joint\noffice to set up a small hostel for me where if I put kids there, they had a whole sheet to\nthemselves on the bed, and I tried to find them jobs, and I tried to get them out of the\ncountry as soon as possible. And I sent Mickey through Germany to the States. When I\ncame to Germany 18 months later, somebody told me \u2014 because there always was a\ngrapevine \u2014 that Mickey was working in a garage in Munich and I was horrified. This\nsweet little boy, to me he was a baby. And I got him to come to my office and he told me\nwhen he got to Munich, for some reason something happened and the visa wasn\u2019t picked\nup and nobody helped him, and he didn\u2019t want to write and tell me because I\u2019d been so\nkind to him, and so he let his visa lapse. Well, I started immediately to work on his visa,\nand discovered he had a brother in Sweden. I may have mentioned to you that even to this\nday, people are finding relatives. His brother had escaped to Sweden and was there, and I\ndecided when I eventually got Mickey\u2019s visa, I would bring the brother in from Sweden.\nEventually, we got a visa for Mickey, and I got his brother to come and we put him up in\nour apartment \u2014 I was sharing an apartment with three, two other girls, and the next\nmorning we brought the brother to the office \u2014 I\u2019ve got pictures of him \u2014 and where was\nMickey? He was no where to be found. He was out philandering somewhere, and when I\nbrought him to the office, and he met his brother for the first time since they were both\ntaken away, you can imagine the scene. It was wonderful. I then met Mickey again in\nNew York, and he told me he was so appreciative of what America did for him, he was\njoining the army. It was the Korean war, and I\u2019ve never heard from him since. So, I\u2019m\ngoing to the museum in Washington tomorrow to see if I, hopefully, don\u2019t find him on\nthe list that I should look at. But there were some wonderful stories. As I say, ve got\npictures of these two brothers in my office. There were some wonderful stories, and the\nolder men I employed in the office, some of them had come back from Shanghai, took\ncare of these youngsters for me, and behaved like fathers, you know, made sure they were\nin on time. It just was a very nice atmosphere in that place and made it easy to work.",
        "A: A much, much bigger. Most of the displaced persons in Germany were in the American\nzone of Germany. It was a much bigger operation. I can tell you some interesting stories\nof things that happened because people think the camps were liberated and suddenly\nthere were no more camps, but there were the displaced persons camps, and let\u2019s say\npeople wanted to get to Canada, but how? They were ineligible for the United States\nbecause they didn\u2019t fit in with the criterion which was necessary to immigrate to the\nUnited States, and Canada would be offering a scheme to bring in tailors, or furriers.\nWell, the ORT organization was wonderful in Germany. We got doctors and lawyers to\ntrain as furriers. They could operate the same machines and they passed the exam, and\ncame to Canada, and they worked as doctors and as lawyers. They took their exams\nagain, and they were of benefit to Canada. Canada was foolish in many instances because\nthey were looking for brawn. They weren\u2019t looking for brain. America was much more\naware of what was available because of the kinds of refugees they had taken in at the\nbeginning or before the war, and so America got all kinds, but Canada took a long time to\nwake up. But what we would do again \u2014 we wanted it to help these people get out and if\nall they were taken was furriers, well you train these people as furriers, and they came to\nCanada. I don\u2019t think the consuls knew. I\u2019m sure that the people in Canada knew what we\nwere doing, but you know, you\u2019d get out 25 families at a time. It was wonderful.",
        "A: Okay, good question. If we heard, because we all were constantly being fed information\nthat the Canadian government was looking for 50 furriers. We would pass word to the\nrepresentative of the Joint in the camp that the Canadians were looking for 50 furriers. He\nknew through discussion with us that what these people had to be able to show the\nrepresentatives of the government was that they knew how to operate the sewing machine\nthat took fur, that they knew how to cut fur, or they knew how to stitch, and by golly, the\nORT representative in the camp really showed them how. They trained very quickly, and\nwhen they came for the exams, they passed perfectly.",
        "A: They volunteered.",
        "A: If a doctor was hoping that he could go somewhere and work as a doctor, but saw that it\nwas useless, he\u2019d go anywhere because he knew once he got to that new country, he\ncould take exams again and work in his profession. People were not afraid to do the\ndirtiest menial work in order to get out of Germany, number one, and secondly, they\nwanted to set up a new life and start life again. So, they were very ready to do anything\nthat they could do to get out.",
        "A: In the Jewish camps, and it was mainly ORT, I don\u2019t know of another organization that\nwas working. ORT trained people in mechanics. They trained \u2014 they still work today, by\nthe way. That organization was started in Russia, I think, after the First World War. It\u2019s\nan extraordinary organization. It still works around the world. It was the ORT which had\nmany, many training centers set up. They had good people. Very often they were\ndisplaced persons who were experts in their field training other displaced persons. They\nwere very well organized and they did a beautiful job.",
        "A: People who were in displaced persons camps, there were very few who were teenagers.",
        "A: They may have. Yes, they may have been in their twenties. They certainly had lost\nschooling. They didn\u2019t have formal education. There weren\u2019t too many individual young\npeople. There weren\u2019t too many families with children who were in their twenties.\nFamilies were decimated, you have to remember, totally decimated, and if there \u2014 excuse\nme \u2014 if there were young people, they were individuals, and you\u2019re quite right, they had\nlost their schooling. They had no training. Firstly, they hadn\u2019t been to college. They\nhadn\u2019t gone to technical school, and they had no training in occupations. ORT was a\nGodsend. ORT was a Godsend to them.",
        "A: Well, first thing, we had social workers in the camps. Secondly, this gentleman wasn\u2019t\naware, perhaps, that these young women had lost their mothers who normally would\u2019 ve\nhelped them through this period, and there were no older women around who\u2019d had\nbabies. They had been killed off. But they soon learned. These women had mother\u2019s\ninstinct. They were so thrilled to have babies, to start again. The men who were their\nhusbands, because there was no license there, there weren\u2019t women who weren\u2019t married\nhaving babies. These were young women who were married and having children, starting\na life again, starting a family again. They were very careful. I think they all cared. Some\nof them probably were better than others, but even in our society, we have women who\nare better than others in rearing children. But it was wonderful for us when they first\nstarted to get pregnant, because while they were incarcerated or in hiding, most women\ndidn\u2019t even menstruate. They only started to menstruate again when they were free. It\u2019s\nan interesting phenomenon how nature takes care of itself.",
        "A: Yes, I think it must have been more than a year, even up to two years.",
        "A: Yes. It was more than a year because I remember being in the camps in Germany when\nthere was much rejoicing and we had to order from the States these sanitary napkins for\nthe women and condoms, by the way, because women were getting pregnant.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Where would the condoms come from? They were ordered, which was rather nice. You\nknow, you \u2014 I had never thought of that. Who ever thinks of that kind of thing? You\nknow, a single girl brought up properly, but it was wonderful that they were even\nthinking about planning their families.",
        "A: I would assume so. They didn\u2019t ask of me, and I didn\u2019t officially know of this. I knew\nfrom the other people working in the camps that this was happening.",
        "A: Yeah, if they had one baby, they didn\u2019t want another baby immediately. After all, they\nwere no grandparents who were going to rejoice in these children. There were no families\nthat were going to help them bring up these children. They were going into a new world\nall on their own, and a lot of these people in the camps wanted to go to the United States.\nThey did not want to go to Palestine. I\u2019m talking before the State of Israel. They very\ndefinitely wanted to go to the United States because a large percentage of them had\nfamily in the States, a large percentage, and I think they wanted to get away as far as they\ncould from the Russians and away from Europe and the Middle East. That was another\nfactor. And America still held out the dream for a lot of these people.",
        "A: There was a lot of tension. There was a lot of tension between the non-Zionists and the\nZionists. Some people were almost forced to go to Palestine. I know I would give people\nletters to say they were registered with me for the United States so that they could not be\nforced onto a transport to Palestine. Remember also, at this time, there was a lot of illegal\nimmigration into Palestine and these people didn\u2019t want to go. They\u2019d suffered enough\nfrom their point of view. They had not been Zionists because if their parents had been\nZionists, they would have left Poland before the war and gone to Palestine. When one\nthinks of it, very few Jews really were going to Palestine from Poland, where there was\ntremendous poverty, tremendous anti-Semitism, long before the Hitler regime, and they\ndidn\u2019t go. It was a very difficult time for a lot of people, but it was a political situation\nand they were pushing these people to go. I was never in favor of it, I must say.",
        "A: He came. Yes, he came up into the British zone. I didn\u2019t see him, but I remember that he\ncame and in certain camps where, for example, Yosele Rosensaft was heading the camp\nat Belsen. Yosele who was getting everybody to go to Palestine except he. He came to the\nUnited States with his wife. Ben-Gurion was up there. What Ben-Gurion did arrange was\nthat some of the children who had survived who the Zionists and Belsen would not allow\nto come to England, Martin Gilbert has written a book about the boys, well these were\nsome of the boys who might have been. They were not allowing these kids to come but,\nBen-Gurion spoke to Yosele and some others in the camp, and we did get a transport out\nof Belsen of youngsters to England, and these kids had sat there for so long, they were so\nill so many of them because they wanted the men to go to Israel because they didn\u2019t like\ngoing to Spevan (ph), and they didn\u2019t like the British Government policy and so the kids\nsuffered. They were used as political pawns. But Ben-Gurion, I must say, helped to ease\nthat situation.",
        "A: It resumes normally, politically among Jews who are Zionists and Jews who are not\nZionists. It resumes as it was before the war. People don\u2019t change, situations change.",
        "A: Yes, there were courses, and there were other courses run for people who were\ncoming to the States or to English-speaking countries and numbers of refugees took\nadvantage of that. Once they knew they were going to get a visa, they were very good\nabout learning to speak the language.",
        "A: Well, there were people who were depressed. There were people who were depressed,\nvery understandably, when you found you had a young man who had seen his parents and\nbrothers taken off and some policeman or another had pushed him to the side because\nthey had known each other on the street, and saved him and he found our none of his\nfamily had survived. A tremendous guilt feeling of being alive, and how do you help\npeople to get over that. Some people never did or never have. I know people who\nsurvived who have never gotten over the fact that they are the sole survivors of their\nfamily. Sometimes they\u2019ll find a person who lived in the same town who went through a\nsimilar experience, and they are as close as brother and sister or brothers because they\nshared similar experience. People are still suffering, and that\u2019s why I think, for many,\nmany years, most of the people who survived the war were not able to tell their children\nof their experiences. People say, \u201cWell, why is it only now this is coming to light?\u201d It\u2019s\nbeen very hard to talk about it, very hard.",
        "A: Now, because time has passed and the children are asking the right question. The children\nare adult enough to be kind to their parents in the sense that they will ask the question\nkindly. The grandchildren ask the questions, and they\u2019re gradually loosening up as well.\nSome people have been for counseling. Some didn\u2019t need the counseling. Some needed to\ntell the story in order to ease their own souls, their own conscience. People felt very\nguilty about remaining alive.",
        "A: Well, I would think that we helped about 40,000 to get to the United States, and when\nyou think that each one was an individual visa, nothing was en masse. We worked seven\ndays a week, all the hours that were given us, and we never thought of it at that time. I\nused to skip out sometimes on a Sunday and go fishing, in fact. I love trout fishing, and\nonce I got caught fishing in illegal waters.",
        "A: No, but a bottle of scotch handled that quite nicely. We used to be able to buy scotch at\nseven and sixpence a bottle, which was just over a dollar.",
        "A: No, no, when we caught them, we threw them back. That wasn\u2019t cricket. You didn\u2019t keep\nthe trout. You just caught it and threw it back. I didn\u2019t fish to have fish to eat.",
        "A: Sometimes we did. No, I\u2019m telling the truth completely. Sometimes we did, but that\u2019s\nright \u2014 the guy who drove us out \u2014 his mother used to clean them for us, because he used\nto fish also. But I didn\u2019t realize, actually, that we were fishing in illegal waters. This man\nwho was one of our drivers took us there, and he said, \u201cThis is where you can fish.\u201d So,\nwe fished until a policeman came up. And I was horrified. You know, really, I\u2019m the\ndirector of immigration of the American Joint Distribution Committee. I was petrified\nalso that I might be jailed, but my friend, Gladys Roth, had a way. She was very good.\nShe was a marvelous worker. Unfortunately, she died a few years ago. She would have\nhad wonderful stories to tell. She did a tremendous job and helped a tremendous number\nof people. We had some very fine people working with us. There was another woman\nwho came up from South Africa, another volunteer. South Africa also had volunteers. A\nwoman called Hannah Kisch who worked in my office in Munich who did a beautiful\njob. She was from Latvia and spoke beautiful Yiddish, and people loved her. She did a\nvery good job, and despite the fact that she was rather an emotional woman, was able to\nforget this, and when she had to bawl somebody out because they\u2019d done something that\nwasn\u2019t good, she could do it in the kind of Yiddish that they understood. She was a lovely\nwoman. We did have some wonderful women working with us, and some men, but\nmostly they were women. They did a tremendous job.",
        "A: Oh, yes, I didn\u2019t \u2014 never went into the Russian zone, and I never went into Berlin because\nI was told my name was on a list, and I didn\u2019t know whether this was true or not. After\nall, I had helped Russians to immigrate, and I was playing safe. Also, I was scared, and so\nI never went into the Russian zone in Germany or never went into Berlin. To this day,\nI\u2019ve not been to Berlin. I hope to go soon. I\u2019m hoping to find papers of the\nReichsfertreitung, the Jewish community organization, when I get there because none\nsome to have survived, and they did a fantastic job, but-",
        "A: Oh, yes, constantly up and down, up and down.",
        "A: Oh, yes, and then I would take a group of people, let\u2019s say down to Genoa to get on a\nship, and I would escort them to the border. The police were wonderful at the Brenna (ph)\nPass. The Italians got to know me, and they would tell me, \u201cThe train\u2019s going to be a half\nhour, three-quarters of an hour late. Why don\u2019t you go to bed, and when we know the\ntrain\u2019s coming, we\u2019ll wake you?\u201d And, so I\u2019d go to the hotel, sometimes the train was an\nhour late, and somehow I'd hear the police shouting up at me or banging on the door, and\nI\u2019d get up. I had all the passports for these people, couldn\u2019t give passports out, and I\nwould accompany them down to Genoa, and the catabaneri (ph) in Genoa were very\ngood. They\u2019d invite me down to the docks, make sure that I had somebody with me, and\ntake me to the hotel and make sure that I had my room with a side doors locked, because\nmany hotels had rooms adjoining with doors that were unlocked. They always made sure\nthat the doors were locked before they would allow me into the hotels. They were very\nnice people. I was in Genoa maybe every three or four weeks. There was a wonderful\nwoman working for the Joint there called Elia Eliaskovitch her name was. She had come\nto Italy to study Anthropology before the war, got stuck there, and the catabaneri gave\nher a certificate to say that she was a Catholic. She survived all through the war, Elka\nEliaskovitch. I lost touch with her, but she knew every consul in Genoa, and she would\njust take me. We would get the visas that we needed and then she would take me down to\nthe shipping agents because shipping was very difficult to get, and she would always\nmanage to get shipping. She was a wonderful woman. She landed up I think in California,\nbut I never heard from her after she left. We did have some wonderful characters working\nin this total program.",
        "A: No, no, what I did was I was getting the visas for all these people. So, I needed all the\npassports together, and I couldn\u2019t give them back to the people because I wanted them all\ntogether and to go. They only got their passports when they were getting on the ship.",
        "A: Is this making sense? Yeah?\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: Well, it was very different from the Truman Directive. That gave the first ray of hope to\npeople that they might get to the United States, but when they passed the DP Act, this\nwas the first time, really, that people could come to the United States outside of a quota\nnumber and on the basis of a job and housing assurance which somebody perhaps they\ndidn\u2019t know had given them. Whereas, before affidavits were generally given by close\nrelatives who undertook, of course, to ensure that they would not be come a charge on\npublic funds. This was a totally different concept, and the Truman government at the time\nreally is to be congratulated in having shown a humanitarian aspect of US immigration\nlaw which until then had really kept people out.",
        "A: It made a tremendous difference because we could offer hope to many more people that\nthey could get to the United States. They didn\u2019t have to have visas \u2014 I beg your pardon \u2014\nthey didn\u2019t have to have affidavits from relatives. Many of them didn\u2019t have relatives\nwho wanted to go to the States. This also was important. It meant that people were given\na choice to an extent and how often had these people been given a choice after the war?\nThey came out of the camps or if they were Polish Jews who had fled into Russia and\nworked in the mines, and had gone back to the Poland, what choices had they had? It\nmight interest you, by the way, to know that among the people we took care of, the first\ncomplete Jewish families I found after the war were the Polish Jews who had fled to\nRussia when the Germans marched in. And, although they\u2019d suffered tremendous\nhardship, we had husbands and wives and children together. It was very interesting to see\nthis. As I said, they had \u2014 many of them had suffered. They\u2019d worked in the mines, and\nwhen do Jews work in mines, after all? They were tradesmen or employees, but they did\nsurvive as families.",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t \u2014 people weren\u2019t even aware. People were concerned for themselves. You\nhave to try and imagine what it was like to be in Germany after the war when either you\nwere a survivor of a camp \u2014 and there weren\u2019t too many remember \u2014 you were somebody\nwho had been encouraged to leave Poland, firstly because the Poles were still anti-\nSemitic. There had been pogroms in 1946 in Kielce, when Jews were killed again. You\nwere encouraged to leave because you hoped for a better life somewhere else. You didn\u2019t\nwant to be among the people you had been with, and everybody in a sense was concerned\nfor himself or herself. And you have to imagine also in these camps there was a total lack\nof privacy for people. They were sleeping in nissen (ph) huts. There was curtain in\nbetween families to give them some sort of privacy, but very little because it didn\u2019t stop\nvoices carrying. It was a very difficult time for these people, and our feeling generally\nwas the sooner we got them out of these \u2014 these people out of these conditions, the better.\nIt was a very, very tough time for these people. And although visitors who came to\nGermany \u2014 and there were many \u2014 and saw these people and they would talk very\nbravely, they didn\u2019t see how these people were living, what kind of latrine facilities there\nwere, what kind of washing facilities there were. There were no, obviously, there were no\nwashing machines, but what kind of laundry facilities there were, what kind of facilities\nthere were for the Orthodox Jews. It was an extraordinary difficult period, and these\npeople survived it. These are the people who were the survivors. They were amazing\npeople, and if there were occasionally arguments or quarrels, why not? I mean, this too\nwas normal.",
        "A: Oh, yes, they saw the conditions. I\u2019m thinking of people who visited who were interested,\nlet\u2019s say, in raising money in the United States, and they came through and they saw the\ncamp. They may have even spent as much as a half a day, but you can\u2019t get a feel of a\nplace from that kind of experience.",
        "A: No, he came through, I think, before I came into Germany. I\u2019m trying to think of which\nyear it was. Was it \u201949 that he came through?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t meet him.",
        "A: He was an interesting character. Again, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, who was the European\nDirector of the JDC, came to me and told me really a fantastic story of a man whom a\nwhole group of survivors in Paris had just given a banquet. Who was this man? His name\nwas Oscar Schindler, and I really knew nothing about him at that time. And Dr. Schwartz\ntold me that Oscar Schindler had saved the lives of at least 1,200 Jews by having them\nwork in his factory in Poland, and Oscar Schindler had come back to Germany, had gone\nto Frankfurt. I think he had tried to set up a concrete factory, and was not successful. It\u2019s\ninteresting, this fantastic character didn\u2019t do very well. The Joint was helping to support\nhim at this time because they were so astounded by his efforts to save people who\nessentially were not of his own kind. They were Jews; he was a Catholic. He was a\nmember of the Nazi party, as most Germans were. And the fact that he had helped these\npeople, they were ready to do anything they could to help him. So, Dr. Schwartz said to\nme, \u201cAmy, you know the ropes. He will come to you. Perhaps he won\u2019t even come alone.\nHe may come with other people. I want you to try and send him wherever he wants to\ngo.\u201d Well, Oscar Schindler appeared in my office one day with his wife and two young\nJewish couples, and I sort of couldn\u2019t get the hang of what the relationship was, and they\nexplained to me in Yiddish that they always protected him because he looked like any\nother German Nazi. He had blue eyes and blonde hair, and was very fair, obviously, and\nthey were afraid if he came to my office, which was in the Jewish quarter of Munich, he\nmight be set upon. There were a lot of belligerent Jews at that time. Oscar, as I said,\ncame, and explained to me that what he really wanted to do was to set up a mink farm.\nNow, what he knew about mink farming, I had no idea, but 1t wasn\u2019t mine to question.\nAnd the place he wanted to do it was in the Argentine. The Argentine, I knew the\nArgentine consuls. I could get a visa for Oscar and his wife, no problem. They were\nCatholics. But, he said also, he would not go unless the two couples with him also got\nvisas because they were like family to him, and they felt he was family to them. He\u2019d\nsaved their lives, and they were never going to forget this. Well, I set about trying to get\nthe visas. As I say, it was not too difficult for Oscar and his wife. How to get visas for the\ntwo couples with him \u2014 on the application form for a Argentine visa, they asked religion.\nThey did on many applications at that time, asked the religion of the applicant, but it\ndidn\u2019t say explain anything. It didn\u2019t say, for example, if somebody was Orthodox, were\nthey Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Jewish Orthodox, \u201cA ha!\u201d I thought. I put\nOrthodox, and it was no problem. I got the visas, and eventually they went to the States.\nI\u2019m sorry, they went to the Argentine, but they were lovely people, all of them. Oscar was\nvery soft voiced, very pleasant. Who could imagine that this man \u2014 he was diminutive, he\nwasn\u2019t very tall \u2014 had the courage to do the kinds of things he did? I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve\nseen the film \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u2019, but a lot of that \u2014 the story in that film \u2014 is true. He was\nan extraordinary man to deal with, and in retrospect, quite a privilege to have met him. It\nwas interesting that we were so busy trying to help people that it never occurred to me\nthat here was somebody who was very, very special.",
        "A: Yes, she didn\u2019t do much talking, but she also was very nice. She\u2019s still alive, you know,\nliving in the Argentine. She was very pleasant, too.",
        "A: No, you didn\u2019t talk to people. I think, firstly, he might have been embarrassed, but that\nisn\u2019t why he came to see me. Firstly, it would not have occurred to me, except to tell him\nwhat a wonderful human being he was, but you know, we really had no concept at that\ntime \u2014 this is 1949 \u2014 of the kinds of things that he had done to save so many people. I\nmean, he got people out of Auschwitz. Who ever got anybody out of Auschwitz? He was\nquite an extraordinary man.",
        "A: Yes, to an extent. I think there\u2019s one part of the film where he goes into the basement to\nget wine, I think, it is Gert\u2019s basement and the young lady who works for him, a Jewish\nprisoner, who Gert is very nasty to, is down there and Oscar, if you remember the film,\nleans towards her and she thinks he\u2019s going to kiss her. And he pats her on the shoulder.\nHe said, \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t going to kiss you. I was going to kiss you actually only on the\nforehead, but to tell you you will be all right. I will take care of you.\u201d Now, when you\nthink of this man, he could\u2019ve abused this girl. He could\u2019ve abused any of the Jewish\nwomen in his care. He could\u2019ve raped them if he had to. He could\u2019ve done anything with\nthem because they owed their lives to him. He didn\u2019t touch one of them. Although in the\nfilm, he is shown as being a womanizer, it helps to sell a film. Let\u2019s face it, and he may\nhave been a womanizer, but the important thing about Oscar Schindler is he didn\u2019t touch\none of the prisoners. I think this tells you essentially the character of this man.",
        "A: I think it took me about five or six weeks. There are all kinds of documents you have to\nfill in. You have to get passports. I had to get passports, take those passports for the\npeople who were going with him. They were Polish Jews, and they weren\u2019t going as\nPolish citizens. It was all rather complicated, and yet in a sense it was very normal for us\nto be doing the kind of thing we were doing. So, he came to the office on several\noccasions, and was always very pleasant, an extraordinary man.",
        "A: There were some very wonderful survivors, but each story is a different story. The fact\nthat they were survivors, and remained decent human beings and people with a sense of\nhumor, and people with kindness, there are many stories of many kind people, and there\nwere people who survived who weren\u2019t kind people. I think people went into the camps \u2014\nrather, people who went into the camps as kind, decent human beings came out as such,\nand those who were gas/lonim, gangsters, when they went in, were gangsters when they\ncame out. People don\u2019t change. Their behavior changes, I think. There was some very\nwonderful people who survived, and very wonderful people, unfortunately, who didn\u2019t.",
        "A: I stayed in Germany until the Displaced Persons Act came to an end, and then I felt it was\ntime for me to go on. The American Joint wanted me to go down to Morocco where they\nhad a program, but I thought it was about time I started to sample normal life. You have\nto remember that, since I was a teenager, I\u2019d been working with displaced persons living\nan expatriate life, an exotic life in a way, but I felt that my biggest job had been done. I\u2019d\nhelped as many people as I could to immigrate to countries outside of Israel. We didn\u2019t\nhandle Israel. And it was about time I set myself up. And, so, I waited until the Act came\nto an end in May of \u201945, and then decided I would go to the United States and see where\nsome of these Americans with whom I\u2019d work came from.",
        "A: Oh, no, no.",
        "A: Oh, I had been back. If I got a weekend, while my mother was alive, I would pop over to\nsee her as often as I could, which was perhaps every four months, six months. I\u2019d take a\nlong week. You know, it was a train overnight there, and spend a day with her, and come\nback. Maybe it was longer periods in between, but I did go and see her. My mother died\nin 1952, and I had been in London about three months before, and we had gone to the\nballet, and had a lovely evening, and that was my last memory of her.",
        "A: Yes, I liked her tremendously. She was a very kind woman, a very kind woman.",
        "A: Oh, I think she would have loved to have had me in London, but she was very proud of\nthe fact that, 1n a sense, I was giving service, 1s the way that she would put it, that I was\nhelping other people. I think if she had been younger, she might have done it herself.",
        "A: She was in her late 60s.",
        "A: No, no. She\u2019d been sick.",
        "A: Well, I couldn\u2019t see myself in England having worked with the Americans for so long. I\nneeded a break, I felt. I had no home in England, anyway, and I thought I would come to\nthe States. I had friends in the States, Gladys Roth, with whom I had worked invited me\nalso to come and stay with her while she was on leave, and so I thought that was a good\nidea. And, when I came to the States I was invited by William Rosenwald, the son of\nJulius \u2014 was it Julius Rosenwald. Or was that his brother who started Sears Roebuck? \u2014\nwho had met me in Germany, asked me if I\u2019d come and run his philanthropies for him,\nand I thought I would try that. And I was working for him for about a year when the\nAmerican Joint again approached me and said they had a problem down in Brazil where\nthe last people who had been displaced persons camps, a lot of whom had been sent down\nthere and they were having a problem. Would I go down to Brazil and sort the situation\nout? Foolishly, I said yes. The Brazilian community that I dealt with, largely was the\nrefugee community. There were about 20,000 former refugees living in San Paulo, most\nof them very, very fine people. The people who had been sent in when the displaced\npersons camps were closing were difficult people, let me put it that way. Some of them\nwere mentally ill. Some of them should never have been sent. Some of them had no\ndesire to be there. It was a very, very difficult situation. I was physically attacked down\nthere for a change. I hadn\u2019t been physically attacked since I\u2019d been 1n Greece, and it was\nbroadcast, by the way, over the radio and some friends, including Norman Bentwich,\nProfessor Bentwich, heard in London, called my aunt, and I got frantic phone calls from\nLondon. I got another dislocation from that.",
        "A: Physically.",
        "A: Well, they tried, yes, and you know, I\u2019m rather small. I\u2019m only five foot four, and these\nguys were big guys, and I\u2019m not a fighter, physically or mentally, I think, but after that I\nworked under police protection. And I used to come back to the hotel in which I lived\nunder police protection, and one of the very nice Swedish boys at the desk asked me,\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Because apparently the only other women who came back to the hotel under\npolice protection where the prostitutes.",
        "A: Yes. No, I had to explain to him that I\u2019d been attacked, you know. But, the community\nthat was established there, there was a Dr. Lorch, L-o-r-c-h, from Germany, his wife\nwho\u2019s actually Brazilian Jewish \u2014 she was a Klabin, of the Klabin family. The parents\nhad come to Brazil at the turn of the century from Lithuania, and they were a very, very\nwealthy family, and very concerned for refugees. They had worked on the refugees\ncommittee before the war, and they helped after the war. They were very kind to me, and\nthere were several other families who did a beautiful job down there, but these people\nwere people they hadn\u2019t met before. I hadn\u2019t met this kind before, actually. I set up a\nsmall loans committee to try and help them. Their visas weren\u2019t regular visas, you know,\nit\u2019s coming back to the old story, and I had to legalize them, and the Brazilian\ngovernment really didn\u2019t want to legalize them except for Jeiko (ph). Yes, and it was\nvery difficult. Eventually, the government settled. I must say, and I'll confess now that\none or two who were Germans who didn\u2019t know what they were letting themselves in for\nI sent back to Germany. One or two of them, I managed to get into Canada. And we set\nup a small loans committee so that a lot of these men could become hawkers. They\nbought goods on credit, and went to outlying villages just as the original Strausses did in\nthe United States. Some of them became very wealthy, and they calmed down. Some of\nthem were pretty awful people, and as with all groups, there was lovely people among\nthem. It was a very tough job. I stayed in Brazil for nine months. It was a tough\nassignment, a very tough assignment. When I came back to New York, and the British\nasked me \u2014 called me and said would I come to England? Because the British\ngovernment was now allowing what they called hardcore cases to come into England.\nHardcore cases for the British were families where the head of the family could not\nmaintain his family either because of physical illness or even that they might be mentally\ndisturbed, and so I went to England, and went into Austria, Germany, and Italy again to\nchoose hardcore cases to come to England. They were interesting, some of these people. I\nhad one young man who had been shot through the shoulder and had no profession. We\nbrought him to England. He was supposed to have had TB and be cured, but when we\ngot him to England, we discovered he still had TB, and the British were not really taking\nin TB cases. They had enough illnesses of their own, and so eventually, I took this man\nwho behaved as though he were mentally ill while he was England, eventually I took him\nback to Germany. We flew, and it was quite surprising. As we got off the plane, you\nnever would have known that he had behavior other than normal behavior. When they x-\nrayed him, he showed no signs of TB. I\u2019m sure they thought the British were trying to get\nrid of him. He was quite an extraordinary case. I think he couldn\u2019t face being outside the\nterritory in which he was captured. He was one of the strange cases. Others were families\nwith several sons and daughters. Some of them Orthodox Jews who made a very good\nadjustment to living in England. We moved them into areas where there were Orthodox\nJews. The Jewish Refugees Committee did a very good job on those people, and I\nremember another young \u2014 not a young couple, but a young man with older parents who\nthe British brought in, and had him trained as a surveyor. He had no college education,\nbut like many people in England, you could go into a profession and train on the job, and\nhe did very well and his parents adjusted very well. Those families on the whole, except\nfor this young man, who was very sad, were a success. And then, of course, I came back\nto the States. I became, I suppose, a cosmopolitan in a way in that I felt at home nowhere.\nI\u2019d worked for so long with displaced persons, in a sense, it was the only thing I knew.\nBut after coming to the States, one of my friends convinced me I ought to work with the\nNational Council of Jewish Women, their headquarters in New York. And I went to see\nthem, and I must say they were very anxious to get me. I don\u2019t know why, perhaps my\nexperience meant something to them. And I did work for them for \u2014 I\u2019m trying to think\nhow long \u2014 several years, until the wanderlust got me again, and I decided together with a\nfriend who was a published author that we\u2019d go off to China and see what the role of\nwomen was in the new China. I didn\u2019t realize we wouldn\u2019t get visas, but I gave up my\njob. My friend got an advance on a book about China. She was already, as I say, a\npublished author, and we landed in Tokyo \u2014 or rather, I landed in Tokyo. She was coming\nlater by ship. I flew in. And the first night that I was in the Frank Lloyd Wright Imperial\nHotel, it was a very interesting building. Everything was much too big for me. Everything\nwas high, and the first night I was there, I met charming gentleman in the smorgasbord\nrestaurant who eventually became my husband. We got married in London because my\nfamily couldn\u2019t think that somebody hat at last got me to say yes, and I ended up on the\nprairie in Illinois, on the flat, flat prairie, which I found devastating, absolutely\ndevastating. Nobody knew me. Nobody knew of the work that I had done. Nobody was\ninterested, and I decided, \u201cWell, if I\u2019m going to be stuck here\u201d because David was a\nlovely, lovely man, \u201cI\u2019m going to do something. I\u2019Il go back to school,\u201d which I had tried\nto do before I left England. I had gone to university in the evening, but of course couldn\u2019t\ncontinue because of the Blitz and things like that, and then I went overseas. I said to\nmyself, \u201cPll get my degree here.\u201d And in the time it normally takes a student not having\nbeen in school for a thousand years, I maintain a straight average \u2014 a straight-A average \u2014\ngot my undergraduate degree, got a Master\u2019s degree, and then decided I would do what I\nalways want to do and that was to get a PhD at the London School of Economics, and\nDavid thought that was a splendid idea. He was very kind, and I came to London again.\nThe semester was ten weeks. We had three semesters a year, and I had to be there for two\nyears. I managed to skip one while we went on sabbatical to Australia, which is another\nstory, meeting people I\u2019d sent there as refugees, and came back to the States, finished my\ndissertation, and in 1975, received my PhD from the London School of Economics. And\nthen I decided what one really had to do was to tell this story of what happened during\nand after the war because, as I say, nobody ever asked. Nobody seemed to be interested.\nThere was one professor at University of Illinois. His name was Winton Solberg. He was\nan intellectual history, and he asked me to write a course on the Holocaust. I thought this\nwas going to be a great opportunity. I wrote the course, but I was a woman, and the\nhistory department wasn\u2019t about to make funding available for me to teach the course.\nBut, women\u2019s movement was beginning to get going, and Joan Huber, who was head of\nthe department of sociology, said to me, \u201cAmy, you can teach that course in our\ndepartment.\u201d I have to go back and bit and tell you that I had competed for a job as an\nassistant to the vice president for academic affairs for the university, and there were two\npositions going. There were 77 applicants, and Edith Terwilliger and I got those\npositions. The former Vice President, P.T. Yankwich, now lives in Washington, as a\nmatter of fact. So, it was very interesting working for this man. He was very bright. He\nwas an intellectual, and he gave me time off to teach the course, and since I got paid for\nteaching the course, it meant I could employ a graduate assistant and pay her that money,\nso she had money during the semester. I gave the course over three or four semesters. It\nwas fascinating because the room which I was assigned filled very quickly, and the\ncomputer cut us off, and I found that the students taking the course were children from all\nends, or both ends, of the Jewish spectrum. They were children of strictly Orthodox\nparents, and children of non-Orthodox parents. They were children of survivors. They\nwere children of Polish immigrants who\u2019d come after the war, and one didn\u2019t know what\ntheir parents had done during the war, and all of them were interesting because, if I told\nthem, for example, the story of a pastor who had saved some Jews, they wanted proof,\nand my xeroxing bill was tremendous. I always brought evidence of anything I told them\nthat was positive about non-Jews who\u2019d helped Jews, and I used to say, \u201cThere were\ngood Germans. There were good Poles. There just weren\u2019t enough of them.\u201d They were\ninteresting groups of students because, as I discovered, those whose parents were\nsurvivors, they told me their parents told them nothing. And I would tell them, \u201cPerhaps\nyou can tell them something of what you\u2019ve learned in the class and see what their\nreaction is. Don\u2019t push them, but gently try to get their stories from them because it 1s\nstill so painful for them \u2014 for them to tell you these stories.\u201d They were very interesting\nstudents, and I kept in touch with them for a long time.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t tell them essentially, but I would \u2014 I think my classes were interesting because I\nwould tell them incidents of my experience. I didn\u2019t tell them in the sense that I\u2019ve told\nyou, but I would tell them of incidents and that I knew of these incidents because of this\nexperience. I think they believed me because they felt that I was talking from experience,\nso they enjoyed taking my course. I made it a difficult course. When I say I made it a\ndifficult course, I didn\u2019t make it easy because of my experience. They had to pass the\ngrade, too, but no, I didn\u2019t tell them because I \u2014 just like with Oscar Schindler, I didn\u2019t\nthink people were interested, and also, I find it very hard to talk about myself. I might tell\nyou this is the first time I\u2019ve ever done it. Nobody has ever asked me before.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: My pleasure. After my husband died, the head of the World Jewish Fund for Jewish\nRelief, no sorry, got the name wrong, haven\u2019t I?",
        "A: Central British Fund for World Jewish Relief called me one day because she knew of my\nrelationship to the organization. She said they had found a tremendous stack of files in\none of the garages at one of the nursing homes, rather, one of the homes for the aged for\nformer refugees. Would I come and look at it? She knew that I came into England fairly\noften because I did have brothers and sisters there. And so I came and looked at the stack\nand was amazed. There were a tremendous number of case histories on individuals. They\nwere files on children who\u2019d been brought out from Austria and Germany on kinder\ntransports. There were minutes of meetings. And I said to this woman, Ava Mitchell,\n\u201cYou have a treasure trove here. You\u2019ve got the archives of your agency. Nobody knows\ntheir story.\u201d And she originally had been a refugee, by the way. She said, \u201c\u201cWould you put\nit together for us?\u201d Well, I wasn\u2019t an archivist, and I knew that the agency would never\nhave the money to employ an archivist. We have to remember that after the war, Britain\nwas still very poor. I said I thought I\u2019d like to do this. So, I packed my bags and came to\nLondon. They gave me a staff. Somebody had given them some money so that we can\nwork on this archive, and Bill & Howe (ph) did our microfilming for us. They were very\nhelpful, and they asked me to do a booklet on the archive, which I did which was\npublished which was rather nice. It took us about 18 months to put this stuff together, but\nit has proved invaluable. For example, one of the items we found were all the records of\npeople who had ever registered with the Jewish Refugees Committee from 1933 on, and\nthat would be from May the 18\", 1933, when the organization was started. It would have\nrecords of people who\u2019d been inquired about and you would find a card which would say,\n\u2018Helen Comb \u2014 deported through Tiresenstadt (ph) And it would give the date because\nsomebody had come in and given this information. And, even to this day, those cards are\nuseful. For example, if you want to prove that you came to England as a refugee, and\nclaim your pension or money from Germany or Austria or some funding which was due\nto you, we could look up your archive and see if your name was there, and it would give\nthe date that you arrived in England. Now, what happened ultimately, as we were\nworking through this archive, I began to see names which said \u201cSt. Louis\u2019, and that\nstruck me because I knew of the story of the St. Louis, this ghastly story of these people\nwho in high hopes went in party fashion, practically, to Cuba, not knowing that they were\ngoing to be refused entry, not knowing that all but about 22 would be refused entry\nbecause the 22 had paid the extra money that was required to get a permanent visa. And I\nstart to make cards on them, and I found about 110 of the people who came into England\nwhere it was marked St. Louis passengers, and I kept these cards. And then one day I\nheard from the museum, your museum, that you were going to do an exhibition on the\npeople who sailed on the St. Louis and the face of those who landed up in Europe, but\nyou really didn\u2019t have full records of those who landed in Britain, although you had\nnames. And I said, \u201cIf you give me all the names, I will be able to trace all of them. And I\nmust say it took me quite a while, I won\u2019t tell you how many weeks, to go through these\n\u2014 the microfilm, find these people, and take a picture of these people, and I found all 187\nof the people who landed in Britain, and I felt very pleased because it will help complete\nyour archive, and it shows the value of doing what we did and the money we spent on\nputting that archive together. Archives are terribly, terribly important, and I only hope\nthat people who may look at this film will realize if they have letters from people during\nthe war, before the war, after the war, which might be useful, to find out from an archivist\nwhere they might be useful. The family might not be interested, but an archive will be\nable to put history together, and without our history we have no future.",
        "A: Thank you. And I must say that there are volunteers today from many countries of the\nworld helping refugees overseas. I only hope they get the kind of the care that the British\ngave to the refugees from Germany and Austria before the war and during the war, and\nafter the war.",
        "A: Yes, you see the same kind of things happening that happened before. If I were younger,\nI would go out and help.",
        "A: Thank you for inviting me.",
        "A: [Badge shown.] The badge that you see was given to all members of Jewish Relief Units\nwho volunteered to go overseas during and after the war. For example, when Bergen-\nBelsen was liberated, more than a 100 people from England \u2014 doctors, nurses, lawyers,\nsocial workers, teachers, went into Bergen-Belsen to help those people who had survived\nthere. This was the badge that the Central British Fund had set up for us so that we would\nbe recognized as a Jewish team, so that survivors who saw the Shield of David would\nrealize that we were Jews who had come to help them, and perhaps ease their burden\nsomewhat.",
        "A: We wore this badge on the beret that we had. We also wore a Shield of David in blue and\nwhite on our sleeves as our insignia. And we wore a British Army uniform at the time,\nBritish army officer\u2019s uniform, actually.\nEnd of Tape #4\nConclusion of Interview\n"
