        "A: [Born in Grodno, April 11th 1929 (phrases missing)] ...small town considering in con...1n the\ncontext of American cities, it was a small town. But a town that had a lot of educational uh\nestablishments and the opera would, for instance, come and perform. Uh I never traveled\nvery much as a child except for the in into the immediate outskirts and I came from a family\nwhere there was a great deal of love and a great deal of concern and a great of care and that\ncontinued until our total separation which came actually in 1940... in 1941 for me.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your, about your friends, growing up? What was school like? What\nkind of schools did you go to?",
        "A: I have attended a number of different schools, probably because my mother and father were\nlooking at what was the best educational outlet rather than a particular school. I went to a\nHebrew school uh which I didn't like terribly much. and them my sister and I spent about a\nyear or two in Catholic school. There were only five or six children and we had, strangely\nenough for Poland at that time, uh Hebrew instructions. But there was an excellent private\nschool and then after that I attended a gymnasium (ph) and my formal education per se\nactually was abruptly stopped in my fifth grade level.",
        "Q: What about friends?",
        "A: Well, I was - my sister was a great hot-head (ph). She was a champion - champion skater,\nchampion swimmer. She was very musical - played a number of instruments. I was given\npiano lessons, ballet lessons. I was particularly interested in the theater. And during the\nRussian occupation from 1939 to 1941, uh the Russian authorities go after talent and\nrecognize it or want to recognize it at a rather early stage. So they said to my parents, we're\nnot interested in how well she will do academically. We have discovered that she has a very\nlovely voice and she's very musical and she dances well and she does very on stage - we are\ngoing to overlook her theatrical career. And so I sang as a soloist at the age of ten with all the\nmajor choirs. I designed and choreographed some ballet without knowing anything about it.\nIt was just a natural outlet, you know. Uh I played with a lot of my friends. We would invent\nsome wonderful plays. It wasn't a store-bought toy. We would play house. We would play uh\nI remember reading a great deal in addition to Pushkin and in addition to the other authors a\nlot of the movie magazines, and so we pretended that I was greta Garbo and my friend would\nbe Marlena Dietrich and we would just go on that way and get some carrots and potatoes\nfrom our kitchens and pretend that we were homemakers and children and all that. So we\nreally had a very kind of a free, delightful uh existence, in spite of the fact that the anti-\nSemitic climate was very strong, very strong, and I was, we were all rather blue-eyed,\nblonde, fair-hair, so that no, people who didn't know that I belonged to a synagogue, that my\nparents did, that I was Jewish. But there were pogroms, quite a few of them, and I kept\nasking why, what's what what's going on? It's very hard for parents to explain because we\nbelieve in a different religion or we belong to a to a synagogue rather than a church that\npeople don't like you. And so I grew up both on one level uh happily because I was loved\nand protected and got the best possible education that I could through my parents, and family\nlife was very important and I imagine that kind of upbringing and that kind of rooted\nembedded uh understanding of my parents that they gave to both my sister and myself,\nprobably helped me a great deal later on to have that base, that strength of knowing who you\nare. Without understanding it, without going into other philosophical discussions about that.\nAnd so that I grew up like I suppose like I - we did not live in a ghetto. We lived in a\nperfectly beautiful apartment near the river Niemen (ph). Uh my mother was more religious\nthan my father and we were religious I suppose like everyone else without being fanatic\nabout it. And my childhood was really quite free of any worries except for the fact that I\nstarted to recognize that there were stones being thrown at our windows towards 1938, 1939,\nand uh I was also told that on Passover which was very beautiful in our home, and my father\nwould, I'm sure to the dismay of my mother invited half of the people who had nowheres to\ngo to our home so they could share that special evening with us, that the Christian children\nwere told that the Jews drink the blood of Christian children during the Passover Seder. And\nit was just something that a child, even as an adult I cannot quite comprehend. But that's the\nkink for archaic teaching that essentially, eventually with ignorance led to the disaster of the\ncatastrophe of the Holocaust. So when you ask me what was my childhood I can describe it\nin terms by saying that it was a pleasant, delightful, carefree surrounded by a lot of love and\na lot of attention and the hand-writing, even as a child without understanding, were already\nlingering in the in the background.",
        "Q: When did this change? When the Russians came, what else happened to you, to your life in\naddition to the special school? Were there any other changes from '39 to '41 that you\nnoticed?",
        "A: Yes, as a matter of fact not understanding what Stalin stood for, not understanding political\nuh politics per se, I loved being there at that ttme because the pogroms have stopped. I was\nindited into what they called the Pioneer, the Young Pioneers Group. They showered a great\ndeal of attention on the children because that's the way they get them. My parents probably\nwere dismayed and couldn't do anything about that. My father I believe was imprisoned for\nabout three or four months because he must, he was, he must have said - I didn't really know\nwhy, but it was obviously for political reasons. He may have said something that did not\nplease the Communist 1n.. uh people. Now you have to understand Grodno is about, I'm not\nsure that I'm being accurate, but it's about sixty miles from the Lithuanian border, or maybe\nless. So that entire area uh was a changeable area geographically. It was first, my parents\nwere born there or close by and then it was Russia. When I was born it Poland, and in 1944 it\nwas Russia again, and it is Russia now. So that uh I did not speak Russian until 1939. I speak\nPoli...[ spoke Polish. We did speak Yiddish but my Yiddish was not terribly good. We spoke\nbasically Polish and when my mother didn't want me to understand something, my sister and\nI would go get furious about that, and she would speak Russian or French to each other. And\nof course at that time I still didn't speak either one of those languages. Well, uh Russia, the\nSoviet Union occupied that part of, well, Germany in 1939 as we know, Germany, Poland\nwas divided. Half of it went to the Nazis and the other half, the eastern, the traditional\nnortheastern part went to the Russians. And Balystok and Grodno and that entire areas\nbecame Russian. I went to school. I loved it. I learned White Russian because that is really\nBieloruss and Russian and did a lot of dancing, a lot of uh gymnastics. My sister was the one\nwho really was known gymnast and I had won quite a few competitions in singing and\ndancing and they encouraged that sort of thing. And life seemed perfectly alright. And then\nin September of 1941, uh everything broke and we were hiding in the bonders because the\nair the air raids were pretty severe. And uh very shortly the following day somebody walked\nup out of the compound and said we've just seen German tanks. Now again, you have to\nunderstand I did not understand the idea what German tanks, what kind of ominous clouds\nthat would sweep around Europe and what it would mean, that the German tanks are in front\nof your door.",
        "Q: What did you do when you heard German tanks, when your family heard German tanks?\nWhat did you and your family do?",
        "A: They were very frightened. They recognized because we had known, we did hear terrible\nstories coming out from the other part of Poland, people who may, who escaped uh what was\nhappening to the Jewish community. But again I must say that maybe because I was playing\nwith dolls one day, and the next day I was asked to be a grown-up, it hadn't quite sunk in,\nwhat the tragedy of the entire period meant. I could only reflect today as I have post-\nHolocaust. When I was in it I didn't really know what was going on. I was we were in a\nvacuum. I was in a vacuum. I can only speak for myself.",
        "Q: That's what we want to talk about, of course, is what you did and thought then rather than\nnow. Then what did you do? Did school continue for example?",
        "A: No, no. Not in '41. Right. In 1941 school did not continue. It was actually not even the\nbeginning of the school semester. Very shortly after, uh we were still in our apartment,\nwithin a matter of a few months if I remember correctly, they had two ghettos in Grodno.\nThe upper ghetto and the ghetto in, not very far from where we lived. And very shortly the\nentire the entire Jewish population of Grodno was being uprooted from their home and that I\nremember very distinctly and with great pain. We had some beautiful china. We had a very\nlovely home. Wasn't rich but it was beautiful. The Germans would come in and simply at the\nwhim of a wisp, just like that (fingers snap), remove the most beautiful china and just throw\nit against a wall to break it, for fun, and started to taunt and tease. And you didn't really have\nto be all that young to recognize that this was the devil in the flesh. We were evacuated to a\nto the ghetto uptown, my both my father and my mother and my sister and I. Uh my mother\nwas one of three sisters. One had come to this country and the other was married to a\nprominent professor with three children. One of my cousins was a uh young man who I\nbelieve was only 23 but he was considered to be a genius, so much so, electronic, that the\nGermans used him for two years as what they called a Einutzliger Jude (ph), a useful Jew,\nand when they have extracted what they needed, they killed him. His older sister, my other\ncousin, was a, completed the Warsaw Conservatoire and was a concert pianist and somehow\nmanaged to escape to uh to Alma Ata in Russia [NB: Kazakhstan]. The younger of the three\ncousins uh stayed with her mother. Because my uncle was considered in High Intelligentsia\nthey have, they rounded them up and they killed them. When were in the second ghetto, I\nbelieve my cousins, my cousin, just my aunt and my, my and her younger daughter were\nwith us. We had improvised schools meaning that we still believed that the world may not\nhave gone altogether and that we will need an education, and so we continued with our\nstudies on an improvised basis by having the teachers who were there get the children and\nget them together. Uh I'll tell you something rather interesting. My father worked as a\nforester. That means that he was a specialist in wood and primarily worked with peasants.\nPoland is known for beautiful woods. He was extremely well liked. He was, I remember my\nfather more often on a horse in a leather cap in a leather jacket and leather boots riding on\neither - we had two horses, a white one and a grey one. My father came home on day and\nsaid that some peasant families said let me have your children for you. They are both very\nlight. They don't look Jewish. Why don't you let us have them. We will hide them for you.\nAnd I remember having a little conference and both my sister and I said no. If we cannot be\ntogether then we're not going to be without you. In November of 1942 the second ghetto\nwhere I was with my family got split up. They were obviously starting the evacuation\nprocess to the many camps that we didn't know anything about.",
        "Q: Can we hold it for one minute, (Sure) and I'd like you to describe the life in the first ghetto.\nWhat was your daily life like? You mentioned school. What else was going?",
        "A: With all due respect I cannot be absolutely clear and remember it to that extent except that it\nwas bearable. It was bearable to the fact that my parents were with me. My sister was with\nme. We tried to improvise and play. I had no idea. I'm sure my parents felt differently\nbecause I was so young. And because I was so young I didn't stop to think what is going on\nexcept that somehow we were not at home. We shared a room with many other people. Uh\nlife was no normal, but we were still a family. And then very abruptly, as they usually do\nthose things, and for me - I don't know what go what went on with the with the other ghetto\nwhere they the first ghetto - as I said we were in the second ghetto - they probably started to,\nin fact I'm sure they started to evacuate because this was already in 1942. No doubt that the\nJews who were in the German part of Poland had already been evacuated. But this is the\neastern part and they you know they had to start a whole new program. Excuse me. Uh they\nrounded us up. We had no idea why. I had no idea why. Maybe the others did. My parents\nand I, my sister and I and my parents were separated. My sister and I were taken to, by\ntrucks to ghetto number one. We had no idea what happened to our parents. I had\nsubsequently learned that the transport, that was, went to Auschwitz and they were in a way\nentered the camp as most of them of course did not. My sister and I remained in the first\nghetto. That was already very difficult. It was it was wintertime. The selections were, in\nother words the evacuation process began quite earnestly. We work in a in a tobacco factory.\nMy sister and I would share a kind of little cot in somebody's house and ____ the house the\nhouse belonged to a friend of mine who, they were no longer there, and we were, we\nmanaged to hide every time, like maybe three or four selec...uh not selections because they\nweren't all called selections but the raids - in other words to find the Jews to send them to\nwherever they were sending them - we didn't know where - we managed to escape. And we\ncontinued to give ourselves some kind of moral support by saying look, we'll probably leave\nhere and I'm sure we'll be with our parents again. But, on January probably the 18th or 20th,\nsomewheres around there, 1943, we hid behind very heavy snow behind the synagogue\nwhich is where they would run, round everybody up and we could no longer hide. We were\nfound and walked to the to the to the station and what was so dreadful and I remember that -\nI did not see Shoah but the told me about that. The people were standing and watching as the\npeople, as their neighbors - I don't know, I didn't recognize anyone but were being obviously\ndragged without too much clothes, without any necessarily private possessions, to the train\nstation. And then we saw the cattle cars. And that's when the reality set in but I still had no\nidea that a place like Auschwitz existed. That they were still doing the actually burning\npeople. We didn't know that. My sister gave me my mother's coat. A long coat, and I think\nthat coat may have been responsible for my going into the camp rather than to the crematory\nright away. My sister was very bright. She was very cleaver. She was absolutely wonderful,\ntremendously liked. Her name was Sala (ph) and the train ride was probably one of the worst\nthings that I can possibly remember. The train ride was utterly horrendous. People died.\nThere was no water. There were no sanitary facilities. There was no food. Whatever was had\ngone very quickly. It was about three and a half days. And then we stopped and we saw\nAuschwitz. And we said I bet you we're going to meet our parents. Well, we were right to\nsome extent, except that we didn't meet them. During the time that we were that we came\ndown, in other words we were at disembarked or let from the train, Sala said to me, don't\nspeak, don't move, let me think for a moment. We were about twenty-five hundred people. I\nhave a book by the way, from somebody from Grodno who had just published the entire\nhistory of the Jews of Grodno and it's the most incredible thing is that even my number is\nmentioned there, so that I learned something about - I mean as I said, there are (ph) these are\ndocumentations that are there because there was a trial of the Nazis of Grodno. Maybe I was\nvery dumb or just very young, but I didn't understand or knew as much as many other people\ndid. When we embarked my sister noticed that the majority of the people from the train were\nbeing pushed to one side and a rather small group was being pushed to one side, both men\nand women. She said don't ask any questions, just walk over to that small group, and she\nfollowed me. And the guard the guard said, Genoch. There were eight-five women and a\nhundred and twenty men out of something like twenty-five hundred who were then brought\ninto Auschwitz. The rest went directly to the crematortum. Now we didn't know about that.\nBut after one day you did know because the, at that time uh when I came to Auschwitz\nwhich was January, January 24th, 1943, the chimneys were very high and the smell of flesh\nwas very prominent, and you no longer could pretent that this is the place where we're going\nto meet our parents. So this was my introduction to Auschwitz. And I suppose you want to\nknow what happened and I will tell you briefly...",
        "Q: Let's slow down a little. (Alright.) Uh tell me when you arrived into the camp, where were\nyou taken and what did you do?",
        "A: I was taken, we were taken to a block, I don't know exactly where. We then were asked to\nundress completely. Naked. I had some photographs of my family which were torn to shreds.\nHair was completely shaved. And a rather painful tatoo was put on my left forearm. My\nsister knew my terrible fear of doctors as a child, I don't know why, and she kept whispering\nto me, be brave. And my number was 31386, and her number was 31387 and in those days\nthey gave the numbers smack in the front of the left forearm, not inside. I think they ran out\nof space or ran out of numbers or maybe they recognized that perhaps it is not such a good\nidea to be quite so prominent about that. For your information I had it plasmically removed\nuh in London. Not because I don't want to remember but because I don't always wish to talk\nabout it, or to talk about it perhaps 1n an interview such as this where it has meaning and it\nhas a realistic archival uh value for the future. Alright so we were stripped and the hair was\nshaven and the number was tattooed and we were given clothing of uh dead prison...uh\nRussian prisoners of war and taken to some block and that was the beginning of two years.",
        "Q: Tell me, who was...",
        "A: I have no idea. They were speaking all different languages. I did not know German. I did not\nknow Hungarian. Actually the Hungarians came later. Mainly I think the people at that time\nwere from Poland. Polish Jews. Uh possibly Czechoslovakian but I really am not totally sure\nso I can't tell you. Of course later on you know, day and night became, time had no meaning\nat that point. But it was dreadfully hard because the winters are very difficult. Uh the mud -\nwhen it rained it was just muddy. Uh food was unbearable if you were - you eventually\nlearned to eat that but it was uneatable really.",
        "Q: What did you have to eat?",
        "A: I think, you know the fact 1s and I, my sister and I used to joke because my mother and my\nfather would make me eat like so many parents you know, drink your milk. You know,\nhere's a piece of chocolate. Uh I'll take you here. The bribery aspects because I was very\nthin. In fact I was the youngest of everyone and the mo..the sickliest of everyone. Finally\nthey thought I had some kind of a heart condition which may not have been true but my\nparents were very protective of my health so I wasn't allowed to plant trees which I wanted\nto do and all that sort of thing. And this is the irony that I am the one who survived and my\nsister who was never sick in her life died three months later. Uh and I was glad that she died.\nAnd I will tell you in a minute why I say that in such candor. Uh we were going to work -\nthese were probably the most horrendously difficult months, the first three months. If you\nsurvived the first day, maybe you survived a second. If you made it through the week,\nchances are you might make it to the second week. Time had no meaning. We were very\nshortly put to work outside the camp, carrying very heavy stones. But the most horrendous\npart of it all, there was a man in Auschwitz who name was Tauber (ph) and I eventually\nasked uh Wiesenthal whether he knew what happened to this pretention of a man. And\nfinally he was caught and or he died anyway. But I remember him very well. He was in\ncharge of the selections as people would come back from a very long and a very difficult and\na very hungry day. You were made to jump five feet over a ditch if you, and many didn't. It\nyou made, if you were able to jump across, about five feet or maybe more, I don't know, then\nyou were OK. If you didn't then you never went back to the camp. I mean this was a little\nplay. Cruelty in its most perfect form. And that went on for quite some time. During that\ntime my sister once put her hand in her pocket because it was freezing, and I never will\nforget that. I heard the tremendous slam of a whip on her back. Uh the officer, uh one of the\nguards said don't you every do that again. In other words you're not allowed to put you hands\nbecause you were frozen to death in your packet. Uh Sala one day complained of not feeling\nvery well, and she says I don't think I can get out. It was a Friday, and I said I don't care\nwhether you can get up - you've got to get up, because if you don't they will take you to\nBlock 25. You know, you become very wise very quickly and you learn to know what Black\n25 1s because when you would pass by you would see dead bodies. That was a daily sight.\nNobody you know, you don't even cry anymore. There are no tears left. (Cough) Excuse me.\nBut Sala couldn't go to work. She probably had typhoid. We don't know. I mean it took -\nSunday night she was dead. She didn't go to work on Friday. I went to see her in this Block\n25 or hospital - whatever that was, sad as it was - on Saturday. On Sunday I came to see her.\nThat was April the 10th. So here is a beautiful, brilliant, talented, healthy, athletic eighteen\nyear old girl, delirious...with fever looking at me and she says I have to get up because\ntomorrow is the birthday of my sister and I didn't get her anything and I held her in my arms\nand she died in my arms. Watching this incredible drama was I woman that I did not know\nshe...came up to me and she said in German, which I did not understand very well then - she\nsaid I don't have any children. I'm not married, but if I had a little girl, I would like her to\nlook just like you and be just like you. Come. Martha had been in Auschwitz three months\nbefore we had arrived there. She was a nurse by profession, an operating room nurse, but in\nAuschwitz at that time she was carrying dead corpses which was - she witnessed this\nincredible little drama and she said ___ (ph) - don't worry little girl. I will take care of\nyou. Martha was about twenty years older than I was. And take care of me she did. She\nsaved my life about four or five times. Four from the crematoria and others when I was\ndeathly ill with typhoid or God knows that else, and she would steal injections and save me\nthat way. So Sala died and I cried very bitterly that day. And then years came and went by\nbefore I cried again. I just did not cry. I couldn't. Once you let your defenses down, you're\ndone. People say you know, you're very strong and I said that's bull. What does 1t mean?\nHow do you practice the art of survival anyway? It's not a question of strength. You don't\neven know what's happening to you. What it is a sort of self, self-discipline by saying if I'm\ngoing to make it, I'm going to retreat from all that and emerge in a way into my own fantasy\nworld. And it's very healthy. I have subsequently done quite a bit of reading in my studies, in\nmy undergraduate and master's programs in various psychology books, a lot of which by the\nway I do not agree with, and Bruno Betelheim idea was something that I really could not\nagree with. The survival, the guilt of survivors - I don't have guilt for surviving. I was guilty -\nI said why am I the only one but can one question God or nature or fate? I don't know but\nthis whole idea that one is guilty because one survived - it's not guilt - 1t 1s something else,\nand I don't think it's guilt at all. But the idea of fantasy is a very healthy idea, even today\nwhen things become a bit difficult and I am alone - I am at home everywhere, and I'm home\nnowheres. It's my, my life has been so totally uprooted at such an early stage that I have\nnever been able to say this is the only place I feel home. I can feel home everywhere, or\nmake my home anywhere and be perfectly comfortable about it. But to come back to your\noriginal question, uh Sala's death was very painful because she was a tremendous moral\nsupport for me. She was my older sister. She and I recognized that we will never see our\nparents again and I knew exactly what happened to my parents and I still am to this day don't\nwant to know or think that hopefully they were not conscious when they were thrown into\nthe crematoria. And I had worked there for three months uh sorting the clothes of those who\nwent there. Uh I continued to work and then eventually uh I don't know how - [ really can't\ntell you - I transferred to another camp. It was, this was Birkenau. When I talked about\nAuschwitz, Auschwitz is Birkenau the way we know it. Auschwitz is a town where some of\nthe medical experimentations were done etc. but the camp where or where, I don't know, I\nthink two and one half million Jews were slaughtered, some were Christians, but for\ndifferent reasons - and that's just as terrible. I was transferred I think to Lager C and then I\nwas made what they call an___. There were no children in Auschwitz by the way when I\nwas there. There were I think five children because they only took the healthy, like say from\neighteen to about thirty-five and so on, and I was really not. As again how I made it I don't\nknow. That's something I can never understand. When I was in selections, which were all the\ntime, and Mengele looked at me because I was so very fair, but anyone who came from the\nnorth whether you were Swedish or whether you were Norwegian or Polish, if you just\nhappened to be light then you were light whether you were Jewish, Christian or anything\nelse. He looked at me and I remember his face. He ways are you Jewish? And I said yes.\nWhat, first of all, not only my number but I had a little triangle that indicated that was even,\nyou know, put salt on the open would. Were your parents Jewish? Yes. I says Umeglish (ph).\nSomeone said shut up. Don't you know this guy conducts experimentation of all kinds,\nexperiments of all kinds of things. He may want to do something to find out what, whether\nyour blood 1s different from that of a Christian child. I didn't ... but I was exposed to a great\nmany and again without having any kind of understanding whatsoever why I was spared, I\ndon't know. On on four occasions I was not. But I was very very ill. I couldn't walk and I was\nhidden. And again uh Martha uh smuggled me into the Christian hospital - when I say\nhospital I mean the block where only the Christians were - the Jews and the Christians were\noften not together. And put about seventy-five different dresses on me because they all\nworked in the cre...you know in the crematoria where you could get those things. But I\ncouldn't walk because I had probably typhoid or whatever, and they would inject me with\nglucose or whatever else they could their hands on to keep my strength up. I was fourteen by\nthen, look like ten, and one day kline (ph), Dr. Kliner or whoever else was there came in,\ntook down my number. Now we knew, we knew that once your number had been taken -\nthat's the kiss of death. And there wasn't even a question of crying - you sort of accepted the\nfact that you are going to die. And you lived with that death. I have to interject something\nright here. Later on in my professional life as a singer, I studied for one of my concerts a\nbeautiful song by Franz Schubert (ph) to the poetry by (ph) Klaudius called (ph),\ndeath and the girl. When death appears as friend, he says come, give me your hand, you\nsweet and lovely maiden - don't be afraid. I am your friend and I will take care of you. Well,\nlater on when I studied that song it became extremely meaningful because I was praying for\nthat kind of a friend. During one of these, during that time when I knew that I was not going\nto be here tomorrow, the woman who was in the next bed was a student of Sigmund Fraud,\nsomebody who was a well-known psychiatrist and she was also a she died...",
        "Q: Excuse me. This 1s now in the Christian hospital?",
        "A: This is now 1n the Christian hospital. (Thank you.) Alright. And I went to sleep. And I\ndreamt something quite incredible. And I told her about that later. I dreamt that I was\nwalking on a very high precipice. I had very long blonde hair that mother used to do like you\nknow Shirley Temple style and I was wearing a white and pink dress that was that was like a\nit was purely, it was a dream - I was walking and it was kind of moving around and I knew I\nknew that when I would that I was walking towards the end and there was nothing there. I\nwould have to fall and die. And I kept going anyway. Now I couldn't walk in those days\nmind you, but I was sort of running. And as I approached that enormously steep precipice\nsomebody jolted me and I woke up and there was Martha standing in front of me with tears\nin her eyes and she said my Kindchen (ph), little girl - a miracle just happened. We have\nbeen able to erase your number from Kline's list and you are not going to the crematorium. I\ntold it I mean I didn't understand what psychology was. I had no idea who Freud was you\nknow I mean. Uh I thought reading Anna Karenina under the table was something forbidden\nyou know because uh and she said that was a very revealing dream. She says you are you\nhave predicted your own future without even knowing it at that time. That happened a few\ntimes. I was made __ meaning messenger. And because of that, because I was young\nand because at that point you sort of I don't know - they just accepted me there I guess...",
        "Q: We are now back in Lager C...",
        "A: Oh, we were in Lager C all the time, but there were different aspects of the \"life\", quote,\nunquote, in Lager C. During Lager C times there was a woman by the name of Irma Grese\nwho was very frightening to be around. She was extremely beautiful, dressed as cleanly as\nyou can possibly, you can see you could see your face 1n her boots. She was always with an\nenormous German Shepherd and a whip. And I was really very frightened of her. Everybody\nwas. She would sick her dog on a poor inmate for no reason at all. And the dog would just\nabout demolish that person. Very peculiar things kept happening to me. One evening, well\nevening - I don't know - one late afternoon after, we were never allowed you know we had\nour great big meal - stale bread and maybe a piece of salami and some horrible smelling\ncoffee, then you could not go out. That was curfew. Someone, the head of the block_____ of\nthe woman who was in charge of our barrack who was always an inmate, came up and she\nsaid uh Grese wants to see you. Now I did not know that and I didn't even know what\nhomosexuality was but apparently she was a lesbian and because almost everyone there was\nfive or six or seven years older than I was, and she and people said, oh boy, shall we kiss you\ngoodbye you know. God knows what is what it is that she wants to do. I walked into the that\nlittle office and there was this Irma Grese standing 1n civilian clothes and I must tell you she\nlooked like a vision out of another world. She was wearing a yellow coat. Her hair was\nblonde and usually she was it was always very tightly pulled back. Her hair was long, let\nloose. She wore perhaps a little lipstick - I don't remember. But she was wearing a yellow\ncoat and she smiled at me. Imagine! I was frightened to death, and she looked at me and she\nsaid, I'll never forget that conversation - you know, I have forgotten a great deal purposefully\nbecause you can't live with all the memories, but there are some things that kind of stand out\n- and she said uh, come her, come here. She took my little cheek and she said, ah ha. She\nsaid they tell me that you look a lot like I, and I wanted to be sure that was really true. And I\nin my total natvest said, oh I said, I don't think there's any, I've never seen anyone more\nbeautiful, and I meant it. I mean she was like a vision. You know, you have to understand we\nhaven't seen anything like that. The woman took a liking to me. Thank God she never did\nabuse me, but she made me stand guard in front of the barracks while she would make love\nto the most beautiful Jewish girls there. She also gave me an extra piece of salami and made\nme uh do her boots or something like that. In other words, she sort of took a slight liking. I\nthen found out to my horror when I was already in London and bought the book called \"The\nBelsen Trials,\" which is really the Auschwitz trials, Kramer and Hoess, that she was one of\nthe five people who were actually executed for her crimes. She was twenty-three years old.",
        "Q: What did you know of her role in the barracks? She was SS...",
        "A: Oh no, she was (or did yu know\u2019) she was more, yes, I don't know whether SS - I don't know\n- she probably were. This was a, the concentration camp guards, such as Grese and a\ncommandant like uh Kramer (ph), they were of a different breed of people. They looked\nhuman, but these were not human beings. They, you, people, humanity as we know it, even\nin the worst possible way, cannot behave that way. There's a predisposition, there's a pre-\nelection to the kind of evil. They must have been chosen for the very fundamental and the\nmental qualities that these people possessed to be able to perform and do what these people\ndid, because \"normal\", quote and unquote, people who are, who have sensitivities and uh and\nhuman qualities per se in the smallest quality cannot possibly behave in that manner. She\nwas one of the those. Now she could be perfectly lovely. She was nice to me. But it may\nhave been a little toy to her. I mean you know, that I didn't have a relationship with her. Uh\nshe was in charge of Lager C. She was, she had total power. She could do anything she\nwanted to anybody at anytime because she was the, I forget the German word, ober...\nsomething or other. Head, head guard person, and that's all documented, and I as I said I\nbought the \"The Trials\" after the war when I was in London and read it studiously in horror -\nto read my own my own history so to speak, because I lived in a in a little vacuum, not really\nknowing that in another camp other things were happening.",
        "Q: What did standing guard for Irma Grese?",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "Q: What did standing guard for Irma Grese?",
        "A: You mean as far as I was concerned. Well I was told that she that she was a lesbian. I did not\nknow in those days what that meant. And that she was making love to another woman and\nwould I stay guard to see that maybe other Germans would be coming or other guards of her\ncaliber would be coming along and she wanted to be alerted. That's what it meant. Not all the\ntime - sometimes.",
        "Q: To your knowledge, did she injure or kill the women that she made love to?",
        "A: That I don't know, but she injured and killed an awful lot of women period. She had close to\n- I mean thousands of people that she had tortured, but I don't know whether that was done\nduring her uh tryst or not. I doubt it but I don't know. That I can't I can't tell.",
        "Q: Did you, can you describe any other indicates with Irma Grese, her behavior with other\npeople?",
        "A: Yes. Yes I can. When we would have what the called the Zel (ph) appell, that means that in\nthe morning the roll call would take place, and because I was (ph), that means that I\nwould be there to deliver messages to the central off...to the central block, to the\ncommandment, or to anybody and bring it back to the people in the camp. Uh she would\nmake us stand for hours at a time in freezing horrible weather or very hot, depending __ I\nwas one of the - I still don't understand - I was there for two years. Uh I have told people\nwhen the they used to ask me what my educational background 1s, I said I have a Ph.D. from\nAuschwitz. That covers a lot of ground doesn't it. Not really. The world really doesn't, the\nworld is not really that interested from the human end. There are always those who are. The\nmajority still have really no idea what happened. It's too painful to grasp and they can't be\nbothered. But Irma Grese would let us stand for hours. People would faint. She would trod\non them. She would beat them. She would sick her dog. She would punish people very\nbadly. She was very cruel. She was extremely cruel. They did not execute, Nuremberg did\nnot execute many people. A great many people were put into many different sentences,\nprison sentences, but they executed her, so they must have had far more evidence than I'm\ngiving you here today, documented but from my own personal experience that is precisely\nmy recollection, except that she was, I didn't realize that she was twenty-three. I don't know.\nAge at that point didn't really mean terribly much, but she was twenty-three years old which\nseems pretty extraordinary to have reached the power of such depth of degradation at such\nan early age and so she was executed Nuremberg. Yes.",
        "Q: You have mentioned that you were in selection with Mengele. Can you describe one of those\nselections for us?",
        "A: Yes. What was so striking and in fact everything that I'm saying to you today is sort of in\nretrospect how weird those events were. Mengele never raised his voice. He would simply\nstand there with this finger, and this meant one thing and this meant another thing, and he\nsays, you know you've really lived long enough. I think its time to go on. In that kind of a\nmanner. I never heard him raise his voice. He didn't have to. He relished and enjoyed every\nmoment of his glorious power. So you see, when you think of Mengele, which 1s\nunbelievable, this is a monster. This 1s a medical doctor. When you think of Kline (ph), when\nyu think of the great minds in a sense, educated people, the crematoria as I've mentioned in\nsome of my speeches when I, the few times that I do speak subjectively, and this is one of\nthe few times that I do, the crematoria were built, were designed and built not by idiots, not\nby people who didn't know what they were doing. But by highly educated, trained Ph.D.'s\nwho knew exactly what they were doing. And they designed that whole \"Dant'es Inferno\" -\nyou know, there's a line in \"Dante's Inferno\" that says Lachate Oni Speranze Voiche (ph),\nthat means abandon hope all ye who enter here. Now when Dante wrote this in his inferno,\nhe must have been thinking about Auschwitz or places like Auschwitz. Or people like\nMengele or like Kramer, like Hoess, like Grese and like so many other whose names I don't\nexactly remember - we were not formally introduced. The other thing about Auschwitz that I\nremember that helped me is to have a sense of humor. Some people say how can you do\nthat? If you cannot laugh at yourself, you die. By the way, that's true of today too. People\nwho take themselves very seriously are bores (ph), but when you have to, when you do not\nhave a sense of humor during that time, and you really recognize the depth of the tragedy\naround you, you can't make it. You see the mind can still function. It can overcome all kinds\nof extraordinary circumstances. So say, he, I'll see you tomorrow on the soap board.\nAnd that sounds horrible doesn't it? But the truth is that as you know, they would make all\nkinds of, I mean the Germans, the Nazis I should say, were very cleaver as to what they were\ndoing. They wast...wasted nothing. Everything was a must for fortunes of war, and the fat\nwould be used for certain productions including soap. Now it sounds horrible today. It\nsounds depraved. But at that time it was a way of saying we know what's going to go on.\nThere's nothing we can do about it. So let's laugh.",
        "Q: On that note, let's hold it for a minute. Let them change tapes.",
        "A: Good. I need a break.\nTape #2\n(Tape snag - technical conversation)",
        "Q: Uh you had described several times that Martha helped you a great deal. Can you describe\nother incidents uh other than the one in the Christian hospital where she helped you?",
        "A: Yes. Well I was first in the Jewish hospital. Well, I, the hos...the word hospital 1s incorrect.\nIt's fallacious. There were no hospitals. There was a block where you went if you were sick\nand if you were Jewish which that means you never came out of there. Martha worked with\nthe doctors because she was a nurse and somehow she was able to man...to get medicine,\ninjections which she uh was able to administer to me which kept me alive. Uh the Christian\ninmates 1n the in the Christian hospital were allowed to get packages from home and would\nshare some of the goodies from home with me because I was the child you see. I was that\nlittle girls. Uh and then on a few occasions Martha actually was able with the help of\nsomeone else to remove the number that was written down for me to go pastures 1s the only\nway you can put it. Uh something that the normal mind and I say, when I say normal mind I\nmean people who thank goodness, thank God have not experienced my adolescent years,\nwould find it extremely difficult to grasp. Maybe people who were in Viet Nam might to\nsome extent understand that when you walked out in the morning for the roll call, you would\nliterally see hundreds of emaciated bodies still warm, piled up in front of the barracks, and\nyou didn't cry. That was it. It was like you are in hell, and that's part of hell. When I think\nabout it today I said how is it possible. It's beyond me. It is a question, when people say how\ndid you survive, I haven't got the foggiest idea. There is no earthly reason in the world why I\nwas chosen to talk to you today. I don't know. Maybe there is some plan that the heavens,\nGod, whatever, that I'm here. Maybe to bear witness, and that is why I have set my own\nfeelings aside, which 1s not easy, to uh to share with you some of my own remembrances so\nthat perhaps those, the people or the children or whoever is going to perhaps hear what I\nhave to say today, will recognize that the madness that 1s in our society today Neo-Nazis\nwho say that the Holocaust never happened, that this is the pure imagination of the Jewish\ncommunity, will know that uh theirs is a dangerous pack, and the Holocaust did not only\nhappen but it's a very living reality.",
        "Q: I there anything else about Auschwitz, before we move on, anything more Auschwitz, that\nyou want to add or to tell us?",
        "A: The only way I can describe Auschwitz is it wa the de...de...de...deepest dissension of what\nwe considered in our wildest imagination, for hell to be. Auschwitz was the final the final\napocalypse. It cannot be described really. Even I who was there for twenty-four months,\nhave difficulty, and I'm sure that I have deliberately forgotten quite a great deal. I don't think\nI could function as a as a human being and be as an accomplished in many way and continue\non with life if I had to live and remember what happened to me there. And I think again here\nthe mind works some miracles. It was, you remember what 1s essential, but you sort of forget\nall the other - it's like having a baby - you remember the beauty but you don't remember the\npain, because other wise no woman would ever have a baby. Uh and Auschwitz was\nsomething, it was the cradle of death. It gave people who were deranged the absolute perfect\nopportunity to exercise their wildest macabre behavior.",
        "Q: Under what circumstances did you leave Auschwitz?",
        "A: Actually I didn't leave Auschwitz. I was evacuated. I was there until the last bitter moment,\nexcuse me (cough). Before I answer you that question I just want to say something which I\nfind very important. Yes, there were many other people in Auschwitz, Christians, political\nprisoners, uh prostitutes, homosexuals, uh murderers, but I want people to understand one\nvery important thing - it was primarily an extermination camp of the Jews of Europe.\nBecause the Christian inmates were not subjected to the same treatment. They were not\nsubjected to uh to crematoria. If they \"sinned\" (quote, unquote) according to them, they were\nhanged. I don't know that there were any selections for the Christians. They were there were\nany selections for the Christians. They were there as criminals and treated as such as though\nit was a prison. A terrible prison for them. But Auschwitz and the concentration camps of\nEurope were made for one reason and one reason alone and that is to - I don't want to use\nexterminate - it was, you exterminate cock roaches - for the murder of Jews. And six million\ndied, not just in Auschwitz - in others. I think that's very important to understand. (Thank\nyou.) And I have primarily spoken to Christian groups in my short few years that I have\ndecided that I had a responsibility. I wanted to speak to the Christian community, to make\nthem understand that. Now, I left, or I would say I didn't leave - I was evacuated from\nAuschwitz on January 24th, - I came to Auschwitz, excuse me, I came to Auschwitz on\nJanuary 24th, 1941, and evacuated on January 18th, 1945. That was another terrible time.\nWe actually went through Berlin and saw a leveled city. By that time I spoke fluent German,\nfluent -you see I did go to school there - fluent German, fluent Hungarian, fluent\nCzechoslovakian, and fluent Italian I mean - there were so many people from all over the\nworld, and I wound up in a dreadful place called Ravensbruck.",
        "Q: How did you get from Auschwitz to Ravensbruck?",
        "A: By train, I don't know how many days it took but counting was not one of those things that\nwe did there. It was by that time the end of January, maybe two weeks later, maybe ten days\nafter - I really don't know, but it was in January. Ravensbruck was built for x amount, like\nmaybe thirty-five hundred people, and at that time we were there were something like fifteen\nthousand people. It was dreadful, horrible, and extraordinarily - I met Martha there, and she\nsaid to me at that time, if anything happens and either one of us is alive, I want you to meet\nme in such and such a city after the war. And she's still alive. She's in Brazil, and I went to\nsee her in Brazil. She's quite ill. She has never recovered from Auschwitz. I guess she must\nbe about seventy-five now perhaps - I don't really know. Uh but anyway after Ravensbruck\nof which I have a blur because it was terrible, and like typical Martha, she shared her slice of\nbread with me and still reprimanded me because I, I mean she sort of imagined herself that I\nwas her little girl, and then...",
        "Q: Do, don't don't go by Ravensbruck even if its a blur quite so quickly. How long were you\nthere?",
        "A: I would say about three weeks.",
        "Q: What, through the blur, can you remember, of the camp?",
        "A: Masses of people, death, terrible starvation, no work. We didn't work there. It was, there was\nthere was some chaos at that point, and don't forget this is January '45 and I think Auschwitz\nin fact had already been liberated by the Russians, and we were just, kept going on. I can't\ntell you too much about it because as I said I remember being uh praying let's get this out, I\ndon't want to live anymore. I mean, you know, you can't go on like that. I knew there was no\none left as far as my family was concerned. I knew there was no way. Uh I don't know what\nhappened to Martha after that because we were separated. And then again we were put on\ntrains and ridden further into what was still the remaining of the Third Reich. And I wound\nup in a camp called Retzof-am-Richlin (ph), which was apparently not originally a\nconcentration camp. It was a camp that was built for the men or the women who worked\nadjoining uh there was a very large factory where they I was told they manufacture the uh\nthe missiles that eventually devastated London, and so that it was a much more relaxed\ncamp. There were no crematoria. Uh it was already confusion. I mean this was already like\nyou know beginning of February, end of January, February, March, April - I was there\nactually until, perhaps I was in Ravensbruck longer than that because I think I was in Retzof\nfor about three and a half months.",
        "Q: Can you describe the camp for us? Where were you taken first?",
        "A: I don't remember. It was not the same procedure that was both either at Auschwitz or\nRavensbruck. Uh we were brought on trucks 1n fact, not on a train, to my knowledge. We\nwere on trucks and we were quite sure they were going to shoot us because Retzof is\nsurrounded by many woods. Uh what struck me about that camp was that it was relatively\nnice, meaning that it was not, the barracks were different. They were much more, they were\nmuch bigger. Uh it was smaller. There may have been maybe two thousand, twenty-five\nhundred people, mainly women. I don't remember seeing men there. It was much looser in\ndiscipline.",
        "Q: OK. How did that manifest itself?",
        "A: How do you mean?",
        "Q: You say it was looser in discipline. What did that mean?",
        "A: It meant that uh they'd fill up, the behavior of the guards was not as obnoxious and as scary.\nThey were primarily men, German soldiers, rather than women. Women could be terrible, by\nthe way. The women in Auschwitz were horrendous, the German women. There were to my\nrecollection no women. There was a women's camp, but there were mainly men who were\nthe guards. The commandant was not as scary as I remember say Hoess Ora Kramer. The\nmajority of the pe...the workforce, we worked in the woods where we would uh chop wood\nfor the war production because again this was around the woods and we never felt by the\nway that we would get out of there. Never. We were quite sure that we were going to be\nshot, that they could not let, not everyone had a number - not that many were out of\nAuschwitz, but some of us were. In fact the majority really. There really are not that many\nwho have that kind of a number as I do because uh - don't ask me why. Providence. Je ne\nsais pas. I don't know. So that Retzof particularly after Ravensbruck was heaven. I mean you\ncould, and again they asked me what did I do - I mean what, everybody sort of did\nsomething if you survived that long, my God, you know, what did you do? Said I was a\nloifering (ph). Oh good, we need a loifering (ph) here. So immediately they gave me that\nbandanna with the gothic letters and I became a loifering (ph). That means that I could go to\nthe kitchen and sometimes they, the German woman in charge would throw me an extra\npiece of bread. I didn't need very much in those days. I think that may have also, I really\nthink that may have contributed somewhat to my survival. As a child I didn't need much\nfood. I didn't, I did not eat very much there, and so much so that when I eventually came to\nthis country and my aunt was very concerned because I could go three days without eating,\nand she took me to the Valley Hospital for some tests. They found that my stomach had\nshrunk very considerably. I simply was not accustomed to sitting down and eating a normal\nmeal. I still can't do seven courses in on in one evening. I have tried to justified, to justify\nwhy I and why not somebody else, and it's not the guilt in me. It's the questioning, why, and I\nhave no idea. I don't know. It is absolutely against all odds.",
        "Q: Can you tell me, what did you do in Retzof? Did you work and what was your work in\naddition to being a loifering?",
        "A: Primarily I was a loifering which means that I stood in front, inside the gates of the camp,\nand be ready to be at any body's beck and call from the main Block Fuhrerstube (ph) or the\nguards who needed something, or bring their supper or whatever. And then I worked for a\nwhile in the woods with the other kommando chopping woods which was a little heavy\nwork, and that's basically what was going on there. There was, there were other things there.\nThere were mis...uh seamstress who were doing some clothes correction I remember. As I\nsaid this camp had different things but you have to understand again, I wish I could be more\ndescriptive to you as to what, how and when, but I really can't because I can only tell you\nfrom my memory what I did when. I really don't know - there were so many other aspects.\nAnd we didn't exactly share the information on what was going on five blocks away, so that\na great deal of my information about, not about my own subjective experience, but about the\nentire tragedy of the catastrophe I learned by reading about other peoples' accounts and by\nreading historical and documentation of that nature.",
        "Q: We of course are going to focus here on you. (Right.) Uh, can you tell us of uh, do certain\nthings that went on in the camp or in your experience, stand out in your memory?",
        "A: Yes, It does. In fact, what stands out in my memory even in Auschwitz, was that humanity\nwas not lost among the among the survivors, among - I shouldn't say survivors, among the\ninmates. People did care for each other. People did give each other moral support. People did\ncommensurate with each other and tried to help. There was very little because people were\ndying and the suffering was so intense that it was very difficult to give strength to someone\nelse, but Martha is a perfect example. There were a few others who extended a helping hand.\nBut the one incident that comes about me 1s a very unusual one. and a very far-out sort of an\nincident because it came from a German soldier in Retzof-am-Richlin. There was a young\nnineteen year old guard who very shortly after I arrived there, started look at me very\ndifferently, and I didn't know why. He, eventually we spoke, we met. He was actually from\nLuxembourg. He was a medical student. He was brought in there. He said to me, what are\nyou doing here, the first time I saw him. He was a guard standing on this scaffold with a gun,\nand I was down here standing and he started to sing me a little, a little German song. And I\nthought boy, this guy has a real sense of humor, you know. And he said listen, what are you\ngoing here? And he didn't say it in an angry way. And I thought to myself, he's crazy. I said,\nwell, I am Jewish. And he apologized and he said, he was obviously very green. He didn't\nrealize it. He said look, I knew what was going to the, I knew what was going on in Germany\nwith the Jewish community, but I am, I was a medical student until just a few months ago,\nand I had no idea to what extent the brutality went on. I am only now learning from the older\nguards who talk about it with relish, and I go out and I vomit. This young nineteen year old\nmedical student, SS guard because they needed new people to they brought anyone in,\nRumanians, Bulgarians, eventually within a few months, was willing to risk his life by\nsaying to me, you are not going to survive because they will kill you. This, the rumor goes\naround that they will shoot everybody here. They can't, they don't want to whatever is left,\nthey can't let, leave that much evidence. I have contacted a woman in the village who lost her\nhusband and two sons and is very bitter, told her about you. She says she will give me\ncivilian clothes and I will take you there when there is a break. I promise you. And I said\nwhy are you doing it. He said because I love you. Now you have to understand that here was\na Jewish girl, sixteen years old, speaking to a German, to a man wearing a German uniform\nsaying I love you and I'm not going to let you die. I'm going to help you. I said we can both\nhang for it. Don't say a word to anyone. It's a long story which I will not go into now, but I\nwas Very...",
        "Q: Please, do go into it.",
        "A: Well he was very, well, he was very, he was incredibly tender. He asked me to join the\nkommando because he wanted to tell me more about it and the he says, speak to the\ncommandant. Everybody eventually winds up going to the woods and working there, and\nhe'll let you, which I did. I was scared to death, but the commandant knew me and he said\nOK. You can rotate with other girls. As I said, this was a little more human. You simply\ndidn't go to a commandant and stay, do you mind if I go work some place else. This is just\nnot the way it was. And Lucien had all the plans. He was incredibly tender. He was\nincredibly beautiful, and I said what is going on with me. What is happening here? How, you\nmean there is still a heart beating under somebody who is wearing a German uniform? Here\nwas a Christian boy and a Jewish girl caught up in hell, and this, and I must admit I didn't\nknow, I mean I knew that nature was beginning to play havoc with me, but I didn't know\nwhat the word love is or anything. I mean I didn't know that one does, that there are normal\nemotions which nature was letting me know were happening. One night he said, very\nabruptly and very angrily, while he was there, he says I want my supper in my in my Block\nFuhrerstobe tonight. Bring it to me. So I brought the tray, and I knew there was something\nwrong, and I walked into the Block Fuhrerstobe. There was bedlam there. This was already\nApril - I don't know maybe April 20th, maybe April 25th. And uh I opened the door and\nthere he was standing without a gun and without a tie, the white shirt opened slightly,\nwithout his cap and I knew something was terribly wrong. He said put down the tray. He\nsaid we've just got we've just got word that we have to evacuate like immediately. Tomorrow\nmorning. I cannot help you. I cannot bring you out of here. But I pray to God that you're\ngoing to live, because I'm going to find you. And he gave me a magnificent poem and a\nphotograph of himself in civilian clothes. It was the most bizarre thing - it was like a like a\nlike icing on a on a cake of some kind that was just, what's going on here. Well, to cut a long\nstory short, we were evacuated, and then I found out that he was killed in action on the\nRussian front. But he made an impact on me. He made an enormous impact on me because\nhe, people say to me, I have been asked, do you hate the Germans? No. I don't like to hate\nanybody. I hate the Nazis. I hate the people who have perpetrated that disaster on people. But\nyou cannot simply say everybody is rotten. No. They're not. People are people. There are\nrotten people everywhere. But this incident, having just spent forty-five months in camps and\nghettos, to have a, somebody in a German uniform with a gun supposedly guarding me say\nto me I'm going to risk my life for you. I'm going to let you escape ____ (ph) will kill you.\nAnd I may be killed with it but I love you, was an inkling that maybe there 1s after all\nanother world of which I knew nothing about.",
        "Q: Quite a story. What happened to you next?",
        "A: We were evacuated in the middle of the night, just as Lucien had predicted, and we were\nquite sure that we were going to be killed. And we were not put on trucks. We were walking.\nNo idea where we were walking. That was May the 2nd. Mind you I'm really coming to the\nend of the war. Everything, or at this point here, Germany was combined of a tiny little spot\nwhere the Americans and the English and the Russians and the French on all sides. They\nkept going with us. Of course, they the guards were much more relaxed. They knew that this\nis the end. There was just no way, but they kept walking us, for week...for what seemed like\nendless...a lot of people couldn't make it and want by the wayside. In fact that's when I asked\none of the older guards, I said by the way, you know that young fellow, Lucien, who was at\nthe gate, whatever happened to him? And he looked at me. He said, ah Buby (ph), we got\nword that he was killed in uh at the Russian front two weeks ago. Well I thought, I'm the\none, he didn't feel anything, I did. We went on and on and on finally we couldn't really walk\nanymore and this was already like May the 4th and I say May the 4th, because May the Sth I\nwas liberated, so I knew that it had to be. We hi...there was a terrible bombardment. I mean\nwe heard and we _____ to see planes, hear the Americans...what I don't know whether\nthey were American but they were certainly Al...uh Allied planes and tremendous uh fires\nfrom tanks and stuff, and we hid during one of those terrible raids in a bunker and never\nwent out. Nobody looked for us anymore. And that was it. The next day, we slept in a, that\nnight we slept in a barn we found with the cows and the pigs on the bottom, and the next\nmorning very early - the sun was still shining - I liked through a crack and I saw a Russian\nsoldier. And I jumped out, woke everybody - there were about twelve of us out of the girls\nwho were with me or I was with - and he must have thought I came from another world.\nWell, I did. I did. And I spoke fluent Russian, so I recognized, and I'm very sorry to tell you\nthat eventually when we went to another town, we wanted to be repatriated so that we could\nfind out, because we were completely isolated - this is now East Germany - the Russian\ncommandant, who whoever he was, who was repatriated, and I mean people had no idea yet\nwhat was going on. People did not digest the horror. Maybe the Russians did because of uh\nbecause they liberated Auschwitz, but the generally speaking the May the 5th was not yet a\nday that people knew what was going on, even Dachau which was liberated by the by the by\nthe Americans, and Buchenwald and all that, the general public so to speak didn't yet know\nincluding some of the Russians, and uh he says you mean to tell me that there are some Jews\nstill left through all that. But he said it in a way and I thought here I was in all the Pioneer as\na child you know, being taught about the greatness of Russia - I believed that garbage - and\nhere is somebody throwing that anti-Semitic remark to me right back in my face when I\nhaven't even gotten out from the stained, blood-stained clothing. That was quite an\nawakening to me. That was an I was jolted into another kind of reality from which I never\nquite recovered meaning that, and this is why I have contributed some of my time - what had\nhappened then can happen again. And unless you and I, people like you and many like you\nand the Holocaust Memorial Committee and the Museum, do not keep an absolutely alert\nvigilant eye, we may all be in trouble again, and it may not necessarily be the Jew. It can be\nanybody who has green eyes and dark hair. Anything can happen. I hope I have answered\nsome of the questions you wanted.",
        "Q: Tell me how you got, very briefly, from there to here. Uh what happened after liberation?\nWhere did you go?",
        "A: Very briefly, I will try to do it, but as briefly as I can, because I want I was in the I was first\nin the repatriation camp in Germany. Uh since Martha told me to meet her in a place called\n_ilina which is Slovakia, not Czechoslovakia but Slovakia, and I spoke fluent Slovakian and\nfluent uh fluent Hungarian which everyone apparently does there, and I knew that I had\nabsolutely no one left in Grodno and I mean there was nothing to go back to - I had been\ncompletely alone. That was a reality that hit me very quickly 1n the face. Now what? Uh, I\ntold them that I was born in _ilina, and that I was going to Czechoslovakia. The only trouble\nI had to convince them is that I really was sixteen, because I looked like ten, and they were\ngoing to put me with the orphans uh program and I didn't want to be with the children's\nprogram. I wanted to go on my own. And so I convinced them and told them I was two years\nolder than I really was, which they didn't really believe me, but somehow I managed. Uh and\nI went to Prague. That's another story, not for today - that's quite an incredible story all by\nitself...",
        "Q: Encapsulate____.",
        "A: Encapsulated is that I was supposed to, I came, I went on a four-day bus from Breslau (ph) to\nPrague and most of the people on that bus were people... (phrase missing)\nTape #3\n..and completely alone in this world. That hit me as if to say, now what. But I didn't, I mean\nif you go through an experience like Auschwitz you sort of don't become philosophical and\nsay well now what. And I was determined to go to _ilina and I was given, I had no money of\ncourse - they gave us a ticket. They told us where to go. Said get a ticket - you don't have to\npay for it, and then you will sleep at the Jan Maszaryk House, so I went to the thing and I got\na ticket but on the way back I didn't know who Jan Maszaryk was and I forgot where I was\nsupposed to be and I couldn't remember the name of the house. So I sat down and ____(ph)\nwhere all that stuff was just going on there, and I sat down on a bench and I said OK, I will\nsleep here tonight. It was a lovely night, it was July. Had a little tiny white sweater and a\nlittle tiny bag like that - that was my whole belongings. And I said I'll wait here until\ntomorrow. I didn't know what I was supposed to do. I was alone but a young man comes up\nand sits next to me - starts talking to me in German. My German was very good at the time.\nHe says what are you doing here, and I explained the story. Her says well do you know your\nfriend is in_ilina? No. Do you have any relatives? I have an aunt in New York. Well, I could\nhelp you maybe write to her or do something, but I can't help you if you are there. Why don't\nyou let met help you? OK. It was like (snap fingers) - life and death decisions made at the\nspur of the moment. He could have raped me, he could have done anything, right? Took me\nto a Catholic convent and I stayed there for three months, and his father worked for a rather\nfamous typewriter company called Schvetka, and I worked - he got me a job there and I\nlearned Czechoslovakian, not Slovakian - I spoke Slovakian you know - within a very short\ntime I was earning a little money and living 1n a in the convent, and he was quite a\nremarkable man, and I have just given you a little tiny medallion which he gave me at that\ntime. And eventually uh the American Joint Distribution Committee found me, through my\naunt I suppose. I wrote by the way - that might interest you - I wrote five letters in Russian,\nidentical letters to my aunt, and I wrote on each letter on the bottom, if you should get all of\nthese letters, please don't think I've lost my mind. I'm fine. I'm giving it to an American\nsoldier, and I don't know which one of them will forward directly to you, and she got all five,\nand she said thank God you wrote that because I would have said poor child is really not\nright. Then I went to London, and instead of being...",
        "Q: How?",
        "A: Through the American Joint Distribution Committee the with the with the orphans uh\nprogram, and I uh instead of spending a year in London or six months which they told me\nyou don't know English - I think it's a good idea that yu go there before you go to the States\nbecause you're under Polish visa or quota uh, why don't you go to London and you can at\nleast learn a little bit of English. And I said well, very well and I knew three words in\nEnglish at that time, thank you and peace. And it turned out to e four years. And I loved it.\nUh and so I came from Breslau to Prague, from Prague to London, from London to New\nYork, etc. etc. and now I'm in Washington.",
        "Q: Nina, is there anything that you would like to add?",
        "A: Yes, I would like to add by saying that the archives that are being collected and documented\nfor posterity, articles, video-taping, lectures, books, are of unbelievable importance. Not, the\nHolocaust you see I never looked at the at the Jewish issue - it's not. It's an universal issue\nthat affects each and every one of us and the more the American public, the European\npeople, anyone, the Arab world, the black community, the children who feel very slighted\nfor many good reasons, understand the historical, the soci...sociological, the philosophical\naspect of the Holocaust, the better off we all are because this is the greatest lesson that we\ncan learn about humanity in any form or shape that you want. And I think that this kind of a\npreservation of history, not those that are that write their own to change their own times, 1s\nwhat might save the world so that we do not repeat that. Because history has an ugly way of\nrepeating itself and we cannot allow that to happen.",

        "A: [Born in Grodno, April 11th 1929 (phrases missing)] ...small town considering in con...1n the\ncontext of American cities, it was a small town. But a town that had a lot of educational uh\nestablishments and the opera would, for instance, come and perform. Uh I never traveled\nvery much as a child except for the in into the immediate outskirts and I came from a family\nwhere there was a great deal of love and a great deal of concern and a great of care and that\ncontinued until our total separation which came actually in 1940... in 1941 for me.",
        "A: I have attended a number of different schools, probably because my mother and father were\nlooking at what was the best educational outlet rather than a particular school. I went to a\nHebrew school uh which I didn't like terribly much. and them my sister and I spent about a\nyear or two in Catholic school. There were only five or six children and we had, strangely\nenough for Poland at that time, uh Hebrew instructions. But there was an excellent private\nschool and then after that I attended a gymnasium (ph) and my formal education per se\nactually was abruptly stopped in my fifth grade level.",
        "A: Well, I was - my sister was a great hot-head (ph). She was a champion - champion skater,\nchampion swimmer. She was very musical - played a number of instruments. I was given\npiano lessons, ballet lessons. I was particularly interested in the theater. And during the\nRussian occupation from 1939 to 1941, uh the Russian authorities go after talent and\nrecognize it or want to recognize it at a rather early stage. So they said to my parents, we're\nnot interested in how well she will do academically. We have discovered that she has a very\nlovely voice and she's very musical and she dances well and she does very on stage - we are\ngoing to overlook her theatrical career. And so I sang as a soloist at the age of ten with all the\nmajor choirs. I designed and choreographed some ballet without knowing anything about it.\nIt was just a natural outlet, you know. Uh I played with a lot of my friends. We would invent\nsome wonderful plays. It wasn't a store-bought toy. We would play house. We would play uh\nI remember reading a great deal in addition to Pushkin and in addition to the other authors a\nlot of the movie magazines, and so we pretended that I was greta Garbo and my friend would\nbe Marlena Dietrich and we would just go on that way and get some carrots and potatoes\nfrom our kitchens and pretend that we were homemakers and children and all that. So we\nreally had a very kind of a free, delightful uh existence, in spite of the fact that the anti-\nSemitic climate was very strong, very strong, and I was, we were all rather blue-eyed,\nblonde, fair-hair, so that no, people who didn't know that I belonged to a synagogue, that my\nparents did, that I was Jewish. But there were pogroms, quite a few of them, and I kept\nasking why, what's what what's going on? It's very hard for parents to explain because we\nbelieve in a different religion or we belong to a to a synagogue rather than a church that\npeople don't like you. And so I grew up both on one level uh happily because I was loved\nand protected and got the best possible education that I could through my parents, and family\nlife was very important and I imagine that kind of upbringing and that kind of rooted\nembedded uh understanding of my parents that they gave to both my sister and myself,\nprobably helped me a great deal later on to have that base, that strength of knowing who you\nare. Without understanding it, without going into other philosophical discussions about that.\nAnd so that I grew up like I suppose like I - we did not live in a ghetto. We lived in a\nperfectly beautiful apartment near the river Niemen (ph). Uh my mother was more religious\nthan my father and we were religious I suppose like everyone else without being fanatic\nabout it. And my childhood was really quite free of any worries except for the fact that I\nstarted to recognize that there were stones being thrown at our windows towards 1938, 1939,\nand uh I was also told that on Passover which was very beautiful in our home, and my father\nwould, I'm sure to the dismay of my mother invited half of the people who had nowheres to\ngo to our home so they could share that special evening with us, that the Christian children\nwere told that the Jews drink the blood of Christian children during the Passover Seder. And\nit was just something that a child, even as an adult I cannot quite comprehend. But that's the\nkink for archaic teaching that essentially, eventually with ignorance led to the disaster of the\ncatastrophe of the Holocaust. So when you ask me what was my childhood I can describe it\nin terms by saying that it was a pleasant, delightful, carefree surrounded by a lot of love and\na lot of attention and the hand-writing, even as a child without understanding, were already\nlingering in the in the background.",
        "A: Yes, as a matter of fact not understanding what Stalin stood for, not understanding political\nuh politics per se, I loved being there at that ttme because the pogroms have stopped. I was\nindited into what they called the Pioneer, the Young Pioneers Group. They showered a great\ndeal of attention on the children because that's the way they get them. My parents probably\nwere dismayed and couldn't do anything about that. My father I believe was imprisoned for\nabout three or four months because he must, he was, he must have said - I didn't really know\nwhy, but it was obviously for political reasons. He may have said something that did not\nplease the Communist 1n.. uh people. Now you have to understand Grodno is about, I'm not\nsure that I'm being accurate, but it's about sixty miles from the Lithuanian border, or maybe\nless. So that entire area uh was a changeable area geographically. It was first, my parents\nwere born there or close by and then it was Russia. When I was born it Poland, and in 1944 it\nwas Russia again, and it is Russia now. So that uh I did not speak Russian until 1939. I speak\nPoli...[ spoke Polish. We did speak Yiddish but my Yiddish was not terribly good. We spoke\nbasically Polish and when my mother didn't want me to understand something, my sister and\nI would go get furious about that, and she would speak Russian or French to each other. And\nof course at that time I still didn't speak either one of those languages. Well, uh Russia, the\nSoviet Union occupied that part of, well, Germany in 1939 as we know, Germany, Poland\nwas divided. Half of it went to the Nazis and the other half, the eastern, the traditional\nnortheastern part went to the Russians. And Balystok and Grodno and that entire areas\nbecame Russian. I went to school. I loved it. I learned White Russian because that is really\nBieloruss and Russian and did a lot of dancing, a lot of uh gymnastics. My sister was the one\nwho really was known gymnast and I had won quite a few competitions in singing and\ndancing and they encouraged that sort of thing. And life seemed perfectly alright. And then\nin September of 1941, uh everything broke and we were hiding in the bonders because the\nair the air raids were pretty severe. And uh very shortly the following day somebody walked\nup out of the compound and said we've just seen German tanks. Now again, you have to\nunderstand I did not understand the idea what German tanks, what kind of ominous clouds\nthat would sweep around Europe and what it would mean, that the German tanks are in front\nof your door.",
        "A: They were very frightened. They recognized because we had known, we did hear terrible\nstories coming out from the other part of Poland, people who may, who escaped uh what was\nhappening to the Jewish community. But again I must say that maybe because I was playing\nwith dolls one day, and the next day I was asked to be a grown-up, it hadn't quite sunk in,\nwhat the tragedy of the entire period meant. I could only reflect today as I have post-\nHolocaust. When I was in it I didn't really know what was going on. I was we were in a\nvacuum. I was in a vacuum. I can only speak for myself.",
        "A: No, no. Not in '41. Right. In 1941 school did not continue. It was actually not even the\nbeginning of the school semester. Very shortly after, uh we were still in our apartment,\nwithin a matter of a few months if I remember correctly, they had two ghettos in Grodno.\nThe upper ghetto and the ghetto in, not very far from where we lived. And very shortly the\nentire the entire Jewish population of Grodno was being uprooted from their home and that I\nremember very distinctly and with great pain. We had some beautiful china. We had a very\nlovely home. Wasn't rich but it was beautiful. The Germans would come in and simply at the\nwhim of a wisp, just like that (fingers snap), remove the most beautiful china and just throw\nit against a wall to break it, for fun, and started to taunt and tease. And you didn't really have\nto be all that young to recognize that this was the devil in the flesh. We were evacuated to a\nto the ghetto uptown, my both my father and my mother and my sister and I. Uh my mother\nwas one of three sisters. One had come to this country and the other was married to a\nprominent professor with three children. One of my cousins was a uh young man who I\nbelieve was only 23 but he was considered to be a genius, so much so, electronic, that the\nGermans used him for two years as what they called a Einutzliger Jude (ph), a useful Jew,\nand when they have extracted what they needed, they killed him. His older sister, my other\ncousin, was a, completed the Warsaw Conservatoire and was a concert pianist and somehow\nmanaged to escape to uh to Alma Ata in Russia [NB: Kazakhstan]. The younger of the three\ncousins uh stayed with her mother. Because my uncle was considered in High Intelligentsia\nthey have, they rounded them up and they killed them. When were in the second ghetto, I\nbelieve my cousins, my cousin, just my aunt and my, my and her younger daughter were\nwith us. We had improvised schools meaning that we still believed that the world may not\nhave gone altogether and that we will need an education, and so we continued with our\nstudies on an improvised basis by having the teachers who were there get the children and\nget them together. Uh I'll tell you something rather interesting. My father worked as a\nforester. That means that he was a specialist in wood and primarily worked with peasants.\nPoland is known for beautiful woods. He was extremely well liked. He was, I remember my\nfather more often on a horse in a leather cap in a leather jacket and leather boots riding on\neither - we had two horses, a white one and a grey one. My father came home on day and\nsaid that some peasant families said let me have your children for you. They are both very\nlight. They don't look Jewish. Why don't you let us have them. We will hide them for you.\nAnd I remember having a little conference and both my sister and I said no. If we cannot be\ntogether then we're not going to be without you. In November of 1942 the second ghetto\nwhere I was with my family got split up. They were obviously starting the evacuation\nprocess to the many camps that we didn't know anything about.",
        "A: With all due respect I cannot be absolutely clear and remember it to that extent except that it\nwas bearable. It was bearable to the fact that my parents were with me. My sister was with\nme. We tried to improvise and play. I had no idea. I'm sure my parents felt differently\nbecause I was so young. And because I was so young I didn't stop to think what is going on\nexcept that somehow we were not at home. We shared a room with many other people. Uh\nlife was no normal, but we were still a family. And then very abruptly, as they usually do\nthose things, and for me - I don't know what go what went on with the with the other ghetto\nwhere they the first ghetto - as I said we were in the second ghetto - they probably started to,\nin fact I'm sure they started to evacuate because this was already in 1942. No doubt that the\nJews who were in the German part of Poland had already been evacuated. But this is the\neastern part and they you know they had to start a whole new program. Excuse me. Uh they\nrounded us up. We had no idea why. I had no idea why. Maybe the others did. My parents\nand I, my sister and I and my parents were separated. My sister and I were taken to, by\ntrucks to ghetto number one. We had no idea what happened to our parents. I had\nsubsequently learned that the transport, that was, went to Auschwitz and they were in a way\nentered the camp as most of them of course did not. My sister and I remained in the first\nghetto. That was already very difficult. It was it was wintertime. The selections were, in\nother words the evacuation process began quite earnestly. We work in a in a tobacco factory.\nMy sister and I would share a kind of little cot in somebody's house and ____ the house the\nhouse belonged to a friend of mine who, they were no longer there, and we were, we\nmanaged to hide every time, like maybe three or four selec...uh not selections because they\nweren't all called selections but the raids - in other words to find the Jews to send them to\nwherever they were sending them - we didn't know where - we managed to escape. And we\ncontinued to give ourselves some kind of moral support by saying look, we'll probably leave\nhere and I'm sure we'll be with our parents again. But, on January probably the 18th or 20th,\nsomewheres around there, 1943, we hid behind very heavy snow behind the synagogue\nwhich is where they would run, round everybody up and we could no longer hide. We were\nfound and walked to the to the to the station and what was so dreadful and I remember that -\nI did not see Shoah but the told me about that. The people were standing and watching as the\npeople, as their neighbors - I don't know, I didn't recognize anyone but were being obviously\ndragged without too much clothes, without any necessarily private possessions, to the train\nstation. And then we saw the cattle cars. And that's when the reality set in but I still had no\nidea that a place like Auschwitz existed. That they were still doing the actually burning\npeople. We didn't know that. My sister gave me my mother's coat. A long coat, and I think\nthat coat may have been responsible for my going into the camp rather than to the crematory\nright away. My sister was very bright. She was very cleaver. She was absolutely wonderful,\ntremendously liked. Her name was Sala (ph) and the train ride was probably one of the worst\nthings that I can possibly remember. The train ride was utterly horrendous. People died.\nThere was no water. There were no sanitary facilities. There was no food. Whatever was had\ngone very quickly. It was about three and a half days. And then we stopped and we saw\nAuschwitz. And we said I bet you we're going to meet our parents. Well, we were right to\nsome extent, except that we didn't meet them. During the time that we were that we came\ndown, in other words we were at disembarked or let from the train, Sala said to me, don't\nspeak, don't move, let me think for a moment. We were about twenty-five hundred people. I\nhave a book by the way, from somebody from Grodno who had just published the entire\nhistory of the Jews of Grodno and it's the most incredible thing is that even my number is\nmentioned there, so that I learned something about - I mean as I said, there are (ph) these are\ndocumentations that are there because there was a trial of the Nazis of Grodno. Maybe I was\nvery dumb or just very young, but I didn't understand or knew as much as many other people\ndid. When we embarked my sister noticed that the majority of the people from the train were\nbeing pushed to one side and a rather small group was being pushed to one side, both men\nand women. She said don't ask any questions, just walk over to that small group, and she\nfollowed me. And the guard the guard said, Genoch. There were eight-five women and a\nhundred and twenty men out of something like twenty-five hundred who were then brought\ninto Auschwitz. The rest went directly to the crematortum. Now we didn't know about that.\nBut after one day you did know because the, at that time uh when I came to Auschwitz\nwhich was January, January 24th, 1943, the chimneys were very high and the smell of flesh\nwas very prominent, and you no longer could pretent that this is the place where we're going\nto meet our parents. So this was my introduction to Auschwitz. And I suppose you want to\nknow what happened and I will tell you briefly...",
        "A: I was taken, we were taken to a block, I don't know exactly where. We then were asked to\nundress completely. Naked. I had some photographs of my family which were torn to shreds.\nHair was completely shaved. And a rather painful tatoo was put on my left forearm. My\nsister knew my terrible fear of doctors as a child, I don't know why, and she kept whispering\nto me, be brave. And my number was 31386, and her number was 31387 and in those days\nthey gave the numbers smack in the front of the left forearm, not inside. I think they ran out\nof space or ran out of numbers or maybe they recognized that perhaps it is not such a good\nidea to be quite so prominent about that. For your information I had it plasmically removed\nuh in London. Not because I don't want to remember but because I don't always wish to talk\nabout it, or to talk about it perhaps 1n an interview such as this where it has meaning and it\nhas a realistic archival uh value for the future. Alright so we were stripped and the hair was\nshaven and the number was tattooed and we were given clothing of uh dead prison...uh\nRussian prisoners of war and taken to some block and that was the beginning of two years.",
        "A: I have no idea. They were speaking all different languages. I did not know German. I did not\nknow Hungarian. Actually the Hungarians came later. Mainly I think the people at that time\nwere from Poland. Polish Jews. Uh possibly Czechoslovakian but I really am not totally sure\nso I can't tell you. Of course later on you know, day and night became, time had no meaning\nat that point. But it was dreadfully hard because the winters are very difficult. Uh the mud -\nwhen it rained it was just muddy. Uh food was unbearable if you were - you eventually\nlearned to eat that but it was uneatable really.",
        "A: I think, you know the fact 1s and I, my sister and I used to joke because my mother and my\nfather would make me eat like so many parents you know, drink your milk. You know,\nhere's a piece of chocolate. Uh I'll take you here. The bribery aspects because I was very\nthin. In fact I was the youngest of everyone and the mo..the sickliest of everyone. Finally\nthey thought I had some kind of a heart condition which may not have been true but my\nparents were very protective of my health so I wasn't allowed to plant trees which I wanted\nto do and all that sort of thing. And this is the irony that I am the one who survived and my\nsister who was never sick in her life died three months later. Uh and I was glad that she died.\nAnd I will tell you in a minute why I say that in such candor. Uh we were going to work -\nthese were probably the most horrendously difficult months, the first three months. If you\nsurvived the first day, maybe you survived a second. If you made it through the week,\nchances are you might make it to the second week. Time had no meaning. We were very\nshortly put to work outside the camp, carrying very heavy stones. But the most horrendous\npart of it all, there was a man in Auschwitz who name was Tauber (ph) and I eventually\nasked uh Wiesenthal whether he knew what happened to this pretention of a man. And\nfinally he was caught and or he died anyway. But I remember him very well. He was in\ncharge of the selections as people would come back from a very long and a very difficult and\na very hungry day. You were made to jump five feet over a ditch if you, and many didn't. It\nyou made, if you were able to jump across, about five feet or maybe more, I don't know, then\nyou were OK. If you didn't then you never went back to the camp. I mean this was a little\nplay. Cruelty in its most perfect form. And that went on for quite some time. During that\ntime my sister once put her hand in her pocket because it was freezing, and I never will\nforget that. I heard the tremendous slam of a whip on her back. Uh the officer, uh one of the\nguards said don't you every do that again. In other words you're not allowed to put you hands\nbecause you were frozen to death in your packet. Uh Sala one day complained of not feeling\nvery well, and she says I don't think I can get out. It was a Friday, and I said I don't care\nwhether you can get up - you've got to get up, because if you don't they will take you to\nBlock 25. You know, you become very wise very quickly and you learn to know what Black\n25 1s because when you would pass by you would see dead bodies. That was a daily sight.\nNobody you know, you don't even cry anymore. There are no tears left. (Cough) Excuse me.\nBut Sala couldn't go to work. She probably had typhoid. We don't know. I mean it took -\nSunday night she was dead. She didn't go to work on Friday. I went to see her in this Block\n25 or hospital - whatever that was, sad as it was - on Saturday. On Sunday I came to see her.\nThat was April the 10th. So here is a beautiful, brilliant, talented, healthy, athletic eighteen\nyear old girl, delirious...with fever looking at me and she says I have to get up because\ntomorrow is the birthday of my sister and I didn't get her anything and I held her in my arms\nand she died in my arms. Watching this incredible drama was I woman that I did not know\nshe...came up to me and she said in German, which I did not understand very well then - she\nsaid I don't have any children. I'm not married, but if I had a little girl, I would like her to\nlook just like you and be just like you. Come. Martha had been in Auschwitz three months\nbefore we had arrived there. She was a nurse by profession, an operating room nurse, but in\nAuschwitz at that time she was carrying dead corpses which was - she witnessed this\nincredible little drama and she said ___ (ph) - don't worry little girl. I will take care of\nyou. Martha was about twenty years older than I was. And take care of me she did. She\nsaved my life about four or five times. Four from the crematoria and others when I was\ndeathly ill with typhoid or God knows that else, and she would steal injections and save me\nthat way. So Sala died and I cried very bitterly that day. And then years came and went by\nbefore I cried again. I just did not cry. I couldn't. Once you let your defenses down, you're\ndone. People say you know, you're very strong and I said that's bull. What does 1t mean?\nHow do you practice the art of survival anyway? It's not a question of strength. You don't\neven know what's happening to you. What it is a sort of self, self-discipline by saying if I'm\ngoing to make it, I'm going to retreat from all that and emerge in a way into my own fantasy\nworld. And it's very healthy. I have subsequently done quite a bit of reading in my studies, in\nmy undergraduate and master's programs in various psychology books, a lot of which by the\nway I do not agree with, and Bruno Betelheim idea was something that I really could not\nagree with. The survival, the guilt of survivors - I don't have guilt for surviving. I was guilty -\nI said why am I the only one but can one question God or nature or fate? I don't know but\nthis whole idea that one is guilty because one survived - it's not guilt - 1t 1s something else,\nand I don't think it's guilt at all. But the idea of fantasy is a very healthy idea, even today\nwhen things become a bit difficult and I am alone - I am at home everywhere, and I'm home\nnowheres. It's my, my life has been so totally uprooted at such an early stage that I have\nnever been able to say this is the only place I feel home. I can feel home everywhere, or\nmake my home anywhere and be perfectly comfortable about it. But to come back to your\noriginal question, uh Sala's death was very painful because she was a tremendous moral\nsupport for me. She was my older sister. She and I recognized that we will never see our\nparents again and I knew exactly what happened to my parents and I still am to this day don't\nwant to know or think that hopefully they were not conscious when they were thrown into\nthe crematoria. And I had worked there for three months uh sorting the clothes of those who\nwent there. Uh I continued to work and then eventually uh I don't know how - [ really can't\ntell you - I transferred to another camp. It was, this was Birkenau. When I talked about\nAuschwitz, Auschwitz is Birkenau the way we know it. Auschwitz is a town where some of\nthe medical experimentations were done etc. but the camp where or where, I don't know, I\nthink two and one half million Jews were slaughtered, some were Christians, but for\ndifferent reasons - and that's just as terrible. I was transferred I think to Lager C and then I\nwas made what they call an___. There were no children in Auschwitz by the way when I\nwas there. There were I think five children because they only took the healthy, like say from\neighteen to about thirty-five and so on, and I was really not. As again how I made it I don't\nknow. That's something I can never understand. When I was in selections, which were all the\ntime, and Mengele looked at me because I was so very fair, but anyone who came from the\nnorth whether you were Swedish or whether you were Norwegian or Polish, if you just\nhappened to be light then you were light whether you were Jewish, Christian or anything\nelse. He looked at me and I remember his face. He ways are you Jewish? And I said yes.\nWhat, first of all, not only my number but I had a little triangle that indicated that was even,\nyou know, put salt on the open would. Were your parents Jewish? Yes. I says Umeglish (ph).\nSomeone said shut up. Don't you know this guy conducts experimentation of all kinds,\nexperiments of all kinds of things. He may want to do something to find out what, whether\nyour blood 1s different from that of a Christian child. I didn't ... but I was exposed to a great\nmany and again without having any kind of understanding whatsoever why I was spared, I\ndon't know. On on four occasions I was not. But I was very very ill. I couldn't walk and I was\nhidden. And again uh Martha uh smuggled me into the Christian hospital - when I say\nhospital I mean the block where only the Christians were - the Jews and the Christians were\noften not together. And put about seventy-five different dresses on me because they all\nworked in the cre...you know in the crematoria where you could get those things. But I\ncouldn't walk because I had probably typhoid or whatever, and they would inject me with\nglucose or whatever else they could their hands on to keep my strength up. I was fourteen by\nthen, look like ten, and one day kline (ph), Dr. Kliner or whoever else was there came in,\ntook down my number. Now we knew, we knew that once your number had been taken -\nthat's the kiss of death. And there wasn't even a question of crying - you sort of accepted the\nfact that you are going to die. And you lived with that death. I have to interject something\nright here. Later on in my professional life as a singer, I studied for one of my concerts a\nbeautiful song by Franz Schubert (ph) to the poetry by (ph) Klaudius called (ph),\ndeath and the girl. When death appears as friend, he says come, give me your hand, you\nsweet and lovely maiden - don't be afraid. I am your friend and I will take care of you. Well,\nlater on when I studied that song it became extremely meaningful because I was praying for\nthat kind of a friend. During one of these, during that time when I knew that I was not going\nto be here tomorrow, the woman who was in the next bed was a student of Sigmund Fraud,\nsomebody who was a well-known psychiatrist and she was also a she died...",
        "A: This is now 1n the Christian hospital. (Thank you.) Alright. And I went to sleep. And I\ndreamt something quite incredible. And I told her about that later. I dreamt that I was\nwalking on a very high precipice. I had very long blonde hair that mother used to do like you\nknow Shirley Temple style and I was wearing a white and pink dress that was that was like a\nit was purely, it was a dream - I was walking and it was kind of moving around and I knew I\nknew that when I would that I was walking towards the end and there was nothing there. I\nwould have to fall and die. And I kept going anyway. Now I couldn't walk in those days\nmind you, but I was sort of running. And as I approached that enormously steep precipice\nsomebody jolted me and I woke up and there was Martha standing in front of me with tears\nin her eyes and she said my Kindchen (ph), little girl - a miracle just happened. We have\nbeen able to erase your number from Kline's list and you are not going to the crematorium. I\ntold it I mean I didn't understand what psychology was. I had no idea who Freud was you\nknow I mean. Uh I thought reading Anna Karenina under the table was something forbidden\nyou know because uh and she said that was a very revealing dream. She says you are you\nhave predicted your own future without even knowing it at that time. That happened a few\ntimes. I was made __ meaning messenger. And because of that, because I was young\nand because at that point you sort of I don't know - they just accepted me there I guess...",
        "A: Oh, we were in Lager C all the time, but there were different aspects of the \"life\", quote,\nunquote, in Lager C. During Lager C times there was a woman by the name of Irma Grese\nwho was very frightening to be around. She was extremely beautiful, dressed as cleanly as\nyou can possibly, you can see you could see your face 1n her boots. She was always with an\nenormous German Shepherd and a whip. And I was really very frightened of her. Everybody\nwas. She would sick her dog on a poor inmate for no reason at all. And the dog would just\nabout demolish that person. Very peculiar things kept happening to me. One evening, well\nevening - I don't know - one late afternoon after, we were never allowed you know we had\nour great big meal - stale bread and maybe a piece of salami and some horrible smelling\ncoffee, then you could not go out. That was curfew. Someone, the head of the block_____ of\nthe woman who was in charge of our barrack who was always an inmate, came up and she\nsaid uh Grese wants to see you. Now I did not know that and I didn't even know what\nhomosexuality was but apparently she was a lesbian and because almost everyone there was\nfive or six or seven years older than I was, and she and people said, oh boy, shall we kiss you\ngoodbye you know. God knows what is what it is that she wants to do. I walked into the that\nlittle office and there was this Irma Grese standing 1n civilian clothes and I must tell you she\nlooked like a vision out of another world. She was wearing a yellow coat. Her hair was\nblonde and usually she was it was always very tightly pulled back. Her hair was long, let\nloose. She wore perhaps a little lipstick - I don't remember. But she was wearing a yellow\ncoat and she smiled at me. Imagine! I was frightened to death, and she looked at me and she\nsaid, I'll never forget that conversation - you know, I have forgotten a great deal purposefully\nbecause you can't live with all the memories, but there are some things that kind of stand out\n- and she said uh, come her, come here. She took my little cheek and she said, ah ha. She\nsaid they tell me that you look a lot like I, and I wanted to be sure that was really true. And I\nin my total natvest said, oh I said, I don't think there's any, I've never seen anyone more\nbeautiful, and I meant it. I mean she was like a vision. You know, you have to understand we\nhaven't seen anything like that. The woman took a liking to me. Thank God she never did\nabuse me, but she made me stand guard in front of the barracks while she would make love\nto the most beautiful Jewish girls there. She also gave me an extra piece of salami and made\nme uh do her boots or something like that. In other words, she sort of took a slight liking. I\nthen found out to my horror when I was already in London and bought the book called \"The\nBelsen Trials,\" which is really the Auschwitz trials, Kramer and Hoess, that she was one of\nthe five people who were actually executed for her crimes. She was twenty-three years old.",
        "A: Oh no, she was (or did yu know\u2019) she was more, yes, I don't know whether SS - I don't know\n- she probably were. This was a, the concentration camp guards, such as Grese and a\ncommandant like uh Kramer (ph), they were of a different breed of people. They looked\nhuman, but these were not human beings. They, you, people, humanity as we know it, even\nin the worst possible way, cannot behave that way. There's a predisposition, there's a pre-\nelection to the kind of evil. They must have been chosen for the very fundamental and the\nmental qualities that these people possessed to be able to perform and do what these people\ndid, because \"normal\", quote and unquote, people who are, who have sensitivities and uh and\nhuman qualities per se in the smallest quality cannot possibly behave in that manner. She\nwas one of the those. Now she could be perfectly lovely. She was nice to me. But it may\nhave been a little toy to her. I mean you know, that I didn't have a relationship with her. Uh\nshe was in charge of Lager C. She was, she had total power. She could do anything she\nwanted to anybody at anytime because she was the, I forget the German word, ober...\nsomething or other. Head, head guard person, and that's all documented, and I as I said I\nbought the \"The Trials\" after the war when I was in London and read it studiously in horror -\nto read my own my own history so to speak, because I lived in a in a little vacuum, not really\nknowing that in another camp other things were happening.",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "A: You mean as far as I was concerned. Well I was told that she that she was a lesbian. I did not\nknow in those days what that meant. And that she was making love to another woman and\nwould I stay guard to see that maybe other Germans would be coming or other guards of her\ncaliber would be coming along and she wanted to be alerted. That's what it meant. Not all the\ntime - sometimes.",
        "A: That I don't know, but she injured and killed an awful lot of women period. She had close to\n- I mean thousands of people that she had tortured, but I don't know whether that was done\nduring her uh tryst or not. I doubt it but I don't know. That I can't I can't tell.",
        "A: Yes. Yes I can. When we would have what the called the Zel (ph) appell, that means that in\nthe morning the roll call would take place, and because I was (ph), that means that I\nwould be there to deliver messages to the central off...to the central block, to the\ncommandment, or to anybody and bring it back to the people in the camp. Uh she would\nmake us stand for hours at a time in freezing horrible weather or very hot, depending __ I\nwas one of the - I still don't understand - I was there for two years. Uh I have told people\nwhen the they used to ask me what my educational background 1s, I said I have a Ph.D. from\nAuschwitz. That covers a lot of ground doesn't it. Not really. The world really doesn't, the\nworld is not really that interested from the human end. There are always those who are. The\nmajority still have really no idea what happened. It's too painful to grasp and they can't be\nbothered. But Irma Grese would let us stand for hours. People would faint. She would trod\non them. She would beat them. She would sick her dog. She would punish people very\nbadly. She was very cruel. She was extremely cruel. They did not execute, Nuremberg did\nnot execute many people. A great many people were put into many different sentences,\nprison sentences, but they executed her, so they must have had far more evidence than I'm\ngiving you here today, documented but from my own personal experience that is precisely\nmy recollection, except that she was, I didn't realize that she was twenty-three. I don't know.\nAge at that point didn't really mean terribly much, but she was twenty-three years old which\nseems pretty extraordinary to have reached the power of such depth of degradation at such\nan early age and so she was executed Nuremberg. Yes.",
        "A: Yes. What was so striking and in fact everything that I'm saying to you today is sort of in\nretrospect how weird those events were. Mengele never raised his voice. He would simply\nstand there with this finger, and this meant one thing and this meant another thing, and he\nsays, you know you've really lived long enough. I think its time to go on. In that kind of a\nmanner. I never heard him raise his voice. He didn't have to. He relished and enjoyed every\nmoment of his glorious power. So you see, when you think of Mengele, which 1s\nunbelievable, this is a monster. This 1s a medical doctor. When you think of Kline (ph), when\nyu think of the great minds in a sense, educated people, the crematoria as I've mentioned in\nsome of my speeches when I, the few times that I do speak subjectively, and this is one of\nthe few times that I do, the crematoria were built, were designed and built not by idiots, not\nby people who didn't know what they were doing. But by highly educated, trained Ph.D.'s\nwho knew exactly what they were doing. And they designed that whole \"Dant'es Inferno\" -\nyou know, there's a line in \"Dante's Inferno\" that says Lachate Oni Speranze Voiche (ph),\nthat means abandon hope all ye who enter here. Now when Dante wrote this in his inferno,\nhe must have been thinking about Auschwitz or places like Auschwitz. Or people like\nMengele or like Kramer, like Hoess, like Grese and like so many other whose names I don't\nexactly remember - we were not formally introduced. The other thing about Auschwitz that I\nremember that helped me is to have a sense of humor. Some people say how can you do\nthat? If you cannot laugh at yourself, you die. By the way, that's true of today too. People\nwho take themselves very seriously are bores (ph), but when you have to, when you do not\nhave a sense of humor during that time, and you really recognize the depth of the tragedy\naround you, you can't make it. You see the mind can still function. It can overcome all kinds\nof extraordinary circumstances. So say, he, I'll see you tomorrow on the soap board.\nAnd that sounds horrible doesn't it? But the truth is that as you know, they would make all\nkinds of, I mean the Germans, the Nazis I should say, were very cleaver as to what they were\ndoing. They wast...wasted nothing. Everything was a must for fortunes of war, and the fat\nwould be used for certain productions including soap. Now it sounds horrible today. It\nsounds depraved. But at that time it was a way of saying we know what's going to go on.\nThere's nothing we can do about it. So let's laugh.",
        "A: Good. I need a break.\nTape #2\n(Tape snag - technical conversation)",
        "A: Yes. Well I was first in the Jewish hospital. Well, I, the hos...the word hospital 1s incorrect.\nIt's fallacious. There were no hospitals. There was a block where you went if you were sick\nand if you were Jewish which that means you never came out of there. Martha worked with\nthe doctors because she was a nurse and somehow she was able to man...to get medicine,\ninjections which she uh was able to administer to me which kept me alive. Uh the Christian\ninmates 1n the in the Christian hospital were allowed to get packages from home and would\nshare some of the goodies from home with me because I was the child you see. I was that\nlittle girls. Uh and then on a few occasions Martha actually was able with the help of\nsomeone else to remove the number that was written down for me to go pastures 1s the only\nway you can put it. Uh something that the normal mind and I say, when I say normal mind I\nmean people who thank goodness, thank God have not experienced my adolescent years,\nwould find it extremely difficult to grasp. Maybe people who were in Viet Nam might to\nsome extent understand that when you walked out in the morning for the roll call, you would\nliterally see hundreds of emaciated bodies still warm, piled up in front of the barracks, and\nyou didn't cry. That was it. It was like you are in hell, and that's part of hell. When I think\nabout it today I said how is it possible. It's beyond me. It is a question, when people say how\ndid you survive, I haven't got the foggiest idea. There is no earthly reason in the world why I\nwas chosen to talk to you today. I don't know. Maybe there is some plan that the heavens,\nGod, whatever, that I'm here. Maybe to bear witness, and that is why I have set my own\nfeelings aside, which 1s not easy, to uh to share with you some of my own remembrances so\nthat perhaps those, the people or the children or whoever is going to perhaps hear what I\nhave to say today, will recognize that the madness that 1s in our society today Neo-Nazis\nwho say that the Holocaust never happened, that this is the pure imagination of the Jewish\ncommunity, will know that uh theirs is a dangerous pack, and the Holocaust did not only\nhappen but it's a very living reality.",
        "A: The only way I can describe Auschwitz is it wa the de...de...de...deepest dissension of what\nwe considered in our wildest imagination, for hell to be. Auschwitz was the final the final\napocalypse. It cannot be described really. Even I who was there for twenty-four months,\nhave difficulty, and I'm sure that I have deliberately forgotten quite a great deal. I don't think\nI could function as a as a human being and be as an accomplished in many way and continue\non with life if I had to live and remember what happened to me there. And I think again here\nthe mind works some miracles. It was, you remember what 1s essential, but you sort of forget\nall the other - it's like having a baby - you remember the beauty but you don't remember the\npain, because other wise no woman would ever have a baby. Uh and Auschwitz was\nsomething, it was the cradle of death. It gave people who were deranged the absolute perfect\nopportunity to exercise their wildest macabre behavior.",
        "A: Actually I didn't leave Auschwitz. I was evacuated. I was there until the last bitter moment,\nexcuse me (cough). Before I answer you that question I just want to say something which I\nfind very important. Yes, there were many other people in Auschwitz, Christians, political\nprisoners, uh prostitutes, homosexuals, uh murderers, but I want people to understand one\nvery important thing - it was primarily an extermination camp of the Jews of Europe.\nBecause the Christian inmates were not subjected to the same treatment. They were not\nsubjected to uh to crematoria. If they \"sinned\" (quote, unquote) according to them, they were\nhanged. I don't know that there were any selections for the Christians. They were there were\nany selections for the Christians. They were there as criminals and treated as such as though\nit was a prison. A terrible prison for them. But Auschwitz and the concentration camps of\nEurope were made for one reason and one reason alone and that is to - I don't want to use\nexterminate - it was, you exterminate cock roaches - for the murder of Jews. And six million\ndied, not just in Auschwitz - in others. I think that's very important to understand. (Thank\nyou.) And I have primarily spoken to Christian groups in my short few years that I have\ndecided that I had a responsibility. I wanted to speak to the Christian community, to make\nthem understand that. Now, I left, or I would say I didn't leave - I was evacuated from\nAuschwitz on January 24th, - I came to Auschwitz, excuse me, I came to Auschwitz on\nJanuary 24th, 1941, and evacuated on January 18th, 1945. That was another terrible time.\nWe actually went through Berlin and saw a leveled city. By that time I spoke fluent German,\nfluent -you see I did go to school there - fluent German, fluent Hungarian, fluent\nCzechoslovakian, and fluent Italian I mean - there were so many people from all over the\nworld, and I wound up in a dreadful place called Ravensbruck.",
        "A: By train, I don't know how many days it took but counting was not one of those things that\nwe did there. It was by that time the end of January, maybe two weeks later, maybe ten days\nafter - I really don't know, but it was in January. Ravensbruck was built for x amount, like\nmaybe thirty-five hundred people, and at that time we were there were something like fifteen\nthousand people. It was dreadful, horrible, and extraordinarily - I met Martha there, and she\nsaid to me at that time, if anything happens and either one of us is alive, I want you to meet\nme in such and such a city after the war. And she's still alive. She's in Brazil, and I went to\nsee her in Brazil. She's quite ill. She has never recovered from Auschwitz. I guess she must\nbe about seventy-five now perhaps - I don't really know. Uh but anyway after Ravensbruck\nof which I have a blur because it was terrible, and like typical Martha, she shared her slice of\nbread with me and still reprimanded me because I, I mean she sort of imagined herself that I\nwas her little girl, and then...",
        "A: I would say about three weeks.",
        "A: Masses of people, death, terrible starvation, no work. We didn't work there. It was, there was\nthere was some chaos at that point, and don't forget this is January '45 and I think Auschwitz\nin fact had already been liberated by the Russians, and we were just, kept going on. I can't\ntell you too much about it because as I said I remember being uh praying let's get this out, I\ndon't want to live anymore. I mean, you know, you can't go on like that. I knew there was no\none left as far as my family was concerned. I knew there was no way. Uh I don't know what\nhappened to Martha after that because we were separated. And then again we were put on\ntrains and ridden further into what was still the remaining of the Third Reich. And I wound\nup in a camp called Retzof-am-Richlin (ph), which was apparently not originally a\nconcentration camp. It was a camp that was built for the men or the women who worked\nadjoining uh there was a very large factory where they I was told they manufacture the uh\nthe missiles that eventually devastated London, and so that it was a much more relaxed\ncamp. There were no crematoria. Uh it was already confusion. I mean this was already like\nyou know beginning of February, end of January, February, March, April - I was there\nactually until, perhaps I was in Ravensbruck longer than that because I think I was in Retzof\nfor about three and a half months.",
        "A: I don't remember. It was not the same procedure that was both either at Auschwitz or\nRavensbruck. Uh we were brought on trucks 1n fact, not on a train, to my knowledge. We\nwere on trucks and we were quite sure they were going to shoot us because Retzof is\nsurrounded by many woods. Uh what struck me about that camp was that it was relatively\nnice, meaning that it was not, the barracks were different. They were much more, they were\nmuch bigger. Uh it was smaller. There may have been maybe two thousand, twenty-five\nhundred people, mainly women. I don't remember seeing men there. It was much looser in\ndiscipline.",
        "A: How do you mean?",
        "A: It meant that uh they'd fill up, the behavior of the guards was not as obnoxious and as scary.\nThey were primarily men, German soldiers, rather than women. Women could be terrible, by\nthe way. The women in Auschwitz were horrendous, the German women. There were to my\nrecollection no women. There was a women's camp, but there were mainly men who were\nthe guards. The commandant was not as scary as I remember say Hoess Ora Kramer. The\nmajority of the pe...the workforce, we worked in the woods where we would uh chop wood\nfor the war production because again this was around the woods and we never felt by the\nway that we would get out of there. Never. We were quite sure that we were going to be\nshot, that they could not let, not everyone had a number - not that many were out of\nAuschwitz, but some of us were. In fact the majority really. There really are not that many\nwho have that kind of a number as I do because uh - don't ask me why. Providence. Je ne\nsais pas. I don't know. So that Retzof particularly after Ravensbruck was heaven. I mean you\ncould, and again they asked me what did I do - I mean what, everybody sort of did\nsomething if you survived that long, my God, you know, what did you do? Said I was a\nloifering (ph). Oh good, we need a loifering (ph) here. So immediately they gave me that\nbandanna with the gothic letters and I became a loifering (ph). That means that I could go to\nthe kitchen and sometimes they, the German woman in charge would throw me an extra\npiece of bread. I didn't need very much in those days. I think that may have also, I really\nthink that may have contributed somewhat to my survival. As a child I didn't need much\nfood. I didn't, I did not eat very much there, and so much so that when I eventually came to\nthis country and my aunt was very concerned because I could go three days without eating,\nand she took me to the Valley Hospital for some tests. They found that my stomach had\nshrunk very considerably. I simply was not accustomed to sitting down and eating a normal\nmeal. I still can't do seven courses in on in one evening. I have tried to justified, to justify\nwhy I and why not somebody else, and it's not the guilt in me. It's the questioning, why, and I\nhave no idea. I don't know. It is absolutely against all odds.",
        "A: Primarily I was a loifering which means that I stood in front, inside the gates of the camp,\nand be ready to be at any body's beck and call from the main Block Fuhrerstube (ph) or the\nguards who needed something, or bring their supper or whatever. And then I worked for a\nwhile in the woods with the other kommando chopping woods which was a little heavy\nwork, and that's basically what was going on there. There was, there were other things there.\nThere were mis...uh seamstress who were doing some clothes correction I remember. As I\nsaid this camp had different things but you have to understand again, I wish I could be more\ndescriptive to you as to what, how and when, but I really can't because I can only tell you\nfrom my memory what I did when. I really don't know - there were so many other aspects.\nAnd we didn't exactly share the information on what was going on five blocks away, so that\na great deal of my information about, not about my own subjective experience, but about the\nentire tragedy of the catastrophe I learned by reading about other peoples' accounts and by\nreading historical and documentation of that nature.",
        "A: Yes, It does. In fact, what stands out in my memory even in Auschwitz, was that humanity\nwas not lost among the among the survivors, among - I shouldn't say survivors, among the\ninmates. People did care for each other. People did give each other moral support. People did\ncommensurate with each other and tried to help. There was very little because people were\ndying and the suffering was so intense that it was very difficult to give strength to someone\nelse, but Martha is a perfect example. There were a few others who extended a helping hand.\nBut the one incident that comes about me 1s a very unusual one. and a very far-out sort of an\nincident because it came from a German soldier in Retzof-am-Richlin. There was a young\nnineteen year old guard who very shortly after I arrived there, started look at me very\ndifferently, and I didn't know why. He, eventually we spoke, we met. He was actually from\nLuxembourg. He was a medical student. He was brought in there. He said to me, what are\nyou doing here, the first time I saw him. He was a guard standing on this scaffold with a gun,\nand I was down here standing and he started to sing me a little, a little German song. And I\nthought boy, this guy has a real sense of humor, you know. And he said listen, what are you\ngoing here? And he didn't say it in an angry way. And I thought to myself, he's crazy. I said,\nwell, I am Jewish. And he apologized and he said, he was obviously very green. He didn't\nrealize it. He said look, I knew what was going to the, I knew what was going on in Germany\nwith the Jewish community, but I am, I was a medical student until just a few months ago,\nand I had no idea to what extent the brutality went on. I am only now learning from the older\nguards who talk about it with relish, and I go out and I vomit. This young nineteen year old\nmedical student, SS guard because they needed new people to they brought anyone in,\nRumanians, Bulgarians, eventually within a few months, was willing to risk his life by\nsaying to me, you are not going to survive because they will kill you. This, the rumor goes\naround that they will shoot everybody here. They can't, they don't want to whatever is left,\nthey can't let, leave that much evidence. I have contacted a woman in the village who lost her\nhusband and two sons and is very bitter, told her about you. She says she will give me\ncivilian clothes and I will take you there when there is a break. I promise you. And I said\nwhy are you doing it. He said because I love you. Now you have to understand that here was\na Jewish girl, sixteen years old, speaking to a German, to a man wearing a German uniform\nsaying I love you and I'm not going to let you die. I'm going to help you. I said we can both\nhang for it. Don't say a word to anyone. It's a long story which I will not go into now, but I\nwas Very...",
        "A: Well he was very, well, he was very, he was incredibly tender. He asked me to join the\nkommando because he wanted to tell me more about it and the he says, speak to the\ncommandant. Everybody eventually winds up going to the woods and working there, and\nhe'll let you, which I did. I was scared to death, but the commandant knew me and he said\nOK. You can rotate with other girls. As I said, this was a little more human. You simply\ndidn't go to a commandant and stay, do you mind if I go work some place else. This is just\nnot the way it was. And Lucien had all the plans. He was incredibly tender. He was\nincredibly beautiful, and I said what is going on with me. What is happening here? How, you\nmean there is still a heart beating under somebody who is wearing a German uniform? Here\nwas a Christian boy and a Jewish girl caught up in hell, and this, and I must admit I didn't\nknow, I mean I knew that nature was beginning to play havoc with me, but I didn't know\nwhat the word love is or anything. I mean I didn't know that one does, that there are normal\nemotions which nature was letting me know were happening. One night he said, very\nabruptly and very angrily, while he was there, he says I want my supper in my in my Block\nFuhrerstobe tonight. Bring it to me. So I brought the tray, and I knew there was something\nwrong, and I walked into the Block Fuhrerstobe. There was bedlam there. This was already\nApril - I don't know maybe April 20th, maybe April 25th. And uh I opened the door and\nthere he was standing without a gun and without a tie, the white shirt opened slightly,\nwithout his cap and I knew something was terribly wrong. He said put down the tray. He\nsaid we've just got we've just got word that we have to evacuate like immediately. Tomorrow\nmorning. I cannot help you. I cannot bring you out of here. But I pray to God that you're\ngoing to live, because I'm going to find you. And he gave me a magnificent poem and a\nphotograph of himself in civilian clothes. It was the most bizarre thing - it was like a like a\nlike icing on a on a cake of some kind that was just, what's going on here. Well, to cut a long\nstory short, we were evacuated, and then I found out that he was killed in action on the\nRussian front. But he made an impact on me. He made an enormous impact on me because\nhe, people say to me, I have been asked, do you hate the Germans? No. I don't like to hate\nanybody. I hate the Nazis. I hate the people who have perpetrated that disaster on people. But\nyou cannot simply say everybody is rotten. No. They're not. People are people. There are\nrotten people everywhere. But this incident, having just spent forty-five months in camps and\nghettos, to have a, somebody in a German uniform with a gun supposedly guarding me say\nto me I'm going to risk my life for you. I'm going to let you escape ____ (ph) will kill you.\nAnd I may be killed with it but I love you, was an inkling that maybe there 1s after all\nanother world of which I knew nothing about.",
        "A: We were evacuated in the middle of the night, just as Lucien had predicted, and we were\nquite sure that we were going to be killed. And we were not put on trucks. We were walking.\nNo idea where we were walking. That was May the 2nd. Mind you I'm really coming to the\nend of the war. Everything, or at this point here, Germany was combined of a tiny little spot\nwhere the Americans and the English and the Russians and the French on all sides. They\nkept going with us. Of course, they the guards were much more relaxed. They knew that this\nis the end. There was just no way, but they kept walking us, for week...for what seemed like\nendless...a lot of people couldn't make it and want by the wayside. In fact that's when I asked\none of the older guards, I said by the way, you know that young fellow, Lucien, who was at\nthe gate, whatever happened to him? And he looked at me. He said, ah Buby (ph), we got\nword that he was killed in uh at the Russian front two weeks ago. Well I thought, I'm the\none, he didn't feel anything, I did. We went on and on and on finally we couldn't really walk\nanymore and this was already like May the 4th and I say May the 4th, because May the Sth I\nwas liberated, so I knew that it had to be. We hi...there was a terrible bombardment. I mean\nwe heard and we _____ to see planes, hear the Americans...what I don't know whether\nthey were American but they were certainly Al...uh Allied planes and tremendous uh fires\nfrom tanks and stuff, and we hid during one of those terrible raids in a bunker and never\nwent out. Nobody looked for us anymore. And that was it. The next day, we slept in a, that\nnight we slept in a barn we found with the cows and the pigs on the bottom, and the next\nmorning very early - the sun was still shining - I liked through a crack and I saw a Russian\nsoldier. And I jumped out, woke everybody - there were about twelve of us out of the girls\nwho were with me or I was with - and he must have thought I came from another world.\nWell, I did. I did. And I spoke fluent Russian, so I recognized, and I'm very sorry to tell you\nthat eventually when we went to another town, we wanted to be repatriated so that we could\nfind out, because we were completely isolated - this is now East Germany - the Russian\ncommandant, who whoever he was, who was repatriated, and I mean people had no idea yet\nwhat was going on. People did not digest the horror. Maybe the Russians did because of uh\nbecause they liberated Auschwitz, but the generally speaking the May the 5th was not yet a\nday that people knew what was going on, even Dachau which was liberated by the by the by\nthe Americans, and Buchenwald and all that, the general public so to speak didn't yet know\nincluding some of the Russians, and uh he says you mean to tell me that there are some Jews\nstill left through all that. But he said it in a way and I thought here I was in all the Pioneer as\na child you know, being taught about the greatness of Russia - I believed that garbage - and\nhere is somebody throwing that anti-Semitic remark to me right back in my face when I\nhaven't even gotten out from the stained, blood-stained clothing. That was quite an\nawakening to me. That was an I was jolted into another kind of reality from which I never\nquite recovered meaning that, and this is why I have contributed some of my time - what had\nhappened then can happen again. And unless you and I, people like you and many like you\nand the Holocaust Memorial Committee and the Museum, do not keep an absolutely alert\nvigilant eye, we may all be in trouble again, and it may not necessarily be the Jew. It can be\nanybody who has green eyes and dark hair. Anything can happen. I hope I have answered\nsome of the questions you wanted.",
        "A: Very briefly, I will try to do it, but as briefly as I can, because I want I was in the I was first\nin the repatriation camp in Germany. Uh since Martha told me to meet her in a place called\n_ilina which is Slovakia, not Czechoslovakia but Slovakia, and I spoke fluent Slovakian and\nfluent uh fluent Hungarian which everyone apparently does there, and I knew that I had\nabsolutely no one left in Grodno and I mean there was nothing to go back to - I had been\ncompletely alone. That was a reality that hit me very quickly 1n the face. Now what? Uh, I\ntold them that I was born in _ilina, and that I was going to Czechoslovakia. The only trouble\nI had to convince them is that I really was sixteen, because I looked like ten, and they were\ngoing to put me with the orphans uh program and I didn't want to be with the children's\nprogram. I wanted to go on my own. And so I convinced them and told them I was two years\nolder than I really was, which they didn't really believe me, but somehow I managed. Uh and\nI went to Prague. That's another story, not for today - that's quite an incredible story all by\nitself...",
        "A: Encapsulated is that I was supposed to, I came, I went on a four-day bus from Breslau (ph) to\nPrague and most of the people on that bus were people... (phrase missing)\nTape #3\n..and completely alone in this world. That hit me as if to say, now what. But I didn't, I mean\nif you go through an experience like Auschwitz you sort of don't become philosophical and\nsay well now what. And I was determined to go to _ilina and I was given, I had no money of\ncourse - they gave us a ticket. They told us where to go. Said get a ticket - you don't have to\npay for it, and then you will sleep at the Jan Maszaryk House, so I went to the thing and I got\na ticket but on the way back I didn't know who Jan Maszaryk was and I forgot where I was\nsupposed to be and I couldn't remember the name of the house. So I sat down and ____(ph)\nwhere all that stuff was just going on there, and I sat down on a bench and I said OK, I will\nsleep here tonight. It was a lovely night, it was July. Had a little tiny white sweater and a\nlittle tiny bag like that - that was my whole belongings. And I said I'll wait here until\ntomorrow. I didn't know what I was supposed to do. I was alone but a young man comes up\nand sits next to me - starts talking to me in German. My German was very good at the time.\nHe says what are you doing here, and I explained the story. Her says well do you know your\nfriend is in_ilina? No. Do you have any relatives? I have an aunt in New York. Well, I could\nhelp you maybe write to her or do something, but I can't help you if you are there. Why don't\nyou let met help you? OK. It was like (snap fingers) - life and death decisions made at the\nspur of the moment. He could have raped me, he could have done anything, right? Took me\nto a Catholic convent and I stayed there for three months, and his father worked for a rather\nfamous typewriter company called Schvetka, and I worked - he got me a job there and I\nlearned Czechoslovakian, not Slovakian - I spoke Slovakian you know - within a very short\ntime I was earning a little money and living 1n a in the convent, and he was quite a\nremarkable man, and I have just given you a little tiny medallion which he gave me at that\ntime. And eventually uh the American Joint Distribution Committee found me, through my\naunt I suppose. I wrote by the way - that might interest you - I wrote five letters in Russian,\nidentical letters to my aunt, and I wrote on each letter on the bottom, if you should get all of\nthese letters, please don't think I've lost my mind. I'm fine. I'm giving it to an American\nsoldier, and I don't know which one of them will forward directly to you, and she got all five,\nand she said thank God you wrote that because I would have said poor child is really not\nright. Then I went to London, and instead of being...",
        "A: Through the American Joint Distribution Committee the with the with the orphans uh\nprogram, and I uh instead of spending a year in London or six months which they told me\nyou don't know English - I think it's a good idea that yu go there before you go to the States\nbecause you're under Polish visa or quota uh, why don't you go to London and you can at\nleast learn a little bit of English. And I said well, very well and I knew three words in\nEnglish at that time, thank you and peace. And it turned out to e four years. And I loved it.\nUh and so I came from Breslau to Prague, from Prague to London, from London to New\nYork, etc. etc. and now I'm in Washington.",
        "A: Yes, I would like to add by saying that the archives that are being collected and documented\nfor posterity, articles, video-taping, lectures, books, are of unbelievable importance. Not, the\nHolocaust you see I never looked at the at the Jewish issue - it's not. It's an universal issue\nthat affects each and every one of us and the more the American public, the European\npeople, anyone, the Arab world, the black community, the children who feel very slighted\nfor many good reasons, understand the historical, the soci...sociological, the philosophical\naspect of the Holocaust, the better off we all are because this is the greatest lesson that we\ncan learn about humanity in any form or shape that you want. And I think that this kind of a\npreservation of history, not those that are that write their own to change their own times, 1s\nwhat might save the world so that we do not repeat that. Because history has an ugly way of\nrepeating itself and we cannot allow that to happen.",
