So she came to Filson Fairbourg too.\nHow do I know this? Cause I have old pictures, you know. We\u2019re all there. And we stayed there\nfor quite a while. And \u2014",

        "Q: So you stayed there?",
        "A: We stayed there. Then of course my father was the youngest child in the Racimora family.\nBefore the war, his older sister, Ruth, married an older man and she left for the United States. So\nshe wasn\u2019t even involved in the Holocaust. She had a b \u2014 my father had a brother Morris and he\ndecided, he married in Poland. And he took his wife and they went to Belgium. He settled in\nBelgium. Then he had another sister, Rivka. Rivka married a young man and they made Aliyah.\nThey went to Israel. And they settled in Israel.\nMy father was the only one left from the Holocaust. My aunt Ruth who lived in the United States\ncalled Poland and she said to her father, dad why don\u2019t you come to the United States. It\u2019s very\nnice. Well my grandfather had a beard. He was an orthodox Jew and everything else. You\nknow, he was very pious and Ruth invited Grandpa to stay with her. So he came to the United\nStates and he stayed here. He didn\u2019t like the United States. However, he changed his whole\nimage. He shaved his beard. He came back to Poland just with a little moustache. I have a\npicture of it. And he came back to Poland. Had he been wise enough, he would have said\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013\nkindellach, we\u2019re going to the United States. They were very comfortable. This was their home,\nPoland. And they figured no one is going to touch them. So he came back to Poland and of\ncourse we were all involved in the Holocaust. You know. My father\u2019s father perished and his\nmother Chaya perished. I don\u2019t know what happened to them exactly but they did not survive.\nMy grandfather, my mother\u2019s father survived. His wife, Deborah, did not survive. Shmulek of\ncourse did not survive, as I told you. And my mother\u2019s youngest sister did not survive.",
        "Q: So now you\u2019re all together in Germany.",
        "A: In Germany. And we all well and everything else. His brother, Morris, contacts him. He\nlives in Belgium. He was in the pocketbook business there. Very prosperous, in Brussels.

        "Q: You have good memories of that?",
        "A: Yes, that I do, yeah that Ido. And we stayed in Belgium for two years.",
        "Q: Now you still had the tattoo on your arm? At that point?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013",
        "A: [ll tell you later on what happened to that. Rivka calls Morris and she says what do you\nmean, keeping Leon in Belgium? I want to see him. So of course speaks to my father. And my\nfather was like the wandering Jew. He wanted to see his whole family. So Rivka said, Leon you\nsurvived. You come to Israel. (pause)\nSo we picked up again and we went to Israel.",
        "Q: This is when?",
        "A: This must have been after Israel became a state.",
        "Q: After 48?",
        "A: Yes, after 48. And we lived with Rivka for quite a while. She had a nice house.",
        "Q: Where in Israel?",
        "A: In Tel Aviv. Tel Aviv. And the government at that time was building a Shikun, you know\nwhat a shikun 1s?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Ok. For survivors of the Holocaust. So we lived with Aunt Rivka for quite a while until the\nshikun was ready. The shikun was built in Giv\u2019At Rambam which 1s just the outskirts of Tel\nAviv. Once it was ready, we moved to Giv\u2019At Rambam.",
        "Q: You had to learn Hebrew?",
        "A: Yes, so now I\u2019ve switched. No so now I spoke Polish. I spoke Yiddish. I spoke French. From\nBelgium. Fluent in French. So my father says you know there\u2019s a, there\u2019s a school in Yafa, the\noutskirts of Tel Aviv. I want Sarah to go and not to forget French. It\u2019s a nice language you know.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013\nIt sounds good and everything else. Rivka was very angry and she says well what do you mean.\nYou're in Israel. She\u2019s got to speak Hebrew. So my father let 1t go. He didn\u2019t push it and I got\ninvolved in school and I went to school in Israel. We lived in Israel for five years and I spoke\nHebrew fluently. So I spoke Yiddish, I still spoke Polish. I still remember that. French, I started\nto forget and of course Hebrew you know. Well things were changing in the United States at that\ntime, under Roosevelt.",
        "Q: This is in the 50s.",
        "A: Yes. First he did not allow the people from Poland to come in. There was a quota. It\u2019s not\nlike now. Anyone can come in. And we had to wait. One year Rivka calls us to Belgium and\nshe says, no, no. To Israel, I\u2019m sorry. To Israel and she says things have changed in the United\nStates. The Polish quota was lifted. I\u2019m coming to tell you all about it Leon. So Ruth took a trip\nto Israel, her first trip. And we sat down and she told us that now you can come to the United\nStates, as long as you have a sponsor. And she said to my father, I\u2019m going to be your sponsor.\nSo when you come to the United States, Ill take care of you Leon. Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll move in\nwith me. My aunt lived in the Bronx. On Walton Avenue, beautiful building and one bedroom\napartment. She says you\u2019ll move in with me. We moved in. So we moved with \u2014",
        "Q: So you left Israel. How did you feel about leaving Israel?",
        "A: Leaving Israel. I liked Israel. That was my best memories of my life. I was sad to leave\nIsrael. By then I was already bat mitzvah. I had my bat mitzvah in Israel and by then I was I\nthink 13, 13 years old. And we left Israel.",

        "A: My father was busy earning a living and we just didn\u2019t have time to dwell on it. You know.",
        "Q: So you were moving on \u2014",
        "A: On with your life.",
        "Q: So now you leave Israel. You come to the United States and live with your aunt.",
        "A: Right. We lived with my aunt for a year and my mother\u2019s sister Tove, had a wonderful\nposition with a garment what do you call it. Factory. Her husband that she married was, had an\nuncle in the AFL and he was prominent to get him a job there and my aunt got a job in the\ngarment district. Became very well known. She traveled all for the country, the United States to\nsee what the factories were manufacturing and she was in charge. At that time my mother was a\nterrific seamstress and she said Stella do you want a job. And my mother said yes. What am I\ngoing to do? I\u2019m going to sit around here? So she got her a job and she became the sample maker\nthere. They manufactured robes and then they went into the dress business. So my mother\nalways made the sample dress. From the sample dress, my mother had to supervise the people in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013\nthe factory in Manhattan to make sure that the product that they made was equivalent to her\nsample and so she was in charge of that.",
        "Q: And where did you go to school?",
        "A: In New York, I went to the public school. Public school yeah.",
        "Q: What was that like?",

        "Q: Were there other refugee children your class?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: You were the only one?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did the kids ask about your experiences?",
        "A: This is what I want to tell you. I was in public school in the Bronx. One of 35 kids in a\nclassroom. I\u2019m a teacher so that I can tell you from the educational point of view it wasn\u2019t a\nkind of educational situation for a child that just came out of the Holocaust. I had a number on\nmy hand. In those days in New York they never taught the Holocaust. It wasn\u2019t mandated like in\nthe state of New Jersey. And the kids looked at the number. And they said Sarah what\u2019s that\nnumber on your hand. And I said well let me tell you I was in the Holocaust in Germany. And\nthe Germans put this number on me. I wasn\u2019t Sarah Racimora. I was this number. That\u2019s how\nthey referred to me. You talking crazy. There was no such thing as the Holocaust. New York\nnever taught the Holocaust. This was 1954. Those kids were never educated, never heard the\nword Holo \u2014 what\u2019s Holocaust. Well I didn\u2019t like to talk about it. And I went to my parents and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013\nI said you know what, I have to have this number removed. Because I am just too inundated\nwith questions that I cannot answer. So we went to Montefiore hospital. They got a surgeon and\nunfortunately the surgeon got sick and they brought someone else. Did a lousy job of this. This\nshould have been just a thin strip. And that\u2019s why I have a scar here. I had it removed. I felt\nbetter because the kids stopped talking about it. I went to my education in New York, finished\nhigh school and then I met my husband.\nHow did I meet my husband? I went to Moodus, Connecticut. Did you ever hear of that place?\nIt was a place where young people were able to meet young Jewish young men. And I went with\na friend of mine. I took courses at Hunter College. And then we went for a week to Moodus,\nConnecticut to meet some guys. We got there and we didn\u2019t meet anyone the whole week. And\nthen I said, Sunday we were supposed to leave. We had a cab take us there. So I said to my\nfriend, Brenda, I said you know I\u2019m hungry. Let\u2019s go to the dining room. I feel like a salami\nsandwich. So we went down and I stood on line and this, there was a young man there. He says\nhi, how are you? What are you ordering? I said a salami sandwich. He says me too. He says I\u2019m\nhere with my friends. He came with four or five of his friends from New Jersey. They were\nready to meet young people. He says why don\u2019t you come over to the table and sit with us, get\nyour sandwich. So Brenda and I got a sandwich. We sat down with them. And we got to talking\nand he says, where are you from? You have an accent. I said well I\u2019m from Israel. He says you\nfrom Israel. He said yes you have an accent. I said well can you understand me. I can still speak\nEnglish. He made a derogatory comment about Israel and I was very angry. I\u2019m a rebel. I\npicked up the bottle of wine and I was ready to with the bottle. My husband Billy, later on we got\nmarried, grabbed my hand and he says put that bottle down. He\u2019s not worth it. Well we sat there\nand spent the evening with his friends. We had a very nice evening. And then the next day we\nwere leaving Moodus, Connecticut. Dana lodge. I don\u2019t think it exists anymore. And Billy says\nyou know what I'll take you home. Where do you live? I said I live in the Bronx right across\nthe street from Yankee stadium. Oh, he says, I know that area, don\u2019t worry. I'll get you home\nsafe. So Brenda took the cab home cause we paid for that and he took me home. And that\u2019s the\nhistory. After that it was a romance. We dated for a year or so. He says you know what I really\nwant you to move to New Jersey. You can continue education. So I switched colleges and I went\nto Newark State, was a teaching college. Now it\u2019s Kean University and I finished my education\nthere, got my degree from, certified in New Jersey, kindergarten through eighth grade. And I got\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013\na position in Scotch Plains Fanwood teaching third grade. I taught there a year, a year and a half,\nI became pregnant with my daughter Debby. So I had to stop teaching. And I said Billy I can\nhave some. There was a very nice woman living next to us 1n the apartment house and she said\nshe was willing to take care of Debby while I went to work. My husband says no one is going to\ntake over my daughter. You stay home. So I had to give up teaching. And I stayed home and I\nraised my daughter. Later on we saved enough money. We lived in the Village for quite a while.\nWe lived there I think ten years. And we bought a house in Livingston, New Jersey, a very\naffluent community, a Jewish community. And we\u2019re there now over 40 years. My daughter\nlives in Renalopin [ph]. She has two children, boys. They are now in college at University of\nIndiana. They both decided to go to the same college. Cody is a senior. Tyler is a freshman. She\njust took off to class. She\u2019s not even home. And my son became a spinal surgeon in Baltimore,\nhas a very nice group of doctors. Does a lot of traveling throughout the world, educating other\ndoctors in orthopedic surgery. He went to China, he went to Japan. He does a lot of traveling.\nAnd he has two children, Katy the little princess. Katy is now 11. Ethan is 13. And they both go\nto private schools because the Baltimore school system is not that great so they\u2019re both in two\ndifferent schools. They\u2019re not in the same school. Katy goes to an all-girls school where my\ndaughter in law graduated from. And Ethan is in a school from, very big school from\nkindergarten through high school. And the whole school, money was donated by Jewish families.\nHow do I know? Every building has a Jewish name. We went to visit the school to see where\nEthan was. They have a very nice life. Now they\u2019re traveling by bikes. They are in Switzerland\nand going through all the other countries, going to be away for two weeks so I won\u2019t see them.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about your story. Do you think about your war time experiences, the\nHolocaust more now that so many years have passed, or do you feel is it less?",
        "A: Absolutely. For a very long time I was busy with my career, raising my kids. And I just put\neverything aside. I didn\u2019t want to think about it. My father brought the video, after he made a\nvideo with Steven Spielberg. He showed it to my children. We spoke about it and whenever dad\ncame to visit me in New Jersey. He lived in New York at that time, my mother had died. He\nremarried a Holocaust survivor, the second wife. And he used to visit so everything else was\nfine. And we didn\u2019t discuss it that much. Years later, recently I picked up and I said I have to do\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013\nsomething about it. And this is why I ended up being a teacher, being involved in teaching about\nthe Holocaust.\nI learned from my father\u2019s video which I know you have a copy of that here, the whole story how\nhe saved me. And this was the basic of my foundation for these PowerPoint sessions. I contacted\nmy good friend, Elizabeth Bess who was the principal at a very prestigious reformed temple and\nwe got together and we wrote this program. And now what we\u2019re doing, we are managing to go\nout and talk about the Holocaust in a very, very educational way. And also in a creative way.\nThe children learn about it. Walking out of one of these sessions that they can go home and say\nto their parents, this is what we\u2019re doing.\nA lot of people in the United States, even though they belong to a synagogue, they\u2019re not that\neducated on the Holocaust. So this is what we\u2019re doing now. That\u2019s why we came out here,\nElizabeth and I to seek more information. We found out a lot of information yesterday as I told\nyou about my family. And we\u2019re rewriting the whole curriculum for the Holocaust. Programs\nthat we\u2019re going to be doing.",
        "Q: Do you think you were at an advantage being so young and not remembering as opposed to if\nyou had been older during the Holocaust?",
        "A: I can\u2019t tell you. It would just be a guess. My whole survival is I use the word when I speak to\nmy students, it was Bashert. A lot of them don\u2019t know the word. It\u2019s a Yiddish word and I said\nI guess I was chosen to survive to tell the story, to come here and teach you about the Holocaust.\nSo you can share it with your parents. Many of these children are not Jewish, where we go. We\ngo to many affluent day schools. Some of them are Jewish, some aren\u2019t. Some don\u2019t know\nanything about the Holocaust. But the main thing that Elizabeth and I see is that we are reaching\nthat population. When they walk out of one of our sessions they say Sarah, we learned so much\ntoday that we didn\u2019t know before. I had them write an evaluation. We went, I don\u2019t know if\nyou\u2019re familiar with the Princeton Day School in New Jersey, very affluent school. My cousin\u2019s\ndaughter teaches there which is a big plus also. She set her class up for us to give our spiel.\nThe kids were mesmerized. They walked out. They wrote evaluation. What did they want to\nknow the most? Tell us more stories about your father. You, exactly what happened.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013\nThey loved the story when he put me in a potato sack and he threw me there. What happened to\nyou? Did you survive? I said I did tell them the story. It was very personal and we are getting\nvery successful with it. We work very hard.",
        "Q: Do you feel that you are two people, one on the outside and one on the inside?",
        "A: You can say that. I would never describe it, but it\u2019s possible, absolutely. I have a lot of\nfeelings that are hidden within me, absolutely.",
        "Q: To the outside world you\u2019re somebody different.",
        "A: Right. A different face.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts, do you remember your thoughts during the Eichmann trial?\nYou were a young adult, do you have any, what your feelings were when Eichmann went on\ntrial?",
        "A: Well I knew when Eichmann went on trial what he did. Exactly. I had very, very good\nfeelings that he was captured to be very honest with you. And I hope that more of those people\nwould be captured and taught a lesson that that should never happen again.",
        "Q: Do you think it could happen again?",
        "A: Absolutely. Betsy and I were just discussing it. Absolutely. With the way the world is now\nanyone can come into the United States. We had to wait til our visas were cleared. We could\nhave been here earlier in the United States. There was a quota. There are no quotas now.\nAnyone can come into the United States unfortunately.",
        "Q: What was it like when you became a citizen?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013",
        "A: It was marvelous. I was a senior in high school. My father made sure that he knew about the\nConstitution. I sat down and I prompt them. My father at that time started to read the New York\nTimes. He went to Taft high school, took some lessons in English with my mother. And we\nwent for our citizen papers five years afterward, very proud.",
        "Q: That specific day do you remember?",
        "A: I was very proud. It was in a big room, somewhere downtown in Manhattan. I don\u2019t\nremember exactly. And it was a big group of people who became citizens. He was very proud.",
        "Q: When your children were your age when they were infants and young children and two years\nold and four years old all the ages that you were when you went through all that terrible time.\nDid that bring up feelings for you of the war time?",
        "A: No, no. I separated myself, psychologically, I was the mother of children born in the United\nStates.",
        "Q: Yeah but I meant for instance when they were two and when they were four you were going\nthrough such terrible times yourself, did that, it did not bring it up?",
        "A: No, I never discussed it with them.",
        "Q: No, I didn\u2019t mean discuss it but did it bring up emotionally you know when I was two, when I\nwas four. This is what happened",
        "A: No, no, no. I just set it aside.",
        "Q: How much did you tell them when they were growing up about your experience?",
        "A: Well it didn\u2019t come to discussing the Holocaust until my father was interviewed by Steven\nSpielberg. And my father came to the house. He still lived in New York and showed my father\u2019s\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013\ninterview and that\u2019s when they really learned. I think at that time I think Debby and Steve and\nthey were maybe fourth or fifth graders. You know, not before that.",
        "Q: Nothing before that, they knew nothing about your life.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Your war time life?",
        "A: No. Well they knew that I was born in Poland. You know and during the war they knew that.\nJust that. They didn\u2019t ask me details. You know then of course as they got older they studied it\nand they knew what was happening. Later on they asked me questions when they got older.",
        "Q: Are there any sights or sounds or smells that bring back memories of the war time?",
        "A: Well [Il tell you the traveling in those cattle cars.",

        "A: Yes, that absolutely.",
        "Q: But are there any sounds today or smells today that trigger that experience?",
        "A: No, not really. No, no. Oh, dogs yes. I am fearful of dogs. Thank you Betsy.",
        "Q: You\u2019re fearful of dogs? Because --",
        "A: Because at times the Germans sometimes walked around with a dog you know in Radom.",
        "Q: And so even today when you see any dog \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013",
        "A: No it\u2019s nothing major you know what I\u2019m saying to you. It\u2019s just that oh, I don\u2019t like dogs.",
        "Q: Do you think you would have been a different person today if you hadn\u2019t had the childhood\nthat you had?",
        "A: Absolutely I\u2019m sure, I\u2019m sure.",
        "Q: In what sense?",
        "A: In what sense? Well I would have been brought up completely differently you know. I\nwouldn\u2019t have missed all those young years. You know that I missed. You know, being fearful,\nremembering that I had to hide under the bed. I wouldn\u2019t experience that. It probably would\nhave been a more positive kind of growing up to be very honest. A happier growing up, not\nbeing fearful what would happen. Not being cautious. It would have been a completely different\nstory, absolutely.",
        "Q: How has this affected you spiritually, religiously?",
        "A: Well religiously once my father made the tape with Steven Spielberg, he came back to\nJudaism. He used to go to shul when he lived in Florida. Every Saturday morning he gathered a\ncouple of his friends. They got in the car. They went to services. Holidays he loved to observe. I\nused to make all the holidays you know and he used to come to my house and we celebrated all\nthe holidays. There was the pinnacle of happiness. He remembered, he used to say, remember\nwhen your grandmother made this, you know. His memories came back. My grandfather the\nsame thing too. I mean Passover was beautiful because my grandfather had a beautiful voice.\nAnd at the end of the Seder we used to sit with the Haggadah and he used to sing the songs. My\nkids still remember that. Debby said to me the other day. I remember when great grandpa was\nsinging all these songs from the Haggadah. He had a beautiful voice. And of course my kids\nwere going to Hebrew school so they joined with him.",

        "A: Yes, absolutely.",
        "Q: Do you feel totally assimilated in the United States?",
        "A: Yes, absolutely. Yes, in a very positive way. I mean we\u2019ve lived in Livingston now for over\n40 years. In a very Jewish community. I know a lot of people. I\u2019ve taught at a lot of temples.\nYou know I\u2019m not only conservative, but reform temples also so I\u2019m very well aware of the\nJewish religious life. We\u2019ve been members of the temple. My kids were bar mitzvahed and bat\nmitzvahed you know at Beth Shalom. My grandchildren, we had them at the bimah many of\nthem, very involved.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about Germany today?",
        "A: That\u2019s very interesting that you ask that. I have very negative feelings against Germany.\nAbsolutely. My grandson Cody was just on a trip this summer in some of the European\ncountries. And what he said to me, grandma I\u2019m going to go to Poland. I want to see Auschwitz.\nHe went to Poland and I haven\u2019t had time to discuss with him because he\u2019s so busy getting ready\nto go back to school. He saw the world, he saw what the world was like. Not like in the United\nStates. Different ways of living. He visited a lot of countries, had a terrific experience through a\nvery nice program that the college ran for students. And he spent I think a month or so in\nEurope. He\u2019s back in school now.

She took all the pictures of our trip to Poland and for my birthday she gave me an\nalbum of all of the pictures.

        "A: Well what happened, my father applied for himself and my mother said she doesn\u2019t want any\nof that dirty money. She said Leon do not fill out the papers for me. She was very, very strict. So\nmy mother never got reparation. My father got reparation and I get reparation.

You know I don\u2019t dwell about the survival to be really honest with you. I couldn\u2019t\nwait to come to Washington to the Holocaust museum.

Grandma it was terrific. I said Katy I want\nyou to know I\u2019m going with my friend to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC.

You were able to come to the Holocaust museum and\ntell your story. I am not that sure that it wouldn\u2019t happen again to be very honest with you. The\nway the world is going now. Unfortunately. I\u2019m very pessimistic to be very honest with you.\nTo see there are no quotas to come into the United States. We had to wait all that time you know\nto come here after the Holocaust. Roosevelt had a quota for, for the Polish quota. There\u2019s no\nquotas. Anyone can come in. The borders are open. All you hear on tv and anywhere that you\ngo, all the atrocities that are happening unfortunately. Every day it\u2019s anew gimmick. Robbing\npeople, killing people.

My aunt Ruth who lived in the United States\ncalled Poland and she said to her father, dad why don\u2019t you come to the United States. It\u2019s very\nnice. Well my grandfather had a beard. He was an orthodox Jew and everything else. You\nknow, he was very pious and Ruth invited Grandpa to stay with her. So he came to the United\nStates and he stayed here. He didn\u2019t like the United States. However, he changed his whole\nimage. He shaved his beard. He came back to Poland just with a little moustache. I have a\npicture of it.

And my\nfather was like the wandering Jew. He wanted to see his whole family. So Rivka said, Leon you\nsurvived. You come to Israel. (pause)\nSo we picked up again and we went to Israel.",

It\u2019s a nice language you know.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013\nIt sounds good and everything else. Rivka was very angry and she says well what do you mean.\nYou're in Israel. She\u2019s got to speak Hebrew. So my father let 1t go. He didn\u2019t push it and I got\ninvolved in school and I went to school in Israel. We lived in Israel for five years and I spoke\nHebrew fluently. So I spoke Yiddish, I still spoke Polish. I still remember that. French, I started\nto forget and of course Hebrew you know. Well things were changing in the United States at that\ntime, under Roosevelt.",
        "A: Yes. First he did not allow the people from Poland to come in. There was a quota. It\u2019s not\nlike now. Anyone can come in. And we had to wait. One year Rivka calls us to Belgium and\nshe says, no, no. To Israel, I\u2019m sorry. To Israel and she says things have changed in the United\nStates. The Polish quota was lifted. I\u2019m coming to tell you all about it Leon. So Ruth took a trip\nto Israel, her first trip. And we sat down and she told us that now you can come to the United\nStates, as long as you have a sponsor. And she said to my father, I\u2019m going to be your sponsor.\nSo when you come to the United States, Ill take care of you Leon. Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll move in\nwith me. My aunt lived in the Bronx. On Walton Avenue, beautiful building and one bedroom\napartment. She says you\u2019ll move in with me. We moved in. So we moved with \u2014",
        "A: Leaving Israel. I liked Israel. That was my best memories of my life. I was sad to leave\nIsrael. By then I was already bat mitzvah. I had my bat mitzvah in Israel and by then I was I\nthink 13, 13 years old. And we left Israel.",

Her husband that she married was, had an\nuncle in the AFL and he was prominent to get him a job there and my aunt got a job in the\ngarment district. Became very well known. She traveled all for the country, the United States to\nsee what the factories were manufacturing and she was in charge. At that time my mother was a\nterrific seamstress and she said Stella do you want a job. And my mother said yes. What am I\ngoing to do? I\u2019m going to sit around here? So she got her a job and she became the sample maker\nthere. They manufactured robes and then they went into the dress business. So my mother\nalways made the sample dress. From the sample dress, my mother had to supervise the people in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013\nthe factory in Manhattan to make sure that the product that they made was equivalent to her\nsample and so she was in charge of that.",
        "A: In New York, I went to the public school. Public school yeah.",
        "A: In the Bronx. Well --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: This is what I want to tell you. I was in public school in the Bronx. One of 35 kids in a\nclassroom. I\u2019m a teacher so that I can tell you from the educational point of view it wasn\u2019t a\nkind of educational situation for a child that just came out of the Holocaust. I had a number on\nmy hand. In those days in New York they never taught the Holocaust. It wasn\u2019t mandated like in\nthe state of New Jersey. And the kids looked at the number. And they said Sarah what\u2019s that\nnumber on your hand. And I said well let me tell you I was in the Holocaust in Germany. And\nthe Germans put this number on me. I wasn\u2019t Sarah Racimora. I was this number. That\u2019s how\nthey referred to me. You talking crazy. There was no such thing as the Holocaust. New York\nnever taught the Holocaust. This was 1954. Those kids were never educated, never heard the\nword Holo \u2014 what\u2019s Holocaust. Well I didn\u2019t like to talk about it. And I went to my parents and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013\nI said you know what, I have to have this number removed. Because I am just too inundated\nwith questions that I cannot answer. So we went to Montefiore hospital. They got a surgeon and\nunfortunately the surgeon got sick and they brought someone else. Did a lousy job of this. This\nshould have been just a thin strip. And that\u2019s why I have a scar here. I had it removed. I felt\nbetter because the kids stopped talking about it. I went to my education in New York, finished\nhigh school and then I met my husband.\nHow did I meet my husband? I went to Moodus, Connecticut. Did you ever hear of that place?\nIt was a place where young people were able to meet young Jewish young men. And I went with\na friend of mine. I took courses at Hunter College. And then we went for a week to Moodus,\nConnecticut to meet some guys. We got there and we didn\u2019t meet anyone the whole week. And\nthen I said, Sunday we were supposed to leave. We had a cab take us there. So I said to my\nfriend, Brenda, I said you know I\u2019m hungry. Let\u2019s go to the dining room. I feel like a salami\nsandwich. So we went down and I stood on line and this, there was a young man there. He says\nhi, how are you? What are you ordering? I said a salami sandwich. He says me too. He says I\u2019m\nhere with my friends. He came with four or five of his friends from New Jersey. They were\nready to meet young people. He says why don\u2019t you come over to the table and sit with us, get\nyour sandwich. So Brenda and I got a sandwich. We sat down with them. And we got to talking\nand he says, where are you from? You have an accent. I said well I\u2019m from Israel. He says you\nfrom Israel. He said yes you have an accent. I said well can you understand me. I can still speak\nEnglish. He made a derogatory comment about Israel and I was very angry. I\u2019m a rebel. I\npicked up the bottle of wine and I was ready to with the bottle. My husband Billy, later on we got\nmarried, grabbed my hand and he says put that bottle down. He\u2019s not worth it. Well we sat there\nand spent the evening with his friends. We had a very nice evening. And then the next day we\nwere leaving Moodus, Connecticut. Dana lodge. I don\u2019t think it exists anymore. And Billy says\nyou know what I'll take you home. Where do you live? I said I live in the Bronx right across\nthe street from Yankee stadium. Oh, he says, I know that area, don\u2019t worry. I'll get you home\nsafe. So Brenda took the cab home cause we paid for that and he took me home. And that\u2019s the\nhistory. After that it was a romance. We dated for a year or so. He says you know what I really\nwant you to move to New Jersey. You can continue education. So I switched colleges and I went\nto Newark State, was a teaching college. Now it\u2019s Kean University and I finished my education\nthere, got my degree from, certified in New Jersey, kindergarten through eighth grade. And I got\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013\na position in Scotch Plains Fanwood teaching third grade. I taught there a year, a year and a half,\nI became pregnant with my daughter Debby. So I had to stop teaching. And I said Billy I can\nhave some. There was a very nice woman living next to us 1n the apartment house and she said\nshe was willing to take care of Debby while I went to work. My husband says no one is going to\ntake over my daughter. You stay home. So I had to give up teaching. And I stayed home and I\nraised my daughter. Later on we saved enough money. We lived in the Village for quite a while.\nWe lived there I think ten years. And we bought a house in Livingston, New Jersey, a very\naffluent community, a Jewish community. And we\u2019re there now over 40 years. My daughter\nlives in Renalopin [ph]. She has two children, boys. They are now in college at University of\nIndiana. They both decided to go to the same college. Cody is a senior. Tyler is a freshman. She\njust took off to class. She\u2019s not even home. And my son became a spinal surgeon in Baltimore,\nhas a very nice group of doctors. Does a lot of traveling throughout the world, educating other\ndoctors in orthopedic surgery. He went to China, he went to Japan. He does a lot of traveling.\nAnd he has two children, Katy the little princess. Katy is now 11. Ethan is 13. And they both go\nto private schools because the Baltimore school system is not that great so they\u2019re both in two\ndifferent schools. They\u2019re not in the same school. Katy goes to an all-girls school where my\ndaughter in law graduated from. And Ethan is in a school from, very big school from\nkindergarten through high school. And the whole school, money was donated by Jewish families.\nHow do I know? Every building has a Jewish name. We went to visit the school to see where\nEthan was. They have a very nice life. Now they\u2019re traveling by bikes. They are in Switzerland\nand going through all the other countries, going to be away for two weeks so I won\u2019t see them.",
        "A: Absolutely. For a very long time I was busy with my career, raising my kids. And I just put\neverything aside. I didn\u2019t want to think about it. My father brought the video, after he made a\nvideo with Steven Spielberg. He showed it to my children. We spoke about it and whenever dad\ncame to visit me in New Jersey. He lived in New York at that time, my mother had died. He\nremarried a Holocaust survivor, the second wife. And he used to visit so everything else was\nfine. And we didn\u2019t discuss it that much. Years later, recently I picked up and I said I have to do\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013\nsomething about it. And this is why I ended up being a teacher, being involved in teaching about\nthe Holocaust.\nI learned from my father\u2019s video which I know you have a copy of that here, the whole story how\nhe saved me. And this was the basic of my foundation for these PowerPoint sessions. I contacted\nmy good friend, Elizabeth Bess who was the principal at a very prestigious reformed temple and\nwe got together and we wrote this program. And now what we\u2019re doing, we are managing to go\nout and talk about the Holocaust in a very, very educational way. And also in a creative way.\nThe children learn about it. Walking out of one of these sessions that they can go home and say\nto their parents, this is what we\u2019re doing.\nA lot of people in the United States, even though they belong to a synagogue, they\u2019re not that\neducated on the Holocaust. So this is what we\u2019re doing now. That\u2019s why we came out here,\nElizabeth and I to seek more information. We found out a lot of information yesterday as I told\nyou about my family. And we\u2019re rewriting the whole curriculum for the Holocaust. Programs\nthat we\u2019re going to be doing.",
        "A: I can\u2019t tell you. It would just be a guess. My whole survival is I use the word when I speak to\nmy students, it was Bashert. A lot of them don\u2019t know the word. It\u2019s a Yiddish word and I said\nI guess I was chosen to survive to tell the story, to come here and teach you about the Holocaust.\nSo you can share it with your parents. Many of these children are not Jewish, where we go. We\ngo to many affluent day schools. Some of them are Jewish, some aren\u2019t. Some don\u2019t know\nanything about the Holocaust. But the main thing that Elizabeth and I see is that we are reaching\nthat population. When they walk out of one of our sessions they say Sarah, we learned so much\ntoday that we didn\u2019t know before. I had them write an evaluation. We went, I don\u2019t know if\nyou\u2019re familiar with the Princeton Day School in New Jersey, very affluent school. My cousin\u2019s\ndaughter teaches there which is a big plus also. She set her class up for us to give our spiel.\nThe kids were mesmerized. They walked out. They wrote evaluation. What did they want to\nknow the most? Tell us more stories about your father. You, exactly what happened.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013\nThey loved the story when he put me in a potato sack and he threw me there. What happened to\nyou? Did you survive? I said I did tell them the story. It was very personal and we are getting\nvery successful with it. We work very hard.",
        "A: You can say that. I would never describe it, but it\u2019s possible, absolutely. I have a lot of\nfeelings that are hidden within me, absolutely.",
        "A: Right. A different face.",
        "A: Well I knew when Eichmann went on trial what he did. Exactly. I had very, very good\nfeelings that he was captured to be very honest with you. And I hope that more of those people\nwould be captured and taught a lesson that that should never happen again.",
        "A: Absolutely. Betsy and I were just discussing it. Absolutely. With the way the world is now\nanyone can come into the United States. We had to wait til our visas were cleared. We could\nhave been here earlier in the United States. There was a quota. There are no quotas now.\nAnyone can come into the United States unfortunately.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013",
        "A: It was marvelous. I was a senior in high school. My father made sure that he knew about the\nConstitution. I sat down and I prompt them. My father at that time started to read the New York\nTimes. He went to Taft high school, took some lessons in English with my mother. And we\nwent for our citizen papers five years afterward, very proud.",
        "A: I was very proud. It was in a big room, somewhere downtown in Manhattan. I don\u2019t\nremember exactly. And it was a big group of people who became citizens. He was very proud.",
        "A: No, no. I separated myself, psychologically, I was the mother of children born in the United\nStates.",
        "A: No, I never discussed it with them.",
        "A: No, no, no. I just set it aside.",
        "A: Well it didn\u2019t come to discussing the Holocaust until my father was interviewed by Steven\nSpielberg. And my father came to the house. He still lived in New York and showed my father\u2019s\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013\ninterview and that\u2019s when they really learned. I think at that time I think Debby and Steve and\nthey were maybe fourth or fifth graders. You know, not before that.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No. Well they knew that I was born in Poland. You know and during the war they knew that.\nJust that. They didn\u2019t ask me details. You know then of course as they got older they studied it\nand they knew what was happening. Later on they asked me questions when they got older.",
        "A: Well [Il tell you the traveling in those cattle cars.",
        "A: Yes, that absolutely.",
        "A: No, not really. No, no. Oh, dogs yes. I am fearful of dogs. Thank you Betsy.",
        "A: Because at times the Germans sometimes walked around with a dog you know in Radom.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013",
        "A: No it\u2019s nothing major you know what I\u2019m saying to you. It\u2019s just that oh, I don\u2019t like dogs.",
        "A: Absolutely I\u2019m sure, I\u2019m sure.",
        "A: In what sense? Well I would have been brought up completely differently you know. I\nwouldn\u2019t have missed all those young years. You know that I missed. You know, being fearful,\nremembering that I had to hide under the bed. I wouldn\u2019t experience that. It probably would\nhave been a more positive kind of growing up to be very honest. A happier growing up, not\nbeing fearful what would happen. Not being cautious. It would have been a completely different\nstory, absolutely.",
        "A: Well religiously once my father made the tape with Steven Spielberg, he came back to\nJudaism. He used to go to shul when he lived in Florida. Every Saturday morning he gathered a\ncouple of his friends. They got in the car. They went to services. Holidays he loved to observe. I\nused to make all the holidays you know and he used to come to my house and we celebrated all\nthe holidays. There was the pinnacle of happiness. He remembered, he used to say, remember\nwhen your grandmother made this, you know. His memories came back. My grandfather the\nsame thing too. I mean Passover was beautiful because my grandfather had a beautiful voice.\nAnd at the end of the Seder we used to sit with the Haggadah and he used to sing the songs. My\nkids still remember that. Debby said to me the other day. I remember when great grandpa was\nsinging all these songs from the Haggadah. He had a beautiful voice. And of course my kids\nwere going to Hebrew school so they joined with him.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013",
        "A: Yes, absolutely.",
        "A: Yes, absolutely. Yes, in a very positive way. I mean we\u2019ve lived in Livingston now for over\n40 years. In a very Jewish community. I know a lot of people. I\u2019ve taught at a lot of temples.\nYou know I\u2019m not only conservative, but reform temples also so I\u2019m very well aware of the\nJewish religious life. We\u2019ve been members of the temple. My kids were bar mitzvahed and bat\nmitzvahed you know at Beth Shalom. My grandchildren, we had them at the bimah many of\nthem, very involved.",
        "A: That\u2019s very interesting that you ask that. I have very negative feelings against Germany.\nAbsolutely. My grandson Cody was just on a trip this summer in some of the European\ncountries. And what he said to me, grandma I\u2019m going to go to Poland. I want to see Auschwitz.\nHe went to Poland and I haven\u2019t had time to discuss with him because he\u2019s so busy getting ready\nto go back to school. He saw the world, he saw what the world was like. Not like in the United\nStates. Different ways of living. He visited a lot of countries, had a terrific experience through a\nvery nice program that the college ran for students. And he spent I think a month or so in\nEurope. He\u2019s back in school now. I haven\u2019t had a chance to speak to him.",
        "A: Yes, I went on the March of the Living and before I went there I called my daughter up and I\nsaid Debby I can\u2019t go by myself. I need you to go. She said let me check with my boss and I said\nDebby it\u2019s going to be only a week. The March of the Living. Went to Poland first and then to\nIsrael. And the man that led this group of students I had his children at day school where I\ntaught and Joel called me up and he said Sarah why don\u2019t you come with me to Israel. Not to\nIsrael, I\u2019m sorry. To Poland. And I said Debby can afford only one week to be away from her\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013\njob. Is it ok 1f we just come to Poland with you? He says absolutely. He had two survivors,\nmyself and another man, an older man. And it was a marvelous, marvelous trip. Good\nexperience.\nAnd I said Debby you have to come with me because this is L\u2019Dor V\u2019Dor [ph]. And we only\nwent to Poland.",
        "A: Well we went to, we did Poland the whole thing, the whole trip.",
        "A: No. When we went to Auschwitz, I just said, he says mom you sit down. Debby was my\nphotographer. She took all the pictures of our trip to Poland and for my birthday she gave me an\nalbum of all of the pictures. We visited a school in Poland, a Jewish school, had a marvelous\nexperience talking to the rabbi who was in charge of the school, talked to the teachers. They\nwere teaching Hebrew there, beautiful.",
        "A: It was just, it was just a building and I didn\u2019t go into the building to be very honest. I couldn\u2019t\ndo it. I couldn\u2019t do it. Debby says mom you sit here outside. I\u2019m going to go in and I\u2019II take all\nthe pictures. Don\u2019t worry about it. She did a marvelous job. I have a terrific album.",
        "A: Oh absolutely.",
        "A: Yes I do.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013",
        "A: Well what happened, my father applied for himself and my mother said she doesn\u2019t want any\nof that dirty money. She said Leon do not fill out the papers for me. She was very, very strict. So\nmy mother never got reparation. My father got reparation and I get reparation. Now something\nnew is working now with the Israeli government where they want to give reparation for people\nwho are older and Israel is trying to work out something with Germany. I haven\u2019t heard anything\nyet.",
        "A: No, I have nothing to do with, I mean with the survivors it was only my father\u2019s friends.\nWhen I used to come.",
        "A: No, no if I meet them. Fine. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m more comfortable.",
        "A: Than. No, no there\u2019s no distinction between survivors and Americans. I\u2019m an American. I\u2019m\nan educator. You know I don\u2019t dwell about the survival to be really honest with you. I couldn\u2019t\nwait to come to Washington to the Holocaust museum. My father was the first one when the\nHolocaust museum opened. With his friends. They got a bus of all the survivors from Radom\nand they came to Washington DC. He made sure of that. He was a do-er.",
        "A: Well I told my grandchildren. My granddaughter came back from camp and I called her up\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013\nand I said Katy, how was camp? How did you do? Grandma it was terrific. I said Katy I want\nyou to know I\u2019m going with my friend to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC. Grandma,\nthat\u2019s terrific and I said when I come back we will make a date and you and Ethan and Daddy\nand Mommy are going to go with me to the Holocaust museum because I want to show you\nsome things and some pictures that are now in the newspapers that I didn\u2019t even know. I said I\u2019m\ngoing with a friend of mine, Elizabeth Bess, very good friend of mine. We\u2019re going to do a lot of\nresearch there. And when I come back I\u2019m going to show you all the things. Grandma that\u2019s\nterrific. I can\u2019t wait to see it. She was very enthusiastic about it. So I will pass, how can I say it,\nthese feelings, the positive feelings about it. What I have learned with this.",
        "A: What did I learn?",
        "A: I learned that it could happen again. That don\u2019t look away and say that happened many years\nago. You lived through it. You survived it. You were able to come to the Holocaust museum and\ntell your story. I am not that sure that it wouldn\u2019t happen again to be very honest with you. The\nway the world is going now. Unfortunately. I\u2019m very pessimistic to be very honest with you.\nTo see there are no quotas to come into the United States. We had to wait all that time you know\nto come here after the Holocaust. Roosevelt had a quota for, for the Polish quota. There\u2019s no\nquotas. Anyone can come in. The borders are open. All you hear on tv and anywhere that you\ngo, all the atrocities that are happening unfortunately. Every day it\u2019s anew gimmick. Robbing\npeople, killing people. The world is terrible now and I\u2019m very sad about it.",
        "A: Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2013",
