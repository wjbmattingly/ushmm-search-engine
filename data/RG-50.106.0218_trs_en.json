And my sister was younger so she \u2014",
        "Q: She was in the earlier school?",
        "A: Yeah and that could continue til fourth grade. So there was no issue. I went to that school in\nSeptember in 1938 but it really didn\u2019t have the greatest effect on my life, except that I felt good\nabout being there because we left you know several months later.

        "Q: But you weren\u2019t allowed to go out on the street then?",
        "A: By myself, anyway. And we were, you know I was afraid to be. And going away in the\nsummer and for instance on the ski trip that, with the school that was just the week before March\nin where you could, there you could feel the Nazism in the mountains. It was\ncompletely so.",
        "Q: How did you feel that, in what sense?",
        "A: You just felt it, that we were surrounded by enemies. And the amazing thing is we were on\nthe slopes and it was a second year gymnasium which is the sixth grade class. Skiing and on the\nslope with us was the Duke of Windsor who had just abdicated I think or something. He was in\nthe process of marrying her, the Duchess of Windsor. But anyway, we felt it there. I mean\ntotally because we stayed at the type of place that you know in the mountains where there were\nno Jews. It was obvious that it was their town.",
        "Q: You yourself didn\u2019t experience any direct anti-Semitic \u2014",
        "A: Well it was coming pretty soon. I mean my father\u2019s business.",

        "A: That, a commissar was put in which meant that he oversaw the whole business and eventually\nit was taken over and he had a lot of good friends among the gentiles who suddenly became big\nshots in the Nazi party. But so I think that he was somewhat \u2014 he was somewhat in better shape\nby some unseen protection you know. But so that, the business was going and what else. How\ndid \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 13",
        "Q: Do you know if they had any, if your father or mother had any relation or communication\nwith their families in the other, you know far away?",

        "Q: To go into the countryside you mean?",
        "A: No, no, to go abroad. Is that what you\u2019re asking?",
        "Q: No I was asking, your relatives you said were not in Vienna.",
        "A: No, they offered to take us into Poland. My father didn\u2019t think that was a good move.",
        "Q: Right. Ok.",
        "A: So we didn\u2019t move. He wrote to relatives in other countries.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s when he started to write to \u2014",
        "A: Yes, immediately. So they wrote to Palestine and to the United States and I had some cousins\nin Palestine and his brother and the cousin didn\u2019t answer and my sister years later said it\u2019s a good\nthing. But anyway so didn\u2019t answer. I had cousins in New York who did answer.",
        "Q: Who did answer.",
        "A: Did answer and who you know gave us an affidavit and helped us elaborate the roads through\nCuba and all that.",
        "Q: At that point, what did America mean to you, as a 12 year old?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 14",
        "A: An unknown promised land.",
        "Q: But something very positive?",
        "A: Yes, yes. I had met actually those relatives were on their honeymoon in Vienna a couple of\nyears before and other people too and whom, you know it sounded like an unknown wonderful\nplace.",
        "Q: Your father got papers, got the affidavits from the New York \u2014",
        "A: From the family in New York, in New York. And then there was another issue that, you know\nthe Kristallnacht. You know that. So do you want the sequence was that they came to our house\nand they went from door to door and took out all the men from the whole building. You know\nand they came to our door. They read the name. The name is Schachter and somebody gave the\norder, skip that door.",
        "Q: Oh?",
        "A: So they skipped our door and went on and we could hear the screams in the streets and could\nhear the glass breaking and everything else but we were saved for the night.",
        "Q: Do you know how that happened?",
        "A: No, I never found out but we were sitting in the ante room, the large ante room, actually\nwaiting to be invaded and my father said would you like me to go out so that we get it then over\nwith. And so we said no. And that\u2019s when they skipped us and, but we could hear everything and\nI\u2019ve never forgotten it. In the streets and then after Kristallnacht when the others were\ntransported you know to god knows what destinations. My father was contacted by some Aryan\nfriend of his or formerly friends and now Aryan. But they were still friendly and was told that\nhe had to leave the country by December 31\u201c', 38. Otherwise that nobody could vouch for\nanything. That wasn\u2019t likely to leave.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 15\nAnyway so they intensified their efforts to get the exit possibilities and the, so America was so, I\nmean the United States was the possibility. But we also needed a document called an\nunbedankleischtide [ph] to get out of the country which had to be gotten from the Nazis and\nwhich wasn\u2019t available so quickly. We might not have it by December 31\u201c. So we decided, my\nparents decided to split the family up. And so that my father and my little sister who was\nadorable would go on New Year\u2019s Eve and try and cross the border because the guards would be\ndrunk. They thought.\nAnd we would stay and wait for the paper and then see if we could exit properly and perhaps\nship some of our stuff overseas and so await us later on.\nAt any rate they did proceed accordingly. In the meanwhile the people from -- the cousins\nhelped us get a visa into Cuba, which was obtainable at that point by depositing $500 per person\nas a guarantee in Cuba and sending us tickets to go to Cuba. And \u2014",
        "Q: This was your American cousin who told you.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What were their names?",
        "A: Their name was Max and Ida Rothschild. They lived in Great Neck. And so they, it was my\nfather\u2019s first cousin. Anyway they, where was I. They arranged for the Cuba. So my sister and\nmy father got through. They were drunk and they went, it\u2019s really amazing, to Switzerland and\nthen went on to England, very soon after, with the idea that we would join them in England,\nwhere we had very good friends.",
        "Q: How did he stay in contact with your mother?",
        "A: Well we didn\u2019t -- I mean there wasn\u2019t much time involved. And we left two weeks later. It\nso happened.",
        "Q: No, once he left your house and got over, do you know how he stayed in contact with \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 16",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. But, when they got to England they called us for sure. I don\u2019t\nknow. I just don\u2019t know. Anyway we stayed behind and we did not have the paper. I can imagine\nhow my mother felt when they said goodbye to each other. At any rate, eventually the paper\ncame and they packed the list van you know with our belongings with the SS watching every bit\nof the way what we\u2019re taking, what we\u2019re not. And my mother was very smart and she\u2019d give\nsome away and you know she\u2019d bribe them and all the way. So we got some things together.\nAnd they were shipped to the United States to await our eventual arrival.",

        "A: What I shipped was all my books and they were children\u2019s. It was ridiculous.",
        "Q: Your books.",
        "A: Some of them, no value to me. In the end, I gave it to, you know when you give -- I love my\nbooks. I didn\u2019t want to give them up.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 17",

We stayed very briefly and my brother in law,\nthe one that had come from Poland and for the World\u2019s Fair to buy some machinery, had by then\nlived in Lakewood and purchased a farm. And so we had, they thought that the most intelligent\nthing in the way of moving was my mother and the two children would go to Lakewood and my\nfather would try to establish himself in New York and make connections during the week and\ncome just on the weekend. Anyway we moved, the whole furniture, everything to Lakewood and\nwe stayed there and about five days after we arrived, we had an episode at night where\nsomebody was climbing up the ladder and my brother in law took a shotgun. They used to \u2014 and\nlooked out the window and it was my father. He didn\u2019t shoot, who had come to say that the\nfamily had to stay together. No matter what. This is no good. So and that\u2019s a good thing\nbecause my brother in law was ultra-orthodox so it would have turned out much different. To\nlive with. In general too. I mean this is a very orthodox community in Lakewood. Anyway, my\nfather got us. No, my father and mother went to New York and got an apartment in Washington\nHeights and we moved to Washington Heights. And I\u2019ve been in New York ever since.

        "A: Did answer and who you know gave us an affidavit and helped us elaborate the roads through\nCuba and all that.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 14",
        "A: An unknown promised land.",
        "A: Yes, yes. I had met actually those relatives were on their honeymoon in Vienna a couple of\nyears before and other people too and whom, you know it sounded like an unknown wonderful\nplace.",
        "A: From the family in New York, in New York. And then there was another issue that, you know\nthe Kristallnacht. You know that. So do you want the sequence was that they came to our house\nand they went from door to door and took out all the men from the whole building. You know\nand they came to our door. They read the name. The name is Schachter and somebody gave the\norder, skip that door.",
        "A: So they skipped our door and went on and we could hear the screams in the streets and could\nhear the glass breaking and everything else but we were saved for the night.",
        "A: No, I never found out but we were sitting in the ante room, the large ante room, actually\nwaiting to be invaded and my father said would you like me to go out so that we get it then over\nwith. And so we said no. And that\u2019s when they skipped us and, but we could hear everything and\nI\u2019ve never forgotten it. In the streets and then after Kristallnacht when the others were\ntransported you know to god knows what destinations. My father was contacted by some Aryan\nfriend of his or formerly friends and now Aryan. But they were still friendly and was told that\nhe had to leave the country by December 31\u201c', 38. Otherwise that nobody could vouch for\nanything. That wasn\u2019t likely to leave.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 15\nAnyway so they intensified their efforts to get the exit possibilities and the, so America was so, I\nmean the United States was the possibility. But we also needed a document called an\nunbedankleischtide [ph] to get out of the country which had to be gotten from the Nazis and\nwhich wasn\u2019t available so quickly. We might not have it by December 31\u201c. So we decided, my\nparents decided to split the family up. And so that my father and my little sister who was\nadorable would go on New Year\u2019s Eve and try and cross the border because the guards would be\ndrunk. They thought.\nAnd we would stay and wait for the paper and then see if we could exit properly and perhaps\nship some of our stuff overseas and so await us later on.\nAt any rate they did proceed accordingly. In the meanwhile the people from -- the cousins\nhelped us get a visa into Cuba, which was obtainable at that point by depositing $500 per person\nas a guarantee in Cuba and sending us tickets to go to Cuba. And \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Their name was Max and Ida Rothschild. They lived in Great Neck. And so they, it was my\nfather\u2019s first cousin. Anyway they, where was I. They arranged for the Cuba. So my sister and\nmy father got through. They were drunk and they went, it\u2019s really amazing, to Switzerland and\nthen went on to England, very soon after, with the idea that we would join them in England,\nwhere we had very good friends.",
        "A: Well we didn\u2019t -- I mean there wasn\u2019t much time involved. And we left two weeks later. It\nso happened.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 16",

Anyway we stayed behind and we did not have the paper. I can imagine\nhow my mother felt when they said goodbye to each other. At any rate, eventually the paper\ncame and they packed the list van you know with our belongings with the SS watching every bit\nof the way what we\u2019re taking, what we\u2019re not. And my mother was very smart and she\u2019d give\nsome away and you know she\u2019d bribe them and all the way. So we got some things together.\nAnd they were shipped to the United States to await our eventual arrival.",

        "A: Oh we saw a lot outside on the streets they demolished the showcases. Anybody, you know\nthe windows of stores. Everything and I heard screaming men in the back. We had talk and even\nthe back and in the front and you could hear them lugging the men away from their homes.",

        "A: Well yes, because when Hitler came to Vienna, the French governess left. She went, she\ndisappeared almost immediately.

I mean it was an interesting crossing and there were others\ngoing to different parts of Latin America, different ports. And similar families. Similar\nsituations and when we landed in Havana, we, men came up to inspect the, the boats and the\npapers and everything and then transported us into small boats in the harbor. And told us all to\ngo into small boats. And we went into these boats and we thought we were going into Havana.\nBut we weren\u2019t. They shipped us to a small island off the coast. And where they had an\norphanage for Cuban children and they separated the men and the women. And they wanted us\nto buy our way out.",

So, it was a beautiful house and a huge kitchen which was\nshared. And with a coal stove. My mother had to light the stove. A big change from what she\nwas brought up to do. But she was terrific. And washed the marble floors and everything. And\nmy father went into town and tried to establish relations with the textile trade. I don\u2019t know how\nbecause he didn\u2019t speak Spanish. And the first day that he went to town he was robbed of his\ngood watch, a gold watch which was inherited from his father. But at any rate, he managed. He\ndid establish friendships and relationships and imported textiles for the trade there. I don\u2019t know\nhow he managed, I mean really I don\u2019t know. And they arranged for us, they didn\u2019t like the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 23\nschools, the public schools were impossible. And so they arranged for us to go to private school.\nAnd they found a very good private school which without money in my, they called it the\nEnglish School at the time.

They\nhad two teenage boys and they second family had \u2014 were Germans and were totally un, were not\neducated and didn\u2019t have the same vision of wanting the kids to be that well educated either. So\nthere, you know you got used to various types of people. And what else did we do? The school\nday was long enough and the community was friendly. So but we mixed mostly with our own.\nYeah. My father mixed with the trades. And we stayed friends with those Cubans for years later.",

We stayed very briefly and my brother in law,\nthe one that had come from Poland and for the World\u2019s Fair to buy some machinery, had by then\nlived in Lakewood and purchased a farm. And so we had, they thought that the most intelligent\nthing in the way of moving was my mother and the two children would go to Lakewood and my\nfather would try to establish himself in New York and make connections during the week and\ncome just on the weekend. Anyway we moved, the whole furniture, everything to Lakewood and\nwe stayed there and about five days after we arrived, we had an episode at night where\nsomebody was climbing up the ladder and my brother in law took a shotgun. They used to \u2014 and\nlooked out the window and it was my father. He didn\u2019t shoot, who had come to say that the\nfamily had to stay together. No matter what. This is no good. So and that\u2019s a good thing\nbecause my brother in law was ultra-orthodox so it would have turned out much different. To\nlive with. In general too. I mean this is a very orthodox community in Lakewood. Anyway, my\nfather got us.

        "A: Thank god for this one but it\u2019s not immediate that I was aware of. The relatives that I had\ndidn\u2019t live in the same country as I did and \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if it was 50, 51 whatever you know. And I worked there for a number of years\nand I got married in 55 and \u2014",
        "A: Far from it. His great grandparents were born here, a Sephardic background from Holland.\nAnd he was \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 35",
        "A: At Park Avenue synagogue at a meeting. A friend of mine brought me. She was going out\nwith him and I wound up marrying him so \u2014",
        "A: In 55. And he was working for the New York Times.",
        "A: Yes. He worked for the New York Times all the way. I mean he\u2019d been in the war but and\nworked for the New York Times.",
        "A: Robert. Robert A. Barzilay.",
        "A: Yeah, we have two children. And five grandchildren.",
        "A: I worked in the Israeli mission and then eventually I didn\u2019t, when I had my son, I didn\u2019t work\nfull time and then I worked somewhat again. And then I started to work at, in admissions at the\nRodef Shalom School initially. Once I had the children. And so I worked there from 1970 on.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 36",
        "A: No, no, no. I feel American.",
        "A: I don\u2019t quite trust it. 1 mean you know I\u2019Il always like a Viennese waltz. We were there\nbriefly about 10, 15 years ago and I remember sitting in a restaurant where there were, had big\ntables and we sat because everybody ate jointly in a pub of some sort. And they were talking\nGerman and then they were talking to us. And I answered in German and they asked me how\ncome I knew German and I said I was born here and after that nobody talked to me. So yeah. So\nthey figured it out.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t speak it well but I, I don\u2019t speak it. I have no need, no need for it at all. That was\nthe only time I had need for it.",
        "A: Ihadn\u2019t, I haven\u2019t done it. I wouldn\u2019t do it. I mean I just \u2014 if I had the need then I would\ncommunicate because that\u2019s the thing to do but you know I have had not many more positive\nexperiences with the Spanish speaking \u2014",
        "A: At my children\u2019s age, I sort of marked it, I think. I didn\u2019t think about it too much, didn\u2019t\nthink about it too much. I mean I do occasionally think about it. One of my granddaughters for\ninstance is now the age that I was exactly and I think how it was different it is what she\u2019s into\nliving, you know. Television you know it\u2019s just fantastic. It\u2019s different.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 37",
        "A: Less than I do now. Not so much.",
        "A: Somewhat, but not tremendously. More so now that I\u2019m older.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s somewhat removed, different. And also because I\u2019m the only one surviving\nat the moment.",
        "A: I did not. I did not that much. She talked about it more I think.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how it affected her but she devoted herself to helping the hungry and she did a\nlot for the \u2014 she actually, it affected her. That\u2019s what, she had a big write up in the Times and it\naffected. What she did in life.",
        "A: Yeah, doing, yeah working with people that need help and so forth and education and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 38",
        "A: No, no, no. In the government capacity. Yes.",
        "A: Well she was in, you don\u2019t really want me to take out the -- should I take it out and read it to\nyou.",
        "A: Generally well she worked for the United Nations, one of the committees. She worked in the\nWorld Bank. She worked at the hunger in Mexico, she devoted a lot of time to that. And various\nother things of that nature and Africa particularly. Her interest in Africa was her specialty and\njust everywhere. And that, I would say to a great extent so she individually, as a family they also\ndo things. That\u2019s a different story.",
        "A: Oh yes. We spoke English from the day we came here and didn\u2019t speak anything else. Even\nthe parents, never spoke German yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. We just did. They wanted it and they, we did it. That\u2019s enough.",
        "A: They spoke at home only English also.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 39",
        "A: By speaking it, I guess. I don\u2019t know why people don\u2019t do it now.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure it had an effect but 1t would take some professional to determine that. I can\u2019t judge.\nBut I feel I had a good youth and I was lucky to maintain my parents and I was lucky to be able\nto do what I \u2014 and I have terrific grandchildren and you know and children so yeah.",
        "A: No. I mean I was angry at the events that took place but I, it\u2019s just part of life. No, I can\u2019t say\nthat.",
        "A: A lot of people have to do it in various generations. I don\u2019t give it too much thought. At this\npoint it\u2019s even interesting to be born elsewhere. At that time people thought you were a refugee\nbut at this point I don\u2019t feel that way. Yeah, I mean it\u2019s added an extra dimension to my life.",
        "A: Imean you know it wasn\u2019t easy for my parents, particularly, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s, the effect is\nall negative. Many experience it.",
        "A: I imagine so.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 40",
        "A: It was briefly though. You know and it wasn\u2019t a permanent, you know it was briefly. I didn\u2019t",
        "A: Oh I definitely feel that it\u2019s very important not to be you know.",
        "A: No. No. I think I was afraid of joining things to a great extent in my youth. Now that I\u2019m\nthinking about it. I wouldn\u2019t have joined \u2014 I remember being in college and people being in the\nCommunist party and this, so or all sorts of things were going on then. And I wouldn\u2019t have\njoined anything after I saw the mass eruptions all over the place. I think I was not that eager to\njoin. And I think that persists.",
        "A: I guess it must have, yes, yes. Marching en masse and all that business.",
        "A: It hopefully not but yes. I don\u2019t want to predict such a terrible thing. The hatred is gathering.\nBut hopefully it will not.",
        "A: We traveled but not back to where I came from.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 41",
        "A: I went back once when we won a trip and I didn\u2019t want to go back but I did go back.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t want to, I didn\u2019t you know I had no, nobody to see and I was more interested in\nseeing other countries that, where I didn\u2019t have all those memories. But I did go and \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right. I saw the house and I saw the school and I saw the frame of mind that, in the\nrestaurant. So it is a beautiful city and that\u2019s it.",
        "A: Once and then on a cruise for one day as well, but really once, once for five days when we\nwon atrip. Not to Austria, but we won a trip with the United Way and went to several countries\nand we went to Vienna as well.",
        "A: Oh I\u2019m very enthusiastic about it. But I wouldn\u2019t immigrate.",
        "A: Yes. Several times, yes. But I was younger and then once with my husband.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 42",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember too much but I well \u2014",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember. I can imagine what they were but I had no \u2014 I can\u2019t give you too\nmuch of it. Recall on that. He deserved it.",
        "A: I really do. I have no other possible roots.",
        "A: No, no way, inno way. I mean I\u2019m Jewish but that\u2019s, you know that.",
        "A: I get $400 a month or something like that. $500. $400. It depends on the rates.",
        "A: Nothing great but also something like that. And that only briefly because they died. And you\nknow it wasn\u2019t settled that early in the \u2014",
        "A: But no major reparations, no nothing. We have nothing",
        "A: In many ways the experiences have formed me.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 43",
        "A: I, it\u2019s difficult for me to judge but it\u2019s made me more a citizen of the world I think and I feel\nat home and I love traveling. I, we can\u2019t do it now but, and I think perhaps it\u2019s made me more\naccessible to different kinds of people and vice versa. But I really totally feel American.",
        "A: Very, very. I enjoyed it and the citizens are everywhere. And I relate well to people from\nmany countries.",
        "A: A few languages and that helps.",
        "A: What type of lesson, what?",
        "A: It might happen again. I don\u2019t know that lessons are learned. It\u2019s a new generation. It has no\nhatred. Different ones but it needn\u2019t always be directed at us. But it\u2019s terrible. And it\u2019s more\ndangerous now than ever.",
        "A: Not very, no not very. Very, reform and but they should know who they are and where they\ncome from. And I\u2019m part of that and that they\u2019re aware of and very much so.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 44",
        "A: I think that we\u2019ve covered. I love my grandchildren and they\u2019re interested in their roots as\nwell and they\u2019re very interested. In their fashion.",
        "A: Well I mean not an orthodox upbringing, that they wanted to be bar mitzvah and the parents\nleft it totally up to them. And they\u2019re very warm and receptive, great human beings and I have\ntwo granddaughters, one at Harvard and one a graduate from Harvard and is now at Cambridge\nin England and then I have three here. Three littler ones. And they\u2019re from eight to 16 in school\nin New York and all are very loving and caring human beings as I couldn\u2019t have wished for\nbetter. And they\u2019re willing to do good and wanting to do good and that\u2019s I feel is the\nachievement of the long life that I\u2019ve been fortunate to have.",
        "A: I, it may be so. It probably is you know. And I don\u2019t want to take total credit for that. I think\na lot of things enter it. Parents and so forth. But I think that did have an effect. It made them also\nmore receptive to people from other nations I think.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if she wrote her experiences, but she wrote several books but I don\u2019t know.\nYou\u2019d have to ask her. He\u2019s 97 and in Washington and I told you I think. He lives in Washington\nand you know the name of the place. I talking about. On Military road. So I don\u2019t think, I\u2019m sure\nshe\u2019s written something.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 23, 2014 45",
        "A: But we were fortunate because we could live with parents and the immediate family alive and\nthe ones that sacrificed I didn\u2019t really know that well. You know it doesn\u2019t affect you the same\nway. You know you would have wanted to have grandparents and relatives but we didn\u2019t\u2019 really\nknow them. It\u2019s not quite the \u2014",
        "A: We don\u2019t have very close relations at this point. My sister\u2019s children and my children are\nvery close. They\u2019re very close yeah. Like siblings are, they are very close.",
        "A: Thank you very much and I wish everyone, certainly my children and grandchildren all the\nbest and I want to think you for making this possible.",
        "A: Thank you, thank you.\n"
