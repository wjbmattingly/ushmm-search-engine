        "[DL] And whereabouts were you when, when war broke out? What was...\n[BB] | was in the Army, up at Catterick.\n[DL] So how did you join the Army \u2014 when, when did you join the Army?\n[BB] In...in February 1939.\n[DL] So...\n[BB] ...in London.\n[DL] And what made you join the Army at that point?\n[BB] | wanted to do my service, and my father did.\n[DL] And war broke out, and were you already being trained at that point?\n[BB] I'd done my basic training, and, and hadn't quite finished my trade training, and\ner, but then, they moved it over to look after the service men being called up, and we\ner, we became the police for the service men, if you could think of anything so daft,\nthe rookies, telling the sergeants what to do, and [MUMBLES], that\u2019s the way it was.\n[DL] And your memories of, er, war breaking out?\n[BB] Er, only, er we was in a, er camp, just up from our barracks as we were kicked\nout of our barracks to let the service men, and by then they were calling up the\ncivilians as well, they\u2019d taken over the barracks, we got, we got moved into what was\ncalled the Gann, the Gann, it was called, and er, | think it was er, somebody got a\nnewspaper, there, there, they come down and told us all that the, war declared that\nmorning.\n[DL] And when war was, had been declared, um, where, where, where were you\nsent?\n[BB] [MUMBLES]\n[DL] Where were you sent?\n[BB] | wasn\u2019t sent anywhere, | was, | stayed there, for a little while, and | was going\nout to, er, things in, | was on draft to go out, things in China, but of course that had to\nbe cancelled and er, they, they suddenly roped up quite a few of us and decided that\nthe 50 erm, 50\" division, the territorial division ... [MUMBLES] ...a lot of skilled\nlabour, | got drafted into the 50\" div.\n[DL] And where were they deployed?\n[BB] Well, as far as | was concerned, I, at Darlington, we moved, so, about 16 miles |\nthink it was.\n[DL] And from Darlington, where, where were you sent from there?\n[00:05:00]\n[BB] Well, well, from Darlington, we moved down to erm, Oxfordshire, where we did\ner war training, and when in, in the case of myself, was driving and that, cause er,",
        "the 50\" div was going, were going to be the division that, when er, when all the other\ntroops were in the trenches, the 50\" div was in the background, if there was a gap\nanywhere, we'd rush round with our cars and fill it in, which of course didn\u2019t happen,\nbut erm, that\u2019s where, | learnt to drive, and then in er, January, erm, January 40,\nwe'd been there, two, two or three months | suppose, and we went to erm, we went\nto France.",
        "[DL] And what happened in, in France?",
        "[BB] Well we was, we was stationed in the, one of the local town halls for a while,\nand then they started erm, moving some of us up the (mumbles), then we gradually\ncrept up the country, wise, stage by stage, until we reached um, a suburb of Lyon.\nThen, er, | mean, nothing, er, nothing much happened then, | can\u2019t remember\nactually, we actually moved up into Belgium and er, we weren't up there long, we\ncame back, and we spend most of our time in blooming Greece. And then, er, they\nmoved us back again, and er, May the 26\" | think it was in 1940, the, erm, the order\ncame beyond, that all surplus personnel to head for the, to head for Dunkirk. And er\nthat's what they did, all the electricians and things like that, but er anyway... | stayed\nand from there | moved up into a place called Abbey Kirk, into Belgium for a few\ndays, and then they said, erm, about six days | suppose it was, and er, they told me\nerm | could go home as well.\nSo we had to walk down to the er, the beach, and er there wasn't a soul anywhere,\nthen, and all we got when we got the was some blokes living in the, in the sand\ndunes waiting for a boat to come in, and they erm, and after that all we got was\nstratling from the Germans, going all the way up and down the beach - stratling.\nAnd er, | had um, er, erm, er, a left-hand quarter master, and he said er there\u2019s no\ngood staying here he said, there\u2019s no boats they don't look like they\u2019re coming, and\nthey just walked down into Dunkirk. So | said right, there was about eight of us,\ntrundling after him and er, [MUMBLES] | never noticed anyone got injured or\nanything, but by the time we got down to the road, the road just outside Dunkirk,\nthere was only me and another fella | didn\u2019t Know left, and | don\u2019t know why, but |\nhad blood all over my shirt as well, but where | got that from | don\u2019t know but it wasn't\nmine. And then, so we walked down into Dunkirk, initially towards the mall, the mall,\ner you know stretching out to the sea, and there was | think about three breaks in the\nmall, and we thought of course that\u2019s been hit, it, and as we got nearer there was not\nboats along there either, and so, er, the chap with me said let\u2019s walk on further past\nthe, there, and we'll see if we can erm, get a boat, somewhere in the fishing area, or\nsomething like that. So | said \u201cokay\u201d, but as we got near to the bottom of the...a big\nboy shouted out \u201cAy, you two, come here\u2019, and we walked down to some naval\nofficer, wanted us, and when we walked over where he was, was all got stretchers,\nwith wounded on them, and he said \u201cpick up one and take it up to the boat.\u201d And |\nsaid right, so, | couldn't very well argue with him so | thought don\u2019t know where the\nboat is, unless they, it's going to come in later, so we'd, we went up there and of\ncourse we had to lift it over these gaps, they\u2019d put gangplanks across the gaps in the\nmall, and of course we were tired by then, and we had a hell of a job to the lift the\nbloke up and carry him along, and he was unconscious, and we got over the other\nside and I'd had enough by then and told him, the other chap that needed to erm,",
        "have a rest, so we, about six of them at the side of the malls, so we sat there and, a\nlittle while, some of them come down the mall then, another Naval officer, must have\nbeen a doctor or something, and he said, wanted to know what we were doing,\nhaving a rest, and he said right, went to look at the fellow and said well you can't\ntake him with you, he\u2019s dead. And he said, \u201cjust tip him out on the sea, and go back\nto get another one.\u201d\n[00:10:30]\n[BB] So that\u2019s what we did, went back, got another one, and, and we ended up\ncarrying him all the way up the mall, and we were getting near to the top of the mall,\nand we could hear voices. And er, we wondered, where, this is all in the book by the\nway, what I\u2019m telling you...\n[DL] | know, it is all in the book, but | think it\u2019s important for, for the archives, that you\nexplain the background as to, as to how you ended up at E715 Auschwitz, so what\nyou're doing is explaining a bit about Dunkirk, and from Dunkirk, where you go from\nthere...\n[BB] Well we got further up, and we could hear these voices, and we got up then,\nand we could then see the boat, and the boat wasn\u2019t on our side of the mall, it was\nhidden in all the rubbish on the other side of the mall, and it was erm, a paddle\nsteamer. The erm, O God, the, I\u2019ve gone and forgotten its name, I\u2019ve been on it after\nthe war as well, and er, SO we... [COUGH].\nEr, a naval bloke came over to there and said \u2018give me one hand\u2019, and we lifted him\non board. And that\u2019s what we did, and first in, the other bloke standing there, | turned\naround, | was going to leave and said \u2018hey where you two going?\u2019 \u2014 \u2018going back to\nget another one\u2019, and he said, \u2018no\u2019 he said, \u2018we're leaving shortly and we're not\ncoming back\u2019. And he said come aboard, and he made us come aboard, so that\u2019s\nwhat we did. Certainly it was getting dusk, the paddle started going, we pulled off\nand er, apart from the fact we nearly tried to turn the boat over on the way, that\nthunderstorm, and we ended up in Dover the following morning, just about dawn.\n[DL] So you were one of the last, the last members to be evacuated from Dunkirk...\n[BB] [MUMBLES] ...small boat so can find any that come out. My [MUMBLES] didn't\ncome out for another week after me, but [MUMBLES] he was further down the coast\n[DL] And then, when you came back to this country, how long was it before you were\nredeployed to er, to Africa? When you went to Africa, when did you go to North\nAfrica?\n[BB] Er, well, we got that, that was erm, June, | was, some, June the first was the\nday | left Dunkirk, so it was then June the second that | arrived in Dover, and then er,\nwe erm, we, we were loaded onto trains which take, took us through, | forget the\nname of the place, to big fields outside Aldershot, and er | was there about three\ndays and | was in Aldershot, and that picture there, | had that taken, and er, then er,\n|, they sorted us all out there, and they sent me out to, up to erm Cheshire, Tatton\nPark in Cheshire.\n[DL] And from Cheshire, how long was it before you were sent to North Africa?",
        "[BB] Oh, what day, we moved in on, moved down to Somerset [MUMBLES], and\n[PAUSES], we worked down in Somerset with the erm, | got the job going out and\nvisiting planes that had crashed and that, but that\u2019s another story, and er, in the end\nwe went down to Swansea with our cars and everything, and dumped everything in\nSwansea, and came back by train, and a couple days after we moved up to Gourock\nin Scotland, and erm got on a boat called the [PAUSES]...\n[00:15:00]\n[BB] ...oh I\u2019ve thought of the name of the, erm... The Medway Queen was the erm,\nwhat | came out of France in, oh the Costa Rica is what it was called, the SS Costa\nRica. And we got on there, and we er, didn\u2019t know where we were going, and we\nthought after a few days travelling, we were erm travelling to Canada. But we went,\nbut halfway to Canada, then we turned South, went South and went into erm,\nFreetown at Sierra Leone, exactly the same as er, er, Dennis Avey did. Only\ndifference between him and me, er, he left there and went round and restocked at...\n[DL] When would you say you arrived at Sierra Leone, when would you say you\narrived into Freetown, what date?\n[BB] Erm, three weeks after we left Scotland, so must be about the second week in\nthe New Year.\n[DL] Of 1941?\n[BB] Yep\n[DL] And, you then started to fight against Rommel, and you were captured. Can you\nexplain how that happened?\n[BB] No, no... The... 41...1 got, we went up to Suez, and | spent some time erm,\ncourse we had no, that\u2019s right, we had no erm, no transport. All the transport we left\nat home at Swansea, and we thought well the transport be there waiting for us, but\nas it goes they hadn't even left England, they had nine weeks to erm Egypt, and they\ner, sO we hung about there, and they said it was er place called, er, pardon me,\nbefore we started this conversation | could remember them all. And erm, [PAUSES],\nand most of us had dysentery and things like that, and they said we were there in the\nacclimatization period to get used to the er, the climate in Egypt. And then we got\nmoved up to Mersa Matruh, where we stayed for some time, just getting out on\nrecces and things like that, and | think | spent most of my time in the sea, | think |\nspent most of my time in the Mediterranean swimming, and then they moved us up\nthere to the, the border with erm, Libya. And then moved into Libya, and went round\nLibya, and came back again and erm, then they erm, said that erm, [COUGH]\nTobruk was occupied then and we were going down, we went in the, for the relief of\nTobruk, which | think was November the 12\", 41, and we went from then down to,\nchasing the Germans all the way down past Durno, and down to Bengasi, and erm,\nand [MUMBLES], O God, | cant forget the name again, and et...\nAnyway, the er, the Germans had got a bit organised by the time we got there, and\nwe got pushed all the way back to er, more or less back to Tobruk, and er, a place",
        "called Beryl\u2019s Sevli, and we got surrounded by the erm, the Germans, and eventually\nwe ran out of ammunition, and of course got captured.\n[DL] So you were captured by Rommel, and, very briefly describe what happened\nwhen you were captured.\n[BB] | was still with my truck but when we saw the truck, erm, when there was too\nmuch ammunition flying about, | rushed down and got in a trench, and there was a\ncouple of blokes in there with machine guns, and the one at the far end got hit,\ndropped some grenades or something in the trench.\n[00:20:00]\nSo the fella, who | didn\u2019t Know of course, said \u2018I'll go up and use that, cause it\u2019s got a\nLewis gun\u2019, he said \u2018you use this as a Brent gun, you've used a Brent gun before?\u2019 |\nsaid yeah. So | used the Brent gun, and | can\u2019t even remember the Brent gun\nemptying, but something knocked me over. Anyway the next thing | saw was a boy\nshouting \u2018Rells, Rells\u2019, and | looked up and I, standing on the edge of the trench was\na blooming great big German, from my height he looked about ten feet tall, and with\na hand grenade, with one of those hand grenades in his hand, waving it at me. So |\ncrawled out there, and over the other side, about a hundred yards away you can see\nwhere all the, the infantry blokes were, so | went up there and joined them.\nWe stayed there for some hours, and the, er [COUGH, MUMBLES], the German\ninterpreter came along and er, and shouted out in very broad Yorkshire, \u2018anybody\nhere from Yorkshire?\u2019, and | looked behind the bloke, and most of the chaps were\nEast Yorks. And they all looked [MUMBLES], he says \u2018he can't be a German, he\nspeaks broad Yorkshire\u2019, and he really was, and he came there, but nobody would\nanswer. And, but somebody further down obviously did, and we eventually found out\nin the end that he, he\u2019d been brought up in England and erm, when, his mother had\nmarried a German soon after the First World War, and moved to Germany with him,\nand after, when he was still a baby anyway, she left her husband and brought him\nback to England, and of course he was brought up in_ England.\nAnd just before the war started, the erm, his father died, his father left him everything\nin his will, so he had to go to Germany to erm, deal with that, and once he'd finished\nhe went to get a visa to get back to England, and they wouldn't give him one. They\nsaid \u2018no, you're German, you'll go in the German Army\u2019, and of course all he wanted\nto do was get cash rich and come back home [LAUGHS]\n[DL] And at this point, did you see Rommel at this point?\n[BB] Only in the distance...\n[DL] ...only in the distance\n[BB] He took, he pulled up in his car, stood up in the car and that\u2019s all we knew, and\nthen this interpreter came down and told me what he was saying, and he was\napologising for us, cause he said the Italians morale is very low cause they've got no\nprisoners, so he\u2019s handing over all the prisoners he had there to the Italians. So that,\nand so that\u2019s what happened \u2014 they put us in lorries and carted us all down to the\ncoast, and dumped them on the Italians",
        "[DL] And you were then sent to an Italian Prisoner of War camp, er briefly what were\nconditions like for you at the Italian Prisoner of War camp?\n[BB] Well, er, despite what everyone\u2019s been saying they weren't bad, the main thing\nthat was bad about them was the lice [MUMBLES, COUGHS]. | mean you go\nthrough your trousers and you could kill four or five hundred lice eggs in one go. And\nwhat we used to get, | don\u2019t Know where we got them from but we got some Italian\ncigarettes and that\u2019s all we used them for, for lighting them, and going all the way\ndown the seam and killing all the eggs. You had to do it every day.\n[DL] And what...\n[BB] The only trouble with that, our camp, in sections, | was in the top section and we\nhad an RSM there who thought he was still in the blooming Army and tried to make\nus do [MUMBLES], and things like that, bloody nuisance actually.\n[DL] And sanitary conditions \u2014 what were the sanitary conditions like there?\n[BB] O they were alright, by account yeah\n[DL] And then you were moved to a separate Italian camp, or did you stay in...\n[BB] No, | was always in trouble in one way or another, and | presume the only\nreason | got it... And they moved quite a lot, | was up to another camp PG52, which\nis up north in, north of Italy, and | stayed there, and that was a good camp.\n[00:25:02]\nAnd very little lice in there too, because they had, er they used some of the senior\nsoldiers to go round and search people\u2019s clothing to see if you got any lice. And if\nyou had lice you got moved into a separate barrack until you got cleared of them.\n[DL] And in terms of the sanitary conditions, was there a camp you were in whereby\nthere was literally a bar over a trench, and that was effectively your toilet facility?\n[BB] Yes when we, when | first moved to Auschwitz\n[DL] Okay, so you then moved to a German...\n[BB] | don\u2019t even think it was a bar at first, | think it was a rope\n[DL] So you moved to...from Italy, to a German POW camp, and er you heard about\nthe working party. So what made you want to join a working party and what then\nhappened?\n[BB] Well, got moved up to, we all got dumped in the main er, British Camp, God\ngone and forgotten that as well\n[DL] Stalag VIIIB?\n[BB] No, anyway, and only been there a little while, and they all had separate\ncompounds, and the only ones we saw were the Canadians \u2014 the Canadians were in\na big compound on top end, and there was a road they could travel up and down,\nand they had a lot of freedom, and er, | don\u2019t know where most of the blokes on my",
        "camp was, | would say | was there more or less on my own, everybody seemed to\nhave disappeared, got somewhere, and a bloke come along and started talking to\nhim who\u2019s been in the camp for some time and erm, | was on about being hungry\nand that which | was, and he said \u2018why don't you get on the working party?\u2019. He said\n\u2018you get better fed on a working party\u2019, and er yeah, how do | do that, and he said\n\u2018well, they come round every so often asking for volunteers for working party.\u2019 | said\n\u2018okay\u2019, so he said \u2018what you want to do is promote, promote yourself before you go\u2019. |\nsaid \u2018I can\u2019t do that, | got no stripes\u2019, well | don\u2019t know how he got about it but he got\nstripes and everything for me, and | promote myself to a corporal. And er, he came\nabout soon after and said there\u2019s a bloke at the gate taking names for working party,\nso | went down there and he said, the bloke said \u2018can you speak in, er, German\u2019, |\nsaid \u2018no\u2019, he said \u2018okay I'll put you down as an interpreter then\u2019, | thought that\u2019s a bit\ndaft, so | went back, collected my things, and we all got paraded in there, put on\ncattle trucks and of course carted off \u2014 we didn\u2019t know where we were going. |\nthought we was \u2014 he told me about people who'd gone and worked on farms and\nthings like that, and how well fed they were and | thought I'll have a bit of that, and\nalso, a better chance of getting away too\n[DL] So these were the cattle trucks to er, to Auschwitz that you were on?\n[BB] Yeah\n[DL] What were conditions like on the cattle trucks?\n[BB] We were cramped in there, but no worse, not as bad as the ones that we\ntravelled in, that we travelled up from Italy to erm, Austria. They were worse because\nthe erm, the guards on the cattle trucks \u2014 of course there's no toilets or anything \u2014\nthey'd give us one of these old tin baths, to use as a toilet for everything, and of\ncourse after at least twenty in my truck, that was in the middle of the floor, and by the\ntime we'd er got up to the Brenner Pass, it was full, and of course it used to splash\nover, all over the place. We were all a stinking mess, and you couldn't get rid of it\nso... First time we got, they stopped, come to complain, they opened the door and\nyou couldn't even lift it to take it push out the door, had to tip it out the side. Anyway,\nthat was er, that was bad enough...and er\n[DL] And how much water, how much food, and how long did this journey actually\nlast for?\n[BB] Oh blimey...\n[00:30:00]\n[BB] ...can hardly remember now it was er, couple of days | suppose, didn\u2019t take any\nlonger, and we ended up in a camp, er, just outside Munich [COUGH], which was\nonly a transit camp, the camp there that was all British Officers , there was our camp,\nand the camp on the other side of us that was all erm, all Russians, and they were,\nand trying to talk to them was fun, but...\nAnd then they, they shipped us off to erm, Stalag VIIIB, that\u2019s what | was trying to\nthink of in the first place. And then it was Stalag VIIIB, and | met this fella who erm,\ngot me on the working party...",
        "[DL] ...On the working party. And the, the journey which you then went on, which we\nwere talking about, where you had the overflowing of the bath and the problems\nthere, that journey to Auschwitz which you say lasted a couple of...\n[BB] ...We had no, we didn't have any tubs or anything, that was coming up from\nItaly to...\n[DL] Into Germany? Into Austria?\n[BB] Into Austria\n[DL] Okay so you go from Austria across to, to Poland at this point?\n[BB] No, we went to Germany, to Stalag VIIIB\n[DL] And from Stalag VIIIB across to Auschwitz?\n[BB] Yep\n[DL] And how long did that journey last for?\n[BB] Can\u2019t remember, it didn\u2019t take long, might have been a day, or a day and a half,\n| must have slept on the journey surely\n[DL] And again the conditions on that particular cattle truck?\n[BB] Oh that was alright\n[DL] And whenabouts was this? Do you remember the year, the month?\n[BB] The year and the month for what?\n[DL] Er, for when you arrived at Auschwitz\n[BB] Yes, erm, October, 43\n[DL] Okay, and what were, what was your reaction upon arrival at Auschwitz? What\ndid you see?\n[BB] Of course we didn\u2019t Know what was going on there, only thing we saw, the top,\nthe railway line ended, didn't end, but where we got unloaded, the top of the | G\nFarben industry factory and of course we had to go and walk all the way down the\nside and round [MUMBLES], then about another mile down to the camp. And er,\nwalking down the side there, we could see the people there behind the wire with their\npyjamas on, and we didn't know they were Jews or anything, and one lot we saw\nwas carrying a great big long, like a telegraph pole, and about ten people on it, two\nbig fellas, one on each end, and little fellas down there, they were just hanging on.\nAnd of course everyone started taking the mickey out of them, saying it was funny to\nbe stupid to have the two big fellas on the end, they were actually carrying the pole,\nbut then afterwards of course we realised they were Jews, or told they were Jews,\nand afterwards when we went to work in the factory, course we obviously knew they\nwere Jews.\n[DL] And how long did it take for yourself and your fellow POWs to actually realise\nwhat was going on and what was happening to the Jews at Auschwitz?",
        "[BB] Well | was, can\u2019t remember, trying to remember the first day | arrived in there\ncause [COOUGH, MUMBLES] put on a working team of about six of us, and erm,\none of the chaps decided he was in charge, er a Welshman, started bossing us\nabout, and started on this hole we had to dig. | said \u2018if you want a hole dug, you can\ndig it your blooming self\u2019. | just cleared off. | gave, | thought, complained, | don't\nknow what happened to our guard, and | went behind the factory, and later on |\ncame back and see how they were getting on, but | never did any digging.\n[DL] But in terms of how long it took you to discover what was happening to the\nJews?\n[BB] Well that\u2019s when | found out, when | went for a walk round the factory\n[DL] So what did you see?\n[BB] | didn't think really anything, | just thought you know Jews working, | didn\u2019t see\nanyone being cruel then, but later on of course, | saw some of the Capos were so\nvicious and... [COUGH]\n[00:35:06]\n[BB] ...and that, you very rarely saw any German soldiers, it was mainly the erm\nJewish Capos who were causing most of the trouble\n[DL] And what, what did you see when they were causing the trouble? What did you\nwitness?\n[BB] |, tf one of them come over and spoke to me or something there, and the Capo\nsaw him, he\u2019d come rushing over with a club or something and give them a good old\nclubbing. And I, | couldn't speak whatever language they were speaking, so he was\nobviously telling the bloke that he wanted to speak to the British soldiers.\nAnd it was some time later when we actually managed to get into odd buildings |\nlooked up that had been put empty, that what they do, that one or two of the Jews\nmight get in there. Or in one case, | went to go in a place where there, a couple of\nGreek Jews, who were carpenters, who were building things for the Germans. And |\nmanaged to get into where they were, and talking to them, but again, you couldn't\nsay much, most of it by sign language, but even after I'd been there a long time,\nmost of the languages we spoke what they called plat-Deutch, again [MUMBLES]\n[DL] And what were the state of the Jews you saw in the factory? When you first\nwalked around the factory, what did you see, what were they wearing, their\ncondition, their complexion, their health?\n[BB] They looked, they didn\u2019t look too bad cause all the bad ones, obviously all the\nbad ones had gone to the crematorium, but | always remember when [COUGH], a\nnew lot arrived, and there was a Jew there, must have been six foot six, and he\nweighed thirty stone at least, and everybody said at the time \u2018cor, ain\u2019t he lucky, how\nbeing so fat\u2019. We saw him again six, could be six months time after that, and he was\nthere, he was still there fit as a fiddle, gone down to eighteen stone or something.",
        "[DL] In terms of the general condition of, of people who were slave labourers in the\nfactory, what was their general condition, their demeanour, er the way in which they\nwalked, erm...\n[BB] Most of them weren't too bad, cause as | said they wouldn't have them down\nthere, but any time they didn\u2019t want them there of course, shoved them off\n[MUMBLES] or got clunked. One time when, | don't know what happened but, | don't\nknow where the Germans were, but there was quite a lot of them went berserk, tried\nto climb the wire, and the Germans just shot them down, that was up the other end\nof the camp, about half a mile away | suppose.\n[DL] Did you see that?\n[BB] No, | heard the gunshots; | didn\u2019t know what it was for\n[DL] And what atrocities did you witness when you were at E715 Auschwitz?\n[BB] [MUMBLES] None really, it was all treatment of the Jews. The worst part as far\nas | was concerned was when the crematoriums were working cause of the wind\nwas in that direction, the smell of the crematoriums, that was erm, sickly and\nunbelievable [COUGHS]\n[DL] You talk about the ill treatment of the Jews, what sort of ill treatment did you see\nwhen you were there?\n[BB] Mainly that...the...er...Capos, the Germans never needed to bother them much.\nEverything was left to the Capos, most of the Capos were...\n[00:40:00]\n[BB] ...very unpleasant, and er wouldn't talk to us, and er, and the only times, once\nwhen \u2014 and this story is about in three different books, told by three different people\n[MUMBLES, LAUGHS], | got to know, very slightly, er, two French Jews, who came\nfrom, both of them lawyers, they came from Toulouse. One could speak just a little\nbit of English maybe understand, but it was difficult, and erm, | think the second, the\nsecond day | actually spoke to them, he came in and he had, under his uniform, his\njacket he had a, an old, torn jersey, and all this bits missing in the front of here, and |\nremember at the barracks, | had a piece of knitted material about that size, and |\nthought that would do then fine, it'll fit nicely over there. | tried to explain to him when\n| saw him the next day, what it was for, and they were pleased to have it, and | said\n\u2018if you Know anyone who can knit, you can strip it all down and knit it all up\u2019. But\nanyway, the following morning, his brother came in on his own, and er, | asked him\nwhere his brother was, he said \u2014 | don\u2019t know what he said but | found out afterwards\n\u2014 he was telling me he was in a box about two foot square, about two foot high, and\nthey had to spend the day in there. The Capo, he'd put it through the Germans when\nthey got back that they\u2019d got this bit of material, [MUMBLES], and er, | thought well\nlll see him the following day when | come back, but unfortunately that day I'd got\nmoved onto another job and | never saw them again.",
        "[DL] And in terms of the gas chambers themselves, how did you know when people\nwere sent to the gas chambers? Did the Jews tell you \u2014 and if so how did they let\nyou know?\n[BB] The main gas chambers were of course about two miles away, and the main\ncrematorium part, cause I\u2019d never seen it, never known it had existed, it wasn't till the\nBBC took me there years later that | went actually round it, but we weren't allowed to\ngo that part there, but er...\n[DL] | think what I\u2019m asking you, in the book you recalled you would sometimes ask\nwhere so-and-so was, and there would be a response that the Jews would then give\nyou to explain that the individuals had been sent to the gas chambers.\n[BB] That\u2019s right.\n[DL] What, how did they actually tell you if...\n[BB] [MUMBLES], ask where they were, and we used to say without a soap and\ntowel, and they used to nod their heads, course when they went to the gas chamber,\nthey thought they were going for a shower, which they were but it wasn\u2019t the right\nkind of shower.\n[DL] And in terms of conditions for yourself at E715 Auschwitz, what were conditions\nlike for yourselves?\n[BB] Fairly good, | was, and we had our own sick bay, and er, and I, | only spent\nonce in the sick bay, | had er, something, something wrong with my stomach, | can't\nremember what it was all, now, and er, that was when we got bombed and er, erm,\nthirty eight people got killed. Course the doctor came round, asked me if | was fit to\ndo something, he said, \u201cgood,\u201d he said \u201cwe got to open up the other part of the sick\nbay, which wasn't in use, find some beds and that, for the wounded [MUMBLES],\nand | spent the day at, sorting the wounded out.\n[DL] And that was the bombing raid of 1944?\n[BB] August 44 yeah\n[DL] August 1944, and what was the reaction of the British POWs after the bombing\nraid had happened?\n[00:45:01]\n[BB] [MUMBLES], well if there was any reaction, | think there was a bit of argument\nabout whether it was the Americans or the British had bombed us, but | think it was\nthe Americans, but er. Cause they, | don\u2019t Know, we was, we always knew when our\nfactory was going to be bombed, cause of the limits that the planes could fly, they\ncouldn't go any, there was nowhere to go, erm, and they erm, used to come over\nand bomb, bomb, bomb the factory, and very rarely hit the factory, they hit the woods\nround the factory. The first time we got erm, we got bombed, erm, | was erm | bloody\nwell can\u2019t remember what | was doing, there was a big pipe there, around about six\nfoot, really big pipe, you could just about stand up in it and erm, | thought I\u2019d be safer\nin there so | went into the pipe when they were bombing and the pipe moved once or",
        "twice as it vibrated so to speak and er when | came out couldn't find any bombing,\nthey had bombed all the factory, all the woods and had missed the factory\ncompletely. So after that, if there was any bombing then | would just stay in the\nfactory, by then they built some shelters in the factory for the Germans to go in but\nwe used to sneak in as well but we got turned back once or twice by the Germans\nwho said it was for them and not for us (laughs).\n[DL] And how close was E/15 Auschwitz and how close were you to the actual\nconcentration camp?\n[BB] About three miles. There was a local work camp which was about two to three\nhundred yards on the other side of the field next to us.\n[DL] And the work camp, did you ever witness any abuses happening there, in terms\nof...\n[BB] | never heard anything, the only noise we ever got there was when they\nmarched off to work in the morning, they used to have a band playing. So, when they\nleft to come to work and they used to be at work by the time we had got out of our\ncamp and gone but they had to come past the entrance to our camp to get into the\nfactory.\n[DL] So, what time would that be, normally in the morning?\n[BB] Dawn\n[DL] Dawn. And on one occasion, you did mention to me about makeshift gallows\nwhich you saw?\n[BB] Oh, yes, in the field, between the erm, there was one with about four (pauses)\nyeah, one was empty | think, there were four blokes hanging there and er | don't\nknow who they were, they look like civilians.\n[DL] So, were they Jews or were they...\n[BB] | don\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t have any, they didn\u2019t have their name on to tell you\nwhat they are.\n[DL] How many hours did, in your estimation, did the concentration camp victims\nactually work for in IG Farben? Did they receive any breaks, what was their\ntreatment like in your estimation?\n[BB] What, the Jews?\n[DL] Yes.\n[BB] Well, again, they used to disappear around about lunchtime and, of course,\nwhen we started there we got er big erm canisters full of soup and the first one |\nopened, it stank so much that | just couldn't err drink or eat it. You see like erm\nbrown cabbage leaf and things like that floating about in it. And er the first lot we got\nwe just tipped out and sent the cans back and, of course, we found it very, talking to,\nsomebody was talking to the Jews and they said the Jews would drink it. From then",
        "on we got our cans and we didn't take it to the Jews we just left it so that the Jews\ncould find them, they could come and take a look and the Jews had them.\n[00:49:57]\n[DL] Brian, I\u2019m just going to check. Was there any sound issues with that, Chris?\n(Camera: Yes, he was just covering up the mic). Okay, if you could just repeat the\nstory you just told me with the cans with the soup because there may have been a\nsound issue with that. So, what did you do with the cans with the soup?\n[BB] Well, we opened them and we just couldn't, well, we couldn't, they just\nabsolutely stank (coughs) and erm so somebody said they had given theirs to the\nJews so that\u2019s what we did. We left them in a place where the Jews could find them\nand we would go back later and get the empty ones so we knew they had them and\nwe used to do that every day then because we weren't going to do it. We were told\nonce that somebody had been up near the cookhouse where they made it and they\u2019d\nseen erm one of the Jew girls who worked up the cookhouse had opened up one of\nthe cans and had peed in it and er, and er, | said to the bloke who had told me, do\nyou know which can it was because it would taste better than ones we had.\n[DL] Did you believe that as a story?\n[BB] No (laughs) | don\u2019t know if he saw it or not but | thought it would be funny if he\nhad.\n[DL] Because that strikes me as being a very black sense of humour, was there a\nblack sense of humour, if you can describe it as humour?\n[BB] Well, | don\u2019t think any of us had senses of humour actually.\n[DL] Why, why do you say that?\n[BB] | don\u2019t know. There wasn\u2019t much you could be funny about, could you? You'd\nsay a lot of things that were stupid rather than laughable.\n[DL] And would that, the story which you've just chosen there, would you class that\nas one of those stupid stories which...\n[BB] | don\u2019t Know, it was just what the bloke said to me and that\u2019s what my answer\nwas so | never gave any thought then, or since, whether it was stupid or funny\nbecause | don\u2019t think it\u2019s stupid and that was it.\n[DL] How did the British try to help the Jews, | appreciate you've just spoken about\nthe soup you would leave for them but were there other areas where you tried to\nhelp the Jews by providing cigarettes or any other sort of support.\n[BB] Well, the cigarettes, we needed them ourselves and of course we had only got\nthem in our parcels and erm we always wanted them for trading so | have no idea\nwhere Avey said he had got all of the cigarettes from to give to that Jewish Capo,\nwell, | just don't believe it.\n[DL] And the Red Cross parcels which you would receive, how frequently would you\nreceive them and what difference did they make?",
        "[BB] Well, that varied a lot. Sometimes we got one a week and sometimes we got\none between two and, in Italy, it was worse. | think one time we got one between\neight but the idea of one between eight with only about ten items in the box (laughs).\n[DL] And did you use the Red Cross parcels to then barter for additional food in the\nfactory?\n[BB] Mainly in the factory, yeah. Things | used to trade in was like in chocolate so I'd\nsay to people there, tins of something for a bar of chocolate and then I'd take the\nchocolate down the factory and barter that.\n[DL] That would be bartering with civilian employees.\n[BB] With civilians, yeah, Germans and Poles. Mainly Poles (coughs)\n[DL] And civilians, they were from nearby villages?\n[BB] | presume they were, | don\u2019t know where they come from but they could be very\nhelpful in some ways and | bought things off them and traded with them when |\ncould. Language troubles were always the trouble cause er most of them when they\nspoke to you spoke....\n[00:55:01]\n[BB] in a mixture of plat-Deutch, which was a mixture of German and Polish. |\nsuppose they got used to it over the years of using it and we couldn't understand.\n[DL] How many civilians were employed in the actual factory?\n[BB] Cor, blimey, I\u2019ve got no idea. Couple of hundred, perhaps.\n[DL] And the food which you obtained at IG Farben, how did you smuggle that back\ninto your camp?\n[BB] With difficulty. Well, the main things | used to bring back were either bread or\neggs. Eggs, | managed to get elastic bands from somewhere, and | used to put the\neggs down in my socks, near my ankles, with elastic bands holding them in place\naround my ankles and | could get five or six eggs in each leg, assuming | could buy\nthat many legs, | could only normally buy one or two and bread. Of course | was\npretty slim and the loaves were long and tapered at the ends and | used to have one\neach side of my stomach and to get about | used to hold them tight as | had a flat\nstomach, not what I\u2019ve got now, and the only thing that used to amuse me was |\nused to think what people would think of the bottom end \u2014 what it tasted like! But\nnobody complained so.\n[DL] In terms of the makeshift radio in the camp, were you aware of the British\nhaving made a makeshift radio?\n[BB] Well, | think, | don\u2019t think there was one in our camp. | think there was one in the\nE715 camp and | know there was one in the top camp in Italy. There was one in\nthere as well.",
        "[DL] Sorry, to clarify that, you're saying that there wasn't a radio at E715 or that there\nwas?\n[BB] Well, | don\u2019t Know of one in my camp but in the other camp, down the road,\nsomebody told me that there was one. (Coughs)\n[DL] Obviously you\u2019re saying there was a difference between the camp you were in\nand the other camp in terms of the actual name. The naming of the camps. So, one\nbeing E715 and the other which...\n[BB] Well, they both had the same name because when | was in the other camp it\nwas E715 because I\u2019ve still got letters which I\u2019ve got at home. Well, which I\u2019ve got\nhere which has got E/15 on. Then when | moved up the other camp, they still come\nthrough as E/15.\n[DL] The weather which you experienced when you were over in Poland, in\nAuschwitz, there was intense cold during the winter months.\n[BB] Yeah, it was.\n[DL] How did you cope and how did the British try to help the Jews who were\nworking in the factory in the intense cold.\n[BB] Well, nobody tried to help. What we did down in the factory is erm to get some\nof these old oil drums and we dug holes in the side and then scouted every bit of\nwood we could and then after a time, unfortunately, everybody's trousers down here\nhad gone rotten and of course they'd bend their knee and it'll all split and of course\nwe had a room in the camp where blokes were repairing trousers all day and then\nyou'd take your trousers in there and get them repaired and then you'd walk around\nwith patches on the knees of your trousers.\n[DL] We've already touched on the soup which the Nazis supplied. Did the Nazis\nsupply any other type of food to you?\n[BB] Yeah. The erm, a cheese that was er was tasted awful and er what else did we\nused to get? You'd get some bread, oh no, that was when we were in Austria they\ncame up with some loaves of bread only small, grey, and the date on them was 1938\nwith letters on the side and we'd be given one of them each and we'd cut them up...\n[01:00:00]\n...to make sandwiches or something and they were absolutely sodden and we'd\ntoast the bread to dry it out and, no, what was the darn stuff, no, I\u2019ve forgotten.\n[DL] You didn't play football as some of the others did\n[BB] No, no football in our camp, no room in our camp, in camp 1 or what you call\n711 because on the side of the field sloped up there and they played football up\nthere and it wasn\u2019t until | was talking to Doug Bond, years after the war, that | even\nknew that they had played football down there and that Charlie Coward had got\nEnglish football jerseys to play in. That was all knew to me. You know, twenty to\nthirty years after the war.",
        "[DL] You didn't play football then. But you did go running. There was a running track\nthere?\n[BB] Yes, that was the same place they went round the field. When | was first there,\nit must have been before Christmas and er somebody suggested we just run around\nand they reckon four times round the field was a mile and | reckon | ran around it\ntwice or something and then packed up but one bloke went around 1/7 times\n(laughs).\n[DL] How else did you spend your time when you weren't at IG Farben? So how else\ndid you spend your time \u2014 what sort of things did you do at E715 Auschwitz?\n[BB] Well, we had er a bridge club in our hut. Well, it depends whose about and\nwho's there to play but if we had enough players to play then we'd play bridge.\n[DL] You ended up in the POWs\u2019 hospital during your imprisonment at E715\nAuschwitz \u2014 why did you end up there and what were conditions like there?\n[BB] Very good. We had a doctor, | know his name, it\u2019s on all my papers but | can't\nremember what his name is now. But he was in the South African army but he was\nan Englishman.\n[DL] You say conditions were \u201cvery good,\u2019 the documents show that there were\nissues Surrounding conditions within the hospital itself and certainly in terms of the\nNazis coming round to ensure that those who they deemed fit to work would then go\nto the factory to work. Did you find that in your experience?\n[BB] Well, what, we had a sick list every morning with how many he was allowed to\nhave on his sick list. But if his sick list didn\u2019t meet the quantity he was allowed then\none or two blokes who weren't sick used to join the list to make the number up. But,\ner, | never did that anyway.\n[DL] What actually happened at the start of 1945 as the Russians approached?\n[BB] Well, we could hear the guns in the distance and someone said it was fifty miles\naway and what distance it was | don\u2019t know but we were, all the Jews were being\nmoved out and going by us and goodness knows where they were going and\neventually we all got rounded up and made a big column and |, well, er, you got our\nroute, | gave you the route of where our column was, | kept the places all there\nwhere we stopped at.\n[01:05:00]\n[DL] And the Jews when they walked past you. How continuous was this line?\n[BB] Oh goodness knows how many there was or where they were coming from.\n[DL] But was it a continuous column of people that were walking past you for hours\nor days?\n[BB] Oh, no, | think they were smaller groups than that. They went past us for 15 to\n20 minutes | suppose and that'll be it and then later another load would go past and\nthey might be bigger or smaller. We never took much notice other than to wonder",
        "how the hell they were going to manage. And, of course, when we left, we went the\nsame route as they did for a part and, of course, all along the sides there was bodies\nlying everywhere and obviously they had just died and been thrown up onto the bank\nor whatever. | mean we never stopped to look to see if they were dead, we just\npresumed they were dead. I'd be surprised if they weren't anyway but we were so\ncold and we all ended up with frostbit (coughs) and | got frostbite in my feet and lost\nmy toenails on my right foot and my right foot still isn\u2019t right. The toenail doesn\u2019t grow\nproperly.\n[DL] And what was the feeling among your fellow POWs from E715 Auschwitz when\nyou were sent on this march, what was the collective feeling at that point?\n[BB] | think the collective feeling at that point was to get away from the Russians\nbecause we heard rumours that Russians had, some POWs had got down there to\nthe Russians and all the Russians had done is shot them. Now whether that was true\nor not we didn\u2019t know but from everything we heard about the Russians then it most\nlikely was but | met some Russians once inside the camp and | don\u2019t know what they\nwere doing there and they obviously were (coughs) prisoners but they seemed to be\nable to wonder around where they liked, the same as a lot of the women Russians.\nThey were able to wonder around wherever they like. In fact, | didn\u2019t get to know to\nspeak to but (mumbles) one of them was the strongest women | had ever seen. In\nfact, someone told me that in the Russian Army she was a gun loader on one of the\nbig guns.\n[DL] What evidence did you see along the way that the Jews were taking the same\nroute that you were taking?\n[BB] Only about the first couple of days and | don\u2019t know where they went but we\nwent off in a different direction.\n[DL] And how many bodies do you estimate in those first few days?\n[BB] Oh, | have no idea. It must have been in the hundreds anyway.\n[DL] And were there any preparations made for this march at all? In terms of..\n[BB] No, we just grabbed our stuff. Of course the trouble was, we had to move out as\nthe Russians had bombed our camp and had dropped Molotov cocktails on it and my\nbuilding that | lived in got burnt to the ground and even then you could smell the oil in\nour clothes where it had splattered all over the place and of course then they\nrounded us up the next morning and marched us off and that was it.\n[DL] How did you actually survive during the long march? You spoke about getting\ncolic at one point.\n[BB] Oh, yes, well, that was my fault. Entirely my fault. Bloody stupid.\n[DL] Could you explain what happened?\n[BB] Well, we stopped at this sugar beet factory and we couldn't find anything to eat\nand there was nothing there....",
        "[01:10:00]\n[BB] often you would get to these places and find bags of potatoes or something\nespecially if you stopped at a farm but this place there was nothing but sugar beet so\nsomebody reckoned you could cook sugar beet which was fairly common and so we\nfound this big metal things (mumbles), what are they called?\n[DL] Pots? Large metal pots?\n[BB] Big round things, use them in cookers as well, big tub in the top, they\u2019ve got a\nname but | can\u2019t remember what they\u2019re called. Anyway, we got one of these and\nused to use them with potatoes and boil them and somebody would, half the time,\npotatoes would have gone to mash and a bloke would be that cold that he would use\ntwo hands to plough in and put them into the tub that you'd feed out of. This time\nthough we had the sugar beat and | was dishing it out and er everybody was happy\nand when we got down to the very bottom we only got some juice and that down the\nbottom and everybody had gone to sleep so | thought, we ain't going to waste that,\nso | found something and drunk the lot. | felt alright. Then the following morning we\nall marched off and the more we marched the more pain | got and then | couldn't\nstand it any longer and | was curled up as a ball in the grass when the doctor came\nalong and | couldn't straighten myself out so they forced me out straight and they got\ntwo of their biggest blokes to walk beside me and they couldn't hold me up so they\ntold my hands to the back of the horse and cart that the Germans used for and | was\nforced to walk that way for hours and | can't really remember much about it |\nsuppose and in the end | seemed to be walking normally and | was allowed to go.\nEverybody was passing me and | was lagging behind and | was ended up and\neverybody had gone and | ended up walking down the road on my own and ended\nup in some little village and the only thing | remember about the village was two\nroads around you and you'd got a green down the middle so you had two roads and |\nhad to go to the lavvy and so | dropped my trousers in the middle of the road and |\nnever done so much in my life, it was great big piles of the blinking sugar beat. And\nthen the civilians came out and | could hear blokes chattering and | went down into a\nbuilding and a bloke upstairs said, \u201cHey, I\u2019ve saved a place for you!\u201d So | climbed up\nto where he was and the following day | was alright. | don\u2019t know what would have\nhappened in the doctor hadn\u2019t made me, | suppose | would have just laid there and\ndied.\n[DL] What was the atmosphere with the guards like on this march?\n[BB] Oh, that was good. One time when | was walking along there and | was frozen,\nsuddenly, this guy come along there and he had a big handful of snow. | didn\u2019t know\nwhat he was going to do, | don't think he noticed, he just smacked me in the face\nwith it. | thought, \u201cWhat the bloody hell did he do that for?\u201d And one of the chaps\nsaid, \u201cYour nose had gone white,\u201d he said. So he was being helpful.\n[DL] What happened to the horse with the horse and cart?\n[BB] That got into such a state of health they killed it. I've heard loads of different\nstories about it. I\u2019m sure that a couple of chaps who used to work in the butchery\nwent behind a barn and cut its throat....",
        "[01:15:00]\n[BB] but | read other stories that said it was shot but | never saw it happen and |\nnever heard any shots so anyway when it came round the following day we got some\nsoup which wasn't that bad but | don\u2019t know where all the heart, lungs and other bits\nwent or who got them.\n[DL] How many miles a day did you roughly travel and did the weather conditions\nactually improve for yourselves?\n[BB] Weather changed day by day but it wasn\u2019t so bad when it got a bit warmer. But\nit is difficult now to remember.\n[DL] When were you finally freed by Allied soldiers.\n[BB] We got down into Bavaria and we were staying in a big barn (laughs) which was\nquite nice grand, but | and another chap managed to get up into the loft and it was\nfull of clothing and we, I\u2019ve still got the jacket somewhere, anyway, when we got\nback to England it was all taken away from us and we were there some day and we\nsaw this small little tank coming across the field towards us and it was the Americans\nand all the chaps wanted to know was if they had some sweets on the tank so they\ngave us some sweets and cleared off again. Later the doctor told us to stay where\nwe are and not to try to head for home as quite a few fellows | think did and quite a\nfew said, oh, I\u2019m not going to stay here and started to head for home but | stayed\nthere and then of course the Americans come around with their Dakotas and flew us\ndown to France.\n[DL] When was that? The month.\n[BB] After the war finished.\n[DL] So was that April or May 1945?\n[BB] That would have been April 1945\n[DL] April 1945 and the march started in January.\n[BB] End of April as | got home on May the 12th\n[DL] When you arrived home how did people react towards you, did you ever tell\npeople that you had been to E715 Auschwitz?\n[BB] No, the er, they knew | had been a POW there but | never bragged about that. |\ndon't think there was anything to be proud about at all and the following day after |\ngot home we had a big bonfire in the road and that was it.\n[DL] Did you suffer from any psychiatric problems based on what you had seen\nwhilst you were at Auschwitz?\n[BB] Well, | must have done because | had my six weeks leave and | had to report\nback to a camp at Haywards Heath and there they had to bring us up to date on\ndrillings and such and they had young lads there who had been in the army for six\nmonths telling us all how to fire a bren gun and how to dismantle a bren gun and, of",
        "course, we werent interested, we knew how to do it, we'd done it enough times\nbefore but we did it but we didn't do it fast enough or at least that\u2019s what the young\nNCOs said, mumbles, | remember one time when we had to through all hand\ngrenades into a big net and | threw all mine in, six in, and okay the bloke after me,\ncaught the edge and fell out. He got failed.\n[01:20:00]\n[DL] The psychiatric issues which you experienced after the war, what actually\nhappened when you were discharged from the army? Were you medically\ndischarged from the army?\n[BB] | was medically discharged.\n[DL] And why were you medically discharged?\n[BB] | can explain that to you when | was at this place and in days off we would go\ndown to Brighton for the day and get a train back from Brighton was at half past nine\nat night and, of course, we had never been ready to come home by then so wed find\nout the first train out in the morning, sleep on that, go back the following day.\nAnyway, someone reported me anyway and someone said the trickcyclist wanted to\nsee me so anyway | thought what the bloody hell is a trickcyclist? | never bloody well\nheard of one. So, of course, | went along there because it was a psychiatrist | had to\nsee and he was a big fat Jew he was. He must have weighed about twenty stone,\nsitting there, and he asked me how | felt and things like that, and | said, | feel fine\nand as far as I\u2019m concerned there\u2019s nothing wrong with me and he said I\u2019m going to\nsend you to hospital for a month to get yourself sorted out and | said alright and sent\nme then to Southern hospital in Dartford, Kent, the asylum was next door and\nanyone who didn\u2019t get better went over the wall and into the asylum. There | did\neverything wrong that | should have done, of course | didn\u2019t realise it, so | would go\nto see what a job was then wait until nobody was looking and clear off and then walk\naround the woods.\n[DL] You describe your psychiatrist as a big fat Jew quote unquote \u2014 why do you say\nthat? What makes you say that?\n[BB] Well, I'm surprised to see him there he was so bulky.\n[DL] But, how did you know he was Jewish?\n[BB] He had a Jewish face, he looked Jewish, he might not have been Jewish then. |\nthought he was. Sounded like a Jew.\n[DL] Did you ever actually go back to Auschwitz?\n[BB] Yes, | went back to Auschwitz with the BBC didn't I?\n[DL] When was that when you went back to Auschwitz?\n[BB] Well, you know that better than | do. Six years ago?",
        "[DL] It was round about six years ago. When you went back to Auschwitz with the\nBBC what was your feelings when you were there? How did you feel when you were\nthere?\n[BB] | had no feelings when | was there. | had an enjoyable three days and visiting,\nof course, | went around all the parts of the crematorium and all part of the complex\nwhich | knew existed but | had never seen before, of course it would have been,\nweren't there as public viewers so we got there at seven o'clock in the morning and\nof course we went round and saw everything \u2014 just the three of us and as the\ntrippers were coming at nine o'clock, we cleared off.\n[DL] Do you feel that you have ever been haunted by what you saw when you were\nat Auschwitz?\n[BB] No. | don't think so.\n[DL] Yet you would have witnessed atrocities in the factory itself you would have\nseen, as you said earlier about the people hanging from the gallows, you would have\nheard about the gas chambers, you would have smelt the crematoria, were you ever\nhaunted by that?\n[BB] No. It was not as bad as seeing your mate lying in a field, shot up with all his\nguts falling out in his hands. To me, that is far worse than seeing some Jew who died\nthrough exhaustion or something. Now that does upset me, still does, but things like\nthat never bothered me at all. | lost too many friends. That's what annoys me with\nthe modern things....\n[01:25:00]\n[BB] Everyone who dies abroad gets brought back to England in a coffin. All we did\nwith them was dig a hole in the sand, say \u2018Good luck, mate\u2019 and fill them in again.\nOften as not, of course it being sand, couldn't find a bit of stick to mark where they\nare, unless they've gone down there with a machine to mark the bodies then they're\nstill lying there now. Things like that really annoy me and when you read about the\nway people are treated, when we came home, no-one cared if you were alive or\ndead now they\u2019re all made a fuss of.\n[DL] Did anyone care about your experiences at E715 Auschwitz?\n[BB] No. Nobody knew | had been there until something had cropped up and the only\npeople | spoke to were the chaps | knew who | used to write to and in hospital they\ntold me, | had been in hospital for two months, which | didn\u2019t want as | wanted to do\nmore time than my father did and when | left there | went to say goodbye to the staff\nnurse and she wished me good luck and said that when | went in there | was the\nmost ill mannered pig she had ever met in her life and | looked at her in amazement\nand wondered in what way was | ill mannered? | didn\u2019t ask her | was just so\nflabbergasted at what she said so | think there must have been something wrong\nwith me and | didn\u2019t know what it was.\n[DL] Finally what did you go on to do for the rest of your life?",
        "[BB] When | was discharged from the army they asked if | wanted to go on a course\nand | went to South West Essex Technical college for six months to learn about\nelectronics and from there | did every job imaginable for electronics until | retired\neven up manager level, | was a manager when | retired at 65.\n[DL] When did you retire?\n[BB] 65\n[DL] What year, do you remember?\n[BB] 1985\n[DL] Is there anything you want to add, Brian?\n[BB] No, I\u2019ve said too much already.\n[01:25:00]\nENDS",
