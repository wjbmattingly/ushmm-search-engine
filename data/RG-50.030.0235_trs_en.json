        "A: The Nazi came 1n...in Kovno in the June 22.",
        "Q: Where's your husband?",
        "A: But...but we were taken out of the houses already a day before by the Lithuanian, by the\nsame so-called partisans and they came into the house, took us out on the streets and the...the\nguns, the little ones to the right, hands up, and they brought us to jail. Kept us...all the\npeople, all the parents of my husband were in the house, the cousin and all kind people\ngathered because it was the house I had plenty of food. It was war time. We knew it's going\nto be war and prepared for war and so they thought it will be more...more convenient to be in\nour house, and everybody was taken out and taken to jail. After 3 days, we managed to go\nout...my daughter and myself and also the nanny of my daughter who was a Christian. But\nshe asked for a child so they took her also to the jail. Eh...",

        "A: Yeah. This is was fortation around Kovno there are fortation and the fort seven the ninth, I\ntell these numbers because there were many Jews killed. And they were taken there, and we\nwere by chance let...let out because of the little child. And there on this fort he was killed,\ntogether with my little brother, my father-in-law, my...my cousin. Everybody was killed\nunder terrible conditions. It was terrible conditions. It was a little boy. He was stayed alive\nwho ran away who didn't..mothers...of the women and came back and he told me what was\ngoing on in this fort. And then...uh...I had to move to the ghetto. I must make it short. I must\ntell you I... was so already beaten before the war because the Russians sent my parents, and\nmine oldest brother with his wife to Siberia, and so it...1t was a week before the war broke\nout, and I was very miserable because we heard that the trains were...were bombed and I was\nsure my parents are not alive anymore. And so I was beaten one after the other. I didn't...I\ndidn't believe that my husband was killed and my brother was killed. Somebody told me that\nit's not time to tell the particulars, but I still hoped that they are alive. But I had to move to\nthe ghetto. I was staying in the city a long time because I went to some\npeople...uh...uh...my... with my husband, my late husband was...had connections with the\nLithuanian because he build for the government, they build ...many buildings... .",

        "Q: What was it like for you as a young widow, alone, in the Slobodka ghetto?",
        "A: It was...it was terrible because I...they...everything was taken from me. They...my...my\napartment, my...my money, my jewelry, everything, and I...and I was staying too long in\ntown. Then I couldn't get a room in the ghetto because it was so few dwellings, and then it\nwas terrible. I 'til I by chance, it is a long story, but I shall tell it. I got a little tea room. It was\nhalf a room. It was about 8 meters and then I...1 went around with a...with all the belongings.\nI had to get a cart from the...the Lithuanians were not supposed to...to lend their carts for\nJews. By law, by the German law. But anyway when you paid money you...you got it...we\nhad to go 2 hours to the ghetto. It is...1t was a short, not so far away, but the long route\nthe...uh...the cart we went to the ghetto made it so slowly. And three times I went with the\nbelongings to the ghetto. I didn't have a place to put the things so I put it where\nacquaintances relatives were, so I put it on the...on the courtyard. And then, uh, finally, I got\nin a...got to this little home, and I moved in. This is also a very hard story, that uh could be\ntold another time.",
        "Q: We'll...we'll do another time.",
        "A: Yeah. And then it was a...there was the parents of my brother-in-law, my...my...my sister-in-\nlaw. Yeah. Because...uh...her...and they helped me to get some food, some flour. She is...to\nget some flour and some foods, but it was frightening. In a short time it was gone. And you\nhad...you couldn't have where to put...you didn't get other things. Till they organized and\nuntil they begin to give the food in the ghetto, it took some time, and then it was so ...so, uh,\nlittle. For instance, we got a 120 gram bread a day. And the...uh...there is...you...you couldn't\ndie and you couldn't live on it you see. It was a starvation. It was such starvation, and we had\nto...how to...to get food. So the meaning to get food it was to sell your things, to change it for\nfood. And the...there were brigades. We went out into the street...1nto the city to work. There\nwere little brigades where you could if connections with the Lithuanians, change with them\nyour...your...uh...belongings for food or for money and so you got some food. But you...you\nit was very hard work. You had to go...uh...by foot...about 10...I'm speaking kilometers, 10,\n15 kilometers and then after a day's work, walk back, and with the parcel your... on your\nback. But when I...I did it I was already lucky because I was...I had it already...I could breath\nin food in the ghetto. But it took...it passed a long time til I could go out. And then happened\nthat my...the nanny of my daughter who stayed in the city tried to get connections with me\nand she used to come...uh...where the people worked and send some little parcels for me.",
        "Q: Okay. I'm going to interrupt again.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And let's stop a bit. How did you...when did you met Avraham Tory?",
        "A: This I tell you. This is a connection of this. So but not...nobody...nobody gave it to me.\nEverybody...I1 don't know where the people got it, but they get it. So one day, I knew my\nhusband, Avraham, a long time ago when we were...I was a girl of 15 or so, he came to our\nlittle town to make...he was a Macabi sportsman. And he used to make the little shtetl and in\nall the country, he used to come and make sports speech you know and teach. So to keep\ntogether the Macabi movement. And he came also in our shtetl, so I knew him the first time.\nAnd then I met him even he was my husband...my marriage in my wedding when I married.\nAnd I was also in his wedding when he married because my parents were someway\nconnected to them. I don't remember how. But I was not aware of him at all that he's in the\nghetto, and I had no connection with him. But then one day he came in and he tells me...and\nbrings me a little parcel from the nanny. It was...was wonderful. There was bread and a little\npiece of butter and...uh... and salad or something, and he tells me that what told him that he\nwas several times here and sent parcels and she never got any news from me. So this was the\nfirst trme I knew him, I saw him again, but and he was very much pressed...or so pressed\nwhat he saw there, how I lived. It's already cool and it was...1t was already. It was terrible. I\nlooked terrible because I...my little...little room, I took in my cousin because she didn't find\nplace...place, so I took her in and when my...her brother also my cousin, came to...to us to eat\nbecause...but we couldn't eat together. One went out and the other one could come in.",
        "Q: Okay. When did you start helping. I'm sorry. I'm going to have to keep doing this I'm afraid.\nWhen did you start helping Avraham with the diary?",
        "A: So this was...yeah...this was after a...quite awhile further. I didn't know he writes something.\nHe didn't tell of...he didn't tell anybody. And...uh...but when...then I...[ moved then to another\nplace because they took away the house...the...the Committee, the Council took away the\nhouse for the German...uh...Arbeiter. This was German work department. So...so we are\ngiven other place. It also was a..a house opposite the Council, the...the building of the\nCouncil. So and he used to come...he was already interested in me. He told me you can get\nthis. You can...like other persons on the Committee and... He was interested how I'm going\non.",
        "Q: Yeah. Please. I really have to stop you. I'm sorry. Please. Follow my lead.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. I want to ask you very specific questions.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you give me very specific answers. Okay? Just because we're short and it's not right, but\nI have to do it this way. When did you...when did you start physically helping Avraham with\nthe diary.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah. I tell it. It was in about 42, from my new apartment opposite him, the Council. I\ncame one day out, and I saw him coming against me and I said hello and he...he was very,\nvery grave so my...very much grave, and he told me, \"Look, Pnina, I want to ask you\nsomething.\" \"What's on your mind.\" \"I write a diary and I can't keep it with me and I want\nyou to...to...to keep...to hide it for me, to keep it in your place because I can't keep it in my\nplace. And not in the Council. I was a...to once I was very much astonished you know, but I\nthought he was so grave and he repeated I can't keep it in...at my place.\" So I said, \"Hello.\nThis... I was very interested to hear that he writes a a diary. So I said, \"Of course, I shall do\nit.\" And then he had to say to me, \"You know it is very dangerous.\" I said, uh, \"Alright. I\nadmit.. I know. I understand. Everything is dangerous in this place.\" And so he brought me\nin the first pages, and then he used to send me...when he writing in the...the Council, we had\na...a messenger, a boy of 10, 11 years, maybe older. Yankele ' was his name, so he used to\nbring me all the...the papers and they...he begin to came in the evenings and write. What he\ndidn't he finished he tried at my place and...uh...so it begin after while.",
        "Q: Did you write...did you take dictation for him for awhile.",
        "A: Ya. Yes. When he was very tired and he wanted to give up, so I said, \"All right, I shall write\nand I...he dictated and I wrote the papers. And then I hid it..it in...my room afterwards. It\nbegan to be too dangerous and the...I used ...I used to take all these papers...these written\npapers when it was finished and I brought it up upstairs to an attic __. There was...how you\ncall it in English...you know from from straw, not straw, but I...I.. forget now you call it,\nbut I used to bury it under this. It was in a ...1n a corner. It was a place where nobody came.\nAnd ...uh...then...then afterwards we saw one day I used to go up on this attic when I hide the\n' This refers to Yankele Bergman, an eleven year old messenger boy for the Council and close\nfriend of Avraham Tory, Pnina's husband.\npapers. I put it a pile of laundry. I put it...as if I go to hang laundry there. And ...but we didn't\nhave a staircase. It was you know a ladder. (Laughing) So once I...I slipped and everything\nfell down, and so I was so frightened. I looked around. Nobody was...I put it again and after\nthis, after this time we thought what to do and so we built in the...1n the where it was water\ncloset...it was in the water closet...closet. We...be...behind we made a second door such a\nsmall and then I used to put in the papers not to have to go all the time on the attic.",
        "Q: Okay. When you were ready to leave to the ghetto, how did you and Avraham escape from\nthe ghetto with Elkanan Elkes' last letter? When did you get Elkanan Elkes's last letter?",
        "A: Yeah. Elke...the last letter of Dr. Elkes got Avraham. I was already on the...in the country\nbecause we took out our daughter and she got ill. And I was not supposed to go there. It was\nagainst of the will of the priest, our savior. He... was very sorry to do it, but I...I knew a ill\nchild can't survive in...in the country and I didn't know how...how good the people were.\nThey were very ..so...so I went out to be of the...and stayed there. To cut a long story short,\nI stayed there and then after several months, I begin to beg him to...to...to bring Avraham\nthere. And this was a young boy there of 20 that wanted very much to study so I told him,\n\"You...Look, he's a lawyer and he'll teach you everything,\" and this...1t was the thing that\nbrought him to speak to his mother to bring...to bring Avraham. And so it is long story of the\nescape, SO...",

        "A: We don't...we don't have time for it.",
        "Q: No. I want you to stop. Yeah.",

And, of course...uh....I think Avraham will tell you about it.",
        "Q: No. I don't want Avraham's story. I want your story.",
        "A: Yeah. And so... Yes. So he...when he got the letter. Yeah. He got then the letter from Dr.\nElkanan Elkes.

And with this letter he came ...he went out and with this letter he came,\nand he waited all the time this letter.",
        "Q: But how did you get the letter?",
        "A: When we out from...we are going with the Brichah, fled from...from Lithuanian, and so we\ntook the letter with us together with all the documents we took out from the earth, the crates.\nAnd all the time my husband kept the letter with him in his...uh.... But when we are within\none borderline and the Russian were...were hitting us, terribly shaking, and I saw they are\ntaking all the written things of they take away And then Avraham saw it...",
        "Q: All right.\n* Dr. Leib Garfunkel, a widely respected attorney in Kovno's Jewish community.",
        "A: He came to me and he said, \"Look what is going happen.\" And he took out his...the\nletter...letter and he gave it to me. I picked up my dress...",
        "Q: Don't touch your microphone. Stop. I need you to stop. I need you to physically stop.\nAlright. I want to... Would you please take your hands and just put them here like this. No.\nDon't touch that.",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: One moment please.",
        "Q: Take some water. Relax. Uh...John, or whoever's on the controls, would you just tell the\nfront desk to please look out for Mr. Tory. Thank you, Dear. Alright. Now, I want you to tell\nme what happened. Start from the beginning. When Avraham came to you with the letter,\nexactly physically what you did.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah. I...he took...went aside a little bit.",
        "Q: No. Say the, just say, Avraham gave me the letter and then tell me what you did with it.",
        "A: Yeah. So he took out the letter and gave it to me and he said, \"I am afraid they are going to\ntake it way.\" I pulled up my dress and put it in my bra....the...the letter on my body and...and\nthey checked us, but they didn't check me like that. And so...and the ...so I came over with\nthe letter. But I was so sweating, the letter was damp afterwards.",
        "Q: How did you get out with the letter? How did you...where did you physically go?",
        "A: Oh, we went a long way. We went afterwards to...to the Czechoslovakia and from\nCzechoslovakia we went to Hungary and then to Rumania. In Rumania, we're supposed to\ngo by boat to Israel. We had already certificates, but then I... I can't tell you the story but we\nhad to run away because the Russian heard about it, that there are people from... from Russia\nfrom the...from the Baltic States going on the boat, so we had to run away back and went\nback to Hungary, back to...uh...Austria (coughing)...sorry...and then we came to...on the\nborder of Austria and Italy and there we passed a border. We were of the Jewish Brigade,\nand this was a wonderful thing what happened to us. It was like coming to _. It was\nwonderful. We can never forget it. After all what happened to us...to us, this was the most\nwonderful thing what happened to us. And then...then in the north of Italy, I wrote to Joel\nElkes,\u2019 Dr. Elkes, so they sent me the letter. So...",
        "Q: Your letter then was mailed from Italy?\n* Dr. Joel Elkes is the son of Dr. Elkanan Elkes.",
        "A: From Italy. Yeah. Yeah. In. .",
        "Q: And you...you kept it on your body during that whole trip?",
        "A: Yeah. Whole trip. Yeah. And I sweated from fear, you know. It was such a fear. I was very\nmuch afraid to...this letter. I don't really remember how I mailed it. I think I...1 mailed it\nthrough military mail because we had the...there was no mail, but we had this Brigade\nsoldiers and I...I found a way of to mail it.",
        "Q: That's quite a story, that escape.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah. But this letter is just a wonderful letter. It is a historic letter and I couldn't get\nover to not...to not to bring it to its destiny. And...uh...and so were the other...the other\ndocuments. It was very also in the same place. We had to smuggle through the bundle of the\ndocuments. And it was a miracle we succeeded it. Just a miracle. When I think about it so\n(laughing).",
        "Q: Okay. Let's stop a minute because I want to ask the control room a question. Uh...Can you\nStop tape.",
        "Q: We have...Okay. Tell me when. Okay. Good. We have the key points now on tape and now\nwe have 15 more minutes so we some more reason so we can go back. Okay, we're going to\ngo back a little bit because we have a little more time.",
        "A: Yeah. What do you want me...to hear...",
        "Q: What I'd like to hear are...uh...uh...when you were helping Avraham escape with the letter,\nwe can...we can slow down a little bit now. Uh...When Avraham came with the letter, did\nyou read it?",
        "A: The . .the yeah. Of course, I read it. .I. .read it. [ it. I knew about it.",
        "Q: Alright. Let's...let's go back because you are on tape now. Uh...Let me rephrase the question.\nWhen Avraham came with Elkes's last letter, you read the letter. What was your reaction to\nthe letter?",
        "A: It was . .| was very emotional. It was very emotional.",
        "Q: Did you know Dr. Elkes?",
        "A: Oh, yes. I knew him very well. I knew him as a doctor, and I knew him as a...as a head of\nthe...the ghetto.",
        "Q: Could you tell us about what you know about Dr. Elkes? How you saw him as a person?\nOkay. And would you use his name?",
        "A: Yeah. Dr. Elkes was...first of all, he was...he was an outstanding doctor. My parents were\nalways his patients. Coming from the little town to..to him, and he was now...and he was\nnow a director of the of the hospital, the Jewish hospital. And then in the ghetto\neverybody honored him, and everybody admired him because he was above...above...above\nall you see, and...uh...uh...1 heard always about him, great admiration from Avraham. So\nthe...our...when I heard this stories from Avraham...Avraham told me, always he used to...to\nconfer with him to reach before in this...what is written because he wanted to know if it is\ncorrect about I things he wasn't present about...on things that Avraham wasn't present\nbecause he heard...Dr. Elkes spoke with the Germans so or so, so he...when he wrote the\ndiary he always brought it to him, read it before him, to know if it is everything correct. And\nso he used to tell me about these conferences and also about the Mrs. Elkes. She was also a\nwonderful woman, and this is what I know about him. It is...many, many of this is written in\nthe book and I read it too. (Laughing)",
        "Q: Alright, one more question and then we're going to stop. Can you tell us again, when you\nwere helping Avraham with the diary...uh...were there times when it was particularly\ndangerous?",
        "Q: Of course, it was dangerous. It 1s always dangerous. We were always afraid. Uh...Uh...for\ninstance, in the daytime so when a German used to come in the ghetto, Avraham used to\nsend me messenger to tell Germans in the ghetto. So I...1 knew I must be clean and\neverything must be... One day it was a very...it's a incident such that I was...he was...we\nwere sitting very late in the night. It was already 12 midnight, and he went out and all the\npapers were still on the table and didn't have time to take it to...take them, and I went out in\nthe ..in the second room, there was a kitchen, and there in this kitchen...it was a kitchen and a\nroom, our apartment. So it's like two rooms. So in the foreroom lived my cousin...my\ncousins. So I went out and I spoke to them. I didn't have the time to..to go in back in...so\nsuddenly I hear a knock on this door and Lipzer (ph?) came in. Lipzer was one we...the head\nof the Brigade we worked in the Gestapo, and he thought himself a very high man and a very\npowerful because he was...he was connected to them. They . ..uh . . they liked them. He\nworked for them...uh...and he...the Brigade was for workers, all kinds of workers like\ncleaners and __, and all kinds of things. And I was so much terrified, and he came up with a\nman, Shilette was his name, an engineer also. He lived downstairs. And he said, \"I saw light\nin your room, so I went up.\" And he made a move to go farther to my room. So I said, \"Mr.\nLipzer, I beg your pardon. My...my child is very sick and she fall asleep and I ask you not to\nwake Shulamit.\" So he said, \"Alright. Alright.\" And he said, \"Goodbye,\" and he backed out\nwith the other one. I was terrified to death you see because if he saw I...I don't know maybe\nhe'll give it to the Gestapo. It is the least we could after always keep Avraham in the hands to\ntell him I'm going to keep you out. (Laughing)",
        "Q: The diary you mean. Yes.",
        "A: Yeah. If he saw...1t would be very ___ to see what kind of papers are sitting in my room I am\nwriting in the night, so this 1s...I tell you I...a little incident...uh...what can happen in...those\nthings.",

He was stayed alive\nwho ran away who didn't..mothers...of the women and came back and he told me what was\ngoing on in this fort. And then...uh...I had to move to the ghetto. I must make it short.

And so I was beaten one after the other. I didn't...I\ndidn't believe that my husband was killed and my brother was killed. Somebody told me that\nit's not time to tell the particulars, but I still hoped that they are alive. But I had to move to\nthe ghetto. I was staying in the city a long time because I went to some\npeople...uh...uh...my... with my husband, my late husband was...had connections with the\nLithuanian because he build for the government, they build ...many buildings... .",
        "A: It was...it was terrible because I...they...everything was taken from me. They...my...my\napartment, my...my money, my jewelry, everything, and I...and I was staying too long in\ntown. Then I couldn't get a room in the ghetto because it was so few dwellings, and then it\nwas terrible. I 'til I by chance, it is a long story, but I shall tell it. I got a little tea room. It was\nhalf a room. It was about 8 meters and then I...1 went around with a...with all the belongings.\nI had to get a cart from the...the Lithuanians were not supposed to...to lend their carts for\nJews. By law, by the German law. But anyway when you paid money you...you got it...we\nhad to go 2 hours to the ghetto. It is...1t was a short, not so far away, but the long route\nthe...uh...the cart we went to the ghetto made it so slowly. And three times I went with the\nbelongings to the ghetto. I didn't have a place to put the things so I put it where\nacquaintances relatives were, so I put it on the...on the courtyard.

She is...to\nget some flour and some foods, but it was frightening. In a short time it was gone. And you\nhad...you couldn't have where to put...you didn't get other things. Till they organized and\nuntil they begin to give the food in the ghetto, it took some time, and then it was so ...so, uh,\nlittle. For instance, we got a 120 gram bread a day. And the...uh...there is...you...you couldn't\ndie and you couldn't live on it you see. It was a starvation. It was such starvation, and we had\nto...how to...to get food. So the meaning to get food it was to sell your things, to change it for\nfood. And the...there were brigades. We went out into the street...1nto the city to work. There\nwere little brigades where you could if connections with the Lithuanians, change with them\nyour...your...uh...belongings for food or for money and so you got some food. But you...you\nit was very hard work. You had to go...uh...by foot...about 10...I'm speaking kilometers, 10,\n15 kilometers and then after a day's work, walk back, and with the parcel your... on your\nback. But when I...I did it I was already lucky because I was...I had it already...I could breath\nin food in the ghetto. But it took...it passed a long time til I could go out.

There was bread and a little\npiece of butter and...uh... and salad or something, and he tells me that what told him that he\nwas several times here and sent parcels and she never got any news from me. So this was the\nfirst trme I knew him, I saw him again, but and he was very much pressed...or so pressed\nwhat he saw there, how I lived. It's already cool and it was...1t was already.

And then in the ghetto\neverybody honored him, and everybody admired him because he was above...above...above\nall you see, and...uh...uh...1 heard always about him, great admiration from Avraham. So\nthe...our...when I heard this stories from Avraham...Avraham told me, always he used to...to\nconfer with him to reach before in this...what is written because he wanted to know if it is\ncorrect about I things he wasn't present about...on things that Avraham wasn't present\nbecause he heard...Dr. Elkes spoke with the Germans so or so, so he...when he wrote the\ndiary he always brought it to him, read it before him, to know if it is everything correct.

My...my child is very sick and she fall asleep and I ask you not to\nwake Shulamit.\" So he said, \"Alright. Alright.\" And he said, \"Goodbye,\" and he backed out\nwith the other one. I was terrified to death you see because if he saw I...I don't know maybe\nhe'll give it to the Gestapo. It is the least we could after always keep Avraham in the hands to\ntell him I'm going to keep you out. (Laughing)",
