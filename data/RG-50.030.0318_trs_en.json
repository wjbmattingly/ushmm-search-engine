        "Q: I'd like you to start off by telling me your name, date of birth, place of birth.",
        "A: My name is Harold Zissman, although it is not my birth name. My birth name was\nZuckerman, same Harold. I was born in Poland in a city called Austrofmazotyetski (ph)\nand that was about a hundred kilometers east from Warsaw. My parents and grandparents\nand many generations before them were of the Hasidic belief. However, they were\ninvolved in business from crockery, porcelain, glassware, and they used to distribute it to\nthe stores in the vicinity and in further away places, maybe 200 kilometers to 300\nkilometers from base. It was a divided territory that they shared among the other and it\nwas their territory. They would supply to the stores. My father, like my uncle, like his\nson, all were part of the operation who used to, by horse and buggy, deliver goods to the\nvarious clients each week. And this was the means of making a living. It was three\ngenerations involved in it -- my grandfather, his children, which that means my father's\nbrothers and sister, my uncle which it was, again, part of the family. So, it was a family\nowned and operated, a closed corporation that all these families lived out of this business.",
        "Q: Just for the record, I don't think you told what your date of birth is.",
        "A: My date of birth is 19, ah, May 10, 1922.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war.",
        "A: Well, my personal life was brought up a real strict, devote Hasidic kind of way. Besides\nall of that, my father was a Corporal in the Polish Army, during World War II, and life\nwas strictly on a military basis, with the command, you had to do that, you were told to\ndo it. If you didn't do it, you had to report. So, it was really a strenuous life, that it was in\nthe house, especially for me since I was the oldest of four. I had two more brothers and a\nsister, who vanished in the Holocaust.",
        "Q: Did you, you went to a religious school?",
        "A: I graduated a tri-level school, which it was a private school, influenced by Zionist\norganization, Mesrah (ph), to which my father was a member and a member of the board\non top of it. Tri-level because it was Yiddish, Hebrew, and Polish; it was not just for\nlinguistic-sake, but in history and geography and literature and so on. And later on, I\ngraduated equal to a college, as we talk about the modern way; the name was\nDachkemone (ph).",
        "Q: Did you have contact with non-Jewish people as well? What was the, sort of the\npopulation of the town?",
        "A: When you talk about scholastically at the time, it was a sectarian school. It was strictly\nboys, without girls, and it was strictly influenced by religion, so it was a boys' religion\ntype of school; if you wish to call it parochial, would be in place. However, from the\noutside world, we were living on both sides for Gentiles. So to say that I associated with\nGentile boys, yes, I did, played maybe soccer with them, or just like neighbors sometimes\nget together.",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in those days?",
        "A: Oh, yes. As a kid going to school, it would have been sort of different as to bring it out in\ntoday's world, as we live in, in the 20th century. We used to, for instance, to give you an\nexample, going to school early in the morning, carry a lantern, for instance, to go. The\nboys of the neighbors at that particular time, maybe would walk their dogs or stuff like\nthat. And it was nothing odd to see this dog was sent against us. Although, we were going\nsometimes two, three kids together, neighbors; or maybe throwing, for the sake of play,\nthrowing a rock at us. I did not see friendliness in it. I sensed that because the words that\nwould follow it would be sometimes easily recognizable: \"dirty Jew.\" And the likes that\nkids were ready, even at that age, and I'm talking now by the age of seven, eight, nine\nyears of age. And you probably did not, I did not get the training of hatred, but I felt my\nneighbors kids do what they did to us was hatred.",
        "Q: How did you make sense of this?",
        "A: There was no sense. You do what you've got to do. At times, sometimes maybe you\nthrow a rock back. And that's when a fight would ensue and you'd come home and have\nto pay for it because the parents did not like for you to fight on the street. So, to resist\nwas bad; not to resist was also bad. So, it was a mix of no decision and no resolve.",
        "Q: Before 1939, what did you know about Hitler or Nazis where you lived?",
        "A: First of all, it was in our history books in 1933 when Hitler did come and became\nChancellor of Germany at that time. So we were aware historical from school. Second of\nall, come 1937 when Hitler drove all the Polish citizen Jews out of Germany where they\nhad to come back, although Poland didn't claim them, but they were Polish citizens. We\nwere exposed to them real early because our city was about 40 kilometers from Prussia;\nin other words, the location would be to go about 135 kilometers from Kinegsburg (ph)\nwhich was Prussia, and we were about 100 kilometers from Warsaw. So, for us to see\nscene at that particular time was a real scene to see. The people came to the city and they\nhad nothing with them; all they had with them was their belongings that was on them.\nAnd I remember we would learn as a child that kitchens were set up for those people so\nthey could come and have something to eat. And it was cramped quarters for the people\nthat somebody moved in with somebody else and so on. So the story in 1937 was not just\na story that one read in the paper or one heard on the radio if, occasionally you could,\nbecause not every home did have a radio, but you used to listen in sometimes outside\nnear the windows of the houses that did have a radio. And it looks like the people didn't\nmind; they were all aware of it. So it was no longer a story that was told, but it's a story\nthat was seen. It was real; the trap is there.",
        "Q: Do you remember your family talking about what was happening or whether there was\nanything for you to do, or whether it would come to your town, these kind of problems?",
        "A: Okay. It was, a few months later, I'm talking now '37, come '38, this scene became more\nvivid locally. We had the river Nalif (ph) going through our city. And it may sound a\nlittle funny that in 1914, during World War I, it was Germany that was occupying the\narea, not this type of German's that they build a bridge that was still considered new in\nour city, crossing that river. And at that particular time, the Polish Army started to start\nbuilding dams; in other words they wanted to flood the on-coming German Army. This is\nhow they thought yet in their minds, that it would be. So basically, being that you were a\nyoungster like I was at the time, that in the summertime going to the beach which we\nused to walk and share our fun there, areas near the beach became restricted because they\nwere building the dams. So one could not help but see a war, sort of this kind building\nup. We only did not know how long it would take. So, to answer, as I just stated, we did\nknow something tragic as war will come, but we did not know when.",
        "Q: Now, was there any talk of your family of trying to leave that area, or at this point?",
        "A: Yes, it was a personal tragedy at my house. I lost my mother at that time and tragedy was\nhome already. As a gesture, my mother's sister which still alive in here -- she's in a home\nnow -- and her brothers, which with they are no longer alive, tried to save me. Since she\nhad a letter in her possession, the last letter which I have, with my mother pleading for\nher to save me and bring me to America. They did send me the papers and as time that I\nwanted to leave, I didn't make it. Hitler beat me to it. By 1939 in September, I was\nsupposed to come for the visa, but September 1, the war broke out. So, yes, as I said, we\nfelt it and we knew it, the other tragedy. Personally at home, the size, the eminence of the\nother tragedy to follow, with Hitler.",
        "Q: Tell me of your memories of the war beginning, in your town?",
        "A: The preparation before the war, as I mentioned about the dam and the mobilization it\nstarted already, in early '39. And at that particular time became month by month, the\nnews became as an echo, closer to the cities, especially like ours. For instance, on market\ndays, before hostilities had started, we used to have an exchange of German people\ncoming in to purchase their eggs, buy their chickens and so on, because it was an open\nmarket and Poland was willing, we had an over abundance of food in Poland and they\nwere good customers so therefore, we saw all at once that not so many Germans coming\nto market days because Poland did not now want to sell it to them, so before making it a\ntotal restriction, there was limitations of how much they could take out, or how much\nthey could buy. So, one could sense a change and all of this here affected a little bit of the\neconomy because you were built up and ready. The other part, my father would come\nhome with stories telling of sometimes inticinating (sic), stone throwing, and so on. So,\non every occasion, being from school, being from for instance religious upbringing, as\nwe used to come. I was singing in a choir at that time with one of my friends who were\nthe cantor's children attending the same school as I did. Yavnev (ph) was the name of the\nschool, by the way for the record. And the tune of the high holiday 1938 was no longer\nthe same as it was in '37 or prior to that. It was sort of more solemnity. So in every way\nof life, from school to going to synagogue to going to the beaches, one could sense a\nchange all over. And you did not have to find out what; everyone was tuned to the news\nvery much and the newspapers. And, in our own family, we started to prepare ourselves\nand my parents and grandparents remembered that in World War I, our city of Stranlinka\n(ph), which I am speaking of, at the time that I was, we were living in Stranlinka.\nBecause prior to that, my family were in another city, the city of my birthplace,\nAstramocietska (ph) involved in the same business as I aforementioned, but they were\nforced, of their personal matters with one of the partner's bankruptcy, to move and they\nmoved to Stranlinka (ph) in 1929, re-starting again only a family operation, not like\nbefore when it was multi-families. And therefore they decided, since they were\nremembering that in World War I, Ostranlinka (ph), the city was totally burned down by\nLastrovmazofyetsky (ph) not having a river nearby, not having the main station railroads\nremain quiet, so they decided that probably the war would not reach in\nLastrovmazofyetsky (ph) but it will be only in Ostralinka (ph). And, as a means of\ndividing, so they also took are merchandise from our warehouse and try to put it in hiding\nin the other city, so in case it gets destroyed here, they'll have something to live on there\nand vice versa. So, yes; the family began to know before September | that world, not\nknowing to us that World War I was going to be named but that some war is going to\nbreak out any time, any moment. And that was what they decided to do, basically, 1s to\ndivide. And closer to the war, the family, all of us, were in that city of\nLastrovmazofyetsky (ph) and in Ostralinka they left the homes, the houses that we were\nliving in, as sort of to the outcome it will be.",
        "Q: So, you all moved back before the war. When you talked about going to school, which\ncity were you talking about?",
        "A: Ostralinka.",
        "Q: Ostralinka?",
        "A: While I went to school, see again, I started school, looks like my parents did not know\nwhat to do with me at home. So at three and a half years old I was sent to a private, to\nlike a malamet (ph) as we say in Hebrew, which it means a tutor translated into English.\nAnd it was private. That tutor had about ten, twelve kids and it still is, I'm of age now,\nbut it's still the picture of that one room and with all the songs surrounding it, you know,\nwith the story of a tutor still 1s very vivid to me to this day. So, three and a half years of\nage, I already was a student in school. However, it was again another story. When I\nreached the age of seven, school in Poland was compulsory. You had to start at 7 o'clock,\nat seven years old. So therefore, when I reached the age of seven, we were in a new city\nalready, moving into Ostralinka (ph). At that particular time I was very advanced in my\nYiddish and in my Hebrew teachings. However, Polish I could speak but I did not know\nenough to qualify to be in the first grade. And since it was a private school, so my father\nwould be involved paying extra money for three years for me to catch up because,\naccording to the exams, I would qualify to go into the third grade, but I did not, they\nwouldn't let me be in the third grade since I did not know, had enough education in\nPolish. So my father hired a tutor to tutor me at home in Polish only and with permission,\nand I was transferred into the second grade. However within the first year and the tutor, I\nwas able to go in immediately, not even finishing the year, to third grade. So, it was\nrough on me even then, already, you know, as it was the rest of my life.",
        "Q: What do you remember about the very beginning of war? Was your town occupied?",
        "A: Okay. At the year that I'm talking about, to make it vivid, it falls out before the high\nholidays, as we call our Rosh Hashanah, the way it would be. So the day before Rosh\nHashanah, while we were in Ostrovmazovetsky (ph), that's when the Germans entered the\ncity. That first hello from them that we had was the same very day, within hours, they\noccupied the city. They started to round up Jews, in other words, coming in with their\nguns drawn in their hands and you they rouse, \"Jew out\". And we were all gathered at the\nplace over there, where it was the high school, which had a big place, you know. But, I\nmean the place that was the playground that they had. And we were made to be seated,\nhands over our head and the war, I cannot exactly tell you the amount, but there were a\nfew thousand of us. On the balcony, we could see a machine gun, a big machine gun\ndrawn. We were surrounded in lines in between, with German soldiers, be they had\ncarbines, some of them had automatic weapons. And for what reason we were there,\nwhat, known knew. But we expected the worst in the position that we were. After an hour\nof sitting over there, and it's already curfew time near, all of a sudden, looks like it was a\ncommand and we were told to get up and round back. As we found it out, the next day\nlate, that Army was called to help some on the front line while they were going towards\nWarsaw at that time. In the days of the war, it was probably the fourth day of the war,\nand so take it, more or less, that it was September 4 at that particular time. And we were\ndriven, sort of to go back to our homes and shots were followed, a lot of them were killed\non the way. Like, this year, my father, and as we were split up because we were not\ntogether there, and my father was running in another direction and since he was a military\ntrained person, he knew how to go on his stomach and so on, to get out of the fire's way\nand he, when we came home, everybody was there but my father and we took it for\ngranted for that night that probably he was killed. However, in the morning, he made his\nway to meet us and it was a joyful thing that my father was not killed, and he told us that\nstory. So, yes. The first day of greeting, we found other casualties, the rabbi of the city\nand a lot of people from the, from one type of synagogue near the house, were driven\nwith their shawls, or , as we call it, to the area where we had a lake. We did not have a\nriver in Ostravmazofyetsky, but lake. At the lake there, there were lined up German cars,\nthat they were asked to wash them with their shawls and then afterwards they were asked\nto go through. They did not know how to swim, so some of them drowned, you know, we\nknew right there. And when they came out, they were beaten. So, there were begin some\ncasualties really known. We again found out that now, in order to, you cannot buy\nanything so there was lines lined up near the bakery in order to get bread. And soon\nenough, the police, the local police, which it was organized with arm bands. And the\nGermans started to pull the Jews out of the lines that the Jews cannot stay in line for\nbakery goods, to get. So, yes. We immediately knew the expectations to a wait; that it\nwill not get better but it will only bet worse. And it was a matter of when.",
        "Q: What happened next?",
        "A: The next thing that had happened, a local government came in there. By that particular\ntime, it was about a week later already into the war and the following the holidays it was\nalready , which as you know, it follows Rosh Hashana, Yom Kipper, and five days later,\nSucot (ph). And the family decided to go back. We went back part, my father, I, and a\nfew more. We were afraid to move, to touch the merchandise that was there because it\nwould have been confiscated. However before that happened, I must not forget to tell an\nincident that a rumor had it that leather, shoe leather was hidden someplace because the\nPoles used, at that time, cooperated very easily with the Germans and the German\ndemands were met. So if sometimes, they knew who the merchants were and who what,\nand they were aware that a lot of people were hiding their goods because they were afraid\nin case, so they couldn't find it and we, for what it's worth, that's my grandparents, both\nof them, my father and I were among the 10 or 12 hostages that were lined up again and\nthey said if somebody's not going to tell them about where the shoe leather 1s hidden, we\nwill be shot dead. So the first time in my life, I had the fear of being almost lined up\nagainst the wall. Luck was with us that the building next to us, the leather was discovered\nand we were let to go home. So, sort of to speak it, you were counting your blessings. So\nthe second time that ever it happened that we were lined up, that we came out whole as\nfar as the family, no casualties. But there were casualties already there. The chores\nimmediately had started. The Jews had to line up on the outside in a given place and from\nthere cleaning the streets and so on was the kind of work that we were ordered to do.\nAnd, of course, let me not forget to say it was without pay, for pay the billing was in\norder. And we decided at that particular time we had to have a paper that allowing us\nbecause without a paper who knows who could happen on the way? So we managed to\nget a paper, as refugees, that we were running, during the war to return back to our place.\nAnd, the Germans gave, not the Germans but the local, from the local area we got there.\nAnd we were on our way back. And on the way back, every time we were traveling, we\nwere stopped by the Germans and they made us get off from the wagon and start to look\nbut we did not, we did not yet had anything to be heard, until we neared one place, a\nvillage, I think it was, maybe, I would say maybe 20 kilometers from our city. In that\nvillage lived one of our relatives and he had a store, a general type store and we found\nout, because we stopped to find out what to do, we found out that they already had a\nsmall massacre of the Jews and his family was among them and the store was no longer\nin his hands because it was confiscated. So we found out a little bit of mishap on the\nfamily right on the way there. No sooner had we got to Ostralinka, back to our home, our\nhome was not robbed or anything like that; it was still there because the rest of the people\nin the building were there, so it was sort of like was somebody to watch it. So once we\nwere there, again the chores started, the same as over there. My father was ordered and\nthey put him into jail for a day because he was cleaning. That was the main chores that\nJews were given to do, street cleaning or any of the office buildings and so on. And we\nnoticed at that particular time in Ostralinka that it was less of an uprise, less going on\nthan in Lostravmozavensky, which we found out later the reason. The Soviets were only\nat that particular time sharing the city, so one part of the city at the other end, one day the\nSoviets would come in, the other day the Germans. So we took it as an interpretation that\nsince the Soviets were part over there, the Germans did not try to act out in the same way\nas they did for instance in Lostravmozavensky. That was never supposed to be belonging\nto the Soviets so they had a more free hand. That went on for another few days while we\nwere in town until one day, it was still the Jewish holidays of Soco (ph), the second days,\nso the, it was placed notices all over town that within ten hours, the Jews are to leave.\nOfficially it said you could take all the belongings that you want. In our case, since we\nhad a horse and wagon, so there were three of them so we shared it among the family and\nbesides the furniture, we tried to manage to take some of our clothing and so on and to\nleave with that. Immediately, the same day, the Poles from farming and the other places\ncame into the houses and they were not asking, \"Do you sell it?\" or anything, but they\ntook the furniture out of the house. So our house was emptied out of furniture within a\nfew hours. And there was known to stop them. We tried to open up the store and maybe\nmuster to get a few, some money out of it, of whatever it is, and no sooner we opened up\nthe door to our store, a Polish person brought the Germans here. The Germans start to ask\nwho the owners is, I was there with my uncle. As soon as we realized the questions, we\ntook the first chance and run away from there, back home, and that was the end. So in\nother words, that was confiscated. So however, the other part in hiding was, still in\nLostravmozavetsky, where I and a cousin of mine, in a few months, almost two months\nlater, make a chance and cross the border with the horse and wagon, dressed as farmers\nand we make an attempt, the Germans almost caught up with us and we salvaged some\nmerchandise from there, from the hiding place, which it gave us an ability with, money-\nwise, to have for the first winter that we were over there. And it's a long story to tell until\nwe get there.",
        "Q: I have one question. I'm a little confused. These two towns, were they close to each other,\nbecause you seem to go back and forth a bit?",
        "A: 40 kilometers, which, 1n our miles-way, we were talking about 20 miles. So you must\nunderstand, 20 miles driving with a car is nothing, but with a horse and buggy, it would\ntake, with the horse and buggy, you know, it would take a few hours which you would be\nthere.",
        "Q: But, you seem to have the freedom to choose between these two places to go back and\nforth?",
        "A: When do you talk about, in the first days of the war? Yes. Until we were sent out from\nour city, you needed to have a piece of paper, that in other words, you were permitted. So\nonce you had a permit, you were stopped. They checked the permits but you could move\nabout.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: How long did it take before certain decrees or rules were implemented by the Germans\nand Poles?",
        "A: Okay. All the German forerunners were on motorcycles. That's how they were, that was\ntheir infantry, starting with motorcycles and then trucks and so on and armor would\nfollow them. Immediately, their crews would post posters on lighting poles or\nwhatsoever, wherever posters could be posted, telling the new ordinance, what it is: A.\nThat it was curfew hours. B. That the Jews must be identified and must carry\nidentification and in the early part, at least in our city, we were supposed to wear a band\nwith the Mark of David, with the Star of David on it. And it was told immediately if one\nis caught, they will be shot. That was for anything that one violates, violating the curfew\nwas shot. It was immediately declared that Jews cannot walk on sidewalks. So, the\nidentity was the arm band and you must not walk on the sidewalk; you must walk just on\nthe streets. And the same story was, in reading on further, one would know that Jews no\nlonger can attend any schools, Jews can no longer own any businesses, Jews no longer\nhave rights and that was stating according to the rules of Nuremborg. Therefore, for the\ntime being, the ghetto was not erected as yet, that was not talked about as yet, but they\nalways must report every morning to their assigned places for the assigned work there.\nSo in the first days of entry, when everyone got out of their hiding places, running away\nfrom the bombings, they were faced immediately with the rules and arm bands affixing\nand so on.",
        "Q: Did you always follow those rules?",
        "A: Oh, yes. One did not try to there because we saw the consequences how easily it was for\na German to draw his pistol and even without anything, can be just target practice and\nthere wasn't a day or anyplace, as soon as they came in, that killings were not going on.\nAnd they were not re meditated; they just a lot of times were out of laughter. And I've\nseen with my own eyes where a mother and her child were target practice, to shoot, to see\nthat one bullet should kill both of them at one time. And it was not to save a bullet, but it\nwas just that the rest of the Germans would laugh, you know what I mean, you would see\na scene much rather than a murder being committed.",
        "Q: What were the Poles doing?",
        "A: Well, the Poles at that particular time, please understand, immediately remained as, those\nwho worked in offices were left working in offices. Those who were formerly in the\npolice, a lot of them escaped for fear and a lot of them were drafted to the services, so a\nnew police force was being organized. Also they were carrying bands to identify the\npolice. So the Poles were pretty much back to their normal lives, whatever they had to\ndo, you know toying around with a new regime, you know. But the important thing was,\nas a Jew, immediately your businesses were confiscated, you know, and if you had lived\nsomeplace in a nice area, it was nothing to hear new that you were pushed out. But, as I\nsaid, that was in Lostrovmozavetsky, in the first few days; but we came to Ostravlinka as\nI for mentioned before, things were a little bit different and not so rapidly, due to the fact\nthat we were sharing the Soviets on the other side and the town and one did not know that\nthey may not occupy the whole town. So, therefore it was a little bit easier. So when it\nhappened, it happened to us rapidly; ten hours and the Jews must leave the town. When\nwe came to the borderline with bayonets they went through our belongings and if like\npillows, you saw feathers fly everywhere, so in other words, and if it's anything valuable,\nthey tried, nobody dared to carry open gold or rings or anything like that, because that\nwas confiscated on you there. So then, you would still get a few biddings and go to the\nborderline. And there was a no-man's land shortly in that part than over on the other side.\nIn our group, the family, my grandmother, my mother's father, he spoke Russian yet\nbecause he knew to write and to read Russian. So he served at that particular time for us\nas the interpreter and we crossed over on the Russian side.",
        "Q: Now, at what point did you decide to go over on the Russian side?",
        "A: It was not a decision at what point. As I said, when the posters were posted that this is\ndeclared to be a city of the Third Reich, according to the Nuremburg laws, a Jew was not\npermitted to dwell in the Third Reich. So we were given ten hours, as I said, to move out.\nSo, as I said, we had ten hours to leave and we had two choices to make: either to go, as\nwe called it at that time, Congress Poland, which it means out of our city to any other\nplace, or we could cross the border to the Soviets. The Soviet border was remained open\nfor all who wants to cross and to come there. That was the part that it helped a lot of\npeople be saved or rather, that 1t saved their lives crossing like my family did. And that\nwe went on the other side.",
        "Q: Okay. Continue on. Where did you go?",
        "A: Okay. We went to a city 36 kilometers from our city called Lunja (ph). And from there,\nabout another 15 kilometers or so was a city called Yedvobno (ph). Yedvobno translated\nfrom Polish to English would be silt; the silt city, Yedvobno. In that little town, our\nfamily probably from the shakot (ph) to the rabbi to anybody else was somehow related,\nyou know; second cousin, third cousin. And the family sort of found ways to get situated\namong all that family. So even if it was only one room that it was given to go in there.\nAnd immediately, we had to register with the police ask so on and so forth. And\nyoungsters were asked to go back to school because it was September, and the school\nyear was disrupted for a little while. School had started. I enlisted 1n school at that\nparticular time, again. Since Russian was not my language, but I had to study so instead\nof coming in according to my education, I should have at least come into the tenth class\nbecause the Russian had a ten-year school. I came in at the ninth with an examination\nbecause on everything I tested but Russian and I was back into school and it started a\nnew life, sort of, in a way feeling of joy, even though everything was left behind and all\nof a sudden we were supposed to be the proletariat. And of course, the identity that my\nfather was a businessman was a shameful thing to say, shameful enough that you could\nhave been arrested and sent to Siberia which the bad thing for one, which like it\nhappened to some of the family, turned out to be good wishes for later, because it since\nthey were sent to Siberia, they survived the war without a lot of these problems that the\nrest of us had to go through, those who survived. So, at that particular time, started a new\nlife. I, as a young person, was starting again like all young people used to get together\nafter school in the evening and it was the Russian system, which they called\n\"Dacadumcrasne ami\" (ph), which it means the house of the Red Army. And the Red\nArmy used to supply dances, sort of in playing, and it was, you know, that was part of\ntheir propaganda, how Stalin cares for the youth and Stalin loves us. And all of a sudden,\na new life had started, to listen to politicians talking and voicing opinions that we should\nlearn the constitution of the Soviet Union and that they came to liberate us and so on. It\nwas a new lexicon for me and many of us to indulge and I remember it was influenced on\nme as a young person; after all, I was only 17, going into my 18th year of life and\neverything coming on so fast. So, I remember when I used to come home, starting to talk\npolitics with my father and tell him the wrongs, the way he was doing before, without\nrealizing, and my father told me, \"Wait, son. While you're in school and you come home,\nyou have a clean bed and you have food to eat. It's very nice for you to talk of it. But,\nwhen the day will come that you will have to earn your living, you will see who is\nwrong.\" Because my father, and the rest of the family, first being religious, second they\nwere against communism or socialism to begin with and it was sort of life at a time rolled\nback to working with them, being school influenced on one side, and being influenced on\nthe other side. For me, I felt good, that no longer I have to go and go attending religious\nupbringing and so on. So as I lot of youngsters, you choose what it's easier and better.\nAnd especially, you come at night, and you go out with all the boys and girls and it's\ndancing, it was sort of a different life without knowing. And you know, that was, that's\nblind thing that it was put up. Before long I joined even an organization called Soviehem\n(ph); it was a sports organization so you get involved in sports and it didn't take long,\nwhen we were asked to take our passports and after then we took out the passports, things\nbecame a little bit more strict. We were restricted as we cannot live 100 kilometers from\nthe border which that city of Vadlov (ph) was less than a hundred kilometers, you know,\nto the border, so therefore as refugees, we had to start moving. So the first time winter we\nthrough there, come spring, new problems had started even on the Soviet side. Now we\nhad to leave all this family, leave all the people that you knew and move to at least a\nhundred kilometers away. We choose, Galestov (ph), for instance, was the big center. Big\ncenters were forbidden for these displaced persons to live in there and we had to . That's\nhow it happened that we came to the Ratchen (ph). The Ratchen was a city that it was far\nenough from the borderline and we were permitted. However to get housing, was again\nanother problem over there. They were not prepared to take in this many refugees.",
        "Q: One question before you tell me more about the . Were you able to continue practicing\nyour religion? Were you able to be a Jew under Soviet occupation?",
        "A: I would say that even at the time, if it was not officially restricted at first, and we are\ntalking about not even a year there, but people were understanding of the circumstances\nso they did, after escaping the Germans, everything that the Soviets had to offer was\ngood. So, therefore, instead of violating the rules so people, yes, did practice in hiding. It\nwas another way like we were for instance, which I didn't tell at the beginning, on the\nfirst day of Rosh Hashana, that we descended in a cellar at that time, and my grandfather\nat that time, and on the top, going down to the cellar on the top we put on a piece of the\nfurniture so it should not be visible in the event the Germans come in to see. And I spoke\nto my grandfather at that time and I say, \"Now I understand what they went through in\nSpain, in the year the Jews were practicing.\" And he says, \"Be quiet my son. Don't talk\nnow. Pray to God maybe we'll survive.\" So, that's how deep the religion was in these\npeople. They saw only one way out of it was through religion. So, now when we're on the\nSoviet side, they did practice religion but no longer did I have the discipline that my\nfather would ask me, \"Did you pray this morning?\" Because I went to school again and\nhe realized that I'm becoming brain washed with something different so it was sort of a\n\"Don't talk. Don't tell. Don't ask,\" situation that I was brought into to live in the new life.\nAnd, as I started to say at the outset, getting situated in the regimen was not an easy task.\nFor instance, a whole family moved into one single room next door to a guy who is\nmaking harnesses for horses and so on. And that room used to be his workman place. But\nit looks like all the bitterness became sweet and everything was well. After all, as I said,\nfor the first winter, the merchandise that I and my cousin being risked our lives and\nbrought it in, lasted for that time. But all of a sudden, everybody had to get work. My\nfather, since he still had the horse and wagon and that gave him a good way hiding than\nhe was not a businessman but he was a working man, earning a living through that. So\nnow, he used to do with his horse and wagon taking some merchandise from, which they\nused to call it Soluzatil (ph) which it was scrap metal and so on, and he would have to\ntake it to another city to bring it in to the big warehouse. So he had a job for this year and\nthat helped him to do black marketeering while under the cover of this merchandise that\nhe had. He would go ahead and smuggle like saccharin maybe, and other things like that.\nSo, when you were going to Sloyen (ph), you would take along some eggs, butter,\nwhatever it is to trade. There was no money. Trading was the important thing, and come\nover there, buy flints for instance, for lighters. That was a big thing because matches\nwere in a scarce place; getting sole, which it was a very scarcity item or sugar. So, it was\na matter of black marketing. It was against the law. If you were caught with it, five year\njail was the term. But need and the necessity to go on does not get scared by five years\nimprisonment, you know. And we went on and at times, at first I still was in school,\ndidn't get involved. So I tried to go ahead and listen to what they told me in school and I\ninvolved myself to become a working man. And school at that particular time taught you\nand they kept saying that no matter what we do, we must go ahead to do work. And I\nregistered to go to Galistog (ph) to a place and I wind up in a place were they were\nbuilding actually housing for the soldiers. And as a youngster I never did this kind of\nwork before and there I have to take the wood barrels and fill them. After a couple of\nweeks of work, I thought I'm going to collapse and I returned back home. I got a permit\nand I returned back home and I had to find another job. My father at that particular time\nwas afraid continuing with the work that he was doing over there, so we decided we are\ngoing to go to the forest; which, this going to the forest would build up the future later,\nserving as a base, that I knew the roots of how to escape from the ghetto, although we\ndidn't do it with that in mind, but it turned out to be, yesterday's bad things turned out\ntomorrow's safety and so on. So we came there, over there with a horse and wagon. We\nwere loading trees that were cut down and taking them from one place to the other. The\nother part behind it was that we worked close to the farmers so we could deal with the\nfarmers and that black marketeering was still a part and before long, my father's influence\nworked on me that I got involved doing the black marketeering in the same way\nalongside of him. And for a while, we thought that it couldn't be any better because the\nshortage of food was no shortage to us. We always had enough food to bring home; not\nluxury food, you know, good food that we wanted, but food was around the table, you\nknow. So you had bread, you had butter, you had cheese. You were able to get a chicken\neven though you couldn't get your steaks and so on, but you could have a chicken and so\non. And was the other problem was at that time with kosher slaughter. Kosher slaughter\nbecame a problem. I did not go into the political part of it, to tell you of Poland before the\nwar. I don't know how much to tell or how much you can give me the time to tell, but\ntalking about kosher slaughter, even through 1937, through a woman by the name of\nPristo, Madam Pristo, and she served in Polish Congress. And she was a humanist. She\nsaid that killing an animal, as the kosher slaughter was, takes too much time for the\nanimal to be dead; therefore, we were doing an inhumane thing to the animal. So\ntherefore, kosher slaughter should be forbidden. It stirred up a tremendous out pour\nthroughout Poland because the Polish constitution of 1918, when they gained\nindependence, and Pilsutsky (ph) at that time being the head, and since the Jews saved\nhis life, he owed a debt to the Jews and he kept all these anti-Semites (ph) in place. He\ncouldn't stop them altogether, but he, like a dictator, kept it undercover and control. The\nJews had elective officials, even to the same as they were called the same, Senate, house\nof Congress, as you would call it, you know, and the Senate. And the law, and it posed\ntremendous protest. But I blame the Jewish leadership for not coming up at that time\nimmediately to squelch all of this here that in turn led to the officials handling black\ncandles and they called a fast that we have to fast and punish ourselves so that God will\nhelp us, that this bad law will be change. Well, we know the outcome, that it didn't. And\nthe hypocrisy worked on me even as a youngster. Because why? Instead of forbidding the\nkosher slaughter, we were given a contingency; in other words, you can kill so many so\nthat, in its, tells the wrongs. If it is right to kill 100 pieces of cattle, why is it wrong to kill\n150 or 200. So in it, one so blatantly, that anti-Semitic out burst against the Jews, even\nthough they were constitutionally protected, that it's a part of religious ritual to do. So\nknow, on the Soviet side, all people who are before, remembered this here case and no\none sort of dared to make an issue of it. However, kosher slaughter still went on in\nhiding, as sort of to speak that if you want a chicken to be slaughtered properly kosher,\nyou could, there was somebody who would do it for you. But, it sort of, since the towns\nwere small and the NK VD as we called it at that time, or KGB did not penetrate so much\nand the local people were working in the government so some how rather, it was \"Hey, I\ndon't see it.\" And, of course, in many instances, you paid off for all of these goodies\ndoing it in the say way. So, religiously, again, which it was a big upheaval for people like\nin my family at that particular time. And I as a youngster, did not feel the hurt so much\nbecause I was young and foolish as the saying would be, not understanding tomorrow,\nyou know, what it is going to bring on us later. So, as I said, I already got the taste of the\ncoming Soviet working and being privileged to find out at that particular time, that in the\nSoviet Union, workmanship was by right; in other words, the bricklayer did not earn as\nmuch money, or maybe more money as the guy who was mixing the cement. So, it was\nnot the Soviet system of socialism but it was again, capitalism. In the capitalistic system,\nwe know there are different rates of pay, even for the same work. So, I began do get a\nlittle doubt in the system to what is going on. And that was own a year and a half on this\nsort of living conditions. I still was in school and I came back from Devon (ph) back into\nschool and all of this kind of life lasted, as I said; with working in the forest and doing all\nthe means. And at that particular time, I used to talk to my family, why don't they try to\ngo ahead, go move further east, but their mind was that the work cannot be a lasting one,\nthat the war should be over and we'll be able to return back to the area that we had to run\naway from. However, the 22nd of June, all of the dreams of yesteryears became too evil\nfor that same day.",
        "Q: 1941?",
        "A: 1941, the 22nd of June, Hitler attacked. I don't want to have to put it in, but maybe we\nhave to. If anyone's seen on television not so long ago, it was brought the story back to\nlife, the way Stalin was forewarned about all the things that Hitler was going to attack but\nit did not want to listen to and he even went away and executed some guys, calling them\npropagandists and until the war broke out, he didn't want to believe that that would be the\ncase. That's a point I want inserted because it's a true fact, the way it was. He began to\nsee it immediately. The local population then, in that city, Rachen (ph), that I was, we\nwere hiding from the bombings, when the Germans attacked and they kept saying they\nwished the Germans would come in already. And after us telling them we already\nexperienced the Germans, I hope that the Russians shouldn't lose and be able, because at\nthat particular time it was a few days the Soviets, a few days the Germans, until it was\nsettled. Because within ten days at that particular time, it had reached almost near to be\nthe Mensk (ph), you know, and Hitler at that particular time was the blitz , it was named,\nthat he'll be in Moscow within ten days. And he almost succeeded, you know, to be there.\nSo things began to turn real fast in a different way. Again, at this time, in '41, like it\nhappened in '39, the first thing when the Germans sent it in the Rachen, the Jews were\ncalled to meet on the place in the center. The center of the city of small towns, like in\nmost cases in the United States also, have also, you know, they call it the plaza over\nthere, what we call the marketplace or whatever. So that was usually the center for the\nJews to be gathered. And they drove us out over there and, again, if you want to call it a\nmiracle be it; to me it is a miracle but it happened. While a man, a German uniform went\nout and spoke to us in perfect Russian and he was a, I believe a captain, if higher, spoke\nto us in perfect Russian and started to tell us about the new law and all of us were\nsearched and if anybody has jewelry or anything like that. So, we had a taste right away\nearly to put it up and all of a sudden while we were there, looks like, you know, a piece\nof artillery that it was the wrong way, hit the corner part of the church and when that hit\nand another one followed, the Germans started it and they were being attacked now, so\nwe were dismissed. But the machine guns were surrounding us at the time. We were not\nthere to listen to speeches. We were there to follow through. They started to segregate all\ndoctors needs to go to one side; you know, the right and left, if you ever heard about it,\nthat's what, we were a part of it. To the right, to the left; no one knew whether the right\nline is the right line or it is the wrong line, you know, to go. And you had no choice about\nit. They would go ahead and look, right, left, and every time they was said, was always\nwith a and that saved us, that explosion from this here artillery piece and all of a sudden\nthe Germans were starting to run around like mice and we were returned back to our\nhouses. Until a couple of days later, the front line started to come for fuller, the Soviets,\nwhatever was left, retreated and that was when life under the occupation with the Nazis\nbegan. A Univad (ph) was formed in the city. A Univad means actually a government --\nit was not appointment. It wasn't even elected but then, we would line up. He would point\nthe finger to one, he would go out to the right or to the other one and they would appoint\nabout maybe ten people. Then they told them, \"You are the Univad,\" and they said, \"You\nare going to be the president and this is where we'll begin to have a government,\" and a\nghetto was formed. So, for the first time, a new life starts again, ghetto; which it meant\nthey mapped out a few blocks of the city which could house only probably a tenth or\nmaybe less than a tenth of the population, and it was with barbed wire surrounded all the\nway around, with doors and we had the police, the local police which they assigned to; it\nused to be on the outside. The Germans could always go inside to the police, but the\nrestriction was for farmers or Gentiles to go inside the ghetto. We could only go out with\na \"shine\" as they used to say in German; in other words, a paper which was a permit and\ngroups used to be started in the morning. We would line up near the Univad; these ones\nare going, those are the carpenters. They're going to do carpentry work. Those are the\nelectricians, going for electrical work. The other ones we'll send to cleaning the various\ntypes of offices or the streets or whatever ensued later, like 1t was winter for instance, to\ngo to clean the snow.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3\nA.... arithmetic of the case, since Jews were only 10 percent of the population, how come so\nmuch anti-Semitism could reach. (Another speaker, unintelligible.) Amoshik (ph). So it\ncould not be right. (Another speaker; \"They wouldn't have to kill anybody.\") It means the\nthree half million people, all turned onto families. The families, let's say make it 3 or 4\nper family, so it would be a fourth of that would have been. So they should have been. . .",
        "Q: I think you were talking about (unintelligible)?",
        "A: Life in the Rachen (ph) on the occupation and with the ghetto and Univad (ph) in full\nswing, brought new problems and killings day by day. They were not killings because\nthey were called for, but it was the criteria I have aforementioned. If a policeman wanted\nto have fun, he killed a Jew. Or, when he was working something and if he did not work\nas fast as the policeman told him to do, that was a good way to basically not shoot him,\nbut beat him to death. So everyday used to go on in the same. I had in the ghetto with me\na brother to my father who he was, in part, responsible for helping me with my religious\neducation and he was a graduated rabbi. We still used to, by his demands, when I would\ncome from work and we used to sort of talk about the Torrah, a little bit here and then the\nother. All of that was very distasteful at the time to me, but I loved him enough to listen\nto him. He's the man at that particular time came to me since maybe I didn't mention, and\nI use that word, \"ota defid\" (ph), you know what I'm referring to? That's a French saying\nfor \"burning\" and that was sort of burning on display. All religious scripture, be the\nTorrah, be books and everything, were ordered by the Germans to be making in a bonfire\nwhich they had burned it. They were so scared for knowledge that people could be aware\nthat this was, again, a part of showing to the Jew which it belonged to a part of the de-\nhumanization program. Because, you must remember that we went through certain\nstages. As I have aforementioned before, the laws of Nuremburg were the first laws to\ngive them the guide. And in these laws, a Jew was not a human. A Jew loss all his rights\nand therefore he was a person without rights. So, the same as I have aforementioned\nbefore, when the ghetto started, it was the same thing. Inside the ghetto, a Jew could walk\nevery place. But even by marching to work or doing your chores that you were ordered to\ndo, the sidewalk was forbidden for a Jew to walk on. So,....",
        "Q: You mean outside? ?",
        "A: Outside of the ghetto. Even while you were doing your duty. The only time he could\nwalk out was when he had a broom in his hand and sweeping the sidewalk so therefore.\nBut otherwise, this was forbidden for Jews to walk on those sidewalks. Every time you\nsaw a German, a Jew was asked that he must salute him and say \"Good morning\" and so\non. If you didn't, that was good enough cause for the Germans to beat you, kill you, or\nwhatever it is because we had no rights, so he did not have to bring in front of the court\nor anything like that. You were executed on the spot. Quite often when the killings went\non, I would come home and talk to my uncle and say, \"Look, I'm very despondent today.\nI've seen a child being molested and killed.\" Or, \"I've seen another instance where that\nhappened.\" And basically, that was, then the dig. They started to do a dig at that\nparticular time in the out skirts of the town. A pit big enough for a truck, mind you, to go\naround and turn. And that ultimately was supposed to be the burial places that was\nintended for the ghetto, but it did not happen that way because of the Protestants in the\narea, which I'm going to get to it a little bit later, when we get to talk about the\nProtestants. But, right now, I'm only trying to touch base with life and what went on, the\nkind. Let's say when the winter came, a lot of Jews were killed and lost by sending them\nto go ahead to clean the snow. And they did not have the proper equipment. The Germans\ndidn't provide shovels, it was our job that we, the Univad (ph) of the Jews had to have\nshovels. And to get tools at that time, 1t wasn't like you go into a store and buy it. You\npaid dearly through the local population to get it for you because Jews could not travel\naround and go to purchase things. So, in order to purchase things, that's what you had to\ndo, the outside connection. Another thing which I do not want to leave out: the creation\nof the Univad, a new thing and a new word began to make its place. The word was called\n\"contribution\" . Now, in the normal language when we use a contribution in the United\nNations United States, we talk about a donation. You contribute something to a welfare,\nto a cause. That word \"contribution\" was done exactly opposite; that was a punishment.\nIn other words, it means the Univad could be called and was beat up to the office of the\nGestapo and they were given an order that within, for instance, ten hours for so, this\ncommunity, this ghetto is to write one kilogram of gold. They did not care whether you\nhad the gold, but if you didn't have the gold, they wanted a kilogram of gold. Maybe they\nwere successful to bring 14 ounces; they accepted the 14 ounces, and but on another\ncontribution, which in other words. So, little by little, all the laws began to be of that\nnature. Jews cannot wear leather shoes. Jews cannot wear any leather clothing. So, in\nother words, all of this type; if you had boots or you had shoes with leather, you had to\nturn that in. So all of this here was the part of the dehumanization program and the part of\nbreaking us morally and shy away how to resist the enemy, you know. So you haven't got\nthis and you haven't got that and you can't get the others and before long, and we used to\nhave to come every morning and stay in line to receive the amount of ounces of bread\nprescribed. In other words, it wasn't a matter that you go out to buy, but it was a bakery\nand the Jews used to be delivered bread and the bread was not made of flour. If you heard\nstories that were, you know, putting in sanding from the wood, you know, things like\nthis. It was true. It was like that. And that the Jews had to pay for it. Labor, you didn't get\npaid. So you used to go through all of this here, stay in line to get the ration for the day of\nbread. So food became a problem, and talking about smuggling was again an issue. Since\nmy brother used to know the farmers, that he used to speculate before with the Russians,\nnow he used to, as a child it was easier; he was four years younger than I was, so we split\nup at that particular time. I was with the family of my father's and my brother, my two\nbrothers and my sister went to live together with my grandfather. My grandfather on the\nfather's side was dead; he died already. But my grandfather from my mother's side was\nstill alive and he was there. So he was together with his son and his wife already was\ndead, left a child behind and then he had the three children, his grandchildren. So my\nbrother used to be the one who would steal his way out and if my uncle would find\nsomething that he should give him to trade for food, he would go. And as a kid, but he\nwas very well equipped to be able to do it because necessity at a time mother of invention\nand since we had to make the life of black marketeering, you know, that's what it was. I\ndid not tell you this point, that at this time in my life my father was no longer alive here.\nAs I aforementioned before, that my father used to go ahead and carry on the sayuzatil\n(ph) which is I said metal scraping, to he used to have to go to Slonum (ph) with it, a big\ncity from the Rachen (ph), and in the meanwhile he used to be able to take passengers\nalong who would pay him money and they were also black marketeers. So it happened in\nthat winter of 1942. Now, I got to be careful; not the winter of '42. It was the winter\nbefore the Germans; it was the winter of 1940. So while he was traveling to Slonum, at\nthat time was a big snow, we had maybe 10 to 12 inches of snow. And halfway, the horse\ncouldn't pull the sled anymore because he was sinking, like there was no route yet made,\nso he decided to come back. A friend of his who 1s still alive in Israel today, who was the\nfirsthand story to tell me how it happened, so he decided to come back. And he came\nback; I jumped up from my bed listening. It was something terrible to hear, you know,\nthat he came back. I was wondering what it is. And he told me that it is impassable, the\nroad, and he decided to come back. He was a hauset (ph), like I say, in a lot of Hasidic\nway, prejudiced about some of these here things. For instance, you don't go back the\nsame way; if you forgot something in the house and you came out to get it, they wouldn't\ngo back the same way. They got to go back the other way. So why do I say that? Because\ntwo of the passengers kept insinuating (sic), \"Why don't we go back?\" Instead of being\nthe wall behind the sled, and if the horse stops, you help him. And some how or other,\nmy father listened to their pleas and he decided to go back. So afterwards it happened\nwhen the horse got stuck, it did not have a whip on it or anything like that. He went over\nto the first tree, broke off a branch and came over and the horse wouldn't pull and he hit\nhim, the horse, and the horse pulled up his left foot and hit him right in this part (point to\nhis head) which actually, the way the doctor told me later, he busted an inside artery, you\nknow, and he was bleeding internally. When he came back for the second time from the\nturn and he was already laying, crying, I immediately took him to the hospital with\ncalling the doctor. And the doctor told me that it would be the best cure for him if we\ncould get him to Slonum (ph) to a hospital because he'll need surgery; he's bleeding\ninternally. He was a strong man, my father, that he could hold pain. And no matter how\nmuch effort by morning I tried, that the Red Army should take him with the ambulance to\nthe other city. No matter how much influence I tried to use, and I did not have the\ninfluence to take him and within 24 hours, he was dead. So I had the second personal\ntragedy awaiting me after all this year that now my father remarried after my mother's.\nHe remarried in 1938 and here we're talking about three years later, that we thought that\nit was a good thing it happened to us because the stepmother, she was very good to my\nyounger brother and the others, and my sister, and the house began again to be in order.\nSO we were very appreciative to it. And as I aforementioned, I, at the time, thought that\nI'm going to leave for the United States, and I couldn't. So know it looks like trouble\nfollowed trouble, one after the other. So this time, while we are there and we're doing all\nthis here black marketing, my father is dead now. But the family's got to go on. His father\nwas still alive and he was so proud of me that I can go and keep the family together. It\nlooks like he couldn't die until I would be back. On his dying bed, he kept on talking,\n\"Where's Harold?\" And, it's when I came back, I used to travel by night and came that\nmorning. My stepmother said to me, \"You better hurry to see grandpa; he's in bad shape\nand he keeps asking.\" I came to his bed and he was hardly breathing but he recognized\nme, hugged me and within a few minutes, he was dead. We had a clinic across the street\nwhere my grandpa was living at that time, the Soviets, and I called the doctor. He was in\nright away and it was all over. So both of my grandparents were fond of me in many\nways. Now, this grandfather from my mother's side had his love for me in another way.\nAnd with him, he was behaving well until one day, he wanted to go commit suicide. And\nsuicide, by Jews, religious Jews, is a no-no. He couldn't take all that was going on. He\ncouldn't take his life, his religion. So somebody stopped and they saw what he was doing,\nthat he was trying to cut his arm and they started yelling and then my uncle got him back\nhome and we started to calm him down. But, the man lost his and he couldn't go out. All\nof that took place until I was taken to concentration camp. The story starts like that.",
        "Q: I just wanted to get a sense of time for clarification. This is, was, all of these episodes\nyou're talking about prior to the ghetto being formed?",
        "A: What I said about my grandfather was prior to the ghetto being formed. My father's\nfather, when he said he couldn't die until I was to his bed, now I'm talking about my other\ngrandfather who also was fond of me and he, looks like, wanted to commit suicide by not\nbeing able to see life what had been ensuing in the ghetto. You follow me now? Because,\nin the ghetto, as I told you, my brother would risk his life and go out to get a little food to\nkeep for them going. I had to go working and a few times then round ups were, by that\ntime I already built a hide out in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a few questions about the ghetto. How did your brother get back and\nforth?",
        "A: As I say, he would steal his way out, as a kid, and you know, he was four years older than\nme and even the other kids. And if he would go sometimes with a line up of the people\nwho were marched out to go to work, he would crawl in to there. And who these days, on\nthe Jewish side, from the Univad (ph) cared that they saw another guy. They were not\naccountable that much, so he would go with us on that line and in the meanwhile, he\nwould get lost.",
        "Q: Were the Univad and the Jewish police, were they --?",
        "A: In our ghetto, we did not have Jewish police. The Jewish police was in the bigger\nghettoes like Warsaw, Vilna (ph), Veilostok (ph), large, you know. But in the smaller\ntown there, we are talking about a city right now that prior to World War -- to the\noutbreak of the war probably, maybe, had 3,000 people in total population. So, you\nknow, and then there was an influx of the refugees, you know, more like the way I said\nthat we came. At the time when the ghetto was created, some Jews escaped from other\nghettoes and they came in here. So, our ghetto, I would say from that city at that\nparticular time, when we are talking about in the Rachen (ph) probably must have been\nmaybe 2500 or 3,000 people of population in all. In the ghetto, there was no more than\nabout a thousand to 1200 people.",
        "Q: Were the members of the Univad good to you? Were they good people?",
        "A: That's a bad question and you'll please forgive me for saying this. Serving in a Univad\ncould never have been a good and bad question because when the Gestapo imposed that\nyou have to deliver and they used to have to go from door to door and really knock on the\ntable and say, \"You are going to turn it over or we have to turn the house apart and you\nare going to have to give it if you have gold, or if you have money.\" You know, they\nwere searching and doing partially before their scheme, and second of all, that was the\nonly way you could do it in those days. It was not a matter that someone was going to go\nto their bank and take out, you know, what I mean, from the hiding and take out his gold\nor money. There was no such thing. Anything what anybody has, was told all the time in\nhiding, people would have buried some things that in case they're searched or anything\nlike that. We had to go ahead to buy things from the local population or through them to\nsatisfy the Germans. So we didn't have gold but there was money available to be gotten\ntogether, American dollars or whatever these people had it, so the means was that the\nGermans did not look for us to better ourselves. They would come at the worst, they can\nmake how much more miserable in the ghetto could become. And this was part of the, as\nI used that word, the dehumanization program that it went out to suck, like to say sucking\nour blood. Picture when you cannot wear, the men cannot wear -- the fur that men used to\nwear was inside fur. I'm not talking about the people of old Mensk (ph), you know, but\nthe average person. Used to take from a lamb skin this part if it was a healthy one, so he\nhad it to the outside finished, you see, and so it was sewn in things and it was decorative\nand so on. But the poor guy had something else, a fur lining 1n there to keep him warm\nbecause that was a good item to keep away from the cold. Now you had to turn all of that\nin. So, what I did, I had a piece of fur in a car coat and I took that and sewed on a lining\nto cover it. Sure you tell me, Harold, what would happen if they would discover it? If\nthey discovered me with it, I'm dead. I ran away to the forest with that thing. But, you\nhave a risk to life. This is why I still say to this day, not only were we heroes in the\nforest, everyone in the ghetto, everyone in concentration camp who managed to survive,\nis a hero because that was exactly anti- what Hitler wanted. So no matter by what means,\nthat one could prolong life and survive, that is the heroism that the people of our stature\nlike myself. Sure, I am happy that I went to the forest and had the opportunity to lead a\nplatoon and to go ahead and do diversionary work like burning bridges, downing\nrailroads, as I get to it a little bit later. But every time I could, of not giving the enemy\nwhat they wanted out of me, I already was a hero at that time. And so, getting killed;\nsure. That's what the meaning was. That's what we were waiting for. And the people of\nsound sense knew about the time that we had. However, a lot of people in the ghettoes\nstill believed that a miracle or something will happen and they will be able to survive.\nBut, those who are hoping for the survival to come, like this here, did not survive. Those\nwho acted in no means or ways, we would have run away, did whatever they did,\nsurvived. No 100 percent, but a bigger percentage survived and that's what it was the\ncase. So, as I was saying at that particular time, I, my little family was split and my\nbrother was helping out. He was the helping hand there. And then one morning, which I\nhad that chapter in my own manuscript, the 33 pages. And I called it my \"Escape to the\nForest\" and I want to tell you in detail right now how that came about until I came to the\nforest.",
        "Q: Okay. I want you to tell me all that, but I just want to ask you a little bit more about the\nghetto?",
        "A: Good. You go ahead. You're commanding me and I'm listening.",
        "Q: Within this ghetto, I know it wasn't a big place like Lojur (ph) and Warsaw. Was there\nany semblance of normal life, in terms of friendships or activities? I'm trying to get a\nsense of what it was like living there?",
        "A: Okay. The important thing, the life, for instance, picture yourself at a house, for instance,\nof European standard, at the area where I'm referring to. A house consisted of maybe two\nor three rooms. Now, these two or three rooms, if a family was living there with 3 or 4\nkids, was not accommodating, as you know. Picture that same house now, putting in ten\nfamilies. Now, you picture ten families, ten families cramped into a place like that.\nSomebody's going to pick on someone. \"How come you snore?\" \"How come you keep\nwaking up in the middle of the night?\" So therefore, when you say, when you use that\nword normal, that's a word impossible to refer to at that era because that's what the Nazis\nplanned. Then you are going to be so cramped in, you're not going to be able to live with\neach other. And that's what they want. Therefore, you cannot unit; therefore you cannot\ndo all these things like that. So, during the day men and women were out at work and it\nwas not bad. But, at night, can you picture; it's like sardines in the cans. Kids, no kids,\neverything was together. There wasn't a question. Even if there was one kitchen, I mean\none part, and if somebody could go ahead to boil some water. It was all tragedy; where\ndo you get the wood to use to make, you know, the firewood. To have to prepare\neverything became a problem. And know, who's going to be first to use, if they had some\nthings. If they had some food, they had to hide it because somebody will take it. They did\nnot take it with a gun or a stick; they'll take 1t one way or the other. So all of this here, to\nuse that word as I said before, the Univad; no, the Univad was not made to please the\nJews. The Univad was a sign for the Germans to have a conduit between them and every\ndweller in them and they would put out the clothes, for instance they needed to have a\ncount. Everyday they had to present a count. And when somebody died, to go ahead and\ntake them for burial, again, that was all going through. There was one thing about it, they\ndid keep good records, the Germans, and they knew. However we out smarted them. No\nghetto ever had the amount of Jews in there. It always had less in their ways. So\ntherefore, I'm coming to what I said. Food was the big problem to cause and why it was\nbecause we knew it from here and from the other. There are too many Jews in this so they\nhave to kill. So when they killed out, just for the sake of talk, if a thousand people were,\naccording to the accounting, was over there with the Nazis and they killed out 500, all of\na sudden if you were to take a head count, really, you'd find out there was probably 700\nto 800. So, how many to keep up the lease and how to keep that, was never a factual\nthing that everybody knew. But everyone looking around him could see from another\nghetto that all of a sudden we had another few people that was not here. So, it was dog\neat dog and everybody was not telling the truth to each other because you couldn't.\nEverybody shivered; they were scared for their own head. You never knew when it was.\nAnd on the other hand, it's very hard for me to make a person understand how we did not\nbecome insane and all of us lose our senses, to kill ourselves off first. Do you follow me?\nWhen I came to New York in March of 1948 and I gathered with my wife to the family,\nuntil 2 o'clock in the morning when I told them. The question came, \"So, how did you\nsurvive?\" and, \"Since it was so terrible, did you tell us a story or, we believe what you\ntold us is true, so how did you survive?\" And this is the miracle. If you believe in\nmiracles, every survivor survived by way of a miracle. He was not that smart; he was not\nthat schooled. He had plans and that helped him survive. If you have a more questions\nabout the ghetto, I will gladly fill you in.",
        "Q: You, so I think what you are saying 1s that you didn't resembled the Univad; they did\nwhat they had to do. Is that what you are telling me?",
        "A: Absolutely. I personally, I speak for myself in this case and I hope every person who I'm\nsaying understood them. That's why we listened and we tried to do what they wanted us\nto do.",
        "Q: Another question, when we've changed take place, 1s were you able to practice your\nreligion at all during the ghetto?",
        "A: There was no such thing. I said it to you the story about my uncle. I did not get to tell you\nthe rest of that, that by his demands, I took as we call a shatz (ph). A shatz is six of the,\nyou know, the Homaj (ph), the Tomat (ph) and all of that, and he had all these books and\nI told you about the alta dufar (ph), he made me take a whole set which it was a Torrah\nand other religious things and I built it underneath the roof to make a double and put it in\nthere. Again, as I aforementioned, would they find it what would they do? They would\nkill. But they'd kill anyways. But I pleased him to death. I liked him and I discussed with\nhim some of the things. Like he would tell me at one time, and when I told you when I\ncame there was killing. He said, \"Look, you are a student,\" he said to me. \"And you are a\nvery good student. You remember what happened in Spain, that what they did to the Jews\nand all of that.\" He says, \"God had an opportunity at that time to play with the Jews of\nSpain because they were devoted. He knew that they will not put him down. But can you\nimagine if the Jews of today were to give a choice, what would happen?\" he said. \"What\nwould happen?\" This is how much devotion he, my father, my grandfathers, all of these\nhere people, there was no \"ifs\". There was, that is the way.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: I will have to come to you to tell you about my escape. This is how, we called it a\nselection.",
        "Q: Okay. If you're going to get to that, that's fine. You mentioned something that I just\nwanted to ask you about?",
        "A: Did we have that story part about hiding their religious things on the tape before? No. We\ndidn't put it in.",
        "Q: Okay so, you were talking about your uncle?",
        "A: I often used to, after work, have discussions with my uncle, not about my wanting to, but\nby his making me talk. Maybe in his way, it was a means of keeping my moral going\ninstead of down. And he would talk religious things. In one particular day that I vividly\nremembered, and we were working already that day about digging the big pit as I have\naforementioned before. And I literally had seen on that particular day, some gross,\ninhumane ways of the way a policeman, because the way it used to be over there, there\nwas maybe two Germans and maybe 10 or 12 from the police. That's the way it used to\nbe. They used to use a couple of Germans and the local people who were drafted as\npolicemen or so on, they were the ones. And, of course, they had the \"life of Riley;\" their\nfamily, nothing was done to their families but good things and all that they robbed from\nJews were free for them to, for their families to have and to enjoy. So, that particular day,\nI had seen a if you occasions where the guy was bidding the guy at work for no other\nreason but just his blood-thirstiness was in him to show off to the German that he needs\nto be promoted because he is doing, really, the job that the Germans wanted. So, then he\nstarted beating on that particular person. It was at first, you know, the guy was starting to\nyell; the more the guy yelled, the harder the beating went on. So, if you could make sort\nof to yourself or a thing to remember; when they beat you, you perhaps don't cry so\nmuch, so they don't get the enjoyment, realizing how much you hurt. So, if you didn't cry\nat all, they beat you a lot; if you did cry a lot, they beat you a lot. So which way to\nchoose? You had no way to choose. If you survived, you survived and if you didn't, you\nwere left maybe to bleed to death or whatever it is. And then they would ask some Jews,\nto ask the Jews to go ahead to the burial place and the burial place could be anyplace, and\nput them in there, as a reward to them, they were shot and they would bring up. So\nsometimes it used to be going up. I remember times when they used to bring the big\ntrucks in our area. In our area, they experimented a lot of things but few, if ever, were\ntaken to the main concentration camps as we know, the Auschwitz, the Buchenvald (ph)\nor the other one. Of course, we found an uncle's brother first and he related that he was\nfrom Sladen, the city aforementioned, and he was taken among many more. So, I don't\nwant to rule it out, so I say it the way it is. In our place, we did not know or any round\nups that were made to that I them to concentration camps.",
        "Q: Did you know about the camps?",
        "A: We didn't. We didn't, in our area, until we did not get out of the forest, and we found out\nthat Jews were remaining a life and they were in concentration camps. The important\nthing, when I use that word \"dehumanization\" was another part; lack of communication.\nThe Jews could not get papers, the Jews could not hear anything. But every ghetto\nUnivad would pay basically to send Gentiles to the Slovan (ph) ghetto or to the other\nghetto to find out what's going on. What everybody wanted to do was to learn a lesson:\nhow to survive. Unfortunately, they paid their way and the survival was not in place\nbecause what they did not ghetto in Slonya, not necessarily did they do in the ghetto in\nJatel (ph) or in the Rachen or someplace else. They wanted always that surprise, that\ndifferent way so Jews did not have an opportunity of surviving or resisting. They did it\nboth ways. They used to get the round ups where all the population was driven out, even\nthe Valde Univad was to the marketplace, and line up over there and it was the right, left,\nright, left idea. And one morning, that's what it was the case. And I usually knew one\nman in the Univad quite well because he happened to be a personal friend for many years\nfrom before the war of my father. He was a personal friend. So a lot of times when a\nround up used to happen, since he was in the Univad, I would go ahead to ask him\nwhether the Univad has any knowledge what's going to take place. That round up, what it\nhappens to be now, I've been denied before somehow or other the rumors; rumors were,\nall the time we were living with rumors, all the time. And the rumors one day happened.",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "A: That's still I'm talking about in the ghetto like before. Year, approximately again, because\nI escaped in 1942. So we are dealing with the era within '41 and ' 42, May. See, that's the\ninterim period, that's when I'm talking ghetto life, you know. Because I escaped at that\nparticular time, about this time of year, more or less, which is April; that's when I\nescaped. It was like the spring of the year. We did not have calendars, believe me, to\nknow exactly. So I went to him, Veinstock (ph) was his name. And he says to me,\nHarold, you don't know anything about it. Because, I, on a number of occasions, had my\nhiding place where I used to not show. And therefore I wanted to know at that time, too.\nMy horse that I had, by that time was gone already. I did not have any horse and wagon.\nSo, I did not, I couldn't go; I had to do the different kind of chores that I did before, so I\nwound up at that round up in the morning. That morning they all came out. Fritz was the\nname of the head from the ghetto, from the Gestapo by us, and he used to be a lover of\nhorseback riding. And he came out with a big whip in his hands. The whip they didn't use\nfor the horse, but that whip, that used to be his best way. That was a special love affair, it\nlooks like for them, beating a person much more than shooting or killing them. They used\nto have their victims done so that they begged to be dead because that's how they used to.\nAnd we were made lines and in every line, there were police in the middle. So, I mean,\nyou had a police line in this line, you had a police line, and we were the column together.\nSo you couldn't move or you couldn't turn and at one times that's what we were told to do\nand we were searched, sort of displicably, to see. And at first they would say, \"Anybody\nwho has knives or any weapons to throw them out,\" you know. \"If found, will be shot.\"\nWe were, at that particular time, picked out approximately 350, give or take, or 400, all\nyoung people in most cases. Some middle aged people, too, the same way. When the\nselection, it used to be called selection, as it's known; when the selection ended, Fritz on\nhis horse, some police and Germans on motorcycles formed a column on the side and we\nwere told to run, who knows where? Before long, we knew we were running on the street\nthat was leading to Slonov (ph) and of course, they were changing all the guys who were,\nfor instance, keeping us and running alongside of us, were given a place to go into the\ntrucks that were following and stuff like this, so they got in case we got worn out. And\nour guys from the running and beating each time, you would see a few guys were left on\nthe side. Those who were left on the side were left. In other words, if some of them\nsurvived and could escape someplace is a question because behind were trucks and with\nthe trucks, they could see and they had their machine guns tuned easily. So I don't know\nwhat happened because I was not there. What I saw, the way of the scenery went up, we\nwere driven all the way to Slonum (ph). Slonum between the Rechen was approximately\nabout give or take about 40 kilometers, and 40 kilometers, as I say, is less than 20 miles,\nbut you just take and start running under the circumstances for the 20 miles and you just\nsee what is left of that, you know. So, the majority I would say, if at all, we were left\nabout 150 people. That would have been -- I did not count, so I don't want to put the\nfinger, and it was given to me, but were driven into the jail in Slonov. In that jail we\nfound people from other surrounding small towns around who were also, probably been\nthrough a similar situation. A Gestapo man came in in order to keep quiet and we\nshouldn't talk. That was the means, a shot was fired. \"Ach tung (ph),\" they yelled. And\nthat's when the Commandant came in and he started instructions that you will be\nmarching to work, and giving us all the stories. \"Anyone of you who fails to do his job\nwill be executed immediately at once.\" The next morning we were taken again, I was\nwith a group so I don't know how many, but all the jail was empty. We were taken to the\nrailroad. At the railroad beyond a reasonable doubt, we have seen a train, like it was\npartially of, maybe it was tipped over, you know, some of it. Later on, I knew what it was\nbecause I was already knowing that it was a de-railment caused by the partisans. It\nconsisted of bombs, you know, whether they had the capsules in there, I don't know. I\nwasn't that kind of an expert to tell you, but they were all crated and we were asked to get\nall of this here back on the trains and load it up. And the yelling and beatings, the normal\nsituation; that was the lexicon now. At night we were driven to jail again and we were\ngiven something to eat which it looked like soup and a slice of black bread. The soup was\nlike a mixture of corn meal with water, not like this here, but as hungry as everybody\nwas, they were ready to eat each other, you know what I'm saying? And the next morning\nwhen we got out of jail, a new assignment awaiting us, they drove us again on a road\nwhich the road was a connecting road between Slonov and a city called Lida. And on that\nroad, near a small community town called Kovlofschezna (ph) and Puzavich (ph); it's a\nname you'll find on the maps. I have the maps with me at any time if you need it, with a\nlot more information than you think, such as how many escaped to the forest at times\nfrom ghettoes and the annihilation. So if you need any of that information, I have it yet.\nSo, over there you were put in three barns. There were three barns only; there was an\noffice and we saw a military kitchen. Otherwise, surrounding, it looked like everything\nwas with barbed wire around, even if it was a labor camp. Immediately when we were\nlined up over there, I think there were maybe two Germans in all and it must have been\nUkrainian and the other Russian police over there. They were supposed to be our\nwatchers and so on. And after the line up, we were told that we were going to build a\nroad. Actually, they started to build roads, you know, and that's what they did. And we\nwere to be the -- and I don't have to tell you building roads, it's heavy work and here you\nwere working with people who hardly got enough food to sustain themselves. So\neveryday there used to be casualties. So, I mean, I mention that really, before you ask me\nabout it. There were casualties everyday. We thought, being shot, but just beating, beaten\nto death. One day it happened to me. I got a beating. I got a beating by the foreman,\nsupposedly. He was a Pole and at one time when he talked to me and I'm realizing that\nhe's Polish, I spoke to him in Polish and sort of, and he started beating on me. He says, \"I\nhave to do it. If I don't do it, I'll be beaten.\" Because his superiors, this is how the chain\nof command was. You are told that you have to so don't dare not to, because if not, you're\ngoing to get a beating. And, I was out. First out, he took water, you know the military\nbuckets with water, poured over my head and revived me. And I came through, you know\nwhat I mean. I thought, it's just like coming through from death. Understand, I didn't\nbelieve it. He says, \"Look, I didn't want to do it what I did, but I had to do it.\" And I\nthanked him yet. I said, \"Thank you.\" He revived me, he tossed me a piece of bread\nafterwards and that's how my day of work ended and we came back to the barn. So, when\nI say a barn to you, how do you picture a barn? As you see, a barn in Europe 1s built a\nlittle different than the barns in the United States because here they keep, which I've seen\nthe way it is, but in that barn there were two like layers, wood and straw, so it was a top\nand I bottom. Nothing to cover yourself, heavens forbid, or, you know, now we talk\nabout mattress. That's what I told you. It was lots. And all of a sudden, you say what's\ngoing to be the case? And before long, a delegation came from the ghettoes and they\nbrought supplies. I had no one to send me supplies. I didn't have anybody. But I see and I\nfound out, they paid off enough to let it happen. They got some soap, they got some\nthread, they got some salt, little things, you know what I mean like this here. I quickly\ngot myself another friend, you know, you make association. I says, we got to survive. He\nwas from the other side of the road from the small towns.",
        "Q: Your brother was not with you?",
        "A: No. No, my brother was left there yet. I'll tell you the story about my brother when it\ncomes later. I decided we're going to go black marketeering under the eyes of them.\nAgain, necessity is the mother of invention. I got, each of the barns were assigned to\nsomeone in charge. In other words, you are responsible that the orders are carried out. I\ntook him to the side and I says, \"Look, the people got here thread, they got here this. I\nand are willing to go ahead and go out by night. We'll get to the farmers and maybe we'll\nbe able to bring some food.\" So, this here, you know, that's how you bartered sort of.\nThey give you this and you barter to bring maybe some old bread, old potatoes, or\nwhatever it 1s. And it was risky again. They say, you risked your life. Of course. You\ncould be killed. Of course. You knew that death is looming every move you make. No\nhiding. But it took determination, like I had, to lead on. Let's go. And on a few occasions,\nthree times we did it. The third time was a longer time until we came back to base and\nthat head of ours, the supervisor, says no more. He says, \"I couldn't sleep. I was worried\nstiff. Maybe they catch up with you and if they catch up with you, they'll come and they'll\nmurder us all.\" He says, \"Harold, that's 1t. You're not going anymore.\" Fine. Lucky for us,\nabout two nights after that, the partisans came and they broke camp. And, of course, the\nGermans and the police ran away. They came dressed with white sheets like the Ku Klux\nClans were; I didn't know it then, but I know it now. They wore robes, not with the thing\non the top, but the bottom. Because the moon was shining at night and with a white sheet\nover, you cannot see objects and that was their camouflage. They had machine guns with\nthem. The first time I saw like soldiers dressed in uniform, like it was from the Red\nArmy, the way they left us. What is that? They told us we are partisans; we don't want\nthat road to be built. You have two choices, either to be killed by the Germans or we'll\nkill you. We don't want that road to go through the forest and you are going to choose\nwhichever way. Tomorrow you have a choice to break out. They're going to kill our\nfamilies behind. We have told you. There was no compromise. I ran over and started\ntalking. \"I would like to join you.\" No, you can't join me now. I says, \"Then what good 1s\nall your talk?\" Okay. We decided, the mean the head of barn and all of it, next morning\nthat we are not going anyplace. We are waiting here. That the Germans, mind you, how\nbad it was that we have to cooperate with the enemy instead of working against. The first\nthing everybody said, we'll wait over. If no police or commands had shown up, we'll\ndecide what to do. After nobody the whole day came, all of a sudden, understand, you\nwere afraid even to move about or to know what to do. So trained were we as it would be\nlike robots. No one dared to say, hey, I am with you. And why? This is what I mean when\nI said the dehumanization program. That's how successful the Germans were, to instill\nthat fear. That was the cooperation they got from us because of that fear. That looks like\neverybody knew he was going to die, or going to be killed. But it was sort of a own\npersonal desire, maybe not today and maybe not tomorrow, you know. So you did not,\nyou know, if you went the other way around, so you were dead; that's all. No big deal.\nThen when the partisans, like I say, so the next day they didn't come. The next day\neveryone went on their own and in small groups through the forest. We did not have a\ncompass either. But we knew more or less the direction and the hope of the group that I\nwas with were all from the Rachen. We said, hope, let us find partisans. We did not want\nto come back to that ghetto, but where do you go. You cannot start a partisan on your\nown; you have no weapons, you have nothing. I say at that time, we made groups of\nabout 20, no more. Because, again, of self-preservation. If the police catch you, it will be\n50, they'll kill 50. So, they would better kill 20 or whatever it is. And everything had to\nbe thoughtful and organized. While on the way walking, when we came to parts where\nthere were farmers, in the morning we saw the smoke coming out of the chimneys, you\nheard the noises from the livestock and so on, they would go in back some of the farmers\nresponded favorably. They'd say, \"Well, we just got through breakfast.\" You know what I\nmean and they would give us, otherwise would give us a bigger part of bread, you know,\nto take along or whatever they could. Other ones would lock the door. \"You better get out\nof here before I'm going to kill you. The Germans find out that I helped you, they'll kill\nus.\" Other ones were overwhelmed with fear and didn't want to help us. And you couldn't\nafford to fight, you know. The fact remains on three days it took us marching like that\nuntil we came to the ghetto. We didn't meet a partisan. Nowhere, as we marched. We\ndidn't realize where the partisans, sure by night you would have probably run into\npartisans. By night we stood in the forest and slept. After working all day, if somebody\nwould get up near you, you probably couldn't hear it either. You know what I mean. You\nwere weak enough already. We made it to the ghetto, looks like the ghetto knew about it,\nthe Univad, and there was sort of no punishment on us or anything like that. On the\nsecond day, a guy comes over to me. And I came back. I started to organize a group, guys\nthat I knew from the ghetto, and I had 22 guys that are willing to escape with me to the\nforest. And I have gave them an order, already was in my mind a commander. I said,\n\"Tonight, everybody says goodbye to their families. Not tomorrow, not maybe, but\ntonight.\" That included myself; I came home, got my people together. Not from my\nbrothers and sister and uncle, because my grandpa was no longer alive. When I came\nback from that, my uncle told me that grandpa died. I still don't believe he died. What I\nmean is, I think he committed suicide, where he didn't want to tell me that. I went over\nand called him to the side and I said, \"I'm deciding to leave, after I told you what had\ngone on with the partisans, maybe I'll get to join them.\" I said, \"I cannot take my brother\nwith. You need him here to help you.\" It was punishing me many years of my life of how\nI left my brother behind. I had no way out, taking him. This way I hoped he'll help the\nothers. Then I said goodbye to him, to my uncle, which I wasn't ready yet. He had still an\nAmerican $20 bill because they used to send it to my grandpa, money to him from the\nUnited States. He sewed it in my pants in case I'll have money for something. Then I\ncame to the family of my father, my aunts, and uncle and I tell them. They all roused up.\n\"Look, what would your father say? What would your mother say? What would this one\nsay? Because of you, the Germans will kill us.\" And I was strong enough in my mind. I\nsaid, \"No. You want me to die with you. Because of me, the Germans will not kill you.\nBut that's what you wish. You might think that it's going to be better for you, that I'll die\nwith you, but I have decided that if I die, I'll die alone. But I will fight not to die.\" And\ntherefore, it started the fights and I left the house. And where did I come? I came into the\nsynagogue. In the synagogue, people were living there, too; 1t was no more synagogue\nservices. People were living on the floors and my uncle came after me, which it was, he\nwas actually a first cousin to my father and he was married to my father's sister. That\nsame uncle used that hiding place which I had built for myself and during the massacre,\nhe and his younger son came to the forest and with cries and hugs, he says, \"I wish we'd\nall listened to you.\" To make a long story short, after that it happened. I did not want to\ngo back to the house there to be with them. I ran away to go to my next in command. He\nwas with two sisters and a mother; no father. No sooner did I open up the door, his\nmother jumps on me, grabs me, \"Tomorrow I'm turning you in to the Gestapo.\" I says,\n\"What's wrong with you? I just came to tell Capel (ph) was his name, I just came to tell\nCapel that I resigned from the whole thing; we're not going.\" \"Oh, that's good.\" And I\nleft. Since nothing came out, a couple of days later when we were going to the line up of\nthe Univad, a man walks over to me. His name was Schumel Bilinstein (ph). He\nsurvived; he's in Israel right now. Through him I got the book about Dr. Atlas. It was\npublished for him. He wrote it in Polish and it was translated into Hebrew. But it looks\nlike there was no one to translate it into English. You know, it's a lot involved and it's one\nchapter, you know. If I ever could do it, get the rights if my book was published, I would\nprobably incorporate it, but I still so far have doubts about it. He says, \"Harold, I want to\nspeak to you. I understand you are organizing a group to escape to the forest.\" I was\nshivering just from the sound of what he was talking to me. I said, \"You must be mixing\nme up with somebody else. You are crazy.\" He hugged me; he says, \"Please, Harold. I\nknow what I'm talking about. I talk to you because I want to join you. I can help you. I've\ngot with me a girl who was a nurse and she had helped amputate the part of the arm from\na captain who 1s in the forest that we know. So if you take us, we'll be of help to you. I\nhave one more guy who is from another ghetto, an escapee who wants to join us.\" \"Well,\"\nI said, \"no.\" I did not want to admit, but evaluating the facts of the nurse and so on, I said,\n\"T'll tell you. I've reached a decision. Tomorrow at 6 o'clock, whoever shows at the fence\nas soon as night falls, we are going to escape. Do you guys have weapons?\" He says no.\n\"I have a bayonet outside of the ghetto near that little river.\" I says, \"I know where it 1s.\nAt least we'll have one weapon.\" The next thing, I did not want to talk about it anymore; I\nwas too much in pain. I wouldn't go back home for that night, for that time that we came\nhome from work. The next day, I told my brother; I went over to him, the younger one.\nThat was my way of saying goodbye to him. I says, \"Take my car coat to the tailor.\" We\nknew a tailor who also survived later in the massacre; Nvetsky (ph) was his name. \"Take\nit to him and he'll have to sew on something for me.\" Really, that was just an excuse for\nme to sort of see him for the last time, which it was. He did. He took my car coat there. I\ndidn't go inside but my youngest sister or brother, I couldn't face them anymore. As soon\nas he left the coat, I saw him from a distance; I saw the guys scatter because there's one\nthing I told him, when you come, do not come as a group. You must come distantly\nseeing each other, not as a group. And they listened. As soon as I saw him, I ran in and I\ntook the, no, I took the coat from him before he had gone into the house, from the tailor. I\nsays, \"I must go someplace right now.\" And I ran away.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "A: We would know that no matter how much there is, when singled out, it never was in any\ncatastrophe, or in any event what it happens. If everybody could think positive,\nobviously, Hitler would never be able to succeed. But because he could divide and\nconquer . . (empty space in the tape) . . to give all the time, about the fights. And mind\nyou, that town of the Rachen, as partisans we occupied later. We held it for three weeks.\nBut, this little group of mine that we come to the forest, could not convince the\ncommander to attack it before. Later, after the massacre we attacked. Okay, I know\nwhere I stopped right now.",
        "Q: Oh, you do?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Good.",
        "A: As I aforementioned, to relocate my story right now, my rest of the guys, two men and\none young lady, were getting to the point where we are to meet. I met with them and I\nsaid, \"Now, it's a little bit too light yet. I did not want anyone to see that we are going to\nhave to dig our way out underneath the wires. So we must wait until dusk comes, a little\nbit darker.\" And I know people were not on the outside in those days, in other words. But\nstill and though for the if and I wanted to dig out my bayonet from underneath there for\nthat. So I waited until it turned a little bit darker and we started with our bare hands. We\ndid not have no shovel; with our bare hands to dig a path underneath because it was in the\nground, that's on the other end, and it was the time of year when it wasn't frozen. And we\nmade a dig over there so that we were able to lift up the wire and one by one, we slid on\nthe other side, pushed back the sand to demarcation, so it should not be a mark seen that\nsomeone was doing that. And, we immediately went to the place where I said I had put\nmy bayonet in there. And I had a part of a piece of grass over there that I knew once I\npulled it out, I wouldn't have to dig because I wanted to be on the ready with it. I got my\nbayonet, put on my car \"and everybody held whatever they had with them. That's all we\nhad, was coats. We didn't have anything else. And we started on our way. I knew my\ndirections and I therefore, at this time I'm explaining it to them. I says, \"Look straight\nahead and you'll see from a distance the lights. That's where the hospital is. We cannot go\nthis way straight because we may run up on police or Germans. So, what we will have to\ndo is go out of way until we cross the main road leading from Zulva (ph) to the Rachen to\nSlonya (ph). That was the main artery road. Once we crossed the road, we have to go to\nthe other position. So, I explained to them that that's going to be, and I explain to them\nthat that's going to be, and I tell them, \"We are not going to go like a column, but we're\ngoing to be spread out.\" So, the four of us, in case someone sees, you know, should not\nbe able with one shoot to do it. So, we will keep distance, distant enough. We will not\ntalk loud at all. If you have to say something to somebody, come over, make a marker to\nstop and we'll talk because we definitely do not want anyone to hear. The language that\nwe will talk will be Russian and, in part, we will talk Polish. So, that 1f somebody should\nhear us, should hear any of the two languages; but definitely, by all needs, no Yiddish. To\ncamouflage our whereabouts and who we are. We came, as I showed it to the road and\nwe Started to check and in the same spread out wing, we ran through the road. It was not\na big road. We ran through the road, away from the road, inland, which it was like shrubs\nand so on. And we turned, as I say, and I knew exactly the locations where it was going\non by this particular time. We had to turn a little bit forward ahead because we were\ngetting to be closer to the place where in that forest, that little forest area, they were\nmaking a big dig which I said. And be that it is at night, I still was afraid who knows\nwhether police or Germans, you know what I mean, may not be in the vicinity on the\nother side. So, everything was thought out by me and I outlined, I explained it to them,\nthat's what it's going to be. And after that, we have to cross another artery road which was\nleading into the Rachen and then with the fields alongside that other road, we would walk\nuntil it becomes forest. Forested area, from that point of view that we were from the city\nof the Rachen would be about maybe 10 kilometers, here you're talking about five miles;\nthat forest would start. So it was a smaller forest area, where they used to have hay, you\nknow, to cut hay. And at certain times of the year, there used to be water, you know; it\nwas not that you could sink in, but 1t used to be the water. That's why they used to, some\nof them, have to store their hay on elevated things for the farmers so in the winter they\ncould come back with sleds and get the hay for the feeding of their cattle and so on. We\ndid achieve that and I explained it to them: by good working through the night, we should\nachieve a target which it was called at that time, there was maleojaky (ph) and\nbulchenavitz (ph), the small lakes was called one settlement and the bigger lakes was the\nother settlement. I knew that I had some Gentiles, farmers, over there that I dealt with,\nwith the hope that may be they could help us out. I also did not mention over here that in\nthe winter, I was working with a fishermen's crew while in the ghetto and this crew\npurposely was sent to bring fresh fish for the Germans. So, while we were working on the\nice over there and wherever we were sleeping, they were given barns to sleep in, so I\nknew again. So I tell them, I says, \"Tonight, this was going to be for me to know that I'm\non target. I'll have to hear that much. And, we'll have to go out to the road to see because\nthere's signs, certain signs on the road. So we planned in the little forest away from it,\nover there we will have to spend the day. And that's what we were planning to be our\nmarch, which we were talking about give or take at that night to make no more than\nabout 10 to 12 miles. Because, remember, we cannot march. We did not have our dinners\nand suppers and breakfasts before going, so we sort of gone, it was sort of carrying us,\nthe will was doing it, not that physically we were built to be able to do it. And as\nprescribed, we came to the same, I said the small pond. There were more than one pond,\nso let's call it pond instead of, you know, water ponds. And now by that particular time\nthat we got that far, we were already seeing that daylight was coming. And with daylight\ncoming, we were fearful; we were fearful of anything. We were fearful for the forest, we\nwere fearful for the road. So we decided to break and go into the forest, find a bushy\nplace and one would stay awake while the other three would be asleep and we would sort\nof maneuver around. So it was all planned out well and that's how it was done. They\nrealized in the morning, now, you will see the shepherds because the area used to bring\nout the cattle for the grass feeding and so on. And at night, evening time, they were taken\nback. So since we didn't eat all night and the walking, so we decided to send Heinka, was\nthe girl's name, Heinka, that I said she was a nurse. Somehow or other, a female could\ncamouflage their way more as a farm girl or farmhand than we, as men. And she was\nspeaking good Polish or good Russian so we decided to send her out, to the closest\nchimney, so out to the edge of the forest and you could see the smoke coming through the\nchimney, so that means, they were over there. So, we picked a singled out farmer, away\nfrom all the rest, and she went in there. She said to them that she is looking for work and\nshe mentioned settlements quite in the area where we were, going to hit; in other words,\nthat she comes from Warla. Warla was the name of, I don't know how to translate Warla,\nthe meaning of it in English. But, you know, when a chicken, where the food comes in\nover there on the little part, that's a Warla, for instance. You know what I'm saying. So,\nthat's the pocket over there. So, that was a name, also there was a Big Warla and the\nSmall Warla. So, she was saying that she comes from that. And why Warla? That was\npoor farming over there. There was nothing but sands so the fields were so bare they\ncould only grow red potatoes. And the people from the settlements used to come to the\nforest to work to earn a living, or there was a place where they used to make turpentine\nand the other one. So all of them used to, that was their means of making a living. So she\npretended, because often people from that would be looking for farm work. And she\ncame in to that woman, and told her that she was looking for work, and if they could use\nher. And they told her, no, they can't. She says, \"Do you mind sharing some food with\nme? I don't have any.\" And the woman asked her to sit down and eat but she did not want\nto. She says, \"Give me some food.\" And she brought, you know what I mean a piece of\nbread and everything like that. Now, all four of us were sharing it and we decided to sort\nof sleep awake, awake and sleep; you know what I'm saying? So we heard the shepherds\ncoming nearby with their cattle and shepherds usually baked potatoes; that's the old time\ntrick which shepherds would do. They'd make them in the fire. So we hoped that some\npotatoes is going to be left, which, again, if they cannot eat it, they're not taking them\nwith. You cannot re-bake it. So, the same day after the shepherds left, we immediately\nwent to follow these places to see and dig in and sure enough, we did find a few potatoes\nthat were left over. So there again, we had our food source for the day and that's what it\nwas. And we decided to march again. So, to give you the perimeter, we would manage to\nbe, assuming in our language, about two to five hundred yards away from the road.\nTherefore, you saw the telephone poles as it was. So he could go by that perimeter\nbecause once you got into the forest, you forget where north and south and east and west\nis, you know what I mean? So, this sort of gave me like a compass-way, being in danger,\nwhen we heard any movement, either trucks or stuff like this here, we immediately\nretreated deeper into the forest and stay on guard, which it happened through the course\nof the night, that you would see some traffic going through. And our hope was, maybe\nwe'd encounter partisans so we can surrender to them and beg them for help. To make it a\nlittle bit shorter was, it took us three weeks until I finally stumbled on to one farmer --\nand here I want to explain something as a note, footnote. After two weeks almost walking\naround and not achieving anything, that same Soneg Bornstein (ph), he used to be in\nlarge, before the war, a columnist writer to a Jewish/Polish paper, in large, that guy. He\nsays, \"Harold.\" He says, \"I think we are losing track. Look at it. It's two weeks. We\nhaven't seen or heard one partisan.\" So, I said to him, we used to call him Sonic (ph), at\nthat time, like in Polish. I says, \"Sonic, so what do you want me to do?\" He says, \"Why\ndon't we take and make a vote whether we go forward or whether we go back.\" I says,\n\"You know, we were four of us. If all three of you want to go back, you are welcome. I\nam not going back. If I have to be killed, I'll be killed here. I'll go to achieve my goal,\nwhat I set forth to you.\" So, they looked sort of at each other and says, \"Well, we'll go\nwith you.\" I says, \"Let it be clear; I will not stop. I will not go back. I feel as bad as it is.\"\nUntil finally, one, a few, I mean because right away that it happened; it happened quite a\nfew days afterwards. And I'm already by distance into the bigger forest area. And over\nthere, they had more like colonists, you know, one farm, maybe two, three farms; you\nknow what I mean? But not a settlement anymore. And the settlement, the last one, was\nSlechy Podraberska (ph); again it's a name that's on the map, mapped out. And in front of\nthat settlement was the river Shars (ph). And on that river used to be, before the\nhostilities, it used to be a prom (ph) as we used to call it. A prom is like a passage way,\nyou know, that they lead it, that it's built like on barrels like this here. So they come and\nthey cross the cattle or trucks or whatever it is. And at that time, later on, the partisans\ndestroyed it by the way, because we did not want to make it easy on the Germans to be\nable, if they go to the police, to go through. We destroyed it and the Germans started to\nbuild a bridge that they wanted and after they built the bridge, we needed it too, so we let\nthe bridge be there. But that prom as we would call it, that passage way, we didn't like the\nidea. Not we, I mean, the partisans in general, the command decided that they were going\nto destroy it. So we come there and from distance I remember the house because I used to\ndeal with them often. The father was with one leg, and he was, and so I remember. And\nhis son was a blonde guy. I recognized that I knew him. As I come near, that dog is\nbeginning to bark. And the dog was on a chain, running around the farm. That dog just\nwas tearing my heart out, he wouldn't stop. Before long, they're in back of me and I'm at\nthe edge of the forest. All of a sudden, I see a guy coming out without his shirt on, in\npants, and I take a look. He has tatoos on his hands. With tatoos on his hands, it leaves\nme to believe immediately that he is Russian because local people did not have tatoos on\ntheir hand. It wasn't, but the Russians, quite a number of them, especially a lot of them\nwho used to serve in the Army or Navy for so many years and part of makeup, you find it\na lot. As I take a look and come closer, I see a gun. It is in his pocket, hanging out. I hope\nthat you will believe me that when I tell you is exactly the way it happened. I froze. He\npulled out the gun and he told me to stop, halt. I halted. And I say to him, I mentioned the\nfarmer's name. I say, \"I want to see him.\" And the son, after all of this here, seeing that\nthe -- the guy's name 1s Misha Dubakof (ph). He's a Soviet as I expected. I came out and I\nrecognized him, calling him by name. He said right now to the Soviet guy, or I will call\nhim to the easterners, is an easterner. He says, \"Put, Misha,\" he says, \"put your gun in\nyour pocket. That's a friend. I know who he 1s. Let me go ahead and talk with him.\" So I\nun-froze, sort of and I start going and I come in to him. I shook hands with Misha first,\nand then with him. And he starts asking me, \"What are you going here?\" I says, \"I'm\nlooking to join the partisans.\" I tell him the story already about it. He says, \"Tell them\nthey are safe. Let them come in here.\" I start, they saw me and what had happened, they\nimmediately run away further. Now I have a hard time with my yelling and talking,\nbringing them back to me. And I keep talking to them in Yiddish, basically to understand\nthat if I talk Yiddish, I'm safe. And I tell them, \"We are all right. Please come out here, all\nof you.\" And they finally come out and we all go into the house. I get that man from the\nhouse and I hug him and tell him, you know what I mean? By that time, he asks me about\nmy brother and this and that and the other. I says, \"I cannot tell you anything.\" I says,\n\"You know, I just escaped from the ghetto. It's been three weeks that I've been away from\nthere. I don't know. Have you heard anything?\" He says, \"No, nothing special had\nhappened. You usual.\" Because this gentle people used to keep, were the ones who would\nkeep tabs on the partisans in the same way, and they knew what had happened in the city.\nSo, at this particular time, he introduces me back to Misha Dubakof (ph), as he's the\npartisan. I says, \"I have one favor from you.\" I did not mention it at first. On my car coat,\nI removed the star I used to wear. At one time we were wearing round things, yellow, and\nat one time we were wearing the star. I did not remove that from the bottom, but I\nremoved it from the top that it shouldn't be seen. Be for what it's worth, . I says, \"Misha,\ndo me a favor and have the honors. I want you to cut this identity of mine. You know, as\nI use the word the shameful thing of recognition. And I says, \"From now on, I won't need\nit anymore.\" I says, \"I hope I can become a partisan.\" We are served to eat right now and\nfor the first time we are seeing food? And the farmer keeps talking to us, \"You can eat.\nEat.\" I says, \"We've not had food in months and months so much, so we'll just eat a little\nbit.\" And we thanked them, we did not know, crying, all of us, how to thank these people\nfor what they did to us and he explained to us that a commander in charge of the local\npartisans will be here maybe in a few, not tonight, but maybe in a few days. And Misha\nDubakof (ph) therefore, is taking charge of us and he is going to go ahead and keep us\ncomfort and covered until the, the name of the commander was Zotsof (ph). Zotsof 1s\nrabbit, from a, like Mr. Rabbit; you know what I mean? Zitz (ph). Zitzaf (ph) was like a\ntartar, if you know what I'm saying about a tartar. You know, there is a nationality in\nRussian, the Tartars. They are all short people and their skin is like with little holes and\nso on, not a smooth skin but like this here. This man was a lieutenant in the Army. He\nwas left; he did not want to go to the prison of war camps. And now I must tell you how\nthe partisans got started with. Like Misha Dubokof (ph), like Zitsof, many decided that\nthey did not want to fall into the hands of the Germans and they remained in the forest\nwith the retreating armies. What they used to do, find farmers who needed help. If maybe\nthe son was drafted or killed or whatever it is. So, they would cork for their keep, only\nfor room and board. By day, they would help him and if the Germans would come, or the\npolice would come to the area, they would be signaled by one another. They kept on a tab\nand they would escape to the forest to hide themselves. This is the way that the partisans\nreally had started. With the local people who had to run away because they were working\nwith the former Communist government, and they knew that they must stay away,\notherwise they would all be killed. So in certain areas, some of local area turned in those\npeople, to make good with the Germans; you follow me? So, between the local left overs\nthat were involved and between the retreating armies, those who didn't want to become\nprisoners of war, this is where they choose that life. And later on, the Germans got hold\nof it because the Volasof's (ph) Army already was surrendering and they had all a new\nArmy of Ukrainians who used to work for the Germans now and fill-in for whatever they\nneed, in local or on the front line. So the Germans permitted all the farmers who do need\nhelp, if they see a prisoner of war, because that's how they were able to get hold of the\nprisoners that were in hiding, that all they have to do is register them. Once they're\nregistered them, they can keep them as working. A lot of them did register and then they\nwent on the Germans side, joined the police force or anything like that. Others were\nreally killed; you know what I mean, by the Germans or sending them back to the camps.\nBut, I'm talking about those who succeeded in their mission to stay out, becoming POWs\nor working with the farmers and that's how the partisans started. At that particular time,\nthe partisans, I want to tell how the rest of it a little bit later, but I want to tell about us.\nWe had to wait a couple of nights until Zitsof (ph), as I'll use the name, Zitsof, which he\nwas the commander. And like I say, he still had the ammunition, leather jacket, and\neverything that he was wearing at the time when they retreated. And he was a very\nnervous kind of guy, heavy smoker and drinker, just as much. But he was a skillful\nshooter. He could go ahead and 1, 2, 3, you know what I mean, and aim target and have it\nthere. And I had the pleasure of meeting him at that time and all of us, so he came in and\none by one, we went for interviews with Zitsof. And I told him that I was sort of the\nleader of the group. I helped them out, told him about myself. He says, \"Tell me, what\nyou're doing is good. But, what do you think we have warehouses here with weapons? I\nknow you want to join. We'll take you in. Where are we going to get weapons for you?\" I\nsays, \"Where do you get weapons for the others? Tell me and I'll get them.\" \"Well,\nyou've got to go kill a policeman or German.\" I says, \"We are already. Whenever you go\nto, that you are going to do these kind of ways, to set up an ambush, we volunteer.\" He\nsays, \"Okay.\" He okayed us, all four and we had a good few drinks with him together to\nprove it, our loyalty and everything like that. And the day afterwards, we were taken to a\nsemi-camp. What was the camp? A wooded area deep over there with big palm trees. We\nused to spread out, you know what I mean, something underneath what they used to\ncover the horses with and that was your bed. You did not have no pillows. Your rifle was\nbetween your legs and that's how you were, you know, until you were, they used to have\nan Army, sort of, kitchen set up with a fork of the trees made, and buckets and that used\nto cook whatever we could get, you know what I mean? Because we would have to go to\nfarmers and wait for and ask, but this time we used to go with weapons and ask for food\nand we would get it. So, we had the first taste that we joined. The second news was that\nwe were going to have a ambush in the next few days and all of us would go. I was\nelected to climb up on the tree and be the observer. So I was given field glasses. All the\nother ones, there was a group altogether of about ten partisans and they heard the news\nthat Germans and the police and Fritz, which I had mentioned his name before, who was\nthe head of the Gestapo at this time. On this particular ambush, we, all right, Fritz remain\nwounded but he, they took him back, you know what I mean to the Rachen, but this is to\nthe Rachen ghetto at that particular time aware of partisans that was over there, but it\ndidn't do much good. There was no organization. So we went on that ambush and\nsucceeded. And I ran to get, the first thing I got was a pistol and I got a gun from\nsomebody else, I mean a rifle from somebody else. And before long, as you know, all of\nus had weapons. So, at least, but my job on the top of that tree was to signal to somebody\nat the bottom of how far and how many. The policemen were riding on bicycles and Fritz\nwas at that time on a carriage driving; that's how he used to drive. You know, he had,\nsitting like a king. You know what I mean, driving. And there was a contingent of maybe\n10 or 12, you know, call it, you know, that they wore over there. And what do you think\nthey used to do, come to the forests either to go ahead, take certain things that they\nwanted, food for themselves, you know, like ham and the other things. The farmers\nalways had it. Or if not, they went to go to come to the farmers to have a good time.\nThat's where they used to come in the junkets like this here. We attacked. They started to\nretreat, but one of them got killed right away. The other one injured, which we killed him\nanyways. And Fritz escaped. So this was my first participation as a partisan and I felt\nmyself right now ten feet tall. Here I got a pistol, got a rifle. Later the pistol I gave away\nto Zotsof. He didn't want it. They didn't let you have a pistol right away. So I had a rifle\nand I was full of joy, full of hope that now I'm doing something worthwhile. Now the\nstory of the fights and the partisans 1s a big story to tell which it would take. I wish you\nwould tell me how much further you want me to detail on it, or to go a little bit more. So,\nyou tell me.",
        "Q: Okay. Let's change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "Q: Had you ever had any experience using weapons, or using a gun before?",
        "A: Until I reached the forest, I never experienced using a weapon in my life. And after the\nambush, when I got that rifle, I asked later to be instructed of the usage of the rifle, and\nwhich I was shown how to clean it and how to use it. And I still remember vividly the\nfirst ttme when I fired the first shot, which it was 1n the air. But, holding the rifle the way\nI was instructed to hold, it gave me a bounce that I fell on the ground. And the instructor\nat that time told me, \"That's all right. Don't get scared about it.\" But, you will learn that\nyou, I held it too strong to my body instead of a little bit aiming it and having the touch\nand feel. So, that was really my first experience that day, in my life, where I went away\nto use a Weapon.",
        "Q: Was there any personal conflict with the concept of using a gun and killing someone?",
        "A: In what way do you mean?",
        "Q: Well, I'm sure you weren't brought up to shoot?",
        "A: Okay. The concept at home before the war was that killing was not a Jewish way. The\nJewish people did not hold guns, you know what I mean, like this here, like, in other\nwords like joining, like a lot of people join the rifle club or anything like that. In the\nHasidic way of life, you could never encounter that. I believed the news breaking about a\nHasidic person holding a gun, that change came in Israel and it only came after World\nWar II. It only came after the Holocaust when finally, the people who cherished a\nreligion became understanding that you must learn the art of weaponry. Because\nbasically, historic the Jews were warriors. They had warriors or they could never have\nSamson, they can never have King David and they can never could have all the era of\nhistory. But, the Diaspora (ph) was a different element what Jews lived in and weaponry\nwas not the form for them to be. They were afraid, they were guests in a country and they\nfelt like it, that therefore they should not antagonize by it because the only kind known to\nme when Jews were practicing weaponry was in Europe, in Poland before the war, who\nbelonged to Batar (ph). But my family had no dealings with Batar. My upbringing, I am a\nBatar person these days but I only switched, I only changed after the war. But in those\nyears, I was not. So therefore on the Jewish scene, with the exception, not 100 percent,\nwith the exception, weaponry or rifle clubs was not a Jewish life. And it was not part of\nthe Jewish way of life.",
        "Q: So, it was very clear to you at this time that this was the way you were going to proceed?",
        "A: Right. And this is why the change in my life came later, just because of that perhaps, I\nsay that. And that's where the change came.",
        "Q: After this ambush, what happened. Why don't you continue?",
        "A: Well, after the ambush, now, we were in that camp, trying to join the rest and just to\nbring to understanding an average day of life in the underground, what did it start? The\nunderground was living in at that era of time, in bushy parts of the forest. They used to\nsee separately a company; in other words, you couldn't come into an area and you found a\nthousand partisans. Perhaps to find a thousand partisans, which they were in the local,\nwas probably in ten different spaces. So we used to be living like in companies. A\ncompany could consist of a maximum of 100, maybe not so close. And then it had so\nmany platoons. At times used to have two platoons, at times we used to have three\nplatoons, depending on the way it was. And, I must mention here the commander's name;\nwhatever his private name was, was the name of the company; like for instance, Zitsof\n(ph), which I joined with, the name of that company was Zitsof. There was also Blatoz\n(ph), there was Fadyakomorov (ph), there were Lanskytrak (ph); there were a variety of\nmore. And all of that goes, didn't change until about 1943 when we used to be when we\nstarted getting para troopers who used to be dropped at a bigger force of Naliboky (ph)\nand then they used to make day away to our forests. When the partisans were organized\nunder the direct command of Moscow.",
        "Q: What was your forest's name?",
        "A: Leipachani (ph) forest is where I am dwelling at this time in the area that we were. And I\ngeographical area would be between one river named Chara (ph) and another river named\nYemen (ph) and Yemen was the big river. And literally located, it was between the\nvicinity of Slomun (ph), between the vicinity of Novogrudate (ph), and Lida (ph) and that\nwas the perimeter in which we were located, which on the map it would be found. Now,\nthis is the way we started; as time went on, it diversified, 1t became bigger. When the\nGermans would attack us, at times when we became too powerful, we again would have\nto breakup in smaller groups, operating in various areas. The brigade used to assign areas\nof where which way we were. Now, the other part, how did they achieve all of that? They\nused to have like a parole or consult. Every time, every night, or rather, every day for 24\nhours, he used to be a parole name, maybe tonight, today, the next, Moscow. So, the\npartisans would meet with partisans. The base at Moscow, we knew that they were also\npartisans because we operated at night and you couldn't, a lot of times see.",
        "Q: Who gave you that?",
        "A: Well, the staff which it was the general staff and the local area staff used to decide on all\nof these here things. At first, when we were groups by itself, like Zitzof (ph) groups and\nthe other, I remember we used to do it by whistles. And I would, we used to do three\nwhistles as a response, two whistles as a question, you know. So it went on from time to\ntime more modern it came when we were more organized, when the content was. When\neach company used to have a radio man, the whole tune and everything else changed. But\nthat didn't take place until about mid 1943 when we were equipped with our radio man\nand immediately we could have the direct contact with the staff, let's say, from the\nbrigade or the brigade could get immediately in touch with Moscow. For instance, at one\ntime through 1943, when the front lines began turning the other way, that the Germans\nwere starting on the retreat. Stalin gave an order and he talk about the partisans, but the\ngreatest help to the war was through the partisans because we kept the Germans busy.\nThe more Germans we kept detained in garrisons towards the forest, the more we kept for\nthem towards the cities because they couldn't depend on the local themselves. The last\nman power, they were able to send to the front lines. The more mines we used to explode\nto stop, even if it meant stopping the trains, going in a certain direction to the front lines\nfor one day, one day's supplies means a big deal to the front lines. So it came up on order\nat one time which it was coded \"rail\". That was the code name, \"rail\". On this night there\nwas a direct order from Stalin that under all circumstances, wherever this is a partisan\nbetween the Soviet Union to the farthest line of the front or behind. On this night, every\npartisan must contribute to destroy as part of the rail. In many areas we were sending in\nsmall groups to make the damage bigger and in other areas, 1t was an order that we had to\nfight our way because the Germans began already to watch the railroads. Which again,\nand in the meanwhile, we gave them additional people to use for watching the railroads.\nSo they started instilling a system which it was like electrical wire but it was not the wire\nelectrically, it was like through bells. Then we would come to the railroad, we would\nstumble on something and that would sound off a sound. So at times we would not even\nknow. At another times, they would go ahead and put mines alongside for the infantry\nmines so once we would come to the railroad, therefore we could be killed or that would\nsend off a signal and save a mine from coming. They had to include the locomotives to\ndetect. So we involved in one way or the other much grief and problems for the Germans\nthrough that. So Stalin gave therefore that order that the rails on this night and on that\nnight, that's why it was. We, through power of attack, which were otherwise, everyone of\nus was given a piece, it looked like a white piece, they used to call it in Russian, \"towel\n(ph)\" , that's the plastic explosives as we call them of today. It was an oblong piece like a\npiece; it had one piece like to put in the capsule and these capsules were various. They\nwere capsules where you could go ahead to detonate them, it would draw a line from a\ndistance so much away and as you pulled it, it triggered it off and you would explode it.\nOther times we used more; we used to make this together in bigger amounts and put them\nout underneath there and wait. We used to do it in places where it curves, on a big curve.\nAnd on a big curve, everybody knows the train slows down. So before it goes into the\ncurve, once past the locomotive, we always wanted to hit the locomotive when we used\nto make an explosion because if the locomotive explodes, no matter how much damage\nyou didn't do to the rest, but this here causes so many trains passing that to de-rail. So it\nwas all strategy involved. They used to sometimes put in a wire into the ring and that\nwire we used to put right near the rail so as the locomotive would travel, it would trigger\neither by weight or it would trigger to touch, this here part of the wire, and the explosion\nwould occur. We used to retreat to quite a distance, so, but the distance far enough that\nwe would hear it, sometimes. On other occasions, it happened, your mine did not explode\nbecause it was a faulty capsule. We did not have the equipment all the time. So before we\nhad this fancy explosives, because when we were in touch with Moscow, they dropped\nby air all of this kind of things in the forest and it used to be distributed to the other\npartisan organizations. Before that, what we used to do, so many, as I aforementioned,\nthe soldiers who knew ammunition and every company has at least a few guys who knew\nammunition. They used to take, for instance, the shells from the artillery shells. The\nartillery shells basically melt them out into a box or square or whatever it is and we\nwould now how much explosives, put in just one of these here capsules to this place, wire\nit, and you take this here and that served as an explosive. At times, while the capsule was\nthere, in the artillery shell, we would mend it to be able to form, to make a capsule. There\nwere specialists. I, only have seen it, worked with it, I couldn't tell you, I can only tell\nyou of one incident that one time that we were on the rail and we were on a very special\nmission, as Poles, sort of, going and on the way when we reached our mission and we\nturned back to go way, as partisans, and we had to demolish a few bridges and lines. And\nat one place near the railroad, I was wearing a long coat and all of us had enough to drink\nbefore. And I remember seeing that wire almost, if that wire had been a little bit more\ntouching it, we all would have gone to hell. But again, drinking was a part of the\ninsecurity that one lived. So, in the partisans, it used to be a slogan, vethum (ph) \"let's\nhave a drink\". Swabota (ph). Now there is glory, today there is victory, so we got to take\na drink. Then we had another way that we were sad because we had, we suffered losses,\nwe were ambushed or whatever it is. So, of course you have to, so one way or the other.\nMoonshine, we did not have regular vodka, moonshine was part of the diet that I would\nsay 99 percent of the partisans used to be involved. And you couldn't help it, you lived at\na time that the next minute, you could be dead. You were not responsible for yourself, so\nthat was part of the irresponsible that it was going on. However, I think the Russian\nArmy still is involved in a lot of drinking. I don't say that the American Army isn't, but\nI'm sure it's more visible as the way the Russians were.",
        "Q: You're talking about drinking and getting drunk, or drinking?",
        "A: That's the true answer, both ways. One time, you drink for everything, celebrating, and\nyou drink so much that you got drunk. On the other hand, you came into a place that you\nbecame drunk by not being able to handle that, you know what I'm saying? .",
        "Q: Did the drinking help seal the comraderie between the Jewish and the Soviet soldiers?",
        "A: Well, the comraderie or vice versa was no contribution to the drinking. It was basically,\nwe must understand that these people had lived in a poisonous area before they came to\nthe forest. The poison that Germany or the anyway Nazis did through all kinds of\npropaganda, somehow or the other penetrated to them. And a lot of time, it was a cause\nwhy so many joined to become anti-Semites was not directly but it was just, became a\npart at first like in a joking way. For instance, I remember when we got the paratroopers\nto us and at one time jokes started to penetrate and go around about Jews. And the first\ntime I ever heard the expression with the long \"r\" instead of abram (ph), you know, the\ndifferent way. Because a lot of Jewish people pronounced it that way. And like one of the\njokes, for instance, we were telling was, if fight, let us fight, but send me on the last\nwagon. This is only to tell you that they existed and though existed in a more way than\nthat. And the biggest problem was, when we knew that this were, that the paratroopers\ncame and trained in Moscow. This is why it would irritate one to realize that the poison\nwas not planted down here, but the poison was already planted in Moscow or other there.\nWe did not know at the time of the atrocities that Stalin did and the killing of Jewish\npeople, that it went on at that time. We didn't, this type of communications we didn't. But\nwe did know that many in the rank, of high rank, Captain Lavida (ph), for instance, in our\narea, in our forest, and he had, he's, the man was sent down for one thing, political. He\nstarted printing a paper and that paper was distributed in the local area and so was it\ndistributed to the partisans at the same time. As I mentioned, the politicalization of the\nRussians began to come back to us in the year of 1943. And we had to listen to a little bit\nmore coaching and teaching. While we were at war, and we were not there, but we still,\nthey had to bring us in. So all these changes, changing of the name, changing in\ncommand, different things, while some of them were positive, there was a lot of negative.\nAnd at that particular time, one could not go ahead sort of, in a way, feel out as we were\nso mistreated by the outside world and so many anti-Semites were around, that it was sort\nof small wonder, that somebody else is joining the same. As it looked like, the whole\nworld was against us. And that's the feeling that we all had. So, it used to be at times,\nwhen we were done, meaning the partisans in general, the Jews would not be all to\nthemselves because basically, when they came to the forest, a lot of the Jews came in a\ngroup. For instance, in our area, we had Dr. Atlas. In our area we also had the Alonzos\n(ph) which comes from my wife's area, you know, from Jetel (ph) or Jachoviz (ph),\nwhichever way you want to call it. There were groups, 100 percent Jews that they\nescaped the ghetto and the massacre and they came then. So the commander, for instance,\nlike Dr. Atlas was there. And he was the one who was practicing doctor, but the man\nwent to battle. And he gave his life in battle. But his group was called the Dr. Atlas\ngroup. Later after he passes on, this group changes its name and we get an escapee from\nthe POWs by the name of Sherbin (ph). Sherbin was a very beautiful commander, at that\ntime when he took it over. But, after he took it over, they did not let it be anymore the\nwhole 100 percent Jewish, they incorporated other partisans. So the change went on like\nintegration. Yes and no. When the times were good, they didn't want to separate Jewish\ngroups. When the times were bad, so even the Abramofs (ph). You know, it was at one\ntime the commander at that time was Abramof. In Abramof's group, there were 80\npercent Jews and 20 percent non-Jews, and the mistreatment was clearly. In other words,\nwhat kind of a word was sent home? And, you know, when, in these kind of cases, he\nwas not Jewish, Abramof, you know; or even if he was, he was not telling about it. And\nanti-Semitism was a clear venture to see in the everyday affair. And I want, for instance,\nright now to dwell one day life as a partisan. We used to have a wake up time, but now\nwith the Army, somebody was blowing the coronet or whatever it is, but 1t used to be a\nwake up time that we had to get up. And then we used to have to get up and there was a\nbriefing time. That took place already where we were under the direction. The company\nwas called to order. The commander was coming out and tell the details for the day,\nwhatever we had, each company has to do. Maybe this one is going for an ambush, the\nother one is going for provisions, the other one is going someplace else. So, you were\ncalled to order and after that, you had breakfast. Our breakfast was, in that part of the\nworld, you don't have a breakfast like in the USA. The breakfast could have consisted of\ngood meats or something, maybe pasta mixed into it. It was a soup and meat\ncombination, one way or the other. And it was on a, built like a bonfire and in the middle\nof it a bucket. And, so, if you had at times a Ukrainian being the chef or sort of, the cook,\nwe ate a lot of Ukrainian-style meals. And if we had that it wasn't a Ukrainian, so we had\nanother style. But the same thing that I'm bringing out, after you had your bite, then you\nhad, there was an order everyday, cleaning the weapons. And it was not easy to keep the\nweapons clean as you would, you know, as if you would be outside of the forest. You had\nto go ahead at times, your platoon commander would have to go ahead and check\nwhether the weapons were cleaned. Then, you used to sometimes go ahead, you had\nrecruits or whatever it is that just came in. We did not know how to handle mines. I\nremember taking my platoon at one time to a lake. When you detonate a hand grenade\ninto a lake, there is no sound. So we used to go ahead and teach them how you pull out\nthe button and you hold on with your hands and throw it, because we used to have a\nGerman hand grenades; used to be with a handle, the Russians were without a handling.\nThey were like an egg with little schrapnels in it. And we would go ahead. And then we\nhad fish afterwards, because from the explosion of that, the fish come up, surface at the\ntop, you know what I'm saying? So, we couldn't go ahead, for instance, to train a machine\ngunner how to shoot, you know what I mean? Only by explaining it. Because it would\nhave been, first of all, a waste of bullets which you could not afford to waste and second,\nit would be a give-away of the location. So, there were a lot of things under\nconsideration. But, yes, the guards; every camp that we set up used to have certain guard\nposts. And the platoon commander used to have to assign from his platoon who goes\nwhere. Then there was choice for the platoon commanders. Everyday was the man of the\nday; in other words, he was the commander of the day. So, he could have been only a\nplatoon commander but today you were in command. So, actually, if we had to go\nfighting, you were instructing until the commander, the regular commander, would take\nover and you would go into battle. So, the assignments were a regular routine, almost like\nArmy life and we had to participate. So, cleaning of the weapons; now, the attitude. A lot\nof weapons, as we are talking now from between '42 and '43, the retreating armies left a\nlot weapons behind. Some of the farmers took and hide some of the weapons. We had\ntrained enough Russian soldiers who were able to rebuilt weapons. So, from three rifles,\nmaybe we only rebuilt one because you couldn't, you needed a certain part here and\nanother part there and they would skillfully do it together. We would clean the bullets.\nWe did not have any other means but sand, but we'd sand. They would have to clean and\npolish so we would have bullets. A lot of it was retrieved from the rivers because while\nretreating, they put a lot in the rivers instead of leaving it for the Germans. We pulled out\nof Pancer (ph), Pancer truck, from the river Shar, and my commander at that time,\nPechulud (ph) which it was his name. And he and other crew refurbished and rebuilt it\nfrom another one; from two of this year or maybe more of them, wound up to make the\nmotor work and everything else. And we used it at one time, on two occasions into battle,\nwhen we had to attack. So, the same thing achieved to build up a Howitzer (ph), 122\nmillimeter, you know, where the sacks of the gun powder comes separately from the\nshell. And again, we had to retrieve these here things from what we found. The Germans\nhad the farmers or the local area retrieve all the weapons. At that time, they used to\npurposely clean it and at times, while their trucks would keep up these weapons, we\nwould ambush and maybe take it from them. It was a life of dog eat dog everyday, about\nobtaining. In those years I'm talking with polishing the weapons and re-building, did not\nhave command posts. We did not have no orders from Moscow and to get ammunition\nwas the only way to get it from the Germans. So we used to attack a garrison, for\ninstance, we were able to, we attacked it basically to obtain weapons. We knew they were\ngoing to come back, but we got so many rifles, so many machine guns, so much of the\nbullets, and everything like that. So, that's what the attack on the garrison served for.\nNow, another daily routine which it was, where we used to be sent out in various places,\nto cut telephone. Military phones, you know, in those years, you couldn't have the\nwalkie-talkies as we know today. So, a telephone had to have telephone wire. And the\nconnection between one outpost to the other with wires. And we literally would have to\nhave groups of guys because to cut telephones, there would be enough to send a group of\ntwo, three guys; one at that stay watch and two to do the work, cutting 1t down. We used\nto sometimes utilize civilians. We would come into a place, take some civilians, make\nthem be the laborers. So the three guys, they went away and got three more farmers so\neach one of us could do certain jobs that much faster. Some of the farmers did it out of\ncooperation with us; some of the farmers did it under the gun; we made them do it. But,\nthis was a regular routine of cutting telephones, at times burning bridges. The bridges\nleading to the forested area, we always wanted it not to be around, because we did not\nwant to have it easy on the Germans to come in with their Penser (ph) trucks or to come\nin with their light tanks, or whatever it 1s to go to the forest. So at times they would go\nahead and lay a pentun (ph) or something and come. But all of this here were efforts that\ngave us more time either to organize, either to retreat. If we knew that a big Army was\ncoming, it was no use to set up battle against them. But, to send up explosive areas, to do\ndamage, to make them believe that who knows 1s behind or to have a big armies to go,\nthat's what we achieved to do. And if I was to say to you and tell you, battle by battle, I\nhave that recorded. But, 1t would take me too much to name you the way it was\norganized. I can tell you one battle in particular points which it was, which is of trying to\ntell you because we had girls and boys as well in our fighting. And I'm talking about, not\nthat I'm trying to change the subject; I'm talking about Jewish girls and boys who were\nnot skilled in being shooters or killers, but they had to turn to the savagery of the times\nbecause that was the only way for us to survive. One, for instance, that I left behind after\nI escaped, Rusha Batskin (ph) was her name, and we were, she was in part of what I said\nto begin with, Dr. Atlas group, and later under Shuben (ph). She was Shuben's girlfriend,\nfor instance; even love went on in the forest and babies were born in the forest, or they\nwere killed, and abortions were going on in the forest. We had a clinic, sort of for a\nhospital, in hiding. It was very well sealed. The Germans in our area never got to the\nhospital; now, that's how it was sealed through little walk-ways to go in, in a place were\nthey couldn't come, they couldn't come over it with heavy trucks or anything like this\nhere. So, we were organized at that time knowing that the Germans are trying to come to\nthe area to collect wheat. All the farmers -- do we have enough time to go on? .",
        "Q: We have another minute or so left?",
        "A: Okay. The Germans used to give to the farmers like tax, that they need from them so\nmuch wheat, so much butter, so much chickens, so much livestock and so on. Each time,\nthe news would be spread around to the farmers, we would get hold of the news and set\nup ambushes. So, to give you an example, if we were to set up an ambush on them, and\nwe wouldn't touch them while going to collect it, but after they made their collection, the\nfarmers were to distribute it in this and that place and this place. Then they would re-load\nit and start taking it to the cities. So beforehand, the farmers used to bring it to the cities.\nWhen the partisans became organized, no longer would we permit them to take it to the\ncities. So, either we would get it from the farmer and give him a receipt, or we would\nmake an ambush and when the halting is organized, kill all the Germans or the police,\nand then turn around, with all of these horses and buggies and wagons with whatever it\nis; livestock, if not livestock, it was wheat or oats, turn them around, bring them in the\nforested areas to the poor farmers because the forested areas, farmers were not well-to-do\nfarmers. But they allowed us to be there and give it to them. It was taken from the rich to\ngive it to the poor, as it said. But in our case it was taking it from the Germans and giving\nit to them.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "Q: Also?",
        "A: Well, this is why I made my business to go ahead and write that manuscript some 35\nyears ago. Believe me, it was the wrong time that I did it, because when I did it with my\nEnglish of today, it would have been published probably ten times over and would have a\nmovie done because all these fights and going on, you know, you've seen probably\npartisan movies, maybe like it went on in Yugoslavia with Marshall Tito. He was the\nchief. .",
        "Q: Okay. Hold on.",
        "A: Due to the fact that the Germans were supposed to collect that contribution from the\nfarmers of wheat, when it came to our command's knowledge, we set up an ambush. We\nwere trying to ambush the Germans at that particular time before. While other ambushes\nwere done after they would have already the collection made, this time we wanted to set\nthem up that they should come and we wanted to really show them that we are a power in\nthis forest. On that road leading to the forest, between the city of the Rachen and another\nlittle town in the forest called Rudayaverska (ph), since it was, that area was Lipichani\n(ph) forest, were three, before you came to that river Shara (ph), there were three little\nbridges on our perimeter. The little bridges were served from the farmers as drains from\nthe fields of the water to go into the canals. So they were of use to the farmers and that's\nwhy they were built, was drainage of the canal. We decided that we were going to use\nexplosives on it and burn them up. So, the first bridge we decided which it was closer to\nthe Rachen, that that bridge we will explode the first. So, since our forest by way of\nespionage, found out and they had onlookers from the distance seeing what is coming 1n,\nso they were no Penser (ph) tanks, there were no Pensers or tanks or anything like that. It\nwas just that they were on horses and wagons and a truck, which it was carrying the\npolice and the Germans. So, we decided at that particular time to let a certain amount,\nsince the police used to always be in the front; the Germans used to not be in the front,\nbut the back. So, the police we let through first to come in there and then we decided to\nblow the bridge. When the explosion of the bridge was, was one truck got caught in the\ndelay and it blew up because of the gasoline and so on. Immediately they descended into\nboth sides of the road, starting to shoot on each side and we saw their positions. So once\nthey started to shoot clear and they got up, we immediately started to shoot against them.\nSo, then they were in total confusion, because on this side of the road was shooting to\nthem and on this side. But the way we were placed in such a position that we should not,\nour fire shouldn't be shot against each other on the other side of the road. But in this\nparticular time, the way the Germans laid themselves out, it was almost sort of the way it\nwas meant to be, that our fire would go against them and not against our own across. So\nwhen we started shooting, when we started firing, all of a sudden, hands went up to the\ntop. Those big heroes, the Germans, as well as the police, no longer were tough guys and\nthey started to plead and beg. Ammunition on the side was collected and we started lining\nup. Among the Germans over there, there were the Desunden Freur (ph). On our side of\nthe perimeter, I was at that time a machine gunner and I had a Russian type of machine\ngun with a round disc on the top and I was placed from place to place were to attack and\nwhere to shoot. And before long I found out that we had a casualty of someone that I\nknew close, which was a girl, tall girl and a brave girl. She always used to go to battle\nwhenever her brothers. She was with three brothers together and one of them used to be a\nmachine gunner, used to, Anamoxinkas (ph), we used to call him. Anamoxinkas is a\nwater-cooled machine gun. And her other brother, which it was the oldest one, became at\nthat particular time the commander of the platoon, of the former Dr. Atlas's group. And\nshe was the casualty of the day. She was shot from this, when I said the Germans started\nto shoot on this side, so she was a casualty and we just found it out. As I go on the other\nside to clear, to look for Germans or police who were either wounded or whatever it 1s, I\ncome and near me I see another girl from the Rachen, which she was also with us all the\ntime, Rasha Baskin (ph) is her name. I don't know her whereabouts today, because when\nI escaped the Soviet Union, she was, she remained behind and I have no contact with her.\nBut, she spotted, she says, \"Look, Harold. Look, Harold. Here's the Zundenfuer (ph).\" .\nThe Zundenfuer means that he was the head of the region from the Gestapo, and he was\nthere. And as we approached him, I approached him now with the machine gun, she had\nat that time a rifle only in her hand, and he says to her, \"Don't.\" And he starts pleading we\nshouldn't kill him, whereupon he pulls out a pocket from his pocket, photographs of the\nRachen girls. Whatever this man, either he was in love with them or had love affairs with\nthem or what, we at that time did not know. And neither did I want to listen, so I wanted\nto shoot. She starts pleading with me, \"Harold he is mine. You're not going to kill him. I\nam.\" And she basically, with the rifle went and smashed his head to pieces, because after\nseeing the pictures of these girls, we know any SS guy or Gestapo who has pictures from\ngirls which they used to do at practice, have sex with them, then taking pictures with\nthem yet, understand. All of them, you know what I mean, to put into sort of their\ncollections. Now, at one time, I must say, that I had to give a good reason and a good\nthanks to Rasha Baskin for killing a person. And it was beyond my personal belief, in a\nway, but in battle you see the enemy and you don't see anything else. And that's what it\nwas. And we moved on. Of course, she says she's going to take his gun. I let her take his\ngun because trophies; there was plenty of ammunition for everyone to pick up. By that\ntime, I had a German luger at that time that I took and I wanted to carry it, but at that\ntime I turned it in to the command because what would I do for getting bullets for a\nGerman luger? It was easy for us to get bullets from Russian-type guns than to get for\nGermans. We used to get enough ammunition of theirs, but that was hard. Now, after the\nfirst battle line was over, our command ordered us to go back to position, only changing\nposition because we expected that this will not be the last battle. So all of these killed,\nincluding the Zundenfeur (ph), the officer, our command ordered to go ahead, to strip\ntheir uniforms off of them and just naked and covering with a blanket, put them back on a\nhorse and wagon and we took one of the farmers, send them to the city to turn in their\ncorpses and give them a note, \"Don't fight us, because that's the way you're going to see\nthe rest of you come back.\" It's true enough that we were there and the following day the\ncommander decided that we should be on guard again because they probably will send in\na second force. And they did. On the second force what they sent, that's why I could\nunderstand why they went to burn up the last bridge to us, but the first bridge to them.\nAnd the other two, we mined at this time, one at a time. They came with a light tank at\nthis time and they came, again, Germans and they had the police which they were a\nmakeup of Ukrainians and the other Russians and they started to do the same thing and\nwe again let them cross that second bridge before the explosion was made. The explosion\ngot at this time, caught that small task that they had. And it was done, you know, they\ncouldn't have maneuvered; they would have to have heavy equipment to pull it out,\nwhich they came days afterwards to try to pull it out because of fear that the partisans\nmay go ahead right now and re-build it. You know what I mean? They got espionage the\nsame way as we did, to know what we were up to. And again that was battle line number\ntwo. We were still waiting and a couple of days later they sent a bigger force again and\nagain at this time, we ensued battle and realizing the roar of the trucks that 1t came a big\nforce. Our command decided to retreat and we retreated to the forest. Then they came in\nwith a bigger force to the farmers at that time for the contingent what they had to get\nfrom them of the wheat, but at this time we could not control it. But the mere fact was\nthat in order for them to collect the taxed wheat or provisions from the farmers, no longer\ncould be gotten from these areas without a fight. So we achieved our purpose that we\nmade this fight. Before long a change in all of that had happened. The Germans decided\nto build, as they called, a self-defense team. And in each settlement, they were ordered to\njoin on doing that. They used to hang up a piece of rail or a bell and as soon as partisans\nwould show in that vicinity, the bell or the rail piece would start making noise on the\nring. It would carry from one settlement to the other, until it would come to the garrison.\nThen the police would have to come out, put some on ambush or come searching to catch\nthe partisans.",
        "Q: Who did this? The local people did it for the Germans?",
        "A: Yeah. They did it for the Germans to alert them that partisans are out. And in the\nmeanwhile, they would send a force against us. On three occasions, luck was with me,\nthat I was struck on this type of ambushes. And either my number wasn't up or my\nalertness was good, that I was able to get off the wagon, because we used to use wagons\nto come there. And I shoved myself up, turned over on my belly, into the forest and three\ndays later I showed up in camp, on each of these occasions. I don't mean on that\nparticular day; on each of these occasions, when I came, I was looked upon like I\nreturned from death because they already had given up on me, because a number of us\nused to be killed. And the command decided that no longer could that be tolerated.\nOtherwise, we would have to leave the area. And leaving the area was not saying we'll\nmove on elsewhere. The elsewhere, if 1t works, it will work elsewhere the same way. Our\ncommand decided on teaching a lesson and we had to do it the German way. We took a\nfarm area, the settlement was called Lansovicha (ph) and we surrounded it one morning\nwith our troops. There were a few hundred people in participation. And the first thing, we\nwaited for somebody to come and hitting the bell. Somebody did come and as soon as he\nhit the bell, machine gun was fired and that man was dead and more people who started\nto run out of their houses, were dead. They realized the casualties and all of them began\nall of a sudden to be alert. We started a fire because their roofs were made out of straw\nand we had the special bullets, fire bullets, to start fire, on purposely to make a little\npanic. While a certain group of ours were taking charge of the livestock, everybody tried\nto drive their livestock out because they were afraid it will burn up, you know. So, while\nthey were, the farmers were driving out, our people were taking over, lining them up and\nthey were driven to the forest while our command decided to share this cattle among the\npoor farmers in the forest. That was left to be a lesson that any settlement that will\ncooperate with the Germans and will alert our moves, whatever partisans in the area, can\nexpect the same treatment as Lansovich (ph). And that, after that, they didn't remove it,\nfrom there on, after that time that 1t happened, the farmers in the area understood that\neither, if you listen and do for the Germans, you'll get killed from the partisans. And if\nyou listen the other way, you'll get killed from the Germans. So, therefore, they tried to\nplay a little bit of a different game. And it no longer was the success as the Germans\nanticipated it would. The reason that Peklansavichy (ph) was because from that\nsettlement, there were a number of guys serving in the police force in the Rachen. And\nwe had our contact man who our command could get all information needed, because we\nalso had local people who were working on our side and they were actually against the\nGermans and what they were doing. But, it had to be done in a hiding kind of way. The\nstory, after that what had happened with that battle, changed. And really, here, at one\ntime, we made almost like calling a massacre because quite a number of casualties. The\nfarmers would go out and start pleading, \"Don't burn, don't burn up my farm,\" and this\nand that and the other. And we knew the families that were there; the families of those\npolicemen serving in the Rachen were all killed. So, be that you want to call it savagery\nfor the sake of liberation, but we had to bring it down, that's what the command said in\norder to go on and act. However, we were more cautious. We started to drive-in other\nareas away, even to do our ammunition work, we did not go in the same format. We\nchanged; we had to go further away from base in order to keep on doing. For instance, to\ngive you an example, Zelva (ph) was the main station and we started operating, going bad\nthings around Zelva. We would start crossing the Yemen on the other side, which it was\nthe bigger forest. And certain changes in our operation was. However, all of that within a\nfew months brought a big German Army who wanted to get even now with the partisans,\nrealizing that. And at that particular time, the fighting ensued for almost a week. And we\nwere surrounded for quite a big perimeter all the way around and afterwards our fight\nwas not so much killing Germans as it was to work our way through a retreat, where we\ncould go to a retreat in smaller groups through the bigger forest. Which we did. And in\nweeks later, in slow motion, with fewer people, we came back to the area but in other\nparts of the forest. So, not to leave, we suffered a tremendous amount of casualties at that\nparticular time. And our reorganization was, I mean, the reorganization, speaking in the\npart of the Jewish partisans. On that particular march, I was near Captain Bulat (ph) and\nhe was the staff leader. And he started the anti-Semitism, talking continually to me, and\nno matter how much defending I tried to do of the Jewish, it still was calling the Jewish\nall at once, he started to call them cowards. I said, \"How can you call them cowards?\nLook at Balat. He kept all his guys, the Rachen boys, up in the front line. A few of them\ndied, got killed, and look how they held the Germans for a whole day in position, and the\nGermans could not come forward. Do you call that cowardness?\" I says, \"You and I, I\nwas in front with a machine gun and you were a few hundred yards in back of me when\nyou asked me to go into the settlement over there, to find out, to see if the German's are\nstill there. Did I back off?\" \"No,\" he says. \"You were good; you were a brave guy. I'm not\ntalking about you.\" I said, \"Then, why are you pluralizing it?\" And after the talk all the\ntime, the group of Atlas as we were to call them, as I have mentioned, the Dr. Atlas\ngroup, Lipsovich (ph) was the name of the commanding officer at the time, he come over\nto me, he says, \"Harold, we were retreating. We cannot go on with this here whole group\nbecause look at the anti-Semitism. Two Jewish girls were shot because they dropped their\ndiscs. They were having the discs for the automatic weapons and while running and\nretreating, they dropped the discs, they shot the Jewish girls. There was no way out others\ncould do.\" So, they pleaded with me; they said, \"Harold, please come with us.\" I says,\n\"No. I will not join you for one reason. I do not want to make Captain Balot right. I don't\nwant for him to be able to pluralize it. So, while all of you are going, I wish you luck and\nI hope to meet you when it's all over. The next day after the Altas group left, Captain\nBalot got me again. \"Harold, you remember our conversation? Look what happened to\nyour cowards.\" I says, \"Why do you confront me with them? I had nothing to do with\nthem.\" I says, \"What happened to them?\" He says, \"They all retreated.\" .",
        "Q: Why don't you stop this. . . ?",
        "A: The conversation ensued with all anti-Semitic flavor and he said, \"They will be pushed\nonce we go back to base.\" Within a couple of days later, we decided to return. So instead\nof going towards the forest, now we decided to return back to our bases. On our way\nback, we realized of how many settlements were burned by the Germans through the\nlocal area, and we realized was a big thing it will be right now for us to operate in these\nareas. And they decided to come back firstly, to where the Dr. Atlas group was usually\ntaking place, although they were right nearby and we ran up on them. No sooner we came\nthere, the order was everybody stays in place. I saw a friend of mine, Moses Agonik (ph),\nand he used to be a patrol guy who on the horse would always run forward for patrolling\nand finding out front line news. And I was a smoker at that time, and a heavy smoker. So\nbadly, we used to take leaves and crush the tobacco and roll it in newspaper to smoke. It's\nhard to relate to everybody whoever smokes what a horrendous feeling that gives you to\nsubstitute, but that's what we did. I see Moses over there; I says, \"Moe, can I get a\ncigarette from you?\" I stepped out of line. No sooner that I stepped out of line,\nBuresbulat (ph) is there and Buresbulat starts acting up, now he wants to shoot me. He\nwants to shoot me right on the place. Now, being I'm among my good friends of\ncommanders which I had Zeitsof (ph) who took me to the forest, Beshuti (ph), which it\nwas another one; Misha Dubokof (ph), and third one, and a few more came over. No,\nyou're not going to shoot him; you're not going to kill him. As they were my messiahs, in\na way of speech. And he didn't do it. \"Why did you step out of line?\" I says, \"I didn't step\nout; just one foot, to get a cigarette from him.\" \"I said and I ordered, no one steps out of\nline, and you did.\" Basically, I realized that 1t was no more, no less, but the anti-Semitism\nin here, that he continued talking with me about; that's what it was. But I was on the\nwatch at that time. Before long, they started to order, they wanted to shoot two more of\nthe Rachen girls, who they understand, dropped their discs and we had one guy who was\na Rachen guy, Benjamin Denbrovsky (ph); he used to be like the hang man. Any time\nsomebody had to be executed, Benjamin used to be the one to be called. So, now Bulot\nhas given him the assignment to take these two girls and he should go after them and\nshoot them. Well, an order is an order, so he went and the girls called and instead of him\nshooting them, he told them, \"We are running. I will not kill you. Stay with me.\" They\nall, at that particular time, ran. When they did not hear any shots, they followed. They\nkilled the girls, but Ben, they couldn't get hold of. He survived the war at , which it was a\ntrap for Jews mainly, and that's where he survived. Because for him, disobeying an order\nfor not shooting, he would have been killed. He survived the war about Bensky (ph) and I\nmet with him after the war. So, --.",
        "Q: Was there a lot of this justice system going on in the forest?",
        "A: Well, at that particular time, as I am about to tell you, the system still did not work\nofficially under the Soviet bases, but it was just beginning to be. But since that was the\nbig fight and the big onslaught by the Germans going on over there and the casualties that\nwe suffered and when it was going on. Above all, what it got them worse is, they came\nand they found that what did the Atlas guys do, they were cooking a whole kitchen where\nthey had the chickens. And it was fine; you know what I mean? That was another part\nthat Jews liked chicken. That was another fallacy, you know, what I mean, for anti-\nSemitism. Why did I have chickens? Since I aforementioned that so many places were\nburned out, there were a lot of chickens flying around on the loose, with no one now to\ntake care of. So, they went away, cut the chickens, killed them and cooked them. So, he\ndid not even try. Before long, Heir Libshovens (ph), the commander gave an order to his\nmen. He saw what was going on and he saw the anti-Semitism. They surrendered to our\ngroup. His platoon was bigger at that time than the group we were, with machine guns\nand he went out talking to Bolot (ph). \"Are you going to call to order now and go back to\nstaff and re-hash all the things, or are you going to out right now? Remember one more\nmove and we are going to use our machine guns.\" And that's what attended for the day,\nthe stuff returned. And Dr. Atlas group no longer was commanded by Leibshovitz, but\nShuben became its commander and the group received a few more non-Jews. So, to make\na tone out of it, 1t looked like this: when things were bad, like they used to say in Polish, .\nWhen it's bad, go ahead to start getting on the Jews. We were the blame, the scapegoats\nfor everything, even at a time like this, in the forest. So maybe this is again one reason\nwhy not more Jews came to the forest. It was not because of anything else, because they\nhad no ways of how to make contacts with the forest. The guys in the forest were not\ninterested at that time to save Jews. They were interested just to fight a war against the\nGermans. But we did not have any helping hand to help Jews to survive. We survived\nbecause we were there fighting but not because somebody tried to help us survive. And,\nunfortunately, that's the case; that's the way it was. This was a bad to swallow at that\nparticular time because all of a sudden, the reorganization, I myself was sending from\none, and I asked at that time, Zatsov and Buchlet. They say, \"Harold, I cannot keep you\nunder my wing. You might as well go to join . That's the order that you got.\" So I was re-\nsettled to another place. The Abromov (ph) becomes my new home, sort of to be with\nthem. And that went on until a few months later, when the paratroopers joined us under\nthe auspices of the General Costenko (ph) or we used to call him, Capusten (ph). And I\njoined, I joined him, not because of my, I was assigned to join him. And maybe that was\nanother way of Abromov to get me out of, you know what I mean; not to be over here.\nAnd I and Polachek (ph), the other one who were assigned there, and at that time, I\nbecame platoon commander beforehand, but still and though, even my being the platoon\ncommander, he singled out me and Polachek, the two, to go to be with the paratroopers.\nAnd a new leaf in the history of the partisans had started at that particular time in our\narea.",
        "Q: This is, the date approximately?",
        "A: I beg your pardon. That was already 1943.",
        "Q: Now, why don't we change here because he's just got a minute left.\nEnd of Tape #7\nTape #8",
        "A: Because that was leading up to that attack that we had another attack by the Germans, to\nget even with us. That was, now we are talking of 1943, in the Spring.",
        "Q: Okay. The other thing that, I know you've talked about this in different ways, but it's a\nlittle confusing 1s, there are all these different bands, and I'm wondering how coordinated\nyour activities were. I mean, there are all these different groups out there. I understand\nthere was a battle to destroy a garrison in the town that you had come from, Rachen (ph)?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit about that? Were you involved?",
        "A: Yes, I was very much involved. As coming near Zotzof and Pescholey (ph) at the time,\nand Misha Dubokov knew of me, and I was the one selected to take the commerce from\nthe big massacre in the Rachen to which company, and we were pleading with the\ncommand, I and the same thing, Somek Burnstein (ph) that please, let us go and attack\nthe Rachen, less us go and attack the Rachen. But the command still did not want to\nlisten to us before the massacre happened. However after the massacre in the Rachen\nhappened, and from that massacre to the forest, I would . The people who were in the\nfamily camps to those who were assigned in the various command posts, in companies, I\nwould say that may be 100 to 120 people were saved of a population in the ghetto, for at\nleast seven or eight hundred. That's how victorious the Germans were of killing the Jews.\nThey did not take them anymore to the big dig that they had in the forest, but rather in the\nholes that were left from the bombs in the middle, the center of town, that's where they\nkilled them out. And some of them they even killed in the ghetto and burned afterwards\nthe whole ghetto with them. So those of them who weren't hiding, had little chance to\nsurvive. And that is, perhaps, was why the number of us are living. Now, ...",
        "Q: Can we just ask you for an approximate date, here?",
        "A: Let's see. That would have to probably be, when was it in your time, 1943, the last\nmassacre, or '42?",
        "Q: \u201842.",
        "A: That's what I thought it was, '42. We are talking about now, when we attacked the\nRachen was at the tail end of summer. Or mid-summer of 1942. So, at that particular time\nwith having so many more people, survivors of the Rachen, everybody sort of was\nlooking for a little vengeance on the police, a little vengeance on the Germans for the\nmassacre that they carried out. And command was knowing that we can get a lot of\ntrophies in ammunition and everything like that, because they will not fight, no more than\nthey didn't fight as before in other ambushes. And they mustered up the force in all the\nareas and all the partisans were divide in about four groups to make it so that we gave\nthem only one area from where to escape and all the other areas that they tried to escape,\nthey had to fall into our fire. I was assigned at that time to a group with Zitsof (ph) which\nI was with him together. We both were having, he was having a machine gun and I was\nhaving a machine gun and while he had the machine gun, he was commanding also his\nflock. In other words, of his line, whatever he had to do. We decided to attack about\ndawn, while it was still dark, about maybe at the hours between 5 and 6 in the morning.\nOur forces began to move in the area at night, so really our forces did not have time to\nrest, but in small groups. You could not move about five, six hundred partisans all to\ncome in at one time. So everybody was using a different direction and it took them the\nnight hours to come to be in place.",
        "Q: On foot, mostly?",
        "A: On foot. Some of them were on horses. The ones who were searching areas and contact\nman with him, but all the troops were on foot. No other way. And the contact men only\nwere on horses so that they could be able to speed up to tell from the command, you\nknow, we did not have no radios or anything like that at that time. So, we started\nmustering the forces at night because by night, the movement could be not so visible as to\nalert the garrison that something is going on. We decided there has to be attack early in\nthe morning. The signal was a rocket that I would shoot in the air from my horse. And\nonce the rocket was shoot, fire starts and with the words of \"Hurrah,\" the Russian way,\nour men begin. The machine guns that were meant near the police first, we shot them out\nimmediately because we made the forest, by the time they realized it was an attack, and\nto muster the police who were asleep, and the Germans, we already were near the\nbuildings, surrendered and hand grenades began flopping from everywhere. So the\nGermans and the police did not ensue in a fight for more than about an hour in all, put\ntogether. And all they were doing is looking for places where to run. We collected quite a\nnumber of them prisoners of war and the prisoners were tied, their hands in the back and\nwere immediately sent to the forest, and which, later on, they would stand trial and they\nwere convicted, in other words to die. And they were one by one shot in the presence of\nthe partisans. And, at that particular time, we were very overwhelmed of how little an\neffort it was to knock the garrison out, because really there looks like did not have chance\nenough to build a position. However, I must make a point here; after it was all over and\nthe garrison retreated back, that's when around this here garrison where the police force\nwas staying, they built a wall with bunkers that if we were to have this here kind of\nbuilding before, we would never be able to succeed to attack. We made use of the time,\nsince the Rachen was a slaughter house, that the slaughter house became busy,\nslaughtering meat, and it was salted down into wooden barrels and sent to the forest by a\ncontingency of partisans that we had who were capable of making salami and so on, and\nthey were salted down as to food and scattered around the various parts of the forest,\nwhich only a few people knew. So, in the event we should have been surrounded and not\nbe able to go out, that we should be able to have supplies for where to survive. My good\nfriend, Barnovsky, (ph) was leading on, we told of this year, doing, he was a butcher by\ntrade and he knew the art of making the salami and all of that do. So, he was leading and\nit became a very busy place, that slaughter house. To tell you, we kept it for almost three\nmonths and until the Germans decided to make an onslaught and come back to return to\ntheir bases. With Zidsov (ph) as I went into a house, I came into a Gentile person who\nknew even my grandparents. And he touched me badly, the way he said it in Russian, \" ,\"\nwhich translated into English, means, \"Are you still alive?\" And it rubbed me the wrong\nway. Had I not had Commander Zitsov with me, I would have ended him right there. But\nbeing with my Commander Zitsov with me, I pretended that I didn't take it, instead of\nhim showing the joy that I am alive, he asked me, \"Are you still alive?\" So, and that\nrubbed me in the wrong way and he ordered us, he ordered for him and his wife to make\nbreakfast for us and a few more from the command came into the same house. And even\nthough we had to drink and to eat, but these few words never left me. And I had a hard\ntime, sort of, forgetting about it, that even after I left all of my family and lost them over\nhere, that that man would have the audacity to ask me, one person who remained alive, in\nthese words, with his cruel words: \"Are you still alive?\" And he thought that that was a\nway of greeting me. In other words, that he sort of jokingly thought. I did not make any\nmention in front of my commander, but my anger was burning in me, coming back in the\nplaces where I did not even know which of the holes my family is buried, you know.\nBecause they threw lime afterwards on it and it was brought to burial, the area, after the\nwar when the partisans returned to the Rachen. It was a big piece of news for the whole\narea, because the respect date. And what we invited upon ourselves, after that forest, after\nthat Rachen occupation and what we do. That the Germans had to bring a tremendous\nforce in surrendering all the forest, extending maybe in diameter, maybe 30 to 40 miles.\nWhich, again, for the Soviet Union, it served a good purpose. When they have to take in\none area to use so much military to do a big job like that, the front line is . That's when\nthe Soviets were winning. But, it was a lot of casualties on our part and that Fall, when\nthey made, because we were so sure of ourselves that we became too cocky. We used to\ntravel by day, coming to the Rachen; going here and doing there. We thought there is no\nforest that it can stop us. And this is the time that we relaxed a little bit too much and the\ncasualties happened. So then we heard the forest coming in, we started on the edge of the\nforest from all places to put up, at that time, a defense. And we didn't wait for them to\nattack us, we started to attack them, realizing the kind of forest and the kind of fighting\nthat no longer were we dealing with the police, the local alone, but at this time we were\ndealing with a trained Army. So, our command immediately recognized the situation and\nthey broke through an area in a few places to make it, and we were ordered to retreat. We\nretreated until the forest almost around Vilda (ph). It was very, a traumatic move at that\ntime for us, that all of a sudden, we had to, I would say in miles, I would say we must\nhave retreated about 150 yards from our base. The good part of a base was that we knew\nthe names of the settlements. We knew which way it leads. And then you come in a\nstrange place altogether, it was hard to go ahead to carry out any of the type of work that\nthey did over there. So it was a set back port partisans. The good news however was that\nafter that, we saw the paratroopers come in to the area. So, 1943, about mid, we decided\nto organize a new action.",
        "Q: I want to go back for a moment. You have mentioned on and off a Dr. Atlas. I believe he\nwas also involved in that battle, so I want you to tell me something about him. Who was\nhe? What kind of a man he was? What he was doing?",
        "A: At the battle of the Rachen, Dr. Atlas was involved. And he retreated away from the\nRachen quickly. Not with his troops, because he had some medical missions that he had\nto attend to at that particular time. While he was the commander, he still used to attend to\ncertain patients, which was farmers. His good rule, what he did to the farmers helped us\nwith leads of informers that we could get. And because they wanted Dr. Atlas to continue\nwith the work, we prospered with it. So, yes; he was in the battle. He originally was\nleading his platoon over there to the Rachen, but he after it was over, the fight was over,\nhe had to retreat. His men remained there. Now, for instance, we knew a few casualties of\nthe Rachen boys who did lose their life, like I mentioned before. Benjamin Dumbrovsky,\nhe lost his brother at that particular time. But all the casualties we had were due to\nbravery; they were really fighting and they really wanted to see and show the police over\nthere that somebody has got to be accountable for the way they did in that massacre\nagainst the Jews so well.",
        "Q: Did his platoon come from that area?",
        "A: The platoon that he was leading was, I would say, about 80 percent of the Jewish people\nwho came from the Rachen and they came after the massacre of the Rachen. That's why\nthey were so eager in the fight of to go back and sort of, vengeance was a good driving\nforce in them, to do what they were doing at the present time. So, it was not idealogy in\npart, all the way, that they were trying to fight for the Soviets, but a lot of times it was\nvengeance against those who did so cruel to our families there. So his platoon remained\nuntil afterwards when the General's staff ordered everybody to retreat. Because after the\nfirst day, or the second day, we used to go back by day to the forests and by night come\nand still do that. We did not want to get caught in the big forest that the Germans should\ngo ahead. So we used to have, more or less, platoons, a platoon maybe would stand guard\nand about on the lookout over there. But the whole Army was where we were, about five\nor six hundred partisans, were sent back to their bases. Dr. Atlas was also a DP like I was\nmyself. I knew him not like I knew, for instance, the other doctors; no.",
        "Q: But you came in contact with him?",
        "A: Yes. It's worth mentioning here, about Dr. Atlas's past. He was a displaced person, like I.\nHe was someplace from Poland. And that man practiced medicine all the time and with\nthe German onslaught, the way it happened, he decided to be treating patience on the\noutside. So he, instead of remaining in the ghetto, was away from the ghetto and he used\nto, sort of, be the doctor of the farmers. And they did not disclose him from the Germans,\nto the Germans, rather. With the onslaught and organization of partisans, as soon as he\nheard about partisans in the area, he came voluntarily and joined but he still maintained a\ngood relationship with the farming area over there and they became very useful to the\npartisans, right now for the information. He was a man about my height, slimmer than\nme, I mean you know, I wasn't as fat as Iam now, but a little slimmer. And he had one\nthing, you could see fire in this man, talking to his guys all the time about vengeance and\nfight. \"When you going to fight, fight to the end. Fight to win.\" And he was a good\nleading commander. We had a lot more of, in Buloks. Bulok was a local commander who\nhad mostly Gentiles, or the other Russians, not so much of the Soviets, true Soviets, who\nremained in the area that didn't go into the prisoners of war. But he organized his group\nmostly from his settlement area and around there. So the people, as I say, his group, they\nall used to ride more, a lot on horses. So, they would come because they had their own\nfarms and so on. So a lot of them used to have to man the farms, and at night, whatever\nthe partisans needs was today, they would be working on that front line, too. But the\nunfortunate situation happens, Dr. Atlas, in one of the big ambushes, which it was\nfollowing after the liberation of the Rachen, that's when Dr. Atlas is killed in battle. So, I\nmean, he didn't die just a normal death. He was killed while fighting, being a fighter and\ncommanding. That's when the takes over. That man, I just mentioned, misfortunately\nmeets his death in , in Poland, while on his way escaping the Soviet Union, and while on\nthe way in a kubutz (ph) which it was illegal immigration to go to Israel. And being\noutside on patrol, a Polak shot and killed him. As you've heard perhaps or not, that in and\nin other parts of Poland, after 1945, when the war as over, and the Jews were running\nfrom the camps or from hiding, they still were not ready to give away what they robbed\nfrom the Jews, so they had one way of doing it: kill them. And therefore, we know later\non, what went on in Poland. So, a lot of these guys like , met their death after liberation.\nAnd it was a big hurt to feel that a guy was patriotic all the way and that that was the way\nfor him to die. So, why almost after three years in the forest, or two and a half years,\nrather, and being in battle and to come out all right. In the forest he only lost his sister.\nHis brothers, the other two brothers that survived, to the best of my knowledge, are in\nIsrael.",
        "Q: Now, we have I guess about ten more minutes and I'm wondering. There are two thoughts\nthat I have. Either, and maybe you can explain to me about this reorganization that took\nplace?",
        "A: Yep.",
        "Q: Or possibly tell me about an experience, or running into family camps, whichever you\nthink is appropriate at this point?",
        "A: Well, I can tell you first about the family camps, rather than getting into this subject,\nbecause that's a more lengthy subject to talk about. I did not mention at great length, that\nin the forests there were also family camps. However, let us make clear about it. When I\nuse that word, family camps, I only mean others an expression. It was not a camp of\npeople with families or elderly, that they were supervised by others. It's just that they\nwere, sort of, not elected to be able to be among the fighting force. And therefore, when\nwe came to the forests, escaping from the massacres, there was only one thing for them to\ndo, and that was to be in the forest. So, a lot of them, a majority of them who were\ncapable, joined one company or the other and they were there. And those who couldn't,\nfor instance, had the lot left to them to be there. Every time the Germans attacked the\nforest, the ambush or otherwise, the big forest or small forest, the family camps were the\nfirst prey that they attacked. And at times, it was, they were going home, sort of, with\nvictory, thinking that they killed partisans while they actually, the one that they killed\nwas the ones in the family camp. Because as soon as the shooting was started, not too far\nwhere we were in our camps, so we would exactly, at that particular time join and attack\nthem instead of. And from the family camps, they had an easy prey. All they could throw\nis a few hand grenades, open up a machine gun and boom, then they found them. So,\nthose who were living in hiding survived the massacre, or the onslaught. Those who were\nnot living in hide outs, but they just lived in the open, you know. They were first prey.\nSo, the other part was, while we had so many fighting groups, really, no one cared to\nprovide the family camps with provisions, even food or clothing. However, some of them\nhad relatives, brothers or other ones, in the fighting camps, which they would care to\nbring something. But, 1t was never an organized effort by the partisans, in the area that I\nwas in. I don't know what it was in other forests; maybe in other forests it was different.\nBut, I believe that we would have heard about it and know about it. They were an open\nprey. They escaped. At types, they used to have problems with the partisans. The\npartisans, especially the women, and there were younger girls; the partisans, in most\ncases the Gentiles, would come and rape them, attack them in this way. So they were\nopen prey to all kinds of enemies: our local enemies, the partisans which they couldn't\nprotect themselves from, and against the Germans and the police when they would attack\nand they would normally, you know what I mean, pick their spots as of their probably\nspies them where they were located and that's what it would be.",
        "Q: Did, do you think that Jewish members of the partisans ever took advantage of the family\ncamps in that way?",
        "A: The Jewish guys used to help one way or the other, the family camp. But, that was, again,\na not official way, it was an unofficial way. That we would sometimes drop some food\nover there. But we were starting to stop over there to visit and usually we would come\nwith some food leaving them. But it was not a case that a command told us, \"Hey, why\ndidn't you deliver some potatoes from wherever you can, or something else, to the family\ncamp?\" The family camps were strictly left on their own and if we were to have the\nfigures at hand and starting to make justification or comparisons, we would find that the\nbiggest amount of casualties as per amount coming to the forest, was from the family\ncamps.",
        "Q: Was there constant enemy presence? I mean, were you always afraid of bombing and\nadvances?",
        "A: That was the life, at that time. It was war and we were in that war. It did not matter\nperimeter, where the front line is. To us, the front line was everywhere, because we\nnever, we used to catch here and there spies, would come running in the forest that the\nGermans sent. They used to send in ex-POWs, you know what I mean, which they sent\nin. We found them with maps and insignia on them. And of course, when we found them,\nthey met death, you know what I mean? But, it was officially, you know. The company\nwould come out and it would be read the order, who and what it was discovered and\ntherefore, they were executed. But, 1t was in a military kind of a way. So, to tell you, the\nforests were full of all kind of problems, while they served of a lot of help, to help Jews\nsurvive. But, it did not happen as a means for Jewish survival. It happened because the\nway it happened to be that it served as the base for survival. But they were not with open\narms, let us get Jews in. Jews were not taken in so easily, like I told you when I was,\nbefore when I was coming in there. What do you think? We have ammunition for them?\nThat was not the case. The case is, if you're out to help or to save, that's the salvation. But\nif not, that's the case we don't have, how are we going to take in more? And again, when\nwe were talking about attacking the Rachen, before the massacre, that was our main\ncourse; that was to come in to tell them that a young people will join us. But they did not\nwant to hear but we will take the Rachen after the massacre, where we could have saved\nso much more lives.",
        "Q: During this period of time, did you have one moment or one episode that was the most\nterrifying to you, or was this just the life?",
        "A: If there was one episode, I don't know which way to place it. I was on a mission at one\ntime to save one Jewish girl from the Rachen, who a policeman at the massacre, he looks\nlike he was in love with her and she was in love with him, save her and took upon\nhimself to take him to his farm, where his parents were, and they kept her there. And all\nof a sudden, we got word in the forest that Sonia no longer can stay. She became the wife\nlater of who I have mentioned before, who was a commander. But sent me for one reason\nor another only that I came telling her, there's a young girl, good looking, and if you want\nme to bring her here, you'll have a girl. So, it was sort of like you cannot say that the\ninterest of the commander to permit me to go on that mission to save her was of humane?\nNo, it wasn't of humane. It was, the was a nice man and he layer winds up being with her\nafter the war was over. But he, it was just a matter of exchange, sort of; you know what I\nmean\u2019? Who cares? And I risked my life, although I wasn't a native from that city. But I\nwas there, again, because the Dr. Atlas group probably had the same thing and the\nquestion would always be, how come they didn't? I did it for one basic reason. The news\ncame to us through a contact and I went to and told him. And he says, \"Would you want\nto go to bring her?\" I says, \"Yes. She's a nice woman.\" And I brought her. But it was a\nbig risk for me, a one-man operation, to go to organize it, through our contact man.\nWhich I did through the prior knowledge of the staff. The staff would never have\npermitted me to do a thing like that. You know. The staff would have said to me, \"Sure,\nshe wants to come? Meet her halfway. Meet her at the edge of some settlement from the\nforest and if she comes there, you'll take her. But I risked and I had to make them believe\nthat I'm here with a little Army to surrender. And she was dressed like a little farm girl\nand she came out over there and when we meet, I sort of started to pretend that there 1s\nthe other guys, all came with me. And until I was in the forest, she herself thought that\nwhat I'm talking is really something. And the whole night it took me to walk until in the\nmorning until I brought her. So, is that an important case? Was the onslaught in the\nRachen when I was in full and important case? Was when we attacked? Again, when I\nwas next to the Howitzer and we were doing. And it was a big fight there. That's an\nimportant part for me to tell about that fight because the Jewish heroes were there.\nEnd of Tape #8\nConclusion of interview.\n"

        "A: My name is Harold Zissman, although it is not my birth name. My birth name was\nZuckerman, same Harold. I was born in Poland in a city called Austrofmazotyetski (ph)\nand that was about a hundred kilometers east from Warsaw. My parents and grandparents\nand many generations before them were of the Hasidic belief. However, they were\ninvolved in business from crockery, porcelain, glassware, and they used to distribute it to\nthe stores in the vicinity and in further away places, maybe 200 kilometers to 300\nkilometers from base. It was a divided territory that they shared among the other and it\nwas their territory. They would supply to the stores. My father, like my uncle, like his\nson, all were part of the operation who used to, by horse and buggy, deliver goods to the\nvarious clients each week. And this was the means of making a living. It was three\ngenerations involved in it -- my grandfather, his children, which that means my father's\nbrothers and sister, my uncle which it was, again, part of the family. So, it was a family\nowned and operated, a closed corporation that all these families lived out of this business.",
        "A: My date of birth is 19, ah, May 10, 1922.",
        "A: Well, my personal life was brought up a real strict, devote Hasidic kind of way. Besides\nall of that, my father was a Corporal in the Polish Army, during World War II, and life\nwas strictly on a military basis, with the command, you had to do that, you were told to\ndo it. If you didn't do it, you had to report. So, it was really a strenuous life, that it was in\nthe house, especially for me since I was the oldest of four. I had two more brothers and a\nsister, who vanished in the Holocaust.",
        "A: I graduated a tri-level school, which it was a private school, influenced by Zionist\norganization, Mesrah (ph), to which my father was a member and a member of the board\non top of it. Tri-level because it was Yiddish, Hebrew, and Polish; it was not just for\nlinguistic-sake, but in history and geography and literature and so on. And later on, I\ngraduated equal to a college, as we talk about the modern way; the name was\nDachkemone (ph).",
        "A: When you talk about scholastically at the time, it was a sectarian school. It was strictly\nboys, without girls, and it was strictly influenced by religion, so it was a boys' religion\ntype of school; if you wish to call it parochial, would be in place. However, from the\noutside world, we were living on both sides for Gentiles. So to say that I associated with\nGentile boys, yes, I did, played maybe soccer with them, or just like neighbors sometimes\nget together.",
        "A: Oh, yes. As a kid going to school, it would have been sort of different as to bring it out in\ntoday's world, as we live in, in the 20th century. We used to, for instance, to give you an\nexample, going to school early in the morning, carry a lantern, for instance, to go. The\nboys of the neighbors at that particular time, maybe would walk their dogs or stuff like\nthat. And it was nothing odd to see this dog was sent against us. Although, we were going\nsometimes two, three kids together, neighbors; or maybe throwing, for the sake of play,\nthrowing a rock at us. I did not see friendliness in it. I sensed that because the words that\nwould follow it would be sometimes easily recognizable: \"dirty Jew.\" And the likes that\nkids were ready, even at that age, and I'm talking now by the age of seven, eight, nine\nyears of age. And you probably did not, I did not get the training of hatred, but I felt my\nneighbors kids do what they did to us was hatred.",
        "A: There was no sense. You do what you've got to do. At times, sometimes maybe you\nthrow a rock back. And that's when a fight would ensue and you'd come home and have\nto pay for it because the parents did not like for you to fight on the street. So, to resist\nwas bad; not to resist was also bad. So, it was a mix of no decision and no resolve.",
        "A: First of all, it was in our history books in 1933 when Hitler did come and became\nChancellor of Germany at that time. So we were aware historical from school. Second of\nall, come 1937 when Hitler drove all the Polish citizen Jews out of Germany where they\nhad to come back, although Poland didn't claim them, but they were Polish citizens. We\nwere exposed to them real early because our city was about 40 kilometers from Prussia;\nin other words, the location would be to go about 135 kilometers from Kinegsburg (ph)\nwhich was Prussia, and we were about 100 kilometers from Warsaw. So, for us to see\nscene at that particular time was a real scene to see. The people came to the city and they\nhad nothing with them; all they had with them was their belongings that was on them.\nAnd I remember we would learn as a child that kitchens were set up for those people so\nthey could come and have something to eat. And it was cramped quarters for the people\nthat somebody moved in with somebody else and so on. So the story in 1937 was not just\na story that one read in the paper or one heard on the radio if, occasionally you could,\nbecause not every home did have a radio, but you used to listen in sometimes outside\nnear the windows of the houses that did have a radio. And it looks like the people didn't\nmind; they were all aware of it. So it was no longer a story that was told, but it's a story\nthat was seen. It was real; the trap is there.",
        "A: Okay. It was, a few months later, I'm talking now '37, come '38, this scene became more\nvivid locally. We had the river Nalif (ph) going through our city. And it may sound a\nlittle funny that in 1914, during World War I, it was Germany that was occupying the\narea, not this type of German's that they build a bridge that was still considered new in\nour city, crossing that river. And at that particular time, the Polish Army started to start\nbuilding dams; in other words they wanted to flood the on-coming German Army. This is\nhow they thought yet in their minds, that it would be. So basically, being that you were a\nyoungster like I was at the time, that in the summertime going to the beach which we\nused to walk and share our fun there, areas near the beach became restricted because they\nwere building the dams. So one could not help but see a war, sort of this kind building\nup. We only did not know how long it would take. So, to answer, as I just stated, we did\nknow something tragic as war will come, but we did not know when.",
        "A: Yes, it was a personal tragedy at my house. I lost my mother at that time and tragedy was\nhome already. As a gesture, my mother's sister which still alive in here -- she's in a home\nnow -- and her brothers, which with they are no longer alive, tried to save me. Since she\nhad a letter in her possession, the last letter which I have, with my mother pleading for\nher to save me and bring me to America. They did send me the papers and as time that I\nwanted to leave, I didn't make it. Hitler beat me to it. By 1939 in September, I was\nsupposed to come for the visa, but September 1, the war broke out. So, yes, as I said, we\nfelt it and we knew it, the other tragedy. Personally at home, the size, the eminence of the\nother tragedy to follow, with Hitler.",
        "A: The preparation before the war, as I mentioned about the dam and the mobilization it\nstarted already, in early '39. And at that particular time became month by month, the\nnews became as an echo, closer to the cities, especially like ours. For instance, on market\ndays, before hostilities had started, we used to have an exchange of German people\ncoming in to purchase their eggs, buy their chickens and so on, because it was an open\nmarket and Poland was willing, we had an over abundance of food in Poland and they\nwere good customers so therefore, we saw all at once that not so many Germans coming\nto market days because Poland did not now want to sell it to them, so before making it a\ntotal restriction, there was limitations of how much they could take out, or how much\nthey could buy. So, one could sense a change and all of this here affected a little bit of the\neconomy because you were built up and ready. The other part, my father would come\nhome with stories telling of sometimes inticinating (sic), stone throwing, and so on. So,\non every occasion, being from school, being from for instance religious upbringing, as\nwe used to come. I was singing in a choir at that time with one of my friends who were\nthe cantor's children attending the same school as I did. Yavnev (ph) was the name of the\nschool, by the way for the record. And the tune of the high holiday 1938 was no longer\nthe same as it was in '37 or prior to that. It was sort of more solemnity. So in every way\nof life, from school to going to synagogue to going to the beaches, one could sense a\nchange all over. And you did not have to find out what; everyone was tuned to the news\nvery much and the newspapers. And, in our own family, we started to prepare ourselves\nand my parents and grandparents remembered that in World War I, our city of Stranlinka\n(ph), which I am speaking of, at the time that I was, we were living in Stranlinka.\nBecause prior to that, my family were in another city, the city of my birthplace,\nAstramocietska (ph) involved in the same business as I aforementioned, but they were\nforced, of their personal matters with one of the partner's bankruptcy, to move and they\nmoved to Stranlinka (ph) in 1929, re-starting again only a family operation, not like\nbefore when it was multi-families. And therefore they decided, since they were\nremembering that in World War I, Ostranlinka (ph), the city was totally burned down by\nLastrovmazofyetsky (ph) not having a river nearby, not having the main station railroads\nremain quiet, so they decided that probably the war would not reach in\nLastrovmazofyetsky (ph) but it will be only in Ostralinka (ph). And, as a means of\ndividing, so they also took are merchandise from our warehouse and try to put it in hiding\nin the other city, so in case it gets destroyed here, they'll have something to live on there\nand vice versa. So, yes; the family began to know before September | that world, not\nknowing to us that World War I was going to be named but that some war is going to\nbreak out any time, any moment. And that was what they decided to do, basically, 1s to\ndivide. And closer to the war, the family, all of us, were in that city of\nLastrovmazofyetsky (ph) and in Ostralinka they left the homes, the houses that we were\nliving in, as sort of to the outcome it will be.",
        "A: Ostralinka.",
        "A: While I went to school, see again, I started school, looks like my parents did not know\nwhat to do with me at home. So at three and a half years old I was sent to a private, to\nlike a malamet (ph) as we say in Hebrew, which it means a tutor translated into English.\nAnd it was private. That tutor had about ten, twelve kids and it still is, I'm of age now,\nbut it's still the picture of that one room and with all the songs surrounding it, you know,\nwith the story of a tutor still 1s very vivid to me to this day. So, three and a half years of\nage, I already was a student in school. However, it was again another story. When I\nreached the age of seven, school in Poland was compulsory. You had to start at 7 o'clock,\nat seven years old. So therefore, when I reached the age of seven, we were in a new city\nalready, moving into Ostralinka (ph). At that particular time I was very advanced in my\nYiddish and in my Hebrew teachings. However, Polish I could speak but I did not know\nenough to qualify to be in the first grade. And since it was a private school, so my father\nwould be involved paying extra money for three years for me to catch up because,\naccording to the exams, I would qualify to go into the third grade, but I did not, they\nwouldn't let me be in the third grade since I did not know, had enough education in\nPolish. So my father hired a tutor to tutor me at home in Polish only and with permission,\nand I was transferred into the second grade. However within the first year and the tutor, I\nwas able to go in immediately, not even finishing the year, to third grade. So, it was\nrough on me even then, already, you know, as it was the rest of my life.",
        "A: Okay. At the year that I'm talking about, to make it vivid, it falls out before the high\nholidays, as we call our Rosh Hashanah, the way it would be. So the day before Rosh\nHashanah, while we were in Ostrovmazovetsky (ph), that's when the Germans entered the\ncity. That first hello from them that we had was the same very day, within hours, they\noccupied the city. They started to round up Jews, in other words, coming in with their\nguns drawn in their hands and you they rouse, \"Jew out\". And we were all gathered at the\nplace over there, where it was the high school, which had a big place, you know. But, I\nmean the place that was the playground that they had. And we were made to be seated,\nhands over our head and the war, I cannot exactly tell you the amount, but there were a\nfew thousand of us. On the balcony, we could see a machine gun, a big machine gun\ndrawn. We were surrounded in lines in between, with German soldiers, be they had\ncarbines, some of them had automatic weapons. And for what reason we were there,\nwhat, known knew. But we expected the worst in the position that we were. After an hour\nof sitting over there, and it's already curfew time near, all of a sudden, looks like it was a\ncommand and we were told to get up and round back. As we found it out, the next day\nlate, that Army was called to help some on the front line while they were going towards\nWarsaw at that time. In the days of the war, it was probably the fourth day of the war,\nand so take it, more or less, that it was September 4 at that particular time. And we were\ndriven, sort of to go back to our homes and shots were followed, a lot of them were killed\non the way. Like, this year, my father, and as we were split up because we were not\ntogether there, and my father was running in another direction and since he was a military\ntrained person, he knew how to go on his stomach and so on, to get out of the fire's way\nand he, when we came home, everybody was there but my father and we took it for\ngranted for that night that probably he was killed. However, in the morning, he made his\nway to meet us and it was a joyful thing that my father was not killed, and he told us that\nstory. So, yes. The first day of greeting, we found other casualties, the rabbi of the city\nand a lot of people from the, from one type of synagogue near the house, were driven\nwith their shawls, or , as we call it, to the area where we had a lake. We did not have a\nriver in Ostravmazofyetsky, but lake. At the lake there, there were lined up German cars,\nthat they were asked to wash them with their shawls and then afterwards they were asked\nto go through. They did not know how to swim, so some of them drowned, you know, we\nknew right there. And when they came out, they were beaten. So, there were begin some\ncasualties really known. We again found out that now, in order to, you cannot buy\nanything so there was lines lined up near the bakery in order to get bread. And soon\nenough, the police, the local police, which it was organized with arm bands. And the\nGermans started to pull the Jews out of the lines that the Jews cannot stay in line for\nbakery goods, to get. So, yes. We immediately knew the expectations to a wait; that it\nwill not get better but it will only bet worse. And it was a matter of when.",
        "A: The next thing that had happened, a local government came in there. By that particular\ntime, it was about a week later already into the war and the following the holidays it was\nalready , which as you know, it follows Rosh Hashana, Yom Kipper, and five days later,\nSucot (ph). And the family decided to go back. We went back part, my father, I, and a\nfew more. We were afraid to move, to touch the merchandise that was there because it\nwould have been confiscated. However before that happened, I must not forget to tell an\nincident that a rumor had it that leather, shoe leather was hidden someplace because the\nPoles used, at that time, cooperated very easily with the Germans and the German\ndemands were met. So if sometimes, they knew who the merchants were and who what,\nand they were aware that a lot of people were hiding their goods because they were afraid\nin case, so they couldn't find it and we, for what it's worth, that's my grandparents, both\nof them, my father and I were among the 10 or 12 hostages that were lined up again and\nthey said if somebody's not going to tell them about where the shoe leather 1s hidden, we\nwill be shot dead. So the first time in my life, I had the fear of being almost lined up\nagainst the wall. Luck was with us that the building next to us, the leather was discovered\nand we were let to go home. So, sort of to speak it, you were counting your blessings. So\nthe second time that ever it happened that we were lined up, that we came out whole as\nfar as the family, no casualties. But there were casualties already there. The chores\nimmediately had started. The Jews had to line up on the outside in a given place and from\nthere cleaning the streets and so on was the kind of work that we were ordered to do.\nAnd, of course, let me not forget to say it was without pay, for pay the billing was in\norder. And we decided at that particular time we had to have a paper that allowing us\nbecause without a paper who knows who could happen on the way? So we managed to\nget a paper, as refugees, that we were running, during the war to return back to our place.\nAnd, the Germans gave, not the Germans but the local, from the local area we got there.\nAnd we were on our way back. And on the way back, every time we were traveling, we\nwere stopped by the Germans and they made us get off from the wagon and start to look\nbut we did not, we did not yet had anything to be heard, until we neared one place, a\nvillage, I think it was, maybe, I would say maybe 20 kilometers from our city. In that\nvillage lived one of our relatives and he had a store, a general type store and we found\nout, because we stopped to find out what to do, we found out that they already had a\nsmall massacre of the Jews and his family was among them and the store was no longer\nin his hands because it was confiscated. So we found out a little bit of mishap on the\nfamily right on the way there. No sooner had we got to Ostralinka, back to our home, our\nhome was not robbed or anything like that; it was still there because the rest of the people\nin the building were there, so it was sort of like was somebody to watch it. So once we\nwere there, again the chores started, the same as over there. My father was ordered and\nthey put him into jail for a day because he was cleaning. That was the main chores that\nJews were given to do, street cleaning or any of the office buildings and so on. And we\nnoticed at that particular time in Ostralinka that it was less of an uprise, less going on\nthan in Lostravmozavensky, which we found out later the reason. The Soviets were only\nat that particular time sharing the city, so one part of the city at the other end, one day the\nSoviets would come in, the other day the Germans. So we took it as an interpretation that\nsince the Soviets were part over there, the Germans did not try to act out in the same way\nas they did for instance in Lostravmozavensky. That was never supposed to be belonging\nto the Soviets so they had a more free hand. That went on for another few days while we\nwere in town until one day, it was still the Jewish holidays of Soco (ph), the second days,\nso the, it was placed notices all over town that within ten hours, the Jews are to leave.\nOfficially it said you could take all the belongings that you want. In our case, since we\nhad a horse and wagon, so there were three of them so we shared it among the family and\nbesides the furniture, we tried to manage to take some of our clothing and so on and to\nleave with that. Immediately, the same day, the Poles from farming and the other places\ncame into the houses and they were not asking, \"Do you sell it?\" or anything, but they\ntook the furniture out of the house. So our house was emptied out of furniture within a\nfew hours. And there was known to stop them. We tried to open up the store and maybe\nmuster to get a few, some money out of it, of whatever it is, and no sooner we opened up\nthe door to our store, a Polish person brought the Germans here. The Germans start to ask\nwho the owners is, I was there with my uncle. As soon as we realized the questions, we\ntook the first chance and run away from there, back home, and that was the end. So in\nother words, that was confiscated. So however, the other part in hiding was, still in\nLostravmozavetsky, where I and a cousin of mine, in a few months, almost two months\nlater, make a chance and cross the border with the horse and wagon, dressed as farmers\nand we make an attempt, the Germans almost caught up with us and we salvaged some\nmerchandise from there, from the hiding place, which it gave us an ability with, money-\nwise, to have for the first winter that we were over there. And it's a long story to tell until\nwe get there.",
        "A: 40 kilometers, which, 1n our miles-way, we were talking about 20 miles. So you must\nunderstand, 20 miles driving with a car is nothing, but with a horse and buggy, it would\ntake, with the horse and buggy, you know, it would take a few hours which you would be\nthere.",
        "A: When do you talk about, in the first days of the war? Yes. Until we were sent out from\nour city, you needed to have a piece of paper, that in other words, you were permitted. So\nonce you had a permit, you were stopped. They checked the permits but you could move\nabout.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Okay. All the German forerunners were on motorcycles. That's how they were, that was\ntheir infantry, starting with motorcycles and then trucks and so on and armor would\nfollow them. Immediately, their crews would post posters on lighting poles or\nwhatsoever, wherever posters could be posted, telling the new ordinance, what it is: A.\nThat it was curfew hours. B. That the Jews must be identified and must carry\nidentification and in the early part, at least in our city, we were supposed to wear a band\nwith the Mark of David, with the Star of David on it. And it was told immediately if one\nis caught, they will be shot. That was for anything that one violates, violating the curfew\nwas shot. It was immediately declared that Jews cannot walk on sidewalks. So, the\nidentity was the arm band and you must not walk on the sidewalk; you must walk just on\nthe streets. And the same story was, in reading on further, one would know that Jews no\nlonger can attend any schools, Jews can no longer own any businesses, Jews no longer\nhave rights and that was stating according to the rules of Nuremborg. Therefore, for the\ntime being, the ghetto was not erected as yet, that was not talked about as yet, but they\nalways must report every morning to their assigned places for the assigned work there.\nSo in the first days of entry, when everyone got out of their hiding places, running away\nfrom the bombings, they were faced immediately with the rules and arm bands affixing\nand so on.",
        "A: Oh, yes. One did not try to there because we saw the consequences how easily it was for\na German to draw his pistol and even without anything, can be just target practice and\nthere wasn't a day or anyplace, as soon as they came in, that killings were not going on.\nAnd they were not re meditated; they just a lot of times were out of laughter. And I've\nseen with my own eyes where a mother and her child were target practice, to shoot, to see\nthat one bullet should kill both of them at one time. And it was not to save a bullet, but it\nwas just that the rest of the Germans would laugh, you know what I mean, you would see\na scene much rather than a murder being committed.",
        "A: Well, the Poles at that particular time, please understand, immediately remained as, those\nwho worked in offices were left working in offices. Those who were formerly in the\npolice, a lot of them escaped for fear and a lot of them were drafted to the services, so a\nnew police force was being organized. Also they were carrying bands to identify the\npolice. So the Poles were pretty much back to their normal lives, whatever they had to\ndo, you know toying around with a new regime, you know. But the important thing was,\nas a Jew, immediately your businesses were confiscated, you know, and if you had lived\nsomeplace in a nice area, it was nothing to hear new that you were pushed out. But, as I\nsaid, that was in Lostrovmozavetsky, in the first few days; but we came to Ostravlinka as\nI for mentioned before, things were a little bit different and not so rapidly, due to the fact\nthat we were sharing the Soviets on the other side and the town and one did not know that\nthey may not occupy the whole town. So, therefore it was a little bit easier. So when it\nhappened, it happened to us rapidly; ten hours and the Jews must leave the town. When\nwe came to the borderline with bayonets they went through our belongings and if like\npillows, you saw feathers fly everywhere, so in other words, and if it's anything valuable,\nthey tried, nobody dared to carry open gold or rings or anything like that, because that\nwas confiscated on you there. So then, you would still get a few biddings and go to the\nborderline. And there was a no-man's land shortly in that part than over on the other side.\nIn our group, the family, my grandmother, my mother's father, he spoke Russian yet\nbecause he knew to write and to read Russian. So he served at that particular time for us\nas the interpreter and we crossed over on the Russian side.",
        "A: It was not a decision at what point. As I said, when the posters were posted that this is\ndeclared to be a city of the Third Reich, according to the Nuremburg laws, a Jew was not\npermitted to dwell in the Third Reich. So we were given ten hours, as I said, to move out.\nSo, as I said, we had ten hours to leave and we had two choices to make: either to go, as\nwe called it at that time, Congress Poland, which it means out of our city to any other\nplace, or we could cross the border to the Soviets. The Soviet border was remained open\nfor all who wants to cross and to come there. That was the part that it helped a lot of\npeople be saved or rather, that 1t saved their lives crossing like my family did. And that\nwe went on the other side.",
        "A: Okay. We went to a city 36 kilometers from our city called Lunja (ph). And from there,\nabout another 15 kilometers or so was a city called Yedvobno (ph). Yedvobno translated\nfrom Polish to English would be silt; the silt city, Yedvobno. In that little town, our\nfamily probably from the shakot (ph) to the rabbi to anybody else was somehow related,\nyou know; second cousin, third cousin. And the family sort of found ways to get situated\namong all that family. So even if it was only one room that it was given to go in there.\nAnd immediately, we had to register with the police ask so on and so forth. And\nyoungsters were asked to go back to school because it was September, and the school\nyear was disrupted for a little while. School had started. I enlisted 1n school at that\nparticular time, again. Since Russian was not my language, but I had to study so instead\nof coming in according to my education, I should have at least come into the tenth class\nbecause the Russian had a ten-year school. I came in at the ninth with an examination\nbecause on everything I tested but Russian and I was back into school and it started a\nnew life, sort of, in a way feeling of joy, even though everything was left behind and all\nof a sudden we were supposed to be the proletariat. And of course, the identity that my\nfather was a businessman was a shameful thing to say, shameful enough that you could\nhave been arrested and sent to Siberia which the bad thing for one, which like it\nhappened to some of the family, turned out to be good wishes for later, because it since\nthey were sent to Siberia, they survived the war without a lot of these problems that the\nrest of us had to go through, those who survived. So, at that particular time, started a new\nlife. I, as a young person, was starting again like all young people used to get together\nafter school in the evening and it was the Russian system, which they called\n\"Dacadumcrasne ami\" (ph), which it means the house of the Red Army. And the Red\nArmy used to supply dances, sort of in playing, and it was, you know, that was part of\ntheir propaganda, how Stalin cares for the youth and Stalin loves us. And all of a sudden,\na new life had started, to listen to politicians talking and voicing opinions that we should\nlearn the constitution of the Soviet Union and that they came to liberate us and so on. It\nwas a new lexicon for me and many of us to indulge and I remember it was influenced on\nme as a young person; after all, I was only 17, going into my 18th year of life and\neverything coming on so fast. So, I remember when I used to come home, starting to talk\npolitics with my father and tell him the wrongs, the way he was doing before, without\nrealizing, and my father told me, \"Wait, son. While you're in school and you come home,\nyou have a clean bed and you have food to eat. It's very nice for you to talk of it. But,\nwhen the day will come that you will have to earn your living, you will see who is\nwrong.\" Because my father, and the rest of the family, first being religious, second they\nwere against communism or socialism to begin with and it was sort of life at a time rolled\nback to working with them, being school influenced on one side, and being influenced on\nthe other side. For me, I felt good, that no longer I have to go and go attending religious\nupbringing and so on. So as I lot of youngsters, you choose what it's easier and better.\nAnd especially, you come at night, and you go out with all the boys and girls and it's\ndancing, it was sort of a different life without knowing. And you know, that was, that's\nblind thing that it was put up. Before long I joined even an organization called Soviehem\n(ph); it was a sports organization so you get involved in sports and it didn't take long,\nwhen we were asked to take our passports and after then we took out the passports, things\nbecame a little bit more strict. We were restricted as we cannot live 100 kilometers from\nthe border which that city of Vadlov (ph) was less than a hundred kilometers, you know,\nto the border, so therefore as refugees, we had to start moving. So the first time winter we\nthrough there, come spring, new problems had started even on the Soviet side. Now we\nhad to leave all this family, leave all the people that you knew and move to at least a\nhundred kilometers away. We choose, Galestov (ph), for instance, was the big center. Big\ncenters were forbidden for these displaced persons to live in there and we had to . That's\nhow it happened that we came to the Ratchen (ph). The Ratchen was a city that it was far\nenough from the borderline and we were permitted. However to get housing, was again\nanother problem over there. They were not prepared to take in this many refugees.",
        "A: I would say that even at the time, if it was not officially restricted at first, and we are\ntalking about not even a year there, but people were understanding of the circumstances\nso they did, after escaping the Germans, everything that the Soviets had to offer was\ngood. So, therefore, instead of violating the rules so people, yes, did practice in hiding. It\nwas another way like we were for instance, which I didn't tell at the beginning, on the\nfirst day of Rosh Hashana, that we descended in a cellar at that time, and my grandfather\nat that time, and on the top, going down to the cellar on the top we put on a piece of the\nfurniture so it should not be visible in the event the Germans come in to see. And I spoke\nto my grandfather at that time and I say, \"Now I understand what they went through in\nSpain, in the year the Jews were practicing.\" And he says, \"Be quiet my son. Don't talk\nnow. Pray to God maybe we'll survive.\" So, that's how deep the religion was in these\npeople. They saw only one way out of it was through religion. So, now when we're on the\nSoviet side, they did practice religion but no longer did I have the discipline that my\nfather would ask me, \"Did you pray this morning?\" Because I went to school again and\nhe realized that I'm becoming brain washed with something different so it was sort of a\n\"Don't talk. Don't tell. Don't ask,\" situation that I was brought into to live in the new life.\nAnd, as I started to say at the outset, getting situated in the regimen was not an easy task.\nFor instance, a whole family moved into one single room next door to a guy who is\nmaking harnesses for horses and so on. And that room used to be his workman place. But\nit looks like all the bitterness became sweet and everything was well. After all, as I said,\nfor the first winter, the merchandise that I and my cousin being risked our lives and\nbrought it in, lasted for that time. But all of a sudden, everybody had to get work. My\nfather, since he still had the horse and wagon and that gave him a good way hiding than\nhe was not a businessman but he was a working man, earning a living through that. So\nnow, he used to do with his horse and wagon taking some merchandise from, which they\nused to call it Soluzatil (ph) which it was scrap metal and so on, and he would have to\ntake it to another city to bring it in to the big warehouse. So he had a job for this year and\nthat helped him to do black marketeering while under the cover of this merchandise that\nhe had. He would go ahead and smuggle like saccharin maybe, and other things like that.\nSo, when you were going to Sloyen (ph), you would take along some eggs, butter,\nwhatever it is to trade. There was no money. Trading was the important thing, and come\nover there, buy flints for instance, for lighters. That was a big thing because matches\nwere in a scarce place; getting sole, which it was a very scarcity item or sugar. So, it was\na matter of black marketing. It was against the law. If you were caught with it, five year\njail was the term. But need and the necessity to go on does not get scared by five years\nimprisonment, you know. And we went on and at times, at first I still was in school,\ndidn't get involved. So I tried to go ahead and listen to what they told me in school and I\ninvolved myself to become a working man. And school at that particular time taught you\nand they kept saying that no matter what we do, we must go ahead to do work. And I\nregistered to go to Galistog (ph) to a place and I wind up in a place were they were\nbuilding actually housing for the soldiers. And as a youngster I never did this kind of\nwork before and there I have to take the wood barrels and fill them. After a couple of\nweeks of work, I thought I'm going to collapse and I returned back home. I got a permit\nand I returned back home and I had to find another job. My father at that particular time\nwas afraid continuing with the work that he was doing over there, so we decided we are\ngoing to go to the forest; which, this going to the forest would build up the future later,\nserving as a base, that I knew the roots of how to escape from the ghetto, although we\ndidn't do it with that in mind, but it turned out to be, yesterday's bad things turned out\ntomorrow's safety and so on. So we came there, over there with a horse and wagon. We\nwere loading trees that were cut down and taking them from one place to the other. The\nother part behind it was that we worked close to the farmers so we could deal with the\nfarmers and that black marketeering was still a part and before long, my father's influence\nworked on me that I got involved doing the black marketeering in the same way\nalongside of him. And for a while, we thought that it couldn't be any better because the\nshortage of food was no shortage to us. We always had enough food to bring home; not\nluxury food, you know, good food that we wanted, but food was around the table, you\nknow. So you had bread, you had butter, you had cheese. You were able to get a chicken\neven though you couldn't get your steaks and so on, but you could have a chicken and so\non. And was the other problem was at that time with kosher slaughter. Kosher slaughter\nbecame a problem. I did not go into the political part of it, to tell you of Poland before the\nwar. I don't know how much to tell or how much you can give me the time to tell, but\ntalking about kosher slaughter, even through 1937, through a woman by the name of\nPristo, Madam Pristo, and she served in Polish Congress. And she was a humanist. She\nsaid that killing an animal, as the kosher slaughter was, takes too much time for the\nanimal to be dead; therefore, we were doing an inhumane thing to the animal. So\ntherefore, kosher slaughter should be forbidden. It stirred up a tremendous out pour\nthroughout Poland because the Polish constitution of 1918, when they gained\nindependence, and Pilsutsky (ph) at that time being the head, and since the Jews saved\nhis life, he owed a debt to the Jews and he kept all these anti-Semites (ph) in place. He\ncouldn't stop them altogether, but he, like a dictator, kept it undercover and control. The\nJews had elective officials, even to the same as they were called the same, Senate, house\nof Congress, as you would call it, you know, and the Senate. And the law, and it posed\ntremendous protest. But I blame the Jewish leadership for not coming up at that time\nimmediately to squelch all of this here that in turn led to the officials handling black\ncandles and they called a fast that we have to fast and punish ourselves so that God will\nhelp us, that this bad law will be change. Well, we know the outcome, that it didn't. And\nthe hypocrisy worked on me even as a youngster. Because why? Instead of forbidding the\nkosher slaughter, we were given a contingency; in other words, you can kill so many so\nthat, in its, tells the wrongs. If it is right to kill 100 pieces of cattle, why is it wrong to kill\n150 or 200. So in it, one so blatantly, that anti-Semitic out burst against the Jews, even\nthough they were constitutionally protected, that it's a part of religious ritual to do. So\nknow, on the Soviet side, all people who are before, remembered this here case and no\none sort of dared to make an issue of it. However, kosher slaughter still went on in\nhiding, as sort of to speak that if you want a chicken to be slaughtered properly kosher,\nyou could, there was somebody who would do it for you. But, it sort of, since the towns\nwere small and the NK VD as we called it at that time, or KGB did not penetrate so much\nand the local people were working in the government so some how rather, it was \"Hey, I\ndon't see it.\" And, of course, in many instances, you paid off for all of these goodies\ndoing it in the say way. So, religiously, again, which it was a big upheaval for people like\nin my family at that particular time. And I as a youngster, did not feel the hurt so much\nbecause I was young and foolish as the saying would be, not understanding tomorrow,\nyou know, what it is going to bring on us later. So, as I said, I already got the taste of the\ncoming Soviet working and being privileged to find out at that particular time, that in the\nSoviet Union, workmanship was by right; in other words, the bricklayer did not earn as\nmuch money, or maybe more money as the guy who was mixing the cement. So, it was\nnot the Soviet system of socialism but it was again, capitalism. In the capitalistic system,\nwe know there are different rates of pay, even for the same work. So, I began do get a\nlittle doubt in the system to what is going on. And that was own a year and a half on this\nsort of living conditions. I still was in school and I came back from Devon (ph) back into\nschool and all of this kind of life lasted, as I said; with working in the forest and doing all\nthe means. And at that particular time, I used to talk to my family, why don't they try to\ngo ahead, go move further east, but their mind was that the work cannot be a lasting one,\nthat the war should be over and we'll be able to return back to the area that we had to run\naway from. However, the 22nd of June, all of the dreams of yesteryears became too evil\nfor that same day.",
        "A: 1941, the 22nd of June, Hitler attacked. I don't want to have to put it in, but maybe we\nhave to. If anyone's seen on television not so long ago, it was brought the story back to\nlife, the way Stalin was forewarned about all the things that Hitler was going to attack but\nit did not want to listen to and he even went away and executed some guys, calling them\npropagandists and until the war broke out, he didn't want to believe that that would be the\ncase. That's a point I want inserted because it's a true fact, the way it was. He began to\nsee it immediately. The local population then, in that city, Rachen (ph), that I was, we\nwere hiding from the bombings, when the Germans attacked and they kept saying they\nwished the Germans would come in already. And after us telling them we already\nexperienced the Germans, I hope that the Russians shouldn't lose and be able, because at\nthat particular time it was a few days the Soviets, a few days the Germans, until it was\nsettled. Because within ten days at that particular time, it had reached almost near to be\nthe Mensk (ph), you know, and Hitler at that particular time was the blitz , it was named,\nthat he'll be in Moscow within ten days. And he almost succeeded, you know, to be there.\nSo things began to turn real fast in a different way. Again, at this time, in '41, like it\nhappened in '39, the first thing when the Germans sent it in the Rachen, the Jews were\ncalled to meet on the place in the center. The center of the city of small towns, like in\nmost cases in the United States also, have also, you know, they call it the plaza over\nthere, what we call the marketplace or whatever. So that was usually the center for the\nJews to be gathered. And they drove us out over there and, again, if you want to call it a\nmiracle be it; to me it is a miracle but it happened. While a man, a German uniform went\nout and spoke to us in perfect Russian and he was a, I believe a captain, if higher, spoke\nto us in perfect Russian and started to tell us about the new law and all of us were\nsearched and if anybody has jewelry or anything like that. So, we had a taste right away\nearly to put it up and all of a sudden while we were there, looks like, you know, a piece\nof artillery that it was the wrong way, hit the corner part of the church and when that hit\nand another one followed, the Germans started it and they were being attacked now, so\nwe were dismissed. But the machine guns were surrounding us at the time. We were not\nthere to listen to speeches. We were there to follow through. They started to segregate all\ndoctors needs to go to one side; you know, the right and left, if you ever heard about it,\nthat's what, we were a part of it. To the right, to the left; no one knew whether the right\nline is the right line or it is the wrong line, you know, to go. And you had no choice about\nit. They would go ahead and look, right, left, and every time they was said, was always\nwith a and that saved us, that explosion from this here artillery piece and all of a sudden\nthe Germans were starting to run around like mice and we were returned back to our\nhouses. Until a couple of days later, the front line started to come for fuller, the Soviets,\nwhatever was left, retreated and that was when life under the occupation with the Nazis\nbegan. A Univad (ph) was formed in the city. A Univad means actually a government --\nit was not appointment. It wasn't even elected but then, we would line up. He would point\nthe finger to one, he would go out to the right or to the other one and they would appoint\nabout maybe ten people. Then they told them, \"You are the Univad,\" and they said, \"You\nare going to be the president and this is where we'll begin to have a government,\" and a\nghetto was formed. So, for the first time, a new life starts again, ghetto; which it meant\nthey mapped out a few blocks of the city which could house only probably a tenth or\nmaybe less than a tenth of the population, and it was with barbed wire surrounded all the\nway around, with doors and we had the police, the local police which they assigned to; it\nused to be on the outside. The Germans could always go inside to the police, but the\nrestriction was for farmers or Gentiles to go inside the ghetto. We could only go out with\na \"shine\" as they used to say in German; in other words, a paper which was a permit and\ngroups used to be started in the morning. We would line up near the Univad; these ones\nare going, those are the carpenters. They're going to do carpentry work. Those are the\nelectricians, going for electrical work. The other ones we'll send to cleaning the various\ntypes of offices or the streets or whatever ensued later, like 1t was winter for instance, to\ngo to clean the snow.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3\nA.... arithmetic of the case, since Jews were only 10 percent of the population, how come so\nmuch anti-Semitism could reach. (Another speaker, unintelligible.) Amoshik (ph). So it\ncould not be right. (Another speaker; \"They wouldn't have to kill anybody.\") It means the\nthree half million people, all turned onto families. The families, let's say make it 3 or 4\nper family, so it would be a fourth of that would have been. So they should have been. . .",
        "A: Life in the Rachen (ph) on the occupation and with the ghetto and Univad (ph) in full\nswing, brought new problems and killings day by day. They were not killings because\nthey were called for, but it was the criteria I have aforementioned. If a policeman wanted\nto have fun, he killed a Jew. Or, when he was working something and if he did not work\nas fast as the policeman told him to do, that was a good way to basically not shoot him,\nbut beat him to death. So everyday used to go on in the same. I had in the ghetto with me\na brother to my father who he was, in part, responsible for helping me with my religious\neducation and he was a graduated rabbi. We still used to, by his demands, when I would\ncome from work and we used to sort of talk about the Torrah, a little bit here and then the\nother. All of that was very distasteful at the time to me, but I loved him enough to listen\nto him. He's the man at that particular time came to me since maybe I didn't mention, and\nI use that word, \"ota defid\" (ph), you know what I'm referring to? That's a French saying\nfor \"burning\" and that was sort of burning on display. All religious scripture, be the\nTorrah, be books and everything, were ordered by the Germans to be making in a bonfire\nwhich they had burned it. They were so scared for knowledge that people could be aware\nthat this was, again, a part of showing to the Jew which it belonged to a part of the de-\nhumanization program. Because, you must remember that we went through certain\nstages. As I have aforementioned before, the laws of Nuremburg were the first laws to\ngive them the guide. And in these laws, a Jew was not a human. A Jew loss all his rights\nand therefore he was a person without rights. So, the same as I have aforementioned\nbefore, when the ghetto started, it was the same thing. Inside the ghetto, a Jew could walk\nevery place. But even by marching to work or doing your chores that you were ordered to\ndo, the sidewalk was forbidden for a Jew to walk on. So,....",
        "A: Outside of the ghetto. Even while you were doing your duty. The only time he could\nwalk out was when he had a broom in his hand and sweeping the sidewalk so therefore.\nBut otherwise, this was forbidden for Jews to walk on those sidewalks. Every time you\nsaw a German, a Jew was asked that he must salute him and say \"Good morning\" and so\non. If you didn't, that was good enough cause for the Germans to beat you, kill you, or\nwhatever it is because we had no rights, so he did not have to bring in front of the court\nor anything like that. You were executed on the spot. Quite often when the killings went\non, I would come home and talk to my uncle and say, \"Look, I'm very despondent today.\nI've seen a child being molested and killed.\" Or, \"I've seen another instance where that\nhappened.\" And basically, that was, then the dig. They started to do a dig at that\nparticular time in the out skirts of the town. A pit big enough for a truck, mind you, to go\naround and turn. And that ultimately was supposed to be the burial places that was\nintended for the ghetto, but it did not happen that way because of the Protestants in the\narea, which I'm going to get to it a little bit later, when we get to talk about the\nProtestants. But, right now, I'm only trying to touch base with life and what went on, the\nkind. Let's say when the winter came, a lot of Jews were killed and lost by sending them\nto go ahead to clean the snow. And they did not have the proper equipment. The Germans\ndidn't provide shovels, it was our job that we, the Univad (ph) of the Jews had to have\nshovels. And to get tools at that time, 1t wasn't like you go into a store and buy it. You\npaid dearly through the local population to get it for you because Jews could not travel\naround and go to purchase things. So, in order to purchase things, that's what you had to\ndo, the outside connection. Another thing which I do not want to leave out: the creation\nof the Univad, a new thing and a new word began to make its place. The word was called\n\"contribution\" . Now, in the normal language when we use a contribution in the United\nNations United States, we talk about a donation. You contribute something to a welfare,\nto a cause. That word \"contribution\" was done exactly opposite; that was a punishment.\nIn other words, it means the Univad could be called and was beat up to the office of the\nGestapo and they were given an order that within, for instance, ten hours for so, this\ncommunity, this ghetto is to write one kilogram of gold. They did not care whether you\nhad the gold, but if you didn't have the gold, they wanted a kilogram of gold. Maybe they\nwere successful to bring 14 ounces; they accepted the 14 ounces, and but on another\ncontribution, which in other words. So, little by little, all the laws began to be of that\nnature. Jews cannot wear leather shoes. Jews cannot wear any leather clothing. So, in\nother words, all of this type; if you had boots or you had shoes with leather, you had to\nturn that in. So all of this here was the part of the dehumanization program and the part of\nbreaking us morally and shy away how to resist the enemy, you know. So you haven't got\nthis and you haven't got that and you can't get the others and before long, and we used to\nhave to come every morning and stay in line to receive the amount of ounces of bread\nprescribed. In other words, it wasn't a matter that you go out to buy, but it was a bakery\nand the Jews used to be delivered bread and the bread was not made of flour. If you heard\nstories that were, you know, putting in sanding from the wood, you know, things like\nthis. It was true. It was like that. And that the Jews had to pay for it. Labor, you didn't get\npaid. So you used to go through all of this here, stay in line to get the ration for the day of\nbread. So food became a problem, and talking about smuggling was again an issue. Since\nmy brother used to know the farmers, that he used to speculate before with the Russians,\nnow he used to, as a child it was easier; he was four years younger than I was, so we split\nup at that particular time. I was with the family of my father's and my brother, my two\nbrothers and my sister went to live together with my grandfather. My grandfather on the\nfather's side was dead; he died already. But my grandfather from my mother's side was\nstill alive and he was there. So he was together with his son and his wife already was\ndead, left a child behind and then he had the three children, his grandchildren. So my\nbrother used to be the one who would steal his way out and if my uncle would find\nsomething that he should give him to trade for food, he would go. And as a kid, but he\nwas very well equipped to be able to do it because necessity at a time mother of invention\nand since we had to make the life of black marketeering, you know, that's what it was. I\ndid not tell you this point, that at this time in my life my father was no longer alive here.\nAs I aforementioned before, that my father used to go ahead and carry on the sayuzatil\n(ph) which is I said metal scraping, to he used to have to go to Slonum (ph) with it, a big\ncity from the Rachen (ph), and in the meanwhile he used to be able to take passengers\nalong who would pay him money and they were also black marketeers. So it happened in\nthat winter of 1942. Now, I got to be careful; not the winter of '42. It was the winter\nbefore the Germans; it was the winter of 1940. So while he was traveling to Slonum, at\nthat time was a big snow, we had maybe 10 to 12 inches of snow. And halfway, the horse\ncouldn't pull the sled anymore because he was sinking, like there was no route yet made,\nso he decided to come back. A friend of his who 1s still alive in Israel today, who was the\nfirsthand story to tell me how it happened, so he decided to come back. And he came\nback; I jumped up from my bed listening. It was something terrible to hear, you know,\nthat he came back. I was wondering what it is. And he told me that it is impassable, the\nroad, and he decided to come back. He was a hauset (ph), like I say, in a lot of Hasidic\nway, prejudiced about some of these here things. For instance, you don't go back the\nsame way; if you forgot something in the house and you came out to get it, they wouldn't\ngo back the same way. They got to go back the other way. So why do I say that? Because\ntwo of the passengers kept insinuating (sic), \"Why don't we go back?\" Instead of being\nthe wall behind the sled, and if the horse stops, you help him. And some how or other,\nmy father listened to their pleas and he decided to go back. So afterwards it happened\nwhen the horse got stuck, it did not have a whip on it or anything like that. He went over\nto the first tree, broke off a branch and came over and the horse wouldn't pull and he hit\nhim, the horse, and the horse pulled up his left foot and hit him right in this part (point to\nhis head) which actually, the way the doctor told me later, he busted an inside artery, you\nknow, and he was bleeding internally. When he came back for the second time from the\nturn and he was already laying, crying, I immediately took him to the hospital with\ncalling the doctor. And the doctor told me that it would be the best cure for him if we\ncould get him to Slonum (ph) to a hospital because he'll need surgery; he's bleeding\ninternally. He was a strong man, my father, that he could hold pain. And no matter how\nmuch effort by morning I tried, that the Red Army should take him with the ambulance to\nthe other city. No matter how much influence I tried to use, and I did not have the\ninfluence to take him and within 24 hours, he was dead. So I had the second personal\ntragedy awaiting me after all this year that now my father remarried after my mother's.\nHe remarried in 1938 and here we're talking about three years later, that we thought that\nit was a good thing it happened to us because the stepmother, she was very good to my\nyounger brother and the others, and my sister, and the house began again to be in order.\nSO we were very appreciative to it. And as I aforementioned, I, at the time, thought that\nI'm going to leave for the United States, and I couldn't. So know it looks like trouble\nfollowed trouble, one after the other. So this time, while we are there and we're doing all\nthis here black marketing, my father is dead now. But the family's got to go on. His father\nwas still alive and he was so proud of me that I can go and keep the family together. It\nlooks like he couldn't die until I would be back. On his dying bed, he kept on talking,\n\"Where's Harold?\" And, it's when I came back, I used to travel by night and came that\nmorning. My stepmother said to me, \"You better hurry to see grandpa; he's in bad shape\nand he keeps asking.\" I came to his bed and he was hardly breathing but he recognized\nme, hugged me and within a few minutes, he was dead. We had a clinic across the street\nwhere my grandpa was living at that time, the Soviets, and I called the doctor. He was in\nright away and it was all over. So both of my grandparents were fond of me in many\nways. Now, this grandfather from my mother's side had his love for me in another way.\nAnd with him, he was behaving well until one day, he wanted to go commit suicide. And\nsuicide, by Jews, religious Jews, is a no-no. He couldn't take all that was going on. He\ncouldn't take his life, his religion. So somebody stopped and they saw what he was doing,\nthat he was trying to cut his arm and they started yelling and then my uncle got him back\nhome and we started to calm him down. But, the man lost his and he couldn't go out. All\nof that took place until I was taken to concentration camp. The story starts like that.",
        "A: What I said about my grandfather was prior to the ghetto being formed. My father's\nfather, when he said he couldn't die until I was to his bed, now I'm talking about my other\ngrandfather who also was fond of me and he, looks like, wanted to commit suicide by not\nbeing able to see life what had been ensuing in the ghetto. You follow me now? Because,\nin the ghetto, as I told you, my brother would risk his life and go out to get a little food to\nkeep for them going. I had to go working and a few times then round ups were, by that\ntime I already built a hide out in the ghetto.",
        "A: As I say, he would steal his way out, as a kid, and you know, he was four years older than\nme and even the other kids. And if he would go sometimes with a line up of the people\nwho were marched out to go to work, he would crawl in to there. And who these days, on\nthe Jewish side, from the Univad (ph) cared that they saw another guy. They were not\naccountable that much, so he would go with us on that line and in the meanwhile, he\nwould get lost.",
        "A: In our ghetto, we did not have Jewish police. The Jewish police was in the bigger\nghettoes like Warsaw, Vilna (ph), Veilostok (ph), large, you know. But in the smaller\ntown there, we are talking about a city right now that prior to World War -- to the\noutbreak of the war probably, maybe, had 3,000 people in total population. So, you\nknow, and then there was an influx of the refugees, you know, more like the way I said\nthat we came. At the time when the ghetto was created, some Jews escaped from other\nghettoes and they came in here. So, our ghetto, I would say from that city at that\nparticular time, when we are talking about in the Rachen (ph) probably must have been\nmaybe 2500 or 3,000 people of population in all. In the ghetto, there was no more than\nabout a thousand to 1200 people.",
        "A: That's a bad question and you'll please forgive me for saying this. Serving in a Univad\ncould never have been a good and bad question because when the Gestapo imposed that\nyou have to deliver and they used to have to go from door to door and really knock on the\ntable and say, \"You are going to turn it over or we have to turn the house apart and you\nare going to have to give it if you have gold, or if you have money.\" You know, they\nwere searching and doing partially before their scheme, and second of all, that was the\nonly way you could do it in those days. It was not a matter that someone was going to go\nto their bank and take out, you know, what I mean, from the hiding and take out his gold\nor money. There was no such thing. Anything what anybody has, was told all the time in\nhiding, people would have buried some things that in case they're searched or anything\nlike that. We had to go ahead to buy things from the local population or through them to\nsatisfy the Germans. So we didn't have gold but there was money available to be gotten\ntogether, American dollars or whatever these people had it, so the means was that the\nGermans did not look for us to better ourselves. They would come at the worst, they can\nmake how much more miserable in the ghetto could become. And this was part of the, as\nI used that word, the dehumanization program that it went out to suck, like to say sucking\nour blood. Picture when you cannot wear, the men cannot wear -- the fur that men used to\nwear was inside fur. I'm not talking about the people of old Mensk (ph), you know, but\nthe average person. Used to take from a lamb skin this part if it was a healthy one, so he\nhad it to the outside finished, you see, and so it was sewn in things and it was decorative\nand so on. But the poor guy had something else, a fur lining 1n there to keep him warm\nbecause that was a good item to keep away from the cold. Now you had to turn all of that\nin. So, what I did, I had a piece of fur in a car coat and I took that and sewed on a lining\nto cover it. Sure you tell me, Harold, what would happen if they would discover it? If\nthey discovered me with it, I'm dead. I ran away to the forest with that thing. But, you\nhave a risk to life. This is why I still say to this day, not only were we heroes in the\nforest, everyone in the ghetto, everyone in concentration camp who managed to survive,\nis a hero because that was exactly anti- what Hitler wanted. So no matter by what means,\nthat one could prolong life and survive, that is the heroism that the people of our stature\nlike myself. Sure, I am happy that I went to the forest and had the opportunity to lead a\nplatoon and to go ahead and do diversionary work like burning bridges, downing\nrailroads, as I get to it a little bit later. But every time I could, of not giving the enemy\nwhat they wanted out of me, I already was a hero at that time. And so, getting killed;\nsure. That's what the meaning was. That's what we were waiting for. And the people of\nsound sense knew about the time that we had. However, a lot of people in the ghettoes\nstill believed that a miracle or something will happen and they will be able to survive.\nBut, those who are hoping for the survival to come, like this here, did not survive. Those\nwho acted in no means or ways, we would have run away, did whatever they did,\nsurvived. No 100 percent, but a bigger percentage survived and that's what it was the\ncase. So, as I was saying at that particular time, I, my little family was split and my\nbrother was helping out. He was the helping hand there. And then one morning, which I\nhad that chapter in my own manuscript, the 33 pages. And I called it my \"Escape to the\nForest\" and I want to tell you in detail right now how that came about until I came to the\nforest.",
        "A: Good. You go ahead. You're commanding me and I'm listening.",
        "A: Okay. The important thing, the life, for instance, picture yourself at a house, for instance,\nof European standard, at the area where I'm referring to. A house consisted of maybe two\nor three rooms. Now, these two or three rooms, if a family was living there with 3 or 4\nkids, was not accommodating, as you know. Picture that same house now, putting in ten\nfamilies. Now, you picture ten families, ten families cramped into a place like that.\nSomebody's going to pick on someone. \"How come you snore?\" \"How come you keep\nwaking up in the middle of the night?\" So therefore, when you say, when you use that\nword normal, that's a word impossible to refer to at that era because that's what the Nazis\nplanned. Then you are going to be so cramped in, you're not going to be able to live with\neach other. And that's what they want. Therefore, you cannot unit; therefore you cannot\ndo all these things like that. So, during the day men and women were out at work and it\nwas not bad. But, at night, can you picture; it's like sardines in the cans. Kids, no kids,\neverything was together. There wasn't a question. Even if there was one kitchen, I mean\none part, and if somebody could go ahead to boil some water. It was all tragedy; where\ndo you get the wood to use to make, you know, the firewood. To have to prepare\neverything became a problem. And know, who's going to be first to use, if they had some\nthings. If they had some food, they had to hide it because somebody will take it. They did\nnot take it with a gun or a stick; they'll take 1t one way or the other. So all of this here, to\nuse that word as I said before, the Univad; no, the Univad was not made to please the\nJews. The Univad was a sign for the Germans to have a conduit between them and every\ndweller in them and they would put out the clothes, for instance they needed to have a\ncount. Everyday they had to present a count. And when somebody died, to go ahead and\ntake them for burial, again, that was all going through. There was one thing about it, they\ndid keep good records, the Germans, and they knew. However we out smarted them. No\nghetto ever had the amount of Jews in there. It always had less in their ways. So\ntherefore, I'm coming to what I said. Food was the big problem to cause and why it was\nbecause we knew it from here and from the other. There are too many Jews in this so they\nhave to kill. So when they killed out, just for the sake of talk, if a thousand people were,\naccording to the accounting, was over there with the Nazis and they killed out 500, all of\na sudden if you were to take a head count, really, you'd find out there was probably 700\nto 800. So, how many to keep up the lease and how to keep that, was never a factual\nthing that everybody knew. But everyone looking around him could see from another\nghetto that all of a sudden we had another few people that was not here. So, it was dog\neat dog and everybody was not telling the truth to each other because you couldn't.\nEverybody shivered; they were scared for their own head. You never knew when it was.\nAnd on the other hand, it's very hard for me to make a person understand how we did not\nbecome insane and all of us lose our senses, to kill ourselves off first. Do you follow me?\nWhen I came to New York in March of 1948 and I gathered with my wife to the family,\nuntil 2 o'clock in the morning when I told them. The question came, \"So, how did you\nsurvive?\" and, \"Since it was so terrible, did you tell us a story or, we believe what you\ntold us is true, so how did you survive?\" And this is the miracle. If you believe in\nmiracles, every survivor survived by way of a miracle. He was not that smart; he was not\nthat schooled. He had plans and that helped him survive. If you have a more questions\nabout the ghetto, I will gladly fill you in.",
        "A: Absolutely. I personally, I speak for myself in this case and I hope every person who I'm\nsaying understood them. That's why we listened and we tried to do what they wanted us\nto do.",
        "A: There was no such thing. I said it to you the story about my uncle. I did not get to tell you\nthe rest of that, that by his demands, I took as we call a shatz (ph). A shatz is six of the,\nyou know, the Homaj (ph), the Tomat (ph) and all of that, and he had all these books and\nI told you about the alta dufar (ph), he made me take a whole set which it was a Torrah\nand other religious things and I built it underneath the roof to make a double and put it in\nthere. Again, as I aforementioned, would they find it what would they do? They would\nkill. But they'd kill anyways. But I pleased him to death. I liked him and I discussed with\nhim some of the things. Like he would tell me at one time, and when I told you when I\ncame there was killing. He said, \"Look, you are a student,\" he said to me. \"And you are a\nvery good student. You remember what happened in Spain, that what they did to the Jews\nand all of that.\" He says, \"God had an opportunity at that time to play with the Jews of\nSpain because they were devoted. He knew that they will not put him down. But can you\nimagine if the Jews of today were to give a choice, what would happen?\" he said. \"What\nwould happen?\" This is how much devotion he, my father, my grandfathers, all of these\nhere people, there was no \"ifs\". There was, that is the way.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: I will have to come to you to tell you about my escape. This is how, we called it a\nselection.",
        "A: Did we have that story part about hiding their religious things on the tape before? No. We\ndidn't put it in.",
        "A: I often used to, after work, have discussions with my uncle, not about my wanting to, but\nby his making me talk. Maybe in his way, it was a means of keeping my moral going\ninstead of down. And he would talk religious things. In one particular day that I vividly\nremembered, and we were working already that day about digging the big pit as I have\naforementioned before. And I literally had seen on that particular day, some gross,\ninhumane ways of the way a policeman, because the way it used to be over there, there\nwas maybe two Germans and maybe 10 or 12 from the police. That's the way it used to\nbe. They used to use a couple of Germans and the local people who were drafted as\npolicemen or so on, they were the ones. And, of course, they had the \"life of Riley;\" their\nfamily, nothing was done to their families but good things and all that they robbed from\nJews were free for them to, for their families to have and to enjoy. So, that particular day,\nI had seen a if you occasions where the guy was bidding the guy at work for no other\nreason but just his blood-thirstiness was in him to show off to the German that he needs\nto be promoted because he is doing, really, the job that the Germans wanted. So, then he\nstarted beating on that particular person. It was at first, you know, the guy was starting to\nyell; the more the guy yelled, the harder the beating went on. So, if you could make sort\nof to yourself or a thing to remember; when they beat you, you perhaps don't cry so\nmuch, so they don't get the enjoyment, realizing how much you hurt. So, if you didn't cry\nat all, they beat you a lot; if you did cry a lot, they beat you a lot. So which way to\nchoose? You had no way to choose. If you survived, you survived and if you didn't, you\nwere left maybe to bleed to death or whatever it is. And then they would ask some Jews,\nto ask the Jews to go ahead to the burial place and the burial place could be anyplace, and\nput them in there, as a reward to them, they were shot and they would bring up. So\nsometimes it used to be going up. I remember times when they used to bring the big\ntrucks in our area. In our area, they experimented a lot of things but few, if ever, were\ntaken to the main concentration camps as we know, the Auschwitz, the Buchenvald (ph)\nor the other one. Of course, we found an uncle's brother first and he related that he was\nfrom Sladen, the city aforementioned, and he was taken among many more. So, I don't\nwant to rule it out, so I say it the way it is. In our place, we did not know or any round\nups that were made to that I them to concentration camps.",
        "A: We didn't. We didn't, in our area, until we did not get out of the forest, and we found out\nthat Jews were remaining a life and they were in concentration camps. The important\nthing, when I use that word \"dehumanization\" was another part; lack of communication.\nThe Jews could not get papers, the Jews could not hear anything. But every ghetto\nUnivad would pay basically to send Gentiles to the Slovan (ph) ghetto or to the other\nghetto to find out what's going on. What everybody wanted to do was to learn a lesson:\nhow to survive. Unfortunately, they paid their way and the survival was not in place\nbecause what they did not ghetto in Slonya, not necessarily did they do in the ghetto in\nJatel (ph) or in the Rachen or someplace else. They wanted always that surprise, that\ndifferent way so Jews did not have an opportunity of surviving or resisting. They did it\nboth ways. They used to get the round ups where all the population was driven out, even\nthe Valde Univad was to the marketplace, and line up over there and it was the right, left,\nright, left idea. And one morning, that's what it was the case. And I usually knew one\nman in the Univad quite well because he happened to be a personal friend for many years\nfrom before the war of my father. He was a personal friend. So a lot of times when a\nround up used to happen, since he was in the Univad, I would go ahead to ask him\nwhether the Univad has any knowledge what's going to take place. That round up, what it\nhappens to be now, I've been denied before somehow or other the rumors; rumors were,\nall the time we were living with rumors, all the time. And the rumors one day happened.",
        "A: That's still I'm talking about in the ghetto like before. Year, approximately again, because\nI escaped in 1942. So we are dealing with the era within '41 and ' 42, May. See, that's the\ninterim period, that's when I'm talking ghetto life, you know. Because I escaped at that\nparticular time, about this time of year, more or less, which is April; that's when I\nescaped. It was like the spring of the year. We did not have calendars, believe me, to\nknow exactly. So I went to him, Veinstock (ph) was his name. And he says to me,\nHarold, you don't know anything about it. Because, I, on a number of occasions, had my\nhiding place where I used to not show. And therefore I wanted to know at that time, too.\nMy horse that I had, by that time was gone already. I did not have any horse and wagon.\nSo, I did not, I couldn't go; I had to do the different kind of chores that I did before, so I\nwound up at that round up in the morning. That morning they all came out. Fritz was the\nname of the head from the ghetto, from the Gestapo by us, and he used to be a lover of\nhorseback riding. And he came out with a big whip in his hands. The whip they didn't use\nfor the horse, but that whip, that used to be his best way. That was a special love affair, it\nlooks like for them, beating a person much more than shooting or killing them. They used\nto have their victims done so that they begged to be dead because that's how they used to.\nAnd we were made lines and in every line, there were police in the middle. So, I mean,\nyou had a police line in this line, you had a police line, and we were the column together.\nSo you couldn't move or you couldn't turn and at one times that's what we were told to do\nand we were searched, sort of displicably, to see. And at first they would say, \"Anybody\nwho has knives or any weapons to throw them out,\" you know. \"If found, will be shot.\"\nWe were, at that particular time, picked out approximately 350, give or take, or 400, all\nyoung people in most cases. Some middle aged people, too, the same way. When the\nselection, it used to be called selection, as it's known; when the selection ended, Fritz on\nhis horse, some police and Germans on motorcycles formed a column on the side and we\nwere told to run, who knows where? Before long, we knew we were running on the street\nthat was leading to Slonov (ph) and of course, they were changing all the guys who were,\nfor instance, keeping us and running alongside of us, were given a place to go into the\ntrucks that were following and stuff like this, so they got in case we got worn out. And\nour guys from the running and beating each time, you would see a few guys were left on\nthe side. Those who were left on the side were left. In other words, if some of them\nsurvived and could escape someplace is a question because behind were trucks and with\nthe trucks, they could see and they had their machine guns tuned easily. So I don't know\nwhat happened because I was not there. What I saw, the way of the scenery went up, we\nwere driven all the way to Slonum (ph). Slonum between the Rechen was approximately\nabout give or take about 40 kilometers, and 40 kilometers, as I say, is less than 20 miles,\nbut you just take and start running under the circumstances for the 20 miles and you just\nsee what is left of that, you know. So, the majority I would say, if at all, we were left\nabout 150 people. That would have been -- I did not count, so I don't want to put the\nfinger, and it was given to me, but were driven into the jail in Slonov. In that jail we\nfound people from other surrounding small towns around who were also, probably been\nthrough a similar situation. A Gestapo man came in in order to keep quiet and we\nshouldn't talk. That was the means, a shot was fired. \"Ach tung (ph),\" they yelled. And\nthat's when the Commandant came in and he started instructions that you will be\nmarching to work, and giving us all the stories. \"Anyone of you who fails to do his job\nwill be executed immediately at once.\" The next morning we were taken again, I was\nwith a group so I don't know how many, but all the jail was empty. We were taken to the\nrailroad. At the railroad beyond a reasonable doubt, we have seen a train, like it was\npartially of, maybe it was tipped over, you know, some of it. Later on, I knew what it was\nbecause I was already knowing that it was a de-railment caused by the partisans. It\nconsisted of bombs, you know, whether they had the capsules in there, I don't know. I\nwasn't that kind of an expert to tell you, but they were all crated and we were asked to get\nall of this here back on the trains and load it up. And the yelling and beatings, the normal\nsituation; that was the lexicon now. At night we were driven to jail again and we were\ngiven something to eat which it looked like soup and a slice of black bread. The soup was\nlike a mixture of corn meal with water, not like this here, but as hungry as everybody\nwas, they were ready to eat each other, you know what I'm saying? And the next morning\nwhen we got out of jail, a new assignment awaiting us, they drove us again on a road\nwhich the road was a connecting road between Slonov and a city called Lida. And on that\nroad, near a small community town called Kovlofschezna (ph) and Puzavich (ph); it's a\nname you'll find on the maps. I have the maps with me at any time if you need it, with a\nlot more information than you think, such as how many escaped to the forest at times\nfrom ghettoes and the annihilation. So if you need any of that information, I have it yet.\nSo, over there you were put in three barns. There were three barns only; there was an\noffice and we saw a military kitchen. Otherwise, surrounding, it looked like everything\nwas with barbed wire around, even if it was a labor camp. Immediately when we were\nlined up over there, I think there were maybe two Germans in all and it must have been\nUkrainian and the other Russian police over there. They were supposed to be our\nwatchers and so on. And after the line up, we were told that we were going to build a\nroad. Actually, they started to build roads, you know, and that's what they did. And we\nwere to be the -- and I don't have to tell you building roads, it's heavy work and here you\nwere working with people who hardly got enough food to sustain themselves. So\neveryday there used to be casualties. So, I mean, I mention that really, before you ask me\nabout it. There were casualties everyday. We thought, being shot, but just beating, beaten\nto death. One day it happened to me. I got a beating. I got a beating by the foreman,\nsupposedly. He was a Pole and at one time when he talked to me and I'm realizing that\nhe's Polish, I spoke to him in Polish and sort of, and he started beating on me. He says, \"I\nhave to do it. If I don't do it, I'll be beaten.\" Because his superiors, this is how the chain\nof command was. You are told that you have to so don't dare not to, because if not, you're\ngoing to get a beating. And, I was out. First out, he took water, you know the military\nbuckets with water, poured over my head and revived me. And I came through, you know\nwhat I mean. I thought, it's just like coming through from death. Understand, I didn't\nbelieve it. He says, \"Look, I didn't want to do it what I did, but I had to do it.\" And I\nthanked him yet. I said, \"Thank you.\" He revived me, he tossed me a piece of bread\nafterwards and that's how my day of work ended and we came back to the barn. So, when\nI say a barn to you, how do you picture a barn? As you see, a barn in Europe 1s built a\nlittle different than the barns in the United States because here they keep, which I've seen\nthe way it is, but in that barn there were two like layers, wood and straw, so it was a top\nand I bottom. Nothing to cover yourself, heavens forbid, or, you know, now we talk\nabout mattress. That's what I told you. It was lots. And all of a sudden, you say what's\ngoing to be the case? And before long, a delegation came from the ghettoes and they\nbrought supplies. I had no one to send me supplies. I didn't have anybody. But I see and I\nfound out, they paid off enough to let it happen. They got some soap, they got some\nthread, they got some salt, little things, you know what I mean like this here. I quickly\ngot myself another friend, you know, you make association. I says, we got to survive. He\nwas from the other side of the road from the small towns.",
        "A: No. No, my brother was left there yet. I'll tell you the story about my brother when it\ncomes later. I decided we're going to go black marketeering under the eyes of them.\nAgain, necessity is the mother of invention. I got, each of the barns were assigned to\nsomeone in charge. In other words, you are responsible that the orders are carried out. I\ntook him to the side and I says, \"Look, the people got here thread, they got here this. I\nand are willing to go ahead and go out by night. We'll get to the farmers and maybe we'll\nbe able to bring some food.\" So, this here, you know, that's how you bartered sort of.\nThey give you this and you barter to bring maybe some old bread, old potatoes, or\nwhatever it 1s. And it was risky again. They say, you risked your life. Of course. You\ncould be killed. Of course. You knew that death is looming every move you make. No\nhiding. But it took determination, like I had, to lead on. Let's go. And on a few occasions,\nthree times we did it. The third time was a longer time until we came back to base and\nthat head of ours, the supervisor, says no more. He says, \"I couldn't sleep. I was worried\nstiff. Maybe they catch up with you and if they catch up with you, they'll come and they'll\nmurder us all.\" He says, \"Harold, that's 1t. You're not going anymore.\" Fine. Lucky for us,\nabout two nights after that, the partisans came and they broke camp. And, of course, the\nGermans and the police ran away. They came dressed with white sheets like the Ku Klux\nClans were; I didn't know it then, but I know it now. They wore robes, not with the thing\non the top, but the bottom. Because the moon was shining at night and with a white sheet\nover, you cannot see objects and that was their camouflage. They had machine guns with\nthem. The first time I saw like soldiers dressed in uniform, like it was from the Red\nArmy, the way they left us. What is that? They told us we are partisans; we don't want\nthat road to be built. You have two choices, either to be killed by the Germans or we'll\nkill you. We don't want that road to go through the forest and you are going to choose\nwhichever way. Tomorrow you have a choice to break out. They're going to kill our\nfamilies behind. We have told you. There was no compromise. I ran over and started\ntalking. \"I would like to join you.\" No, you can't join me now. I says, \"Then what good 1s\nall your talk?\" Okay. We decided, the mean the head of barn and all of it, next morning\nthat we are not going anyplace. We are waiting here. That the Germans, mind you, how\nbad it was that we have to cooperate with the enemy instead of working against. The first\nthing everybody said, we'll wait over. If no police or commands had shown up, we'll\ndecide what to do. After nobody the whole day came, all of a sudden, understand, you\nwere afraid even to move about or to know what to do. So trained were we as it would be\nlike robots. No one dared to say, hey, I am with you. And why? This is what I mean when\nI said the dehumanization program. That's how successful the Germans were, to instill\nthat fear. That was the cooperation they got from us because of that fear. That looks like\neverybody knew he was going to die, or going to be killed. But it was sort of a own\npersonal desire, maybe not today and maybe not tomorrow, you know. So you did not,\nyou know, if you went the other way around, so you were dead; that's all. No big deal.\nThen when the partisans, like I say, so the next day they didn't come. The next day\neveryone went on their own and in small groups through the forest. We did not have a\ncompass either. But we knew more or less the direction and the hope of the group that I\nwas with were all from the Rachen. We said, hope, let us find partisans. We did not want\nto come back to that ghetto, but where do you go. You cannot start a partisan on your\nown; you have no weapons, you have nothing. I say at that time, we made groups of\nabout 20, no more. Because, again, of self-preservation. If the police catch you, it will be\n50, they'll kill 50. So, they would better kill 20 or whatever it is. And everything had to\nbe thoughtful and organized. While on the way walking, when we came to parts where\nthere were farmers, in the morning we saw the smoke coming out of the chimneys, you\nheard the noises from the livestock and so on, they would go in back some of the farmers\nresponded favorably. They'd say, \"Well, we just got through breakfast.\" You know what I\nmean and they would give us, otherwise would give us a bigger part of bread, you know,\nto take along or whatever they could. Other ones would lock the door. \"You better get out\nof here before I'm going to kill you. The Germans find out that I helped you, they'll kill\nus.\" Other ones were overwhelmed with fear and didn't want to help us. And you couldn't\nafford to fight, you know. The fact remains on three days it took us marching like that\nuntil we came to the ghetto. We didn't meet a partisan. Nowhere, as we marched. We\ndidn't realize where the partisans, sure by night you would have probably run into\npartisans. By night we stood in the forest and slept. After working all day, if somebody\nwould get up near you, you probably couldn't hear it either. You know what I mean. You\nwere weak enough already. We made it to the ghetto, looks like the ghetto knew about it,\nthe Univad, and there was sort of no punishment on us or anything like that. On the\nsecond day, a guy comes over to me. And I came back. I started to organize a group, guys\nthat I knew from the ghetto, and I had 22 guys that are willing to escape with me to the\nforest. And I have gave them an order, already was in my mind a commander. I said,\n\"Tonight, everybody says goodbye to their families. Not tomorrow, not maybe, but\ntonight.\" That included myself; I came home, got my people together. Not from my\nbrothers and sister and uncle, because my grandpa was no longer alive. When I came\nback from that, my uncle told me that grandpa died. I still don't believe he died. What I\nmean is, I think he committed suicide, where he didn't want to tell me that. I went over\nand called him to the side and I said, \"I'm deciding to leave, after I told you what had\ngone on with the partisans, maybe I'll get to join them.\" I said, \"I cannot take my brother\nwith. You need him here to help you.\" It was punishing me many years of my life of how\nI left my brother behind. I had no way out, taking him. This way I hoped he'll help the\nothers. Then I said goodbye to him, to my uncle, which I wasn't ready yet. He had still an\nAmerican $20 bill because they used to send it to my grandpa, money to him from the\nUnited States. He sewed it in my pants in case I'll have money for something. Then I\ncame to the family of my father, my aunts, and uncle and I tell them. They all roused up.\n\"Look, what would your father say? What would your mother say? What would this one\nsay? Because of you, the Germans will kill us.\" And I was strong enough in my mind. I\nsaid, \"No. You want me to die with you. Because of me, the Germans will not kill you.\nBut that's what you wish. You might think that it's going to be better for you, that I'll die\nwith you, but I have decided that if I die, I'll die alone. But I will fight not to die.\" And\ntherefore, it started the fights and I left the house. And where did I come? I came into the\nsynagogue. In the synagogue, people were living there, too; 1t was no more synagogue\nservices. People were living on the floors and my uncle came after me, which it was, he\nwas actually a first cousin to my father and he was married to my father's sister. That\nsame uncle used that hiding place which I had built for myself and during the massacre,\nhe and his younger son came to the forest and with cries and hugs, he says, \"I wish we'd\nall listened to you.\" To make a long story short, after that it happened. I did not want to\ngo back to the house there to be with them. I ran away to go to my next in command. He\nwas with two sisters and a mother; no father. No sooner did I open up the door, his\nmother jumps on me, grabs me, \"Tomorrow I'm turning you in to the Gestapo.\" I says,\n\"What's wrong with you? I just came to tell Capel (ph) was his name, I just came to tell\nCapel that I resigned from the whole thing; we're not going.\" \"Oh, that's good.\" And I\nleft. Since nothing came out, a couple of days later when we were going to the line up of\nthe Univad, a man walks over to me. His name was Schumel Bilinstein (ph). He\nsurvived; he's in Israel right now. Through him I got the book about Dr. Atlas. It was\npublished for him. He wrote it in Polish and it was translated into Hebrew. But it looks\nlike there was no one to translate it into English. You know, it's a lot involved and it's one\nchapter, you know. If I ever could do it, get the rights if my book was published, I would\nprobably incorporate it, but I still so far have doubts about it. He says, \"Harold, I want to\nspeak to you. I understand you are organizing a group to escape to the forest.\" I was\nshivering just from the sound of what he was talking to me. I said, \"You must be mixing\nme up with somebody else. You are crazy.\" He hugged me; he says, \"Please, Harold. I\nknow what I'm talking about. I talk to you because I want to join you. I can help you. I've\ngot with me a girl who was a nurse and she had helped amputate the part of the arm from\na captain who 1s in the forest that we know. So if you take us, we'll be of help to you. I\nhave one more guy who is from another ghetto, an escapee who wants to join us.\" \"Well,\"\nI said, \"no.\" I did not want to admit, but evaluating the facts of the nurse and so on, I said,\n\"T'll tell you. I've reached a decision. Tomorrow at 6 o'clock, whoever shows at the fence\nas soon as night falls, we are going to escape. Do you guys have weapons?\" He says no.\n\"I have a bayonet outside of the ghetto near that little river.\" I says, \"I know where it 1s.\nAt least we'll have one weapon.\" The next thing, I did not want to talk about it anymore; I\nwas too much in pain. I wouldn't go back home for that night, for that time that we came\nhome from work. The next day, I told my brother; I went over to him, the younger one.\nThat was my way of saying goodbye to him. I says, \"Take my car coat to the tailor.\" We\nknew a tailor who also survived later in the massacre; Nvetsky (ph) was his name. \"Take\nit to him and he'll have to sew on something for me.\" Really, that was just an excuse for\nme to sort of see him for the last time, which it was. He did. He took my car coat there. I\ndidn't go inside but my youngest sister or brother, I couldn't face them anymore. As soon\nas he left the coat, I saw him from a distance; I saw the guys scatter because there's one\nthing I told him, when you come, do not come as a group. You must come distantly\nseeing each other, not as a group. And they listened. As soon as I saw him, I ran in and I\ntook the, no, I took the coat from him before he had gone into the house, from the tailor. I\nsays, \"I must go someplace right now.\" And I ran away.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "A: We would know that no matter how much there is, when singled out, it never was in any\ncatastrophe, or in any event what it happens. If everybody could think positive,\nobviously, Hitler would never be able to succeed. But because he could divide and\nconquer . .

We held it for three weeks.\nBut, this little group of mine that we come to the forest, could not convince the\ncommander to attack it before. Later, after the massacre we attacked. Okay, I know\nwhere I stopped right now.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: As I aforementioned, to relocate my story right now, my rest of the guys, two men and\none young lady, were getting to the point where we are to meet. I met with them and I\nsaid, \"Now, it's a little bit too light yet. I did not want anyone to see that we are going to\nhave to dig our way out underneath the wires. So we must wait until dusk comes, a little\nbit darker.\" And I know people were not on the outside in those days, in other words. But\nstill and though for the if and I wanted to dig out my bayonet from underneath there for\nthat. So I waited until it turned a little bit darker and we started with our bare hands. We\ndid not have no shovel; with our bare hands to dig a path underneath because it was in the\nground, that's on the other end, and it was the time of year when it wasn't frozen. And we\nmade a dig over there so that we were able to lift up the wire and one by one, we slid on\nthe other side, pushed back the sand to demarcation, so it should not be a mark seen that\nsomeone was doing that. And, we immediately went to the place where I said I had put\nmy bayonet in there. And I had a part of a piece of grass over there that I knew once I\npulled it out, I wouldn't have to dig because I wanted to be on the ready with it. I got my\nbayonet, put on my car \"and everybody held whatever they had with them. That's all we\nhad, was coats. We didn't have anything else. And we started on our way. I knew my\ndirections and I therefore, at this time I'm explaining it to them. I says, \"Look straight\nahead and you'll see from a distance the lights. That's where the hospital is. We cannot go\nthis way straight because we may run up on police or Germans. So, what we will have to\ndo is go out of way until we cross the main road leading from Zulva (ph) to the Rachen to\nSlonya (ph). That was the main artery road. Once we crossed the road, we have to go to\nthe other position. So, I explained to them that that's going to be, and I explain to them\nthat that's going to be, and I tell them, \"We are not going to go like a column, but we're\ngoing to be spread out.\" So, the four of us, in case someone sees, you know, should not\nbe able with one shoot to do it. So, we will keep distance, distant enough. We will not\ntalk loud at all. If you have to say something to somebody, come over, make a marker to\nstop and we'll talk because we definitely do not want anyone to hear. The language that\nwe will talk will be Russian and, in part, we will talk Polish. So, that 1f somebody should\nhear us, should hear any of the two languages; but definitely, by all needs, no Yiddish. To\ncamouflage our whereabouts and who we are. We came, as I showed it to the road and\nwe Started to check and in the same spread out wing, we ran through the road. It was not\na big road. We ran through the road, away from the road, inland, which it was like shrubs\nand so on. And we turned, as I say, and I knew exactly the locations where it was going\non by this particular time. We had to turn a little bit forward ahead because we were\ngetting to be closer to the place where in that forest, that little forest area, they were\nmaking a big dig which I said. And be that it is at night, I still was afraid who knows\nwhether police or Germans, you know what I mean, may not be in the vicinity on the\nother side. So, everything was thought out by me and I outlined, I explained it to them,\nthat's what it's going to be. And after that, we have to cross another artery road which was\nleading into the Rachen and then with the fields alongside that other road, we would walk\nuntil it becomes forest. Forested area, from that point of view that we were from the city\nof the Rachen would be about maybe 10 kilometers, here you're talking about five miles;\nthat forest would start. So it was a smaller forest area, where they used to have hay, you\nknow, to cut hay. And at certain times of the year, there used to be water, you know; it\nwas not that you could sink in, but 1t used to be the water. That's why they used to, some\nof them, have to store their hay on elevated things for the farmers so in the winter they\ncould come back with sleds and get the hay for the feeding of their cattle and so on. We\ndid achieve that and I explained it to them: by good working through the night, we should\nachieve a target which it was called at that time, there was maleojaky (ph) and\nbulchenavitz (ph), the small lakes was called one settlement and the bigger lakes was the\nother settlement. I knew that I had some Gentiles, farmers, over there that I dealt with,\nwith the hope that may be they could help us out. I also did not mention over here that in\nthe winter, I was working with a fishermen's crew while in the ghetto and this crew\npurposely was sent to bring fresh fish for the Germans. So, while we were working on the\nice over there and wherever we were sleeping, they were given barns to sleep in, so I\nknew again. So I tell them, I says, \"Tonight, this was going to be for me to know that I'm\non target. I'll have to hear that much. And, we'll have to go out to the road to see because\nthere's signs, certain signs on the road. So we planned in the little forest away from it,\nover there we will have to spend the day. And that's what we were planning to be our\nmarch, which we were talking about give or take at that night to make no more than\nabout 10 to 12 miles. Because, remember, we cannot march. We did not have our dinners\nand suppers and breakfasts before going, so we sort of gone, it was sort of carrying us,\nthe will was doing it, not that physically we were built to be able to do it. And as\nprescribed, we came to the same, I said the small pond. There were more than one pond,\nso let's call it pond instead of, you know, water ponds. And now by that particular time\nthat we got that far, we were already seeing that daylight was coming. And with daylight\ncoming, we were fearful; we were fearful of anything. We were fearful for the forest, we\nwere fearful for the road. So we decided to break and go into the forest, find a bushy\nplace and one would stay awake while the other three would be asleep and we would sort\nof maneuver around. So it was all planned out well and that's how it was done. They\nrealized in the morning, now, you will see the shepherds because the area used to bring\nout the cattle for the grass feeding and so on. And at night, evening time, they were taken\nback. So since we didn't eat all night and the walking, so we decided to send Heinka, was\nthe girl's name, Heinka, that I said she was a nurse. Somehow or other, a female could\ncamouflage their way more as a farm girl or farmhand than we, as men. And she was\nspeaking good Polish or good Russian so we decided to send her out, to the closest\nchimney, so out to the edge of the forest and you could see the smoke coming through the\nchimney, so that means, they were over there. So, we picked a singled out farmer, away\nfrom all the rest, and she went in there. She said to them that she is looking for work and\nshe mentioned settlements quite in the area where we were, going to hit; in other words,\nthat she comes from Warla. Warla was the name of, I don't know how to translate Warla,\nthe meaning of it in English. But, you know, when a chicken, where the food comes in\nover there on the little part, that's a Warla, for instance. You know what I'm saying. So,\nthat's the pocket over there. So, that was a name, also there was a Big Warla and the\nSmall Warla. So, she was saying that she comes from that. And why Warla? That was\npoor farming over there. There was nothing but sands so the fields were so bare they\ncould only grow red potatoes. And the people from the settlements used to come to the\nforest to work to earn a living, or there was a place where they used to make turpentine\nand the other one. So all of them used to, that was their means of making a living. So she\npretended, because often people from that would be looking for farm work. And she\ncame in to that woman, and told her that she was looking for work, and if they could use\nher. And they told her, no, they can't. She says, \"Do you mind sharing some food with\nme? I don't have any.\" And the woman asked her to sit down and eat but she did not want\nto. She says, \"Give me some food.\" And she brought, you know what I mean a piece of\nbread and everything like that. Now, all four of us were sharing it and we decided to sort\nof sleep awake, awake and sleep; you know what I'm saying? So we heard the shepherds\ncoming nearby with their cattle and shepherds usually baked potatoes; that's the old time\ntrick which shepherds would do. They'd make them in the fire. So we hoped that some\npotatoes is going to be left, which, again, if they cannot eat it, they're not taking them\nwith. You cannot re-bake it. So, the same day after the shepherds left, we immediately\nwent to follow these places to see and dig in and sure enough, we did find a few potatoes\nthat were left over. So there again, we had our food source for the day and that's what it\nwas. And we decided to march again. So, to give you the perimeter, we would manage to\nbe, assuming in our language, about two to five hundred yards away from the road.\nTherefore, you saw the telephone poles as it was. So he could go by that perimeter\nbecause once you got into the forest, you forget where north and south and east and west\nis, you know what I mean? So, this sort of gave me like a compass-way, being in danger,\nwhen we heard any movement, either trucks or stuff like this here, we immediately\nretreated deeper into the forest and stay on guard, which it happened through the course\nof the night, that you would see some traffic going through. And our hope was, maybe\nwe'd encounter partisans so we can surrender to them and beg them for help. To make it a\nlittle bit shorter was, it took us three weeks until I finally stumbled on to one farmer --\nand here I want to explain something as a note, footnote. After two weeks almost walking\naround and not achieving anything, that same Soneg Bornstein (ph), he used to be in\nlarge, before the war, a columnist writer to a Jewish/Polish paper, in large, that guy. He\nsays, \"Harold.\" He says, \"I think we are losing track. Look at it. It's two weeks. We\nhaven't seen or heard one partisan.\" So, I said to him, we used to call him Sonic (ph), at\nthat time, like in Polish. I says, \"Sonic, so what do you want me to do?\" He says, \"Why\ndon't we take and make a vote whether we go forward or whether we go back.\" I says,\n\"You know, we were four of us. If all three of you want to go back, you are welcome. I\nam not going back. If I have to be killed, I'll be killed here. I'll go to achieve my goal,\nwhat I set forth to you.\" So, they looked sort of at each other and says, \"Well, we'll go\nwith you.\" I says, \"Let it be clear; I will not stop. I will not go back. I feel as bad as it is.\"\nUntil finally, one, a few, I mean because right away that it happened; it happened quite a\nfew days afterwards. And I'm already by distance into the bigger forest area. And over\nthere, they had more like colonists, you know, one farm, maybe two, three farms; you\nknow what I mean? But not a settlement anymore. And the settlement, the last one, was\nSlechy Podraberska (ph); again it's a name that's on the map, mapped out. And in front of\nthat settlement was the river Shars (ph). And on that river used to be, before the\nhostilities, it used to be a prom (ph) as we used to call it. A prom is like a passage way,\nyou know, that they lead it, that it's built like on barrels like this here. So they come and\nthey cross the cattle or trucks or whatever it is. And at that time, later on, the partisans\ndestroyed it by the way, because we did not want to make it easy on the Germans to be\nable, if they go to the police, to go through. We destroyed it and the Germans started to\nbuild a bridge that they wanted and after they built the bridge, we needed it too, so we let\nthe bridge be there. But that prom as we would call it, that passage way, we didn't like the\nidea. Not we, I mean, the partisans in general, the command decided that they were going\nto destroy it. So we come there and from distance I remember the house because I used to\ndeal with them often. The father was with one leg, and he was, and so I remember. And\nhis son was a blonde guy. I recognized that I knew him. As I come near, that dog is\nbeginning to bark. And the dog was on a chain, running around the farm. That dog just\nwas tearing my heart out, he wouldn't stop. Before long, they're in back of me and I'm at\nthe edge of the forest. All of a sudden, I see a guy coming out without his shirt on, in\npants, and I take a look. He has tatoos on his hands. With tatoos on his hands, it leaves\nme to believe immediately that he is Russian because local people did not have tatoos on\ntheir hand. It wasn't, but the Russians, quite a number of them, especially a lot of them\nwho used to serve in the Army or Navy for so many years and part of makeup, you find it\na lot. As I take a look and come closer, I see a gun. It is in his pocket, hanging out. I hope\nthat you will believe me that when I tell you is exactly the way it happened. I froze. He\npulled out the gun and he told me to stop, halt. I halted. And I say to him, I mentioned the\nfarmer's name. I say, \"I want to see him.\" And the son, after all of this here, seeing that\nthe -- the guy's name 1s Misha Dubakof (ph). He's a Soviet as I expected. I came out and I\nrecognized him, calling him by name. He said right now to the Soviet guy, or I will call\nhim to the easterners, is an easterner. He says, \"Put, Misha,\" he says, \"put your gun in\nyour pocket. That's a friend. I know who he 1s. Let me go ahead and talk with him.\" So I\nun-froze, sort of and I start going and I come in to him. I shook hands with Misha first,\nand then with him. And he starts asking me, \"What are you going here?\" I says, \"I'm\nlooking to join the partisans.\" I tell him the story already about it. He says, \"Tell them\nthey are safe. Let them come in here.\" I start, they saw me and what had happened, they\nimmediately run away further. Now I have a hard time with my yelling and talking,\nbringing them back to me. And I keep talking to them in Yiddish, basically to understand\nthat if I talk Yiddish, I'm safe. And I tell them, \"We are all right. Please come out here, all\nof you.\" And they finally come out and we all go into the house. I get that man from the\nhouse and I hug him and tell him, you know what I mean? By that time, he asks me about\nmy brother and this and that and the other. I says, \"I cannot tell you anything.\" I says,\n\"You know, I just escaped from the ghetto. It's been three weeks that I've been away from\nthere. I don't know. Have you heard anything?\" He says, \"No, nothing special had\nhappened. You usual.\" Because this gentle people used to keep, were the ones who would\nkeep tabs on the partisans in the same way, and they knew what had happened in the city.\nSo, at this particular time, he introduces me back to Misha Dubakof (ph), as he's the\npartisan. I says, \"I have one favor from you.\" I did not mention it at first. On my car coat,\nI removed the star I used to wear. At one time we were wearing round things, yellow, and\nat one time we were wearing the star. I did not remove that from the bottom, but I\nremoved it from the top that it shouldn't be seen. Be for what it's worth, . I says, \"Misha,\ndo me a favor and have the honors. I want you to cut this identity of mine. You know, as\nI use the word the shameful thing of recognition. And I says, \"From now on, I won't need\nit anymore.\" I says, \"I hope I can become a partisan.\" We are served to eat right now and\nfor the first time we are seeing food? And the farmer keeps talking to us, \"You can eat.\nEat.\" I says, \"We've not had food in months and months so much, so we'll just eat a little\nbit.\" And we thanked them, we did not know, crying, all of us, how to thank these people\nfor what they did to us and he explained to us that a commander in charge of the local\npartisans will be here maybe in a few, not tonight, but maybe in a few days. And Misha\nDubakof (ph) therefore, is taking charge of us and he is going to go ahead and keep us\ncomfort and covered until the, the name of the commander was Zotsof (ph). Zotsof 1s\nrabbit, from a, like Mr. Rabbit; you know what I mean? Zitz (ph). Zitzaf (ph) was like a\ntartar, if you know what I'm saying about a tartar. You know, there is a nationality in\nRussian, the Tartars. They are all short people and their skin is like with little holes and\nso on, not a smooth skin but like this here. This man was a lieutenant in the Army. He\nwas left; he did not want to go to the prison of war camps. And now I must tell you how\nthe partisans got started with. Like Misha Dubokof (ph), like Zitsof, many decided that\nthey did not want to fall into the hands of the Germans and they remained in the forest\nwith the retreating armies. What they used to do, find farmers who needed help. If maybe\nthe son was drafted or killed or whatever it is. So, they would cork for their keep, only\nfor room and board. By day, they would help him and if the Germans would come, or the\npolice would come to the area, they would be signaled by one another. They kept on a tab\nand they would escape to the forest to hide themselves. This is the way that the partisans\nreally had started. With the local people who had to run away because they were working\nwith the former Communist government, and they knew that they must stay away,\notherwise they would all be killed. So in certain areas, some of local area turned in those\npeople, to make good with the Germans; you follow me? So, between the local left overs\nthat were involved and between the retreating armies, those who didn't want to become\nprisoners of war, this is where they choose that life. And later on, the Germans got hold\nof it because the Volasof's (ph) Army already was surrendering and they had all a new\nArmy of Ukrainians who used to work for the Germans now and fill-in for whatever they\nneed, in local or on the front line. So the Germans permitted all the farmers who do need\nhelp, if they see a prisoner of war, because that's how they were able to get hold of the\nprisoners that were in hiding, that all they have to do is register them. Once they're\nregistered them, they can keep them as working. A lot of them did register and then they\nwent on the Germans side, joined the police force or anything like that. Others were\nreally killed; you know what I mean, by the Germans or sending them back to the camps.\nBut, I'm talking about those who succeeded in their mission to stay out, becoming POWs\nor working with the farmers and that's how the partisans started. At that particular time,\nthe partisans, I want to tell how the rest of it a little bit later, but I want to tell about us.\nWe had to wait a couple of nights until Zitsof (ph), as I'll use the name, Zitsof, which he\nwas the commander. And like I say, he still had the ammunition, leather jacket, and\neverything that he was wearing at the time when they retreated. And he was a very\nnervous kind of guy, heavy smoker and drinker, just as much. But he was a skillful\nshooter. He could go ahead and 1, 2, 3, you know what I mean, and aim target and have it\nthere. And I had the pleasure of meeting him at that time and all of us, so he came in and\none by one, we went for interviews with Zitsof. And I told him that I was sort of the\nleader of the group. I helped them out, told him about myself. He says, \"Tell me, what\nyou're doing is good. But, what do you think we have warehouses here with weapons? I\nknow you want to join. We'll take you in. Where are we going to get weapons for you?\" I\nsays, \"Where do you get weapons for the others? Tell me and I'll get them.\" \"Well,\nyou've got to go kill a policeman or German.\" I says, \"We are already. Whenever you go\nto, that you are going to do these kind of ways, to set up an ambush, we volunteer.\" He\nsays, \"Okay.\" He okayed us, all four and we had a good few drinks with him together to\nprove it, our loyalty and everything like that. And the day afterwards, we were taken to a\nsemi-camp. What was the camp? A wooded area deep over there with big palm trees. We\nused to spread out, you know what I mean, something underneath what they used to\ncover the horses with and that was your bed. You did not have no pillows. Your rifle was\nbetween your legs and that's how you were, you know, until you were, they used to have\nan Army, sort of, kitchen set up with a fork of the trees made, and buckets and that used\nto cook whatever we could get, you know what I mean? Because we would have to go to\nfarmers and wait for and ask, but this time we used to go with weapons and ask for food\nand we would get it. So, we had the first taste that we joined. The second news was that\nwe were going to have a ambush in the next few days and all of us would go. I was\nelected to climb up on the tree and be the observer. So I was given field glasses. All the\nother ones, there was a group altogether of about ten partisans and they heard the news\nthat Germans and the police and Fritz, which I had mentioned his name before, who was\nthe head of the Gestapo at this time. On this particular ambush, we, all right, Fritz remain\nwounded but he, they took him back, you know what I mean to the Rachen, but this is to\nthe Rachen ghetto at that particular time aware of partisans that was over there, but it\ndidn't do much good. There was no organization. So we went on that ambush and\nsucceeded. And I ran to get, the first thing I got was a pistol and I got a gun from\nsomebody else, I mean a rifle from somebody else. And before long, as you know, all of\nus had weapons. So, at least, but my job on the top of that tree was to signal to somebody\nat the bottom of how far and how many. The policemen were riding on bicycles and Fritz\nwas at that time on a carriage driving; that's how he used to drive. You know, he had,\nsitting like a king. You know what I mean, driving. And there was a contingent of maybe\n10 or 12, you know, call it, you know, that they wore over there. And what do you think\nthey used to do, come to the forests either to go ahead, take certain things that they\nwanted, food for themselves, you know, like ham and the other things. The farmers\nalways had it. Or if not, they went to go to come to the farmers to have a good time.\nThat's where they used to come in the junkets like this here. We attacked. They started to\nretreat, but one of them got killed right away. The other one injured, which we killed him\nanyways. And Fritz escaped. So this was my first participation as a partisan and I felt\nmyself right now ten feet tall. Here I got a pistol, got a rifle. Later the pistol I gave away\nto Zotsof. He didn't want it. They didn't let you have a pistol right away. So I had a rifle\nand I was full of joy, full of hope that now I'm doing something worthwhile. Now the\nstory of the fights and the partisans 1s a big story to tell which it would take. I wish you\nwould tell me how much further you want me to detail on it, or to go a little bit more. So,\nyou tell me.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "A: Until I reached the forest, I never experienced using a weapon in my life. And after the\nambush, when I got that rifle, I asked later to be instructed of the usage of the rifle, and\nwhich I was shown how to clean it and how to use it. And I still remember vividly the\nfirst ttme when I fired the first shot, which it was 1n the air. But, holding the rifle the way\nI was instructed to hold, it gave me a bounce that I fell on the ground. And the instructor\nat that time told me, \"That's all right. Don't get scared about it.\" But, you will learn that\nyou, I held it too strong to my body instead of a little bit aiming it and having the touch\nand feel. So, that was really my first experience that day, in my life, where I went away\nto use a Weapon.",
        "A: In what way do you mean?",
        "A: Okay. The concept at home before the war was that killing was not a Jewish way. The\nJewish people did not hold guns, you know what I mean, like this here, like, in other\nwords like joining, like a lot of people join the rifle club or anything like that. In the\nHasidic way of life, you could never encounter that. I believed the news breaking about a\nHasidic person holding a gun, that change came in Israel and it only came after World\nWar II. It only came after the Holocaust when finally, the people who cherished a\nreligion became understanding that you must learn the art of weaponry. Because\nbasically, historic the Jews were warriors. They had warriors or they could never have\nSamson, they can never have King David and they can never could have all the era of\nhistory. But, the Diaspora (ph) was a different element what Jews lived in and weaponry\nwas not the form for them to be. They were afraid, they were guests in a country and they\nfelt like it, that therefore they should not antagonize by it because the only kind known to\nme when Jews were practicing weaponry was in Europe, in Poland before the war, who\nbelonged to Batar (ph). But my family had no dealings with Batar. My upbringing, I am a\nBatar person these days but I only switched, I only changed after the war. But in those\nyears, I was not. So therefore on the Jewish scene, with the exception, not 100 percent,\nwith the exception, weaponry or rifle clubs was not a Jewish life. And it was not part of\nthe Jewish way of life.",
        "A: Right. And this is why the change in my life came later, just because of that perhaps, I\nsay that. And that's where the change came.",
        "A: Well, after the ambush, now, we were in that camp, trying to join the rest and just to\nbring to understanding an average day of life in the underground, what did it start? The\nunderground was living in at that era of time, in bushy parts of the forest. They used to\nsee separately a company; in other words, you couldn't come into an area and you found a\nthousand partisans. Perhaps to find a thousand partisans, which they were in the local,\nwas probably in ten different spaces. So we used to be living like in companies. A\ncompany could consist of a maximum of 100, maybe not so close. And then it had so\nmany platoons. At times used to have two platoons, at times we used to have three\nplatoons, depending on the way it was. And, I must mention here the commander's name;\nwhatever his private name was, was the name of the company; like for instance, Zitsof\n(ph), which I joined with, the name of that company was Zitsof. There was also Blatoz\n(ph), there was Fadyakomorov (ph), there were Lanskytrak (ph); there were a variety of\nmore. And all of that goes, didn't change until about 1943 when we used to be when we\nstarted getting para troopers who used to be dropped at a bigger force of Naliboky (ph)\nand then they used to make day away to our forests. When the partisans were organized\nunder the direct command of Moscow.",
        "A: Leipachani (ph) forest is where I am dwelling at this time in the area that we were. And I\ngeographical area would be between one river named Chara (ph) and another river named\nYemen (ph) and Yemen was the big river. And literally located, it was between the\nvicinity of Slomun (ph), between the vicinity of Novogrudate (ph), and Lida (ph) and that\nwas the perimeter in which we were located, which on the map it would be found. Now,\nthis is the way we started; as time went on, it diversified, 1t became bigger. When the\nGermans would attack us, at times when we became too powerful, we again would have\nto breakup in smaller groups, operating in various areas. The brigade used to assign areas\nof where which way we were. Now, the other part, how did they achieve all of that? They\nused to have like a parole or consult. Every time, every night, or rather, every day for 24\nhours, he used to be a parole name, maybe tonight, today, the next, Moscow. So, the\npartisans would meet with partisans. The base at Moscow, we knew that they were also\npartisans because we operated at night and you couldn't, a lot of times see.",
        "A: Well, the staff which it was the general staff and the local area staff used to decide on all\nof these here things. At first, when we were groups by itself, like Zitzof (ph) groups and\nthe other, I remember we used to do it by whistles. And I would, we used to do three\nwhistles as a response, two whistles as a question, you know. So it went on from time to\ntime more modern it came when we were more organized, when the content was. When\neach company used to have a radio man, the whole tune and everything else changed. But\nthat didn't take place until about mid 1943 when we were equipped with our radio man\nand immediately we could have the direct contact with the staff, let's say, from the\nbrigade or the brigade could get immediately in touch with Moscow. For instance, at one\ntime through 1943, when the front lines began turning the other way, that the Germans\nwere starting on the retreat. Stalin gave an order and he talk about the partisans, but the\ngreatest help to the war was through the partisans because we kept the Germans busy.\nThe more Germans we kept detained in garrisons towards the forest, the more we kept for\nthem towards the cities because they couldn't depend on the local themselves. The last\nman power, they were able to send to the front lines. The more mines we used to explode\nto stop, even if it meant stopping the trains, going in a certain direction to the front lines\nfor one day, one day's supplies means a big deal to the front lines. So it came up on order\nat one time which it was coded \"rail\". That was the code name, \"rail\". On this night there\nwas a direct order from Stalin that under all circumstances, wherever this is a partisan\nbetween the Soviet Union to the farthest line of the front or behind. On this night, every\npartisan must contribute to destroy as part of the rail. In many areas we were sending in\nsmall groups to make the damage bigger and in other areas, 1t was an order that we had to\nfight our way because the Germans began already to watch the railroads. Which again,\nand in the meanwhile, we gave them additional people to use for watching the railroads.\nSo they started instilling a system which it was like electrical wire but it was not the wire\nelectrically, it was like through bells. Then we would come to the railroad, we would\nstumble on something and that would sound off a sound. So at times we would not even\nknow. At another times, they would go ahead and put mines alongside for the infantry\nmines so once we would come to the railroad, therefore we could be killed or that would\nsend off a signal and save a mine from coming. They had to include the locomotives to\ndetect. So we involved in one way or the other much grief and problems for the Germans\nthrough that. So Stalin gave therefore that order that the rails on this night and on that\nnight, that's why it was. We, through power of attack, which were otherwise, everyone of\nus was given a piece, it looked like a white piece, they used to call it in Russian, \"towel\n(ph)\" , that's the plastic explosives as we call them of today. It was an oblong piece like a\npiece; it had one piece like to put in the capsule and these capsules were various. They\nwere capsules where you could go ahead to detonate them, it would draw a line from a\ndistance so much away and as you pulled it, it triggered it off and you would explode it.\nOther times we used more; we used to make this together in bigger amounts and put them\nout underneath there and wait. We used to do it in places where it curves, on a big curve.\nAnd on a big curve, everybody knows the train slows down. So before it goes into the\ncurve, once past the locomotive, we always wanted to hit the locomotive when we used\nto make an explosion because if the locomotive explodes, no matter how much damage\nyou didn't do to the rest, but this here causes so many trains passing that to de-rail. So it\nwas all strategy involved. They used to sometimes put in a wire into the ring and that\nwire we used to put right near the rail so as the locomotive would travel, it would trigger\neither by weight or it would trigger to touch, this here part of the wire, and the explosion\nwould occur. We used to retreat to quite a distance, so, but the distance far enough that\nwe would hear it, sometimes. On other occasions, it happened, your mine did not explode\nbecause it was a faulty capsule. We did not have the equipment all the time. So before we\nhad this fancy explosives, because when we were in touch with Moscow, they dropped\nby air all of this kind of things in the forest and it used to be distributed to the other\npartisan organizations. Before that, what we used to do, so many, as I aforementioned,\nthe soldiers who knew ammunition and every company has at least a few guys who knew\nammunition. They used to take, for instance, the shells from the artillery shells. The\nartillery shells basically melt them out into a box or square or whatever it is and we\nwould now how much explosives, put in just one of these here capsules to this place, wire\nit, and you take this here and that served as an explosive. At times, while the capsule was\nthere, in the artillery shell, we would mend it to be able to form, to make a capsule. There\nwere specialists. I, only have seen it, worked with it, I couldn't tell you, I can only tell\nyou of one incident that one time that we were on the rail and we were on a very special\nmission, as Poles, sort of, going and on the way when we reached our mission and we\nturned back to go way, as partisans, and we had to demolish a few bridges and lines. And\nat one place near the railroad, I was wearing a long coat and all of us had enough to drink\nbefore. And I remember seeing that wire almost, if that wire had been a little bit more\ntouching it, we all would have gone to hell. But again, drinking was a part of the\ninsecurity that one lived. So, in the partisans, it used to be a slogan, vethum (ph) \"let's\nhave a drink\". Swabota (ph). Now there is glory, today there is victory, so we got to take\na drink. Then we had another way that we were sad because we had, we suffered losses,\nwe were ambushed or whatever it is. So, of course you have to, so one way or the other.\nMoonshine, we did not have regular vodka, moonshine was part of the diet that I would\nsay 99 percent of the partisans used to be involved. And you couldn't help it, you lived at\na time that the next minute, you could be dead. You were not responsible for yourself, so\nthat was part of the irresponsible that it was going on. However, I think the Russian\nArmy still is involved in a lot of drinking. I don't say that the American Army isn't, but\nI'm sure it's more visible as the way the Russians were.",
        "A: That's the true answer, both ways. One time, you drink for everything, celebrating, and\nyou drink so much that you got drunk. On the other hand, you came into a place that you\nbecame drunk by not being able to handle that, you know what I'm saying? .",
        "A: Well, the comraderie or vice versa was no contribution to the drinking. It was basically,\nwe must understand that these people had lived in a poisonous area before they came to\nthe forest. The poison that Germany or the anyway Nazis did through all kinds of\npropaganda, somehow or the other penetrated to them. And a lot of time, it was a cause\nwhy so many joined to become anti-Semites was not directly but it was just, became a\npart at first like in a joking way. For instance, I remember when we got the paratroopers\nto us and at one time jokes started to penetrate and go around about Jews. And the first\ntime I ever heard the expression with the long \"r\" instead of abram (ph), you know, the\ndifferent way. Because a lot of Jewish people pronounced it that way. And like one of the\njokes, for instance, we were telling was, if fight, let us fight, but send me on the last\nwagon. This is only to tell you that they existed and though existed in a more way than\nthat. And the biggest problem was, when we knew that this were, that the paratroopers\ncame and trained in Moscow. This is why it would irritate one to realize that the poison\nwas not planted down here, but the poison was already planted in Moscow or other there.\nWe did not know at the time of the atrocities that Stalin did and the killing of Jewish\npeople, that it went on at that time. We didn't, this type of communications we didn't. But\nwe did know that many in the rank, of high rank, Captain Lavida (ph), for instance, in our\narea, in our forest, and he had, he's, the man was sent down for one thing, political. He\nstarted printing a paper and that paper was distributed in the local area and so was it\ndistributed to the partisans at the same time. As I mentioned, the politicalization of the\nRussians began to come back to us in the year of 1943. And we had to listen to a little bit\nmore coaching and teaching. While we were at war, and we were not there, but we still,\nthey had to bring us in. So all these changes, changing of the name, changing in\ncommand, different things, while some of them were positive, there was a lot of negative.\nAnd at that particular time, one could not go ahead sort of, in a way, feel out as we were\nso mistreated by the outside world and so many anti-Semites were around, that it was sort\nof small wonder, that somebody else is joining the same. As it looked like, the whole\nworld was against us. And that's the feeling that we all had. So, it used to be at times,\nwhen we were done, meaning the partisans in general, the Jews would not be all to\nthemselves because basically, when they came to the forest, a lot of the Jews came in a\ngroup. For instance, in our area, we had Dr. Atlas. In our area we also had the Alonzos\n(ph) which comes from my wife's area, you know, from Jetel (ph) or Jachoviz (ph),\nwhichever way you want to call it. There were groups, 100 percent Jews that they\nescaped the ghetto and the massacre and they came then. So the commander, for instance,\nlike Dr. Atlas was there. And he was the one who was practicing doctor, but the man\nwent to battle. And he gave his life in battle. But his group was called the Dr. Atlas\ngroup. Later after he passes on, this group changes its name and we get an escapee from\nthe POWs by the name of Sherbin (ph). Sherbin was a very beautiful commander, at that\ntime when he took it over. But, after he took it over, they did not let it be anymore the\nwhole 100 percent Jewish, they incorporated other partisans. So the change went on like\nintegration. Yes and no. When the times were good, they didn't want to separate Jewish\ngroups. When the times were bad, so even the Abramofs (ph). You know, it was at one\ntime the commander at that time was Abramof. In Abramof's group, there were 80\npercent Jews and 20 percent non-Jews, and the mistreatment was clearly. In other words,\nwhat kind of a word was sent home? And, you know, when, in these kind of cases, he\nwas not Jewish, Abramof, you know; or even if he was, he was not telling about it. And\nanti-Semitism was a clear venture to see in the everyday affair. And I want, for instance,\nright now to dwell one day life as a partisan. We used to have a wake up time, but now\nwith the Army, somebody was blowing the coronet or whatever it is, but 1t used to be a\nwake up time that we had to get up. And then we used to have to get up and there was a\nbriefing time. That took place already where we were under the direction. The company\nwas called to order. The commander was coming out and tell the details for the day,\nwhatever we had, each company has to do. Maybe this one is going for an ambush, the\nother one is going for provisions, the other one is going someplace else. So, you were\ncalled to order and after that, you had breakfast. Our breakfast was, in that part of the\nworld, you don't have a breakfast like in the USA. The breakfast could have consisted of\ngood meats or something, maybe pasta mixed into it. It was a soup and meat\ncombination, one way or the other. And it was on a, built like a bonfire and in the middle\nof it a bucket. And, so, if you had at times a Ukrainian being the chef or sort of, the cook,\nwe ate a lot of Ukrainian-style meals. And if we had that it wasn't a Ukrainian, so we had\nanother style. But the same thing that I'm bringing out, after you had your bite, then you\nhad, there was an order everyday, cleaning the weapons. And it was not easy to keep the\nweapons clean as you would, you know, as if you would be outside of the forest. You had\nto go ahead at times, your platoon commander would have to go ahead and check\nwhether the weapons were cleaned. Then, you used to sometimes go ahead, you had\nrecruits or whatever it is that just came in. We did not know how to handle mines. I\nremember taking my platoon at one time to a lake. When you detonate a hand grenade\ninto a lake, there is no sound. So we used to go ahead and teach them how you pull out\nthe button and you hold on with your hands and throw it, because we used to have a\nGerman hand grenades; used to be with a handle, the Russians were without a handling.\nThey were like an egg with little schrapnels in it. And we would go ahead. And then we\nhad fish afterwards, because from the explosion of that, the fish come up, surface at the\ntop, you know what I'm saying? So, we couldn't go ahead, for instance, to train a machine\ngunner how to shoot, you know what I mean? Only by explaining it. Because it would\nhave been, first of all, a waste of bullets which you could not afford to waste and second,\nit would be a give-away of the location. So, there were a lot of things under\nconsideration. But, yes, the guards; every camp that we set up used to have certain guard\nposts. And the platoon commander used to have to assign from his platoon who goes\nwhere. Then there was choice for the platoon commanders. Everyday was the man of the\nday; in other words, he was the commander of the day. So, he could have been only a\nplatoon commander but today you were in command. So, actually, if we had to go\nfighting, you were instructing until the commander, the regular commander, would take\nover and you would go into battle. So, the assignments were a regular routine, almost like\nArmy life and we had to participate. So, cleaning of the weapons; now, the attitude. A lot\nof weapons, as we are talking now from between '42 and '43, the retreating armies left a\nlot weapons behind. Some of the farmers took and hide some of the weapons. We had\ntrained enough Russian soldiers who were able to rebuilt weapons. So, from three rifles,\nmaybe we only rebuilt one because you couldn't, you needed a certain part here and\nanother part there and they would skillfully do it together. We would clean the bullets.\nWe did not have any other means but sand, but we'd sand. They would have to clean and\npolish so we would have bullets. A lot of it was retrieved from the rivers because while\nretreating, they put a lot in the rivers instead of leaving it for the Germans. We pulled out\nof Pancer (ph), Pancer truck, from the river Shar, and my commander at that time,\nPechulud (ph) which it was his name. And he and other crew refurbished and rebuilt it\nfrom another one; from two of this year or maybe more of them, wound up to make the\nmotor work and everything else. And we used it at one time, on two occasions into battle,\nwhen we had to attack. So, the same thing achieved to build up a Howitzer (ph), 122\nmillimeter, you know, where the sacks of the gun powder comes separately from the\nshell. And again, we had to retrieve these here things from what we found. The Germans\nhad the farmers or the local area retrieve all the weapons. At that time, they used to\npurposely clean it and at times, while their trucks would keep up these weapons, we\nwould ambush and maybe take it from them. It was a life of dog eat dog everyday, about\nobtaining. In those years I'm talking with polishing the weapons and re-building, did not\nhave command posts. We did not have no orders from Moscow and to get ammunition\nwas the only way to get it from the Germans. So we used to attack a garrison, for\ninstance, we were able to, we attacked it basically to obtain weapons. We knew they were\ngoing to come back, but we got so many rifles, so many machine guns, so much of the\nbullets, and everything like that. So, that's what the attack on the garrison served for.\nNow, another daily routine which it was, where we used to be sent out in various places,\nto cut telephone. Military phones, you know, in those years, you couldn't have the\nwalkie-talkies as we know today. So, a telephone had to have telephone wire. And the\nconnection between one outpost to the other with wires. And we literally would have to\nhave groups of guys because to cut telephones, there would be enough to send a group of\ntwo, three guys; one at that stay watch and two to do the work, cutting 1t down. We used\nto sometimes utilize civilians. We would come into a place, take some civilians, make\nthem be the laborers. So the three guys, they went away and got three more farmers so\neach one of us could do certain jobs that much faster. Some of the farmers did it out of\ncooperation with us; some of the farmers did it under the gun; we made them do it. But,\nthis was a regular routine of cutting telephones, at times burning bridges. The bridges\nleading to the forested area, we always wanted it not to be around, because we did not\nwant to have it easy on the Germans to come in with their Penser (ph) trucks or to come\nin with their light tanks, or whatever it 1s to go to the forest. So at times they would go\nahead and lay a pentun (ph) or something and come. But all of this here were efforts that\ngave us more time either to organize, either to retreat. If we knew that a big Army was\ncoming, it was no use to set up battle against them. But, to send up explosive areas, to do\ndamage, to make them believe that who knows 1s behind or to have a big armies to go,\nthat's what we achieved to do. And if I was to say to you and tell you, battle by battle, I\nhave that recorded. But, 1t would take me too much to name you the way it was\norganized. I can tell you one battle in particular points which it was, which is of trying to\ntell you because we had girls and boys as well in our fighting. And I'm talking about, not\nthat I'm trying to change the subject; I'm talking about Jewish girls and boys who were\nnot skilled in being shooters or killers, but they had to turn to the savagery of the times\nbecause that was the only way for us to survive. One, for instance, that I left behind after\nI escaped, Rusha Batskin (ph) was her name, and we were, she was in part of what I said\nto begin with, Dr. Atlas group, and later under Shuben (ph). She was Shuben's girlfriend,\nfor instance; even love went on in the forest and babies were born in the forest, or they\nwere killed, and abortions were going on in the forest. We had a clinic, sort of for a\nhospital, in hiding. It was very well sealed. The Germans in our area never got to the\nhospital; now, that's how it was sealed through little walk-ways to go in, in a place were\nthey couldn't come, they couldn't come over it with heavy trucks or anything like this\nhere. So, we were organized at that time knowing that the Germans are trying to come to\nthe area to collect wheat. All the farmers -- do we have enough time to go on? .",
        "A: Okay. The Germans used to give to the farmers like tax, that they need from them so\nmuch wheat, so much butter, so much chickens, so much livestock and so on. Each time,\nthe news would be spread around to the farmers, we would get hold of the news and set\nup ambushes. So, to give you an example, if we were to set up an ambush on them, and\nwe wouldn't touch them while going to collect it, but after they made their collection, the\nfarmers were to distribute it in this and that place and this place. Then they would re-load\nit and start taking it to the cities. So beforehand, the farmers used to bring it to the cities.\nWhen the partisans became organized, no longer would we permit them to take it to the\ncities. So, either we would get it from the farmer and give him a receipt, or we would\nmake an ambush and when the halting is organized, kill all the Germans or the police,\nand then turn around, with all of these horses and buggies and wagons with whatever it\nis; livestock, if not livestock, it was wheat or oats, turn them around, bring them in the\nforested areas to the poor farmers because the forested areas, farmers were not well-to-do\nfarmers. But they allowed us to be there and give it to them. It was taken from the rich to\ngive it to the poor, as it said. But in our case it was taking it from the Germans and giving\nit to them.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "A: Well, this is why I made my business to go ahead and write that manuscript some 35\nyears ago. Believe me, it was the wrong time that I did it, because when I did it with my\nEnglish of today, it would have been published probably ten times over and would have a\nmovie done because all these fights and going on, you know, you've seen probably\npartisan movies, maybe like it went on in Yugoslavia with Marshall Tito. He was the\nchief. .",
        "A: Due to the fact that the Germans were supposed to collect that contribution from the\nfarmers of wheat, when it came to our command's knowledge, we set up an ambush. We\nwere trying to ambush the Germans at that particular time before. While other ambushes\nwere done after they would have already the collection made, this time we wanted to set\nthem up that they should come and we wanted to really show them that we are a power in\nthis forest. On that road leading to the forest, between the city of the Rachen and another\nlittle town in the forest called Rudayaverska (ph), since it was, that area was Lipichani\n(ph) forest, were three, before you came to that river Shara (ph), there were three little\nbridges on our perimeter. The little bridges were served from the farmers as drains from\nthe fields of the water to go into the canals. So they were of use to the farmers and that's\nwhy they were built, was drainage of the canal. We decided that we were going to use\nexplosives on it and burn them up. So, the first bridge we decided which it was closer to\nthe Rachen, that that bridge we will explode the first. So, since our forest by way of\nespionage, found out and they had onlookers from the distance seeing what is coming 1n,\nso they were no Penser (ph) tanks, there were no Pensers or tanks or anything like that. It\nwas just that they were on horses and wagons and a truck, which it was carrying the\npolice and the Germans. So, we decided at that particular time to let a certain amount,\nsince the police used to always be in the front; the Germans used to not be in the front,\nbut the back. So, the police we let through first to come in there and then we decided to\nblow the bridge. When the explosion of the bridge was, was one truck got caught in the\ndelay and it blew up because of the gasoline and so on. Immediately they descended into\nboth sides of the road, starting to shoot on each side and we saw their positions. So once\nthey started to shoot clear and they got up, we immediately started to shoot against them.\nSo, then they were in total confusion, because on this side of the road was shooting to\nthem and on this side. But the way we were placed in such a position that we should not,\nour fire shouldn't be shot against each other on the other side of the road. But in this\nparticular time, the way the Germans laid themselves out, it was almost sort of the way it\nwas meant to be, that our fire would go against them and not against our own across. So\nwhen we started shooting, when we started firing, all of a sudden, hands went up to the\ntop. Those big heroes, the Germans, as well as the police, no longer were tough guys and\nthey started to plead and beg. Ammunition on the side was collected and we started lining\nup. Among the Germans over there, there were the Desunden Freur (ph). On our side of\nthe perimeter, I was at that time a machine gunner and I had a Russian type of machine\ngun with a round disc on the top and I was placed from place to place were to attack and\nwhere to shoot. And before long I found out that we had a casualty of someone that I\nknew close, which was a girl, tall girl and a brave girl. She always used to go to battle\nwhenever her brothers. She was with three brothers together and one of them used to be a\nmachine gunner, used to, Anamoxinkas (ph), we used to call him. Anamoxinkas is a\nwater-cooled machine gun. And her other brother, which it was the oldest one, became at\nthat particular time the commander of the platoon, of the former Dr. Atlas's group. And\nshe was the casualty of the day. She was shot from this, when I said the Germans started\nto shoot on this side, so she was a casualty and we just found it out. As I go on the other\nside to clear, to look for Germans or police who were either wounded or whatever it 1s, I\ncome and near me I see another girl from the Rachen, which she was also with us all the\ntime, Rasha Baskin (ph) is her name. I don't know her whereabouts today, because when\nI escaped the Soviet Union, she was, she remained behind and I have no contact with her.\nBut, she spotted, she says, \"Look, Harold. Look, Harold. Here's the Zundenfuer (ph).\" .\nThe Zundenfuer means that he was the head of the region from the Gestapo, and he was\nthere. And as we approached him, I approached him now with the machine gun, she had\nat that time a rifle only in her hand, and he says to her, \"Don't.\" And he starts pleading we\nshouldn't kill him, whereupon he pulls out a pocket from his pocket, photographs of the\nRachen girls. Whatever this man, either he was in love with them or had love affairs with\nthem or what, we at that time did not know. And neither did I want to listen, so I wanted\nto shoot. She starts pleading with me, \"Harold he is mine. You're not going to kill him. I\nam.\" And she basically, with the rifle went and smashed his head to pieces, because after\nseeing the pictures of these girls, we know any SS guy or Gestapo who has pictures from\ngirls which they used to do at practice, have sex with them, then taking pictures with\nthem yet, understand. All of them, you know what I mean, to put into sort of their\ncollections. Now, at one time, I must say, that I had to give a good reason and a good\nthanks to Rasha Baskin for killing a person. And it was beyond my personal belief, in a\nway, but in battle you see the enemy and you don't see anything else. And that's what it\nwas. And we moved on. Of course, she says she's going to take his gun. I let her take his\ngun because trophies; there was plenty of ammunition for everyone to pick up. By that\ntime, I had a German luger at that time that I took and I wanted to carry it, but at that\ntime I turned it in to the command because what would I do for getting bullets for a\nGerman luger? It was easy for us to get bullets from Russian-type guns than to get for\nGermans. We used to get enough ammunition of theirs, but that was hard. Now, after the\nfirst battle line was over, our command ordered us to go back to position, only changing\nposition because we expected that this will not be the last battle. So all of these killed,\nincluding the Zundenfeur (ph), the officer, our command ordered to go ahead, to strip\ntheir uniforms off of them and just naked and covering with a blanket, put them back on a\nhorse and wagon and we took one of the farmers, send them to the city to turn in their\ncorpses and give them a note, \"Don't fight us, because that's the way you're going to see\nthe rest of you come back.\" It's true enough that we were there and the following day the\ncommander decided that we should be on guard again because they probably will send in\na second force. And they did. On the second force what they sent, that's why I could\nunderstand why they went to burn up the last bridge to us, but the first bridge to them.\nAnd the other two, we mined at this time, one at a time. They came with a light tank at\nthis time and they came, again, Germans and they had the police which they were a\nmakeup of Ukrainians and the other Russians and they started to do the same thing and\nwe again let them cross that second bridge before the explosion was made. The explosion\ngot at this time, caught that small task that they had. And it was done, you know, they\ncouldn't have maneuvered; they would have to have heavy equipment to pull it out,\nwhich they came days afterwards to try to pull it out because of fear that the partisans\nmay go ahead right now and re-build it. You know what I mean? They got espionage the\nsame way as we did, to know what we were up to. And again that was battle line number\ntwo. We were still waiting and a couple of days later they sent a bigger force again and\nagain at this time, we ensued battle and realizing the roar of the trucks that 1t came a big\nforce. Our command decided to retreat and we retreated to the forest. Then they came in\nwith a bigger force to the farmers at that time for the contingent what they had to get\nfrom them of the wheat, but at this time we could not control it. But the mere fact was\nthat in order for them to collect the taxed wheat or provisions from the farmers, no longer\ncould be gotten from these areas without a fight. So we achieved our purpose that we\nmade this fight. Before long a change in all of that had happened. The Germans decided\nto build, as they called, a self-defense team. And in each settlement, they were ordered to\njoin on doing that. They used to hang up a piece of rail or a bell and as soon as partisans\nwould show in that vicinity, the bell or the rail piece would start making noise on the\nring. It would carry from one settlement to the other, until it would come to the garrison.\nThen the police would have to come out, put some on ambush or come searching to catch\nthe partisans.",
        "A: Yeah. They did it for the Germans to alert them that partisans are out. And in the\nmeanwhile, they would send a force against us. On three occasions, luck was with me,\nthat I was struck on this type of ambushes. And either my number wasn't up or my\nalertness was good, that I was able to get off the wagon, because we used to use wagons\nto come there. And I shoved myself up, turned over on my belly, into the forest and three\ndays later I showed up in camp, on each of these occasions. I don't mean on that\nparticular day; on each of these occasions, when I came, I was looked upon like I\nreturned from death because they already had given up on me, because a number of us\nused to be killed. And the command decided that no longer could that be tolerated.\nOtherwise, we would have to leave the area. And leaving the area was not saying we'll\nmove on elsewhere. The elsewhere, if 1t works, it will work elsewhere the same way. Our\ncommand decided on teaching a lesson and we had to do it the German way. We took a\nfarm area, the settlement was called Lansovicha (ph) and we surrounded it one morning\nwith our troops. There were a few hundred people in participation. And the first thing, we\nwaited for somebody to come and hitting the bell. Somebody did come and as soon as he\nhit the bell, machine gun was fired and that man was dead and more people who started\nto run out of their houses, were dead. They realized the casualties and all of them began\nall of a sudden to be alert. We started a fire because their roofs were made out of straw\nand we had the special bullets, fire bullets, to start fire, on purposely to make a little\npanic. While a certain group of ours were taking charge of the livestock, everybody tried\nto drive their livestock out because they were afraid it will burn up, you know. So, while\nthey were, the farmers were driving out, our people were taking over, lining them up and\nthey were driven to the forest while our command decided to share this cattle among the\npoor farmers in the forest. That was left to be a lesson that any settlement that will\ncooperate with the Germans and will alert our moves, whatever partisans in the area, can\nexpect the same treatment as Lansovich (ph). And that, after that, they didn't remove it,\nfrom there on, after that time that 1t happened, the farmers in the area understood that\neither, if you listen and do for the Germans, you'll get killed from the partisans. And if\nyou listen the other way, you'll get killed from the Germans. So, therefore, they tried to\nplay a little bit of a different game. And it no longer was the success as the Germans\nanticipated it would. The reason that Peklansavichy (ph) was because from that\nsettlement, there were a number of guys serving in the police force in the Rachen. And\nwe had our contact man who our command could get all information needed, because we\nalso had local people who were working on our side and they were actually against the\nGermans and what they were doing. But, it had to be done in a hiding kind of way. The\nstory, after that what had happened with that battle, changed. And really, here, at one\ntime, we made almost like calling a massacre because quite a number of casualties. The\nfarmers would go out and start pleading, \"Don't burn, don't burn up my farm,\" and this\nand that and the other. And we knew the families that were there; the families of those\npolicemen serving in the Rachen were all killed. So, be that you want to call it savagery\nfor the sake of liberation, but we had to bring it down, that's what the command said in\norder to go on and act. However, we were more cautious. We started to drive-in other\nareas away, even to do our ammunition work, we did not go in the same format. We\nchanged; we had to go further away from base in order to keep on doing. For instance, to\ngive you an example, Zelva (ph) was the main station and we started operating, going bad\nthings around Zelva. We would start crossing the Yemen on the other side, which it was\nthe bigger forest. And certain changes in our operation was. However, all of that within a\nfew months brought a big German Army who wanted to get even now with the partisans,\nrealizing that. And at that particular time, the fighting ensued for almost a week. And we\nwere surrounded for quite a big perimeter all the way around and afterwards our fight\nwas not so much killing Germans as it was to work our way through a retreat, where we\ncould go to a retreat in smaller groups through the bigger forest. Which we did. And in\nweeks later, in slow motion, with fewer people, we came back to the area but in other\nparts of the forest. So, not to leave, we suffered a tremendous amount of casualties at that\nparticular time. And our reorganization was, I mean, the reorganization, speaking in the\npart of the Jewish partisans. On that particular march, I was near Captain Bulat (ph) and\nhe was the staff leader. And he started the anti-Semitism, talking continually to me, and\nno matter how much defending I tried to do of the Jewish, it still was calling the Jewish\nall at once, he started to call them cowards. I said, \"How can you call them cowards?\nLook at Balat. He kept all his guys, the Rachen boys, up in the front line. A few of them\ndied, got killed, and look how they held the Germans for a whole day in position, and the\nGermans could not come forward. Do you call that cowardness?\" I says, \"You and I, I\nwas in front with a machine gun and you were a few hundred yards in back of me when\nyou asked me to go into the settlement over there, to find out, to see if the German's are\nstill there. Did I back off?\" \"No,\" he says. \"You were good; you were a brave guy. I'm not\ntalking about you.\" I said, \"Then, why are you pluralizing it?\" And after the talk all the\ntime, the group of Atlas as we were to call them, as I have mentioned, the Dr. Atlas\ngroup, Lipsovich (ph) was the name of the commanding officer at the time, he come over\nto me, he says, \"Harold, we were retreating. We cannot go on with this here whole group\nbecause look at the anti-Semitism. Two Jewish girls were shot because they dropped their\ndiscs. They were having the discs for the automatic weapons and while running and\nretreating, they dropped the discs, they shot the Jewish girls. There was no way out others\ncould do.\" So, they pleaded with me; they said, \"Harold, please come with us.\" I says,\n\"No. I will not join you for one reason. I do not want to make Captain Balot right. I don't\nwant for him to be able to pluralize it. So, while all of you are going, I wish you luck and\nI hope to meet you when it's all over. The next day after the Altas group left, Captain\nBalot got me again. \"Harold, you remember our conversation? Look what happened to\nyour cowards.\" I says, \"Why do you confront me with them? I had nothing to do with\nthem.\" I says, \"What happened to them?\" He says, \"They all retreated.\" .",
        "A: The conversation ensued with all anti-Semitic flavor and he said, \"They will be pushed\nonce we go back to base.\" Within a couple of days later, we decided to return. So instead\nof going towards the forest, now we decided to return back to our bases. On our way\nback, we realized of how many settlements were burned by the Germans through the\nlocal area, and we realized was a big thing it will be right now for us to operate in these\nareas. And they decided to come back firstly, to where the Dr. Atlas group was usually\ntaking place, although they were right nearby and we ran up on them. No sooner we came\nthere, the order was everybody stays in place. I saw a friend of mine, Moses Agonik (ph),\nand he used to be a patrol guy who on the horse would always run forward for patrolling\nand finding out front line news. And I was a smoker at that time, and a heavy smoker. So\nbadly, we used to take leaves and crush the tobacco and roll it in newspaper to smoke. It's\nhard to relate to everybody whoever smokes what a horrendous feeling that gives you to\nsubstitute, but that's what we did. I see Moses over there; I says, \"Moe, can I get a\ncigarette from you?\" I stepped out of line. No sooner that I stepped out of line,\nBuresbulat (ph) is there and Buresbulat starts acting up, now he wants to shoot me. He\nwants to shoot me right on the place. Now, being I'm among my good friends of\ncommanders which I had Zeitsof (ph) who took me to the forest, Beshuti (ph), which it\nwas another one; Misha Dubokof (ph), and third one, and a few more came over. No,\nyou're not going to shoot him; you're not going to kill him. As they were my messiahs, in\na way of speech. And he didn't do it. \"Why did you step out of line?\" I says, \"I didn't step\nout; just one foot, to get a cigarette from him.\" \"I said and I ordered, no one steps out of\nline, and you did.\" Basically, I realized that 1t was no more, no less, but the anti-Semitism\nin here, that he continued talking with me about; that's what it was. But I was on the\nwatch at that time. Before long, they started to order, they wanted to shoot two more of\nthe Rachen girls, who they understand, dropped their discs and we had one guy who was\na Rachen guy, Benjamin Denbrovsky (ph); he used to be like the hang man. Any time\nsomebody had to be executed, Benjamin used to be the one to be called. So, now Bulot\nhas given him the assignment to take these two girls and he should go after them and\nshoot them. Well, an order is an order, so he went and the girls called and instead of him\nshooting them, he told them, \"We are running. I will not kill you. Stay with me.\" They\nall, at that particular time, ran. When they did not hear any shots, they followed. They\nkilled the girls, but Ben, they couldn't get hold of. He survived the war at , which it was a\ntrap for Jews mainly, and that's where he survived. Because for him, disobeying an order\nfor not shooting, he would have been killed. He survived the war about Bensky (ph) and I\nmet with him after the war. So, --.",
        "A: Well, at that particular time, as I am about to tell you, the system still did not work\nofficially under the Soviet bases, but it was just beginning to be. But since that was the\nbig fight and the big onslaught by the Germans going on over there and the casualties that\nwe suffered and when it was going on. Above all, what it got them worse is, they came\nand they found that what did the Atlas guys do, they were cooking a whole kitchen where\nthey had the chickens. And it was fine; you know what I mean? That was another part\nthat Jews liked chicken. That was another fallacy, you know, what I mean, for anti-\nSemitism. Why did I have chickens? Since I aforementioned that so many places were\nburned out, there were a lot of chickens flying around on the loose, with no one now to\ntake care of. So, they went away, cut the chickens, killed them and cooked them. So, he\ndid not even try. Before long, Heir Libshovens (ph), the commander gave an order to his\nmen. He saw what was going on and he saw the anti-Semitism. They surrendered to our\ngroup. His platoon was bigger at that time than the group we were, with machine guns\nand he went out talking to Bolot (ph). \"Are you going to call to order now and go back to\nstaff and re-hash all the things, or are you going to out right now? Remember one more\nmove and we are going to use our machine guns.\" And that's what attended for the day,\nthe stuff returned. And Dr. Atlas group no longer was commanded by Leibshovitz, but\nShuben became its commander and the group received a few more non-Jews. So, to make\na tone out of it, 1t looked like this: when things were bad, like they used to say in Polish, .\nWhen it's bad, go ahead to start getting on the Jews. We were the blame, the scapegoats\nfor everything, even at a time like this, in the forest. So maybe this is again one reason\nwhy not more Jews came to the forest. It was not because of anything else, because they\nhad no ways of how to make contacts with the forest. The guys in the forest were not\ninterested at that time to save Jews. They were interested just to fight a war against the\nGermans. But we did not have any helping hand to help Jews to survive. We survived\nbecause we were there fighting but not because somebody tried to help us survive. And,\nunfortunately, that's the case; that's the way it was. This was a bad to swallow at that\nparticular time because all of a sudden, the reorganization, I myself was sending from\none, and I asked at that time, Zatsov and Buchlet. They say, \"Harold, I cannot keep you\nunder my wing. You might as well go to join . That's the order that you got.\" So I was re-\nsettled to another place. The Abromov (ph) becomes my new home, sort of to be with\nthem. And that went on until a few months later, when the paratroopers joined us under\nthe auspices of the General Costenko (ph) or we used to call him, Capusten (ph). And I\njoined, I joined him, not because of my, I was assigned to join him. And maybe that was\nanother way of Abromov to get me out of, you know what I mean; not to be over here.\nAnd I and Polachek (ph), the other one who were assigned there, and at that time, I\nbecame platoon commander beforehand, but still and though, even my being the platoon\ncommander, he singled out me and Polachek, the two, to go to be with the paratroopers.\nAnd a new leaf in the history of the partisans had started at that particular time in our\narea.",
        "A: I beg your pardon. That was already 1943.\nEnd of Tape #7\nTape #8",
        "A: Because that was leading up to that attack that we had another attack by the Germans, to\nget even with us. That was, now we are talking of 1943, in the Spring.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: Yes, I was very much involved. As coming near Zotzof and Pescholey (ph) at the time,\nand Misha Dubokov knew of me, and I was the one selected to take the commerce from\nthe big massacre in the Rachen to which company, and we were pleading with the\ncommand, I and the same thing, Somek Burnstein (ph) that please, let us go and attack\nthe Rachen, less us go and attack the Rachen. But the command still did not want to\nlisten to us before the massacre happened. However after the massacre in the Rachen\nhappened, and from that massacre to the forest, I would . The people who were in the\nfamily camps to those who were assigned in the various command posts, in companies, I\nwould say that may be 100 to 120 people were saved of a population in the ghetto, for at\nleast seven or eight hundred. That's how victorious the Germans were of killing the Jews.\nThey did not take them anymore to the big dig that they had in the forest, but rather in the\nholes that were left from the bombs in the middle, the center of town, that's where they\nkilled them out. And some of them they even killed in the ghetto and burned afterwards\nthe whole ghetto with them. So those of them who weren't hiding, had little chance to\nsurvive. And that is, perhaps, was why the number of us are living. Now, ...",
        "A: Let's see. That would have to probably be, when was it in your time, 1943, the last\nmassacre, or '42?",
        "A: That's what I thought it was, '42. We are talking about now, when we attacked the\nRachen was at the tail end of summer. Or mid-summer of 1942. So, at that particular time\nwith having so many more people, survivors of the Rachen, everybody sort of was\nlooking for a little vengeance on the police, a little vengeance on the Germans for the\nmassacre that they carried out. And command was knowing that we can get a lot of\ntrophies in ammunition and everything like that, because they will not fight, no more than\nthey didn't fight as before in other ambushes. And they mustered up the force in all the\nareas and all the partisans were divide in about four groups to make it so that we gave\nthem only one area from where to escape and all the other areas that they tried to escape,\nthey had to fall into our fire. I was assigned at that time to a group with Zitsof (ph) which\nI was with him together. We both were having, he was having a machine gun and I was\nhaving a machine gun and while he had the machine gun, he was commanding also his\nflock. In other words, of his line, whatever he had to do. We decided to attack about\ndawn, while it was still dark, about maybe at the hours between 5 and 6 in the morning.\nOur forces began to move in the area at night, so really our forces did not have time to\nrest, but in small groups. You could not move about five, six hundred partisans all to\ncome in at one time. So everybody was using a different direction and it took them the\nnight hours to come to be in place.",
        "A: On foot. Some of them were on horses. The ones who were searching areas and contact\nman with him, but all the troops were on foot. No other way. And the contact men only\nwere on horses so that they could be able to speed up to tell from the command, you\nknow, we did not have no radios or anything like that at that time. So, we started\nmustering the forces at night because by night, the movement could be not so visible as to\nalert the garrison that something is going on. We decided there has to be attack early in\nthe morning. The signal was a rocket that I would shoot in the air from my horse. And\nonce the rocket was shoot, fire starts and with the words of \"Hurrah,\" the Russian way,\nour men begin. The machine guns that were meant near the police first, we shot them out\nimmediately because we made the forest, by the time they realized it was an attack, and\nto muster the police who were asleep, and the Germans, we already were near the\nbuildings, surrendered and hand grenades began flopping from everywhere. So the\nGermans and the police did not ensue in a fight for more than about an hour in all, put\ntogether. And all they were doing is looking for places where to run. We collected quite a\nnumber of them prisoners of war and the prisoners were tied, their hands in the back and\nwere immediately sent to the forest, and which, later on, they would stand trial and they\nwere convicted, in other words to die. And they were one by one shot in the presence of\nthe partisans. And, at that particular time, we were very overwhelmed of how little an\neffort it was to knock the garrison out, because really there looks like did not have chance\nenough to build a position. However, I must make a point here; after it was all over and\nthe garrison retreated back, that's when around this here garrison where the police force\nwas staying, they built a wall with bunkers that if we were to have this here kind of\nbuilding before, we would never be able to succeed to attack. We made use of the time,\nsince the Rachen was a slaughter house, that the slaughter house became busy,\nslaughtering meat, and it was salted down into wooden barrels and sent to the forest by a\ncontingency of partisans that we had who were capable of making salami and so on, and\nthey were salted down as to food and scattered around the various parts of the forest,\nwhich only a few people knew. So, in the event we should have been surrounded and not\nbe able to go out, that we should be able to have supplies for where to survive. My good\nfriend, Barnovsky, (ph) was leading on, we told of this year, doing, he was a butcher by\ntrade and he knew the art of making the salami and all of that do. So, he was leading and\nit became a very busy place, that slaughter house. To tell you, we kept it for almost three\nmonths and until the Germans decided to make an onslaught and come back to return to\ntheir bases. With Zidsov (ph) as I went into a house, I came into a Gentile person who\nknew even my grandparents. And he touched me badly, the way he said it in Russian, \" ,\"\nwhich translated into English, means, \"Are you still alive?\" And it rubbed me the wrong\nway. Had I not had Commander Zitsov with me, I would have ended him right there. But\nbeing with my Commander Zitsov with me, I pretended that I didn't take it, instead of\nhim showing the joy that I am alive, he asked me, \"Are you still alive?\" So, and that\nrubbed me in the wrong way and he ordered us, he ordered for him and his wife to make\nbreakfast for us and a few more from the command came into the same house. And even\nthough we had to drink and to eat, but these few words never left me. And I had a hard\ntime, sort of, forgetting about it, that even after I left all of my family and lost them over\nhere, that that man would have the audacity to ask me, one person who remained alive, in\nthese words, with his cruel words: \"Are you still alive?\" And he thought that that was a\nway of greeting me. In other words, that he sort of jokingly thought. I did not make any\nmention in front of my commander, but my anger was burning in me, coming back in the\nplaces where I did not even know which of the holes my family is buried, you know.\nBecause they threw lime afterwards on it and it was brought to burial, the area, after the\nwar when the partisans returned to the Rachen. It was a big piece of news for the whole\narea, because the respect date. And what we invited upon ourselves, after that forest, after\nthat Rachen occupation and what we do. That the Germans had to bring a tremendous\nforce in surrendering all the forest, extending maybe in diameter, maybe 30 to 40 miles.\nWhich, again, for the Soviet Union, it served a good purpose. When they have to take in\none area to use so much military to do a big job like that, the front line is . That's when\nthe Soviets were winning. But, it was a lot of casualties on our part and that Fall, when\nthey made, because we were so sure of ourselves that we became too cocky. We used to\ntravel by day, coming to the Rachen; going here and doing there. We thought there is no\nforest that it can stop us. And this is the time that we relaxed a little bit too much and the\ncasualties happened. So then we heard the forest coming in, we started on the edge of the\nforest from all places to put up, at that time, a defense. And we didn't wait for them to\nattack us, we started to attack them, realizing the kind of forest and the kind of fighting\nthat no longer were we dealing with the police, the local alone, but at this time we were\ndealing with a trained Army. So, our command immediately recognized the situation and\nthey broke through an area in a few places to make it, and we were ordered to retreat. We\nretreated until the forest almost around Vilda (ph). It was very, a traumatic move at that\ntime for us, that all of a sudden, we had to, I would say in miles, I would say we must\nhave retreated about 150 yards from our base. The good part of a base was that we knew\nthe names of the settlements. We knew which way it leads. And then you come in a\nstrange place altogether, it was hard to go ahead to carry out any of the type of work that\nthey did over there. So it was a set back port partisans. The good news however was that\nafter that, we saw the paratroopers come in to the area. So, 1943, about mid, we decided\nto organize a new action.",
        "A: At the battle of the Rachen, Dr. Atlas was involved. And he retreated away from the\nRachen quickly. Not with his troops, because he had some medical missions that he had\nto attend to at that particular time. While he was the commander, he still used to attend to\ncertain patients, which was farmers. His good rule, what he did to the farmers helped us\nwith leads of informers that we could get. And because they wanted Dr. Atlas to continue\nwith the work, we prospered with it. So, yes; he was in the battle. He originally was\nleading his platoon over there to the Rachen, but he after it was over, the fight was over,\nhe had to retreat. His men remained there. Now, for instance, we knew a few casualties of\nthe Rachen boys who did lose their life, like I mentioned before. Benjamin Dumbrovsky,\nhe lost his brother at that particular time. But all the casualties we had were due to\nbravery; they were really fighting and they really wanted to see and show the police over\nthere that somebody has got to be accountable for the way they did in that massacre\nagainst the Jews so well.",
        "A: The platoon that he was leading was, I would say, about 80 percent of the Jewish people\nwho came from the Rachen and they came after the massacre of the Rachen. That's why\nthey were so eager in the fight of to go back and sort of, vengeance was a good driving\nforce in them, to do what they were doing at the present time. So, it was not idealogy in\npart, all the way, that they were trying to fight for the Soviets, but a lot of times it was\nvengeance against those who did so cruel to our families there. So his platoon remained\nuntil afterwards when the General's staff ordered everybody to retreat. Because after the\nfirst day, or the second day, we used to go back by day to the forests and by night come\nand still do that. We did not want to get caught in the big forest that the Germans should\ngo ahead. So we used to have, more or less, platoons, a platoon maybe would stand guard\nand about on the lookout over there. But the whole Army was where we were, about five\nor six hundred partisans, were sent back to their bases. Dr. Atlas was also a DP like I was\nmyself. I knew him not like I knew, for instance, the other doctors; no.",
        "A: Yes. It's worth mentioning here, about Dr. Atlas's past. He was a displaced person, like I.\nHe was someplace from Poland. And that man practiced medicine all the time and with\nthe German onslaught, the way it happened, he decided to be treating patience on the\noutside. So he, instead of remaining in the ghetto, was away from the ghetto and he used\nto, sort of, be the doctor of the farmers. And they did not disclose him from the Germans,\nto the Germans, rather. With the onslaught and organization of partisans, as soon as he\nheard about partisans in the area, he came voluntarily and joined but he still maintained a\ngood relationship with the farming area over there and they became very useful to the\npartisans, right now for the information. He was a man about my height, slimmer than\nme, I mean you know, I wasn't as fat as Iam now, but a little slimmer. And he had one\nthing, you could see fire in this man, talking to his guys all the time about vengeance and\nfight. \"When you going to fight, fight to the end. Fight to win.\" And he was a good\nleading commander. We had a lot more of, in Buloks. Bulok was a local commander who\nhad mostly Gentiles, or the other Russians, not so much of the Soviets, true Soviets, who\nremained in the area that didn't go into the prisoners of war. But he organized his group\nmostly from his settlement area and around there. So the people, as I say, his group, they\nall used to ride more, a lot on horses. So, they would come because they had their own\nfarms and so on. So a lot of them used to have to man the farms, and at night, whatever\nthe partisans needs was today, they would be working on that front line, too. But the\nunfortunate situation happens, Dr. Atlas, in one of the big ambushes, which it was\nfollowing after the liberation of the Rachen, that's when Dr. Atlas is killed in battle. So, I\nmean, he didn't die just a normal death. He was killed while fighting, being a fighter and\ncommanding. That's when the takes over. That man, I just mentioned, misfortunately\nmeets his death in , in Poland, while on his way escaping the Soviet Union, and while on\nthe way in a kubutz (ph) which it was illegal immigration to go to Israel. And being\noutside on patrol, a Polak shot and killed him. As you've heard perhaps or not, that in and\nin other parts of Poland, after 1945, when the war as over, and the Jews were running\nfrom the camps or from hiding, they still were not ready to give away what they robbed\nfrom the Jews, so they had one way of doing it: kill them. And therefore, we know later\non, what went on in Poland. So, a lot of these guys like , met their death after liberation.\nAnd it was a big hurt to feel that a guy was patriotic all the way and that that was the way\nfor him to die. So, why almost after three years in the forest, or two and a half years,\nrather, and being in battle and to come out all right. In the forest he only lost his sister.\nHis brothers, the other two brothers that survived, to the best of my knowledge, are in\nIsrael.",
        "A: Yep.",
        "A: Well, I can tell you first about the family camps, rather than getting into this subject,\nbecause that's a more lengthy subject to talk about. I did not mention at great length, that\nin the forests there were also family camps. However, let us make clear about it. When I\nuse that word, family camps, I only mean others an expression. It was not a camp of\npeople with families or elderly, that they were supervised by others. It's just that they\nwere, sort of, not elected to be able to be among the fighting force. And therefore, when\nwe came to the forests, escaping from the massacres, there was only one thing for them to\ndo, and that was to be in the forest. So, a lot of them, a majority of them who were\ncapable, joined one company or the other and they were there. And those who couldn't,\nfor instance, had the lot left to them to be there. Every time the Germans attacked the\nforest, the ambush or otherwise, the big forest or small forest, the family camps were the\nfirst prey that they attacked. And at times, it was, they were going home, sort of, with\nvictory, thinking that they killed partisans while they actually, the one that they killed\nwas the ones in the family camp. Because as soon as the shooting was started, not too far\nwhere we were in our camps, so we would exactly, at that particular time join and attack\nthem instead of. And from the family camps, they had an easy prey. All they could throw\nis a few hand grenades, open up a machine gun and boom, then they found them. So,\nthose who were living in hiding survived the massacre, or the onslaught. Those who were\nnot living in hide outs, but they just lived in the open, you know. They were first prey.\nSo, the other part was, while we had so many fighting groups, really, no one cared to\nprovide the family camps with provisions, even food or clothing. However, some of them\nhad relatives, brothers or other ones, in the fighting camps, which they would care to\nbring something. But, 1t was never an organized effort by the partisans, in the area that I\nwas in. I don't know what it was in other forests; maybe in other forests it was different.\nBut, I believe that we would have heard about it and know about it. They were an open\nprey. They escaped. At types, they used to have problems with the partisans. The\npartisans, especially the women, and there were younger girls; the partisans, in most\ncases the Gentiles, would come and rape them, attack them in this way. So they were\nopen prey to all kinds of enemies: our local enemies, the partisans which they couldn't\nprotect themselves from, and against the Germans and the police when they would attack\nand they would normally, you know what I mean, pick their spots as of their probably\nspies them where they were located and that's what it would be.",
        "A: The Jewish guys used to help one way or the other, the family camp. But, that was, again,\na not official way, it was an unofficial way. That we would sometimes drop some food\nover there. But we were starting to stop over there to visit and usually we would come\nwith some food leaving them. But it was not a case that a command told us, \"Hey, why\ndidn't you deliver some potatoes from wherever you can, or something else, to the family\ncamp?\" The family camps were strictly left on their own and if we were to have the\nfigures at hand and starting to make justification or comparisons, we would find that the\nbiggest amount of casualties as per amount coming to the forest, was from the family\ncamps.",
        "A: That was the life, at that time. It was war and we were in that war. It did not matter\nperimeter, where the front line is. To us, the front line was everywhere, because we\nnever, we used to catch here and there spies, would come running in the forest that the\nGermans sent. They used to send in ex-POWs, you know what I mean, which they sent\nin. We found them with maps and insignia on them. And of course, when we found them,\nthey met death, you know what I mean? But, it was officially, you know. The company\nwould come out and it would be read the order, who and what it was discovered and\ntherefore, they were executed. But, 1t was in a military kind of a way. So, to tell you, the\nforests were full of all kind of problems, while they served of a lot of help, to help Jews\nsurvive. But, it did not happen as a means for Jewish survival. It happened because the\nway it happened to be that it served as the base for survival. But they were not with open\narms, let us get Jews in. Jews were not taken in so easily, like I told you when I was,\nbefore when I was coming in there. What do you think? We have ammunition for them?\nThat was not the case. The case is, if you're out to help or to save, that's the salvation. But\nif not, that's the case we don't have, how are we going to take in more? And again, when\nwe were talking about attacking the Rachen, before the massacre, that was our main\ncourse; that was to come in to tell them that a young people will join us. But they did not\nwant to hear but we will take the Rachen after the massacre, where we could have saved\nso much more lives.",
        "A: If there was one episode, I don't know which way to place it. I was on a mission at one\ntime to save one Jewish girl from the Rachen, who a policeman at the massacre, he looks\nlike he was in love with her and she was in love with him, save her and took upon\nhimself to take him to his farm, where his parents were, and they kept her there. And all\nof a sudden, we got word in the forest that Sonia no longer can stay. She became the wife\nlater of who I have mentioned before, who was a commander. But sent me for one reason\nor another only that I came telling her, there's a young girl, good looking, and if you want\nme to bring her here, you'll have a girl. So, it was sort of like you cannot say that the\ninterest of the commander to permit me to go on that mission to save her was of humane?\nNo, it wasn't of humane. It was, the was a nice man and he layer winds up being with her\nafter the war was over. But he, it was just a matter of exchange, sort of; you know what I\nmean\u2019? Who cares? And I risked my life, although I wasn't a native from that city. But I\nwas there, again, because the Dr. Atlas group probably had the same thing and the\nquestion would always be, how come they didn't? I did it for one basic reason. The news\ncame to us through a contact and I went to and told him. And he says, \"Would you want\nto go to bring her?\" I says, \"Yes. She's a nice woman.\" And I brought her. But it was a\nbig risk for me, a one-man operation, to go to organize it, through our contact man.\nWhich I did through the prior knowledge of the staff. The staff would never have\npermitted me to do a thing like that. You know. The staff would have said to me, \"Sure,\nshe wants to come? Meet her halfway. Meet her at the edge of some settlement from the\nforest and if she comes there, you'll take her. But I risked and I had to make them believe\nthat I'm here with a little Army to surrender. And she was dressed like a little farm girl\nand she came out over there and when we meet, I sort of started to pretend that there 1s\nthe other guys, all came with me. And until I was in the forest, she herself thought that\nwhat I'm talking is really something. And the whole night it took me to walk until in the\nmorning until I brought her. So, is that an important case? Was the onslaught in the\nRachen when I was in full and important case? Was when we attacked? Again, when I\nwas next to the Howitzer and we were doing. And it was a big fight there. That's an\nimportant part for me to tell about that fight because the Jewish heroes were there.\nEnd of Tape #8\nConclusion of interview.\n"
