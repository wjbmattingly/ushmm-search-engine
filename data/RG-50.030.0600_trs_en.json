        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Eleanor\nRolfe conducted by Agnisha (ph) McClure on October 17th, 2010 at the Kindertransport\nAssociation conference in Arlington, Virginia. Hello. It's very nice to meet you, and to\nhave you here with us. Thank you. Could you please say your name yourself?",
        "Answer: Eleanor Rolfe.",
        "Q: Could you please tell us when were you born and where?",
        "A: January 31st, 1930 in Hamburg, Germany.",
        "Q: Can you tell me what are your first recollections of your family life in Hamburg,\nGermany?",
        "A: Surprisingly, I can remember back to when I was three years old, which always\namazes my brother. I remember that in my bedroom, they put a rug with flowers in the\nmiddle and a design around the edge. And I wouldn't let anybody walk on the flowers.\nAnd I would go around the corner to my bed. And that's my first memory of my room.\nBut I then I did remember my daughter went to Germany with me in '74, I think. And I\nwe went to where I lived, my house and but it wasn't until was that when we went into\nthe house? I don't remember. We went back in 2001, the spring before 9/11. And I was\ninvited by the City of Hamburg. And my husband said for my daughter to come with me\nbecause she would remember this and pass it onto her children. So it was a wonderful\ntrip. And I had explained how my house, my apartment was laid out. And I\nhad a veranda in front of my room. And we went and knocked on the door or we were\nstanding in front of the place and people said can we help you? And it was an American\nmarried to a German. And I told him that this was the house where I was born. And so\nthey invited us in. And it was really interesting because she said to me, Mom, this is\nexactly the way you described it. So I could we jump ahead?",
        "Q: I would like to maybe ask you also about your family. You said you had a brother.\nWas it an older brother or younger brother?",
        "A: Yes, my brother is three years older. And we were completely assimilated in\nGermany. My father had been in the German army, and had all sorts of medals. He was\ninjured in the first World War. And we had a Christmas tree. I didn't really know I was\nJewish. I went to public school until quite late, then I had to change schools.",
        "Q: What language did you speak at home, was this German?",
        "A: German, yes.",
        "Q: Did you have any Jewish friends or just German friends?",
        "A: Of course I had my grandmother and grandfather and my uncle who had was\nsomewhat disabled. He had the flu in 1918 and stopped his mental development so he\nwas though he was an adult, he was approximately the age of twelve or thirteen. We\nplayed a lot of games he taught me games and things. My grandparents lived quite a\nwalking distance. And there was another German family living near us and, yes, I was\nfriends with them. I can't really recollect a lot of friends, I guess they didn't stay in my\nmemory.",
        "Q: Would you say that your family was a religious family?",
        "A: No, my mother came from an orthodox, very orthodox home. And she rebelled\nagainst it because she said that they were not allowed to do anything on the Sabbath, and\nher father would walk outside and get around the corner and light a cigar. So although\nthey had a maid, I guess, who was allowed to turn the light on but she so she married my\ndad. My dad came there was a lot of money in the family, but my father was not raised\nJewish, although both his parents were. His father died when he was three. And he was\na playboy.",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "A: And he was he went to law school and was an attorney. And as I remember what my\nmother said, her father who was orthodox really stepped in between that and didn't want\nto marry her to marry my dad. And so she was sent to England for a year and told if you\nstill want to marry him when you come back after a year, it's okay. So she did that. And\nmy parents kept everything. I have papers and papers and papers. I have all of their\nletters.",
        "Q: Really. That's very valuable. We are I'm sure going to talk about that in a little bit\ntoo.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You mentioned that your brother was three years older than you were. What's his\nname?",
        "A: His name was Osfeld Eric Stark (ph). My mother specifically, she was always\nworried about the situation. But probably because of her background because she was\northodox. My father felt it was a German. And my mother gave us each international\nnames. Eleanor is good in any language and Eric also. So but in Germany my brother\nwas called Osfeld (ph). And so he changed it, of course, to Eric Osfeld.",
        "Q: Were you very close with your brother?",
        "A: Quite.",
        "Q: Did you play a lot together, did you go to the same school?",
        "A: I'm not sure. I was eight when I went on the Kindertransport, but I was about five, I\nthink, five or six when my brother was sent to boarding school in England. And my\nbrother was very precocious and very intelligent, and he was constantly listening to what\nwe then called the wireless, and so it was could you go up and get that postcard? So they\nsent him to boarding school in England by a German teacher at Bunscord (ph) you\nprobably heard that before.",
        "Q: [have to say that I'm hearing that for the first time right now. Could you explain\nwhat it 1s?",
        "A: It was a boarding school for German Jewish children. And it was headed up by a\nwoman and something I don't remember the name, but I think I have it written. We\ncalled her Tatta Ana (ph). And by the time well, a lot of the children from wealthy\nfamilies were sent there, especially the boys.",
        "Q: So you mentioned that your family was quite affluent, right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was it also the case with your parents?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was your father, I believe you mentioned, was a lawyer?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And your mother, did she also work?",
        "A: No, she was a housewife although we had lots of maids. So she didn't really do\nanything. And remember that in 1937, my father bought a car, Mercedes Benz. And I\nwas told later by one of my cousins that Dad was the only one our family was the only\none who owned a car in the '30s. I remember that when my father bought this car, it was\ngreen. I have a picture of it at home. My mother immediately had to have a driving suit\nmade to match the car. Things I remember.\nI lived a very typical European life that was certainly totally opposite of what my life\nwith my children was, but it was my parents would send me to kindaponceons (ph) on\nholidays.",
        "Q: What are those?",
        "A: Those were ponceon (ph) is like a camp.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: Children's camp and it was I remember I was in Switzerland over the new year. My\nparents entertained a lot. And I was in Belgium in the summers. And I was pretty little,\nbut it was organized, you know. And I don't ever remember even sitting on my father's\nlap. It was very distant relationship.",
        "Q: Were you also distant with your mother or just with your father?",
        "A: Mostly with my father, yeah. But I don't remember long conversations with my\nmother. It just wasn't the thing to do in those days.",
        "Q: I can assume that. Did you play with her at all?",
        "A: I don't remember playing with her, no. I played with my uncle who lived with my\ngrandparents and he taught me games and dominoes and stuff like that. I remember that.\nHe was the only grown up that ever paid attention to me.",
        "Q: Was that the uncle you mentioned that was sick with the flu?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Was that the uncle you mentioned before that was sick with the flu as a young boy?",
        "A: Yes, he had the flu in 1918. And he was fine, but he was disabled. I mean, he had a\nlittle bit of a lame arm and his mind stopped developing, but he was lovely, lovely\nperson, very lovable. And I think he enjoyed being with me. I remember on Christmas\nwe even had a Christmas tree fire once because in those days, there were candles on\nthem. I don't know how they managed that.",
        "Q: They were real, right?",
        "A: They were real candles, and they hung those little rings on the tree, that chocolate\ncandy with the little white dots, nonpareils. Yes.",
        "Q: I'm trying to imagine how it looks. Chocolate candy with the little white dots, like\nsugar?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Confectionary sugar on top of them.",
        "A: In this country they are nonpareils and they're dark chocolate with sugary white little\nthings. And they were rings, and they were hung on the tree along with other things.\nAnd I remember putting our shoes at Christmastime or before Christmas.\nWe also had a Menorah, I think, that was passed down. And I don't remember it in my\nhome in Germany, but we had a big, beautiful, silver Menorah that I first really\nexperienced when we came to the United States. And I know that what I got back\ntogether with my parents. You wanted to know what else did you want to know about\nGermany?",
        "Q: I wanted to also ask you're obviously saying that you were living in the multi\nreligious environment, right, both the Christmas tree and a menorah?",
        "A: I don't remember the Menorah in my German house.",
        "Q: Not in the German house, but that was here in the states, right?",
        "A: Yeah. And I think the Menorah was with my grandparents.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: It was handed down from my mother's family.",
        "Q: Isee. Did you ever do you recall going to the synagogue or performing any",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you know any Jewish prayers?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: How about the atmosphere in the City of Hamburg, do you remember what it was\nbefore the outbreak of the war?",
        "A: It was before although my mother was very aware, she told me later, she was very\nfrightened, but in 19 I believe '36 or '37 is when they sent my brother away, but I was\nstill there. And I had a pretty normal life. I remember may mother taking me to some\ntailor to have my clothes made. And I know that what you looked like was terribly\nimportant.",
        "Q: Certainly.",
        "A: Very German. I do remember having very close to the end when I was sent away, I\nhad to change schools. I believe that because my father was an attorney and some kind\nof a municipal judge, and I do believe that",
        "Q: There is a little gnat here.",
        "A: God, I can't get rid of it. Okay. That's why he he always said this is happening to all\nof those Jews, not us.",
        "Q: I see, so he didn't believe that the growing tension was going to have any effect",
        "A: On him.",
        "Q: on your family?",
        "A: No. No. I possibly deep in his heart, he was might have been thinking fooling\nhimself, but he was so much a German and never really considered himself Jewish. And\nI believe his parents were also assimilated. He came from a very wealthy family. I know\nvery little about his family. I believe that originally the family came from Holland\nbecause the name Stork is quite Dutch. But I remember visiting his mother very rarely.\nShe was very stiff, pompous woman. I never my mother's parents were very loving, but\nI don't really know much about his parents. He was my my Grandfather Stork died\nwhen Dad was three years old right around the turn of the century. My father was born in\n1897. And I had many, many years it never dawned on me that I thought he had a heart\nattack and died.",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: Not until many, many years later, my aunt that I visited in Boston told me oh, no,\nyour grandfather committed suicide. He had some financial set backs.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And I was so relieved because one of my sons very much looks like my family. My\nother son is very much like his dad's family. And Brian always said I'm fine. I don't\nneed the checkups and stuff. And I said you have to get a checkup.",
        "Q: Because of the heart issue, right?",
        "A: Because I thought my grandfather died of a heart attack. And my father had his first\nheart attack when he was in his 50s. And so I was and Brian finally had his wife made\nhim have a checkup. And he wrote to me he lived in different places. He's been part of\ncorporate America. And he wrote to me and said or he called me and he said mom, my\nheart's perfect. So and then of course my aunt told me, oh, no, your grandfather\ncommitted suicide. Best news I ever had.",
        "Q: That's unusual.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But I guess I can see your point personally.",
        "A: Well, yeah, when my father was three years old, he was a child late in life. He was\npretty much raised by an older brother who was already 20 when",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: when Dad was a little boy.",
        "Q: Isee. You mentioned that you were going to school already in Germany. You said\nthat you left at the age of 8, right, so you must have started really early.",
        "A: Well, yes, I was in school in Germany, and it was certainly not a Jewish school. Very\nnot long before I was sent away. I had to change schools. And I believe it was very\nscary in those times. But until then it didn't really affect me. My mother, of course, but\nshe never would have told me.",
        "Q: She + already afraid of what you are saying, right?",
        "A: Yes, about the precarious situation we were in Germany. And as I have studied\nhistory and learned, I was appalled at how my father could have kept us there. He could\nhave left.\nMy mother had a huge family and they all left in early '30s, up to '37 and they settled in\nAmsterdam. They were in the tobacco business, and continued their business in\nAmsterdam. And my mother wanted to leave, but my father in retrospect, I understand,\nthat my father knew that he would have to start life all over again if he left Germany\nbecause he was an attorney and a judge in Germany, and German law is based on Roman\nlaw. And",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: if he went to England or the United States, he could not practice law.",
        "Q: That's right. He would have to start pretty much from the beginning.",
        "A: And he was a very arrogant man. Like I said, this is happening to all of the other\nJews, not me. SoI I don't remember doing much with my parents except for when my\nfather bought a car, we used to on Sundays, go out into the suburbs, I guess, and I\nremember buying ice on a stick that was, you know, it was quite new.",
        "Q: Popsicles.",
        "A: In the late '30s.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And, yeah. But I, now looking back, my father lived such an affluent life. But most\npeople in Germany didn't have cars in the '30s.",
        "Q: Certainly not that was a very poor time, the recession, right?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, it was inflation. And my father did tell me that during he went to\nHeidelberg to college and he told he told of times when they had to take boxes of money\nto the store, you know, because of the inflation.",
        "Q: Right. I see because you had to have so much money",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: to have acertain amount to pay. I see. Right.",
        "A: I don't believe he ever really suffered from it because he had lots of money.",
        "Q: So your father never really thought that the situation was going to be dangerous",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: for him or his family?",
        "A: He would not believe it. My parents I have at home albums, many of them of my\nparents' trips. They went mountain climbing and they went to Pompeii for a wedding\ntrip. And my father was an amateur photographer. And he had photographs of\neverything. They went on many, many trips; never with children.",
        "Q: I see. Could you please tell me who made the decision, and how did it happen that\nyou actually were a part of the Kindertransport?",
        "A: Yes, my father was in court on the morning of the Kristanoff. And he was arrested\nright in court. I mean, he was taken. His original law partner who was also a good friend\nwas aman by the name of Dr. Sieveking who, of course, that's the first thing my mother\ncalled when she found out Dad was gone. And he went there's a concentration camp\nright near Hamburgh which is called Neuengamme, and I understand that my that Dr.\nSieveking traced back to where my father was, went to Neuengamme, and told him you\ncan't have this man. Brought him home. I remember my father coming home and who\nwas he was always this beautifully dressed, clean cut gorgeous man and he came back\nhome. His head was shaved and he was ghast looked horrible. He was only in a camp\nfor a short while. And Dr. Sieveking came over the Nazis, the same time my father was\narrested and taken, my mother, of course, didn't know for quite a while what happened to\nhim, but the SS troops came into our home and searched everything and pushed us\naround. It was just me and my mother by that time. I remember I think it was probably\nquite early that we could no longer have maids or nannies so",
        "Q: _ +",
        "A: I remember how my mother cried when Kata (ph) was this nanny, I guess, who was\nalways with us. And then we had a cook and they all had to leave. And my mother didn't\nlearn how to cook until she came over to the United States. But so we were alone, my\nmother and I were alone. My brother had already been sent to England. And then Dr.\nSieveking came back. It was very frightening when the Nazis went through our\napartment, and messed around, you know, pushed us around. But then Dr. Sieveking\nbrought my dad back and oh, my, he looked terrible. And he took over, Dr. Sieveking, he\nsaid Eleanor is going on the Kindertransport. He took care of the whole thing. And he\nafter I was gone, I he arranged for my parents to go to Amsterdam. He even had the car\ntransported to Amsterdam because he knew my father could sell it for money. By the\nway, he was not Jewish. Dr. Sieveking, who he was the son of a former mayor of\nHamburgh and apparently my father and he was very close, law partners.",
        "Q: Would you spell his name with an \"S\"",
        "A: Sieveking is a \"Z\"",
        "Q: \"7\"",
        "A: I think. Sieveking. I have papers at home, yeah. And there's a Sieveking Platz in\nHamburg, very famous people. And so anyway he got me on the Kindertransport. He\ntold my mother exactly what to put in the suitcase and a little one. And",
        "Q: What was in your suitcase, do you remember that?",
        "A: Would you believe a muff. I remember my parents my mother always had little\ncoats and hats made with a matching muff. Why they sent a muff I don't know.",
        "Q: Was it in winter?",
        "A: Yes, it was. And it was November, you know. I think I left I was told that I left on\nthe first Kindertransport from Hamburgh.",
        "Q: So it probably was",
        "A: Very early December.",
        "Q: Right. Early December. In '38, right?",
        "A: Yeah. And I as I remember, there were warm clothes and but I don't remember a\nwhole lot. I think there was a doll, but I could have just been imagining that. It was the\nwhole trip was kind of vague. I know I remember it wasn't so horrendous for me\nbecause I was used to being sent places. For holidays, they would put me on a train or\nsomething like that with a nanny. And I went places so_ horrible life, really when you\nthink back on it. But so it was I remember being with all of these children, and I\nremember when we went it could have been through Holland, before we crossed the\nchannel and the train, all of a sudden, opened the windows and people reached in and\ngave us oranges and things.",
        "Q: In Holland, right, after you crossed the border?",
        "A: Yeah. And I remember that very clearly, and everybody was joyous.",
        "Q: Were you, too?",
        "A: Yeah. Like I say, I was used to being sent away for holidays and things. I, at one\ntime, it came back to me in memory. My parents lived a very adult life. And at one time\nI was sent to a summer camp where we were abused and I had to sit on a potty until I had\na BM no matter what and oh, it was horrible. And I apparently would talk to my mother\non the phone or I I must have been five years old or something. But anyway somehow\nand they didn't believe me. They didn't, you know, they never really believed me until all\nof a sudden all the parents came, and the camp was closed.",
        "Q: Because of the abuse, right?",
        "A: Yes, because I was not the only one apparently, you know. And finally they got, oh, I\nremember that was so horrible. But never really having holidays with your parents. I\nremember going to Belgium on a beach where they had the little houses, you know,\ncanvass little things, and I was always there with nannies.",
        "Q: With nannies. And who walked you to the train station?",
        "A: I don't know how I got there; probably with the car, I don't know.",
        "Q: Was were your parents there or your uncle?",
        "A: I think Dr. Sieveking was there. I don't remember my dad, but my mother, my\nmother.",
        "Q: What about the uncle that you were so close with?",
        "A: No, he was sent to Holland. My mother and her siblings had promised to my\ngrandparents that they will always take care of Walter. And my grandmother died in '37,\nmy mother's mother. And my grandfather died about six months later of a broken heart\nkind of. He just couldn't make it alone. And so which was very good because he died\nbefore that but so it was when my grandparents were so sick and passed on that my\nUncle Walter was sent to Holland.",
        "Q: So Uncle Walter, that was your brother your mother's brother?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: And very interesting story, but I won't even go into it. There's a book written about\nhim because he was murdered by a famous Dutch playwright.",
        "Q: During the war or after the war?",
        "A: During the war.",
        "Q: What was the name of the playwright?",
        "A: Avery famous man. Many lawsuits and I've been in Holland, though they found me.\nOh, Von Von it will come to me.",
        "Q: Okay. We can come back to that later. I can ask you that question later.",
        "A: But anyway I remember only the oranges that were given to us through the windows.",
        "Q: Do you remember crossing the border at all? Do you remember Germans, the\nGerman border patrol?",
        "A: No, personally not. I could say that I do, but I have seen movies and things of it, but I\ndon't remember. Maybe I fell asleep. I don't know. I don't remember being frightened\nuntil we got to I believe it was London. And I remember standing 1n the railway station\nthere where the train was going and on the deck, I guess they call it. And people were\nstanding there and just taking kids, you know. And an elderly couple I was very small\nfor my age. I was eight years old. And an elderly couple took me, took me home with\nthem. And I came from great affluence and these were people that were very nice and\nloving, but they didn't have the central heating, and they lived a very simple life. And I\nremember being very tired, and they had a bed for me and they heated the bed oh, God, it\nwas cold. They heated the bed with an old First World War canteen, metal one filled",
        "Q: No, I need to +",
        "A: So, anyway that's why oh, by the way, when we moved to Seattle, and we moved to\nthe house, my father said okay, now that you're Jewish, you better go to religious school.\nSo he he made me go to temple _ Sunday school. Well, now you don't have a very\ngood time in Sunday school if your parents don't belong to the temple. So and I didn't\nhave the right clothes and I started going to Sunday school at the age of probably 11 or\n12, I don't know, 11, maybe. And I didn't know any Hebrew. And by that time those\nkids had all learned stuff. And teachers couldn't understand why I was so stupid. And it\nwasn't a very good experience. So I remember after awhile, I had to take the bus to\nSunday school and I would take the bus, and I would not get off at Sunday school. I\nwould go on downtown Seattle and walk around and watch my time and then come back\nhome at the right time. So that I didn't even go. So in high school I have not terribly\ngood memories of all of that. I was geography, I have never been terribly good at math,\nbut geography and history is what I loved. Let's see",
        "Q: Do you think that has something to do with the fact that you traveled so much?",
        "A: Probably. I don't know but, you know, my brother was, like I said, this incredibly\nintelligent kid and he when my father did buy a car in Seattle, and Eric taught himself\nhow to fix cars. And long before he was able to drive, old enough to drive, he was a\nnight manager then it was a McKale's gas station. McKale's doesn't exist anymore, but it\nwas a chain. Here was this kid who not old enough to drive but he was the night\nmanager of a gas station. The house that we bought was built at the turn of the century,\nand still had gas lamps up in the attics. And my brother rewired things so that we have\nlights and stuff. And so my mother I would my father used it was awful. My father\nused the phone for business. And if I had a date boys could call, and he'd say I'm busy,\nboom. And I remember threatening my father once. I said if you don't let me use the\nphone, I will call the phone company and tell them you're using it for business instead of,\nyou know, a home phone. He looked at me like who the hell are you, you know? That's\nwhy I left. I was never home. And when Art moved into the houseboat, I was there most\nof the time. But my mother I remember when I of course my brother was in the service\nfor a short time, and then he started college, too. But my mom taught was going to teach\nme how to drive.",
        "Q: Your mother, right?",
        "A: Yeah, I never was close to my dad, my mother, yeah. And one day Eric's friend, Ted,\nwho used to work on cars with him who lived on the street, saw us. And when Eric came\nhome, he said I saw your sister. Your mom is teaching her to drive. Oh, he blew up. He\ntold my mom in no uncertain terms that if you continue to teach Eleanor how to drive, I\nwon't fix the cars anymore.",
        "Q: I'm sorry. I missed it. Was it your brother who said this?",
        "A: My brother because he was the one who kept everything going.",
        "Q: And he just wanted to be the one who is only allowed to drive?",
        "A: Yeah, he didn't want me to screw things up or whatever.",
        "Q: Isee. I thought that you guys were really close.",
        "A: Well, we did",
        "Q: You and your brother.",
        "A: just for a while, when we were alone in England, but, no, Eric could do everything\nbetter than I could. And he was so anyway, I didn't learn how to drive until I had two\nchildren but, yeah, I have never forgiven him for that, to tell you the truth. I told his kids\nthat. They couldn't believe it. But he was kind of a difficult father when he raised his\nown kids, my brother was.",
        "Q: Your brother.",
        "A: He has really mellowed now. But, yeah, very much like our father, the apple doesn't\nfall far from the tree.",
        "Q: Well, it's either like that or completely opposite, just like you are, right?",
        "A: Umhum.",
        "Q: You said that you raised your children completely opposite.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. One of his daughters, he threw out of the house, my brother did.",
        "Q: Umhum.",
        "A: She came back. But she was into drugs and this stuff and had an abortion. No, I was\na super mom, I was the girl scout leader, and the boy scout volunteer. And I volunteered\nfor the all of the sports teams. And I went to every baseball game. And I was the room\nmother in school.",
        "Q: In school, umhum.",
        "A: The PTA president. And I volunteered in the health clinic and all of that. But I\nthought my kids were the absolute most fantastic thing in the world.",
        "Q: That's good.",
        "A: And see, you know, and my husband said he always resented the fact that the kids\ncame first. And so I probably wasn't the greatest wife, but I said, yeah, I said, they didn't\nask to be born, and my kids always came first.",
        "Q: Did you ever confront your mother?",
        "A: Yes, she denied everything. I tried, but it was hopeless. And since my father died so\nearly, I would only make her unhappy. And she depended on me. And she adored my\nchildren, and she adored my husband after she learned to know him.",
        "Q: That he could play bridge really well.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. And so by nine we got married in 1950, and those early years we lived\nway out. Oh, I we were both going to college when we were engaged, and I found a\nplace he was busy. He was going to school, Art was, and he was working at Boeing on\nthe fields. So he never had any time to look for an apartment or anything. I found an\napartment. It was $55 a month. It was on the top floor of an old wooden building in\nSeattle. And I paid the rent for the first period. And I think we were pretty happy. What\nhappened was [remember well, the Korean war broke out very shortly after we got\nmarried. And Art was in the Navy reserve. He's a Pearl Harbor survivor. I don't know if\nI mentioned that.",
        "Q: No, you haven't.",
        "A: Yeah, Pearl Harbor survivor. Married a Holocaust survivor and Art I told him, I\nsaid, I don't want to be alone. I mean, here I was starting this new family in my new life,\nyou know. And I was never happy as a child. And so we were pretty happy together.\nAnd I said I don't want to be alone. I want to get pregnant. And he said you're too\nyoung, and I said yeah, but you're not. He was 29. And soI did. I got pregnant on __.\nAnd so by that time, he graduated. And he transferred from being an inspector on the\nfield to being engineer. He took a big wage cut.",
        "Q: Cut?",
        "A: Cut in those days. Yeah. Quickly worked out but so I got pregnant. And I was still\nworking at the hospital at that time because I could walk back and forth.\nAnd then Boeing his papers came. We knew being chief radarman in the navy, that he\nwould be called back. And Boeing said we need him more than the Navy. So Art I\nremember saying well, I'm going to lose my reserve status and any benefits that I'll have.\nAnd I said I don't care. I'm not going to be alone here. You're not going in the service.\nAnd he didn't want to go anyway. So he left the reserves and worked as an engineer for\nBoeing for 38 years. And we lived in the third floor in that apartment. And I remember\ncoming home on a very hot day in April. And I was huffing and puffing, trying to get up\nthose stairs and I was exhausted. And Art was always working. And by that time Boeing\nwas gearing up for the war. He was always working late. And I layed down on the bed\nexhausted, and my water broke. And I called my mom and she took me to the hospital\nand then finally Art came. And so Steve was born. And then I was I said I have worked\nall of my life and gone to school, one baby is not enough to keep me busy. I was bored.\nSo I said I wanted another baby. And of course I said you're nuts, but okay. So we had\nanother one, 22 months apart and just before while I was pregnant with the second one,\nsome friend of ours found an apartment for us, which was a lower duplex in an area that\nwas already pretty much going black, but not completely. And it was very reasonably\npriced. The lady just wanted some nice people on the lower floor. It was a big\napartment. And we moved there and I didn't have to go three flights anymore. And we\nlived there very happily, and we had friends. And I remember that there was a really old\nlady who lived upstairs, and she was very nice. We didn't see her often. And while I was\nin the hospital having Brian, she died.",
        "Q: Was this your second child, right, Brian?",
        "A: Yes. She died, and Art came to the hospital. In those days, you stayed in the hospital\nfor several days, you know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so she wanted whitey oh, no, no, no, she sold it to black people, and she wanted\nwhitey out right now. No, the black people wanted it. They didn't give us any time. And\nso my father I of course I couldn't drive with a brand new baby, but my oldest child\nwould stay with my mother. I had the baby. And my father said we'll have to go house\nhunting. And by that time, we had been saving some money, and for a down payment\nyou could get houses on the GI bill, and we drove way out, which was considered in\nthose days really way out. And we found a house that I liked. And I came home and I\ntold Art, and the next day he had off. We went out there. And there were houses that\nwere upstairs and downstairs and all on one floor. Well, we didn't have enough money\nfor the down payment for the one what do you call it, all on one floor. But we bought\nthe one with an upstairs. It was fairly steep. And my father had a fit. By that time, you\nknow, he says I had two little boys, and he said you can't have the upstairs, it will be\nhotter terribly hot in the summer, and the boys will fall down the stairs, you just can't do\nthat. How why did you buy that? And so Art says well, we didn't have enough money\nfor the all on one floor. How much do you need? And he gave us some money\nimmediately. Go out and change it.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Well, that was nice of him.",
        "A: Yes, go out and changed it. He adored my boys and he kind of mellowed over the\nyears and so we went out and bought the one all on one floor. And my parents, they\nwould like as my boys got older, they took them each at one one at a time on little trips\nto Mount Rinear or some lake or something for a little hike.\nAnd by that time Steve told me this recently, my father was already quite weak with his\nheart problem. And he said, he would sit on the bench somewhere while mom and my\nson would go hiking around. So he has those good memories, and so does Brian, but my\ndaughter was younger, Audrey, and so Dad died in 1958. And the strange thing 1s that I\nhad three children. And right after Dad died, I found out I was pregnant, and I was pretty\nupset. I didn't want to have anymore kids. But then all of a sudden I thought oh, maybe,\nyou know, you get this crazy idea, maybe God meant for this child to make up for your\ndad dying.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So because by that time we had moved to a bigger house and we had a dishwasher.\nAnd [| had three children in school, and I got pregnant again, but I just I talked about\nabortion, but my mother my husband said absolutely no. So anyway I had JoDean, and\nshe turned out to be the most wonderful little girl in the world.",
        "Q: Is this the daughter that wasn't here?",
        "A: No, she's the older daughter.",
        "Q: She's the older daughter.",
        "A: JoDean is the one with all of the long hair there.",
        "Q: She's the blond hair one, right?",
        "A: Well, she lightens it, yes.",
        "Q: So you have right now",
        "A: Two boys and two girls.",
        "Q: [have a photograph here, two boys and two girls, right, very good looking children.\nSo it seems that your mother and father were actually better grandparents to your children\nthan they were parents.",
        "A: Very much so. And I thought about that, and I actually kind of resented that, you\nknow. And I thought they never were that close to me, you know. But I got over it. I\ndidn't let 1t bother me too much because I was too busy having all of those kids, and after\nthe war, you know, you had cooperative play groups, and I was always involved with the\nkids and baseball teams. And I went to all of the games. Four kids kept me plenty busy,\nyeah.",
        "Q: I'm sure they did. I'm sure they did.",
        "A: Yeah. So actually my father I felt he was pretty pathetic as he got older because he\nwas a broken man. He lost his profession. He lost his station, his status in the world.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And it was hard. I understand that now, but a young person thinks only of himself.\nSo life just progressed and I oh, when I was in the hospital having Audrey, that's the one\nthat was here, Art I remember there was a congregation, a reform congregation that was\njust starting up, and a lot of young couples with children. And Art came to the hospital\nand said now you're going we had talked about it. You're going to have to make up your\nmind. I was very ambivalent about Judaism, et cetera. And we had our Christmas tree\nstill. And Art told me, he said if we're going to join this temple, I want to be one of the\noriginal members. And we have to do it right now because they're signing the charter.\nAnd I was I had just had Audrey. And I said okay, do what you want. And so we joined\nthe temple and we were very active. It was a lovely time. Art taught Sunday school.\nAnd he didn't know a whole lot, but he learned fast.",
        "Q: So he also didn't come from a religious family, you would say.",
        "A: Well, Art's father was he knew a lot, but he was one step ahead of the czar. And he\ncame to the United States at the turn of the century. And there were five brothers. They\nhad a stolen passport, and the story I got was the first one would come and send the\npassport back. And I found out many, many years after I married him that his family\nname was actually Polits (ph). And it came from somewhere in Poland originally, but he\nwas in Russia, and he was a communist, very much so. But also they had programs and\nhe was Jewish, and so they would send the passport back and forth. And the name on the\npassport was Rabalovitch (ph) which turned out to be Rafalovitch (ph) so when and they\nall stayed in the east whereas Art's father got on the railroad and worked his way west\nand settled into Tacoma, Washington, which is 30 miles from Seattle, and that's where\nArt grew up. And when I was not married yet, I was still engaged. At one time I went to\nsee to Tacoma and Art's sister had done very well or husband was in the jewelry\nbusiness, and they had quite a bit of money. And so Julia Rolfe from New York came to\nvisit my sister in law. And she called me and you have to come and meet her. And I said\nRolfe? And she said oh, yes, the New York part of the family all changed their name to\nRolfe. And I said well, I don't want to be Rafalovitch (ph) I told Art. I said get your\nname changed. I want to you know, on your degree, he was still in school. And on our\nmarriage license, we're going to be Rolfe. Art had never known there was a New York\nfamily.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. There were quite a few. And it's really interesting. But anyway, we changed\nour name to Rolfe. And my children are very happy. They would never have liked that\nname. Anyway it wasn't a family name.",
        "Q: It's hard to spell, yeah.",
        "A: Rolfe is a nice name. But that's how we got that name, and it's an English name and\npeople always ask are you related to so and so Rolfe? No. So that was done before we\ngot married. And I was thinking of something, but the thought just left me.",
        "Q: Oh, we were talking about you becoming more religious, right?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. We joined the temple and Steve went to Sunday school and he came home.\nWe joined the temple in May and that that December, Steve my son is very adamant.\nHe gets that from his dad, I guess. He said we can't have a Christmas tree. That is\nmaking fun of Christian symbols. And Brian was really angry. He liked the Christmas\ntree. From that day on we didn't have a Christmas tree.",
        "Q: Making fun of Christian symbols?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: The Christmas tree?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You mean that this is a Pagan symbol after all, right?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, how old was Steve? Was 19 the winter of 1956. He had just started\nreligious school. And the teacher said, you know, we don't have Christmas trees so\nnaturally I know that Brian resented that. And I know that when Brian got married they\nalways had Christmas trees. But he didn't marry a Jewish person anyway. Steve what\nSteve said kind of was the law. So we were really Jewish. But I didn't have a\nbackground. So I didn't know all of the prayers and everything.",
        "Q: Did you think that your parents also became more religious after they came to the\nstates? I understand you said that you were helped a little bit in Seattle by a Jewish\ncommunity.",
        "A: Yes. Well, the Jewish there were quite a few refugees coming everywhere, every\ncity. All of the Jewish communities were helping. No, my father had no no use for\nreligion at all. And, no, they never attended the temple, but they thought it was proper\nfor me to go to Sunday school. But my brother about that time was was beyond the bar\nmitzvah age or just about that. And he wasn't about to get involved with that. So he was\nnever made to go to Sunday school, only I was.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And oh, my goodness, I think as I remember, we did have a Christmas tree in Seattle.\nAnd I think we used the Menorah also because we had this big we had both. But I don't\nremember very joyous Christmases. My mother was befriended by a lot of Quakers\nwhen we first came to the United States in Seattle. And there was one wonderful thing\nthat I remembered to this day, the Quakers had on New Year's, they had New Year's\ncallers.",
        "Q: New Year's callers, what's that?",
        "A: New Year's callers. And every New Year's a different family would host, and they\nusually had about five or six homes that were hosts. And the New Year's callers it was a\nfairly large group would go to all of them, one after another and talk and enjoy the new\nyear and then go to the next New Year's callers. And I understand they do that in Canada\ntoday.",
        "Q: I see. I never heard of that.",
        "A: It was very lovely. And my mother had these Quaker friends. She belonged to the\n\"Jewish club of Washington,\" a bunch of German Jews. And every once in a while I\nwould meet some of these people or I would go with her, and I vowed that I was never\ngoing to marry a German Jew",
        "Q: Why is that?",
        "A: I didn't like them. I don't know. It was very typical, children should be seen and not\nheard. Very arrogant. I mean, totally opposite of the way I looked at having children. I\nmean, they were the greatest things ever that I ever created. I thought they were just\nabsolutely wonderful. And maybe it's because nobody ever thought I was wonderful.\nAnd so it's a really strange thing that Steve, when he got married he would didn't get\nmarried",
        "Q: Your older son, right?",
        "A: My oldest son, and he didn't marry a Jewish girl. But Gail wanted to go to Nova\nScotia for a honeymoon. Don't ask me why. She just wanted to see Nova Scotia. So\nGail came from Boston and so for their honeymoon trip, they visited her folks, of course,\nand they had a big wedding and her folks came and but anyway they went to Nova\nScotia. And I don't know how I think I just lost my train of thought.\nEnd of File One\nBeginning File Two",
        "Q: Well, you were saying that you didn't like the German Jews.",
        "A: No, I didn't. I didn't. My brother had no religious background to speak of. And so\neventually he went to Reed College and then he got he went to Reed College, and then\nhe had a scholarship to a program for government employment, political science up in\nupstate New York, and he had a full scholarship for that. And then he went to work for\nthe federal government. And he ended up being deputy director of the Environmental\nProtection Agency. So he worked his way up very high in the government. And then\nwhen he retired he had two years of he had to sign a clause that he could not work in\nindustry, that he represented the government, you know, for two years, a noncompetition\nclause because he was the one who put all the emission controls on our vehicles. And so\nhe went to teach at Purdue University for two years and then he went to work for asa\nconsultant for Mazda and Ford in their emission control. And, of course, my mother\nadored him. Somebody at the door?",
        "Q: Yes. There we go.",
        "A: Are you on?",
        "Q: Yeah, we are on.",
        "A: You asked me if I became a practicing Jew.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Well, you know, although I had no background in Judaism, I would do anything for\nmy children and, yes, we joined the temple. She had just been born. And the boys went\nto religious school. And it was a great group. We were all young parents. And we had a\nlot of friends there. And we had parties, and 1t was good. And I learned to be Jewish.",
        "Q: Did your mother ever go too?",
        "A: No, I don't think she ever went with us to temple. My father was still alive. I have\ngot that was 1956. And then Dad died in '58. And oh, about that time, we needed a\nbigger house again. And I remember being at a party and somebody said well, Ellie's\nmoving and is she going to have a dishwasher? And I said would she be moving without\na dishwasher? Because I didn't have one in my first home. And it was nice. Everybody\nhad their own room. And it was a nice house. And then my mother, of course, she was a\nwidow by then, and she took up skiing. And she went to she didn't ski very well, but she\nand her friends, they went to Sun Valley, and she fell in the pool. She told everybody it\nwas on the hill, but she fell 1n the pool and she tore all of her I think she tore her ACL\nligaments. And so she was in a cast, and so naturally she had to move in with us for quite\na while until she was healed. And then we had to get her by that time, the house, the\nfamily house that I grew up in was completely surrounded by black folks. And it was a\ndifferent time than now, you know. And it was difficult, so we insisted that Mom move.\nAnd we found her an apartment in the suburbs. And then as the years passed by, we had\na nice time in the house we lived in. Lots of neighborhood parties. We had progressive\ndinners and I was very happy there. And we belonged to the temple. We belonged to a\nswim club. We had a good life.",
        "Q: So you had a very good sense of community then.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Really.",
        "A: Very good. And all of a sudden well, all of a sudden well, we oh, God, Art was\nstarted to travel, but Boeing in Seattle, we had a recession like now. And Boeing\ninsisted that Art had to move to Alabama and because there were no jobs in Seattle. I\nremember there was a poster somebody put up, the last person that leaves Seattle, turn\nout the lights, yeah. So anyway I resisted, but I didn't have a choice. I mean I couldn't\nsupport four children. So we went to by that time I was very, very close to my mother.\nWe all were. And so we moved to Alabama. And I remember Art had to go in January.\nHe took one car, and he flew back. And we went in June after school was out. By that\ntime we were all skiing a lot. And even JoDean who was really little, she turned out to be\neven today keeps up her accreditation as an instructor. I remember we drove I drove the\nkids to ski resorts while Art was in Alabama. And I had a white station wagon with\nbright red license plates, Alabama license plates.",
        "Q: Are they bright red still?",
        "A: I don't know if they're bright red still, but they were at that time. And people would\nlook at that in the parking lot and say Alabama? I said when you live in Alabama, you\ngot to go a long way to ski.",
        "Q: Certainly.",
        "A: Well, you know, he could license the car and then we didn't have to buy two licenses.\nSo instead of Washington, we bought Alabama. So then we went to Alabama. We\ndrove, and we went by way of Disneyland and it was a pretty good trip. And along the\nway, we became more affluent. The kids the school were terrible.",
        "Q: In Alabama?",
        "A: Yes. So I insisted on the kids going to private school. And I had I had argued with\nmy husband about that, but you see my husband is was very, very intelligent and he did\nvery well. He learned very well in public school because he just read all of the books\nthey had, but anyway I won and unfortunately I would have had to send Steve to\nBirmingham because there was no private high school and I couldn't do that yet. There\nwas no way I was going to send my son to a different city. And so the three younger\nones went to this very, very good private school and it made a terrific difference. Even\ntoday my son, Brian, says that made me realize that I had some brains. And JoDean was\nborn in November. And she used to say Phoebe gets to go to school. She called him\nBarney gets to go to school, Onnie (ph) gets to go to school. I never get to go to school.\nSo there was no public kindergarten. And so at first I put her in a basket on my bike, and\nwe went to all sorts of places, and we had a good time. I was alone most of the time in\nAlabama so because Art was working, in New Jersey. Boeing had a habit of doing that,\nbut so I decided I started her in private kindergarten a year earlier.",
        "Q: Oh, you did start one, right, yourself? You started one yourself?",
        "A: No. It was there was no public kindergarten in Alabama. It was all private. So it\nwas in a church and people said aren't you ashamed of lying in church, that she's actually\nfive when she wasn't? And I said it doesn't matter to me whether I lied in church or\nanyplace else. So she oh, that was kind of interesting. The by the time we were in\nHuntsville, Alabama, all of the German scientists had come there. Wernher von Braun\nwas living in Alabama and all of his cohorts. I found that very difficult. They were\nobnoxious. I remember going to the supermarket, and they talked very loud in German,\nand obviously that bothered me, but Wernher von Braun's daughter was at Randolph\nSchool, which I said it was a very, very good private school, and dated my son, I believe.\nThey went to parties together once, yeah, just once. And, of course, he Brian didn't drive\nyet in those days. Brian has always been a social person. I remember I would drive him\non dates and take him places and pick him up. But they were a lot of Germans in that\nschool, weren't there? Umm?",
        "Q: __ +dating?",
        "A: Oh, I had a fit probably, yeah. Can you imagine? But you know the American\ngovernment brought all of those people to our country, yeah. And that's where Redstone\nArsenal is. I always felt that they brought us they could have done this in other parts of\nthe country, but they brought us northerners to the south to integrate the south. I always\nfelt that. We were being used to integrate the south. It was a difficult time. I remember\nthat Brian no, Steve had to go to public high school. He was in the band. And the band\nwas invited to go to play for Lurleen Wallace's inauguration at what's the name of the\ncity, Audrey?\nAudrey: ___",
        "A: No, no, in the coast.\nAudrey: Mobile.",
        "A: Huh huh.\nAudrey: Mobile.",
        "A: No. I'll think of it, but anyway wherever they were\nAudrey: Montgomery.",
        "A: Montgomery. They were going to Montgomery and the Huntsville High School band\nwas going to play at Lurleen Wallace's inauguration. Now, this woman was running for\ngovernor because her previous the previous governor was her husband and he couldn't\nrun anymore, you know, only so many terms. Well, they get on a bus and Steve comes\nfrom the west. He really we never found any anti Semitism in the west. I was the one\nwho came from that background, but not my children. They started out and nobody\nwould let them go to the bathroom. I mean, the Huntsville High School band was mostly\nblack. It was integrated. And that was integrated and that was our schools that was the\ngovernment, city, you know? So Steve said that he learned a lot about discrimination.",
        "Q: Really.",
        "A: Interesting. And so he never really felt any discrimination as a Jew growing up\nbecause we lived in the west. And I'm sure that the people you see my father refused to\nstay in New York because he wanted to he was going be an immigrant, he wasn't going\nto be in New York with all of those other Jews. So we were assimilated and he it was\ndifficult. When they got to Montgomery, they wouldn't even seat them. And so the bus\nturned around and came back to Huntsville. That was a good lesson for Steve.\nUnbelievable, though difficult times.",
        "Q: Yeah, I can difficult times.",
        "A: Yeah, I mean\nAudrey: 1966.",
        "A: Yeah, that was it's really interesting. I just recently saw films about that, you know,\nthey turned the hose on black kids that tried to go to school. It was awful. I hated\nHuntsville. My mother came all the time. We were close to my mother in those I mean\nshe the most important thing in my mother's life was her children, her grandchildren so",
        "Q: People change.",
        "A: Yeah. I kind of resented that, but that's the way it was. So when we lived when we\nfirst came to Huntsville, We lived in an apartment. We had to build a house. There\nwasn't anything there and there were three bedrooms, a bedroom for Art and me,\nbedroom for the boys, and a bedroom for the girls, and Paula came home. And so we had\nto walk over beds, yeah.",
        "Q: _.",
        "A: Yeah. She adored my children, you know. Interesting, isn't it?",
        "Q: It is interesting, but people do change.",
        "A: People change, yes. So I have always kind of felt like I was in the outside looking in\nwhen I was supposed to be Jewish, I wasn't Jewish enough. I didn't have the right\nclothes. When we came to Seattle, the council of Jewish women, there were a number\nyou know immigrants came west. And they had a big dinner for us, for the new\nimmigrants. And I remember long tables at this temple. And we went there and they the\ntable decorations were little figures like from Fiddler On The Roof.",
        "Q: Umhum.",
        "A: In those kind of clothes. My brother who was typically arrogant, like his father, took\none look at those and, you know, depicting immigrants and thinking oh, he says we're not\nstaying. He was just so angry. I remember that. And my father looked at that, and then\nhe realized that Eric said, no, I can't look at those figures, and we left. But in those days,\nthere was people always discriminated against each other. And there was a large\npopulation of Jews from the Isle of Rose.",
        "Q: I'm not sure where that is.",
        "A: Spanish Jews, Sephardic Jews, very large Sephardic Jews that came in the early part\nof the 1900s and it was large. And in those days if the Ashkenazic Jews, they\ndiscriminated against the Sephardic Jews. I remember the very first I heard a family\nactually would sit shiva if their daughter or son married a Sepharic Jew.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And the concept of discrimination, this was just unbelievable in my mind. So at one\ntime the first year my brother was at the University of Washington he transferred the\nsecond year to Reed College. He was, of course, on the newspaper staff. And he wrote\nan article. Race relations were terrible in the '60s. He wrote an article in the University\nof Washington Daily. And he wrote that I think I still have the article in a file that the\nonly hope for peace and happiness was between the races and to get rid of this animosity\nfor complete mingling of the races, intermarriage. Oh, my God.",
        "Q: I'm sure that",
        "A: Signed by Eric Stark (ph). Our phone never stopped ringing. My parents said how\ncan you write that? Oh, my gosh.",
        "Q: I'm sure that was a bit controversial.",
        "A: Very controversial. Yes. And then after my parents got used to my marrying\nsomething of Russian background, and they loved Art because he's a wonderful man.",
        "Q: Is that his full name, Art?",
        "A: Arthur.",
        "Q: Arthur.",
        "A: Arthur. And he doesn't have a middle name. They didn't bother with middle names\nin those days. Yeah, Arthur. And what was I going to say?",
        "Q: You were saying that they got used to him being a Russian Jew.",
        "A: Oh, yes. In 1952 I got married in '50. In 1952, Art met Dorothy, and we heard about\nhis girlfriend, that turned out to be a finace\u00e9. He lived here in Washington D.C. He was\nworking for the government. And he would he told my mother none of us went to the\nwedding. Dorothy is part American Indian.",
        "Q: Umhum.",
        "A: She's a wonderful woman. And my mother told me don't you ever, ever tell anybody\nthat Dorothy has American Indian heritage. I think her father was white. The mother\nwas, you know she came from a family of 13 children. And my brother was at that time\nhe had moved to the Department of Indian affairs. She was a secretary there.",
        "Q: So I'm sorry because I think I missed it. So this is your brother who met her, right?",
        "A: Yes. And, you know, I told you that my parents discriminated against my husband\nbecause he had a Russian background, and then the idea that my brother would marry\nsomebody American Indian.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Of course everybody loved each other in the end.",
        "Q: Right. It's just an initial obstacle.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Different upbringing I'm sure, too.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you think that the fact that you were the Kindertransport child, did this do you\nthink that had any influence on your life?",
        "A: What is that noise?",
        "Q: Iam afraid that apparently somebody is having a speech.",
        "A: Oh, oh. They're applauding. I think so. I was alone. I was alone at the age of 8.\nAnd I went to a foreign country where I didn't know the language. And then when I got\nto the school, I was kind of discriminated against because they found out I had parents\nthat were alive.",
        "Q: And who also could send you the packages?",
        "A: Yeah. And I think from that I was always alone and being, yeah, I was used to being\nalone and little. I was always small. And some people made lifelong friends when they\nwere in England. I did not. No. I think about it. And when at first, they talked about\nsurvivors. I never thought of myself as a survivor, you know, because I wasn't in a camp,\nbut then they said, you know, we are. Like I said, I talked to the lady who made the film,\nmy knees were jumping. That film was shown in the Seattle Jewish film festival 12 years\nago. I told Melissa that. And she remembered that. It was shown in a large auditorium.\nAnd [| had read in the newspaper it was going to be shown. And I told Art, we got to go.\nAnd we went. Have you ever seen that film?",
        "Q: No, I haven't seen that one.",
        "A: In one of the pictures, 1t was a string of girls dancing and I said, Art, there's _. He\nsays, yeah, because my father had taken so many pictures. He was, you know, a\nphotographer. I mean, he took pictures of everything. And so we had a lot of pictures of\nme as a little girl. So Millis Hacker (ph) asked if there was anybody in the audience who\ncame on the Kindertransport. And I raised my hand. And I was the only one. And\nafterwards I ran down because we were quite a ways up. And I talked to her. And she\ntold me about KTA. I had no idea. Living in the west I had no idea there was an\norganization I didn't have any Jewish connections except the temple. And so Melissa\ntold me about the international KTA Association. And she took my name. And within a\nweek or so, I got stuff in the mail from Kindertransport. Now there was no\nKindertransport group in Seattle, but there was it's a group of child survivors, you know.\nI got to go to the bathroom.",
        "Q: Oh, let's pause.",
        "A: Are you done? {Recess} Yeah, my father, when I moved when my mother died, we\nmoved boxes and boxes of papers to our house. And when we downsized two years ago\nto a retirement community, I started going through all of our papers and one my son in\nlaw, Audrey's husband, is very interested in that. And he sometimes comes from\nColorado and he goes through stuff. He finds it amazing. And my grandson one\ngrandson is living in Freiburg, Germany and he graduated with three degrees from\nmy family has done very well in the United States, very well. My brother was high up in\nthe American government, and his daughter one daughter was in charge of\ncommunications for the Library of Congress. She was head of that. And the other one is\ninvolved with her husband in contracting and has done very well. And so my oldest\ngrandson is a geophysicist, and an amazing person. And they're lovely children. I was\nwith my daughter every time she had a baby, and so I'm close to her boys. And the\nmiddle one graduated with a degree in German and applied physics and in math from\nTrinity University where he had a full scholarship. And now he is in Freiburg working\non his master's. And the younger one, like I said, is at American University, and my\ndaughter just went to pick him up at the metro station. They'll be here shortly. So but\nanyway, my son in law and Mark have been going through my father's papers. He\nworked trying to get other people who were stranded in different countries to get them in\nthe United States. They were in Borneo. I don't know where all, you know. And I have\nall of those letters. He actually contacted somebody from Sear's Roebuck who apparently\nhad some connection somewhere because I found letters from them where he asked for\nmoney, and they always gave it to him to send to these people to get them into the United\nStates.",
        "Q: Our museum might be interested in such papers if you would be willing to share.",
        "A: Yeah. I have to check. Now, Mark just made copies. I have a what do you call it?\nIt's actually a book written on __+ typed, and very close together. And it's my cousin\nliving underground with her husband in Belgium. And it's written in German, so I my\nGerman isn't good enough for that.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: And I have that and unfortunately I didn't check to find out if she was alive until after\nshe died. And they eventually came to the United States, settled in Florida, and were in\nthe antique business and died in the very late '80s. And at that time I was too busy\nraising kids, and I never really thought of looking into it, but I have her book that she\nwrote. And I have interesting stuff. I don't know if anybody would be interested in photo\nalbums.",
        "Q: I'm sure they will.",
        "A: My parents did a lot of mountain childing. And Mom told me about when they went\nto Pompeii for a trip, the guide said the woman cab looked down there but, yeah. I have\nsince traveled some. And it happened that you asked me about my Uncle Walter, he was\nsent then to Amsterdam to be with all of the other Itingers (ph) that had moved to\nAmsterdam, and when the news came that they would all be deported and sent to\nWesterbork, one of the uncles or something sent realized that Walter would never\nsurvive if they were sent to a concentration camp.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so he had some money, and he looked for someone who would take him in and\nshield him. And so there was an actress unfortunately, I don't have these names anymore\nin my mind, but anyway in the last many years I spent a lot of time going back and forth\nto Holland because what happened was the money was given to Audrey may be able to\nget the name. I can't seem to get the name into my mind. It will come back. And he was\nat that time a very young man. He became a famous movie producer in Holland. And\nwhat he did was he took the money and killed my uncle and threw him in the canal in a\nin a suitcase. And they found him and the it's an interesting story. The first policeman\non the case, on the scene, was a part of the resistance movement, and he would go out in\nthe fields. And I met all of these people in Holland because they're not Jews. And before\nthis grandfather died, I did meet him. And he would pick up the weapons that the British\ndropped out in the fields. And he would pick them up and put them underneath the baby\ncarriage with the baby on top and bring them to the priest who was collecting weapons.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Really trying to get a resistance going, but it didn't work, of course, but so he was\naware of he was a first he was a policeman in Amsterdam. And he was the first one on\nthe scene. And he always knew that Walter was murdered. And anyway, he tried very\nhard to get this man convicted, and he just spent maybe a few months of jail, and that was\nit.",
        "Q: That was it.",
        "A: Well, the baby in the baby carriage was told that, you know, you have to follow up on\nthis case. And I have a book about it. It's all in Dutch though. And you have to bring\nhim to justice. And so she eventually died of cancer. And as she was dying in the last\ndays, she told her son, Peter, that you have to follow this up for me and work on it. And I\nguess it was something the whole family always knew.\nWell, Peter Crowson then started his search and he he's an archivist in Amsterdam. He\nhas now been promoted. He 1s now the head archivist in Amsterdam. But at that time,\nthere were some writers who were looking into this murder also. It made a hell of a good\nstory. And so this author apparently came to the archives and talked to Peter and wanted\nsome information. And eventually they got together and he convinced Peter, although it\nwas difficult for him because it would have been he could have gotten fired, but anyway\nto join him in this search and",
        "Q: Would you remind me who Peter was?",
        "A: Peter was just the son of this lady who was in the baby carriage.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: It was just passed down generations. And it was something that they wanted to\nunfortunately like I can't remember the name of the",
        "Q: That's not a problem. You can maybe",
        "A: But he is a very famous man in Amsterdam who just threw recently has been\ndiscredited because he not only killed my uncle, he killed others. And he told Jews I'll\ntake care of your property and your money. And when you come back, you can have it.\nThose that came back, never heard of you.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He was acrook. But anyway, he even tried to get a pension as a resistance person.\nAnd, of course, he was never he was turned down, and he sued people. And Peter is the\nman who finally he couldn't get anymore information about Walter and his family. So\nhe searched the Internet. And he searched the name Itinger (ph) which is my mother's\nmaiden name. And there were lots of Itingers (ph) because it's a Catholic name. So a lot\nof people said, never heard of tt.\nOne person, and it was my cousin's daughter who was working as a journalist in the\nColorado mountains for a local newspaper, responded to him and said I think I know\nwhat you're talking about. She called her dad. And her dad called me. And it was\ncoincidental that was in January of 1901. And I had made I was invited to go back to\nHamburg, you know, in the visitation program.",
        "Q: 1901?",
        "A: Excuse me.",
        "Q: 2001, right?",
        "A: 2001. And then I went to Hamburgh, and I had told Audrey they let me bring\nsomebody and I wanted you to come because Art said that he what was the purpose of\nhim learning all of this? Audrey will share it with the family, you know. Pass it down,\nbesides Audrey and I have always been close. And I didn't have the greatest marriage.",
        "Q: Can you excuse me for a second? I just remembered that I need to _+yes. { Recess\n\u2018 Let's record. There we go.",
        "A: I'd like to share this with someone from the Holocaust center eventually because it's\nan interesting story. They traced us, and my cousin, Peter, actually forbade me to go see\nthese people. He said what do they want from us? Do they want money? He was always\nsuspicious. Well, Peter Crowson is a man who [ had a gut feeling that he was honest. He\nwrote to me many, many e mail letters. And so we were in Hamburgh. And I agreed for\nhim to come and meet us. And he was going to drive to Hamburgh with his Arthur\nfriend, and they were going to drive us back to Amsterdam and actually he invited us to\nstay with him. My cousin, Peter, was livid and he said you can't do this. And I'm like\ndon't tell me what to do, but anyway this was amazing. So since 2001 over the years\nwe've gotten to know the person. And I've done many trips back to Amsterdam. And\nAudrey has come with me on a couple. My one grandson was studying in Delft, which is\nright next to Amsterdam. And it's become a home away from home. It's just amazing.\nAnd we actually got this man convicted.",
        "Q: Oh, very good.",
        "A: Yeah. Actually well, he's very old now, but what we tried to do was clear the record\nso that people would know what an awful person he was. He said he was a resistance\nhelper. He never was. He took money from Jews before they were sent to the camps and\nsaid he would save it for them and, of course, he never got it back. Artwork he actually\nto this day is living in a home that came from a wealthy Jew And my daughter will\nprobably remember. For some reason I have a total block now. But I have talked to\nauthors and journalists in Amsterdam. And we've communicated and it took us a long\ntime. Peter, who is when we write to Peter and his wife now, like I said, they're like\nfamily because they I told him my Aaron is coming to Delft, and you're going to love\nhim, and like Peter didn't tell me at the time. He said what does she think, I'm going to\nlove this American kid? And then afterwards, you know, Ellie, you're right, I love\nAaron. They're so close. So Peter, they had a baby. I met them long before she was\neven pregnant. And Aurora is six now and their little girl is called Aurora.",
        "Q: Whose child is that?",
        "A: Peter's. And I had invited them because I've stayed with them so often in Amsterdam.\nAnd I said you got to come to America. And so they came in July. And they came and\nthey spent a week with Audrey in Colorado. And they came and spent a week with me in\nSeattle in Bellevue. Then they went down to Huntington Beach which is very close to\nDisneyland. And they spent a week with my son, Brian. And he drove them back and\nforth. And they wanted to stay in Disneyland Hotel one night. And they came back to\nBrian. And then they flew back to Audrey's house in Colorado. They just had the most\nwonderful time in the United States. And like I said, we have a family in Amsterdam.\nThey are, of course, not Jewish, but we love each other dearly. And we met through this\ncase. And it's this man is of course, he's a liar, and he was very famous. And the thing\nthat he was trying to fight was that his name, you know, we wanted him to be known for\nwhat he was.",
        "Q: I could certainly understand that, and when you remember the name, you can just\nsimply e mail it because we are going to record it.",
        "A: I thought Audrey was coming back. I just can't remember. I noticed about six\nmonths ago that I was having trouble with remembering especially names. And so I think\nthis is part of the aging process.",
        "Q: Don't worry about that. We can definitely include it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Once you supply that name in the record that you mentioned.",
        "A: And the I have the book. It's in Dutch. And I'm sure somebody at the Holocaust\nCenter can read it. And I could send you the book.",
        "Q: That would be great. I'm going to mention",
        "A: I have quite a few copies of it.",
        "Q: I'm going to mention it to NME (ph) who's running today who's supervising this\nproject. So I will definitely",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Thank you so much. I mean it was a very interesting interview. And thank you so\nmuch.",
        "A: I never thought I was that interesting, you know.",
        "Q: Yes, it was very interesting. Thank you so much.",
        "A: You're welcome.",

        "A: You're welcome. I have also been to Israel. And I met some of the relatives that\neventually went to Israel, and it was wonderful.",

        "Answer: Eleanor Rolfe.",
        "A: January 31st, 1930 in Hamburg, Germany.",
        "A: Surprisingly, I can remember back to when I was three years old, which always\namazes my brother. I remember that in my bedroom, they put a rug with flowers in the\nmiddle and a design around the edge. And I wouldn't let anybody walk on the flowers.\nAnd I would go around the corner to my bed. And that's my first memory of my room.\nBut I then I did remember my daughter went to Germany with me in '74, I think. And I\nwe went to where I lived, my house and but it wasn't until was that when we went into\nthe house? I don't remember. We went back in 2001, the spring before 9/11. And I was\ninvited by the City of Hamburg. And my husband said for my daughter to come with me\nbecause she would remember this and pass it onto her children. So it was a wonderful\ntrip. And I had explained how my house, my apartment was laid out. And I\nhad a veranda in front of my room. And we went and knocked on the door or we were\nstanding in front of the place and people said can we help you? And it was an American\nmarried to a German. And I told him that this was the house where I was born. And so\nthey invited us in. And it was really interesting because she said to me, Mom, this is\nexactly the way you described it. So I could we jump ahead?",
        "A: Yes, my brother is three years older. And we were completely assimilated in\nGermany. My father had been in the German army, and had all sorts of medals. He was\ninjured in the first World War. And we had a Christmas tree. I didn't really know I was\nJewish. I went to public school until quite late, then I had to change schools.",
        "A: German, yes.",
        "A: Of course I had my grandmother and grandfather and my uncle who had was\nsomewhat disabled. He had the flu in 1918 and stopped his mental development so he\nwas though he was an adult, he was approximately the age of twelve or thirteen. We\nplayed a lot of games he taught me games and things. My grandparents lived quite a\nwalking distance. And there was another German family living near us and, yes, I was\nfriends with them. I can't really recollect a lot of friends, I guess they didn't stay in my\nmemory.",
        "A: No, my mother came from an orthodox, very orthodox home. And she rebelled\nagainst it because she said that they were not allowed to do anything on the Sabbath, and\nher father would walk outside and get around the corner and light a cigar. So although\nthey had a maid, I guess, who was allowed to turn the light on but she so she married my\ndad. My dad came there was a lot of money in the family, but my father was not raised\nJewish, although both his parents were. His father died when he was three. And he was\na playboy.",
        "A: And he was he went to law school and was an attorney. And as I remember what my\nmother said, her father who was orthodox really stepped in between that and didn't want\nto marry her to marry my dad. And so she was sent to England for a year and told if you\nstill want to marry him when you come back after a year, it's okay. So she did that. And\nmy parents kept everything. I have papers and papers and papers. I have all of their\nletters.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: His name was Osfeld Eric Stark (ph). My mother specifically, she was always\nworried about the situation. But probably because of her background because she was\northodox. My father felt it was a German. And my mother gave us each international\nnames. Eleanor is good in any language and Eric also. So but in Germany my brother\nwas called Osfeld (ph). And so he changed it, of course, to Eric Osfeld.",
        "A: Quite.",
        "A: I'm not sure. I was eight when I went on the Kindertransport, but I was about five, I\nthink, five or six when my brother was sent to boarding school in England. And my\nbrother was very precocious and very intelligent, and he was constantly listening to what\nwe then called the wireless, and so it was could you go up and get that postcard? So they\nsent him to boarding school in England by a German teacher at Bunscord (ph) you\nprobably heard that before.",
        "A: It was a boarding school for German Jewish children. And it was headed up by a\nwoman and something I don't remember the name, but I think I have it written. We\ncalled her Tatta Ana (ph). And by the time well, a lot of the children from wealthy\nfamilies were sent there, especially the boys.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, she was a housewife although we had lots of maids. So she didn't really do\nanything. And remember that in 1937, my father bought a car, Mercedes Benz. And I\nwas told later by one of my cousins that Dad was the only one our family was the only\none who owned a car in the '30s. I remember that when my father bought this car, it was\ngreen. I have a picture of it at home. My mother immediately had to have a driving suit\nmade to match the car. Things I remember.\nI lived a very typical European life that was certainly totally opposite of what my life\nwith my children was, but it was my parents would send me to kindaponceons (ph) on\nholidays.",
        "A: Those were ponceon (ph) is like a camp.",
        "A: Children's camp and it was I remember I was in Switzerland over the new year. My\nparents entertained a lot. And I was in Belgium in the summers. And I was pretty little,\nbut it was organized, you know. And I don't ever remember even sitting on my father's\nlap. It was very distant relationship.",
        "A: Mostly with my father, yeah. But I don't remember long conversations with my\nmother. It just wasn't the thing to do in those days.",
        "A: I don't remember playing with her, no. I played with my uncle who lived with my\ngrandparents and he taught me games and dominoes and stuff like that. I remember that.\nHe was the only grown up that ever paid attention to me.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Yes, he had the flu in 1918. And he was fine, but he was disabled. I mean, he had a\nlittle bit of a lame arm and his mind stopped developing, but he was lovely, lovely\nperson, very lovable. And I think he enjoyed being with me. I remember on Christmas\nwe even had a Christmas tree fire once because in those days, there were candles on\nthem. I don't know how they managed that.",
        "A: They were real candles, and they hung those little rings on the tree, that chocolate\ncandy with the little white dots, nonpareils. Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: In this country they are nonpareils and they're dark chocolate with sugary white little\nthings. And they were rings, and they were hung on the tree along with other things.\nAnd I remember putting our shoes at Christmastime or before Christmas.\nWe also had a Menorah, I think, that was passed down. And I don't remember it in my\nhome in Germany, but we had a big, beautiful, silver Menorah that I first really\nexperienced when we came to the United States. And I know that what I got back\ntogether with my parents. You wanted to know what else did you want to know about\nGermany?",
        "A: I don't remember the Menorah in my German house.",
        "A: Yeah. And I think the Menorah was with my grandparents.",
        "A: It was handed down from my mother's family.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It was before although my mother was very aware, she told me later, she was very\nfrightened, but in 19 I believe '36 or '37 is when they sent my brother away, but I was\nstill there. And I had a pretty normal life. I remember may mother taking me to some\ntailor to have my clothes made. And I know that what you looked like was terribly\nimportant.",
        "A: Very German. I do remember having very close to the end when I was sent away, I\nhad to change schools. I believe that because my father was an attorney and some kind\nof a municipal judge, and I do believe that",
        "A: God, I can't get rid of it. Okay. That's why he he always said this is happening to all\nof those Jews, not us.",
        "A: On him.",
        "A: No. No. I possibly deep in his heart, he was might have been thinking fooling\nhimself, but he was so much a German and never really considered himself Jewish. And\nI believe his parents were also assimilated. He came from a very wealthy family. I know\nvery little about his family. I believe that originally the family came from Holland\nbecause the name Stork is quite Dutch. But I remember visiting his mother very rarely.\nShe was very stiff, pompous woman. I never my mother's parents were very loving, but\nI don't really know much about his parents. He was my my Grandfather Stork died\nwhen Dad was three years old right around the turn of the century. My father was born in\n1897. And I had many, many years it never dawned on me that I thought he had a heart\nattack and died.",
        "A: Not until many, many years later, my aunt that I visited in Boston told me oh, no,\nyour grandfather committed suicide. He had some financial set backs.",
        "A: And I was so relieved because one of my sons very much looks like my family. My\nother son is very much like his dad's family. And Brian always said I'm fine. I don't\nneed the checkups and stuff. And I said you have to get a checkup.",
        "A: Because I thought my grandfather died of a heart attack. And my father had his first\nheart attack when he was in his 50s. And so I was and Brian finally had his wife made\nhim have a checkup. And he wrote to me he lived in different places. He's been part of\ncorporate America. And he wrote to me and said or he called me and he said mom, my\nheart's perfect. So and then of course my aunt told me, oh, no, your grandfather\ncommitted suicide. Best news I ever had.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, yeah, when my father was three years old, he was a child late in life. He was\npretty much raised by an older brother who was already 20 when",
        "A: when Dad was a little boy.",
        "A: Well, yes, I was in school in Germany, and it was certainly not a Jewish school. Very\nnot long before I was sent away. I had to change schools. And I believe it was very\nscary in those times. But until then it didn't really affect me. My mother, of course, but\nshe never would have told me.",
        "A: Yes, about the precarious situation we were in Germany. And as I have studied\nhistory and learned, I was appalled at how my father could have kept us there. He could\nhave left.\nMy mother had a huge family and they all left in early '30s, up to '37 and they settled in\nAmsterdam. They were in the tobacco business, and continued their business in\nAmsterdam. And my mother wanted to leave, but my father in retrospect, I understand,\nthat my father knew that he would have to start life all over again if he left Germany\nbecause he was an attorney and a judge in Germany, and German law is based on Roman\nlaw. And",
        "A: if he went to England or the United States, he could not practice law.",
        "A: And he was a very arrogant man. Like I said, this is happening to all of the other\nJews, not me. SoI I don't remember doing much with my parents except for when my\nfather bought a car, we used to on Sundays, go out into the suburbs, I guess, and I\nremember buying ice on a stick that was, you know, it was quite new.",
        "A: In the late '30s.",
        "A: And, yeah. But I, now looking back, my father lived such an affluent life. But most\npeople in Germany didn't have cars in the '30s.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, it was inflation. And my father did tell me that during he went to\nHeidelberg to college and he told he told of times when they had to take boxes of money\nto the store, you know, because of the inflation.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don't believe he ever really suffered from it because he had lots of money.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: He would not believe it. My parents I have at home albums, many of them of my\nparents' trips. They went mountain climbing and they went to Pompeii for a wedding\ntrip. And my father was an amateur photographer. And he had photographs of\neverything. They went on many, many trips; never with children.",
        "A: Yes, my father was in court on the morning of the Kristanoff. And he was arrested\nright in court. I mean, he was taken. His original law partner who was also a good friend\nwas aman by the name of Dr. Sieveking who, of course, that's the first thing my mother\ncalled when she found out Dad was gone. And he went there's a concentration camp\nright near Hamburgh which is called Neuengamme, and I understand that my that Dr.\nSieveking traced back to where my father was, went to Neuengamme, and told him you\ncan't have this man. Brought him home. I remember my father coming home and who\nwas he was always this beautifully dressed, clean cut gorgeous man and he came back\nhome. His head was shaved and he was ghast looked horrible. He was only in a camp\nfor a short while. And Dr. Sieveking came over the Nazis, the same time my father was\narrested and taken, my mother, of course, didn't know for quite a while what happened to\nhim, but the SS troops came into our home and searched everything and pushed us\naround. It was just me and my mother by that time. I remember I think it was probably\nquite early that we could no longer have maids or nannies so",
        "A: I remember how my mother cried when Kata (ph) was this nanny, I guess, who was\nalways with us. And then we had a cook and they all had to leave. And my mother didn't\nlearn how to cook until she came over to the United States. But so we were alone, my\nmother and I were alone. My brother had already been sent to England. And then Dr.\nSieveking came back. It was very frightening when the Nazis went through our\napartment, and messed around, you know, pushed us around. But then Dr. Sieveking\nbrought my dad back and oh, my, he looked terrible. And he took over, Dr. Sieveking, he\nsaid Eleanor is going on the Kindertransport. He took care of the whole thing. And he\nafter I was gone, I he arranged for my parents to go to Amsterdam. He even had the car\ntransported to Amsterdam because he knew my father could sell it for money. By the\nway, he was not Jewish. Dr. Sieveking, who he was the son of a former mayor of\nHamburgh and apparently my father and he was very close, law partners.",
        "A: Sieveking is a \"Z\"",
        "A: I think. Sieveking. I have papers at home, yeah. And there's a Sieveking Platz in\nHamburg, very famous people. And so anyway he got me on the Kindertransport. He\ntold my mother exactly what to put in the suitcase and a little one. And",
        "A: Would you believe a muff. I remember my parents my mother always had little\ncoats and hats made with a matching muff. Why they sent a muff I don't know.",
        "A: Yes, it was. And it was November, you know. I think I left I was told that I left on\nthe first Kindertransport from Hamburgh.",
        "A: Very early December.",
        "A: Yeah. And I as I remember, there were warm clothes and but I don't remember a\nwhole lot. I think there was a doll, but I could have just been imagining that. It was the\nwhole trip was kind of vague. I know I remember it wasn't so horrendous for me\nbecause I was used to being sent places. For holidays, they would put me on a train or\nsomething like that with a nanny. And I went places so_ horrible life, really when you\nthink back on it. But so it was I remember being with all of these children, and I\nremember when we went it could have been through Holland, before we crossed the\nchannel and the train, all of a sudden, opened the windows and people reached in and\ngave us oranges and things.",
        "A: Yeah. And I remember that very clearly, and everybody was joyous.",
        "A: Yeah. Like I say, I was used to being sent away for holidays and things. I, at one\ntime, it came back to me in memory. My parents lived a very adult life. And at one time\nI was sent to a summer camp where we were abused and I had to sit on a potty until I had\na BM no matter what and oh, it was horrible. And I apparently would talk to my mother\non the phone or I I must have been five years old or something. But anyway somehow\nand they didn't believe me. They didn't, you know, they never really believed me until all\nof a sudden all the parents came, and the camp was closed.",
        "A: Yes, because I was not the only one apparently, you know. And finally they got, oh, I\nremember that was so horrible. But never really having holidays with your parents. I\nremember going to Belgium on a beach where they had the little houses, you know,\ncanvass little things, and I was always there with nannies.",
        "A: I don't know how I got there; probably with the car, I don't know.",
        "A: I think Dr. Sieveking was there. I don't remember my dad, but my mother, my\nmother.",
        "A: No, he was sent to Holland. My mother and her siblings had promised to my\ngrandparents that they will always take care of Walter. And my grandmother died in '37,\nmy mother's mother. And my grandfather died about six months later of a broken heart\nkind of. He just couldn't make it alone. And so which was very good because he died\nbefore that but so it was when my grandparents were so sick and passed on that my\nUncle Walter was sent to Holland.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And very interesting story, but I won't even go into it. There's a book written about\nhim because he was murdered by a famous Dutch playwright.",
        "A: During the war.",
        "A: Avery famous man. Many lawsuits and I've been in Holland, though they found me.\nOh, Von Von it will come to me.",
        "A: But anyway I remember only the oranges that were given to us through the windows.",
        "A: No, personally not. I could say that I do, but I have seen movies and things of it, but I\ndon't remember. Maybe I fell asleep. I don't know. I don't remember being frightened\nuntil we got to I believe it was London. And I remember standing 1n the railway station\nthere where the train was going and on the deck, I guess they call it. And people were\nstanding there and just taking kids, you know. And an elderly couple I was very small\nfor my age. I was eight years old. And an elderly couple took me, took me home with\nthem. And I came from great affluence and these were people that were very nice and\nloving, but they didn't have the central heating, and they lived a very simple life. And I\nremember being very tired, and they had a bed for me and they heated the bed oh, God, it\nwas cold. They heated the bed with an old First World War canteen, metal one filled",
        "A: So, anyway that's why oh, by the way, when we moved to Seattle, and we moved to\nthe house, my father said okay, now that you're Jewish, you better go to religious school.\nSo he he made me go to temple _ Sunday school. Well, now you don't have a very\ngood time in Sunday school if your parents don't belong to the temple. So and I didn't\nhave the right clothes and I started going to Sunday school at the age of probably 11 or\n12, I don't know, 11, maybe. And I didn't know any Hebrew. And by that time those\nkids had all learned stuff. And teachers couldn't understand why I was so stupid. And it\nwasn't a very good experience. So I remember after awhile, I had to take the bus to\nSunday school and I would take the bus, and I would not get off at Sunday school. I\nwould go on downtown Seattle and walk around and watch my time and then come back\nhome at the right time. So that I didn't even go. So in high school I have not terribly\ngood memories of all of that. I was geography, I have never been terribly good at math,\nbut geography and history is what I loved. Let's see",
        "A: Probably. I don't know but, you know, my brother was, like I said, this incredibly\nintelligent kid and he when my father did buy a car in Seattle, and Eric taught himself\nhow to fix cars. And long before he was able to drive, old enough to drive, he was a\nnight manager then it was a McKale's gas station. McKale's doesn't exist anymore, but it\nwas a chain. Here was this kid who not old enough to drive but he was the night\nmanager of a gas station. The house that we bought was built at the turn of the century,\nand still had gas lamps up in the attics. And my brother rewired things so that we have\nlights and stuff. And so my mother I would my father used it was awful. My father\nused the phone for business. And if I had a date boys could call, and he'd say I'm busy,\nboom. And I remember threatening my father once. I said if you don't let me use the\nphone, I will call the phone company and tell them you're using it for business instead of,\nyou know, a home phone. He looked at me like who the hell are you, you know? That's\nwhy I left. I was never home. And when Art moved into the houseboat, I was there most\nof the time. But my mother I remember when I of course my brother was in the service\nfor a short time, and then he started college, too. But my mom taught was going to teach\nme how to drive.",
        "A: Yeah, I never was close to my dad, my mother, yeah. And one day Eric's friend, Ted,\nwho used to work on cars with him who lived on the street, saw us. And when Eric came\nhome, he said I saw your sister. Your mom is teaching her to drive. Oh, he blew up. He\ntold my mom in no uncertain terms that if you continue to teach Eleanor how to drive, I\nwon't fix the cars anymore.",
        "A: My brother because he was the one who kept everything going.",
        "A: Yeah, he didn't want me to screw things up or whatever.",
        "A: Well, we did",
        "A: just for a while, when we were alone in England, but, no, Eric could do everything\nbetter than I could. And he was so anyway, I didn't learn how to drive until I had two\nchildren but, yeah, I have never forgiven him for that, to tell you the truth. I told his kids\nthat. They couldn't believe it. But he was kind of a difficult father when he raised his\nown kids, my brother was.",
        "A: He has really mellowed now. But, yeah, very much like our father, the apple doesn't\nfall far from the tree.",
        "A: Umhum.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. One of his daughters, he threw out of the house, my brother did.",
        "A: She came back. But she was into drugs and this stuff and had an abortion. No, I was\na super mom, I was the girl scout leader, and the boy scout volunteer. And I volunteered\nfor the all of the sports teams. And I went to every baseball game. And I was the room\nmother in school.",
        "A: The PTA president. And I volunteered in the health clinic and all of that. But I\nthought my kids were the absolute most fantastic thing in the world.",
        "A: And see, you know, and my husband said he always resented the fact that the kids\ncame first. And so I probably wasn't the greatest wife, but I said, yeah, I said, they didn't\nask to be born, and my kids always came first.",
        "A: Yes, she denied everything. I tried, but it was hopeless. And since my father died so\nearly, I would only make her unhappy. And she depended on me. And she adored my\nchildren, and she adored my husband after she learned to know him.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. And so by nine we got married in 1950, and those early years we lived\nway out. Oh, I we were both going to college when we were engaged, and I found a\nplace he was busy. He was going to school, Art was, and he was working at Boeing on\nthe fields. So he never had any time to look for an apartment or anything. I found an\napartment. It was $55 a month. It was on the top floor of an old wooden building in\nSeattle. And I paid the rent for the first period. And I think we were pretty happy. What\nhappened was [remember well, the Korean war broke out very shortly after we got\nmarried. And Art was in the Navy reserve. He's a Pearl Harbor survivor. I don't know if\nI mentioned that.",
        "A: Yeah, Pearl Harbor survivor. Married a Holocaust survivor and Art I told him, I\nsaid, I don't want to be alone. I mean, here I was starting this new family in my new life,\nyou know. And I was never happy as a child. And so we were pretty happy together.\nAnd I said I don't want to be alone. I want to get pregnant. And he said you're too\nyoung, and I said yeah, but you're not. He was 29. And soI did. I got pregnant on __.\nAnd so by that time, he graduated. And he transferred from being an inspector on the\nfield to being engineer. He took a big wage cut.",
        "A: Cut in those days. Yeah. Quickly worked out but so I got pregnant. And I was still\nworking at the hospital at that time because I could walk back and forth.\nAnd then Boeing his papers came. We knew being chief radarman in the navy, that he\nwould be called back. And Boeing said we need him more than the Navy. So Art I\nremember saying well, I'm going to lose my reserve status and any benefits that I'll have.\nAnd I said I don't care. I'm not going to be alone here. You're not going in the service.\nAnd he didn't want to go anyway. So he left the reserves and worked as an engineer for\nBoeing for 38 years. And we lived in the third floor in that apartment. And I remember\ncoming home on a very hot day in April. And I was huffing and puffing, trying to get up\nthose stairs and I was exhausted. And Art was always working. And by that time Boeing\nwas gearing up for the war. He was always working late. And I layed down on the bed\nexhausted, and my water broke. And I called my mom and she took me to the hospital\nand then finally Art came. And so Steve was born. And then I was I said I have worked\nall of my life and gone to school, one baby is not enough to keep me busy. I was bored.\nSo I said I wanted another baby. And of course I said you're nuts, but okay. So we had\nanother one, 22 months apart and just before while I was pregnant with the second one,\nsome friend of ours found an apartment for us, which was a lower duplex in an area that\nwas already pretty much going black, but not completely. And it was very reasonably\npriced. The lady just wanted some nice people on the lower floor. It was a big\napartment. And we moved there and I didn't have to go three flights anymore. And we\nlived there very happily, and we had friends. And I remember that there was a really old\nlady who lived upstairs, and she was very nice. We didn't see her often. And while I was\nin the hospital having Brian, she died.",
        "A: Yes. She died, and Art came to the hospital. In those days, you stayed in the hospital\nfor several days, you know.",
        "A: And so she wanted whitey oh, no, no, no, she sold it to black people, and she wanted\nwhitey out right now. No, the black people wanted it. They didn't give us any time. And\nso my father I of course I couldn't drive with a brand new baby, but my oldest child\nwould stay with my mother. I had the baby. And my father said we'll have to go house\nhunting. And by that time, we had been saving some money, and for a down payment\nyou could get houses on the GI bill, and we drove way out, which was considered in\nthose days really way out. And we found a house that I liked. And I came home and I\ntold Art, and the next day he had off. We went out there. And there were houses that\nwere upstairs and downstairs and all on one floor. Well, we didn't have enough money\nfor the down payment for the one what do you call it, all on one floor. But we bought\nthe one with an upstairs. It was fairly steep. And my father had a fit. By that time, you\nknow, he says I had two little boys, and he said you can't have the upstairs, it will be\nhotter terribly hot in the summer, and the boys will fall down the stairs, you just can't do\nthat. How why did you buy that? And so Art says well, we didn't have enough money\nfor the all on one floor. How much do you need? And he gave us some money\nimmediately. Go out and change it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, go out and changed it. He adored my boys and he kind of mellowed over the\nyears and so we went out and bought the one all on one floor. And my parents, they\nwould like as my boys got older, they took them each at one one at a time on little trips\nto Mount Rinear or some lake or something for a little hike.\nAnd by that time Steve told me this recently, my father was already quite weak with his\nheart problem. And he said, he would sit on the bench somewhere while mom and my\nson would go hiking around. So he has those good memories, and so does Brian, but my\ndaughter was younger, Audrey, and so Dad died in 1958. And the strange thing 1s that I\nhad three children. And right after Dad died, I found out I was pregnant, and I was pretty\nupset. I didn't want to have anymore kids. But then all of a sudden I thought oh, maybe,\nyou know, you get this crazy idea, maybe God meant for this child to make up for your\ndad dying.",
        "A: So because by that time we had moved to a bigger house and we had a dishwasher.\nAnd [| had three children in school, and I got pregnant again, but I just I talked about\nabortion, but my mother my husband said absolutely no. So anyway I had JoDean, and\nshe turned out to be the most wonderful little girl in the world.",
        "A: No, she's the older daughter.",
        "A: JoDean is the one with all of the long hair there.",
        "A: Well, she lightens it, yes.",
        "A: Two boys and two girls.",
        "A: Very much so. And I thought about that, and I actually kind of resented that, you\nknow. And I thought they never were that close to me, you know. But I got over it. I\ndidn't let 1t bother me too much because I was too busy having all of those kids, and after\nthe war, you know, you had cooperative play groups, and I was always involved with the\nkids and baseball teams. And I went to all of the games. Four kids kept me plenty busy,\nyeah.",
        "A: Yeah. So actually my father I felt he was pretty pathetic as he got older because he\nwas a broken man. He lost his profession. He lost his station, his status in the world.",
        "A: And it was hard. I understand that now, but a young person thinks only of himself.\nSo life just progressed and I oh, when I was in the hospital having Audrey, that's the one\nthat was here, Art I remember there was a congregation, a reform congregation that was\njust starting up, and a lot of young couples with children. And Art came to the hospital\nand said now you're going we had talked about it. You're going to have to make up your\nmind. I was very ambivalent about Judaism, et cetera. And we had our Christmas tree\nstill. And Art told me, he said if we're going to join this temple, I want to be one of the\noriginal members. And we have to do it right now because they're signing the charter.\nAnd I was I had just had Audrey. And I said okay, do what you want. And so we joined\nthe temple and we were very active. It was a lovely time. Art taught Sunday school.\nAnd he didn't know a whole lot, but he learned fast.",
        "A: Well, Art's father was he knew a lot, but he was one step ahead of the czar. And he\ncame to the United States at the turn of the century. And there were five brothers. They\nhad a stolen passport, and the story I got was the first one would come and send the\npassport back. And I found out many, many years after I married him that his family\nname was actually Polits (ph). And it came from somewhere in Poland originally, but he\nwas in Russia, and he was a communist, very much so. But also they had programs and\nhe was Jewish, and so they would send the passport back and forth. And the name on the\npassport was Rabalovitch (ph) which turned out to be Rafalovitch (ph) so when and they\nall stayed in the east whereas Art's father got on the railroad and worked his way west\nand settled into Tacoma, Washington, which is 30 miles from Seattle, and that's where\nArt grew up. And when I was not married yet, I was still engaged. At one time I went to\nsee to Tacoma and Art's sister had done very well or husband was in the jewelry\nbusiness, and they had quite a bit of money. And so Julia Rolfe from New York came to\nvisit my sister in law. And she called me and you have to come and meet her. And I said\nRolfe? And she said oh, yes, the New York part of the family all changed their name to\nRolfe. And I said well, I don't want to be Rafalovitch (ph) I told Art. I said get your\nname changed. I want to you know, on your degree, he was still in school. And on our\nmarriage license, we're going to be Rolfe. Art had never known there was a New York\nfamily.",
        "A: Yes. There were quite a few. And it's really interesting. But anyway, we changed\nour name to Rolfe. And my children are very happy. They would never have liked that\nname. Anyway it wasn't a family name.",
        "A: Rolfe is a nice name. But that's how we got that name, and it's an English name and\npeople always ask are you related to so and so Rolfe? No. So that was done before we\ngot married. And I was thinking of something, but the thought just left me.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. We joined the temple and Steve went to Sunday school and he came home.\nWe joined the temple in May and that that December, Steve my son is very adamant.\nHe gets that from his dad, I guess. He said we can't have a Christmas tree. That is\nmaking fun of Christian symbols. And Brian was really angry. He liked the Christmas\ntree. From that day on we didn't have a Christmas tree.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, how old was Steve? Was 19 the winter of 1956. He had just started\nreligious school. And the teacher said, you know, we don't have Christmas trees so\nnaturally I know that Brian resented that. And I know that when Brian got married they\nalways had Christmas trees. But he didn't marry a Jewish person anyway. Steve what\nSteve said kind of was the law. So we were really Jewish. But I didn't have a\nbackground. So I didn't know all of the prayers and everything.",
        "A: Yes. Well, the Jewish there were quite a few refugees coming everywhere, every\ncity. All of the Jewish communities were helping. No, my father had no no use for\nreligion at all. And, no, they never attended the temple, but they thought it was proper\nfor me to go to Sunday school. But my brother about that time was was beyond the bar\nmitzvah age or just about that. And he wasn't about to get involved with that. So he was\nnever made to go to Sunday school, only I was.",
        "A: And oh, my goodness, I think as I remember, we did have a Christmas tree in Seattle.\nAnd I think we used the Menorah also because we had this big we had both. But I don't\nremember very joyous Christmases. My mother was befriended by a lot of Quakers\nwhen we first came to the United States in Seattle. And there was one wonderful thing\nthat I remembered to this day, the Quakers had on New Year's, they had New Year's\ncallers.",
        "A: New Year's callers. And every New Year's a different family would host, and they\nusually had about five or six homes that were hosts. And the New Year's callers it was a\nfairly large group would go to all of them, one after another and talk and enjoy the new\nyear and then go to the next New Year's callers. And I understand they do that in Canada\ntoday.",
        "A: It was very lovely. And my mother had these Quaker friends. She belonged to the\n\"Jewish club of Washington,\" a bunch of German Jews. And every once in a while I\nwould meet some of these people or I would go with her, and I vowed that I was never\ngoing to marry a German Jew",
        "A: I didn't like them. I don't know. It was very typical, children should be seen and not\nheard. Very arrogant. I mean, totally opposite of the way I looked at having children. I\nmean, they were the greatest things ever that I ever created. I thought they were just\nabsolutely wonderful. And maybe it's because nobody ever thought I was wonderful.\nAnd so it's a really strange thing that Steve, when he got married he would didn't get\nmarried",
        "A: My oldest son, and he didn't marry a Jewish girl. But Gail wanted to go to Nova\nScotia for a honeymoon. Don't ask me why. She just wanted to see Nova Scotia. So\nGail came from Boston and so for their honeymoon trip, they visited her folks, of course,\nand they had a big wedding and her folks came and but anyway they went to Nova\nScotia. And I don't know how I think I just lost my train of thought.\nEnd of File One\nBeginning File Two",
        "A: No, I didn't. I didn't. My brother had no religious background to speak of. And so\neventually he went to Reed College and then he got he went to Reed College, and then\nhe had a scholarship to a program for government employment, political science up in\nupstate New York, and he had a full scholarship for that. And then he went to work for\nthe federal government. And he ended up being deputy director of the Environmental\nProtection Agency. So he worked his way up very high in the government. And then\nwhen he retired he had two years of he had to sign a clause that he could not work in\nindustry, that he represented the government, you know, for two years, a noncompetition\nclause because he was the one who put all the emission controls on our vehicles. And so\nhe went to teach at Purdue University for two years and then he went to work for asa\nconsultant for Mazda and Ford in their emission control. And, of course, my mother\nadored him. Somebody at the door?",
        "A: Are you on?",
        "A: You asked me if I became a practicing Jew.",
        "A: Well, you know, although I had no background in Judaism, I would do anything for\nmy children and, yes, we joined the temple. She had just been born. And the boys went\nto religious school. And it was a great group. We were all young parents. And we had a\nlot of friends there. And we had parties, and 1t was good. And I learned to be Jewish.",
        "A: No, I don't think she ever went with us to temple. My father was still alive. I have\ngot that was 1956. And then Dad died in '58. And oh, about that time, we needed a\nbigger house again. And I remember being at a party and somebody said well, Ellie's\nmoving and is she going to have a dishwasher? And I said would she be moving without\na dishwasher? Because I didn't have one in my first home. And it was nice. Everybody\nhad their own room. And it was a nice house. And then my mother, of course, she was a\nwidow by then, and she took up skiing. And she went to she didn't ski very well, but she\nand her friends, they went to Sun Valley, and she fell in the pool. She told everybody it\nwas on the hill, but she fell 1n the pool and she tore all of her I think she tore her ACL\nligaments. And so she was in a cast, and so naturally she had to move in with us for quite\na while until she was healed. And then we had to get her by that time, the house, the\nfamily house that I grew up in was completely surrounded by black folks. And it was a\ndifferent time than now, you know. And it was difficult, so we insisted that Mom move.\nAnd we found her an apartment in the suburbs. And then as the years passed by, we had\na nice time in the house we lived in. Lots of neighborhood parties. We had progressive\ndinners and I was very happy there. And we belonged to the temple. We belonged to a\nswim club. We had a good life.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Very good. And all of a sudden well, all of a sudden well, we oh, God, Art was\nstarted to travel, but Boeing in Seattle, we had a recession like now. And Boeing\ninsisted that Art had to move to Alabama and because there were no jobs in Seattle. I\nremember there was a poster somebody put up, the last person that leaves Seattle, turn\nout the lights, yeah. So anyway I resisted, but I didn't have a choice. I mean I couldn't\nsupport four children. So we went to by that time I was very, very close to my mother.\nWe all were. And so we moved to Alabama. And I remember Art had to go in January.\nHe took one car, and he flew back. And we went in June after school was out. By that\ntime we were all skiing a lot. And even JoDean who was really little, she turned out to be\neven today keeps up her accreditation as an instructor. I remember we drove I drove the\nkids to ski resorts while Art was in Alabama. And I had a white station wagon with\nbright red license plates, Alabama license plates.",
        "A: I don't know if they're bright red still, but they were at that time. And people would\nlook at that in the parking lot and say Alabama? I said when you live in Alabama, you\ngot to go a long way to ski.",
        "A: Well, you know, he could license the car and then we didn't have to buy two licenses.\nSo instead of Washington, we bought Alabama. So then we went to Alabama. We\ndrove, and we went by way of Disneyland and it was a pretty good trip. And along the\nway, we became more affluent. The kids the school were terrible.",
        "A: Yes. So I insisted on the kids going to private school. And I had I had argued with\nmy husband about that, but you see my husband is was very, very intelligent and he did\nvery well. He learned very well in public school because he just read all of the books\nthey had, but anyway I won and unfortunately I would have had to send Steve to\nBirmingham because there was no private high school and I couldn't do that yet. There\nwas no way I was going to send my son to a different city. And so the three younger\nones went to this very, very good private school and it made a terrific difference. Even\ntoday my son, Brian, says that made me realize that I had some brains. And JoDean was\nborn in November. And she used to say Phoebe gets to go to school. She called him\nBarney gets to go to school, Onnie (ph) gets to go to school. I never get to go to school.\nSo there was no public kindergarten. And so at first I put her in a basket on my bike, and\nwe went to all sorts of places, and we had a good time. I was alone most of the time in\nAlabama so because Art was working, in New Jersey. Boeing had a habit of doing that,\nbut so I decided I started her in private kindergarten a year earlier.",
        "A: No. It was there was no public kindergarten in Alabama. It was all private. So it\nwas in a church and people said aren't you ashamed of lying in church, that she's actually\nfive when she wasn't? And I said it doesn't matter to me whether I lied in church or\nanyplace else. So she oh, that was kind of interesting. The by the time we were in\nHuntsville, Alabama, all of the German scientists had come there. Wernher von Braun\nwas living in Alabama and all of his cohorts. I found that very difficult. They were\nobnoxious. I remember going to the supermarket, and they talked very loud in German,\nand obviously that bothered me, but Wernher von Braun's daughter was at Randolph\nSchool, which I said it was a very, very good private school, and dated my son, I believe.\nThey went to parties together once, yeah, just once. And, of course, he Brian didn't drive\nyet in those days. Brian has always been a social person. I remember I would drive him\non dates and take him places and pick him up. But they were a lot of Germans in that\nschool, weren't there? Umm?",
        "A: Oh, I had a fit probably, yeah. Can you imagine? But you know the American\ngovernment brought all of those people to our country, yeah. And that's where Redstone\nArsenal is. I always felt that they brought us they could have done this in other parts of\nthe country, but they brought us northerners to the south to integrate the south. I always\nfelt that. We were being used to integrate the south. It was a difficult time. I remember\nthat Brian no, Steve had to go to public high school. He was in the band. And the band\nwas invited to go to play for Lurleen Wallace's inauguration at what's the name of the\ncity, Audrey?\nAudrey: ___",
        "A: No, no, in the coast.\nAudrey: Mobile.",
        "A: Huh huh.\nAudrey: Mobile.",
        "A: No. I'll think of it, but anyway wherever they were\nAudrey: Montgomery.",
        "A: Montgomery. They were going to Montgomery and the Huntsville High School band\nwas going to play at Lurleen Wallace's inauguration. Now, this woman was running for\ngovernor because her previous the previous governor was her husband and he couldn't\nrun anymore, you know, only so many terms. Well, they get on a bus and Steve comes\nfrom the west. He really we never found any anti Semitism in the west. I was the one\nwho came from that background, but not my children. They started out and nobody\nwould let them go to the bathroom. I mean, the Huntsville High School band was mostly\nblack. It was integrated. And that was integrated and that was our schools that was the\ngovernment, city, you know? So Steve said that he learned a lot about discrimination.",
        "A: Interesting. And so he never really felt any discrimination as a Jew growing up\nbecause we lived in the west. And I'm sure that the people you see my father refused to\nstay in New York because he wanted to he was going be an immigrant, he wasn't going\nto be in New York with all of those other Jews. So we were assimilated and he it was\ndifficult. When they got to Montgomery, they wouldn't even seat them. And so the bus\nturned around and came back to Huntsville. That was a good lesson for Steve.\nUnbelievable, though difficult times.",
        "A: Yeah, I mean\nAudrey: 1966.",
        "A: Yeah, that was it's really interesting. I just recently saw films about that, you know,\nthey turned the hose on black kids that tried to go to school. It was awful. I hated\nHuntsville. My mother came all the time. We were close to my mother in those I mean\nshe the most important thing in my mother's life was her children, her grandchildren so",
        "A: Yeah. I kind of resented that, but that's the way it was. So when we lived when we\nfirst came to Huntsville, We lived in an apartment. We had to build a house. There\nwasn't anything there and there were three bedrooms, a bedroom for Art and me,\nbedroom for the boys, and a bedroom for the girls, and Paula came home. And so we had\nto walk over beds, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. She adored my children, you know. Interesting, isn't it?",
        "A: People change, yes. So I have always kind of felt like I was in the outside looking in\nwhen I was supposed to be Jewish, I wasn't Jewish enough. I didn't have the right\nclothes. When we came to Seattle, the council of Jewish women, there were a number\nyou know immigrants came west. And they had a big dinner for us, for the new\nimmigrants. And I remember long tables at this temple. And we went there and they the\ntable decorations were little figures like from Fiddler On The Roof.",
        "A: In those kind of clothes. My brother who was typically arrogant, like his father, took\none look at those and, you know, depicting immigrants and thinking oh, he says we're not\nstaying. He was just so angry. I remember that. And my father looked at that, and then\nhe realized that Eric said, no, I can't look at those figures, and we left. But in those days,\nthere was people always discriminated against each other. And there was a large\npopulation of Jews from the Isle of Rose.",
        "A: Spanish Jews, Sephardic Jews, very large Sephardic Jews that came in the early part\nof the 1900s and it was large. And in those days if the Ashkenazic Jews, they\ndiscriminated against the Sephardic Jews. I remember the very first I heard a family\nactually would sit shiva if their daughter or son married a Sepharic Jew.",
        "A: And the concept of discrimination, this was just unbelievable in my mind. So at one\ntime the first year my brother was at the University of Washington he transferred the\nsecond year to Reed College. He was, of course, on the newspaper staff. And he wrote\nan article. Race relations were terrible in the '60s. He wrote an article in the University\nof Washington Daily. And he wrote that I think I still have the article in a file that the\nonly hope for peace and happiness was between the races and to get rid of this animosity\nfor complete mingling of the races, intermarriage. Oh, my God.",
        "A: Signed by Eric Stark (ph). Our phone never stopped ringing. My parents said how\ncan you write that? Oh, my gosh.",
        "A: Very controversial. Yes. And then after my parents got used to my marrying\nsomething of Russian background, and they loved Art because he's a wonderful man.",
        "A: Arthur.",
        "A: Arthur. And he doesn't have a middle name. They didn't bother with middle names\nin those days. Yeah, Arthur. And what was I going to say?",
        "A: Oh, yes. In 1952 I got married in '50. In 1952, Art met Dorothy, and we heard about\nhis girlfriend, that turned out to be a finace\u00e9. He lived here in Washington D.C. He was\nworking for the government. And he would he told my mother none of us went to the\nwedding. Dorothy is part American Indian.",
        "A: She's a wonderful woman. And my mother told me don't you ever, ever tell anybody\nthat Dorothy has American Indian heritage. I think her father was white. The mother\nwas, you know she came from a family of 13 children. And my brother was at that time\nhe had moved to the Department of Indian affairs. She was a secretary there.",
        "A: Yes. And, you know, I told you that my parents discriminated against my husband\nbecause he had a Russian background, and then the idea that my brother would marry\nsomebody American Indian.",
        "A: Of course everybody loved each other in the end.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: What is that noise?",
        "A: Oh, oh. They're applauding. I think so. I was alone. I was alone at the age of 8.\nAnd I went to a foreign country where I didn't know the language. And then when I got\nto the school, I was kind of discriminated against because they found out I had parents\nthat were alive.",
        "A: Yeah. And I think from that I was always alone and being, yeah, I was used to being\nalone and little. I was always small. And some people made lifelong friends when they\nwere in England. I did not. No. I think about it. And when at first, they talked about\nsurvivors. I never thought of myself as a survivor, you know, because I wasn't in a camp,\nbut then they said, you know, we are. Like I said, I talked to the lady who made the film,\nmy knees were jumping. That film was shown in the Seattle Jewish film festival 12 years\nago. I told Melissa that. And she remembered that. It was shown in a large auditorium.\nAnd [| had read in the newspaper it was going to be shown. And I told Art, we got to go.\nAnd we went. Have you ever seen that film?",
        "A: In one of the pictures, 1t was a string of girls dancing and I said, Art, there's _. He\nsays, yeah, because my father had taken so many pictures. He was, you know, a\nphotographer. I mean, he took pictures of everything. And so we had a lot of pictures of\nme as a little girl. So Millis Hacker (ph) asked if there was anybody in the audience who\ncame on the Kindertransport. And I raised my hand. And I was the only one. And\nafterwards I ran down because we were quite a ways up. And I talked to her. And she\ntold me about KTA. I had no idea. Living in the west I had no idea there was an\norganization I didn't have any Jewish connections except the temple. And so Melissa\ntold me about the international KTA Association. And she took my name. And within a\nweek or so, I got stuff in the mail from Kindertransport. Now there was no\nKindertransport group in Seattle, but there was it's a group of child survivors, you know.\nI got to go to the bathroom.",
        "A: Are you done? {Recess} Yeah, my father, when I moved when my mother died, we\nmoved boxes and boxes of papers to our house. And when we downsized two years ago\nto a retirement community, I started going through all of our papers and one my son in\nlaw, Audrey's husband, is very interested in that. And he sometimes comes from\nColorado and he goes through stuff. He finds it amazing. And my grandson one\ngrandson is living in Freiburg, Germany and he graduated with three degrees from\nmy family has done very well in the United States, very well. My brother was high up in\nthe American government, and his daughter one daughter was in charge of\ncommunications for the Library of Congress. She was head of that. And the other one is\ninvolved with her husband in contracting and has done very well. And so my oldest\ngrandson is a geophysicist, and an amazing person. And they're lovely children. I was\nwith my daughter every time she had a baby, and so I'm close to her boys. And the\nmiddle one graduated with a degree in German and applied physics and in math from\nTrinity University where he had a full scholarship. And now he is in Freiburg working\non his master's. And the younger one, like I said, is at American University, and my\ndaughter just went to pick him up at the metro station. They'll be here shortly. So but\nanyway, my son in law and Mark have been going through my father's papers. He\nworked trying to get other people who were stranded in different countries to get them in\nthe United States. They were in Borneo. I don't know where all, you know. And I have\nall of those letters. He actually contacted somebody from Sear's Roebuck who apparently\nhad some connection somewhere because I found letters from them where he asked for\nmoney, and they always gave it to him to send to these people to get them into the United\nStates.",
        "A: Yeah. I have to check. Now, Mark just made copies. I have a what do you call it?\nIt's actually a book written on __+ typed, and very close together. And it's my cousin\nliving underground with her husband in Belgium. And it's written in German, so I my\nGerman isn't good enough for that.",
        "A: And I have that and unfortunately I didn't check to find out if she was alive until after\nshe died. And they eventually came to the United States, settled in Florida, and were in\nthe antique business and died in the very late '80s. And at that time I was too busy\nraising kids, and I never really thought of looking into it, but I have her book that she\nwrote. And I have interesting stuff. I don't know if anybody would be interested in photo\nalbums.",
        "A: My parents did a lot of mountain childing. And Mom told me about when they went\nto Pompeii for a trip, the guide said the woman cab looked down there but, yeah. I have\nsince traveled some. And it happened that you asked me about my Uncle Walter, he was\nsent then to Amsterdam to be with all of the other Itingers (ph) that had moved to\nAmsterdam, and when the news came that they would all be deported and sent to\nWesterbork, one of the uncles or something sent realized that Walter would never\nsurvive if they were sent to a concentration camp.",
        "A: And so he had some money, and he looked for someone who would take him in and\nshield him. And so there was an actress unfortunately, I don't have these names anymore\nin my mind, but anyway in the last many years I spent a lot of time going back and forth\nto Holland because what happened was the money was given to Audrey may be able to\nget the name. I can't seem to get the name into my mind. It will come back. And he was\nat that time a very young man. He became a famous movie producer in Holland. And\nwhat he did was he took the money and killed my uncle and threw him in the canal in a\nin a suitcase. And they found him and the it's an interesting story. The first policeman\non the case, on the scene, was a part of the resistance movement, and he would go out in\nthe fields. And I met all of these people in Holland because they're not Jews. And before\nthis grandfather died, I did meet him. And he would pick up the weapons that the British\ndropped out in the fields. And he would pick them up and put them underneath the baby\ncarriage with the baby on top and bring them to the priest who was collecting weapons.",
        "A: Really trying to get a resistance going, but it didn't work, of course, but so he was\naware of he was a first he was a policeman in Amsterdam. And he was the first one on\nthe scene. And he always knew that Walter was murdered. And anyway, he tried very\nhard to get this man convicted, and he just spent maybe a few months of jail, and that was\nit.",
        "A: Well, the baby in the baby carriage was told that, you know, you have to follow up on\nthis case. And I have a book about it. It's all in Dutch though. And you have to bring\nhim to justice. And so she eventually died of cancer. And as she was dying in the last\ndays, she told her son, Peter, that you have to follow this up for me and work on it. And I\nguess it was something the whole family always knew.\nWell, Peter Crowson then started his search and he he's an archivist in Amsterdam. He\nhas now been promoted. He 1s now the head archivist in Amsterdam. But at that time,\nthere were some writers who were looking into this murder also. It made a hell of a good\nstory. And so this author apparently came to the archives and talked to Peter and wanted\nsome information. And eventually they got together and he convinced Peter, although it\nwas difficult for him because it would have been he could have gotten fired, but anyway\nto join him in this search and",
        "A: Peter was just the son of this lady who was in the baby carriage.",
        "A: It was just passed down generations. And it was something that they wanted to\nunfortunately like I can't remember the name of the",
        "A: But he is a very famous man in Amsterdam who just threw recently has been\ndiscredited because he not only killed my uncle, he killed others. And he told Jews I'll\ntake care of your property and your money. And when you come back, you can have it.\nThose that came back, never heard of you.",
        "A: He was acrook. But anyway, he even tried to get a pension as a resistance person.\nAnd, of course, he was never he was turned down, and he sued people. And Peter is the\nman who finally he couldn't get anymore information about Walter and his family. So\nhe searched the Internet. And he searched the name Itinger (ph) which is my mother's\nmaiden name. And there were lots of Itingers (ph) because it's a Catholic name. So a lot\nof people said, never heard of tt.\nOne person, and it was my cousin's daughter who was working as a journalist in the\nColorado mountains for a local newspaper, responded to him and said I think I know\nwhat you're talking about. She called her dad. And her dad called me. And it was\ncoincidental that was in January of 1901. And I had made I was invited to go back to\nHamburg, you know, in the visitation program.",
        "A: Excuse me.",
        "A: 2001. And then I went to Hamburgh, and I had told Audrey they let me bring\nsomebody and I wanted you to come because Art said that he what was the purpose of\nhim learning all of this? Audrey will share it with the family, you know. Pass it down,\nbesides Audrey and I have always been close. And I didn't have the greatest marriage.",
        "A: I'd like to share this with someone from the Holocaust center eventually because it's\nan interesting story. They traced us, and my cousin, Peter, actually forbade me to go see\nthese people. He said what do they want from us? Do they want money? He was always\nsuspicious. Well, Peter Crowson is a man who [ had a gut feeling that he was honest. He\nwrote to me many, many e mail letters. And so we were in Hamburgh. And I agreed for\nhim to come and meet us. And he was going to drive to Hamburgh with his Arthur\nfriend, and they were going to drive us back to Amsterdam and actually he invited us to\nstay with him. My cousin, Peter, was livid and he said you can't do this. And I'm like\ndon't tell me what to do, but anyway this was amazing. So since 2001 over the years\nwe've gotten to know the person. And I've done many trips back to Amsterdam. And\nAudrey has come with me on a couple. My one grandson was studying in Delft, which is\nright next to Amsterdam. And it's become a home away from home. It's just amazing.\nAnd we actually got this man convicted.",
        "A: Yeah. Actually well, he's very old now, but what we tried to do was clear the record\nso that people would know what an awful person he was. He said he was a resistance\nhelper. He never was. He took money from Jews before they were sent to the camps and\nsaid he would save it for them and, of course, he never got it back. Artwork he actually\nto this day is living in a home that came from a wealthy Jew And my daughter will\nprobably remember. For some reason I have a total block now. But I have talked to\nauthors and journalists in Amsterdam. And we've communicated and it took us a long\ntime. Peter, who is when we write to Peter and his wife now, like I said, they're like\nfamily because they I told him my Aaron is coming to Delft, and you're going to love\nhim, and like Peter didn't tell me at the time. He said what does she think, I'm going to\nlove this American kid? And then afterwards, you know, Ellie, you're right, I love\nAaron. They're so close. So Peter, they had a baby. I met them long before she was\neven pregnant. And Aurora is six now and their little girl is called Aurora.",
        "A: Peter's. And I had invited them because I've stayed with them so often in Amsterdam.\nAnd I said you got to come to America. And so they came in July. And they came and\nthey spent a week with Audrey in Colorado. And they came and spent a week with me in\nSeattle in Bellevue. Then they went down to Huntington Beach which is very close to\nDisneyland. And they spent a week with my son, Brian. And he drove them back and\nforth. And they wanted to stay in Disneyland Hotel one night. And they came back to\nBrian. And then they flew back to Audrey's house in Colorado. They just had the most\nwonderful time in the United States. And like I said, we have a family in Amsterdam.\nThey are, of course, not Jewish, but we love each other dearly. And we met through this\ncase. And it's this man is of course, he's a liar, and he was very famous. And the thing\nthat he was trying to fight was that his name, you know, we wanted him to be known for\nwhat he was.",
        "A: I thought Audrey was coming back. I just can't remember. I noticed about six\nmonths ago that I was having trouble with remembering especially names. And so I think\nthis is part of the aging process.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And the I have the book. It's in Dutch. And I'm sure somebody at the Holocaust\nCenter can read it. And I could send you the book.",
        "A: I have quite a few copies of it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I never thought I was that interesting, you know.",
        "A: You're welcome.",
        "A: You're welcome. I have also been to Israel. And I met some of the relatives that\neventually went to Israel, and it was wonderful.",
        "A: I would like to go to Israel again. Well, thank you.\nEnd of File Two\nConclusion of Interview\n"
