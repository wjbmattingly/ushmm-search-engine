        "Answer: Thank you.",
        "Q: When we do interviews with survivors, we try to capture a life story of the person, not\nonly what happened to them at the during the Holocaust, but also to provide a context of\nwhat was their world like before all of this took place, and what happened after Holocaust\nto them. Here we are going to do it a little bit differently, but follow a similar pattern\nbecause we would really like to know a little bit about your family, your life, what your\nroots are, what were the forces and the factors that molded you. So I'll start with those\nquestions. Can you tell me where you were born, when you were born and who your\nparents were, and we'll take it from there.",
        "A: I was born in Warsaw, Poland on November 28th, 1948. My mother's name is __ +.\nShe married my father whose name was _ + and who was a Jew from Warsaw. Probably\na year or so I was born. And they have been my father spent the war in the Soviet\nUnion. He escaped Poland when the war started went towards the east. He been\ninvolved when the Soviet forces came there. And after he enrolled to the Soviet Army\nand from the Soviet Army he moved to the Polish Army in Soviet Union, which was run\nmostly by the communists, communist military. And my father before the war for oneyear was a student of the medicine in Warsaw. I think he was pretty intelligent and\ntalented man because was admitted to the medical academy and when _ + for the Jewish\nstudents. He was also in several communist youth organizations. And he was very _ +\nhow to tell over spoken. He was very _ + he was very present in the discussions in the\nintellectual life of this Jewish youth in Warsaw. He was collaborating as a child even\n__+when he was eight years old with the Jewish newspapers for the children and run by\nthe children who was created by _+ with called +. And so he participated as a young\njournalist in the production of this newspaper. When the war started he tried to convince\nhis family to also to move to __+. I think he felt that Poland can fall in the hands of the\nNazis and it was dangerous. But they didn't feel in the same way.",
        "Q: Was his family also were they a well to do family? Were they a working class\nfamily? Who were your grandparents?",
        "A: They been like lower middle class family. My grandparent was a tailor. They had\nenough money to educate the children, the boy. The boy was my father. But also my\naunt finished the gymnasium, the kind of the high school. And my other aunt, I don't\nknow exactly, but she was also anyway they been schooling the children with education,\nwas very important for them. But they were not wealthy. My grand grandmother was\nparalyzed, and she was living with them. And it was also one of the reasons why they\ncould not imagine to move from Warsaw.",
        "Q: So he had two siblings?",
        "A: Yes, he had two sisters. He was the only boy.",
        "Q: And was he the only one who moved east?\nA: Yes, and other ones stayed behind and _+died inthe war __+ except the one sister\nwho survived and she escaped the ghetto in peculiar way. She was transported out of the\nghetto in the coffin of her sister who died of pneumonia or tuberculosis so something like\nthat.",
        "Q: How did you hear the story. Did he tell you?",
        "A: My aunt told me the story. My father never spoke about it. He died when I was 13.\nAnd when he was alive, he never told me about the war, nothing. And never mentioned\n__+ family didn't know I didn't know what name what was the first name of my\ngrandparents. And after only after his death, my aunt started to tell me those stories, but\nI think they have been in some way traumatized. They didn't want to talk about it. They\ntalked among them. My aunt my aunt escaped ghetto, and then she contacted one family\nfriend, Polish guy was the engineer. And he was helping not only her, but also another\ncousin, two cousins, young girls who escaped from Vangloff (ph) which was some kind\nof a family town close to us. In Vangloff, my grandfather had four brothers and two\nsisters. No, three brothers, four boys and two sisters. One of the brothers immigrated to\nArgentina before the war, and three other brothers stayed, and then two sisters stayed in\nPoland. And they all died in the Holocaust. The most educated was Mendel who was, I\nthink, the lawyer. He stayed in Vangloff and was actually quite respectful citizen of the\ncity. He was in the city council and his daughter who survived and was in Argentina now\ntold me that he was as respected _+ birthday, the mayor of the city came to have the\ndinner with him. And they all have been hiding in the in their house, which was on the\nmain square in the attic. It was I don't know how many people exactly, probably 12 or15 or 16 people hiding there. After when the liquidation of the lock out Jewish\ncommunity. And they've been shot on the main square mainly. And he decided that he\ndoesn't want to hide anymore and he he went down and he like, you know, in some way\nfaced the squads and was talking apparently. The legend said was talking to the people,\nto the Jewish people that we have to do something. We have to try it, to die with dignity,\nthis kind of thing. The rest of the family remained for a few days more in the attic. And\nthen the younger boys, the younger decided that they have to try to save two girls, the\nyoungest girls, the daughter of Mendel and another cousin. And they've been blond and\nblue eyed so they decide they have the chance probably to survive. And they gave them\nthe address of this engineer, and then told them to go to a train station and try to go\nto Warsaw. The girls didn't want to leave the family. They've been crying and they've\nbeen they didn't want it. And so one of the brother of little Curstis(ph), this woman who\nis now in Argentina kicked them out, kicked them out from the stairs. And when little\n__+many years later told me the story, she was still angry with her brother that he did it.\nSo they've been walking through Vangloof. And I think everybody knew them in the\ncity. And they've been crying. And no one saw them, so it was some kind of, you know,\nmiracle. They came to the station. They took the train. They found the engineer. And\nthe engineer and my aunt from Warsaw ghetto probably she was already there. And she\nprovided the fake papers for my aunt and for older of those two girls, and the younger\ngirls been adopted by his fiancee.",
        "Q: The engineer's fianc\u00e9?\nA: Yes. Risha (ph) was her name. It means fiance's name. My aunt who looked quite\nJewish, she was wearing some kind of you know",
        "Q: Your father's sister?",
        "A: Yes, my father's sister, Marilka (ph).",
        "Q: Marilka. She decided and under the advice of this engineer also, another cousin\ndecided also to enroll as a volunteer to German, to the first labor. And I think it was\nchoice of several Jewish people there because they knew that the German don't recognize\nthe Jews and _ + claim the Jews, so they felt much safer in Germany than Poland.",
        "Q: Can I ask? Can I interrupt on this? You heard this story only after your father's\ndeath?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So until that time, all of this was incognito. It was completely unknown\u2019?",
        "A: Yes, I didn't know those stories before.",
        "Q: Were you",
        "A: I knew that my grandparents died, and I knew that my father had another sister who\ndied in the ghetto, but I didn't know the details. And I didn't know the names.",
        "Q: When did your interest become when did your interest become piqued? Were you\nalways interested or was it you only became interested later?",
        "A: Well, I don't remember how it was. I remember perfectly well the moment when I\nlearned about the origin of my father and his _ + as well. And I was six. I was playing\nwith the children in the courtyard and some child was like screaming at me that I'm a\nJew. I didn't know exactly what the Jew is. So I came back to the apartment. And Iasked my mother what did that mean? And she said that yeah, that's true. My father 1s\nJew. And my grandfather died in the Warsaw ghetto, that I don't have to be ashamed of\nbeing Jewish, that it's a part of the great history, the great nation, and that I never have to\nhide. It means she gave me some kind of, you know, courage to face it, which was\nactually quite rare because most of my parents' friends, Jewish friends, they didn't talk\nabout it with the children, and mostly have been hiding, you know, this reality from the\nchildren. They've been mostly involved in some kind of the activities with the connected\nwith the regime. And they wanted probably they didn't want to put the burden on the\nchildren. Also they didn't they didn't consider probably themselves as Jews anymore. It\nwas very complex and complicated situation, and many of them had their names changed.",
        "Q: But your father didn't?",
        "A: No, my father didn't. So I didn't I didn't feel that he's hiding something. I just he\nprobably didn't feel like to talk about it. And they didn't ask him. I had quite\ncomplicated relationship with my father. He didn't talk to other children too much. He\nstarted only when my parents divorced. After, he started to be very active father, before\nhe was pretty much absent father.",
        "Q: That was one of my questions is what was your father like and what kind of\nrelationship you had with him?",
        "A: He was very you know he was very intelligent, very very extrovert in some way,\nman partying a lot, telling a lot of stories. Having a lot of friends and but in the same\ntime it was something, I think, fragile human, you know. He was intellectual, very bright.\nAnd on the beginning he was very much involved in the Marxist ideology, and slowly but\nsurely he became quiet, you know, disillusioned by the regime and by the way it's going\non. Not in Soviet Union, although it's interesting. In Soviet Union, I think he had such a\ngoodness among the ordinary people that he's a member of the Soviet Union, have been\nquite positive, but after when he became better connected and better educated.\nEnd of File One\nBeginning File Two",
        "Q: When we talk about these films, when we talk about the stories that you are trying to\ntell, that there are complexities. There are many layers to them. How do you think\npeople in the east I'm being very stereotypical here, how do you think people in the east\nlook at the world, the term of complexities and deal with that, your audiences in the east\nor your public, and how do they do in the west, and do you think that there's something\nthere? So that's one. The other is we have our character from In Darkness who is who is\nan anti hero as we've been talking as___ says. And at some point he becomes a rescuer,\nand what compels him to do that? What do you think compels him to do that, and I'll\nstop with those two, and we'll see what happens in ten minutes. Okay?",
        "A: Youknow when\u2019 we can talk, yeah?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: When somebody asks me what is the most important in my movies or what I want to\ntell in this movie, I mostly answer that I want to tell the life is complicated. And the\ncomplexities for me like, you know, the only tool I have, you know, to face the subject of\nthe work. And in the same time, yes, you are asking you have been asking me how the\naudience reacts. It's changing. I think that, you know, for example, Polish audience in\nthe times of the communists, they have been accepting complexity very easily, and not\nonly accepting the realities as presented as complex, but also the language is complex,\nthat the style is complex, that they are using metaphors and symbols and so on. So it was\nvery you know _ and very curious audience, and they wanted to understand something\nabout themselves. Now, it's a little different, you know, actually after the communists\nfell apart, it became much more consumer kind of a society. A little same situation\nhappened in the west. What I remember coming first with my movies to France or to the\nUnited States, I thought that the audience, which is interested in this kind of a story much\nwider. Now you really have the last Mohicans in some ways, the distributors who have\nbeen doing it. But it can change again, you know, I think it can change with the state of\nthe society, you know? And you know you have the moments when the people want to\nbe cradled, they want to be, you know, put to sleep in some way. They want to be\nentertained.",
        "Q: That's right.",
        "A: Like children that are little, tell me another, tell me another. I'm bored. I'm bored,\nI'm bored. And actually, you know, the situation changes because the world suddenly\nbecomes very dangerous place. And you have to deal with that. And you are looking for\nsome kind of the _ + fears and to your, you know, frustrations. So I don't think that it\nwill be now forever. It will be always more stupid, I think, will be actually at some point\nmaybe wiser than now. And so it was for me fascinating hero. And not only because he's\ngoing through the change because, you know, change in some ways it's stereotyping, you\nknow, the hero is mostly going through the change.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Especially in America storytelling, right.",
        "Q: Has to change, has to change.",
        "A: And what I will like that you cannot really say why and in which point this change\nappears. It's _+ change. He's very ambiguous about what he's doing, and because he's\nnot intellectual, he doesn't have he's very simple man. And, you know, a lot of reason\nwhy he decides in this very moment to do what he's doing. But it can change the minute\nlater, so he's like somebody who is who is walking on the rope, the wire, and he can slip\nin any moment of the side of the good or bad. And in some point, in some point I think\nhe feels and it's because also he wants to look at himself as he is smart or that he can be\nsuccessful, he does something well. So he feels sometimes the weight of the\nresponsibility. And I think that responsibility has left. That in some way the moment\nwhen you are responsible for somebody, it's something which is which created this\nstrong attachment. And for him it becomes a kind of obsession. In some ways he is\nobsessed by that, like the gambler, you know, at some point he's acting in irrational way.\nIt doesn't make sense what he's doing, you know, it's against his interest. It's against the\nsafety of himself and his family, and also it's against his world of values because no\nmatter for him the Jews, no matter +andnot  *paidforit, what the * you know, it\nmeans it's interesting to watch it because it's so unpredictable in some way, you know?\nAnd I think that it makes this character in some way very real and very symbolic in the\nsame time like, you know, like this kind of the confusion. I think most of the people are\ngoing not only during the wartime, but especially in those dangerous circumstances\nthrough the process of the confusion. And at sometimes who decide to do something just\nby chance, something good, the mystery of the good, you know, how the people are\ndoing acting altruistic. It's quite easy to understand why they're acting in a terrible way,\nwhy they are cruel, why they are murderers, but why they are good, you know, I don't\nknow. It is a mystery so, you know, explore this mystery with a character, which is not\nangelic at all. It's interesting. And also the _+ the people are all stereotypes. He's\nwatching of the Jews in a very stereotype of way, and he expresses it through his\nlanguage, but the Jews watch him in the same way, you know? They don't watch him as\na human being, you know, so they are both in some way mirroring this kind of the judges.\nAnd it's very difficult and complicated and it's so much when it breaks. And when it\nbreaks down, suddenly they are naked, you know, they are standing naked Jews standing\nlike, you know, next to the naked _ and they are like looking into the mirror, you know,\nI thought that, you know that it's actually very touching without being, you know,\nemotionally judgmental or something.",
        "Q: Wow. Another word pops into my head and that's victim and how do you define a\nvictim? How do you how do victims define themselves? And when they have\ncompetitions as to who is the greater victim, and who owes whom? And they are often\ntied in with stereotypes. It also gets expressed in times of extreme what's the word I'm\nsearching for? When life is so extreme, where you may lose life, when you really are a\nvictim, you know, the associate, the one who says I'm not going to take part in this\nanymore is ends up being an innocent victim.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: You know I don't know what question I wanted to ask with that. But then it comes up\nfrom what you were saying. Is there anything that you would like our audience, our\nresearchers to know and to understand about what motivates your work? What motivates\nyou to look at these particular stories for this kernel, that you say this I can talk about,\nand this is a story I can tell?",
        "A: I don't want to be _ + like patterns and I don't want to be pretentious, and I don't want\nto speak about building bridges or something like that because then I don't believe really\nthat the cinema or any movie can change the world, but I really believe that even if it\nOpens eyes to some, I don't know, to some reality that is not obvious it's already good.\nAnd I try to make my movie as communicative as possible and as complex as possible.\nTelling complex stories in a simple way in some way. And probably I have this I have\nthis I have this urge to do it this way because I have some kind of pathological\npathological, you know, ambitions without being preachy. Because I receive some, you\nknow, things like that from the movies, from the books, from the you know from the art\nand from the storytelling. And I felt like it changed me, shaped me, you know?",
        "Q: It also sounds like from your nanny and from your parents is that they weren't\npreachy.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: They shared what was real for them.",
        "A: Right. So, for example, in Darkness, premiered ten days ago in Poland. And it was\nfirst country, I didn't have the high hopes. I thought that if we succeed to create some\nkind of you know, excitement, Polish stars and then, you know, it would have goodcritics in American press already, it will have maybe 100,000 of the viewers, which is\nokay, you know, but suddenly it became huge success, and no one could understand way.\nSuddenly it's the top box office movie for the second week. And with the young\naudience, you know, the multiplex audience. And it's better than Sherlock Holmes. It's\nbetter than Spielberg's movie. And it's better even than the Cat and Boots, and not only\nthe theaters are fooled, but the people are extremely like receptive, you know, several\npeople wrote to me and the people I don't know, and told the story about they tried three\ntimes to go through the theater and found out when they went, and that they seen the\nviewers who have bee buying, you know, popcorn at the beginning before the show and\nwho have been coming out from the theater with a cup full of popcorn. They didn't touch\niteven. So, you know, I told myself, what it 1s, you know, it is mysterious, you know,\nwhen you can really touch the people, as I say touch some kind of audience __ very\nyoung audience and not only Jewish audience but German Jewish audience as well. I\ndidn't expect it, but here it's even much more of a mystery because _ + had a lot of\nentertainment. It was light in some way, you know, very heavy subject and it was kind of\nlight story like __ tale. And this one is really, you know, it's really harsh, 1t means it's\nreally itis real experience of going through the very, you know, very difficult thing.\nAnd still like people are open to it and in Poland, you know.",
        "Q: Well, congratulations, it's wonderful news.",
        "A: Yeah, it makes me very happy and a little shocked. I still don't know what to do with\nthat.",
        "Q: Well, I have on that was going to be my last question, but I have sort of another last\nquestion, but it sounds to me that one has to be not afraid to be lonely, to have a double\nidentity, to look for these controversies. And I wondered whether or not you've\nexperienced that and, yeah, when you have, yeah.",
        "A: I think I like the situation. I accept the situation. And I try to make my best, you\nknow, out of the situation. Tired of being lonely. I'm never exactly thinking the same\nthing, you know, as the mainstream of this or this, you know, side. It's interesting, you\nknow, because on the occasion of this last movie in Poland I did a lot of promotion. And\nI was in a lot of TV shows and a lot, mostly talking about this, you know, complex and\ncomplicated issue of Polish Jewish relationship and the Polish guilt and the facts which\nappeared not so long time ago like ten years ago about like participation in",
        "Q: _ +\nWOMAN: _ + for example and, you know, I can talk about it to any Polish person, you\nknow, and without, of course, sometimes when you have the real fascists in front of you,\nyou are losing the kind of cold blood, but I try to come to this extreme. I try to be as\nopen and as receptive of his, you know, fears and his, you know, prejudice and his\nfrustration as possible. And in some way it works, you know, at least it works for the\nother people who are watching it. And, you know, it's I don't know. I never I never I\nnever hide it, you know, my Jewish side, which makes my enemies a little speechless\nbecause they've been writing terrible things about me in those Internets, you know,\nInternet sites, in Poland I mean.

And he was very _ +\nhow to tell over spoken. He was very _ + he was very present in the discussions in the\nintellectual life of this Jewish youth in Warsaw. He was collaborating as a child even\n__+when he was eight years old with the Jewish newspapers for the children and run by\nthe children who was created by _+ with called +. And so he participated as a young\njournalist in the production of this newspaper. When the war started he tried to convince\nhis family to also to move to __+. I think he felt that Poland can fall in the hands of the\nNazis and it was dangerous. But they didn't feel in the same way.",
        "A: They been like lower middle class family. My grandparent was a tailor. They had\nenough money to educate the children, the boy. The boy was my father. But also my\naunt finished the gymnasium, the kind of the high school. And my other aunt, I don't\nknow exactly, but she was also anyway they been schooling the children with education,\nwas very important for them. But they were not wealthy. My grand grandmother was\nparalyzed, and she was living with them. And it was also one of the reasons why they\ncould not imagine to move from Warsaw.",
        "A: Yes, he had two sisters. He was the only boy.",
        "A: My aunt told me the story. My father never spoke about it. He died when I was 13.\nAnd when he was alive, he never told me about the war, nothing. And never mentioned\n__+ family didn't know I didn't know what name what was the first name of my\ngrandparents. And after only after his death, my aunt started to tell me those stories, but\nI think they have been in some way traumatized. They didn't want to talk about it. They\ntalked among them. My aunt my aunt escaped ghetto, and then she contacted one family\nfriend, Polish guy was the engineer. And he was helping not only her, but also another\ncousin, two cousins, young girls who escaped from Vangloff (ph) which was some kind\nof a family town close to us. In Vangloff, my grandfather had four brothers and two\nsisters. No, three brothers, four boys and two sisters. One of the brothers immigrated to\nArgentina before the war, and three other brothers stayed, and then two sisters stayed in\nPoland. And they all died in the Holocaust. The most educated was Mendel who was, I\nthink, the lawyer. He stayed in Vangloff and was actually quite respectful citizen of the\ncity. He was in the city council and his daughter who survived and was in Argentina now\ntold me that he was as respected _+ birthday, the mayor of the city came to have the\ndinner with him. And they all have been hiding in the in their house, which was on the\nmain square in the attic. It was I don't know how many people exactly, probably 12 or15 or 16 people hiding there. After when the liquidation of the lock out Jewish\ncommunity. And they've been shot on the main square mainly. And he decided that he\ndoesn't want to hide anymore and he he went down and he like, you know, in some way\nfaced the squads and was talking apparently. The legend said was talking to the people,\nto the Jewish people that we have to do something. We have to try it, to die with dignity,\nthis kind of thing. The rest of the family remained for a few days more in the attic. And\nthen the younger boys, the younger decided that they have to try to save two girls, the\nyoungest girls, the daughter of Mendel and another cousin. And they've been blond and\nblue eyed so they decide they have the chance probably to survive. And they gave them\nthe address of this engineer, and then told them to go to a train station and try to go\nto Warsaw. The girls didn't want to leave the family. They've been crying and they've\nbeen they didn't want it. And so one of the brother of little Curstis(ph), this woman who\nis now in Argentina kicked them out, kicked them out from the stairs. And when little\n__+many years later told me the story, she was still angry with her brother that he did it.\nSo they've been walking through Vangloof. And I think everybody knew them in the\ncity. And they've been crying. And no one saw them, so it was some kind of, you know,\nmiracle. They came to the station. They took the train. They found the engineer. And\nthe engineer and my aunt from Warsaw ghetto probably she was already there. And she\nprovided the fake papers for my aunt and for older of those two girls, and the younger\ngirls been adopted by his fiancee.",
        "A: Yes, my father's sister, Marilka (ph).",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, I didn't know those stories before.",
        "A: I knew that my grandparents died, and I knew that my father had another sister who\ndied in the ghetto, but I didn't know the details. And I didn't know the names.",
        "A: Well, I don't remember how it was. I remember perfectly well the moment when I\nlearned about the origin of my father and his _ + as well. And I was six. I was playing\nwith the children in the courtyard and some child was like screaming at me that I'm a\nJew. I didn't know exactly what the Jew is. So I came back to the apartment. And Iasked my mother what did that mean? And she said that yeah, that's true. My father 1s\nJew. And my grandfather died in the Warsaw ghetto, that I don't have to be ashamed of\nbeing Jewish, that it's a part of the great history, the great nation, and that I never have to\nhide. It means she gave me some kind of, you know, courage to face it, which was\nactually quite rare because most of my parents' friends, Jewish friends, they didn't talk\nabout it with the children, and mostly have been hiding, you know, this reality from the\nchildren. They've been mostly involved in some kind of the activities with the connected\nwith the regime. And they wanted probably they didn't want to put the burden on the\nchildren. Also they didn't they didn't consider probably themselves as Jews anymore. It\nwas very complex and complicated situation, and many of them had their names changed.",
        "A: No, my father didn't. So I didn't I didn't feel that he's hiding something. I just he\nprobably didn't feel like to talk about it. And they didn't ask him. I had quite\ncomplicated relationship with my father. He didn't talk to other children too much. He\nstarted only when my parents divorced. After, he started to be very active father, before\nhe was pretty much absent father.",
        "A: He was very you know he was very intelligent, very very extrovert in some way,\nman partying a lot, telling a lot of stories. Having a lot of friends and but in the same\ntime it was something, I think, fragile human, you know. He was intellectual, very bright.\nAnd on the beginning he was very much involved in the Marxist ideology, and slowly but\nsurely he became quiet, you know, disillusioned by the regime and by the way it's going\non. Not in Soviet Union, although it's interesting. In Soviet Union, I think he had such a\ngoodness among the ordinary people that he's a member of the Soviet Union, have been\nquite positive, but after when he became better connected and better educated.\nEnd of File One\nBeginning File Two",
        "A: Youknow when\u2019 we can talk, yeah?",
        "A: When somebody asks me what is the most important in my movies or what I want to\ntell in this movie, I mostly answer that I want to tell the life is complicated. And the\ncomplexities for me like, you know, the only tool I have, you know, to face the subject of\nthe work. And in the same time, yes, you are asking you have been asking me how the\naudience reacts. It's changing. I think that, you know, for example, Polish audience in\nthe times of the communists, they have been accepting complexity very easily, and not\nonly accepting the realities as presented as complex, but also the language is complex,\nthat the style is complex, that they are using metaphors and symbols and so on. So it was\nvery you know _ and very curious audience, and they wanted to understand something\nabout themselves. Now, it's a little different, you know, actually after the communists\nfell apart, it became much more consumer kind of a society. A little same situation\nhappened in the west. What I remember coming first with my movies to France or to the\nUnited States, I thought that the audience, which is interested in this kind of a story much\nwider. Now you really have the last Mohicans in some ways, the distributors who have\nbeen doing it. But it can change again, you know, I think it can change with the state of\nthe society, you know? And you know you have the moments when the people want to\nbe cradled, they want to be, you know, put to sleep in some way. They want to be\nentertained.",
        "A: Like children that are little, tell me another, tell me another. I'm bored. I'm bored,\nI'm bored. And actually, you know, the situation changes because the world suddenly\nbecomes very dangerous place. And you have to deal with that. And you are looking for\nsome kind of the _ + fears and to your, you know, frustrations. So I don't think that it\nwill be now forever. It will be always more stupid, I think, will be actually at some point\nmaybe wiser than now. And so it was for me fascinating hero. And not only because he's\ngoing through the change because, you know, change in some ways it's stereotyping, you\nknow, the hero is mostly going through the change.",
        "A: Especially in America storytelling, right.",
        "A: And what I will like that you cannot really say why and in which point this change\nappears. It's _+ change. He's very ambiguous about what he's doing, and because he's\nnot intellectual, he doesn't have he's very simple man. And, you know, a lot of reason\nwhy he decides in this very moment to do what he's doing. But it can change the minute\nlater, so he's like somebody who is who is walking on the rope, the wire, and he can slip\nin any moment of the side of the good or bad. And in some point, in some point I think\nhe feels and it's because also he wants to look at himself as he is smart or that he can be\nsuccessful, he does something well. So he feels sometimes the weight of the\nresponsibility. And I think that responsibility has left. That in some way the moment\nwhen you are responsible for somebody, it's something which is which created this\nstrong attachment. And for him it becomes a kind of obsession. In some ways he is\nobsessed by that, like the gambler, you know, at some point he's acting in irrational way.\nIt doesn't make sense what he's doing, you know, it's against his interest. It's against the\nsafety of himself and his family, and also it's against his world of values because no\nmatter for him the Jews, no matter +andnot  *paidforit, what the * you know, it\nmeans it's interesting to watch it because it's so unpredictable in some way, you know?\nAnd I think that it makes this character in some way very real and very symbolic in the\nsame time like, you know, like this kind of the confusion. I think most of the people are\ngoing not only during the wartime, but especially in those dangerous circumstances\nthrough the process of the confusion. And at sometimes who decide to do something just\nby chance, something good, the mystery of the good, you know, how the people are\ndoing acting altruistic. It's quite easy to understand why they're acting in a terrible way,\nwhy they are cruel, why they are murderers, but why they are good, you know, I don't\nknow. It is a mystery so, you know, explore this mystery with a character, which is not\nangelic at all. It's interesting. And also the _+ the people are all stereotypes. He's\nwatching of the Jews in a very stereotype of way, and he expresses it through his\nlanguage, but the Jews watch him in the same way, you know? They don't watch him as\na human being, you know, so they are both in some way mirroring this kind of the judges.\nAnd it's very difficult and complicated and it's so much when it breaks. And when it\nbreaks down, suddenly they are naked, you know, they are standing naked Jews standing\nlike, you know, next to the naked _ and they are like looking into the mirror, you know,\nI thought that, you know that it's actually very touching without being, you know,\nemotionally judgmental or something.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I don't want to be _ + like patterns and I don't want to be pretentious, and I don't want\nto speak about building bridges or something like that because then I don't believe really\nthat the cinema or any movie can change the world, but I really believe that even if it\nOpens eyes to some, I don't know, to some reality that is not obvious it's already good.\nAnd I try to make my movie as communicative as possible and as complex as possible.\nTelling complex stories in a simple way in some way. And probably I have this I have\nthis I have this urge to do it this way because I have some kind of pathological\npathological, you know, ambitions without being preachy. Because I receive some, you\nknow, things like that from the movies, from the books, from the you know from the art\nand from the storytelling. And I felt like it changed me, shaped me, you know?",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right. So, for example, in Darkness, premiered ten days ago in Poland. And it was\nfirst country, I didn't have the high hopes. I thought that if we succeed to create some\nkind of you know, excitement, Polish stars and then, you know, it would have goodcritics in American press already, it will have maybe 100,000 of the viewers, which is\nokay, you know, but suddenly it became huge success, and no one could understand way.\nSuddenly it's the top box office movie for the second week. And with the young\naudience, you know, the multiplex audience. And it's better than Sherlock Holmes. It's\nbetter than Spielberg's movie. And it's better even than the Cat and Boots, and not only\nthe theaters are fooled, but the people are extremely like receptive, you know, several\npeople wrote to me and the people I don't know, and told the story about they tried three\ntimes to go through the theater and found out when they went, and that they seen the\nviewers who have bee buying, you know, popcorn at the beginning before the show and\nwho have been coming out from the theater with a cup full of popcorn. They didn't touch\niteven. So, you know, I told myself, what it 1s, you know, it is mysterious, you know,\nwhen you can really touch the people, as I say touch some kind of audience __ very\nyoung audience and not only Jewish audience but German Jewish audience as well. I\ndidn't expect it, but here it's even much more of a mystery because _ + had a lot of\nentertainment. It was light in some way, you know, very heavy subject and it was kind of\nlight story like __ tale. And this one is really, you know, it's really harsh, 1t means it's\nreally itis real experience of going through the very, you know, very difficult thing.\nAnd still like people are open to it and in Poland, you know.",
        "A: Yeah, it makes me very happy and a little shocked. I still don't know what to do with\nthat.",
        "A: I think I like the situation. I accept the situation. And I try to make my best, you\nknow, out of the situation. Tired of being lonely. I'm never exactly thinking the same\nthing, you know, as the mainstream of this or this, you know, side. It's interesting, you\nknow, because on the occasion of this last movie in Poland I did a lot of promotion. And\nI was in a lot of TV shows and a lot, mostly talking about this, you know, complex and\ncomplicated issue of Polish Jewish relationship and the Polish guilt and the facts which\nappeared not so long time ago like ten years ago about like participation in\n(Video cuts off)\nEnd of File Two\nConclusion of Interview\n"
