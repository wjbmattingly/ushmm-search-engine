        "A: Only the foreigner, who went through more or less the same thing, will\nunderstand, yeah. Not from the other side. This was paradise.

        "A: I\u2019m sure there are plenty of it. For one reason that I \u2014 I-I-I tried to understand, 1s\nit true? I \u2014 I start not to believe what [indecipherable] look at me, and I\u2019m still\nhere, and I have a office, with kid, with children. How could I live?

        "A: The worst thing 1s, if you can\u2019t share with nobody. It\u2019s always, you know,\nlocked in the \u2014 in the \u2014 and you ask yourself what has happened [indecipherable]\nis it true? Some years, are you still alive, you know\u201d? So it\u2019s very hard to tell my\nkids. Okay, sure [indecipherable]. You can\u2019t. If you don\u2019t go through, you don\u2019t\nunderstand, yeah. Same thing with a patient, if you never have pain, oh yeah, don\u2019t\nworry about it, couple minutes you\u2019ll be finish. For you a couple minutes, but the\npatient is suffering couple hours.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And same thing [indecipherable] not expected to understand.\nMay 3, 2013",
        "Q: Did you learn something about yourself as a person, having gone through these\nthings?",
        "A: Oh, a lot. I think a lot. I don\u2019t know why, it\u2019s all \u2014 1n all of us. We afraid to\nthrow out the piece of bread.

Do whatever I wanted, you know.\nA-Alive. And to me at least, start to believe you have a God. You have somebody\nwho does it for you.",
        "Q: So it strengthened your belief?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, more, more.",
        "Q: But somebody would say, if He was a God, how did He allow this suffering? I\nmean, it\u2019s the perennial question.",
        "A: Yeah, everybody ask it.",
        "Q: Everybody asks this question. How will you answer them?",
        "A: You look for a \u2014 for wa \u2014 answers. You ask, maybe, maybe this guy did\nsomething different. Maybe this guy did some \u2014 something [indecipherable] to\nMay 3, 2013\nsomebody, that\u2019s why he has to be punished. Maybe. You don\u2019t know. I never spe\n\u2014 spoke with God. I try.

        "Q: Or the line is busy.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t think the line is busy, but \u2014 but you mean, somebody who 1s victimized\ncould be \u2014 could be responsible for that? They \u2014 they\u2019re guilty of \u2014 themselves, of\nbeing victimized? Is that what you\u2019re saying?",
        "A: Maybe. I mean, if you going back to God now, make believe.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We don\u2019t know why \u2014 you ask the same question. I was \u2014 I had the prisoners, I\nmean, medical thing, it \u2014 only killers, maximum, right. But the people there were\n90 years old, 70 [indecipherable] never got sick. Why is this [indecipherable]\ndie? That\u2019s the question, who shall I ask?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: The same thing here, it\u2019s hard to tell why.",
        "Q: But my question to you is more for those people who want to dismiss that there\nis a God, and say, if the \u2014 why \u2014 if there is one, why did he allow such suffering?\nAnd you say your faith was strengthened. How do you answer that question for\nthem?\nMay 3, 2013",
        "A: Well, to me, what I went through is many miracles. Who else [indecipherable]\nmiracle than God. Somebody higher and stronger than me helped me to go through\nthis.

Or \u2014 or like my brother [indecipherable] you know, the showers.\nForget about shower [indecipherable] we had a \u2014 not a hole, a piece of stone over\nthere, with a couple blankets hanging, they\u2019re outside a fire. You put snow, and\nfrom the snow we get steam. And this was our shower. You didn\u2019t get sick, you\nwent without shoes, without the winter. This were your shower. Could you believe\nit? No.\nMay 3, 2013",
        "A: [indecipherable] remember?",
        "A: Only the foreigner, who went through more or less the same thing, will\nunderstand, yeah. Not from the other side. This was paradise. It was \u2014 here, when\nwe came, we just couldn\u2019t believe it, we had the \u2014 we couldn\u2019t believe it, we are\ntalking with a nice human being, you know. Thank God. Food all over. You don\u2019t\nhave to stay in line, like you used to.",
        "A: You used to stay in lines for hours, and then they haven\u2019t got any more. Like I \u2014\nI \u2014I love watermelons. I says, for one week or two weeks I was living only on\nwatermelons. I had no money, I had nothing to buy [indecipherable] the\nwatermelons were growing over there, just growing, you know, wild. And this the\nonly food what I ate.\nMay 3, 2013",
        "A: I\u2019m sure there are plenty of it. For one reason that I \u2014 I-I-I tried to understand, 1s\nit true? I \u2014 I start not to believe what [indecipherable] look at me, and I\u2019m still\nhere, and I have a office, with kid, with children. How could I live? But yeah \u2014 I\nmean, you start to think, you go [indecipherable] details. You went through more\nthan y-you could take, you know.",
        "A: The worst thing 1s, if you can\u2019t share with nobody. It\u2019s always, you know,\nlocked in the \u2014 in the \u2014 and you ask yourself what has happened [indecipherable]\nis it true? Some years, are you still alive, you know\u201d? So it\u2019s very hard to tell my\nkids. Okay, sure [indecipherable]. You can\u2019t. If you don\u2019t go through, you don\u2019t\nunderstand, yeah. Same thing with a patient, if you never have pain, oh yeah, don\u2019t\nworry about it, couple minutes you\u2019ll be finish. For you a couple minutes, but the\npatient is suffering couple hours.",
        "A: Yeah. And same thing [indecipherable] not expected to understand.\nMay 3, 2013",

        "A: And then you did a thing for everything. Every step you\u2019re doing here, you can\u2019t\nbelieve it, that 1t\u2014 you \u2014 I used to \u2014 I here, free? Do whatever I wanted, you know.\nA-Alive. And to me at least, start to believe you have a God. You have somebody\nwho does it for you.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, more, more.",
        "A: Yeah, everybody ask it.",
        "A: You look for a \u2014 for wa \u2014 answers. You ask, maybe, maybe this guy did\nsomething different. Maybe this guy did some \u2014 something [indecipherable] to\nMay 3, 2013\nsomebody, that\u2019s why he has to be punished. Maybe. You don\u2019t know. I never spe\n\u2014 spoke with God. I try. He has no telephone.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Maybe. I mean, if you going back to God now, make believe.",
        "A: We don\u2019t know why \u2014 you ask the same question. I was \u2014 I had the prisoners, I\nmean, medical thing, it \u2014 only killers, maximum, right. But the people there were\n90 years old, 70 [indecipherable] never got sick. Why is this [indecipherable]\ndie? That\u2019s the question, who shall I ask?",
        "A: The same thing here, it\u2019s hard to tell why.\nMay 3, 2013",
        "A: Well, to me, what I went through is many miracles. Who else [indecipherable]\nmiracle than God. Somebody higher and stronger than me helped me to go through\nthis. Wha \u2014 two slices of bread a day for two years or three years? Working\n[indecipherable] and \u2014 and it\u2019s not that \u2014 you have to finish this amount. If you\ndon\u2019t finish, you can work all night. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t get nothing. It\u2019s not\nlike eight hours [indecipherable] eight hours.",
        "A: Yeah. So the \u2014 the \u2014 you had so many questions. [indecipherable] some are\nwhy. Why did this guy die, he was so strong, working with me? How come I am\nand he 1s alive? Why \u2014 you know, and it\u2019s so many questions you can\u2019t answer.",
        "A: And like everybody else, you have to believe in something stronger than you\nare. So where you go?",
        "A: Yeah. You can\u2019t afford [indecipherable] the telephone.",
        "A: I\u2019m just \u2014 I just thank God they don\u2019t have to go through it, and I have to\nunderstand. Thank God for that. That\u2019s it. And everybody, they don\u2019t know what\nMay 3, 2013\nkind of country we have, really. You\u2019re born in good, so you don\u2019t know, the same\nthing. At home I didn\u2019t know what the \u2014 what mean hungry. I didn\u2019t the guy he is\nhungry, because hungry you don\u2019t see. You see he is working, I am working.
