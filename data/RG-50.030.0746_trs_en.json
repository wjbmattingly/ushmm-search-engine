        "Question: So this the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Walter\nMeyer conducted by William Meineke, on May 19th, 2010 in the U.S. Holocaust\nMemorial Museum in Washington D.C. So Herr Meyer, good morning.",
        "Answer: Good morning to you.",
        "Q: So could you tell me a little bit about your life, your \u2014 your early -- the earliest you\ncan remember?",
        "A: Well, I was born in Kassel, which is very much in the center of Germany. My father\nworked for the Henschel Company, so that's pretty much the most important factory in\nKassel. The Henschel were famous for making locomotives, and later on, they made the\nfamous Henschel airplane. That's where I was, and my mother disliked Kassel very\nmuch. That's where the Lindenhessen (ph) lived there, very, very unpleasant people,\nmostly Protestant. I was the only Catholic, so they called me the Katholische\nRattenschwanz.",
        "Q: Catholic rattail?",
        "A: Catholic rattail, and so then my father eventually secured a job as director of\nFeindliche Industrial Refrigeration Company in Dusseldorf, and so we moved there.",
        "Q: How old were you?",
        "A: When I was 11, maybe 12, and of course there was a change then, a different school,\ndifferent environment. I joined the swimming club and became part of the Jungvolk,\nwhich 1s the early stage of the Hitler Youth, divided in Jungvolk, Hitler Youth and then\nof course the armed forces, and at 14, I joined -- or better said, I had to join the Hitler\nYouth, which was an organization from 14 to 18 and it was very much a premilitary\npreparation.",
        "Q: Did you like the Hitler Youth, I mean what kind of activities did you do?",
        "A: Oh, it was very nice. We liked it very much because we had, I -- oh, let me explain.\nThe Hitler Youth was divided like the armed forces into Navy, Army and so on, Air\nForce, and as a swimmer, I joined the Navy and was trained to become an underwater\ndemolition expert. So what we learned there was rather interesting, spent a lot of time in\nthe water. Didn't have to go to church because services were generally on Sunday\nmornings purposely, traveled a lot to compete in other cities of Germany, camaraderie,\nnice friends, yes. And Nazis as such or the philosophy of national socialism didn't enter\nour brain very much; we were a little too young to understand all that. We saw more or\nless the victorious aspect of Germany, that means coming up with something new in the\nindustry and designing a new airplane and being number one in this and so on, and\neventually of course came the war. So the answer to your question was I liked it very\nmuch, yes, it was very enjoyable. It was like -- like in a way like somebody joining the\nBoy Scouts here.",
        "Q: Well, what was the week like? So how often would you go to the Hitler Youth, what\nwould you do in the Hitler Youth --",
        "A: Every week.",
        "Q: -- ina week? So once a week?",
        "A: Yes, every week, Sunday, every week. Of course the coaching -- swimming coaching\nwas three times a week but then Hitler Youth services was Sunday and there were\nholidays where we had to meet and march and sing and so on, yeah. So there were\nspecial meetings, let's say, on the 1st of May we would -- we would be driven to\nNuremberg to march there with the flags and so on, you know, and I swam in Stuttgart. I\nswam in Breslau, I swam in Ried (ph) in Austria, so...",
        "Q: What was your sport, what was your event?",
        "A: Iswam 100-meter breast stroke. At that time, shortly after I started, breast stroke was\ndivided 100 strokes to swim butterfly and breast stroke, and butterfly didn't have a\ndolphin kick but it had a breast stroke kick, so there has been a quite an evolution in\nswimming.",
        "Q: And you were successful?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: You were a successful swimmer?",
        "A: Yeah, I was quite successful, yes, and then later on I became the goalie because the\ngoalie of the German water polo team had a fatal accident so they were looking for one,\nand during a little training period, I played goalie and I was pretty good, so they asked me\nto stay. So I became the goalie of the water polo team, and that was more fun than\nanything, except we played a lot in -- outside and sometimes the water was about 14, 16,\nice cold, ice cold. So, yeah, but it was enjoyable because it was a camaraderie and...",
        "Q: Did you have classes in Nazi, you know --",
        "A: We had classes, yes. We had classes and learned many things theoretically, others in\npractice, like the language of the flags and some Morse alphabet, et cetera, et cetera,\nthose. Learned about Bruttoregistertonnen, what all that meant, the size of a ship and so\non. The armed forces or the Hitler Youth equal to the armed forces was also divided into\nranks, like the GI and the corporal and the -- and so on. So many of the guys I didn't like\nbecame lieutenants and captains and I had to salute them, and I didn't like that idea very\nmuch because I had absolutely no respect for them. I thought they were a bunch of\nsissies. So that brought upon the first resentment, the first problems and that --",
        "Q: How about school?",
        "A: School?",
        "Q: What was school like?",
        "A: Oh, well, school was of course corporal punishment. If you didn't behave, you had to\nwait to until physical education class when you had nothing but your shorts on, bend over\nand there was a little bumble stick and so..",
        "Q: Do you remember any teachers?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Do you remember any teachers from that time?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh yes.",
        "Q: Who, for example?",
        "A: [had Dr. Bach (ph) was probably my favorite teacher. He eventually left because he\nwas a reserve officer in World War I. He was a captain and so he stayed in the reserve\nand then left and that was -- that was bad because I missed him very much. He was the\nway a teacher is supposed to be.",
        "Q: So how?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So how 1s a teacher supposed to be?",
        "A: Yeah, he taught well. He shared. He considered and expected students to listen to\nhim, to obey, but he was fair in everything, so I was one of the top students while he was\nthere.",
        "Q: What subject did he teach?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: What subject?",
        "A: He taught German, German grammar and history. Yeah, I think that was it, but he\nwas what 1s called a Klassenlehrer, that means the principal teacher, and besides that, and\nof course we had the biology teacher, the one who taught physics and chemistry, one who\ntaught geography. And then as the teachers left because they had to join the Army, we\nhad women teachers, and the poor ladies, we made their life so, so difficult. Oh God, I\nfelt sorry for them.",
        "Q: How did you make their lives difficult?",
        "A: Well, I remember one day I brought home a little piece of reproduce but identical\nlooking pile of dog poo poo, okay. And then another guy brought some kind of\nphosphorous thing that stank like hell so we put this close to the pult (ph), you know, and\nthen everybody in the classroom {Sniffing sounds} and then the teacher started {Sniffing\nsounds! and then she said oh, God, and then everybody laughed like hell. So things of\nthat nature, you know, and...",
        "Q: Did you have a best friend, did you have a pal?",
        "A: Now, I don't know best friend. I had some Jewish friends, but I liked them mostly\nbecause when I went to their homes they had always an assortment of cookies. I mean\nJewish mothers are very, very, very nice ladies. So yeah, I liked them, got along well\nwith them.",
        "Q: Were they in class with you?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How were they treated in class?",
        "A: Like everybody else, yeah. Things began to -- began to change after the\nKristallnacht, that was a change, and then of course they had to wear the David Star and\nthen, well, then --",
        "Q: Can you describe how things changed?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Can you describe how things changed after Kristallnacht, do you remember any --",
        "A: Well, we non-Jews were then taught, I think the biology teacher taught us what the\ntypical Jew was like. He was only interested in making money. He could not be found in\nprofessions like farmer or work with his hands; businessman, money changer and so on.\nThen the physical attributes, their noses, flat feet and so on, we learned about that, and we\nwere told then to stay away from them, to -- not to have any kind of association with\nthem.",
        "Q: How did your Jewish friends in the class react?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: How did your Jewish friends who were in class with you, how did they react to that?",
        "A: They were kind of the silent partners of -- of -- of -- of the geschenes (ph), things\nhappened but they were kind of shaken or didn't know what to say or not to say.",
        "Q: Do you think a lot of the boys believed -- believed what they were being told?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you believe what were you being told?",
        "A: Something I didn't believe, I questioned it, because I had such a good experience with\nthe freundlich and the frohliche and the families with whom I had a very nice contact,\nthey were nice to me, so I said why, and I mean we had Jewish neighbors. So of course\nwhile this was going on, on the other hand, we got indoctrination in every way possible,\nnewspapers, Sturmer, education, the teachers. I mean we were fed entire Judaism from\nleft and right, and I assume that some -- some -- some youngsters probably asked\nthemselves whether there was not something true about those things. My question was\nonce when the persecution started, I helped once as an altar boy, and I didn't like the\nchaplain very much because he's always late, I had to wake him up, but one day I asked\nhim, I said, why is there so much hatred? I mean Jesus was Jewish. It's there written on\nthe cross, INRI, Jesus von Nazareth, Konig der Juden. Walter, you're not allowed to ask\nquestions. You have to believe. So I felt that was rather stupid as anything I ever heard\nand -- but I didn't say anything, but I was dumbfounded, let's put it that way. And my\nfather was extremely critical. My father was in World War I from the first day till the\nlast day. He was in every major battle. He was wounded three times and he was very\nmuch anti Hitler, and he heard -- listened to the NBC or CBS, NBC, CBS -- CBS, and my\nuncle told him, be careful, they're going to catch you one of these days, you'll end up in a\nconcentration camp.",
        "Q: So BBC, yeah?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: BBC?",
        "A: BBC.",
        "Q: British Broadcasting Corporation?",
        "A: British, British, yeah. And so what this little Hitler, what he expects going to Russia,\nI mean he's going to bleed to death and all these poor young boys will be killed. So that\nwas kind of my father's spiel, but he very soon, thanks to his knowledge of languages, in\nthis case, French, he spoke French fluently, he became the liaison officer for the French\nheavy industry during the German occupation with headquarters in Lille, northern\nFrance, so I didn't see much of him. And I had lost my brother in mountain climbing. He\nfell to his death. So it was my mother and I, and then I didn't spend much time in school.\nI spent -- I mean much time at home. And a -- well, the day came when the school\nexpelled me.",
        "Q: Oh, why?",
        "A: Because the windowsill of the old school building, there was a board, and from the all\nthe rain throughout the years and years and years had become brittle, and you could pick\nitup. And I said oh, that would be wonderful to just let's it sail down, and so one of the\nclassmates, I says said when somebody comes let me know. Somebody came. Well, that\nsomebody was a teacher, he just walked by, and it ended on the back of his head and then\nof course went into 1,000 pieces, and I was called and Dr. Fettweiss (ph), he was the\ndirector, the principal. Nobody want to say anything, so we had these big lush eyebrows,\nand he went to one, did you do it? Did you do it? When he came to me, I broke down\nand I said yes, I did. So I was expelled and then I went to I think the first boarding\nschool I went to -- or the first boarding school I went to was Switzerland, went to a very,\nvery exclusive boarding school where --",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: At St. Gallen. When?",
        "Q: When?",
        "A: Well, that must have been, let's see, that must have been about '37, I'm pretty sure,\nand from + and so on and so forth, and those were the kind, and my father was not\nthat wealthy but there was somebody who liked me very much and felt that I needed -- I\ndeserved special consideration, so I think he paid part of the school. So I went there for a\nyear, but then I painted the walls and so on, and so they asked me to leave, so then I went\nto Bornheim.",
        "Q: What, you painted the walls?",
        "A: Yeah, I just -- they were -- they were blank walls, so I thought, well, I should bring a\nlittle color into the environment there. I was always very artistic, even as a kid. So well,\nmy father had to pay to clean the walls, repaint them, and I left and I went to a school in\nBornheim. I think I wrote about my school in Bornheim. You want me to go into that?",
        "Q: Please.",
        "A: The school was in the center of town. The school was -- where we slept was\ndowntown and the school was a little out of town. So where we slept, it was an old\nbuilding, like the buildings here in Washington, old stone building, three story. The\nupper stories where the director and his family lived and then the different floors were\ndifferent rooms where the students lived. I lived with the son of a physician. He always\nhad a little money. And the food was absolutely disgustingly terrible, and around\nChristmas time, upstairs, they were baking. And you can imagine the aroma going\nthrough the building, but the cookies were not made for us. So when I found a way, the\ndirector had gone I think to an opera or something like that. So I found my way in and\nemptied the cookies and distributed them throughout the school, and I said, well, I better\nnot be here when he comes back. So I told my roommate, I said come on, let's go. We\nwere on the third floor. We put sheets together -- bed sheets, climbed out of the window,\nand then he said, I can't go on. Why? I can't do it to my father, he'll never forgive me.\nSo we went in front of the door and waited for the director to come, and I took off. And\nthen I didn't have -- I just a few marks, I didn't have enough to take the train. And I don't\nknow, I have gypsy blood or something like that. I went down to the -- to the river and\nwas successful in convincing one of the captains to take me on the barge, you know the\nbarges that go down, and that was a very, very pleasant trip because the captain had his\nwife on the barge with him, and I helped her to hang up or to hang her clothes that she\nwashed, and you could see her bra and underwear and everything was flowing there with\nthe wind, colorful thing. Well, that's how I arrived if Dusseldorf, and when I came to my\nmother, she already had a letter from the director of the school. Why do you do that to\nus? Why can't you be different? Your father, what is he going to say? You don't have to\ntell him. Well, so I went back to the Dusseldorg school, Ignazio, and I think I was in the\nObertertia, that's when I became involved in the Edelweisspiraten and found a lot of\nactivities to dampens my adventurism.",
        "Q: So what was your father's reaction to, you know, that whole story?",
        "A: Well, he didn't know until he was told that I was arrested.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: And as a matter of fact, he was called from France to come.",
        "Q: When you were in the Internacht (ph), were you still part of the Hitler Youth, did you\nstill take part in Hitler Youth activities?",
        "A: Not if Switzerland of course there was a Hitler Youth, and in Bornheim -- in\nBornheim, yes, but there was not much Hitler Youth, no, no.",
        "Q: So by removing you from Dusseldorf they separated you from the Hitler Youth?",
        "A: They separated us what?",
        "Q: From the Hitler Youth.",
        "A: Yeah, and I don't really know why we at any point in time have a Hitler Youth in\nBornheim, and I'll have to think about it, really, but we did not, but when I came back to\nDusseldorf, then of course I went back to Hitler Youth, and then my activities started\nwith the Edelweisspiraten and that was a new adventure almost every day.",
        "Q: Yeah, we heard you spent considerable time on the Edelweisspiraten, but I want to\nsort of explore school a little bit more.\nSo is there a teacher that you had that you -- that you detested?",
        "A: That I had?",
        "Q: That you detested, that you hated?",
        "A: Oh, several I detested. As a matter of fact there was one -- there was one who would\nask you a question which had two answers, kind of. If you answered A, he would hit\nyou; if you answered B, he would hit you, so you couldn't please him. We called him a\nNilpferd, a hippopotamus because he had one wooden foot, so when he came {making\nnoises}, you could hear him come. And I told my father about it, and my father of course\nwas absolutely sure that I deserved it, until one boy came to my home one day. I think\nfather was in the hospital, so he came and had dinner with us, and my father asked him,\nhe said, oh, no, he hits anybody, guilty or not guilty. So my father looked at me -- he was\na very radical man. I'm very much like him in many ways, and he said, he hits you\nwithout a reason, you hit him back, you hear, you hear. So the word run through the class,\nWalter's going to hit him. Well, the next day he didn't hit me, and the next day he didn't\nhit me but then he hit me and I hit him back. I hit him back and I ran. I ran to the\nprincipal's office. I said I was crying, I hit the teacher, but he hit everybody _+\nMy father had to come to school, and my father raised hell. The teacher was transferred\nto another place and so that was one of the -- one of the big incidents. Another thing, at\nthat time, I became sexually very active at a very young age. I found these elderly ladies\nwho -- who took a liking to me and taught me, which was so much more interesting than\nschool, and, well, that's the way it went until January of 1943. Of course by that time,\nGermany was bombed. It was very much the center of the war and food was hard to\ncome by. So in the evening I went to see my friends, the French prisoners of war that I\nmet with my friends. We played pool and we talked to -- about what to do next. So we\nwould hide their bicycles or -- see, there's a reflector on the fender of a bicycle on the\nback so that you see it when you drive behind them, and we would hang condoms on that\nthing and so things of that nature. And we got away with little things. We want to do\nsomething better, maybe just take one wheel out of the bicycle and leave the bicycle there\nwith only one wheel or take the entire bicycle away, things like that. I always thought\nwhat are we going to do next, and we had a group and let's go maybe during the apple\nseason, we would get together on our bikes. Of course we all had bikes. I had a racing\nbike. I would go to next town and put the bike against the tree, climb on the bike and\nthen collect apples. Swimming in between -- well, until I was arrested and --",
        "Q: So, again, we're going to get to that in great detail.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you, you said food was getting scarce. Can you describe that a bit?\nWhat kind of things were available, what were you eating, how did that all work?",
        "A: I don't know exactly when rationing started, but I believe that by '43 we had rationing\ncards and the black market began. My father was born in the Eiffel region close to the\nBelgium border, I mean next door to the Belgian border, and so we always -- he went\nthere and came back with butter and schmaltz and eggs, and so that when he went to\nFrance of course we always had coffee and so we did not suffer. Ration cards alone was I\nthink 50 Klonfleisch, or Fleischnon, or anything that's sausage or meat at 50 gramm per\nweek and, very little in terms of fat, butter fat, whatever, that was rationed. So -- but the\npropaganda, in which the Germans probably became the masters in the world, was so that\npeople were happy to sacrifice for the good of the country, so you didn't hear too many\npeople bitch or cried or complain.",
        "Q: My colleague, Ann Millen, said that when you were in the exhibit, The State of\nDeception exhibit, that you knew the KdF jingle. Can you sing it or hum it for us now?",
        "A: Kraft durch Freude {singing}. They are big things, Kraft durch Freude, you know,\nexcursions, all that was done for the people to enjoy, to -- and if you didn't feel good,\nwell, the the doctor prescribed einnakur (ph) which they didn't sell anywhere in the world\nbut in Germany I think, so you were allowed to spend three weeks in the Schwarzwald\nbecause everything paid for and oh...",
        "Q: Did you ever go on vacation?",
        "A: Yes, I was -- when I went on vacation, I was very anxious to get to my father's\nhometown, because I loved to be with animals. My great uncle -- oh, it's hard to believe,\nwhen I think about Germany so highly civilized and tremendous, advancement in\nindustry and so on, well, the little town of Holoratz (ph) in the Schneeeifel, my\ngrandmother, my father's mother, like most girls in the town, were sent down in the\nvalley to work as a maid and possibly to find a husband. So my grandmother met my\ngrandfather, and I think they went to the haystack together and my father became the\nresult, and when the people realized that she was -- that my grandmother was pregnant,\nthey threw stones at her until the priest of the town said may he who cast the first stone,\nyou know. So then up in that old building, which was the house in which my father was\nborn was building 1640, and it still stands, so up -- what a very poor area, 1890, poor\nperiod, and out of straw they built a mattress and that's where he was born, almost like\nJesus Christ, and he loved it there. He was very happy, but to give you an idea what\nthings were like, I asked my father one day, I said something that you remember that\nreally had an impact on you? Yep. One day I was with a friend and we looked up the\nroad, the Kuhstrasse it's called because the cows were driven up there to go to pasture,\nand we saw the priest behind a tree peeing, and we looked at each other and we knew\npriests don't pee and we made it very clear they would not tell anybody because they\nwould call us liars. So the holy men don't pee. And so in this little town you would see\nthe blind obedience to the church, blind obedience to the Burgermeister, and so on. This\nobedience was reflected all over Germany, whether it was the Kaiser or whether it was\nHitler, it didn't make any difference. So it wasn't too difficult for somebody to take over\nand exploit this kind of sentiment, but I went there because I didn't have to brush my\nteeth in the morning. I didn't have to wash up. It was ideal. And I tell you, you had to\ntake care of cows, the neighbor's cows and several cows got together and I had to take\nthem together with the dog and a stick and I had to take them to a certain pasture, and the\npastures had no fences, so I had to keep the cows from walking into the potato fields.\nOkay. That was my job. It was beautiful. My great aunt would make a head of bread\nabout this size. I remember she would put it under her bosom and make a slice of it the\nsize -- everything was homemade, homemade ham, homemade everything.",
        "Q: So about two feet, two and a half feet?",
        "A: Yep. And she made ciders for me to take home. Oh, it was so good, and I went\nthere. And I remember there was a girl in the area also took care of some cows, that we\nbecame friends and we started -- spoke in Lorbeerblatt, whatever they are. It's a shrub.",
        "Q: Laurel leaves?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Laurel leaves?",
        "A: Laurel leaf, yeah, yeah, that's right. So {making noise} oh, it was beautiful, so I\nloved to be in there. I really loved to be there and I have been there many times even\nafter the war.",
        "Q: Did you know your grandfather?",
        "A: Yes, I knew him. Hated his guts. He was a devout, stupid Catholic, stupid in the\nsense he didn't ask questions. He accepted and made it his own knowledge, but he was\nnot very nice to my mother, and he kind of respected me because I didn't agree with him\nand I openly said so. I was a tough kid, and he died of diabetes, I think, and he wanted to\nsee me. I said I don't want to see him, so I didn't go.",
        "Q: What did he do for a living?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: What did he do for a living, did he just run the farm?",
        "A: No, no, he was -- he was Mannesmann (ph - correct), the famous German company,\nMannesmann. Among other things they built seamless pipes and they had a plant in\nHelenta (ph), which was close to Holoratz (ph) and he would manage the horses and take\nthose pipes to the railroad station, and they wanted him to take over the horses into sort of\nin the main plant, so that's how we got to Dusseldorf. And then after awhile, he was a\nrather ambitious -- was in the army and then he joined the police force, and he made a\nname for himself, because he apprehended one of the most ferocious criminals at the time\nwho had chopped up children and so. It was an atrocious thing. And then he was\nextremely strong. He looked a little bit like Khrushchev, a stocky old bull, and he would\naccompany prisoners because they would get extra pay for that, and then he built a\nbeautiful home. So he was very ambitious and became a lieutenant and was known as the\nPolizeimeier, and we walked -- I had this chain here with a watch and walked, had no\nhair whatsoever. I mean it was just like, like bald headed old bull, and the kids saw him\nand said Polizeimeier, and they would disappear with their soccer balls and so on when\nhe came. But there he was. His wife had died rather young, and then he had a\nhousekeeper and I believe also his mistress. I don't know this, but I think so. So I saw\nhim rather infrequently. I didn't like him. I liked my mother's father. Yeah, he was a\nkind old man.",
        "Q: What did he do?",
        "A: He was a roofer, a roofer for only cathedrals and churches, so I have a picture of him\nwas high, high on the upper part of the town church, you see, and then as SA come, he\nwas a forest ranger for a noble man, so he went hunting and so on. I used to see him with\nhis long pipe, and he had the longest legs I ever seen, and he was able not only to put one\nleg under the other, he did one more curve and he did that. Opa, do it once -- one more\ntime, and he did. Oh, I got a kick out of that, and he was actually the first one I did a\ndrawing of with my fountain pen, and my teacher didn't believe that I had done it.",
        "Q: Which teacher was that?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Which teacher, do you remember?",
        "A: Yeah, but I don't remember his name, my art teacher. I'd say Johans, but I don't\nguarantee that that was right. And when he realized just I did it, then he took me to the\nKunstakadmie for Dusseldorf, which is one of the best known Kunstakadmien in Europe.\nAnd there I was exposed to weird looking professors with beards, I mean they look like\nhippies but hippies in the '40s, and my first thing was to nacktzeichnen. That means draw\nnudes. Well, you know, at 11 or 12 years old, to see a naked lady in front of you, it rather\nleft an impact on me and I don't know, I guess my pencil was a little shaking. I\nremember when I used my single little bit of __ + Everything had to be done with\na pencil. Well, that's where I had my first art instruction. I didn't last very long, I think\nthree months or something like that. There was always something. Then -- then -- then\nmy parents had a friend who was an opera singer and I was a happy guy. I always sang,\nand he heard my voice I think in the bathroom I was singing, and he said do you mind if I\ngive a private lessons? No. And he was going to prepare me for the music conservatory\nin Cologne. I had to go there. I had to sing Schubert's An die Musik {singing}. Oh, very\ndifficult song. And they thought I was not quite good enough as a soloist, so I thought\nthat I would be all right in the choir, and I didn't think that I -- I think I was too good for\nthe choir, so I didn't stay there. So I had many interests. I had a problem that I was born\nwith quite a few talents, none of them developed to the extreme, but I knew this and I\nknew this and I knew this and I knew a little of everything. I learned languages just like\nthat. So I had a problem I want to be a movie star. I wanted to be locomotive driver. I\nwanted to be, you name it, so anyway. More questions, please.",
        "Q: So what happened that you had to leave the Kunstakademi, do you remember?",
        "A: When?",
        "Q: No. What happened? Why did you leave the Kunstakademie? You said something\nhappened.",
        "A: Oh, just because. That was not -- that was -that was a volunteer thing. I went there in\naddition to school. Okay. So I just didn't like it. So I don't want to go back, and since\nmy father was not at home, there was nobody who could handle me. See, my mom --\nfather handled me brutally, and my mother tried love but she was not quite strong\nenough, poor little woman, so...",
        "Q: I think now would be a good time for a break, so...",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Interview\nwith Walter Meyer. So Herr Meyer, you said over the break you had fun in the Junkvolk.\nCould you explain, please?",
        "A: Yeah. The Jungvolk was very much like the Boy Scouts, little camping trips, and it\nwould please me enormously that I became a drummer, and so I could show off with my\ndrum and get a little attention that way, which I needed badly, and even my mother said\nwould you show me again, drum a little bit. So I drummed and I sang. I was a happy\nlittle fellow. So the Jungvolk was, I would have to admit that it was a pleasure for a\nyoung boy to join the Jungvolk, and I repeat, it was just as enjoyable as it is my son to be\npart of the Boy Scouts.",
        "Q: You had an opportunity to go to the Adolf Hitler Schule. What is an Adolf Hitler\nSchule. What does that entail?",
        "A: Adolf Hitler Schule was a select -- I think there were two, maybe three out of Hitler\nschool in Germany, and they were there to train, indoctrinate young men to become\nleaders, let's say, with some exaggeration, like the LBJ School of Public Affairs in\nAustin, Texas who will train people to become excellent in government administration.\nThis was a little similar, but only one sided, in other words, all under the umbrella of\nnational socialism. And to enter there, you had to go through -- you would have to be\nhighly recommended and you had to go through a preschool, through a screening process\nand so on. So I think my father didn't quite know what was involved, so I went to the, to\nthe first essetapa can\u2019t identify word (ph), the first step of a screening school, passed that,\nand then my father got a letter which he had to sign and he refused to sign because he\nthought that was a little too much for a young man and he just did not agree. So he didn't\nsign, so I didn't go. So the Hitler school was maybe the equivalent, if you want to\ncompare to going to a Jesuit school to become a priest, okay. It would be totally a one-\nsided education.",
        "Q: I mean were you upset that you couldn't go?",
        "A: Why my father didn't like it?",
        "Q: Were you upset that you couldn't go?",
        "A: Yes, I believe I was a little upset, but I don't think I took it too seriously. Yes, I was\nupset, but I was used to my father saying no to something that I wanted badly so...",
        "Q: Did you experience any schooling in the Hitler Youth, any schooling in the Hitler\nYouth?",
        "A: Not schooling per se. You had of course theoretical instructions in the branch. Let's\nsay the Navy. You would learn about how ships operate, the size of ships and what you\ndo in the Navy. So the theoretical part you would learn, and how to speak with flags and\nthe different ranks, history of the navy, yes, but most of it was the practical aspect of it.",
        "Q: Can you explain?",
        "A: Yes. You would learn how to -- how to use breathing apparatus underwater. You\nwould learn to connect magnetic bombs underwater and you would train to bomb ships\nunderwater, ships that would be anchored in a port and --",
        "Q: How did you react to that training, did you like it, hate it?",
        "A: Yeah, it was interesting. It was adventurous, because you would swim with clothes\non. You would swim with clothes and shoes on. I mean there were scenarios where you\nwould think that you under pressure and you have a gun with you and how can you swim\nwith all this weight and so on. So it was an interesting scenario, yes, and besides you\nwould -- you would be treated as somewhat of a special guy. You were a prince. You\nwere a little champion, you know.",
        "Q: Explain.",
        "A: Well, you were not just any ordinary guy, you were a super athlete.",
        "Q: Explain -- explain how that worked in the Hitler Youth, being an athlete?",
        "A: Well, were you treated with a little more respect like -- than an ordinary guy and...",
        "Q: Now, you were talking about competition in the Hitler Youth. Can you explain how\nthat works?",
        "A: Yes. Before the Hitler Youth existed, swimmers or athletes in general would\nrepresent a club, let us say that I would swim for the swim club of Washington and we\nwould have a big swim meet going on in Washington sponsored by the federation --\nswimming federation and invite clubs from Philadelphia, from all around they would\ncome and swim here. Well, the Hitler Youth took over, so now I would swim\nrepresenting the Hitler Youth, Section 6 of Dusseldorf, swimming against the Hitler\nYouth, Section 9 of Frankfurt, and there whether different cities represented different\nsections of the Hitler Youth. So to find out who was the best swimmer in the Hitler\nYouth, okay, and it culminated in the Reichsjugendmeisterschaft, that means the youth\nchampionship in swimming.",
        "Q: And you participated in that?",
        "A: Yes, twice.",
        "Q: How did you do?",
        "A: I was third once and fourth once, so I was --",
        "Q: So pretty high up?",
        "A: Well, pretty high up. I was -- I was all right but I was not on top, and really I\nparticipated in the German championship, the open championship and I was third and that\nwas pretty good, but you had to consider that some of the best swimmers were already in\nthe Navy, so they didn't participate. So my competition was rather limited.",
        "Q: Can you sum up your experience in the Hitler Youth but as a favor or a colleague, can\nyou say it in Spanish?",
        "A: {Speaking Spanish} 58:30. Les juventud hitlerisito pues eres una organization un\npoquito comos los Boy Scouts, dividido lo mes moque, lo fuerzas armados, lo armado\nfuerzas eres, lo marina y por su puesto como matodar, y tuve que entrar en lo armada y\nhi un entrentor como especialiste en colorer bombes bejo agua, y me divedi mucho\nporque cada dis ero algo interesante y aprende mucho de los barcos, de los uniformes, lo\nhistorie de la armada, los diferentes guerres. Y ...une orgulloro de mi mismo y de lo\njuventud hitleristo brewso companeros habis muy pocos que critica todo ero uno coso\npositive.",
        "Q: Thank you. Let's turn to the edelweiss pirates. Can you tell me about them, how they\nwere formed, how that worked.",
        "A: The edelweiss pirates -- well, edelweiss is the flower that only grows up in the high\nmountains of the Alps. It's a pretty flower and it represents bravery, strength. My\nbrother tried to pick edelweiss for his mother and fell to his death and they found him\nwith edelweiss in his hands, so edelweiss in my family was something very special. A\ngroup in Berlin started the Edelweisspriaten, how did you hear about them?",
        "A: News got around they were persecuted, as you would hear about saboteur and\ncommitted sabotage and so on, and that triggered an interest in we could do something\nlike that. And there was enough hatred, disrespect for our leaders, and I'm talking about\nour immediate leaders, that means companions who now became lieutenants and captains\nand we had to respect and salute them and listen to them and obey them, and that was\ndefinitely against my nature. And I found quite a few comrades who, for adventurous\nreasons, for one reason or the other sided with me and said yeah, let's have some fun. So\nI have to emphasize that I was a little too young, even though after the war, we were\nconsidered political prisoners, but really, there was no real ideological reason because I\ndidn't understand national socialism as I would understand it today. It was more of a\nmovement based upon rebellious nature, protest against blind obedience, this sort of\nthing. So we formed a chapter in Dusseldorf and hoped that eventually we would\nestablish contact with the Edelweisspiraten in Berlin, but we did not. So then we spent\nquite a bit of time thinking of what we could do to make their, in quote, their life more\ndifficult.",
        "Q: Who 1s the their?",
        "A: Well, our leaders, the ones we hated, our captains and lieutenants and captains.",
        "Q: In the Hitler Youth then?",
        "A: Yeah, yes, yes.",
        "Q: So how many of them were you?",
        "A: Oh, we were about 12.",
        "Q: So 12. Your group was 12, and you then, as a group, decided we can do this or that\nagainst the Hitler Youth?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: So what are some of the -- some of the things that you thought up?",
        "A: Ha, well, I told you before we would -- all the reflectors on the bicycles, on their\nbicycle, we could hang condoms there, and especially we would put them there in the\ndark so they would not discover them right away and take them off. They would ride the\nbike and then somebody started laughing because they drove behind them. So we'd do\nthat. Steal the bike. Deflate the tires, we would do that rather frequently, paint things on\ntheir -- put poo poo on the bike, whatever.",
        "Q: Did you have other fun, did you do other things?",
        "A: We would generally meet in what was called in Dusseldorf Cafe Meintz (ph). They\nhad in the back, they had billiard room, so we'd play pool. That's where we had our\nmeetings. What are we going to do next, and so fun, as I said I became interested in\nwomen, had an affair with our mail woman and looked for adventure of any sort, but in\nthis particular framework, it was generally thinking about how can we make those stupid\nidiots' life a little more difficult.",
        "Q: So does that mean you dropped out of the Hitler Youth?",
        "A: Dropped out? That would have been impossible because it was obligatory to join.\nYou had to have a qualified reason, like maybe losing one leg or something like that, that\nyou couldn't do it, but as long as you were healthy and you didn't have Jewish blood for\nfive generations, then you had to join.",
        "Q: So how did that work, being a part of the Hitler Youth and rebelling against them at\nthe same time? How did it work being part of the Hitler Youth and rebelling against\nthem at the same time?",
        "A: Ha. Well of course we tried to be as clandestine as possible, so on the surface, we\nwere just very loyal members of the Hitler Youth and our movement was rather\nunderground. Okay. So it was so it was what in Germany you call Schikane, based upon\nour dislike for authority.",
        "Q: How did your parents react to this? Did they even know what you were doing?",
        "A: They didn't know. They didn't. My father was in France so there was only my\nmother. I was the only one left. My brother had died. He died 1n'41. And so I was the\nonly one left and she never knew what I was and sometimes I didn't come home at night,\nand the poor woman. Why are you -- I didn't know, I just -- I should have been born in\nwest Texas on a big ranch.",
        "Q: Do you remember their names, your friends in the edelweiss pirates?",
        "A: Oh, there was -- yeah, there was Eddie Violent (ph) was one.",
        "Q: Was he a good friend, Eddie Violent?",
        "A: Yes, he still is. He's dying, but I talk to him once in awhile. He's still hanging in\nthere.",
        "Q: How did you meet him?",
        "A: He was a neighbor.",
        "Q: And how did you --",
        "A: He's the one, Eddie, who took over -- who took over the Jewish bar. When I was\narrested, Eddie knew him, so he went over and stayed -- for the rest of the war, he stayed\nwith Eddie.",
        "Q: So explain that. How did that happen? You're in the edelweiss pirates and you\ndecide you're going to hide a Jewish boy?",
        "A: Maybe -- maybe -- I don't know, maybe I should think a little more about what I did\nand how I did it, but maybe one of the things was that we did not enjoy the procedure of\nthe Hitler Youth being helpful in the prosecution of Jews, which they were, and I had\nthese friends, they didn't do any harm to anybody. They were nice kids and so on, and so\nwe were very much interested in helping the underdog. So we considered the Jews\nunderdogs. And so this one guy, when we knew they were being evacuated and sent to\nplaces, well, we didn't want him to go. I didn't know his parents, and so I just thought\none day if you don't want to go, you can stay with me. And so he stayed with me for, oh,\nI don't know, I would say probably six months or eight months. And it was not broadcast\nin my family that he's a Jew. It was just he's a young man who needs a little help and can\nhe stay with us? Yeah, he can sleep in my brother's bed, you see. And so in the\napartment housing which we lived in, there were a total of six parties, +. So they\ndidn't know that he was a Jewish boy. It was not broadcast. He was just a friend. And\nso when I was arrested, then -- I believe that when I had a visit with -- from my mother,\nthe question came out of what are we going to do with Hans Dieter (ph)? I said call\nEddie Violent he's going to take care of him. So he took over. That was just one block\nfrom our house, and his situation was a little nicer because he lived a house. The house\nwas his. Okay. So he had a little more freedom and who walked in his house. Okay.\nAnd he stayed with him for the rest of the war. What happened with him afterwards, I do\nnot know, and I asked Eddie and he didn't know -- oh, yeah. He told me one day, he said\nguess what? You you remember Hans\u2019? Yeah. He died.",
        "Q: What was his name, Hans?",
        "A: Hans Dieter Von Schwejk (ph).",
        "Q: Von Schweyjk?",
        "A: But I don't know whether the parents ended up most likely in the concentration camp\nsomewhere. I don't know details. I don't know what happened to him after the war, so...",
        "Q: So your -- your friend, I mean he was in the edelweiss pirates with you. Did he have\nscathingly brilliant ideas?",
        "A: Eddie, yeah, Eddie is extremely, extremely talented with his hands. He can build\nanything. I have to ship a stove. He built a stainless stove for me. I have to ship it, it's\ntoo damn heavy, but I have to ship it to the States sometime. So he would help us many\nif we want to break in somewhere, he would give us the key or the Dietrich it's called in\nGermany. It's kind of thing that fits any lock. So he would do things like that, and yeah,\nanything mechanical and so on, he would help. That was mostly his work. He was not a\nvery athletic type. He was more the thinker and the doer.",
        "Q: Was there anything else that you did because it was against policy of the Nazis?",
        "A: I think what was more than anything was that you could not argue. You could not\ndiscuss. You had to accept whatever was said as the final truth, and I liked the idea of\nasking why and how and you couldn't. So that was a little against my nature of just\naccepting things blindly.",
        "Q: So where did you get non-government information from? Where did you get that\ninformation?",
        "A: From radio, BBC, from some foreign magazine. My father bought some home once\nin awhile, books.",
        "Q: Tell me about the POWs.",
        "A: The POW? Well, my father was a linguist, and as a little boy, he would see to it that I\nspoke French. So he would tell me in French, get me my slippers or good evening. And\nso I know my father or I knew my father only as pere, which is father in French. I never\ncalled him Papi or father, it's always pere. And so not too far from my home was a\nfactory -- paper machine factory, and in the basement of the factory were French\nprisoners of war. And understand that there were quite a few factories where they put the\nprisoners in the bottom and made the enemy -- somehow made the enemy know that\nthere were prisoners so they wouldn't bomb the factory and kill their own people. And so\nthe lower windows had these had these iron bars, and through them I could see them and\nthere was enough to shake hands or to give them something, so I went there once and\npracticed French. Bonsoir, mes amis. Comment \u00a2a va? And so -- Qu'est-ce que vous\navez besoin? What do you need. I remember one gave me a little piece of wood and he\nhad written down, when will the French prisoners of war be liberated? And I thought oh,\nGod, I have no answer for this. I don't know. I felt a little bad that I didn't have an\nanswer, but I brought them things to eat. I didn't have much, but I brought them a little\nbread or things. And then they gave me letters to send, and when my father came to town\n-- that was one thing about my dad. He was very much in favor of helping the underdog,\nand you should see the testimony he got from French men after the war. It was very\nbeautiful. And he became an immediate chief interpreter of the French military\ngovernment because -- so anyway, I gave them the letters and he would see that the\nletters would go to their destination in France and I would get answers back, and so I was\nthe middle man kind of. And yeah, I was -- I went there at least three times -- three times\na week and somehow -- you know, in Germany, neighbors know what you're doing. I\nmean you cannot do anything without somebody knowing. Spitzel. They watch over\nyou. So somehow my activities with the French prisoners of war became known, not to\nthe point where they prosecuted me immediately or looked for me, but it became known.\nSo that 1s what the judge brought up, and you know, from the police when I was arrested\nand went to the police pres -- first through polizei revier Polizeirevier, and then to the\npolizei presidio Polizeiprasidium and then the Gestapo until eventually I went to prison,\nbut then things came up. You like French, huh? That's how it started. So I don't\nremember your last question.",
        "Q: Well, I just asked you about the POWs, what your relationship with them --",
        "A: Yeah, oh, yeah. The POWs. So those -- those -- that's my POWs. That's why I tried\nto help them with a little food here and there and take their letters and bring them mail\nfrom their families, and so they were happy to see me and I was happy to practice a little\nFrench with them.",
        "Q: Did you experience the bombing of Dusseldorf at all?",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: Can you explain how that worked, what that process was?",
        "A: Well, of course the siren, when it started, went {making noise} and then when it was\nover it would go {making noise}., monotone. Well, when it started, everybody would\nrun as fast as possible into the basement or to the bunker. There were bunkers all over\ntown, and then would you hear the bombs falling. Dusseldorf was destroyed 75 percent.\nSo yeah, and in '43, it became a nightly affair. Dusseldorf or the vicinity was bombed.\nIt's a very industrial city and very close to the rural region where all the steel industry of\nGermany is So...",
        "Q: So I mean were you personally affected by the bombing?",
        "A: By affected, you would wake up in the morning, and these houses over there didn't\nexist anymore, they were ruins and you would have to go a long way around to get where\nyou wanted to go and things like that. And you heard that such and such family, they\nwere killed during the bombardment. And I heard once this guy, believe it or not, he\nsurvived with his bed. He ended up in the other house across the street. Things like that.\nAnd so, yeah, that's how I was affected, and we lived south of town, which was a\nresidential area which was not heavily bombed.",
        "Q: Did you hear about Volksschadlinge, public enemies, Volksschadlinge,?",
        "A: Volksschadlinge, oh yeah, the Volks Schadlinge Volksschadlinge.",
        "Q: Public enemies?",
        "A: Of course in Dusseldorf and every major square you had several things. Once a week\nyou had the farmers -- the farmer's market there, and then generally you had restrooms\nunderneath, and then you had the Stiirmer, and loudspeakers. When Hitler spoke of\ncourse, he would sit there and listen to the loudspeakers, and the Sturmer of course would\nbring out the newest in -- in what the Jews did, what they had done, what they did, how\nthey behaved, how terrible they were and so on and so forth. Cartoons of Jews, picture of\nJews, the Jewish barber accused of raping a customer and so on and so forth.",
        "Q: I mean would you see people standing there reading them?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, sure. You would stand there. It was up there. It was like a showcase with\nthe newspaper filled the entire, you know, the page of a newspaper, filled the entire case.\nAs a matter of fact, you have one in the -- in the -- in the holocaust museum. Yeah, it's a\nreplica. It's perfect. That's -- that's it. Yeah, people would stand there, yeah, and read\nand they would read in front of the newspaper building. They put out not only Sturmer,\nbut they put out the daily newspaper. So people stood there in line, but yeah, Sturmer,\nyeah, it was always something new, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you hear about people taking property after a bombing?",
        "A: Well, taking property was something that happened not infrequently. After\nKristallnacht, it was a common thing, and of course -- of course after the Jews had no\nrecourse. It was nothing they could do, whether they liked it or not. And I often wonder\nif the guy had not killed \u2014_, what would have happened. Something else would have\nhappened, I'm pretty sure but...so, so Sturmer, yeah, sure, people stood there. Some\nlaughed because some of the cartoons were funny with the big noses and so on.",
        "Q: Do you remember the day you were arrested?",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: So tell me about that day. What was going on?",
        "A: A friend of mine and I walked out of the pool room after we heard the siren. It was\nafter an attack, a bomb attack. We walked outside and this is on the Kings Avenue. It's\nlike Fifth Avenue. It's one of the well-known streets in the world, in Berlin in\nDusseldorf, fancy stores, expensive stores. It's a very fashion city, Dusseldorf, and wide\navenues beautiful trees, parks and so on. Anyway, we walked out, and right next to the\nCafe Meintz (ph) was a shoe store, and the shoes were just all over the place, so we didn't\nhave to get into the store to get them. We picked them up on the street, and -- but 1t was\ndark. So it was cold. It was January, and I just stuffed a bunch of, I think five or six. I\nstuffed them in here and said let's go, and we went to the -- believe it or not, we went out\nto Adolf Hitler Platz. The lights went on and people came out of the bunker, and I looked\nat the shoes and I realized they were all lefties, and I thought golly. Well, an old lady\ncame -- an elderly lady came. I said, would you like some shoes? Here, why don't I\nmake you happy. I have my shoes. Oh, come on. I tried to persuade her, and I didn't see\nthe policeman that was there. Hey, what do you have there? And I said nothing. Let me\nsee. And I started running, and he whistled, and I think I made three blocks or something\nand there was a guy a big bear of a guy like you, and he opened his arms. He gave me a\nbear hug. Yep, and so I was taken to the polizei revier Polizeirevier, and from there I\nwent to the polizei presidio Polizeiprasidium, headquarters. And then questions,\nquestions, questions, and then because they felt that I was -- I think they felt that I should\nbe interviewed by the Gestapo. So I went to the I think {?Prinzgelstrasse?} where the\nGestapo was, and I had to undress and then examined me and they didn't -- oh, I have to\nmake something clear so it makes more sense. I was born almost circumcised, which does\nhappen. Instead of having the long foreskin -- I mean the head of the penis was sticking\nout a little bit. So when I started to masturbate and have fun sexually, it hurt, and so I\ntold my father. He took me to the doctor, and I remember he said, I give you one mark if\nyou don't scream. So I had to pull the skin back as far as it go, and he came with a long\nneedle and {making noise}, and I got one mark. So but when the Rassenexperte (ph),\n___+he looked at me and said this is a Juden, and so they argued and looked at me and\nthen they called somebody who was really a specialist and he looked at me and no, no,\nno, no. No, he's not Jewish at all, but I almost -- I almost became a Jew there for awhile.\nSo from the Gestapo I was sent to prison, and then and then I went to court on April the\n12th and from then it went on.",
        "Q: So what went through your head when you were arrested, what were you thinking?",
        "A: Through my head?",

        "Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Walter Meyer,\nconducted by William Meinke on May 20th in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in\nWashington D.C. This is part two of an interview that began yesterday, May 19th. So\nHerr Meyer, I'd like you -- yesterday, we finished with your arrest. Is there anything else\nyou want to say about your arrest?",
        "A: Well, I think -- I think we finished yesterday with a bear hug.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Right. So I couldn't run any longer. I had to surrender, and shortly thereafter, the\npoliceman who wanted to arrest me in the first place, he caught up, took me and took me\nto the police station, and --",
        "Q: Did he say anything to you?",
        "A: Yeah, he was very angry to me, as a matter of fact, he got behind me an orfieger (ph),\nand they're going to teach you how to treat a German police officer, and so on, these\nwords, and, oh, maybe an hour later, I was taken to the Polizeiprasidium, which would be\nequal to a police headquarters, and there they tried to get the documents together since\nmine is a rather common name where my parents live, the address, birth date, et cetera, et\ncetera, and when all that was done and I was asked what I had done and I played kind of\ninnocent, I haven't done anything. Well, we will find out about you if you don't want to\ntalk. So I was at the Polizeiprasidium and that's where interrogation continued, or let's\nsay it started all over again, the same questions, and I gave the same answers, but then I\nrealized they knew more than I knew about me, and when that verhor, that interrogation\nended, I was taken to the Gestapo headquarters, and they then forgot the matter of the\nshoes very much. That was not even mentioned. They kind of wanted to hear about the\nEdelweisspiraten, my contact with French prisoners of war and my membership in the\nHitler Youth and why I had done that, and one of them seemed to be a little -- what's the\nword I'm looking for? He didn't quite trust me. So I was asked to undress, and then they\nlooked at my genitals -- genitals and one says, It's a Juden. This is a Jew. No, no. Yes,\nyes. Well, then they called someone who was more of an expert, and he didn't quite\nknow what to do with me, and then they got a super experts, ehnrasseenkundige (ph), and\nhe looked at me and he realized that that no, I was not really circumcised, it was only half\ncircumcision or something like that, and so I was able to get dressed again and one told\nme boy, you're lucky you got away with it. You're lucky you're not Jewish. And I got\ndressed again, and then all this took an hour, two hours. I don't know. And then I was\ndriven to the prison, and the prison I was given prison clothing and I was taken to my\ncell, which was going to be my home for I guess about a month.",
        "Q: Was that a youth facility or was that --",
        "A: Oh, no, it was --",
        "Q: An adult prison.",
        "A: It was a regular prison, yeah, and I drove by there many times when I went to\nworkout at the swim club. We drove by the prison many times. We made jokes. We call\nit the -- the -- it had a special name. We called coffee so-and-so, cafe so-and-so, and of\ncourse at that time I never dreamed that I would become an occupant of it. Well, I was in\none cell. It was a small cell, with one window, and with a little effort I could look out of\nthe window, at least a little part of it, and I saw a courtyard, and my neighbor next door, a\nyoung man, he yelled all day long, by all day long, liebataten dieant (ph), and God, it was\nhorrible to listen, until his voice got really horse, liebataten (ph), and I heard that later on\nhe ate his own feces and was taken to a state hospital. So well, in the morning, we were to\ntake our kubel, we called it, it was a container out of ceramic container, big container and\nwe had to take this one behind the other and go to the main section where we emptied it\nand rinsed it and then took it back, and in the meantime there, we were able to sit down a\nrow of people and do our business, went back to the cell. And I think maybe the third or\nfourth day, I was asked to join a group, and we were supposed to sew buttons on tents for\nsoldiers. We did that. Then I did another job with something like weeding. And then I\nhave to emphasize this over and over again, that I tried every -- I mean I dreamed of\nescaping, and so I figured that if I don't eat for awhile I'm going to faint probably and\nthey'd take me to a hospital and then from the hospital I can easily escape. So I didn't eat\nfor ten days, and yeah, I kind of fainted, but instead of taken to the hospital, they whipped\nmy butt, because they realized I did this not as an accident but purposely. So that didn't\nwork. Well, I was in that prison until April the 12th when I was taken to the court, and\nthat's where I saw -- after awhile I saw my parents for the first time. My father, my\nmother was there. They looked very stern. My mother was crying and my father had\nengaged the services of two attorneys that didn't do anything. I assumed the attorneys\ndidn't really have much power. They had to say yes and no, and be very obedient to the\njudge who was the most powerful autocrat. And so then the ceremony began. Walter\nMeyer, stand up. You're Walter Meyer. Yeah. You're accused of plunder. That was the\nprosecuting attorney talking, and I don't know whether you're aware, but this\nautomatically called for the death penalty, and one of the attorneys jumped and held my\narm, and said that's not the last word. And, well, they narrated, esplundern aktivitaten the\nEdelweisspiraten forbid den know mitsa creeks fangen and so on.(ph) And then they\nrested their case, and then they excused themselves and went to have I assume a\nconference of some sort. And they came back, the judge then made it clear, said I cannot\ncall this plundern. The most I can call it einfacher Diebstahl, simple theft, and I have\neven questions about that, but this young man needs a strong remedy. He obviously\ndoesn't quite fit into into what our country needs and contact with the enemy destroying\nstate property, all this. However, I have take in to consideration that he was an\noutstanding athlete. I also consider that that he lost one brother and -- but I feel that I\nshould give him a minimum or maximum penalty, which means that after one year of\ngood conduct, he can join the armed forces, so he's got a chance. It all depends upon\nhim. So it's one to four years. If he doesn't have good behavior then he has to stay for\nthree years. Do you understand that? Yes, I understand. Okay. That was the end of the\ncase. Then I was taken -- went back to the prison. Maybe three, four, five days later I\nwas called, get dressed and I was taken to the railroad station, and from there, I went\nwhat is called a German auft transport. (ph) I went first to Cologne, stayed at the Klinger\nPriz prison, (ph) which was rather interesting because we were in cells that had to be\nvacated every so often, because from there you could look down at the courtyard where\nthey would chop heads, okay and we were not supposed to see that. Well, we heard this -\n- the stotten clerk (ph) bim, bim, bim, bim.{making noises} So we had to move to the\nother side, and when the storm was over we went back, but that prison was so full of bugs\n-- red bugs. Oh, it was disgustingly dirty. But I was there maybe two days, three days.\nFrom there, I went to Coblenz. Coblenz to Frankfurt. Frankfurt then by bus to Butzbach,\nand from there we walked, that means a policeman and I. Policeman looked at me and\nsaid, look, let's not have any problems. Walk nicely next to me and we won't have any\nproblem. Don't try to escape. Don't make my life difficult, okay. So he delivered to me\nto the Rockenberg youth prison.",
        "Q: Before one more, Walter, do you think you can talk about the trial in Spanish?",
        "A: Yes, of course.",
        "Q: So do you want to start?",
        "A: {speaking Spanish} (17:00) entre la corte...la puesa prosecutor y prosecutor lista\ncomitido aver abrogado contacto con prisioneros de guerra frances que nuestros amigos\njuventud hitleristo destruyo propiedad del Estado equal termino entonces...palabra... I\nwent back to the prison.",
        "Q: So you arrived in the youth detention center, the jugendstrafanstalt in Buchenberg.\nSo what did you see there, what did you -- what met you there?",
        "A: What did I see in the jugendstrafanstalt?",
        "Q: When you arrived, how did that work?",
        "A: Well, first, I was impressed by -- sounds a little funny in prison setting, sounded\nbeautiful, but this was a beautiful setup because it was not a prison per se, but 1t used to\nbe a convent or cloister and the area was rather, rather attractive, and well, like in every\nprison, first you surrender the clothes you have, and they give you a prison uniform.\nThey gave me a cell, which would be my home for awhile, and we had lessons there of\ngeography and so on and so forth, I mean, not very considerable but maybe -- maybe\ntwice a week or maybe only once a week. I don't remember too well. And my neighbor -\n- my neighbor in the cell there after, he was kind of a, like later in the concentration, in\nthe capo, he was a privileged prisoners, his cell door was always open. He could walk in\nand out when he want to, and I found out that he had killed his father. But see killing\nyour father was not as bad as helping French prisoners of war, something like that.\nAnyway in my cell, and then a week, two weeks later, then they found out that I hid -- I\nhad more education than the rest of the prisoners. They were more of the lower echelon\nof society, so it was an elderly police employee who was the buyer. He would buy\nvegetables and things that the kitchen of the prison need, and they needed an assistant and\nhe picked me. And as such of course I could have survived forever there and I would\nhave gained quite a bit of weight because the food was at my disposal, and so I did that\nfor awhile until I had the problem with my attempt to escape. Do you want me to go into\nthat?",
        "Q: Please.",
        "A: Well, I was supposed to take control over certain things. That means I had -- I did a\nlittle bureaucracy, what we bought and so on, and nicely organized, and I was in the part\nof the prison that was the cloister at one time, very thick walls, but I found a little\nwindow where the bars, one bar was loose. I could take it out. I assume -- it was a\nconvent, and so it was wear and tear over the years and years and years. So I figured that\nwould be my chance to escape. And I wrote a little note to my father, whom I expected\nto visit, and a little map where he would have to expect me and so on. I mean it was\nnicely detailed, small letters. I folded that, put it in my pocket, and somehow, I don't\nknow how, but I lost the little piece of paper and it was found and I was called before the\nwarden.",
        "Q: What made you think your father would help you?",
        "A: I would climb out and he would be waiting with a car.",
        "Q: Well, what made you think that your father would agree to that, that he would help?\nDid you believe your father would help?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: No question?",
        "A: No question. No question. Oh, yes. And of course it was ideal because it was in\nFrance, so I would have disappeared in France, would have been ideal solution, but it\ndidn't work that way. And so no more visits from then on. I went in the dungeon for 28\ndays and --",
        "Q: What's the dungeon?",
        "A: Well, the solitary cell for 28 days, swalik en bot en vasel (ph). So that was my first\nsevere penalty, and after that I had two more like that. So I became an ordinary prisoner\nand oh, I -- I -- I, yes, and one day, I told one of the guards that I would like very much to\nwork in the quarry and he was kind of a nice guy. I'll see what I can do. Okay. So I\nended up in the quarry, which was about I would say 20 miles away from the prison, and\na very, very large pit which had several levels. The levels were occupied by different,\nthey were Russian prisoners, French prisoners, and we were on the top and there was a\nrail going up and one of the privileged prisoners controlled the brakes, that 1s he let the\nfull lorries go down to the valley and brought an empty one up and we had to fill each\nlorry with, what, 12 lorries a day or we would get no food, and we -- the rail for the\nlorries then from the brake station were then two of the different niches where the\nprisoners worked, so I had this and another one had this and so on. And there was one\nprisoner who was quite a bit older than I and he obviously had some practice and he\ntaught me how to pick, how to get a rock out. I never knew what was done with the\nrocks, what kind of mineral they were and they would grind them down there, but what it\nwas for street construction, road construction, I don't know. Anyway there I worked and\nthen of course we were not in the prison anymore. We had our barracks there. We had\nour Own prison, you know, like in a concentration camp. We were a satellite -- satellite\nprison. The food was horrible, just watery soup, and if you didn't have your 12 lorries,\nyou wouldn't get any food at all. The worst thing that ever happened was one of the\nguards was the most royal son of a bitch that I ever met, but we had -- to do our business,\nwe had a pole sticking from one place to the other and a ditch underneath. We sit on the\npole and shit in the ditch so to speak and this -- I had sawed half of the pole, and left it\nthere of course. As the weight increased, it increased, suddenly it broke and we all ended\nup in the shit. And I assure you, I've worked in the country, I bread horses. I know what\nhorses smell like. I know what cows smell like. I know what pigs smell like. Nothing\nworse than human shit, I mean... So then, of course (speaking German). So you try to get\nthis shit off you and then you went, you don't have dry clothes and so that was an awful\nincident, and then --",
        "Q: So why did you want to work in the quarry anyway, I mean that's hard work?",
        "A: Because I always had in mind to escape, and I felt that being outside in nature there\nwould be a chance, and so about close to Christmas '44, I was called before the warden. I\nsaid looks like that we as a prison authority, we are unable to do any good. You need\nsomething a little more severe, and I believe that the armed forces are probably the best\nartznei, (ph) the best, the best --",
        "Q: Medicine?",
        "A: The best medicine for you. Therefore, I consider sending you to join the armed\nforces. And I softly protested I think. After I had been in the dungeon twice already at\nthat time, I said I'm in no condition to satisfy the demands of the armed forces, so why\ndon't you allow me to go home and recoupe a little bit and then I'll be more than happy to\njoin the forces. I was excused and then as always, the other prisoners, you know, you\nwalk one behind the other asked what happened? What happened? And I said well,\nthey're trying to make cannon fodder out of me, and one of prisoners reported that he\nwanted to join the forces and they wouldn't let him, and I had a sense to do it, but I\nprotested. I didn't want to become cannon fodder. I was called again. Did you say that?\nYes, I did. All right. Thank you. And two days later I was transferred to the youth\nconcentration camp.",

We liked it very much because we had, I -- oh, let me explain.\nThe Hitler Youth was divided like the armed forces into Navy, Army and so on, Air\nForce, and as a swimmer, I joined the Navy and was trained to become an underwater\ndemolition expert. So what we learned there was rather interesting, spent a lot of time in\nthe water. Didn't have to go to church because services were generally on Sunday\nmornings purposely, traveled a lot to compete in other cities of Germany, camaraderie,\nnice friends, yes. And Nazis as such or the philosophy of national socialism didn't enter\nour brain very much; we were a little too young to understand all that. We saw more or\nless the victorious aspect of Germany, that means coming up with something new in the\nindustry and designing a new airplane and being number one in this and so on, and\neventually of course came the war. So the answer to your question was I liked it very\nmuch, yes, it was very enjoyable. It was like -- like in a way like somebody joining the\nBoy Scouts here.",
        "A: Every week.",
        "A: Yes, every week, Sunday, every week. Of course the coaching -- swimming coaching\nwas three times a week but then Hitler Youth services was Sunday and there were\nholidays where we had to meet and march and sing and so on, yeah. So there were\nspecial meetings, let's say, on the 1st of May we would -- we would be driven to\nNuremberg to march there with the flags and so on, you know, and I swam in Stuttgart. I\nswam in Breslau, I swam in Ried (ph) in Austria, so...",
        "A: Iswam 100-meter breast stroke. At that time, shortly after I started, breast stroke was\ndivided 100 strokes to swim butterfly and breast stroke, and butterfly didn't have a\ndolphin kick but it had a breast stroke kick, so there has been a quite an evolution in\nswimming.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Yeah, I was quite successful, yes, and then later on I became the goalie because the\ngoalie of the German water polo team had a fatal accident so they were looking for one,\nand during a little training period, I played goalie and I was pretty good, so they asked me\nto stay. So I became the goalie of the water polo team, and that was more fun than\nanything, except we played a lot in -- outside and sometimes the water was about 14, 16,\nice cold, ice cold. So, yeah, but it was enjoyable because it was a camaraderie and...",
        "A: We had classes, yes. We had classes and learned many things theoretically, others in\npractice, like the language of the flags and some Morse alphabet, et cetera, et cetera,\nthose. Learned about Bruttoregistertonnen, what all that meant, the size of a ship and so\non. The armed forces or the Hitler Youth equal to the armed forces was also divided into\nranks, like the GI and the corporal and the -- and so on. So many of the guys I didn't like\nbecame lieutenants and captains and I had to salute them, and I didn't like that idea very\nmuch because I had absolutely no respect for them. I thought they were a bunch of\nsissies. So that brought upon the first resentment, the first problems and that --",
        "A: School?",
        "A: Oh, well, school was of course corporal punishment. If you didn't behave, you had to\nwait to until physical education class when you had nothing but your shorts on, bend over\nand there was a little bumble stick and so..",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh yes.",
        "A: [had Dr. Bach (ph) was probably my favorite teacher. He eventually left because he\nwas a reserve officer in World War I. He was a captain and so he stayed in the reserve\nand then left and that was -- that was bad because I missed him very much. He was the\nway a teacher is supposed to be.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, he taught well. He shared. He considered and expected students to listen to\nhim, to obey, but he was fair in everything, so I was one of the top students while he was\nthere.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: He taught German, German grammar and history. Yeah, I think that was it, but he\nwas what 1s called a Klassenlehrer, that means the principal teacher, and besides that, and\nof course we had the biology teacher, the one who taught physics and chemistry, one who\ntaught geography. And then as the teachers left because they had to join the Army, we\nhad women teachers, and the poor ladies, we made their life so, so difficult. Oh God, I\nfelt sorry for them.",
        "A: Well, I remember one day I brought home a little piece of reproduce but identical\nlooking pile of dog poo poo, okay. And then another guy brought some kind of\nphosphorous thing that stank like hell so we put this close to the pult (ph), you know, and\nthen everybody in the classroom {Sniffing sounds} and then the teacher started {Sniffing\nsounds! and then she said oh, God, and then everybody laughed like hell. So things of\nthat nature, you know, and...",
        "A: Now, I don't know best friend. I had some Jewish friends, but I liked them mostly\nbecause when I went to their homes they had always an assortment of cookies. I mean\nJewish mothers are very, very, very nice ladies. So yeah, I liked them, got along well\nwith them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Like everybody else, yeah. Things began to -- began to change after the\nKristallnacht, that was a change, and then of course they had to wear the David Star and\nthen, well, then --",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Well, we non-Jews were then taught, I think the biology teacher taught us what the\ntypical Jew was like. He was only interested in making money. He could not be found in\nprofessions like farmer or work with his hands; businessman, money changer and so on.\nThen the physical attributes, their noses, flat feet and so on, we learned about that, and we\nwere told then to stay away from them, to -- not to have any kind of association with\nthem.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: They were kind of the silent partners of -- of -- of -- of the geschenes (ph), things\nhappened but they were kind of shaken or didn't know what to say or not to say.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Something I didn't believe, I questioned it, because I had such a good experience with\nthe freundlich and the frohliche and the families with whom I had a very nice contact,\nthey were nice to me, so I said why, and I mean we had Jewish neighbors. So of course\nwhile this was going on, on the other hand, we got indoctrination in every way possible,\nnewspapers, Sturmer, education, the teachers. I mean we were fed entire Judaism from\nleft and right, and I assume that some -- some -- some youngsters probably asked\nthemselves whether there was not something true about those things. My question was\nonce when the persecution started, I helped once as an altar boy, and I didn't like the\nchaplain very much because he's always late, I had to wake him up, but one day I asked\nhim, I said, why is there so much hatred? I mean Jesus was Jewish. It's there written on\nthe cross, INRI, Jesus von Nazareth, Konig der Juden. Walter, you're not allowed to ask\nquestions. You have to believe. So I felt that was rather stupid as anything I ever heard\nand -- but I didn't say anything, but I was dumbfounded, let's put it that way. And my\nfather was extremely critical. My father was in World War I from the first day till the\nlast day. He was in every major battle. He was wounded three times and he was very\nmuch anti Hitler, and he heard -- listened to the NBC or CBS, NBC, CBS -- CBS, and my\nuncle told him, be careful, they're going to catch you one of these days, you'll end up in a\nconcentration camp.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: BBC.",
        "A: British, British, yeah. And so what this little Hitler, what he expects going to Russia,\nI mean he's going to bleed to death and all these poor young boys will be killed. So that\nwas kind of my father's spiel, but he very soon, thanks to his knowledge of languages, in\nthis case, French, he spoke French fluently, he became the liaison officer for the French\nheavy industry during the German occupation with headquarters in Lille, northern\nFrance, so I didn't see much of him. And I had lost my brother in mountain climbing. He\nfell to his death. So it was my mother and I, and then I didn't spend much time in school.\nI spent -- I mean much time at home. And a -- well, the day came when the school\nexpelled me.",
        "A: Because the windowsill of the old school building, there was a board, and from the all\nthe rain throughout the years and years and years had become brittle, and you could pick\nitup. And I said oh, that would be wonderful to just let's it sail down, and so one of the\nclassmates, I says said when somebody comes let me know. Somebody came. Well, that\nsomebody was a teacher, he just walked by, and it ended on the back of his head and then\nof course went into 1,000 pieces, and I was called and Dr. Fettweiss (ph), he was the\ndirector, the principal. Nobody want to say anything, so we had these big lush eyebrows,\nand he went to one, did you do it? Did you do it? When he came to me, I broke down\nand I said yes, I did. So I was expelled and then I went to I think the first boarding\nschool I went to -- or the first boarding school I went to was Switzerland, went to a very,\nvery exclusive boarding school where --",
        "A: At St. Gallen. When?",
        "A: Well, that must have been, let's see, that must have been about '37, I'm pretty sure,\nand from + and so on and so forth, and those were the kind, and my father was not\nthat wealthy but there was somebody who liked me very much and felt that I needed -- I\ndeserved special consideration, so I think he paid part of the school. So I went there for a\nyear, but then I painted the walls and so on, and so they asked me to leave, so then I went\nto Bornheim.",
        "A: Yeah, I just -- they were -- they were blank walls, so I thought, well, I should bring a\nlittle color into the environment there. I was always very artistic, even as a kid. So well,\nmy father had to pay to clean the walls, repaint them, and I left and I went to a school in\nBornheim. I think I wrote about my school in Bornheim. You want me to go into that?",
        "A: The school was in the center of town. The school was -- where we slept was\ndowntown and the school was a little out of town. So where we slept, it was an old\nbuilding, like the buildings here in Washington, old stone building, three story. The\nupper stories where the director and his family lived and then the different floors were\ndifferent rooms where the students lived. I lived with the son of a physician. He always\nhad a little money. And the food was absolutely disgustingly terrible, and around\nChristmas time, upstairs, they were baking. And you can imagine the aroma going\nthrough the building, but the cookies were not made for us. So when I found a way, the\ndirector had gone I think to an opera or something like that. So I found my way in and\nemptied the cookies and distributed them throughout the school, and I said, well, I better\nnot be here when he comes back. So I told my roommate, I said come on, let's go. We\nwere on the third floor. We put sheets together -- bed sheets, climbed out of the window,\nand then he said, I can't go on. Why? I can't do it to my father, he'll never forgive me.\nSo we went in front of the door and waited for the director to come, and I took off. And\nthen I didn't have -- I just a few marks, I didn't have enough to take the train. And I don't\nknow, I have gypsy blood or something like that. I went down to the -- to the river and\nwas successful in convincing one of the captains to take me on the barge, you know the\nbarges that go down, and that was a very, very pleasant trip because the captain had his\nwife on the barge with him, and I helped her to hang up or to hang her clothes that she\nwashed, and you could see her bra and underwear and everything was flowing there with\nthe wind, colorful thing. Well, that's how I arrived if Dusseldorf, and when I came to my\nmother, she already had a letter from the director of the school. Why do you do that to\nus? Why can't you be different? Your father, what is he going to say? You don't have to\ntell him. Well, so I went back to the Dusseldorg school, Ignazio, and I think I was in the\nObertertia, that's when I became involved in the Edelweisspiraten and found a lot of\nactivities to dampens my adventurism.",
        "A: Well, he didn't know until he was told that I was arrested.",
        "A: And as a matter of fact, he was called from France to come.",
        "A: Not if Switzerland of course there was a Hitler Youth, and in Bornheim -- in\nBornheim, yes, but there was not much Hitler Youth, no, no.",
        "A: They separated us what?",
        "A: Yeah, and I don't really know why we at any point in time have a Hitler Youth in\nBornheim, and I'll have to think about it, really, but we did not, but when I came back to\nDusseldorf, then of course I went back to Hitler Youth, and then my activities started\nwith the Edelweisspiraten and that was a new adventure almost every day.",
        "A: That I had?",
        "A: Oh, several I detested. As a matter of fact there was one -- there was one who would\nask you a question which had two answers, kind of. If you answered A, he would hit\nyou; if you answered B, he would hit you, so you couldn't please him. We called him a\nNilpferd, a hippopotamus because he had one wooden foot, so when he came {making\nnoises}, you could hear him come. And I told my father about it, and my father of course\nwas absolutely sure that I deserved it, until one boy came to my home one day. I think\nfather was in the hospital, so he came and had dinner with us, and my father asked him,\nhe said, oh, no, he hits anybody, guilty or not guilty. So my father looked at me -- he was\na very radical man. I'm very much like him in many ways, and he said, he hits you\nwithout a reason, you hit him back, you hear, you hear. So the word run through the class,\nWalter's going to hit him. Well, the next day he didn't hit me, and the next day he didn't\nhit me but then he hit me and I hit him back. I hit him back and I ran. I ran to the\nprincipal's office. I said I was crying, I hit the teacher, but he hit everybody _+\nMy father had to come to school, and my father raised hell. The teacher was transferred\nto another place and so that was one of the -- one of the big incidents. Another thing, at\nthat time, I became sexually very active at a very young age. I found these elderly ladies\nwho -- who took a liking to me and taught me, which was so much more interesting than\nschool, and, well, that's the way it went until January of 1943. Of course by that time,\nGermany was bombed. It was very much the center of the war and food was hard to\ncome by. So in the evening I went to see my friends, the French prisoners of war that I\nmet with my friends. We played pool and we talked to -- about what to do next. So we\nwould hide their bicycles or -- see, there's a reflector on the fender of a bicycle on the\nback so that you see it when you drive behind them, and we would hang condoms on that\nthing and so things of that nature. And we got away with little things. We want to do\nsomething better, maybe just take one wheel out of the bicycle and leave the bicycle there\nwith only one wheel or take the entire bicycle away, things like that. I always thought\nwhat are we going to do next, and we had a group and let's go maybe during the apple\nseason, we would get together on our bikes. Of course we all had bikes. I had a racing\nbike. I would go to next town and put the bike against the tree, climb on the bike and\nthen collect apples. Swimming in between -- well, until I was arrested and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don't know exactly when rationing started, but I believe that by '43 we had rationing\ncards and the black market began. My father was born in the Eiffel region close to the\nBelgium border, I mean next door to the Belgian border, and so we always -- he went\nthere and came back with butter and schmaltz and eggs, and so that when he went to\nFrance of course we always had coffee and so we did not suffer. Ration cards alone was I\nthink 50 Klonfleisch, or Fleischnon, or anything that's sausage or meat at 50 gramm per\nweek and, very little in terms of fat, butter fat, whatever, that was rationed. So -- but the\npropaganda, in which the Germans probably became the masters in the world, was so that\npeople were happy to sacrifice for the good of the country, so you didn't hear too many\npeople bitch or cried or complain.",
        "A: Kraft durch Freude {singing}. They are big things, Kraft durch Freude, you know,\nexcursions, all that was done for the people to enjoy, to -- and if you didn't feel good,\nwell, the the doctor prescribed einnakur (ph) which they didn't sell anywhere in the world\nbut in Germany I think, so you were allowed to spend three weeks in the Schwarzwald\nbecause everything paid for and oh...",
        "A: Yes, I was -- when I went on vacation, I was very anxious to get to my father's\nhometown, because I loved to be with animals. My great uncle -- oh, it's hard to believe,\nwhen I think about Germany so highly civilized and tremendous, advancement in\nindustry and so on, well, the little town of Holoratz (ph) in the Schneeeifel, my\ngrandmother, my father's mother, like most girls in the town, were sent down in the\nvalley to work as a maid and possibly to find a husband. So my grandmother met my\ngrandfather, and I think they went to the haystack together and my father became the\nresult, and when the people realized that she was -- that my grandmother was pregnant,\nthey threw stones at her until the priest of the town said may he who cast the first stone,\nyou know. So then up in that old building, which was the house in which my father was\nborn was building 1640, and it still stands, so up -- what a very poor area, 1890, poor\nperiod, and out of straw they built a mattress and that's where he was born, almost like\nJesus Christ, and he loved it there. He was very happy, but to give you an idea what\nthings were like, I asked my father one day, I said something that you remember that\nreally had an impact on you? Yep. One day I was with a friend and we looked up the\nroad, the Kuhstrasse it's called because the cows were driven up there to go to pasture,\nand we saw the priest behind a tree peeing, and we looked at each other and we knew\npriests don't pee and we made it very clear they would not tell anybody because they\nwould call us liars. So the holy men don't pee. And so in this little town you would see\nthe blind obedience to the church, blind obedience to the Burgermeister, and so on. This\nobedience was reflected all over Germany, whether it was the Kaiser or whether it was\nHitler, it didn't make any difference. So it wasn't too difficult for somebody to take over\nand exploit this kind of sentiment, but I went there because I didn't have to brush my\nteeth in the morning. I didn't have to wash up. It was ideal. And I tell you, you had to\ntake care of cows, the neighbor's cows and several cows got together and I had to take\nthem together with the dog and a stick and I had to take them to a certain pasture, and the\npastures had no fences, so I had to keep the cows from walking into the potato fields.\nOkay. That was my job. It was beautiful. My great aunt would make a head of bread\nabout this size. I remember she would put it under her bosom and make a slice of it the\nsize -- everything was homemade, homemade ham, homemade everything.",
        "A: Yep. And she made ciders for me to take home. Oh, it was so good, and I went\nthere. And I remember there was a girl in the area also took care of some cows, that we\nbecame friends and we started -- spoke in Lorbeerblatt, whatever they are. It's a shrub.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Laurel leaf, yeah, yeah, that's right. So {making noise} oh, it was beautiful, so I\nloved to be in there. I really loved to be there and I have been there many times even\nafter the war.",
        "A: Yes, I knew him. Hated his guts. He was a devout, stupid Catholic, stupid in the\nsense he didn't ask questions. He accepted and made it his own knowledge, but he was\nnot very nice to my mother, and he kind of respected me because I didn't agree with him\nand I openly said so. I was a tough kid, and he died of diabetes, I think, and he wanted to\nsee me. I said I don't want to see him, so I didn't go.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: No, no, he was -- he was Mannesmann (ph - correct), the famous German company,\nMannesmann. Among other things they built seamless pipes and they had a plant in\nHelenta (ph), which was close to Holoratz (ph) and he would manage the horses and take\nthose pipes to the railroad station, and they wanted him to take over the horses into sort of\nin the main plant, so that's how we got to Dusseldorf. And then after awhile, he was a\nrather ambitious -- was in the army and then he joined the police force, and he made a\nname for himself, because he apprehended one of the most ferocious criminals at the time\nwho had chopped up children and so. It was an atrocious thing. And then he was\nextremely strong. He looked a little bit like Khrushchev, a stocky old bull, and he would\naccompany prisoners because they would get extra pay for that, and then he built a\nbeautiful home. So he was very ambitious and became a lieutenant and was known as the\nPolizeimeier, and we walked -- I had this chain here with a watch and walked, had no\nhair whatsoever. I mean it was just like, like bald headed old bull, and the kids saw him\nand said Polizeimeier, and they would disappear with their soccer balls and so on when\nhe came. But there he was. His wife had died rather young, and then he had a\nhousekeeper and I believe also his mistress. I don't know this, but I think so. So I saw\nhim rather infrequently. I didn't like him. I liked my mother's father. Yeah, he was a\nkind old man.",
        "A: He was a roofer, a roofer for only cathedrals and churches, so I have a picture of him\nwas high, high on the upper part of the town church, you see, and then as SA come, he\nwas a forest ranger for a noble man, so he went hunting and so on. I used to see him with\nhis long pipe, and he had the longest legs I ever seen, and he was able not only to put one\nleg under the other, he did one more curve and he did that. Opa, do it once -- one more\ntime, and he did. Oh, I got a kick out of that, and he was actually the first one I did a\ndrawing of with my fountain pen, and my teacher didn't believe that I had done it.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yeah, but I don't remember his name, my art teacher. I'd say Johans, but I don't\nguarantee that that was right. And when he realized just I did it, then he took me to the\nKunstakadmie for Dusseldorf, which is one of the best known Kunstakadmien in Europe.\nAnd there I was exposed to weird looking professors with beards, I mean they look like\nhippies but hippies in the '40s, and my first thing was to nacktzeichnen. That means draw\nnudes. Well, you know, at 11 or 12 years old, to see a naked lady in front of you, it rather\nleft an impact on me and I don't know, I guess my pencil was a little shaking. I\nremember when I used my single little bit of __ + Everything had to be done with\na pencil. Well, that's where I had my first art instruction. I didn't last very long, I think\nthree months or something like that. There was always something. Then -- then -- then\nmy parents had a friend who was an opera singer and I was a happy guy. I always sang,\nand he heard my voice I think in the bathroom I was singing, and he said do you mind if I\ngive a private lessons? No. And he was going to prepare me for the music conservatory\nin Cologne. I had to go there. I had to sing Schubert's An die Musik {singing}. Oh, very\ndifficult song. And they thought I was not quite good enough as a soloist, so I thought\nthat I would be all right in the choir, and I didn't think that I -- I think I was too good for\nthe choir, so I didn't stay there. So I had many interests. I had a problem that I was born\nwith quite a few talents, none of them developed to the extreme, but I knew this and I\nknew this and I knew this and I knew a little of everything. I learned languages just like\nthat. So I had a problem I want to be a movie star. I wanted to be locomotive driver. I\nwanted to be, you name it, so anyway. More questions, please.",
        "A: When?",
        "A: Oh, just because. That was not -- that was -that was a volunteer thing. I went there in\naddition to school. Okay. So I just didn't like it. So I don't want to go back, and since\nmy father was not at home, there was nobody who could handle me. See, my mom --\nfather handled me brutally, and my mother tried love but she was not quite strong\nenough, poor little woman, so...",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: Yeah. The Jungvolk was very much like the Boy Scouts, little camping trips, and it\nwould please me enormously that I became a drummer, and so I could show off with my\ndrum and get a little attention that way, which I needed badly, and even my mother said\nwould you show me again, drum a little bit. So I drummed and I sang. I was a happy\nlittle fellow. So the Jungvolk was, I would have to admit that it was a pleasure for a\nyoung boy to join the Jungvolk, and I repeat, it was just as enjoyable as it is my son to be\npart of the Boy Scouts.",
        "A: Adolf Hitler Schule was a select -- I think there were two, maybe three out of Hitler\nschool in Germany, and they were there to train, indoctrinate young men to become\nleaders, let's say, with some exaggeration, like the LBJ School of Public Affairs in\nAustin, Texas who will train people to become excellent in government administration.\nThis was a little similar, but only one sided, in other words, all under the umbrella of\nnational socialism. And to enter there, you had to go through -- you would have to be\nhighly recommended and you had to go through a preschool, through a screening process\nand so on. So I think my father didn't quite know what was involved, so I went to the, to\nthe first essetapa can\u2019t identify word (ph), the first step of a screening school, passed that,\nand then my father got a letter which he had to sign and he refused to sign because he\nthought that was a little too much for a young man and he just did not agree. So he didn't\nsign, so I didn't go. So the Hitler school was maybe the equivalent, if you want to\ncompare to going to a Jesuit school to become a priest, okay. It would be totally a one-\nsided education.",
        "A: Why my father didn't like it?",
        "A: Yes, I believe I was a little upset, but I don't think I took it too seriously. Yes, I was\nupset, but I was used to my father saying no to something that I wanted badly so...",
        "A: Not schooling per se. You had of course theoretical instructions in the branch. Let's\nsay the Navy. You would learn about how ships operate, the size of ships and what you\ndo in the Navy. So the theoretical part you would learn, and how to speak with flags and\nthe different ranks, history of the navy, yes, but most of it was the practical aspect of it.",
        "A: Yes. You would learn how to -- how to use breathing apparatus underwater. You\nwould learn to connect magnetic bombs underwater and you would train to bomb ships\nunderwater, ships that would be anchored in a port and --",
        "A: Yeah, it was interesting. It was adventurous, because you would swim with clothes\non. You would swim with clothes and shoes on. I mean there were scenarios where you\nwould think that you under pressure and you have a gun with you and how can you swim\nwith all this weight and so on. So it was an interesting scenario, yes, and besides you\nwould -- you would be treated as somewhat of a special guy. You were a prince. You\nwere a little champion, you know.",
        "A: Well, you were not just any ordinary guy, you were a super athlete.",
        "A: Well, were you treated with a little more respect like -- than an ordinary guy and...",
        "A: Yes. Before the Hitler Youth existed, swimmers or athletes in general would\nrepresent a club, let us say that I would swim for the swim club of Washington and we\nwould have a big swim meet going on in Washington sponsored by the federation --\nswimming federation and invite clubs from Philadelphia, from all around they would\ncome and swim here. Well, the Hitler Youth took over, so now I would swim\nrepresenting the Hitler Youth, Section 6 of Dusseldorf, swimming against the Hitler\nYouth, Section 9 of Frankfurt, and there whether different cities represented different\nsections of the Hitler Youth. So to find out who was the best swimmer in the Hitler\nYouth, okay, and it culminated in the Reichsjugendmeisterschaft, that means the youth\nchampionship in swimming.",
        "A: Yes, twice.",
        "A: I was third once and fourth once, so I was --",
        "A: Well, pretty high up. I was -- I was all right but I was not on top, and really I\nparticipated in the German championship, the open championship and I was third and that\nwas pretty good, but you had to consider that some of the best swimmers were already in\nthe Navy, so they didn't participate. So my competition was rather limited.",
        "A: {Speaking Spanish} 58:30. Les juventud hitlerisito pues eres una organization un\npoquito comos los Boy Scouts, dividido lo mes moque, lo fuerzas armados, lo armado\nfuerzas eres, lo marina y por su puesto como matodar, y tuve que entrar en lo armada y\nhi un entrentor como especialiste en colorer bombes bejo agua, y me divedi mucho\nporque cada dis ero algo interesante y aprende mucho de los barcos, de los uniformes, lo\nhistorie de la armada, los diferentes guerres.

        "A: The edelweiss pirates -- well, edelweiss is the flower that only grows up in the high\nmountains of the Alps. It's a pretty flower and it represents bravery, strength. My\nbrother tried to pick edelweiss for his mother and fell to his death and they found him\nwith edelweiss in his hands, so edelweiss in my family was something very special. A\ngroup in Berlin started the Edelweisspriaten, how did you hear about them?",
        "A: News got around they were persecuted, as you would hear about saboteur and\ncommitted sabotage and so on, and that triggered an interest in we could do something\nlike that. And there was enough hatred, disrespect for our leaders, and I'm talking about\nour immediate leaders, that means companions who now became lieutenants and captains\nand we had to respect and salute them and listen to them and obey them, and that was\ndefinitely against my nature. And I found quite a few comrades who, for adventurous\nreasons, for one reason or the other sided with me and said yeah, let's have some fun. So\nI have to emphasize that I was a little too young, even though after the war, we were\nconsidered political prisoners, but really, there was no real ideological reason because I\ndidn't understand national socialism as I would understand it today. It was more of a\nmovement based upon rebellious nature, protest against blind obedience, this sort of\nthing. So we formed a chapter in Dusseldorf and hoped that eventually we would\nestablish contact with the Edelweisspiraten in Berlin, but we did not. So then we spent\nquite a bit of time thinking of what we could do to make their, in quote, their life more\ndifficult.",
        "A: Well, our leaders, the ones we hated, our captains and lieutenants and captains.",
        "A: Yeah, yes, yes.",
        "A: Oh, we were about 12.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: Ha, well, I told you before we would -- all the reflectors on the bicycles, on their\nbicycle, we could hang condoms there, and especially we would put them there in the\ndark so they would not discover them right away and take them off. They would ride the\nbike and then somebody started laughing because they drove behind them. So we'd do\nthat. Steal the bike. Deflate the tires, we would do that rather frequently, paint things on\ntheir -- put poo poo on the bike, whatever.",
        "A: We would generally meet in what was called in Dusseldorf Cafe Meintz (ph). They\nhad in the back, they had billiard room, so we'd play pool. That's where we had our\nmeetings. What are we going to do next, and so fun, as I said I became interested in\nwomen, had an affair with our mail woman and looked for adventure of any sort, but in\nthis particular framework, it was generally thinking about how can we make those stupid\nidiots' life a little more difficult.",
        "A: Dropped out? That would have been impossible because it was obligatory to join.\nYou had to have a qualified reason, like maybe losing one leg or something like that, that\nyou couldn't do it, but as long as you were healthy and you didn't have Jewish blood for\nfive generations, then you had to join.",
        "A: Ha. Well of course we tried to be as clandestine as possible, so on the surface, we\nwere just very loyal members of the Hitler Youth and our movement was rather\nunderground. Okay. So it was so it was what in Germany you call Schikane, based upon\nour dislike for authority.",
        "A: They didn't know. They didn't. My father was in France so there was only my\nmother. I was the only one left. My brother had died. He died 1n'41. And so I was the\nonly one left and she never knew what I was and sometimes I didn't come home at night,\nand the poor woman. Why are you -- I didn't know, I just -- I should have been born in\nwest Texas on a big ranch.",
        "A: Oh, there was -- yeah, there was Eddie Violent (ph) was one.",
        "A: Yes, he still is. He's dying, but I talk to him once in awhile. He's still hanging in\nthere.",
        "A: He was a neighbor.",
        "A: He's the one, Eddie, who took over -- who took over the Jewish bar. When I was\narrested, Eddie knew him, so he went over and stayed -- for the rest of the war, he stayed\nwith Eddie.",
        "A: Maybe -- maybe -- I don't know, maybe I should think a little more about what I did\nand how I did it, but maybe one of the things was that we did not enjoy the procedure of\nthe Hitler Youth being helpful in the prosecution of Jews, which they were, and I had\nthese friends, they didn't do any harm to anybody. They were nice kids and so on, and so\nwe were very much interested in helping the underdog. So we considered the Jews\nunderdogs. And so this one guy, when we knew they were being evacuated and sent to\nplaces, well, we didn't want him to go. I didn't know his parents, and so I just thought\none day if you don't want to go, you can stay with me. And so he stayed with me for, oh,\nI don't know, I would say probably six months or eight months. And it was not broadcast\nin my family that he's a Jew. It was just he's a young man who needs a little help and can\nhe stay with us? Yeah, he can sleep in my brother's bed, you see. And so in the\napartment housing which we lived in, there were a total of six parties, +. So they\ndidn't know that he was a Jewish boy. It was not broadcast. He was just a friend. And\nso when I was arrested, then -- I believe that when I had a visit with -- from my mother,\nthe question came out of what are we going to do with Hans Dieter (ph)? I said call\nEddie Violent he's going to take care of him. So he took over. That was just one block\nfrom our house, and his situation was a little nicer because he lived a house. The house\nwas his. Okay. So he had a little more freedom and who walked in his house. Okay.\nAnd he stayed with him for the rest of the war. What happened with him afterwards, I do\nnot know, and I asked Eddie and he didn't know -- oh, yeah. He told me one day, he said\nguess what? You you remember Hans\u2019? Yeah. He died.",
        "A: Hans Dieter Von Schwejk (ph).",
        "A: But I don't know whether the parents ended up most likely in the concentration camp\nsomewhere. I don't know details. I don't know what happened to him after the war, so...",
        "A: Eddie, yeah, Eddie is extremely, extremely talented with his hands. He can build\nanything. I have to ship a stove. He built a stainless stove for me. I have to ship it, it's\ntoo damn heavy, but I have to ship it to the States sometime. So he would help us many\nif we want to break in somewhere, he would give us the key or the Dietrich it's called in\nGermany. It's kind of thing that fits any lock. So he would do things like that, and yeah,\nanything mechanical and so on, he would help. That was mostly his work. He was not a\nvery athletic type. He was more the thinker and the doer.",
        "A: I think what was more than anything was that you could not argue. You could not\ndiscuss. You had to accept whatever was said as the final truth, and I liked the idea of\nasking why and how and you couldn't. So that was a little against my nature of just\naccepting things blindly.",
        "A: From radio, BBC, from some foreign magazine. My father bought some home once\nin awhile, books.",
        "A: The POW? Well, my father was a linguist, and as a little boy, he would see to it that I\nspoke French. So he would tell me in French, get me my slippers or good evening. And\nso I know my father or I knew my father only as pere, which is father in French. I never\ncalled him Papi or father, it's always pere. And so not too far from my home was a\nfactory -- paper machine factory, and in the basement of the factory were French\nprisoners of war. And understand that there were quite a few factories where they put the\nprisoners in the bottom and made the enemy -- somehow made the enemy know that\nthere were prisoners so they wouldn't bomb the factory and kill their own people. And so\nthe lower windows had these had these iron bars, and through them I could see them and\nthere was enough to shake hands or to give them something, so I went there once and\npracticed French. Bonsoir, mes amis. Comment \u00a2a va? And so -- Qu'est-ce que vous\navez besoin? What do you need. I remember one gave me a little piece of wood and he\nhad written down, when will the French prisoners of war be liberated? And I thought oh,\nGod, I have no answer for this. I don't know. I felt a little bad that I didn't have an\nanswer, but I brought them things to eat. I didn't have much, but I brought them a little\nbread or things. And then they gave me letters to send, and when my father came to town\n-- that was one thing about my dad. He was very much in favor of helping the underdog,\nand you should see the testimony he got from French men after the war. It was very\nbeautiful. And he became an immediate chief interpreter of the French military\ngovernment because -- so anyway, I gave them the letters and he would see that the\nletters would go to their destination in France and I would get answers back, and so I was\nthe middle man kind of. And yeah, I was -- I went there at least three times -- three times\na week and somehow -- you know, in Germany, neighbors know what you're doing. I\nmean you cannot do anything without somebody knowing. Spitzel. They watch over\nyou. So somehow my activities with the French prisoners of war became known, not to\nthe point where they prosecuted me immediately or looked for me, but it became known.\nSo that 1s what the judge brought up, and you know, from the police when I was arrested\nand went to the police pres -- first through polizei revier Polizeirevier, and then to the\npolizei presidio Polizeiprasidium and then the Gestapo until eventually I went to prison,\nbut then things came up. You like French, huh? That's how it started. So I don't\nremember your last question.",
        "A: Yeah, oh, yeah. The POWs. So those -- those -- that's my POWs. That's why I tried\nto help them with a little food here and there and take their letters and bring them mail\nfrom their families, and so they were happy to see me and I was happy to practice a little\nFrench with them.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: Well, of course the siren, when it started, went {making noise} and then when it was\nover it would go {making noise}., monotone. Well, when it started, everybody would\nrun as fast as possible into the basement or to the bunker. There were bunkers all over\ntown, and then would you hear the bombs falling. Dusseldorf was destroyed 75 percent.\nSo yeah, and in '43, it became a nightly affair. Dusseldorf or the vicinity was bombed.\nIt's a very industrial city and very close to the rural region where all the steel industry of\nGermany is So...",
        "A: By affected, you would wake up in the morning, and these houses over there didn't\nexist anymore, they were ruins and you would have to go a long way around to get where\nyou wanted to go and things like that. And you heard that such and such family, they\nwere killed during the bombardment. And I heard once this guy, believe it or not, he\nsurvived with his bed. He ended up in the other house across the street. Things like that.\nAnd so, yeah, that's how I was affected, and we lived south of town, which was a\nresidential area which was not heavily bombed.",
        "A: Volksschadlinge, oh yeah, the Volks Schadlinge Volksschadlinge.",
        "A: Of course in Dusseldorf and every major square you had several things. Once a week\nyou had the farmers -- the farmer's market there, and then generally you had restrooms\nunderneath, and then you had the Stiirmer, and loudspeakers. When Hitler spoke of\ncourse, he would sit there and listen to the loudspeakers, and the Sturmer of course would\nbring out the newest in -- in what the Jews did, what they had done, what they did, how\nthey behaved, how terrible they were and so on and so forth. Cartoons of Jews, picture of\nJews, the Jewish barber accused of raping a customer and so on and so forth.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, sure. You would stand there. It was up there. It was like a showcase with\nthe newspaper filled the entire, you know, the page of a newspaper, filled the entire case.\nAs a matter of fact, you have one in the -- in the -- in the holocaust museum. Yeah, it's a\nreplica. It's perfect. That's -- that's it. Yeah, people would stand there, yeah, and read\nand they would read in front of the newspaper building. They put out not only Sturmer,\nbut they put out the daily newspaper. So people stood there in line, but yeah, Sturmer,\nyeah, it was always something new, yeah.",
        "A: Well, taking property was something that happened not infrequently. After\nKristallnacht, it was a common thing, and of course -- of course after the Jews had no\nrecourse. It was nothing they could do, whether they liked it or not. And I often wonder\nif the guy had not killed \u2014_, what would have happened. Something else would have\nhappened, I'm pretty sure but...so, so Sturmer, yeah, sure, people stood there. Some\nlaughed because some of the cartoons were funny with the big noses and so on.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: A friend of mine and I walked out of the pool room after we heard the siren. It was\nafter an attack, a bomb attack. We walked outside and this is on the Kings Avenue. It's\nlike Fifth Avenue. It's one of the well-known streets in the world, in Berlin in\nDusseldorf, fancy stores, expensive stores. It's a very fashion city, Dusseldorf, and wide\navenues beautiful trees, parks and so on. Anyway, we walked out, and right next to the\nCafe Meintz (ph) was a shoe store, and the shoes were just all over the place, so we didn't\nhave to get into the store to get them. We picked them up on the street, and -- but 1t was\ndark. So it was cold. It was January, and I just stuffed a bunch of, I think five or six. I\nstuffed them in here and said let's go, and we went to the -- believe it or not, we went out\nto Adolf Hitler Platz. The lights went on and people came out of the bunker, and I looked\nat the shoes and I realized they were all lefties, and I thought golly. Well, an old lady\ncame -- an elderly lady came. I said, would you like some shoes? Here, why don't I\nmake you happy. I have my shoes. Oh, come on. I tried to persuade her, and I didn't see\nthe policeman that was there. Hey, what do you have there? And I said nothing. Let me\nsee. And I started running, and he whistled, and I think I made three blocks or something\nand there was a guy a big bear of a guy like you, and he opened his arms. He gave me a\nbear hug. Yep, and so I was taken to the polizei revier Polizeirevier, and from there I\nwent to the polizei presidio Polizeiprasidium, headquarters. And then questions,\nquestions, questions, and then because they felt that I was -- I think they felt that I should\nbe interviewed by the Gestapo. So I went to the I think {?Prinzgelstrasse?} where the\nGestapo was, and I had to undress and then examined me and they didn't -- oh, I have to\nmake something clear so it makes more sense. I was born almost circumcised, which does\nhappen. Instead of having the long foreskin -- I mean the head of the penis was sticking\nout a little bit. So when I started to masturbate and have fun sexually, it hurt, and so I\ntold my father. He took me to the doctor, and I remember he said, I give you one mark if\nyou don't scream. So I had to pull the skin back as far as it go, and he came with a long\nneedle and {making noise}, and I got one mark. So but when the Rassenexperte (ph),\n___+he looked at me and said this is a Juden, and so they argued and looked at me and\nthen they called somebody who was really a specialist and he looked at me and no, no,\nno, no. No, he's not Jewish at all, but I almost -- I almost became a Jew there for awhile.\nSo from the Gestapo I was sent to prison, and then and then I went to court on April the\n12th and from then it went on.",
        "A: Through my head?",
        "A: Oh, I was sure that at one point I would be released. If you had told me you're going\nto be locked up for the next two years.\nEnd of File One\nBeginning File Two",
        "A: Well, I think -- I think we finished yesterday with a bear hug.",
        "A: Right. So I couldn't run any longer. I had to surrender, and shortly thereafter, the\npoliceman who wanted to arrest me in the first place, he caught up, took me and took me\nto the police station, and --",
        "A: Yeah, he was very angry to me, as a matter of fact, he got behind me an orfieger (ph),\nand they're going to teach you how to treat a German police officer, and so on, these\nwords, and, oh, maybe an hour later, I was taken to the Polizeiprasidium, which would be\nequal to a police headquarters, and there they tried to get the documents together since\nmine is a rather common name where my parents live, the address, birth date, et cetera, et\ncetera, and when all that was done and I was asked what I had done and I played kind of\ninnocent, I haven't done anything. Well, we will find out about you if you don't want to\ntalk. So I was at the Polizeiprasidium and that's where interrogation continued, or let's\nsay it started all over again, the same questions, and I gave the same answers, but then I\nrealized they knew more than I knew about me, and when that verhor, that interrogation\nended, I was taken to the Gestapo headquarters, and they then forgot the matter of the\nshoes very much. That was not even mentioned. They kind of wanted to hear about the\nEdelweisspiraten, my contact with French prisoners of war and my membership in the\nHitler Youth and why I had done that, and one of them seemed to be a little -- what's the\nword I'm looking for? He didn't quite trust me. So I was asked to undress, and then they\nlooked at my genitals -- genitals and one says, It's a Juden. This is a Jew. No, no. Yes,\nyes. Well, then they called someone who was more of an expert, and he didn't quite\nknow what to do with me, and then they got a super experts, ehnrasseenkundige (ph), and\nhe looked at me and he realized that that no, I was not really circumcised, it was only half\ncircumcision or something like that, and so I was able to get dressed again and one told\nme boy, you're lucky you got away with it. You're lucky you're not Jewish. And I got\ndressed again, and then all this took an hour, two hours. I don't know. And then I was\ndriven to the prison, and the prison I was given prison clothing and I was taken to my\ncell, which was going to be my home for I guess about a month.",
        "A: Oh, no, it was --",
        "A: It was a regular prison, yeah, and I drove by there many times when I went to\nworkout at the swim club. We drove by the prison many times. We made jokes. We call\nit the -- the -- it had a special name. We called coffee so-and-so, cafe so-and-so, and of\ncourse at that time I never dreamed that I would become an occupant of it. Well, I was in\none cell. It was a small cell, with one window, and with a little effort I could look out of\nthe window, at least a little part of it, and I saw a courtyard, and my neighbor next door, a\nyoung man, he yelled all day long, by all day long, liebataten dieant (ph), and God, it was\nhorrible to listen, until his voice got really horse, liebataten (ph), and I heard that later on\nhe ate his own feces and was taken to a state hospital. So well, in the morning, we were to\ntake our kubel, we called it, it was a container out of ceramic container, big container and\nwe had to take this one behind the other and go to the main section where we emptied it\nand rinsed it and then took it back, and in the meantime there, we were able to sit down a\nrow of people and do our business, went back to the cell. And I think maybe the third or\nfourth day, I was asked to join a group, and we were supposed to sew buttons on tents for\nsoldiers. We did that. Then I did another job with something like weeding. And then I\nhave to emphasize this over and over again, that I tried every -- I mean I dreamed of\nescaping, and so I figured that if I don't eat for awhile I'm going to faint probably and\nthey'd take me to a hospital and then from the hospital I can easily escape. So I didn't eat\nfor ten days, and yeah, I kind of fainted, but instead of taken to the hospital, they whipped\nmy butt, because they realized I did this not as an accident but purposely. So that didn't\nwork. Well, I was in that prison until April the 12th when I was taken to the court, and\nthat's where I saw -- after awhile I saw my parents for the first time. My father, my\nmother was there. They looked very stern. My mother was crying and my father had\nengaged the services of two attorneys that didn't do anything. I assumed the attorneys\ndidn't really have much power. They had to say yes and no, and be very obedient to the\njudge who was the most powerful autocrat. And so then the ceremony began. Walter\nMeyer, stand up. You're Walter Meyer. Yeah. You're accused of plunder. That was the\nprosecuting attorney talking, and I don't know whether you're aware, but this\nautomatically called for the death penalty, and one of the attorneys jumped and held my\narm, and said that's not the last word. And, well, they narrated, esplundern aktivitaten the\nEdelweisspiraten forbid den know mitsa creeks fangen and so on.(ph) And then they\nrested their case, and then they excused themselves and went to have I assume a\nconference of some sort. And they came back, the judge then made it clear, said I cannot\ncall this plundern. The most I can call it einfacher Diebstahl, simple theft, and I have\neven questions about that, but this young man needs a strong remedy. He obviously\ndoesn't quite fit into into what our country needs and contact with the enemy destroying\nstate property, all this. However, I have take in to consideration that he was an\noutstanding athlete. I also consider that that he lost one brother and -- but I feel that I\nshould give him a minimum or maximum penalty, which means that after one year of\ngood conduct, he can join the armed forces, so he's got a chance. It all depends upon\nhim. So it's one to four years. If he doesn't have good behavior then he has to stay for\nthree years. Do you understand that? Yes, I understand. Okay. That was the end of the\ncase. Then I was taken -- went back to the prison. Maybe three, four, five days later I\nwas called, get dressed and I was taken to the railroad station, and from there, I went\nwhat is called a German auft transport. (ph) I went first to Cologne, stayed at the Klinger\nPriz prison, (ph) which was rather interesting because we were in cells that had to be\nvacated every so often, because from there you could look down at the courtyard where\nthey would chop heads, okay and we were not supposed to see that. Well, we heard this -\n- the stotten clerk (ph) bim, bim, bim, bim.{making noises} So we had to move to the\nother side, and when the storm was over we went back, but that prison was so full of bugs\n-- red bugs. Oh, it was disgustingly dirty. But I was there maybe two days, three days.\nFrom there, I went to Coblenz. Coblenz to Frankfurt. Frankfurt then by bus to Butzbach,\nand from there we walked, that means a policeman and I. Policeman looked at me and\nsaid, look, let's not have any problems. Walk nicely next to me and we won't have any\nproblem. Don't try to escape. Don't make my life difficult, okay. So he delivered to me\nto the Rockenberg youth prison.",
        "A: Yes, of course.",
        "A: {speaking Spanish} (17:00) entre la corte...la puesa prosecutor y prosecutor lista\ncomitido aver abrogado contacto con prisioneros de guerra frances que nuestros amigos\njuventud hitleristo destruyo propiedad del Estado equal termino entonces...palabra... I\nwent back to the prison.",
        "A: What did I see in the jugendstrafanstalt?",
        "A: Well, first, I was impressed by -- sounds a little funny in prison setting, sounded\nbeautiful, but this was a beautiful setup because it was not a prison per se, but 1t used to\nbe a convent or cloister and the area was rather, rather attractive, and well, like in every\nprison, first you surrender the clothes you have, and they give you a prison uniform.\nThey gave me a cell, which would be my home for awhile, and we had lessons there of\ngeography and so on and so forth, I mean, not very considerable but maybe -- maybe\ntwice a week or maybe only once a week. I don't remember too well. And my neighbor -\n- my neighbor in the cell there after, he was kind of a, like later in the concentration, in\nthe capo, he was a privileged prisoners, his cell door was always open. He could walk in\nand out when he want to, and I found out that he had killed his father. But see killing\nyour father was not as bad as helping French prisoners of war, something like that.\nAnyway in my cell, and then a week, two weeks later, then they found out that I hid -- I\nhad more education than the rest of the prisoners. They were more of the lower echelon\nof society, so it was an elderly police employee who was the buyer. He would buy\nvegetables and things that the kitchen of the prison need, and they needed an assistant and\nhe picked me. And as such of course I could have survived forever there and I would\nhave gained quite a bit of weight because the food was at my disposal, and so I did that\nfor awhile until I had the problem with my attempt to escape. Do you want me to go into\nthat?",
        "A: Well, I was supposed to take control over certain things. That means I had -- I did a\nlittle bureaucracy, what we bought and so on, and nicely organized, and I was in the part\nof the prison that was the cloister at one time, very thick walls, but I found a little\nwindow where the bars, one bar was loose. I could take it out. I assume -- it was a\nconvent, and so it was wear and tear over the years and years and years. So I figured that\nwould be my chance to escape. And I wrote a little note to my father, whom I expected\nto visit, and a little map where he would have to expect me and so on. I mean it was\nnicely detailed, small letters. I folded that, put it in my pocket, and somehow, I don't\nknow how, but I lost the little piece of paper and it was found and I was called before the\nwarden.",
        "A: I would climb out and he would be waiting with a car.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No question. No question. Oh, yes. And of course it was ideal because it was in\nFrance, so I would have disappeared in France, would have been ideal solution, but it\ndidn't work that way. And so no more visits from then on. I went in the dungeon for 28\ndays and --",
        "A: Well, the solitary cell for 28 days, swalik en bot en vasel (ph). So that was my first\nsevere penalty, and after that I had two more like that. So I became an ordinary prisoner\nand oh, I -- I -- I, yes, and one day, I told one of the guards that I would like very much to\nwork in the quarry and he was kind of a nice guy. I'll see what I can do. Okay. So I\nended up in the quarry, which was about I would say 20 miles away from the prison, and\na very, very large pit which had several levels. The levels were occupied by different,\nthey were Russian prisoners, French prisoners, and we were on the top and there was a\nrail going up and one of the privileged prisoners controlled the brakes, that 1s he let the\nfull lorries go down to the valley and brought an empty one up and we had to fill each\nlorry with, what, 12 lorries a day or we would get no food, and we -- the rail for the\nlorries then from the brake station were then two of the different niches where the\nprisoners worked, so I had this and another one had this and so on. And there was one\nprisoner who was quite a bit older than I and he obviously had some practice and he\ntaught me how to pick, how to get a rock out. I never knew what was done with the\nrocks, what kind of mineral they were and they would grind them down there, but what it\nwas for street construction, road construction, I don't know. Anyway there I worked and\nthen of course we were not in the prison anymore. We had our barracks there. We had\nour Own prison, you know, like in a concentration camp. We were a satellite -- satellite\nprison. The food was horrible, just watery soup, and if you didn't have your 12 lorries,\nyou wouldn't get any food at all. The worst thing that ever happened was one of the\nguards was the most royal son of a bitch that I ever met, but we had -- to do our business,\nwe had a pole sticking from one place to the other and a ditch underneath. We sit on the\npole and shit in the ditch so to speak and this -- I had sawed half of the pole, and left it\nthere of course. As the weight increased, it increased, suddenly it broke and we all ended\nup in the shit. And I assure you, I've worked in the country, I bread horses. I know what\nhorses smell like. I know what cows smell like. I know what pigs smell like. Nothing\nworse than human shit, I mean... So then, of course (speaking German). So you try to get\nthis shit off you and then you went, you don't have dry clothes and so that was an awful\nincident, and then --",
        "A: Because I always had in mind to escape, and I felt that being outside in nature there\nwould be a chance, and so about close to Christmas '44, I was called before the warden. I\nsaid looks like that we as a prison authority, we are unable to do any good. You need\nsomething a little more severe, and I believe that the armed forces are probably the best\nartznei, (ph) the best, the best --",
        "A: The best medicine for you. Therefore, I consider sending you to join the armed\nforces. And I softly protested I think. After I had been in the dungeon twice already at\nthat time, I said I'm in no condition to satisfy the demands of the armed forces, so why\ndon't you allow me to go home and recoupe a little bit and then I'll be more than happy to\njoin the forces. I was excused and then as always, the other prisoners, you know, you\nwalk one behind the other asked what happened? What happened? And I said well,\nthey're trying to make cannon fodder out of me, and one of prisoners reported that he\nwanted to join the forces and they wouldn't let him, and I had a sense to do it, but I\nprotested. I didn't want to become cannon fodder. I was called again. Did you say that?\nYes, I did. All right. Thank you. And two days later I was transferred to the youth\nconcentration camp.",
