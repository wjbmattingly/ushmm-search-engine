        "Q: Carl, would you tell us your full name, and when you were born?",
        "A: I was born, of course, uh...",
        "Q: Start with your name.",
        "A: My name 1s Carl--C-A-R-L--H. Kniiemann--K-N-E-U-E-M-A-N-N. Kntiemann. And I was\nborn in Bydgoszcz, Poland. Actually, the Germans called it Bromberg. A very difficult name\nto spell, so...",
        "Q: In what year?",
        "A: Uh, 1922, 15th of November. And, of course, uh I lived there until 1932. And in November,\nwe left Poland because my father was German citizen and businessman. We had a small\nfactory--bakery machinery and stuff like this. Uh, so...",
        "Q: What was it like growing up? You can look at me.",
        "A: Yah. In Poland, actually, compared with Germany, it was a free country. I came to Germany\nexpecting a paradise. My parents had told me that it would be like this. But it turned out that\nlife in Poland was like living in a democracy. There was strike, there was economic\nhardship; and so as a child I was very much aware of it. Most of my friends were Polish boys\nfrom the streets, and so...And uh because there was strife between the German ethnic\nminority and the Poles. The usual fare was, you know, when we had children's dispute or so,\nmy friends came up to me and said, \"Tomorrow!\" It meant actually they were mad at me;\nbut they never came with a knife and cut my throat. I didn't expect them to either, you know.\nThey didn't expect to do that either. So I got really right thrown into, you know, uh ethnic\nproblems. And you get used to it. And uh you are not missing it necessarily, but you are not\ngetting upset about it, you know. My mother is of Hungarian, Polish, and German descent,\nall three. The family came from Hungary originally via Salzburg. And Frederick the Great\ntook these Salzburg Germans into East Prussia. That's where my mother landed. And the\nfamily mixed with Polish uh persons, and so she is a completely relaxed person. My mother\nis Just...1s not getting upset about anything. But already as a child I knew when a problem\ncame up, she stepped right in and helped solving it. She never turned her back. My father\nsame thing. I mean, I lived...I had the luck to be guided by the example of my parents. So it\ndropped out of me to you know, I mean any strife and so on, I am not necessarily personal\nmistakes solving problems, those problems, but sometimes it better to increase the problem\nand make it so bad that people see it once what a foolish thing it was, and they stop it. So I\nwas a happy child. My father was a hunter. He went fishing. He was socially quite active.\nWe had parties our house. Being a businessman in Poland meant actually that you had your\nclients invite at least once or twice a year. Once at least for a big hunt. Uh, that's why my\nfather really kept the hunting ground to have a party opportunity to reward his customers.\nMy father also became honorary consul of the German Weimar Republic, so as a\nbusinessman...And he served in this function, I think, until '29 or so. And, of course, he knew\nabout the Nazi and didn't like anything of their stuff whatsoever. Because of the foreign\noffice in Berlin things were discussed and the officers of the foreign service, they already\nindicated that Hitler will take over very soon. So the message of doom, at least for my father,\nwas quite clear. It didn't...1t took one incident. My father was riding by train from Berlin to\nBydgoszcz. And he, of course, used first class, and as a businessman. And another person\ncame into his compartment--a German who traveled to Germany, too--and after the train\nstarted to move, this man opened his briefcase and took the Nazi Central Newspaper out,\n[the] Volkischer Beobachter. My father, seeing this...he didn't like the type of person\nanyhow. He looked like a reserve officer, had the bearing of a military man. He saw this, my\nfather really angry. He took his briefcase from out of the rack and told this guy, \"I don't want\nto share my compartment with a man who reads the Nazi paper.\" That's what the kind of\nperson my father was. Because he addressed the right person. This person was actually his\nreplacement. You know, he was on a visit to Bydgoszcz to talk to my father how he would\ntake this over, you know. And later on, a day or two later, he met him. This guy came\nvisiting and said, \"I am Consul [Bernhard (ph). '\" And he...Of course, it was an icy meeting;\nand my father was relieved of his position in a week's time. This guy had gone back to\nGermany and wrote up the incident in the compartment; and that really fixed my father's\nfuture for good. My father, of course, didn't need that job at all. It was really uh more bother\nthan reward. He ran his business. But then the recession came and Poland was very hard hit.\nMy father was German citizen living on a passport. So the Poles said, \"Mr. Kniiemann, why\ndon't you go back to Brandenburg?\" That is what Germany was called in Poland. And we\ngot an order that our visas would not be prolonged, and that we had to leave by the end of\n1932 to Germany. My father could have gone to Essen; but Berlin was the next city, really\nbig city. And he had probably better opportunities to get a job. But he was in error. He came\nand he was told, 'No job for you. \" Because of his remark. And Hitler was not even in\npower then. But they already had...you know, the Nazis had already moved into strategic\npositions and already influenced the selection of people who could be hired or not. So my\nfather never got a job offer. He just unemployed from 1933 to 1945.",
        "Q: How did you survive financially?",
        "A: He was...he was actually a veteran. But being a German national, he had actually abdicated\nhis right for pension because \"I don't go and collect from my father[land]. \" That was the\nattitude. An idiot, of course. (Laughing) But he... finally, he was terribly sick. He had TB,\nopen TB, and was about to die; so they admitted him to a veteran's hospital. And his pension\nwas restored, but on a level about 50% disability. But he was really 250% disabled, really.\nSo he spent uh half a year in the hospital; was operated several times, of course, to no avail.\nBut the acute conditions were removed. My mother and my sister and I, we lived in\napartment which cost as about 80% of our income. And when we came to Berlin, people\ndidn't believe it. They thought we were criminals. Kicked out from Poland for not paying\ntaxes, or stealing something, and so forth. I mean, the Germans to me were completely\ninsensitive--even to the needs of their own people in a way, you know.",
        "Q: Why did they think that you were criminals?",
        "A: They thought I had a Polish accent. That is enough. You know, (laughing) people have\nfunny notions. If you are Hungarian, you are necessarily a Gypsy or violin player.\nHungarians can play violins very well. Most, I guess, don't play violins. But being of Polish,\nbeing...having this title \"Polak\"...And I, as a child going into Berlin school, was treated as a\nPolak. My German was really quite good, but not perfect. I had a Polish accent and also uh\ndidn't have the wealth of words to describe things in German. So when this happened, I sit\ndown and really learned German. And actually better than most Germans. I really speak\neven today better German than most Germans. Definitely!",
        "Q: Tell me about your school. You brought some photographs with you. Tell me about the birth\ncertificate you have.",
        "A: Yah. Here is my Polish birth certificate. This is a major obstacle in my whole life. When\npeople ask me, \"What are you?\" I say \"Polish. \" They say, 'No, your German gives you\naway. You are German.\" And, of course, here in America I am now American citizen.\nOften people say, \"But you have an accent.\" Then I say, \"Yes, I was born Polish. \" And\nthey say, \"No, you have a German accent.\" I say, \"Unfortunately, I suffered from being\nborn in Poland. Because I had to immigrate here. The quota was full, and no entry for me in\nthis country. For long years, you know, I... So you get hit, no matter what you are. If you are\ndifferent, you get it. And I learned that in Poland, even when I was born, the kids came and\nmet this...It was not meant in a bad way, (cough) it was just the type of reaction they had\nwhen they saw something who was different from them. And it's everywhere.",
        "Q: You have other things as well. What is that you have now?",
        "A: This is actually my German maturation diploma, which entitles me to go to university.",
        "Q: You want water?",
        "A: Yah. So this took also some doing, you know. I had avoided joining Nazi Youth\nOrganization and so forth. I had a terrible time to fake myself through to be admitted here\nand so forth. Of course, I had a very good Jewish doctor who gave me attestations I was the\nsickest kid on the block. So they got easy on me, you know. And uh besides, legal speaking,\nmy age was a little bit too advanced to force me in it. The law actually uh spared those born\nbefore 1924. So I was born '22, and didn't encounter much trouble. But the authorities, when\nI applied going to...to--let's say, college--would call, they said, \"You are not member of any\nNazional Socialistice (ph) organization, you know. Only we...are only interested in people\nwho become leaders here.\" (Laughter) I said, \"I am not very much interested being a\nleader, anyway.\" (Laughter)",
        "Q: Show me what else. You have some photographs of you growing up. Now these would be in\nPoland as a young child?",
        "A: Yah. Here, that's the height of my career! (Laughter) I always tried to climb up that tree.\n(Laughing) And finally, my father helped me and took a picture. I was 2-1/2 years old. So\nthis was taken in 1924. This was my highest point in my career. I was really proud of it. You\ncan see the branches all debogged because I always tried again and again to climb up. You\nsee, I'm restless. | am a go-getter. (Laughing) Actually to maybe familiarize you, my father\nimmigrated, not immigrated, this area was German under the Kaiserreich and the were\ninterested in getting Germans in that because they wanted to, uh, discourage Poles to live\nthere. So people wanted to expand, get a new business. My uncle had done so. He was from\nEssen in West Germany. And my father went to Poland--or at that time it was Germany--to\nbeat...to learn the trade of sales representative in my uncle's firm. So, where they came from.\n. My father was the 24th child, by the way. The woman had two husbands. Of course, in\nsuccession, not at the same time. Although one could think...But there was no child after\nhim. That was the end of the line. (Laughing) But the house where my family comes from\nwas built in 1210, and is still standing--miraculously--in Eisenberg or Poleberg (ph). And I\nhave just met people from Eisenach, and they say, \"Oh, my uncle is a neighbor of the\nKntiemann family, and they lived next to this house. \" Was taken by my father, I think, in\n1923 or so. And these are my grandparents sitting in front. My grandfather was uh miner.\nThere were these many children. One could only operate the farm, so the others naturally\nwent into the...under...into the mines. My grandfather worked there 73 years. And on the day\nof his retirement, he collapsed and was dead. Real great thing to have a pension waiting for\nyou. (Laughing) And they kept it all, you know. And another distinction my family had, my\nfather was a veteran in the first World War. Lung shrapnel hit him. My grandfather--a\nveteran of 1971'--the same...the same uh (laughing) injury in the Prussian front. The French\nwere...My grandfather, the same injury. In the war with Prussia/Austria. \u201cSo same...almost\nthe identical. I am first one without an injury. I think I learned a lesson from the past, you\nknow. My father said, \"If you go into this war, and you get injured, you come home I beat\nyou up like you never have been.\" (Laughing) First thing was, of course, he didn't want his\nson to stand for this Hitler. He considered Hitler simple gangster. Nothing else, you know.\nHe took everything and gave nothing.",
        "Q: Tell me about...Tell me...You have one more picture there I want to show, about a school\nwoman. And I would like you to talk about your father. Yeah, that one. Tell me about that\nand the photographs.\n' NB: 1871. This would have been during the Franco-Prussian War.\n* 1866.",
        "A: This is...my schooling started in a gymnasium. I think this was a second year in the school. It\nwas a normal...",
        "Q: In Berlin?",
        "A: In Berlin. Was a normal school. Was still. . it was 1934 when I entered this. I was a little late.\nI was a year older, or two years older, than the rest of my...Because of my transfer from\nPoland, I had only Polish as a foreign language. And not French or Latin, or so. So I had to\ngo back. Also, my German was not that great. (Pause) They found. And uh so this teacher\nwas a Doctor |[Dunmeyer (ph). A very strange occurrence. He was a hunchback. And, of\ncourse, like anyone in Germany who was considered a weakling of normal--hunchback,\ncross-eyed, flat feet--that was an unwanted citizen. And this man, because of his...I think, of\nhis constants endurance of being looked at as a defective person was (sobbing) enormously\nkind. A person who... (sobbing)",
        "Q: Take a minute.",
        "A: .. you could only love. And then this broken system came in, and this man was almost\ndestroyed. You could feel it, that he was not Jewish or anything. But he knew me--as being\nwhat I am, I presented a target for these gangsters who came in. I was defective. Well, just\nbefore this picture was taken, maybe a day or two before, our room was decorated with\nromantic scenes of landscape and quieting pictures. In the middle of class, suddenly two\nworkmen come in with a great stack of pictures. And you can see these pictures here. They\nrepresent German warships, tanks, military pictures. (Laughter) We knew at that time\nromanticism was over. We were supposed to sit in a semi-military environment, and pay\nattention to the great designs of our Fiihrer. Nobody said anything, but (laughing) what else\nwas this, you know? You could look out of the window, and maybe there was no swastika\nflag; but you could look in your room, classroom. Students often sleep; and when you open\nyour eye it is quieting to see tree, a landscape, you know, pastoral scene. Now you open the\nwindow, what did you see? (Laughing) War in progress. What a change! (Laughing) You\ndidn't have to be very intelligent to notice. So here is another class picture. That was\nprobably three years later. Oh, it was April '38, we...I can be seen here. I was on the outside\nto begin with. I always (laughing) had my escape route secure automatically. But here my\nthree other friends--we were a clique of four. We didn't belong. We all four didn't belong to\nthe youth movement, and so forth. And uh there are some prominent people here, who\nactually this man was a most intelligent man I ever met. He had the first name \"Carl Heinz,\"\nlike I have, but he...you know, difficult task he finished in 10 minutes. We sit there three\nhours and couldn't solve it. His name Witzberger, of course, made him suspect to be a Jew.\nAnd he...like Germans, they know exactly who 1s a Jew and who is not, you know--like\nAmericans, they know what a Negro is and not. I mean, know people have their\npreoccupation in identifying people. Like this man--he [was a] young man--he was a genius,\nreally. And he became later, after the war, the President of the East Berlin University. And\nactually he headed the Department of Americanism...American studies, you know. Even the\ncommunist people I know, East German government people, the record of this man was\nunquestioned qualified as nobody else. There was not even an idea of their head to take a\ncommunist and plug him in. Witzberger was their man. I heard some speeches of his over a\nshortwave radio. Of course, he catered to the communist view; but as such, he was fantastic\nman. The other man here is my friend--who's now, so to speak, the Cary Grant of Austria.\nAnd he has a very peculiar situation. I was at a draft board with him during the Nazi time.\nWe all tried... at that time, we wanted to be drafted actually; because we could have uh\navoided taking the examination to get the diploma. We would have been given this for free.\nYou see, going through the rigorous study...I mean, even becoming a Nazi soldier was not\nsuch a bad thing, you know. It...I hadn't studied anything. I started (laughing) four weeks\nbefore. But I had two subjects, geography and biology, [1n which] I was tops all through my\nschool years. So I...English was a very hard subject. Latin...Because of my political interest,\nI did less and less for school but more and more for other things, so...",
        "Q: Tell me about your biology teacher. You.... .",
        "A: Yah, this was our class teacher actually. Classroom teacher, and here he is 1n full uniform.\nNow this looks pretty fierce, but he was really not. He was really a very kind and educated\nman. Even some people had ideas he was probably looking out for little boys, because he\nhad assistant which stayed with him in the back. And, of course, being out of view, you can\nalways say he does this or that. Germans have a wonderful sense of unfairness. When they\nsuspect, it's already fact. So this man was dedicated teacher, very good in his uh...I mean,\nvery rigid schedule of instruction. We had to repeat, had to draw keyper logs and so. For me,\nit was nothing. I was A-1 graded. I didn't actually particular... mean, I was not attached to\nthis man. He was fair and harsh, you know; but fairness 1s almost can he everything. I mean,\nmy favorite teacher was Dr. Hatcher, my mathematics teacher. And, of course, '36 or so he\ndisappeared. He was Jewish; and quietly uh one day didn't come. Fortunately, he had a\nchance to come here. I'm not...I am still not quite sure where Dr. Hatcher is. Not the famous\nDr. Hatcher. I mean, it could be. I mean, this man was a genius in his field. And as a\neducator, I have never seen something like that again.",
        "Q: Talk now about your family, particularly about your father.",
        "A: Yah. My father was, of course, very sick. And uh his friends were...we had a very close\nrelations with one family. It was a professor of pharmacology in Berlin, Professor Wolfgang\n[Heumer (ph)] and his wife. They were known anti-Nazi. My father knew very influential\npersons, in the military, in politics. For instance, later President Heuss, my father... The main\nplotter against Hitler way back in already 1933, was the really mayor of Leipzig, Dr.\nGoerdeler. \"He was the organizer of the rebellion against Hitler. And my father, being in\n* Carl Friedrich Goerdeler conspired with Johannes Popitz and Ludwig Beck to oppose Hitler.\npolitics, he was in the supervisory commission on the Versailles Treaty. The people of\nWestern Poland had the option to vote whether they want to be Polish or German. And there\nwas a German ___? , they stayed at our house. One man was Dr. Goerdeler--the main\nconspirator at the 20th of July; and Theodor Heuss, later President of the West German\nRepublic. * Actually, the German currency was so much devalued, this gentlemen had no\nmoney. They stayed at my family's house just living on what ever they got from ...People\nalso felt sorry for him, you know. He had been in World War I a pilot; and to some degree,\npeople attached some romantic ideas with this. It was the early pilot yet, got his pilot license\nin 1908. It was issued on a bicycle permit because (laughing) there was no form for pilot\nlicense. Actually, it came his...We had this later. My father had his old factory; and a\nneighbor of his was a hobby pilot and builder of aircraft out of broom sticks, by the way.\nAnd he urged my father get into the flying business. My father did. Got his license; and\nwhen the war started, he volunteered as a pilot in the army. I mean, there was no air force or\nanything like here, you know. And this is a very significant point, because he had to be\ntrained to be a soldier by his sergeant, you know. He had to learn how to walk, how to turn\nright, how to turn left, how to obey commanders, and so on. So this was a man with a heroic\nname. His name was \"Coward,\" actually Feige which means coward in English [NB:\nGerman], you know. But Feige is a very bad name for a military man. But this guy was\nstrict. He had a hair cut like me--no hair--and very determined, you know. So this...uh...My\nfather--like I, like my mother...I don't know, we are naturals at making contact. I mean, I\ncan...I walk here over the street and in one block I make 5 new acquaintances, usually nice\nones. (Laughing) I don't know what it takes. I personally feel I am entitled, and I should talk\nto everyone who doesn't want or wants to talk to me. I talk to everyone--from President\nBush, Carter, and so on down to uh Mrs. Thatcher. Uh (laughing) and, you know, I always\nhave something to say; something new, you know, because I know everything. So I knew\neverything in Germany, because my father was collecting what is going on in politics and so\non. So soon groups formed a civilian, actually. They were businessmen and suddenly they\ndidn't like Hitler. Because there was no business with Hitler, you know. It was only Hitler\nbusiness; and all the others had to do exactly like the Fuhrer wanted it. This brought money\ninto the scene. And, of course, any plot needs a lot of money. And my father was\ninstrumental to...Since he was unemployed, he was not wanted to be working. So he had a\nwonderful job doing the plotting against Hitler.",
        "Q: Talk...elaborate on that. How did he get involved? How did he work with Dr. Goerdeler,\nwho is a very important figure? Talk about this.",
        "A: You know, of course, one thing, once we came to Berlin we knew exactly there 1s a big\nproblem coming up with Jewish populations. We...I mean, Professor [Heumner (ph)] was a\nfriend of Einstein. I even had to shake Einstein the hand, I didn't know it was that jerk was. I\nmean, as a little boy I thought avoid people as much as you can. I was so shy, you know. No,\n* Elected September 12, 1949.\nthey say, \"Boobie\"--that was my nickname, Boobie--you know, and my mother calls me that\nto...to my greatest displeasure. And (laughing) I go in, shake hands with the professor. There\nwere four professors, Hoimner, Einstein, I think Dr. Lindler or so, uh, biochemist. And, I\nmean, they were all in the medical special fields. (Laughter) I went stumbling. I knew there\nwas somebody famous, you know. With the others, I got easier off; but I got a red head, just\ndisappeared to the woodwork, not to be ever seen that day, you know. I had enough. Besides,\nthere was no piece of chocolate or anything, as was usual. Of course, Professors, they always\ntake...they sit there. Even I think (laughing) Einstein didn't carry chocolate in his pockets. I\ndidn't get anything. But I don't remember anything really. So (laughing) he doesn't remember\neither. He never remember nothing. But I wasn't cross. This type of people suddenly became\nendangered species. And [Heumner (ph)|'s assistant for influence, Dr. Levy, and [Heumner\n(ph)]| had gotten...[Heumner (ph)] was known as being an anti-Nazi and here Minnesota\nUniversity, they had invited him to come here and teach, and he had considered it, but he\ntalked to his assistant, Dr. Levy, and said, \"Look, you go. \" [Heumner (ph)] suspected\ncorrectly that this would end in this Holocaust, no doubt about it. You know, he was privy to\ngovernment deliberations, you know, being sort of a FDA director. Because of this\npharmaceutical institute in Berlin was acting as a screening agent for the government, to\napprove medication and so on. He knew when, you know, was great resentment maybe\nfinally agree to immigrate to United States which saved his life, you know. It didn't\nmake...[Heumner (ph)]| survived all this. He was one of the first German scientist, he\nattended the International Pharmaceuticological Congress in Paris in 1935. He was\ninstructed to greet the audience with \"Heil Hitler,\" which he didn't do. (Laughter) But\nfurthermore, he even said, \"Colleagues, I have to tell you something. I come from Berlin.\nFrom the research which I have reviewed 1n the last two years, I have to conclude that these\ntests are actually performed on living human beings. \" He thought he would turn the world\nover. Like it is in conventions, nobody listens to these damn, lousy, boring papers. So this\nannouncement was just completely disregarded. Nobody paid any attention. The Nazis did,\nof course. But seeing that it was not heard, just disregarded. They were smart. They didn't do\nanything to [Heumner (ph)]. First, he was very famous. And punishing him, which would\nhave been automatic for anyone else--they didn't do anything. Not only this, they bestowed\non him an honorary golden party membership--which [Heumner (ph)]| refused, but he had to\ntake it. I mean, they just put it on his table and said, \"Take it or leave it. You are a party\nmember. Golden party. '\" He was upset. But they did something else. They appointed an\nadministrator for his institute, who was a super Nazi, Dr. Drukrei (ph). His claim to fame\nwas that he invented a covering wax for freckles. And this man is still alive. And this man\nactually beset [Heumner (ph)] like a vulture, just hacking into making his life almost\nunbearable. This man came through the war and this professor still and so forth. (laugh)\nUnbelievable, you know. He still is advertising his covering wax, Dr. Drukrei's wax,\nguaranteed to cover and so, this happened. Of course, Dr. Drukrei was taken like a fool by\nthe scientific community. They knew what he was doing, what his job was. I mean\n[Heumner (ph)] also had an assistant who turned out to be the...He was also a very unusual\nman. He was a communist party member actually. [Heumner (ph)] probably didn't know it\nand probably wouldn't have cared one way or the other. Later this man became the leader of\nthe liberal movement in East German, Dr. Havemann. Very famous case. He actually\nthrough a very funny incident became an anti-American. He, Havemann, in his time at\nHaarmness Institute, had befriended prisoners of war, Russians, and had facilitated their\nescape from Germany. He was discovered. Besides, he actually was really discovered\nbecause he listen to BBC. And when he come to the Institute, he disseminated the Western\nnews and probably Drukrei or his henchmen, they reported on Havemann. He was arrested,\ncondemned to death, and actually there was nothing anyone could do for him. But, the Nazi\nauthorities recognized the importance of his work, they installed a laboratory in the prison\nwhere he was held and he had to work on his projects. They were that important. And he\nsurvived the war, was liberated by the Russians, got into Berlin, was appointed President of\nthe Cosavillan (ph) Academy. It's like the academy of sciences here. It was located in the\nAmerican sector. Now, something terrible happened. These academy members had the\nprivilege to use the armor cars in the American officers club. The general commanding the\nAmerican sector, General Holley--a Texan, something like 29 years old, heavy drinker-- he\nmeets this German Haubermann, goes to him, and said, \"You, Nazi! What are you doing\nhere?\" I mean, threw him out, you know. He was drunk. Haubermann had the explicit right\nto be guest there... guest of honor, you know. He took it really very hard. He went up to him\nand said, \"You will never see me again. I am an enemy of the United States from now on. \"\nAnd he sure...he never came to the West or anything; but he made his stand later on as a\nreally democrat. He was arrested by the East Germans, was in imprisoned, and his family\nwas destroyed. And you know, you run into this, and there you...I mean, I was still quite\nyoung. I understood it perfectly.",
        "Q: Let's bring it back to the war years, to your father. Your father had left, how did he...",
        "A: Had nothing to do, and then people came to him and there were not that many people had\nfree time. At least, you know, my father became a courier between Budapest and this was a\nlink to the Allies.",
        "Q: What did he do?",
        "A: Actually, he was a letter carrier. Yah. Actually, my sister had married to Hungary, so it was\nnatural to go on, on, on, on visits to my sister and, uh, the main thing was that messages got\nacross. And they got across, but uh Mr. Dulles, I think was not very, I think, not very\nskillful. They didn't believe that there was a possibility to get a non-Nazi group activated and\nprobably rebel and be successful. So the American authorities never took up on this. But,\nyou know, that's how life is you know. You cannot expect your enemy to give you full\ncredit, you know. And, of course, Hitler sounded fiercely enough, was fiercely, and even had\na chance in an American view and through some trickery he still could, with the help of\nRussian, of course, win, you know.",
        "Q: Now the years where you father was acting as a courier. Where?",
        "A: To Hungary.",
        "Q: No--the years, the date. What years are we talking about?",
        "A: From, actually, at least from '39 on. And actually, he knew generals. He didn't like military\nmen in particular; because most military men, at least in Europe, are stupid--politically\nstupid. They cannot make up their mind to rebel. Germans never rebel. They never rebelled\nin the whole history. And if they rebelled, it was unsuccessful. Because the ruling class 1s not\nstrong enough in determination. They are not strong enough to sustain themselves in times of\ndisorder because the ruling class never had the full support of the people. You see the\nGerman people are a non-entity of German politics. Even nowadays, the so-called\ndemocratic parliamentary, they say, \"If we don't do it, don't wait for the people. They don't\ndo it.\" The tradition is just not there. A single person or single group without support goes\nout and tries to take over and run the show. I, having been born in Poland (laugh), don't have\nthis tradition, you know. I suddenly realized that I am different.",
        "Q: Talk about being different. You father was acting as a courier. What were you doing? You\nobviously were doing something.",
        "A: (Laughing) I was doing what was right, namely...(laugh). I was 12 years old.",
        "Q: In what year?",
        "A: It was 12...'34. And censorship had been instituted all over Germany. All letters were\ncensored by the postal authorities. I mean, uh, samples were drawn and read. So any enemy\nof, or anyone who wanted to immigrate or file for immigration could not use the mail. Many\nJewish people had to contact people abroad just to make arrangements or beg for support for\na $50 ticket, you know. It was all it cost, by the way, to come from Germany to the United\nStates. If we went for the lowest classes, $50 did it. But it was very difficult to have. It just\nhappened I, we lived next to a railroad station, and I'm uncurable nosey. I want to know\nimmediately. I mean as a little boy (laugh), I wanted to know everything. Even now I have\nnot found out many things, you know, but what was possible I finally got to it. I know the\nstar wars secrets in the United States. I know the atomic secret. Everything came to me. I\ndidn't have to. They offered it to me. They employed me there. I had no security clearance or\nnothing. They talked to me like they talked to God almighty, you know. They know that guy\nis okay, you know. Although they have the deepest suspicion at the same time they come to\nme. So I don't know what's wrong with me, but people come to me and give me their most\nsecret secrets, you know. And afterwards they would think, \"What did I do. Why him?\"\nBecause I am perfectly the safest the holder of secrets. If you are my enemy, I use it against\nyou.",
        "Q: In 1934, how did you use it against them? What did you do?",
        "A: Two Czech railroads...I mean, stewards of...sleeping car stewards. Their train was, or their\nwagon was laid over, and they had...Berlin was full with provincial Nazis and conventions. I\nmean, suddenly Berlin was not a convention town or so. Maybe business going over; but\npolitical, very little. The Nazis got very active and hotel rooms were not available. So these\ntwo porters came to me. They kid, \"Do you know somebody who (laughing) would rent us a\nroom for the night? We are laid over. We cannot find shelter. \" Of course, I knew it was\nFrau Mayer, next to us. She was married to a very presentable, respectable banker. But Herr\nMayer had (laugh) syphilis. He played around with a girl when he. It was tn his last. . when\nterm had died. I knew, besides Frau Mayer, because he was retired, she was a\nRomanian, violin player in the ladies' orchestra in a rather shady... This was just a perfect\nmatch for these two loose Czechs. I introduced the party. It was a total match. These Czechs\nwere anti-Nazi. Frau Mayer, of course was anti-Nazi. Her husband being a syphilitic,\ninfluential banker was just like inviting, you know, a crocodile for a state dinner you know.\nMayer was out, you know. So they started rooming there. I mean I couldn't have done a\nbetter match. And then we started, I was already 12, a blooming black market business you\nknow. Butter was short in Berlin and that and, you know, Jewish people ...I mean you had to\nregister later, and you could only get a quarter of a pound of butter and Jews could live\nwithout butter, they got no butter. So I knew there was a market for butter or you know,\nwhatever. I traded...I had a business maybe of a thousand marks a week. And going to school\nand doing all this, it was wonderful (laugh) you know, being so important. And then, of\ncourse, the other thing was just, uh, bringing letters out of Germany uncensored. And these\ntwo porters were replaced by about 40, 50. And they told the other colleagues to room there\nand what money they could...They got about, you know, they had to get some money for\ncarriers (laugh) because this was a capital of heads you know, because if you were caught\nsmuggling a letter out without circumventing the Nazi's censor, it was death. Simple death,\nyou know. Only thing you were remembered by was the announcement of the public on the\nwall. You have been shot yesterday morning. That was the last thing you were remembered\nby. So these people took a considerable risk, loss of jobs and so. But you know, I don't know\nwhat it was. Maybe 90 marks or maybe 400 marks. It depended where this letter had to go\nalso, you know. What difficulty, what calculated risks they had to take, you know. Never\nwas anything ever discovered, you know. Of course, I mean if you are international railroad\nporter, I mean, you know, everything. You know where to hide things where the authorities\nlook for, and you had everything tn line. It went like a charm. So I became very important. I\nmean this was almost a magic thing. I became known. And... mean people would never\nhave talked to a 12 year old, 13 or 14 year old, they came and said, \"Do something. We need\nthis to go through. \" I didn't even look what was in it, you know. I kept the postal secrecy,\nbut the government didn't. I knew it was death anyhow, you know, if it was discovered. It\ndidn't mean whether they paid or didn't pay. It was necessary. So.",
        "Q: Let's hold it there and let them change the tape.",
        "A: Okay.\nTAPE #2",
        "Q: Okay, now we are going to begin all over again. Now the tape's rolling. Pick it up. You said\nsomething during the break about you and your friends being very important as couriers in\nthis. Talk about it.",
        "A: And actually then uh black market providing food. There were many Jewish people living\naround, all...even former concentration camp persons who were released. They were arrested\nbecause they were union leaders. They were communists. They were socialists. You know,\nthe Nazis took everything and anyone who was a potential opponent. Political opponent; not\nphysical, but of a different opinion. That was enough. So these people were also curtailed in\nreceiving food and so on, you know. It was not rationed yet, but there were quotas set what\nyou could buy. And Jews were out; or they were so low...I mean, a rabbit could live on it, but\nnot a human being. We knew enough people, so we made profit. We bought food and gave it\naway, because these people had no access to their own funds, and so on. There was always,\nwe had always two, three people being overnight with us. People on the move, you know.\nWe didn't ask who it was or so. Very famous persons--you know, the son of...the grandson of\nMax Planck. And, I mean, whatever came.",
        "Q: And you knew they were Jews.",
        "A: Yah. You know, being in Poland, my father had very many business associates. Also, we\ncame to Berlin even before Hitler. We were darn poor, you know. And it was of course, we\nhad no bed. We didn't have this. We didn't have carpet. And we didn't have...We needed\neverything. You could have gone to whatever shop you wanted. (Laughing) No credit. No,\nno, no. So there was a Jewish department store--Fada(ph)--and it was a credit shop. And\nthese people were enormously nice. They took less (laughing) less, you know, interest. And\nthey were human beings. You know, after all, an economy has to serve people. But these\nNazis or these regular, they were so charged up: \"A straight German pays cash!\" It was\nalmost a demand of the political system. But it didn't quite work. Once the Jews were gone,\nthere was no credit; and Germans were hurting. They couldn't buy what they needed. We\ncould buy. And, course, being in Poland, in that section where we lived there was not a very\ngreat community of Jews. But Poland being a Catholic country and so on, not too\nsympathetic. But they didn't kill them, you know. There's a difference.",
        "Q: Come back to Germany.",
        "A: And in Germany. So we got into that, supporting Jewish people. And, of course, the\n[Heumner (ph)]| family, this medical and pharmacologist, they had an unending chain of\nfriends who needed help, help, help, help, day and night. This could have meant going to an\noffice instead of them, you know. They... So the officials were not as rejective as they\notherwise would have been. Spare them a little bit of trouble, you know. Go and see what,\nyou know, where they could stay. Some people were illegally living in Berlin, you know.\nWas a great harbor for, like all big cities, they can harbor a lot of stuff which the authorities\nwill never know, you know. Berlin had a big communist and socialist workers section and\nthe Nazis were not too prominent 1n there. They avoided it. Goebbels or so, they never came\nopenly to that section. But, uh...And ___ this today (laugh), I knew it, I knew, you just\nlooked at people and I knew already what they needed. And then you developed this sixth\nsense, you, you are with them and the only thing is Do something. Don't talk. Don't talk and\nthen, don't go into ideology. Whenever a threat exists, there is only one thing. Immediate\nhelp. And you give it all you have. Otherwise, forget it. Takes too long. Discovery 1s too\nclose and it is not effective. You know, when people hurt most that is when they need help,\nnot in 4 weeks. Not in 2 weeks.",
        "Q: Besides food and helping with getting papers, what else did you do?",
        "A: Oh, (laughing) everything else.",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: It's almost...My whole life was a different life and it was just.... I mean, for instance,\ninforming myself, being up to the minute. BBC was a big help. The French shortwave radio,\nDutch, there were German transmissions. I didn't speak English too well and so, I longed to\ntell what is going on...what the truth is. (Laugh) I spread the truth like, I mean as openly as\na dog barks and nobody, I mean, hardly ever people dared to interfere with this. They could\nhave just said, \"This man referred to a British broadcast.\" Death! (Laugh) I knew that there\nwere...I never considered it. And my friends too. One, uh, one friend was the...he was\nAustrian, so he was sort of exempt. He was sort of permitted to be a fool. He was the\nstrongest boy in my class, very good looking and so on, and his father had kool-aid factory I\nthink, was artificial kind of... Jews...but it was effervescent, you know. It was a very popular\ndrink with children and so. There was one pfennig, two pfennig--you know, half a cents, one\ncent. And they were really millionaires, if not billionaires. They drove an American car, and\nhis mother was very nice looking. Even I recognized the little boy. She was just...I mean, just\na fantastic woman. His father was nonchalant. His father being Austrian, and I think his\nattitude (laugh) toward Jews was not that sympathetic; but his son was, and his mother. And\nthere, his uncle was a super Nazi in Austria. Really, actually during a family visit, he stood\nup and said, \"I report you right now. \" You said this and this was. \" But his lovely mother\n(laughing) ...[ mean, my friend's mother, you know. (Laughing) She (laughing) physically\ntook him and said, \"If you do this, I murder you. \" I really thought I am cooked, because this\nman was a local leader of a Nazi party, Austria--even before Hitler took over. And after he\ntook over, he was even worse.",
        "Q: He was going to report you, specifically?",
        "A: Yah.",
        "Q: And he never did?",
        "A: He... I tell you if this woman wouldn't interfered, \"This close friend. You want to. . What are\nyou doing?\" She finally got him over I think. He knew what was coming if he would have\ndone it, I tell you he would have had terror you know.",
        "Q: Move the years forward a little bit. You have been doing all these courier things. What\nhappened next?",
        "A: Uh, still things got tighter and tighter. Actually then, you know, the Nazis got more\nobviously into pursuing the eradication of Jews. Funny thing is, only in two instances, I saw\nx, not right not necessarily violence per se. But I came up from school, and I never saw this\nuh uh SS man was pushing a lady, a woman. She was shabbily dressed. Maybe she was a\npoor person to begin with. She had a big ball of clothing. She rode in front of us. Completely\nin the middle of downtown Berlin. What was even more startling for me, this woman looked\nlike my mother. I didn't have to be told, you know, what the Nazi's did. I knew this. And\nwhat should I do? Can't do anything! Nobody! People looked really away from this, and they\nwere completely turned off, you know. There was not, \"Give her more. \" That was not them.\nAnd one other time, I was...there you feel, of course, enormous guilt. (Crying) Now I\nwouldn't do this. I would go. I mean here, what happens to me almost every month one time.\nI see commit a crime scene. You know what I do. That's what I should have done then. But I\nwas still too young, you know. But today, I go right in and I know how to do this, you know.\nI go to the attacker so close he cannot even swing on me, at you. And one thing I have a\nsecret weapon. My voice! I can shout like three steam locomotives. I mean, I have seen it\nactually--people going down to their knees. I must say, Americans are really from their\nyouths are cuddled with sweet words, and so they are not used to this kind of voice. I mean,\nit's so offense and so unbearable people stop their ears. By the way, I.",
        "Q: Let's go back.",
        "A: Yah. The other time it was the...a group of prisoners, KZ [NB: Konzentrationslager]\nprisoners. They were transferred for one reason or another. I don't know. But they were\nrunning over the station on the...out of the train into the station. They were running and\nrunning. Funny, they always shouted, \"We are political prisoners!\" And that kind of thing.\nThis was a direct thing. And, of course, the Kristallnacht...That, I lived in Berlin, you know.",
        "Q: Describe Kristallnacht.",
        "A: Yah. It was...I mean, the Nazi raid, you had actually tried to incense people, you know. The\nmurder of vom Rath in Paris, you know, supposedly done by Grynszpan, you know. And it\nwas used as a anti-Jewish; but actually, there was no anti-Jewish feeling in Berlin at this\ntime. You know, Berlin had a pretty large Jewish community, and Jews were really liked.\nThey were part of Berlin. What Berlin was, is like my right arm doesn't belong to me\nbecause the arm is Jewish, you know. So I cut it off. (Sobbing) What nonsense! And people\ndidn't buy this. But the first indication...My sister had come back from school, and she came\nup in our apartment screaming and crying; and saying, \"What do they do to our...\" They had\na porcelain shop, they had little toys. And so we, as little children, went there. We had a nice\nrelationship. And there they were banging up. My sister couldn't go out, [or] anything. Of\ncourse, I ate my dinner and I sneaked out to look. I mean, I had to see this. And sure, it was\nworse than I thought. You know, the owners stood in the back of the shop. There were SA\nmen, mean, behaving like crazy, throwing the stuff in the street. It (cough) was a two-story\nhigh shop, and throwing things down. I mean, there was already need for all materials.\nPeople couldn't get what they wanted. They have to go there and destroy it, just because they\nwant to hurt Jews. They hurt themselves. But I went home. I listened to BBC. I got (cough)\nwhatever background there was to get. I would say, in general, Germans--because of\nreligious prejudice and so--by and in large are not necessary pro-Jewish. It would be nice if I\ncould say differently. I think it's...all of it is fake. Germany and now. Germany in the past.\nAnd for...and unfortunately, Germany, the so-called intellectual progressive of country 1s not\nbehaving at all fair. You see, it's an ingrown uh feeling. They are not German citizens. And\nany non-German is suspect anyhow. Like I had it. I was at least partially German. So I\nexperienced the same way. Maybe that's why I am so sensitive about this. For me, there was\nno reason to be believe. Jews were just another...a Jew was just another person who had\nGerman nationality and lived there for hundreds of years. But he was a Jew, not racially a\nGerman. We start with that, we can actually split up in nations of one person, you know.\nEverybody...",
        "Q: What happened as the war progressed? I know you got deeper into anti-Nazi activities. Talk\nabout that.",
        "A: It started already, of course. You became involved in all this. Anything I could do to damage\nmy government, which I did not really consider as legal as my government. Anything I could\ndo. And if it was I called known Nazis day and not until they got crazy.",
        "Q: How do you mean, \"called them\"?",
        "A: I mean, phoned. Just crank calls. You see, I am a bad boy. I mean, really bad. They really\nbecame almost insane, you know. We divided our rolls. We didn't let them sleep a minute.\n(Cough) I mean, these were really big guys, you know. Show-offs, and so on.",
        "Q: What else did you do?",
        "A: And then, you know, it became...the war time came. I knew I didn't want to go. I mean, I had\none legal reason. I was too old. I hadn't finished school. Then...but I was at the draft board,\nthe draft record was established. And I had contacted an infection in my ear from the\nswimming pool. At that time, this was a hopeless case. My hearing deteriorated, and so on.\nAnd I had flat feet. And my father had to work the roses; and they looked at me with very\ncareful eye, and so on. And then I advised other students, my school uh uh mates, to take it\neasy. And I tell you, \"You can get killed out there. You are not killing others--which is not a\npleasant task either--but you can be the victim. And if you want to be alive, don't go there\nwhere they shoot.\" Many people had a different idea after discussions like that. Oh, I have\nto mention one of my school students. One school was shut down, and the students were\ndivided in other schools in Berlin. And there comes a Mr. [Heyder (ph)]. I think that was the\nfirst hippie I ever encountered, you know. This man was a little older. He had...he failed one\nof the other class. And he was as anti-Nazi as openly as you could wish, and he had all the\nlooks of (laughing) a non-Nazi and obstinate student. 'Cause things like that cannot survive\nvery long. But he was really clear. He was an artist, a very good one, more than artist. His\ncollection of records was \"Three Penny Opera,\" \"In the Mood,\" and so on and so on. His\nfather had died. His mother ran the business as a business consultant. Very successful. He\nwas pretty much on his own, you know. He lived at the Kurftirstendamm--it was prominent,\nlike living on Broadway in the better section. And he had gotten together, first had called\nmany, many Jewish youngsters were around him. He was tolerant actually to all things. And,\nof course, when he came to school he slept a lot, (laughing) and he had the wrong hair cut\nyou know. One day, it really happened. Our classroom teacher had changed with our\nmathematics teacher. His son had been a victim... was killed in the war. This man had no\nforgiving at all for anything but straight Nazi and Vaterland. He said, \"[Heyder (ph)], stand\nup. I have to talk to you. \" In front of the whole class. \"Were you yesterday\u2019? Did I see a\nman...? Was that you with a completely silly looking jacket on?\" He had a cloth jacket, you\nknow. \"Was that you?\" \"Yes, Dr. [Fran (ph)].\"_ \"Was that you who smoked a cigarette\nwearing this cloth jacket?\" And then the worst thing came. \"Was that you who had actually\na female person on his arm? Was that you?\" He said, \"Yes, that's my future wife. \"\n(Laughing) I tell you, this wife, she became his wife. She was maybe 5 years older. He was\nof German consumption 16-l/2 or 17. That's a no-no, you know. So he was reprimanded in\nthe worst form. And, of course, [Heyder (ph)| became the hero of that class automatically.\nEven the Nazi boys, they admired him for it. And he then finally married this...And he\nbecame... There was no apartment to be had. The mother didn't like this marriage at all, so he\nmoved into my section of town. We lived, because we couldn't pay, in the worst section--\nprostitution, crime, everything. And apartments were about half of what they were in West\nBerlin. They couldn't find anything. So he rented a store--which was never heard of, I don't\nthink even here. And he made it sort of a artist studio, and really free for all. Everyone could\ncome in. And he had connections to the black markets and the stores. Very easy to serve.\nThey stopped, carry in, out; you know, you don't have to go four flights up or down. And his\nwife, being a very volumptuous woman...I mean, even the anti-Nazis knew there was\nsomething to look at, at least, you know. And they were just host to everybody, you know.\nAnd they established really a meeting point for people who were anti-Nazis. They had all\nthese American records, British records. Bertold Brecht was played. Anything which was\nforbidden by the Nazis, that's where you could hear it. And over the time, even SS officers\ncame. The strangest thing, they were so fed up by this, you know, even SS officers get tired.\nAnd they came, and they cooperated. We got even ideas from them, you know. They were\ncompletely disillusioned, of course, because they were really prisoners of the system. And to\nhave a day or two leave and full freedom. It was just...they could be human beings, suddenly.\nAnd, of course, then getting false passports for people needed to get out and so forth.\nEverything. And uh was a different world. I mean, it existed. Of course, the workers section,\nthey tolerated this. They would never have told the authorities, \"This bothers me, or this\nbothers me. \" They were maybe loud; but that was a noisy laughter here. (Laughing) It was\nanti-Nazi, you know. They would have loved to be part of it. And I tell you what it was in\nGermany. This murky little petit bourgeoisie-type, you know--which automatically hated\nJews because they were liberal--they were open, they had new values. The whole German\nculture is almost Jewish culture. I mean, in culture production--songs, and so on. I mean,\nthere is really, for me, I was neutral Germany. Whatever was, I took as being German. Not\nJewish, or not that: it was German. And it is completely hidden in German history books.\nEven a hundred years ago, what the participation of Jews this was. Since there was no\nknowledge about what this really was, to load the population into a anti-Jewish mode and\nmake them the strangers. (Laughing) Unfortunately, they were better Germans than most\nGermans. You know, we had friends they just couldn't believe that they were not guests in\nthis country. They were it, you know. And now what they wear turned against them. For\nreasons of a idiot coming from Austria.",
        "Q: Talk about...During the war, I know you were drafted--or partly drafted--and then got\ninvolved in Danish resistance. Talk about that.",
        "A: I mean, whatever resistance there was in Germany, I knew at least...I knew or could have\nknown, or frankly, I first evaded the draft. I got diphtheria. And to restore my health, I went\nto Hungary. My brother-in-law is medic over there; and he extended the...But then the Nazis\ntook over in Hungary. I knew I had to get out. So I went back to Berlin. And the minute I\ncame to Berlin I got the draft notice. And I couldn't really avoid it. But I got sick. First I got\nsick. I could not follow. And then they told me I had to report for medical examination again.\nThey took an X-ray, and somebody there felt sorry for me. We had talked politics and he put\na TB record in my record. And suddenly, the military doctor: \"Mr. Kniieman, take a seat.\nDo you sweat a lot?\" I said, \"No.\" I actually want to get out of Berlin; because it was\nalmost impossible to walk the street as a young man, you know. And then it finally\nhappened. I got a call, and nothing could help me.",
        "Q: What do you mean?",
        "A: I mean, to get out of it. But I also was ready to go. I had met, a half a year or so before, a\nDane in a restaurant. I did know he was a Dane. He looked like anyone else. But we...I ate\nand he ate in a specific Nazi restaurant where you could get everything. I had enough money\nfrom and noticed the accent. \"Are you from Denmark or so?\" He said he was kidnapped by\nthe SS. He had actually written on an ad in the Copenhagen newspapers, and this was a fake.\nThey wanted to get young Danes out of Denmark and capture them. He was given a ticket to\nParis. He went to export/import business to interview. They said that \"You are hired, but you\nhave to talk to...Final interview is with the president of the company.\" He is led into the\nback room, and Jew sits there and SS General and goes over and says \"Mr. Oberg, may I\ncongratulate you for your volunteer application to the Viking Division of the SS.\nUnfortunately, we have to tell you you cannot go home. You will be sent to Berlin for\neconomics training. \" What they had in mind to capture enough indigenous population, train\nthem in business, for instance, make them sort of believer of the Nazis. And they promise\nthem at the end of the victorious war, of course, they will be put in place and manage these\nindustries for the SS. The SS had planned to actually establish its own economic base to\ndraw money out of these foreign factories and finance their adventures from foreign funds. I\nmet this man, and then I could see that was my case. Kay Oberg was his name. And he, uh...I\ninvited him home. And his father had a delicatessen shop in Copenhagen. And he said, \"Yah,\nI am. I can't go now. They watch me.\" And so forth. We got him a false passport.\n(Laughing) That was nothing. We always had it. We need it. We had it. And he came home\nto Denmark now. Escaped. And he had told me already about the resistance move, and that\nhis family is in it, too. And I never thought I would need it, you know. But I was drafted; and\nof all places they send me was to Denmark. Since I am deaf, I was sent for wireless training.\nAnd they went through the rolls, and they said, \"What is your occupation - a student?\" That\nwas a \"Yes.\" Because to be a morse operator...And I was deaf. They didn't ask me that.\n(Laughing) And I thought I will not tell them (laughing) until I sit and fall, because I had in\nmind that I can go to the other sides. I came there and I faked it. I even did the qualification\nfor morse code school and all that, you know. But I had contacted Oberg and said I am here.\nAnd I expected actually that they would give me an address where to turn to, but 1t was not\nnecessary. I came into this new company; and there was lots of Poles, ethnic Poles, and\nethnic Frenchmen. And the manager of the canteen in the company was a Frenchman from\nAlsace-Lorraine. You know how it was, you wouldn't believe it, how you recognized each\nother, that you were anti-Nazi. I went into the shop. I left, and he said the same dirty laugh;\nand I knew exactly that was the man. You know that, nothing like in Hollywood film, code\nwords, you know you forget code words by the way. That is a very great danger. You know,\nyou have other things to worry about and, uh, now the code word. You are shot before you\nremember. But here it was just that you recognize this man at least wanted to have a life style\nwhich was yours. That you knew that yours and his were non-Nazi so that was all it took.\nYou could talk to these people at once without identification and so I went, after hours, to the\ncanteen and look my desire is to do anything to damage the Nazi factory. Finally, I think I\nwould like to go to Sweden. No problem, you know. I told him that I had connections in\nBerlin for weapons. I mean I could buy machine guns, anything. Like here, it's forbidden.\nBut actually Nazis were not that crazy. They...I mean you could have weapons, you know.\nMy father had hunting weapons, I mean, very dangerous ones, you know. And, uh, since\nthere were warriors and robbers anyhow, the old government, they didn't take it so seriously.\nBesides, the Nazis really thought that they controlled everything. They had no...they didn't\neven have a suspicion that there was a segment of the population really going after them.\nThey didn't know this. I mean there was the West that they contributed...you see that they\nwere the victims of their own philosophy. They thought Jews were the typical resistance.\nThere was...actually for a Jew, it was very, very difficult to be a fighter because people,\nofficials...you looked Jews, Jewish. I don't know some Jews I know looked more, they\nlooked more like Siegrfied, you know. But they looked for that type you know. I mean\neverywhere. In all countries. If they were gypsies, a chicken is stoled, and a gypsy was there\na week ago, he did it. There was always a minority which can be easily recognized. Round\nup the usual suspect. Like in the Casablanca film, you know. If they didn't find any of them,\nit was, uh, Jews do it any how. But in this case here, these Frenchmen, the ethic French men,\nthey were not trusted. But they were sent for occupation duty in Denmark. The Poles were\nnot trusted. They were sent for occupation duty in Denmark. So, there was need for weapons\nand I had the military pass. My father (laugh) conveniently got sick. I went to Berlin and\nbought two big suitcases full of pistols. And I repeated it several times. I...you see at that\ntime, the Nazis collected weapons from civilians, mostly weapons man had brought back as\nsouveniers from war crimes. And these women were impressed if they would be caught by,\nfor instance, if Russians, if they ever would come, they would be of course raped 15 times,\nmangled, (laugh) and all that. And these Nazi officials stood there and took the weapons 1n,\nyou know, and I stood outside the collection point. I know even the place, it was Horst\nWessel Platz. It was actually former headquarter of the communist party in Berlin. It had\nbeen turned into the Nazi office building and downstairs, they had the collection agency.\nAnd I stood in front of this, in my uniform, of course. I said, \"I come right from the front.\nYou know what we need. We need more weapons. You know the German army is not\nproviding us with pistol, you know. When the enemy comes running up to you, you cannot\nuse your rifle. I give you five dollars.\" (laugh) In 30 minutes, I had 2 big suitcases. I\ncouldn't even carry it, but I was soldier, I was, of course, a front soldier in Denmark, eating\nwhip cream by the gallon and so I delivered. That French man, he just gobbled it up.\nActually, these Frenchmen had full uniforms already for the loss of the war and at once\nestablished a French army unit in Denmark, out of the German army. And, of course, he had\nthe connection with the Danish Army, and so...I went to Berlin 3 times, did this and always\nwith the Wehrmacht train, the military train. It was never controlled. You could actually take\nanything you wanted. And the Danes were happy. I was happy. I brought butter to Berlin and\nso forth you know. And so I was never afraid really. It was...1f you know, if you do it for the\nright cause, nothing stops you. And whenever it comes, the threat of this thing and you have\nyour right cause, do it. Don't talk. Do it. You know, it's. . nothing is better than doing it.\nTrying to abolish it. Even if this is go yet. You just throw the stone where it hurts. And you\nknow yourself you never can, uh, uh, let this guy fall down. But you might hit where it hurts,\nand you are finally getting through with your message. So not that much difficulty. You\nsee...I think human beings are too civilized. I think maybe, in part, Israel is a good example.\nThey do it, against all odds. It's the only country which does it, I mean in my opinion. But I\nthink anyone can do it if he just wants it. Ifhe sees the danger which is directly against him,\nwhat he is running into. Don't run into it. Abolish this danger. So...",
        "Q: What else did you do besides run guns?",
        "A: No, of course, I first provided the full secret Morse codes to the other side. And I ran it.\nActually we had our headquarters above the German headquarters in Aalborg. We used the\nGerman antenna. That way we couldn't be detected. We attached our wires on that and, you\nknow, that was it. They came, they circled around, found a signal but it was there own...their\nown antenna. So that one of them. Finally, uh, uh, on the last trip I came back and my\ncompany was dissolved. So I had no organization to turn to and that was, of course,\ndangerous, uh, you know. And, uh, there was a way out. I figured it out. There was a central\nreporting point for the soldiers who had lost their unit and that was, you know, the Nazi\nsystem contrary to belief here was completely disorganized, at least in my eyes. It had so\nmany weak points. You imagined there was no computer yet. The transfer of a name was so.\n. Just impossible in a speedy fashion. Today, it's a one button, and the computer spues out\nwhatever you want. It was a very big problem, but the other problem, they over organized.\nSo many things were illegal. I mean more than legal. Everything was illegal to keep track\nwhat violation had happened, what people, uh, were involved was almost impossible to\nmanage. I mean, to get somebody, it's difficult everywhere. Let's say you search for a\ncriminal, but you are not getting your hands on this man that speedily. Now you do, but then\nit was really very, very difficult. To be a Jew, that was a different...people had a model in\nfront of them. It was a dark hair...certain features people thought was Jewish. My brother-in-\nlaw is Hungarian. He looks like 14 Jews. I mean, it happened, during his stay in Berlin, he\nwas accosted by people not to wear the Jewish Star, you know.",
        "Q: Move up a little to June 1944. You said that your father was involved in a plot?",
        "A: My father had become so sick, he was not more involved. His T. B...actually we had\nrelatives in Poland. . and he had rented relatives...",
        "Q: Talk a little louder please.",
        "A: We had relatives...my uncle from my mother's side, they lived there. Actually, my uncle was\nPolish officer. And, uh, because of the air raids in Berlin, his being there was almost\nimpossible. And also the food shortage and so on. So he had rented from friends or relatives\na little house with a garden. He lived there. But, of course, he knew all what was going on,\nyou know, and actually we had two contacts. I mean it was Goerdeler and the initial plot\nnever came off. Actually, the plotters were doing this since really 34 and, uh, uh, they never\ncould get agreement from the generals because weapons are needed for a thing like this. And\nthey objected, they had given the oath of office on Hitler and so forth and besides, don't kid\nyourself, they never make a plot successful. (laugh) Through German history, these\nGermans are outspoken cowards. You know they are only form...not some...nothing in them.\nThey are actually removed from the people, you know. It's not a people's army in Germany.\nIt's the king's army or the Fihrer's army, and that was the biggest problem. And it seemed\nthat this whole thing would never go off. So my father was at that point not in it. But\nthe...what really brought it off...and that was Johannes Popitz, the Prussian Finance Minister.\n\u2019He was head of a sort of semi-conservative people's party before Hitler, and Hitler tried to\n> From 1925-1929. Previously advisor to Prussian Interior Ministry, 1914-1919. Known as a tax\nexpert, his skills were utilized by the Nazis, although he never joined the party.\ngive some unimportant government offices to non-Nazis. At least, for the first time. And he\nwas in the state government, in the State of Prussia--which was reduced to non-functioning,\nreally. He left this government alive, but they had nothing to do. Popitz found plenty of time\nto conspire. The best thing was, you know, Mrs. Popitz was a Dutch born lady. And you\nknow who caught a fancy on her? Heinrich Himmler! She looked like a real Dutch. You\nknow, not the most French-like; she looked a little bit more like a milk cow. She was blonde.\nI mean, a wonderful personality; but Himmler was really interested in her feature, not in\npersonality. And Himmler courted this lady day and night. Sent her big boxes, silver boxes,\nwith inscriptions and so forth. That last until '36 and she died of cancer. Himmler was\nheartbroke. And he called the daughter whom I knew--and I knew the other son, Hans\nPopitz--and he showered this family with attention. And, of course, Popitz didn't like this at\nall. But you can't say no to Himmler, actually, if you want to live. So they accepted the...I\nlater sold it on the black market, these (laughing) silver boxes, to raise cash for the family.\nBut they...Himmiler still kept an eye on this family. And also the daughter, you know. She\ngot gifts, too. And so on. But Popitz--who was the greatest conspirator, you know--he had\nput this group together and so on. And there were almost attempts. And uh in '44, Popitz got\na call from his old friend, Himmler. He said, \"Johannes, we know everything. We know\nwhat you are doing. Don't think that you can operate here without me knowing. But you\nknow what that means: that you and all your conspirators are done with.\" You know,\nHimmler was the first defector from the Nazi group. And this is not known. I know it from\npersonal knowledge. Himmler proposed to Popitz that he would tolerate the plot. That if\nsuccessful, the plotters would actually guarantee Himmler and whatever entourage he\nwanted free exit from German into a neutral country; and that he would support any attempt\nof Hitler's life, as long as it successful. If it 1s not successful, of course, he will abdicate any\nresponsible. And will kill everybody at once out of necessity, of course. Because if\ninvestigation would have prove that Himmler knew. But, you know, Himmler knew that\nGermany was cooked. I mean, no one else knew it much better than him. He knew the war is\nfinished, over with. He knew that he is the major criminal in this game, and his only chance\nto survive was making a deal. And Popitz met seven times personally with Himmler. I know\nit from Popitz's daughter. She was even involved, too, you know. It's an awful scheme. And\nvery dangerous, of course, for Popitz. Now they agreed on this; and that actually persuaded\nthe military to come in. The chance that they... You see, Popitz worked on this like an eager\nbeaver, you know. He was a very honest human man--small, low voiced, nothing. Goebbels's\nwrote in his diary that actually vindicated any... any accusation against Popitz. Goebbels\nwrote, \"And this dog Hans Popitz does nothing else but conspiring against us. \" Goebbels\nwrote this in '43. If this diary was found, you can read it. So they went ahead and failed.\nBecause the military didn't have it. They are not courageous enough. (Laughter) And I know\nStauffenberg, and so on; and they don't know how it happened. It happened--in my opinion,\nof course--they were just not brutal enough. I mean, the French Revolution never happened\nin Germany. I mean, Germans do tt...if they kill people, they cut their heads off. If it was all\nsealed, official stamp of approval--like the killing of the Jewish and so--this was all legal.\nYou know, there were laws permitting it. So they did it. But do it on your own and resist,\nyou never get a German to do it. They are like German shepherds. Only they bite on\ncommand, and they are puppies if they are not told to bite. But unfortunately, if an outsider\ncomes and bite, they bite you. I have been bitten by a German shepherd, and a six year old.\nAnd I never forget it. (Laughing)",
        "Q: We are going to hold it and we are going to change tapes.\nTAPE #3",
        "Q: Okay, let's go back. You were telling me about your mother and friends and Himmler.",
        "A: Yah. Strange relationship. My mother was, of course, sort of an angel really. She helped\neverybody. Now when it came to our attention or people came to us or to our friends, they\nneeded immediate help. Something had to be done. A visa had to be gotten to exit Germany\nor somebody was in the KZ and maybe a case could be made to release them again. And\nthere comes in my father's career as a pilot. As I said before, he was assigned a sergeant who\ntrained him to become a soldier, and, uh, this man was just a sergeant, a professional soldier,\nand when we moved from Poland to Berlin, he worked and had risen to a pretty prominent\nposition as a civil servant in the Veterans Administration. But my father needed to have his\npension restored, so this man helped him, but this man had turned into a raving Nazi. But\nbecause as a old comrade so he overlooked the anti-Nazi attitudes of my father, and rehelped\nhim getting his pension and so on. They met once. . and then my father discovered that he\nhad married a wife who was born in the hometown of Mrs. Himmler's wife. And somehow,\nthis man's name, this Veteran's Administration official, had the heroic name Feige which\nmeans in English coward. (laugh) This was really a laugh, but as they...He had indicated he\nwanted to meet with my parents and so on to do the right thing...became sort of\nacquaintances. I think my parents were there socially once. And they never came and visited\nus. But Feige had moved from the Veterans Administration once Hitler came in and had\nbecome Goebbels assistant. Of course, it helped to know Mrs. Himmler, that was for sure.\nAnd, he. . he is also listed in the government publications as being Goebbels Ministerialrat,\none of them. But he had influence. But we saw also a possibility to influence Himmler,\nbecause Mrs. Feige or this coward's wife, she being the school mate of Mrs. Himmler met\nwith her once a week and both ladies played Bach on a harmonia, on a miserable harmonia,\nin Feige's household. And this too...I mean non-political people, they didn't care about one\nthing or the other...only Bach. So Bach was right. And they played for 2, 3 hours on the\nharmonia, and departed but, of course, like some women do they chat a lot and all this, so we\ncould see that there was a possibility to influence Himmler and when we got really...and I\nmean we, that means my mother, of course...got cases where nothing would have. My\nmother called Mrs. Feige, and said, \"I have here a terrible case, you know, once a personal\nacquaintance of friends of mine. Although we know these are difficult ttmes and so on, what\ncan we do? Can you tell Mrs. Feige his name is so and so and so and so. (laugh) Can you\ndo something. Tell Mrs. Feige. She can tell her husband. We guarantee you this is\ncompletely justified and so on. In most cases, this worked. I mean these were not really\nprominent cases, but say this, but prominent people, let's say economics was enough to get\nkilled by the Nazis. In their book it was a crime of major proportions. But Himmler wanted\nto keep up apparently his image like a normal man also. And, of course, his wife probably\nhad a lot to do with this. She was probably nagging him and he conceded and then my\nmother got a call from the Himmler headquarters, Sicherheitshauptamt, that she was called to\npick up the visa for so and so. My mother has absolutely no fear. I mean she has nerves like\nsteel. She can sleep in the most trying circumstances, and she just went there. To go in there\nwas a very big favor alone you know. These SS guys, they knew that Himmler had\nsomething to do with my mother's coming, got up, saluted here, and so on. And my mother\nlooks like Mrs. zero. She does not arouse any interest. She was just about, if Himmler would\nlet in, let's say a Jewish woman who was alive but in his mind, but already dead. That's how\nmy mother looked. She looked completely nonentity. She got the visas. They saluted. My\nmother marched out. Case closed. You know, and that...I don't want to make propaganda for\nHimmler, but there is a side you probably would not have expected. Not everybody has\nconnections to the wife of a dictator, but if you do, there is a chance you get somewhere. So\nwe used to...I 1 mean some of the 20th of July people also got arrested and needed to get out,\nyou know. My mother got them out. Jewish people or professors and so on, you know. So\nMrs. [Heumner (ph)]...we got them out.",
        "Q: You got them out through Mrs. Feige?",
        "A: Yah, Mrs. Feige, Mrs. Himmler, and Mr. Himmler finally. I mean it is unbelievable, I\nmean, to me, even today. I mean I wouldn't...you know being a youngster I might have gone\ninto the Reichssicherheitshauptamt, but anyone over 20 would not, because that was a place\nnot to be. For no reason. And that was that. I mean, you see it takes courage and the nerve\nto stay on your charted course. You know a dictators really dislike enemies, but they dislike\nenemies who waver, you know. And actually, if you are staying on your course, they are not\nsuspicious because you act like them almost. You see they don't waive, they don't give in on\nanything. And you appear as if you are ready to get what you came for and then they give\nyou a break. I think it's the similarity of format you know.",
        "Q: You have brought...you have got pictures here?",
        "A: Yah, by looking through my pictures, to my astonishment I see a picture which I have never\nseen. Somehow it, I thought it is a friend and former colleague of my father, Mr. actually\nAlbert Gunter. He called himself usually Albougie. (ph) It's a picture here in Szopot near\nDanzig, a resort, seaside resort, with his daughter and wife, a very elegant woman and a very\nsweet girl. But he was...he was, you know, as you can see, a typical family picture, at a\nsummer vacation at the Baltic Sea. Uh, this man had worked tn my uncle's office...in my\nuncle's factory as sales manager trainee, as has my father, who went out. They became\nfriends naturally and when this area became Polish again he went to Germany and joined a\ncompany in Stettin, which produced bakery ovens, bakery equipment, and that sort of stuff.\nMy father kept on and off, you know, contacts and so on. When we came to Berlin, moved to\nBerlin, he came visiting us, you know, sort of see how we are doing, and I think it was in 35\nor so, this picture is 36. He came in and I overheard the conversation, and he said, \"Carl,\nImagine! I got an order for I think it was 50 ovens for the concentration camp in\nOranienburg, near Berlin. What do you think? Do they expect that many prisoners?\" 50.\nThese were ovens to bake bread. At that time, it was who knows. It looks quite dim if they\nneed that much bread, they probably get so and so many people and so actually, the\nexistence of KZ concentration camp was known all over Germany by the way. That is\nsimply not true what Germans say now, in my opinion at least. I knew it the first day. Why\nshouldn't intellectual Germans know it the second day. No, it was better not to know. But\nthis man had some misgivings about this firm, was Kirst und Soehne, from the Sttetin, was\nprobably the fifth or so largest producer of ovens and so on. And, after awhile, Mr. Gunter\ncame visiting us again and they ordered even more, and he indicated that they are using these\novens to not bake bread, but to burn corpses. He was really shocked. I mean if you got news\nof that kind in Nazi Germany, you were really not much shocked you know. You knew they\ndid everything imaginable, mean to people. But he was shocked, and he slightly felt\nresponsible, I think, that he had lent his hand, maybe in the beginning, of course, not\nknowing what this was for. These ovens were regular baking ovens as far as I know. I mean I\nhave seen films...I have seen films actually with the firm's label on the door of these ovens\nand I don't think they were modified for this new type of application so. . but, of course,\nknowing it, that its use to it, possibly I mean, actually, I wouldn't have gone through with it. I\nwould have retired or something, but he went to apparently to the very last and, uh...in 44, he\ncalled on our home, apartment door. My mother was gone, my father was out of the city, and\nhe talked to me and this man broke completely down. He said, \"What have I done?\" I must\ntell you I was not a friend to him. You know he was much older and somehow, this man was\nSO nervous, So super nervous, he said. . what have...and he asked me...I was what...I was 20\nyears old...and I was so embittered to see a man before me that I said, \"Mr. Gunter, the only\nthing you can do...commit suicide. \" It was terrible for me to say it, but I knew everything.\nNot from him, but from...of course, you knew everything. And for me, having somebody\nbefore me, an intelligent German man, having done this did not say no, I mean, he probably\ncould have invented hundreds of reasons...so I was really...maybe it wouldn't have been my\nstyle...I said you have nothing else to do but commit suicide. By the way, he did. Not that I\nhave great power of persuasion, but he felt that's the only thing you can do. Things which\nhave been done, you lent your hand, your talent, you knew, at least along the line, that you\nactively supported, for me this was your death. It would have been my death. That's why I\nsimply had a very strong commitment not in any way support this system. It was my life\nreally because if they kill others, they kill you. Nobody has to get killed for political reasons.\nAnd I knew if I am in it, I kill myself. I don't kill other people. I kill myself. It's everywhere\nlike this. If you see reasons to kill, do it only then when you want to kill yourself. That is the\ncrummiest thing you can do. So later on, my mother lived in West Germany and low and\nbehold, she met Mrs. Gunter and her, by then, very pretty grownup daughter. I mean, she\ndidn't know about this visit, of course. I think he never returned to her. We didn't even know\nthat he committed suicide. Only when my mother met her in West Germany, she told us.",
        "Q: You have other photographs and papers. Tell us about those.",
        "A: Yah, Here, I just have had a Otto Nifert (ph). Actually was a Colonel during the Nazi time.\nPrior to that he was our neighbor. He lived in the apartment in Poland below us. He was a\nmember of parliament in Poland for the German minorities. They even had...but he was also\nknowingly...we found out later...that he was also a paid German Nazi agent. He received\nmoney. We found out through connections, something like 43. By that, he had already was\ndrafted into the army...and, uh, I mean during the upheaval occupation of Poland, he had\nbeen arrested by the Polish government. They found out about this later, secretly, but later\nwe found, he. . he survived all this...and established. . he was...had a repair business...a\nplumbing business...had big orders, and so was a very industrious man, but politically, he\nwas a Germany chauvinist as you ever seen one, you know. He had...was officer in first\nWorld War. He had this typical Prussian officer's attitude. Only me, no one else! So, but he\nwas a piano player, a very voracious man, and so, he became in Nazi Army, a Colonel, and\nthen rose up, up, and became the last Commandant of Danzig. He finally moved out with the\nevacuation ships, and landed in Bonn of all places, and established a new (laugh) a new\nplumbing business there, also successful and all that. There must be somebody who 1s re-\nestablishing these people. And, of course, his attitude toward Poles, Jews and so was that\nwhat you could expect, you know. But to know a person and you always think, all\nthese guys, they don't come back. They don't come back. But they do. As we see now in\nGermany, no objection to this. Here's another case. This man used to be my law professor at\nBerlin. I studied 2 semesters, 43, 42 and 43 at Berlin Law School because I wiggled out of\nthe army. I did some important work for the German armament industry, and they (laugh)...I\nhad to commit myself half a year to serve 1n the air. The equipment was such. . laboratory\nout of Berlin where everything the Germans had up their sleeve, was developed, evaluated\nand known. I sit right in the right place.",
        "Q: Where did you send it and how?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: How did you transmit the material out?",
        "A: Uh, actually, through not direct contacts, but I had...I suspected that these people...they\ncouldn't tell me of course, that they would put it in the night hands. I mean I became aware of\nthe development of the V1, V2 weapons. This was, by the way, quite an open secret amongst\nthose who knew. The other things, the Colonel who became my super...I was in personnel...I\nhad a very low...but personnel is a very good position to know everybody. My superior was\nHauptmann Schwabel, it...was the guy from Nuremberg. Actually being a Bavarian, you\ncould think maybe he had some leanings to the Brown movement, but he was low and\nbehold an anti-Nazi as you could possibly get it you know. I came into the office and we sit\nthere like little choir boys who couldn't sing you know. Everybody was thinking, is that guy\nanti or for? And, of course, this was the decision. This man. . his family lived in Nuremberg.\nHe was alone. He couldn't talk to anyone. So I came in there, and sounded to me awfully\nuncomfortable, and then some remarks I did and so, and he covered__ and then I took the\nrisk, and became full fledged anti-Nazi and told him everything I heard over BBC and this\nman got so additive. Me telling him. He was there at 6:00 just not to miss me, you know.\nAnd we became like this. I could find out anything. He was waiting to betray his great\nFuhrer as best as he could, you know. And we had fun, you know. All these things were not\ndone in the style of...not with me like you see it in Hollywood... two serious men talking\nserious stuff only. We laughed our head off. Of course, this whole thing was a big joke once\nyou looked through this fakery and outsidish activity which was all fake, fake, fake. I mean\nyou could have a laugh of your time. You...1f 1t wouldn't have been for this killing and\nmurdering, I could have laughed Hitler off and he would have been out in the rubble of\nhistory, never to be remembered. But what he really established is the unchallenged position\nas a most mass murder ever. Nobody has ever single handedly...I mean on a single\norder...killed that many. And the dumbest in this whole game are the Germans themselves.\nAnd they still have not found out that they were the victims too, including the German Jews,\nincluding Jews everywhere, including everyone who was just not a German, you know. I\nmean...but the Germans paid dearly and willingly. For what reason? Only stupidly! The\nmost intelligent people on earth are also the dumbest and why? Social organization pits one\nGerman against the other. Nothing has changed, in my opinion at least.\nHere's another wonderful German. He was a coach for law students. His name is uh, uh, uh,\nProfessor Reinhart | H\u00e9hn. \u00b0He was a coach in Jena. And he...",
        "Q: Tell me.",
        "A: Yah, he was mentioned here in this letter (coughing) as a conduct Himmler to him. I seem to\nknow all the people who uh have a way to get to Himmler. When I met this man, he was\nProfessor at Berlin Law School, Berlin University. He had become party member at 32, and\n(cough) got the attention of Himmler through some unspecified contacts. And Himmler was\nlooking for somebody to establish a special...a special section in the\nReichssicherheitshauptamt [NB: the RSHA], in his headquarter, to establish an index to all\npersons who were suspect of being anti-Nazis abroad and inside Germany, or presenting a\ndanger to the Nazi system. Of course, without saying, Jews were in it automatically. All of\nthe Jews. And Hohn was a man who developed...which finally ended up into something like\n50 million index files where all Jews in the world, all anti-Nazis, all socialist, all union\nmembers, all modern artists which did not present the ideas of art of the Fuhrer, or\nanything...Anyone who ever came to the attention of the authorities. By the way, the German\nforeign service was instrumental in this. For instance, getting the names and addresses of\nJews in America. Unfortunately, unwilling, at least there was a couple of Jewish foreign\nservice officers in the German foreign service who were advised to get address lists from\nsynagogues. They went to their synagogues. Got the addresses there. But other Germans,\nthey posed as Jews from Germany, (cough) obtained freely address material and send them\non to Berlin. You see, otherwise it wouldn't have been possible for the Germans to know\nwhere Jews lived. Coming to Italy, coming to France, coming to Estonia, so...It was not\nalways (cough) German agents who knew where to knock. The Germans knew before they\ncame there where to knock. Telephone number, whatever. And this was this man's work.\nAnd actually, he couldn't do it along. He is the man who hired Eichmann. And I think\n\u00b0 See Raul Hilberg.\nnobody knows who hired him. Eichmann...was but us know (ph) (laughing). Eichmann was\nrecommended to him, you know, for being a diligent worker. And this Eichmann, of course,\nhelped; and probably he was...I never met Eichmann. Although I must say, my rowing boat\nclub, student club, was located next to Eichmann's office in Kleinerwannsee...Actually, next\nto it was Hohn's office. His university institute for state law he ran. Also,a fake the fact this\nfaculty did not really exist, but Hitler appointed Hohn a professor because he wanted Hohn\nas SS man. And he became finally SS General. Uh, and uh Himmler's personal counselor, if\nhe nedeed one. But this Institute was on the Kleinerwansee, on a bridge. The next house was\na longish, brownish bungalow type--but very large. Nobody knew who lived there. But I\npersonally saw these SS men with these long coats. I mean, they looked like murderers; and\nyou couldn't have any doubt they were monsters, as persons, even. You know, nobody talked\nto them or even looked at them. People...And next to it was the club house for, you know,\ngymnasium students. It was an association, this club house existed since 50 years or so. So\nwe went there rowing; and so you saw these...Made your heart stop, you know, just seeing\nthem so. An obvious brutality, you know, as they walked or so.",
        "Q: How did you find out that Hohn hired Eichmann?",
        "A: Oh, this was reported by a very famous German journalist. Let's see. Yah, there is a\ndocumentation on that. I didn't see it. But the President of the German Pen Club, I know him\npersonally, also. I worked with the British information service after the war. And he was...he\nhad fled to Britain, and became our security chief. I discussed what's his name... He is very\nfamous, he has written about...had documentation on it, because of his British position. He\nhad really easy access, and uh I think it is not disputed. It has been uh reported many times,\nbut what really happened to Professor Hohn--being a big shot in the Himmler\nhierarchy...One aspect of this index was also to record Nazis who had embezzled money,\nwho had misbehaved, sexual offense, and so. And Hohn inserted this due to his office\nanyone who was a danger. But you know, the old cronies of Hitler were in this index, too.\nAnd it backfired to them. And many of these cronies went to Hitler directly--because they\nworked with Hitler on a personal basis in the pre-Hitler days--and complained that \"What 1s\nthis man doing? Is he trying to stamp out us old Nazis? We helped you. Remember it.\" And\nHitler got really angry. Hitler was not attached so much to this man. Himmler was. But not. .\nHit[ler]. So Hohn got removed from this position, and who ran it was Eichmann himself. But\nHimmler pressed and pressed to get Hohn back. And Hitler then, how I think the...the idea\nwas to appoint a SS man as a professor. Because as a professor, he could spy on the general\nprofessors in Germany who [had] the reputation not to follow necessarily so willingly a Nazi\nRegime. But Hitler gave in and appointed him, this Hohn, as a law professor. They created a\nnew faculty, state law faculty. Actually, the whole idea was to prove to the public that the\nFuhrer system is actually legitimate form of government, you know. This was...but he\ngot...when the started and the Germans invaded Poland, he was...this Professor Hohn was\nvery much involved in Germanizing Poland. And doing this, I, of course, became a student. I\nwanted to know everything this man had on his mind. Unfortunately, everything...the most\nterrible thing which could be thought of was his recommendation. A minimum sentence for\nany offense was death. I wonder (laughing) what more severe punishments would be. It was\ncompletely crazy, you know. So uh I had a girlfriend, and she had enlisted to become a\ndoctor. And her doctor father was this. She was not a Nazi. She was not a Nazi; but as usual,\na student in Germany, once you were to make a doctor, the university more or less prescribes\nto you who should be supervising your work. And that was she. She became a assistant\nunder Hohn. They usually used the doctorins as secretaries, more or less. You know, they\nlook over the doctoral dissertation and only with was one eye. But it's even done today. I\nmean, students in Germany have complained since 200 years about this. But so did Hohn.\nAnd she told me a few things what he was appointed Professor at two universities, Krakow\nand Poznan, in the occupied zones of Poland. And he actually gave training courses to Nazi\nofficials and SS, how to really clean up Poland. Actually, he helped in the formation of the\nPolish penal code--which was a German code, extra for Poles. They were not under German\nlaw, but under SS law. I mean, people who stole, blow head off, you know, and so. And uh\nhe was contacted by ethnic German doctor from Chomutov, which is actually in\nCzechoslovakia. \u2018And he is of German descent. And he writes here in this letter, \"Dear\nDoctor Hohn, since I know that you have close relationships with Reichsfuhrer SS Himmler,\nI want to present you the following. \" And he refers to an article which was written in a\nmedical journal--the possibility of sterilizing men forever by medical injection. It's a sad\nmoment, planned and so forth. And there is uh uh the contact, and don't let anyone see it;\nbecause you know bureaucratic ways, things get lost and so.\" But this too important, you\nknow. And he suggested (ph) prisoners of war in German and practically everyone they\ndon't like, but would liked to have work for them but not propagate, so that they don't\nendanger the German stock. I mean, a very nice proposition. And apparently Himmler got\nthis. Hohn said, \"I never forwarded it.\" But it is signed off by \"HH,\" which means Heinrich\nHimmler. And here the letter part, it suggested that test injections should be given to\nprisoners; and Himmler had actually had written here, in his own hand, writing \"Dachau. ns\nThat means the tests should be done in Dachau, which 1s...This man I thought had not\nsurvived the war, but he did. He is now...at least, if he is still alive, he's probably 81 or so. He\nrose to a very prominent position in German economic. He could not be a professor, because\na German students went on protest for it. But a German industry collected money,\nestablished a management research institute. In Bad Harzburg, he bought all hotels 1n this\nresort town; and even American firms sent their managers for the Harzburg model teaching\ndone by Himmler's deputy. Impossible! When I heard this, I phoned him and I said, \"Are you\nDoctor Reinhard Hohn? Were you professor 1n '43-'44?\" \"Yes. Yes. Yes.\" And I just hung\nup. I knew I had my man. Besides, the German embassy sent me informational material of\nthat institute with a picture of the director, Dr. Hohn. I know he has a big... on the left check,\na big, blue mark still in this picture. I knew it had to be him. And knowing this, I wrote a\n\u2019 Located in the Sudetenland.

He went to Poland; and I, on my own money, joined him to go to Poland.\nBecause I knew that this document existed. I conferred with the Polish War Crime\nCommissioner, Mr. Chaplinsky.

        "A: No, but it was repeated. They actually said...the State Department released a memorandum\nwhich has no author, but enormous delivery schedule--at least 10 different agencies. First, I\nam mentally impaired somehow. I murdered somewhere, sometimes, a State Department\nofficial. I am a person who 1s really a terrorist, because I was in the Danish Resistance\nMovement, you know. Our real objective was to blow up the railroad train tracks. The\nDanish government said in Denmark, and the orders were given from England, to...I mean,\nthe Danish government said in England...It was recognized even by the German as a\ndirecting party. They had promised not to do anything against Germany. They said, \"We are\ncompletely occupied. All we can do sort of undercover action to stop these supplies to\nNorway.\" So trains had to be blown up, and that was a major objective. But coming\nback...So this was viewed as a dangerous article I wrote, and I think I will give you this\narticle. I wrote in the Jewish Week. Phillip Hockstein, a friend of mine. I had written a lot of\narticles. When I came back, he refused to do it, too, you know. I don't know what's so\ndifficult. I finally, really, blackmailed him somehow. I am a very charming blackmailer.\nThey finally wrote this article; and the reaction was practically zero. Although, I attended the\nfunction at the Kennedy Center with the Queen of Denmark. Kissinger was there, was\nactually the maid of honor, herding people around the Queen and so. But finally he lost\ninterest in this, and this Queen (laughing) was standing there all by herself. And she accepted\n(laughing) me like I was a foreign minister of the United States. Which I will never be, not\nafter this rumor. But people sort of noticed me, and then I heard people talking about my\narticle. I know you are a famous journalist then when you went go to a outhouse on a farm\nand they have newspaper for toilet paper, and when you find that one article of yours appears\non that piece of toilet paper. Then you are really famous.",

        "A: I was born, of course, uh...",
        "A: My name 1s Carl--C-A-R-L--H. Kniiemann--K-N-E-U-E-M-A-N-N. Kntiemann. And I was\nborn in Bydgoszcz, Poland. Actually, the Germans called it Bromberg. A very difficult name\nto spell, so...",
        "A: Uh, 1922, 15th of November. And, of course, uh I lived there until 1932. And in November,\nwe left Poland because my father was German citizen and businessman. We had a small\nfactory--bakery machinery and stuff like this. Uh, so...",
        "A: Yah. In Poland, actually, compared with Germany, it was a free country. I came to Germany\nexpecting a paradise. My parents had told me that it would be like this. But it turned out that\nlife in Poland was like living in a democracy. There was strike, there was economic\nhardship; and so as a child I was very much aware of it. Most of my friends were Polish boys\nfrom the streets, and so...And uh because there was strife between the German ethnic\nminority and the Poles. The usual fare was, you know, when we had children's dispute or so,\nmy friends came up to me and said, \"Tomorrow!\" It meant actually they were mad at me;\nbut they never came with a knife and cut my throat. I didn't expect them to either, you know.\nThey didn't expect to do that either. So I got really right thrown into, you know, uh ethnic\nproblems. And you get used to it. And uh you are not missing it necessarily, but you are not\ngetting upset about it, you know. My mother is of Hungarian, Polish, and German descent,\nall three. The family came from Hungary originally via Salzburg. And Frederick the Great\ntook these Salzburg Germans into East Prussia. That's where my mother landed. And the\nfamily mixed with Polish uh persons, and so she is a completely relaxed person. My mother\nis Just...1s not getting upset about anything. But already as a child I knew when a problem\ncame up, she stepped right in and helped solving it. She never turned her back. My father\nsame thing. I mean, I lived...I had the luck to be guided by the example of my parents. So it\ndropped out of me to you know, I mean any strife and so on, I am not necessarily personal\nmistakes solving problems, those problems, but sometimes it better to increase the problem\nand make it so bad that people see it once what a foolish thing it was, and they stop it. So I\nwas a happy child. My father was a hunter. He went fishing. He was socially quite active.\nWe had parties our house. Being a businessman in Poland meant actually that you had your\nclients invite at least once or twice a year. Once at least for a big hunt. Uh, that's why my\nfather really kept the hunting ground to have a party opportunity to reward his customers.\nMy father also became honorary consul of the German Weimar Republic, so as a\nbusinessman...And he served in this function, I think, until '29 or so. And, of course, he knew\nabout the Nazi and didn't like anything of their stuff whatsoever. Because of the foreign\noffice in Berlin things were discussed and the officers of the foreign service, they already\nindicated that Hitler will take over very soon. So the message of doom, at least for my father,\nwas quite clear. It didn't...1t took one incident. My father was riding by train from Berlin to\nBydgoszcz. And he, of course, used first class, and as a businessman. And another person\ncame into his compartment--a German who traveled to Germany, too--and after the train\nstarted to move, this man opened his briefcase and took the Nazi Central Newspaper out,\n[the] Volkischer Beobachter. My father, seeing this...he didn't like the type of person\nanyhow. He looked like a reserve officer, had the bearing of a military man. He saw this, my\nfather really angry. He took his briefcase from out of the rack and told this guy, \"I don't want\nto share my compartment with a man who reads the Nazi paper.\" That's what the kind of\nperson my father was. Because he addressed the right person. This person was actually his\nreplacement. You know, he was on a visit to Bydgoszcz to talk to my father how he would\ntake this over, you know. And later on, a day or two later, he met him. This guy came\nvisiting and said, \"I am Consul [Bernhard (ph). '\" And he...Of course, it was an icy meeting;\nand my father was relieved of his position in a week's time. This guy had gone back to\nGermany and wrote up the incident in the compartment; and that really fixed my father's\nfuture for good. My father, of course, didn't need that job at all. It was really uh more bother\nthan reward. He ran his business. But then the recession came and Poland was very hard hit.\nMy father was German citizen living on a passport. So the Poles said, \"Mr. Kniiemann, why\ndon't you go back to Brandenburg?\" That is what Germany was called in Poland. And we\ngot an order that our visas would not be prolonged, and that we had to leave by the end of\n1932 to Germany. My father could have gone to Essen; but Berlin was the next city, really\nbig city. And he had probably better opportunities to get a job. But he was in error. He came\nand he was told, 'No job for you. \" Because of his remark. And Hitler was not even in\npower then. But they already had...you know, the Nazis had already moved into strategic\npositions and already influenced the selection of people who could be hired or not. So my\nfather never got a job offer. He just unemployed from 1933 to 1945.",
        "A: He was...he was actually a veteran. But being a German national, he had actually abdicated\nhis right for pension because \"I don't go and collect from my father[land]. \" That was the\nattitude. An idiot, of course. (Laughing) But he... finally, he was terribly sick. He had TB,\nopen TB, and was about to die; so they admitted him to a veteran's hospital. And his pension\nwas restored, but on a level about 50% disability. But he was really 250% disabled, really.\nSo he spent uh half a year in the hospital; was operated several times, of course, to no avail.\nBut the acute conditions were removed. My mother and my sister and I, we lived in\napartment which cost as about 80% of our income. And when we came to Berlin, people\ndidn't believe it. They thought we were criminals. Kicked out from Poland for not paying\ntaxes, or stealing something, and so forth. I mean, the Germans to me were completely\ninsensitive--even to the needs of their own people in a way, you know.",
        "A: They thought I had a Polish accent. That is enough. You know, (laughing) people have\nfunny notions. If you are Hungarian, you are necessarily a Gypsy or violin player.\nHungarians can play violins very well. Most, I guess, don't play violins. But being of Polish,\nbeing...having this title \"Polak\"...And I, as a child going into Berlin school, was treated as a\nPolak. My German was really quite good, but not perfect. I had a Polish accent and also uh\ndidn't have the wealth of words to describe things in German. So when this happened, I sit\ndown and really learned German. And actually better than most Germans. I really speak\neven today better German than most Germans. Definitely!",
        "A: Yah. Here is my Polish birth certificate. This is a major obstacle in my whole life. When\npeople ask me, \"What are you?\" I say \"Polish. \" They say, 'No, your German gives you\naway. You are German.\" And, of course, here in America I am now American citizen.\nOften people say, \"But you have an accent.\" Then I say, \"Yes, I was born Polish. \" And\nthey say, \"No, you have a German accent.\" I say, \"Unfortunately, I suffered from being\nborn in Poland. Because I had to immigrate here. The quota was full, and no entry for me in\nthis country. For long years, you know, I... So you get hit, no matter what you are. If you are\ndifferent, you get it. And I learned that in Poland, even when I was born, the kids came and\nmet this...It was not meant in a bad way, (cough) it was just the type of reaction they had\nwhen they saw something who was different from them. And it's everywhere.",
        "A: This is actually my German maturation diploma, which entitles me to go to university.",
        "A: Yah. So this took also some doing, you know. I had avoided joining Nazi Youth\nOrganization and so forth. I had a terrible time to fake myself through to be admitted here\nand so forth. Of course, I had a very good Jewish doctor who gave me attestations I was the\nsickest kid on the block. So they got easy on me, you know. And uh besides, legal speaking,\nmy age was a little bit too advanced to force me in it. The law actually uh spared those born\nbefore 1924. So I was born '22, and didn't encounter much trouble. But the authorities, when\nI applied going to...to--let's say, college--would call, they said, \"You are not member of any\nNazional Socialistice (ph) organization, you know. Only we...are only interested in people\nwho become leaders here.\" (Laughter) I said, \"I am not very much interested being a\nleader, anyway.\" (Laughter)",
        "A: Yah. Here, that's the height of my career! (Laughter) I always tried to climb up that tree.\n(Laughing) And finally, my father helped me and took a picture. I was 2-1/2 years old. So\nthis was taken in 1924. This was my highest point in my career. I was really proud of it. You\ncan see the branches all debogged because I always tried again and again to climb up. You\nsee, I'm restless. | am a go-getter. (Laughing) Actually to maybe familiarize you, my father\nimmigrated, not immigrated, this area was German under the Kaiserreich and the were\ninterested in getting Germans in that because they wanted to, uh, discourage Poles to live\nthere. So people wanted to expand, get a new business. My uncle had done so. He was from\nEssen in West Germany. And my father went to Poland--or at that time it was Germany--to\nbeat...to learn the trade of sales representative in my uncle's firm. So, where they came from.\n. My father was the 24th child, by the way. The woman had two husbands. Of course, in\nsuccession, not at the same time. Although one could think...But there was no child after\nhim. That was the end of the line. (Laughing) But the house where my family comes from\nwas built in 1210, and is still standing--miraculously--in Eisenberg or Poleberg (ph). And I\nhave just met people from Eisenach, and they say, \"Oh, my uncle is a neighbor of the\nKntiemann family, and they lived next to this house. \" Was taken by my father, I think, in\n1923 or so. And these are my grandparents sitting in front. My grandfather was uh miner.\nThere were these many children. One could only operate the farm, so the others naturally\nwent into the...under...into the mines. My grandfather worked there 73 years. And on the day\nof his retirement, he collapsed and was dead. Real great thing to have a pension waiting for\nyou. (Laughing) And they kept it all, you know. And another distinction my family had, my\nfather was a veteran in the first World War. Lung shrapnel hit him. My grandfather--a\nveteran of 1971'--the same...the same uh (laughing) injury in the Prussian front. The French\nwere...My grandfather, the same injury. In the war with Prussia/Austria. \u201cSo same...almost\nthe identical. I am first one without an injury. I think I learned a lesson from the past, you\nknow. My father said, \"If you go into this war, and you get injured, you come home I beat\nyou up like you never have been.\" (Laughing) First thing was, of course, he didn't want his\nson to stand for this Hitler. He considered Hitler simple gangster. Nothing else, you know.\nHe took everything and gave nothing.\n' NB: 1871. This would have been during the Franco-Prussian War.\n* 1866.",
        "A: This is...my schooling started in a gymnasium. I think this was a second year in the school. It\nwas a normal...",
        "A: In Berlin. Was a normal school. Was still. . it was 1934 when I entered this. I was a little late.\nI was a year older, or two years older, than the rest of my...Because of my transfer from\nPoland, I had only Polish as a foreign language. And not French or Latin, or so. So I had to\ngo back. Also, my German was not that great. (Pause) They found. And uh so this teacher\nwas a Doctor |[Dunmeyer (ph). A very strange occurrence. He was a hunchback. And, of\ncourse, like anyone in Germany who was considered a weakling of normal--hunchback,\ncross-eyed, flat feet--that was an unwanted citizen. And this man, because of his...I think, of\nhis constants endurance of being looked at as a defective person was (sobbing) enormously\nkind. A person who... (sobbing)",
        "A: .. you could only love. And then this broken system came in, and this man was almost\ndestroyed. You could feel it, that he was not Jewish or anything. But he knew me--as being\nwhat I am, I presented a target for these gangsters who came in. I was defective. Well, just\nbefore this picture was taken, maybe a day or two before, our room was decorated with\nromantic scenes of landscape and quieting pictures. In the middle of class, suddenly two\nworkmen come in with a great stack of pictures. And you can see these pictures here. They\nrepresent German warships, tanks, military pictures. (Laughter) We knew at that time\nromanticism was over. We were supposed to sit in a semi-military environment, and pay\nattention to the great designs of our Fiihrer. Nobody said anything, but (laughing) what else\nwas this, you know? You could look out of the window, and maybe there was no swastika\nflag; but you could look in your room, classroom. Students often sleep; and when you open\nyour eye it is quieting to see tree, a landscape, you know, pastoral scene. Now you open the\nwindow, what did you see? (Laughing) War in progress. What a change! (Laughing) You\ndidn't have to be very intelligent to notice. So here is another class picture. That was\nprobably three years later. Oh, it was April '38, we...I can be seen here. I was on the outside\nto begin with. I always (laughing) had my escape route secure automatically. But here my\nthree other friends--we were a clique of four. We didn't belong. We all four didn't belong to\nthe youth movement, and so forth. And uh there are some prominent people here, who\nactually this man was a most intelligent man I ever met. He had the first name \"Carl Heinz,\"\nlike I have, but he...you know, difficult task he finished in 10 minutes. We sit there three\nhours and couldn't solve it. His name Witzberger, of course, made him suspect to be a Jew.\nAnd he...like Germans, they know exactly who 1s a Jew and who is not, you know--like\nAmericans, they know what a Negro is and not. I mean, know people have their\npreoccupation in identifying people. Like this man--he [was a] young man--he was a genius,\nreally. And he became later, after the war, the President of the East Berlin University. And\nactually he headed the Department of Americanism...American studies, you know. Even the\ncommunist people I know, East German government people, the record of this man was\nunquestioned qualified as nobody else. There was not even an idea of their head to take a\ncommunist and plug him in. Witzberger was their man. I heard some speeches of his over a\nshortwave radio. Of course, he catered to the communist view; but as such, he was fantastic\nman. The other man here is my friend--who's now, so to speak, the Cary Grant of Austria.\nAnd he has a very peculiar situation. I was at a draft board with him during the Nazi time.\nWe all tried... at that time, we wanted to be drafted actually; because we could have uh\navoided taking the examination to get the diploma. We would have been given this for free.\nYou see, going through the rigorous study...I mean, even becoming a Nazi soldier was not\nsuch a bad thing, you know. It...I hadn't studied anything. I started (laughing) four weeks\nbefore. But I had two subjects, geography and biology, [1n which] I was tops all through my\nschool years. So I...English was a very hard subject. Latin...Because of my political interest,\nI did less and less for school but more and more for other things, so...",
        "A: Yah, this was our class teacher actually. Classroom teacher, and here he is 1n full uniform.\nNow this looks pretty fierce, but he was really not. He was really a very kind and educated\nman. Even some people had ideas he was probably looking out for little boys, because he\nhad assistant which stayed with him in the back. And, of course, being out of view, you can\nalways say he does this or that. Germans have a wonderful sense of unfairness. When they\nsuspect, it's already fact. So this man was dedicated teacher, very good in his uh...I mean,\nvery rigid schedule of instruction. We had to repeat, had to draw keyper logs and so. For me,\nit was nothing. I was A-1 graded. I didn't actually particular... mean, I was not attached to\nthis man. He was fair and harsh, you know; but fairness 1s almost can he everything. I mean,\nmy favorite teacher was Dr. Hatcher, my mathematics teacher. And, of course, '36 or so he\ndisappeared. He was Jewish; and quietly uh one day didn't come. Fortunately, he had a\nchance to come here. I'm not...I am still not quite sure where Dr. Hatcher is. Not the famous\nDr. Hatcher. I mean, it could be. I mean, this man was a genius in his field. And as a\neducator, I have never seen something like that again.",
        "A: Yah. My father was, of course, very sick. And uh his friends were...we had a very close\nrelations with one family. It was a professor of pharmacology in Berlin, Professor Wolfgang\n[Heumer (ph)] and his wife. They were known anti-Nazi. My father knew very influential\npersons, in the military, in politics. For instance, later President Heuss, my father... The main\nplotter against Hitler way back in already 1933, was the really mayor of Leipzig, Dr.\nGoerdeler. \"He was the organizer of the rebellion against Hitler. And my father, being in\n* Carl Friedrich Goerdeler conspired with Johannes Popitz and Ludwig Beck to oppose Hitler.\npolitics, he was in the supervisory commission on the Versailles Treaty. The people of\nWestern Poland had the option to vote whether they want to be Polish or German. And there\nwas a German ___? , they stayed at our house. One man was Dr. Goerdeler--the main\nconspirator at the 20th of July; and Theodor Heuss, later President of the West German\nRepublic. * Actually, the German currency was so much devalued, this gentlemen had no\nmoney. They stayed at my family's house just living on what ever they got from ...People\nalso felt sorry for him, you know. He had been in World War I a pilot; and to some degree,\npeople attached some romantic ideas with this. It was the early pilot yet, got his pilot license\nin 1908. It was issued on a bicycle permit because (laughing) there was no form for pilot\nlicense. Actually, it came his...We had this later. My father had his old factory; and a\nneighbor of his was a hobby pilot and builder of aircraft out of broom sticks, by the way.\nAnd he urged my father get into the flying business. My father did. Got his license; and\nwhen the war started, he volunteered as a pilot in the army. I mean, there was no air force or\nanything like here, you know. And this is a very significant point, because he had to be\ntrained to be a soldier by his sergeant, you know. He had to learn how to walk, how to turn\nright, how to turn left, how to obey commanders, and so on. So this was a man with a heroic\nname. His name was \"Coward,\" actually Feige which means coward in English [NB:\nGerman], you know. But Feige is a very bad name for a military man. But this guy was\nstrict. He had a hair cut like me--no hair--and very determined, you know. So this...uh...My\nfather--like I, like my mother...I don't know, we are naturals at making contact. I mean, I\ncan...I walk here over the street and in one block I make 5 new acquaintances, usually nice\nones. (Laughing) I don't know what it takes. I personally feel I am entitled, and I should talk\nto everyone who doesn't want or wants to talk to me. I talk to everyone--from President\nBush, Carter, and so on down to uh Mrs. Thatcher. Uh (laughing) and, you know, I always\nhave something to say; something new, you know, because I know everything. So I knew\neverything in Germany, because my father was collecting what is going on in politics and so\non. So soon groups formed a civilian, actually. They were businessmen and suddenly they\ndidn't like Hitler. Because there was no business with Hitler, you know. It was only Hitler\nbusiness; and all the others had to do exactly like the Fuhrer wanted it. This brought money\ninto the scene. And, of course, any plot needs a lot of money. And my father was\ninstrumental to...Since he was unemployed, he was not wanted to be working. So he had a\nwonderful job doing the plotting against Hitler.",
        "A: You know, of course, one thing, once we came to Berlin we knew exactly there 1s a big\nproblem coming up with Jewish populations. We...I mean, Professor [Heumner (ph)] was a\nfriend of Einstein. I even had to shake Einstein the hand, I didn't know it was that jerk was. I\nmean, as a little boy I thought avoid people as much as you can. I was so shy, you know. No,\n* Elected September 12, 1949.\nthey say, \"Boobie\"--that was my nickname, Boobie--you know, and my mother calls me that\nto...to my greatest displeasure. And (laughing) I go in, shake hands with the professor. There\nwere four professors, Hoimner, Einstein, I think Dr. Lindler or so, uh, biochemist. And, I\nmean, they were all in the medical special fields. (Laughter) I went stumbling. I knew there\nwas somebody famous, you know. With the others, I got easier off; but I got a red head, just\ndisappeared to the woodwork, not to be ever seen that day, you know. I had enough. Besides,\nthere was no piece of chocolate or anything, as was usual. Of course, Professors, they always\ntake...they sit there. Even I think (laughing) Einstein didn't carry chocolate in his pockets. I\ndidn't get anything. But I don't remember anything really. So (laughing) he doesn't remember\neither. He never remember nothing. But I wasn't cross. This type of people suddenly became\nendangered species. And [Heumner (ph)|'s assistant for influence, Dr. Levy, and [Heumner\n(ph)]| had gotten...[Heumner (ph)] was known as being an anti-Nazi and here Minnesota\nUniversity, they had invited him to come here and teach, and he had considered it, but he\ntalked to his assistant, Dr. Levy, and said, \"Look, you go. \" [Heumner (ph)] suspected\ncorrectly that this would end in this Holocaust, no doubt about it. You know, he was privy to\ngovernment deliberations, you know, being sort of a FDA director. Because of this\npharmaceutical institute in Berlin was acting as a screening agent for the government, to\napprove medication and so on. He knew when, you know, was great resentment maybe\nfinally agree to immigrate to United States which saved his life, you know. It didn't\nmake...[Heumner (ph)]| survived all this. He was one of the first German scientist, he\nattended the International Pharmaceuticological Congress in Paris in 1935. He was\ninstructed to greet the audience with \"Heil Hitler,\" which he didn't do. (Laughter) But\nfurthermore, he even said, \"Colleagues, I have to tell you something. I come from Berlin.\nFrom the research which I have reviewed 1n the last two years, I have to conclude that these\ntests are actually performed on living human beings. \" He thought he would turn the world\nover. Like it is in conventions, nobody listens to these damn, lousy, boring papers. So this\nannouncement was just completely disregarded. Nobody paid any attention. The Nazis did,\nof course. But seeing that it was not heard, just disregarded. They were smart. They didn't do\nanything to [Heumner (ph)]. First, he was very famous. And punishing him, which would\nhave been automatic for anyone else--they didn't do anything. Not only this, they bestowed\non him an honorary golden party membership--which [Heumner (ph)]| refused, but he had to\ntake it. I mean, they just put it on his table and said, \"Take it or leave it. You are a party\nmember. Golden party. '\" He was upset. But they did something else. They appointed an\nadministrator for his institute, who was a super Nazi, Dr. Drukrei (ph). His claim to fame\nwas that he invented a covering wax for freckles. And this man is still alive. And this man\nactually beset [Heumner (ph)] like a vulture, just hacking into making his life almost\nunbearable. This man came through the war and this professor still and so forth. (laugh)\nUnbelievable, you know. He still is advertising his covering wax, Dr. Drukrei's wax,\nguaranteed to cover and so, this happened. Of course, Dr. Drukrei was taken like a fool by\nthe scientific community. They knew what he was doing, what his job was. I mean\n[Heumner (ph)] also had an assistant who turned out to be the...He was also a very unusual\nman. He was a communist party member actually. [Heumner (ph)] probably didn't know it\nand probably wouldn't have cared one way or the other. Later this man became the leader of\nthe liberal movement in East German, Dr. Havemann. Very famous case. He actually\nthrough a very funny incident became an anti-American. He, Havemann, in his time at\nHaarmness Institute, had befriended prisoners of war, Russians, and had facilitated their\nescape from Germany. He was discovered. Besides, he actually was really discovered\nbecause he listen to BBC. And when he come to the Institute, he disseminated the Western\nnews and probably Drukrei or his henchmen, they reported on Havemann. He was arrested,\ncondemned to death, and actually there was nothing anyone could do for him. But, the Nazi\nauthorities recognized the importance of his work, they installed a laboratory in the prison\nwhere he was held and he had to work on his projects. They were that important. And he\nsurvived the war, was liberated by the Russians, got into Berlin, was appointed President of\nthe Cosavillan (ph) Academy. It's like the academy of sciences here. It was located in the\nAmerican sector. Now, something terrible happened. These academy members had the\nprivilege to use the armor cars in the American officers club. The general commanding the\nAmerican sector, General Holley--a Texan, something like 29 years old, heavy drinker-- he\nmeets this German Haubermann, goes to him, and said, \"You, Nazi! What are you doing\nhere?\" I mean, threw him out, you know. He was drunk. Haubermann had the explicit right\nto be guest there... guest of honor, you know. He took it really very hard. He went up to him\nand said, \"You will never see me again. I am an enemy of the United States from now on. \"\nAnd he sure...he never came to the West or anything; but he made his stand later on as a\nreally democrat. He was arrested by the East Germans, was in imprisoned, and his family\nwas destroyed. And you know, you run into this, and there you...I mean, I was still quite\nyoung. I understood it perfectly.",
        "A: Had nothing to do, and then people came to him and there were not that many people had\nfree time. At least, you know, my father became a courier between Budapest and this was a\nlink to the Allies.",
        "A: Actually, he was a letter carrier. Yah. Actually, my sister had married to Hungary, so it was\nnatural to go on, on, on, on visits to my sister and, uh, the main thing was that messages got\nacross. And they got across, but uh Mr. Dulles, I think was not very, I think, not very\nskillful. They didn't believe that there was a possibility to get a non-Nazi group activated and\nprobably rebel and be successful. So the American authorities never took up on this. But,\nyou know, that's how life is you know. You cannot expect your enemy to give you full\ncredit, you know. And, of course, Hitler sounded fiercely enough, was fiercely, and even had\na chance in an American view and through some trickery he still could, with the help of\nRussian, of course, win, you know.",
        "A: To Hungary.",
        "A: From, actually, at least from '39 on. And actually, he knew generals. He didn't like military\nmen in particular; because most military men, at least in Europe, are stupid--politically\nstupid. They cannot make up their mind to rebel. Germans never rebel. They never rebelled\nin the whole history. And if they rebelled, it was unsuccessful. Because the ruling class 1s not\nstrong enough in determination. They are not strong enough to sustain themselves in times of\ndisorder because the ruling class never had the full support of the people. You see the\nGerman people are a non-entity of German politics. Even nowadays, the so-called\ndemocratic parliamentary, they say, \"If we don't do it, don't wait for the people. They don't\ndo it.\" The tradition is just not there. A single person or single group without support goes\nout and tries to take over and run the show. I, having been born in Poland (laugh), don't have\nthis tradition, you know. I suddenly realized that I am different.",
        "A: (Laughing) I was doing what was right, namely...(laugh). I was 12 years old.",
        "A: It was 12...'34. And censorship had been instituted all over Germany. All letters were\ncensored by the postal authorities. I mean, uh, samples were drawn and read. So any enemy\nof, or anyone who wanted to immigrate or file for immigration could not use the mail. Many\nJewish people had to contact people abroad just to make arrangements or beg for support for\na $50 ticket, you know. It was all it cost, by the way, to come from Germany to the United\nStates. If we went for the lowest classes, $50 did it. But it was very difficult to have. It just\nhappened I, we lived next to a railroad station, and I'm uncurable nosey. I want to know\nimmediately. I mean as a little boy (laugh), I wanted to know everything. Even now I have\nnot found out many things, you know, but what was possible I finally got to it. I know the\nstar wars secrets in the United States. I know the atomic secret. Everything came to me. I\ndidn't have to. They offered it to me. They employed me there. I had no security clearance or\nnothing. They talked to me like they talked to God almighty, you know. They know that guy\nis okay, you know. Although they have the deepest suspicion at the same time they come to\nme. So I don't know what's wrong with me, but people come to me and give me their most\nsecret secrets, you know. And afterwards they would think, \"What did I do. Why him?\"\nBecause I am perfectly the safest the holder of secrets. If you are my enemy, I use it against\nyou.",
        "A: Two Czech railroads...I mean, stewards of...sleeping car stewards. Their train was, or their\nwagon was laid over, and they had...Berlin was full with provincial Nazis and conventions. I\nmean, suddenly Berlin was not a convention town or so. Maybe business going over; but\npolitical, very little. The Nazis got very active and hotel rooms were not available. So these\ntwo porters came to me. They kid, \"Do you know somebody who (laughing) would rent us a\nroom for the night? We are laid over. We cannot find shelter. \" Of course, I knew it was\nFrau Mayer, next to us. She was married to a very presentable, respectable banker. But Herr\nMayer had (laugh) syphilis. He played around with a girl when he. It was tn his last. . when\nterm had died. I knew, besides Frau Mayer, because he was retired, she was a\nRomanian, violin player in the ladies' orchestra in a rather shady... This was just a perfect\nmatch for these two loose Czechs. I introduced the party. It was a total match. These Czechs\nwere anti-Nazi. Frau Mayer, of course was anti-Nazi. Her husband being a syphilitic,\ninfluential banker was just like inviting, you know, a crocodile for a state dinner you know.\nMayer was out, you know. So they started rooming there. I mean I couldn't have done a\nbetter match. And then we started, I was already 12, a blooming black market business you\nknow. Butter was short in Berlin and that and, you know, Jewish people ...I mean you had to\nregister later, and you could only get a quarter of a pound of butter and Jews could live\nwithout butter, they got no butter. So I knew there was a market for butter or you know,\nwhatever. I traded...I had a business maybe of a thousand marks a week. And going to school\nand doing all this, it was wonderful (laugh) you know, being so important. And then, of\ncourse, the other thing was just, uh, bringing letters out of Germany uncensored. And these\ntwo porters were replaced by about 40, 50. And they told the other colleagues to room there\nand what money they could...They got about, you know, they had to get some money for\ncarriers (laugh) because this was a capital of heads you know, because if you were caught\nsmuggling a letter out without circumventing the Nazi's censor, it was death. Simple death,\nyou know. Only thing you were remembered by was the announcement of the public on the\nwall. You have been shot yesterday morning. That was the last thing you were remembered\nby. So these people took a considerable risk, loss of jobs and so. But you know, I don't know\nwhat it was. Maybe 90 marks or maybe 400 marks. It depended where this letter had to go\nalso, you know. What difficulty, what calculated risks they had to take, you know. Never\nwas anything ever discovered, you know. Of course, I mean if you are international railroad\nporter, I mean, you know, everything. You know where to hide things where the authorities\nlook for, and you had everything tn line. It went like a charm. So I became very important. I\nmean this was almost a magic thing. I became known. And... mean people would never\nhave talked to a 12 year old, 13 or 14 year old, they came and said, \"Do something. We need\nthis to go through. \" I didn't even look what was in it, you know. I kept the postal secrecy,\nbut the government didn't. I knew it was death anyhow, you know, if it was discovered. It\ndidn't mean whether they paid or didn't pay. It was necessary. So.",

Political opponent; not\nphysical, but of a different opinion. That was enough. So these people were also curtailed in\nreceiving food and so on, you know. It was not rationed yet, but there were quotas set what\nyou could buy. And Jews were out; or they were so low...I mean, a rabbit could live on it, but\nnot a human being.

There was always,\nwe had always two, three people being overnight with us. People on the move, you know.\nWe didn't ask who it was or so.

No,\nno, no. So there was a Jewish department store--Fada(ph)--and it was a credit shop. And\nthese people were enormously nice. They took less (laughing) less, you know, interest. And\nthey were human beings. You know, after all, an economy has to serve people. But these\nNazis or these regular, they were so charged up: \"A straight German pays cash!\" It was\nalmost a demand of the political system. But it didn't quite work. Once the Jews were gone,\nthere was no credit; and Germans were hurting. They couldn't buy what they needed. We\ncould buy.

Of\ncourse, I ate my dinner and I sneaked out to look. I mean, I had to see this. And sure, it was\nworse than I thought. You know, the owners stood in the back of the shop. There were SA\nmen, mean, behaving like crazy, throwing the stuff in the street. It (cough) was a two-story\nhigh shop, and throwing things down. I mean, there was already need for all materials.\nPeople couldn't get what they wanted. They have to go there and destroy it, just because they\nwant to hurt Jews. They hurt themselves. But I went home. I listened to BBC. I got (cough)\nwhatever background there was to get. I would say, in general, Germans--because of\nreligious prejudice and so--by and in large are not necessary pro-Jewish. It would be nice if I\ncould say differently. I think it's...all of it is fake. Germany and now. Germany in the past.\nAnd for...and unfortunately, Germany, the so-called intellectual progressive of country 1s not\nbehaving at all fair. You see, it's an ingrown uh feeling. They are not German citizens. And\nany non-German is suspect anyhow. Like I had it. I was at least partially German. So I\nexperienced the same way. Maybe that's why I am so sensitive about this. For me, there was\nno reason to be believe. Jews were just another...a Jew was just another person who had\nGerman nationality and lived there for hundreds of years. But he was a Jew, not racially a\nGerman. We start with that, we can actually split up in nations of one person, you know.\nEverybody...",
        "A: It started already, of course. You became involved in all this. Anything I could do to damage\nmy government, which I did not really consider as legal as my government. Anything I could\ndo. And if it was I called known Nazis day and not until they got crazy.",
        "A: I mean, phoned. Just crank calls. You see, I am a bad boy. I mean, really bad. They really\nbecame almost insane, you know. We divided our rolls. We didn't let them sleep a minute.\n(Cough) I mean, these were really big guys, you know. Show-offs, and so on.",
        "A: And then, you know, it became...the war time came. I knew I didn't want to go. I mean, I had\none legal reason. I was too old. I hadn't finished school. Then...but I was at the draft board,\nthe draft record was established. And I had contacted an infection in my ear from the\nswimming pool. At that time, this was a hopeless case. My hearing deteriorated, and so on.\nAnd I had flat feet. And my father had to work the roses; and they looked at me with very\ncareful eye, and so on. And then I advised other students, my school uh uh mates, to take it\neasy. And I tell you, \"You can get killed out there. You are not killing others--which is not a\npleasant task either--but you can be the victim. And if you want to be alive, don't go there\nwhere they shoot.\" Many people had a different idea after discussions like that. Oh, I have\nto mention one of my school students. One school was shut down, and the students were\ndivided in other schools in Berlin. And there comes a Mr. [Heyder (ph)]. I think that was the\nfirst hippie I ever encountered, you know. This man was a little older. He had...he failed one\nof the other class. And he was as anti-Nazi as openly as you could wish, and he had all the\nlooks of (laughing) a non-Nazi and obstinate student. 'Cause things like that cannot survive\nvery long. But he was really clear. He was an artist, a very good one, more than artist. His\ncollection of records was \"Three Penny Opera,\" \"In the Mood,\" and so on and so on. His\nfather had died. His mother ran the business as a business consultant. Very successful. He\nwas pretty much on his own, you know. He lived at the Kurftirstendamm--it was prominent,\nlike living on Broadway in the better section. And he had gotten together, first had called\nmany, many Jewish youngsters were around him. He was tolerant actually to all things. And,\nof course, when he came to school he slept a lot, (laughing) and he had the wrong hair cut\nyou know. One day, it really happened. Our classroom teacher had changed with our\nmathematics teacher. His son had been a victim... was killed in the war. This man had no\nforgiving at all for anything but straight Nazi and Vaterland. He said, \"[Heyder (ph)], stand\nup. I have to talk to you. \" In front of the whole class. \"Were you yesterday\u2019? Did I see a\nman...? Was that you with a completely silly looking jacket on?\" He had a cloth jacket, you\nknow. \"Was that you?\" \"Yes, Dr. [Fran (ph)].\"_ \"Was that you who smoked a cigarette\nwearing this cloth jacket?\" And then the worst thing came. \"Was that you who had actually\na female person on his arm? Was that you?\" He said, \"Yes, that's my future wife. \"\n(Laughing) I tell you, this wife, she became his wife. She was maybe 5 years older. He was\nof German consumption 16-l/2 or 17. That's a no-no, you know. So he was reprimanded in\nthe worst form. And, of course, [Heyder (ph)| became the hero of that class automatically.\nEven the Nazi boys, they admired him for it. And he then finally married this...And he\nbecame... There was no apartment to be had. The mother didn't like this marriage at all, so he\nmoved into my section of town. We lived, because we couldn't pay, in the worst section--\nprostitution, crime, everything. And apartments were about half of what they were in West\nBerlin. They couldn't find anything. So he rented a store--which was never heard of, I don't\nthink even here. And he made it sort of a artist studio, and really free for all. Everyone could\ncome in. And he had connections to the black markets and the stores. Very easy to serve.\nThey stopped, carry in, out; you know, you don't have to go four flights up or down. And his\nwife, being a very volumptuous woman...I mean, even the anti-Nazis knew there was\nsomething to look at, at least, you know. And they were just host to everybody, you know.\nAnd they established really a meeting point for people who were anti-Nazis. They had all\nthese American records, British records. Bertold Brecht was played. Anything which was\nforbidden by the Nazis, that's where you could hear it. And over the time, even SS officers\ncame. The strangest thing, they were so fed up by this, you know, even SS officers get tired.\nAnd they came, and they cooperated. We got even ideas from them, you know. They were\ncompletely disillusioned, of course, because they were really prisoners of the system. And to\nhave a day or two leave and full freedom. It was just...they could be human beings, suddenly.\nAnd, of course, then getting false passports for people needed to get out and so forth.\nEverything. And uh was a different world. I mean, it existed. Of course, the workers section,\nthey tolerated this. They would never have told the authorities, \"This bothers me, or this\nbothers me. \" They were maybe loud; but that was a noisy laughter here. (Laughing) It was\nanti-Nazi, you know. They would have loved to be part of it. And I tell you what it was in\nGermany. This murky little petit bourgeoisie-type, you know--which automatically hated\nJews because they were liberal--they were open, they had new values. The whole German\nculture is almost Jewish culture. I mean, in culture production--songs, and so on. I mean,\nthere is really, for me, I was neutral Germany. Whatever was, I took as being German. Not\nJewish, or not that: it was German. And it is completely hidden in German history books.\nEven a hundred years ago, what the participation of Jews this was. Since there was no\nknowledge about what this really was, to load the population into a anti-Jewish mode and\nmake them the strangers. (Laughing) Unfortunately, they were better Germans than most\nGermans. You know, we had friends they just couldn't believe that they were not guests in\nthis country. They were it, you know. And now what they wear turned against them. For\nreasons of a idiot coming from Austria.",
        "A: I mean, whatever resistance there was in Germany, I knew at least...I knew or could have\nknown, or frankly, I first evaded the draft. I got diphtheria. And to restore my health, I went\nto Hungary. My brother-in-law is medic over there; and he extended the...But then the Nazis\ntook over in Hungary. I knew I had to get out. So I went back to Berlin. And the minute I\ncame to Berlin I got the draft notice. And I couldn't really avoid it. But I got sick. First I got\nsick. I could not follow. And then they told me I had to report for medical examination again.\nThey took an X-ray, and somebody there felt sorry for me. We had talked politics and he put\na TB record in my record. And suddenly, the military doctor: \"Mr. Kniieman, take a seat.\nDo you sweat a lot?\" I said, \"No.\" I actually want to get out of Berlin; because it was\nalmost impossible to walk the street as a young man, you know. And then it finally\nhappened. I got a call, and nothing could help me.",
        "A: I mean, to get out of it. But I also was ready to go. I had met, a half a year or so before, a\nDane in a restaurant. I did know he was a Dane. He looked like anyone else. But we...I ate\nand he ate in a specific Nazi restaurant where you could get everything. I had enough money\nfrom and noticed the accent. \"Are you from Denmark or so?\" He said he was kidnapped by\nthe SS. He had actually written on an ad in the Copenhagen newspapers, and this was a fake.\nThey wanted to get young Danes out of Denmark and capture them. He was given a ticket to\nParis. He went to export/import business to interview. They said that \"You are hired, but you\nhave to talk to...Final interview is with the president of the company.\" He is led into the\nback room, and Jew sits there and SS General and goes over and says \"Mr. Oberg, may I\ncongratulate you for your volunteer application to the Viking Division of the SS.\nUnfortunately, we have to tell you you cannot go home. You will be sent to Berlin for\neconomics training. \" What they had in mind to capture enough indigenous population, train\nthem in business, for instance, make them sort of believer of the Nazis. And they promise\nthem at the end of the victorious war, of course, they will be put in place and manage these\nindustries for the SS. The SS had planned to actually establish its own economic base to\ndraw money out of these foreign factories and finance their adventures from foreign funds. I\nmet this man, and then I could see that was my case. Kay Oberg was his name. And he, uh...I\ninvited him home. And his father had a delicatessen shop in Copenhagen. And he said, \"Yah,\nI am. I can't go now. They watch me.\" And so forth. We got him a false passport.\n(Laughing) That was nothing. We always had it. We need it. We had it. And he came home\nto Denmark now. Escaped. And he had told me already about the resistance move, and that\nhis family is in it, too. And I never thought I would need it, you know. But I was drafted; and\nof all places they send me was to Denmark. Since I am deaf, I was sent for wireless training.\nAnd they went through the rolls, and they said, \"What is your occupation - a student?\" That\nwas a \"Yes.\" Because to be a morse operator...And I was deaf. They didn't ask me that.\n(Laughing) And I thought I will not tell them (laughing) until I sit and fall, because I had in\nmind that I can go to the other sides. I came there and I faked it. I even did the qualification\nfor morse code school and all that, you know. But I had contacted Oberg and said I am here.\nAnd I expected actually that they would give me an address where to turn to, but 1t was not\nnecessary. I came into this new company; and there was lots of Poles, ethnic Poles, and\nethnic Frenchmen. And the manager of the canteen in the company was a Frenchman from\nAlsace-Lorraine. You know how it was, you wouldn't believe it, how you recognized each\nother, that you were anti-Nazi. I went into the shop. I left, and he said the same dirty laugh;\nand I knew exactly that was the man. You know that, nothing like in Hollywood film, code\nwords, you know you forget code words by the way. That is a very great danger. You know,\nyou have other things to worry about and, uh, now the code word. You are shot before you\nremember. But here it was just that you recognize this man at least wanted to have a life style\nwhich was yours. That you knew that yours and his were non-Nazi so that was all it took.\nYou could talk to these people at once without identification and so I went, after hours, to the\ncanteen and look my desire is to do anything to damage the Nazi factory. Finally, I think I\nwould like to go to Sweden. No problem, you know. I told him that I had connections in\nBerlin for weapons. I mean I could buy machine guns, anything. Like here, it's forbidden.\nBut actually Nazis were not that crazy. They...I mean you could have weapons, you know.\nMy father had hunting weapons, I mean, very dangerous ones, you know. And, uh, since\nthere were warriors and robbers anyhow, the old government, they didn't take it so seriously.\nBesides, the Nazis really thought that they controlled everything. They had no...they didn't\neven have a suspicion that there was a segment of the population really going after them.\nThey didn't know this. I mean there was the West that they contributed...you see that they\nwere the victims of their own philosophy. They thought Jews were the typical resistance.\nThere was...actually for a Jew, it was very, very difficult to be a fighter because people,\nofficials...you looked Jews, Jewish. I don't know some Jews I know looked more, they\nlooked more like Siegrfied, you know. But they looked for that type you know. I mean\neverywhere. In all countries. If they were gypsies, a chicken is stoled, and a gypsy was there\na week ago, he did it. There was always a minority which can be easily recognized. Round\nup the usual suspect. Like in the Casablanca film, you know. If they didn't find any of them,\nit was, uh, Jews do it any how. But in this case here, these Frenchmen, the ethic French men,\nthey were not trusted. But they were sent for occupation duty in Denmark. The Poles were\nnot trusted. They were sent for occupation duty in Denmark. So, there was need for weapons\nand I had the military pass. My father (laugh) conveniently got sick. I went to Berlin and\nbought two big suitcases full of pistols. And I repeated it several times. I...you see at that\ntime, the Nazis collected weapons from civilians, mostly weapons man had brought back as\nsouveniers from war crimes. And these women were impressed if they would be caught by,\nfor instance, if Russians, if they ever would come, they would be of course raped 15 times,\nmangled, (laugh) and all that. And these Nazi officials stood there and took the weapons 1n,\nyou know, and I stood outside the collection point. I know even the place, it was Horst\nWessel Platz. It was actually former headquarter of the communist party in Berlin. It had\nbeen turned into the Nazi office building and downstairs, they had the collection agency.\nAnd I stood in front of this, in my uniform, of course. I said, \"I come right from the front.\nYou know what we need. We need more weapons. You know the German army is not\nproviding us with pistol, you know. When the enemy comes running up to you, you cannot\nuse your rifle. I give you five dollars.\" (laugh) In 30 minutes, I had 2 big suitcases. I\ncouldn't even carry it, but I was soldier, I was, of course, a front soldier in Denmark, eating\nwhip cream by the gallon and so I delivered. That French man, he just gobbled it up.\nActually, these Frenchmen had full uniforms already for the loss of the war and at once\nestablished a French army unit in Denmark, out of the German army. And, of course, he had\nthe connection with the Danish Army, and so...I went to Berlin 3 times, did this and always\nwith the Wehrmacht train, the military train. It was never controlled. You could actually take\nanything you wanted. And the Danes were happy. I was happy. I brought butter to Berlin and\nso forth you know. And so I was never afraid really. It was...1f you know, if you do it for the\nright cause, nothing stops you. And whenever it comes, the threat of this thing and you have\nyour right cause, do it. Don't talk. Do it. You know, it's. . nothing is better than doing it.\nTrying to abolish it. Even if this is go yet. You just throw the stone where it hurts. And you\nknow yourself you never can, uh, uh, let this guy fall down. But you might hit where it hurts,\nand you are finally getting through with your message. So not that much difficulty. You\nsee...I think human beings are too civilized. I think maybe, in part, Israel is a good example.\nThey do it, against all odds. It's the only country which does it, I mean in my opinion. But I\nthink anyone can do it if he just wants it. Ifhe sees the danger which is directly against him,\nwhat he is running into. Don't run into it. Abolish this danger. So...",
        "A: No, of course, I first provided the full secret Morse codes to the other side. And I ran it.\nActually we had our headquarters above the German headquarters in Aalborg. We used the\nGerman antenna. That way we couldn't be detected. We attached our wires on that and, you\nknow, that was it. They came, they circled around, found a signal but it was there own...their\nown antenna. So that one of them. Finally, uh, uh, on the last trip I came back and my\ncompany was dissolved. So I had no organization to turn to and that was, of course,\ndangerous, uh, you know. And, uh, there was a way out. I figured it out. There was a central\nreporting point for the soldiers who had lost their unit and that was, you know, the Nazi\nsystem contrary to belief here was completely disorganized, at least in my eyes. It had so\nmany weak points. You imagined there was no computer yet. The transfer of a name was so.\n. Just impossible in a speedy fashion. Today, it's a one button, and the computer spues out\nwhatever you want. It was a very big problem, but the other problem, they over organized.\nSo many things were illegal. I mean more than legal. Everything was illegal to keep track\nwhat violation had happened, what people, uh, were involved was almost impossible to\nmanage. I mean, to get somebody, it's difficult everywhere. Let's say you search for a\ncriminal, but you are not getting your hands on this man that speedily. Now you do, but then\nit was really very, very difficult. To be a Jew, that was a different...people had a model in\nfront of them. It was a dark hair...certain features people thought was Jewish. My brother-in-\nlaw is Hungarian. He looks like 14 Jews. I mean, it happened, during his stay in Berlin, he\nwas accosted by people not to wear the Jewish Star, you know.",
        "A: My father had become so sick, he was not more involved. His T. B...actually we had\nrelatives in Poland. . and he had rented relatives...",
        "A: We had relatives...my uncle from my mother's side, they lived there. Actually, my uncle was\nPolish officer. And, uh, because of the air raids in Berlin, his being there was almost\nimpossible. And also the food shortage and so on. So he had rented from friends or relatives\na little house with a garden. He lived there. But, of course, he knew all what was going on,\nyou know, and actually we had two contacts. I mean it was Goerdeler and the initial plot\nnever came off. Actually, the plotters were doing this since really 34 and, uh, uh, they never\ncould get agreement from the generals because weapons are needed for a thing like this. And\nthey objected, they had given the oath of office on Hitler and so forth and besides, don't kid\nyourself, they never make a plot successful. (laugh) Through German history, these\nGermans are outspoken cowards. You know they are only form...not some...nothing in them.\nThey are actually removed from the people, you know. It's not a people's army in Germany.\nIt's the king's army or the Fihrer's army, and that was the biggest problem. And it seemed\nthat this whole thing would never go off. So my father was at that point not in it. But\nthe...what really brought it off...and that was Johannes Popitz, the Prussian Finance Minister.\n\u2019He was head of a sort of semi-conservative people's party before Hitler, and Hitler tried to\n> From 1925-1929. Previously advisor to Prussian Interior Ministry, 1914-1919. Known as a tax\nexpert, his skills were utilized by the Nazis, although he never joined the party.\ngive some unimportant government offices to non-Nazis. At least, for the first time. And he\nwas in the state government, in the State of Prussia--which was reduced to non-functioning,\nreally. He left this government alive, but they had nothing to do. Popitz found plenty of time\nto conspire. The best thing was, you know, Mrs. Popitz was a Dutch born lady. And you\nknow who caught a fancy on her? Heinrich Himmler! She looked like a real Dutch. You\nknow, not the most French-like; she looked a little bit more like a milk cow. She was blonde.\nI mean, a wonderful personality; but Himmler was really interested in her feature, not in\npersonality. And Himmler courted this lady day and night. Sent her big boxes, silver boxes,\nwith inscriptions and so forth. That last until '36 and she died of cancer. Himmler was\nheartbroke. And he called the daughter whom I knew--and I knew the other son, Hans\nPopitz--and he showered this family with attention. And, of course, Popitz didn't like this at\nall. But you can't say no to Himmler, actually, if you want to live. So they accepted the...I\nlater sold it on the black market, these (laughing) silver boxes, to raise cash for the family.\nBut they...Himmiler still kept an eye on this family. And also the daughter, you know. She\ngot gifts, too. And so on. But Popitz--who was the greatest conspirator, you know--he had\nput this group together and so on. And there were almost attempts. And uh in '44, Popitz got\na call from his old friend, Himmler. He said, \"Johannes, we know everything. We know\nwhat you are doing. Don't think that you can operate here without me knowing. But you\nknow what that means: that you and all your conspirators are done with.\" You know,\nHimmler was the first defector from the Nazi group. And this is not known. I know it from\npersonal knowledge. Himmler proposed to Popitz that he would tolerate the plot. That if\nsuccessful, the plotters would actually guarantee Himmler and whatever entourage he\nwanted free exit from German into a neutral country; and that he would support any attempt\nof Hitler's life, as long as it successful. If it 1s not successful, of course, he will abdicate any\nresponsible. And will kill everybody at once out of necessity, of course. Because if\ninvestigation would have prove that Himmler knew. But, you know, Himmler knew that\nGermany was cooked. I mean, no one else knew it much better than him. He knew the war is\nfinished, over with. He knew that he is the major criminal in this game, and his only chance\nto survive was making a deal. And Popitz met seven times personally with Himmler. I know\nit from Popitz's daughter. She was even involved, too, you know. It's an awful scheme. And\nvery dangerous, of course, for Popitz. Now they agreed on this; and that actually persuaded\nthe military to come in. The chance that they... You see, Popitz worked on this like an eager\nbeaver, you know. He was a very honest human man--small, low voiced, nothing. Goebbels's\nwrote in his diary that actually vindicated any... any accusation against Popitz. Goebbels\nwrote, \"And this dog Hans Popitz does nothing else but conspiring against us. \" Goebbels\nwrote this in '43. If this diary was found, you can read it. So they went ahead and failed.\nBecause the military didn't have it. They are not courageous enough. (Laughter) And I know\nStauffenberg, and so on; and they don't know how it happened. It happened--in my opinion,\nof course--they were just not brutal enough. I mean, the French Revolution never happened\nin Germany. I mean, Germans do tt...if they kill people, they cut their heads off. If it was all\nsealed, official stamp of approval--like the killing of the Jewish and so--this was all legal.\nYou know, there were laws permitting it. So they did it. But do it on your own and resist,\nyou never get a German to do it. They are like German shepherds. Only they bite on\ncommand, and they are puppies if they are not told to bite. But unfortunately, if an outsider\ncomes and bite, they bite you. I have been bitten by a German shepherd, and a six year old.\nAnd I never forget it. (Laughing)",
        "A: Yah. Strange relationship. My mother was, of course, sort of an angel really. She helped\neverybody. Now when it came to our attention or people came to us or to our friends, they\nneeded immediate help. Something had to be done. A visa had to be gotten to exit Germany\nor somebody was in the KZ and maybe a case could be made to release them again. And\nthere comes in my father's career as a pilot. As I said before, he was assigned a sergeant who\ntrained him to become a soldier, and, uh, this man was just a sergeant, a professional soldier,\nand when we moved from Poland to Berlin, he worked and had risen to a pretty prominent\nposition as a civil servant in the Veterans Administration. But my father needed to have his\npension restored, so this man helped him, but this man had turned into a raving Nazi. But\nbecause as a old comrade so he overlooked the anti-Nazi attitudes of my father, and rehelped\nhim getting his pension and so on. They met once. . and then my father discovered that he\nhad married a wife who was born in the hometown of Mrs. Himmler's wife. And somehow,\nthis man's name, this Veteran's Administration official, had the heroic name Feige which\nmeans in English coward. (laugh) This was really a laugh, but as they...He had indicated he\nwanted to meet with my parents and so on to do the right thing...became sort of\nacquaintances. I think my parents were there socially once. And they never came and visited\nus. But Feige had moved from the Veterans Administration once Hitler came in and had\nbecome Goebbels assistant. Of course, it helped to know Mrs. Himmler, that was for sure.\nAnd, he. . he is also listed in the government publications as being Goebbels Ministerialrat,\none of them. But he had influence. But we saw also a possibility to influence Himmler,\nbecause Mrs. Feige or this coward's wife, she being the school mate of Mrs. Himmler met\nwith her once a week and both ladies played Bach on a harmonia, on a miserable harmonia,\nin Feige's household. And this too...I mean non-political people, they didn't care about one\nthing or the other...only Bach. So Bach was right. And they played for 2, 3 hours on the\nharmonia, and departed but, of course, like some women do they chat a lot and all this, so we\ncould see that there was a possibility to influence Himmler and when we got really...and I\nmean we, that means my mother, of course...got cases where nothing would have. My\nmother called Mrs. Feige, and said, \"I have here a terrible case, you know, once a personal\nacquaintance of friends of mine. Although we know these are difficult ttmes and so on, what\ncan we do? Can you tell Mrs. Feige his name is so and so and so and so. (laugh) Can you\ndo something. Tell Mrs. Feige. She can tell her husband. We guarantee you this is\ncompletely justified and so on. In most cases, this worked. I mean these were not really\nprominent cases, but say this, but prominent people, let's say economics was enough to get\nkilled by the Nazis. In their book it was a crime of major proportions. But Himmler wanted\nto keep up apparently his image like a normal man also. And, of course, his wife probably\nhad a lot to do with this. She was probably nagging him and he conceded and then my\nmother got a call from the Himmler headquarters, Sicherheitshauptamt, that she was called to\npick up the visa for so and so. My mother has absolutely no fear. I mean she has nerves like\nsteel. She can sleep in the most trying circumstances, and she just went there. To go in there\nwas a very big favor alone you know. These SS guys, they knew that Himmler had\nsomething to do with my mother's coming, got up, saluted here, and so on. And my mother\nlooks like Mrs. zero. She does not arouse any interest. She was just about, if Himmler would\nlet in, let's say a Jewish woman who was alive but in his mind, but already dead. That's how\nmy mother looked. She looked completely nonentity. She got the visas. They saluted. My\nmother marched out. Case closed. You know, and that...I don't want to make propaganda for\nHimmler, but there is a side you probably would not have expected. Not everybody has\nconnections to the wife of a dictator, but if you do, there is a chance you get somewhere. So\nwe used to...I 1 mean some of the 20th of July people also got arrested and needed to get out,\nyou know. My mother got them out. Jewish people or professors and so on, you know. So\nMrs. [Heumner (ph)]...we got them out.",
        "A: Yah, Mrs. Feige, Mrs. Himmler, and Mr. Himmler finally. I mean it is unbelievable, I\nmean, to me, even today. I mean I wouldn't...you know being a youngster I might have gone\ninto the Reichssicherheitshauptamt, but anyone over 20 would not, because that was a place\nnot to be. For no reason. And that was that. I mean, you see it takes courage and the nerve\nto stay on your charted course. You know a dictators really dislike enemies, but they dislike\nenemies who waver, you know. And actually, if you are staying on your course, they are not\nsuspicious because you act like them almost. You see they don't waive, they don't give in on\nanything. And you appear as if you are ready to get what you came for and then they give\nyou a break. I think it's the similarity of format you know.",
        "A: Yah, by looking through my pictures, to my astonishment I see a picture which I have never\nseen. Somehow it, I thought it is a friend and former colleague of my father, Mr. actually\nAlbert Gunter. He called himself usually Albougie. (ph) It's a picture here in Szopot near\nDanzig, a resort, seaside resort, with his daughter and wife, a very elegant woman and a very\nsweet girl. But he was...he was, you know, as you can see, a typical family picture, at a\nsummer vacation at the Baltic Sea. Uh, this man had worked tn my uncle's office...in my\nuncle's factory as sales manager trainee, as has my father, who went out. They became\nfriends naturally and when this area became Polish again he went to Germany and joined a\ncompany in Stettin, which produced bakery ovens, bakery equipment, and that sort of stuff.\nMy father kept on and off, you know, contacts and so on. When we came to Berlin, moved to\nBerlin, he came visiting us, you know, sort of see how we are doing, and I think it was in 35\nor so, this picture is 36. He came in and I overheard the conversation, and he said, \"Carl,\nImagine! I got an order for I think it was 50 ovens for the concentration camp in\nOranienburg, near Berlin. What do you think? Do they expect that many prisoners?\" 50.\nThese were ovens to bake bread. At that time, it was who knows. It looks quite dim if they\nneed that much bread, they probably get so and so many people and so actually, the\nexistence of KZ concentration camp was known all over Germany by the way. That is\nsimply not true what Germans say now, in my opinion at least. I knew it the first day. Why\nshouldn't intellectual Germans know it the second day. No, it was better not to know. But\nthis man had some misgivings about this firm, was Kirst und Soehne, from the Sttetin, was\nprobably the fifth or so largest producer of ovens and so on. And, after awhile, Mr. Gunter\ncame visiting us again and they ordered even more, and he indicated that they are using these\novens to not bake bread, but to burn corpses. He was really shocked. I mean if you got news\nof that kind in Nazi Germany, you were really not much shocked you know. You knew they\ndid everything imaginable, mean to people. But he was shocked, and he slightly felt\nresponsible, I think, that he had lent his hand, maybe in the beginning, of course, not\nknowing what this was for. These ovens were regular baking ovens as far as I know. I mean I\nhave seen films...I have seen films actually with the firm's label on the door of these ovens\nand I don't think they were modified for this new type of application so. . but, of course,\nknowing it, that its use to it, possibly I mean, actually, I wouldn't have gone through with it. I\nwould have retired or something, but he went to apparently to the very last and, uh...in 44, he\ncalled on our home, apartment door. My mother was gone, my father was out of the city, and\nhe talked to me and this man broke completely down. He said, \"What have I done?\" I must\ntell you I was not a friend to him. You know he was much older and somehow, this man was\nSO nervous, So super nervous, he said. . what have...and he asked me...I was what...I was 20\nyears old...and I was so embittered to see a man before me that I said, \"Mr. Gunter, the only\nthing you can do...commit suicide. \" It was terrible for me to say it, but I knew everything.\nNot from him, but from...of course, you knew everything. And for me, having somebody\nbefore me, an intelligent German man, having done this did not say no, I mean, he probably\ncould have invented hundreds of reasons...so I was really...maybe it wouldn't have been my\nstyle...I said you have nothing else to do but commit suicide. By the way, he did. Not that I\nhave great power of persuasion, but he felt that's the only thing you can do. Things which\nhave been done, you lent your hand, your talent, you knew, at least along the line, that you\nactively supported, for me this was your death. It would have been my death. That's why I\nsimply had a very strong commitment not in any way support this system. It was my life\nreally because if they kill others, they kill you. Nobody has to get killed for political reasons.\nAnd I knew if I am in it, I kill myself. I don't kill other people. I kill myself. It's everywhere\nlike this. If you see reasons to kill, do it only then when you want to kill yourself. That is the\ncrummiest thing you can do. So later on, my mother lived in West Germany and low and\nbehold, she met Mrs. Gunter and her, by then, very pretty grownup daughter. I mean, she\ndidn't know about this visit, of course. I think he never returned to her. We didn't even know\nthat he committed suicide. Only when my mother met her in West Germany, she told us.",
        "A: Yah, Here, I just have had a Otto Nifert (ph). Actually was a Colonel during the Nazi time.\nPrior to that he was our neighbor. He lived in the apartment in Poland below us. He was a\nmember of parliament in Poland for the German minorities. They even had...but he was also\nknowingly...we found out later...that he was also a paid German Nazi agent. He received\nmoney. We found out through connections, something like 43. By that, he had already was\ndrafted into the army...and, uh, I mean during the upheaval occupation of Poland, he had\nbeen arrested by the Polish government. They found out about this later, secretly, but later\nwe found, he. . he survived all this...and established. . he was...had a repair business...a\nplumbing business...had big orders, and so was a very industrious man, but politically, he\nwas a Germany chauvinist as you ever seen one, you know. He had...was officer in first\nWorld War. He had this typical Prussian officer's attitude. Only me, no one else! So, but he\nwas a piano player, a very voracious man, and so, he became in Nazi Army, a Colonel, and\nthen rose up, up, and became the last Commandant of Danzig. He finally moved out with the\nevacuation ships, and landed in Bonn of all places, and established a new (laugh) a new\nplumbing business there, also successful and all that. There must be somebody who 1s re-\nestablishing these people. And, of course, his attitude toward Poles, Jews and so was that\nwhat you could expect, you know. But to know a person and you always think, all\nthese guys, they don't come back. They don't come back. But they do. As we see now in\nGermany, no objection to this. Here's another case. This man used to be my law professor at\nBerlin. I studied 2 semesters, 43, 42 and 43 at Berlin Law School because I wiggled out of\nthe army. I did some important work for the German armament industry, and they (laugh)...I\nhad to commit myself half a year to serve 1n the air. The equipment was such. . laboratory\nout of Berlin where everything the Germans had up their sleeve, was developed, evaluated\nand known. I sit right in the right place.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Uh, actually, through not direct contacts, but I had...I suspected that these people...they\ncouldn't tell me of course, that they would put it in the night hands. I mean I became aware of\nthe development of the V1, V2 weapons. This was, by the way, quite an open secret amongst\nthose who knew. The other things, the Colonel who became my super...I was in personnel...I\nhad a very low...but personnel is a very good position to know everybody. My superior was\nHauptmann Schwabel, it...was the guy from Nuremberg. Actually being a Bavarian, you\ncould think maybe he had some leanings to the Brown movement, but he was low and\nbehold an anti-Nazi as you could possibly get it you know. I came into the office and we sit\nthere like little choir boys who couldn't sing you know. Everybody was thinking, is that guy\nanti or for? And, of course, this was the decision. This man. . his family lived in Nuremberg.\nHe was alone. He couldn't talk to anyone. So I came in there, and sounded to me awfully\nuncomfortable, and then some remarks I did and so, and he covered__ and then I took the\nrisk, and became full fledged anti-Nazi and told him everything I heard over BBC and this\nman got so additive. Me telling him. He was there at 6:00 just not to miss me, you know.\nAnd we became like this. I could find out anything. He was waiting to betray his great\nFuhrer as best as he could, you know. And we had fun, you know. All these things were not\ndone in the style of...not with me like you see it in Hollywood... two serious men talking\nserious stuff only. We laughed our head off. Of course, this whole thing was a big joke once\nyou looked through this fakery and outsidish activity which was all fake, fake, fake. I mean\nyou could have a laugh of your time. You...1f 1t wouldn't have been for this killing and\nmurdering, I could have laughed Hitler off and he would have been out in the rubble of\nhistory, never to be remembered. But what he really established is the unchallenged position\nas a most mass murder ever. Nobody has ever single handedly...I mean on a single\norder...killed that many. And the dumbest in this whole game are the Germans themselves.\nAnd they still have not found out that they were the victims too, including the German Jews,\nincluding Jews everywhere, including everyone who was just not a German, you know. I\nmean...but the Germans paid dearly and willingly. For what reason? Only stupidly! The\nmost intelligent people on earth are also the dumbest and why? Social organization pits one\nGerman against the other. Nothing has changed, in my opinion at least.\nHere's another wonderful German. He was a coach for law students. His name is uh, uh, uh,\nProfessor Reinhart | H\u00e9hn. \u00b0He was a coach in Jena. And he...",
        "A: Yah, he was mentioned here in this letter (coughing) as a conduct Himmler to him. I seem to\nknow all the people who uh have a way to get to Himmler. When I met this man, he was\nProfessor at Berlin Law School, Berlin University. He had become party member at 32, and\n(cough) got the attention of Himmler through some unspecified contacts. And Himmler was\nlooking for somebody to establish a special...a special section in the\nReichssicherheitshauptamt [NB: the RSHA], in his headquarter, to establish an index to all\npersons who were suspect of being anti-Nazis abroad and inside Germany, or presenting a\ndanger to the Nazi system. Of course, without saying, Jews were in it automatically. All of\nthe Jews. And Hohn was a man who developed...which finally ended up into something like\n50 million index files where all Jews in the world, all anti-Nazis, all socialist, all union\nmembers, all modern artists which did not present the ideas of art of the Fuhrer, or\nanything...Anyone who ever came to the attention of the authorities. By the way, the German\nforeign service was instrumental in this. For instance, getting the names and addresses of\nJews in America. Unfortunately, unwilling, at least there was a couple of Jewish foreign\nservice officers in the German foreign service who were advised to get address lists from\nsynagogues. They went to their synagogues. Got the addresses there. But other Germans,\nthey posed as Jews from Germany, (cough) obtained freely address material and send them\non to Berlin. You see, otherwise it wouldn't have been possible for the Germans to know\nwhere Jews lived. Coming to Italy, coming to France, coming to Estonia, so...It was not\nalways (cough) German agents who knew where to knock. The Germans knew before they\ncame there where to knock. Telephone number, whatever. And this was this man's work.\nAnd actually, he couldn't do it along. He is the man who hired Eichmann. And I think\n\u00b0 See Raul Hilberg.\nnobody knows who hired him. Eichmann...was but us know (ph) (laughing). Eichmann was\nrecommended to him, you know, for being a diligent worker. And this Eichmann, of course,\nhelped; and probably he was...I never met Eichmann. Although I must say, my rowing boat\nclub, student club, was located next to Eichmann's office in Kleinerwannsee...Actually, next\nto it was Hohn's office. His university institute for state law he ran. Also,a fake the fact this\nfaculty did not really exist, but Hitler appointed Hohn a professor because he wanted Hohn\nas SS man. And he became finally SS General. Uh, and uh Himmler's personal counselor, if\nhe nedeed one. But this Institute was on the Kleinerwansee, on a bridge. The next house was\na longish, brownish bungalow type--but very large. Nobody knew who lived there. But I\npersonally saw these SS men with these long coats. I mean, they looked like murderers; and\nyou couldn't have any doubt they were monsters, as persons, even. You know, nobody talked\nto them or even looked at them. People...And next to it was the club house for, you know,\ngymnasium students. It was an association, this club house existed since 50 years or so. So\nwe went there rowing; and so you saw these...Made your heart stop, you know, just seeing\nthem so. An obvious brutality, you know, as they walked or so.",
        "A: Oh, this was reported by a very famous German journalist. Let's see. Yah, there is a\ndocumentation on that. I didn't see it. But the President of the German Pen Club, I know him\npersonally, also. I worked with the British information service after the war. And he was...he\nhad fled to Britain, and became our security chief. I discussed what's his name... He is very\nfamous, he has written about...had documentation on it, because of his British position. He\nhad really easy access, and uh I think it is not disputed. It has been uh reported many times,\nbut what really happened to Professor Hohn--being a big shot in the Himmler\nhierarchy...One aspect of this index was also to record Nazis who had embezzled money,\nwho had misbehaved, sexual offense, and so. And Hohn inserted this due to his office\nanyone who was a danger. But you know, the old cronies of Hitler were in this index, too.\nAnd it backfired to them. And many of these cronies went to Hitler directly--because they\nworked with Hitler on a personal basis in the pre-Hitler days--and complained that \"What 1s\nthis man doing? Is he trying to stamp out us old Nazis? We helped you. Remember it.\" And\nHitler got really angry. Hitler was not attached so much to this man. Himmler was. But not. .\nHit[ler]. So Hohn got removed from this position, and who ran it was Eichmann himself. But\nHimmler pressed and pressed to get Hohn back. And Hitler then, how I think the...the idea\nwas to appoint a SS man as a professor. Because as a professor, he could spy on the general\nprofessors in Germany who [had] the reputation not to follow necessarily so willingly a Nazi\nRegime. But Hitler gave in and appointed him, this Hohn, as a law professor. They created a\nnew faculty, state law faculty. Actually, the whole idea was to prove to the public that the\nFuhrer system is actually legitimate form of government, you know. This was...but he\ngot...when the started and the Germans invaded Poland, he was...this Professor Hohn was\nvery much involved in Germanizing Poland. And doing this, I, of course, became a student. I\nwanted to know everything this man had on his mind. Unfortunately, everything...the most\nterrible thing which could be thought of was his recommendation. A minimum sentence for\nany offense was death. I wonder (laughing) what more severe punishments would be. It was\ncompletely crazy, you know. So uh I had a girlfriend, and she had enlisted to become a\ndoctor. And her doctor father was this. She was not a Nazi. She was not a Nazi; but as usual,\na student in Germany, once you were to make a doctor, the university more or less prescribes\nto you who should be supervising your work. And that was she. She became a assistant\nunder Hohn. They usually used the doctorins as secretaries, more or less. You know, they\nlook over the doctoral dissertation and only with was one eye. But it's even done today. I\nmean, students in Germany have complained since 200 years about this. But so did Hohn.\nAnd she told me a few things what he was appointed Professor at two universities, Krakow\nand Poznan, in the occupied zones of Poland. And he actually gave training courses to Nazi\nofficials and SS, how to really clean up Poland. Actually, he helped in the formation of the\nPolish penal code--which was a German code, extra for Poles. They were not under German\nlaw, but under SS law. I mean, people who stole, blow head off, you know, and so. And uh\nhe was contacted by ethnic German doctor from Chomutov, which is actually in\nCzechoslovakia. \u2018And he is of German descent. And he writes here in this letter, \"Dear\nDoctor Hohn, since I know that you have close relationships with Reichsfuhrer SS Himmler,\nI want to present you the following. \" And he refers to an article which was written in a\nmedical journal--the possibility of sterilizing men forever by medical injection. It's a sad\nmoment, planned and so forth. And there is uh uh the contact, and don't let anyone see it;\nbecause you know bureaucratic ways, things get lost and so.\" But this too important, you\nknow. And he suggested (ph) prisoners of war in German and practically everyone they\ndon't like, but would liked to have work for them but not propagate, so that they don't\nendanger the German stock. I mean, a very nice proposition. And apparently Himmler got\nthis. Hohn said, \"I never forwarded it.\" But it is signed off by \"HH,\" which means Heinrich\nHimmler. And here the letter part, it suggested that test injections should be given to\nprisoners; and Himmler had actually had written here, in his own hand, writing \"Dachau. ns\nThat means the tests should be done in Dachau, which 1s...This man I thought had not\nsurvived the war, but he did. He is now...at least, if he is still alive, he's probably 81 or so. He\nrose to a very prominent position in German economic. He could not be a professor, because\na German students went on protest for it. But a German industry collected money,\nestablished a management research institute. In Bad Harzburg, he bought all hotels 1n this\nresort town; and even American firms sent their managers for the Harzburg model teaching\ndone by Himmler's deputy. Impossible! When I heard this, I phoned him and I said, \"Are you\nDoctor Reinhard Hohn? Were you professor 1n '43-'44?\" \"Yes. Yes. Yes.\" And I just hung\nup. I knew I had my man. Besides, the German embassy sent me informational material of\nthat institute with a picture of the director, Dr. Hohn. I know he has a big... on the left check,\na big, blue mark still in this picture. I knew it had to be him. And knowing this, I wrote a\n\u2019 Located in the Sudetenland. German name: Komotau.\n* Further details of this episode are given in Hilberg, The Destruction of the European Jews, vol.\nIll, pp. 940-941.\nvery calm article for a Washington paper and so forth. And as soon as this appeared, I lost\nmy White House career. German Embassy...",
        "A: Yah, in this case here, I got pretty... am a Democrat. I got along with the Carter\nAdministration. He went to Poland; and I, on my own money, joined him to go to Poland.\nBecause I knew that this document existed. I conferred with the Polish War Crime\nCommissioner, Mr. Chaplinsky. They knew it all. They produced this document. Now,\nGerman generals: \"Oh, we knew that document long ago. \" But I have never seen it before.",
        "A: No. Something was done about me.",
        "A: No, but it was repeated. They actually said...the State Department released a memorandum\nwhich has no author, but enormous delivery schedule--at least 10 different agencies. First, I\nam mentally impaired somehow. I murdered somewhere, sometimes, a State Department\nofficial. I am a person who 1s really a terrorist, because I was in the Danish Resistance\nMovement, you know. Our real objective was to blow up the railroad train tracks. The\nDanish government said in Denmark, and the orders were given from England, to...I mean,\nthe Danish government said in England...It was recognized even by the German as a\ndirecting party. They had promised not to do anything against Germany. They said, \"We are\ncompletely occupied. All we can do sort of undercover action to stop these supplies to\nNorway.\" So trains had to be blown up, and that was a major objective. But coming\nback...So this was viewed as a dangerous article I wrote, and I think I will give you this\narticle. I wrote in the Jewish Week. Phillip Hockstein, a friend of mine. I had written a lot of\narticles. When I came back, he refused to do it, too, you know. I don't know what's so\ndifficult. I finally, really, blackmailed him somehow. I am a very charming blackmailer.\nThey finally wrote this article; and the reaction was practically zero. Although, I attended the\nfunction at the Kennedy Center with the Queen of Denmark. Kissinger was there, was\nactually the maid of honor, herding people around the Queen and so. But finally he lost\ninterest in this, and this Queen (laughing) was standing there all by herself. And she accepted\n(laughing) me like I was a foreign minister of the United States. Which I will never be, not\nafter this rumor. But people sort of noticed me, and then I heard people talking about my\narticle. I know you are a famous journalist then when you went go to a outhouse on a farm\nand they have newspaper for toilet paper, and when you find that one article of yours appears\non that piece of toilet paper. Then you are really famous.",
        "A: It is fun. Actually, it 1s fun. It was fun then, because you could do what you believed in. And\nit was useful for others. And telling it now is fun too, because nobody knows about it.\nPHOTOGRAPHS\n[NB: There was conversation regarding taking of pictures but I didn't think it was needed for\npurposes of this tape except perhaps for the following]",
        "A: This is Hal Autonebed. He had a plumbing business in Bydgoszcz, and he was representative\nof the German minority in this district same, the Polish parliament. And he also cooperated\nas an agent of the Secret Service of Germany.\n"
