I\nremember him very well because I used to go to him with my mother, my parents'\npictures.

        "Q: Uhu.",
        "A: And being in Russia after the warfirst of all, we gotabout two, three years after we\nwere liberated and then we find somebody who made a picture of my sister based on this\none. So we have it at home, a big picture. That's what I can't tell about this picture and\nwhat her story. She was a very bright girl. She spoke English, she was planning to study\nmedicine somewhere overseasoverseas in the West, not in Poland. She had a lot of\nfriends. She helped us a lot from '41 to '43. She worked; life was very difficult. And\nafter our ghetto was liquidated, we were hiding immediately, and she was walking in the\ncity, in the camp. It was not a concentration camp per se but it was a working camp.\nJews and Poles work there. You ask me why she was there? She could have escaped\nwith us but she was trying to retrieve some things for us to be able to continue hiding and\nliving, etcetera. Me and my mother and my sister were hiding at that time inby Poles,\noutside the city, and I used to go to visit her. I remember I visited her twice or three\ntimes. She couldn't visit us. And when I visit her the next time, I don'tthe third or the\nfourth one, she wasn't there, and I remember I was surrounded by Polish girls and Jewish\ngirls. And I said, \"Where is Esther?\" And they saidthey didn't tell me that she was taken\naway, of course, and killed probably immediately there. Said, \"She went to another place\nto work.\" And then I asked, \"Can I come tomorrow and see her?\" And I remember they\ntold me, \"No. If she come back, she'll come and visit you.\" Of course, in retrospect this\nwas a preludium. It was painful for them, and I was beginning to cry\n+ something.",

We knew thatwe didn't knowI couldn't\nunderstand that they would know what the Germans are doing; they would probably run\nto Russia, from one part. For the other part, we were welloff, and the Russians sent many\nto Siberia. My auntmy aunt from Gleenyana (ph) they were owners of a factory so they\nwereher husband was arrested, and my aunt and her daughter Arella was taken to Siberia.\nUnfortunately for them, they didn't survive thereno, unfortunately for them, they survived\nbut they came back in '41. They came back because my parents, many people around\nspoke about them very highly, positively, and they wrote to the Russian government that\nthey were not for Bourgeois who exploit other people. Can you imagine that? In '41,\nthey letshe came back, and her husband came out from the jail because of intervention.\nCouldn't understand how thisand of course he very, very happy when she came back but\nin two months laterin two or three months later the GermanRussian war started. If they\nwould stay there, maybe they would survive. Maybe he wouldher husband, Mosha,\nwould have gone to see them, but those + she came back,\nunfortunately, for them. In '41, my father was killed, and my two uncles were killed, in\nNovember. The Germans came to our town in July.",

We were very naive,\nnaive people, thought everything would + but around 3:00 o'clock\nI was trying to run to see them butthe streets were empty and around 3:00, 4:00 o'clock\nthey began to take groups to the woods in our city, Snutwasfada (ph). It was a very\nbeautiful place. But the shooting was already going on, we can hear this. And around\n5:00 or 6:00 o'clock, women were cryingRoma, Romasand I remember that I wasI gottold\nmy parents and my sister that I'm going toto the place of them, and I went. As a child, I\nwell remember I hadI had the Aryan look at that time, and two or three people more went\nto this place. It was already night. The Ukrainian police and the Germansmostly\nUkrainianwere they went to the city to eat, to drink, and then they came back to bury\nthem. Not they, probably, it was But then I went to the woodsI went close to the place\nwhere they were shot, and I remember that there were some cries of probably many\npeople who were wounded, and I was scared and I run back, and I told the story to my\nparents, to other people there. So other peoplesomemostly, of course, Romathey\nfollowed, they run to this place, and they didn't came back. They were shot also there. So\nI was lucky that didn'tso this was but prior to this my father +, My\nuncles were taken to jobs to work.",

        "Q: And how were you treated by the nonJewish kids?",
        "A: Not so friendly. Not soyou see, they saw what had been done to Jews so everything\ncame out from this. Of course, I played with them, played soccer, but they don't invited\nus to their homes, nothing. In the beginning. Later, two, three years later when we\ngrowwhen the senior class, a little bit closer, but you felt some coolness. Because the\nbiggest mistake was that we didn't left immediately for Poland. And now I will tell you\nwhy. When the Russians liberated us we became sol thought I'm a human being, I\nthought I'm a normal person. Some of our people, even my aunt, she left forrun away\nbecause her sons were taken to the Russian Army. And those who had people in the age\nyou could be taken to the Army, they run away to Poland. This was officiallylegally, we\nhave to apply for permit to go to Poland, which my mother did. I remember she filled out\nsome papers. And the post office wasn't working so well but I don'tand we were told that\nwe should send this to Schworchoff (ph). We send it, to get the permit to return to\nPoland. Because at that time we knew already that this would be a Russian Ukraine and\nPoland would be Poland. Of course, we feel more comfortable in Poland. But we never\ngot the reply, never. But my mother could have tried to go without some papers, which\nwasshe was scared probably. And then some rumors came that in Poland, their pogroms,\nwhich was through, and so my mother called up, said, Herethere are no pogroms here\nbecause the Russians are here. And this was whenbut then we went to school and I don't\nknowwe were happy with the minimum that we have. But if we would go to Polandfirst\nof all, life in Poland for Jews was much better. I'm sorry. And from Poland, as we\nlearned later, we could be trying to go to Czechoslovakia, to Vienna, to Israel, because\nRussia was close. Poland wasand besides, the Poles closed their eyes when Jews left also\nfrom Poland. My aunt, with her two sons, left for Poland in order for them to avoid the\nArmy. In Poland, they were + because they were of\ndraft age. So they left for Czechoslovakia, and from there to Germany. I don't know if it\nyou know the story, that this wasprobably the Israelis arranged those things for them, I\ndon't know. But they left Poland after one year of being in Poland.

At that time the Russians, they werebut I\nremember I learned to prepare +, Later, I learned to\nprepare, how to prepare materials to the Court. +\nprepared the material we have to send to the Court. And I liked it. Besides, I didn'tl\nwouldn't feel so comfortable if I would do it for a Jewish prisoner, but for them\n+ said, I hate him. As a revenge butand + in\norder to be accepted you have five exams, and I did them in. But I fromyou need 45\nbowelsis (ph). You aretheoretically, you are accepted. I remember I had 24I hador 23.

And the other student who went\nwith me, Ukrainian, he got +. For me, to go was\nexpensive. And I say, Could you look if I'm in the list there? I will sure that I will look\nthere. He came back and he said, No, you're not there. And, How about you? And he said,\nI am. I said, How come? I had better grades than you. He said, You're not there. I said,\nCouldn't be. The next day Mommie gave me money, I bought a ticket with a bus. It was\na few ruble, but for me it was aand I went to university, and I don't find\nmyself in the students, in the group who was accepted. I went down to the official, and I\nsaid, How come I'm not in the list? What's your name? And I said, My name shitle.\nYou're not in the list of the university. Why I'm not there? Come back in a half an hour,\nor an hour, I don't remember now, I'll tell you. I come back, shitle, you are accepted to\nthe German department. Look there.

And\nthen I remember something: Oh, of course, of course, you are Jewish. But thank God that\nthey accepted you there, because they didn't accept many at all\nthey're not obliged to accept everybody who\napplies, and they are not obliged to accept everybody who passed exams.

        "A: Oh, yes. In Stretchen there are a lot of Jews at that time. But many Jews, they're\nleaving for Israel. We couldn't leave immediately.

May, June, July, maybe August, September, I can'tand we walk to Chemerenchi\nprobably two, three days. We were afraid to walk through the street; we walked through\nthe woods. My mother knowat night, I remember we could make it shorter but we saw\npeasants. The peasants at night havethey used to take out their horses to feed them, and\nthey wereso we were afraid to cross them. So my mother find other ways.

Was\na very risky thing but shewe never . Of course at that time, didn't think those\nterms. And as soon as she left us, we hear, Hello, hello?

Because this wasthe woods was just close\nto the village. And my mother came back, and I was scared very much. I\nthought maybe that somebody picked up my mother, took her maybe, who knows.

So sometimes, you know, very often my mother went to and bought some food,\nsome potatoes, some bread. I remember one very unpleasant thing where my mother went\nout and she came back. The dogsshe was bitten by dogs, her legs veryblood and this and\nthis. But she brought food.

And later the next day we\nfind out that there was a Jew hunting on the other part of the wood and they catched a\nfew Jews.

        "A: Not so friendly. Not soyou see, they saw what had been done to Jews so everything\ncame out from this. Of course, I played with them, played soccer, but they don't invited\nus to their homes, nothing. In the beginning. Later, two, three years later when we\ngrowwhen the senior class, a little bit closer, but you felt some coolness. Because the\nbiggest mistake was that we didn't left immediately for Poland. And now I will tell you\nwhy. When the Russians liberated us we became sol thought I'm a human being, I\nthought I'm a normal person. Some of our people, even my aunt, she left forrun away\nbecause her sons were taken to the Russian Army. And those who had people in the age\nyou could be taken to the Army, they run away to Poland. This was officiallylegally, we\nhave to apply for permit to go to Poland, which my mother did. I remember she filled out\nsome papers. And the post office wasn't working so well but I don'tand we were told that\nwe should send this to Schworchoff (ph). We send it, to get the permit to return to\nPoland. Because at that time we knew already that this would be a Russian Ukraine and\nPoland would be Poland. Of course, we feel more comfortable in Poland. But we never\ngot the reply, never. But my mother could have tried to go without some papers, which\nwasshe was scared probably. And then some rumors came that in Poland, their pogroms,\nwhich was through, and so my mother called up, said, Herethere are no pogroms here\nbecause the Russians are here. And this was whenbut then we went to school and I don't\nknowwe were happy with the minimum that we have. But if we would go to Polandfirst\nof all, life in Poland for Jews was much better. I'm sorry. And from Poland, as we\nlearned later, we could be trying to go to Czechoslovakia, to Vienna, to Israel, because\nRussia was close. Poland wasand besides, the Poles closed their eyes when Jews left also\nfrom Poland. My aunt, with her two sons, left for Poland in order for them to avoid the\nArmy. In Poland, they were + because they were of\ndraft age. So they left for Czechoslovakia, and from there to Germany. I don't know if it\nyou know the story, that this wasprobably the Israelis arranged those things for them, I\ndon't know. But they left Poland after one year of being in Poland. It was a pogrom in\nKrakow, too, so Poland was also not the best place to be. But compared to Russia, was a\nwonderful place. And we lived in Russia until '57.",
        "A: Rebuilding my life, I graduate from high school, applied to law school in Lewolf (ph).\nI was not accepted to law school. I worked a year in a law office in my town because I\nwas interested in law. Not based on some readings about it but, you know, inside I felt so\nmuch hate and I was thinking maybe I'll be able . I liked law but\nin school, I gotI wasn't accepted. The next year I applied for it again. I had worked one\nyear in a law office, in the District Attorney office, and I did some good job for there, I\nthink. I wasDistrict Attorney was .

As a revenge butand + in\norder to be accepted you have five exams, and I did them in. But I fromyou need 45\nbowelsis (ph). You aretheoretically, you are accepted. I remember I had 24I hador 23. I\nhad to be excellent. In Russia, when you are accepted they don't inform you. They send\nout, the university, a list of students who are accepted. And the other student who went\nwith me, Ukrainian, he got +. For me, to go was\nexpensive. And I say, Could you look if I'm in the list there? I will sure that I will look\nthere. He came back and he said, No, you're not there. And, How about you? And he said,\nI am. I said, How come? I had better grades than you. He said, You're not there. I said,\nCouldn't be. The next day Mommie gave me money, I bought a ticket with a bus. It was\na few ruble, but for me it was aand I went to university, and I don't find\nmyself in the students, in the group who was accepted. I went down to the official, and I\nsaid, How come I'm not in the list? What's your name? And I said, My name shitle.\nYou're not in the list of the university. Why I'm not there? Come back in a half an hour,\nor an hour, I don't remember now, I'll tell you. I come back, shitle, you are accepted to\nthe German department. Look there. I went and looked philology department, German,\nEnglish, Frenchin French and German. It was the Russian department was philology.\nAnd I'm there. And then I came in and I said, I didn't apply there. I say, It's a mistake.\nAnd he said, No, it's not a mistake. You know there are not many places there so that we\nsomethis. It didn't occur to me immediatelyno, I already felt antiSemitism there. And\nthen I remember something: Oh, of course, of course, you are Jewish. But thank God that\nthey accepted you there, because they didn't accept many at all\nthey're not obliged to accept everybody who\napplies, and they are not obliged to accept everybody who passed exams. Of course, if\nyoua similar story happened with my sister Ida. She applied later to Lewolf (ph)\nUniversity, in the department of journalism. Smart girl. She got 44 bowels (ph) and in\nthe last bowel of German they gave her a3. She was rejected, and she wasn't even\naccepted to another . This wasof course, this wasshe ;\nThen she applied for Moscow, and in Moscow she was accepted. She was very smart.\nAnd when she took the grades, the guy in law said, Oh, it'syou have such good grades\nand the last grade was unfortunately for you. She didn't say anything. And in Moscow\nshe was accepted andbut she came home and she has to work, we cannot make a living\nwith my mother. And she worked in the newspaper.",

        "A: Veryvery uncomfortable. But I wasn't the only Jew. There was six Jews of us. Only\ntwo of them applied for German, because one was a daughter of a Russian officer who\nwas in Germany. The other was something. Me and somewe were outsiders. I didn't\nfeel comfortable. Can you imagine? But in history department I feel much better.\nBut then when I was there I noted that there are no Jews there in the university.

This what she couldn't achieve in this, ; they\naccepted her immediately and they saidand soand so she studied there, she got\nscholarship. Life was much better in Poland. I mean, economically better. And beside,\nthree other newspapers, Jewish newspapers, there was some contact with the west. You\ncan write to somebody, if you have somebody.",
        "A: Oh, yes. In Stretchen there are a lot of Jews at that time. But many Jews, they're\nleaving for Israel. We couldn't leave immediately. The Polish were\nthere for 10, 15 yearsnot all of themwere difficult. They leftsome of them left for Israel;\ntherefore, we got their apartments.
