        "A: Okay. My family\u2019s name is Weil, W-e-1-1, which is a very common Jewish name\nin Alsace, where -- in -- where I grew up. My fam -- my immediate family consisted\nof my father, my mother, my paternal grandmother and my brother, who\u2019s 13 months\nyounger than I am. My parents came all from rural -- from villages. Ba -- And I was\nborn in a little village outside of Strasbourg, right -- very tiny community of farmers.\nBut it had a synagogue 1n the days I was born, because I remember as a little girl\ngoing to visit the Hassan there [indecipherable] because he had -- his wife had a little\ngrocery store and -- and that\u2019s all I remember, I was three years old and we moved to\nthe city. My parents had --",
        "Q: Which -- which city?",
        "A: Strasbourg.",
        "Q: Oh, I see, okay.",
        "A: Strasbourg. I grew up in Strasbourg for all practical purposes because I don\u2019t\nremember anything from before I was three years old. My father had a very unusual\nprofession for a Jew. His father had been a butcher. They -- usually the Jewish\nbutcher was also the butcher for the other population. In other words, he served the\nwhole community. Of course, the Jews ate the kosher parts and so on. I had never\nknown my grandfather because he died of some gangrene he had of his leg -- he had\na leg amputated, because I\u2019m told that he had diabetes, but I -- I really never knew\nhim. And my father had only one sister, who died when she was probably about 18 or\nso, of complication of probably appendicitis, which know how to treat. But her\nname was Margaret. So, my middle name is Margaret. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m Simone Margaret.\nAnd also Heb-Hebrew name would mean Esther, so I\u2019m Esther too, in my Hebrew\nname. The interesting thing is, is that I\u2019d always thought that I was named Simone\nbecause it\u2019s a real French name and Alsace had just returned to France in 1918. My\nparents were married in 1919 and I was born in 1920. And then I found out when --\nmore recently I\u2019ve been studying genealogy and I have the genealogy of the Weils all\nthe way back to way before the French revolution, I have investigated that. And I\nfound out that -- lost my train of thought --",
        "Q: You were talking about your name.",
        "A: My na -- yeah, that there was between my father and Margaret, a boy named\nSimon who died as an infant. I mean, which was very common in those day. So was I\nnamed after some -- I had never heard of him until we dug up that genealogy. So that",
        "Q: This was one of your uncles?",
        "A: No, no, my fa -- my father\u2019s -- my father\u2019s br -- well, it would have been an uncle",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: would have been an uncle, but he died as an infant. Never knew him, ne-never\nheard of him. He was just was important to talk  1t\u2019s neither here nor there, but it\nwas just interesting, was I named because of a Francophile sentiment or was I named\nbecause there was a Simon that died as an infant. So, that\u2019s it. My father did not -- at\nfirst -- I don\u2019t think my father had more than a sixth grade education. They were a\nvery poor family in the village and he used to help his father in -- in the butcher shop,\nbut he eventually developed an interest in sheep and sheep raising and sheep\nbreeding and for the meat and for the and developed a big, big business. He\nbecame the most important sheep breeder in the east of France and although we lived\nin the city, he had these herds of sheep, I guess that\u2019s what they are, in the various\nplaces where he went and then he supervised all this -- this big business. I had very\nlittle interest in that. My mother also had very little education, although probably\nmore than my father.",
        "Q: And her name?",
        "A: Jeanne.",
        "Q: How do you spell that?",
        "A: J-e-a-n-n-e, which would be pronounced Jean, I guess, here. She was the oldest of\neight children. I knew my -- mat-maternal grandparents quite well, because from the\nearliest age on, even before I was a year old, I would spend a lot of time with my\ngrandparent. And with all the unmarried uncles and sister -- uncle and aunts, because\nI was the first grandchild -- and little by little, the siblings -- my mother\u2019s siblings got\nmarried and I -- but I always went to my grandparents. I must have been eight years\nold, when both of them died, at -- at the very close interval. They were _ they lived in\nthe village, called Mummenheim, which -- which today is almost a suburb of\nStrasbourg, but in those days was a trip to go there. And I spent a lot of time there.\nThere were a very rigid, stern family. But my grandmother was sweet and kind and\nshe taught me a lot of songs and little girls ditties, you know, that kind of things. And\nI -- remember her very fondly. But my mother being the oldest of eight sibling and\nprobably better off than the others, she became, over all the years that I have known\nher, the family caretaker. She was -- our house was always Grand Central Station and\nher brothers and sisters would always come",
        "Q: And what was their profession, your mother\u2019s parents?",
        "A: My grandfather, well, had a little grocery store with his brother. He also was a\npeddler and he carried his ware to another little grocery store across the Lake and\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s what he did. Nobody on my mother\u2019s side either had -- nobody went\nthrough high school.",
        "Q: Now, when you say he was a peddler, just -- did he peddle things house to house,\nor just to another store?",
        "A: Gee, I really don\u2019t know. I know I seen him with his thing on his back and maybe\nhe went -- there was a store in Mummenheim with his brother -- his brother Neftilly,\nwho was deported during the war and hi-his -- they had another store in Wagdenheim\nand I don\u2019t know whether he just schlepped it over there or whether he -- whether he\npeddled. I -- I really don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Let me interrupt one second, I forgot to -- had to put a special slate at the\nbeginning of the interview and I will read that now. The United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. This is an interview with Mrs.\nSimone Weil-Lipman, conducted by Steve Roland, on August fourth, 1998, in her\nvideotaped interview conducted with Mrs. Lipman on July third, 1990.

        "A: I\u2019m reacting to the fact that\u2019s already eight years. Can\u2019t believe it.",
        "Q: Does it seem like that?",
        "A:No,no,no .",
        "Q: You know, one thing that -- that you mentioned during lunch 1s that -- that there\nwere things that you read in the transcription of the interview, that you -- that\nsurprised you.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Does anything particular come to mind?",
        "A: N -- Only the one thing that was really not correct that somehow in my -- although\nI think my English is pretty good, so once in awhile I express myself a little\nawkwardly and I think something didn\u2019t quite come across. You see, when the war\nstarted, I was li -- I was 19 years old, but the year before, really, we -- Munich was\nhappening and we were very worried, because Strasbourg is the most exposed city.\nAnd so my parents asked me to take my grandmother away from Strasbourg and in\ntranscript -- in -- I -- I read that I took my -- I went to safety with my grandmother\nand the interpretation was that I went to be safe with my grandmother. What really\nhappened is that I took responsibility for my grandmother and I took a train and I\nwent to some kind of resort, to wait until things were settling down in -- in the whole\nworld situation and then brought my grandmother back to Strassber -- the following\nyear, when the war really was going to get started, same thing happened. I was away,\nmy father brought me back home. This is end of August, 1939 and again I took my\ngrandmother, we took a train. We went to the center of France where we stayed in a\nhotel and I took my grandmother to safety, I didn\u2019t go to safety with my\ngrandmother. So, this is one of the things that, as I say, I took responsibility for my\ngrandmother and we waited out [indecipherable]. And so this is one of the detail that\nare -- other things, they don\u2019t come to my mind right now. [indecipherable] clarifying\n[indecipherable].",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So that\u2019s the information I can gi-give you about my parents.",
        "Q: Tell me -- tell me a little bit about -- about your fe -- your family, in regard to the -\n- the climate in the house, about the way things were done in the house, about the\nreligion, about the ethics.",
        "A: Well, we were very observant family. My mother came, obviously, from a very\nobservant family. Both my parents came, but my mother -- of the two -- of my\nparents, my mother was the more knowledgeable. She -- really amazingly, for a\nwoman in those days, could understand the prayer book, could understand the\nBiblical text. My father could read -- with a lot of mistakes -- he could lead a service\neven, but he made lot of mistakes, because he didn\u2019t have the intellectual stuff that\ngoes with it. He had just learned it by rote and by heart and so on. But the climate\nwas one of observance. Judaism was certainly central to our lives. There was not an\nintellectual climate. There was not a interest in music, in books. My parents read, but\nprobably -- well, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d call them har -- here. Romantic stuff that -",
        "Q: What -- what language did you speak at home?",
        "A: Oh, at -- at home we spoke Alsatian, which 1s a dialect, based on German and my\nmother spoke French, obviously I spoke French and went to French school and in my\nteenage, rebellious years, I pretended I couldn\u2019t understand anything but French,\nwhich my father didn\u2019t speak. Don\u2019t forget, that Alsace moved back and forth\nbetween France and Germany, which meant that my grandmother, who lived with us,\nwas born in the French period, to -- became German in 1871, when France lost the\nPrussian war. So both my parents were born under a German regime and went to\nGerman schools. Spoke German fluently. In 1918, France reverted to fran -- Al-\nAlsace reverted to France. Now, my mother came from a very Francophile,\nsomewhat more educated family and all the daughters were sent to Paris, at least for\nsome time, to be with an aunt, whom I know -- whom I knew too, and there they\nperfected their French. So my mother spoke and wrote perfect French. No spelling\nmistake, no nothing, she didn\u2019t -- but she also could do it in German. My father --\nwhose business was with the peasants, the farmers, the -- the rural community, never\nbothered to learn French. So he could understand somewhat. So as I said, in my\nrebellious teenage years, when he and I collided, I couldn\u2019t understand Alsatian. I\nshould like to add something that -- very pa -- I don\u2019t know how interesting it is to\nthis particular interview, but Alsatian Jews speak not -- sp-speak what is called in\nFrench, le Judeo Alsatian, or in their own parlance, they call it Yiddish dige. It\u2019s not\nYiddish, because God forbid an Alsatian Jew should speak Yiddish. The Alsatian\nJews look down on eastern European Jews, whom they all called Polacks, that\u2019s --\nwas the n-nomination, so just like the German Jews in this country look down on the\nimmigrants that came after them from the eastern European countries. Exactly the\nsame situation. My father is probably turning around 1n his grave, as I have\ndiscovered that this Judeo Alsatian, which they spoke, is really similar to Yiddish.\nIt\u2019s not -- does not have -- it\u2019s -- doesn\u2019t have a written language, it doesn\u2019t have a\nliterature. It was just a spoken language -- 1s dying out, but it\u2019s being retrieved and I\nhappen -- I -- where as when I grew up, I thought of it as very crude and very\ncommon and I walked two miles behind my parents when they spoke it. Today, I\u2019m\nvery interested in it and I have read a number of books. There -- I find out there 1s -- I\nhave been communicating with people who are studying it and there is very few of us\nwho still ha-have a feel for it. It\u2019s a very rich language, very different from Yiddish\nin it\u2019s pronunciation and it\u2019s formation of words, and is very much tied into Hebrew,\nwhich also intrigues me very much. So, this is how that beca --",
        "Q: Can -- can you give us a short example of how it sounds?",
        "A: Yes, I can give you one that I always use when people ask me. In Germany you\nsay, \u201cEashe harbor gie gessen.\u201d I have eaten. In Yiddish, you say, \u201cAy chobe\ngessen.\u201d In Alsatian, you say, \u201cShop gessa.\u201d In Yiddish dige, le Judeo Alsatian,\n\u201cIshap ger archult.\u201d I don\u2019t if you know Hebrew, but ochell in Hebrew is to eat. So\nthey -- they use the Hebrew word, they conjugate it in germaway and they say, Ishap.\nThe big difference, eehope and ishap, that\u2019s the big different. Ishap ger archult and\nthat\u2019s the way my father would speak, using Hebrew words, conjugating them and\ndistorting them, so that in order to trace back what it really means, you really have to\ndo a little research. And it\u2019s -- has intrigued enough people. There 1s a chair of Judeo\nAlsatian [indecipherable] at the university now. And it\u2019s a non-Jewish person who is\nstudying it. So it\u2019s interesting [indecipherable]. But anyway, this is what we spoke at\nhome. And coming back to this, the atmosphere, you know, my parents had no social\nlife. They didn\u2019t go out, they didn\u2019t travel. My vacations were -- m-my grandparents\nhouse, maybe at an aunt, my -- once -- one aunt got married and lived in another\nvillage and she married a -- a cattle peddler. J-Jews were a lot of cattle peddlers or\nbecame merchants and grain merchants, cattle merchants and that kind of thing. So I\nwent -- I went to spend some vacation with them. The only time my -- I remember\ntaking a vacation was my mother and we went to Luxembourg in a Jewish hotel, was\nthat -- there was an epidemic of polio and my mother took us there for several weeks.\nIs --",
        "Q: For what -- for what reason?",
        "A: Because there was an epidemic of polio -- to be away from Strasbourg and to go\nsomewhere where it wouldn\u2019t affect us. Because in these days, you went into an iron\nlung and all this kind of thing. So twice I remember going there. But what really\nbecame my -- well, even before I go to that, let me say, my -- the focus of my life\nwas school. For two reasons. One -- number one, I was interested. But number two,\nhad a brother who\u2019s 13 months younger and my father made no bones about the fact\nhe would have liked to have a boy first or maybe even two boys and no girl, because\nhe needed one for the busine -- he needed two boys for the business. And I was an\nonly -- only a girl. But I was very interested in school and did very well in school. So\nthis mar -- the teachers and -- and I also went very unusually so for those days, I also\nwent to what you\u2019d call here, Hebrew school and got a very solid Jewish education.\nAn education which I continue throughout the years so that I\u2019m familiar and\ncomfortable with the Hebrew -- of the service and I\u2019m comfortable with the Biblical\ntext and I have continued studying. And so my goodies came not so much from my\nparents as it came from teachers and rabbis and educators. And also, when I was 12\nyears old, my parents permitted me to join the Jewish girl scout -- German -- and that\nreally became the center of my life. Now, I\u2019m not unique in this. Of course, it took\neven more importance, because my parents, when -- couldn\u2019t give me the -- the\ncultural stuff that they didn\u2019t have. I mean, they -- they -- they -- they were not\neducated to -- to have this and so I got -- I got very involved and a total commitment\nto the Jewish girl scouts. Not the --when I -- when I say girl scout -- and the\nequivalent, I mean there is no comparison to the scouting movement today in the\nUnited Sta -- don\u2019t know what it was like 50 years ago, but that was a -- a total\ncommitment to service, to -- to -- I\u2019m -- I -- to Jewish learning. There was a boy\u2019s\nmovement and a girl\u2019s movement. I -- now, in back -- in looking back on it, I must\nhave been an organizers from very early on, because by the time I was 13, I was\nalready one of the leaders. You know, the movement at that time, unlike in the\nUnited State, no parent involvement. It was -- we called it leading through youth. We\ndidn\u2019t have any parent involvement. So we got leadership training and we got all\nkinds of stuff. I took these kids hiking in the mountains every Sunday, or practically\nevery Sunday and we roughed it up, we went camping, we dig out trenches. We kept\nkosher at camp and we -- we cooked on -- we didn\u2019t have any of the equipments that\nyou have today, we really roughed it out. But it was and it 1s an indi -- 1t -- we have a\n-- still today, we -- we have a bound, a -- a tie between us that 1s the s-something that\nis difficult to describe. And the Jewish youth movement became a very active\nmovement in the resistance in France during the war and then eventually after the\nwar, some of them found a kibbutzim in Israel. And I am still not in correspondence,\nbecause [indecipherable] because our -- our what we call the commissaire, the -- the\nbig leader over the whole region there, there\u2019s a man who is now in his 90\u2019s, he is\ndeaf, he is blind, and -- but I\u2019m -- I still get news from him or about him. And all to\nrees --",
        "Q: Where does he live?",
        "A: In Israel.",
        "Q: In Israel.",
        "A: And he founded a kibbutz there and his wife is still living.",
        "Q: What\u2019s his name?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: His name?",
        "A: Well, his real name is now Shimon Hamel, but in -- oh, this -- this 1s going to ex --\nask for a lot of explanation. We call him Shamu. Shamu in French means camel. But\nit also means somebody who\u2019s very rough. And he was a very tough leader. If you\ntake the Jewish encyclopedia, and I have it in there, the library there and you look\nunder scouting and you\u2019ll find his name there in quotation mark and his wife is a\nvery busy lady, so we called her Fumi, which in French means ants. We all had\nnames like that which we called [indecipherable]. But it creates a tru -- an -- you\nknow, I\u2019ve often wondered -- you know, people have asked me, in this country, what\nmade you do what you did during the war? And, although I have really no answer to\nit and I have read books and I\u2019ve tried -- people have been pondering, why did some\npeople become rescuers and why did some stand by? And actually participated here,\nat University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in a workshop led by somebody from\nGermany and -- on rescue and resistance. And I also have connected in the last few\nyears, with some of my co-workers in the camps and in the underground and we\npondered this, too, because we [indecipherable] ask, why did you did what you do --\ndid? And the only answer that everybody [indecipherable], we ha -- there was a job\nto be done and we did it. Now, why did we do it and not somebody el -- the -- I have\nbeen pondering and I really don\u2019t know, except that maybe in this deep involvement\nin this youth movement, I took on a sense of responsibility and caring and duty, sort\nof. And more recently I have been thinking about it and my mother, who was not an\neducated woman, but sh -- and she was a very gentle and rather passive woman, yet,\nshe was a caretaker. She took care of all her siblings. Or -- and of not only siblings,\nof -- of relatives in need and that kind of thing. And of her mother-in-law, who didn\u2019t\ngive her an easy time either, but she was there and I\u2019m wondering whether I\nunconsciously, you know, had some -- some model there. Be -- and my father, who\nwas really a -- a very -- man with a very high temper and really a tyrant, but\nnevertheless, he let my mother do all this helping. In other words, he opened his\npocketbook and there was never any problem. So I wasn\u2019t a deprived child in a sense\nof physical [indecipherable] thing. We lived simply, not luxuriously, but I didn\u2019t\nhave this -- I -- I really got my goodies from the scouting movement.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And from my teachers, rabbis, etcetera.",
        "Q: Well, ec -- explain one thing to me. In growing up in the Jewish community here,\nin this country, I\u2019m used to families in which the parents are very involved in kind of\nlaying out a path for the children. And particularly with regard to education. Ver-\nVery keen on pushing children through education and setting up things. And from\nwhat you\u2019re telling me, 1t seems to me that for you particularly and maybe for your --\nyour friends, that thi -- that -- that your interest in education and in the scouting\nmovement and in -- and even in promoting Judaism, w-was more self motivated. Is --\nis that correct?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, th-th -- your statement is correct except for one thing 1s that is this is\ntrue uniquely for me. Has nothing to do with my generation. It\u2019s my family, my\nfriends. And -- in -- in the Lycee, which I attended -- in the Lycee which I attended, I\nhad friends who were of different religions. I had the daughter of a minister. I had a -\n- | had Jewish friends and their parents had this kind of -- in fact the -- the -- one of\nmy girlfriend\u2019s mothers was a writer of children\u2019s book.

        "A: Well, as you -- as I told you just now, you have to look at different levels. When I\nwas in the village with my grandparents, where I spend, as I said, all my summers\nuntil I was 10 - 11 and had outgrown that and I was with the girl scouts at camp. I\nwent camping with them at the south of France and all over the [indecipherable].",
        "Q: There\u2019s that -- there\u2019s -- just let -- for the record, there\u2019s construction taking place\nnext door.",
        "A: There are three houses being built right now. We lucked out. The -- I -- there was\nstill a perceived fear of anti-Semitism in the village. I never experienced this in the\ncity. And what I remember very well is, on Christmas eve, my grandparents would\nclose all the shutters of the house. They -- just up -- they lived in the street called Rue\nde les gliese, Church Street. Which means the church was right -- just at the end of\nthe street there, and there was this fear -- I\u2019m sure they had never experienced this\npersonally, but maybe it came down through the family history that coming out from\nthe midnight mass, there would be some -- something happening to Jews. And so\nthey closed the shutters on -- [indecipherable] they probably closed them other\nnights, too. But there was a fear there.",
        "Q: These are your mother\u2019s or father\u2019s parents?",
        "A: My -- my mother, you know, my -- my -- my mothers. My maternal grandparents,\nbecause my paternal grandmother lived with us and my grandfather had died. And\nalso, I remember in the village, as a little girl -- and I played with little kids there --\nwhether they were Jewish kids or not, I don\u2019t remember. But I remember hearing\nsome little -- what would you call it, little -- oh, nasty things, like, you know, what\nyou -- some derogatory statements. I remember it very well. If you want to hear it\nenunciation, I can tell it to you.",
        "Q: Yes. I think --",
        "A: Yout -- yout chasit dout. And I don\u2019t remember the rest of it. J-Jew -- Jew, shit\ninto the bag -- and then I don\u2019t remember. Anyway, there was a derogatory kind of\nthing. But I don\u2019t remember it bothering me, so -- but their relationship with non-\nJews was perfectly good, there in the village. I remember in Passover, spending\nPassover with my grandparents and since they were very observant and I went\nliterally across the street to the farm with a -- with a pottery container and they would\nmilk the cow directly into that. And was very acceptable that Jews at this time of the\nyear, couldn\u2019t put the milk in another kind of vessel because of the Passover\nobservance. And so there was that. My father worked with non-Jews in the\ncountryside. I would ass -- and he -- he did business with non Jews all the time. As\nfor me, I -- of course my -- the -- the -- the center of my life was the family, the\nschool and -- and -- and religious school and this very active Jewish youth\nmovement. But I also -- I excelled in school. And --",
        "Q: Now, did you go to school with non-Jews, or only --",
        "A: Oh yes, sure, sure. Because my brother and I were so close in age, we started\nschool at the same time. Speak of psychology, my parents didn\u2019t quite have that kind\nof training. And lo and behold, how these unsophisticated parents managed to get me\nin an all boy\u2019s school, I don\u2019t know, but it saved them a trip to take me to an all girl\u2019s\nschool. So we started school at the same time. And I excelled in the boy\u2019s school.\nAnd because I wasn\u2019t a boy, I had to do better than the boys, and so -- and these were\n-- this was a -- a gr -- a Lycee, it was a public school, so it wasn\u2019t Jewish kids, it was\nkids of all -- of all faith and all [indecipherable]. And then, by the time I went into\nthird grade, then I was able to walk by myself and so I walked to a girl\u2019s school, a\nLycee -- I mean, a French school. And it\u2019s very interesting that wh-when I left there,\nthen my brother really -- he -- he became -- he blossomed more. But the thing --",
        "Q: What\u2019s his name?",
        "A: Hogere, Roger.",
        "Q: And how do you spell Hogere?",
        "A: Like Roger.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: My brother is dead. He died at age 55 in Israel, after losing his youngest son in the\nYom Kippur.",
        "Q: And how did your brother die?",
        "A: Heart attack.",
        "Q: Mm. Then his -- his -- your nephew was killed in a battle?",
        "A: He was killed in a battle in a Yom Kippur wawl in 1973. So, he had already had a\nheart attack before, so this is -- this did him in and he died, years later. So the rest of\nhis family is in Israel and that\u2019s -- and that\u2019s where my nephews and nieces and\ngreat-nephew [indecipherable] are and my sister-in-law and her family.",
        "Q: Do -- do you travel there often?",
        "A: N-Not often, but I\u2019ve been there a total of seven times already, so that\u2019s not too\nbad. And I\u2019m very close to that side of the family. But in the Lycee, I ex -- had,\npersonally, a very good relationship with my -- with students of all faith and I was in\nthis -- what should you call it? The [indecipherable] of the -- of the high school. We\ntook not only Latin and a foreign language and Greek and -- and math and\nphilosophy. You know, we -- there was a group of us and there were Protestant, there\nwere Catholic, there were Jews, we were all, there were -- I have pictures of us going\non outings together into the mountains or [indecipherable]. Had one limitation, is that\nwe kept kosher. So I certainly didn\u2019t go out with them to eat, you know, with this\ngroup. But I had them over to ha -- to my house and we made -- well I had my own\nroom, where I could entertain. This was very unfrequent. It was -- 1t was very unfreq\n-- | had a very good relationship with my -- teachers were all non-Jewish and I -- in\nmy -- in my leadership positions in the Jewish youth movement, I went to\ninternational camps and you know, f-from scoutings from all over the world. And so\nI really never experienced personally, any anti-Semitism or any friction in my\nrelationship with non-Jews.",
        "Q: Now that -- that -- to me, that\u2019s very important.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] that. I want to ask you be -- one other question. In this country, in\nthe Jewish community here, you have this extraordinary range of people\u2019s\nrelationship to Judaism and how observant or non-observant they are, now to Jews\nwho were not observant at all. In your youth -- and -- and you\u2019ve -- and you\u2019ve said\nseveral times that -- that you were fact -- very observant and your grandparents were\nobservant. Was there such a thing as Jews who were not observant?",
        "A: Oh yes, indef -- a -- that -- the -- lots of them. My closest Jewish friends were not\nobservant, did not come from observant families, did not go t -- the girls did not go to\nHebrew school, they did not have that education. It was something that came both\nfrom my family and from me personally. I\u2019ve always had that interest and I continue,\nhere today in Chapel Hill.",
        "Q: But those people consider themselves Jewish?",
        "A: Absolutely. But there was -- now, when I said we were observant, I\u2019m -- you\nknow, I hate the word Orthodox. You use the word Orthodox today because you\nhave to separate Conservative, Reform, Orthodox. There was no such a thing in\nFrance. It was traditional Judaism. It -- Orthodox only had to define itself with the\nrise of the -- of Reform and then the Conservative movement. So it was traditional\nJudaism. And to label ourselves Orthodox, I don\u2019t want you to feel that we wearing\nblack coats or anything like that. We were perfectly modern Jews. And so is my\nfamily in Israel today. They are very observant Jews and except for the boys wearing\nthe knitted kippah, th-they are of this world, you know? So I -- I don\u2019t like the label\nOrthodox. But sure, my friends -- my friends didn\u2019t have that education, you know, I\n-- | -- ina way my family was -- it -- and interestingly enough, my cousins, who --\nwe have the same grandparents, practically none of my cousin have remained even\nJewish. They have all intermarried. Practically all of them. Or if they haven\u2019t\nintermarried, their kids have intermarried.",
        "Q: And these are cousins who live where?",
        "A: Some in Strasbourg and some in the village in -- in -- in -- 1n -- in where my\ngrandparents lived in s -- [indecipherable] in the village Sovalza, so in Strasbourg,\nthese cousins -- now, I must say, there are -- the next cousin -- I was the oldest of all\nthe cousins, because my mother is the oldest of all of them. And there is eight of us.\nMy brother, m-myself are the oldest and then there is eight years until the next\ncousin. And she didn\u2019t marry a Jew. The children are -- have retained no tie to\nJudaism. Of the whole family of cousins, there is only my brother who went to --\nmade alia to Israel and his whole family has remained very committed to Judaism.\nMyself here and my family -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m all children and grandchildren who are --\nhave remained very ha -- observant -- very -- I should say Jewishly committed. And\namongst my cousins, the-there is one -- there is two who have remained -- no-not the\ncousins, the children of the cousins, there is only two that have remained Jewishly\ncommitted. All the other -- the children are completely -- have left Judaism, totally.\nSo that answers your question. You\u2019ll have to go to see my schoolmates or others and\neven in the family, it\u2019s been, the commitment has been -- there was something unique\nin my family, I don\u2019t know what it was, but both my brother and I got that\nsomewhere. They were never -- now, to say something on their behalf 1s, their\nfamilies were never quite as committed as we were to Juda -- although they were, on\nthe surface, observant. I mean, they didn\u2019t travel on Shabbat and they did -- they ate\nkosher. Everybody had a kosher upbringing, no question about it. They didn\u2019t -- they\nwere younger and so the war hit them at a different stage of their lives. They also --\nthey a -- it also hit them in -- in very personal kinds of way. Two of them lost their\nparents -- four of them lost their parents. And -- during the war and so it affected\nthem in many different ways. So I had wa -- this advantage of eight years before the\nwar, which they didn\u2019t have. They were little kids, they were -- so --",
        "Q: Well, this is -- there\u2019s so many directions --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- that I feel that we could talk now, but le -- I was going to ask you about this\nlater, but let me ask you now. D-Do you find with -- with these --",
        "A: Did I fi --",
        "Q: Do you find with these relatives that you are saying, who have become less\nreligious and -- and have intermarried, that the war affected their belief in God?",
        "A: It affected them very deeply, whether it\u2019s their belief in God or whether there is\ntheir attachment to Judaism. I haven\u2019t discussed to believe in God with them. But I\nknow it affected them very deeply. Can I give you one example?",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: I think my next oldest cousin is eight years younger than I and then she has a\nsister who 1s three years younger than I. They grew up at Strasbourg like I did, but\nit\u2019s interesting, I cannot remember our family getting together for holidays so very\nrarely [indecipherable]. My parents were very limited this way, socially. But I\nremember their coming and I -- I -- I remember going to their house and so on. They\nmust have gotten some kind of Jewish education somewhere, although I really cannot\nswear, but they must have gone to Talmator like we all did. You see sc -- in France,\nschool is as -- five days of school, but unlike here, where Saturday and Sunday are\noff, you have a day in the middle of the week that\u2019s off. You went to school s --\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, were off on Thursday and you went to school on --\non Friday and Saturday. Big dilemma for an observant girl. So what did I do? I went\nto school, but I didn\u2019t write. I attended -- this was the compromise, because there\nwere no day schools and I had to go to school. So I -- I t -- I sat through classes\nwithout writing. So you distinguish between the Jews who wrote and Jews who\ndidn\u2019t write on Shabbat. This was the big thing. And I was one of the few who didn\u2019t\nwrite. But on Thursday, on Sunday, we went to Hebrew school. And whether my\ncousins stayed or not, I don\u2019t remember. But what happened 1s, when the war started,\nthere were obviously -- I was 19, so one of them was 11 and the other one was nine.\nThey lived in the south of France and the father -- they lost their mother to cancer\nvery early on during the war. And their father worked with the Jewish agency, you\nknow, the -- there was an official Jewish agency functioning in France -- in the --",
        "Q: Now just so I\u2019m clear, their -- their mother was your mother\u2019s younger sister?",
        "A: One of them -- one of my mother\u2019s sisters, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, okay.",
        "A: And she -- she died of natural causes and the father put them 1n a -- into a\nboarding school while he was working for the Jewish agency. There was a -- an\nofficial Jewish agency that was responsible to the [indecipherable] forces, but -- and\nmy uncle worked for them. He had been a civil servant in Strasbourg, some -- some\nvery low government pencil pusher kind of job. I -- I don\u2019t know exactly what he did.\nAnd he was killed in that position because they took the whole office as hostages --\nas hostage and he was killed. At that time I was working in the underground and my -\n- I think I talk about this in my -- in my oral history. And the head of our network\ncame to Chatahou where I was functioning and told me that Mr. So and So had been\nkilled and we better go and rescue the daughters. Well, he didn\u2019t know it was my\nuncle and I indeed got my two cousins out of the boarding school. They have\nrecently told me that they didn\u2019t know whether it was a trap or whether it was really\nme that had called them. And they only told me this about 10 years ago.",
        "Q: And wh-where do they live now?",
        "A: In France. [indecipherable] me get back to that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So they both survived because I placed them in a safe place. I remember exactly\nhow we changed the name and all that, that\u2019s not relevant. And the war was over,\nthey were left without any parents, deeply affected by what happened to their parents.\nAnd in addition, the young one of the two got TB and so she had to be isolated in\nsome treatment kind of -- an-and they lived with my very bitter uncles and aunts to --\nwho never married. And to escape, they went into 180 degree turn and not only with\nmy oldest cousin -- I mean, the older of the two cousins, become a professor of\nGerman. Yes, it\u2019s really incredible, she studied German. She became a Communist.\nShe married a non-Jew in the same kind of political orientation.",
        "Q: French?",
        "A: French. He became a very -- they -- they -- they dropped their Communism in --\nvery soon in ba -- but they have remained very Socialist oriented, very Leftist kind of\nthing. And he achieved a very, very high position in the French government , in -- an\nincredibly important position. But --",
        "Q: Do you want to mention what it 1s, or no?",
        "A: I'd rather not.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And he -- they -- the -- he\u2019s not Jewish and she\u2019s severed all her relationship to\nfamily. This is how she\u2019s been af -- to -- to the -- to the -- the extended family, she\nreally severed all her relationship.",
        "Q: How -- and how-- how s -- how much severed? I mean, you don\u2019t speak to her\nany more?",
        "A: Oh, I do. But th-the uncles and aunts, she s-separated her -- I mean I was in the\ncou -- in this country, you know, so I -- she didn\u2019t sever herself from me. After the\nwar, I -- I still was in touch with her, but she married this non-Jew and she cut herself\noff from the fam -- from -- there were uncles and aunts and my parents. She just\nseparated herself [indecipherable].",
        "Q: For what reason? I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not sure if I understand.",
        "A: Well, she didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with Judaism. My family was the\ntraditional Jew -- my family and -- I mean, extended family, that the ones that were\nleft represented. They also represented the war, they represented the loss of her\nfather, of her mother. They -- they represented -- I have never asked her what made\nher do all these things, but I see a -- a complete lose -- wanting to loosen herself up\nfrom the things Jewish, totally. And I\u2019ve stayed with her and I\u2019ve talked with her for\na long time, but that\u2019s something else [Il talk to you about you later. I -- I really have\nhad ver -- little relationship with my family in France and it\u2019s only in recent years\nthat I have -- well, recent -- not quite -- not -- maybe the last 20 years or so that I\nhave really intensively reconnected and with a great deal of pleasure. But so, when\nyou say, did they lose their belief in God? I don\u2019t know what belief they lost, bu -- la\n-- they certainly lost their -- any belief in -- in things Jewish. Her sister married a\nJewish man eventually. Somebody much older than herself and sh -- he died of\nParkinson\u2019s disease very young, and she -- and she also last -- lost all contact -- she\nha -- c-continued the contact with the family, but Judaism she completely put aside.\nAnd her son married a non-Jewish person and her ch -- grandchildren are not Jewish.\nInteresting enough, now that she\u2019s retired -- and she became a social worker -- now\nthat she\u2019s retired, she has, in a very -- how shall I say? Intellectual, secular way,\nreconnected to -- to things Jewish. She studies and she\u2019s interest in groups. Not for\nobservers -- observance as much as for unders -- of -- of thinking, you know,\n[indecipherable]. My other two -- I mean and I -- air -- I can go down the line, I have\nsix cousins like that and their ties to Judaism have loosened a great deal. And if they\nhaven\u2019t, I have two male cousins and they have married Jewish girls, but their own\nchildren, except for one, are -- no longer have any tie with -- but you know, I don\u2019t\nknow whether the effect of the war, or whatever it 1s, but whatever I have read about\nstatistics 1s that they -- this is very typical of the Jewish population in France. So,\nwhether the war had -- o-of the old Jewish population, now there is an influx of\nobservance brought in by the Sephardic Jews from North Africa.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So I -- I don\u2019t know if I answer your question, why my brother and I remained\nvery committed Jews, I don\u2019t know, except that probably it has more to do with the\nintensity with -- and maybe also my mother brought a great deal of knowledge to\nwhat we were doing. Because I was always an inquisitive kind of kid, I\u2019d say. When\nmy mother said, \u201cYou can\u2019t do this,\u201d or \u201cyou can\u2019t do that.\u201d P\u2019'd say, \u201cWhy?\u201d And if\nshe couldn\u2019t the answer, I would go to the rabbi. And it was very funny. Last -- last\nFriday night we had some friends here who -- from -- dear old friends from\nCleveland, who came through here and something came up at Kiddush time and I --\nthis -- this friend of mine, gen -- this is an American friend, said, \u201cWill you tell me\nwhy some women put -- make such s -- gestures, some incantation kinds of gestures\nbefore you light the candle?\u201d And I knew the answer, you know, because the whys\ngo back, early on.",

        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: I always ask my mother what --",
        "Q: So what is the answer?",
        "A: Oh, you want to know?",
        "Q: Yeah, sure.",
        "A: When -- in Judaism, you always say a blessing before you do something. So,\nbefore you drink wine, you say a blessing. Before you eat bread, you say a blessing.\nWhen you light the candles, you do the thing first, because -- and then you do the\nblessing, right? Right? This is the [indecipherable], because you cannot do the\nblessing and then light the candle, because it would be Shabbat already and you\ncannot -- and you cannot do -- light the candles on Shabbat. So you use a little\nfiction. You light the candle first, you close your eyes, you haven\u2019t seen the flame\nyet. You say the blessing and lo and behold, here is the flame. All you have to do is\nclose your eye. But, I think it has become like a -- a -- I don\u2019t know what. My mother\ndidn\u2019t do that, she just closed her eyes and said the blessing. But in eastern European\ntradition, it has become putting a shawl over your head and closing your eyes and\ndoing a -- which I don\u2019t do, because I understand why it\u2019s -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a very literal\ngirl.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So, going back to early child -- to my early years, I\u2019ve always wanted to know.\nAnd I guess this is a personal kind of thing and I -- my cousin may not have had that.\nBut whatever reason it 1s, they have cut themself off from -- from things Jewish. I\nhave another cousin and -- and I -- I love them dearly and we get along very well.",
        "Q: H-How does it affect you personally, to see this -- these -- these elements in the\nJewish population?",
        "A: In -- in general?",
        "Q: Yeah. And -- and within your family also.",
        "A: In my family here, in -- in [indecipherable] amongst my peers now, there 1s hardly\na grandparent who doesn\u2019t have a non-Jewish grandchild. It is -- it is the norm here.\nI\u2019m rather the exception, I should say. It makes me very sad. It makes me sad, but at\nthe same time, I feel the Jewish people\u2019s going to survive. I mean, there has been --\nthe only worry I have is that the other Orthodox are going to make it survive and I --\nthis is not where -- that\u2019s not where my heart is and that\u2019s not where my beliefs is, for\nav -- a variety of reasons, whi --",

But I was searching and of course, when I came here as a student, I had\ndiscovered Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism, all kinds of formulas which -\n- which I was not familiar. And don\u2019t forget, I had had five years of war -- of really\nliving as a Catholic as well and cut off -- although I do remember even living as a\nCatholic, we had a very clandestine seder and -- and a -- and all kinds of -- I have\nnever really been away from Judaism, even when I was living as a Catholic. And as\nsoon as the war was over, I was back into a | -- being the head of a Jewish children\u2019s\nhome and instilling a love of Judaism and teaching and training the kids and so forth\nand so on. When I came to this country, I discovered this other formulas and I just\nobserved, I wasn\u2019t really becoming a part of any of this. And I got married in a\ntraditional Jewish ceremony in Strasbourg. My parents -- I -- small apartment,\nbecause after the war they had lost everything and they were sharing apartment with\nsomebody else, as a matter of fact. But we got married in a synagogue and came back\nhere and we joined a Conservative synagogue. Our home -- I did not keep a kosher\nhome, but kept a -- oh, a very traditional oriented ka -- ya -- obs -- nee -- at least\nobserving Friday night and attending services on and off. It was not a same\ncommitment that I had before, until about almost 50 years ago. Well, I'll be married\n50 years next year, so it\u2019s about 48 or 49 years ago. I heard a lecture by Rabbi\nMordecai Kaplan, the founder of Reconstructionism and he really expressed for me a\ndirection for me to go into. It was a very revealing kind of lecture. I still have the\nnotes that I took. He defined -- as you know, Reconstruction, it defines Judaism as a\ndynamic, religious civilization. God as the power that makes for salvation. And I\nbegan to read Rabbi Kaplan. I began to subscribe to Reconstructionist magazine. And\nit opened to me a whole m -- way of living my Judaism in a more creative and in a\nmore -- in a happier way. My childhood was full of don\u2019t, and it\u2019s a sin and all the\nforbidding kinds of thing. One of the strongest phrases that remains in my memory,\nis in Kaplan\u2019s writing, he talks about reading into the Torah, or reading out of it. And\nI grew up where everybody read into the Torah because -- this is repeated three times\nand this is -- were -- this is -- has a meaning and usually the meaning ended up in\nsome forbidden to do this and forbidden to do that, etcetera. [indecipherable] Rabbi\nKaplan talks about reading into the Torah, reading into the teaching of the Torah\nitself, the text itself. And doing things in a more creative ways. And so after that, this\nis -- this has been my -- my direction. And especially with our children. We -- we --\nthey all -- they all attended Conservative synagogues. They all went to Jewish camps.\nThey went to Camp Ramah, they went to --",
        "Q: What\u2019s it called, Camp what?",
        "A: Camp Ramah. These are the -- the camps of the Conservative movement.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. How do you spell that?",
        "A: R-a-m-a-h.",
        "Q: And where is it?",
        "A: Oh, they\u2019re all over.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: Happened to be -- this one happened to be in Canada, but -- and it\u2019s -- to this day -\n- to this day I am looking for ways to enhance Judaism in this world, by blending in\nwith all life here today. I don\u2019t know how to say it, but I\u2019m always looking for ways\nof making my Judaism more meaningful and more joyous, happy with -- with\ncreative things. So we were very fortunate because -- well, in c -- we first lived in\nCleveland, my husband and I. I -- I graduated from Western Reserve and my husband\nwas still attending school at Case. We settled in Cleveland after we got married,\nwhich 1s 1949 and I\u2019m -- my first job was as a director of a Jewish day nursery,\nwhich was Jewish day care center, affiliated with the Jewish [indecipherable] in\nCleveland, which was a top notch agency. And this is where, eventually, I got my\ntraining, also in child therapy. M-My degree is in social work. I had gotten my\ndegree at Western Reserve. But I specialized in early childhood, because in France I\nalready had a degree in early childhood, so I combined the two and I specialized in\nthat. And little by little, I developed my skills in -- in working for, or in behalf, or\nwith young children. And we joined a synagogue, a Conservative synagogue and I\nthink I have taken -- so have -- adult -- my husband, too, we have taken adult\neducation classes all our lives, in -- in the various synagogues and I learned more\nabout Reconstructionism. I\u2019ve -- I have -- I have read a great deal about this. In\nCleveland, we belonged to such a huge congregation, like 2,000 families, that 1t was\nvery difficult to form any meaningful relationships. And although -- I was working,\nraising kids and we had a real struggle when we first started here. I didn\u2019t have a\npenny to my name, my husband had not a penny to his name. We lived in two rooms\n-- not two room apartment, a -- a -- not two bedroom apartment, two room apartment,\nupstairs, raising a kid. We eventually got a house. It -- the financial struggle was --\nwas rough and after I had my first child, I stayed home for four years, although I\nworked part time on the side. But what I did was, I worked as a Sunday school\nteacher on Sundays, just to get away from the house and leave a child to daddy. And\nI taught second grade Sunday school, which I\u2019d never done before, but it provided\nme also with a tie to the Temple and that kind of thing. We left Cleveland at the time\nour oldest son was ready to be Bar Mitzvah and my husband was transferred to\nSyracuse. And had to join the existing Conservative synagogue there, because he had\nto be Bar Mitzvah -- I mean, that was his [indecipherable] and -- but we were very\nunhappy with the establishment synagogue, with -- with -- we -- 1t was so rote -- it\nwas so uncreative, but we went, you see? I -- we schlepped our kids there and we\nwent and we made no exception to this kind of thing, until we discovered that in the\nsuburb of Syracuse called Dewitt, they were creating a new Conservative\nsynagogue. We were younger in those days, although we were much older than the\ngeneral age of the congregation, we just -- I -- I have to tell you that story. I read\nabout this congregation, then I found out what time their Friday night service are and\nwe went with our kids on Friday night. And the rabbi, though very rigidly observant,\nnevertheless, he had a -- a way of teaching, a way of making the service interesting.\nBut he had passed mimeographed sheets with some special readings or discussion\npoint or whatever it was that Friday night and I was ecstatic about something.",
        "Q: What year was this, roughly?",
        "A: *66?",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: \u201866. And I was ecstatic about that. My son always tells me, \u201cMom was converted\nby a mimeographed sheet.\u201d Because I wanted -- I -- I -- I didn\u2019t want this road\nservice, this -- this dead service and I wanted something creative in there. And\n[indecipherable] we joined, because by then they -- you see, when we came first, I\ncouldn\u2019t join, because my son had to have his Bar Mitzvah and they -- they had just\ncreated -- they only had a fir -- kindergarten or a first grade in religious school. But\nthat was okay for our second son, because they are six years apart.",
        "Q: What -- what are their names, the boys?",
        "A: The -- the synagogue 1s called --",
        "Q: No, no, your children.",
        "A: Oh, the oldest is Peter and the second one is Robert.",
        "Q: And you have a daughter?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Just two boys?",
        "A: Two boys. They are six years apart. And among them they have five children.\nAnd the oldest has two girls and the second one has two girls and a boy.",
        "Q: And tell me the names.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: Tell me the names of the grandchildren.",
        "A: The grandchildren -- the older -- the -- the oldest -- Peter\u2019s daughters are Abigail\nand Rebecca and Robert\u2019s kid --",
        "Q: And ho-how old are they now?",
        "A: Abby is 11. She already has a Bat Mitzvah date for the year 2000.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Rebecca is eight and then in ro -- Robby has Elanna, who\u2019s going to be 11 in\nOctober. David, who is eight and Amy, who 1s f-five half. But anyway, we left the\nbig synagogue where our oldest son had been. He 1s a high achiever and so he had\nwon every prize in there and every scholarship and every da-da. He was the head of -\n- president of the class or whatever it was and it was a great big shock that we left.\nBut we were so happy at this new synagogue. They -- they were meeting and the\nlittle building and -- it -- it -- they were living on shoestring, but my husband\nvolunteered to work on an architectural search committee and before he knew it he\nwas the h-head of the building committee and before he knew it, he built a synagogue\nand I got involved with children, with the education committee, with the richman\ncommit -- education enrichment has always been my -- my thing.",
        "Q: Education enrichment?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Adult education particularly, but in those days also education, so I always\n[indecipherable] of education and then I -- I did everything, including dusting and\neverything in that syn -- it was our synagogue, it was our -- it -- it -- 1t was ours and\nthe -- the rabbi, a-as I said, he was bul -- in spite of his rigidity, but he was a teacher.\nHe enhanced the service with -- with things that were meaningful to us and we -- our\n-- our involvement with the congregation really blossomed during these 19 years we\nlived in Syracuse. And we miss it tremendously. But this has given my Judaism it\u2019s --\nwh-what it is today, this search for -- for meaningful ways of -- of -- of -- of living\nmy -- my Jewish life. Now, it\u2019s no longer the Judaism that my parents had. I\u2019m not\nlimited by the don\u2019ts of the Shabbat. I\u2019m not limited, I\u2019m -- I know there is one\ninconsistency with me, I don\u2019t keep kosher. And it\u2019s been a little struggle for me.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about it? Wh-Wh-Why did you make that decision?",
        "A: It -- originally it was my rebellion against the -- the things at home and I just have\nnever had the strength and courage to go back [indecipherable] was some -- it -- it\u2019s\nvery difficult to define my position, but it\u2019s just --",
        "Q: And how -- how does your husband feel about it?",
        "A: Oh he\u2019s -- he -- 1t\u2019s okay with -- he is by far not -- by far not -- doesn\u2019t have the\neducation that I\u2019ve had, because he grew up as a -- the only Jewish child in his\nGerman village. His brother was 10 years older than he was, he had left. He lost his\nfather when he was four. His mother was left a widow very young and he was the\nbaby child at home. His sister was married already.",
        "Q: What happened to his father?",
        "A: His father died when he was four. His brother had left, his sister had married, he\nwas alone, he was at school, he was victimized. Couldn\u2019t get a Jewish education. But\nhe has very emotional tie to his Judaism, but he doesn\u2019t have the -- what shall I say,\nthe -- the intellectual knowledge that goes with it, so he -- he d -- he doesn\u2019t have the\nfluency that I have. But we do things together and as a family. I mean, I never go to\nservices alone, we go together and we have made that commitment together and we\nhave taken classes together, but he certainly -- he doesn\u2019t have the Hebrew\nknowledge or the -- the knowledge that I -- that was given to me when I was a kid.\nSo, no, that\u2019s not as important to him. But we -- but he certainly was devoted and\ndedicated to that synagogue and we attended service on a totally regular basis and we\nwere -- we were -- this was our extended family. This was our -- we have no family\nin this country. I have no one. Now, my husband has a sister and he had a brother\nwho died. He\u2019s 10 years older than my husband, he died a few years ago. But the\nsister lives in New York, the brother never -- had [indecipherable] such a close\nrelationship and so for all practical purposes, we don\u2019t have family here. My children\ndon\u2019t have grandparents here -- don\u2019t have grandpare -- I mean, I took -- I took them\nto France to see my paren -- my parents were able to pay our trip, because we didn\u2019t\nhave a penny to our name. And so, between my brother and my parents, they send for\nus so they could meet the grandchildren.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Well, le-let me ask you a question. I\u2019m not sure if -- if this is really an\nanswerable question. But this evolution of your Judaism and your relationship to the\nreligion may have taken the course it took anyway, but can you identify or can you\ndiscuss at all how some of the experiences you had during the war might have\naffected this?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s re -- it\u2019s related to the experiences I had during the war. It\u2019s\nmuch more a personal journey and a -- and -- and a personal course, coming from --\nactually I was even more observant than my parents at one time during my teenage\nyears. You know, teenagers can go one way or the other. And I was, you know, I was\neven more observant than my parents and I -- I threw away the rigidity and -- so it\u2019s -\n- | -- I think it\u2019s more of a personal j-journey, a personal search to be as Jewish as my\nparents, but in a different kind of way. I don\u2019t believe it 1s related to the ho -- if\nanything, I was exposed during -- particularly during my camp experience, my early\non -- as you recall, I was a volunteer internee social worker in one of the camps.",
        "Q: In Rivesaltes?",
        "A: In Rivesaltes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I was very young. I ha-had no life experien -- I was 21 years old when I got\nthere. And here were adults, interned in a camp. They already -- some of them had\nalready been interned for a year by the time I got there. I met them. So I had lived in\nthese inhuman conditions, which I describe in my early interview. And there was a\nrabbi -- I remember vividly, there were teachers. There were very observant\n[indecipherable] they were non-observant people. But, from the people who\nremained committed to their Judaism in some way -- I remember holiday celebrations\nin the camp, or Shabbat celebration, that I remember having a very positive kind of\naffect on me, that these people, under the circumstance on which they live, they\nremained Jewish. And maybe so it had -- could have had a positive affect on me,\nrather than the opposite. And I -- as far as throwing away some of the -- the shackles\nof religion, I -- I was try to replace them by something more meaningful to me and\nmore positive. And I th -- and I\u2019m still doing it right now, every minute, thinking of\nmoving from one congregation to another, because a new one is being created right\nhere, in Chapel Hill. And there are young people and I don\u2019t even know if we\u2019ll\nbelong, because they haven\u2019t gelled yet. But they\u2019re searching for something\ncreative. They\u2019re searching for a service that is gender sensitive, which is very\nimportant to me. Because in Syracuse, too, when the -- when Conservative Judaism\nmade it permissible for women to be included and the minyan to be counted and to\nput this in the service, I -- I was at the head of that movement in my congregation. I\nwas the first woman to lead services in our congregation. And so I -- we are looking\ninto this new congregation and next Shabbat I\u2019m doing the service there, because\nthey don\u2019t have anybody. And I thought I would never do it again. But it is exciting\nto help a group of --",
        "Q: You thought you would never do what again?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: You thought you would never do what?",
        "A: Leading services, I -- I don\u2019t even have a voice to speak of, but it 1s nice to be able\nto provide some help of some people who are seeking to create their own thing and to\nlive their Judaism in -- in a way that is meaningful to them. And so _at first when\nthey -- when I showed an interest and I said, \u201cI want my -- I want something ready\nmade. At my age -- I\u2019m 78 years old, I\u2019m wa -- I don\u2019t want to create things any\nmore.\u201d And we\u2019ve attended their services and they were willing to -- to understand\nthings and to learn and particularly -- and I\u2019m very, very -- what\u2019s very important to\nme is that the services -- the Hebrew text, not just the English text -- be gender\nsensitive. [indecipherable] a big issue for me. Um -- a big issue, it\u2019s an important\nissue. And -- and also that service -- that we have time for meaningful discussion\nduring the service and that -- on the Torah reading, that kind of thing is important to\nme. And so here I am, still as excited at 78 as I was in earlier years as a girl scout, to\nfind ways of doing things at a camp. This has remained -- this has kept young in me\nand important to me. So, next Saturday, in that new congregation, I will participate.\nTh-This is not a program I had -- I can just stand up and do it, you know, I don\u2019t have\nto prepare, or read or anything, this has been part of me.",
        "Q: Right. And this is a Conservative congregation [indecipherable]",
        "A: Mm-hm. Ah, they don\u2019t know yet exactly what they\u2019re going --",
        "Q: They don\u2019t know?",
        "A: They -- they\u2019re si -- they\u2019re neutral as is -- [indecipherable] seek an identity, but I\nthink it\u2019s going in to a very liberal kind of Conservative Judaism.",
        "Q: There\u2019s a -- a few things I want to go back -- I mean, it has kind of an unusual\nshape, I think, of this interview [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes it 1s, I --",
        "Q: But I -- but I\u2019m enjoying it.",
        "A: Be-Because this is the last of the things that I would have expected to talk about.",
        "Q: But all of them are important and there are a few more things I want to ask you\nabout. Well, there\u2019s one question I want to ask you that -- which was -- we started to\nget to about before the war. And -- I think one of the most important things that you\nbrought up -- to me, anyway, was the question that you said you\u2019ve been asked many\ntimes, which 1s -- wh-why did you -- yourself and the others who -- who did what\nyou did, do it? And I think all of these things are related. I think that the relationship\nthat you had with your parents and the relationship that you had with your religion. I\nmean your relationship with the scouting movement.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: I think all of those things are part of it and I -- so I -- I don\u2019t think that \u2019'm going\nthe wrong direction by asking you these things. But one of the things that\u2019s really,\nreally difficult for me to understand -- I\u2019m 43 -- is to understand -- and I don\u2019t know\nif you can help me with this or not; wh-when I -- I asked you about the relationship\nbetween the Jews and the non-Jews in your city and you said ba-basically it wasn\u2019t --",
        "A: For me personally, I --",
        "Q: Was -- everybody got along pretty well?",
        "A: Oh, I heard about -- I heard about -- talk about the big word and -- we used in my\nfamily for anti-Semitism is called rischous. Now, I don\u2019t know the origin of that\nword, ec-except rusha means a bad guy. So rischous, maybe it come from -- I -- I\ndon\u2019t know, but this is the word that my family used in -- in Judeo Alsatian\n[indecipherable]. And I heard a lot about it and -- and my family had -- my parents\nknew about the affaire Dreyfuss and -- you know, the very famous anti-Semitic thing.\nAnd they had lived through that and they were exposed to that and -- and I heard\nabout it, but personally, I didn\u2019t read the newspapers, so I didn\u2019t know what was\ngoing on. I was so focused on -- on my school and on my activities and this was not\nthe -- the youth of today dating and going out on Saturda --",
        "Q: But -- but -- well, I -- I gue -- the thing that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- seems impossible\nfor me to comprehend 1s, what was the progression in the pre-war and the early years\nof the war, in your understanding of what was exactly taking place and why it was\ntaking place?",
        "A: You know, I think when you\u2019re faced with a matter of life and death -- and it was\na matter of survival, you don\u2019t think about why the things are happening, you are --\nyou\u2019re doing something to survive and you see people as -- either you\u2019re helping or\naga -- or they\u2019re against you, you know, and I -- there was the people in the\nResistance, the people who helped you with the papers, the people who help you with\nthe thing and the others. And that\u2019s the way it was. So you worked with those who\nhelped and you tried to defend yourself against the others. You didn\u2019t think why did\nhe and why did she do tha --",
        "Q: That\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking you. What I\u2019m a -- what I\u2019m asking you is even a\nharder question to answer, I think, which is what was your perception about why the\nJews were being singled out and rounded up and -- and put in camps?",
        "A: You know, I lived on the border of Germany. You had to just cross the Rhine and\nyou were in Germany. I could spit across if -- if the Rhine was too wide. Never\n[indecipherable] there on th -- never went into Germany. But part of my background\nis this his-historical thing that Jews were always persecuted. And this 1s what\nHolocaust Museum is showing us. And th-this is why -- actually, I don\u2019t want to lose\nmy train of thought, but I\u2019m rebelling against this a little bit, at this stage of my life. I\nfeel that we need to teach people -- and our children, particularly, the achievement of\nthe Jews, before we talk about the persecutions. And that\u2019s why -- we talked early, at\nwhat age do you tell a child about the Holocaust? Well, that child has to be grounded\nin what Jews -- what Judaism is all about and what they have achieved, before you\ntell them about all the persecutions through the centuries and particularly the last one.\nSo, but that\u2019s a different kind of thing.",

        "A: Well, I -- on that I have some specific thoughts, because I\u2019ve been very much\ninvolved in that. And I -- indeed, coming back to your earlier question, I lived -- I\nlived next door to Germany, so what was happening in Germany, from the late 20\u2019s\non, from the rise of Hitler, it was part of my growing up years. I remember April --\nwas it April first, 1933, when we had a -- a solemn service in our synagogue in\nStrasbourg, because -- exactly what the date was that Hitler was starting the\nNuremberg laws or whatever it was. I mean the restrictions on Jew and Hitler being\ninstalled. And we began to have lot of Jewish refugees come into the city and all of\nthat. So, it was not happening overnight. It was something that -- although I thought\nit would never happen in France -- French people don\u2019t do things like that. My\nparents probably thought differently, bu -- although they took absolutely no presh --\nmeasures to protect themself from anything. My father, confident in his status of a\nloyal French citizen, n -- continued his business to the last day, never put a penny\naside, never -- never did anything. But I grew up with the awareness that indeed, it\ncan happen to the Jews. And I know the history of the Jew. So, it just was one -- it\njust crossed the Rhine. It just came gradually. So \u201833 -- this is \u201839, six years, it came\ngradually. And then after that, it was just fighting for your survival, you know, it just\n-- and fighting for the survival of others, for some of us who got involved in that.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did tho -- how there -- there\u2019s one -- I want you to clarify something for\nme, because I didn\u2019t quite understand it in your -- your interview, about the camp in -\n- how do you pronounce it? Rivesaltes?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: That -- this was a -- this was a camp for foreign Jews who had immigrated to\nFrance?",
        "A: In France there were many Jews who had come from eastern Europe, many.\nBecause France was very -- always been very easy -- France was always a country\nfor refugees. The literature is full of the refugees who came from fra -- the White\nRussians, the -- you know? For ev -- all countries. And from the French colonies and\nso on. But mostly there were lots -- lots of Jews from eastern Europe who came. It\u2019s\nvery easy to get into France. That\u2019s never been a problem. But to become a citizen,\nthat\u2019s the pro -- and even if you\u2019re born in France, at least in those days -- I don\u2019t\nknow what the law is today, it\u2019s changed over the years, but I don\u2019t know what it is\ntoday. You were not a citizen, being born in France. If your parents had not acquired\ncitizenship, you were a foreign Jew. So as soon as the war started, the authorities --\nno, nos -- no, not as -- when the war started, as soon as France lost the war and was\noccupied by Germany, they rounded up all the Jews who had not French citizenship.\nNow, that includes people like my sister-in-law, who was born in France, of Polish\nparents. She and her entire family were in Rivesaltes, because her parents had not\nacquired citizenship. She spoke French. She was born in France. Her par -- her father\nwas deported as forced labor, whatever that meant. He may have been sent to\nAuschwitz directly, we don\u2019t know. Her brother joined the French underground. He\nescaped the camp, he went into French underground. He was killed in the French\nunderground, on that [indecipherable]. He was born in France. The mother survived\nand she and her younger brother survived, because we placed them with ame -- ame -\n- in hiding and my sister-in-law was placed with my family. That\u2019s how she came to\nmarry my brother. And -- but she was foreign born. Who were the other forei -- who\nwere the other foreign Jews? There were the Jews from the Rhineland, in Germany.\nThere\u2019s the whole -- the -- the whole Jewery that lived along the Rhine, which were\nin -- in -- in earlier days very prominent Jewish communities. They were all deported\nto France. Is this the only westward deportation in the history of World War Two. All\nthe deportations were east. The Jews from Rhineland were deported into the south of\nFrance and promptly picked up by the French whatever -- police or militia or\nwhatever and put into these camps.",
        "Q: How many camps were there?",
        "A: There were -- I don\u2019t know, between 12 - 15 camps.",
        "Q: And how many people you think were in each one?",
        "A: Very bad at statistics, but in the thousands. And I -- I have books to show you and",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- whatev -- the figures are. But then there are the Jews. You know, France was\ninvaded by the com -- the Germans came through Belgium and Holland to invade\nFrance in 1940 -- in May of 1940. We got caught up in that, because we were living\nup there. And the Jews fled Belgium and Holland. And they arrived in the south of\nFrance. My brother-in-] -- mart -- my husband\u2019s sister and her husband lived in\nBelgian. They were caught in that. H -- the brother-in-law was in a camp 1n the south\nof France. He was able to get out and meet his wife in Marseilles -- she had been\ngoing all the way through -- from Belgium, all the way to the south of France, they\nwere able to escape to Cuba and spend the war in Cuba. You get family sagas you\nwouldn\u2019t believe when some of us get together. And so all these people were in\ncamps, some on -- early on, were able to get out with all kinds of papers and all kinds\nof visas, all kinds of thing. But the majority were trapped. They had -- they had no\npapers.",
        "Q: And at the beginning, your role was as a bona fide French Jew --",
        "A: As a --",
        "Q: -- so you were allowed to be free?",
        "A: As a bona fide French born Jew, I was relatively free to move. That doesn\u2019t mean\nthat all Jews in the south of France, because France was divided, we were -- lived in\nthe south -- didn\u2019t have to rig -- register. My parents had to regi -- everybody had to\nregister with the special o-office of Jewish affairs. Whether I registered or not, I don\u2019t\nremember.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I don\u2019t have any recollection and nobody asked, so I never know. I doubt that I\ndid, but I may be wrong. I don\u2019t know. Or my parents registered me as a member of\nthe family, I don\u2019t remember. But Jews were registered and I had an uncle who was\ndeported from Paris, a French born citizen who was deported from Paris in the very\nfirst convoy, arrested in 1941. But not because he was -- because of his status,\nparticularly, it was more because some-somebody had attacked some German in\nParis or something and they rounded up all the male Jews in this one particular\nneighborhood and he was among them, he and his father-in-law. He is on the list of\nthe first convoy to leave for Auschwitz from Drancy in 1942. So, we didn\u2019t know at\nthe time, but I -- I know now. I -- he is on the list. Where were we? I lost my train of\nthought.",
        "Q: Well, you were just explaining to me the set up of the -- of the camp.",
        "A: Oh, so in the camp, so this is -- these are the people who ran the camps.",
        "Q: And the un -- the general understanding of what happened to people who went to\na place like Rivesaltes --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- or a camp like that, was it -- were -- were they going go get out or they were\ngoing to stay there for the whole war, or --",
        "A: Th-They didn\u2019t go into the camp, they were picked up and put into the camp.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And these camps were not prepared for human beings. They were abandoned\narmy barracks, overrun with bugs and vermin. There was no running water, there\nwere -- I mean, the most horrible hygienic condition, as I say in my early interview.\nAnd so these people were there in these c-camps, awaiting that some govern --\nauthority would decide their fate. Some escaped. So, they were able to escape, some\nwere able to escape.",
        "Q: If someone was caught running from the camp, would they be shot?",
        "A: No, not -- th-they wouldn\u2019t be shot, they -- these -- they would be arrested and\nthey would be turned over to the authorities, the Vichy authority, the German\nauthority. Who -- who -- I mean, they were all working together. To some authority\nand they would probably be deported to the --",
        "Q: To where? To Germany? To Auschwitz?",
        "A: To -- to the east. We didn\u2019t know, in 1942 what that meant. The human mind\ncouldn\u2019t fathom death machines. At first we thought they were put to forced labor.\nOr resettled in the east. Resettlement in the east was the -- the euphemism. We had\nno idea. Death camp? I mean, how can the human mind even fathom such a thing?\nSo these -- so does that answer your que -- and these were the Jews that were in these\ncamps. And I -- and there they stayed, until they were deported. And indeed, as I sa --\nreported earlier, in 19 -- the summer of 1942, they start just rounding up people. And\nit was to send them to the east. Some for forced labor, some for -- whatever that\nmeant and some for resettlement. They were creating communities for Jews there. I\nhad no idea what it meant. All I know -- my mind should have been working a little\nbit better when they took elderly, handicapped people. You don\u2019t take people to work\nin the east in that condition. So, what we didn\u2019t know, that they were gassed right\naway, upon arrival in Auschwitz and [indecipherable]. So, those are the people were\nin Rivesaltes. And in Gersin and in other camps.",
        "Q: I just want to ask you a few more things, so I understand your own path. So -- so\nyour role in Rivesaltes was you were working to try to get children out, 1s that right?",
        "A: Well, not originally. You see, there were several agencies with international status\nthat had a conference in Nimes and they -- there was an agreement that the govern --\nwould -- would permit social workers [indecipherable] social workers to be 1n these\ncamp to help the popula -- to -- to make life a little easier for them. They -- they had\nnothing to do. The men and women were separated, the wer -- children were with the\nwomen, the men were separated. They lived in filth. They lived -- they had very little\nto eat, because the guards took the food and people died of dysentery, died of -- I\nmean, there are 3000 people died just of malnutrition. Was a study of malnutrition in\nthe camps. And the original intent was to improve the conditions in the camps. ORT,\nif you know it, is a Jewish organization, brought sewing machines for the women,\norganized workshops. I have pictures of, and my -- my sister-in-law\u2019s younger\nbrother worked in one -- in the kitchen. I mean, they did all -- they did some -- her\nfather, who was a shoemaker, organized a shoe repair shop, and -- and with the -- je -\n- with the organization, there were non-Jewish organization as well of Jewish ones.\nThere were very few Jewish ones, allowed us to -- to live in the camp. And I was in a\nfarm with my parents and one of my scouting leaders got a hold of me -- and I don\u2019t\nknow how she got my address.",
        "Q: This was Andre Solomon?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And since she\u2019s dead, I will never know. And I never asked her how she got ahold\nof me, now I don\u2019t -- will never know, but she found me and I left and I went to the\ncamp, and --",
        "Q: So you had known her a long time?",
        "A: Oh, yes. I -- she was one of my leaders in camp. She was the leader of the older\ngirl\u2019s club. In those days, there were -- the -- the older ones started at 18. Can you\nimagine today 18 year old girls, girl scouts, you know? But this was the commitment\nwe had and she was -- she was one of our leaders. And I knew her and she got ahold\nof me and so I went to live in the camp. I was 21 years old when I first started and we\n-- we tr -- I was in charge originally, to do something on behalf of the kids. So the\nfirst Shabbat I was there, I had, in this big empty barrack, I -- we announced that all -\n- there would be a program for the kids, a program with nothing. I mean, nothing -- I\nmean, nothing. Singing, what we could do and maybe something like -- and I had\n280 kids in that barrack, all ages. But here again, I had the support of that internee\npopulation. There were teachers, there were rabbi\u2019s, there were professionals of all\nkinds, doctors. And they helped. And they were internee themselves and they had\nbeen already in this camp, we -- and this was a tremendous lesson in human values\nand in -- in -- in human strengths, internal strengths. I mean, it was incredible for me\nto see people had lived in these conditions all the -- for all this length and time. The\ndignity with which they continue to live, under the very c-condition in which they\nlived. They\u2019d had no water to wash, they had no -- I mean, it was awful. And this is -\n- this is originally what I did, and I was part of a team that delivered extra rations. We\ngot, through all the agency, we delivered rations into the ca -- into the barracks and\nthen eventually in as -- paralleled another -- another part of the team of Ose worked\non the liberation of the kids from camp. And then I participated in taking kids out and\n-- and helped in that process as well. They overlapped, kind of thing. But a book has\nrecently been published by one -- the -- the -- the worker with whom I worked in that\ncamp, and -- but she left before the deportations started, but she set that whole\nliberation process into movement. And is very interesting as she -- she wrote the\nbook, she quotes me in the book. It\u2019s in French, I don\u2019t know how your French 1s,\nand she quotes me. There\u2019s a picture of me in the book and it\u2019s a pre -- the book got a\n-- an award in France. And it\u2019s very interesting, she recalls things that I did and said\nand I have no recollection of them at all. We all have very selective memories, so I --\nI was interesting to read. And at a later date, I would like to tell you a little bit about\nmy reuniting with my coworkers. Is this a good time?",
        "Q: Yeah. I think this would be a great time.",
        "A: Well, you know, but it entails a whole other kind of thing. I-It\u2019s a whole other\nchapter of my life in the United States. And this reconnecting with the past has been\na tremendous thing for me in the last 20 years. When I first came here -- well, I came\nas a student, I went back and then I came, because I\u2019d met my husband, and I really\nwanted to put everything -- everything behind me. I didn\u2019t even speak French to my\nkids. Today I think it was stupid. They could be bilingual so easily, but my husband\ndoesn\u2019t speak French and I certainly didn\u2019t want to speak German and my husband\ndoesn\u2019t -- has even forgotten his German. He doesn\u2019t want anything to do with\nanything German. So I had worked for the Joint Distribution Committee in Paris for a\nyear, in between my -- getting my degree here and then coming back eventually,\nbecause I had to work for my scholarship for -- to repay my scholarship. So, I n-\nnever wrote back to anybody, in any of the agencies, not -- I -- I mean, with very few\nexceptions. There are a few people I may have sent a Rosh Hashanah card or\nsomething like that. And I did go back when -- the first time I went back is in 1952,\nbecause my parents made it possible for us to bring their first grandchild -- not their\nfirst grandchild, they had already a whole bunch of grandchildren. My brother\nmarried much younger than I did. But bring the American grandchild over. And we\nwent over. And yes, I saw maybe one or two friends. One, I worked with during the -\n- in -- after the war and she was from my hometown and maybe we met in Paris, and\nanother one, but it was a very social kind of thing. I didn\u2019t see any -- or didn\u2019t make a\npoint of seeing any of my worker from the Joint Distribution Committee. I always\nwent to see -- no, I didn -- I must correct that. All went -- went to see that one person\nwho was the director of a children\u2019s home, with whom I worked during the war and\nwho after the war became the director of Ose. And I continue, even today. He\u2019s dead,\nbut his wife is in a nursing home and I still write to her a card on the holiday.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Monsieur Jobe.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I\u2019m still in touch with her, which is -- and every time we went to Paris, I\nwent to see her. But it wasn\u2019t so much to reminisce, it was just because we had --\nwe're good friends, you know? And so I had -- it\u2019s on the level of friendship, not to\ntalk about the war, or not to talk about anything. And other than that, I never talked\nabout my experiences. And as a matter of fact, to make sure, I asked my friend from\nCleveland, the one who came to visit this [indecipherable] and we -- we -- I was\ngoing to say we grew up -- no, we grew our children at the same time. We had\nchildren the same age and she was a concert scholarship student too, from Italy, who\ncame after me, to Cleveland. And I barely knew what she did during the war, or -- I -\n- I sort of know. And when we went to visit them a few years ago, in Florida, she\nsays, \u201cWhat did you actually do during the war?\u201d I said, \u201cOh, come on. You know. I\nmean, you\u2019ve known me all these years.\u201d She said we never talked about it. So I had\nconfirmation of the fact that I never talked about it. And I entered into a community\nof German Jews, because my husband is from Germany and through -- because he\nlived with a German family when I met him, he had room with a German -- German\nJewish family and we entered this whole German Jewish community, with which I\nreally had -- with whom I had very little in common -- but you didn\u2019t have to explain\nthings to them, they knew what the score was. I didn\u2019t have to tell them about these\nthings. They had -- they had not lived -- they had escaped. So -- did I tell my\nchildren? Yes, I\u2019m sure I talked about it. They know about it. But their dad went\nthrough -- but when -- what I went through, I\u2019ve talked to them about these things.\nThey knew about it, but I -- other than that, I never, in public talked about it.",
        "Q: So would you -- would you describe this as a conscious decision that you made or\nwas it just a kind of natural evolution?",
        "A: Well, it is such a natural evolution that it\u2019s universal. And when I talk -- and I\nthought maybe [indecipherable] in America. But when I talked to my friends, my\ncontemporaries and friends, they did the same thing. They needed -- as it was a need\nto -- to forget. There was a need to put behind. And then there is a change. You really\nneed to -- to -- to fill out your past again and to -- to fill out these detail. But I -- it is\na -- but with me, there was one more thing. That was in fran -- my friends in France\ntold me, \u201cSilonce for 30 years.\u201d Silence for 30 years. And this is -- this is true. For 30\nyears. And I think there was something else here. There was -- when -- when in it --\nwhen I made an attempt to ac -- to, yeah, explain something sometimes, about the\nwar, or about the war [indecipherable] -- there was such lack of comprehension on\nthe part of people I was talking to, that it shut me off. Sometimes very stupid\nquestions. I still get them today, these stupid questions.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, you mentioned them in the other interview.",
        "A: And there was a difficult -- and I -- and I -- I -- it -- it\u2019s amazing, I still do get\nthem occasionally, I mean -- what right -- what rights did they have to arrest you?\nWhat rights do you have during a war? You know, I mean, a teacher asked me those\nquestion in front of the students. What am I saying, what a stupid ques -- you know?\nIt\u2019s this kind of thing that I still get, and there was also -- you have to explain and\nexplain, and if I say -- if in France I say, heevsall, everybody knows what I\u2019m\ntalking. If I say AEF, [indecipherable] de France, everybody knows. You don\u2019t even\nsay AEF, you say [indecipherable] and everybody knows that is the Jewish scouting\nmovement.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And here I have to go into explanation.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And I -- I just couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t cope with that. And -- but coming to this\ncountry was a tremendous change for me in every aspect, as -- as you heard, about\nJudaism, it was different, it was entering a real professional life, because I had a -- a\ndegree. Before that I worked, but I didn\u2019t have a real, professional degree. That\ndoesn\u2019t mean I did better or worse, it just meant that -- and it was starting a career.\nAnd frankly and truly, it was a -- a struggle to get ahead and my parents had lost\neverything, weren\u2019t able to give me any money coming over. I think we spend\neverything they gave me on just buying enough stuff to -- to have a kitchen and a --\nand a room and stuff like that. So, my husband didn\u2019t have his degree yet. He went to\nschool at night. I had a job on the weekend, a job during the week and -- and I just\ndidn\u2019t dwell on that. So -- some of the --",
        "Q: So what changed? What -- what made you want to start talking?",
        "A: I know exactly when it happened. It was in the late -- in the mid 70\u2019s or early\nseven -- mid 70\u2019s, I cannot quite peg it. The council of Jewish women in clee -- in\nSyracuse, where we lived -- well, people knew that I was from France, that I had\ndone some underground work, or had worked in camp and -- I mean, th-there was\nsome general knowledge, but I had never, sort of really going a -- I think that once\nsisterhood asked me to participate in a program -- they will have other people who\nhad lived in Europe and I -- I must have sa-said a few word. But then, the Council of\nJewish women was working with the educators in Syracuse to introduce the\nHolocaust in their curriculum. And now we\u2019re going to a very touchy subject. And I\nwas asked to participate. This is the first time where I really did something officially,\nas a witness of the Holocaust, if you wish. That\u2019s the best definition I can come,\nbecause I don\u2019t view myself as a survivor, I don\u2019t view myself as -- I -- I was a\nrescuer, but at the same time was also a victim. So I always say I\u2019m a witness of the\nHolocaust. And so I participated in that. And then something fantastic happened. We\nseparated in two groups. One group was younger women, was -- they were mostly\nwomen, who wanted to create a group of children of survivors. And the other group\nwanted to meet with teachers and talk about curriculum. And I went with the children\nof survivors. And all of a sudden, I find myself much older than these people. They\nwere actually mostly professional women, whom I had known in the professional --\nmy professional li -- had no idea they were Jewish and certainly no idea they were\nchildren of survivors. And they -- each one of them were talking about their\nexperience -- I\u2019m sure you know the syndrome of children of survivors and how the\nbooks have been written about them and I had read the book -- Epstein\u2019s book, \u201cThe\nChildren of the Holocaust.\u201d And, as I listened to them and they asked me where I fit\nin out of it, I began to tell them of my experience. And I cried and I cried. I\u2019m still\ncrying today. And all of a sudden, the floodgates opened. I had never done that\nbefore. It was like yay, you have a lot of grieving to do. You have a lot of unfinished\nbusiness. And they created -- there\u2019s a group, I helped them create it and -- but I\ndidn\u2019t become a part of it, because I was too close to them. Although I\u2019m a therapist\nand I\u2019m a psychiatric social worker. And I -- they wanted somebody -- a\nprofessional, to lead their group. I -- I was -- I was -- I couldn\u2019t. I was too close to\nthat kind of thing. But it told me that I had a lot of work to do. Now, I didn\u2019t start the\nnext day with task one, two and three, but I allowed myself to -- to let the -- all these\nmemories get into me. And I was aware of having been affected by -- by -- by all of\nthese experiences, in very strange ways. I would see a program of refugees on the\nroad in Bangladesh or wherever and I\u2019d burst in tears. So I know that -- I mean, we\nwere expelled, we fled, we were on the road for -- for days and nights and all of this -\n- so I knew I had that in me, unresolved. And so -- and little by little, I began to talk\nmore about this. I accepted. I didn\u2019t really do much in Syracuse. This was more in the\n70\u2019s. Maybe I gave a talk or two, maybe at the synago -- I don\u2019t know pr-precisely,\nbut I was able to talk about it. And then -- oh, there\u2019s something else happened. Since\nmy husband traveled, as he told you, a great deal, internationally, I had the\nopportunity at one point -- he was working for two weeks in Paris and I must have\nbeen able to take two weeks off. And I went with him to Paris and for the first time I\nreconnected with my cousins in Paris, I have four cousins in Paris. And I had been --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",

        "A: -- weeks in Paris and I must have been able to take two weeks off. And I went\nwith him to Paris and for the first time I reconnected with my cousins in Paris, I have\nfour cousins in Paris. And I had been totally cut off from them and two of them were\nthe girls I had hidden and two of them were other cousins and all of them, in some\nway were connected to me, because after the war they were -- I -- they were in the\ninstitutions --",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Can go on?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They were in the institution and the children\u2019s home where I trained -- they -- they\nwere -- they were part of the staff, they wen -- and in later years I found out they\nalways looked up to me because I was older and because also their parents told --\nthey also hated me, because their parents say, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you do what Simone did?\u201d\nYou know, that kind. So, a mixed feeling. But I really connected. We visited. In these\ntwo weeks, I remember vividly, staying with one of my cousins and all five of us\nsitting on the floor in this upstairs room and talking about our families. The two girls\nwho had loved their parents, my -- they have a perception of my parents, I have a\nperception of their parents. And so family stuff, also. The skeletons. I remember we\nhad -- they re -- had a perception of my father, I had a perception of their parent and\nwe talked about that. And it was therapeutic.",
        "Q: Hold on one second, I have to change the tape...this is the beginning of tape two,\nit\u2019s an interview with Simone Weil Lipman and today is August fourth, 1998. And\nwe were talking about some of the -- the way that you began to change your ability\nand interest in talking about your experiences.",
        "A: Well, I -- in -- in these trips to France, I remember allowing myself to reconnect\nwith some of -- not only the relatives, but with the people I had worked with during\nthe war, those who were still living. And -- and then sharing our memories, on a very\none to one basis, the re -- one or the other, one I\u2019d worked in camp with or one I\u2019d\nworked in the children\u2019s home with and -- and it became -- I became aware that all of\na sudden, I wanted to -- to -- to -- to check out my memories and to share them. And\nit felt wonderful, because there I didn\u2019t have the lack of understanding. I had instant\ncomprehension, you know, it was -- we were on the same wavelength. And we talked\nand -- now I cannot say that we stayed in touch, because none of us are really\ncorresponding. But I fairly frequently went to France, but mostly what happened was\nthat I was able to talk about my experiences here. Now, it\u2019s a universal phenomenon\nfor survival, is to not have talked about their experiences for 30 years and it is shared\nby the people in France and it\u2019s shared by people here. It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a universal\nthing. And I had read about the Holocaust, I had read Elie Wiesel\u2019s book. Elie\nWiesel, by the way, was a kid of Ose, who had been coming to France to -- to -- in 19\n-- ever -- I\u2019d -- and I\u2019d -- the end of the war, and he was rescued by Ose, whe -- in\none of the children\u2019s homes. And the director of that children\u2019s home 1s one of my\nvery good friends, and so we\u2019ve talked about him. And every time I go to Paris I see\nher and we talk about these kids, we talk about -- we talk about all these things of the\npast. And I think that enabled me to begin to talk about my experiences. I\u2019m not sure\nexactly when, exactly, and with what group, but I had to go through that journey of\nreconnecting and it really d -- the -- the -- the cath -- the cathartic point was when I\nhad that meeting with this -- this [indecipherable] of survival, when I became aware\nthat -- that all that grieving that I hadn\u2019t done -- nobody had time to grieve, you had\nto -- you had to go on and that I -- I had to -- to go back 1n all this experience and talk\nabout them. And then, in 1982, we moved to France -- 1983, we moved to France. I\nretired from -- [ -- at that time I was on the faculty of the Upstate Medical Center in\nthe Department of Pediatrics and Child Psychiatry. And I was in private practice,\nworking with families of young children. And I was ready to retire, to say the least.\nAnd in France, I became very active in the Jewish community in which we lived. We\nlived in Lyon, in -- outside of Lyon, we live in -- in a suburb of Lyon. But we\nbecame very active again, in creating a Jewish community, but that\u2019s another kind of\nstory. Although it\u2019s the same story, but again we were at a nucleus of creating\nsomething there.",
        "Q: I -- I think that\u2019s very significant, you know.",
        "A: Well, we\u2019ve seen in --",
        "Q: I don\u2019t want you to gloss over it, I think it\u2019s important.",
        "A: Well, what was very important, is that in Judaism is very sterile -- th-the kind --\nthe kind we encountered in France was very sterile and there was a -- th-there is a\ntradition of Judaism and people belong, but they don\u2019t go, you know, because there is\nno alternative. And I have two cousins in Lyon and th-they were o-of that branch of\ntotally -- of not knowing what they were doing and having really no significant\nJewish life, but belonging to something that is so traditional, that God forbid you\ndon\u2019t change it, kind of thing. And there are some -- there is a liberal community in\nFrance, it\u2019s called the j -- |-liberal Judaism. There\u2019s two -- two -- two flavors. But\nthere was nothing in Lyon and somebody found out that we were, quote, not -- I\nmean, liberal Jews. I don\u2019t know what that means in -- in their definition, that we --\nthat we were welcoming, you know, another form of Judaism. I don\u2019t know how it\ngot spread. I became very active with the equivalent of Hadassah, I\u2019m a member here\nof Hadassah, but I have never been a -- that women\u2019s organization kind of -- first of\nall I was working full time -- not full time, I was working all my life and I just\nhaven\u2019t had -- gave all my extra energy to the synagogue and to it\u2019s various\nprograms. I have done so many program. A -- that I had nothing left for women\u2019s\norganization. I\u2019m a life member of the National Council of Jewish Women, because I\nowe them, and -- but I have not been active. But in France I became active with the\nveetsu. I ba -- I devised their programs and still today, they are following in my\nfootsteps. I managed t-to -- their programs and became very f -- brought somebody to\n-- to their meetings who became a very dear friend and she\u2019s still active in bringing\na program [indecipherable]. But I was a program whatever -- chair or whatever there\n-- not such ti -- but I activated that very -- that kind of thing.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And they\u2019re following in my way of doing thing. And also in -- in the -- in this\nJewish community -- see, France --",
        "Q: Let me ask you a question, ha -- wh-when you refer to yourself or other people\nrefer to you as a -- a liberal Jew --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: In -- I ma -- to -- to what -- what aspects are you referring to? Is this -- is this a\npolitical liberalism?",
        "A: It -- it -- it has to do with -- with regard to law -- Jewish law -- I\u2019m not strict with\nJewish law --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But I\u2019m all -- well, th-the political implication, I don\u2019t know [indecipherable], so\nI\u2019m talking much more about [indecipherable] about dus -- ame -- observing the fine\npoints of -- of Jewish law, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. But for me, it\u2019s also much\nmore being -- since I view Judaism as having evolved over the centuries, I do not\nview it as fixed, I view it as a historical Judaism, Conservative Judaism 1s historical\nJudaism. It views that Judaism has changed over -- over the centuries, according to\nthe ages in which it lived. The Judaism of Moses is not the Judaism of Miamanidis\nand is not the ju -- and is not the Judaism of Rabbi Kaplan or of whoever the chief\nrabbi in Israel 1s. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s evolves constantly and to me that is the important.\nIt has to be dynamic, it has to change with the days. And in France, it was so rigid\nwhen we came back to France. The women sitting upstairs, that sits very well with\nme. And the women downs -- the men downstairs and I upstairs and they didn\u2019t even\nhave -- when the Torah reading came, they didn\u2019t have a hamas -- a -- a book to read\nthe Torah reading. So I went downstairs and asked one of the men if I could have a\nhama -- he looked at me as if I were from another planet, you know? A women who\ncan follow the Torah reading. So, you know, it\u2019s this kind of attitude that say I can\u2019t\nworship here. So, you know, we tried the -- the -- North African community in which\nwe lived, I mean they were even more rigid. And then they -- Judaism in France,\ntraditional Judaism does not accept conversions that are not made by Orthodox rabbi\n-- it\u2019s a little bit like in Israel. So there were many converts in -- who had no place to\ngo, so they formed their own liberal mo -- le mouvement liberale juivre de France.\nAnd -- but they had nobody to lead it. So some -- they wanted us to help them and we\nmet at people\u2019s houses. And who carried the burden [indecipherable]. So they asked\nme to become the president. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not a citizen. I\u2019m an American citizen. You\ncan\u2019t have a president who is not a citizen and incorporate this group. I don\u2019t -- and I\ndon\u2019t want to be and I\u2019m leaving again. I\u2019m not staying here.\u201d And they were totally\non the wrong tracks. But we -- we participated and whatever.",
        "Q: What was the general age of this congregation?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t a -- it was a group of people and we were the only -- I mean, oh, in -- in\ntheir 40\u2019s, 50\u2019s.",
        "Q: Young- Younger than you? [indecipherable]",
        "A: Eee, oh, nobody as old as we were. Oh, although my -- we were still working --\nno, more 50ish, meta -- the oldest maybe in their 50\u2019s, late 50\u2019s, 60.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I was younger then, too. I was only har -- I was only in my 60\u2019s too, at the\ntime, so yeah, and --",
        "Q: And is there a re -- a relationship -- in your belief, in your perception of this\ninterpretation of Jewish law, with -- with being a liberal person and -- and with\nintegrating -- with integrating one\u2019s Judaism and religion with the rest of your life\nand -- and your neighbors?",
        "A: Never thought about it. I think -- I don\u2019t know. I hadn\u2019t thought about that. I want\n-- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s interesting, because this new group we are trying to participate with, they\nwant to be all inclusive, t -- and -- and I would like to include them, but also I want --\nat the same time I want some -- I want my tradition to remain, s-see what I mean, a --\nthe things that are important to me. To me, the core of -- of thing like -- we have\ntraveled a great deal. I have attended service in Istanbul and I\u2019ve attended service in\nStockholm and I have attended services all over. And to me, this is fantastic, that I\ncan walk in there and I know enough of the service that I can open whatever prayer\nbook they give me. It\u2019s always Hebrew. The Hebrew is the Hebrew. The service is\nthe same, bu -- it\u2019s a -- this -- this -- this fantastic thing that binds Jews from all over\nthe world. T-To me this 1s -- and I -- and I\u2019m very grateful that I have the Jewish\nknowledge to be able to enjoy this. To -- you know, I -- we went with a group of\npeople to istan -- service at Istanbul and of course the women were upstairs. What\nelse is new? And so I -- I listen, I listen and it\u2019s a different pronunciation and all that,\nbut I know where I am. There was a -- one other woman, she was a rabbi\u2019s wife and\nshe found her place too. And they all said, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d But you know, for a\nlifelong attendance at service and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- so, what a -- I don\u2019t want this to be\ndestroyed by rigidity. I want it to be alive with variety. I don\u2019t know what else to say.\n[ -- | haven\u2019t put it in words. And that\u2019s to me 1s exciting. So, getting into a new\ngroup, that\u2019s -- wants to be inclusive and yet at the same time maintain some\ntradition, that\u2019s what\u2019s important to me, so we tried that, we were not very successful\nin France, because we were the only ones who really were with any contin -- no,\npeople were floating in and out. Eventually, for the high holidays, we went to\nGeneva, Switzerland, which was an hour and a half away and spent the high holidays\nthere. Ah, because they had a very interesting international community there, with a\nrabbi who was trained in Cincinnati and so we had a very interesting service there\nand we felt very welcome and they included a lot of English -- English and French in\nthe service. And they -- and it was okay. See, even though I do understand the -- the -\n- the Hebrew, I want the -- the secular language to be included. To -- to include more\npeople. This is too important to me, is to include people. So, anyway, so we lived in\nFrance and there I all -- there I really connected. First of all, Ose, the agency for\nwhich I worked, was doing their archives and they send a interviewer to Lyon and I\ndid an oral tape for them, of course in French. And the woman with whom I worked\nin Rivesaltes, who was already at Rivesaltes when I got there -- she was a philosophy\nstudent from a completely assimilated family who didn\u2019t even know what Hanukkah\nwas --and, so I don\u2019t know what brought her to the camp, but that\u2019s her problem, not\nmine. And she became the director of Ose. And so we got in touch with her, because\nshe read my report and she related to it. And that --",
        "Q: Want to tell me her name?",
        "A: Vivette Samuel. She\u2019s the one who wrote the book, by the way.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And then, we were there when she got the Chevalier de la legion d\u2019honor. The\nLegion of Honor in France, a big ceremony, which I attended.",
        "Q: That was for OSE?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: The honor was for who?",
        "A: For her -- for her.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And so I attended that in Paris and while I was in Paris attending that, I met\npeople who told me, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember? Yo -- we met here and you slept in my\nroom there and --\u201d I don\u2019t remember these things. But 1t was wonderful, because all\nthese people were part of my past. I -- it was almost like reclaiming a piece of myself.\nAnd so allowed myself to open up and to -- to hear all these things, to talk about all\nthese things, to cry about these thing. So these three years in France, I -- I did that\noral history and I -- and I -- I really was able to -- to share a great deal. And at the\nsame time, I really reconnected with my cousins. And Jew -- they were not -- they --\nthey be not -- that doesn\u2019t -- I ma -- I -- it was family and we talked about our -- we --\nwe filled all our holes in our memories about our parents and grandparents and that.\nIn the meanwhile, th -- since then, I\u2019ve done a lot of genealogical work out -- one of\nour sons is very interested in that and he is on the computer and doing all kinds of\nstuff. And so, I have send them all this stuff too and I found a cousin on my father\u2019s\nside and all this kind of thing has hap -- I mean, he found me, I didn\u2019t find him, he\nfound me. And so, all of this has been very, very beneficial to -- to me. And so when\nI came back from France and we settled down here and we joined a congregation, a\nConservative one. And I joined the educa -- adult education committee, what else?\nAnd the [indecipherable] committee. It was not as satisfactory, because the memories\nof our congregation in Syracuse are such that we can never duplicate that. It was --\nyou cannot recreate an extended family like that when you\u2019re older than the rest of\nthe peop -- you can no longer move in the same -- in the same way. So we, sadly we -\n- we have not connected in our congregation. But, coming back to my work there, I\ngave several talks. I offered to -- because I was part of adult education, I gave a talk\nabout my experiences. And this led to my being the Holocaust speaker, maybe about\nSIX years ago, seven years ago, I was -- on Yom HaShoah, there 1s Holocaust day, I\nwas the speaker for this -- the whole Chapel Hill community. It was extremely well\nattended and I was able to di -- I -- I wrote a paper, a -- you know, based on my\nexperience and I mostly talked about what we alluding to before, how do you talk\nabout the Holocaust. And I had read an article by Rabbi Shulweiss. He\u2019s a rabbi in\nEncino Valley in -- in -- in California. And he\u2019s always been one of my gurus, one of\nthe people I like to read. He\u2019s very liberal minded and he is -- we actually -- when we\nwere in California -- we took a trip to California about 11 years ago and we made it a\npoint to be, on Saturday, in -- in that area, so we could attend services. Well, he -- he\nis such a personal person. I mean, he comes and shakes your hand and where are you\nfrom? And I know somebody in Chapel Hill and this -- this kind of thing. But he 1s\nliberal, he is -- he writes beautifully, he is -- he is my kind of rabbi. I\u2019ve never had\none like that. And he had written about telling his children about the Holocaust and\nhow do you tell them about it and how he had great deal of difficulties dealing with\nthis and telling his children about the Holocaust, until he found about -- found out\nabout the Righteous Gentiles and about the people who have helped, during the --\nduring the war in -- in all countries. And that not, quote, everybody was against the\nJews, unquote. There were people helping. And by looking at that aspect of the --\nwhat happened during the war, he was able to then talk to his children about the other\nthings that happened.",
        "Q: Now, can you elabo -- can you elaborate on that distinction and why -- why that\nwas so important for him?",
        "A: Because it -- it puts -- number one, a posit af -- a positive aspect on the -- on what\nseems like a ca -- total inhumanity of man against man and that\u2019s all you hear about.\nBut there was a humane aspect, at least in some of the people. And the second thing\nis, in talking to the children about these horrible things that happened, from time\nimmorial whether it\u2019s from Haman down to all the generations of the Crusades and\nwhat have you, all our kids hear is about the persecution. But when you can tell them\nabout people who\u2019ve helped the Jews and are still helping the Jews, you can m-\nmodify that message. And when you -- and to me there is one more point, if you can\ntalk about things that Jews have achieved, they\u2019re -- next to the Holocaust Museum,\nthere should be a museum of the -- learning through the ages, the -- I\u2019m not talking\nabout the Nobel Prizes, the Jewish Nobel Prizes or the Jewish basketball players. I\u2019m\ntalking about the wisdom of -- of the ages, of the si -- of the -- the learning that took\nplace, the contributions to -- to everything. And you have to balance it all. And so,\nthis was the gist of my talk. I talked about -- I didn\u2019t talk about what I did -- I can\nnever talk about what I did during the war. This, to me, is -- number one it\u2019s too\npersonal and number two, it\u2019s I focus -- I want to focus on the children and -- and\nwhat happened to them. But I also wanted to -- with this -- this reading of -- this\nthing about -- that Rabbi Shulweiss wrote, I was able to focus also on the rescue\naspect. And then I can wean myself into that whole rescuing effort. But I\u2019m a Jew,\nrescuing my own. You know, it\u2019s not quite the same as non-Jew rescuing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And this is -- so this is my talk that I gave and from then on I have been in\ndemand. And at first I was not very selective and I accepted all the offers, feeling that\nI had a duty, a responsibility, and -- and becoming aware that indeed, you have to\ntalk in the first person. You -- this is the real stuff, that can touch you. And this\nsummer, I feel very virtuous, I cleaned out my files, because I was home so much.\nAnd I have stacks and stacks of letters from kids in schools where I talked about.\nAnd I keep those. I have thrown out a lot of stuff in my life, but I\u2019m keeping these. I\nhope my children and grandchildren would see them, because they\u2019ve been touched\nby -- by the real thing and so, although I usually tell them I don\u2019t -- that -- that other\npeople have known what I have done and that kind of thing. I said, I have to tell them\nspecifically what I did, otherwise not real to them. So I have learned to do that in\nvarious, different ways. And of course I have -- I\u2019ve talked. I give a li -- different\nemphasis whether I talk at the university or whether I talk at the church youth group\nand you know, it\u2019s different, focus is different, [indecipherable] is different, pattern.\nBut I\u2019ve been able to do it as a berd -- on -- as I told you earlier. And just last year, I\ndid so many that it was really exhausting and then I -- I\u2019m doing -- handling it very\nwell, while I\u2019m -- my audience -- and I don\u2019t need any notes, I don\u2019t need any papers\nand I just talk and I -- I love to talk in public. This is -- by the way, is -- I don\u2019t write.\nI have never been able to write and even in my very successful schooling, writing\nwas always a problem. And my teachers tore out their hair and they didn\u2019t know why\nI was so good in everything else, and not in writing. So writing is something I don\u2019t\ndo. But I make an outline -- I make myself an outline, once I know I have to have a\nbeginning and a middle and an end and I have to clearly define in my introduction\nwhat I\u2019m going to cover and then I zoom and I talk. And that\u2019s how -- like I said, I\ndon\u2019t have my written talks, except for the one that I gave at this conference at UNC,\nwhere they were supposed to be published in a book. They never were, but I really\nwrote out something on rescue and resistance. And so until last year, I found out that\nI had this after reaction of arrhythmia -- of irregular heartbeat. When it happened the\nfirst time, I didn\u2019t quite relate, but it happened the second time, after I gave a talk,\nand then I went to see a doctor and I\u2019m on medication. So I have been slowing down\non this a little bit. And I heard a speaker from England, a wonderful person, a non-\nJew, who has devoted his life to teaching the Holocaust -- in -- in England, Steven\nSmith, who created the one and only teaching Holocaust museum in England and he\n-- after hi -- an experience in Israel, when he went to Yad Vashem and came back to\ndevote his life to this and I heard him talk here, in a small group. Somebody brought\nhim over and then I told him about, you know, my difficulty to continue talking. He\nsays, \u201cBut then, don\u2019t do it. Let somebody else do it.\u201d And I have to accept the fact\nthat I\u2019m not going to do as much of that any more. But I must go and tell you about\nsomething else that has given me back so much in the last few years. About five --\nit'll be five years this December, Ose had, in celebration, I believe of the 80th\nanniversary of the creation of Ose in -- in Russia, a reunion in Paris of the hidden\nchildren. The children they had hidden during the war. And of course I went. And to\nme, this has been the highlight of my last few years here and a tremendously\nimportant experience. Because, when I -- as I have given these interviews, as I\u2019m\ndoing with you today. Or as I\u2019m being -- talk and s -- people ask me for specifics, I\ndon\u2019t remember specifics. I don\u2019t remember names of kids, I don\u2019t remember specific\nfacts. Is it because in the early years here, I really so blocked out everything that it\u2019s\nblocked away totally? I don\u2019t know. Or did I just not invest myself enough in these\nkids that I don\u2019t remember them? I felt a guilt --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Simone Lipman. This is tape number three, side B.",
        "A: -- years here, I really so blocked out everything that it\u2019s blocked away totally? I\ndon\u2019t know. Or did I just not invest myself enough in these kids that I don\u2019t\nremember them? I felt a guilt that I maybe didn\u2019t put enough of myself into them.\nWell, little by little, I reconne -- first of all, I reconnected -- a woman who lives in\nRichmond tried to find me, because I had been her social worker and her counselor\nand what have you -- and --",
        "Q: Where -- where was she then?",
        "A: She was living in Richmond, but she was only sip --",
        "Q: No, when you were her counselor?",
        "A: Oh, well, there\u2019s -- the story is that she was in Rivesaltes, her parents both died in\nRivesaltes, of dysentery. She was left an orphan. Got her out the camp and she was\nwith the Jewish scouts and then in another --",
        "Q: How -- how old was she, about?",
        "A: Oh, teen-ager, 16? 14 - 15 - 16? And then, apparently, when I was in the\nunderground, I hid her in a convent. I say apparently, because I don\u2019t remember. And\nwhen the war was over and I reopened the first children\u2019s home, I took her into that\nchildren\u2019s home and she was in the sewing room and she showed me pictures of her\nwith me and all that. I don\u2019t remember. And she found me where we were living in\nFrance. She happened to be on sabbatical with her husband, who is at the university\nin Richmond and she\u2019s an artist. She had come to this country to unite with family\nand it didn\u2019t work out, as so often it didn\u2019t, but she made a life for herself. Had no\nchildren. And so she told me all that story and then we have -- now, whenever we go\nthrough Richmond, I see her. Whenever she comes down here -- she was here\nrecently and she did a lot of beautiful artwork and have it in -- and she gave me a lot\nof her work. And she has such a positive memory of the things I did on behalf of her\nfamily and herself, that I was astounded. I was -- I mean, anybody thinks that much.\nYou know, I had just sort of -- because I -- I couldn\u2019t remember these things, I\nthought maybe I hadn\u2019t put anything into it. And then there was this reunion in\nFrance. And here I was with my husband and there were 500 children between the\nages of 55 and 70, I would say, coming from all over the world. Of course, the\nmajority from France, but they were from Israel, they were from Argentina, they\nwere from the United States, from England, from all over. And they were looking for\npieces of themselves in -- in other\u2019s memories. And pictures were plastered all over,\nfor people looking each other. Be -- I stayed with my cousin, so I didn\u2019t stay there the\nwhole time, but I attended all the meeting. And some people were looking for me.\nSome kids were looking for me. There was particularly one woman, I mean th-this\none had phoned me already. She had gone to Paris seeking -- looking for anybody\nshe had been connected with during the war, because she had lost all her family. And\nshe lived in Toronto and she had, through somebody at the information center on the\nHolocaust, she had ga -- f -- happened to meet somebody whom I worked with\nduring the war, and gave her my addre -- and she wrote to me and I found out that I\nwas the director of the children\u2019s home, after the war, where she was. And she told\nme any number of stories about me and the things I did. Including serving these kids\nbreakfast in bed on Shabbat morning, because I don\u2019t remember it. She told me ab --\nthat -- the stories I told on Friday night, that she had kept with her all her life. I don\u2019t\nremember. But it must have been me and then it must have have happened. And then\nin Paris, the most fantastic thing that happened wa -- there was Friday evening\nservice -- there were Friday evening of wet -- at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon,\nbecause sundown is at four o\u2019clock and it\u2019s winter and this December. So we had\nservices, maybe five o\u2019clock, it was dark and women upstairs, men downstairs. And\nI\u2019m -- we all had now name tags and on the name tags we had put down where we\nhad been with children\u2019s homes and the name of children home, the camps and so on.\nBut nothing distinguished the social workers from -- the workers from the -- the\nchildren, the counselor, and we all had the same nametag. So I had the Rivesaltes and\nMoultanta and Polousa -- the names of place -- the name. And --",
        "Q: Te-Tell me, I\u2019m just curious, how many places did you work?",
        "A: Oh well, I -- I have to count. First Rivesaltes and then I worked in a children\u2019s\nhome called Polousa and then I worked in the underground and then I worked -- I\nopened a children\u2019s home in Moultanta and then one outside of Paris. So, for this\nagency, I worked in four different places. And so -- and of course there were workers\nthere and I knew many of the workers and it was wonderful to talk with the workers.\nSome came from Israel, some came from elsewhere and, \u201cDo you remember, you\nslept in my room that night when you were arrested?\u201d \u201cI did? I don\u2019t remember.\u201d\nAnd that kind of thing. But up -- up in that service on Friday afternoon, next to me\nsits a very elegant woman in her fur coat and she jerks around and says in French to\nme, \u201cWhere you from?\u201d And I said, \u201cFrom America.\u201d And she says, \u201cOh, you look\nso French. I thought you were from France.\u201d So I says, \u201cI\u2019m a little bit from both.\u201d\nAnd then she looks at my tags. \u201cOh, you were in Rivesaltes?\u201d All the way -- all the\ntime thinking that I\u2019m one of the kids, too, you know, because it doesn\u2019t say social\nworker or worker or any -- or counselor or anything like that. And she said, \u201cWhen\nwere you there?\u201d And I s -- told her. And then she says, \u201cI was in Rivesaltes. My\nparents were in Rivesaltes, they were deported. My brother was in Rivesaltes. And a\nsocial worker took me out of the camp, although I was over 16, she faked my papers.\nAnd I shall all remember her, she took me out and took me to such and such a pla --.\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cWhat was -- what was the name of the social worker?\u201d And she said,\n\u201cSimone Weil.\u201d And it was just absolutely incredible. We just fell into each other\u2019s\narms and -- and then she happens to know my sister-in-law and all the store -- that --\nshe survived, obviously, in hiding. And she married a Jewish -- French Jewish man\nwho knew my family and so that\u2019s why she knew about my family, about my\nbrother. And we talked and when the service was over, we went downstairs, we met\nthe men and we\u2019ve -- and then she\u2019s been writing to me -- you know, not much, but -\n- but through her, somebody else got in touch with me and then there was the woman\nin -- in Toronto who got somebody else in touch with me. And these kids, in\nquotation mark, have given me back so much in -- of my own memories. And\nvalidating someone, myself or my work, which I had completely devaluated, because\nof my lack of memory, that maybe that\u2019s what has enabled me to give all these talks.\nAnd to -- to really talk about the children, because they have enriched my memories\ntremenda -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s ust been incredible. And then books have been written, books\nthat describe experiences that have been mine and I have read them and so this has\nbeen my latest journey, as of the last five years. And we\u2019ve gone back to France. In\nfact, next year would be our 50th wedding anniversary and we plan to go back to\nStrasbourg, where I still have a cousin. And so we -- each time I go now, we\nreconnect and so, at that conference, I had another fantastic experience. We met --\nwh-when I say we, I mean we, all retired social workers -- not social worker -- all\nprofessional workers of the same vintage, within a year or two, who had all worked\nfor Ose during the war, either in the camp -- three of us -- four of us were from the\ncamp and had worked in Rivesaltes. One was the wife of the -- the widow of the --\nthe head of our underground team and another one w-was the worker who was in the\nchildren\u2019s home, but we all, in one capacity or another had been connected to this\nwork. We met together after the conference. And it was the most wonderful thing\nthat happened to me. Something that doesn\u2019t exist for me in this country. There\u2019s no\none I can talk like that. And my husband wasn\u2019t part of that. He -- he -- he -- he\n[indecipherable] went up the Eiffel Tower or something, but anyway, we had this\nwonderful sharing and I needed it. Maybe they needed me too, there, but --",
        "Q: I -- I want to ask you a question about your husband and if you don\u2019t want to talk\nabout it -- but I know that you mentioned in the interview -- the video interview, that\nhe\u2019s not able to talk about any experiences?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: What\u2019s the fundamental difference between you and him?",
        "A: He\u2019s a very introverted person. A very private person. Also he -- he was a -- a\nvery lonely child when he grew up. His siblings were much older and he was really\nleft to his own devices. And has very traumatic memories of his childhood, but he\nhas made contact --",
        "Q: That were related to the war, or --",
        "A: Oh yes, all related to the war, and then he was alone in boarding school in\nEngland and then he came here and -- but finally -- we\u2019ve talked about this a great\ndeal. Finally he has made contact with the Speedwerk Foundation to do an\ninterview. Now, they -- they called him, they said yes, we will work you\n[indecipherable] and I hope it\u2019s going to happen, because I wish he would. We did\ntake one trip with our grown -- before our children got married, our sons, when we\nwere living in France, we all went to Germany, to his house and to his village. And\nthere he -- while we were there he was able to talk to the children a little bit about --\nin the cemeteries full of Lipmans and all that. Can we stop for a minute?",
        "Q: Sure [indecipherable]",
        "A: I want to put the air conditioner on.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I\u2019m getting very -- 1s that [inaudible]",
        "Q: [indecipherable] I want to spend a little bit of time talking about just th-the -- the\npattern of your -- of your life, some of your personal development, your -- your\nmarriage and your family. One of the thing that struck me in -- in -- in the video\ninterview that I watched, you said -- I -- I -- I -- I could look it up, but you said\nsomething about -- and it was related, I think even -- in fact, when you were speaking\nabout your -- the gaps in your memory and the things that you blocked out, that you\ndidn\u2019t remember a lot of the children, because you were afraid to get too close. And I\nwas wondering how -- how that played out in your own family? Did -- did you\ncontinue to be a person who was afraid to get close to people? Or were -- were you\nthe opposite?",
        "A: Now that I know that, 1t probably was not a failure to get close to the children that\nbroke off my memory, but rather a -- a whole blocking out of -- of -- of feeling\nrelated to these memories. I -- I don\u2019t think it interfered with my relationships with\nmy children at all. I don\u2019t think so. We have a very -- we have a close relationship.\nWe -- it did not interfere with my work. I -- as I told you, I -- I worked in a variety of\nsetting, dealing with children. I started out by being the director of a day care center,\nwhere I chose not to remain the director, but to become the case worker, because I\nwanted to learn to work directly with children. I interrupted my career for four years\nto be alone at home, you know, one child in two rooms upstairs. Peter sometime ask,\n\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d He ask in his multiple room, multiple bathroom house that\neverybody has these day. And somehow it must have worked out, because I\nremember incidents where I was getting cl-claustrophobic and with one child at\nhome and I remember vividly -- it\u2019s just a little incident and I spanked him and I was\nenraged and wha -- you know, on the verge of being abusive mother and I\u2019m joking,\nbut you know, when you\u2019re at -- at home with a kid all the time. And many years\nlater, when he was at college, he was filling out these papers and some -- some kind\nof study where he ask whether he was ever spanked when he was a kid and he\nanswered no and I said, \u201cBut Peter, don\u2019t you remember I spanked you?\u201d I had such\nguilt about it. And --",
        "Q: You spank him once or many times?",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- no, I\u2019m not a spanking mothe -- but that day I remember so vivid, I can\nsee myself. I don\u2019t know what he had done or what drove me nuts. And then he said\nhe was never spanked and I said, \u201cBut don\u2019t you remember that day?\u201d You know, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t remember.\u201d And then it occurred to me that when the climate is good, a little\nbit of bad weather doesn\u2019t matter. So the climate must have been good and that was\njust a little bout of bad weather. So, on the whole the climate\u2019s been good and so I\nmust have done something right about that. I worked with children, I -- I went back\nto work in foster care. I went, eventually, when we left Cleveland and my husband\nwas transferred to Syracuse, I interrupted for awhile, because we had just made an --\nhit a new city and Robby was just entering school and I floundered around for\nawhile, not knowing what I wanted to do and Syracuse was -- looked to me like to be\nin the dark ages as compared to Cleveland. Eventually it turned out to be really our\nhighlight in our life. And eventually I went to work for child guidance clinic. And\nthere, for a variety of reason, was able to develop my own style of work, because we\nhad very poor leadership. So, there was one of the benefits of poor leadership, I\n[indecipherable] was able to give papers -- not writing, give paper. And became a\nconsultant to early childhood programs. I became a consultant to preschool, to pre-K,\nto daycare, to nurse -- private nursery school. While I was still on the staff of the -- of\nthe mental health department, the child guidance clinic. And developed all kinds of\nworkshops for all the staff -- the staffs of the various early childhood programs in\nSyracuse, I did any number of training and workshops and stuff like that. So I always\ndealt with children and I have all these wonderful letters of people thanking me.",
        "Q: Let me get back to your own children now. Your -- you mentioned before that\nbook, \u201cChildren of the Holocaust\u2019?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: That -- the book, \u201cChildren of the Holocaust\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you have a -- have a first account with other families of -- of Holocaust\nsurvivors or people from your own position? You know, where you\u2019ve seen\nrelationships between the parents and the children and -- and that\u2019s part one and then\npart two is -- ha-has there been any entrance in your own family, of these issues?",
        "A: No. It\u2019s interesting, a -- you know, as I said earlier, neither my husband and I view\nour -- because we\u2019re parents, both of us are parenting our children, we view\nourselves as survivors, but the children of survivors and children of the Holocaust,\ntalk more about their parents who have been in -- in the death camps. And that\u2019s very\ndifferent from having [indecipherable] so we are quite a large step removed from\nthat. And particularly my husband who was not -- I mean he left Germany at -- when\nhe was 17 and was in England. So, he was interned in England, you know, J-Jews\nwere interned -- I mean, Germans were interned in Eng-England, so he was in the\n[indecipherable] he was in a camp, but that camp was a country club compared to\nwhat people in France had to go through. So I don\u2019t think my children considered\nthemselves as children of survivors. They consider -- th-they know their parents have\na history and they have shown some interest in it. I can only compare my family, for\ninstance, to this other woman who w-was a witness 1n Italy and -- and went through\nthat -- who came, also as a counseled student. And she has the same relationship that\nwe have with their three children, we -- we have same age children, with one in\nbetween. And I don\u2019t see any difficulties in these relationships. And interesting\nenough, my husband has a sister in New York, there\u2019s a big age gap and she got\nmarried youn -- married very young and s -- and he got married very late, so the --\nthe generations are very skewed, you know, so she\u2019s already a great grandmother,\nyou know, and we, our grandch-children are not even Bar Mitzvah, you know, so it\u2019s\na big, big gap there. And they have two daughters -- my sister-in-law, they have two\ndaughters and one is in her 60\u2019s already, my niece and her sister. And her sister is a\nfew years younger and her sister considers herself as a chil -- a child of survivors and\nattended all these meetings of a group as child of survivors. And the older sister\ndoesn\u2019t understand it, why does she have that need? So it 1s something entirely\nperceived by the child, for God knows -- a variety of individual reasons, a pass -- this\n-- place in the family, self perception, I don\u2019t know what. But I don\u2019t feel -- the only\nthing that -- both boys married, of course, women born in this country. Have no\nconnection -- I mean, they\u2019re American born women and -- so sometimes I feel there\nis a -- there is a -- a little gap there. Just a little gap there, just like this -- we are -- we\nare not the old generation from the old countries, but we are different. But I cannot\nquantify it or qua -- even qualify it. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s something that I perceive, but I don\u2019t\nthink our children ever felt themself to be any different for having parents who were\nsurvi --except from having parents who mispronounce names [indecipherable] my\nsons made any numbers of -- of jokes about their mother putting the accent on -- on\nsyllable -- on being more strict than most parent. I have a -- you know -- we were\nstrict with our children and I\u2019m not sorry at all about it. And maybe they view that as\nbeing part of our European background, I don\u2019t know. Never talked about it. I don\u2019t\nview that as having been in the way with our children.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What -- what fields did the boys go into?",
        "A: They\u2019re both engineers. Their father is an engineer.",
        "Q: Like their father.",
        "A: They\u2019re both in computers. And when the three of them get together, I go to the\nkitchen -- no. No, I -- we have a computer and I know how to handle it. So --",
        "Q: What about your ola -- I know what I wanted to ask you. Is there a point at which\nyou can recall where you began to feel that you were an American?",
        "A: I wanted so badly to put everything behind me, that I think it -- it\u2019s -- it came\ninstantly. First of all, I spoke the eng -- I spoke the language, quite comfortably. And",
        "Q: How did you come to learn English so well?",
        "A: Well, I was a good student at school. I had six years of English, not like the\nUnited States where you have one year of French and then you drop it all. When we\nhad a language, we had it for six years. I had six years of English, I had -- this -- to\nthat, we were bilingual at home, or trilinguals. F -- Alsatian and French and I\ncouldn\u2019t understand German and I study at home. I learned Hebrew in Hebrew\nschool. I learned Latin, English and Greek simultaneously. I had six years of Latin\nand six years of English. And I\u2019m not totally mixed up, but I am -- I\u2019m doing fairly\nwell with language and so when I got my scholarship, my coworker was just -- if not\nmore qualified than I was, to get a scholarship, but she had no English. And I had not\nspoken English since I left school. This is 1946 and I left school in \u201838. I had not\nspoken English. And I was -- my English was good enough to make straight A\u2019s in\ngraduate school at Tulane. But it was lousy to go and -- every day living. I never\nraised my hand in class. I could write, but I couldn\u2019t really express myself. And I\ncouldn\u2019t order anything in a c -- restaurant or anything, for a long time. But when I\ncame back and we were married, there was not a problem. I remember kids in\ndaycare laughing at me because in saying -- saying Bobby, I said booby. You know,\nand they laughed because an O 1s an O and not a R, you know? It\u2019s not Bobby, it\u2019s\nbooby. And I learned to disregard French phonetics and -- little by little. How did I\nfeel -- I remember -- I don\u2019t even remember being sworn in, but I remember I became\na citizen after five years. That\u2019s technical. And it\u2019s interesting that while we lived in\nFrance for three years, recently -- I mean, that\u2019s 15 years ago. Gosh, it\u2019s 17 years\nago. And I was very happy to be there. I enjoyed it, however, as an American. It was\nnot -- I loved to go there, but boy I -- this is home. Oh, totally. And --",
        "Q: And ho-how do you account for that?",
        "A: My life\u2019s been here, the majority of my life, all -- I mean, I was 26 when I came\nand I\u2019m 78 now. Many more years here. My kids are here, but mostly my\ngrandchildren are here. My profession is here. My -- I don\u2019t even have the\nprofessional language to discuss anything in French, you know? I -- I couldn\u2019t -- my\n-- my French 1s -- is very good and when we lived near France I had a ball, because I\nconfused everybody by saying that I was American and speaking French very well.\nYou know, that kind of jo -- but -- and I enjoyed every moment we were there. I\nmissed a lot of the co -- house ease and comfort that we have in America because\neverything is -- was a little more complicated there. Although we had everything we\nneeded. But home is here, coming back to my kids and to m -- I mean, my kids live\nmiles away, but this is where I c-can express my thoughts, my feelings. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m\nnot much a student any more in France, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah. D-Do you feel safer here? I-Is that an element at all?",
        "A: No, mm-mm. I felt just as safe in Israel, at midnight in Jerusalem. I do -- I mean,\noh, I feel safe in France, it was just as well -- as safe. In France --",
        "Q: Now I\u2019m not referring to personal street crime.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: I\u2019m referring to safety as a Jew.",
        "A: Oh, no. I\u2019m --",
        "Q: Do you feel -- I mean, do you feel like a -- it\u2019s possible something like that could\nhappen again in Europe and not here?",
        "A: No. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. No, I -- I -- I don\u2019t think so. But there is something that --\nthat gets in the way in France or in -- in European countries and -- and everywhere.\nI'd have to tell you an experience that I had last year. When I am in France and of\ncourse in Germany, and -- but in Germany we only have gone because of this\ncathartic trip for my husband, to go back to his hometown and ex -- w-we went -- I\nwent with him once first to the cemetery and it was a very important trip for him to\nreconnect. He wa -- his family was a very prominent family there and their house still\nexists. It\u2019s divided in four apartments, so it was a very substantial place and father\nwas very prominent there. When I am --",
        "Q: Wh-What happened to his father? Oh, his father died [indecipherable]",
        "A: His father died and his mother was deported. His mother died, we found out just\nabout three years ago, through the Holocaust Museum, where she died. She was\ndeported from the village in which she grew up, into Hanover. She never made it out\nof Germany. She finally got the papers to leave. We don\u2019t know why she waited so\nlong. By the time she decided, it was too late to get papers and she was eventually\nput in the Riga ghetto in Latvia and then from Riga, she was then put into labor camp\nin Stutthof and through the Holocaust Museum\u2019s library, we were able to get in touch\nwith a place in Stutthof, a -- a museum that they erected on the camp, that Stutthof\ncamp and they sent us copy of a page of a ledger which shows her name and her date\nof death in Stutthof, in a camp. In December, 1944, the war was over in France and\nshe still died there. She was in her 50 -- must have been a very strong --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Museum Me -- this is a\ncontinuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Simone\nLipman. This is tape number four, side A.",
        "A: -- in December, 1944, the war was over in France and she still died there. She was\nin her 50 -- must have been a very strong woman to last that long. For the longest\ntime we thought that she had been -- we knew that Stutthof camp had put all their\nstill alive internees on barges and drowned them at sea when the Russians advanced.\nAnd so we had always been tha -- under that impression that\u2019s what happened to her.\nBut the stutta -- the camp museum sent us a book, all in Polish, which somebody\ntranslated for us -- not translate, but read for us and then came to the conclusion that\nshe must have died of a typhoid breakout at that time, in December 23, where most\nof the people died. So, why am I telling you all of this? Oh, going to Europe -- when\nI deal with people my age, and that has been true -- they were my age 50 years ago --\nI mean, 30 year ago and I went to France. My -- my unspoken question is, where\nwere you during the war? Now, that\u2019s a question I don\u2019t ask here. And so that\u2019s --\nthat\u2019s something that exists a little bit less now, because I\u2019ve gone back to Europe\nmore often. And I had an interesting experience, we went back -- when we lived in\nFrance, between \u201883 and \u201886, I went back to the farm my parents had lived in during\nthe war and where I lived with them for not quite a year [indecipherable]. And found\nthe place and the people were very nice, let us come into the farm and we were there.\nBut, prior to that, I -- I have to backtrack, we stayed in a hotel. It\u2019s one of these\nchateaux that put up tourists. And in the very place where my father had been in a\ncamp, in Teeveeai blast, my father had been in a camp for a brief period. And all the\ntime I\u2019m there, I\u2019m saying to myself -- th-the owner of the -- the owner of the camp\nwas my age, I said, where was he when my father was in camp, in Teeveeai, right\nhere? Was he in the chateau, where was he -- doing? And I\u2019m uncomfortable. And\nthen the next morning we were on -- on -- on the way to -- on the farm, the next\nmorning, you know, what I just described to you, going back to the farm where my\nparents had lived, and so the owner there said to me -- no, the wife s -- the owner\u2019s\nwife said to me, \u201cWhere you off to today?\u201d You know, just chat. I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going\non a pilgrimage.\u201d And she says, \u201cOh, you\u2019re going to Oradure.\u201d Oradure siran is a\nvillage which is very famous in that terrible thing that happened in the end of the\nwar, when France -- the Germans took the whole population of Oradure, put them in\na church and put a match to it. And that\u2019s become a pilgrimage place. I said, \u201cNo,\nI\u2019m going to the place where my parents were hiding during the war.\u201d I said -- well,\nyou know, just kind of spill it out. And she said, \u201cOh. They were -- my husband was\nin the resistance and he was in camp so and so as a member of the resistance.\u201d Well,\neverything cleared, you know? No more -- but until I know where --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- where were you. It happened to me once in the States, when there was -- in a --\nin a group, the French speaking group in Cleveland, which I -- or in Syracuse, I\nforget where, which I joined for a very brief period, there was one woman who was\nfrom Germany and she talked about being in Strasbourg during the war -- where? In\nmy house? Where? I couldn\u2019t connect. I couldn\u2019t. It was a very brief kind of thing.\nSo I have this in Europe, which I don\u2019t have when I\u2019m here.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And last year I had an incredible experience. We went -- usually we go on -- we\ndon\u2019t travel on our own, but we thought we could handle tha -- we go on tours or we\ngo in elder hostels or things like that, but I -- I wanted to see Prague and Budapest\nand we did it on our own. And with a lot of soul searching, we decided to include\nVienna, which ain\u2019t so easy for us. Well, we only spend a night or two there and after\nall, you know, the war is over, you can\u2019t hold it forever and you know, the whole\nreasoning. And so, in Prague, and in order to be understood, you speak German,\nbecause I don\u2019t do Czech and -- so we spoke German. And it\u2019s run over with German\ntourists and in the hotel you s -- you use German. And it didn\u2019t bother me and -- and\nyou know, this is a practical thing to do. Then we took a train to Vienna and we had\nthis very comfortable compartment, with -- and a woman from South Africa or\nAustralia. Anyway, it was a very pleasant first class compartment. We never travel\nfirst class, but our travel agent said, \u201cYou stay in a Eastern Euro-European country,\nyou better upgrade yourself. So we are there, we arrive at the border of Austria, the\ntrain stops and there is passport control. And this border guy -- I don\u2019t know what\nyou call it -- officer, comes in, very innocuous looking young man, with a khaki shirt\nand a khaki pants and some -- some -- something on him and in German asks us for\nour papers. And I broke down. I handed him -- I handed him my passport and I felt\nmy tears running down. This was a German, speaking German, asking me for my\npapers. Were they going to be fake? Was I going to be arrested? Was I going to make\nit? I surprised myself totally, my having tears running down my sh -- so it\u2019s still\nthere. In spite of all the talking, reading, doing, I ma -- I couldn\u2019t believe it. I -- I -- I\njust couldn\u2019t believe it. It wasn\u2019t just one thing, it -- the -- the Gestalt of the whole\nthing.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So, being in Europe is, in this way, different from being in America. Not safer,\njust different. [inaudible]",
        "Q: No, I think that\u2019s a very -- a --a very good description.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And I think it\u2019s an important distinction.",
        "A: Yeah, oh, I -- I have to think about -- it -- it\u2019s something that -- that\u2019s there. I\nmean, it -- as I\u2019m getting older, there are fewer people of my age there, so they only\nchoo --",
        "Q: But [Il tell -- I -- I -- I -- just to share something with you, you know, I -- as I -- I\nmentioned to you before, to --",
        "A: You went to Poland?",
        "Q: To Poland in April and that\u2019s the first time I ever went to Europe, anywhere.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: I never went to Europe before. And -- and I had some mixed feelings about going\nto Poland. As it happens, my father has a very close associate, a fr -- an old -- an old\nfriend who was from -- from Warsaw, Jewish doctor, a woman who survived the war,\nwhose parents did not. And she was out of Warsaw when the war came.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And she lives there now, she committed herself to staying and living there. And so\nI\u2019ve been in touch with her and she\u2019s invited me to come many times, but I\u2019ve never\ngone. And so I was intrigued about going there and I -- and I just want to go to this\nparticular conference because they were people who do what I do on radio, from all\nover Europe.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Meeting that just happened to be meeting there. But th-there was this -- I had a\nsimilar reaction, which is I\u2019m looking around at everybody, I\u2019m looking at the few\nJews that are left in Poland -- and I went and did an interview with a -- a young man\na little bit older than me, in his late 40\u2019s, who runs the only Jewish magazine\npublished in Poland.",
        "A: Yeah, Jewish what?",
        "Q: Jewish magazine.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: That was started just a couple of years ago, after Communists --",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- were out of power, that he was allowed to form a -- a magazine.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And I met a German conductor, who was a -- who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Leonard\nBernstein\u2019s --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- who happened to be conducting a concert in -- in Warsaw that week. But I was\nasking the same questions everywhere I went. And then loo -- and then we were\nstanding, looking at all these older peasants from around Warsaw and I\u2019m thi -- the\nwhole time, I was wondering the same thing. You know, well what were they --\nwhere were they and what were they doing? And --",
        "A: You know, when we went to Germany, we -- this while we were in France, it was,\nwell, our 35th anniversary and we invited our kids to come on over, too. And -- our\nsons with their wives. They were -- was married, but had no children. I would like to\nduplicate it with the kids, but it\u2019s getting too big and I\u2019m getting too -- I can\u2019t handle\nthat many people at a time. But anyway, we went into Germany -- I mean first we\nwent Alsace, I showed them where my parents lived, where I went when I went to\nschool, where my grandparents lived. We showed them all of that. Also went to the\ncemetery and saw the monument to the Holocaust, all that kind of thing. And went\ninto Germany and Mart-Martin was very determined, we\u2019re just going to go. I don\u2019t\nwant to talk to anybody and we\u2019re going to go just to see the place and show the\nchildren where my house was, the cemetery, the school and synagogue and so on --\nwhich doesn\u2019t exist any more. And then we\u2019re going -- we\u2019re driving back, I had\n[indecipherable] the whole itinerary, I had all the reservations. We were going to just\nbreathe as little of the air as we could and speak a little German as we could and just\ndo it, because it -- 1t was an ex -- valid -- valid experience for our children, to see\nwhere their father grew up. And then -- w-we went two cars and our son flagged us\ndown and said, \u201cYou know, this has been a long drive, we -- I don\u2019t think we can\nmake it back to France today. We are very tired.\u201d And then he asked, \u201cDo you think\nDad would mind if we spend another night in Germany?\u201d They were so aware of\nthat. And we said, \u201cNo, what\u2019s -- that\u2019s okay, if we can get a room,\u201d -- we were in\nHeidelberg. And we got a hotel, we needed three rooms and we got three rooms and\nwe went there and the kids went of their own way. We just wanted each our own\nspace a little bit and they wanted to do their thing. And Martin and I walked around\nin Heidelberg. But the kids were conscious of the fact that another night in Germany\nwas maybe more that their father could countenance. And you know what, we said,\n\u201cGee, this is a beautiful city, darn it.\u201d And so we have transmitted our children this,\nthey are aware of it. But it doesn\u2019t stop them from -- I don\u2019t know, maybe buying\nsomething German or -- which ts -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m very aware of that, I cannot buy\nsomething German. But, it doesn\u2019t make sense. Israel buys stuff from Germany. In\nEurope you cannot separate things -- Germany or Belgium or anywhere else, it\u2019s the\nEuropean stuff, why can\u2019t you do it? But here, I could no more buy a bottle of\nGerman wine than I could fly to the moon. I mean, it\u2019s just, I can\u2019t do it. It -- It\u2019s --\nit\u2019s not from the head, 1t comes from below, you know? So -- so th-that\u2019s the\ndifference in -- when I\u2019m in Europe. It\u2019s not the safety, it\u2019s the awareness of the\nhistory, I think.",
        "Q: Yeah. [indecipherable] the memory of -- I -- I -- one of my first cars that I bought\nwas a -- an old Peugeot and I was -- it was -- needed to be repaired all the time. And\nonce I was -- it was really old, I mean it wa -- had like about a hundred thousand\nmiles when I bought it. But I was in the shop once, waiting for it to get repaired and\nwas a man sitting next to me and he looked at me, he says, \u201cSo you\u2019re in for another\nrepair, huh?\u201d And I said, \u201cYeah.\u201d And he says, \u201cYeah, me too,\u201d he says, \u201cbut Ill\nnever buy a Mercedes.\u201d And then he looked at me and he rolled up his sleeve and\nshowed me his tattoo. And that was all he had to say, you know, was just --",
        "A: Mm-hm. But you know, the streets in Israel -- have you been to Israel?",
        "Q: No, P\u2019ve never been there. I\u2019d like to go there.",
        "A: There are plenty of German cars and Israel has -- has given Israel a lot of money. I\nmean, it\u2019s a very personal kind of thing.",
        "Q: Yeah, it\u2019s complicated.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: It\u2019s hard. How -- how would you say -- well, what we did is, on the list of things\nthat they suggest that we -- there are thing -- I mean w-wh-what -- what they\u2019re\ninterested in 1s your perception of political events that are taking place over the -- you\nknow, the past 40 or 50 years. And when -- wha -- I mean, there\u2019s like a million\nthings to talk about. But one thing, if there are things from your experience that\nwould have affected the way that you -- you know, I mean this -- I can show you the\nlist, 1t\u2019s the atomic bomb, the war -- war -- I just -- I guess war in general.",
        "A: I -- [remember very vividly, I couldn\u2019t vote then, but I do remember when I --\nwhen Eisenhower was elected, what was that, \u201850? \u201851? Something like that.\nAnyway, I\u2019m not very good at history. And here we\u2019re getting a Republican after all\nthese Democratic thing. I thought that everything was going to change. And\nMcCarthy was interviewing, I mean the -- the anti-American kind of hearings were\ngoing on. That scared me. I thought that with a new president who was going to be a\nRepublican, versus all -- we had FDR, Truman, all that before. And then I found out\nlife went on and nothing changed very much. But I was scared at the time. As for the\nbomb, I was very involved at the time, the atomic bomb. I was very involved in the\nban the bomb kind of thing, because -- I remember marching in the -- in the marches\nwith my son in the -- in the -- a stroller. And Dr. Spock was in Cleveland and Dr.\nSpock -- actually, I consulted with him once, in my professional work and he used\nthe same car repair dealer as we did and so my sons knew that this was the doctor\nwho had written the book that I looked at when he was sick, so he -- he knew who\nDr. Spock was. But, anyway, he was -- was, this woman called Sane, it was a --\nbecame active in that. I\u2019m not a very -- and my husband isn\u2019t either, we are not the\ndemonstration kind of people, marching kind of thing. But that I mi -- I mean, we\ndon -- we tend to support causes by giving money or even by writing letters and now\nby e-mail. My husband does more of that than I do. But we are not the -- the\ndemonstration kind of thing. Is that the English word or 1s it manifesti -- in French\nit\u2019s manifestation. Yeah, it\u2019s demonstration.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And so -- but that -- that -- I -- I du -- at the time of the bomb, since I was also\ninvolved with young children and I had all this fall-out kind of thing, so I -- I did -- I\ndid march.",
        "Q: Yeah. You mentioned something interesting before that -- that struck me, which\nwas your empathy or sympathetic reaction to seeing other refugees.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Which is not -- I -- I don\u2019t know, I mean what -- I me -- my perception\u2019s not\nalways the case with people that have gone through the Holocaust. I mean there are\nsome --",
        "A: See, this has -- has nothing to do so much with the Holoc -- people in the\nHolocaust, the-they were sent to camps. I -- what I\u2019m talking about is we were\nexpelled -- this is the other piece in the experien -- we lived in the border of France\nand then almost at the border of Belgium, Holland. You know, Belgium and France.\nMy parents had left Strasbourg and the whole popul -- if you remember my early\npaper -- my early recording, Strasbourg had been evacuated.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then -- and my parents didn\u2019t go with the mobs down in the south side of\nFrance. They found their own place, probably a hundred miles west of Strasbourg --\nin -- in Lorraine, in a place called Glammer. And so when the war came -- when the -\n- not when the war came, when the invasion came, we were in the war, but nothing\nwas going, it was the phony war and in the phony war, nothing was going on and we\nwere waiting for something to happen. And what happened is that the Germans went\naround the maginno line and they invaded Belgium and Holland and poured into\nFrance. And we had to leave. People were taking to the roads. I don\u2019t know if I sa --\nrecorded this, but we -- it was a Shabbat morning, my mother had cooked all the\nmeals for Shabbat. They had never been in a car on a Shabbat and we had a car. And\nwhatever we could, we loaded on top of the car. Couple of mattresses, whatever food\nwe had which was already prepared. And we left in the great [indecipherable] just\nlike the people you see on the roads.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Except that we had a car. So that\u2019s a piece of my personal experience in France,\nwhich may not be at all related to experience of people who went into concentration\ncamp. That\u2019s different.",
        "Q: But there\u2019s a -- I think you\u2019re -- you\u2019re -- th-that\u2019s a very important distinction.\nBut there\u2019s something else that I -- in a more general way --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: I think that there are some Jews who are more able to -- I\u2019m not -- I don\u2019t have the\n-- the words aren\u2019t coming. There are some Jews who are able to empathize with\nother peoples --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- and other struggles, and other people --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- who are suffering. And there are some Jews who are more inward and say, \u201cI\nhave to worry only about Jews.\u201d",
        "A: Yeah, is it good for the Jews?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Yeah, I guess there are two, I don\u2019t know. Do you want to ask me where\nI fit in between?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I think actu -- I think I\u2019m more open to suffering in general, I think. Yeah, I really\nthink so, when I think of all the causes we support. But I think the main -- but also,\nwe also do a great deal to support our own. Probably -- probably our main -- I think\nof our charities, for instance.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It starts with home, it starts with our own community, where we see our needs.\nBecause what we haven\u2019t touched upon, and it probably doesn\u2019t fit in your questions,\nbut I\u2019m going to touch upon it now. Retirement started in Chapel Hill, here. And we\nliterally touched the ground running and became active immediately in community\nwork. And when I mean community, I mean the Jewish community. This is a very\nsmall Jewish community of no business -- no Jewish businesses, it\u2019s all academic or\nresearch or it\u2019s university or the research, Triangle Park and there\u2019s literally no\nJewish businesses here. So when we came, there was a volunt -- a group of\nvolunteers raising funds for the UJ and a bunch of volunteers having a program for\nsome elderly people. That\u2019s all -- well, there was a Hillel on the campus and that kind\nof thing, was a Haddassah. But there\u2019s no organized communit -- there were two\nsynagogue. And I\u2019ve been part, from the beginning, of a creation of a Jewish family\nserver. So, what I\u2019m saying is my -- this was my -- although at first I didn\u2019t know\nwhere to put my volunteer energies, it became -- I\u2019m what -- 60 -- 66 years old and of\ncourse I can take classes and I can do -- which we did, right away from the\nbeginning. But I wanted to -- I wanted to be active and I wa -- vare -- I didn\u2019t know\nwhere to start. I went to Red Cross and I went -- and I went to the research\n[indecipherable] to the -- because I speak a few languages, maybe I could help them.\nBut none of this was satisfactory. And then by chance I had met somebody who said,\n\u201cOh, there is a group that\u2019s trying to hire a social worker to get started with the\nelderly, because it can no longer be done on a voluntary basis and one thing leading\nto the other, before I knew it, a few years late -- a few years later I was chairman of\nthe Jewish Family Service and I\u2019m still active on this committee. I was charge of the\nRussian resettlement program here and I\u2019m still in charge of that. We don\u2019t resettle\nanybody any more, but I\u2019m still active in that. And I am still immersed 100% in this.\nSo, yeah, if you wish charit -- my empathy -- I was much -- it was much more\nsatisfactory to -- first of all, it\u2019s my professional background that -- my skills came in\nhandy 1n there -- than to go to Red Cross and when people donate blood to, you\nknow, give them a cookie or something like that. I couldn\u2019t relate to that. And I was\ndoing Meals on Wheels. I continued Meals on Wheels, which is not a Jewish\nprogram, for the longest time. But then it -- the schedule interfered with something\nelse and I dropped -- but for five years I was delivering meals to the general\ncommunity here. So I don\u2019t limit it to the Jewish community.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But then, as the community activities became more important -- and they have\nbeen, it\u2019s been absolutely wonderful, because I work not only -- I work with younger\npeople, instead of being with my peers all the time and my experience is given some\nvalidation and my community\u2019s help. And so both my husband and I -- he spent the\nwhole day today at Hillel, because of some kind -- but thank God it\u2019s only 12\nminutes from here, so he can go running back and forth. And that morning, the first\nthing I talked with the social worker and at Jewish Family Service -- number one I\nhired her, so I know her very well. Number two, she asked me to do a -- to take care\nof some difficult situation on a voluntary basis and I report [indecipherable]. And so\nwe\u2019re constantly involved with this kind of thing.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And this is so -- yeah, I\u2019m -- I mean I empathize with problems mi -- in -- in -- in\nthe -- the -- outside the Jewish community, but I think my emphasis is inside the\nJewish community. So, does that answer your question?",
        "Q: Yeah, in general, but I -- I mean -- but I -- but I -- my -- na -- lik-like where --\nwhat were your -- nawa -- d-do you think that your -- that your experiences shaped\nyour general reaction and general ideas about war?",
        "A: Oh yes, definitely.",
        "Q: And could you describe -- talk about that?",
        "A: A-And this is what I -- I think one of the messages that I give the kids when I talk\nto -- especially the younger children -- I talk to them mostly about not speaking up\nwhen there is injustice or preyudice. You know, for evil to -- for evil to flourish, it\njust -- Just take one good man not to talk or sa -- I\u2019m misquoting it, but you know\nwhat I\u2019m talking about, not speaking up and -- now, of course they cannot write to\ntheir senators, but they can be aware of injustice, even in their school situations. And\nthey can be aware of prejudice and that kind of thing and then that\u2019s what I talk to\nthem about and then that\u2019s not a Jewish notion, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a general, universal no -- so\nI -- and when people say it can happen here, I really don\u2019t believe it, but\ntheoretically, it could happen anywhere. And so this is the message I -- I gave the\nchildren. But I\u2019m not sitting at home worrying about war.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I\u2019m -- I think it\u2019s dreadful, what\u2019s happening in the world nowadays. Again, it\nstarted all over again today in -- in Rwanda and in -- in Bosnia it continues, it\u2019s so\nwrong. And one feels totally helpless and then the univer -- and the world\ncommunity is totally helpless.",
        "Q: Does this -- does it -- it\u2019s funny, my own perception is -- I mean, first of all, when\nI think about the -- the Jewish Holocaust and the number of people that were\nexecuted and the way it was done and there\u2019s the -- the whole -- I -- the only thing\nthat I can think is hi -- 1-is -- and a -- and it was one of the questions I asked you\nearlier, which was h-how did -- how did it escalate in -- in people\u2019s minds -- y-you\nknow, from the victim\u2019s minds, how it escalated?",
        "A: Yeah. I -- I -- I don\u2019t know. It -- I -- I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I -- I really don\u2019t know how. I think that there are s -- maybe people have this --\nthere is this -- all these hidden revenges and hidden thoughts and hidden blaming and\n-- that are -- are given -- given ventilation, I mean are able to -- they\u2019re able to\nventilate, they come out.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. One of the messages -- something you said remind me of another\nmessage that I always give the children. They always say, you know, it\u2019s a bat -- or 1s\na genocide here, you know, there is a Holocaust there and it\u2019s true, there are -- there\nare genocides and -- going on and there are mass murders going on all over the world\nthese day, whether it\u2019s Bosnia or Rwanda or ethnic cleansing anywhere. But never --\nI tell them, remember, never has there been a plan made to systematically destroy a\nwhole people. It was done in Germany. I don\u2019t have to tell them about the Wannsee\nConference or whatever they -- their -- their history isn\u2019t that --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- they don\u2019t know that -- that [indecipherable]. But it happens elsewhere that\nwhole ethnic groups are being destroyed and being eliminated. But it happens in sort\nof a spontaneous and on a different kind of internal war kind of thing. But this was an\nindustrial plan of elimination, with industrial weapons to do it. And in -- I -- I\u2019ve\nseen a reenactment of the Wannsee conference on television. It is absolutely\nunbearable. And so they -- I want to give that message, that this -- in this way, the\nHolocaust 1s different. And I don\u2019t usually use the word Holocaust, I use the word\nShoah.

        "A: Did I talk about having met her in Paris?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Oh, that is another fantastic story. And that -- you know, ilch -- my friend\nCharlotte, who was arrested when I was freed, I never been in touch with her. I didn\u2019t\nhave -- I once asked for her address, when a -- a mutual friend and I wrote to her and\nI never heard from her. So I said -- part of me said she\u2019s mad at me because I was\nliber -- freed and she was arrested. But I let -- dropped the thing, I mean it didn\u2019t -- it\n-- it just disappeared from my memory. And then we went and had that reunion. I\nsaid, \u201cCan anybody tell me if Charlotte is here? How would I recognize her?\u201d And\nwe met. And the f -- we hugged and the first thing she said, \u201cNow we can have that\npiece of pastry together. We never had it, because we were arrested together.\u201d I said,\n\u201cWhat do you mean? We first had the pastry and it\u2019s when we walked out of the\npastry shop that we were arrested.\u201d And here we were arguing about that. Secondly\nshe said, \u201cYou know, I felt very guilty. We had no business being seen together.\u201d\nBecause she looked very Jewish and she said, \u201cWe had no --\u201d she was not on our\nunderground network, she was doing some other kind of work. She said, \u201cWe had no\nbusiness being seen together. It -- I was compromising you.\u201d And I compromised\nmyself by being with her. And this is how our reunion took place, arguing over\npastry. But then she told me how she got liberated. She was put into jail and knew\nthat in the infirmary of that jail, there was a nurse who worked with the resistance. So\nher goal was to get into that ner -- infirmary. So she pretended to have a toothache,\nvery bad toothache and she had two teeth pulled, two perfectly good teeth pulled and\n-- you know, because she complained about it and all the treatment they had was to\npull the teeth. And the nurse helped her escape. That\u2019s how it happened. So it took\nme almost 50 years to find out -- exactly 50 years to find out.",
        "Q: And where did she go after?",
        "A: Oh, th -- she was -- she was part of a -- working with Ose and different kind of\nthing. When the war was over she worked as a social worker with one of the Jewish\nagencies in Paris. And so we aged paralleling. And -- but that was the reunion, so that\nwas the first time, took us 50 years to reconnect.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And I tell that story to the kids and they -- they love that story. Makes it real, you\nknow?",
        "Q: Yeah. Do you still talk -- keep 1n touch?",
        "A: No. Mm-mm, mm-mm. No. We -- we chatted, but --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s too many people -- too many thing and then our lives have taken so many\ndifferent courses, I mean it\u2019s just im-impossible to do that.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2019'm not a very good corresponder. Pick up the phone easier, but -- so I had never\nseen her before, no.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] There was one thing on your interview I wa -- two things I\nwanted you to -- [indecipherable] I mean, to see if they\u2019re still pertinent. I just wrote\nthe pages down.",
        "A: I guess we haven\u2019t gone according to any plan. We have just -- it has just\nemerged, right?",
        "Q: Well, yeah, more or less. I -- well, I had some of a plan [inaudible]",
        "A: Had to get me back on track.",
        "Q: I -- Ihave found -- I mean, I -- I don\u2019t know how it appears to you, that it -- that\nappears completely discombobulated and random, I apologize. But I have found that\nit\u2019s better to try to initiate conversations and for me to listen --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- than to follow a strict order of questions.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Be -- things are interconnected, it\u2019s very difficult to put it in categories.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. And every time -- because now I have a whole series of general\nthemes about what to ask you about and every time you start talking about one, I was\nthinking about another one [indecipherable]",
        "A: And other things came into my mind as I was talking to you, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Yeah. No, the funny thing 1s, I look over the -- the things that Arwin asked me to\nmake sure we touched about and we\u2019ve talked about almost all of them. Oh yeah, I --\nI just want -- there\u2019s -- there\u2019s -- take a look at this. This was -- I just wanted you to\nelaborate on this and this is almost a professional question for when you\u2019re\n[indecipherable]. Y-You were talking about the -- coaching children and giving them\nnew identities.",
        "A: Yeah. Oh, this is interesting, what you underlined was when I did my -- when I\ndid my interview in France with Ose, my oral history, in French and I -- the director\nof Ose, who was the woman I had worked with in camp, colleague of mine, she\nimmedi -- wrote to me and said, \u201cI read your -- I read your interview and you say\nexactly the same thing that I have always felt.\u201d She became a professional social\nworker, I developed more professionally. And all we had to do -- all -- all we could\ndo is produce the cards, look at the suitcases, empty the profe -- th -- th -- the\npersonal things to make a child safe, in order to survive. And we had no time to\nprepare them, to ask them how they feel. The kind of things I would do as a\nprofessional therapist, to avoid the trauma of going into a new situation without\nhaving say good-bye to their parents, without knowing where their parents were.\nWith leaving behind everything? I mean, these are traumatic situations which, under\nnormal circumstance, I would take weeks to prepare a child for. I didn\u2019t have 24\nhours. And I couldn\u2019t let these thoughts even -- if -- even if they had existed and I\nwas not professional enough to have these thou -- even if they had existed, I couldn\u2019t\nhave had -- let them intrude upon me in my mind. I had to tell a child, \u201cYou are no\nlonger so and so, you are so and so. Remember now, give me your name.\u201d No, I had\nto -- \u201cI have to take your suitcase away, because it has your name on it.\u201d I didn\u2019t say,\n\u201cHow do you feel about my taking your suit --\u201d I mean, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking\nabout.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The -- the profe -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t know enough about -- about how to\ndeal with trauma, otherwise I would have been hampered in -- in my moving fast and\nso we saved kids life. And on the whole, I think that in many ways, when I read --\nthere have been some studies made on the children, the hidden children. More and\nmore there has been. It\u2019s interesting. The -- the first people to speak after the\nHolocaust were the survivors. It took them a long time to talk and they began to talk\nabout their experiences. And then the children of survivors talked of their -- what\nthey had in common. And it -- and other groups at different times. Now, for instance,\nthere were also the children of deportees, that\u2019s more in Europe, that\u2019s not here,\nbecause we don\u2019t have that many children here, of people who were deported. And\nthen, only very recently, the -- the children who were hidden, sort of felt -- there\u2019s a\nwhole group of them, they have something in common. And they didn\u2019t speak and I\nask -- I know -- there\u2019s one here -- I mean, there are several here in Chapel Hill, but\nthere is one I know fairly well. And she only recently came out of the closet and she\nsay, \u201cI\u2019m talking about it.\u201d And she said, \u201cQuite often this was painful.\u201d Of course,\nshe lost her parents while she was in hiding and then she stayed with some relatives\nand well -- came to this country, whatever, I don\u2019t know all the details. But she says\nalso, \u201cSince we survived, we didn\u2019t feel that we had a voice in all of this. I mean, we\nwere not victims, we survived.\u201d And now, all of a sudden, they feel they have\nsomething to talk about, because they indeed were victims and they have a lot in\ncommon. And so now there are the hidden children coming out of the woodwork.\nThey have -- they had a big meeting of the hi -- children hidden by Ose in Miami two\nyears ago. I didn\u2019t go to that one. And there is a newsletter and I\u2019m on the mailing\nlist and I -- there 1s one -- a huge one in Israel. And these kids find they have\nsomething in common, because they were hidden and they had their losses and so\nforth and so on. And -- why am I telling you that, I lost my train of thought. Where\nwe are at?",
        "Q: Well, we were talking about the -- the level of trauma that people ha -- deal with\nand your perception of the trauma.",
        "A: Yeah, and that -- but -- a-and the studies, yeah, what I wanted to say is that there\nwere studies made of how these children have adjusted. There\u2019s one I have from\nFrance and you know, they don\u2019t do any worse or better than the general population.\nThey have their share of successes and of divorces and of failed businesses and -- and\nof successes. They -- they really don\u2019t differ statistically from the general population,\nnot that the general population is doing that well in -- you know, I mean it\u2019s ver --\nthey doing very normally. And then -- and one -- as one of the surviving -- one of the\nhidden children in Paris told me, \u201cHey, we didn\u2019t do so badly, you know, considering\nwhat we gone through. Why do you think this is so?\u201d And I gave her my\ninterpretation and I said that considering that what is very important is just after the\nvery early years of a child\u2019s life, let\u2019s say the first -- some say it\u2019s the first two, some\nsay it\u2019s the first two, whatever it 1s. Most of these children came from intact,\nnurturing families. And what happened to them, happened to the whole family and\nnot within the family. So that they survived more psychologically intact, actually. If\nyou understand what I mean? To -- children are -- there are many children today who\nare dysfunctional because of the pathology within the family. Because of parents who\ndon\u2019t get along or -- or whatever it is, or parents who divorce or -- or all kinds of\nthings that happen inside the family. What happened to these kids -- and -- and so\nthey lose their nurturing, their loo -- they lose all the si -- sense of stability, they lose\na sense of -- of security and what have you. But what happened to these hidden kids\nis that they had good, solid years, early childhood, of nurturing and of -- of -- of -- of\n-- as -- a Stable family situation and they don\u2019t perceive their parents as the\nperpetrators of terrible things. It is -- it happened to the entire family. And, if\nanything, they become concerned about their parents -- about the fate of their parent.\nI ha -- when we\u2019re finished with this, I want to show you a absolutely devastating\nbook. I have a book, I think it\u2019s two telephone books of -- that are the children that\nwere deported from France. The -- this put together by Serge Clarksfeld and his wife.\nDoes the name mean anything? Serge Clarksfeld is a lawyer whose parents were\ndeported and he devoted his life t -- he is the one who bought Barbie to France, he\nand his wife brought Barbie. His wife is German and not Jewish and they have\ndevoted their life to hunt the perpetrators and war criminals. In the first book he\nwrote, it was a -- a -- Barbie is -- is very famous for rounding up a whole children\u2019s\nhome called Eezure. It was not directly an Ose home, but related to Ose and we had\nworkers in there. And here wa -- this was in spring of 1944, April 1944, it was almost\nover and he rounded up the staff and the children and except for one boy, who\nhappened to visit there and was left off the truck because he was not Jewish,\neverybody was sent to Auschwitz. Nobody survived, none of the kids, except one of\nthem -- one of the counselor -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not sure. But there is a mother of the\nchildren -- two mothers of the children with the Clarksfelds became active, first of all\nin founding rap -- Barbie and bringing him to trial and he was brought to trial while\nwe were living in France. And we were in front of the prison with each one of us\ncarrying a name of a child, big, big, big panels. And what his job was -- became --\nwas to investigate the identity of each of these children and get as much data on them\nand pictures of them, so we don\u2019t say 41 children, you say, Bobby and Suzy and\nEddie and -- and give them all a name and an identity and he published this book,\n\u201cThe Children of Eezure\u201d. And then he became to study the deportation list from\nFrance and cull out the children and try to find an identi -- when he published, all\nover the world. And he\u2019s put together the first of what he thinks is a series of books\nwhere he has pictures and stories about each one, and there were 10,000 children\ndeported from France. So he -- 1t was published in France and there was an exhibit in\nthe new school in New York and it was published by, I think the New York Press and\nit was available and so I got it. And they are not numbers, they\u2019re kids. And there\nyou can see from what loving, nurturing backgrounds they came. And now I think\nthis 1s what I\u2019m tr -- I\u2019m trying to talk about, what these kids went through, I just\ncouldn\u2019t address it, I just couldn\u2019t prepare them. I had to move very quickly. Does\nthat answer your question?",
        "Q: Very well, yes. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I have to tell you, one of the most -- there\nwere two things at Auschwitz that I saw that are similar. One -- one is that they have\nin some of the prison barracks, they have plaques all down the walls, with\nphotographs and little biographies, so that you see that these are people, that you --\nand you can sit there -- you could sit there the whole day and read about it.",
        "A: You go to Yad Vashem and you go into the children\u2019s [indecipherable].",
        "Q: And then there\u2019s a --",
        "A: It\u2019s only names.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Just names. And it goes on and on, it recite the names -- the names, you hear them\non -- we went into Prague, into one of the synagogues. There\u2019s nothing on the walls\nbut names, tiny little names. That\u2019s the one where Madeline Albright went to. I\ncouldn\u2019t go in.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I just couldn\u2019t. I had to stay out. I walked in and out, it was just too much.",
        "Q: Well, the other one tha -- the other thing that they have there at Auschwitz is one\nof the -- one of the buildings is devoted only to collections of things.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: And they have all these huge piles of shoes and eyeglasses. But the one that really\n[indecipherable] me is the whole room filled with children\u2019s shoes. I mean, the shoes\nare this big. And it\u2019s just un -- completely incomprehensible. I mean, even standing\nthere in the middle of Auschwitz and have to -- having seen all the adult ones, that\npeople could -- you know. And then, being a father and having two little children,\nyou just can\u2019t comprehend it.",
        "A: Nope.",
        "Q: I-It\u2019s not -- I -- it\u2019s something that I -- that I can\u2019t understand and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s part of\nthis question that I was asking you before, about trying to ope -- to come to grips\nnow with these other world situations, like in Bosnia or in Rwan-Rwanda, because I\nfeel -- those things feel so far away to me.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, they -- they are far away and at the same time you get so angry about\nbeing so helpless and that the world community is so helpless, with all the bodies we\nhave created, like NATO, like United Nation and all that. And yet, we still are\nhelpless. It\u2019s a little scary.",
        "Q: But you know, there\u2019s one more low -- there\u2019s one more little thing about you --\nin -- in -- in the story here, you said that the -- that -- that the day that you had to\nleave Strasbourg, your family, that you actually drove your neighbor\u2019s car.",
        "A: No, I -- that\u2019s not when we left Strasbourg, that\u2019s when we left Blamont, the place\nwhere my parents had already taken up resi -- we had, oh, they lived [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Oh, that was the second time?",
        "A: Yeah, the second time.",
        "Q: The second --",
        "A: The first time we left -- I mean, we were forced to leave but, it -- 1t wasn\u2019t because\nit was an inva -- it was still peace, there was no war yet. It was two days before the\nwar, two days. But in --",
        "Q: But that -- but the question I have for you, when you tell that story in the video\ntape, the -- I was -- my -- the -- the question that came to my mind was -- was that\nmoment a turning point for you? Was this something that was out of character for\nyou to do, drive a car?",
        "A: Well, I -- I ha -- I had just learned to drive, I mean, in those days, we had one car,\nobviously, it was my father\u2019s car for business. I never got a ride to school or anything\nlike that. We walked to everything or take the streetcar. So I never learned to ride it --\nmy -- and my brother used the car for -- help my father, he knew how to drive. So,\nmy brother would take our car, but the neighbors, as I said in my story, the neighbors\nhad a car. And the male in the family were in the army. There was nobody -- but\nthere was a car. You know, there was -- there was transportation, they get out from\nunder the German. There was nobody to drive it. So, I drove the neighbor\u2019s car. And\nthere was a handicapped girl and a grandmother in there. And it was totally in\ncharacter for me to do that, because I was a girl scout leader. In fact, I drove the car\nin my girl scout uniform, which in those days, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s today, was a\nkhaki uniform, with a khaki hat with all kinds of insignias and badges all over me.\nAnd that gave me an official status, because -- I mean, sometimes I -- sometimes\nmyself, I wa -- I wonder about it, but it was in character for me to do that. And I\nremember as we were on the road, there were -- there was my brother, there was me\nand there was two other -- two other Jewish families from bila -- from that town. We\nall traveled as a convoy, with people on the road and cars and the defeated army --\nFrench army and soldiers and va -- wagons and -- and at one intersection I was going\nto be separated from my brother. I didn\u2019t know where he was going. I don\u2019t know\nwhere we were going, we were going. We were leaving the Germans behind us. And\nI stopped the car and I got out on the road, with my khaki official uniform and I\nstopped all traffic and I went through. You know, was it out of -- I -- I -- I -- I was\npretty determined girl or -- alway -- you know, I had already left, actually. When my\nparents were in Bremel, I went to take a job in Paris as a -- as a early childhood -- in -\n- in early childhood. I was just 20 and when I got to the school there, outside of Paris,\nthe concierge who opened the door for me, asked me what grade I was in. You know,\nI was very young. But I took a job in Paris and my mother took very sick and I went\nhome and that\u2019s why I was home when the invasion started and it was a good thing I\nwas home, because we were all together leaving. But I was teaching in Paris with the\nbombing trails and we -- we had -- we -- we -- we were in the shelters and all that\nkind of stuff. No, it was not out of character for me to do that. I -- I wish I had known\nhow to drive better, but I got there. I got there -- I remember once we were going\nover some mountain -- there were mountains on the way and my car heating up and I\ndidn\u2019t know what to do. And the soldiers pushed me up the hill, you know, because\nthey were walking alongside. We didn\u2019t move farther than -- we didn\u2019t move very f -\n- very fast. And we kept on driving and every night by -- we had my grandmother\nwith me, we -- we found some shelter. We had all the Shabbas food hanging on the\ncar. We had it hanging over the car with -- and we found a bed for my grandmother,\nwe -- and then we slept wherever we could, and we were going and we left\neverything behind us. And we ended up somewhere where we stopped. And this is\nwhere -- this is where my experience is very special, because -- in a sense that the\npeople who were deported, I think didn\u2019t have that expulsion and that fleeing kind of\nexperience. And that\u2019s the one that early on, kind of gave me that empathy feeling for\n[inaudible |",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No, it was -- it was something that -- that I assumed, right, because I -- I was a -- I\n-- that was -- I was the leader of the girl scouts, I was a -- I was -- I did these things\nand I did some -- but let me such -- say one thing is that when we women, all\nprofessionals, all retired, all having worked in similar kinds of situati -- or even\ntogether during the war, at -- particularly in Rivesaltes -- when we talked about what\nwe had done, we old ladies really became scared. Our daring and our -- the things we\ndid. There\u2019s one word -- French word for it, we all used the same word and I\u2019ve been\ntrying to render it in English and I don\u2019t know exactly what it was -- [indecipherable]\nacrousion, you say bit, you were totally unconscious to do some things like that. But\nit doesn\u2019t render. It gets -- you out of your mind to do things like that. We were all on\nthe same wavelength and saying, \u201cMy God, did we take risk.\u201d And that risk taking\nscared us at this stage of our lives.",
        "Q: What -- wh -- you know, that was a -- one of the hav -- questions, I wanted to ask\nyou about this little story that you told later in the interview, and I think we\u2019ll be\ndone in a moment. It\u2019s this story where you -- you met this commissar and you told\nhim that you were working under a false name. I -- I didn\u2019t quite understand the --",
        "A: I don\u2019t understand it today, either, but --",
        "Q: But I don\u2019t understand what your -- what the -- the -- the impulse was of what --\nwhat your -- what your invention was.",
        "A: Well, I was trying to thwart any attempt on his part to have me ar -- to -- to arrest -\n- to arrest me. He knew I -- who I was.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: He knew I was Jewish.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And obviously I had false papers. I mean, he could have asked any of his\npoliceman in the city to stop me and ask for my paper. That happened all the time.\nAnd he knew I had false paper. And so -- in some very daring gesture, I guess -- I\ndon\u2019t understand it myself, today, sounds completely crazy, but I -- you see, it was\nthe end of the war already. It was spring of \u00b044 and I guess that was part of it too, the\nGermans were losing grounds and the collaborators were losing grounds and maybe\nthat was part of it, that he would realize that, you know, himself.",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. But I said, rather than expose myself to the possibility of being\narrested and my papers checked -- he could have done it himself in the restaurant. I\nsaid, I play on both his knowle -- he -- he knew my father. He was the commandant\nof the camp. Before he was the commandant of the camp, he was the -- the -- the\nchief police officer in Strasbourg. So, he knew my family. I didn\u2019t know him then,\nthat was -- my father had some business with him. So I thought I playing -- a part of\nit was playing on that connection, to leave me alone. And it worked, what can I say?\nIt was -- it -- in retrospect, probably was unnecessary risk taking. On the other hand,\nit worked, so -- it -- it -- in -- in -- it -- he -- 1t sounds crazy, totally crazy when I think\nof it.",

Perigure was not in -- this is all wrong.\nPerigure is on this side of the line, not on this side of the line, this 1s the demarcation\nline. This is much too far in. Perigure is -- is the area where my parents lived and it\nwas not in the -- in the occupied zone, it was on the unoccupied zone. So this is\nwrong, here. The -- Perigure should be right here.",
        "Q: But what was it that made you move from working in this camp, to moving to --",
        "A: But Limoge is not a camp.",

        "A: Limoge Is a city.",

        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: See, between -- first of all, this camp in Rivesaltes was the -- Rivesaltes was close.\nAnd from Rivesaltes, I tried to go to Gerse, which was even a worse camp. And they\ndidn\u2019t let me in any more. But they were -- some people were in -- 1n the -- in a s-\nsupervised residency outside of Gerse, and I stayed there for a very, very short while,\nbecause I was really sick. I had jaundice, I was yellow all over. So I went back to my\nparents farm, and I -- took me a couple of months to recover. I didn\u2019t have any\nmedication, I was just wait until it was over. But the farm was here, near Perigure\nand Perigure is not here, Perigure 1s down here. Better check it on your maps. So\nPerigure is somewhere down here. So I stayed the farm. Then, the camp had closed,\nbecause all the people had been deported, so -- and they didn\u2019t let me come into\nGerse and so I went to work in the children\u2019s home outside of Limoge. Limoge is not\na camp.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You have the camps mar-marked in triangles, so Limoge has a circle, that\u2019s a city.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And so, outside of Limoge was a children\u2019s home called Poulousant and there was\na chief counselor until the end of four -- we are in \u201842 now, until the -- and I worked\nthere f -- until \u201843 -- for almost a year. And when the children\u2019s homes were closed,\nand I was recruited in this underground network and I asked to be stationed in\nChatarro, which is a city.",

        "A: It\u2019s just --",
        "Q: And that -- that was when you changed your name?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah, you have all the papers at the Holocaust Museum. I have\nthem all here, but I have copies of them here. So, I didn\u2019t make myself change\nanything, just is -- you know, we traveled the -- in these days. There were trains, but\nyou never know whether you could get on one.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It was so mobbed. There was horrible scene, but -- and so this is where I took\nresidence. And the headquarters really, of this whole area here, was in Limoge. Are\nwe still on tape?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",

        "A: The -- the leader of our -- or the organizer of our underground network at Ose,\nGeorge Garell, in 1947 published a book on the -- the work of Ose under the German\noccupation of France, from 1940-44.

        "Q: He -- he was the leader of the OSE?",
        "A: No, he was the leader of the underground network.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: He was an engineer by training and he was so moved by an experience he had in\nLyon, when he was part o -- that he was with a group of adults and children, had\nbeen arrested and although he was a ver -- Jewishly very fringe and very secular, he\nfelt a need to work with -- to help the Jewish people in France. And he -- he was a\nvery personable guy and he was -- he had the lists of the children and the -- knew the\nmovements of the children, he knew was going on and he -- he traveled around the\ncountry, touching base with all of us workers, pretending to travel, I believe -- I -- I\ndon't have a confirmation -- as a wine salesman and everything being coded and\nhaving all his material, on the work of the network in such a way that -- pretending to\nbe a wine salesman made it possible for him. He brought us the money that we\nneeded, he gave us the news. He made the necessary contacts so that we could\nfunction. He died quite a number of years ago.",
        "Q: Well let me ask you this big, general question. After having gone through all of\nthis, [indecipherable] the -- the intervening years and looking back on it, does it --\nhow -- how does it affect your perception of human beings in general you know,\nmankind?",
        "A: It\u2019s a big question. On the one hand, I cannot get over of the inhumanity of man\nagainst man. I mean, you see it daily on television. The -- the -- the -- the sheer -- the\nbrutality, the -- the senseless brutality with which people can act towards each other.\nAnd yet, on the other hand, the redeeming peace 1s those who help. Last night on the\nradio there was an interview with the woman who has sheltered Anne Frank, there is\nan anniversary, there was something on public radio.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: But -- but an interview with her and you know, there 1s all these people who --\nwho have the condition of man at heart and who work to improve the world,\nwherever it is, when -- whatever it is, so I don\u2019t know it\u2019s balance, but really the\ninhumanity is just -- it\u2019s rampant, it\u2019s everywhere, it\u2019s in our local police, it\u2019s in the\narmy, it\u2019s everywhere. And it\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- it\u2019s devastating and I -- I don\u2019t know what\n-- but it\u2019s -- and you know -- but brutality and enjoying violence has been around for\na long time. Go back to the Roman times, when they watched the slaves being\nthrown to the beasts in the circuses, that was -- that was part of it, so -- I mean, the\nbrutalit -- they were -- how people can -- to-today -- you hear in the news this\nmorning that the Tutus go with machetes to cut up their neighbor. Is there any -- any\n-- that\u2019s human beings. That -- that\u2019s -- it\u2019s devastating.

In growing up in the Jewish community here,\nin this country, I\u2019m used to families in which the parents are very involved in kind of\nlaying out a path for the children.

        "Q: [indecipherable] that. I want to ask you be -- one other question. In this country, in\nthe Jewish community here, you have this extraordinary range of people\u2019s\nrelationship to Judaism and how observant or non-observant they are, now to Jews\nwho were not observant at all. In your youth -- and -- and you\u2019ve -- and you\u2019ve said\nseveral times that -- that you were fact -- very observant and your grandparents were\nobservant.

But this evolution of your Judaism and your relationship to the\nreligion may have taken the course it took anyway, but can you identify or can you\ndiscuss at all how some of the experiences you had during the war might have\naffected this?",

Well, there\u2019s one question I want to ask you that -- which was -- we started to\nget to about before the war. And -- I think one of the most important things that you\nbrought up -- to me, anyway, was the question that you said you\u2019ve been asked many\ntimes, which 1s -- wh-why did you -- yourself and the others who -- who did what\nyou did, do it? And I think all of these things are related. I think that the relationship",

But one of the things that\u2019s really,\nreally difficult for me to understand -- I\u2019m 43 -- is to understand -- and I don\u2019t know\nif you can help me with this or not; wh-when I -- I asked you about the relationship\nbetween the Jews and the non-Jews in your city and you said ba-basically it wasn\u2019t --",

        "Q: But -- but -- well, I -- I gue -- the thing that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- seems impossible\nfor me to comprehend 1s, what was the progression in the pre-war and the early years\nof the war, in your understanding of what was exactly taking place and why it was\ntaking place?",
        "Q: That\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking you. What I\u2019m a -- what I\u2019m asking you is even a\nharder question to answer, I think, which is what was your perception about why the\nJews were being singled out and rounded up and -- and put in camps?",
        "Q: But -- but that\u2019s an important issue, because one of the things that I -- that I want\nyou to share, 1s that -- is that perception, what you think of the hol -- is another whole\ntopic that I want to bring up, which 1s, what do you think of the general approach to\ndealing with the Holocaust?",

My parents had --",
        "A: Strasbourg.",
        "A: Strasbourg. I grew up in Strasbourg for all practical purposes because I don\u2019t\nremember anything from before I was three years old. My father had a very unusual\nprofession for a Jew. His father had been a butcher. They -- usually the Jewish\nbutcher was also the butcher for the other population. In other words, he served the\nwhole community. Of course, the Jews ate the kosher parts and so on. I had never\nknown my grandfather because he died of some gangrene he had of his leg -- he had\na leg amputated, because I\u2019m told that he had diabetes, but I -- I really never knew\nhim. And my father had only one sister, who died when she was probably about 18 or\nso, of complication of probably appendicitis, which know how to treat. But her\nname was Margaret. So, my middle name is Margaret. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m Simone Margaret.\nAnd also Heb-Hebrew name would mean Esther, so I\u2019m Esther too, in my Hebrew\nname. The interesting thing is, is that I\u2019d always thought that I was named Simone\nbecause it\u2019s a real French name and Alsace had just returned to France in 1918. My\nparents were married in 1919 and I was born in 1920. And then I found out when --\nmore recently I\u2019ve been studying genealogy and I have the genealogy of the Weils all\nthe way back to way before the French revolution, I have investigated that.

He was just was important to talk  1t\u2019s neither here nor there, but it\nwas just interesting, was I named because of a Francophile sentiment or was I named\nbecause there was a Simon that died as an infant. So, that\u2019s it. My father did not -- at\nfirst -- I don\u2019t think my father had more than a sixth grade education. They were a\nvery poor family in the village and he used to help his father in -- in the butcher shop,\nbut he eventually developed an interest in sheep and sheep raising and sheep\nbreeding and for the meat and for the and developed a big, big business. He\nbecame the most important sheep breeder in the east of France and although we lived\nin the city, he had these herds of sheep, I guess that\u2019s what they are, in the various\nplaces where he went and then he supervised all this -- this big business.

You see, when the war\nstarted, I was li -- I was 19 years old, but the year before, really, we -- Munich was\nhappening and we were very worried, because Strasbourg is the most exposed city.\nAnd so my parents asked me to take my grandmother away from Strasbourg and in\ntranscript -- in -- I -- I read that I took my -- I went to safety with my grandmother\nand the interpretation was that I went to be safe with my grandmother. What really\nhappened is that I took responsibility for my grandmother and I took a train and I\nwent to some kind of resort, to wait until things were settling down in -- in the whole\nworld situation and then brought my grandmother back to Strassber -- the following\nyear, when the war really was going to get started, same thing happened. I was away,\nmy father brought me back home. This is end of August, 1939 and again I took my\ngrandmother, we took a train. We went to the center of France where we stayed in a\nhotel and I took my grandmother to safety, I didn\u2019t go to safety with my\ngrandmother. So, this is one of the things that, as I say, I took responsibility for my\ngrandmother and we waited out [indecipherable].

        "A: So that\u2019s the information I can gi-give you about my parents.",
        "A: Well, we were very observant family. My mother came, obviously, from a very\nobservant family. Both my parents came, but my mother -- of the two -- of my\nparents, my mother was the more knowledgeable. She -- really amazingly, for a\nwoman in those days, could understand the prayer book, could understand the\nBiblical text. My father could read -- with a lot of mistakes -- he could lead a service\neven, but he made lot of mistakes, because he didn\u2019t have the intellectual stuff that\ngoes with it. He had just learned it by rote and by heart and so on. But the climate\nwas one of observance. Judaism was certainly central to our lives. There was not an\nintellectual climate. There was not a interest in music, in books. My parents read, but\nprobably -- well, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d call them har -- here. Romantic stuff that -",
        "A: Oh, at -- at home we spoke Alsatian, which 1s a dialect, based on German and my\nmother spoke French, obviously I spoke French and went to French school and in my\nteenage, rebellious years, I pretended I couldn\u2019t understand anything but French,\nwhich my father didn\u2019t speak. Don\u2019t forget, that Alsace moved back and forth\nbetween France and Germany, which meant that my grandmother, who lived with us,\nwas born in the French period, to -- became German in 1871, when France lost the\nPrussian war. So both my parents were born under a German regime and went to\nGerman schools. Spoke German fluently. In 1918, France reverted to fran -- Al-\nAlsace reverted to France. Now, my mother came from a very Francophile,\nsomewhat more educated family and all the daughters were sent to Paris, at least for\nsome time, to be with an aunt, whom I know -- whom I knew too, and there they\nperfected their French. So my mother spoke and wrote perfect French. No spelling\nmistake, no nothing, she didn\u2019t -- but she also could do it in German. My father --\nwhose business was with the peasants, the farmers, the -- the rural community, never\nbothered to learn French. So he could understand somewhat. So as I said, in my\nrebellious teenage years, when he and I collided, I couldn\u2019t understand Alsatian. I\nshould like to add something that -- very pa -- I don\u2019t know how interesting it is to\nthis particular interview, but Alsatian Jews speak not -- sp-speak what is called in\nFrench, le Judeo Alsatian, or in their own parlance, they call it Yiddish dige. It\u2019s not\nYiddish, because God forbid an Alsatian Jew should speak Yiddish. The Alsatian\nJews look down on eastern European Jews, whom they all called Polacks, that\u2019s --\nwas the n-nomination, so just like the German Jews in this country look down on the\nimmigrants that came after them from the eastern European countries. Exactly the\nsame situation. My father is probably turning around 1n his grave, as I have\ndiscovered that this Judeo Alsatian, which they spoke, is really similar to Yiddish.\nIt\u2019s not -- does not have -- it\u2019s -- doesn\u2019t have a written language, it doesn\u2019t have a\nliterature. It was just a spoken language -- 1s dying out, but it\u2019s being retrieved and I\nhappen -- I -- where as when I grew up, I thought of it as very crude and very\ncommon and I walked two miles behind my parents when they spoke it. Today, I\u2019m\nvery interested in it and I have read a number of books. There -- I find out there 1s -- I\nhave been communicating with people who are studying it and there is very few of us\nwho still ha-have a feel for it. It\u2019s a very rich language, very different from Yiddish\nin it\u2019s pronunciation and it\u2019s formation of words, and is very much tied into Hebrew,\nwhich also intrigues me very much. So, this is how that beca --",
        "A: Yes, I can give you one that I always use when people ask me. In Germany you\nsay, \u201cEashe harbor gie gessen.\u201d I have eaten. In Yiddish, you say, \u201cAy chobe\ngessen.\u201d In Alsatian, you say, \u201cShop gessa.\u201d In Yiddish dige, le Judeo Alsatian,\n\u201cIshap ger archult.\u201d I don\u2019t if you know Hebrew, but ochell in Hebrew is to eat. So\nthey -- they use the Hebrew word, they conjugate it in germaway and they say, Ishap.\nThe big difference, eehope and ishap, that\u2019s the big different. Ishap ger archult and\nthat\u2019s the way my father would speak, using Hebrew words, conjugating them and\ndistorting them, so that in order to trace back what it really means, you really have to\ndo a little research. And it\u2019s -- has intrigued enough people. There 1s a chair of Judeo\nAlsatian [indecipherable] at the university now. And it\u2019s a non-Jewish person who is\nstudying it. So it\u2019s interesting [indecipherable]. But anyway, this is what we spoke at\nhome. And coming back to this, the atmosphere, you know, my parents had no social\nlife. They didn\u2019t go out, they didn\u2019t travel. My vacations were -- m-my grandparents\nhouse, maybe at an aunt, my -- once -- one aunt got married and lived in another\nvillage and she married a -- a cattle peddler. J-Jews were a lot of cattle peddlers or\nbecame merchants and grain merchants, cattle merchants and that kind of thing. So I\nwent -- I went to spend some vacation with them. The only time my -- I remember\ntaking a vacation was my mother and we went to Luxembourg in a Jewish hotel, was\nthat -- there was an epidemic of polio and my mother took us there for several weeks.\nIs --",
        "A: Because there was an epidemic of polio -- to be away from Strasbourg and to go\nsomewhere where it wouldn\u2019t affect us. Because in these days, you went into an iron\nlung and all this kind of thing. So twice I remember going there. But what really\nbecame my -- well, even before I go to that, let me say, my -- the focus of my life\nwas school. For two reasons. One -- number one, I was interested. But number two,\nhad a brother who\u2019s 13 months younger and my father made no bones about the fact\nhe would have liked to have a boy first or maybe even two boys and no girl, because\nhe needed one for the busine -- he needed two boys for the business. And I was an\nonly -- only a girl. But I was very interested in school and did very well in school. So\nthis mar -- the teachers and -- and I also went very unusually so for those days, I also\nwent to what you\u2019d call here, Hebrew school and got a very solid Jewish education.\nAn education which I continue throughout the years so that I\u2019m familiar and\ncomfortable with the Hebrew -- of the service and I\u2019m comfortable with the Biblical\ntext and I have continued studying. And so my goodies came not so much from my\nparents as it came from teachers and rabbis and educators. And also, when I was 12\nyears old, my parents permitted me to join the Jewish girl scout -- German -- and that\nreally became the center of my life. Now, I\u2019m not unique in this. Of course, it took\neven more importance, because my parents, when -- couldn\u2019t give me the -- the\ncultural stuff that they didn\u2019t have. I mean, they -- they -- they -- they were not\neducated to -- to have this and so I got -- I got very involved and a total commitment\nto the Jewish girl scouts. Not the --when I -- when I say girl scout -- and the\nequivalent, I mean there is no comparison to the scouting movement today in the\nUnited Sta -- don\u2019t know what it was like 50 years ago, but that was a -- a total\ncommitment to service, to -- to -- I\u2019m -- I -- to Jewish learning. There was a boy\u2019s\nmovement and a girl\u2019s movement. I -- now, in back -- in looking back on it, I must\nhave been an organizers from very early on, because by the time I was 13, I was\nalready one of the leaders. You know, the movement at that time, unlike in the\nUnited State, no parent involvement. It was -- we called it leading through youth. We\ndidn\u2019t have any parent involvement. So we got leadership training and we got all\nkinds of stuff. I took these kids hiking in the mountains every Sunday, or practically\nevery Sunday and we roughed it up, we went camping, we dig out trenches. We kept\nkosher at camp and we -- we cooked on -- we didn\u2019t have any of the equipments that\nyou have today, we really roughed it out. But it was and it 1s an indi -- 1t -- we have a\n-- still today, we -- we have a bound, a -- a tie between us that 1s the s-something that\nis difficult to describe. And the Jewish youth movement became a very active\nmovement in the resistance in France during the war and then eventually after the\nwar, some of them found a kibbutzim in Israel. And I am still not in correspondence,\nbecause [indecipherable] because our -- our what we call the commissaire, the -- the\nbig leader over the whole region there, there\u2019s a man who is now in his 90\u2019s, he is\ndeaf, he is blind, and -- but I\u2019m -- I still get news from him or about him. And all to\nrees --",
        "A: In Israel.",
        "A: And he founded a kibbutz there and his wife is still living.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Well, his real name is now Shimon Hamel, but in -- oh, this -- this 1s going to ex --\nask for a lot of explanation. We call him Shamu. Shamu in French means camel. But\nit also means somebody who\u2019s very rough. And he was a very tough leader. If you\ntake the Jewish encyclopedia, and I have it in there, the library there and you look\nunder scouting and you\u2019ll find his name there in quotation mark and his wife is a\nvery busy lady, so we called her Fumi, which in French means ants. We all had\nnames like that which we called [indecipherable]. But it creates a tru -- an -- you\nknow, I\u2019ve often wondered -- you know, people have asked me, in this country, what\nmade you do what you did during the war? And, although I have really no answer to\nit and I have read books and I\u2019ve tried -- people have been pondering, why did some\npeople become rescuers and why did some stand by? And actually participated here,\nat University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in a workshop led by somebody from\nGermany and -- on rescue and resistance. And I also have connected in the last few\nyears, with some of my co-workers in the camps and in the underground and we\npondered this, too, because we [indecipherable] ask, why did you did what you do --\ndid? And the only answer that everybody [indecipherable], we ha -- there was a job\nto be done and we did it. Now, why did we do it and not somebody el -- the -- I have\nbeen pondering and I really don\u2019t know, except that maybe in this deep involvement\nin this youth movement, I took on a sense of responsibility and caring and duty, sort\nof. And more recently I have been thinking about it and my mother, who was not an\neducated woman, but sh -- and she was a very gentle and rather passive woman, yet,\nshe was a caretaker. She took care of all her siblings. Or -- and of not only siblings,\nof -- of relatives in need and that kind of thing. And of her mother-in-law, who didn\u2019t\ngive her an easy time either, but she was there and I\u2019m wondering whether I\nunconsciously, you know, had some -- some model there. Be -- and my father, who\nwas really a -- a very -- man with a very high temper and really a tyrant, but\nnevertheless, he let my mother do all this helping. In other words, he opened his\npocketbook and there was never any problem. So I wasn\u2019t a deprived child in a sense\nof physical [indecipherable] thing. We lived simply, not luxuriously, but I didn\u2019t\nhave this -- I -- I really got my goodies from the scouting movement.",
        "A: And from my teachers, rabbis, etcetera.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, th-th -- your statement is correct except for one thing 1s that is this is\ntrue uniquely for me. Has nothing to do with my generation. It\u2019s my family, my\nfriends. And -- in -- in the Lycee, which I attended -- in the Lycee which I attended, I\nhad friends who were of different religions. I had the daughter of a minister. I had a -\n- | had Jewish friends and their parents had this kind of -- in fact the -- the -- one of\nmy girlfriend\u2019s mothers was a writer of children\u2019s book.

We lived across from the\nrailroad station, which meant the -- I always had the feeling that they came from the\nlittle village and they found a place across the railroad station and that\u2019s where they\nwent. And when I went to the Lycee and wherever I went, my friends lived closer to\nthat place.

        "A: Well, as you -- as I told you just now, you have to look at different levels. When I\nwas in the village with my grandparents, where I spend, as I said, all my summers\nuntil I was 10 - 11 and had outgrown that and I was with the girl scouts at camp. I\nwent camping with them at the south of France and all over the [indecipherable].",
        "A: There are three houses being built right now. We lucked out. The -- I -- there was\nstill a perceived fear of anti-Semitism in the village. I never experienced this in the\ncity. And what I remember very well is, on Christmas eve, my grandparents would\nclose all the shutters of the house. They -- just up -- they lived in the street called Rue\nde les gliese, Church Street. Which means the church was right -- just at the end of\nthe street there, and there was this fear -- I\u2019m sure they had never experienced this\npersonally, but maybe it came down through the family history that coming out from\nthe midnight mass, there would be some -- something happening to Jews. And so\nthey closed the shutters on -- [indecipherable] they probably closed them other\nnights, too. But there was a fear there.",
        "A: My -- my mother, you know, my -- my -- my mothers. My maternal grandparents,\nbecause my paternal grandmother lived with us and my grandfather had died. And\nalso, I remember in the village, as a little girl -- and I played with little kids there --\nwhether they were Jewish kids or not, I don\u2019t remember. But I remember hearing\nsome little -- what would you call it, little -- oh, nasty things, like, you know, what\nyou -- some derogatory statements. I remember it very well. If you want to hear it\nenunciation, I can tell it to you.",
        "A: Yout -- yout chasit dout. And I don\u2019t remember the rest of it. J-Jew -- Jew, shit\ninto the bag -- and then I don\u2019t remember. Anyway, there was a derogatory kind of\nthing. But I don\u2019t remember it bothering me, so -- but their relationship with non-\nJews was perfectly good, there in the village. I remember in Passover, spending\nPassover with my grandparents and since they were very observant and I went\nliterally across the street to the farm with a -- with a pottery container and they would\nmilk the cow directly into that. And was very acceptable that Jews at this time of the\nyear, couldn\u2019t put the milk in another kind of vessel because of the Passover\nobservance. And so there was that. My father worked with non-Jews in the\ncountryside. I would ass -- and he -- he did business with non Jews all the time.

        "A: Absolutely. But there was -- now, when I said we were observant, I\u2019m -- you\nknow, I hate the word Orthodox. You use the word Orthodox today because you\nhave to separate Conservative, Reform, Orthodox. There was no such a thing in\nFrance. It was traditional Judaism.

        "A: It affected them very deeply, whether it\u2019s their belief in God or whether there is\ntheir attachment to Judaism. I haven\u2019t discussed to believe in God with them. But I\nknow it affected them very deeply. Can I give you one example?",
        "A: I think my next oldest cousin is eight years younger than I and then she has a\nsister who 1s three years younger than I. They grew up at Strasbourg like I did, but\nit\u2019s interesting, I cannot remember our family getting together for holidays so very\nrarely [indecipherable]. My parents were very limited this way, socially. But I\nremember their coming and I -- I -- I remember going to their house and so on. They\nmust have gotten some kind of Jewish education somewhere, although I really cannot\nswear, but they must have gone to Talmator like we all did. You see sc -- in France,\nschool is as -- five days of school, but unlike here, where Saturday and Sunday are\noff, you have a day in the middle of the week that\u2019s off. You went to school s --\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, were off on Thursday and you went to school on --\non Friday and Saturday. Big dilemma for an observant girl. So what did I do? I went\nto school, but I didn\u2019t write. I attended -- this was the compromise, because there\nwere no day schools and I had to go to school. So I -- I t -- I sat through classes\nwithout writing. So you distinguish between the Jews who wrote and Jews who\ndidn\u2019t write on Shabbat. This was the big thing. And I was one of the few who didn\u2019t\nwrite. But on Thursday, on Sunday, we went to Hebrew school. And whether my\ncousins stayed or not, I don\u2019t remember. But what happened 1s, when the war started,\nthere were obviously -- I was 19, so one of them was 11 and the other one was nine.\nThey lived in the south of France and the father -- they lost their mother to cancer\nvery early on during the war. And their father worked with the Jewish agency, you\nknow, the -- there was an official Jewish agency functioning in France -- in the --",
        "A: One of them -- one of my mother\u2019s sisters, yeah.",
        "A: And she -- she died of natural causes and the father put them 1n a -- into a\nboarding school while he was working for the Jewish agency. There was a -- an\nofficial Jewish agency that was responsible to the [indecipherable] forces, but -- and\nmy uncle worked for them. He had been a civil servant in Strasbourg, some -- some\nvery low government pencil pusher kind of job. I -- I don\u2019t know exactly what he did.\nAnd he was killed in that position because they took the whole office as hostages --\nas hostage and he was killed. At that time I was working in the underground and my -\n- I think I talk about this in my -- in my oral history. And the head of our network\ncame to Chatahou where I was functioning and told me that Mr. So and So had been\nkilled and we better go and rescue the daughters. Well, he didn\u2019t know it was my\nuncle and I indeed got my two cousins out of the boarding school. They have\nrecently told me that they didn\u2019t know whether it was a trap or whether it was really\nme that had called them. And they only told me this about 10 years ago.",
        "A: In France. [indecipherable] me get back to that.",
        "A: So they both survived because I placed them in a safe place. I remember exactly\nhow we changed the name and all that, that\u2019s not relevant. And the war was over,\nthey were left without any parents, deeply affected by what happened to their parents.\nAnd in addition, the young one of the two got TB and so she had to be isolated in\nsome treatment kind of -- an-and they lived with my very bitter uncles and aunts to --\nwho never married. And to escape, they went into 180 degree turn and not only with\nmy oldest cousin -- I mean, the older of the two cousins, become a professor of\nGerman. Yes, it\u2019s really incredible, she studied German. She became a Communist.\nShe married a non-Jew in the same kind of political orientation.",
        "A: French. He became a very -- they -- they -- they dropped their Communism in --\nvery soon in ba -- but they have remained very Socialist oriented, very Leftist kind of\nthing.

        "A: Oh, I do. But th-the uncles and aunts, she s-separated her -- I mean I was in the\ncou -- in this country, you know, so I -- she didn\u2019t sever herself from me. After the\nwar, I -- I still was in touch with her, but she married this non-Jew and she cut herself\noff from the fam -- from -- there were uncles and aunts and my parents. She just\nseparated herself [indecipherable].",
        "A: Well, she didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with Judaism. My family was the\ntraditional Jew -- my family and -- I mean, extended family, that the ones that were\nleft represented. They also represented the war, they represented the loss of her\nfather, of her mother. They -- they represented -- I have never asked her what made\nher do all these things, but I see a -- a complete lose -- wanting to loosen herself up\nfrom the things Jewish, totally. And I\u2019ve stayed with her and I\u2019ve talked with her for\na long time, but that\u2019s something else [Il talk to you about you later. I -- I really have\nhad ver -- little relationship with my family in France and it\u2019s only in recent years\nthat I have -- well, recent -- not quite -- not -- maybe the last 20 years or so that I\nhave really intensively reconnected and with a great deal of pleasure. But so, when\nyou say, did they lose their belief in God? I don\u2019t know what belief they lost, bu -- la\n-- they certainly lost their -- any belief in -- in things Jewish. Her sister married a\nJewish man eventually. Somebody much older than herself and sh -- he died of\nParkinson\u2019s disease very young, and she -- and she also last -- lost all contact -- she\nha -- c-continued the contact with the family, but Judaism she completely put aside.\nAnd her son married a non-Jewish person and her ch -- grandchildren are not Jewish.\nInteresting enough, now that she\u2019s retired -- and she became a social worker -- now\nthat she\u2019s retired, she has, in a very -- how shall I say? Intellectual, secular way,\nreconnected to -- to things Jewish. She studies and she\u2019s interest in groups. Not for\nobservers -- observance as much as for unders -- of -- of thinking, you know,\n[indecipherable]. My other two -- I mean and I -- air -- I can go down the line, I have\nsix cousins like that and their ties to Judaism have loosened a great deal. And if they\nhaven\u2019t, I have two male cousins and they have married Jewish girls, but their own\nchildren, except for one, are -- no longer have any tie with -- but you know, I don\u2019t\nknow whether the effect of the war, or whatever it 1s, but whatever I have read about\nstatistics 1s that they -- this is very typical of the Jewish population in France. So,\nwhether the war had -- o-of the old Jewish population, now there is an influx of\nobservance brought in by the Sephardic Jews from North Africa.",
        "A: So I -- I don\u2019t know if I answer your question, why my brother and I remained\nvery committed Jews, I don\u2019t know, except that probably it has more to do with the\nintensity with -- and maybe also my mother brought a great deal of knowledge to\nwhat we were doing. Because I was always an inquisitive kind of kid, I\u2019d say. When\nmy mother said, \u201cYou can\u2019t do this,\u201d or \u201cyou can\u2019t do that.\u201d P\u2019'd say, \u201cWhy?\u201d And if\nshe couldn\u2019t the answer, I would go to the rabbi.

        "A: Oh, you want to know?",
        "A: When -- in Judaism, you always say a blessing before you do something. So,\nbefore you drink wine, you say a blessing. Before you eat bread, you say a blessing.\nWhen you light the candles, you do the thing first, because -- and then you do the\nblessing, right? Right? This is the [indecipherable], because you cannot do the\nblessing and then light the candle, because it would be Shabbat already and you\ncannot -- and you cannot do -- light the candles on Shabbat. So you use a little\nfiction. You light the candle first, you close your eyes, you haven\u2019t seen the flame\nyet. You say the blessing and lo and behold, here is the flame. All you have to do is\nclose your eye. But, I think it has become like a -- a -- I don\u2019t know what. My mother\ndidn\u2019t do that, she just closed her eyes and said the blessing. But in eastern European\ntradition, it has become putting a shawl over your head and closing your eyes and\ndoing a -- which I don\u2019t do, because I understand why it\u2019s -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a very literal\ngirl.",
        "A: So, going back to early child -- to my early years, I\u2019ve always wanted to know.\nAnd I guess this is a personal kind of thing and I -- my cousin may not have had that.\nBut whatever reason it 1s, they have cut themself off from -- from things Jewish.

        "A: Oh, I didn\u2019t know I was on.",
        "A: Well, coming from this very traditional -- coming from this very traditional\nbackground, and marrying here, in this country, Jewish man, who\u2019d rai -- been raised\nfairly traditionally in Germany, there\u2019s no question that I was going to have a Jewish\nhome. But I was searching and of course, when I came here as a student, I had\ndiscovered Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism, all kinds of formulas which -\n- which I was not familiar. And don\u2019t forget, I had had five years of war -- of really\nliving as a Catholic as well and cut off -- although I do remember even living as a\nCatholic, we had a very clandestine seder and -- and a -- and all kinds of -- I have\nnever really been away from Judaism, even when I was living as a Catholic. And as\nsoon as the war was over, I was back into a | -- being the head of a Jewish children\u2019s\nhome and instilling a love of Judaism and teaching and training the kids and so forth\nand so on. When I came to this country, I discovered this other formulas and I just\nobserved, I wasn\u2019t really becoming a part of any of this. And I got married in a\ntraditional Jewish ceremony in Strasbourg. My parents -- I -- small apartment,\nbecause after the war they had lost everything and they were sharing apartment with\nsomebody else, as a matter of fact. But we got married in a synagogue and came back\nhere and we joined a Conservative synagogue. Our home -- I did not keep a kosher\nhome, but kept a -- oh, a very traditional oriented ka -- ya -- obs -- nee -- at least\nobserving Friday night and attending services on and off. It was not a same\ncommitment that I had before, until about almost 50 years ago. Well, I'll be married\n50 years next year, so it\u2019s about 48 or 49 years ago. I heard a lecture by Rabbi\nMordecai Kaplan, the founder of Reconstructionism and he really expressed for me a\ndirection for me to go into. It was a very revealing kind of lecture. I still have the\nnotes that I took. He defined -- as you know, Reconstruction, it defines Judaism as a\ndynamic, religious civilization. God as the power that makes for salvation. And I\nbegan to read Rabbi Kaplan. I began to subscribe to Reconstructionist magazine. And\nit opened to me a whole m -- way of living my Judaism in a more creative and in a\nmore -- in a happier way. My childhood was full of don\u2019t, and it\u2019s a sin and all the\nforbidding kinds of thing. One of the strongest phrases that remains in my memory,\nis in Kaplan\u2019s writing, he talks about reading into the Torah, or reading out of it. And\nI grew up where everybody read into the Torah because -- this is repeated three times\nand this is -- were -- this is -- has a meaning and usually the meaning ended up in\nsome forbidden to do this and forbidden to do that, etcetera. [indecipherable] Rabbi\nKaplan talks about reading into the Torah, reading into the teaching of the Torah\nitself, the text itself. And doing things in a more creative ways. And so after that, this\nis -- this has been my -- my direction. And especially with our children. We -- we --\nthey all -- they all attended Conservative synagogues. They all went to Jewish camps.\nThey went to Camp Ramah, they went to --",
        "A: Camp Ramah. These are the -- the camps of the Conservative movement.",
        "A: R-a-m-a-h.",
        "A: Oh, they\u2019re all over.",
        "A: Happened to be -- this one happened to be in Canada, but -- and it\u2019s -- to this day -\n- to this day I am looking for ways to enhance Judaism in this world, by blending in\nwith all life here today. I don\u2019t know how to say it, but I\u2019m always looking for ways\nof making my Judaism more meaningful and more joyous, happy with -- with\ncreative things. So we were very fortunate because -- well, in c -- we first lived in\nCleveland, my husband and I. I -- I graduated from Western Reserve and my husband\nwas still attending school at Case. We settled in Cleveland after we got married,\nwhich 1s 1949 and I\u2019m -- my first job was as a director of a Jewish day nursery,\nwhich was Jewish day care center, affiliated with the Jewish [indecipherable] in\nCleveland, which was a top notch agency. And this is where, eventually, I got my\ntraining, also in child therapy. M-My degree is in social work. I had gotten my\ndegree at Western Reserve. But I specialized in early childhood, because in France I\nalready had a degree in early childhood, so I combined the two and I specialized in\nthat. And little by little, I developed my skills in -- in working for, or in behalf, or\nwith young children. And we joined a synagogue, a Conservative synagogue and I\nthink I have taken -- so have -- adult -- my husband, too, we have taken adult\neducation classes all our lives, in -- in the various synagogues and I learned more\nabout Reconstructionism. I\u2019ve -- I have -- I have read a great deal about this. In\nCleveland, we belonged to such a huge congregation, like 2,000 families, that 1t was\nvery difficult to form any meaningful relationships. And although -- I was working,\nraising kids and we had a real struggle when we first started here. I didn\u2019t have a\npenny to my name, my husband had not a penny to his name. We lived in two rooms\n-- not two room apartment, a -- a -- not two bedroom apartment, two room apartment,\nupstairs, raising a kid. We eventually got a house. It -- the financial struggle was --\nwas rough and after I had my first child, I stayed home for four years, although I\nworked part time on the side. But what I did was, I worked as a Sunday school\nteacher on Sundays, just to get away from the house and leave a child to daddy. And\nI taught second grade Sunday school, which I\u2019d never done before, but it provided\nme also with a tie to the Temple and that kind of thing. We left Cleveland at the time\nour oldest son was ready to be Bar Mitzvah and my husband was transferred to\nSyracuse. And had to join the existing Conservative synagogue there, because he had\nto be Bar Mitzvah -- I mean, that was his [indecipherable] and -- but we were very\nunhappy with the establishment synagogue, with -- with -- we -- 1t was so rote -- it\nwas so uncreative, but we went, you see? I -- we schlepped our kids there and we\nwent and we made no exception to this kind of thing, until we discovered that in the\nsuburb of Syracuse called Dewitt, they were creating a new Conservative\nsynagogue. We were younger in those days, although we were much older than the\ngeneral age of the congregation, we just -- I -- I have to tell you that story. I read\nabout this congregation, then I found out what time their Friday night service are and\nwe went with our kids on Friday night. And the rabbi, though very rigidly observant,\nnevertheless, he had a -- a way of teaching, a way of making the service interesting.\nBut he had passed mimeographed sheets with some special readings or discussion\npoint or whatever it was that Friday night and I was ecstatic about something.",
        "A: *66?",
        "A: \u201866. And I was ecstatic about that. My son always tells me, \u201cMom was converted\nby a mimeographed sheet.\u201d Because I wanted -- I -- I -- I didn\u2019t want this road\nservice, this -- this dead service and I wanted something creative in there. And\n[indecipherable] we joined, because by then they -- you see, when we came first, I\ncouldn\u2019t join, because my son had to have his Bar Mitzvah and they -- they had just\ncreated -- they only had a fir -- kindergarten or a first grade in religious school. But\nthat was okay for our second son, because they are six years apart.",

He was the head of -\n- president of the class or whatever it was and it was a great big shock that we left.\nBut we were so happy at this new synagogue. They -- they were meeting and the\nlittle building and -- it -- it -- they were living on shoestring, but my husband\nvolunteered to work on an architectural search committee and before he knew it he\nwas the h-head of the building committee and before he knew it, he built a synagogue\nand I got involved with children, with the education committee, with the richman\ncommit -- education enrichment has always been my -- my thing.",

And there are young people and I don\u2019t even know if we\u2019ll\nbelong, because they haven\u2019t gelled yet. But they\u2019re searching for something\ncreative. They\u2019re searching for a service that is gender sensitive, which is very\nimportant to me. Because in Syracuse, too, when the -- when Conservative Judaism\nmade it permissible for women to be included and the minyan to be counted and to\nput this in the service, I -- I was at the head of that movement in my congregation. I\nwas the first woman to lead services in our congregation. And so I -- we are looking\ninto this new congregation and next Shabbat I\u2019m doing the service there, because\nthey don\u2019t have anybody. And I thought I would never do it again. But it is exciting\nto help a group of --",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Leading services, I -- I don\u2019t even have a voice to speak of, but it 1s nice to be able\nto provide some help of some people who are seeking to create their own thing and to\nlive their Judaism in -- in a way that is meaningful to them. And so _at first when\nthey -- when I showed an interest and I said, \u201cI want my -- I want something ready\nmade. At my age -- I\u2019m 78 years old, I\u2019m wa -- I don\u2019t want to create things any\nmore.\u201d And we\u2019ve attended their services and they were willing to -- to understand\nthings and to learn and particularly -- and I\u2019m very, very -- what\u2019s very important to\nme is that the services -- the Hebrew text, not just the English text -- be gender\nsensitive. [indecipherable] a big issue for me. Um -- a big issue, it\u2019s an important\nissue. And -- and also that service -- that we have time for meaningful discussion\nduring the service and that -- on the Torah reading, that kind of thing is important to\nme. And so here I am, still as excited at 78 as I was in earlier years as a girl scout, to\nfind ways of doing things at a camp. This has remained -- this has kept young in me\nand important to me. So, next Saturday, in that new congregation, I will participate.\nTh-This is not a program I had -- I can just stand up and do it, you know, I don\u2019t have\nto prepare, or read or anything, this has been part of me.",

And th-this is why -- actually, I don\u2019t want to lose\nmy train of thought, but I\u2019m rebelling against this a little bit, at this stage of my life. I\nfeel that we need to teach people -- and our children, particularly, the achievement of\nthe Jews, before we talk about the persecutions. And that\u2019s why -- we talked early, at\nwhat age do you tell a child about the Holocaust?

And I -- indeed, coming back to your earlier question, I lived -- I\nlived next door to Germany, so what was happening in Germany, from the late 20\u2019s\non, from the rise of Hitler, it was part of my growing up years. I remember April --\nwas it April first, 1933, when we had a -- a solemn service in our synagogue in\nStrasbourg, because -- exactly what the date was that Hitler was starting the\nNuremberg laws or whatever it was. I mean the restrictions on Jew and Hitler being\ninstalled. And we began to have lot of Jewish refugees come into the city and all of\nthat. So, it was not happening overnight. It was something that -- although I thought\nit would never happen in France -- French people don\u2019t do things like that. My\nparents probably thought differently, bu -- although they took absolutely no presh --\nmeasures to protect themself from anything. My father, confident in his status of a\nloyal French citizen, n -- continued his business to the last day, never put a penny\naside, never -- never did anything. But I grew up with the awareness that indeed, it\ncan happen to the Jews. And I know the history of the Jew. So, it just was one -- it\njust crossed the Rhine. It just came gradually. So \u201833 -- this is \u201839, six years, it came\ngradually. And then after that, it was just fighting for your survival, you know, it just\n-- and fighting for the survival of others, for some of us who got involved in that.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: In France there were many Jews who had come from eastern Europe, many.\nBecause France was very -- always been very easy -- France was always a country\nfor refugees. The literature is full of the refugees who came from fra -- the White\nRussians, the -- you know? For ev -- all countries. And from the French colonies and\nso on. But mostly there were lots -- lots of Jews from eastern Europe who came. It\u2019s\nvery easy to get into France. That\u2019s never been a problem. But to become a citizen,\nthat\u2019s the pro -- and even if you\u2019re born in France, at least in those days -- I don\u2019t\nknow what the law is today, it\u2019s changed over the years, but I don\u2019t know what it is\ntoday. You were not a citizen, being born in France. If your parents had not acquired\ncitizenship, you were a foreign Jew. So as soon as the war started, the authorities --\nno, nos -- no, not as -- when the war started, as soon as France lost the war and was\noccupied by Germany, they rounded up all the Jews who had not French citizenship.\nNow, that includes people like my sister-in-law, who was born in France, of Polish\nparents. She and her entire family were in Rivesaltes, because her parents had not\nacquired citizenship. She spoke French. She was born in France. Her par -- her father\nwas deported as forced labor, whatever that meant. He may have been sent to\nAuschwitz directly, we don\u2019t know. Her brother joined the French underground. He\nescaped the camp, he went into French underground. He was killed in the French\nunderground, on that [indecipherable]. He was born in France. The mother survived\nand she and her younger brother survived, because we placed them with ame -- ame -\n- in hiding and my sister-in-law was placed with my family. That\u2019s how she came to\nmarry my brother. And -- but she was foreign born. Who were the other forei -- who\nwere the other foreign Jews? There were the Jews from the Rhineland, in Germany.\nThere\u2019s the whole -- the -- the whole Jewery that lived along the Rhine, which were\nin -- in -- in earlier days very prominent Jewish communities. They were all deported\nto France. Is this the only westward deportation in the history of World War Two. All\nthe deportations were east. The Jews from Rhineland were deported into the south of\nFrance and promptly picked up by the French whatever -- police or militia or\nwhatever and put into these camps.",

You know, France was\ninvaded by the com -- the Germans came through Belgium and Holland to invade\nFrance in 1940 -- in May of 1940. We got caught up in that, because we were living\nup there. And the Jews fled Belgium and Holland. And they arrived in the south of\nFrance. My brother-in-] -- mart -- my husband\u2019s sister and her husband lived in\nBelgian. They were caught in that.

He was able to get out and meet his wife in Marseilles -- she had been\ngoing all the way through -- from Belgium, all the way to the south of France, they\nwere able to escape to Cuba and spend the war in Cuba. You get family sagas you\nwouldn\u2019t believe when some of us get together. And so all these people were in\ncamps, some on -- early on, were able to get out with all kinds of papers and all kinds\nof visas, all kinds of thing. But the majority were trapped. They had -- they had no\npapers.",

That doesn\u2019t mean\nthat all Jews in the south of France, because France was divided, we were -- lived in\nthe south -- didn\u2019t have to rig -- register. My parents had to regi -- everybody had to\nregister with the special o-office of Jewish affairs. Whether I registered or not, I don\u2019t\nremember.",

Or my parents registered me as a member of\nthe family, I don\u2019t remember. But Jews were registered and I had an uncle who was\ndeported from Paris, a French born citizen who was deported from Paris in the very\nfirst convoy, arrested in 1941. But not because he was -- because of his status,\nparticularly, it was more because some-somebody had attacked some German in\nParis or something and they rounded up all the male Jews in this one particular\nneighborhood and he was among them, he and his father-in-law. He is on the list of\nthe first convoy to leave for Auschwitz from Drancy in 1942. So, we didn\u2019t know at\nthe time, but I -- I know now. I -- he is on the list. Where were we?

There was no running water, there\nwere -- I mean, the most horrible hygienic condition, as I say in my early interview.\nAnd so these people were there in these c-camps, awaiting that some govern --\nauthority would decide their fate.

        "A: To -- to the east. We didn\u2019t know, in 1942 what that meant. The human mind\ncouldn\u2019t fathom death machines. At first we thought they were put to forced labor.\nOr resettled in the east. Resettlement in the east was the -- the euphemism. We had\nno idea. Death camp? I mean, how can the human mind even fathom such a thing?\nSo these -- so does that answer your que -- and these were the Jews that were in these\ncamps. And I -- and there they stayed, until they were deported. And indeed, as I sa --\nreported earlier, in 19 -- the summer of 1942, they start just rounding up people. And\nit was to send them to the east. Some for forced labor, some for -- whatever that\nmeant and some for resettlement. They were creating communities for Jews there. I\nhad no idea what it meant. All I know -- my mind should have been working a little\nbit better when they took elderly, handicapped people. You don\u2019t take people to work\nin the east in that condition. So, what we didn\u2019t know, that they were gassed right\naway, upon arrival in Auschwitz and [indecipherable]. So, those are the people were\nin Rivesaltes. And in Gersin and in other camps.",
        "A: Well, not originally. You see, there were several agencies with international status\nthat had a conference in Nimes and they -- there was an agreement that the govern --\nwould -- would permit social workers [indecipherable] social workers to be 1n these\ncamp to help the popula -- to -- to make life a little easier for them. They -- they had\nnothing to do. The men and women were separated, the wer -- children were with the\nwomen, the men were separated. They lived in filth. They lived -- they had very little\nto eat, because the guards took the food and people died of dysentery, died of -- I\nmean, there are 3000 people died just of malnutrition. Was a study of malnutrition in\nthe camps. And the original intent was to improve the conditions in the camps. ORT,\nif you know it, is a Jewish organization, brought sewing machines for the women,\norganized workshops. I have pictures of, and my -- my sister-in-law\u2019s younger\nbrother worked in one -- in the kitchen. I mean, they did all -- they did some -- her\nfather, who was a shoemaker, organized a shoe repair shop, and -- and with the -- je -\n- with the organization, there were non-Jewish organization as well of Jewish ones.\nThere were very few Jewish ones, allowed us to -- to live in the camp. And I was in a\nfarm with my parents and one of my scouting leaders got a hold of me -- and I don\u2019t\nknow how she got my address.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And since she\u2019s dead, I will never know. And I never asked her how she got ahold\nof me, now I don\u2019t -- will never know, but she found me and I left and I went to the\ncamp, and --",
        "A: Oh, yes. I -- she was one of my leaders in camp. She was the leader of the older\ngirl\u2019s club. In those days, there were -- the -- the older ones started at 18. Can you\nimagine today 18 year old girls, girl scouts, you know? But this was the commitment\nwe had and she was -- she was one of our leaders. And I knew her and she got ahold\nof me and so I went to live in the camp. I was 21 years old when I first started and we\n-- we tr -- I was in charge originally, to do something on behalf of the kids. So the\nfirst Shabbat I was there, I had, in this big empty barrack, I -- we announced that all -\n- there would be a program for the kids, a program with nothing. I mean, nothing -- I\nmean, nothing. Singing, what we could do and maybe something like -- and I had\n280 kids in that barrack, all ages. But here again, I had the support of that internee\npopulation. There were teachers, there were rabbi\u2019s, there were professionals of all\nkinds, doctors. And they helped. And they were internee themselves and they had\nbeen already in this camp, we -- and this was a tremendous lesson in human values\nand in -- in -- in human strengths, internal strengths. I mean, it was incredible for me\nto see people had lived in these conditions all the -- for all this length and time. The\ndignity with which they continue to live, under the very c-condition in which they\nlived. They\u2019d had no water to wash, they had no -- I mean, it was awful. And this is -\n- this is originally what I did, and I was part of a team that delivered extra rations. We\ngot, through all the agency, we delivered rations into the ca -- into the barracks and\nthen eventually in as -- paralleled another -- another part of the team of Ose worked\non the liberation of the kids from camp. And then I participated in taking kids out and\n-- and helped in that process as well. They overlapped, kind of thing. But a book has\nrecently been published by one -- the -- the -- the worker with whom I worked in that\ncamp, and -- but she left before the deportations started, but she set that whole\nliberation process into movement. And is very interesting as she -- she wrote the\nbook, she quotes me in the book. It\u2019s in French, I don\u2019t know how your French 1s,\nand she quotes me. There\u2019s a picture of me in the book and it\u2019s a pre -- the book got a\n-- an award in France. And it\u2019s very interesting, she recalls things that I did and said\nand I have no recollection of them at all. We all have very selective memories, so I --\nI was interesting to read. And at a later date, I would like to tell you a little bit about\nmy reuniting with my coworkers. Is this a good time?",
        "A: Well, you know, but it entails a whole other kind of thing. I-It\u2019s a whole other\nchapter of my life in the United States. And this reconnecting with the past has been\na tremendous thing for me in the last 20 years. When I first came here -- well, I came\nas a student, I went back and then I came, because I\u2019d met my husband, and I really\nwanted to put everything -- everything behind me. I didn\u2019t even speak French to my\nkids. Today I think it was stupid. They could be bilingual so easily, but my husband\ndoesn\u2019t speak French and I certainly didn\u2019t want to speak German and my husband\ndoesn\u2019t -- has even forgotten his German. He doesn\u2019t want anything to do with\nanything German. So I had worked for the Joint Distribution Committee in Paris for a\nyear, in between my -- getting my degree here and then coming back eventually,\nbecause I had to work for my scholarship for -- to repay my scholarship. So, I n-\nnever wrote back to anybody, in any of the agencies, not -- I -- I mean, with very few\nexceptions. There are a few people I may have sent a Rosh Hashanah card or\nsomething like that. And I did go back when -- the first time I went back is in 1952,\nbecause my parents made it possible for us to bring their first grandchild -- not their\nfirst grandchild, they had already a whole bunch of grandchildren. My brother\nmarried much younger than I did. But bring the American grandchild over. And we\nwent over. And yes, I saw maybe one or two friends. One, I worked with during the -\n- in -- after the war and she was from my hometown and maybe we met in Paris, and\nanother one, but it was a very social kind of thing. I didn\u2019t see any -- or didn\u2019t make a\npoint of seeing any of my worker from the Joint Distribution Committee. I always\nwent to see -- no, I didn -- I must correct that. All went -- went to see that one person\nwho was the director of a children\u2019s home, with whom I worked during the war and\nwho after the war became the director of Ose. And I continue, even today. He\u2019s dead,\nbut his wife is in a nursing home and I still write to her a card on the holiday.",
        "A: Monsieur Jobe.",
        "A: And I\u2019m still in touch with her, which is -- and every time we went to Paris, I\nwent to see her. But it wasn\u2019t so much to reminisce, it was just because we had --\nwe're good friends, you know? And so I had -- it\u2019s on the level of friendship, not to\ntalk about the war, or not to talk about anything. And other than that, I never talked\nabout my experiences. And as a matter of fact, to make sure, I asked my friend from\nCleveland, the one who came to visit this [indecipherable] and we -- we -- I was\ngoing to say we grew up -- no, we grew our children at the same time. We had\nchildren the same age and she was a concert scholarship student too, from Italy, who\ncame after me, to Cleveland. And I barely knew what she did during the war, or -- I -\n- I sort of know. And when we went to visit them a few years ago, in Florida, she\nsays, \u201cWhat did you actually do during the war?\u201d I said, \u201cOh, come on. You know. I\nmean, you\u2019ve known me all these years.\u201d She said we never talked about it. So I had\nconfirmation of the fact that I never talked about it. And I entered into a community\nof German Jews, because my husband is from Germany and through -- because he\nlived with a German family when I met him, he had room with a German -- German\nJewish family and we entered this whole German Jewish community, with which I\nreally had -- with whom I had very little in common -- but you didn\u2019t have to explain\nthings to them, they knew what the score was. I didn\u2019t have to tell them about these\nthings. They had -- they had not lived -- they had escaped. So -- did I tell my\nchildren? Yes, I\u2019m sure I talked about it. They know about it. But their dad went\nthrough -- but when -- what I went through, I\u2019ve talked to them about these things.\nThey knew about it, but I -- other than that, I never, in public talked about it.",
        "A: Well, it is such a natural evolution that it\u2019s universal. And when I talk -- and I\nthought maybe [indecipherable] in America. But when I talked to my friends, my\ncontemporaries and friends, they did the same thing. They needed -- as it was a need\nto -- to forget. There was a need to put behind. And then there is a change. You really\nneed to -- to -- to fill out your past again and to -- to fill out these detail. But I -- it is\na -- but with me, there was one more thing. That was in fran -- my friends in France\ntold me, \u201cSilonce for 30 years.\u201d Silence for 30 years. And this is -- this is true. For 30\nyears. And I think there was something else here. There was -- when -- when in it --\nwhen I made an attempt to ac -- to, yeah, explain something sometimes, about the\nwar, or about the war [indecipherable] -- there was such lack of comprehension on\nthe part of people I was talking to, that it shut me off. Sometimes very stupid\nquestions. I still get them today, these stupid questions.",
        "A: And there was a difficult -- and I -- and I -- I -- it -- it\u2019s amazing, I still do get\nthem occasionally, I mean -- what right -- what rights did they have to arrest you?\nWhat rights do you have during a war? You know, I mean, a teacher asked me those\nquestion in front of the students. What am I saying, what a stupid ques -- you know?\nIt\u2019s this kind of thing that I still get, and there was also -- you have to explain and\nexplain, and if I say -- if in France I say, heevsall, everybody knows what I\u2019m\ntalking. If I say AEF, [indecipherable] de France, everybody knows. You don\u2019t even\nsay AEF, you say [indecipherable] and everybody knows that is the Jewish scouting\nmovement.",
        "A: And here I have to go into explanation.",
        "A: And I -- I just couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t cope with that. And -- but coming to this\ncountry was a tremendous change for me in every aspect, as -- as you heard, about\nJudaism, it was different, it was entering a real professional life, because I had a -- a\ndegree. Before that I worked, but I didn\u2019t have a real, professional degree. That\ndoesn\u2019t mean I did better or worse, it just meant that -- and it was starting a career.\nAnd frankly and truly, it was a -- a struggle to get ahead and my parents had lost\neverything, weren\u2019t able to give me any money coming over. I think we spend\neverything they gave me on just buying enough stuff to -- to have a kitchen and a --\nand a room and stuff like that. So, my husband didn\u2019t have his degree yet. He went to\nschool at night. I had a job on the weekend, a job during the week and -- and I just\ndidn\u2019t dwell on that. So -- some of the --",
        "A: I know exactly when it happened. It was in the late -- in the mid 70\u2019s or early\nseven -- mid 70\u2019s, I cannot quite peg it. The council of Jewish women in clee -- in\nSyracuse, where we lived -- well, people knew that I was from France, that I had\ndone some underground work, or had worked in camp and -- I mean, th-there was\nsome general knowledge, but I had never, sort of really going a -- I think that once\nsisterhood asked me to participate in a program -- they will have other people who\nhad lived in Europe and I -- I must have sa-said a few word. But then, the Council of\nJewish women was working with the educators in Syracuse to introduce the\nHolocaust in their curriculum. And now we\u2019re going to a very touchy subject. And I\nwas asked to participate. This is the first time where I really did something officially,\nas a witness of the Holocaust, if you wish. That\u2019s the best definition I can come,\nbecause I don\u2019t view myself as a survivor, I don\u2019t view myself as -- I -- I was a\nrescuer, but at the same time was also a victim. So I always say I\u2019m a witness of the\nHolocaust. And so I participated in that. And then something fantastic happened. We\nseparated in two groups. One group was younger women, was -- they were mostly\nwomen, who wanted to create a group of children of survivors. And the other group\nwanted to meet with teachers and talk about curriculum. And I went with the children\nof survivors. And all of a sudden, I find myself much older than these people. They\nwere actually mostly professional women, whom I had known in the professional --\nmy professional li -- had no idea they were Jewish and certainly no idea they were\nchildren of survivors. And they -- each one of them were talking about their\nexperience -- I\u2019m sure you know the syndrome of children of survivors and how the\nbooks have been written about them and I had read the book -- Epstein\u2019s book, \u201cThe\nChildren of the Holocaust.\u201d And, as I listened to them and they asked me where I fit\nin out of it, I began to tell them of my experience. And I cried and I cried. I\u2019m still\ncrying today. And all of a sudden, the floodgates opened. I had never done that\nbefore. It was like yay, you have a lot of grieving to do. You have a lot of unfinished\nbusiness. And they created -- there\u2019s a group, I helped them create it and -- but I\ndidn\u2019t become a part of it, because I was too close to them. Although I\u2019m a therapist\nand I\u2019m a psychiatric social worker. And I -- they wanted somebody -- a\nprofessional, to lead their group. I -- I was -- I was -- I couldn\u2019t. I was too close to\nthat kind of thing. But it told me that I had a lot of work to do. Now, I didn\u2019t start the\nnext day with task one, two and three, but I allowed myself to -- to let the -- all these\nmemories get into me. And I was aware of having been affected by -- by -- by all of\nthese experiences, in very strange ways. I would see a program of refugees on the\nroad in Bangladesh or wherever and I\u2019d burst in tears. So I know that -- I mean, we\nwere expelled, we fled, we were on the road for -- for days and nights and all of this -\n- so I knew I had that in me, unresolved. And so -- and little by little, I began to talk\nmore about this. I accepted. I didn\u2019t really do much in Syracuse. This was more in the\n70\u2019s. Maybe I gave a talk or two, maybe at the synago -- I don\u2019t know pr-precisely,\nbut I was able to talk about it. And then -- oh, there\u2019s something else happened. Since\nmy husband traveled, as he told you, a great deal, internationally, I had the\nopportunity at one point -- he was working for two weeks in Paris and I must have\nbeen able to take two weeks off. And I went with him to Paris and for the first time I\nreconnected with my cousins in Paris, I have four cousins in Paris. And I had been --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: -- weeks in Paris and I must have been able to take two weeks off. And I went\nwith him to Paris and for the first time I reconnected with my cousins in Paris, I have\nfour cousins in Paris. And I had been totally cut off from them and two of them were\nthe girls I had hidden and two of them were other cousins and all of them, in some\nway were connected to me, because after the war they were -- I -- they were in the\ninstitutions --",
        "A: Can go on?",
        "A: They were in the institution and the children\u2019s home where I trained -- they -- they\nwere -- they were part of the staff, they wen -- and in later years I found out they\nalways looked up to me because I was older and because also their parents told --\nthey also hated me, because their parents say, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you do what Simone did?\u201d\nYou know, that kind. So, a mixed feeling. But I really connected. We visited. In these\ntwo weeks, I remember vividly, staying with one of my cousins and all five of us\nsitting on the floor in this upstairs room and talking about our families. The two girls\nwho had loved their parents, my -- they have a perception of my parents, I have a\nperception of their parents. And so family stuff, also. The skeletons. I remember we\nhad -- they re -- had a perception of my father, I had a perception of their parent and\nwe talked about that. And it was therapeutic.",
        "A: Well, I -- in -- in these trips to France, I remember allowing myself to reconnect\nwith some of -- not only the relatives, but with the people I had worked with during\nthe war, those who were still living. And -- and then sharing our memories, on a very\none to one basis, the re -- one or the other, one I\u2019d worked in camp with or one I\u2019d\nworked in the children\u2019s home with and -- and it became -- I became aware that all of\na sudden, I wanted to -- to -- to -- to check out my memories and to share them. And\nit felt wonderful, because there I didn\u2019t have the lack of understanding. I had instant\ncomprehension, you know, it was -- we were on the same wavelength. And we talked\nand -- now I cannot say that we stayed in touch, because none of us are really\ncorresponding. But I fairly frequently went to France, but mostly what happened was\nthat I was able to talk about my experiences here. Now, it\u2019s a universal phenomenon\nfor survival, is to not have talked about their experiences for 30 years and it is shared\nby the people in France and it\u2019s shared by people here. It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a universal\nthing. And I had read about the Holocaust, I had read Elie Wiesel\u2019s book. Elie\nWiesel, by the way, was a kid of Ose, who had been coming to France to -- to -- in 19\n-- ever -- I\u2019d -- and I\u2019d -- the end of the war, and he was rescued by Ose, whe -- in\none of the children\u2019s homes. And the director of that children\u2019s home 1s one of my\nvery good friends, and so we\u2019ve talked about him. And every time I go to Paris I see\nher and we talk about these kids, we talk about -- we talk about all these things of the\npast. And I think that enabled me to begin to talk about my experiences. I\u2019m not sure\nexactly when, exactly, and with what group, but I had to go through that journey of\nreconnecting and it really d -- the -- the -- the cath -- the cathartic point was when I\nhad that meeting with this -- this [indecipherable] of survival, when I became aware\nthat -- that all that grieving that I hadn\u2019t done -- nobody had time to grieve, you had\nto -- you had to go on and that I -- I had to -- to go back 1n all this experience and talk\nabout them. And then, in 1982, we moved to France -- 1983, we moved to France. I\nretired from -- [ -- at that time I was on the faculty of the Upstate Medical Center in\nthe Department of Pediatrics and Child Psychiatry. And I was in private practice,\nworking with families of young children. And I was ready to retire, to say the least.\nAnd in France, I became very active in the Jewish community in which we lived. We\nlived in Lyon, in -- outside of Lyon, we live in -- in a suburb of Lyon. But we\nbecame very active again, in creating a Jewish community, but that\u2019s another kind of\nstory. Although it\u2019s the same story, but again we were at a nucleus of creating\nsomething there.",
        "A: Well, we\u2019ve seen in --",
        "A: Well, what was very important, is that in Judaism is very sterile -- th-the kind --\nthe kind we encountered in France was very sterile and there was a -- th-there is a\ntradition of Judaism and people belong, but they don\u2019t go, you know, because there is\nno alternative. And I have two cousins in Lyon and th-they were o-of that branch of\ntotally -- of not knowing what they were doing and having really no significant\nJewish life, but belonging to something that is so traditional, that God forbid you\ndon\u2019t change it, kind of thing. And there are some -- there is a liberal community in\nFrance, it\u2019s called the j -- |-liberal Judaism. There\u2019s two -- two -- two flavors. But\nthere was nothing in Lyon and somebody found out that we were, quote, not -- I\nmean, liberal Jews. I don\u2019t know what that means in -- in their definition, that we --\nthat we were welcoming, you know, another form of Judaism. I don\u2019t know how it\ngot spread. I became very active with the equivalent of Hadassah, I\u2019m a member here\nof Hadassah, but I have never been a -- that women\u2019s organization kind of -- first of\nall I was working full time -- not full time, I was working all my life and I just\nhaven\u2019t had -- gave all my extra energy to the synagogue and to it\u2019s various\nprograms. I have done so many program. A -- that I had nothing left for women\u2019s\norganization. I\u2019m a life member of the National Council of Jewish Women, because I\nowe them, and -- but I have not been active. But in France I became active with the\nveetsu. I ba -- I devised their programs and still today, they are following in my\nfootsteps. I managed t-to -- their programs and became very f -- brought somebody to\n-- to their meetings who became a very dear friend and she\u2019s still active in bringing\na program [indecipherable]. But I was a program whatever -- chair or whatever there\n-- not such ti -- but I activated that very -- that kind of thing.",
        "A: And they\u2019re following in my way of doing thing. And also in -- in the -- in this\nJewish community -- see, France --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It -- it -- it has to do with -- with regard to law -- Jewish law -- I\u2019m not strict with\nJewish law --",
        "A: But I\u2019m all -- well, th-the political implication, I don\u2019t know [indecipherable], so\nI\u2019m talking much more about [indecipherable] about dus -- ame -- observing the fine\npoints of -- of Jewish law, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. But for me, it\u2019s also much\nmore being -- since I view Judaism as having evolved over the centuries, I do not\nview it as fixed, I view it as a historical Judaism, Conservative Judaism 1s historical\nJudaism. It views that Judaism has changed over -- over the centuries, according to\nthe ages in which it lived. The Judaism of Moses is not the Judaism of Miamanidis\nand is not the ju -- and is not the Judaism of Rabbi Kaplan or of whoever the chief\nrabbi in Israel 1s. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s evolves constantly and to me that is the important.\nIt has to be dynamic, it has to change with the days. And in France, it was so rigid\nwhen we came back to France. The women sitting upstairs, that sits very well with\nme. And the women downs -- the men downstairs and I upstairs and they didn\u2019t even\nhave -- when the Torah reading came, they didn\u2019t have a hamas -- a -- a book to read\nthe Torah reading. So I went downstairs and asked one of the men if I could have a\nhama -- he looked at me as if I were from another planet, you know? A women who\ncan follow the Torah reading. So, you know, it\u2019s this kind of attitude that say I can\u2019t\nworship here. So, you know, we tried the -- the -- North African community in which\nwe lived, I mean they were even more rigid. And then they -- Judaism in France,\ntraditional Judaism does not accept conversions that are not made by Orthodox rabbi\n-- it\u2019s a little bit like in Israel. So there were many converts in -- who had no place to\ngo, so they formed their own liberal mo -- le mouvement liberale juivre de France.\nAnd -- but they had nobody to lead it. So some -- they wanted us to help them and we\nmet at people\u2019s houses. And who carried the burden [indecipherable]. So they asked\nme to become the president. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not a citizen. I\u2019m an American citizen. You\ncan\u2019t have a president who is not a citizen and incorporate this group. I don\u2019t -- and I\ndon\u2019t want to be and I\u2019m leaving again. I\u2019m not staying here.\u201d And they were totally\non the wrong tracks. But we -- we participated and whatever.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t a -- it was a group of people and we were the only -- I mean, oh, in -- in\ntheir 40\u2019s, 50\u2019s.",
        "A: Eee, oh, nobody as old as we were. Oh, although my -- we were still working --\nno, more 50ish, meta -- the oldest maybe in their 50\u2019s, late 50\u2019s, 60.",
        "A: Well, I was younger then, too. I was only har -- I was only in my 60\u2019s too, at the\ntime, so yeah, and --",
        "A: Never thought about it. I think -- I don\u2019t know. I hadn\u2019t thought about that. I want\n-- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s interesting, because this new group we are trying to participate with, they\nwant to be all inclusive, t -- and -- and I would like to include them, but also I want --\nat the same time I want some -- I want my tradition to remain, s-see what I mean, a --\nthe things that are important to me. To me, the core of -- of thing like -- we have\ntraveled a great deal. I have attended service in Istanbul and I\u2019ve attended service in\nStockholm and I have attended services all over. And to me, this is fantastic, that I\ncan walk in there and I know enough of the service that I can open whatever prayer\nbook they give me. It\u2019s always Hebrew. The Hebrew is the Hebrew. The service is\nthe same, bu -- it\u2019s a -- this -- this -- this fantastic thing that binds Jews from all over\nthe world. T-To me this 1s -- and I -- and I\u2019m very grateful that I have the Jewish\nknowledge to be able to enjoy this. To -- you know, I -- we went with a group of\npeople to istan -- service at Istanbul and of course the women were upstairs. What\nelse is new? And so I -- I listen, I listen and it\u2019s a different pronunciation and all that,\nbut I know where I am. There was a -- one other woman, she was a rabbi\u2019s wife and\nshe found her place too. And they all said, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d But you know, for a\nlifelong attendance at service and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- so, what a -- I don\u2019t want this to be\ndestroyed by rigidity. I want it to be alive with variety. I don\u2019t know what else to say.\n[ -- | haven\u2019t put it in words. And that\u2019s to me 1s exciting. So, getting into a new\ngroup, that\u2019s -- wants to be inclusive and yet at the same time maintain some\ntradition, that\u2019s what\u2019s important to me, so we tried that, we were not very successful\nin France, because we were the only ones who really were with any contin -- no,\npeople were floating in and out. Eventually, for the high holidays, we went to\nGeneva, Switzerland, which was an hour and a half away and spent the high holidays\nthere. Ah, because they had a very interesting international community there, with a\nrabbi who was trained in Cincinnati and so we had a very interesting service there\nand we felt very welcome and they included a lot of English -- English and French in\nthe service. And they -- and it was okay. See, even though I do understand the -- the -\n- the Hebrew, I want the -- the secular language to be included. To -- to include more\npeople. This is too important to me, is to include people. So, anyway, so we lived in\nFrance and there I all -- there I really connected. First of all, Ose, the agency for\nwhich I worked, was doing their archives and they send a interviewer to Lyon and I\ndid an oral tape for them, of course in French. And the woman with whom I worked\nin Rivesaltes, who was already at Rivesaltes when I got there -- she was a philosophy\nstudent from a completely assimilated family who didn\u2019t even know what Hanukkah\nwas --and, so I don\u2019t know what brought her to the camp, but that\u2019s her problem, not\nmine. And she became the director of Ose. And so we got in touch with her, because\nshe read my report and she related to it. And that --",
        "A: Vivette Samuel. She\u2019s the one who wrote the book, by the way.",
        "A: And then, we were there when she got the Chevalier de la legion d\u2019honor. The\nLegion of Honor in France, a big ceremony, which I attended.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: For her -- for her.",
        "A: And so I attended that in Paris and while I was in Paris attending that, I met\npeople who told me, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember? Yo -- we met here and you slept in my\nroom there and --\u201d I don\u2019t remember these things. But 1t was wonderful, because all\nthese people were part of my past. I -- it was almost like reclaiming a piece of myself.\nAnd so allowed myself to open up and to -- to hear all these things, to talk about all\nthese things, to cry about these thing. So these three years in France, I -- I did that\noral history and I -- and I -- I really was able to -- to share a great deal. And at the\nsame time, I really reconnected with my cousins. And Jew -- they were not -- they --\nthey be not -- that doesn\u2019t -- I ma -- I -- it was family and we talked about our -- we --\nwe filled all our holes in our memories about our parents and grandparents and that.\nIn the meanwhile, th -- since then, I\u2019ve done a lot of genealogical work out -- one of\nour sons is very interested in that and he is on the computer and doing all kinds of\nstuff. And so, I have send them all this stuff too and I found a cousin on my father\u2019s\nside and all this kind of thing has hap -- I mean, he found me, I didn\u2019t find him, he\nfound me. And so, all of this has been very, very beneficial to -- to me. And so when\nI came back from France and we settled down here and we joined a congregation, a\nConservative one. And I joined the educa -- adult education committee, what else?\nAnd the [indecipherable] committee. It was not as satisfactory, because the memories\nof our congregation in Syracuse are such that we can never duplicate that. It was --\nyou cannot recreate an extended family like that when you\u2019re older than the rest of\nthe peop -- you can no longer move in the same -- in the same way. So we, sadly we -\n- we have not connected in our congregation. But, coming back to my work there, I\ngave several talks. I offered to -- because I was part of adult education, I gave a talk\nabout my experiences. And this led to my being the Holocaust speaker, maybe about\nSIX years ago, seven years ago, I was -- on Yom HaShoah, there 1s Holocaust day, I\nwas the speaker for this -- the whole Chapel Hill community. It was extremely well\nattended and I was able to di -- I -- I wrote a paper, a -- you know, based on my\nexperience and I mostly talked about what we alluding to before, how do you talk\nabout the Holocaust. And I had read an article by Rabbi Shulweiss. He\u2019s a rabbi in\nEncino Valley in -- in -- in California. And he\u2019s always been one of my gurus, one of\nthe people I like to read. He\u2019s very liberal minded and he is -- we actually -- when we\nwere in California -- we took a trip to California about 11 years ago and we made it a\npoint to be, on Saturday, in -- in that area, so we could attend services. Well, he -- he\nis such a personal person. I mean, he comes and shakes your hand and where are you\nfrom? And I know somebody in Chapel Hill and this -- this kind of thing. But he 1s\nliberal, he is -- he writes beautifully, he is -- he is my kind of rabbi. I\u2019ve never had\none like that. And he had written about telling his children about the Holocaust and\nhow do you tell them about it and how he had great deal of difficulties dealing with\nthis and telling his children about the Holocaust, until he found about -- found out\nabout the Righteous Gentiles and about the people who have helped, during the --\nduring the war in -- in all countries. And that not, quote, everybody was against the\nJews, unquote. There were people helping. And by looking at that aspect of the --\nwhat happened during the war, he was able to then talk to his children about the other\nthings that happened.",
        "A: Because it -- it puts -- number one, a posit af -- a positive aspect on the -- on what\nseems like a ca -- total inhumanity of man against man and that\u2019s all you hear about.\nBut there was a humane aspect, at least in some of the people. And the second thing\nis, in talking to the children about these horrible things that happened, from time\nimmorial whether it\u2019s from Haman down to all the generations of the Crusades and\nwhat have you, all our kids hear is about the persecution. But when you can tell them\nabout people who\u2019ve helped the Jews and are still helping the Jews, you can m-\nmodify that message. And when you -- and to me there is one more point, if you can\ntalk about things that Jews have achieved, they\u2019re -- next to the Holocaust Museum,\nthere should be a museum of the -- learning through the ages, the -- I\u2019m not talking\nabout the Nobel Prizes, the Jewish Nobel Prizes or the Jewish basketball players. I\u2019m\ntalking about the wisdom of -- of the ages, of the si -- of the -- the learning that took\nplace, the contributions to -- to everything. And you have to balance it all. And so,\nthis was the gist of my talk. I talked about -- I didn\u2019t talk about what I did -- I can\nnever talk about what I did during the war. This, to me, is -- number one it\u2019s too\npersonal and number two, it\u2019s I focus -- I want to focus on the children and -- and\nwhat happened to them. But I also wanted to -- with this -- this reading of -- this\nthing about -- that Rabbi Shulweiss wrote, I was able to focus also on the rescue\naspect. And then I can wean myself into that whole rescuing effort. But I\u2019m a Jew,\nrescuing my own. You know, it\u2019s not quite the same as non-Jew rescuing.",
        "A: And this is -- so this is my talk that I gave and from then on I have been in\ndemand. And at first I was not very selective and I accepted all the offers, feeling that\nI had a duty, a responsibility, and -- and becoming aware that indeed, you have to\ntalk in the first person. You -- this is the real stuff, that can touch you. And this\nsummer, I feel very virtuous, I cleaned out my files, because I was home so much.\nAnd I have stacks and stacks of letters from kids in schools where I talked about.\nAnd I keep those. I have thrown out a lot of stuff in my life, but I\u2019m keeping these. I\nhope my children and grandchildren would see them, because they\u2019ve been touched\nby -- by the real thing and so, although I usually tell them I don\u2019t -- that -- that other\npeople have known what I have done and that kind of thing. I said, I have to tell them\nspecifically what I did, otherwise not real to them. So I have learned to do that in\nvarious, different ways. And of course I have -- I\u2019ve talked. I give a li -- different\nemphasis whether I talk at the university or whether I talk at the church youth group\nand you know, it\u2019s different, focus is different, [indecipherable] is different, pattern.\nBut I\u2019ve been able to do it as a berd -- on -- as I told you earlier. And just last year, I\ndid so many that it was really exhausting and then I -- I\u2019m doing -- handling it very\nwell, while I\u2019m -- my audience -- and I don\u2019t need any notes, I don\u2019t need any papers\nand I just talk and I -- I love to talk in public. This is -- by the way, is -- I don\u2019t write.\nI have never been able to write and even in my very successful schooling, writing\nwas always a problem. And my teachers tore out their hair and they didn\u2019t know why\nI was so good in everything else, and not in writing. So writing is something I don\u2019t\ndo. But I make an outline -- I make myself an outline, once I know I have to have a\nbeginning and a middle and an end and I have to clearly define in my introduction\nwhat I\u2019m going to cover and then I zoom and I talk. And that\u2019s how -- like I said, I\ndon\u2019t have my written talks, except for the one that I gave at this conference at UNC,\nwhere they were supposed to be published in a book. They never were, but I really\nwrote out something on rescue and resistance. And so until last year, I found out that\nI had this after reaction of arrhythmia -- of irregular heartbeat. When it happened the\nfirst time, I didn\u2019t quite relate, but it happened the second time, after I gave a talk,\nand then I went to see a doctor and I\u2019m on medication. So I have been slowing down\non this a little bit. And I heard a speaker from England, a wonderful person, a non-\nJew, who has devoted his life to teaching the Holocaust -- in -- in England, Steven\nSmith, who created the one and only teaching Holocaust museum in England and he\n-- after hi -- an experience in Israel, when he went to Yad Vashem and came back to\ndevote his life to this and I heard him talk here, in a small group. Somebody brought\nhim over and then I told him about, you know, my difficulty to continue talking. He\nsays, \u201cBut then, don\u2019t do it. Let somebody else do it.\u201d And I have to accept the fact\nthat I\u2019m not going to do as much of that any more. But I must go and tell you about\nsomething else that has given me back so much in the last few years. About five --\nit'll be five years this December, Ose had, in celebration, I believe of the 80th\nanniversary of the creation of Ose in -- in Russia, a reunion in Paris of the hidden\nchildren. The children they had hidden during the war. And of course I went. And to\nme, this has been the highlight of my last few years here and a tremendously\nimportant experience. Because, when I -- as I have given these interviews, as I\u2019m\ndoing with you today. Or as I\u2019m being -- talk and s -- people ask me for specifics, I\ndon\u2019t remember specifics. I don\u2019t remember names of kids, I don\u2019t remember specific\nfacts. Is it because in the early years here, I really so blocked out everything that it\u2019s\nblocked away totally? I don\u2019t know. Or did I just not invest myself enough in these\nkids that I don\u2019t remember them? I felt a guilt --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: -- years here, I really so blocked out everything that it\u2019s blocked away totally? I\ndon\u2019t know. Or did I just not invest myself enough in these kids that I don\u2019t\nremember them? I felt a guilt that I maybe didn\u2019t put enough of myself into them.\nWell, little by little, I reconne -- first of all, I reconnected -- a woman who lives in\nRichmond tried to find me, because I had been her social worker and her counselor\nand what have you -- and --",

        "A: Oh, teen-ager, 16? 14 - 15 - 16? And then, apparently, when I was in the\nunderground, I hid her in a convent. I say apparently, because I don\u2019t remember. And\nwhen the war was over and I reopened the first children\u2019s home, I took her into that\nchildren\u2019s home and she was in the sewing room and she showed me pictures of her\nwith me and all that. I don\u2019t remember. And she found me where we were living in\nFrance. She happened to be on sabbatical with her husband, who is at the university\nin Richmond and she\u2019s an artist. She had come to this country to unite with family\nand it didn\u2019t work out, as so often it didn\u2019t, but she made a life for herself. Had no\nchildren. And so she told me all that story and then we have -- now, whenever we go\nthrough Richmond, I see her. Whenever she comes down here -- she was here\nrecently and she did a lot of beautiful artwork and have it in -- and she gave me a lot\nof her work. And she has such a positive memory of the things I did on behalf of her\nfamily and herself, that I was astounded. I was -- I mean, anybody thinks that much.\nYou know, I had just sort of -- because I -- I couldn\u2019t remember these things, I\nthought maybe I hadn\u2019t put anything into it. And then there was this reunion in\nFrance. And here I was with my husband and there were 500 children between the\nages of 55 and 70, I would say, coming from all over the world. Of course, the\nmajority from France, but they were from Israel, they were from Argentina, they\nwere from the United States, from England, from all over. And they were looking for\npieces of themselves in -- in other\u2019s memories. And pictures were plastered all over,\nfor people looking each other. Be -- I stayed with my cousin, so I didn\u2019t stay there the\nwhole time, but I attended all the meeting. And some people were looking for me.\nSome kids were looking for me. There was particularly one woman, I mean th-this\none had phoned me already. She had gone to Paris seeking -- looking for anybody\nshe had been connected with during the war, because she had lost all her family. And\nshe lived in Toronto and she had, through somebody at the information center on the\nHolocaust, she had ga -- f -- happened to meet somebody whom I worked with\nduring the war, and gave her my addre -- and she wrote to me and I found out that I\nwas the director of the children\u2019s home, after the war, where she was. And she told\nme any number of stories about me and the things I did. Including serving these kids\nbreakfast in bed on Shabbat morning, because I don\u2019t remember it. She told me ab --\nthat -- the stories I told on Friday night, that she had kept with her all her life. I don\u2019t\nremember. But it must have been me and then it must have have happened. And then\nin Paris, the most fantastic thing that happened wa -- there was Friday evening\nservice -- there were Friday evening of wet -- at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon,\nbecause sundown is at four o\u2019clock and it\u2019s winter and this December. So we had\nservices, maybe five o\u2019clock, it was dark and women upstairs, men downstairs. And\nI\u2019m -- we all had now name tags and on the name tags we had put down where we\nhad been with children\u2019s homes and the name of children home, the camps and so on.\nBut nothing distinguished the social workers from -- the workers from the -- the\nchildren, the counselor, and we all had the same nametag. So I had the Rivesaltes and\nMoultanta and Polousa -- the names of place -- the name. And --",
        "A: Oh well, I -- I have to count. First Rivesaltes and then I worked in a children\u2019s\nhome called Polousa and then I worked in the underground and then I worked -- I\nopened a children\u2019s home in Moultanta and then one outside of Paris. So, for this\nagency, I worked in four different places. And so -- and of course there were workers\nthere and I knew many of the workers and it was wonderful to talk with the workers.\nSome came from Israel, some came from elsewhere and, \u201cDo you remember, you\nslept in my room that night when you were arrested?\u201d \u201cI did? I don\u2019t remember.\u201d\nAnd that kind of thing. But up -- up in that service on Friday afternoon, next to me\nsits a very elegant woman in her fur coat and she jerks around and says in French to\nme, \u201cWhere you from?\u201d And I said, \u201cFrom America.\u201d And she says, \u201cOh, you look\nso French. I thought you were from France.\u201d So I says, \u201cI\u2019m a little bit from both.\u201d\nAnd then she looks at my tags. \u201cOh, you were in Rivesaltes?\u201d All the way -- all the\ntime thinking that I\u2019m one of the kids, too, you know, because it doesn\u2019t say social\nworker or worker or any -- or counselor or anything like that. And she said, \u201cWhen\nwere you there?\u201d And I s -- told her. And then she says, \u201cI was in Rivesaltes. My\nparents were in Rivesaltes, they were deported. My brother was in Rivesaltes. And a\nsocial worker took me out of the camp, although I was over 16, she faked my papers.\nAnd I shall all remember her, she took me out and took me to such and such a pla --.\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cWhat was -- what was the name of the social worker?\u201d And she said,\n\u201cSimone Weil.\u201d And it was just absolutely incredible. We just fell into each other\u2019s\narms and -- and then she happens to know my sister-in-law and all the store -- that --\nshe survived, obviously, in hiding. And she married a Jewish -- French Jewish man\nwho knew my family and so that\u2019s why she knew about my family, about my\nbrother. And we talked and when the service was over, we went downstairs, we met\nthe men and we\u2019ve -- and then she\u2019s been writing to me -- you know, not much, but -\n- but through her, somebody else got in touch with me and then there was the woman\nin -- in Toronto who got somebody else in touch with me. And these kids, in\nquotation mark, have given me back so much in -- of my own memories. And\nvalidating someone, myself or my work, which I had completely devaluated, because\nof my lack of memory, that maybe that\u2019s what has enabled me to give all these talks.\nAnd to -- to really talk about the children, because they have enriched my memories\ntremenda -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s ust been incredible. And then books have been written, books\nthat describe experiences that have been mine and I have read them and so this has\nbeen my latest journey, as of the last five years. And we\u2019ve gone back to France. In\nfact, next year would be our 50th wedding anniversary and we plan to go back to\nStrasbourg, where I still have a cousin. And so we -- each time I go now, we\nreconnect and so, at that conference, I had another fantastic experience. We met --\nwh-when I say we, I mean we, all retired social workers -- not social worker -- all\nprofessional workers of the same vintage, within a year or two, who had all worked\nfor Ose during the war, either in the camp -- three of us -- four of us were from the\ncamp and had worked in Rivesaltes. One was the wife of the -- the widow of the --\nthe head of our underground team and another one w-was the worker who was in the\nchildren\u2019s home, but we all, in one capacity or another had been connected to this\nwork. We met together after the conference. And it was the most wonderful thing\nthat happened to me. Something that doesn\u2019t exist for me in this country. There\u2019s no\none I can talk like that. And my husband wasn\u2019t part of that. He -- he -- he -- he\n[indecipherable] went up the Eiffel Tower or something, but anyway, we had this\nwonderful sharing and I needed it. Maybe they needed me too, there, but --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: He\u2019s a very introverted person. A very private person. Also he -- he was a -- a\nvery lonely child when he grew up. His siblings were much older and he was really\nleft to his own devices. And has very traumatic memories of his childhood, but he\nhas made contact --",
        "A: Oh yes, all related to the war, and then he was alone in boarding school in\nEngland and then he came here and -- but finally -- we\u2019ve talked about this a great\ndeal. Finally he has made contact with the Speedwerk Foundation to do an\ninterview. Now, they -- they called him, they said yes, we will work you\n[indecipherable] and I hope it\u2019s going to happen, because I wish he would. We did\ntake one trip with our grown -- before our children got married, our sons, when we\nwere living in France, we all went to Germany, to his house and to his village. And\nthere he -- while we were there he was able to talk to the children a little bit about --\nin the cemeteries full of Lipmans and all that. Can we stop for a minute?",
        "A: I want to put the air conditioner on.",
        "A: I\u2019m getting very -- 1s that [inaudible]\nsomething about -- and it was related, I think even -- in fact, when you were speaking\nabout your -- the gaps in your memory and the things that you blocked out, that you\ndidn\u2019t remember a lot of the children, because you were afraid to get too close. And I\nwas wondering how -- how that played out in your own family? Did -- did you\ncontinue to be a person who was afraid to get close to people? Or were -- were you\nthe opposite?",
        "A: Now that I know that, 1t probably was not a failure to get close to the children that\nbroke off my memory, but rather a -- a whole blocking out of -- of -- of feeling\nrelated to these memories. I -- I don\u2019t think it interfered with my relationships with\nmy children at all. I don\u2019t think so. We have a very -- we have a close relationship.\nWe -- it did not interfere with my work. I -- as I told you, I -- I worked in a variety of\nsetting, dealing with children. I started out by being the director of a day care center,\nwhere I chose not to remain the director, but to become the case worker, because I\nwanted to learn to work directly with children. I interrupted my career for four years\nto be alone at home, you know, one child in two rooms upstairs. Peter sometime ask,\n\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d He ask in his multiple room, multiple bathroom house that\neverybody has these day. And somehow it must have worked out, because I\nremember incidents where I was getting cl-claustrophobic and with one child at\nhome and I remember vividly -- it\u2019s just a little incident and I spanked him and I was\nenraged and wha -- you know, on the verge of being abusive mother and I\u2019m joking,\nbut you know, when you\u2019re at -- at home with a kid all the time. And many years\nlater, when he was at college, he was filling out these papers and some -- some kind\nof study where he ask whether he was ever spanked when he was a kid and he\nanswered no and I said, \u201cBut Peter, don\u2019t you remember I spanked you?\u201d I had such\nguilt about it. And --",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- no, I\u2019m not a spanking mothe -- but that day I remember so vivid, I can\nsee myself. I don\u2019t know what he had done or what drove me nuts. And then he said\nhe was never spanked and I said, \u201cBut don\u2019t you remember that day?\u201d You know, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t remember.\u201d And then it occurred to me that when the climate is good, a little\nbit of bad weather doesn\u2019t matter. So the climate must have been good and that was\njust a little bout of bad weather. So, on the whole the climate\u2019s been good and so I\nmust have done something right about that. I worked with children, I -- I went back\nto work in foster care. I went, eventually, when we left Cleveland and my husband\nwas transferred to Syracuse, I interrupted for awhile, because we had just made an --\nhit a new city and Robby was just entering school and I floundered around for\nawhile, not knowing what I wanted to do and Syracuse was -- looked to me like to be\nin the dark ages as compared to Cleveland. Eventually it turned out to be really our\nhighlight in our life. And eventually I went to work for child guidance clinic. And\nthere, for a variety of reason, was able to develop my own style of work, because we\nhad very poor leadership. So, there was one of the benefits of poor leadership, I\n[indecipherable] was able to give papers -- not writing, give paper. And became a\nconsultant to early childhood programs. I became a consultant to preschool, to pre-K,\nto daycare, to nurse -- private nursery school. While I was still on the staff of the -- of\nthe mental health department, the child guidance clinic. And developed all kinds of\nworkshops for all the staff -- the staffs of the various early childhood programs in\nSyracuse, I did any number of training and workshops and stuff like that. So I always\ndealt with children and I have all these wonderful letters of people thanking me.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No. It\u2019s interesting, a -- you know, as I said earlier, neither my husband and I view\nour -- because we\u2019re parents, both of us are parenting our children, we view\nourselves as survivors, but the children of survivors and children of the Holocaust,\ntalk more about their parents who have been in -- in the death camps. And that\u2019s very\ndifferent from having [indecipherable] so we are quite a large step removed from\nthat. And particularly my husband who was not -- I mean he left Germany at -- when\nhe was 17 and was in England. So, he was interned in England, you know, J-Jews\nwere interned -- I mean, Germans were interned in Eng-England, so he was in the\n[indecipherable] he was in a camp, but that camp was a country club compared to\nwhat people in France had to go through. So I don\u2019t think my children considered\nthemselves as children of survivors. They consider -- th-they know their parents have\na history and they have shown some interest in it. I can only compare my family, for\ninstance, to this other woman who w-was a witness 1n Italy and -- and went through\nthat -- who came, also as a counseled student. And she has the same relationship that\nwe have with their three children, we -- we have same age children, with one in\nbetween. And I don\u2019t see any difficulties in these relationships. And interesting\nenough, my husband has a sister in New York, there\u2019s a big age gap and she got\nmarried youn -- married very young and s -- and he got married very late, so the --\nthe generations are very skewed, you know, so she\u2019s already a great grandmother,\nyou know, and we, our grandch-children are not even Bar Mitzvah, you know, so it\u2019s\na big, big gap there. And they have two daughters -- my sister-in-law, they have two\ndaughters and one is in her 60\u2019s already, my niece and her sister. And her sister is a\nfew years younger and her sister considers herself as a chil -- a child of survivors and\nattended all these meetings of a group as child of survivors. And the older sister\ndoesn\u2019t understand it, why does she have that need? So it 1s something entirely\nperceived by the child, for God knows -- a variety of individual reasons, a pass -- this\n-- place in the family, self perception, I don\u2019t know what. But I don\u2019t feel -- the only\nthing that -- both boys married, of course, women born in this country. Have no\nconnection -- I mean, they\u2019re American born women and -- so sometimes I feel there\nis a -- there is a -- a little gap there. Just a little gap there, just like this -- we are -- we\nare not the old generation from the old countries, but we are different. But I cannot\nquantify it or qua -- even qualify it. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s something that I perceive, but I don\u2019t\nthink our children ever felt themself to be any different for having parents who were\nsurvi --except from having parents who mispronounce names [indecipherable] my\nsons made any numbers of -- of jokes about their mother putting the accent on -- on\nsyllable -- on being more strict than most parent. I have a -- you know -- we were\nstrict with our children and I\u2019m not sorry at all about it. And maybe they view that as\nbeing part of our European background, I don\u2019t know. Never talked about it. I don\u2019t\nview that as having been in the way with our children.",
        "A: They\u2019re both engineers. Their father is an engineer.",
        "A: They\u2019re both in computers. And when the three of them get together, I go to the\nkitchen -- no. No, I -- we have a computer and I know how to handle it. So --",
        "A: I wanted so badly to put everything behind me, that I think it -- it\u2019s -- it came\ninstantly. First of all, I spoke the eng -- I spoke the language, quite comfortably. And",
        "A: Well, I was a good student at school. I had six years of English, not like the\nUnited States where you have one year of French and then you drop it all. When we\nhad a language, we had it for six years. I had six years of English, I had -- this -- to\nthat, we were bilingual at home, or trilinguals. F -- Alsatian and French and I\ncouldn\u2019t understand German and I study at home. I learned Hebrew in Hebrew\nschool. I learned Latin, English and Greek simultaneously. I had six years of Latin\nand six years of English. And I\u2019m not totally mixed up, but I am -- I\u2019m doing fairly\nwell with language and so when I got my scholarship, my coworker was just -- if not\nmore qualified than I was, to get a scholarship, but she had no English. And I had not\nspoken English since I left school. This is 1946 and I left school in \u201838. I had not\nspoken English. And I was -- my English was good enough to make straight A\u2019s in\ngraduate school at Tulane. But it was lousy to go and -- every day living. I never\nraised my hand in class. I could write, but I couldn\u2019t really express myself. And I\ncouldn\u2019t order anything in a c -- restaurant or anything, for a long time. But when I\ncame back and we were married, there was not a problem. I remember kids in\ndaycare laughing at me because in saying -- saying Bobby, I said booby. You know,\nand they laughed because an O 1s an O and not a R, you know? It\u2019s not Bobby, it\u2019s\nbooby. And I learned to disregard French phonetics and -- little by little. How did I\nfeel -- I remember -- I don\u2019t even remember being sworn in, but I remember I became\na citizen after five years. That\u2019s technical. And it\u2019s interesting that while we lived in\nFrance for three years, recently -- I mean, that\u2019s 15 years ago. Gosh, it\u2019s 17 years\nago. And I was very happy to be there. I enjoyed it, however, as an American. It was\nnot -- I loved to go there, but boy I -- this is home. Oh, totally. And --",
        "A: My life\u2019s been here, the majority of my life, all -- I mean, I was 26 when I came\nand I\u2019m 78 now. Many more years here. My kids are here, but mostly my\ngrandchildren are here. My profession is here. My -- I don\u2019t even have the\nprofessional language to discuss anything in French, you know? I -- I couldn\u2019t -- my\n-- my French 1s -- is very good and when we lived near France I had a ball, because I\nconfused everybody by saying that I was American and speaking French very well.\nYou know, that kind of jo -- but -- and I enjoyed every moment we were there. I\nmissed a lot of the co -- house ease and comfort that we have in America because\neverything is -- was a little more complicated there. Although we had everything we\nneeded. But home is here, coming back to my kids and to m -- I mean, my kids live\nmiles away, but this is where I c-can express my thoughts, my feelings. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m\nnot much a student any more in France, you know?",

She was\ndeported from the village in which she grew up, into Hanover. She never made it out\nof Germany. She finally got the papers to leave. We don\u2019t know why she waited so\nlong. By the time she decided, it was too late to get papers and she was eventually\nput in the Riga ghetto in Latvia and then from Riga, she was then put into labor camp\nin Stutthof and through the Holocaust Museum\u2019s library, we were able to get in touch\nwith a place in Stutthof, a -- a museum that they erected on the camp, that Stutthof\ncamp and they sent us copy of a page of a ledger which shows her name and her date\nof death in Stutthof, in a camp. In December, 1944, the war was over in France and\nshe still died there. She was in her 50 -- must have been a very strong --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: -- in December, 1944, the war was over in France and she still died there. She was\nin her 50 -- must have been a very strong woman to last that long. For the longest\ntime we thought that she had been -- we knew that Stutthof camp had put all their\nstill alive internees on barges and drowned them at sea when the Russians advanced.\nAnd so we had always been tha -- under that impression that\u2019s what happened to her.\nBut the stutta -- the camp museum sent us a book, all in Polish, which somebody\ntranslated for us -- not translate, but read for us and then came to the conclusion that\nshe must have died of a typhoid breakout at that time, in December 23, where most\nof the people died. So, why am I telling you all of this? Oh, going to Europe -- when\nI deal with people my age, and that has been true -- they were my age 50 years ago --\nI mean, 30 year ago and I went to France. My -- my unspoken question is, where\nwere you during the war? Now, that\u2019s a question I don\u2019t ask here. And so that\u2019s --\nthat\u2019s something that exists a little bit less now, because I\u2019ve gone back to Europe\nmore often. And I had an interesting experience, we went back -- when we lived in\nFrance, between \u201883 and \u201886, I went back to the farm my parents had lived in during\nthe war and where I lived with them for not quite a year [indecipherable]. And found\nthe place and the people were very nice, let us come into the farm and we were there.\nBut, prior to that, I -- I have to backtrack, we stayed in a hotel. It\u2019s one of these\nchateaux that put up tourists. And in the very place where my father had been in a\ncamp, in Teeveeai blast, my father had been in a camp for a brief period. And all the\ntime I\u2019m there, I\u2019m saying to myself -- th-the owner of the -- the owner of the camp\nwas my age, I said, where was he when my father was in camp, in Teeveeai, right\nhere? Was he in the chateau, where was he -- doing? And I\u2019m uncomfortable. And\nthen the next morning we were on -- on -- on the way to -- on the farm, the next\nmorning, you know, what I just described to you, going back to the farm where my\nparents had lived, and so the owner there said to me -- no, the wife s -- the owner\u2019s\nwife said to me, \u201cWhere you off to today?\u201d You know, just chat. I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going\non a pilgrimage.\u201d And she says, \u201cOh, you\u2019re going to Oradure.\u201d Oradure siran is a\nvillage which is very famous in that terrible thing that happened in the end of the\nwar, when France -- the Germans took the whole population of Oradure, put them in\na church and put a match to it. And that\u2019s become a pilgrimage place. I said, \u201cNo,\nI\u2019m going to the place where my parents were hiding during the war.\u201d I said -- well,\nyou know, just kind of spill it out. And she said, \u201cOh. They were -- my husband was\nin the resistance and he was in camp so and so as a member of the resistance.\u201d Well,\neverything cleared, you know? No more -- but until I know where --",
        "A: -- where were you. It happened to me once in the States, when there was -- in a --\nin a group, the French speaking group in Cleveland, which I -- or in Syracuse, I\nforget where, which I joined for a very brief period, there was one woman who was\nfrom Germany and she talked about being in Strasbourg during the war -- where? In\nmy house? Where? I couldn\u2019t connect. I couldn\u2019t. It was a very brief kind of thing.\nSo I have this in Europe, which I don\u2019t have when I\u2019m here.",
        "A: And last year I had an incredible experience. We went -- usually we go on -- we\ndon\u2019t travel on our own, but we thought we could handle tha -- we go on tours or we\ngo in elder hostels or things like that, but I -- I wanted to see Prague and Budapest\nand we did it on our own. And with a lot of soul searching, we decided to include\nVienna, which ain\u2019t so easy for us. Well, we only spend a night or two there and after\nall, you know, the war is over, you can\u2019t hold it forever and you know, the whole\nreasoning. And so, in Prague, and in order to be understood, you speak German,\nbecause I don\u2019t do Czech and -- so we spoke German. And it\u2019s run over with German\ntourists and in the hotel you s -- you use German. And it didn\u2019t bother me and -- and\nyou know, this is a practical thing to do. Then we took a train to Vienna and we had\nthis very comfortable compartment, with -- and a woman from South Africa or\nAustralia. Anyway, it was a very pleasant first class compartment. We never travel\nfirst class, but our travel agent said, \u201cYou stay in a Eastern Euro-European country,\nyou better upgrade yourself. So we are there, we arrive at the border of Austria, the\ntrain stops and there is passport control. And this border guy -- I don\u2019t know what\nyou call it -- officer, comes in, very innocuous looking young man, with a khaki shirt\nand a khaki pants and some -- some -- something on him and in German asks us for\nour papers. And I broke down. I handed him -- I handed him my passport and I felt\nmy tears running down. This was a German, speaking German, asking me for my\npapers. Were they going to be fake? Was I going to be arrested? Was I going to make\nit? I surprised myself totally, my having tears running down my sh -- so it\u2019s still\nthere. In spite of all the talking, reading, doing, I ma -- I couldn\u2019t believe it. I -- I -- I\njust couldn\u2019t believe it. It wasn\u2019t just one thing, it -- the -- the Gestalt of the whole\nthing.",
        "A: So, being in Europe is, in this way, different from being in America. Not safer,\njust different. [inaudible]",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, oh, I -- I have to think about -- it -- it\u2019s something that -- that\u2019s there. I\nmean, it -- as I\u2019m getting older, there are fewer people of my age there, so they only\nchoo --",
        "A: You went to Poland?",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm.\na little bit older than me, in his late 40\u2019s, who runs the only Jewish magazine\npublished in Poland.",
        "A: Yeah, Jewish what?",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know, when we went to Germany, we -- this while we were in France, it was,\nwell, our 35th anniversary and we invited our kids to come on over, too. And -- our\nsons with their wives. They were -- was married, but had no children. I would like to\nduplicate it with the kids, but it\u2019s getting too big and I\u2019m getting too -- I can\u2019t handle\nthat many people at a time. But anyway, we went into Germany -- I mean first we\nwent Alsace, I showed them where my parents lived, where I went when I went to\nschool, where my grandparents lived. We showed them all of that. Also went to the\ncemetery and saw the monument to the Holocaust, all that kind of thing. And went\ninto Germany and Mart-Martin was very determined, we\u2019re just going to go. I don\u2019t\nwant to talk to anybody and we\u2019re going to go just to see the place and show the\nchildren where my house was, the cemetery, the school and synagogue and so on --\nwhich doesn\u2019t exist any more. And then we\u2019re going -- we\u2019re driving back, I had\n[indecipherable] the whole itinerary, I had all the reservations. We were going to just\nbreathe as little of the air as we could and speak a little German as we could and just\ndo it, because it -- 1t was an ex -- valid -- valid experience for our children, to see\nwhere their father grew up. And then -- w-we went two cars and our son flagged us\ndown and said, \u201cYou know, this has been a long drive, we -- I don\u2019t think we can\nmake it back to France today. We are very tired.\u201d And then he asked, \u201cDo you think\nDad would mind if we spend another night in Germany?\u201d They were so aware of\nthat. And we said, \u201cNo, what\u2019s -- that\u2019s okay, if we can get a room,\u201d -- we were in\nHeidelberg. And we got a hotel, we needed three rooms and we got three rooms and\nwe went there and the kids went of their own way. We just wanted each our own\nspace a little bit and they wanted to do their thing. And Martin and I walked around\nin Heidelberg. But the kids were conscious of the fact that another night in Germany\nwas maybe more that their father could countenance. And you know what, we said,\n\u201cGee, this is a beautiful city, darn it.\u201d And so we have transmitted our children this,\nthey are aware of it. But it doesn\u2019t stop them from -- I don\u2019t know, maybe buying\nsomething German or -- which ts -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m very aware of that, I cannot buy\nsomething German. But, it doesn\u2019t make sense. Israel buys stuff from Germany. In\nEurope you cannot separate things -- Germany or Belgium or anywhere else, it\u2019s the\nEuropean stuff, why can\u2019t you do it? But here, I could no more buy a bottle of\nGerman wine than I could fly to the moon. I mean, it\u2019s just, I can\u2019t do it. It -- It\u2019s --\nit\u2019s not from the head, 1t comes from below, you know? So -- so th-that\u2019s the\ndifference in -- when I\u2019m in Europe. It\u2019s not the safety, it\u2019s the awareness of the\nhistory, I think.",
        "A: Mm-hm. But you know, the streets in Israel -- have you been to Israel?",
        "A: There are plenty of German cars and Israel has -- has given Israel a lot of money. I\nmean, it\u2019s a very personal kind of thing.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I -- [remember very vividly, I couldn\u2019t vote then, but I do remember when I --\nwhen Eisenhower was elected, what was that, \u201850? \u201851? Something like that.\nAnyway, I\u2019m not very good at history. And here we\u2019re getting a Republican after all\nthese Democratic thing. I thought that everything was going to change. And\nMcCarthy was interviewing, I mean the -- the anti-American kind of hearings were\ngoing on. That scared me. I thought that with a new president who was going to be a\nRepublican, versus all -- we had FDR, Truman, all that before. And then I found out\nlife went on and nothing changed very much. But I was scared at the time. As for the\nbomb, I was very involved at the time, the atomic bomb. I was very involved in the\nban the bomb kind of thing, because -- I remember marching in the -- in the marches\nwith my son in the -- in the -- a stroller. And Dr. Spock was in Cleveland and Dr.\nSpock -- actually, I consulted with him once, in my professional work and he used\nthe same car repair dealer as we did and so my sons knew that this was the doctor\nwho had written the book that I looked at when he was sick, so he -- he knew who\nDr. Spock was. But, anyway, he was -- was, this woman called Sane, it was a --\nbecame active in that. I\u2019m not a very -- and my husband isn\u2019t either, we are not the\ndemonstration kind of people, marching kind of thing. But that I mi -- I mean, we\ndon -- we tend to support causes by giving money or even by writing letters and now\nby e-mail. My husband does more of that than I do. But we are not the -- the\ndemonstration kind of thing. Is that the English word or 1s it manifesti -- in French\nit\u2019s manifestation. Yeah, it\u2019s demonstration.",
        "A: And so -- but that -- that -- I -- I du -- at the time of the bomb, since I was also\ninvolved with young children and I had all this fall-out kind of thing, so I -- I did -- I\ndid march.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah.",
        "A: See, this has -- has nothing to do so much with the Holoc -- people in the\nHolocaust, the-they were sent to camps. I -- what I\u2019m talking about is we were\nexpelled -- this is the other piece in the experien -- we lived in the border of France\nand then almost at the border of Belgium, Holland. You know, Belgium and France.\nMy parents had left Strasbourg and the whole popul -- if you remember my early\npaper -- my early recording, Strasbourg had been evacuated.",
        "A: And then -- and my parents didn\u2019t go with the mobs down in the south side of\nFrance. They found their own place, probably a hundred miles west of Strasbourg --\nin -- in Lorraine, in a place called Glammer. And so when the war came -- when the -\n- not when the war came, when the invasion came, we were in the war, but nothing\nwas going, it was the phony war and in the phony war, nothing was going on and we\nwere waiting for something to happen. And what happened is that the Germans went\naround the maginno line and they invaded Belgium and Holland and poured into\nFrance. And we had to leave. People were taking to the roads. I don\u2019t know if I sa --\nrecorded this, but we -- it was a Shabbat morning, my mother had cooked all the\nmeals for Shabbat. They had never been in a car on a Shabbat and we had a car. And\nwhatever we could, we loaded on top of the car. Couple of mattresses, whatever food\nwe had which was already prepared. And we left in the great [indecipherable] just\nlike the people you see on the roads.",
        "A: Except that we had a car. So that\u2019s a piece of my personal experience in France,\nwhich may not be at all related to experience of people who went into concentration\ncamp. That\u2019s different.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, is it good for the Jews?",
        "A: Mm-hm. Yeah, I guess there are two, I don\u2019t know. Do you want to ask me where\nI fit in between?",
        "A: I think actu -- I think I\u2019m more open to suffering in general, I think. Yeah, I really\nthink so, when I think of all the causes we support. But I think the main -- but also,\nwe also do a great deal to support our own. Probably -- probably our main -- I think\nof our charities, for instance.",
        "A: It starts with home, it starts with our own community, where we see our needs.\nBecause what we haven\u2019t touched upon, and it probably doesn\u2019t fit in your questions,\nbut I\u2019m going to touch upon it now. Retirement started in Chapel Hill, here. And we\nliterally touched the ground running and became active immediately in community\nwork. And when I mean community, I mean the Jewish community. This is a very\nsmall Jewish community of no business -- no Jewish businesses, it\u2019s all academic or\nresearch or it\u2019s university or the research, Triangle Park and there\u2019s literally no\nJewish businesses here. So when we came, there was a volunt -- a group of\nvolunteers raising funds for the UJ and a bunch of volunteers having a program for\nsome elderly people. That\u2019s all -- well, there was a Hillel on the campus and that kind\nof thing, was a Haddassah. But there\u2019s no organized communit -- there were two\nsynagogue. And I\u2019ve been part, from the beginning, of a creation of a Jewish family\nserver. So, what I\u2019m saying is my -- this was my -- although at first I didn\u2019t know\nwhere to put my volunteer energies, it became -- I\u2019m what -- 60 -- 66 years old and of\ncourse I can take classes and I can do -- which we did, right away from the\nbeginning. But I wanted to -- I wanted to be active and I wa -- vare -- I didn\u2019t know\nwhere to start. I went to Red Cross and I went -- and I went to the research\n[indecipherable] to the -- because I speak a few languages, maybe I could help them.\nBut none of this was satisfactory. And then by chance I had met somebody who said,\n\u201cOh, there is a group that\u2019s trying to hire a social worker to get started with the\nelderly, because it can no longer be done on a voluntary basis and one thing leading\nto the other, before I knew it, a few years late -- a few years later I was chairman of\nthe Jewish Family Service and I\u2019m still active on this committee. I was charge of the\nRussian resettlement program here and I\u2019m still in charge of that. We don\u2019t resettle\nanybody any more, but I\u2019m still active in that. And I am still immersed 100% in this.\nSo, yeah, if you wish charit -- my empathy -- I was much -- it was much more\nsatisfactory to -- first of all, it\u2019s my professional background that -- my skills came in\nhandy 1n there -- than to go to Red Cross and when people donate blood to, you\nknow, give them a cookie or something like that. I couldn\u2019t relate to that. And I was\ndoing Meals on Wheels. I continued Meals on Wheels, which is not a Jewish\nprogram, for the longest time. But then it -- the schedule interfered with something\nelse and I dropped -- but for five years I was delivering meals to the general\ncommunity here. So I don\u2019t limit it to the Jewish community.",
        "A: But then, as the community activities became more important -- and they have\nbeen, it\u2019s been absolutely wonderful, because I work not only -- I work with younger\npeople, instead of being with my peers all the time and my experience is given some\nvalidation and my community\u2019s help. And so both my husband and I -- he spent the\nwhole day today at Hillel, because of some kind -- but thank God it\u2019s only 12\nminutes from here, so he can go running back and forth. And that morning, the first\nthing I talked with the social worker and at Jewish Family Service -- number one I\nhired her, so I know her very well. Number two, she asked me to do a -- to take care\nof some difficult situation on a voluntary basis and I report [indecipherable]. And so\nwe\u2019re constantly involved with this kind of thing.",
        "A: And this is so -- yeah, I\u2019m -- I mean I empathize with problems mi -- in -- in -- in\nthe -- the -- outside the Jewish community, but I think my emphasis is inside the\nJewish community. So, does that answer your question?",
        "A: Oh yes, definitely.",
        "A: A-And this is what I -- I think one of the messages that I give the kids when I talk\nto -- especially the younger children -- I talk to them mostly about not speaking up\nwhen there is injustice or preyudice. You know, for evil to -- for evil to flourish, it\njust -- Just take one good man not to talk or sa -- I\u2019m misquoting it, but you know\nwhat I\u2019m talking about, not speaking up and -- now, of course they cannot write to\ntheir senators, but they can be aware of injustice, even in their school situations. And\nthey can be aware of prejudice and that kind of thing and then that\u2019s what I talk to\nthem about and then that\u2019s not a Jewish notion, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a general, universal no -- so\nI -- and when people say it can happen here, I really don\u2019t believe it, but\ntheoretically, it could happen anywhere. And so this is the message I -- I gave the\nchildren. But I\u2019m not sitting at home worrying about war.",
        "A: I\u2019m -- I think it\u2019s dreadful, what\u2019s happening in the world nowadays. Again, it\nstarted all over again today in -- in Rwanda and in -- in Bosnia it continues, it\u2019s so\nwrong. And one feels totally helpless and then the univer -- and the world\ncommunity is totally helpless.\nexecuted and the way it was done and there\u2019s the -- the whole -- I -- the only thing\nthat I can think is hi -- 1-is -- and a -- and it was one of the questions I asked you\nearlier, which was h-how did -- how did it escalate in -- in people\u2019s minds -- y-you\nknow, from the victim\u2019s minds, how it escalated?",
        "A: Yeah. I -- I -- I don\u2019t know. It -- I -- I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I -- I really don\u2019t know how. I think that there are s -- maybe people have this --\nthere is this -- all these hidden revenges and hidden thoughts and hidden blaming and\n-- that are -- are given -- given ventilation, I mean are able to -- they\u2019re able to\nventilate, they come out.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. One of the messages -- something you said remind me of another\nmessage that I always give the children. They always say, you know, it\u2019s a bat -- or 1s\na genocide here, you know, there is a Holocaust there and it\u2019s true, there are -- there\nare genocides and -- going on and there are mass murders going on all over the world\nthese day, whether it\u2019s Bosnia or Rwanda or ethnic cleansing anywhere. But never --\nI tell them, remember, never has there been a plan made to systematically destroy a\nwhole people. It was done in Germany. I don\u2019t have to tell them about the Wannsee\nConference or whatever they -- their -- their history isn\u2019t that --",
        "A: -- they don\u2019t know that -- that [indecipherable]. But it happens elsewhere that\nwhole ethnic groups are being destroyed and being eliminated. But it happens in sort\nof a spontaneous and on a different kind of internal war kind of thing. But this was an\nindustrial plan of elimination, with industrial weapons to do it. And in -- I -- I\u2019ve\nseen a reenactment of the Wannsee conference on television. It is absolutely\nunbearable. And so they -- I want to give that message, that this -- in this way, the\nHolocaust 1s different. And I don\u2019t usually use the word Holocaust, I use the word\nShoah. Which they do in France, by the way, they always talk about the Shoah, never\nabout the Holocaust. Because it\u2019s -- makes a difference. It makes -- it makes it\nspecial.",
        "A: Shoah?",
        "A: The different 1s that this -- the Shoah 1s this -- this specific plan that was made to -\n- to destroy a people.",

        "A: [indecipherable] you know.",
        "A: Did I talk about having met her in Paris?",
        "A: Oh, that is another fantastic story. And that -- you know, ilch -- my friend\nCharlotte, who was arrested when I was freed, I never been in touch with her. I didn\u2019t\nhave -- I once asked for her address, when a -- a mutual friend and I wrote to her and\nI never heard from her. So I said -- part of me said she\u2019s mad at me because I was\nliber -- freed and she was arrested. But I let -- dropped the thing, I mean it didn\u2019t -- it\n-- it just disappeared from my memory. And then we went and had that reunion. I\nsaid, \u201cCan anybody tell me if Charlotte is here? How would I recognize her?\u201d And\nwe met. And the f -- we hugged and the first thing she said, \u201cNow we can have that\npiece of pastry together. We never had it, because we were arrested together.\u201d I said,\n\u201cWhat do you mean? We first had the pastry and it\u2019s when we walked out of the\npastry shop that we were arrested.\u201d And here we were arguing about that. Secondly\nshe said, \u201cYou know, I felt very guilty. We had no business being seen together.\u201d\nBecause she looked very Jewish and she said, \u201cWe had no --\u201d she was not on our\nunderground network, she was doing some other kind of work. She said, \u201cWe had no\nbusiness being seen together. It -- I was compromising you.\u201d And I compromised\nmyself by being with her. And this is how our reunion took place, arguing over\npastry. But then she told me how she got liberated. She was put into jail and knew\nthat in the infirmary of that jail, there was a nurse who worked with the resistance. So\nher goal was to get into that ner -- infirmary. So she pretended to have a toothache,\nvery bad toothache and she had two teeth pulled, two perfectly good teeth pulled and\n-- you know, because she complained about it and all the treatment they had was to\npull the teeth. And the nurse helped her escape. That\u2019s how it happened. So it took\nme almost 50 years to find out -- exactly 50 years to find out.",
        "A: Oh, th -- she was -- she was part of a -- working with Ose and different kind of\nthing. When the war was over she worked as a social worker with one of the Jewish\nagencies in Paris. And so we aged paralleling. And -- but that was the reunion, so that\nwas the first time, took us 50 years to reconnect.",
        "A: And I tell that story to the kids and they -- they love that story. Makes it real, you\nknow?",
        "A: No. Mm-mm, mm-mm. No. We -- we chatted, but --",
        "A: It\u2019s too many people -- too many thing and then our lives have taken so many\ndifferent courses, I mean it\u2019s just im-impossible to do that.",
        "A: \u2019'm not a very good corresponder. Pick up the phone easier, but -- so I had never\nseen her before, no.",
        "A: I guess we haven\u2019t gone according to any plan. We have just -- it has just\nemerged, right?",
        "A: Had to get me back on track.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Be -- things are interconnected, it\u2019s very difficult to put it in categories.",
        "A: And other things came into my mind as I was talking to you, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah. Oh, this is interesting, what you underlined was when I did my -- when I\ndid my interview in France with Ose, my oral history, in French and I -- the director\nof Ose, who was the woman I had worked with in camp, colleague of mine, she\nimmedi -- wrote to me and said, \u201cI read your -- I read your interview and you say\nexactly the same thing that I have always felt.\u201d She became a professional social\nworker, I developed more professionally. And all we had to do -- all -- all we could\ndo is produce the cards, look at the suitcases, empty the profe -- th -- th -- the\npersonal things to make a child safe, in order to survive. And we had no time to\nprepare them, to ask them how they feel. The kind of things I would do as a\nprofessional therapist, to avoid the trauma of going into a new situation without\nhaving say good-bye to their parents, without knowing where their parents were.\nWith leaving behind everything? I mean, these are traumatic situations which, under\nnormal circumstance, I would take weeks to prepare a child for. I didn\u2019t have 24\nhours. And I couldn\u2019t let these thoughts even -- if -- even if they had existed and I\nwas not professional enough to have these thou -- even if they had existed, I couldn\u2019t\nhave had -- let them intrude upon me in my mind. I had to tell a child, \u201cYou are no\nlonger so and so, you are so and so. Remember now, give me your name.\u201d No, I had\nto -- \u201cI have to take your suitcase away, because it has your name on it.\u201d I didn\u2019t say,\n\u201cHow do you feel about my taking your suit --\u201d I mean, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking\nabout.",
        "A: The -- the profe -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t know enough about -- about how to\ndeal with trauma, otherwise I would have been hampered in -- in my moving fast and\nso we saved kids life. And on the whole, I think that in many ways, when I read --\nthere have been some studies made on the children, the hidden children. More and\nmore there has been. It\u2019s interesting. The -- the first people to speak after the\nHolocaust were the survivors. It took them a long time to talk and they began to talk\nabout their experiences. And then the children of survivors talked of their -- what\nthey had in common. And it -- and other groups at different times. Now, for instance,\nthere were also the children of deportees, that\u2019s more in Europe, that\u2019s not here,\nbecause we don\u2019t have that many children here, of people who were deported. And\nthen, only very recently, the -- the children who were hidden, sort of felt -- there\u2019s a\nwhole group of them, they have something in common. And they didn\u2019t speak and I\nask -- I know -- there\u2019s one here -- I mean, there are several here in Chapel Hill, but\nthere is one I know fairly well. And she only recently came out of the closet and she\nsay, \u201cI\u2019m talking about it.\u201d And she said, \u201cQuite often this was painful.\u201d Of course,\nshe lost her parents while she was in hiding and then she stayed with some relatives\nand well -- came to this country, whatever, I don\u2019t know all the details. But she says\nalso, \u201cSince we survived, we didn\u2019t feel that we had a voice in all of this. I mean, we\nwere not victims, we survived.\u201d And now, all of a sudden, they feel they have\nsomething to talk about, because they indeed were victims and they have a lot in\ncommon. And so now there are the hidden children coming out of the woodwork.\nThey have -- they had a big meeting of the hi -- children hidden by Ose in Miami two\nyears ago. I didn\u2019t go to that one. And there is a newsletter and I\u2019m on the mailing\nlist and I -- there 1s one -- a huge one in Israel. And these kids find they have\nsomething in common, because they were hidden and they had their losses and so\nforth and so on. And -- why am I telling you that, I lost my train of thought. Where\nwe are at?",
        "A: Yeah, and that -- but -- a-and the studies, yeah, what I wanted to say is that there\nwere studies made of how these children have adjusted. There\u2019s one I have from\nFrance and you know, they don\u2019t do any worse or better than the general population.\nThey have their share of successes and of divorces and of failed businesses and -- and\nof successes. They -- they really don\u2019t differ statistically from the general population,\nnot that the general population is doing that well in -- you know, I mean it\u2019s ver --\nthey doing very normally. And then -- and one -- as one of the surviving -- one of the\nhidden children in Paris told me, \u201cHey, we didn\u2019t do so badly, you know, considering\nwhat we gone through. Why do you think this is so?\u201d And I gave her my\ninterpretation and I said that considering that what is very important is just after the\nvery early years of a child\u2019s life, let\u2019s say the first -- some say it\u2019s the first two, some\nsay it\u2019s the first two, whatever it 1s. Most of these children came from intact,\nnurturing families. And what happened to them, happened to the whole family and\nnot within the family. So that they survived more psychologically intact, actually. If\nyou understand what I mean? To -- children are -- there are many children today who\nare dysfunctional because of the pathology within the family. Because of parents who\ndon\u2019t get along or -- or whatever it is, or parents who divorce or -- or all kinds of\nthings that happen inside the family. What happened to these kids -- and -- and so\nthey lose their nurturing, their loo -- they lose all the si -- sense of stability, they lose\na sense of -- of security and what have you. But what happened to these hidden kids\nis that they had good, solid years, early childhood, of nurturing and of -- of -- of -- of\n-- as -- a Stable family situation and they don\u2019t perceive their parents as the\nperpetrators of terrible things. It is -- it happened to the entire family. And, if\nanything, they become concerned about their parents -- about the fate of their parent.\nI ha -- when we\u2019re finished with this, I want to show you a absolutely devastating\nbook. I have a book, I think it\u2019s two telephone books of -- that are the children that\nwere deported from France. The -- this put together by Serge Clarksfeld and his wife.\nDoes the name mean anything? Serge Clarksfeld is a lawyer whose parents were\ndeported and he devoted his life t -- he is the one who bought Barbie to France, he\nand his wife brought Barbie. His wife is German and not Jewish and they have\ndevoted their life to hunt the perpetrators and war criminals. In the first book he\nwrote, it was a -- a -- Barbie is -- is very famous for rounding up a whole children\u2019s\nhome called Eezure. It was not directly an Ose home, but related to Ose and we had\nworkers in there. And here wa -- this was in spring of 1944, April 1944, it was almost\nover and he rounded up the staff and the children and except for one boy, who\nhappened to visit there and was left off the truck because he was not Jewish,\neverybody was sent to Auschwitz. Nobody survived, none of the kids, except one of\nthem -- one of the counselor -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not sure. But there is a mother of the\nchildren -- two mothers of the children with the Clarksfelds became active, first of all\nin founding rap -- Barbie and bringing him to trial and he was brought to trial while\nwe were living in France. And we were in front of the prison with each one of us\ncarrying a name of a child, big, big, big panels. And what his job was -- became --\nwas to investigate the identity of each of these children and get as much data on them\nand pictures of them, so we don\u2019t say 41 children, you say, Bobby and Suzy and\nEddie and -- and give them all a name and an identity and he published this book,\n\u201cThe Children of Eezure\u201d. And then he became to study the deportation list from\nFrance and cull out the children and try to find an identi -- when he published, all\nover the world. And he\u2019s put together the first of what he thinks is a series of books\nwhere he has pictures and stories about each one, and there were 10,000 children\ndeported from France. So he -- 1t was published in France and there was an exhibit in\nthe new school in New York and it was published by, I think the New York Press and\nit was available and so I got it. And they are not numbers, they\u2019re kids. And there\nyou can see from what loving, nurturing backgrounds they came. And now I think\nthis 1s what I\u2019m tr -- I\u2019m trying to talk about, what these kids went through, I just\ncouldn\u2019t address it, I just couldn\u2019t prepare them. I had to move very quickly. Does\nthat answer your question?\nphotographs and little biographies, so that you see that these are people, that you --\nand you can sit there -- you could sit there the whole day and read about it.",
        "A: You go to Yad Vashem and you go into the children\u2019s [indecipherable].",
        "A: It\u2019s only names.",
        "A: Just names. And it goes on and on, it recite the names -- the names, you hear them\non -- we went into Prague, into one of the synagogues. There\u2019s nothing on the walls\nbut names, tiny little names. That\u2019s the one where Madeline Albright went to. I\ncouldn\u2019t go in.",
        "A: I just couldn\u2019t. I had to stay out. I walked in and out, it was just too much.",
        "A: Oh.\npeople could -- you know. And then, being a father and having two little children,\nyou just can\u2019t comprehend it.",
        "A: Nope.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, they -- they are far away and at the same time you get so angry about\nbeing so helpless and that the world community is so helpless, with all the bodies we\nhave created, like NATO, like United Nation and all that. And yet, we still are\nhelpless. It\u2019s a little scary.",
        "A: No, I -- that\u2019s not when we left Strasbourg, that\u2019s when we left Blamont, the place\nwhere my parents had already taken up resi -- we had, oh, they lived [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, the second time.",
        "A: The first time we left -- I mean, we were forced to leave but, it -- 1t wasn\u2019t because\nit was an inva -- it was still peace, there was no war yet. It was two days before the\nwar, two days. But in --",
        "A: Well, I -- I ha -- I had just learned to drive, I mean, in those days, we had one car,\nobviously, it was my father\u2019s car for business. I never got a ride to school or anything\nlike that. We walked to everything or take the streetcar. So I never learned to ride it --\nmy -- and my brother used the car for -- help my father, he knew how to drive. So,\nmy brother would take our car, but the neighbors, as I said in my story, the neighbors\nhad a car. And the male in the family were in the army. There was nobody -- but\nthere was a car. You know, there was -- there was transportation, they get out from\nunder the German. There was nobody to drive it. So, I drove the neighbor\u2019s car. And\nthere was a handicapped girl and a grandmother in there. And it was totally in\ncharacter for me to do that, because I was a girl scout leader. In fact, I drove the car\nin my girl scout uniform, which in those days, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s today, was a\nkhaki uniform, with a khaki hat with all kinds of insignias and badges all over me.\nAnd that gave me an official status, because -- I mean, sometimes I -- sometimes\nmyself, I wa -- I wonder about it, but it was in character for me to do that. And I\nremember as we were on the road, there were -- there was my brother, there was me\nand there was two other -- two other Jewish families from bila -- from that town. We\nall traveled as a convoy, with people on the road and cars and the defeated army --\nFrench army and soldiers and va -- wagons and -- and at one intersection I was going\nto be separated from my brother. I didn\u2019t know where he was going. I don\u2019t know\nwhere we were going, we were going. We were leaving the Germans behind us. And\nI stopped the car and I got out on the road, with my khaki official uniform and I\nstopped all traffic and I went through. You know, was it out of -- I -- I -- I -- I was\npretty determined girl or -- alway -- you know, I had already left, actually. When my\nparents were in Bremel, I went to take a job in Paris as a -- as a early childhood -- in -\n- in early childhood. I was just 20 and when I got to the school there, outside of Paris,\nthe concierge who opened the door for me, asked me what grade I was in. You know,\nI was very young. But I took a job in Paris and my mother took very sick and I went\nhome and that\u2019s why I was home when the invasion started and it was a good thing I\nwas home, because we were all together leaving. But I was teaching in Paris with the\nbombing trails and we -- we had -- we -- we -- we were in the shelters and all that\nkind of stuff. No, it was not out of character for me to do that. I -- I wish I had known\nhow to drive better, but I got there. I got there -- I remember once we were going\nover some mountain -- there were mountains on the way and my car heating up and I\ndidn\u2019t know what to do. And the soldiers pushed me up the hill, you know, because\nthey were walking alongside. We didn\u2019t move farther than -- we didn\u2019t move very f -\n- very fast. And we kept on driving and every night by -- we had my grandmother\nwith me, we -- we found some shelter. We had all the Shabbas food hanging on the\ncar. We had it hanging over the car with -- and we found a bed for my grandmother,\nwe -- and then we slept wherever we could, and we were going and we left\neverything behind us. And we ended up somewhere where we stopped. And this is\nwhere -- this is where my experience is very special, because -- in a sense that the\npeople who were deported, I think didn\u2019t have that expulsion and that fleeing kind of\nexperience. And that\u2019s the one that early on, kind of gave me that empathy feeling for\n[inaudible |",
        "A: No, it was -- it was something that -- that I assumed, right, because I -- I was a -- I\n-- that was -- I was the leader of the girl scouts, I was a -- I was -- I did these things\nand I did some -- but let me such -- say one thing is that when we women, all\nprofessionals, all retired, all having worked in similar kinds of situati -- or even\ntogether during the war, at -- particularly in Rivesaltes -- when we talked about what\nwe had done, we old ladies really became scared. Our daring and our -- the things we\ndid. There\u2019s one word -- French word for it, we all used the same word and I\u2019ve been\ntrying to render it in English and I don\u2019t know exactly what it was -- [indecipherable]\nacrousion, you say bit, you were totally unconscious to do some things like that. But\nit doesn\u2019t render. It gets -- you out of your mind to do things like that. We were all on\nthe same wavelength and saying, \u201cMy God, did we take risk.\u201d And that risk taking\nscared us at this stage of our lives.",
        "A: I don\u2019t understand it today, either, but --",
        "A: Well, I was trying to thwart any attempt on his part to have me ar -- to -- to arrest -\n- to arrest me. He knew I -- who I was.",
        "A: He knew I was Jewish.",
        "A: And obviously I had false papers. I mean, he could have asked any of his\npoliceman in the city to stop me and ask for my paper. That happened all the time.\nAnd he knew I had false paper. And so -- in some very daring gesture, I guess -- I\ndon\u2019t understand it myself, today, sounds completely crazy, but I -- you see, it was\nthe end of the war already. It was spring of \u00b044 and I guess that was part of it too, the\nGermans were losing grounds and the collaborators were losing grounds and maybe\nthat was part of it, that he would realize that, you know, himself.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. But I said, rath --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "A: -- ready. It was spring of \u201c44 and I guess that was part of it too, the Germans were\nlosing grounds and the collaborators were losing grounds and maybe that was part of\nit, that he would realize that, you know, himself.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. But I said, rather than expose myself to the possibility of being\narrested and my papers checked -- he could have done it himself in the restaurant. I\nsaid, I play on both his knowle -- he -- he knew my father. He was the commandant\nof the camp. Before he was the commandant of the camp, he was the -- the -- the\nchief police officer in Strasbourg. So, he knew my family. I didn\u2019t know him then,\nthat was -- my father had some business with him. So I thought I playing -- a part of\nit was playing on that connection, to leave me alone. And it worked, what can I say?\nIt was -- it -- in retrospect, probably was unnecessary risk taking. On the other hand,\nit worked, so -- it -- it -- in -- in -- it -- he -- 1t sounds crazy, totally crazy when I think\nof it.",
        "A: Well, it worked.",
        "A: And my hunches were right, so that\u2019s okay.",
        "A: If you feel we have covered everything, I\u2019m more than ready to stop. In fa --",
        "A: Oh no, here -- about the movement I made\u2019? What do you mean?",
        "A: No, see my parents -- I -- I worked in Rivesaltes, my parents were right here,\nsomewhere right here.",
        "A: In the -- very close to the demarcation line, right here in the peri -- no, here,\nPerigure. This is not right, this map is wrong. Perigure was not in -- this is all wrong.\nPerigure is on this side of the line, not on this side of the line, this 1s the demarcation\nline. This is much too far in. Perigure is -- is the area where my parents lived and it\nwas not in the -- in the occupied zone, it was on the unoccupied zone. So this is\nwrong, here. The -- Perigure should be right here.",
        "A: But Limoge is not a camp.",
        "A: Limoge Is a city.",
        "A: And -- and Chatarro is just a city in which I took residence, because that\u2019s where\nwe hid kids.",
        "A: See, between -- first of all, this camp in Rivesaltes was the -- Rivesaltes was close.\nAnd from Rivesaltes, I tried to go to Gerse, which was even a worse camp. And they\ndidn\u2019t let me in any more. But they were -- some people were in -- 1n the -- in a s-\nsupervised residency outside of Gerse, and I stayed there for a very, very short while,\nbecause I was really sick. I had jaundice, I was yellow all over. So I went back to my\nparents farm, and I -- took me a couple of months to recover. I didn\u2019t have any\nmedication, I was just wait until it was over. But the farm was here, near Perigure\nand Perigure is not here, Perigure 1s down here. Better check it on your maps. So\nPerigure is somewhere down here. So I stayed the farm. Then, the camp had closed,\nbecause all the people had been deported, so -- and they didn\u2019t let me come into\nGerse and so I went to work in the children\u2019s home outside of Limoge. Limoge is not\na camp.",
        "A: You have the camps mar-marked in triangles, so Limoge has a circle, that\u2019s a city.",
        "A: And so, outside of Limoge was a children\u2019s home called Poulousant and there was\na chief counselor until the end of four -- we are in \u201842 now, until the -- and I worked\nthere f -- until \u201843 -- for almost a year. And when the children\u2019s homes were closed,\nand I was recruited in this underground network and I asked to be stationed in\nChatarro, which is a city.",
        "A: It\u2019s just --",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah, you have all the papers at the Holocaust Museum. I have\nthem all here, but I have copies of them here. So, I didn\u2019t make myself change\nanything, just is -- you know, we traveled the -- in these days. There were trains, but\nyou never know whether you could get on one.",
        "A: It was so mobbed. There was horrible scene, but -- and so this is where I took\nresidence. And the headquarters really, of this whole area here, was in Limoge. Are\nwe still on tape?",
        "A: Just to tell you how little I was aware of the distance and the dangers, when I --\nwhen -- [break]",
        "A: The -- the leader of our -- or the organizer of our underground network at Ose,\nGeorge Garell, in 1947 published a book on the -- the work of Ose under the German\noccupation of France, from 1940-44. And there wa -- it is part of a book on the\nactivity of the Jewish organization in France during the occupation. And in giving me\nthe book, he wrote down, \u201cTo Simone Weil, un souvenir des anee difficile e exaltant\nvicky ensemble. Lette per vrai que da fuess de leve les mountine. Vous l\u2019avez\nprouve.

        "A: No, he was the leader of the underground network.",
        "A: He was an engineer by training and he was so moved by an experience he had in\nLyon, when he was part o -- that he was with a group of adults and children, had\nbeen arrested and although he was a ver -- Jewishly very fringe and very secular, he\nfelt a need to work with -- to help the Jewish people in France. And he -- he was a\nvery personable guy and he was -- he had the lists of the children and the -- knew the\nmovements of the children, he knew was going on and he -- he traveled around the\ncountry, touching base with all of us workers, pretending to travel, I believe -- I -- I\ndon't have a confirmation -- as a wine salesman and everything being coded and\nhaving all his material, on the work of the network in such a way that -- pretending to\nbe a wine salesman made it possible for him. He brought us the money that we\nneeded, he gave us the news. He made the necessary contacts so that we could\nfunction. He died quite a number of years ago.",
        "A: It\u2019s a big question. On the one hand, I cannot get over of the inhumanity of man\nagainst man. I mean, you see it daily on television. The -- the -- the -- the sheer -- the\nbrutality, the -- the senseless brutality with which people can act towards each other.\nAnd yet, on the other hand, the redeeming peace 1s those who help. Last night on the\nradio there was an interview with the woman who has sheltered Anne Frank, there is\nan anniversary, there was something on public radio.",
        "A: But -- but an interview with her and you know, there 1s all these people who --\nwho have the condition of man at heart and who work to improve the world,\nwherever it is, when -- whatever it is, so I don\u2019t know it\u2019s balance, but really the\ninhumanity is just -- it\u2019s rampant, it\u2019s everywhere, it\u2019s in our local police, it\u2019s in the\narmy, it\u2019s everywhere. And it\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- it\u2019s devastating and I -- I don\u2019t know what\n-- but it\u2019s -- and you know -- but brutality and enjoying violence has been around for\na long time. Go back to the Roman times, when they watched the slaves being\nthrown to the beasts in the circuses, that was -- that was part of it, so -- I mean, the\nbrutalit -- they were -- how people can -- to-today -- you hear in the news this\nmorning that the Tutus go with machetes to cut up their neighbor. Is there any -- any\n-- that\u2019s human beings. That -- that\u2019s -- it\u2019s devastating. And then you lee -- read of\nacts of heroism here and there and I don\u2019t know if it balances, but I -- I think it does\nto a certain degree. Veri -- sometimes [indecipherable].
