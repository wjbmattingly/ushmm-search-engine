        "INTERVIEW WITH IRVING BALSAM",
        "MARCH 15, 1992",
        "BRONX, NEW YORK\nWould you just start again with what's your name and date of birth?\nMy name is Irving Balsam. I am 67 years old and presently reside in the Bronx. I was born 1n Poland.\nThe name of the town was Praszka. A small little town on the border of Germany and Poland.\nWhat was your birth date?\nMy birth date is 1924, October 17, 1924. I experienced all the strain and the horror inflicted on the\nJews by the Germans. Since the day they invaded my hometown the first day of September, 1939.\nMy survival, and I'm speaking to you today as a survivor, is simply a miracle. It came about because\nof the unusual coincidences beyond the grasp of human understanding. I cannot understand myself\nhow this happened, how I survived, or was I chosen to survive by destiny in order to be able to tell\nthe story? The story to the world that such things should never happen again to the Jewish people or\nto any people. My entire family, father, mother, my two older brothers their name was Moishe and\nRazar (18) and my younger sister, Judy, all were annihilated by the Germans. At the outbreak of the\nsecond World War, September 1, 1939, I was a boy not quite 15 years old. The severe persecution,\nthe brutality and suffering inflicted on the Jews of our town by the Germans did not fail to reach all\nthe inhabitants of Praszka, my home. My family, of course, was not exempted. I as a teenager\nsuddenly encountered a completely new and aryan world, a world full of grief, cruelty and\nannihilation; a world bent on the destruction of our people. Why do I say the destruction of our\npeople, the whole world. I just found out, after the liberation, that the whole world stood idly by and\nwatched the annihilation of the Jewish people, men, women and child, concentration camps, gas\nchambers, wagons with gas and no one lifted a finger or a warning, even, to the Germans, to stop the\nkilling. So in 1940, I believe it was, my entire family along with the rest of the town Jewry were\ncorralled into a ghetto. In 1941, I believe it was in the summer, I, together with many other young\nJews were taken out of the ghetto and deported to the slave labor camp near Poznan. The name of\nthe camp was Buchvardelfost (ph)(c.56). In the interim, my entire family along with the rest of the\nPraszka Jewish ghetto were driven to their execution. All of them perished at the hand of the German\ntormentors in the death camps of Hamunull (ph)(53). After working in B , preparing the\nReichousband (c.55), we called at that time, it mean the super-highway for the Germans, working\nthere almost two years. Then I was transferred to different labor-torture camps in Germany. Finally\nit was now 1943, I was brought to the frightening extermination camp of Auschwitz. There I was\nrobbed of my name, my existence as a Jew and a human being ceased. I became number 141938\nwhich was brutally burned into my arm and is still visible today. I became one of the damned and\nstampeded Jews whose only path led to the crematorium and gas chamber. I can still see and feel the\nmany chimneys of the camp belching forth the heavy dark smoke. A stink so old and permeating that",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "it pursues me to this very day and is still too agonizing to recall. After a few months in confinement,\nin Auschwitz with the threat of death hanging over my head every day, whether it was by the cruel\nbeatings, hard labor, I was suddenly transferred to another slave-labor in the concentration camp of\nLagisza.\nWhere is that?\nLagisza was six kilometers before Benjun (c.82) where we built for the Germans, electricity station.\nAs was the case with most of the Jews and under this circumstances, we experienced unbearable pain\nbecause of hunger, suffering, and degredation and hard work. Just to describe to you one day of food\nin acamp where we worked from six in the morning to six in the evening. When you received going\nout to work in the morning, a black coffee, so-called coffee and with this you had to go out to work.\nIn the afternoon, during lunch, we supposed to have gotten a soup and it was many days where it did\nnot reach us. Whether it was spilled during the way by other prisoners carrying it or 1t was available.\nWe came home from work, we received one piece of bread. I would say in the size of the--today two\nslices of bread and again a soup. It was the hardest decision of my life, what to eat first.\nWhy is that?\nIt was, if you will eat up the soup with the bread, you have nothing in the morning--for the morning\nwhen you go out to work left over. So most of us, most of the concentration camp inmates, were\ntrying to ration ourselves. We ate the little soup at night and we tried, we tried to hold on to this piece\nof bread until the morning to have it with the coffee. But hunger, the hunger was stronger than the\nresistance not to eat. So you started to nibble a piece now, put it in your pocket, didn't last, the hunger\nwas so great. I think this 1s the greatest pain that a human can have, this hunger pain. So you take\nanother out another piece and you nibble again until you nibble and you nibble till you have nothing\nleft no more.\nWere you ever able to --?\nAnd at night, you feel guilty again that you ate it cause you're not going to have it in the morning.\nWere you ever able to preserve it until the morning, yourself?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Very seldom, very seldom. It was only through certain circumstances when I got a little extra that I\ncould preserve a piece for the morning. This is another story by itself. When, under what\ncircumstances, sometimes a person got a little extra food, something to eat. This was, I think, looking\nback in retrospect, decisions what we making today in life, is nothing compared to the decision when\nto eat a piece of bread. It seems I left it like this in this camp till 1944. In 1945, from 1945 to January,\n19--, no from 1944 also, in September till January '45, I was sent to another camp by the name of\nYavozna.\nAre you able to spell that?\nYeah, V , yeah. The name of the camp, how did they spell it? Y-a-v-o-z-h-n-a. Some of the\npeople were working there in the coal mines. I managed to work again on the outside, again at another\nelectrical company. Another company that (150) for electricity. Because I had already\nexperience in that work, therefore they choose me to go there. My second thought was, I was afraid\nto go down in the coal mines where I never will come up again. This was always in my mind. IfI go\ndown there, I'll never come up again. I will starve or be buried alive. It was till 1945, January, about\nthe 18th, 17th of January where we already knew that the Russian front 1s approaching closer.\nYou could hear bombing?\nWe could hear. We already found those at Cracow was already (c.161) and this was only sixty\nmiles away from Cracow.\nThis was relatively close to Auschwitz?\nYeah, this was close to Auschwitz. Was also affiliated from Auschwitz. Auschwitz by itself had\nmany camps which were affiliated to Auschwitz because they needed slave labor outside of\nAuschwitz. The day before, I would say one day before the liberation of this camp, they managed,\nthey managed us; thousands were driven out from the camp by our so-called tormentors. I never\nending that much from Poland to the vicinity of Salesea (c.171) to lower Germany, into Germany\nagain.\nLievich? (c.171)",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Lievich, that's right. On the way, many of my friends collapsed and died of hunger, illness, cold\nweather, simply exhaustion; they couldn't go anymore. Those who could not continue on this\ninhuman march, were shot dead by the Germans immediately. I still cannot understand my endurance,\nthe strength to survive it all where my only food was snow on the ground.\nHad they given you a ration before you left the camp?\nYes. They give us a ration before we left the camp but it lasted also for this one night. Then we were\nsleeping outside on the outer fields and our food was only snow. Someone found something beneath\nthe snow, grass or something. One night, in the beginning of February, this was January, 1945, when\nwe reached the area of Lievich, Germany, again we were packed into a huge barn, like cattle ready\nfor slaughter. It seemed that time that the murderers were about to kill all of us wretched, powerless\nand defenseless victims. I was not mistaken in my assumption. That night, one of those night I, Irving\nBalsam, decided to risk an escape.\nAlone?\nNo, I did escape with another inmate which we helped together. In camp, in concentration camp,\neveryone had a buddy. You could not survive alone. You had to have a buddy, a friend, a brother,\nwe call them a brother, a buddy. I also had a buddy, a young boy who was the same age that I was.\nWe kept to ourselves since Lagisza together. I felt that time I couldn't stand the cold weather, the\nbeating on the way, the shooting of those who could not walk any longer. I felt I had nothing to lose.\nOn that bitterly cold night, I and my buddy Henry, a young Jew, Henry Margolis was his name, a\nyoung Jew from Kalisz, also a little town in Poland, we fled the barn. We didn't flee the barn at first.\nWe first hid ourselves underneath the straw. We hid ourselves in the machine which was made the--\nfrom the wheat corns, cleaned the wheat, the corns, from the leaves. They used to call it a thrash\nmachine. A thrash machine, you know, you have those machine where they farm. First we hid\nourselves underneath the straw. It's on? As we lay there in this machine inside, we found a lot of\ncorn to eat, the little corn.\nFrom the wheat?\nFrom the wheat, that's right. This corn kept us there one day and one night. But the cold, it was in\nJanuary, in February and this cold in Germany there is very--the weather is cold, probably below 20\ndegrees or something. We couldn't stand no more this bitter cold. We felt that our feet are freezing.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "How many people were in that barn? Hundreds or--?\nThe people were--by hundreds of people. A lot of them were hiding but most of them were caught.\nHiding in various places in this barn?\nVarious places of this barn. Most of them were caught. It seems that our hiding place was the best,\nwas the best. As we laid there in the barn, the cold permeated our very marrow of our feet. It was\ncold, we felt we were going to be frostbitten which is worse, the beginning already of frostbite 1n our\nlegs. We--later in the morning, we heard a voice in the barn. We heard a voice speaking to the\nchickens. It was a farmer boy who happened to be Polish- speaking so he spoke 1n Polish words, we\nrecognized him, to the chickens that they should gather together, he brought them food.\nWere the other prisoners still in the barn at that time?\nWas no more in the barn?\nThe barn had been evacuated?\nThe barn had been evacuated and the further marched. The further marched and we were left alone.\nWhile we met this man, we spoke to him in Polish. We told him that we are hungry. We would like\nalso, if it is possible, to bring us some food. To which he agreed. You cannot imagine our--not\nsatisfaction--our hope that we thought here we finally find somebody speaks Polish, we are Polish.\nHe probably recognized that we are Jews and we told him and he agreed to bring us some food.\nWas he a boy younger than you?\nHe was about--we the same age--about 17, 18 years old at that time. When he agreed, I hoped that\ntime we will outlast this nightmare of the war. It seemed almost at the end. However, it seems that\nJewish survival in those awful days was not easy, not even in the best of shelters. After a short wait\nour benefactor, instead of delivering the sorely needed substance, returned with Gestapo men who\nimmediately arrested us and threw us back into the prison of Glewitz (c.288). While the others\nmarched on, I'm sure to further extermination or to their deaths. When we came to jail, we found\nabout sixty more completely miserable, ill Jews, all of them captured escaped from the death march.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "It seems that a lot of them also ran away from the death march and were hiding in different places.\nBefore long, the Germans had driven most of us captives into the prison yard, forty of them were shot\nto death immediately. Immediately after that, the German assassins ordered us, the remaining 20\nJews to pile the murdered victims--some dead and others still half alive, you can imagine that not\neveryone was shot to death, some of them were alive--into a huge wagon which they all had prepared.\nThis was a train car?\nNo, was a horse and a buggy but horse-wagon without horse. We had to harness ourselves to the\nwagon and drag the vehicle to an old Jewish cemetery on the outskirt of Gl (c.314)\nWere you amongst those having to pull?\nYes. I was amongst them having to pull.\nHow many of you were pulling, do you remember?\nAll 20 of us went with this. We were pulling and pushing this wagon with the dead bodies. The trip\nto this burial place accompanied by savage blows and curses from the cold-blooded henchmen, was\nan experience, deeply shattered experience which I--it's agonizing to this day, even to the thought.\nWhenever I tell this story, it is--1t takes off years of my life because we thought that time will heal\nbut--.. When we reached the cemetery, we saw two open mass graves.\nWas this a real, an established cemetery?\nYes, was established, old cemetery. I found it after the war.\nWas it a Jewish cemetery or--?\nA Jewish cemetery in Germany. The Germans on the German territory, did not, did not vandalize the\ncemeteries, the old German cemeteries. Only in Poland they did it. But the Germans had Jewish\ncemeteries. I went to look up this cemetery in 1979. I went to Germany on a trial, testifying against\nthe Nazis. When we came to this cemetery, we saw two mass graves. It immediately dawned on me,",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "after all I had four years experience with the Germany, I know already their thinking about us. They\ntreating--the way they were treating us--as sub-humans that in one of the graves was for the other\nJews which they were shot before. The other 1s for us.\nWas your friend Henry still alive with you?\nYes, my friend Henry was alive. It was clear to us and to me and we were talking among ourselves\nthat we would be the next. I was not at least mistaken in the assumption. As soon as we---already\nslowed the Jews where they were disposed into the mass grave, the German criminals resumed the\nshooting and immediately the dead, dying, half-alive, and heavily wounded began falling into the\nsecond grave. The full cemetery, the area there was saturated with the blood of our victims, with my\nfriends, with my people what we were together in camps. For the time, we had piercing screams,\nheart-rendering moans and pained _\u2014_\u2014_\u2014(374) for help. Even my friend Henry fell into the mass\ngrave and he was not shot. I heard him scream out, out, out. Suddenly, a dead silence enveloped the\nentire cemetery. I was among the unfortunate Jews in the second mass grave. As the stillness\ncontinues, the German henchmen yelled into the grave. I can tell you in German what they said. Bist\ndu__(c.387), anybody alive, , come out. Anybody alive, come out. Anyone still alive,\ncome right out. I and four more Jews, who escaped the assassin's bullet, crept out and were ordered\nto cover the horror of the gasping hole containing the dead and the near-dead Jews. How did we\nmanage to come out without any bullet? When you dig a grave, you have sand from the grave, right?\nThe sand creates a mound of other sand. When they aimed their machine gun and their pistols into\nthe grave, they stood on this mound of sand. We, five boys who were laying on this side of the grave,\nthis side the bullets did not reach us because they were going over us. So all of us who were laying\non the side of the wall, on this one side of the wall, did not get any bullets.\nSo they had forced you into the grave first?\nThat's right. First they started shouting. Then they said, jump in. So we all jumped in, we had no\nchoice. We did that under the threat of the Nazi guns pointing at us, we came out. When the gristly\ncrime finally, was finally out of sight, the executioner shot two more of our small group and then\naimed their guns at me and the remaining two Jews. Miuraculously, their guns did not discharge\nbecause there were no more bullets left in them. Was everything used up, they kept on shooting into\nthe mass grave.\nThey aimed the machine guns at you again?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "They didn't have no more bullets in the machine guns. They only have side pistols. When we all five\ncame out, they used the rest bullets on the other two. When they aimed the gun at me, no more bullets.\nA man, an older man who had on one hand, one arm, he must have been maybe from the first World\nWar, a veteran or something, he still had his gun in his holster. When the other Gestapo men ask him,\nHans Hans, give me dine browling (444). That means Hans, give my dine pistol to finish them off.\nThis older man refused to give the pistol. He said for dezen younga (449), for these young men, I\ndon't give a pistol. They left him alone. I could say that's why, probably I am alive today, to tell the\nstory. After we were finished, we were commanded to harness ourselves to the wagon which\ntransported its ill-fated load to the cemetery and the hairy guard, again with the--four of them,\nGerman, SS men and soldiers together, were driven back to this Gl____ Prison where we were locked\nin for three more days. It seemed that time to me, like an eternity.\nHow many days total were you in prison?\nMaybe, two weeks. Fate, however, saved us once more from the clutch of death. After the three days\nconfinementinthe Gl ____ prison, I was taken out of jail and I was certain I'm being led to the execution\nagain. Instead we were transferred to the railroad station and transferred on the cattle wagons to\nanother concentration camp in Austria by the name of Mauthausen. After being in Mauthausen a few\ndays, I was again sent on a commando to Koozen (c.493). It was a camp, Koozen #2 where we\nworked on Messerschmitt, airplanes for the German army. I can't recall how many days, how many\ntimes. It was absolutely, completely no food at all. One soup with a little green stuff swimming\naround in the soup, I don't know what it was, was food for a whole day. For this we worked.\nYou worked in the airplane factory?\nYeah. The airplane parts factory was in the mountains, inside, in mountains. They should not--they\nwere hidden from the attacks of the Allied airplanes.\nDid you have a specific job each day?\nYeah, we would tighten the screws. We mounted screws and we put on wheels. It seems they didn't\nhave no more motors for the airplanes. There were tens, twenties, maybe hundreds of airplanes that\nwere ready to be shipped but they didn't get--have the motors for them.\nEverything else was finished on them?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Everything was finished, just the motors they didn't have. They never arrived because I think the\nAllies bombarded the factories with motors.\nDo you remember them ever threatening you about attempting to sabotage an airplane?\nNo. They didn't threaten us. It was a known fact because every where you went. There were signs,\nsabotage, dein tod, (517), if you sabotage, you'll be killed. Everybody was very careful to do what\nyou could precisely. After being in V (c.528) for, I would say, some days, this was the last\ncamp, not to exterminate us but to starve us to death.\nNot Goozen (c.528)?\nNot Goozen, taken out from Goozen, they took us again on a march to another town in Austria what's\nthe name, near Veldts (c.538), in the forest was a camp by the name of Gunkerin (c.535) which\nthere were only two barracks and 20,000 people. How can you fit in 20,000 people in two barracks\nwhich can only hold maybe 500?\nI've read that many were crushed to death in the barracks.\nThat's right. The people were crushed to death. In the morning when you got up in the morning, you\nthought you sleeping with somebody and in the meantime the other guy was already dead. You slept\namong bodies, sickness, typhus, dysentery, everything was going on. And the rain did not stop. The\nforest was full of rain, day out and day in for the last ten days, there was nothing but rain. If we got\nalready, one can of soup for a hundred people, there was specially a camp to starve us. The soup\nnever reached the people because the hunger was so great--the hunger was so great from the people\nthat they became inhuman. They attacked the can of soup and spilled it on the floor. They were\neating from the floor with the mud, with every dirty thing in the rain.\nLet me switch the tape. (Side B, Tape 1)\nHad the war lasted, I mean had the American army not reached us on May 5, 1945, if this would have\nlasted another week, none of us would have been alive today from that particular camp. We were\nliberated May 5 by the American army.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Do you remember when the SS left?\nYes. Friday evening. I remember May was on a Saturday and Friday evening, all of a sudden we\nsaw that the watch booth from the watchmen from the SS men from the Germans getting emptied out.\nThey're running away. We did not know the reason because we were inside deep in the forest.\nHowever, many boys who had still the strength to go out and investigate what happening had noticed\ntanks with the star. We didn't know that time what tanks it was, whether it was Russian tanks,\nAmerican tanks. We know only that--tanks. It seems that the same night, the American army passed-\n- liberated us. The night of May 4 and May 5. All of a sudden, the day of May 5, we were sitting in\nthe forest and the sun started to shine. Every one of us was full with lice, bitten, wet clothes. So we\nstarted to remove our clothing and shake it out from the lice. It seems that it didn't help much. After\nwe found out a few days later, we were all infected t with typhus. When the American army rounded\nus up and put us into field hospitals--they created special hospitals for us, the ill survivors. Many\nhundreds died after the liberation from the sickness. Was too late for them.\nWas your friend Henry still alive?\nI am the lucky one who survived. My wife too in the same camp. Who is alive?\nHenry.\nNo he was shot that time in the grave.\nOh, he was shot, I see.\nI lost my friend Henry. He got down among the second batch, He was separate. After the war--from\nthere we stood--we were liberated=--we were in the hospital for many weeks where I met my wife, at\nthat time a young girl. weighing maybe sixty pounds, fifty pounds. We comfort each other since that\nday. We remained. We were in the DP camp, displaced persons camp in Austria until about 1948,\nuntil we could reach the shores of the United States.\nWhich DP camp were you in?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "In Austria, in Links (9). Vien . Ever heard about that? We reached there because we had\nfamily in the United States. We reached the shores of the United States. We established our lives\nagain here. We came to this country, we had a small child, one year old. That's the best we had. We\nkept on going and hoping. I think that's what sustained us. We're still hoping up till today, maybe\nsomeone is still alive, some other place which we don't know; I didn't believe that my parents are\nnot--no more alive. I didn't believe that my brothers and sister are not alive no more. I guess the\n____ of every survivor. And this is what sustained us in camp. Had I known that no one 1s alive from\nmy family, I probably wouldn't have fought to live. But this was one thing we were hoping that\nsomebody is alive and that it pays to live to tell the story. Because my father told me when I was\ntaken to the first camp, that he blessed me. I was the first one to leave my house to be taken to camp.\nHe says go ahead my son. When you come back, you tell me the story. He told me I should tell him\nthe story and that was in my mind. To die now, what would I tell my father? I had nothing to tell\nhim. Nobody would tell him the story, That's what I'm thinking. That's why I call myself a survivor.\nWhat else can I tell you?\nWhen did you come to the U.S.?\nIn 1948, December, 1948.\nIsee. You came --.\nI established myself. I came here to the Bronx. I came to the Bronx, I remained tn the Bronx. a loyal\ncitizen of the Bronx. I must say my life was not bad in the United States. I succeeded in business\nand have a nice family, three children, grandchildren. We are close, close-knit family. If someone is\nalive, I doubt it. It's too late already. It's today, 47 years after the war. I'm very involved now in the\nsurvivors' movement. I am the president of the Riverdale chapter of the Holocaust Survivors. You\nheard of them. We have two hundred families as members. We are having meetings practically very\nmonth with our aim is to teach, to teach the next generation, to sensitize the community, to transmit\nto our children and to help others. We have a very good outreach program. Ifa survivor is in need,\nwe do help. Therefore, I think I have a mission in life. I am fulfilling this mission, to tell the story.\nAnything else you want to know?\nI'd like to get a little more detail if that's possible. I like to get some information about your life before\nthe war. About your family, where you lived, what your father did for a living?",

        "As I mentioned before, I was not quite 15 when the war broke out. I was born in 1924. The war\nstarted in 1939. A month before my birthday, my 15th birthday. I came from a family of very--a\nreligious family.\nHasid or--?\nNo, my father was not a Hasid. Observant, religious family. Wore a hat and a short, short little beard,\nmodern. Today we would call 1t modern orthodox, modern orthodox. We were--we come not from\narich family. My father was a tailor. He struggled for a living most of his life.\nHe was an independent tailor?\nIndependent tailor, that's right. I mean, he worked for others. They brought him work.\nDid he work out of your home?\nOf the home, yeah. He worked at home. He had a machine in his house and all 160) was\nnecessary to do his job. Our life was not easy because he only had, as I remember, as far as I can\nremember from home--. A person can only remember the last few years, right? between 10 and 15\nyears. He can't remember before. He worked only six months a year. The last six months we were\nalready bad off.\nWhy was that?\nBecause we lived in a small town. It was a lot of people, Jewish people, in the same situation. Were\na lot of tailors and carpenters and all, was not steady work. When he worked six months a year, we\nhad to--the other six months was struggling. Here and there some work.\nWhat was the mainstay of--?\nWas not easy for us to even have enough for food in the family, sometimes as I can recall. But in\n1938, life started to get a little bit easier already, before the war. Because I had an older brother who\nwas 18 years old and he was already employed as an electrician in the city of Lodz and he helped out",

        "already with some, what do you call it, he sent some money home, helped out the rest of the family.\nSo it was a little better. Then I joined in, as a fourteen year old boy, also left for Lodz, to study.\nWhat did you do?\nMy intention was to study.\nYou went to a gymnasium there?\nYeah, I wanted--my intention was to study in gymnasium and to learn a profession. But it was not\neasy because I didn't have the means--\nFinancial means?\nthe financial means to remain in this big town.\nWere you staying with your brother?\nI was staying with my brother as far as he could, he helped me. We slept together, we ate together.\nBut I still needed more financial means. I went to work also as a shipping boy. Both of us already\nmade sure that we supplied my parents, my father and mother with the other two siblings home with\nmoney.\nWere you two the oldest?\nWe were the oldest. We used to send them home some money that their life should be a little easier.\nSo you worked and you were going to school at the same time?\nNo. I could not. I was thinking, I was working--. No, I would intend to go to school because I\nregistered for the next year's semester.",

The rest of the semester and then the war broke out and it came near the border and it\nnever happened again.\nWas this a Jewish gymnasium?\nNo, it was not--I don't think it was. It was a Polish technological school, like you learned a trade.\nWhat was your goal?\nMy goal was to learn a, how you call this in English? I had two goals.

I was never dressed Hasidic, I was dressed\nmore in modern clothes, a boy would dress already in that time. We were learning, we had to do\nhomework. We had homework for Hebrew school and for the regular public school. The hardest\ntime was, for me, I remember for us in school was, because the school was open six days a week\nincluding Saturday. We Jewish boys did not go Saturday to the school. So we weren't, we missed\nschool every Saturday and Sunday. We had to get from the other school friends,--\nThe Poles?\nFrom the Polish school friends, we had to get the lessons what we had to prepare for Monday, for\nschool.

We start at 8 o'clock. Between 8 and 9 was a lesson in Polish,\nright? Then you had a five-minute intermission, you went in for math. Then you have the big\nintermission between 10 and 11.

I must say most of the time, we fought\nback. We fought back and we prevailed. Was a time where they were already afraid for us, to touch\nus because they knew that they will start with the Jewish boys and among my friends, were very\nstrong ones.

He said five million people too\nmuch in Poland. If we could get rid of them, we would--Poland would be an excellent country.\nWould be enough work for all the Polaks, everything was bad at the time.

They thought that they can take out\nbut they cannot. They could take our apartments, they could take our furniture, they could take our\nlife, they could take away everything. But they couldn't take away our brain. Therefore, it was wrong\nand antisemitism was very great in Poland. And in the last years, which I remember the last years of\nmy life in Poland, 1938 and '39, I must say therefore the Germans had an easier job with the Jews in\nPoland than in any other country.\nThey had natural collaborators?\nHad natural collaborators. Absolutely right.\nDid your family live in an apartment or a house?\nNo, we lived in an apartment. We lived in an apartment.

Cold flat, there was no heat; there was no electricity;\nthere was no gas.\nRunning water?\nNo running water, no toilets. We lived. We lived a happy life, a happy family home, father and\nchildren. Father went down in the coldest weather. Brought up coal and wood, made a little fire in\nthe oven. When I grew up already, me and my brother, we went to the pump to pump water.

Until this vicious storm came in and pulled us all in which we did not\nexpect. Life was one small (283).

Because it was the dream.\nYou were part of the Zionist organization?\nI am part of the Zionist organization. It was the dream that for Zionists, not Zionist home, our own\nhome. At that time we didn't know they were going to get rid of us physically, but they get rid of us\ntormenting, antisemitism, progroms in other towns and other things.\nWas your father a supporter of Zionism?\nYes, yes, he was a supporter of Zionists, yeah. He also believe in that the Jews must have their own\ncountry. He was a learned man. He learned history; he learned the Bible; he was learning the Talmud.\nSo he knew the history of the Jewish people. He knew that there is no future for us in Europe, in\nPoland particularly.\nDid he, himself, have the desire to go to Palestine?\nNo, I tell you why he didn't have the desire. In Poland a 40-year old man was old. He used to say\nI'm an old man already. Now I remind myself when the war broke out, he was 45 years old, forty\nyears was old. It was a different time. A mother of 45 years, she looked like a old lady. It was an\nexception with my mother, she did not look an old lady but it was already. Here 50 years, was old\nman, a long beard, white beard. So he had no desire. But he wished for a better life for the children.\nOf course, the dream was there. The Zionist dream was there. It was promised through the Balfour\nDeclaration to different politicians. He followed that, we followed that in the Zionist movement and\nwe thought that our life will sometimes he there.

The feeling was that I left for home. I\nleft for home; I left for hom. I didn't want to be in the big city.\nYour brother remained?\nMy brother remained. He says to me, you go home. Mother and father, because I was not done there,\nthe oldest and I had a younger brother from ten. Now he was, in 1929, he was ten, my younger sister\nwas four years old.\nWhat do you remember about that first day the Germans entered your town?\nA very good question. I remember it a lot. The night before the Germans entered my town, we were\nsitting a bunch of boys in the street, on the stoop. You know, like here you go out, a bunch of boys\non the stoop, was very dark. As I mentioned before, there was no electricity. We were sitting and\ntalking and fooling around and joking like young boys and girls do. It was about eleven o'clock--the\npoliceman in town who knew us very well came over to us and he says, go home, go home. Shut off\nthe lights. Wherever anybody had a candle or a lamp burning, tell your parents shut off the light.\nMust be dark in every window.\nThis a Jewish policeman or just a--?\nNo, no. It was a Polish policeman. Go home. So we disbursed and went home. I came home and I\nsaid, you know Father. Policeman, I know his name, R (357) was his name, told us to go home.\nThe war is coming. The war is coming. My father says, nobody knows. What does he know? But\nhe told us, the war is coming, shut off the lights and stay in your house. Sure enough, we went to\nsleep. Four o'clock in the morning, we heard a bang. There was a little bridge in our town between\nthe border of Germany and Poland which was connecting both countries. The bridge was what, thirty\nfeet wide. Yeah, that's all, maybe 30 feet wide. This bridge was dynamite by the Polish army.\nThat was over the Prozna (ph)(371) River?\nThat's right. How do you know?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "I did some research.",
        "That's right. Was the Prozna River. Was a little bridge over the Prozna River and it was dynamited\nby the Polish army that the Germans should not be able to come in. In the meantime, when they were\ndynamiting this little bridge over the Prozna, the Germans were already in town from another side.\nThis was because there were certain places where the bridge, maybe one kilometer further was as\nnarrow, we used to jump over. We used to make tricks, we jump to Germany. So the Polish army\ncame over there with their tanks and with their trucks, was already in town. Immediately. So when\nwe looked out, it got light, six o'clock in the morning, Germans are all over. Bayonets, I remember it\ntoday, the bayonets and the tanks and the trucks are coming down to put right away another bridge\nup. They were right away looking for Jews to go to work. So they grabbed, I went down there, a\nlittle boy in short pants, never looked Jewish. Had red hair with a lot of pimple on my face. I went\ndown and greeted the Germans. First I went to the bakery before when the Germans were ready to\ncome. I ran over to the bakery, me and my little brother and the baker ran away from town. He ran\naway from town, he was afraid when he heard shooting, he left all the bread on the floor. So we\ngrabbed as much as I could. I hand to him and we brought it home. Fresh bread. Then other people\ncame and they also had bread. After this, we already came home, I see already the German marching\nJews. They caught some Jews to work to help them build the bridge. They marching there and the\nJews were right away standing, the first day, the first few hours, up here into the water. The Prozna\nwasn't a big water and they were helping to rebuild the bridge what the Polish army exploded.\nNaturally, I ran to the house, hid my father. Took my father and my mother to the basement. I stood\nin front of the house. German soldiers came over with the bayonets like this, says Juda, Juda--.(397)\nJewish?",
        "No, Juda. No Jew. Juda here, they want to know where a Jew is living there because in other places\nthey had looked the Polish told them right away where was a Jew. They didn't know I'm a Jew. I'm\nnot going to tell on my family. I say no Juda, no Jew, no Juda and they went further with their\nbayonets and they made sure that everybody opened the stores. The stores that everything should be\nnormal. Most of the people run away from town. I witnessed the first boots, the German boots. All\nof a sudden, the army started marching, the German army. Army, motorcycles, trucks and tanks.\nMotorcycles, trucks and tanks for seven days, night and day, night and day, marching through our\ntown to the city of Lodz. Seven days later, they were in Lodz and occupied Lodz and everything on\nthe way. This was Friday. Sunday, they corralled all the Jews from my town into the synagogue. I\nshowed you a picture of the synagogue. Naturally, I didn't let my father go, not my father. I went\nwith my little brother. We all looked like little, no Jewish boys. Here they bringing Jews from all\nover the town into the synagogue. We thought--I didn't want to risk my parents. The idea was, we\nfound out later, that the idea was to explode the synagogue with the people in there. This was on\nSunday, three days later.

I don't know where they got the orders but it\nwas in their hand. As we stood there in the synagogue and I listened without a hat, I went in without\na hat, I didn't put any. He was hollering--the general goes up on the bima, on the stage and he said,\nyou should know, the German, you have killed many Germans in this town. Three German soldiers\nwere killed yesterday by Jews. You entitled to die, all of you. But we giving you the last warning.\nIf ever any German soldier will be killed in this town again, you all will be killed and he disbursed\nthe people. He did not--we found out later from the Germans sources that they couldn't do it in our\ntown, it was too close to Germany. It was too close, the army was marching by, you understand.\nMatter of fact the synagogue remained, it's still there.. This was on Sunday. Then they start marching\nand leaving us fairly alone, on our own till they established a headquarters and a Gestapo, They\ncaught to work. We had to make the roads wider for the German tanks to pass.\nYou worked on the roads?\nYeah, we worked on the roads. Then we eliminated even some houses. There were some houses\nstanding in the corner, little houses of wood and the German tank would pass say take it down. We\nhad to clear it up, they should be able to cross. They took us right to work but we came home tn the\nevening. They grabbed young people.\nYour father--?\nNo, no. Never, we never let them. I always protected my father. I never let him go to work. He was\nhidden. I always went because every family had to supply people so I went, my mother went\nsometimes to sweep the streets. My father, no. He had very bad legs, he had broken legs before the\nwar and he couldn't do. I protected my father. What else can I remember? Then, lasted until 1940.\nDid they require armbands of you at that time?\nYeah, that's right. Two months later, a few weeks had been very quiet, we should wear all armbands\nand the Star of David.\nDid you wear a patch or--?",

        "Wear a patch, Star of David and a yellow armband. This way, they left us still in our homes. But we\nwere not allowed after five 0;'clock out. In the morning, they let us out. But in order for us to sustain\nourselves, especially my mother was the one who was the supplier of food. She ran into the village\nand bought some food from the peasants and brought it home dressed as a Polish woman. And I took\noff my band whenever--and I didn't walk in the sidewalk, I walked straight on the sidewalk. Because\nif I walk in the sidewalk, they knew already Iam a Jew. The only thing I have to watch out for is that\na Polak should not see me, he would tell him this is a Jew.\nYou would walk in the street?\nIn the street, right. You see what I mean? I walked--not in the street, I walked on the sidewalk. Took\noff my band, went over, brought something for somebody else, the other guy had sugar, this one had\nbread. You know, we did some exchanging in order to survive. This was about till 1940, till they\nmade a ghetto. They took part of the city and they separated. We all had to leave within two hours\nour homes that we were living for many years and go into this ghetto. Two, three families in one\nroom.\nSo your apartment wasn't within the established boundaries?\nNo, my apartment was not. We had to leave, we had to leave. We left and the other boundary was\ncloser to the Jewish cemetery. Whatever we took along, we took along. Everything left. Furniture,\nwho cares about furniture that ttme? We took along some schmattas, (51), to dress, that's all, to sustain\nyourself. There in the ghetto, we lived together. Three families into aroom. Again they took us, the\nyoung people had to go to work to build the roads, to clean the snow. Winter came in and the\nGermans--you know they're very harsh winters.. Snow and the Germans had to travel with their\ntrucks. We had to make the roads, we had to work for them. Till little by little, they liquidated the\nghetto. They liquidated us young people, I told you, they took us to camp. Shipped off to camp,\nslave-labor camp.\nSo you were the first to go in your family?\nWith the first eighty boys. Looking back, retrospect, we were 80 boys with four Germans taking us\non the transport. Can you imagine? No one had to--the strength or the wisdom to attack the four\nGermans. Eighty! Take away their ammunition and run to the forests. But nobody knew it. When\nI went away, I said to my father, I'm going to tell you the story. I'm going to tell you when I come\nback. We all thought that we going to work for three months in labor camp and we'll going to come\nback.. But the whole thing was to trick us in, to trick us in. So when the young people were already",

The very old people, like the\nbuby, the grandmother and-- grandfather was not alive but I had a grandmother and other people, they\ntook them in the cemetery and shot them. They all buried in a mass grave there in Praszka. So that\nwas the lot of my town.\nWhat happened to your oldest brother? Did he remain in Lodz?\nNo, my oldest brother, I must say he died a hero,. Why did he die a hero? Because he had a good\ntrade, he was an electrician. He came home from Lodz during the war. He run to Warsaw during the\nwar but he came home from Warsaw. He came home from Warsaw to his parents. When I was taken\nout to camp, he remained home with my parents. When they had the ghetto, they clean up the ghetto,\nthey ask all the people who had a trade, go to the right, and all the other people, my father and mother\nwith the other children to the left. I was told, I met a boy who was in the same line, my landsman. I\nmet him in 1944. He said your brother Moishe did not want to leave the parents.\nSo he went in their line?\nThat's right. He did not want to leave the parents. He don't know what they're going to do without\nhim. That's why I said, he died a hero. He thought, he didn't know. He thought they're going to take\nhim with the parents and two little children. Two younger brothers with a sister, they are going to\ntake them. Maybe they're going to put them in the Lodz ghetto, he will work a electrician, he will\nhave a trade. No, but it was the opposite. They took the other ones to the ghetto. If he would have\ngone out from the line and said I am an electrician, they would have grabbed him. He would have\nbeen.--. (End of Tape 1) I had to report to the SS man who was watching me.

It was a better one he give you two\nminutes, it was a bastard, he said one minute back. I run to the toilet, do what you have to do, come\nback in a minute, if you manage. That's what they say. I always wondered, what will happen if they\nshould give _(c.7). They wouldn't have to have the problems. They always could see this one,\nthis one.

They old, they changed, they've no hair.\nYou see what I mean? Instead of saying they taking four people, do you recognize two? No, they\ntook 50 people to look at. Whata_\u2014\u2014\u2014(144)._I recognized one on the picture. They show me then\na picture in his uniform, then I recognize him so I said this is him. In the uniform, otherwise, I couldn't\nrecognize him. I testified for two days, all by myself. I felt that I'm the accused. Can you imagine,\nseven judges! Here I have no attorney, have no defense, nobody on my side.\nSo they were busy asking you questions?\nYeah, they was asking me questions. You have to tell the story. How did you see? How do you\nknow it's him? How do you it's him and how come you're--? How close were you from him? Were\nyou two feet, three feet? I said ten feet away. They said how can you recognize it's him. I said\nbecause I saw him everyday in camp. I know it was him. If I would be closer, I wouldn't be here to\ntestify, he would shoot me. He would kill me. The last day, I had an argument with them, not an\nargument, I had a statement. A very positive statement. I just spoke to their conscience. To the\nGerman judges and to them. I said one word. Through my testimony, I implicated another two SS\nmen which were later tried. One got prison sentence. They want me to come for the other trial but I\ndidn't want to come no more. They want me to come for the trial for the SS men from Lagisza where\nI was, near Benjum (162) where I told you. I didn't want to go no more. They came here. I testified",

He got sentenced one Smith.\nHe was in the camp Lagisza--I know I just saw it. Now when I'm looking, I want to show you this\npiece of paper. Where do I have it? I cut it out from paper. This Smith was sentenced so many years\nbecause of--the camp from Lagisza-- because I implicated him. I wouldn't find it because I didn't\nprepare it.

You know I don't remember, I don't remember. I'm\nsure it wasn't a sitting train. There was no sitting train but I actually don't remember. I remember\ngetting off in Birkenau. You know where Mengele was there and everybody else. They took people\nto the right and to the left. I remember that. It was cattle cars, yes, but we were not packed like cattles\nfrom that because the Germans who put us there were a little different. I mean from this camp.\nYou put through the quarantine at that time?\nI was put--yeah. Taken away my clothes. Taken away the clothing, taken away I had pictures from\nhome, everything gave away. Went into shower one side, came out other side naked, give me other\nclothes and a different man, a different person.\nDid they give you a striped uniform too or just __?\nYeah, sure. Striped uniform, striped shirts.\nUp to then you'd been in civilian clothes?\nUp to then, I was in civilian clothes. My own clothes from home. We exchanged, you know, from\nhome, this and that, civilian clothes. Then I got the striped uniform with the striped hat, with the\nshoes.\nWooden shoes or--?",

        "AUGUST 6, 1992",
        "SILVER SPRING,MD\nThe date is August 6, 1992 and we're speaking with Dr. Marsha Rozenblit in Silver Spring, Maryland.\nDr. Rosenblit is going to tell us about her father and his family, and any family members that she can\nrecall. So please, could you tell me your father's name, his date of birth, his place of birth and then\nanything you can about his childhood and his family.\nOkay, my father whose name was Mendel Rozenblit was born on November 13, 1907 in a town called\nLukow in Poland. Anyway this town was in the area of Lublin, I don't know exactly in which direction\nor..... Okay, so my father was born in Lukow which was near Lublin in 1907. He was born into a\npretty religious family. I think that parts of the family were associated with the Hasidim. But he did\nnot grow up technically as a Hasidic child. He was just an ordinary traditionally religious Polish\nJewish boy. His father died when he was very young, well not very young I guess. Well, let me go\nbackwards a little bit. My father was one of about six or seven children and he was in the middle. He\nwas not the oldest or the youngest; he was one of the middle children. His father died when he was a\nyoung boy. I think, if my memory serves me correctly, he was about twelve when his father died,\nwhich means his father died just after World War I of asthma. But I think he was sickly for most of\nhis life. But my grandmother, that is my father's mother whose name was - well I should say that my\nfather's father's name was Avraham Rozenblit - and his mother Masha Markusfeld Rozenblit, after",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "whom I'm named, Marsha - Masha, his mother managed quite well to have six children and run the\nfamily. She owned a, well my mother used to say she owned a general store, but my cousin in Israel\nwho was seventeen when he left Poland and really knew her, said that she basically owned a shoe\nstore. That is, she sold other things too, but it was mostly shoes and what she would do is, she would\ntake trips to Warsaw or Lublin and see what was in the fancy shoe stores there and then copy them\nand arranged to have the shoes made. She didn't make them herself. She wasn't a shoemaker but she\nwould get them made and then sell them, both in the store and also in a kind of...She would send her\nchildren out to sell them also, when they were grown, to sell them to the peasants in the villages. That\nI learned from my cousin in Israel. But let me just try to say something about my father's family\nbackground in general before I talk more specifically. They were a very religious family and pictures\nof my father show him wearing the sort of traditional cap of the Polish Jews, you know that sort of\nsquarish cap. I can't tell from the pictures whether he has pais or not, it's hard to tell, but maybe he\ndid. I should say before I go on that my father died, Mendel Rozenblit, the survivor that we're talking\nabout, died in 1961 when I was ten years old so that most of my recollections come from either things\nI actually remember him saying, or things that my mother told me that he had said, or things that my\ncousin in Israel, that 1s his nephew, Mordecai Rozenblit, who came to Palestine in 1938 has told me.\nSo it's a sort of conglomerate of those things. So, in any case it was a traditional religious family in\nthe Lublin area. His mother owned this shoe store. I don't think she was rich but she was reasonably\nprosperous and my father had all of these brothers and sisters. His oldest, I don't even know the age\norder, I think Nehama the sister, he had one sister and five brothers I believe, and the sister, Nehama,\nwas I think the oldest and then there were other brothers. There was Simcha, there was Haim Yakov,\nthere was Meir who was the baby, there was Yehoshua and I know how most of them died actually\nand I'll get back to that later when we talk about it. But Haim Yakov was a very ardent Zionist and\nhe left Poland before the war. He went to Palestine in 1937 and then his son Mordecai joined him in\n1938.\nWere the rest of the family involved in Zionism, do you know?\nYou know, I don't know. My cousin, Mutti, Mordecai, in Israel has many times told me that you\nknow, he had said to me, [Marsha, at yahdat ha abba shelach lo haya Zioni] which means Marsha,\nyour father wasn't a Zionist. But I think that's not true. I think that Mutti means by that, that my father\ndidn't move to Palestine after the war. And Mutti is still mad at him forty years later for not having\ndone that. I do have his Zionist membership card from after the war. But, of course, everybody was\na zionist after the war. So the question is was he an active Zionist before the war. Judging from the\nschools he sent his children to I don't think so. That is an active Zionist. I don't think he was active\nin the Zionist movement, no. But he was probably sympathetic to Zionism.\nI was going to ask you about the town. Have you researched or found out anything about that town,\nwas it a shtetl or...?\nWell all towns are shtetls, shtetl just means little town.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "What was the nature of this town?\nIt was a small town. I don't know how big it was. It certainly wasn't a large place. Lublin was in\ncentral Poland so it was central Poland. I think my image of it as a child was that it was like any small\nAmerican town with white picket fences and neat little houses on neat little streets. And I was shocked\nin 1972 or '03, I was talking to Lucin Dovarshitsky|ph67] who teaches Polish-Jewish history at YIBO\nand who is a member of whatever the staff at the YIBO Institute and Lucin Dovarshitsky|[ph69 | at the\ntime was busy collecting lots and lots and lots of pictures for the Image Before My Eyes volume and\nI said my father was from Lukow and he said, well I've got a picture of Lukow, come and see it. So\nI went upstairs to his office and I looked at this picture of Lukow and it was not my image. I mean it\nwas a muddy little street. This was a picture taken in 1926 and it was this dreary little muddy town.\nSo it was a tiny little nothing of a town, I think. Although my cousin Mutti in Israel who was\nseventeen when he left Lukow has nice memories of it so it couldn't have been that horrendous. I\nmean maybe this picture doesn't do it justice. He has nice memories. My father left Lukow when he\nmarried and lived near Warsaw. I'll get to that in a minute. So his adult life was not in Lukow, it was\nin a Warsaw suburb. The stories of his childhood that he told me when I was little were certainly not\nnegative. If his family was prosperous, even if they weren't rich they wouldn't have suffered much.\nDo you know about his education, where he went to school?\nHe went to Chaida. He was born in 1907. He was born when that part of Poland was part of the\nRussian Empire. I know he just went to traditional Chaida. He did not have a formal secular education\nas far as I know. I do know that he could read Polish easily and that means that he must have had\nsome secular education. All the schooling he ever spoke of was Chaida. On the other hand since he\ncould read Polish novels he must have also gone to something else. He didn't have a gymnasium\neducation, that I know. He didn't go to University. But he must have gone to some Polish school as\nwell as Chaida because you can't read Polish easily if you hadn't. Speaking it is one thing but knowing\nitis another. So I think that he and virtually all his siblings just went to Chaida and maybe also some\nkind of Polish elementary school. There is one thing that is important and that is his younger brother,\nMeir, wanted very much to have a real secular education and he did go to Polish school and\ngymnasium in their town, or maybe not in their town, it's hard to say since I was only ten when my\nfather died, he may have just said gymnasium and maybe Meir went off to Lublin to go to gymnasium,\nI don't know. In any case my grandmother who was a religious woman, who wore a sheitel and so\nforth, nevertheless was willing to let her youngest son go to gymnasium. This must have been already,\nsince Meir is younger than my father, this must have been after World War I. It must have been in\nthe twenties. And the town was very mad at her for doing this. So she was something of a progressive\nbecause she was, although very religious, was willing to let her son go to gymnasium, and of course\ngoing to gymnasium meant going to school on Saturday. And theoretically Jews were exempt from\nwriting. And in fact they were. But obviously it spoke of abandoning traditional Jewish life and",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "entering the larger world. She was certainly willing to do this and was willing to defy the town to let\nthis happen. I remember my father telling a story about how there was a library in town, like a secular\nlibrary. Now maybe it was a Zionist library, may it was Pol...I don't know what and a lot of the\n\"frumies\"[ph104], a lot of the very religious people in town marched against it and they tried to burn\nit down. And my grandmother, who was herself religious and not secular, nevertheless sort of defied\nthem and insisted that her son Meir go to gymnasium. Actually Meir had a very different experience\nfrom all the rest of them. Meir not only went to Polish gymnasium but after he graduated from\ngymnasium, and this must have been into the '30s at some point, he went to University to study to be\na doctor. He didn't go in Poland because it was very difficult for Jews to do that in Poland. He went\nfirst in Italy and then in Paris. He was presumably deported from Paris to Auschwitz because he was\ndead too. So his experience was different from everybody else's. One brother went to Palestine where\nhe died a natural death in 1943 of a heart attack. Haim Yakov is the one who went to Palestine and\nMeir was in France.",
        "Do you have pictures of either of them?",
        "I have pictures of Meir as a baby. No, actually as an adult, too. Come to think of it, yes, there is a\npicture of Meir as an adult, two pictures of Meir as adults. One from Italy and one I'm not sure where\nfrom. He went to Pisa and studied medicine and then he was in Paris. I think he married in Paris but\nI don't think he had children. And I don't know what happened to his wife. I don't know if she was\ndeported or not deported. My father never tried to look her up after the war. And my mother, after\nmy father's death, was suspicious that perhaps Meir's wife wasn't Jewish and that's why my father\nhadn't bothered to look her up after the war because he was in Munich for two and a half years after\nthe war, he could have. And he knew his brother was in Paris. And he found out that his brother had\nbeen deported so he could have presumably investigated his brother's wife but he didn't. That may\nmean that the family was angry that he had married a non-Jewish woman or something like that.\nAnyway Meir's experience as an educated Jew, as an educated person and the fact that Haim Yakov\nwas a devout Zionist, I think indicates that this family, while very religious, clearly had its arms out\nto the modern world, either through Jewish nationalism or through secular education. And it's also\ntrue that my father, although raised as a very religious little boy, as an adult was not religious. As an\nadult in Poland, I don't mean in America after the war, that's something else. But as an adult in Poland\nwas not as religious as he had been growing up. He had a kosher home, he sent his kids to Jewish\nschools, he was very Jewish, but that was normal in Poland. People did that. But he was not that\nobservant a Jew as an adult in the thirties as he had been growing up although his mother remained\nreligious. And I assume some of his siblings were and some weren't. I really don't know. That would\nbe anice question to ask. My cousin in Israel would know all these answers because he was seventeen\nwhen he left and he would have a better sense of who was religious and who was not. Anyway what\nelse can I say about just his family background. His mother had this store. I think several of his\nbrothers were involved in running the store or in, as I said, selling to the peasants. But some of the\nbrothers moved. He himself moved to Warsaw. I think another brother, Simcha moved to Warsaw.\nI'm not sure where his sister Nehama lived when she grew up. I mean they were all adults by the '30s",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "and they were all married and had children and so forth. The only thing I could say I suppose - my\ngrandmother, Masha Markusfeld Rozenblit, I mean \"Markusfeld\" is very important. She was a\nMarkusfeld. Rozenblit was something that accrued to her but she was a Markusfeld. She must have\nbeen a very feisty lady, she sounds like it. She ran this store, she had her six kids which she raised by\nherself, or at least partly. We have a picture of her. She looks like a Jewish woman from Poland but\nshe was kind of a neat lady, I think.",
        "Do you know when she was born?",
        "No, but she was 1n her sixties when she was killed. So that would make her born in the 1880's. Right\nand if my father was born in 1907 that's about right. So she would have been born in the 1880's or\n1870's, probably in the 1870's if he was born in 1907 and he was not her first child, he was her third\nor fourth child. And I think my father's father, Avraham Rozenblit, he was probably in his forties\nwhen he died, in around 1919 say, so that means he was born also in the 1870's. My father, by the\nway, even though he did not have formal higher education or even secondary education, knew a lot\nof languages like many Jews of that part of the world. Yiddish was of course his native language like\nit was for virtually all the Jews of Poland except a small group of hyper-assimilated Jews. But he was\nfluent in Polish and that was common for his generation, that is people who came of age in the twenties\nand thirties knew increasingly also, unless they were just Hasidim, increasingly really knew Polish.\nAnd certainly my cousin, Mutti, the one who moved to Palestine in 1937, '38, Mutti went to Polish\npublic school in the thirties and has very fond memories of his teachers in the Polish elementary\nschool in Lukow, that they were not anti-semitic. I don't know if he's telling the whole truth when he\nsays that, it may be nostalgia. I mean he has unkind words about Poles in general but his teachers\nwere very loving and very nice and he has very fond memories of going to elementary school in Polish\nalthough how deep his Polish language knowledge is, is hard to say, because at this point in the 1990's\nafter living in Israel for fifty odd years he really can speak only Hebrew and Yiddish and English\nwhich he learned in the British army during World War II but his Polish, I think, is so rusty that he\ndidn't use it. But anyway my father knew Yiddish of course which was his mother tongue, Polish\nwhich he spoke totally fluently. He knew Hebrew. Now that's unusual. That would indicate also a\nZionist whatever. Again I don't know. My mother says he knew Hebrew. Now what does that mean.\nShe says, she insisted that he spoke modern Israeli Hebrew, that he could easily speak Hebrew to an\nIsraeli. I don't remember that although we did have an Israeli neighbor in the fifties and my mother\nsays he spoke to her in Hebrew. Now maybe he said three words and my mother thought that meant\nhe......Certainly he had a traditional Chaida education and he was well versed. He wasn't a Talmudist\nbut he knew Hebrew in the way a traditionally educated Jew knew Hebrew. It wasn't rote. He could\nlook at the prayer book or at a bible and understand what it said. He knew Russian. I don't know if\nhe could read or write Russian but he certainly could speak Russian and he knew German. So he\nknew his languages. Okay what else can I say about just childhood. My father was clearly a very\nmischievous little boy because there are several stories that I remember of him directly telling me for\nexample about how they tormented the Malamed at Chaida, how they tormented the teacher at the\ntraditional Jewish school in the Chaida. In fact I remember when I was in Hebrew school as a child",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "he would say to me, Marsha you must never do the things to your teachers that we did, that I did to\nour teachers. And he did all the things you read about in all the Haskala, I mean putting tacks on the\nchair and putting honey on the chair and they just bedeviled the life of the poor teacher, which was\nstandard, standard childhood high-jinx. And the other thing is that his sister, Nehama, who was older\nthan he, probably three or four years older even though she was three children older, his sister Nehama\nwanted a date. World War I was a kind of liberating experience, not the war itself, that was just a\nhorrible experience. In the aftermath of the war things really opened up and social life really changed.\nAnd she wanted to go out on dates but her mother didn't want her to because her mother was still very\ntraditional. And so my father and another one of his brothers would conspire with her to sneak her\nout of the house. And they did this through some kind of closet, some armoire, in Europe they have\nthese closets and apparently they would move it against the window and open the window and open\nthe back of the closet. I don't remember the exact details but I have vivid memories of riding in our\nfamily car in the 1950's with my father telling me stories about how they would trick his mother so\nthat Nehama could go out on a date with probably the man she ended up marrying. But, you know,\nnothing serious. She didn't cover her hair, actually. Pictures we have of her or that I've seen of her\nas an adult, she didn't cover her hair. So clearly this was a family on its way out of religious tradition\nalthough still very deeply connected to things Jewish. So my father, I think, was a very mischievous\nchild. He always had a twinkle in his eyes as an adult, too, so he clearly was the kind....and survivors,\nof course, were often the kind of people who were mischievous sorts. Okay, I think I don't know very\nmuch more about my father's real childhood, that is when he was a baby. If I think of anything I'll\ncome back to it. My father got married pretty young. He got married when he was about twenty or\ntwenty-one to a cousin of his whom he loved very deeply. So this was also non-traditional in a way,\nthat is it was a love marriage, not an arranged one.\nWas it a first cousin?\nYou know I think it was a first cousin. I think she was his first cousin. I'm not a hundred percent\npositive that she was his first cousin but she was definitely his cousin. Her father owned a lumber\nyard in the Warsaw area in a town called Wolomin, which I think is spelled W-O-L-0-M-I-N, I'm not\na hundred percent sure but I think so. It's in the Warsaw area. So he moved to Warsaw, or to\nWolomin, and he ran his father-in-law's business or worked with his father-in-law in running the\nbusiness. His wife though, whose name was either Mira or Perella[224] I don't remember which, his\nwife though died about a week after their first child was born because she had a rheumatic heart and\nshe was warned by doctors not to have any children and she then didn't listen. She wanted a child, it\nwasn't accidental. They weren't that religious and she died very shortly after he was born.\nSo you think she was probably about twenty years old?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "She was probably twenty, twenty-one. I think my father was twenty-one and she was probably the\nsame age or a year younger. She was very young. Their son's name was Avraham. He was named\nafter my father's father. Avraham was born therefore, let's see in 1943 when he was killed, he was\ntwelve. So he was born in 1931. So my father wasn't twenty-one he was twenty-four. Well, whatever.\nThese stories have gotten passed from my mother who was not especially good at dates but I think\nAvraham was born either in 1930 or'31. And his wife died and he was very, very miserable, naturally.\nAnd the family talked him into marrying her sister whose name was either Mira or Perella[236]. In\nother words Mira and Perella|ph] were his wives. I just don't remember which was the first and which\nwas the second. I think Perella[ph] was the second. I think Mira was the first. Again I'm really not a\nhundred percent sure. Again my cousin in Israel would know the answer. And they had another\nchild.",
        "The family talked him into it. Was this under duress then that he did this?",
        "No, I think they talked him into it in the sense that this 1s the smartest and best thing to do. The child\nneeds a mother, what better mother than her sister. She needs a husband, she's a nice lady, why don't\nyou just marry her. You know, I think it was that kind of thing. And he was very depressed and he\nneeded a mother for his child and maybe she was already taking care of the kid. I don't know exactly\nbut he definitely married her. And it was all nght. Obviously it was sad. I didn't know this when I\nwas a child. When I was a child my father was very open and talked a huge amount about his\nholocaust experience and about his life before the war. But for whatever reason, maybe because it\nwas ordinary tragedy rather than the special Jewish tragedy of the holocaust, he didn't tell me about\nthe fact that his first wife had died. He thought that would be too sad for me. Here he was telling me\nabout his son and daughter who had been slaughtered by the Nazis. And that he could tell me about.\nBut the specific tragedy of his own personal life with his wife's death he didn't tell me. I found out\nwhen I was twenty or something. A cousin of his in America was visiting us and she just mentioned\nit casually. I said, what are you talking about? And she told me the whole story and I just bawled. It\nwas very sad that this love of his life died in childbirth. But anyway, he did have a daughter with the\nsecond wife. Her name was Toby. That's what my mother called her. It's probably Tova, which\nagain sounds both modern and Hebraic, Gittel is the Yiddish. Tova 1s already a sign of modernity in\nits modern Jewish form. She was four years younger than Avraham. So she would have been born\nin 1934 or '35, something like that, or '33 depending on exactly when Avraham was born. And my\nfather continued to live in Wolomin with his wife and running this lumber yard. He sent his kids to -\nthere were several Jewish school systems in Poland as you know. There was the Zionist school system\nand the Bundist school system and the \"frumie\", the religious school system and so forth. He sent his\nchildren to a school system that was very much like American Jewish Day schools, that 1s Jewish\nsubjects were taught in Hebrew and secular subjects were taught in Polish which was not the case in\nthe Zionist or Bundist schools where everything was taught either in Hebrew or Yiddish with only a\nminimal amount of Polish. So his children went to this kind of modern Jewish school which means,\nof course, that it was a little bit more religious than both the Zionist or the Bundist schools which\nwould indicate a kind of moderate religious position. So that's the kind of school he sent his kids to.",

Certainly growing up he spoke Yiddish at home, that goes\nwithout saying. What language did he speak as an adult in his family in Wolomin? I don't know. I\nreally don't know if he spoke Yiddish or Polish or both. You know if you're utterly fluent it probably\ndepends on your mood.

I think most Jews\nspoke Yiddish.\nThat would be my guess.\nMy guess would be Yiddish although maybe sometimes Polish depending if the kids came back from\nschool and spoke Polish, then you answered them in Polish and then all of a sudden for an hour you\nwere talking Polish. But then if you stopped talking for a minute and then started talking again you\nprobably would speak Yiddish because Yiddish was the natural thing to speak. After the war in\nAmerica my father was utterly fluent in English. He learned English very quickly and spoke English\nwith my mother who was American born. But with his friends from Lukow who had survived the\nwar, and some of them had as partisans and so on, these friends who were in America, their natural\nlanguage that they spoke was Yiddish although all of them were modern. None of them were\nOrthodox and so forth. The natural language they would speak was Yiddish. But sometimes they\nwould just speak Polish and it would drive my mother crazy because as an American Jew she did\nknow Yiddish but she didn't know Polish. And she would get very angry with them when they spoke\nPolish and the angrier she got the more they would speak Polish to make her angrier because they\nwere very jealous of her because she had parents because she was American and they didn't. The\nthing they had on her was that they could speak more languages and so they would speak Polish. But\nmy guess is that Yiddish would be the language of his home. I don't know what kind of home he\nlived in. He was certainly reasonably prosperous, certainly middle class and definitely in contact with\nhis family in Lukow. He still had brothers and I think his sister was there. His mother certainly was\nthere. Of course he had aunts and uncles and cousins and nieces and nephews. All of his brothers\nand sisters had married. They all had children. He was the closest with his sister. The sibling he\ntalked the very most about was his sister. They were named for the same person. Mendel is a Yiddish\nnickname for Menachem and so technically his name was Menachem Mendel Tzidik[ph312]. I\nshould tell you my father's formal name was Menachem Mendel Tzidik[ph] Rozenblit which would\ntranslate - Tzidik 1s Tzadok, just a Yiddish way of saying Tzadok and Nehama, his sister, who was\ncalled Nechuma|ph3 14], ??raised eyes that she was called Nechuma. Nechuma was obviously named\nfor the same person. She was born first and they named her Nehama to be after whatever relative,",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Menachem. When my father was born they named him after the same relative. So he was very close\nwith his sister and he talked about Meir because Meir was unusual because he was the one who had\nthe secular education and had gone off to study medicine. That was all he talked about with any\nspecificity except in terms of how each of them died in the holocaust and I can tell you about that\nwhen we talk about the war years. I don't know what his wife did. I don't know if his wife worked\nor not. Probably not given the 1930's in Poland and middle class family. I doubt that she worked.\nThey were definitely middle class. This is not somebody making - with nostalgia, hindsight, looking\nback because well maybe this isn't a good historical - forget this. I was going to say I've seen the list\nof property that he presented to the United Restitution Organization as part of his reparations claim.\nIt's the kind of things middle class people have, you know silver and whatever, fur coats and so forth.\nBut you know people could lie on those so that's not necessarily a good source. I think that despite\nthe very terrible situation for Jews in Poland in the 1930's, you know very high anti-semitism and\nvery terrible economy and so forth, that my father did reasonably well. He certainly didn't give any\nthought as far as I know to migrating although there was no place to migrate to except for Palestine.\nAnd he wasn't enough of a Zionist to want to go to Palestine although his brother Haim Yakov did.\nThey had relatives in America like probably every Jew in Poland but America was out of the question\nby the twenties so I think he was perfectly content to be in Poland. In terms of his attitude to Poland\nas a country, actually when he was born, he was born in Russia, and of course the Polish Jews hated\nRussia because they were discriminated against so severely, I think he thought of himself as a Polish\nnational. I think he was a typical Jew in Poland in the sense that his primary identity was as a Jew.\nIf you asked him, who are you, what are you, he would say I am a Jew. But he was Polish, he spoke\nPolish, he identified with the Polish state. He thought of himself as a Polish subject. He used that\nword actually. He called himself a Polish subject which is a funny archaic word which 1s usually used\nfor kingdoms. But that's how Jews were in Poland. They were members of the Polish state but they\nweren't Poles so he would never have said that he was a Pole because he wasn't a Pole, he was a Jew.\nI suppose he was hoping that the Polish Republic would get to be a nicer place than it was. As I said\nI was ten when he died and at ten I didn't ask him such nice interesting political questions as what you\nthought about Poland and how you related to Poland and so on. What else could I tell you about right\nbefore the war?\nThis is good. This is all good and it's what we need.\nhat's what you need. So basically, before the war, on the eve of the war, in 1939, on September 1,\n1939, my father had a business that was reasonably prosperous He lived in a town near Warsaw\ncalled Wolomin. He had a wife; he had two children, a boy and a girl. He had a huge extended\nfamily. He had a very large family, he had a mother and sisters and brothers, nieces and nephews,\naunts and uncles, cousins. He had a large and intact and functioning family. And then the war started.\nSo what happened.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "What happened, okay. You know I'm used to telling the story to my six year old son and of course to\nmy six year old son I have to include what happened during the war. I have to sketch out the war and\nwhat the Nazis did to the Jews and I don't have to do that here. In the first months of the war there\nwas just chaos and all kinds of restrictions against the Jews. I assume that his business was Aryanized\nbecause that's what the Germans did as soon as they came in. They Aryanized businesses giving them\nto ethnic Germans. I assume my father was not compensated for it. He was a clever man. He\nprobably managed to get stuff out of it before 1t was technically Aryanized. In all the stories he talked\nabout the years before he was deported to Auschwitz he never mentioned that he was starving to death\nand he was living in the street or anything like that. Of course he was starving but he wasn't......He\nmust have managed to get something out of his business even though he wasn't compensated for it.\nYou read about this in the memoirs people who with Polish friends manage to make arrangements\nand deals and so forth. But anyway his business was confiscated, his bank accounts frozen, all of\nthose things taken from him. But then, of course, he was in the ghetto. Now when my father was\nalive and he talked about his experiences in the war he always simply said the ghetto. He didn't\nspecify which one. When my mother, who is not a historian and who is not at all good with details\nand in fact was terrible with details, when my mother talked about it for him, after he died, or when I\nwould ask her as I got a little older, well which ghetto, she said the Warsaw ghetto, that he was in the\nWarsaw ghetto. Some of the details of his story very much match the Warsaw ghetto in terms\nof....well the fact is he escaped from the ghetto when it was burning in April 1943. That's the Warsaw\nghetto. What other ghetto was burning in April '43 that you could escape from in some way. But on\nthe other hand, he didn't live in Warsaw. He lived in Wolomin which was close to Warsaw. There\ncould have been a ghetto in Wolomin. On the other hand it was so close to Warsaw that all the people\nmay have been moved to Warsaw. But usually people who had to move into a place did very, very\nbadly. And my father obviously didn't fare badly. I think that he probably was in the Warsaw ghetto.\nHe probably did just simply get moved from Wolomin into Warsaw. Let's say for the purposes of\nthis record that he was in the Warsaw ghetto.",
        "Have you looked up any of the records about Wolomin if they did transfer them at some point?",
        "No, I have never done that. It's funny, I'm a historian and not a genealogist and so I'm interested in\nwhat happened to the Jews and I've never bothered to look up the specifics of my father's experience\nin any systematic way. A lot of his experiences that he described are very, very similar to what you\nread in the memoirs. So it fits in very well. But I never at all tried to ...when I was reading Itzhak\nArrad's[ph415] book about ????[415]Treblinka which is about the operation ???[416] death camps\nwhich basically gassed all of the Jews of Poland and certainly the region he was living in because the\nsection of Poland that both he and his family was in was the general government. The Germans came\nin and annexed the Bartoland|[ph420] and created the general government and the Soviets took the\neastern part of Poland. So my father was in the general government. Anyway when I read that I did\npay attention to see if there was any word about Wolomin. There was description of deportations\nfrom Wolomin but I don't know. There probably are no records of the Wolomin ghetto. In any case,\nfor the sake of argument I say that my father was in the Warsaw ghetto. I think he may have worked",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "for the Jewish Council. He never said that. This is not a memory I have from him or from my mother\nor from my cousin Mutti who wouldn't have know because my cousin Mutti could only give me\ninformation about the pre-war period because he left in 1938. I have a memory from when I was a\nchild of a friend of my father's from Wolomin, a man who had been a worker of his in his lumber\nyard who he was in Auschwitz with and who had also survived and who remained a friend after the\nwar. He's still alive, a man named Shaya May|[ph436]. I think he's still alive. He was alive five years\nago when my mother died because I called him but I assume he's still alive. Shaya[ph] once I\nremember when I was a child, it was right after my father died, too, actually, he was talking to my\nmother about my father during the war. He mentioned something about my father working for that\ntraitorous Council or something like that. A lot of the Jews hated the Council. He was certainly not\na member of the Council, of the 24 hot shots on the Council because I certainly would have come\nacross his name if he were. The Warsaw ghetto Judenhad had seven hundred employees so he may\nhave known someone who knew somebody who got him a job on the Council. So he may have\nworked on the Council. From my memories of all the stories of the ghetto years I don't have any\nsense that he was in terrible shape. Obviously all the Jews had very little food and fuel and so forth.\nThings were very difficult in the ghettoes. But his family was in tact. He had a son and his daughter.\nHis son and daughter attended school. I think his wife taught school in the ghetto. My mother said\nthat. Either she taught school or she taught piano. I think both stories, I remember. So she was\ninvolved in this kind of moral resistance that took place, the organization of clandestine schools, and\nsort of doing normal and cultural and so forth things. I don't think I know very much more about the\nspecific ghetto experience.",
        "So you don't know if they lived with other families or...?",
        "That I just don't know. The only person who might know is Shaya May[ph462] but Shaya never\nwanted to talk about his experiences very much whereas my father talked about it all the time. I\nshould add I have another source about my father's experiences and that is that when he went to school\nin America, when he came to America, the equivalent of \"What I Did on My Summer Vacation,\" he\nhad to write an essay about his experiences. He had to write an essay that described his experiences\nduring the war, I guess, so he wrote. I have part of that essay, part of it is missing. But he just says I\nsuffered terribly and goes on. He doesn't provide specific details about what it was like in the ghetto\nor in the camps. There was also, of course, the testimony that he provided to B..Goodmachen|ph474 |\nfor the reparations claim which my mother typed and of which there is no copy although she swears\nshe made one. She doesn't know what happened to it and she suspects that my father actually\ndestroyed the copy. I don't know why. But the copy just doesn't exist. Most of her memories I\nsuppose come from that formal document that she typed for him. So I don't know if he lived with\nothers or what the situation was. Probably he did, most Jews did, it was a very crowded situation.\nMost of his family, of course, was in Lukow, in the Lukow ghetto although he had a brother in\nWarsaw. Simcha was in Warsaw and Simcha was shot for playing cards after curfew. He was shot\nduring the time of the ghetto. I mean not for playing cards but after playing cards going out in the\nstreet. So Simcha died before the deportations. And he had been in Warsaw because he had moved",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "to Warsaw already in the thirties or twenties or something and I don't know why he had moved or\nwhat he did at all. Again my cousin Mutti would probably know although he may not because since\nhe was in Lukow he didn't really know the War.....he actually knew my father the least well because\nmy father was already in Warsaw. He remembers my father coming home to visit twice or three times\nand giving him a ball or something like that. His stories are really best. From my cousin Mutti in\nIsrael I mostly learned about my grandmother, about Masha Rozenblit, because that was his\ngrandmother, too. Anyway so I really don't know much about the ghetto years except that things were\nokay. His brother was shot but things were reasonably okay. Of course then came the deportations.\nDuring the deportations from the Lukow ghetto, his mother was shot. She was in her sixties and\nrather than take her to Treblinka or Sobibor or wherever they were taking the Jews from Lukow, they\nshot her. Somebody must have witnessed that because how else would he have known, he wasn't in\nLukow. She was shot. I assume the rest of his relatives in Lukow, aunts, uncles, cousins, Shia and\nhis family were probably just deported to wherever Jews from Lukow were deported to and gassed.\nDo you know what year this was, was it '43?",
        "No, well all of Polish Jewry, it's '42. The operation Rhinehart which just simply went methodically\nand liquidated all the ghettoes began something like March of '42 and was over by October '42 with\nsome pockets left. That is there were Jews left in the Warsaw ghetto and in the ....was it the Lublin?\nYeah the Lublin ghetto was made into a labor camp and a couple of other places. There were pockets\nwhere they allowed Jews to still continue. Those were destroyed in '43. I assume that probably all of\nthose relatives were killed in '42 unless by some chance Shia or another one of his brothers was in the\nlabor camp, in the Jeneska Road[ph502] labor camp or Poniyet Tovah[ph504], I forget there were a\nwhole bunch of labor camps in the Lublin area which maybe his brother or one of his nephews because\nif my father's son was already twelve by that time then his older brothers' kids could have been\nteenagers. So maybe they were in.....But I just don't know. I assume that everybody was just killed\nin'42. His sister, Nehama, though, who lived in Lukow with her family, you know I wrote down that\nher name was Pearlman but maybe her name was Bernstein. Yes, her name was Bernstein. Pearlman\nwas my father's wife's maiden name. She and her husband who was much shorter than her, that was\nthe joke of the family, that Nehama who was very tall, I presumably look like Nehama, - when I was\na kid we would go to the Lukow Young Men's Benevolent Association and all the people who had\ncome from my father's town - and people would go, Nehama, Nehama. They looked at me. I don't\nlook like her in the pictures but they thought I looked like her. But anyway she and her family, her\nhusband and her children (she probably had teen-age children) hid in the woods. They somehow\nescaped the ghetto. I don't know if they escaped in '42 or if they escaped earlier but they were hiding\nin the woods near there in the Lublin region. And they were only killed in '44, about three months\nbefore the end of the war in that part of Poland. They were handed over by some Poles to the Nazis\nat that point. So I don't know what happened to them if they were then sent to Auschwitz or if they\nwere shot right away or whatever. But they did succeed in hiding. Nechuma, I should be fair, her\nname was not Nehama, her name was Nechuma. Actually she used a Polish name too, Helenie, she\nused the name Helenie. There are pictures on the back that say Helenie. I think she was the only one",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "that used a Polish name. My father didn't. He used Mendel, his Yiddish name and all the others,\nShia, Meir, they all used their Hebrew names. But she used both, Nechuma and Helenie. But anyway,\nNechuma and her family, that had been hiding for years, at least for two, maybe even more than two,\nwere handed over to the Nazis by some Poles for (as my mother used to say, for a bottle of Vodka).\nThe Poles were given booty for handing over Jews. Now I don't know if these people had just\nhappened upon them and turned them over or if these were people who had been helping them all\nalong and then turned them over, because often people were hiding with the assistance of Poles.\nMaybe it was neighbors, good Poles who were helping them who turned them over, who knows. I\nthink that most of his family, the Lukow branch of the family, his mother and brothers and sisters,\nwell whatever, there's not that many brothers by that time because Simcha and his family were in\nWarsaw and presumably they were deported in 1942. Simcha had been shot earlier for curfew\nviolations but presumably his family was deported in '42 when most of the Jews in Warsaw were\ndeported. In Lukow Haim, his brother Haim Yakov had already gone to Palestine although his family\nhadn't. My father's brother Haim Yakov had gone to Palestine in 1937 alone. His son, Mutti, followed\nhim in 1938 leaving the wife and the other children. So they were all presumably killed also in '42.\nShia was there and his family presumably were all killed and Nehama was there but she was in hiding\nuntil '44 when she was handed over to the Nazis, she and her family were handed over to the Nazis\nand killed and of course Meir was in Paris and he was deported, I assume, again I don't know this, but\nI assume he was deported in July of 1942 when the big raid in Paris took place, July 16 I believe,\n1942, when most Polish Jews in Paris were deported. Now this is not necessarily true. He could have\nescaped to the south and have been picked up at some other time. He definitely was deported to\nAuschwitz because after the war my cousin Mutti in Israel, he was too upset to deal with the issue but\nhis wife, Zeporah, spent months dealing with the Red Cross and the United Nations Relief and\nRehabilitation Agency to track down all the Rozenblit relatives, also her own relatives from her own\nfamily. But her own family was mostly in Palestine because they were all Zionist who'd come mostly\nin the '20s. So she tracked them down and she found my father and she found nobody else. So in fact\nthe first time I saw those letters I wanted to cry because the first letter had to be in English, the Red\nCross would only deal in English. So the first letter to my father that my cousin Mutti wrote to his\nuncle was in English so I could read it easily and my father didn't know English yet but Mutti knew\nEnglish and then of course all subsequent correspondence was just real letters because my father had\na real address and that was all in Yiddish which I could read too but with much more difficulty so I\ndidn't read it quite as easily. But she found nobody else. So I assume obviously she would have\nfound - there were all these organizations after the war, all these Jewish and non-Jewish organizations\ntracking down people. So he was presumably killed either in '42 or '43 or '44, everybody else. And\nNehama definitely in '44. Simcha at some point before '42, everybody else in '42 except for my father\nand his family. In any case assuming that my father was in the Warsaw ghetto, his family was able\nto stay there after that initial depletion of the Warsaw ghetto in August/September of 1942. That\nconfirms that he worked for the Jewish Council actually because the people who stayed in Warsaw,\nthe 70,000 or so that remained after the major liquidation either worked for the Jewish Council or\nwere involved in SS industry, or whatever industry that was working for the German war economy.\nMaybe that lent itself also to them having slightly better food conditions or something like that.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "That's right. Also I think the Wolomin ghetto was simply, I read that in Orad[ph33] the Wolomin\nwas totally destroyed in 1942. So my father I know was in the ghetto until April of 1943. That's\nWarsaw, that April '43 date is so fundamentally Warsaw that he had to have been in the Warsaw\nghetto. In fact he always lit a Yartzeit candle for his children at Pesach because that's around, I mean\nthe Warsaw ghetto was finally liquidated on the second night of Pesach. And they didn't die that\nnight, I'll tell that story in a minute but it was just a few weeks later. So Pesach of 1943, so Pesach is\nwhen he lit a Yartzeit candle for them. Actually he always lit a Yartzeit candle for everybody then.\nI don't know, maybe because he was in Warsaw and that had such an impact on his conscience. His\nmother was probably shot at some point in 1942 not necessarily at Pesach. My father, therefore, and\nhis wife and his children and his wife's sister who was crippled, not totally crippled but she schlepped\na leg for whatever reason, they were together in the ghetto. So he was in the ghetto after that\nliquidation of August/September 1942 when most of the people in the ghetto were liquidated. So he\nwas one of the 70,000 that stayed in the ghetto until April of '43 when the Nazis decided on the final\nliquidation of the ghetto. Now my father in 1943, he was born in 1907, so in 1943 he was 36. Well\nhe wasn't yet because his birthday is November, so he was 35 years old. And he had a twelve year\nold son and an eight year old daughter and a wife and a sister-in-law. And they decided to escape\nfrom the burning ghetto. Because of the uprising the Nazis sort of bombed the ghetto and sent in fire\nbombs and so forth and basically burned the ghetto down. And my father and his family decided to\nescape from the ghetto. I don't know if that means they went through the sewers or not. In Warsaw\nthat's how people escaped from the ghetto. This is where he really told. My father told the stories\nfrom the escape from the Warsaw ghetto until liberation. That's what he told. The ghetto experience\ndidn't interest him. That must mean that it was not too terrible. My image of hearing the story as a\nchild was that they escaped into the woods. But there are no woods around the Warsaw ghetto or\naround Warsaw even for that matter. So I don't know how they escaped, presumably they did it\nthrough the sewers. But in any case they escaped. Oh, I do know, my mother I think told me this that\nhe did make attempts through Polish, non-Jewish friends to get his children to be taken by non-Jews.\nYou know pretend to be non Jews. And nobody would do it. He was unable to get anybody to agree\nto do that. So anyway there he was with his twelve year old, his eight year, his wife and his sister-in-\nlaw and they escaped and somehow they made it to some woods, or maybe not to some woods, they\nwere just out. They had a kind of pact that if one of them should get lost, they would not look for that\nperson because that could be problematic and instead if one of them should get lost, they should go\nto a farm house that they knew which was some distance away, my memory is 90 kilometers but I\nwas a little kid when I heard this so I don't know where it was. Somehow Avraham, my father's son,\nwho by the way was not called Avraham, that's my way of Hebraisizing it again, it's Avremy, the\nYiddish nickname for Abraham. Avremy who was twelve somehow got lost, he wasn't there. My\nfather's wife said that she had to go look for Avremy and my father said, no. We'll lose you if you do\nthat. We have to stick together and go to the farm house. We'll find Avremy at the farm house. And\nshe just was mad with concern for her son who's not even technically her son but she had raised him\nhis whole life so he was her son. And she went to look for him and they never saw her again. I\nassume that means she was picked up by SS soldiers and by the SS and taken directly to Auschwitz\nwhich at that point was the only, by 1943 -- oh maybe not Auschwitz, maybe she was taken to\nTreblinka , I don't know where she was taken to but she was presumably killed. But my father and",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "his daughter and his sister-in-law did go to this farm house and they found Avremy there without his\nshoes, a Polish farmer had taken them, probably he needed them, probably he thought that Avremy\nwould be killed soon anyway, what did he need shoes for. Who knows why he took them, but he\ntook them. This is April of '43, my father, Avremy, Toby, and Tova whatever, and his sister-in-law\nwhose name I don't know and then they were arrested, they were found. I mean it was very hard to\nreally escape especially since the Poles were so hostile and the Nazis were so eager to find them. And\nhe was taken to Auschwitz. They were taken to Auschwitz. Of course my father was 35, and the rest\nof them were not 35, they were twelve, eight, and I don't know how old his sister-in-law was,\npresumably in her thirties too but she was crippled. And she was as if the mother of these children.\nShe was an adult female with two children. And so when they got to Auschwitz, he was sent to the\nleft or the right, whichever way. He was sent to do slave labor and they were sent the other way which\nmeans that they were gassed. So in April of 1943 his son and daughter and sister-in-law were killed\nby the Nazis. But he was in Auschwitz and he was a slave laborer in Auschwitz for a long time. He\nworked in Auschwitz and he would talk about his experiences quite a lot. He talked about how awful\nit was although I must say that he did not dwell on how awful it was. My father talked about his\nexperience in the camps a lot. Saturday nights when we would have company, in the 1950s if you\nwere a Jewish family in Brooklyn you would have bagels and lox for dinner, and we would have\nbagels and lox and herring and so on and company and he would talk. People would say Mark what\nwas it like. And he would talk. And I just remember Saturday nights in my childhood hearing my\nfather talk about this. And when he talked about it he did not talk about the horrors so much. He\ncertainly made it very clear that it was so horrific that you could not even imagine it. And in fact\nwhen people would be nasty, nasty is the wrong word, but you know how Americans could be\npresumptuous and they would say, how could you have done such a thing? Like my father would say\nwe found a rat and we ate it or something. And they'd say, ooh how could you eat a rat? It's not really\nnasty. And he would say, you shouldn't talk, you don't know what it's like to be in a fire. I remember\nthat expression, you don't know what it's like to be 1n a fire. But he wouldn't dwell on how awful it\nwas except to indicate that it was unbearably awful and constant beatings and starvation and filth and\ndirt and crowded and disgusting. He indicated that but that's not what he dwelled on. What he dwelled\non instead in his talking about it was the things that people did to survive and the things that people\ndid to help each other survive. The image that I had as a child of what it was like in the camps was\nunbearable sadism and cruelty on the part of the Nazis but the inmates being human, working to do\nthings that would make themselves survive and things that human beings do. I don't mean that human\nbeings are pigs and do horrible things, but in the good sense of being human, that is of helping each\nother and working together to try to survive, and so forth. For example he always spoke about what\nthe memoirs all talked about, that is the whole business of organization, the whole network through\nwhich people bargained and traded and bartered and traded their bread for other things. He talked all\nthe time of 1t how it was crucial to trade your bread for soap, or to trade your bread for an onion or\nfor garlic or something and soap so you could clean yourself. Onions or garlic so you could get\nvitamins. All of that which I've read in umpteen memoirs but he talked about that all the time, about\nthe need to trade. Of course the whole network depended on pilfering from Nazi stewards and from\nthe suitcases of people who came in to be gassed. So he talked about that a lot. He didn't use the\nword organization as far as I remember but maybe he did and I just don't remember. But he talked\nabout that you really needed to do that. He also talked, in fact more importantly than this whole",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "organization business, he talked about holding on to the will to live. My most vivid memory I have\nfrom childhood, the most single vivid memory of my own childhood is my father talking about\nholding on to the will to live. And that the only way you could survive such a horrible place was to\nhold on to the will to live and that's how you did it, you just held on to the will to live. Like literally\nheld on to it. And every second said, I'm going to live, I'm going to live, I'm going to live. I just\nremember that vividly. I don't remember what he said how you did it, how you held on to the will to\nlive or what strategies he used to hold on to the will to live, which I read about in memoirs, thinking\nabout the past, thinking about the future, thinking about this, whatever. There are different strategies\nthat people used. That I don't remember, his own personal strategies. But I do remember him talking\nabout that - holding on to the will to live. I also remember that of course it made him lose all faith in\nGod. Actually I don't remember that, I take that back. He did lose all faith in God. But that he didn't\ntell me about. My mother told me about that when I was older. He didn't want me to know that\nbecause he didn't think that was fair to me. He thought that I was a child and not know that he didn't\nbelieve in God as a result of Auschwitz. And he didn't believe in God because his children had been\nkilled and everybody's children had been killed not just his. That didn't stop him from wanting to\nhave a kosher home or from going to shool all the time. He didn't stop being a Jew, you know what\nImean? Well actually he did stop going to shool until I was born. From the time the war ended until\nI was born he would not go into a shool, he would not do anything religious. He would not go to a\nPassover seder, he would not do anything religious. No that's not true. He would go to a Passover\nseder. I think that was the only religious thing he would do but he would not go to shool. When I\nwas born he didn't even think about it. He went to shool to name me. He was a Jew. That's what\neastern European Jewry was like. You were a Jew. You did things because you were a Jew. Jews\nnamed their daughters in shool. The angel of death might kill your daughter if you didn't do that.\nYou know, you had to. Just because you didn't believe in God didn't mean that you didn't name your\ndaughter in shool. And that broke the ice and he went to shool all the time. He loved to go to shool.\nHe absolutely loved to go to shool. He didn't go every week, he wasn't religious. But he went at least\nonce amonth. He really loved to go to shool. In fact he even wanted me to go to a Jewish day school\nbut my mother didn't want me to go because we weren't that religious and in those days it was just\northodox schools. Getting back to his experiences, I don't remember that he talked about how he lost\nhis faith in God but that was a central experience that he had in the camps, the loss of faith.",
        "Do you remember any discussion of any specific episodes or incidents that he might have told you or\nother people?",
        "No, I don't remember anything specific from the camps except the business of trading bread for soap\nwhich is not a specific incident; I'm sure he did it more than once and the business of holding on to\nthe will to live and the sense of how unbearable it was. I think in his testimony for reparations he did\nprovide some specific instances. But my mother, who unfortunately was terrible at details didn't\nremember them and had lost the carbon copy. I'm sure he was beaten mercilessly many times as was\neverybody, I mean he wasn't singled out. I'm sure there were but I really don't unfortunately know\nany very specific thing.

I'm a historian concerned with detail and she wasn't. And my father died when I was\nyoung. So I'm bringing all these memories of sitting around our table listening so I can think of\nsomething very specific.",
        "If you don't have it that's okay too.",
        "I remember that he would be annoyed with people who presumed - like if he would discuss - in the\nWarsaw ghetto for example he would say how it was wonderful when a horse would die and they\nwould just eat the horse meat and people would say, horse, how could you eat horse, and he would\nsay, lady, you haven't been through a fire, you don't know. People were in awe of my father. He was\na very intelligent man and they would sit there sort of enthralled with his stories. I don't remember a\nspecific incident unless as I keep on talking I'll come to something. I don't remember anything\nspecific. I do know that he was in Auschwitz from April of '43 until January of '45 when the Russians\n- so in terms of your dates through 1944 he was in Auschwitz. In January of 1945 as you know the\nRussians came very close to Auschwitz. Knowing that the Russians were going to be there any minute\nthe Nazis evacuated the camp and in the famous death march that Elie Wiesel and millions of other -\nIsabella Leitner - millions of other people described - marched off people to Germany. And my father\nwas part of that death march. I remember him describing that a little bit in more detail than the camps.\nI remember him saying that it was very cold. It was January, it was winter, and they didn't have boots\nand they didn't have coats. Two-thirds of the people died. And I remember him saying that you\ncouldn't fall asleep because if you let yourself fall asleep you would die. The snow was deceptive.\nYou think that it's warm when you're in it and so you could fall asleep. And then of course you freeze\nto death because 1n fact it's not warm it's cold. So you never should go to sleep in the snow. And I\nremember him saying that that they would force each other to stay awake. In some of the memoirs\nI've read about how they were put in barns, my father never talked about that. He just talked about\nthe snow and how people straggled, they would be shot of course and the Nazis would beat people\nup. The Nazis were very nervous of course at this point. He was taken to Dachau. Other people went\nother places. They were in Bergen-Belsen, Buchenwald. They were all taken to concentration camps\nin Germany. He personally was taken to Dachau where he spent the next few months. I don't know\nhow long it actually took him to get from Auschwitz to Dachau. In some of the memoirs you read\nhow that part of the way they were on trains and trucks and so forth. My father never said that. He\njust said the death march. He called it the death march and he said they took us to Dachau. So he\nwas in Dachau for a few months and he was liberated by the Americans in April of 1945. And I have\na couple of little stories that I remember of the actual liberation. Not of the moment of liberation\nalthough I have a wonderful story from somebody else of the actual moment but I won't put this in\nmy father's record. It's one of those classic stories, the other story of how this person got out of\nDachau. The Nazis left the camp before the Americans got there and he was wandering around the\nstreets and was almost shot by some American soldiers but he spoke Yiddish to them and one of them",

        "happened to be Jewish and so forth. That's not my father's story. Right after liberation he and Shia,\nthis person who had been his employee in Wolomin before the war and had been in Auschwitz with\nhim, and had been in the orchestra in Auschwitz actually, my father was just a laborer in Auschwitz\nbut Shia was in the orchestra and they were in the death march together and so forth. And after the\nwar they were walking around and Shia picked up a rotten potato from the street that he saw and my\nfather said what are you doing that for because now we have food. And Shia was still too scared that\nthere would be no food. But that again is not my father's story because that's not what he did. He of\ncourse was nothing at the end of the war. He was utterly emaciated and utterly depleted. My mother\nused to say he weighed fifty pounds at the end of the war. I can't believe that. But he must have\nweighed seventy or eighty. My mother was also an exaggerator a little bit. But I bet he weighed\nseventy pounds at the end of the war. He was not a huge man anyway, he was probably about five\nnine. He was broad but thin.\nHe must have been strong to have survived all the labor and all.\nYeah. He was actually old to survive. Most of the survivors were teenagers, which is why they're\nstill alive. My father if he were alive would be in his eighties. I mean he happened to die when he\nwas young. He happened to die when he was fifty-three but even if he hadn't died and if he were still\nalive the man would be eighty-four years old. No, that's not nght. Yes, he would be eighty-five on\nhis next birthday. Whereas most of the survivors that you talk to I'm sure are in their seventies because\nthey were teen-agers or in their early twenties during the war. My father was a very old survivor,\nvery unusual, he must have been extraordinarily strong. It's funny to say that somebody in their mid-\nthirties would already no longer be at the height of their physical strength but it's true. So it's just\namazing that he lived. But anyway he was liberated by the Americans. He did not go to a DP camp\nwhich was the standard experience but rather he went to work for the United Nations Relief and\nRestitution Agency and his job for them was to help people find housing. He must have learned\nEnglish working for them or before but he lived in an apartment in Munich. He had a real apartment\nand had a real job and sort of went about his business. I assume for a few months, I mean I assume\nthat immediately after the war he was, it took months to recuperate. In fact he said that it was months\nbefore he felt like a human being again. I do know that most of his teeth had rotted during the war\nand that one of the first things he did when he had some modicum of strength was he just walked\naround the streets of Munich and looked for a dentist. He found a dentist, walked in, asked the dentist\nto pull whatever was left and to give him false teeth. The dentist wanted to give him anesthesia for\nthe pulling and he said, no need. He was so into pain that it didn't matter. And the German dentist\ndidn't charge him because my father had a number, he had been in Auschwitz. He just showed his\nnumber. In fact in those days you just showed your number and you got anything. He didn't pay for\ntoo much after the war. The apartment I think was also free.\nI was wondering about that because I talked to a number of people and they said well we just lived\nthere. And I said how did you get food. Well, we got food.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Well if they were in a DP camp they got food from the UN.\nNo, I mean in cities.\nBut if they lived in cities - well my father worked, I mean my father had a real job, but before that he\ndidn't have the job from the first minute, I think 1t was not a problem.\nThere was guilt.\nYeah, although the Germans didn't have any food. They must have been given food by the American\narmy of occupation. He must have just been given it. I don't know that. I know somebody who\nstudies the DP camps, she might know. Anyway, so he wasn't ina DP camp. I assume he stayed in\nDachau because that's what they did. They set up barracks and gave people food and medicine and\nlet them come to themselves. We have pictures of my father right after the war, not right, right after\nthe war but in '46 where he looks fine. He had obviously regained his strength and so forth. But so\nhe lived and worked for UNRRA and he did have housing and he had a German, non-Jewish girlfriend\nwho he lived with which is very weird. And she knew Yiddish which 1s very weird.\nI heard of some southern Germans who know Yiddish actually.\nWell, yeah, she was a Bavarian. She was a beautiful woman. Her name was Lisa, well probably\nElizabeth, but Lisa was her nickname. Just a beautiful woman. Her husband had been a soldier\nprobably and he probably had been killed and she was probably lonely and my father had access to\nfood and people were starving. She wanted to marry him actually and he couldn't do that. To live\nwith her is one thing, to sleep with a shiksa is one thing; to marry a shiksa after you just.....1 remember\nhim saying he used to have dreams. His mother would come and beat him up in his dreams. The\nvery idea that he would even think of marrying a shiksa was - a German shiksa no else. Well, I mean\nfrom my grandmother's point of view a shiksa is a shiksa, it doesn't matter what kind. But the fact\nthat she was also a German shiksa didn't really help. I'll show you her picture. She was gorgeous,\njust beautiful. I have this huge urge to look her up although she's probably eighty-five years old, too.\nI mean at the end of the war how old was my father? In 1947 he was forty right. And she may have\nbeen ten years younger so she would only be in her mid-seventies at this time. I don't know her name.\nI think it would be interesting to learn something about her.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "I don't know her name. Her name is Lisa. I don't know her last name. Although actually some of\nmy father's Lukower friends, that is the friends from the town that he met again in America, they\nmight know her name because she lived with him. All these pictures of my father and his other\nsurvivor friends in Germany after the war. There she is, she's with them. My father did know German\nthough, he probably did speak to her in German. Anyway, so he lived in Germany and had this job,\njoined the Zionist organization and stuff and then in December of 1947 he came to the United States.\nThat was right after Congress passed that emergency legislation allowing in 100,000 victims of Nazi\npersecution. I guess because he worked for UNRRA he was able more easily than others to get an\nearly seat in that. And he came to the United States in December of 1947 leaving Lisa behind in\nMunich. I don't think he ever had any contact with her again. Maybe initially he did but not for very\nlong. He got himself a job very quickly. It was the only job he ever had in America. He actually\nlived with a Lukower. He lived with Mrs. Feldman who had moved to America God knows when.\nBut her son, Muttel, who was my father's friend in Europe and had survived the war also, and was my\nfather's friend in Germany, he lived with his mother, Mrs. Feldman. Muttel came later to America,\ntoo. But he lived with Mrs. Feldman. He wandered around lower Manhattan looking for a job, got a\njob right away for a company called Civikoppen Minor[ph304] which did store fixtures, you know\nthe furniture that's inside stores. And he worked both as a carpenter - he knew how to work with\nwood, he owned a lumber yard, and he also was very handy, actually more than handy. He was\ntalented with his hands. He could build beautiful things and so on. So he got a job there, initially I\nguess just as a carpenter since he didn't - I don't know, whatever - but he also worked for them\nsupervising job installations. When they did Bambergers in New Jersey, he went out to Bambergers\nand made sure the job was done right. And what he wanted more than anything was to save up enough\nmoney to open some kind of business. He was an entrepreneur by nature and that's what he wanted\nto do. He died before he could do that. But that's what he wanted to do. So he got a job right away,\nI mean he probably got a job three days - oh actually I have a funny story to tell. I know you're mostly\ninterested in the holocaust but I love this story. When he came to America he was met at the boat by\nhis aunt, Judith Marcus, Marcusfeld shortened to Marcus. Actually she was an aunt-in-law. She was\nhis mother's brother's wife. His mother's brother had died. They had come to America probably\nbefore World War I and had shortened the name to Marcus to make 1t more American. Anyway his\nuncle was dead but Judith Marcus met him at the boat and she said to him, today I'll speak to you in\nYiddish, tomorrow only English. You're now in America, you have to speak English. Presumably\nhe knew some English because he worked for UNRRA. Today I will call you Mendel, but from now\non you have to have an American name and your name is Mark. She gave him a name that was\ncommon in America. In 1947 Mark was a common name. So in fact, when he became a citizen in\n1951 he changed his name to Mark. So in America he was Mark Rozenblit, although my mother\ncalled him alternate....she called him Mark most of the time, but she called him Mendel when she was\nbeing affectionate because that was his name. Mendel was his name. He was forty-four years old\nwhen he changed his name to Mark. Although he used it, it was his American name. My cousins\ncalled him Uncle Mark and my uncle called him - I mean everybody called him Mark. Anyway, he\ncame to America, was met by his aunt, he got a job, and he met my mother a year and a half later in\nJune of 1949 and they got married in November of 1949 and they had me in October of 1950. The\nrest is history. He adjusted extremely well to America. He loved America. He felt utterly happy to",

        "be American. He had an American wife which is unusual for survivors. He didn't feel the need to be\n--- of course he was friends with all the people who survived from his town. My mother hated them.\nThey were a bunch of people who survived from this town. Actually a very large number considering\nhow tiny the town was. Virtually all of them had been in the Partisans, except for Muttel. I think\nMuttel had been in the camps. Everybody else, I forget all their names now, Frimmet. God, Frimmet,\nFrimmet and Dave Rosen. They're so unlikely to have been in the Partisans, it's amazing. And\nChayetta whose son looked like somebody else, not her husband. There's this whole sort of crew of\npeople that I grew up with. Those people, I haven't seen them in a hundred years.\nBut they all ended up in New York?\nThey all ended up in New York, all the survivors. There were probably eight of them; it's not like\nthere were hundreds of them. But there were some of them. Some of them actually subsequently\nmoved to Israel. In the 50's and 60's they lived in America and 70's and some of them retired to Israel.\nWell Frimmet and her husband and the Feldmans, Muttel and Fanny moved to Israel. But I think\nLola and her husband, I forget his name, they still live in America, in New York. I mean, unless\nthey're dead, I haven't spoken to these people in a hundred years, a hundred years, but a long time.\nSo my father adjusted very, very well to life in America. He really did. He didn't want to have\nchildren because he lost two. He had one because he thought it wasn't fair to my mother to impose\nthat on her but he wouldn't have any others because it was too much of a risk that you could lose your\nchildren. In a way I replaced his daughter; his son he mourned for continuously. He had nightmares\nall the time, all the time my mother said. I don't remember that. That was from my mother. He was\nin his daily life in America, fine. He joked and laughed and was successful. I mean not successful in\nthe huge sense but he had a job and worked and made a living and he was saving money for a business\nand he had an American family. I remember my father being loving and warm and it was fine in his\nwaking consciousness but of course he was racked by nightmares. He missed his son profoundly. He\nwas in excruciating pain at a bar mitzvah. He had a very hard time at bar mitzvahs because his son\ndied just before his own. The loss of his children was really unbearable to him. The loss of everyone\nelse he could handle but the loss of his children was unbearable to him.\nThat must have been a big responsibility for you really to have that position.\nI felt 1t an honor. I felt very privileged. I felt very special as a child. I felt that I was privy, very close\nto this horrible thing that had happened to the Jewish people and therefore that I understood it better\nthan others. I felt honored. I felt terrible for my father and the family and so forth. But I felt very\nspecial. I felt responsible, yes, but not in the negative sense of wishing that I didn't have a burden but\nin the positive sense of feeling that I had a special responsibility to bear the information and the pain\nof it. I knew lots of other people in the same situation though because although my mother was\nAmerican and therefore all the family that I had was American, that is her family, we knew a lot of",

        "survivors. Both because of the Lukower, all of these people who had survived, but also because in\nBrooklyn in the fifties when I was growing up there were survivors. There were lots of survivors. I\nhad friends whose parents were survivors. Not all my friends, certainly. In fact probably most of my\nfriends didn't have survivor parents but Elaine and Esther\nRosenberg's parents were survivors and whatever, I don't have to name all the names. But there were\nplenty of other survivors around so it was not an unusual or weird thing at all. But yes I did feel a\nresponsibility, a very great responsibility, probably\nmagnified by the fact that he died when I was ten years old. I remember, my father always talked\nabout it, I do not remember a time in my life when I did not know about the holocaust. We didn't call\nit the holocaust, of course, we called it the war, or the camps, or the Nazis, whatever. So I don't\nremember not knowing about it. I always knew about it. But I do remember the first time I saw\npictures. There was a series of pictures prepared by the American army for Germans so they would\nknow how horrible the camps were. And my father had a set. In the back it said \"Zo vais in\nDachau\"[ph418]. So it was in Dachau. It was horrific pictures. You know those really gross\nconcentration camp pictures from the end of the war when things were even worse, because there\nwere bodies lying all over the place and so forth. And I remember I was eleven years old when I\ncame across those pictures and I vomited. I remember that very vividly. I mean this wasn't a picture\nof my father, of course, my father was alive. Not then, he was already dead. Yeah, I felt this great\nresponsibility because of it, absolutely. Anyway what else would you like to know about the whole\nthing.\nI think that should probably cover it.\nAs much as you guys need, right.\nYeah. If there's anything else that you feel you want to include for the sake of this interview and have\nit in the museum we can turn off the tape and if you think about it, you can tell me.\nYeah, I'm just trying to think. You know of course I'm not the survivor so I can't give you the details\nthat your survivors are giving you. My father also did die when I was ten which means that I didn't\nget a chance to question him and whatever. My cousin in Israel could only provide information about\nPoland before the war. My mother was bad at detail. So it's a hard thing. Let me just think of a few\nother things randomly. My father taught me not to hate all Germans because of the Nazis. He thought\nthe Nazis were evil but he didn't hate all Germans. I mean I think the fact that he had a non Jewish\nGerman girlfriend 1s a sign of that. He taught me that. He taught me that I had to distinguish between\npeople. Nazis were evil but not all Germans were evil. I probably did get the sense that all Poles\nwere anti-semitic in my childhood. That is, I think Polish Jewry in general thought that although no,\nno although. That was the sense I probably got. I got the sense that obviously most people were",

        "killed but that those who survived did so not because they were awful people. I mean there was this\nnotion in certain circles especially in the fifties that the people who survived had been vicious and\nhorrible and mean and had killed each other and been dog eat dog. From my father I learned that you\nsurvived because you were clever. You held on to the will to live so you were strong psychologically.\nYou were clever. You figured things out. You were lucky, gutsy. That's what made you live, not\nbeing underhanded and mean but being tough and strong. In fact I had a wonderful experience. I\nwent to the first international gathering of holocaust survivors in Israel in 1981 and I in fact gave a\npaper on it. I gave a paper on teaching the holocaust at the university level. But I went to not all the\nsessions but many of the sessions. I went to the final session which was held at the kotel, at the wall,\nwhen there were speeches. Menachem Begin spoke and Teddy Kollack spoke, everybody spoke,\nmillions of speakers, all in English, really weird. But anyway English was the common language\nbecause there were French survivors and whatever. Anyway so I went to it and it got real cold. It\nwas at night in Jerusalem in the summer and I was wearing a jacket and I was feeling very cold.\nBegin, maybe he wasn't the very last speaker, but he was one of the last speakers and he was going\non and on endlessly. Everybody else had spoken for two minutes because there were hundreds of\nspeakers. He was going on. He was already prime minister. He was going on and on and he was\nreally being nasty. He was exhorting the crowd that if they didn't live in Israel they were traitors to\nthe Jewish people. It was a really not nice, disgusting speech. Half the crowd started to leave. They\njust started to leave. They picked themselves up and they walked. My American side, that is my\nProtestant side, I mean I'm not a Protestant but you know what I mean, the American side that you\njust stand on line whatever, was appalled that they would do that. Because, after all, even you hate\nhim, even if you think he's saying awful things, and I certainly don't agree with Menachem Begin\npolitically and I thought what he was saying was awful. But still he's the Prime Minister of a country.\nYou don't get up and leave in the middle of his speech. It's just not nice even if you're cold and even\nif you're unhappy you don't do it. And so I was really annoyed. My sort of American side that hates\nwhen people cheat on line was getting very angry. And then all of a sudden like I had this revelation,\nwait a second, that's why they survived. They just do what seems to them the right thing to do. And\nthen I loved them because I remembered all these survivors from my childhood. My father's dead for\na long time and I've moved away from that world and I just loved them and I wanted to kiss all of\nthem. I didn't leave because I'm not them. But they left because that's why they not only survived\nbut they also succeeded after the war in returning to normal life. The vast majority of the survivors\nare normal, functioning human beings. Even if they're a bit neurotic, even if they scream a little too\nmuch, even if they have more fears than your average person, even if they are way more over-\nprotective of their children than your average person, even all of those things and even if their children\nsay oh my parents were such crazy people, they are functioning human beings, they are not lunatics.\nAnd the ones who are were lunatics anyway. The ones who are were lunatics before the war. This\nhad a searing and traumatic and devastating effect on them but they function as human beings,\nsuccessful ones for the most part. There are lots of successful business people, successful\nprofessionals. All the survivors I know as children all of them made it. Even if they were just laborers,\nthey still went to work in the morning and they still provided for their families. They were fine, they\nwere really fine; crazy but crazy in a way that's understandable. But anyway so I love them all because\nthey are what they are. They survived because they have the courage to do what feels right at the\nmoment instinctively. I don't know if there's anything else I can say at all. This is not about my",

They spoke Yiddish when they didn't want me to\nunderstand which was enough so that I did understand Yiddish. He was fiercely proud of being\nJewish even if he wouldn't fast on Yom Kippur because he didn't believe in God anymore and he'd\ngone hungry long enough. But I didn't know he didn't fast on Yom Kippur. He didn't want me to\nknow that because....[ mean I'm sure he would have told me if I was older, but I was little. I think\nthat's all I have to say, at least now. If I think of something in the next ten minutes we can always add\nit.\nOkay. I want to thank you very much for your time and for this interesting story.\nYou're welcome, you're welcome. Let me add just one last thing. I know this is not going to go into\nthe cards that you're doing but somehow the transcripts of these will be saved.\nYes they will.\nSo I'll just say it. My son is named for my father. I'm named for my father's mother and he's named\nfor my father. And so therefore we have Masha and a Mark and a Marsha and a Mark and it's very\nnice. And he really feels connected to my father and to the holocaust. He has also always known\nabout it and you asked me if I feel a sense of responsibility and I do. I feel it both in my professional\nlife and in my personal life. And I'm very pleased that I was able to tell my son about the holocaust\nin a way like I learned about it, in a very personal way, in a way that emphasizes the goodness in all\nhuman beings but it also emphasizes that we should be careful about the evil that human beings are\ncapable of and I feel that as a child of a holocaust survivor that I have a moral obligation to purvey\nthey meaning of the holocaust to the next generation and I'm glad I was able to do it with my own\nson. A lot of children of holocaust survivors are worried how they will do it and I think it can be done\neasily, so thank you for interviewing me.\nThank you.\nI have one more thing to add, I just remembered. When the Nazis occupied Poland in 1939, my\nfather's wife said to him, escape to the Russian zone, you can do that for a couple of months in\nSeptember, October, November of 1939; you go escape. After all the Germans won't hurt women\nand children but they might hurt men. And my father said well it's true the Germans certainly won't\nhurt women and children because after all his memories, like most Polish Jews, his memories of\nWorld War I, were that the Russians were the horrible creeps but when the German army came and\noccupied Poland the situation of the Jews improved. The Germans were civilized and nice and so",

So he had a sense that the Germans wouldn't be so bad but he didn't want to go to the east\nbecause he thought that the Russians would be very barbaric and he didn't want to go to the east. He\nsaid the Germans are more civilized than the Russians. I will take my chances with the Germans and\nI don't want to leave my family alone and so forth. So the image of the German was this positive one\nwhich of course worked to the detriment of lots of Polish Jews. That's all I wanted to add..\nThanks.\nYou're welcome.\nMy father understood that Hitler was a maniac and that the Nazis were evil and that they were doing\nterrible things to the Jews. He understood that. He just thought that ultimately German decency\nwould prevail whereas the Russians were absolutely repulsive and that it was at best to stay at home\nwith family and take one's chances with these Germans than go off to Russia. Okay.\nwhole world. I just found out, after the liberation, that the whole world stood idly by and watched the\nannihilation of the Jewish people, men, women and child, concentration camps, gas chambers,\nwagons with gas and no one lifted a finger or a warning, even, to the Germans, to stop the killing. So\nin 1940, I believe it was, my entire family along with the rest of the town Jewry were corralled into a\nghetto. In 1941, I believe it was in the summer, I, together with many other young Jews were taken\nout of the ghetto and deported to the slave labor camp near Poznan. The name of the camp was\nBuchvardelfost (ph)(c.56). In the interim, my entire family along with the rest of the Praszka Jewish\nghetto were driven to their execution. All of them perished at the hand of the German tormentors in\nthe death camps of Hamunull (ph)(53). After workinginB __, preparing the Reichousband (c.55),\nwe called at that time, it mean the super-highway for the Germans, working there almost two years.\nThen I was transferred to different labor-torture camps in Germany. Finally it was now 1943, I was\nbrought to the frightening extermination camp of Auschwitz. There I was robbed of my name, my\nexistence as a Jew and a human being ceased. I became number 141938 which was brutally burned\ninto my arm and 1s still visible today. I became one of the damned and stampeded Jews whose only\npath led to the crematorium and gas chamber. I can still see and feel the many chimneys of the camp\nbelching forth the heavy dark smoke. A stink so old and permeating that it pursues me to this very\nday and is still too agonizing to recall. After a few months in confinement, in Auschwitz with the\nthreat of death hanging over my head every day, whether it was by the cruel beatings, hard labor, I\nwas suddenly transferred to another slave-labor in the concentration camp of Lagisza.\nWhere is that?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Lagisza was six kilometers before Benjun (c.82) where we built for the Germans, electricity station.\nAs was the case with most of the Jews and under this circumstances, we experienced unbearable pain\nbecause of hunger, suffering, and degredation and hard work. Just to describe to you one day of food\nin acamp where we worked from six in the morning to six in the evening. When you received going\nout to work in the morning, a black coffee, so-called coffee and with this you had to go out to work.\nIn the afternoon, during lunch, we supposed to have gotten a soup and it was many days where it did\nnot reach us. Whether it was spilled during the way by other prisoners carrying it or it was available.\nWe came home from work, we received one piece of bread. I would say in the size of the--today two\nslices of bread and again a soup. It was the hardest decision of my life, what to eat first.\nWhy is that?\nIt was, if you will eat up the soup with the bread, you have nothing in the morning--for the morning\nwhen you go out to work left over. So most of us, most of the concentration camp inmates, were\ntrying to ration ourselves. We ate the little soup at night and we tried, we tried to hold on to this piece\nof bread until the morning to have it with the coffee. But hunger, the hunger was stronger than the\nresistance not to eat. So you started to nibble a piece now, put it in your pocket, didn't last, the hunger\nwas so great. I think this 1s the greatest pain that a human can have, this hunger pain. So you take\nanother out another piece and you nibble again until you nibble and you nibble till you have nothing\nleft no more.\nWere you ever able to --?\nAnd at night, you feel guilty again that you ate it cause you're not going to have it in the morning.\nWere you ever able to preserve it until the morning, yourself?\nVery seldom, very seldom. It was only through certain circumstances when I got a little extra that I\ncould preserve a piece for the morning. This is another story by itself. When, under what\ncircumstances, sometimes a person got a little extra food, something to eat. This was, I think, looking\nback in retrospect, decisions what we making today in life, is nothing compared to the decision when\nto eat a piece of bread. It seems I left it like this in this camp till 1944. In 1945, from 1945 to January,\n19--, no from 1944 also, in September till January '45, I was sent to another camp by the name of\nYavozna.\nAre you able to spell that?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Yeah, V , yeah. The name of the camp, how did they spell it? Y-a-v-o-z-h-n-a. Some of the\npeople were working there in the coal mines. I managed to work again on the outside, again at another\nelectrical company. Another company that (150) for electricity. Because I had already\nexperience in that work, therefore they choose me to go there. My second thought was, I was afraid\nto go down in the coal mines where I never will come up again. This was always in my mind. IfI go\ndown there, I'll never come up again. I will starve or be buried alive. It was till 1945, January, about\nthe 18th, 17th of January where we already knew that the Russian front 1s approaching closer.\nYou could hear bombing?\nWe could hear. We already found those at Cracow was already (c.161) and this was only sixty\nmiles away from Cracow.\nThis was relatively close to Auschwitz?\nYeah, this was close to Auschwitz. Was also affiliated from Auschwitz. Auschwitz by itself had\nmany camps which were affiliated to Auschwitz because they needed slave labor outside of\nAuschwitz. The day before, I would say one day before the liberation of this camp, they managed,\nthey managed us; thousands were driven out from the camp by our so-called tormentors. I never\nending that much from Poland to the vicinity of Salesea (c.171) to lower Germany, into Germany\nagain.\nLievich? (c.171)\nLievich, that's right. On the way, many of my friends collapsed and died of hunger, illness, cold\nweather, simply exhaustion; they couldn't go anymore. Those who could not continue on this\ninhuman march, were shot dead by the Germans immediately. I still cannot understand my endurance,\nthe strength to survive it all where my only food was snow on the ground.\nHad they given you a ration before you left the camp?\nYes. They give us a ration before we left the camp but it lasted also for this one night. Then we were\nsleeping outside on the outer fields and our food was only snow. Someone found something beneath\nthe snow, grass or something. One night, in the beginning of February, this was January, 1945, when",

        "we reached the area of Lievich, Germany, again we were packed into a huge barn, like cattle ready\nfor slaughter. It seemed that time that the murderers were about to kill all of us wretched, powerless\nand defenseless victims. I was not mistaken in my assumption. That night, one of those night I, Irving\nBalsam, decided to risk an escape.\nAlone?\nNo, I did escape with another inmate which we helped together. In camp, 1n concentration camp,\neveryone had a buddy. You could not survive alone. You had to have a buddy, a friend, a brother,\nwe call them a brother, a buddy. I also had a buddy, a young boy who was the same age that I was.\nWe kept to ourselves since Lagisza together. I felt that time I couldn't stand the cold weather, the\nbeating on the way, the shooting of those who could not walk any longer. I felt I had nothing to lose.\nOn that bitterly cold night, I and my buddy Henry, a young Jew, Henry Margolis was his name, a\nyoung Jew from Kalisz, also a little town in Poland, we fled the barn. We didn't flee the barn at first.\nWe first hid ourselves underneath the straw. We hid ourselves in the machine which was made the--\nfrom the wheat corns, cleaned the wheat, the corns, from the leaves. They used to call it a thrash\nmachine. A thrash machine, you know, you have those machine where they farm. First we hid\nourselves underneath the straw. It's on? As we lay there in this machine inside, we found a lot of\ncorn to eat, the little corn.\nFrom the wheat?\nFrom the wheat, that's right. This corn kept us there one day and one night. But the cold, it was in\nJanuary, in February and this cold in Germany there is very--the weather is cold, probably below 20\ndegrees or something. We couldn't stand no more this bitter cold. We felt that our feet are freezing.\nHow many people were in that barn? Hundreds or--?\nThe people were--by hundreds of people. A lot of them were hiding but most of them were caught.\nHiding in various places in this barn?\nVarious places of this barn. Most of them were caught. It seems that our hiding place was the best,\nwas the best. As we laid there in the barn, the cold permeated our very marrow of our feet. It was\ncold, we felt we were going to be frostbitten which 1s worse, the beginning already of frostbite 1n our",

It was a farmer boy who happened to be Polish- speaking so he spoke 1n Polish words, we\nrecognized him, to the chickens that they should gather together, he brought them food.\nWere the other prisoners still in the barn at that time?\nWas no more in the barn?\nThe barn had been evacuated?\nThe barn had been evacuated and the further marched. The further marched and we were left alone.\nWhile we met this man, we spoke to him in Polish. We told him that we are hungry. We would like\nalso, if it is possible, to bring us some food. To which he agreed. You cannot imagine our--not\nsatisfaction--our hope that we thought here we finally find somebody speaks Polish, we are Polish.\nHe probably recognized that we are Jews and we told him and he agreed to bring us some food.\nWas he a boy younger than you?\nHe was about--we the same age--about 17, 18 years old at that time. When he agreed, I hoped that\ntime we will outlast this nightmare of the war. It seemed almost at the end. However, it seems that\nJewish survival in those awful days was not easy, not even in the best of shelters. After a short wait\nour benefactor, instead of delivering the sorely needed substance, returned with Gestapo men who\nimmediately arrested us and threw us back into the prison of Glewitz (c.288). While the others\nmarched on, I'm sure to further extermination or to their deaths. When we came to jail, we found\nabout sixty more completely miserable, ill Jews, all of them captured escaped from the death march.\nIt seems that a lot of them also ran away from the death march and were hiding in different places.\nBefore long, the Germans had driven most of us captives into the prison yard, forty of them were shot\nto death immediately. Immediately after that, the German assassins ordered us, the remaining 20\nJews to pile the murdered victims--some dead and others still half alive, you can imagine that not\neveryone was shot to death, some of them were alive--into a huge wagon which they all had prepared.\nThis was a train car?\nNo, was a horse and a buggy but horse-wagon without horse. We had to harness ourselves to the\nwagon and drag the vehicle to an old Jewish cemetery on the outskirt of Gl (c.314)",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Were you amongst those having to pull?\nYes. I was amongst them having to pull.\nHow many of you were pulling, do you remember?\nAll 20 of us went with this. We were pulling and pushing this wagon with the dead bodies. The trip\nto this burial place accompanied by savage blows and curses from the cold-blooded henchmen, was\nan experience, deeply shattered experience which I--it's agonizing to this day, even to the thought.\nWhenever I tell this story, it is--1t takes off years of my life because we thought that time will heal\nbut--.. When we reached the cemetery, we saw two open mass graves.\nWas this a real, an established cemetery?\nYes, was established, old cemetery. I found it after the war.\nWas it a Jewish cemetery or--?\nA Jewish cemetery in Germany. The Germans on the German territory, did not, did not vandalize the\ncemeteries, the old German cemeteries. Only in Poland they did it. But the Germans had Jewish\ncemeteries. I went to look up this cemetery in 1979. I went to Germany on a trial, testifying against\nthe Nazis. When we came to this cemetery, we saw two mass graves. It immediately dawned on me,\nafter all I had four years experience with the Germany, I know already their thinking about us. They\ntreating--the way they were treating us--as sub-humans that in one of the graves was for the other\nJews which they were shot before. The other 1s for us.\nWas your friend Henry still alive with you?\nYes, my friend Henry was alive. It was clear to us and to me and we were talking among ourselves\nthat we would be the next. I was not at least mistaken in the assumption. As soon as we---already\nslowed the Jews where they were disposed into the mass grave, the German criminals resumed the\nshooting and immediately the dead, dying, half-alive, and heavily wounded began falling into the\nsecond grave. The full cemetery, the area there was saturated with the blood of our victims, with my",

        "friends, with my people what we were together in camps. For the time, we had piercing screams,\nheart-rendering moans and pained _\u2014_\u2014_\u2014(374) for help. Even my friend Henry fell into the mass\ngrave and he was not shot. I heard him scream out, out, out. Suddenly, a dead silence enveloped the\nentire cemetery. I was among the unfortunate Jews in the second mass grave. As the stillness\ncontinues, the German henchmen yelled into the grave. I can tell you in German what they said. Bist\ndu___(c.387), anybody alive, , come out. Anybody alive, come out. Anyone still alive,\ncome right out. I and four more Jews, who escaped the assassin's bullet, crept out and were ordered\nto cover the horror of the gasping hole containing the dead and the near-dead Jews. How did we\nmanage to come out without any bullet? When you dig a grave, you have sand from the grave, right?\nThe sand creates a mound of other sand. When they aimed their machine gun and their pistols into\nthe grave, they stood on this mound of sand. We, five boys who were laying on this side of the grave,\nthis side the bullets did not reach us because they were going over us. So all of us who were laying\non the side of the wall, on this one side of the wall, did not get any bullets.\nSo they had forced you into the grave first?\nThat's right. First they started shouting. Then they said, jump in. So we all jumped in, we had no\nchoice. We did that under the threat of the Nazi guns pointing at us, we came out. When the gristly\ncrime finally, was finally out of sight, the executioner shot two more of our small group and then\naimed their guns at me and the remaining two Jews. Miuraculously, their guns did not discharge\nbecause there were no more bullets left in them. Was everything used up, they kept on shooting into\nthe mass grave.\nThey aimed the machine guns at you again?\nThey didn't have no more bullets in the machine guns. They only have side pistols. When we all five\ncame out, they used the rest bullets on the other two. When they aimed the gun at me, no more bullets.\nA man, an older man who had on one hand, one arm, he must have been maybe from the first World\nWar, a veteran or something, he still had his gun in his holster. When the other Gestapo men ask him,\nHans Hans, give me dine browling (444). That means Hans, give my dine pistol to finish them off.\nThis older man refused to give the pistol. He said for dezen younga (449), for these young men, I\ndon't give a pistol. They left him alone. I could say that's why, probably I am alive today, to tell the\nstory. After we were finished, we were commanded to harness ourselves to the wagon which\ntransported its ill-fated load to the cemetery and the hairy guard, again with the--four of them,\nGerman, SS men and soldiers together, were driven back to this Gl____ Prison where we were locked\nin for three more days. It seemed that time to me, like an eternity.\nHow many days total were you in prison?",

After the three days\nconfinementinthe Gl ____ prison, I was taken out of jail and I was certain I'm being led to the execution\nagain. Instead we were transferred to the railroad station and transferred on the cattle wagons to\nanother concentration camp in Austria by the name of Mauthausen. After being in Mauthausen a few\ndays, I was again sent on a commando to Koozen (c.493). It was a camp, Koozen #2 where we\nworked on Messerschmitt, airplanes for the German army. I can't recall how many days, how many\ntimes. It was absolutely, completely no food at all. One soup with a little green stuff swimming\naround in the soup, I don't know what it was, was food for a whole day. For this we worked.\nYou worked in the airplane factory?\nYeah. The airplane parts factory was in the mountains, inside, in mountains. They should not--they\nwere hidden from the attacks of the Allied airplanes.\nDid you have a specific job each day?\nYeah, we would tighten the screws. We mounted screws and we put on wheels. It seems they didn't\nhave no more motors for the airplanes. There were tens, twenties, maybe hundreds of airplanes that\nwere ready to be shipped but they didn't get--have the motors for them.\nEverything else was finished on them?\nEverything was finished, just the motors they didn't have. They never arrived because I think the\nAllies bombarded the factories with motors.\nDo you remember them ever threatening you about attempting to sabotage an airplane?\nNo. They didn't threaten us. It was a known fact because every where you went. There were signs,\nsabotage, dein tod, (517), if you sabotage, you'll be killed. Everybody was very careful to do what\nyou could precisely. After being in V (c.528) for, I would say, some days, this was the last\ncamp, not to exterminate us but to starve us to death.\nNot Goozen (c.528)?",

How can you fit in 20,000 people in two barracks\nwhich can only hold maybe 500?\nI've read that many were crushed to death in the barracks.\nThat's right. The people were crushed to death. In the morning when you got up in the morning, you\nthought you sleeping with somebody and in the meantime the other guy was already dead. You slept\namong bodies, sickness, typhus, dysentery, everything was going on. And the rain did not stop. The\nforest was full of rain, day out and day in for the last ten days, there was nothing but rain. If we got\nalready, one can of soup for a hundred people, there was specially a camp to starve us. The soup\nnever reached the people because the hunger was so great--the hunger was so great from the people\nthat they became inhuman. They attacked the can of soup and spilled it on the floor. They were\neating from the floor with the mud, with every dirty thing 1n the rain.\nLet me switch the tape.

He never permit us\neven--. You know children sometimes help home, put on a button, right? Oh, no!\nNothing?\nNothing. He never permit us to help him out.\nPrior to going to Lodz, you were just attending public school, Polish public school?\nPublic school. Attend public school and I finish public school. I finish seven years 1n public school.\nThis was in (197) in Poland, seven year public school. We were going to school together\nwith Polish, Polish Catholic boys and Jewish boys.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Did you also go to Cheder after school?\nYes. We were going to school till one o'clock. By the time we came home, grabbed something, two\no'clock we had to go to the Jewish school. We stood there till six, seven evening. Came home with\nlanterns. It was already dark, there was no electricity in town. We had a lantern. Not everybody had\na lantern, but some of us, and we all came home together. I was never dressed Hasidic, I was dressed\nmore in modern clothes, a boy would dress already in that time. We were learning, we had to do\nhomework. We had homework for Hebrew school and for the regular public school. The hardest\ntime was, for me, I remember for us in school was, because the school was open six days a week\nincluding Saturday. We Jewish boys did not go Saturday to the school. So we weren't, we missed\nschool every Saturday and Sunday. We had to get from the other school friends,--\nThe Poles?\nFrom the Polish school friends, we had to get the lessons what we had to prepare for Monday, for\nschool. If you didn't make your homework, you failed. You could stay in a class, it's not a kid, you\ncould stay two, three years behind, you would fail. Luckily, I managed to pass every grade. I was\nvery good in history and mathematics and how you call, earth science. Earth science that time so I\npassed.\nDo you remember any episodes of harassment, antisemitism ?\nWe had our share. We had to have. We were always harassed by the other schoolboys, by the Polish\nschoolboys during the intermission, during the intermission, we were harassed.\nThe intermission was--?\nBetween every session of school. We start at 8 o'clock. Between 8 and 9 was a lesson in Polish,\nright? Then you had a five-minute intermission, you went in for math. Then you have the big\nintermission between 10 and 11. We had 20-minute intermission. We supposed to have, eat your\nsnack, eat your lunch. There we had the biggest skirmishes and fights with the Polish boys.\nDo you remember ever getting involved?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "I got very much involved. I got very much involved in --. I must say most of the time, we fought\nback. We fought back and we prevailed. Was a time where they were already afraid for us, to touch\nus because they knew that they will start with the Jewish boys and among my friends, were very\nstrong ones. They were very strong boys and they knew that they going to get beaten up if they start\nwith us. We always had skirmishes. We had antisemitic outbursts from teachers who made\nantisemitic remarks in school.\nDo you remember any specific--?\nYeah, I remember one specific remark from a schoolteacher who taught us math. Was it math or\nhistory, no, a history teacher. He said we have in Poland--Poland would be a good country if we\ncould get rid of our five million people. He didn't mention Jews. He said five million people too\nmuch in Poland. If we could get rid of them, we would--Poland would be an excellent country.\nWould be enough work for all the Polaks, everything was bad at the time. A Jewish boy stood up and\nhe says to him, why don't you mention the name? you mean the three million Jews? the two million\nwhat you have there in (248). He didn't answer. He didn't answer but he meant the Jews. He\nmeant the Jews because their thought was if Poland would get rid of the Jews, they would have a\nbetter life--which it proved in history was just the opposite, just the opposite. Any country that get\nrid of the Jews is suffering. They need the Jewish know-how, Jewish businessmen. They need the\nJewish brains, they need the Jewish profession. They know it. They thought that they can take out\nbut they cannot. They could take our apartments, they could take our furniture, they could take our\nlife, they could take away everything. But they couldn't take away our brain. Therefore, 1t was wrong\nand antisemitism was very great in Poland. And in the last years, which I remember the last years of\nmy life in Poland, 1938 and '39, I must say therefore the Germans had an easier job with the Jews in\nPoland than in any other country.\nThey had natural collaborators?\nHad natural collaborators. Absolutely right.\nDid your family live in an apartment or a house?\nNo, we lived in an apartment. We lived in an apartment. Had a kitchen smaller than that, called a\nkitchen and one bedroom.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "I see.\nIn one bedroom, cold flat as you call it today. Cold flat, there was no heat; there was no electricity;\nthere was no gas.\nRunning water?\nNo running water, no toilets. We lived. We lived a happy life, a happy family home, father and\nchildren. Father went down in the coldest weather. Brought up coal and wood, made a little fire in\nthe oven. When I grew up already, me and my brother, we went to the pump to pump water. To\npump the pail water we brought 1t home. Mother made a meal the best she could, potatoes naturally.\nThe main food, potatoes. Herring, bread--.\nShe just worked in the home?\nShe was in the home, yeah. There was no work for a woman. Took care on us children, sew buttons,\nsee that the shirts are clean to go to school. Socks should be always--. It's not like here where you\nhave everyday a pair of socks. You had a pair of socks, you wear it a week. Then you make a hole,\nshe sewed them together, stitched them together and she washed them again and we were wearing.\nIn winter, it was cold, I must admit. If you didn't have--you were putting on clothes on top of clothes.\nKids, what did we care? We run down, played with the sled in the snow, came home wet, put on\nother rags. You were happy. Until this vicious storm came in and pulled us all in which we did not\nexpect. Life was one small (283). Had not the war broken, I think that probably my brother,\nmaybe me, we would--he would emigrate to Palestine that time. Because it was the dream.\nYou were part of the Zionist organization?\nI am part of the Zionist organization. It was the dream that for Zionists, not Zionist home, our own\nhome. At that time we didn't know they were going to get rid of us physically, but they get rid of us\ntormenting, antisemitism, progroms in other towns and other things.\nWas your father a supporter of Zionism?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Yes, yes, he was a supporter of Zionists, yeah. He also believe in that the Jews must have their own\ncountry. He was a learned man. He learned history; he learned the Bible; he was learning the Talmud.\nSo he knew the history of the Jewish people. He knew that there is no future for us in Europe, in\nPoland particularly.\nDid he, himself, have the desire to go to Palestine?\nNo, I tell you why he didn't have the desire. In Poland a 40-year old man was old. He used to say\nI'm an old man already. Now I remind myself when the war broke out, he was 45 years old, forty\nyears was old. It was a different time. A mother of 45 years, she looked like a old lady. It was an\nexception with my mother, she did not look an old lady but it was already. Here 50 years, was old\nman, a long beard, white beard. So he had no desire. But he wished for a better life for the children.\nOf course, the dream was there. The Zionist dream was there. It was promised through the Balfour\nDeclaration to different politicians. He followed that, we followed that in the Zionist movement and\nwe thought that our life will sometimes he there. It seems that this was all interrupted and it all took\na different turn.\nWhen the war broke out, were you in Lodz?\nNo. I was already in my hometown. Because I was in Lodz until July, I was ina camp. Then we\nsaw--we felt the feeling--you know it was talk about the war. The feeling was that I left for home. I\nleft for home; I left for hom. I didn't want to be in the big city.\nYour brother remained?\nMy brother remained. He says to me, you go home. Mother and father, because I was not done there,\nthe oldest and I had a younger brother from ten. Now he was, in 1929, he was ten, my younger sister\nwas four years old.\nWhat do you remember about that first day the Germans entered your town?\nA very good question. I remember it a lot. The night before the Germans entered my town, we were\nsitting a bunch of boys in the street, on the stoop. You know, like here you go out, a bunch of boys\non the stoop, was very dark. As I mentioned before, there was no electricity. We were sitting and\ntalking and fooling around and joking like young boys and girls do. It was about eleven o'clock--the",

        "policeman in town who knew us very well came over to us and he says, go home, go home. Shut off\nthe lights. Wherever anybody had a candle or a lamp burning, tell your parents shut off the light.\nMust be dark in every window.\nThis a Jewish policeman or just a--?\nNo, no. It was a Polish policeman. Go home. So we disbursed and went home. I came home and I\nsaid, you know Father. Policeman, I know his name, R _\u2014(357) was his name, told us to go home.\nThe war is coming. The war is coming. My father says, nobody knows. What does he know? But\nhe told us, the war is coming, shut off the lights and stay in your house. Sure enough, we went to\nsleep. Four o'clock in the morning, we heard a bang. There was a little bridge in our town between\nthe border of Germany and Poland which was connecting both countries. The bridge was what, thirty\nfeet wide. Yeah, that's all, maybe 30 feet wide. This bridge was dynamite by the Polish army.\nThat was over the Prozna (ph)(371) River?\nThat's right. How do you know?\nI did some research.\nThat's right. Was the Prozna River. Was a little bridge over the Prozna River and it was dynamited\nby the Polish army that the Germans should not be able to come in. In the meantime, when they were\ndynamiting this little bridge over the Prozna, the Germans were already in town from another side.\nThis was because there were certain places where the bridge, maybe one kilometer further was as\nnarrow, we used to jump over. We used to make tricks, we jump to Germany. So the Polish army\ncame over there with their tanks and with their trucks, was already in town. Immediately. So when\nwe looked out, it got light, six o'clock in the morning, Germans are all over. Bayonets, I remember it\ntoday, the bayonets and the tanks and the trucks are coming down to put right away another bridge\nup. They were right away looking for Jews to go to work. So they grabbed, I went down there, a\nlittle boy in short pants, never looked Jewish. Had red hair with a lot of pimple on my face. I went\ndown and greeted the Germans. First I went to the bakery before when the Germans were ready to\ncome. I ran over to the bakery, me and my little brother and the baker ran away from town. He ran\naway from town, he was afraid when he heard shooting, he left all the bread on the floor. So we\ngrabbed as much as I could. I hand to him and we brought it home. Fresh bread. Then other people\ncame and they also had bread. After this, we already came home, I see already the German marching\nJews. They caught some Jews to work to help them build the bridge. They marching there and the\nJews were right away standing, the first day, the first few hours, up here into the water. The Prozna",

        "wasn't a big water and they were helping to rebuild the bridge what the Polish army exploded.\nNaturally, I ran to the house, hid my father. Took my father and my mother to the basement. I stood\nin front of the house. German soldiers came over with the bayonets like this, says Juda, Juda--.(397)\nJewish?\nNo, Juda. No Jew. Juda here, they want to know where a Jew is living there because in other places\nthey had looked the Polish told them right away where was a Jew. They didn't know I'm a Jew. I'm\nnot going to tell on my family. I say no Juda, no Jew, no Juda and they went further with their\nbayonets and they made sure that everybody opened the stores. The stores that everything should be\nnormal. Most of the people run away from town. I witnessed the first boots, the German boots. All\nof a sudden, the army started marching, the German army. Army, motorcycles, trucks and tanks.\nMotorcycles, trucks and tanks for seven days, night and day, night and day, marching through our\ntown to the city of Lodz. Seven days later, they were in Lodz and occupied Lodz and everything on\nthe way. This was Friday. Sunday, they corralled all the Jews from my town into the synagogue. I\nshowed you a picture of the synagogue. Naturally, I didn't let my father go, not my father. I went\nwith my little brother. We all looked like little, no Jewish boys. Here they bringing Jews from all\nover the town into the synagogue. We thought--I didn't want to risk my parents. The idea was, we\nfound out later, that the idea was to explode the synagogue with the people in there. This was on\nSunday, three days later. Mind your this was before they had an order yet, the Von (427)\nConference I think, before yet, when they had the plan to exterminate all the Jews. They were already\nkilling Jews. This was not SS men, this was the army. I don't know where they got the orders but it\nwas in their hand. As we stood there in the synagogue and I listened without a hat, I went in without\na hat, I didn't put any. He was hollering--the general goes up on the bima, on the stage and he said,\nyou should know, the German, you have killed many Germans in this town. Three German soldiers\nwere killed yesterday by Jews. You entitled to die, all of you. But we giving you the last warning.\nIf ever any German soldier will be killed in this town again, you all will be killed and he disbursed\nthe people. He did not--we found out later from the Germans sources that they couldn't do it in our\ntown, it was too close to Germany. It was too close, the army was marching by, you understand.\nMatter of fact the synagogue remained, it's still there.. This was on Sunday. Then they start marching\nand leaving us fairly alone, on our own till they established a headquarters and a Gestapo, They\ncaught to work. We had to make the roads wider for the German tanks to pass.\nYou worked on the roads?\nYeah, we worked on the roads. Then we eliminated even some houses. There were some houses\nstanding in the corner, little houses of wood and the German tank would pass say take it down. We\nhad to clear it up, they should be able to cross. They took us right to work but we came home tn the\nevening. They grabbed young people.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Your father--?\nNo, no. Never, we never let them. I always protected my father. I never let him go to work. He was\nhidden. I always went because every family had to supply people so I went, my mother went\nsometimes to sweep the streets. My father, no. He had very bad legs, he had broken legs before the\nwar and he couldn't do. I protected my father. What else can I remember? Then, lasted until 1940.\nDid they require armbands of you at that time?\nYeah, that's right. Two months later, a few weeks had been very quiet, we should wear all armbands\nand the Star of David.\nDid you wear a patch or--?\nWear a patch, Star of David and a yellow armband. This way, they left us still in our homes. But we\nwere not allowed after five o;'clock out. In the morning, they let us out. But in order for us to sustain\nourselves, especially my mother was the one who was the supplier of food. She ran into the village\nand bought some food from the peasants and brought it home dressed as a Polish woman. And I took\noff my band whenever--and I didn't walk in the sidewalk, I walked straight on the sidewalk. Because\nif I walk in the sidewalk, they knew already Iam a Jew. The only thing I have to watch out for is that\na Polak should not see me, he would tell him this is a Jew.\nYou would walk in the street?\nIn the street, right. You see what I mean? I walked--not in the street, I walked on the sidewalk. Took\noff my band, went over, brought something for somebody else, the other guy had sugar, this one had\nbread. You know, we did some exchanging in order to survive. This was about till 1940, till they\nmade a ghetto. They took part of the city and they separated. We all had to leave within two hours\nour homes that we were living for many years and go into this ghetto. Two, three families in one\nroom.\nSo your apartment wasn't within the established boundaries?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "No, my apartment was not. We had to leave, we had to leave. We left and the other boundary was\ncloser to the Jewish cemetery. Whatever we took along, we took along. Everything left. Furniture,\nwho cares about furniture that ttme? We took along some schmattas, (51), to dress, that's all, to sustain\nyourself. There in the ghetto, we lived together. Three families into aroom. Again they took us, the\nyoung people had to go to work to build the roads, to clean the snow. Winter came in and the\nGermans--you know they're very harsh winters.. Snow and the Germans had to travel with their\ntrucks. We had to make the roads, we had to work for them. Till little by little, they liquidated the\nghetto. They liquidated us young people, I told you, they took us to camp. Shipped off to camp,\nslave-labor camp.\nSo you were the first to go in your family?\nWith the first eighty boys. Looking back, retrospect, we were 80 boys with four Germans taking us\non the transport. Can you imagine? No one had to--the strength or the wisdom to attack the four\nGermans. Eighty! Take away their ammunition and run to the forests. But nobody knew it. When\nI went away, I said to my father, I'm going to tell you the story. I'm going to tell you when I come\nback. We all thought that we going to work for three months in labor camp and we'll going to come\nback.. But the whole thing was to trick us in, to trick us in. So when the young people were already\ntricked in, there couldn't be no more resistance , right; go in the camp. The older people with the\nyounger people, my father with my younger two brothers, they went. The very old people, like the\nbuby, the grandmother and-- grandfather was not alive but I had a grandmother and other people, they\ntook them in the cemetery and shot them. They all buried in a mass grave there in Praszka. So that\nwas the lot of my town.\nWhat happened to your oldest brother? Did he remain in Lodz?\nNo, my oldest brother, I must say he died a hero,. Why did he die a hero? Because he had a good\ntrade, he was an electrician. He came home from Lodz during the war. He run to Warsaw during the\nwar but he came home from Warsaw. He came home from Warsaw to his parents. When I was taken\nout to camp, he remained home with my parents. When they had the ghetto, they clean up the ghetto,\nthey ask all the people who had a trade, go to the right, and all the other people, my father and mother\nwith the other children to the left. I was told, I met a boy who was in the same line, my landsman. I\nmet him in 1944. He said your brother Moishe did not want to leave the parents.\nSo he went in their line?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "That's right. He did not want to leave the parents. He don't know what they're going to do without\nhim. That's why I said, he died a hero. He thought, he didn't know. He thought they're going to take\nhim with the parents and two little children. Two younger brothers with a sister, they are going to\ntake them. Maybe they're going to put them in the Lodz ghetto, he will work a electrician, he will\nhave a trade. No, but it was the opposite. They took the other ones to the ghetto. If he would have\ngone out from the line and said I am an electrician, they would have grabbed him. He would have\nbeen.--. (End of Tape 1) I had to report to the SS man who was watching me. He say,\nHefling (1), I'm under forty, (1). What do you want, you dog? Bitte (2)\nmeans I want to go away, leave him, five minute, two minute. It was a better one he give you two\nminutes, it was a bastard, he said one minute back. I run to the toilet, do what you have to do, come\nback in a minute, if you manage. That's what they say. I always wondered, what will happen if they\nshould give _(c.7). They wouldn't have to have the problems. They always could see this one,\nthis one. So in everything 1n life, I think, there is some intervention. I am, most important thing of it,\nI remained a believer after the war, I still remained. I am a believer. I believe in divine destiny. Why\nme, not others? I don't know.\nWhat about luck?\nI believe. I believe that it was destiny, divine destiny that certain people should remain alive, continue\ntheir life, contribute to the society, contribute to the Jewish people and transmit the story. So today,\nI belong to the synagogue, I am observant and I am very dedicated, very much dedicated to the\nsurvival of the Jewish people. Not only with words, but with deeds too. I guess, it is the story of my\nlife. There are different episodes in the middle which we could sit here for five, six hours more and I\ncould tell you. I could tell you a story where the SS in Praszka. I was once in--thought my survival\nwould be easier if I joined the Hitlerjugend, yeah.\nThis when someone believed that you were not a Jew?\nThat's right. I was joining them for three days I belonged to the Hitlerjugend. I thought that this\nwould be the way. I went there and they took me in, the German youngsters, they didn't recognize\nme. I was in the kitchen in the beginning.\nThis was in your town, they had a Hitlerjugend?\nYeah, yeah. I worked there for three days till I was again given up by a Polish. The first Polish came\nin and he tell this is Juda. I took off my jacket and run.",

It could\nhappen because I --and they stand up there, they don't believe it.\nSomebody, one of the German soldiers or an SS man noticed you or--?\nNo, no. It was not a German soldier.

I was\nsent to work there. I was sent there to work. When I came in, they ask me what are you doing here?\nI didn't tell them I was sent by the Jewish community to work but I said I came in to work.\nSo the Judenrat had given out some assignments?\nYeah, Judenrat gave us some assignments. So I said I came to work in the kitchen. They young boys,\n18 years old. Arbeit (49), --- here in the kitchen. Gave me an apron. Then I start to think, if I can\ncontinue staying here, I have a future. But was not easy. Was not easy because in my face you\ncouldn't recognize me as Jewish. When people tell me the story about Europa, Europa when the\nJewish boy was Hitlerjugend, and he did survive and certain things, I said everything is possible. It\nalmost happened to me.\nSo you stayed there three days working?\nThree days, I came every morning with my hand like this, Heil Hitler, you know.

When I came to camp, I came in short pants so it must\nhave been summer. I came in short camps and a little jacket. I show it to you. My father and mother\ngave me something there in a little package. So I must have been there in summer, autumn, winter.\nThen I was sent to this German camp. There it was called Kustrin. A factory where they produced a\npowder for bullets.\nThat was before Auschwitz then too?\nYeah, this before Auschwitz, yeah.\nDo you know how to spell the name of that camp?\nYeah, Kustrin.

To find my\nfriend Henry Margolis. When I went to Germany, the story like this. I went to Germany to testify\nagainst two Nazis from my camp near Roznow (80). I went to a in Germany. When I\nwas there already, I prepared myself here home here, I got a visa for Poland. I said when I am already\nin Germany and I go through the agonizing, grueling of witnessing, I probably will--let's go to Poland,\nI said to her, my wife. She agreed with me. We never went home back. Let's go to Poland and see\nhow itis. So this is the first trme I went. After Germany, I went for five, six days to Poland in 1979.\nWent to visit my hometown, went to visit the cemetery.

You know what I\nmean. I was going in the streets and my feet were sinking in like--they were so rubbery--I didn't know\nwhy your feet got so rubbery. I was looking for a young boy. I came into the home where I left. I\nthought I find some pictures, photographs. I was lucky, the home was there. Was occupied by a\nPolish drunk. He had a padlock on the door. Lucky and I didn't go in. Then I said to Helen and to\nthe Polish guide who led me there, that I think that it was luck or Providence that the door wasn't open\nbecause I might have fainted or got a heart attack coming in the house I was glad it was closed. I\nwent up the stair and they told me there's a Polish drunk living there. Closed and I didn't bother to go\nthe next day. Because I came back the next day again. I didn't bother no more. I went to the cemetery,\ndid my--did the prayers. ____(107), a Jew come to my town, nobody. I did my prayers in the\ncemetery. I went to the synagogue, looked just in through the window. It was also closed. They told\nme if you want to wait till five o'clock, we open for you. Isaidno,no. _((110) I figured enough\nas a boy what I remember. I went on the steps from my Cheder. I said please . Looked\naround town. I saw who 1s living in Jewish homes, in Jewish houses and what's happening. I left,\nvery agonizing experience. Then I went with my wife to her town. The same thing. She couldn't\nwalk into the school, she was___\u2014((118). She went only to the house, she will tell you where she was\nliving. She couldn't do any more. This is the time I went over to the cemetery because was under\nPoland. Y _((120) is under Poland now. So I had to go into Poland. It took me nine hours to find\nthe cemetery. Because I asked people where is the Jewish cemetery. Nobody knew. They all were\nnewcomers because the original populations was no more there. Until I finally got a hold of an old\nGerman woman. I gave her two dollars and she led me to the cemetery. I found the graves, I found\nit. Therefore when I came back, I wrote the story in the Jewish paper here. It was translated to English\nbut this is only part of it. I came back from my own grave. Germany--I testified for three days. Was\nvery lonely, it was not right. It's not nght they sending a survivor. They are sending a survivor to\ntestify by himself without any lawyers, without any support group without anything. Because I came\nin through the courtroom. They were sitting 50 people. They brought down all the secretaries and\nall the words in the courtroom. In the front was sitting seven judges. They told me to recognize two\nmurderers.\nThis was from that sub-camp of Auschwitz?\nNo, from Y__(c.141).\nOh, from Y ,\nFrom Y . How can you recognize after 40 years?

I felt that I'm the accused. Can you imagine,\nseven judges! Here I have no attorney, have no defense, nobody on my side.\nSo they were busy asking you questions?\nYeah, they was asking me questions. You have to tell the story. How did you see? How do you\nknow it's him? How do you it's him and how come you're--? How close were you from him? Were\nyou two feet, three feet? I said ten feet away. They said how can you recognize it's him. I said\nbecause I saw him everyday in camp. I know it was him. If I would be closer, I wouldn't be here to\ntestify, he would shoot me. He would kill me. The last day, I had an argument with them, not an\nargument, I had a statement. A very positive statement. I just spoke to their conscience. To the\nGerman judges and to them. I said one word. Through my testimony, I implicated another two SS\nmen which were later tried. One got prison sentence. They want me to come for the other trial but I\ndidn't want to come no more. They want me to come for the trial for the SS men from Lagisza where\nI was, near Benjum (162) where I told you. I didn't want to go no more. They came here. I testified\nin the German consulate. I didn't want to go no more. But he got, he got through my testimony, this\none guy--. As a matter of fact, 1 have here a paper, I had it the other day. He got sentenced one Smith.\nHe was in the camp Lagisza--I know I just saw it. Now when I'm looking, I want to show you this\npiece of paper. Where do I have it? I cut it out from paper. This Smith was sentenced so many years\nbecause of--the camp from Lagisza-- because I implicated him. I wouldn't find it because I didn't\nprepare it. I don't know where it is.\nLet me ask you one other question about when you went to Auschwitz. You were transported by\ntrain, by cattle car?\nWhen I went to Auschwitz from K_\u2014\u2014_\u20144(179)--. You know I don't remember, I don't remember. I'm\nsure it wasn't a sitting train. There was no sitting train but I actually don't remember. I remember\ngetting off in Birkenau. You know where Mengele was there and everybody else. They took people\nto the right and to the left. I remember that. It was cattle cars, yes, but we were not packed like cattles\nfrom that because the Germans who put us there were a little different. I mean from this camp.\nYou put through the quarantine at that time?\nI was put--yeah. Taken away my clothes. Taken away the clothing, taken away I had pictures from\nhome, everything gave away. Went into shower one side, came out other side naked, give me other\nclothes and a different man, a different person.",

My own clothes from home. We exchanged, you know, from\nhome, this and that, civilian clothes. Then I got the striped uniform with the striped hat, with the\nshoes.\nWooden shoes or--?\nNo, I happened to grab a pair of other shoes but they were too tight. But after wearing them a few\ndays, you don't feel no more, the tightness. No, wooden shoes, I didn't get. Some of them got wooden\nshoes. I happened to be lucky and got other shoes.\nDid you work within Auschwitz-Birkenau?\nNo.\nHow long were you there before being--?\nI volunteered on a commandant, on outside work. They came into the camp and they said we need\n50 people today, 50 (204). Who wants to go? One day I wanted to go, there was a\ncamp Y 205). but they--. I heard it's coal , It's for movement, coal mines. I\nstepped back from the line. The next one I have we go to another camp, Lagisza-Ar (207), they\nneed and I give myself another time, locksmith. I figure I'm not going (209) I wanted\nto get away from Auschwitz as fast as possible on account of the selection.\nThat was Lagisza?",

        "They were sent to Lagisza, yeah.\nOkay. Let's see. Y (215) was when?\n1944. 1944 in the middle, there was no camp at Lagisza. August. I came to Auschwitz in\nAugust, 1943. I came to Lagisza, must be in September. I was there September, October, November,\nDecember. I was there the winter. Then I went to (222). When it was already, wasn't cold\nalready.

I didn't work there, didn't go to work. Auschwitz, maybe,\nI don't know, a week, yeah. By the time they _us back and forth every day. Maybe even less than\na week.
