Was two professor in my father's place, so we have to give\nthem food and uh shelter, cause there was all this two men, so I have an advantage that\nthey teach me uh during uh 1939 and during '40, because I was prepare for uh higher\neducation, so they teach me. Then after the the German take them anyway in 1940. And\nthere was uh first few months when German take over, was uh was quiet. Uh they put,\nposted all over be calm, go back to work, uh everything be OK. Then then uh everybody\nhave to go register, have to have an have an ID card. Then after that the German\nadvertising, uh 19...beginning of 1940, they advertising to work in Germany. Mass uh\nadvertising that they needed...they say they have a good pay and so so but nobody want\nto go. Only people work in the Tarnow wherever there was industry, in the Tarnow...in\nsome...the German opened the industry and make the people was before, but other\npeople, they have no no work. There was no any other care uh only go to Germany to\nwork, no other living. So some people go to underground to ;\nunderground...(Cough)...Excuse me...uh against uh German or they go to woods to live,\nhiding, and do a sabotage against German, uh start uh start uh be against uh sabotaging\nand against the German...1940. But there was uh not...they was organized but it was hard\nbecause it was a cold winter and uh and uh German was powerful, have a motorized car\nand and motorcycle and go all over, so people escape. Go to woods and uh and that way\nsurvive. Uh and the farmer would feed them but uh that was 1940. Then they start\narresting uh people. First uh they put in the city hall all the name, because they have it\nfrom ID cards, they have the name who you are and they wanted so many people uh\nreport and go to Germany to work who have no way to live to go, uh to go by themselves.\nThey go register because they have no way to live, like in the city have no no food or\nnothing so so they go...some people went and went to Germany to work. But not so\nmany, so after they start arresting on the street uh just...Gestapo have uh on truck a\ndozen. Then the car stop on any of the street. Two two trucks, uh pick-up truck when it\nwas with the Gestapo...one on the beginning of the street, on another. Stop the traffic and\ntake all the people on the street. Uh young young young most of them...they look for\nthem that be work for...and they put on the truck and sent to uh sent where there were\nexamination and they sent to Germany to work for uh slave labor, forced labor labor\ncamp in Germany, and during uh this uh 1940, the occupation, uh we have a flier that\nwas come from England or uh or through underground all situation how 1s work German\nare and uh the people organize underground a a campaign against German, and uh all\nthe...because a printing shop was all closed when the German take over, put people do by\nby uh called small, hand...uh by hand printed, so and uh we have a message what's going\non from already the underground who already have. Then they print some note and we\ngive a message to people, but if uh if they catch you, German, then uh then you sometime\nthey kill you on the spot or send you...",
        "Q: Were you personally involved or were any of your brothers or your your your parents\ninvolved in with what the partisans were doing or in handing out these leaflets?",
        "A: Uh yes, my brother was involved in the Tarnow and I don't...still don't know how he got\ninvolved because there was always was secret and even never told me where he get it,\nhow he get it...just told...he give me a few uh bundle of them and uh take down to to\ndown where...and give people at the church, on on the village or wherever wherever he\nsent me, but I was uh...he give me a basket. There was a bundle of of the leaflets in a\nsmall basket like a fruit basket and on the top is hay and I put rabbits, and that's how I\ntransport uh message, because if...excuse me...(pause)...uh that way I transferred the\nmessage in the basket with rabbits because when the when the Germans stop me on\nthe...always was a patrol on the street...when they stop me, they look the rabbits and kick\nme and and I just hold it that they don't fall out...1t was tight...because they don't like the\nrabbit. That way I went through and I was always dressed ragged uh there be...there be no\nsuspicion that I something, you know. Also that way uh in another city, like in Tarnow,\nthere was short on food. There was ration of food and so we, from the farm, we bring to\nmy brother food that way uh just on the bicycle or I walk with the basket...put bread and\nuh salt pork and uh butter...also same way. Uh have a big basket, put on the bottom and\nput hay on the top and rabbits on the top, because if you have open and and uh German\nlook uh they'll take it, so uh we transferred the food uh to to my brother and uh my\nbrother live in Tarnow, two of them. Neighbor was Jew, people where he was before\nwork, before war he was work with them...also that they was still make the dress uh but\nfor the store also, but the the Jew was uh persecuting and uh and uh buying...they can't go\nout. They have to have a a Star of David uh on their uh clothes and uh in Tarnow...that's\nbeginning of 1940 and '41, so 1940. And uh my brother helped them uh with the with the\nfood, because he also...my brother come, two of them, they come uh to my father and\nthey transport the food to to town. Many time uh when they have a bigger amount, like\npotatoes or something, when uh when they got to the house, the German uh Gestapo\nspotted and uh they got beaten because they they know the Jew was live over there next\ndoor, so my bro...I was beaten a couple of times too, because they they saw me come out\nfrom the building where Jew was and uh somehow they know it and say are you a Jew. I\nsay no, I have ID. So so uh they kick me, say what you do over there, you know. I say\nnothing, you know. Uh I I want buy some thread because I always had some little item\nfor excuse what I what I was doing, because if you have nothing uh then then you're\nsuspicious, so I have a little thread or some small item that uh to or even button, you\nknow, because they have a store or or no...only small item, so that way uh that way I go\naway with this partisan you know...",
        "Q: Can you tell me what happened next to you?",
        "A: Well, then...that was 1940. I was twice arrested on the street because uh many time when\nI saw what's going on I...when uh was arresting...we we can see how they stop so I know\nwhich which way to run away to one one house and go outside on another street, but uh\ntwice the the block so tight I cannot escape so I was arrested, put on the on the\ntruck...usually the Gestapo. The Gestapo was special uh German police. They have a...on\nthe front...they black uniform some and some they are grey uh and have a big under like a\nSS underneath, under Polish sign...special po...police. They have the power to kill you on\nthe spot. You can do nothing, so uh they put on the truck, a pick-up truck, uh how many\nthey can fitted...young people, then they go to the railway station...that was not far...and\nput on the wagon uh wherever was wagon. Usually was uh cattle but they usually...they\ndon't do uh no more they usually do for concentration camp. They put on...they call third-\nclass wagon, and lock personal (ph) and uh about a hundred people and then uh train go\nto Krackow and over there also we have to walk with the Gestapo to check point. Check\npoint in the Krackow was in a big school because all school was closed. There was no no\nteaching during the occupation. Only...they only allowed first grade, first couple grades\nof public school and not not high school. There was...high school was empty. They using\nfor transportation checkpoint, so there was hundred people and with no room to sleep or\nnothing. They will stand up in in each hall or class and uh have a kitchen, so they have\nsomething to eat, and they go through examination...doctor, German doctor examine each\none and if alright go to next room and uh shave close all, everything, uh arm and all over,\nand uh put back clothes, get in and go another room and put on a train again. Another\ntrip, you know, twenty or a hundred...1t depends how many they selected and sent to\nGermany to work. So twice I was arrested. Twice I was...once I was shaved uh but he say\nyou no have no...you have clean hair so you'll be alright...the barber said. Then I escaped\ntwice in Krackow because there was so many people so I was able to escape and my\nbrother would know it and help me. He know what happened in Tarnow so he went uh\nand he helped me, so I come back home, but uh third time there was uh...it was so strictly\nuh tight uh guards I couldn't escape and uh then uh they send me to with other about\ntwenty all just men...young all, not...well, healthy men...about twenty, to...uh all we\ntraveled on the train all through Germany to a place named Hanover (ph) _\u2014_\u2014_\u2014s and uh we\nlanding 1n a in a place they called . It was industry, uh German industry that\nmake all the war industry...hundred and sixty thousand slave work workers who was over\nthere, and all different labor camp, all nationality and uh they put me in the one camp. It\nwas a labor...forced forced labor camp. They call and uh there was about uh a\nfew thousand Poles in that one camp. Now we don't know each other because there was\nstrictly to uh...we know where we come from but we was working and there was\nconstruction company. He take care, say twenty-five people are selected from the group\nand I was with the with the group to one construction company and and that construction\ncompany make shelter, bunker...uh shelter against air attack. Uh they make of cement a\nShel...shelter. Thick...about uh uh two meter...that's almost two yard thick wall and four\nstory and uh very strong cement enforced with iron and the capacity for five thousand\npeople, and when there was...there was prepared for war when the American and English\nbomb after, the bombs slide through. Nothing...because because that's two and a half\nmeter uh cement, so almost two yards thick cement walls around and uh that...they have\ninside uh prepare for electricity, water, everything. They they was prepared for for long\nwar, so I was in there camp labor, in the construction for almost...over four year, till\n1945. It was terrible uh...1t was hard work. Uh in the morning uh our company, the\nconstruction company, uh would have a pick-up truck, open pick-up truck, double. They\ncome to barrack where we live and we we already was standing over there waiting for\nthem, and we go on them. They take us to the place, about a couple mile, to make the\nshelter and also the construction uh company, uh German supervisor, German, but they\nusing all the slave people like me, uh Polish, Italian, French, but Pole was uh separated\nuh. And also they take us sometime when there was bomb during day or night, so after\nbomb they take us to clean up the street but we can't touch the dead bodies of German or\nany object. Uh we'll get shot. We we find some dead...we have to tell them and the\nGerman take them and then we clean up the uh because it was from bomb, the destroy\nhouse was all over the street, so we have to clean the street so truck can go through, and\nwe go back to work. Uh our regular work was uh make the shelter, bunker they call it. Uh\nsometime we start twelve hours a day because uh they make a hugh uh cement mixer\nmachine motor and we fit uh with sand and cement and it was twelve hours sometime\nwork. Some...uh six day, and after work they take us to uh to camp where we sleep.\nThere was a barrack, wood barrack, and each uh room was about twenty uh bed, bunk\nbed like a wood box and was small and and a locker room so each one have a locker and\nwe have some item, what you have items. You have a bow], a round, half round uh bowl,\nmetal for eat and a spoon and and uh card uh where they give you a ration card stamped\nso you have to take it and when they bring to camp, you go wash. You go room. Wash\nyourself and go in the mess (ph) room and wait for uh for the in the big kitchen and they\nopen up the window. You give them the stamp and you get one...uh then you go another\nwindow and you get little bread. And you eat this and after one hour you're hungry and\nyou have nothing in the morning. In the morning you get coffee, but the coffee was made\nof hickory, sour like uh...something how. And lunch time nothing, only the evening.\nThat's what uh that's what it was, day after day and uh uh the food was from beginning\nwas a little bit more but uh 1943, '44, '45 was they cut the bread ration so was very, very\nhungry. Uh all the time...hunger is the worst thing for a human being.",
        "Q: Did uh...now you say worked six days a week. What would you do on the seventh day?",
        "A: Uh Sunday...uh sometime we have to work Sunday, but usually it was in uh we stay in\nthe barrack. We clean. We clean up the uh...sometime...it's a big washroom, so we wash\nclothes. Uh but there was no no detergent, so they don't clean the _, so...because we\nget uh only three months we get some clothes, like like underwear. Not regular like\nnormal people. Just some funny uh special-make for us. You know, they would...because\nwe wouldn't escape and go outside the camp. Beside that, when I get...uh everyone, when\nwe get to Germany, we have aa the company take so many guys, you know, people uh\nmen or woman, separate woman uh men separate, and every Pole like me they give us a\nlittle cloth like two, three inch square with name P and you have to put on the right uh\nside of your jacket, jacket and on the shirt and you have to sew yourself and you have to\nhave all the time. If you don't have this, you get beaten very uh very strong and this was\nP for marked for Polish and I was one of the two million Polish citizens that was taken by\nforce to Germany to forced labor camp and uh was all over in Germany, our people was\nstay over there work. Like me...I was...happened that I land in a construction company,\nwhat I say before. Uh now they call worker.",
        "Q: Was your camp guarded and were you guarded when you went to work?",
        "A: Yes. There was...the camp was uh...there was about twen...twenty barracks. Each\nbarracks hold about hundred people and uh wood barracks, and they was guarded. It was\nwire around. Not electric wire like some places, but there was guards. You can't get out.\nUh when you get out, uh where you going to go? You you have no...you have a funny\nclothes.

They won't allow you. That's why we have to have the P. When the\nthe...you cannot you cannot escape. What people try escape that change...the the finer\nclothes, you know, but uh they're they're finer, because they was in in Germany. They\nwas not in Poland. That's...",
        "Q: Did you have any contacts...when you were on a construction site, did you have any\ncontact with Germans who weren't guards, just the ordinary people on the streets?",
        "A: Uh, well uh in uh when we was working, there was so many uh people, Poles and other\nnationality, Italian, French, and the...we don't talk much because uh German was like\nbosses and watchmen...was few watchmen with uh with weapons that you don't escape,\nand uh we we just have...we can't talk uh much. If you talk right away they see you and\nuh you get you get hit, so uh we we just have to uh work. We talk to each other very\nlow...we we talked...we Polish...yeah, but not not hear, the German hear. And they\nalways uh they watch us what we do good job and if we do something wrong, then you\nget uh you get very bad beaten with the shovel or with the rifle. Sometime...uh one day I\nhave to bring uh cement from uh uh train...the two guy take it, a bag of cement and put on\nyour shoulder and you go to the to storage. You have to run. Uh when it was rained, it\nwas mess. Then if the bag of cement break then you get beaten, so...1t is not your fault but\nyou have to be careful, so they they was very strictly about uh sabotage.

        "Q: Can you tell me uh about how you came...how you got free?",
        "A: Well uh on April 1945 uh we uh we know the American not far. We already hear uh uh\nshooting and uh and it was in the paper, newspaper that the German give us\nnewspaper...they always say where where they are, where the American and English are.\nAnd uh the German advise to the German to hide their last men, so so and also uh uh\nwere of us, the __, like Polish and all other prisoners, because afraid of uh we do the\nrevenge, so uh come April 12th, we we spot American tank and uh tank go by...one, two,\nthree. We...and uh it was in the morning and first we knew, we go after the guard,\nbecause the barrack where we stay by the gate was the barrack and by the gate is more\nfood and all ammunition and a guard and everything. We went over there. There's\nnobody there. The the guard, the German escape away before we don't even know it.\nThey left some empty uh rifle in the window and it look like they there. And uh so uh\nAmerican uh uh 9th Army came. First there was very __ because people when they go\nhome and was a thousand mile, kilometer from uh where I was, like , it's now\nWest Germany...to my town is too far, so uh we stay in the camp and there come\norganization uh International Organization for Refugee...they call UNRA...and uh we put\nall together uh like in the one camp the Polish uh refugee in the one camp. Same camp\nwhere we where we was, but we clean up. We was uh free. We have a kitchen, but we\nhave to do everything by own. Uh kitchen...we have to have...people have to work uh by\nuh in order to to survive...do everything by themselves in the camp. Uh uh there was\nalso...we org...we organized school and chapel. We have a a priest. Many priest was\nliberated from Dachau concentration camp, so they come and the one we have in our\ncamp, and I was work with him in the school, in the church because also was so many\nfamilies the German take to work on the farm, so they left the farm when the American\ncame and they come to camp. They call this place displaced person camp, DP camp in in\nWest Germany, and there was under English occupied zone, but there was very\nstrictly...uh we can do what we want but we can't go to Poland because it was uh Russia\noccupied Poland and was different government under Russian uh Russian, so many\npeople take uh chance and go back to Poland and many of them wait in the camp for uh\nimmigration so meantime I uh start school. There was also uh like a professor,\nprofessional people, so I take examination and I pass and I uh receive a a diploma for\nteaching and we organize school and there was about...uh the camp where I was,\ndisplaced person camp, there was about two thousand, over two thousand Polish persons,\nuh men, women, children. Uh men like single they separate and uh lady, girl separate and\nfamily live together, also in the barrack, and uh about a hundred and twenty children, so I\nwas teaching in the grammar uh level in the school there was in the camp too, and uh like\nI say organize Scouts. I was the scoutmaster. There was life like a little community 1n uh\nin the camp, because everybody have to uh work how...uh wherever he wanted, in the\nkitchen or in a guard, because we have to guard the camp uh just order, you know, like\nself uh self-organization, and we go out to uh German town. We can uh if we have the\nmoney we buy something or but nothing too big because we have no money and there\nwas _____ was bad. The food uh we get uh we have ration also because uh Germany\neconomy was bad and uh and uh international organization supply uh make the German\nsupply some food for for us fora few _, so there was a short of everything but uh uh\nbecause it was free so so we survived and everybody was waiting for uh\nimmi...going...1mmigrate, go to Canada or United States or Australia. Whoever have aa\nrelatives in uh United States or or Canada so so ask for signed papers, so then you wait\nand you get them, but uh see I wrote uh to home because uh many people go to\nPoland...(pause)...especially like a big family because there was not so good in a in a one\nroom, whole family in a wooden camp, so they went to back to Poland and they write to\nus back uh you better try and go some other...find another country because Poland is now\noccupied by Russia and different government, but it's different situation. So uh I wrote to\nhome and my mother wrote wrote my letter to me. I have...after a few months, long long\ntime, she advised to uh see her sister because uh I say maybe I come back home, back to\nSmidgnow, so she write see my sister in . That's all she write, because there was a\nletter was censored. The communists censor the letter and uh her, my mother's sister live\nin Connecticut and brother too. My bro...my mother's sister and my and brother was in\nConnecticut, so my mother give me a clue...don't go back to Poland. Go to United States,\nso I write...the next time, next letter there was, have address and next third letter was\nanother have address to uh Derby, Connecticut, so I have a full address and I wrote to uh\nto my aunt in Derby, Connecticut and an uncle and also my mother write to them in\nUnited States to ask them to uh help me, to bring me to United States but uh uh my\nmother, she was suggest uh I finish school so that was not so easy for them, my uncle and\naunt to supply me for for college education, so so I was waiting for a visa five year, and\nduring the five year I was teaching in a displaced person camp in Polish school and\nPolish Boy Scouts. Then came 1950, and I uh...came paper from Chicago. I was working\nwith one priest in Germany after war, so he was uh in our camp. He went to Chicago year\nbefore and he sent a visa through his organization from Chicago to for me in 1950 in\nDecember. I uh I came to New York and to Chicago to...uh there was Jesuit priest in uh\nChicago to have a publishing culture, religion newspaper monthly, so I was working in\noffice and there was work for me for one month, but uh I want to see my aunt in\nConnecticut so I came to Connecticut and I stayed uh in Connecticut, still in same place\nin Connecticut, Derby, Connecticut.",
        "Q: Did you uh...how did your...did your brothers all survive the war and your parents?",
        "A: My parents, yes, survived but they have they are older and they live on a farm and uh\nthey have to give uh uh pigs, cows to the German that come like every month. They have\nto give so much to the German, so that the reason their their farm survive because uh\nproduce, they give it to to German, so the two brother uh was in and the two brother in\nTarnow that have the tailor shop, they survive uh and only one brother uh son die after\nwounded and one brother in Warsaw also survive and his daughter died during 1945,\nduring uprising. All my uh five brother uh survived and they was in uh in Poland. They\nworking like different places, but they survived except the two two kids.

        "A: Well, uh change uh dramatically because uh I want to go to school and I couldn't go to\nschool, so uh I study at home and I study uh with uh professor uh private privately\nbecause uh German uh take out, uh throw out professor from university, from Krackow,\nfrom _ and uh send some to concentration camp and some sent to our place and uh we\nhave to uh take care of them. Was two professor in my father's place, so we have to give\nthem food and uh shelter, cause there was all this two men, so I have an advantage that\nthey teach me uh during uh 1939 and during '40, because I was prepare for uh higher\neducation, so they teach me. Then after the the German take them anyway in 1940. And\nthere was uh first few months when German take over, was uh was quiet. Uh they put,\nposted all over be calm, go back to work, uh everything be OK. Then then uh everybody\nhave to go register, have to have an have an ID card. Then after that the German\nadvertising, uh 19...beginning of 1940, they advertising to work in Germany. Mass uh\nadvertising that they needed...they say they have a good pay and so so but nobody want\nto go. Only people work in the Tarnow wherever there was industry, in the Tarnow...in\nsome...the German opened the industry and make the people was before, but other\npeople, they have no no work. There was no any other care uh only go to Germany to\nwork, no other living. So some people go to underground to ;\nunderground...(Cough)...Excuse me...uh against uh German or they go to woods to live,\nhiding, and do a sabotage against German, uh start uh start uh be against uh sabotaging\nand against the German...1940. But there was uh not...they was organized but it was hard\nbecause it was a cold winter and uh and uh German was powerful, have a motorized car\nand and motorcycle and go all over, so people escape. Go to woods and uh and that way\nsurvive. Uh and the farmer would feed them but uh that was 1940. Then they start\narresting uh people. First uh they put in the city hall all the name, because they have it\nfrom ID cards, they have the name who you are and they wanted so many people uh\nreport and go to Germany to work who have no way to live to go, uh to go by themselves.\nThey go register because they have no way to live, like in the city have no no food or\nnothing so so they go...some people went and went to Germany to work. But not so\nmany, so after they start arresting on the street uh just...Gestapo have uh on truck a\ndozen. Then the car stop on any of the street. Two two trucks, uh pick-up truck when it\nwas with the Gestapo...one on the beginning of the street, on another. Stop the traffic and\ntake all the people on the street. Uh young young young most of them...they look for\nthem that be work for...and they put on the truck and sent to uh sent where there were\nexamination and they sent to Germany to work for uh slave labor, forced labor labor\ncamp in Germany, and during uh this uh 1940, the occupation, uh we have a flier that\nwas come from England or uh or through underground all situation how 1s work German\nare and uh the people organize underground a a campaign against German, and uh all\nthe...because a printing shop was all closed when the German take over, put people do by\nby uh called small, hand...uh by hand printed, so and uh we have a message what's going\non from already the underground who already have. Then they print some note and we\ngive a message to people, but if uh if they catch you, German, then uh then you sometime\nthey kill you on the spot or send you...",
        "A: Uh yes, my brother was involved in the Tarnow and I don't...still don't know how he got\ninvolved because there was always was secret and even never told me where he get it,\nhow he get it...just told...he give me a few uh bundle of them and uh take down to to\ndown where...and give people at the church, on on the village or wherever wherever he\nsent me, but I was uh...he give me a basket. There was a bundle of of the leaflets in a\nsmall basket like a fruit basket and on the top is hay and I put rabbits, and that's how I\ntransport uh message, because if...excuse me...(pause)...uh that way I transferred the\nmessage in the basket with rabbits because when the when the Germans stop me on\nthe...always was a patrol on the street...when they stop me, they look the rabbits and kick\nme and and I just hold it that they don't fall out...1t was tight...because they don't like the\nrabbit. That way I went through and I was always dressed ragged uh there be...there be no\nsuspicion that I something, you know. Also that way uh in another city, like in Tarnow,\nthere was short on food. There was ration of food and so we, from the farm, we bring to\nmy brother food that way uh just on the bicycle or I walk with the basket...put bread and\nuh salt pork and uh butter...also same way. Uh have a big basket, put on the bottom and\nput hay on the top and rabbits on the top, because if you have open and and uh German\nlook uh they'll take it, so uh we transferred the food uh to to my brother and uh my\nbrother live in Tarnow, two of them. Neighbor was Jew, people where he was before\nwork, before war he was work with them...also that they was still make the dress uh but\nfor the store also, but the the Jew was uh persecuting and uh and uh buying...they can't go\nout. They have to have a a Star of David uh on their uh clothes and uh in Tarnow...that's\nbeginning of 1940 and '41, so 1940. And uh my brother helped them uh with the with the\nfood, because he also...my brother come, two of them, they come uh to my father and\nthey transport the food to to town. Many time uh when they have a bigger amount, like\npotatoes or something, when uh when they got to the house, the German uh Gestapo\nspotted and uh they got beaten because they they know the Jew was live over there next\ndoor, so my bro...I was beaten a couple of times too, because they they saw me come out\nfrom the building where Jew was and uh somehow they know it and say are you a Jew. I\nsay no, I have ID. So so uh they kick me, say what you do over there, you know. I say\nnothing, you know. Uh I I want buy some thread because I always had some little item\nfor excuse what I what I was doing, because if you have nothing uh then then you're\nsuspicious, so I have a little thread or some small item that uh to or even button, you\nknow, because they have a store or or no...only small item, so that way uh that way I go\naway with this partisan you know...",
        "A: Well, then...that was 1940. I was twice arrested on the street because uh many time when\nI saw what's going on I...when uh was arresting...we we can see how they stop so I know\nwhich which way to run away to one one house and go outside on another street, but uh\ntwice the the block so tight I cannot escape so I was arrested, put on the on the\ntruck...usually the Gestapo. The Gestapo was special uh German police. They have a...on\nthe front...they black uniform some and some they are grey uh and have a big under like a\nSS underneath, under Polish sign...special po...police. They have the power to kill you on\nthe spot. You can do nothing, so uh they put on the truck, a pick-up truck, uh how many\nthey can fitted...young people, then they go to the railway station...that was not far...and\nput on the wagon uh wherever was wagon. Usually was uh cattle but they usually...they\ndon't do uh no more they usually do for concentration camp. They put on...they call third-\nclass wagon, and lock personal (ph) and uh about a hundred people and then uh train go\nto Krackow and over there also we have to walk with the Gestapo to check point. Check\npoint in the Krackow was in a big school because all school was closed. There was no no\nteaching during the occupation. Only...they only allowed first grade, first couple grades\nof public school and not not high school. There was...high school was empty. They using\nfor transportation checkpoint, so there was hundred people and with no room to sleep or\nnothing. They will stand up in in each hall or class and uh have a kitchen, so they have\nsomething to eat, and they go through examination...doctor, German doctor examine each\none and if alright go to next room and uh shave close all, everything, uh arm and all over,\nand uh put back clothes, get in and go another room and put on a train again. Another\ntrip, you know, twenty or a hundred...1t depends how many they selected and sent to\nGermany to work. So twice I was arrested. Twice I was...once I was shaved uh but he say\nyou no have no...you have clean hair so you'll be alright...the barber said. Then I escaped\ntwice in Krackow because there was so many people so I was able to escape and my\nbrother would know it and help me. He know what happened in Tarnow so he went uh\nand he helped me, so I come back home, but uh third time there was uh...it was so strictly\nuh tight uh guards I couldn't escape and uh then uh they send me to with other about\ntwenty all just men...young all, not...well, healthy men...about twenty, to...uh all we\ntraveled on the train all through Germany to a place named Hanover (ph) _\u2014_\u2014_\u2014s and uh we\nlanding 1n a in a place they called . It was industry, uh German industry that\nmake all the war industry...hundred and sixty thousand slave work workers who was over\nthere, and all different labor camp, all nationality and uh they put me in the one camp. It\nwas a labor...forced forced labor camp. They call and uh there was about uh a\nfew thousand Poles in that one camp. Now we don't know each other because there was\nstrictly to uh...we know where we come from but we was working and there was\nconstruction company. He take care, say twenty-five people are selected from the group\nand I was with the with the group to one construction company and and that construction\ncompany make shelter, bunker...uh shelter against air attack. Uh they make of cement a\nShel...shelter. Thick...about uh uh two meter...that's almost two yard thick wall and four\nstory and uh very strong cement enforced with iron and the capacity for five thousand\npeople, and when there was...there was prepared for war when the American and English\nbomb after, the bombs slide through. Nothing...because because that's two and a half\nmeter uh cement, so almost two yards thick cement walls around and uh that...they have\ninside uh prepare for electricity, water, everything. They they was prepared for for long\nwar, so I was in there camp labor, in the construction for almost...over four year, till\n1945. It was terrible uh...1t was hard work. Uh in the morning uh our company, the\nconstruction company, uh would have a pick-up truck, open pick-up truck, double. They\ncome to barrack where we live and we we already was standing over there waiting for\nthem, and we go on them. They take us to the place, about a couple mile, to make the\nshelter and also the construction uh company, uh German supervisor, German, but they\nusing all the slave people like me, uh Polish, Italian, French, but Pole was uh separated\nuh. And also they take us sometime when there was bomb during day or night, so after\nbomb they take us to clean up the street but we can't touch the dead bodies of German or\nany object. Uh we'll get shot. We we find some dead...we have to tell them and the\nGerman take them and then we clean up the uh because it was from bomb, the destroy\nhouse was all over the street, so we have to clean the street so truck can go through, and\nwe go back to work. Uh our regular work was uh make the shelter, bunker they call it. Uh\nsometime we start twelve hours a day because uh they make a hugh uh cement mixer\nmachine motor and we fit uh with sand and cement and it was twelve hours sometime\nwork. Some...uh six day, and after work they take us to uh to camp where we sleep.\nThere was a barrack, wood barrack, and each uh room was about twenty uh bed, bunk\nbed like a wood box and was small and and a locker room so each one have a locker and\nwe have some item, what you have items. You have a bow], a round, half round uh bowl,\nmetal for eat and a spoon and and uh card uh where they give you a ration card stamped\nso you have to take it and when they bring to camp, you go wash. You go room. Wash\nyourself and go in the mess (ph) room and wait for uh for the in the big kitchen and they\nopen up the window. You give them the stamp and you get one...uh then you go another\nwindow and you get little bread. And you eat this and after one hour you're hungry and\nyou have nothing in the morning. In the morning you get coffee, but the coffee was made\nof hickory, sour like uh...something how. And lunch time nothing, only the evening.\nThat's what uh that's what it was, day after day and uh uh the food was from beginning\nwas a little bit more but uh 1943, '44, '45 was they cut the bread ration so was very, very\nhungry. Uh all the time...hunger is the worst thing for a human being.",
        "A: Uh Sunday...uh sometime we have to work Sunday, but usually it was in uh we stay in\nthe barrack. We clean. We clean up the uh...sometime...it's a big washroom, so we wash\nclothes. Uh but there was no no detergent, so they don't clean the _, so...because we\nget uh only three months we get some clothes, like like underwear. Not regular like\nnormal people. Just some funny uh special-make for us. You know, they would...because\nwe wouldn't escape and go outside the camp. Beside that, when I get...uh everyone, when\nwe get to Germany, we have aa the company take so many guys, you know, people uh\nmen or woman, separate woman uh men separate, and every Pole like me they give us a\nlittle cloth like two, three inch square with name P and you have to put on the right uh\nside of your jacket, jacket and on the shirt and you have to sew yourself and you have to\nhave all the time. If you don't have this, you get beaten very uh very strong and this was\nP for marked for Polish and I was one of the two million Polish citizens that was taken by\nforce to Germany to forced labor camp and uh was all over in Germany, our people was\nstay over there work. Like me...I was...happened that I land in a construction company,\nwhat I say before. Uh now they call worker.",
        "A: Yes. There was...the camp was uh...there was about twen...twenty barracks. Each\nbarracks hold about hundred people and uh wood barracks, and they was guarded. It was\nwire around. Not electric wire like some places, but there was guards. You can't get out.\nUh when you get out, uh where you going to go? You you have no...you have a funny\nclothes. You have work clothes and the clothes is not uh normal clothes. Is uh special\nmake like uh color brown or in other ways they recognize you you not German, and\nbecause they was in in was Germany, and uh besides that, you have to have uh the P on\nthe right side of your jacket, so you you you...when you go out...some...sometime we\nhave to ask permission go out uh repair the shoe, uh to get shoemaker uh or or buy the\nshoe, so uh you have to walk on the right side of the street and you you can't go in a store\nwhere food is. They won't allow you. That's why we have to have the P. When the\nthe...you cannot you cannot escape. What people try escape that change...the the finer\nclothes, you know, but uh they're they're finer, because they was in in Germany. They\nwas not in Poland. That's...",
        "A: Uh, well uh in uh when we was working, there was so many uh people, Poles and other\nnationality, Italian, French, and the...we don't talk much because uh German was like\nbosses and watchmen...was few watchmen with uh with weapons that you don't escape,\nand uh we we just have...we can't talk uh much. If you talk right away they see you and\nuh you get you get hit, so uh we we just have to uh work. We talk to each other very\nlow...we we talked...we Polish...yeah, but not not hear, the German hear. And they\nalways uh they watch us what we do good job and if we do something wrong, then you\nget uh you get very bad beaten with the shovel or with the rifle. Sometime...uh one day I\nhave to bring uh cement from uh uh train...the two guy take it, a bag of cement and put on\nyour shoulder and you go to the to storage. You have to run. Uh when it was rained, it\nwas mess. Then if the bag of cement break then you get beaten, so...1t is not your fault but\nyou have to be careful, so they they was very strictly about uh sabotage. We couldn't do\nsabotage in in Germany, because uh even if you try, it cost your life and was not in\nPoland it was...yeah, it was different. It was organized and it was underground but here\nwas uh constantly watched by by Germans.",
        "A: Oh yes. Uh yes. Well, uh we don't know what uh what kind of sickness...uh was cold.\nMostly everybody have a cold and others...and TB...then after we find out, after\nliberation we find out that half of them have the TB. Then they went to Poland. I don't\nhave it, TB, but uh tuberculosis, because there was a bad hunger and bad weather\nconditions and work with water (ph)...I have a still...now I have arthritis all over because\nI was for the so many days in the water where we was also do something, broken water\npipe...we had to stay in up to here 1n in winter time in water and fix it, so there was aa\nbad condition but many of oldest...I remember, oldest uh Polish workers, slave\nworker...they couldn't work so we helped them. We had to work double to help them to to\nsurvive. When he when he pass out, he faint, we have to take him on a truck to take him\nout. We never know afterward what happened to him. We never find out. That's what\nwe...they told us...when you will fall out, you you fall out. You don't come back.",
        "A: Oh yes, some. Some German...yes. Some uh some German...what they have a lunch...at\nlunch time they have a half hour off...1f there was some construction uh constantly to\nhave a change, like twenty minutes, but sometimes we have a half hour lunch, because\nGerman like to eat, so to to eat and we sit down and drink water. So sometimes they uh\nthey give me a little bread or apple. Uh uh was few of them uh was was like uh like\nhumans, you know, because they saw that we was skinny and and hungry. They say why\nyou no eat. I say we...I had a little bread last night. That's all and I get tonight. (Laughter)\nSo and also uh was uh 1944...there was one engineer. He was very...was uh German...was\na very intelligent guy and he uh he always asked me, noon, noon....lunch time where I\ncome from, like my family, if I have a letter from my family, because I was seventeen\nyear old, eighteen. So ...\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE\n..the name was...(pause)...OK...there was one engineer, German. He was helping me uh\ngive me little food, bread, and uh he also asked me if I can come Sunday to his house in\nin uh spring and garden. So he have a little garden. He don't know how to do good. He\nwanted to put a garden, but I say, you know, I can't come because I get, you know, I get\nbeaten. Don't worry about it, you know. So I went and I uh fixed the garden, so he give\nme bread and it was Sunday when I have that free, you know, because it was uh not far\nfrom my labor camp where I sleep. I asked permission to go and uh to come back, so they\nknow I come back anyway, so he name...his name was uh \u2014\u2014__ Meyer (ph) and uh after\n(cough)...there was a few time he helped me and after war we met because was not far\nand uh he told me was arrested for for associate while helping uh Pole but he don't told\nme about he was big smart engineer so he would fight with them and they let him go.\nAnd uh that and he let him...they let him go and he also saved me the because if he was\nuh uh bad, uh they could take me and uh also people like that who come out uh on the\noutside the camp, the labor camp where we stayed, and uh without uh, you know, come\nback and go with the German, you get really bad...they take you to called lager, uh\nstrict uh camp for two weeks. When you you lived there two weeks, you are lucky....but\nuh I when I never uh happened. Many of guys went uh take our Polish prisoner...were\nprisoner we call because was slave labor. One guy, he was fighting with the Germans\nbecause uh it was was something was wrong and the German was...they both was blame\nhim, so he said...then he was fight...1t was just verbal fight, so he got mad and uh next\ncouple minute we see car come with the black uniform...Gestapo take him and he never\ncome back. Young...nineteen year old.\nPAUSE",
        "A: Uh after I was uh arrested first two times, we know the the getting worse and and uh my\nuh we get contact in Poland in case you...they send you to to Germany, so uh uh we\nsomehow, you know, get a contact, so when uh when I was arrested and put in the labor\ncamp, there was allowed once a month post card to your family, and uh I sent. They they\ngot it and my parents, they have the postcard, but that was a thousand miles from home\nwhere I was, and uh then I got back. They send me postcard but they don't they don't\nsay...you can't say much and uh they try to send uh three box. You you only can send\nnothing, only dry bread. I only receive one uh big package __, dry bread. Otherwise\nyou can...uh the German con...confiscated because Germany needed their own , but\nI uh I receive once a while, every few months...but not...we don't receive from Red Cross.\nIn the concentration camp like like uh big concen...extermination camp, Dachau and\n...the people uh the Red Red Cross send over there, because 1t was famous and\nso there was a political...yes...but where we was, there was so many thousand and\nthousand. We starve uh terribly. We we had no no way, and uh on... remember some\nsometimes the truck broke so we had to walk to barracks, but uh one guard was in the\nfront and one in the back and we we walked through through the street and uh there\nwas...1 remember there was October or something...there was apple on the street. We pick\nup the apple...oh boy...we got beaten, you know. You know, we can't pick up the apple,\nand it was on on the street.",
        "A: Uh yes, because German feed us with uh newspaper, with the German newspaper, and we\nuh...reading the newspaper, we know where fighting, what happened in Russia, what\nhappened in....uh and we we realized what is going on because they always...they say uh\nwhere the front is and uh so we were uh about then, but no other communication. No\nradio because there was uh impossible because there was uh...against...1t was imposs...uh\nhard to even to uh to...we can't have a radio or nothing, no. Only only the German\nnewspaper. Then when there was uh uh start bombing, American and English uh so we\nwas happy because we see the...you know, American bomber and dozens of them, but\nthere was...was very hard. There was burning and uh explosion and of course was\nGerman was fighting uh terr..terribly but after was American and English take over, like\n1944...there was day and night there was bombing and also our our people got killed too\nbecause they bomb next to uh industry where we are, where we was and they hit the\nbarrack. It burned. I was burned on on my one arm from the from the , from the\nbomb, but we have to extinguish and my arm. When there was alarm, when American\nbomb come or night and there was a siren, so the German go to the bunker, to the shelter\nand we we stay in the barrack. We can't go no place. So go under the bed. (laughter) Or\nwe go...because no no cellar or nothing.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Well, there was over four years terrible hard work and far away from from family and\nwith strange people, and most of them was uh were hardened with hunger because it\nwas...everyday was uh think about uh bad...was was uh hunger all the time because it was\nvery short of food. That was the worst part was during the the slave uh labor work in\nGermany. But I am uh sur...survived. Uh I don't regret or blame uh . There was war\nso I uh we we try...everyday we hope the war will finish and uh we be free.",
        "A: Well uh on April 1945 uh we uh we know the American not far. We already hear uh uh\nshooting and uh and it was in the paper, newspaper that the German give us\nnewspaper...they always say where where they are, where the American and English are.\nAnd uh the German advise to the German to hide their last men, so so and also uh uh\nwere of us, the __, like Polish and all other prisoners, because afraid of uh we do the\nrevenge, so uh come April 12th, we we spot American tank and uh tank go by...one, two,\nthree. We...and uh it was in the morning and first we knew, we go after the guard,\nbecause the barrack where we stay by the gate was the barrack and by the gate is more\nfood and all ammunition and a guard and everything. We went over there. There's\nnobody there. The the guard, the German escape away before we don't even know it.\nThey left some empty uh rifle in the window and it look like they there. And uh so uh\nAmerican uh uh 9th Army came. First there was very __ because people when they go\nhome and was a thousand mile, kilometer from uh where I was, like , it's now\nWest Germany...to my town is too far, so uh we stay in the camp and there come\norganization uh International Organization for Refugee...they call UNRA...and uh we put\nall together uh like in the one camp the Polish uh refugee in the one camp. Same camp\nwhere we where we was, but we clean up. We was uh free. We have a kitchen, but we\nhave to do everything by own. Uh kitchen...we have to have...people have to work uh by\nuh in order to to survive...do everything by themselves in the camp. Uh uh there was\nalso...we org...we organized school and chapel. We have a a priest. Many priest was\nliberated from Dachau concentration camp, so they come and the one we have in our\ncamp, and I was work with him in the school, in the church because also was so many\nfamilies the German take to work on the farm, so they left the farm when the American\ncame and they come to camp. They call this place displaced person camp, DP camp in in\nWest Germany, and there was under English occupied zone, but there was very\nstrictly...uh we can do what we want but we can't go to Poland because it was uh Russia\noccupied Poland and was different government under Russian uh Russian, so many\npeople take uh chance and go back to Poland and many of them wait in the camp for uh\nimmigration so meantime I uh start school. There was also uh like a professor,\nprofessional people, so I take examination and I pass and I uh receive a a diploma for\nteaching and we organize school and there was about...uh the camp where I was,\ndisplaced person camp, there was about two thousand, over two thousand Polish persons,\nuh men, women, children. Uh men like single they separate and uh lady, girl separate and\nfamily live together, also in the barrack, and uh about a hundred and twenty children, so I\nwas teaching in the grammar uh level in the school there was in the camp too, and uh like\nI say organize Scouts. I was the scoutmaster. There was life like a little community 1n uh\nin the camp, because everybody have to uh work how...uh wherever he wanted, in the\nkitchen or in a guard, because we have to guard the camp uh just order, you know, like\nself uh self-organization, and we go out to uh German town. We can uh if we have the\nmoney we buy something or but nothing too big because we have no money and there\nwas _____ was bad. The food uh we get uh we have ration also because uh Germany\neconomy was bad and uh and uh international organization supply uh make the German\nsupply some food for for us fora few _, so there was a short of everything but uh uh\nbecause it was free so so we survived and everybody was waiting for uh\nimmi...going...1mmigrate, go to Canada or United States or Australia. Whoever have aa\nrelatives in uh United States or or Canada so so ask for signed papers, so then you wait\nand you get them, but uh see I wrote uh to home because uh many people go to\nPoland...(pause)...especially like a big family because there was not so good in a in a one\nroom, whole family in a wooden camp, so they went to back to Poland and they write to\nus back uh you better try and go some other...find another country because Poland is now\noccupied by Russia and different government, but it's different situation. So uh I wrote to\nhome and my mother wrote wrote my letter to me. I have...after a few months, long long\ntime, she advised to uh see her sister because uh I say maybe I come back home, back to\nSmidgnow, so she write see my sister in . That's all she write, because there was a\nletter was censored. The communists censor the letter and uh her, my mother's sister live\nin Connecticut and brother too. My bro...my mother's sister and my and brother was in\nConnecticut, so my mother give me a clue...don't go back to Poland. Go to United States,\nso I write...the next time, next letter there was, have address and next third letter was\nanother have address to uh Derby, Connecticut, so I have a full address and I wrote to uh\nto my aunt in Derby, Connecticut and an uncle and also my mother write to them in\nUnited States to ask them to uh help me, to bring me to United States but uh uh my\nmother, she was suggest uh I finish school so that was not so easy for them, my uncle and\naunt to supply me for for college education, so so I was waiting for a visa five year, and\nduring the five year I was teaching in a displaced person camp in Polish school and\nPolish Boy Scouts. Then came 1950, and I uh...came paper from Chicago. I was working\nwith one priest in Germany after war, so he was uh in our camp. He went to Chicago year\nbefore and he sent a visa through his organization from Chicago to for me in 1950 in\nDecember. I uh I came to New York and to Chicago to...uh there was Jesuit priest in uh\nChicago to have a publishing culture, religion newspaper monthly, so I was working in\noffice and there was work for me for one month, but uh I want to see my aunt in\nConnecticut so I came to Connecticut and I stayed uh in Connecticut, still in same place\nin Connecticut, Derby, Connecticut.",
        "A: My parents, yes, survived but they have they are older and they live on a farm and uh\nthey have to give uh uh pigs, cows to the German that come like every month. They have\nto give so much to the German, so that the reason their their farm survive because uh\nproduce, they give it to to German, so the two brother uh was in and the two brother in\nTarnow that have the tailor shop, they survive uh and only one brother uh son die after\nwounded and one brother in Warsaw also survive and his daughter died during 1945,\nduring uprising. All my uh five brother uh survived and they was in uh in Poland. They\nworking like different places, but they survived except the two two kids. And all my\nparents now...they all pass away and my four uh brother pass away. Only one brother is\nliving in a place where I...by Tarnow.",
