        "Question: Good morning, Lore.",
        "Answer: Good morning, Joan.",
        "Q: It\u2019s nice to see you. Tell me what -- what your name was -- what -- what is your name\nnow?",
        "A: My name now 1s Lore Segal.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: I was born Lore Groszmann.",
        "Q: But it was Lore?",
        "A: It was Lore, and nobody can pronounce it the way my mother did, which is Loourie,\nyou see, is the Austrian way to do it.",
        "Q: So, it was a very long O.",
        "A: In -- and in -- while I lived in England, I was Lorry, like a truck. But now people ask\nme how to pronounce it and I say o-open season, any --",
        "Q: O -- and what was your date of birth?",
        "A: March 8\", 1928.",
        "Q: Now tell me something. This 1s, for me, somewhat odd way to start, but you wrote a\nnovel about your -- about your experiences in Vienna and going to England. Why did you\ndecide to write a novel and not a memoir?",
        "A: Because I was really less interested in the history than in being a writer. And for many\nyears -- [ -- I have written little stories before that, and I came to the point in my 20\u2019s\nwhen it seemed to me I had no subject. I hadn\u2019t been in love, I hadn\u2019t died. None of the\nbig events had happened to me, and I wanted to be writing. And it seemed to me that\nthese stories that I did have with -- my experiences were a dime a dozen, everybody knew\nabout them. And then one day I -- when 1-in -- in my early days in New York, I had gone\nto the new school and taken a course in creative writing, and we -- the people in that class\nhad a s -- had a -- had a party. And somebody said to me, how did you come to the\nUnited States? And I began to tell my -- my Hitler stories. And there was that silence in\nthe room that I have since had as a teacher, but hadn\u2019t experienced at that time. I thought,\ngee, wow, I have stories to tell and it a -- and -- and it came to me that these stories were\nmy subject. But again, I wa -- didn\u2019t write them because I wanted to -- what I think 1s\nnow known as bearing witness. I wanted to be writing. And I -- I mean another answer is\nthat as a novelist you can in a way -- it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, it\u2019s a truism, but you can be truer that\nyou can --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- by sticking to the facts. Can I give you an example of --",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: -- how writing as a novelist changed what might be a fact. One of the -- one of the\nchapters in \u201cOther People\u2019s Houses\u201d was about my attraction for awhile to the stories of\nChristianity. No-Notice that I\u2019m -- it\u2019s the stories that attracted me. Now, in the chapter\nabout this in \u201cOther People\u2019s Houses\u201d, I made it may -- the narrative seems to suggest\nthat it was the people in -- my foster parents at the -- of the time, my foster -- two -- two\nfoster mothers tried to convert me. And when they got to -- when th -- one of them at any\nrate, read the story, s -- read the book, she wrote me and said, but we never tried to\nconvert you. And I wrote back and said absolutely not, you didn\u2019t. But for an -- for a\nstory, to be seduced by a person is more -- 1s a be -- it\u2019s a better story than being seduced\nby an idea. In fact, it\u2019s almost impossible novelisticly to write that. So novels suit me\nbetter than history, or biography, or auto-biography. It\u2019s a long answer.",
        "Q: No, it\u2019s very -- it\u2019s very interesting. So is -- is doing an interview somewhat\nproblematic for you because you are not being a novelist now, when I ask you questions?",
        "A: Oh, no. I will try and answer you historically. But I -- as we were saying earlier, once\nyou have actually written something, or even told it a lot, something has happened to it.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: It -- 1t becomes overlaid with, I guess a skin. Like an anecdote gets a kind of polish on\nit that is almost impossible to --",
        "Q: To remove that skin.",
        "A: -- to remove that skin and get back. But it\u2019s an interesting thing to do. I think it\u2019s what\none would do in -- in analysis, I think. When you\u2019ve got -- you -- you go back to -- to the\n-- to the -- to the -- to the -- I want to say real, but you go back to the -- to the event as it\nhappened, or try to. And that\u2019s an interesting -- so this is interesting thing to do. I don\u2019t\nknow how -- how well I can unpack what was -- what was wrapped up.",
        "Q: Well, we-we\u2019ll divide our -- our -- your story into a few parts. So let\u2019s -- we\u2019ll go from\n28 to 38 bef -- before you actually leave Vienna. So when you think about your parents as\na kid, what is your -- what is your earliest memory of being in Vienna? How -- how far\nback do you go? Cause you\u2019re born in 1928. Are you five, are you four, are you six,\neight? Do you have --",
        "A: Well, once again, as -- as with all those memories, I don\u2019t know what are the\nmemories, and what are the stories told me.",
        "Q: Mm, mm.",
        "A: I mean, I have a lot of memories being a cute kid, very cute, and very much beloved. I\nwas the only grandchild, the only child, the only grandchild, the only niece of two loving\nuncles. So I was a big deal. I will tell you the embarrassing story which explains this. My\nmother loved to tell the story against -- she felt 1t a story against herself, that she took me\nwith her to a ladies\u2019 caf\u00e9 yousa, a -- a coffee klatch. And all the ladies were talking with\neach other and at the end, as my little coat was being put on, I was reported to have said,\nhere one knows nothing, here one speaks of nothing. I might have been five, or six. And\nmy mother said, what do you mean? And I said, here they don\u2019t know that I dance on my\ntoes. Here they don\u2019t know that I -- I can do the figure eight on the ice. No, I must have\nbeen older, seven -- six or seven [indecipherable]. And my mother was embarrassed and\nrealized that I had been made too much of, and too much admired and too much praise.\nBut I always thought that I\u2019m incredibly lucky to have been brought up by two of the best\npeople in the world that I know. My mother and my Uncle Paul, who -- who were both\nwitty, loving, very, very, very much attached to me. Gave me a lot of space to show off.\nThat was a world in which my poor very lar -- father, who was a six-footer, which was\nunusual for -- for a European Jew, I think, who was a -- who was an accountant, a chief\naccountant in the Bank of Cooksbrock and company, was an outsider. He was odd man\nout. He was not able to laugh, he was not able to participate in the fun that we had before\nhe walked in the door. He was very dear and very lacking in imagination and became,\nwhen I was five -- this certainly is a datable event, and one that I remember, became very\nill. He was a bleeder.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: I suppose not th-the worst degree of bleeder, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have survived, but\nhe\u2019s -- he was taking my mother is the story, for a bicycle ride along the [indecipherable]\nthe -- the dia -- the Danube -- I don\u2019t know what an [indecipherable] what -- what -- what\n-- what broke down -- wh-what -- what is -- what is supposed to hold the water in?",
        "Q: Dike?",
        "A: Yeah. Anyhow, it was a long road, and they were -- they were riding along it and\nsome partridges -- he saw some partridges and he took his hands off the bicycle and\nclapped and fell off and began to bleed. And I remember we were in my grandfather\u2019s\nhouse in the village of Fischamend, which is some half an hour by train from Vienna.\nVery close now, 10 minutes now from the modern V-Vienna airport, and th-that my\ngrandfather had a house on the main square of the village, a huge house with a store, with\nmy grandfather\u2019s straggled store at the bottom. And I remember my parents had their\nown room back there. My father -- remember my father flat on -- on the bed. He had -- he\n-- J-I remember particular that he was not allowed to have a -- a pillow, and oddly enough\nI cannot bear to lie for two seconds without a pillow under my head. But that -- he --\nthere was a bucket of ice water next to his bed with little balls of butter which he was\nsupposed to eat. I don\u2019t remem -- I have no idea what kind of a theory that was, but that\nwas -- that\u2019s certainly one of my earliest memories of going to see my father lying flat.\nAnd it was really from that moment on that he was essentially -- well, in and out of\nhospital is overstating it, but I -- I do remember coming home from school and my\nmother saying, put -- don\u2019t take off your coat, we\u2019re going to go see Daddy, who was\nonce again in the hospital, always with his head flat on the -- on the -- on the white sheet.\nMy mother was always cooking diet for him. I think one of the -- one of the perhaps\nmistakes my mother made in her very, very lovely relation with me is to use me as a\nfriend to c -- to -- to co -- to have headaches with and to complain of my father\u2019s illness,\nwhich stood for a lot of other weakness and incapacity, I think.",
        "Q: So your -- your relationship to your father never became as close as your relationship\nwith your mother?",
        "A: It was not -- my relationship to my father was one of regret, that I was not responding\nadequately to the affection he had for me. I understood that I was not responding, and I re\n-- | was sorry for him. So was a g -- and my -- th-the man in my life was my Uncle Paul,\nwho was then --",
        "Q: Not your father.",
        "A: -- seven years younger than my mother, who lived with us while he went to the -- to\nstudy at the -- at medic -- at the school of medicine, a -- ma -- University of lon -- of\nVienna, and lived with us and read stories to me and played the guitar for me and told me\nabout things like -- I remember that he had a professor called Professor Tort -- I mean,\nProfessor Death, and he told me about -- I -- I can\u2019t think of the word now, hypo -- hyp --\nhypnosis. I mean, here I was in my -- about seven years old, learning these fascinating\nthings from my uncle, who would sit by my bedside and tell me -- tell me -- tell me about\nthe world.",
        "Q: Right. Was your father jealous of Paul?",
        "A: My father wooed me. He wooed me by taking me out for ice cream, and my mother\nhad told us not to have ice cream, it would spoil my lunch. It was always something the\nmatter with what -- what my poor father did. I have a curious memory around the\nChristmastime and Vienna was full of -- of Christmas things. My father said, I\u2019ll take you\nacross the street to look into the toy shop, because it has a Father Christmas there, a Santa\nClaus. And I said, I\u2019ve already seen it. And I st -- to this day I regret not giving him the\nsatisfaction of being able to --",
        "Q: To take you.",
        "A: -- give me something that I might enjoy. These are -- I mean, the -- in fact, my\nrelationship to my father seems very vivid, but it is not a -- not a -- it is always a little\nsad. And of course, he became very ill. As soon -- when we -- when we came to England\n-- one of the chapters in my book is called \u201cThe Alien\u2019, and what it\u2019s about is my father\nbeing ill in a foreign country.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know what it\u2019s like if you\u2019re not home and you have a cold?",
        "Q: It\u2019s terrible.",
        "A: And here he was, being ill in a w -- in a world -- you know, he was -- he was supposed\nto be the one who knew English, but when we came to a -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m jumping to the next\nchapter --",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay, right.",
        "A: -- but when we came to England it was my mother who promptly learned the\nlanguage, who managed to do all the things that needed doing -- my father, who was\nincapacitated, only partly because of his illness.",
        "Q: So did he know English in Vienna?",
        "A: He knew English, but he didn\u2019t know it when he got to England.",
        "Q: England. But he -- so did you learn some English as a kid, before you left?",
        "A: I did, es -- I -- we had English -- English lessons in clu -- in school.",
        "Q: In school.",
        "A: Which I don\u2019t think that did very much except introduce a couple of --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- of words, which always seemed to me very peculiarly spelled. I went around saying\npictooray. How can that be picture?",
        "Q: Pictooray [indecipherable]",
        "A: It makes no sense. Picstooray.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: [indecipherable]. But then when Hitler came, my cousin Inga and I were sent to a\nyoung lady, a young English lady who struck me as alien for two reasons. She was not\nCatholic. It struck me. I understood, I learned that she was something else, she was\nProtestant, which seemed to me very peculiar, because 1n -- 1n -- in -- in the other people,\nthe other world in -- in -- in Vienna was Catholic.",
        "Q: Catholic.",
        "A: And the other thing is that when my friend, my cousin Inga and I came outside to go\nhome, outside they waited for her -- her -- her boyfriend, who was a nats -- an SS man.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you like school when you went, as a kid?",
        "A: You know, I remember loving school, but when I think back of it, \u2019'm not so sure. I\nremember when my children were small and I would go with them or pick them up and I\nwalked into the school, I had a real yucky feeling and I realized, did I really like school?\nI\u2019m not so sure.",
        "Q: You\u2019re not so sure.",
        "A: That\u2019s for sure.",
        "Q: So what do you re -- what do you remember about it? Do you remem -- did you like ta",
        "A: About school?",
        "Q: Yeah, did you like teach --",
        "A: Oh, I was -- I was -- I was -- I was the good -- I was a good student.",
        "Q: I imagine.",
        "A: I was a very good student and I was a prig. I remember the first time I talk -- well in --\nin -- ina Viennese school -- let me tell you about the Viennese school. You sat at a desk\nin pairs and you had your hands like this. I have to show it. Yeah, I know that, yeah. Like\nthis.",
        "Q: Like that, right.",
        "A: Your thumb was underneath the desk and your hands were -- I don\u2019t know what they\nthought you would do with your hands if you let them loose. God knows.",
        "Q: You had to stay like this?",
        "A: You had to stay like this. It seems improbable, but that\u2019s what I remember. And you\ndid not talk to your person sitting next to you. Oh, and if you misbehaved, you had to\nstand next to your desk while the lesson went on. If you were really bad, you stood in the\ncorner. The famous you stand in the corner.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Is that a concept in America --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- standing in the corner?",
        "Q: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Well, we stood in the corner. That hardly ever happened though. But I once spoke to\nmy -- to the child sitting next to me about some practical thing, like do you have a pencil,\nand the teacher said Lore, stand up next to your desk. And I stood up next to my bed and\nI howled. My virginity had been ruined, I was no longer the person who had never stood\nnext to her desk. And the da -- the teacher -- my mother said the teacher afterwards said\nto her, I had to si -- make her sit down, I was frightened that she --",
        "Q: She was howling?",

        "Q: Best friends.",
        "A: -- have best friends, yes. My cousin Inga was my best friend. And a couple of other\nchildren who had come. We -- had play -- play -- play dates. And one of the children\nactually not in my school, but with whom I had a play date is still an acquaintance, is still\na friend. Now, I ha -- married to a Welsh doctor, living in England and that is the one --\nthat\u2019s the one lef -- that\u2019s the one person still -- whom I still know from that period.",
        "Q: Yeah, right. This one --",
        "A: Then there was Ilse.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Who was sent to the camps with her parents, who have diphtheria and was -- was --\nbecame deaf and was gassed.

        "Q: University? Uh-huh.",
        "A: And my mother was a -- was a -- worked in that -- in that bakery.",
        "Q: Huh.",
        "A: And my cousin Inga came to England early because her father had a -- was an\nimporter exporter and had a London partner, so they came out.",

        "A: [indecipherable] only girls, yes.",
        "Q: Is that typical?",
        "A: I think it was universal. I cannot imagine having any school that was mixed. I\u2019m just\nthinking am I -- am | -- no, it was -- it was not mixed.",
        "Q: It was not mixed.",

        "Q: So was it -- was it a very different kind -- do you know this -- wa -- very different kind\nof school than the boys had? Did you -- you had sewing, I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t have that.",
        "A: I have no -- I have no idea about -- about boy\u2019s school except through my Uncle Paul.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Which 1s, of course, a generation, or half a generation earlier, who went to the\ngymnasium.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Which was a different -- different kind of --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- education, yes, I would think.",
        "Q: Was there a lot of talking about politics when you were growing up, before -- before\nHitler comes? Do you hear about Hitler in Germany\u2019? [indecipherable] hear things?",
        "A: Yes, I remember -- I remember -- now here I\u2019m coming across one of those problems\nthat what a -- what -- what I me -- I mean, yes, except in my book, for instance, I start\nwith this event of a dinner where this was discussed, but I\u2019m sure it was discussed\nconstantly. And my Uncle Paul saying we should leave. Now, this is 30-something, if I\nremember it. I mean, I\u2019m born in thirt -- in \u201928 --",

        "A: Is -- y-you know -- you know what the political re-realities were? The Spanish Civil\nWar.",
        "Q: That was more --",
        "A: Over the radio.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: We got our news over the radio, and I remember hearing about the Spanish Civil War\nand having one of those total revelations. There 1s always war. I suddenly knew as a\nchild, there is no place -- time when there isn\u2019t war. I understood that, because I had seen\nthe first World War pictures in my grand -- you know, tv -- a -- postcards with pictures of\nyoung ladies who -- and -- and messages to soldiers. You know, in -- in the sort of\ncircular -- the -- the oval sha -- the oval shape. And I knew about the first World War,\nand here was the Spanish Civil War, and it came to me that war is one of the things tha-\nthat -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s always there in the world.",
        "Q: Did that scare you?",
        "A: And what -- horrified me, as a -- and it was one of those real-realizations that -- that\nstays with you for life. But I do remember my Uncle Paul saying, probably not that\nrealistic, because he didn\u2019t do it either, we should all leave. And my father making fun of\nhim, saying what do you mean leave, where are we going to go? Going to go to the jungle\nand eat coconuts? And I said to my mother, what is go -- and I had that -- you know, that\n-- that -- you know that feeling that the -- the -- the release of gall into your -- into your --\nI don\u2019t know how you can feel gall in you, but that\u2019s the -- that\u2019s the experience I\nremember. And turning to my mother and saying I -- what -- what\u2019s going to happen? Is\nthere going to be a war? And my mother said no, no, no, no, don\u2019t worry. And my\nthinking, okay, I won\u2019t worry. I\u2019m just going to not worry, cause I don\u2019t know how to\nworry. The problem was, when you\u2019re a child -- or not -- when you\u2019re a grown-up too,\nsomebody mentions a calamity, and you kind of believe it, but how do you imagine it?\nWhat -- what is it going to be?",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: What\u2019s going to happen? Who\u2019s going to do what to whom, you know? So, let\u2019s not\nthink about it.",
        "Q: But for you, you did write a sh -- a | -- a -- before the book, I think, on \u201cOther\nPeople\u2019s Houses\u201d, where you start talking about every -- no, it\u2019s something else, but\neverywhere around you is calamity. When you -- when you realize when you had\nchildren --",
        "A: That\u2019s the end of it.",

        "A: I mean, she was not going to be a concert pianist.",

        "A: She wa -- she was a -- did not like to perform, but there were -- there was a piano in\nour house and -- and she wa -- she practiced. She had th-this imagination of -- I mean,\nthere is always -- there was always practicing going on. In fact, I remember her playing\nChopin and say -- an-and -- and I s -- I used to sit and listen, and I thought this was really\nsomething else, this was [indecipherable] lovely. And my mother would say, Chopin is\nnothing to Bach. And I thought, oh Bach -- I didn\u2019t know what Bach was.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "A: Not at all. I find it interesting that my grandparents, my mother\u2019s parents, my\nHungarian born grandparents did not have any notion of Yiddish and had absolutely no\nrelation with -- with the ortho -- orth -- I-I mean, the Orthodoxy is just too far away.

I gather that they were\nOrthodox, or that there was -- you know, everybody you talked to had -- everybody\u2019s\nfather or grandfather was chief rabbi of something. Well, mine were too, except I\u2019ve\nnever -- I\u2019ve never followed through on that.",

        "A: I\u2019m not sure, but I th -- I\u2019m sure they were religious, and that my father said to my\nmother, we are going to have a kosher house, we\u2019re going to have a religious house, and\nmy mother said like -- like how? And then there\u2019s a sort of a nasty story.

        "Q: Every night?",
        "A: Every night. I -- I mean at some point, I -- I was made to say the Shema by my\nmother. I don\u2019t understand it.

        "A: Those were my wild oats, reforming little boys.",
        "Q: So why do you think your mother was having you do the Shema?",
        "A: I cannot imagine, because she was very disappointed in me, in her old age, because I\nbecame fascinated by Hebrew texts.

        "A: Said the Shema in bed, I -- as I remember, yes. I also remember that those high\nholidays that we spent in -- in the -- in the synagogue, I remember sitting with my mother\nupstairs with the women -- must have been a synagogue. It must have been a synagogue.",

But my husband\u2019s -- a-a-and I said, you know, I\nremember the geography. Now, I think this is pretty interesting. We don\u2019t realize that\nwhat makes the impact is not the color of the walls, not the quality of the furniture, but\nthe geography. You walk in, there\u2019s a bathroom here, but the kind of bathroom that\u2019s\nonly a toilet.

        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: It\u2019s in -- interesting that I suppose there was still an assumption, at least in my school,\nfrom the top down I assume, that we were refusing to be annexed by Hitler. On the day\nwe came home after the annexation, they brought big sacks into which we stuffed these\nposters that we had made, very rapidly.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the Jewish children sat in the back.

        "Q: You don\u2019t know where it is.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know where it is. I remember being horrified when they -- the nats -- the young\nNazis came and took my father an -- the men, my father, my uncle and my grandfather to\nthe police station, and I -- to beat them up, I think is too -- too strong a word, but they\ncertainly smacked my father and broke his glasses. And that shocked me. That -- that\nseems to me --",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: It shocked me in a sense that I have a -- a memory of having seen that, which I could\nnot have done because it was done at the police station.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: I remember being frightened because my bed had to be pushed way up against the\nwall away from the windows because they kept throwing stones until all the windows\nwere broken. I mean, that must have terrified me, and yet terror 1s not -- 1s not what I can\ncome up with in memory.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: That\u2019s a -- some kind of failing -- a failure of -- of -- of response on my part.",

        "A: Let me see how this looks, how this operates, rather than a gut a-anger, or gut grief.\nAnd I can\u2019t answer the question because I\u2019ve certainly thought about it, and I don\u2019t know\nhow it works. I don\u2019t know how my emotions or my responses operate, I just don\u2019t know.",

        "A: And then, you know, there were things -- 1-1n the -- the extreme reaction is not one\nthat I remember -- any of us.

        "Q: On the other hand, if you react too much, you cannot then act in -- within the context\nof the disaster.",
        "A: Maybe so. Do you remember that famous photograph which 1s -- all -- wa --\nsomething I carry almost in my head, of the little boy in the middle of the group of --",

It was full of Dominicans and my mother and me, and it was\none of those horrible flights which goes all a -- which seems to descend or fly all the way.\nAnd all the Dominicans, ay, mamita, ay [indecipherable]. And my mother and I were\nsitting there with our -- with the white knuckle, holding on, saying not a word. And then\nthe plane would steady up and I remember there was one toothless woman who turned\naround kind of shamefacedly and grinned at us. And then there would be another drop,\nay, mamita, a didi -- Dios mio. There is the -- is there a different reaction that -- that you\nexpect o-of yourself, or I -- it is a puzzle.",

        "A: It\u2019s a puzzle.",
        "Q: -- it is a puzzle. But I have the feeling that -- that often the response comes much later\nwith people.",
        "A: Yes, it comes in terms of my not being able to bear to go to the movies in which\nthere\u2019s going to be a minimum of respo -- of -- of suspense.",

        "A: I don\u2019t like it. I\u2019m afraid -- I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to bother me, it\u2019s going to put me\nthrough something.",

        "Q: And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s not a rhetorical question to say, what did you feel at that\nmoment, because I -- I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I have no answer.",
        "Q: I know. Yeah.",
        "A: I was certainly frightened, but I was not out of control frightened.",

My Uncle Paul,\nmy father and my mother and I had left. I don\u2019t know -- no, my mother and my\ngrandfather stayed behind. Well, let me just say what happened was that they backed the\n-- backed a -- a truck against the door. By the way, Obama -- Barack Obama the other\nday used a f -- a simile which -- which -- which was wonderful. He said, wait til the -- the\nRepublicans back their garbage truck against the door and dump it. And that called up the\ntruck --",
        "Q: Truck.",
        "A: -- that the Nazis pulled up against my grandfather\u2019s house, and emptied it out, and\nthen made him sign a gift to the vinter -- vinterhelfs fund. The Winter Help Fund.

        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Then one -- my grandfather\u2019s assistant, a young man, came up one day on some\nmessage, on some trumped up message and found us listening to the radio, the o -- I\nforget wh-what the -- I-I mean, so it was what is now radio-free Europe, but I forget what\nitis. Think it was British broadcasting --",

The next\nday one of Paul\u2019s old room -- colle -- schoolmates came up and demanded the radio for\nuse at he -- at Nazi headquarters. I mean, there\u2019s several events like that. Then there was\nthe Hitler rally, which happened right outside our ha -- store, because the store was on the\n-- on the main -- main square. There was a big pole, on top of which was mounted a\nradio, a loudspeaker that broadcast the whole -- in the environment. And there were all\nthe young people in their Nazi uniforms, including my grandfather\u2019s shop assistant Mitzi\nwho was my -- who was my best friend, I thought. And my mother kind of -- my -- I -- I -\n-I want to say, hi Mitzi --",

        "A: And -- and then the stones -- the -- the stones throwing that broke every window, and\nthen the -- the stores closed, the men are taken to the police station, I think that is more or\nless. And then we have to go and my -- I think they -- they asked my father, or ordered\nmy grand -- my grandfather and my mother to stay and fi -- close up the shop.",
        "Q: And then -- and -- and so then you left to go back to Vienna in August --",
        "A: We left to go back to Vienna, of course nobody having anywhere to live because\nthey\u2019d taken our apartment.",
        "Q: Taken your apartment.",
        "A: And we were kind of divided up. I was sent to stay with a -- in the book I make it -- in\nthis book I\u2019m -- I\u2019m at pains to -- to m-muddle up who -- who was who, so that --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- out of -- out of some kind of probably unnecessary tact. But my grandmother went\nto live -- grandmother and grandfather let -- went to live with one of my grandmother\u2019s\nmany sisters. She had 15 brothers and sisters.",
        "Q: Oh my.",

        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: Let me just say something about that. There was a movie once on television, I can\u2019t\neven remember where we were and which -- which disaster we are talking about, but one\nof the women who was being asked to -- taken on some -- some death march, was hugely\nbig, like my Tante Frieda, who had an absolutely lovely, lovely face, but was obese, and\nthat now, if you want to know when I di -- when I fell apart, at -- watching -- it wasn\u2019t a\nmovie, it was on the television, that\u2019s when I we -- fell apart. Because I tried to imagine\nmy Tante Frieda --",
        "Q: Walked.",
        "A: -- being walked on a two day walk. And this women in the -- in the [indecipherable]\ndied. Died [indecipherable] because she couldn't walk. That got me.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That got me. But anyhow, I was taken to live -- to stay with a g -- a friend of mine, a\nschool friend. My father went to stay with his brother Max, Mimi. I don\u2019t n -- Paul, I\nthink went -- my Uncle Paul went to stay with his -- with his friend Dolph, I think. That\u2019s\n-- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s how I remember it. Eventually my grandparents found a house in the\nJewish district, the sec -- zweiter Bezirk, the second [indecipherable], and then my\nparents went to live with him. And the last day before I went on my Kindertransport, I\nstayed, I think one or two nights with them there.",
        "Q: Did you have any sense that this Kindertransport thing was coming?",
        "A: [had no idea, all I knew is that everybody of the Jewish community talked literally\nabout nothing except emigration. You know, it\u2019s so interesting when people ask us why\nwe didn\u2019t leave. Now, what -- what -- I mean, the sensible question is why didn\u2019t you\nleave before 1t came because you had every reason to know it. But why we didn\u2019t leave\nthen, nobody wanted anything except to leave. Our ac -- occupation was going to -- from\none consulate to the other. Our -- learning hand skills, the one -- the kind of skills that\nyou n -- you -- that you could earn a living if you didn't know the language, my father\nmade little -- little -- m-miserable little leather purses. My father and mother went to learn\nmachine knitting, knitting on -- on these mechanized machines. My mother learned large\nquantity cooking, what do you call it, yeah, cooking for many people. They learned\nSwedish massage. My Uncle Paul let -- went on -- on a Hakshera with people who wer --\nwanted to go to Israel to learn farming, to learn -- yeah, farm -- farm -- farm, do farm\nwork.",
        "Q: Right. And who\u2019s providing these classes? Jewish community?",

        "A: -- the Jewish cultural organization, I would imagine.",
        "Q: Yeah.",

You couldn't go shopping, you couldn\u2019t -- th-these were the\ntimes when people were hauled out -- my a -- my Uncle Paul\u2019s second wife was hauled\nout of her house and made to scrub the sidewalks.

        "A: Oh, well, firstly you -- you were -- you were told to hurry home. If you went to\nschool, you hurried home. And then of course, the big event was -- it was Kristallnacht.",
        "Q: Kristallnacht, yeah.",
        "A: When they told us at school to go home very quickly, and we said why and they say,\njust go home very quickly.",
        "Q: So you did go -- when you went back to Vienna in August, school starts in September,\nor --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: No, I went to a different Jewish school.",

        "Q: Left soon, right, right.",
        "A: But the school afterwards, there was a male teacher. And we were told to go home\nquickly, and that was th -- a very great drama because the Nazis came. Th-The kind -- th-\nthe way Kristallnacht played itself out in our -- in -- in my friends -- in my friend\u2019s\nparent\u2019s house is that all the Jewish families who lived in that building -- now, buildings -\n- [have a memory of a huge building, but m -- there were no huge bil -- there was one\n[indecipherable] in Vienna.

But what I do remember is that the Jewish families were\nbeing forced to move themselves and their furniture all into our apartment, the apartment\nof my friend, which had a bedroom, a living room and another bedroom. There were\nthree rooms in general. Interestingly, I can\u2019t place the kitchen, but there was a kitchen,\nI\u2019m sure.

        "A: It -- it\u2019s -- it -- it is alive and the wood shrinks and -- and you hear distinct, ghostly\ncreaks. Well, this [indecipherable] and -- and there were upside-down chairs. There were\ntables with their feet up. There were people sitting around crying. It was a -- it was a --\nsome kind of a battle scene. Not with -- with active battle, but something was wro --\neverything was wrong. Tables and chairs are supposed to have their f -- legs down and\nthese were upside-down on top of cupboards. And the Nazis kept turning the lights off\nand on. I mean that makes of -- the -- the practical jokes against the people over whom\nyou have power. The other thing that I remember very clearly is that Tante -- that -- that\nmy mo -- my friend -- my friend was called Dieter, and her mother had a brother who\ncame at that moment to hide out 1n our -- let me call it our apartment. Because they were\ntaking men from the apartment he was living in and of course walked straight into the\narms of the -- of -- of the Nazis and was taken away. I -- I don\u2019t re -- know -- don\u2019t\nremember the end of that story. What I do remember is the following days. It\u2019s such a\ncuriosity. I remember one of the men, one of the neighbor -- male neighbors, stayed in his\npajamas and whenever there was a ring or a knock at the door, he would get into bed as if\nhe could pretend he had some terrible disease and then they wouldn\u2019t take him away. I\nremember this man in the pajamas playing chess with one of the -- one of the children,\none of the boy children. There was just this sense of -- of oddity, of pecu -- of -- ofa\npeculiar world. And the funny -- a funny consciousness on my part that the man who kept\npretending he was sick was lying, and you\u2019re not supposed to lie.",
        "Q: There\u2019s that thing again. We\u2019re gonna --",
        "A: And also I -- that -- that is the -- that is one of the times that I do remember crying in\nterror, because it occurred to me at that moment I didn\u2019t know where my mother was.\nAnd I do remember sitting down and crying and being comforted by somebody.",
        "Q: By somebody.",
        "A: I think it was Dieter\u2019s mother, whose name at the moment I -- her father was Otto and\nhe was a -- he became a very dear friend, an old -- old -- older friend. He knew I was\nsmart and he liked it and he talked to me. He, like my Uncle Paul found that it was fun to\ntalk to me.",

        "A: I think so. I think so it was.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I remember some of the s -- comforting me with a hand, with a voice. Can\u2019t remember\nwhat they said, but I remember feeling what you might feel if you suddenly realized you\nwere in a -- in -- in -- in the supermarket and you had lost your -- you didn\u2019t know where\nyour mother was. It was that -- it was that experience. It suddenly came to me I didn\u2019t\nknow where she was.",

        "A: It seems to me it is, yes. I think that\u2019s what mobilized my father. That this 1s -- of\ncourse, happens off-scene --",
        "Q: Okay.",

And I think at this point what -\n- my father -- I mean, this -- I know this from my mother\u2019s story, that my fa-father said,\nshe\u2019s not going to stay here. And then he came to pick me up one day and it was within --\nit would seem to me within the week, within 10 days of this, while -- you know, I don\u2019t\nremember that condition of everybody living in this all -- I mean, we-well maybe some\n10 -- some 15 people living in, with all their furniture.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember that -- they didn\u2019t -- never moved out again, so I must have moved\nout. My father picked me up and said, you\u2019re going to England.

It was a round -- a round Temple,\na circular Temple, and when you walked across fallen lumber, it was gutted. And there\nwere people cleaning it out and then there were people that -- pa-parents and children\nhanging out down there. And then there were people standing up the stairs and along the\nwomen\u2019s gallery, waiting to be processed.",
        "Q: In this burned out place?",

        "Q: Right.",

And my father, who was very\npassive I think, or thought until I remembered that 1t was he who got me on to the\nchildren -- by the way, in her 101\u2018 year, when I visited my mother in the nursing home,\nshe and I did a revisionist history of my father.

        "A: -- she didn\u2019t want it -- it to happen. She -- she didn\u2019t argue because the situation -- I\nmean, it was clear by this time, my father had tried every -- see, it wasn\u2019t the only thing\nhe did. He was the one who went from consulate to consulate. It was he who got our\nname onto -- on to the American quota, which is why I\u2019m sitting here today. So it wasn\u2019t\n-- it wasn\u2019t all that clear --",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t just the one -- uh-huh --",
        "A: -- it wasn\u2019t just that one thing. In my head it was the one thing, but my -- he quarreled\nwith my mother, they -- he was afraid of her going down.

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But my mother went down anyhow. I wanted a wurst. I wanted a sausage and I was\ngoing to get that sausage and she was going to go and get it for me. And she went down\nand she got it and she came back and m-my -- the other thing I remember is the anger of\none of the aunts, who had twins and how come I got onto the -- my father had got me on\nthe Kindertransport, how come he hadn\u2019t taken the trouble to get her twins on the\ntransport? And my father -- this I do remember very clearly, my father sort of standing\nme between his knees and saying, when you get to England, you have to talk to the\nEnglish people and you have to tell them to get out -- Mom-Mommy and me out, and the\ngrandparents, and Tante Milla and the twins.

        "A: -- to save some -- some six or seven or eight family members from Hitler, out of\nHitler\u2019s Germany -- Austria.

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: For -- for ye -- for a year or two.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: Then everybody went to -- they -- they -- the aunts -- the aunts left, the cousins left,\nand my parents a -- a -- I think that th -- we -- as I remember it, we were allowed to take a\nrucksack, a backpack and one suitcase, and no more. And we had -- we were -- I don\u2019t\nknow at what point we were given the number 152, but it was certainly -- I-I think it\nmight have been when we got -- we -- here, we walked across the bridge and what I\nremember about that is seeing my father and mother talking over my head. They held my\nhand and over my head they were talking about how -- again, the la -- the conversation\nabout getting out of -- of -- out of Vienna. And my mother said something like why don\u2019t\nyou try the Dutch consulate, and my father saying here, you can go to China and go to\nBeying. And my mother said, why don\u2019t you try the Dutch -- the Dutch. And I thought\nthey are talking -- they are already talking about tomorrow and I\u2019m not going to be here\ntomorrow.",

And I had a serious doubt on the subject. It seemed to me, in\nmy childish wisdom, reasonable to cry, and I was not doing it. Cause what I was thinking\nis, wow I\u2019m going to England. Cause I had counted. I had been to Austria and I had been\nto Hungary and I had been to Czechoslovakia. Now I was going to be -- go to -- to\nEngland, that\u2019s going to be four countries.",

        "Q: I think so. What\u2019s interesting about you is that you have an internal conversation --",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And clearly did it at a very young age.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. It was not -- I was not very old when I had the distinct -- not so -- it\u2019s not\nan image, the distinct experience of an entity, an -- a watchful -- an eye, a -- a knowledge,\nan awareness sitting -- and it\u2019s over here, and taking note of what was going on.

        "A: Oh it\u2019s mostly in polls. But we get to an open field, an open -- a large open space\nbehind the [indecipherable], the west station.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And there are innumerable bodies, people, it\u2019s dark, and there are people with poles on\nwhich there are placards that say something like -- mine particular said 100 to -- 0-o0-of --\none fi -- 150 to 200 -- to 190 -- 199, assuming, right?",

And I looked -- and my mother was standing -- my mother had\na black pony fur. I\u2019ve always tried -- I -- when going into stores and said if they have a\npony fur, and they say, a what? Apparently there 1s no such thing as a pony fur, but that\u2019s\nwhat I thought my mother had. And it had a biz foc -- big fox collar, and inside that fox\ncollar was her face, and it was perfectly red and hot.

        "Q: The luggage?",
        "A: -- the lu -- th-the -- the little suitcase. But she kept talking to me, she kept walking\nbeside me and talking until somebody from the organization [indecipherable] took the\nsuitcase and gave it to me, and the next thing I knew I was through the portal inside the\nstation, and my mother was no longer there. Now, I had a friend who believed that he\ncould elicit forgotten information.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And it interested him because I said I remember my mother holding the suitcase, and I\nremember being inside the train. I seem not to have crossed the station, got onto the\nplatform, got onto the train, walked into the carriage. And he tried very hard, it was very\ninteresting. He tried to make -- he tried to retrieve the lost memory. I -- I mean, I tried\nvery hard.",

        "A: Went back into the -- into -- into hell -- into the hellhole. Meanwhile, it was -- that --\nthat was an exciting -- exciting train ride.

        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I remember being rather terrified at seeing my father sleep at some point. That seemed\nvery unnatural. He was supposed to be up, I was suppo -- but to go along this -- that train\nand look in and see children sleeping was very interesting. I remember it.

        "Q: Other way around.",
        "A: Has to be the other way around. But it certainly, at some point somebody says, we are\nout. It -- it has to be. The scene of the -- of the platf -- people being on this platform has\nto be afterwards --",

        "A: -- except it -- I can\u2019t make it do that. [Il tell you why I can\u2019t do -- make it do that in\nmy memory. Because somebody says we\u2019re out and immediately the -- the train doors\nopen up and the boys come in. We were --",

And there 1s this big -- and they\u2019re some of\nthe bigger boys, and they turn back their lapels and they have -- I mean, how anybody\nwould do that -- they have the Kruckenkreuz of Austria, they -- they -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a cross\nlike that and it has -- it has a -- it\u2019s like an eye. They have the Pfadfinder, the -- the -- the\n-- the g-guides -- no, what are Pfadfinder?",

        "A: Boy scouts, the boy scout. I mean, they have all these forbidden insignia on their\nlapels. And there\u2019s -- they were singing, and | think they were singing those Austrian\nsongs, pre-Hitler Austrian songs, and they were singing Zionist songs, none of which I\nknew. And I was hugging somebody, somebody was hugging me. Now, the reason I\ncannot make my memory produce the scene at the -- when we were given the food after\nthat -- because I remember going to sleep in the middle of this. That\u2019s what memory\ndoes. And I remember that the very next thing that ha -- that happened was that\nsomebody was putting my rucksack onto me -- I di -- one of the older girls, or one of the\nhelpers, putting my rucksack on a-and identifying my suitcase and standing me down in\nthe very cold air on the platform.

        "A: -- that\u2019s what memory, or memory does to me.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Clearly. And then we were -- the next thing I remember is being on the boat and being\nled into a cabin, which was incredibly comfortable. Imagine after -- this was a day and a\nday, a night -- a day -- a night, a day, a night. And now you\u2019re in a little room that has a\nwhite bed with white sheets. And I had a worry, I had a problem. I couldn\u2019t brush my\nteeth and what would my mommy think if I didn't brush my teeth, so that worried me.\nAnd I had another worry. I had been to -- I had been told that when you go on the water\nyou throw up. So I went, got into bed, and I prayed. I-I was sorry I hadn\u2019t -- I hadn\u2019t\nbrushed my teeth. I hoped God would not met -- let me throw up and please don\u2019t get --\ntake my parents to the -- away [indecipherable]. Which incidentally, having your pa-\nparents taken [indecipherable] was daily. I mean, you could -- we\u2019d always hear of\nsomebody -- so and so having been taken away, mostly men. Almost always men, but not\nentirely.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So your parents being taken away, your father being taken away, it was just -- it wa --\nit was what happened instead of going to the office.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So -- and then I remember this black steward coming in and I\u2019m s -- I said to him, am\nI going to throw up? And he said no, what you do is you put your head down and you go\nright to sleep and then you won\u2019t throw up. Oh, and I also asked him -- he had brought\nme something that looked like coffee and he said, no tea. And I said white tea? And he\nsaid, tea with milk. Which was my first experience of English tea.",
        "Q: Did you have tea when you were in Vienna? No.",
        "A: Not that I know of. Yes, tea with lemon.",
        "Q: With lemon, but not with milk.",
        "A: Lemon and sugar.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That was a great experience, yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But not tea with milk, that looked like coffee.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But he was ex -- he was very sympathetic. He was very tall and sympathetic.",
        "Q: Were you alone in this cabin?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. And I was also trying out my English on him and it worked fairly well. The next\nday we arrived and the boat was on -- standing there. The next thing as I remember,\nbetween then and getting to the camp, was the world of waiting.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: You waited in the boat to be processed by these ladies sitting around the table. I was\nwanting for one of the many photographers to come and take my picture. And they didn\u2019t\n-- and they didn\u2019t take my picture. And I tried many things. I tried sleeping, I tried\nhopping, I tried eating. Oh, I forgot about the sausage. I have to tell you about the\nsausage.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Because on the f -- when -- on the -- on the -- on the train, we were supposed to eat\nsomething and I took the sausage and I hated it.",
        "Q: You hated it?",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t bear it, so I ate some chocolate instead. And the next day there was still this\nsausage and I tried it again. And by that time it was kind of yucky looking and I tried it\nagain, I really didn't like it. It was not the sausage I -- I wanted and liked. So that\u2019s --",
        "Q: You wanted another kind of sausage?",
        "A: So I\u2019m -- I guess.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I guess.",
        "A: I mean, when I said to my mother I want sausage, I was just saying something because\nshe needed me to say something, not because I had a taste in my mouth that needed\nsatisfaction. So I ate more chocolate, and I had boiled sweets and I had more chocolate.\nAnd I was eventually processed and given that visa, that -- I -- I t -- that I showed you --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- th-that c-card --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that special -- I mean, it was instead of a visa. It -- to get a visa from the Austrians\nwas a nightmare. It\u2019s like going to the Social Se-Security.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Right?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That\u2019s what it -- and they -- a-and they meant it to be difficult.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So we had these alternative things. And they either -- the -- either the lady gave it to\nme -- I don\u2019t know, but it had something to do, I saw that for the first time. And here\ncomes another wrong memory. I was processed, and now I c-could -- could go with my\ncoat, no suitcase, down the gangplank. What I remember is going down the gangplank\nentirely by myself, seeing an empty dock with workers standing, watching, and that there\nwas a mist, a -- aS -- a-- a -- one of those English -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s like -- it\u2019s like as if\nmist had been decimated and was hanging in the air, going down to a huge glass and tron\nhangar where were rows and rows of suitcases and I was told to get mine. And the notion\nof finding mine in all this seemed to me a nightmare. So I sat down and cried some more.\nAnd somebody came and of course all they did was look at the number and then go to the\nnumber.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But here is the puzzle. There exists, and it was given me by the wa -- la -- the producer\nof the movie, \u201cInto the Arms of Strangers\u201d, which deals with the -- with the\nKindertransport, they actually found a picture of me coming off the gangplank. You can\nsee the -- I have it, I own it, I own this little picture. It says 152. I have my little cap on\nand I\u2019m not alone by any means, I\u2019m one of an-any number of children coming down the\ngangplank.

And a-after we had put down our -- our -- our suitcases and chosen our beds, we\nwere supposed to go back for a meal. And I said I didn\u2019t want to go, because it had\noccurred to me I had to do something with this scosset -- this sausage, which was\nbeginning to smell noticeably and had been commented upon by the little girls in the -- in\n-- the little girls in [indecipherable] what -- what\u2019s [sniffs]. So I said I wa -- I wasn\u2019t\nhungry, I was sleepy, I was going to stay there. And I was going to figure out what to do\nwith this thing. And here comes one of the great puzzles in life. How do you -- how do\nyou get rid of something that smells bad, which your mother has given you before you\nleft Vienna. There is no way that you can throw it out, but there 1s no way you can keep\nit.",
        "Q: Keep it.",
        "A: And this is a problem.",
        "Q: Right. You got a big problem here.",
        "A: You got a big problem and you keep thinking that any moment now, you\u2019re going to\nfigure it out. But you\u2019re also sleepy, so you lie down in the bed, and you\u2019re going to\nfigure this out. By this time you hear --",
        "Q: The kids coming back.",
        "A: -- the kids coming back, so you scoot it under the bed. I mean, y-you take that -- it\u2019s in\n-- it\u2019s in a paper bag --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and scoot it under the bed.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Well, who 1s the horrible person who has made in her bed? Yes, who --",
        "Q: Who did it?",
        "A: Y-You jo -- you join, you know, where\u2019s the thief? You join the -- it\u2019s -- it was a\nproblem for -- for many a day.",
        "Q: So what did you end up doing?",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: Nothing? Did it just shrivel up, what?",
        "A: It shriveled up and stank.",
        "Q: And just stayed there.",
        "A: It stayed there. It stayed there. I tried several things. I tried to bury -- now -- by now\nthe f -- the ground is frozen stiff. I took 1t outside and tried to make a hole for it with the\nheel of my -- of my shoe, it wo -- 1t wouldn\u2019t -- it wouldn\u2019t. It did occur to me I could\nthrow it in the garbage, but I -- you couldn\u2019t. How -- you can\u2019t throw that away. Your\nmommy we -- went all the way down, she had a fight with your father about going down\nto get it, I mean. Anyhow, he -- in -- in the -- 1n the -- they were -- they -- they --\nmeanwhile we spend most of our time in this big hall.

        "A: No, ours was a -- ours -- and I was so impressed with him because he -- all he had on,\nthese little purple trunks and it was really cold, and he could flap his stomach muscles.\nThat\u2019s what I most --",
        "Q: That\u2019s --",

        "Q: To come.",
        "A: It was sweet of him to be there. The other thing that I remember 1s that the mayor of lo\n-- | think it was in Lowestoft. They were -- we were in two camps, but we\u2019|l make it in\none camp, it\u2019s too long a story. We were moved out of the first camp because the next set\nof -- of --",

        "A: -- kids were coming.",

        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: I do not remember. I -- I only remember that I -- well, the people I was with, I was\nsuddenly no longer with, I was with other people. Here it becomes -- you know, there\u2019s --\nit\u2019s interesting, there\u2019s just so much memory that you --",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: -- or detail that you can put in, then -- then 1-1t\u2019s full and -- and there\u2019s no more room.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The things rapidly that I remember. I remember the mayor coming and my thinking I\nwas going to ask the mayor -- my daddy had said, you must talk to the English people\nand get them out of Vienna. My grandparents, my parents, my Tante Milla.",
        "Q: And the two boys, right?",
        "A: And so I was thinking I\u2019m -- I will go up to the mayor and ask him. And I said to the\ngirl who -- our -- th-the -- the -- the first big girl, I said to her, how do you say to bring\nout of Vienna, or some -- some phrase. And she said, I don\u2019t know. Now, I was still\ngoing to -- I had this -- this idea that once I was face to face with the mayor I would have\nthe right words. But of course when it came to the point, I wasn\u2019t even sure which was\nthe mayor and at that moment somebody addressed us, somebody -- he had a bad cold, I\nremember that. The moment never happened. And now I-I -- you know, I was beginning\nto worry that I was not doing this thing. My parents were going to be taken to ca -- to -- it\nwasn\u2019t called concentration camp in the war, I don\u2019t know what it was called. But it was -",
        "Q: Whatever. Wasn\u2019t [indecipherable |",
        "A: -- whatever it was, they were going to go because I had forgotten to -- I hadn\u2019t got\naround to talking to the mayor. The other thing I remember is that there were all of a\nsudden in the camp, these kind of -- these kind of things.",
        "Q: What, wires?",
        "A: Wires. They were all written because they were -- they were -- they were filming 1t all,\nor -- or putting it on tape.",
        "Q: Really?",

        "Q: No, no, the wires.",
        "A: These snaky looking wires there, yeah.",
        "Q: Right, right. Did they take your f -- they obviously took your picture somewhere.",
        "A: Maybe. I don\u2019t -- let me get on with this. What -- what I also remember 1s they were\ndancing the horah, the children with their arms around each other and I wanted to dance,\nbut I didn\u2019t know if I was meant to join them. And I didn\u2019t know how to get myself out of\nmy chair, into the situation of dancing. And I thought, I wish somebody would come and\nask me. So one of the ladies -- there were -- there were lots of ladies in -- suddenly, in fur\ncoats. And -- and one of the ladies in fur coat said, don\u2019t you want to dance? And I said\nno. And she said, why don\u2019t you come and dance? I said I don\u2019t want to. And then she\nwent away, and I thought, if she comes back and asks me again, then I will come. Course\nshe never came back. And I told this story tha-th-th-th-th-th-the Austrian filmmaker took\nus around and took us to some of these camps that now exist, that resemble these camps.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "A: -- camera, who was about 19 years old and there was the -- th-the -- the -- the person\nwith the boom. He\u2019s a young, gorgeous young -- young man. And I told him this story, I\nthought it was so peculiar of a -- of a -- of a child that wasn\u2019t able -- oh, they said, I know\njust how that felt. I know exactly wanting to dance and not.",
        "Q: So did you ever get up?",
        "A: Th -- I never got up, never got up.",
        "Q: Never.",
        "A: Sta -- sat in my little coat. And you know, the longer you sit, the less possible it is to\nget up.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: The -- th-the -- there were ladies walking around with -- with -- what -- what -- what\ndo you call the thing that you -- clipboards. And walking around saying -- saying to\nchildren -- choosing children. They were looking for 20 children to go -- I mean, the\nwhole point of our being in the camp is -- was ba -- while they were finding us foster\nhomes, or schools to go to, or making the arrangements. By the way, one of the things my\nmother said mo-most recently, she said, it just occurs to me that when we sent you away,\nwe had no addresses. We didn\u2019t know --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And that seems so amazing. Cause they were still in the process of finding places to\nput us.",
        "Q: Right. And they didn\u2019t know where you were going to go.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know where we --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Anyhow, they were walking around and this lady comes up to me and says -- two of\nthem, there were two of them, and one of them came up to me and said, wh-what is your\nname? I said, Lore Groszmann. How old are you? I am -- I said half past 10. And she\nsaid, would you like -- oh, they said to each other, she speaks English. And one of them\nsaid, would you like to go to an Orthodox home? I said yes. And so they put me down\nand they said tomorrow you\u2019re going to Liverpool. And then when they\u2019d gone, I was\nwriting a letter -- I was in process of writing a letter, I said, by the way, what\u2019s Orthodox?",
        "Q: You were writing to your parents?",
        "A: To my parents, what\u2019s -- what does that mean, Orthodox? And my father wrote me\nback and said, do not go to an Orthodox home. By that time I was already in being --",

        "Q: And you liked it. You liked it.",
        "A: I liked it. I liked it. You know, there is something in a confusion, if there\u2019s certain\nthings you know are right and wrong. This you\u2019re supposed -- I never learned how they\nwere -- expected me to hold my knife and fork, cause it was different. That I couldn't\nfigure out.

        "Q: In the camp.",
        "A: -- writing camp -- and I wrote letters to my parents and my grandparents and I wrote\nletters to the cousins, here come the cousins. The cou -- the -- the -- Tante -- Tante Erna,\nwho had been called a cow, they were already in England because of his business\nconnections.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They were the o -- they were the organizers, together with the Viennese\nKultusgemeinde for -- for managing these refugee matters. Because my parents did, as a\nmatter of fact, by March have a visa to England as a married couple; that is to say as a\nbutler and cook. I have always assumed, and I don\u2019t know why I know this, that my uncle\ne -- Uncle Ernst sent this [indecipherable] or in some way organized this, because I don\u2019t\nknow who else would have organized it, there was nobody in England except I and these\ncousins, who could have --",
        "Q: But your -- your letter, the one letter that I read is extremely poignant, because while\nyou're talking like a kid about how wonderful things are, things -- but in your heart\nthere\u2019s this fear about your parents. And I can imagine someone receiving that letter --",
        "A: And being moved by it.",
        "Q: -- and being moved and si --",
        "A: I was also operating like a writer. I had -- I had images. Out -- outside -- out behind\nthe -- behind the cottage was a rose, and the rose had snow on it and I was saying how\nwill my parents -- if you don\u2019t get my parents out, they will die like the rose in the snow,\nstuff like that.",
        "Q: Like in the [indecipherable], right. It\u2019s fabulous, and unusual, it seems to me.",

You needed a visa to get into the other\ncountry. You needed a -- the people of -- a letter from -- of either a job or people to look\nout for you. You needed an exit visa. And all of these things were dated, and all of these\nthings had to be somehow procured and current at the same time. And it simply didn\u2019t\nhappen. And my image was to say what I\u2019ve just said to you, and say, it\u2019s like winding up\na ball of wool that keeps falling out of your hands and unraveling. And I thought that was\npretty good.",
        "Q: That was pretty --",
        "A: And I mean, it even refers to something real, that was a real, real disastrous problem.",

        "Q: Oh, you\u2019re right.",
        "A: Somebody put that on, I -- I was surprised to see that. Somebody must have added that\nto my letter.",

In the morning when I sit up in bed, I can look through\nthe window and see far out across the ocean.

And then, after\nmy -- I\u2019ve learned that my grand -- my parents had moved again, to another apartment.\nThis is now when I\u2019m living in -- 1n -- in Liverpool with the Cohens.

Now\nwhen we got out, I guess it was the s -- in -- in -- in -- in Liverpool, that one -- the two\nladies were -- who were -- picked us up said to me, now you can throw it away.

One\nthing you do when you really need letters desperately, you try and keep disappointment at\nbay. So I would make long arithmetical arrangements with myself. I would say, it takes --\nit'll take five days to get to Vienna, it\u2019ll take them five days to answer. Then they will --\nit takes five days to get back, let\u2019s say six days.

        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Now, there was a tear management that I learned after awhile. I would sit in front of\nthe fire on a low stool and I discovered that if you -- 1f you a -- you -- you can use tears\nlike a blanket, but you didn\u2019t want to cry them, because then -- the blanket then was all\nover. So I would bring them up to here, and sit looking into the fire and to have tears up\nto here. And that -- I got -- I got an exp -- got to be expert at being able to do that.

        "Q: Oh my God. So they found it extremely difficult to be with you, because you were not\nbeing with them.",

        "Q: Out of your --",
        "A: -- out of my mouth. So I couldn\u2019t call her anything. So another reason I kept\ndisappearing from the room, because I couldn\u2019t think of a way to address her.",

Mari then\nwent to the bathroom, and John, her husband, said to me, that was not why they -- you\nknow why they sent you away? Because Harold attacked Mari and tried to rape her, and\nthey wanted to get you out of the house.

        "Q: Yeah, I am too.",
        "A: Anyway, they said I had to leave, and then I did this amazing thing. I borrowed Mari\u2019s\nbicycle and went to the church ladies\u2019 committee and said I have to leave. And they gave\nme an address, and I -- I motor -- I motored out -- I mean, I f -- I bicycled out to this -- to\nthis other family and interviewed th -- you know, the -- I showed you a picture of the\nthree little children?",

The next rule was that women also could be spies and needed to be moved\ninland from a certain mileage to the coast, so they wouldn\u2019t give signals. So my mother\ncame and picked me up and we went to Guilford, the last place where we lived, where\nshe and I got -- she got a lovely job with this -- with the best family in the world. They\nwere Scots, they were classy Scots.

And I went home and said to my\nmother, she doesn\u2019t -- she thinks I\u2019m not going to go to college. She thinks I\u2019m going to\nwork. My mother said, oh, it\u2019s just ridiculous.

And my mother -- I -- my mother married\nhim, firstly because he asked her, and secondly because he was not like all the -- the\ncrude and joke-y salesmen who came to my grandfather\u2019s store in Fischamend and\nwanted to marry her.\nQ2: And who\u2019s this little cherub?",
        "A: This 1s little Lore, age about four or five, I imagine, 1n -- in Hammerling Park, which\nwas the park very close to where we lived, which I went -- went to see when I went back\nto Vienna and where I remember the words, kina Juden, no Jews, during the Hitler\nperiod.\nQ2: And on the left?",
        "A: In the left, my father had -- always had August off from his bank job, and we would\nalways spend a month in the Austrian Alps. This is my father, mother and me biting my\nnails, because my parents had decided I needed some little other kid to play with and they\ngot -- they found -- somewhere found this little boy who was Hungarian, didn\u2019t speak a\nword of English.\nQ2: And what\u2019s this photograph?",

        "Q: And how old do you think you are?",
        "A: Three, two? Two or three.\nQ2: And where was this document here?",
        "A: This is the lifesaving document. You will see it says, this document requires no visa.\nAnd the attempt to get visas and -- and -- and permits and everything at the same time\nwas a -- an almost impossible job. So the -- the Kult-Kultusgemeinde in Vienna and the\nBloomsbury House and the State Department in England cooked up this particular way of\nfacilitating the -- the imi -- the emigration of children, but only children without parents.\nAnd this is the document that got me onto the Kindertransport and from Vienna to\nEngland.\nQ2: And what does this represent?",
        "A: It is actually not the camp to which we -- 1n -- in which we were housed while they\nwere find -- trying to find foster parents for us, but it is the closest thing that exists today,\nor rather this is the only picture that -- that -- that I could find of such a camp, such a\nworker\u2019s camp, which were used for the children. And this is the kind of view that I\nwould have had -- that we would have had from the bus, from the top of the bus, after the\ncrossing the channel and arriving, this is the view we would have had, with the ocean\nbehind it and this little -- little s -- little town of little -- little houses in which we were\nhoused while we were in the camp.\nQ2: And what about this picture?",
        "A: The family Cohen, whom I -- my first foster parents, bought me a little coat and then\nthey took me to the -- to the photographer to have a picture to send to my parents and I\nwas 11 years old, or almost 11. This would be 1930 -- \u201939, early 1939.\nQ2: And who is this couple?",
        "A: This is my -- this -- these are my first foster parents, L-Lena Cohen and the -- her\nhusband, whose name I can\u2019t remember. I do remember that he was very dear and very\nquiet and didn\u2019t ec -- expect anything of me except for me to sit next to him while we --\nand look into the fire, whereas Auntie Lena insisted that I call her Auntie Lena and I\ncould never get myself to do it. This picture was given me by their youngest daughter\nRuth, who was my friend and champion and with whom I am still in touch. And who\nspeaks very lovingly of -- of these two parents.\nQ2: And this shot, Lore?",
        "A: It\u2019s a picture of my father, my mother and me, age about 14. I think what -- what is\nmost the -- moving and sad 1s the degree of my father\u2019s illness and the deterioration.\nQ2: And who are these?",
        "A: These are the three children of the family of the munitions worker, whose name I can\u2019t\nremember, but who took me in after the first family, the Gillams could no longer keep\nme. I remember taking -- after I was told they could not take me, I remember borrowing a\nbicycle and -- and going to -- essentially going to interview their mother to see if -- if I\nwould be taken in by them.\nQ2: And who is this?",
        "A: This is Miss Wallace, one of the two ladies -- one of the two ladies with whom I lived\nin Guilford. She -- I -- and her -- and her dog, her favorite dog, she was -- I -- what I can s\n-- tell you about it is that she bought one house to take care of -- of -- of a -- of\npauperized gentlefolk and another house to house refugees like my parents. She was a -- a\n-- a-- amarvelously good woman. And I -- probably the -- probably a companion to the\nother, older woman called Miss Ellis.

And for many\nyears -- [ -- I have written little stories before that, and I came to the point in my 20\u2019s\nwhen it seemed to me I had no subject. I hadn\u2019t been in love, I hadn\u2019t died. None of the\nbig events had happened to me, and I wanted to be writing. And it seemed to me that\nthese stories that I did have with -- my experiences were a dime a dozen, everybody knew\nabout them. And then one day I -- when 1-in -- in my early days in New York, I had gone\nto the new school and taken a course in creative writing, and we -- the people in that class\nhad a s -- had a -- had a party. And somebody said to me, how did you come to the\nUnited States? And I began to tell my -- my Hitler stories. And there was that silence in\nthe room that I have since had as a teacher, but hadn\u2019t experienced at that time. I thought,\ngee, wow, I have stories to tell and it a -- and -- and it came to me that these stories were\nmy subject. But again, I wa -- didn\u2019t write them because I wanted to -- what I think 1s\nnow known as bearing witness. I wanted to be writing. And I -- I mean another answer is\nthat as a novelist you can in a way -- it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, it\u2019s a truism, but you can be truer that\nyou can --",

One of the -- one of the\nchapters in \u201cOther People\u2019s Houses\u201d was about my attraction for awhile to the stories of\nChristianity. No-Notice that I\u2019m -- it\u2019s the stories that attracted me. Now, in the chapter\nabout this in \u201cOther People\u2019s Houses\u201d, I made it may -- the narrative seems to suggest\nthat it was the people in -- my foster parents at the -- of the time, my foster -- two -- two\nfoster mothers tried to convert me. And when they got to -- when th -- one of them at any\nrate, read the story, s -- read the book, she wrote me and said, but we never tried to\nconvert you. And I wrote back and said absolutely not, you didn\u2019t. But for an -- for a\nstory, to be seduced by a person is more -- 1s a be -- it\u2019s a better story than being seduced\nby an idea. In fact, it\u2019s almost impossible novelisticly to write that. So novels suit me\nbetter than history, or biography, or auto-biography. It\u2019s a long answer.",

My\nmother loved to tell the story against -- she felt 1t a story against herself, that she took me\nwith her to a ladies\u2019 caf\u00e9 yousa, a -- a coffee klatch. And all the ladies were talking with\neach other and at the end, as my little coat was being put on, I was reported to have said,\nhere one knows nothing, here one speaks of nothing. I might have been five, or six. And\nmy mother said, what do you mean? And I said, here they don\u2019t know that I dance on my\ntoes. Here they don\u2019t know that I -- I can do the figure eight on the ice. No, I must have\nbeen older, seven -- six or seven [indecipherable]. And my mother was embarrassed and\nrealized that I had been made too much of, and too much admired and too much praise.\nBut I always thought that I\u2019m incredibly lucky to have been brought up by two of the best\npeople in the world that I know. My mother and my Uncle Paul, who -- who were both\nwitty, loving, very, very, very much attached to me. Gave me a lot of space to show off.\nThat was a world in which my poor very lar -- father, who was a six-footer, which was\nunusual for -- for a European Jew, I think, who was a -- who was an accountant, a chief\naccountant in the Bank of Cooksbrock and company, was an outsider. He was odd man\nout. He was not able to laugh, he was not able to participate in the fun that we had before\nhe walked in the door. He was very dear and very lacking in imagination and became,\nwhen I was five -- this certainly is a datable event, and one that I remember, became very\nill. He was a bleeder.",

Anyhow, it was a long road, and they were -- they were riding along it and\nsome partridges -- he saw some partridges and he took his hands off the bicycle and\nclapped and fell off and began to bleed.

I don\u2019t remem -- I have no idea what kind of a theory that was, but that\nwas -- that\u2019s certainly one of my earliest memories of going to see my father lying flat.\nAnd it was really from that moment on that he was essentially -- well, in and out of\nhospital is overstating it, but I -- I do remember coming home from school and my\nmother saying, put -- don\u2019t take off your coat, we\u2019re going to go see Daddy, who was\nonce again in the hospital, always with his head flat on the -- on the -- on the white sheet.\nMy mother was always cooking diet for him.

        "A: Oh, I would think universally, yes. My -- there were the kids that my Uncle Paul and -\n- and my mother had gone to school with, who had -- you know, had been -- been anti-\nSemitic, but it didn\u2019t amount to very much. I mean, my mother used to say that they had a\n-- a --a game that was called the old bird seller. And the old bird seller was a Jew, and my\nmother always had to be the bir -- old bird seller, and -- and she was disappointed cause\nthere were other -- other parts like being birds, or being somebody else that she would\nhave liked. But it didn\u2019t amount to anything very much until -- you -- you see, this 1s to --\nseems to me so interesting about this whole thing. One understands meanness of many\nkinds, one understands anti-Semitism or racism, but you have to wait for a -- a-- a\nregime that not only permits but mandates that meanness and that racism. And then you\nget hell on earth. These young -- these young people were just automatically mean, anti-\nSemitic people until Hitler came. And then there was the day on which they put ladders\nup against the windows of my grandfather\u2019s house and walked in -- came -- first they s --\nthey sat on the windowsills, and then they came in and helped themselves to whatever\nwas in the house. These were the age group of my -- of my -- of my -- my mothers and\nuncles -- they had gone to school together, or their -- or their -- or their children, or their -\n- or their younger brothers and sisters.",

        "A: I don\u2019t know where it is.

        "A: I have one other s -- answer to this question. When my mother and I were flying from\nthe Dominican Republic finally, to New York, we were in a plane.

It was full of Dominicans and my mother and me, and it was\none of those horrible flights which goes all a -- which seems to descend or fly all the way.\nAnd all the Dominicans, ay, mamita, ay [indecipherable]. And my mother and I were\nsitting there with our -- with the white knuckle, holding on, saying not a word. And then\nthe plane would steady up and I remember there was one toothless woman who turned\naround kind of shamefacedly and grinned at us. And then there would be another drop,\nay, mamita, a didi -- Dios mio. There is the -- is there a different reaction that -- that you\nexpect o-of yourself, or I -- it is a puzzle.",
        "A: It\u2019s a puzzle.",

My Uncle Paul,\nmy father and my mother and I had left. I don\u2019t know -- no, my mother and my\ngrandfather stayed behind. Well, let me just say what happened was that they backed the\n-- backed a -- a truck against the door. By the way, Obama -- Barack Obama the other\nday used a f -- a simile which -- which -- which was wonderful. He said, wait til the -- the\nRepublicans back their garbage truck against the door and dump it. And that called up the\ntruck --",

        "A: And after that -- that was -- after that -- you know, here -- here is the sort of -- first of\nall the blood red words on the wall.",
        "A: Then one -- my grandfather\u2019s assistant, a young man, came up one day on some\nmessage, on some trumped up message and found us listening to the radio, the o -- I\nforget wh-what the -- I-I mean, so it was what is now radio-free Europe, but I forget what\nitis. Think it was British broadcasting --",
        "A: -- I don\u2019t know, but we were listening to it and he found us listening to it. The next\nday one of Paul\u2019s old room -- colle -- schoolmates came up and demanded the radio for\nuse at he -- at Nazi headquarters. I mean, there\u2019s several events like that. Then there was\nthe Hitler rally, which happened right outside our ha -- store, because the store was on the\n-- on the main -- main square. There was a big pole, on top of which was mounted a\nradio, a loudspeaker that broadcast the whole -- in the environment. And there were all\nthe young people in their Nazi uniforms, including my grandfather\u2019s shop assistant Mitzi\nwho was my -- who was my best friend, I thought. And my mother kind of -- my -- I -- I -\n-I want to say, hi Mitzi --",
        "A: -- and my uncle pulled me into the room and ca -- and closed the door.",
        "A: And then came that really drastic event of their walking 1 -- up the ladders and into the",

And then we have to go and my -- I think they -- they asked my father, or ordered\nmy grand -- my grandfather and my mother to stay and fi -- close up the shop.",
        "A: We left to go back to Vienna, of course nobody having anywhere to live because\nthey\u2019d taken our apartment.",

        "A: -- out of -- out of some kind of probably unnecessary tact. But my grandmother went\nto live -- grandmother and grandfather let -- went to live with one of my grandmother\u2019s\nmany sisters. She had 15 brothers and sisters.",
        "A: Of whom only three survived. All the others ar -- were killed in -- then, including\nTante Frieda, whom they went to stay with.",
        "A: Let me just say something about that. There was a movie once on television, I can\u2019t\neven remember where we were and which -- which disaster we are talking about, but one\nof the women who was being asked to -- taken on some -- some death march, was hugely\nbig, like my Tante Frieda, who had an absolutely lovely, lovely face, but was obese, and\nthat now, if you want to know when I di -- when I fell apart, at -- watching -- it wasn\u2019t a\nmovie, it was on the television, that\u2019s when I we -- fell apart. Because I tried to imagine\nmy Tante Frieda --",
        "A: -- being walked on a two day walk. And this women in the -- in the [indecipherable]\ndied. Died [indecipherable] because she couldn't walk. That got me.",
        "A: That got me. But anyhow, I was taken to live -- to stay with a g -- a friend of mine, a\nschool friend. My father went to stay with his brother Max, Mimi. I don\u2019t n -- Paul, I\nthink went -- my Uncle Paul went to stay with his -- with his friend Dolph, I think. That\u2019s\n-- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s how I remember it. Eventually my grandparents found a house in the\nJewish district, the sec -- zweiter Bezirk, the second [indecipherable], and then my\nparents went to live with him. And the last day before I went on my Kindertransport, I\nstayed, I think one or two nights with them there.",
        "A: [had no idea, all I knew is that everybody of the Jewish community talked literally\nabout nothing except emigration. You know, it\u2019s so interesting when people ask us why\nwe didn\u2019t leave. Now, what -- what -- I mean, the sensible question is why didn\u2019t you\nleave before 1t came because you had every reason to know it. But why we didn\u2019t leave\nthen, nobody wanted anything except to leave. Our ac -- occupation was going to -- from\none consulate to the other. Our -- learning hand skills, the one -- the kind of skills that\nyou n -- you -- that you could earn a living if you didn't know the language, my father\nmade little -- little -- m-miserable little leather purses. My father and mother went to learn\nmachine knitting, knitting on -- on these mechanized machines. My mother learned large\nquantity cooking, what do you call it, yeah, cooking for many people. They learned\nSwedish massage. My Uncle Paul let -- went on -- on a Hakshera with people who wer --\nwanted to go to Israel to learn farming, to learn -- yeah, farm -- farm -- farm, do farm\nwork.",

You couldn't go shopping, you couldn\u2019t -- th-these were the\ntimes when people were hauled out -- my a -- my Uncle Paul\u2019s second wife was hauled\nout of her house and made to scrub the sidewalks. That was a common thing, you would\nlook --",
        "A: -- you would see people --",

        "A: I don\u2019t think I saw that personally, no.",
        "A: Oh, well, firstly you -- you were -- you were told to hurry home. If you went to\nschool, you hurried home. And then of course, the big event was -- it was Kristallnacht.",
        "A: When they told us at school to go home very quickly, and we said why and they say,\njust go home very quickly.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: I went to the same school that I had been -- that had been made into the --",
        "A: No, I went to a different Jewish school.",
        "A: Because I was living in a different -- in a different district. Yeah, that\u2019s right, I wa -- I\nwas now living -- I was no longer living in Josef Stetter strasse, I was living -- I forget\nwhere my friend lived, but it was a different school district.",
        "A: So I went -- I mean, I now see that I remember, I see a different class, a class\ndifferently --",
        "A: -- arranged.",
        "A: And the different tea -- it was a male teacher. I don\u2019t really remember who the -- who\n-- | don\u2019t -- anyway, after -- after the event of the teacher crying, I have no more memory\nof that school. Maybe it was because we left very soon afterwards.",
        "A: But the school afterwards, there was a male teacher. And we were told to go home\nquickly, and that was th -- a very great drama because the Nazis came. Th-The kind -- th-\nthe way Kristallnacht played itself out in our -- in -- in my friends -- in my friend\u2019s\nparent\u2019s house is that all the Jewish families who lived in that building -- now, buildings -\n- [have a memory of a huge building, but m -- there were no huge bil -- there was one\n[indecipherable] in Vienna. My mother went to take me, it was 10 -- 10 stories high,\nokay? So it was a four -- ba -- mise -- m -- wa-was not a -- more than -- I can\u2019t imagine it\nwas more than four stories high. But what I do remember is that the Jewish families were\nbeing forced to move themselves and their furniture all into our apartment, the apartment\nof my friend, which had a bedroom, a living room and another bedroom. There were\nthree rooms in general. Interestingly, I can\u2019t place the kitchen, but there was a kitchen,\nI\u2019m sure. And so, by the end of the night the furniture that they had brought in -- and you\nknow, Viennese furniture is not like this, Viennese furniture is --",
        "A: -- big. It has to have weight. And when you\u2019re left alone as a child in your room, it\ncreaks.",
        "A: It -- it\u2019s -- it -- it is alive and the wood shrinks and -- and you hear distinct, ghostly\ncreaks. Well, this [indecipherable] and -- and there were upside-down chairs. There were\ntables with their feet up. There were people sitting around crying. It was a -- it was a --\nsome kind of a battle scene. Not with -- with active battle, but something was wro --\neverything was wrong. Tables and chairs are supposed to have their f -- legs down and\nthese were upside-down on top of cupboards. And the Nazis kept turning the lights off\nand on. I mean that makes of -- the -- the practical jokes against the people over whom\nyou have power. The other thing that I remember very clearly is that Tante -- that -- that\nmy mo -- my friend -- my friend was called Dieter, and her mother had a brother who\ncame at that moment to hide out 1n our -- let me call it our apartment. Because they were\ntaking men from the apartment he was living in and of course walked straight into the\narms of the -- of -- of the Nazis and was taken away. I -- I don\u2019t re -- know -- don\u2019t\nremember the end of that story. What I do remember is the following days. It\u2019s such a\ncuriosity. I remember one of the men, one of the neighbor -- male neighbors, stayed in his\npajamas and whenever there was a ring or a knock at the door, he would get into bed as if\nhe could pretend he had some terrible disease and then they wouldn\u2019t take him away. I\nremember this man in the pajamas playing chess with one of the -- one of the children,\none of the boy children. There was just this sense of -- of oddity, of pecu -- of -- ofa\npeculiar world. And the funny -- a funny consciousness on my part that the man who kept\npretending he was sick was lying, and you\u2019re not supposed to lie.",
        "A: And also I -- that -- that is the -- that is one of the times that I do remember crying in\nterror, because it occurred to me at that moment I didn\u2019t know where my mother was.\nAnd I do remember sitting down and crying and being comforted by somebody.",
        "A: I think it was Dieter\u2019s mother, whose name at the moment I -- her father was Otto and\nhe was a -- he became a very dear friend, an old -- old -- older friend. He knew I was\nsmart and he liked it and he talked to me. He, like my Uncle Paul found that it was fun to\ntalk to me.",

        "A: -- who is very clever, at seven.\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: I think so. I think so it was.",
        "A: I remember some of the s -- comforting me with a hand, with a voice. Can\u2019t remember\nwhat they said, but I remember feeling what you might feel if you suddenly realized you\nwere in a -- in -- in -- in the supermarket and you had lost your -- you didn\u2019t know where\nyour mother was. It was that -- it was that experience. It suddenly came to me I didn\u2019t\nknow where she was.",
        "A: That\u2019s what -- yeah, that moment, yeah.",
        "A: Well, the whole --",
        "A: -- I understood the whole thing to be a -- a -- a mad scene.",
        "A: Something where everything was wrong. Everything wasn\u2019t the way it was supposed\nto be.",
        "A: That was Kristallnacht.",
        "A: That was --",
        "A: [indecipherable]. Now, there were much other stuff going on. There were -- there were\n-- this -- th-there were synagogues burning.",
        "A: A-All around Vienna, but I\u2019m -- I -- I knew that later, I did not know that at the time.",
        "A: It was not an experience.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It seems to me it is, yes. I think that\u2019s what mobilized my father. That this 1s -- of\ncourse, happens off-scene --",
        "A: -- that my mother wanted -- wanted -- my mother -- my parents by -- by this time now,\nmoved in with my grandparents, into this two bedroom little -- little -- little apartment,\nand my mother wa-was just waiting f -- to bring me home. And I think at this point what -\n- my father -- I mean, this -- I know this from my mother\u2019s story, that my fa-father said,\nshe\u2019s not going to stay here. And then he came to pick me up one day and it was within --\nit would seem to me within the week, within 10 days of this, while -- you know, I don\u2019t\nremember that condition of everybody living in this all -- I mean, we-well maybe some\n10 -- some 15 people living in, with all their furniture.",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember that -- they didn\u2019t -- never moved out again, so I must have moved\nout. My father picked me up and said, you\u2019re going to England. And I said, what do you\nmean I\u2019m going to England? Y -- we\u2019re going to eng -- he said, no, you\u2019re going to\nEngland. Mommy and I can\u2019t go. And he took me to a burned out Temple, that\u2019s the b --\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s why -- and that\u2019s when I knew. It was a round -- a round Temple,\na circular Temple, and when you walked across fallen lumber, it was gutted. And there\nwere people cleaning it out and then there were people that -- pa-parents and children\nhanging out down there. And then there were people standing up the stairs and along the\nwomen\u2019s gallery, waiting to be processed.",

        "A: But anyhow, I was told that I was going to go on this -- on -- on -- on this\nKindertransport. At this point my next memory is being with my grandparents and my\nparents 1n this little, very small apartment. And my -- I remember the evening before my\ndeparture, which was on a Thursday. Now, story.

And my mother, who wanted to do something special for me, said, I have\nto pack you food for three days, what shall I pack for you? And I couldn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t\nhungry. I couldn\u2019t think of anything. So I said, a wurst. Which 1s a sausage.",
        "A: And my mother said, I am going to get you a wurst.

If he got me on to the Kindertransport, he\nwas not the passive --",

She -- she didn\u2019t argue because the situation -- I\nmean, it was clear by this time, my father had tried every -- see, it wasn\u2019t the only thing\nhe did. He was the one who went from consulate to consulate. It was he who got our\nname onto -- on to the American quota, which is why I\u2019m sitting here today. So it wasn\u2019t\n-- it wasn\u2019t all that clear --",
        "A: -- it wasn\u2019t just that one thing. In my head it was the one thing, but my -- he quarreled\nwith my mother, they -- he was afraid of her going down.

And my father -- this I do remember very clearly, my father sort of standing\nme between his knees and saying, when you get to England, you have to talk to the\nEnglish people and you have to tell them to get out -- Mom-Mommy and me out, and the\ngrandparents, and Tante Milla and the twins.

And we had -- we were -- I don\u2019t\nknow at what point we were given the number 152, but it was certainly -- I-I think it\nmight have been when we got -- we -- here, we walked across the bridge and what I\nremember about that is seeing my father and mother talking over my head. They held my\nhand and over my head they were talking about how -- again, the la -- the conversation\nabout getting out of -- of -- out of Vienna. And my mother said something like why don\u2019t\nyou try the Dutch consulate, and my father saying here, you can go to China and go to\nBeying.

And I had a serious doubt on the subject. It seemed to me, in\nmy childish wisdom, reasonable to cry, and I was not doing it. Cause what I was thinking\nis, wow I\u2019m going to England. Cause I had counted. I had been to Austria and I had been\nto Hungary and I had been to Czechoslovakia. Now I was going to be -- go to -- to\nEngland, that\u2019s going to be four countries.",

I wonder\nif that\u2019s rare or whether that\u2019s -- and I always choose to assume first that this is a human\nthing you\u2019re doing, not -- not a special -- then you can check it out afterwards, but --",
        "A: You do -- you don\u2019t have a -- a -- a -- an observer who 1s fantastically interested?",

        "A: I\u2019m going to do a poll.",
        "A: Oh it\u2019s mostly in polls. But we get to an open field, an open -- a large open space\nbehind the [indecipherable], the west station.",
        "A: And there are innumerable bodies, people, it\u2019s dark, and there are people with poles on\nwhich there are placards that say something like -- mine particular said 100 to -- 0-o0-of --\none fi -- 150 to 200 -- to 190 -- 199, assuming, right?",
        "A: And I must have had my number before, because we\u2019re -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019re -- my parents\ntake me to this one thing.

And I looked -- and my mother was standing -- my mother had\na black pony fur. I\u2019ve always tried -- I -- when going into stores and said if they have a\npony fur, and they say, a what? Apparently there 1s no such thing as a pony fur, but that\u2019s\nwhat I thought my mother had. And it had a biz foc -- big fox collar, and inside that fox\ncollar was her face, and it was perfectly red and hot. And -- but except for its color, she\nmade a hi -- a -- a -- a monumental effort to neither cry nor look upset. In fact, she was\ntalking to me in what sounded like a normal voice.",
        "A: And we were just talking and I -- and my father must have been there but he was very\ntall and besides he was, as usual, a background figure. And then at somebody -- point,\nsomebody told us to line up. I think -- I seem to remember that we were supposed to be in\n-- in -- in -- in a group -- in four or so. And my mother put the rucksack on me, and she\ncarried the --",
        "A: -- the lu -- th-the -- the little suitcase. But she kept talking to me, she kept walking\nbeside me and talking until somebody from the organization [indecipherable] took the\nsuitcase and gave it to me, and the next thing I knew I was through the portal inside the\nstation, and my mother was no longer there. Now, I had a friend who believed that he\ncould elicit forgotten information.",
        "A: And it interested him because I said I remember my mother holding the suitcase, and I\nremember being inside the train. I seem not to have crossed the station, got onto the\nplatform, got onto the train, walked into the carriage. And he tried very hard, it was very\ninteresting. He tried to make -- he tried to retrieve the lost memory. I -- I mean, I tried\nvery hard.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t succeed, no, I can\u2019t do that, I can\u2019t do it, it\u2019s gone.",
        "A: No, because as a matter of fact, I was surprised when my mother was not -- oh yes, we\nsaid goodbye, we -- I kissed my mother, I must have kissed my father, and then -- but the\n-- but she continued to walk beside me after that --",
        "A: -- after that goodbye.",
        "A: And then I\u2019m inside the carriage and outside is my cousin Otto\u2019s girlfriend, with red\nhair and who knocked on the window. And I could, in those days, and for many, many a\ndecade later, stand on my head. So I got down on -- on my head and stood and wiggled\nmy toes. I was a great showoff. You see, my fa -- I had been -- my -- my family had\nbrought me up to be a showoff --",
        "A: -- they were always saying, oh she\u2019s so -- she can -- she can stand on her toes, she can",
        "A: [had got all this -- this -- all this reinforcement --",
        "A: -- yes. So I stood on my head for her. I think there were four children and four\nchildren. And I remember that it took an heck of a long time, too, for the train to go. It\nseemed to take forever. It didn\u2019t go and it didn\u2019t go and it didn\u2019t go. And we were being -\n- there was -- here\u2019s an interesting thing. The Kultusgemeinde is sent with us, of grown --\ngrown people to help us, to be with us.",
        "A: Who I think tha -- wi -- \u201cInto the Arms of Strangers\u201d backs up this memory of mine,\nthat they had agreed to go back. That if they were found to have bolted, there were going\nto be no more children\u2019s transports.",
        "A: And it seems to me so peculiar, that the Nazis who wanted us gone from the world,\ninsisted on these people coming back. There\u2019s so many inexplicable --",
        "A: -- and contradictory things in this -- in that -- this [indecipherable]. Why not make our\nexit easy? They made it difficult as possible. What was that about? You know, I always\nremember the story of the pharaoh and the -- and the gi -- a-and the -- and the Hebrews.\nHe wanted them gone, but wouldn\u2019t let them go. What gives? That\u2019s such a -- such a\npeculiar --",
        "A: Isn\u2019t there?",
        "A: And there\u2019s something psychologically peculiar there. Go, but don\u2019t go. Get out of\nhere, but --",
        "A: -- we\u2019re gonna close -- or -- close the doors. Very strange. So these people came with\nus and as far as I know, stayed a couple of days in the camps to settle us, and then went\nback.",
        "A: Went back into the -- into -- into hell -- into the hellhole. Meanwhile, it was -- that --\nthat was an exciting -- exciting train ride. First of all, the tension and the -- the usual\nnastiness between children, who was going to sit by the window. If you were going to lie\ndown, somebody else had to stand up for awhile. And then it got to be your turn to sit and\nthe other person to lie down. And there were th -- always the girl who would not get up,\nwho wa --",
        "A: All the way to heaven or hell, that\u2019s got to be the person --",

        "A: All girls -- all girls.",
        "A: No, no, there were some older wome -- older girls.",
        "A: So, I mean, the older would be 14 or 15.",
        "A: I was 10. There was a smaller child whom I wanted to make friends with, but she was\n-- she was -- I th -- always connected her with the child crying on the -- on the tram, but\nthere\u2019s no reason to think that she was. I always -- I think I always thought she -- it was --",
        "A: And she -- she wouldn\u2019t give up her suitcase, she held it on her lap and wouldn\u2019t let it\ngo. Then came o -- and the -- and the -- the helper, the woman would come in and -- and\nsay everything\u2019s okay, settle down, we\u2019ll go in a little bit. When I got -- was supposed to\nget up to give my place to somebody, I ha -- either remember or have created the good\ngirl, the -- the -- the saintly girl who had never slept. I -- I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s true,\nbut she certainly was very sweet, very kind to me. She sent me to go wash my face in the\nbathroom, where I discovered the pleasures of green soap. Because you could turn it\nupside-down and green soap would come out.",
        "A: And the other thing that I discovered 1s that if you go to the toilet and you pee and\nthen you put your foot down, the thing opens up so that the --",
        "A: -- pee can go through. But you could also see the rails go underneath.",
        "A: Oh, there\u2019s a lot of fun going on in the bathroom.",
        "A: I was on a train all the time from -- from Vienna to -- to my grandparents.",
        "A: But I don\u2019t know that that was a proper train, that -- that didn\u2019t count. I don\u2019t\nremember any of these charms --",
        "A: -- of the bathroom.",
        "A: So finally I had to get out because people wanted to get in. I also remember the\nexperience of -- th-there\u2019s always something interesting for children to watch other\npeople sleeping.",
        "A: I remember being rather terrified at seeing my father sleep at some point. That seemed\nvery unnatural. He was supposed to be up, I was suppo -- but to go along this -- that train\nand look in and see children sleeping was very interesting. I remember it. I remember\npeople in the act of waking up and sitting up and looking sort of as if -- you know how\npeople sit up, but they\u2019re still asleep?",
        "A: I remember seeing that. I -- I enjoyed that.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember that.",
        "A: I reme -- then I remember when we got to the border and the Nazis came in, the border\ncontrale. And that was really terrifying. That I remember being terrifying, because they\nwent from -- not carriage, what is it? Ca -- what do you call the -- the -- the subdivision,\nthe -- the -- the cabin.",
        "A: And they t -- from our one they took one child out, and don\u2019t know what happened,\nbut she came back and she looked -- she looked frightened. And I remember we didn\u2019t\nask her what had happened.",
        "A: She must have been searched. I don\u2019t think anything more than --",
        "A: -- happened than that. But the -- the girls, the older girls said to us, you mustn\u2019t move.\nAnd so we all sat down like that. You know, when you sit there like that you begin to --",
        "A: -- vibrate, yes.",
        "A: Was no reason for us to sit like that, but it was something to do, I think, to be scared.\nIt -- it -- it\u2019s almo -- it\u2019s almost like an occupation. To sit like that 1s better than -- cause\nyou can\u2019t do nothing when you --",
        "A: And then the Nazi, they got off again and the train went on --",
        "A: -- into the -- into the charms of -- of being welcomed in Holland. And be given\nchocolate and apples and it was very sweet, that.",
        "A: Yeah.\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "A: There is a moment -- y-you\u2019re on a platform and people, women are coming and\nhanding you -- I mean, you are -- you\u2019re 1n the train.",
        "A: On the platform are these women and they\u2019re handing you food, apples, chocolate, hot\nchocolate to drink, chocolate. We -- the train starts up again. The children -- we\u2019re all at\nthe windows looking out and this way and we\u2019re singing g -- wha -- I wa -- I forget how\nyou say that in -- in German, something Princess Juliana -- Ju-Juliana, yes?",

        "A: Has to be the other way around. But it certainly, at some point somebody says, we are\nout. It -- it has to be. The scene of the -- of the platf -- people being on this platform has\nto be afterwards --",
        "A: -- except it -- I can\u2019t make it do that. [Il tell you why I can\u2019t do -- make it do that in\nmy memory. Because somebody says we\u2019re out and immediately the -- the train doors\nopen up and the boys come in. We were --",

And I was hugging somebody, somebody was hugging me. Now, the reason I\ncannot make my memory produce the scene at the -- when we were given the food after\nthat -- because I remember going to sleep in the middle of this. That\u2019s what memory\ndoes. And I remember that the very next thing that ha -- that happened was that\nsomebody was putting my rucksack onto me -- I di -- one of the older girls, or one of the\nhelpers, putting my rucksack on a-and identifying my suitcase and standing me down in\nthe very cold air on the platform. So th -- I mean, you know, I -- obviously, this is\nlogically not possible, but that\u2019s -- that\u2019s how --",
        "A: -- that\u2019s what memory, or memory does to me.",

Imagine after -- this was a day and a\nday, a night -- a day -- a night, a day, a night. And now you\u2019re in a little room that has a\nwhite bed with white sheets. And I had a worry, I had a problem. I couldn\u2019t brush my\nteeth and what would my mommy think if I didn't brush my teeth, so that worried me.\nAnd I had another worry. I had been to -- I had been told that when you go on the water\nyou throw up. So I went, got into bed, and I prayed. I-I was sorry I hadn\u2019t -- I hadn\u2019t\nbrushed my teeth. I hoped God would not met -- let me throw up and please don\u2019t get --\ntake my parents to the -- away [indecipherable].

Almost always men, but not\nentirely.",
        "A: So your parents being taken away, your father being taken away, it was just -- it wa --\nit was what happened instead of going to the office.",
        "A: So -- and then I remember this black steward coming in and I\u2019m s -- I said to him, am\nI going to throw up? And he said no, what you do is you put your head down and you go\nright to sleep and then you won\u2019t throw up. Oh, and I also asked him -- he had brought\nme something that looked like coffee and he said, no tea. And I said white tea? And he\nsaid, tea with milk. Which was my first experience of English tea.",

I have to tell you about the\nsausage.",

And here\ncomes another wrong memory. I was processed, and now I c-could -- could go with my\ncoat, no suitcase, down the gangplank. What I remember is going down the gangplank\nentirely by myself, seeing an empty dock with workers standing, watching, and that there\nwas a mist, a -- aS -- a-- a -- one of those English -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s like -- it\u2019s like as if\nmist had been decimated and was hanging in the air, going down to a huge glass and tron\nhangar where were rows and rows of suitcases and I was told to get mine. And the notion\nof finding mine in all this seemed to me a nightmare. So I sat down and cried some more.\nAnd somebody came and of course all they did was look at the number and then go to the\nnumber.",

My\nmother was a -- became a wonderful cook. She liked -- she liked the lady she -- she\nworked for, to some degree. She -- my father -- you know, I have a memory, I don\u2019t\nknow whether that\u2019s in \u201cOther People\u2019s Houses\u201d or not, of visiting, when I eventually\nvisited my mother at the school holidays. I remember sitting in the kitchen when my\nmother was in the scullery, and my mother was wash -- maybe it is in there -- was\nwashing dishes. And I looked in bec -- and the steam was rising, and in the steam was my\nmother whistling in the sweetest ma -- most beautiful -- she was a wonderful whistler.\nShe was whistling some -- something, I forget what, but 1t was extraordinarily lovely.\nNow, there was nothing -- actually, my father did like nature. This -- this man from the --\nfrom the bank -- from the -- h-he did like the chickens. He did like pottering at -- put-\nputtering around. But he was ill, he was not able to -- to use the language he knew. He\nwas within -- within a -- a couple of months of having -- having a stroke.",
        "A: And he could not understand ho-how you wait at table, giving food from the left and\ntaking away from the right. Left and right were beyond him in that -- in that condition. So\nmy mother would do the cooking, take off her kitchen -- kitchen -- kitchen apron, put on\nthe service apron and wa -- go in and serve for him and come back and take off the c --\nput on the other ga -- and make the next -- next course and go in and serve it.

        "A: But I saw it. I saw that he was making her life yet more difficult. And you know\nwhere I saw it? Later on in Guilford. The Jewish doctor saw it. He saw that she was\nwearing herself. Wasn\u2019t even aware that she was doing all the housework, going to visit\nhim in the hospital, going back to cook dinner and coming back in the morning.",

        "A: -- beyond the possible. But I was very angry at my father for being ill, for making life\nso hard for her. For the unreas -- his unreasonableness, in his illness. I have thought that\nmy father\u2019s illness, in the weight, in the -- in the -- in the dread of it, was as bad as Hitler.\nI mean, the experience of Hitler was no worse than the experience of my father\u2019s ongoing\nillness.

I used to -- I had this notion, I think I describe it, I had that notion that\nthings never happen when you expect them, or from the direction in which you\u2019re\nlooking for them. Which resulted in my notion that if I kept imagining my f -- well, the\nthings that could be happening to my father at any given moment, that\u2019s not what was\ngoing to happen. Kept me once again like before, very busy trying to keep on top of all\npossibility so that it -- to prevent it from happening. I mean, h-he -- he had the -- he had\nstrokes, one after the other. I was going to prevent another stroke by imagining him\nhaving a stroke. That\u2019s hard work. And there was my mother at that time, we\u2019re now in\nGuilford. We\u2019re -- we\u2019re many -- many -- many ha -- e-events, many adventures later,\nand she\u2019s working as a cook down in a subterranean kitchen, which I could look down\ninto, because that -- there was a grate, right? So here\u2019s my father, continuing to be -- to\nhave -- to bother her by having strokes, and here she is down, working in the kitchen.",

And I would have my -- I had my bag here like that\nand I had my hand in it on a book. And I kept wondering, I wonder if it\u2019s okay for me to\ntake out my book and read while I\u2019m sitting next to my father who is now eating. I\u2019m\nvisiting him.",
        "A: Never.",
        "A: No, never took it out. And I kept my finger in the pages.",
        "A: He was not -- he -- he kept saying that he wanted my mother to take him home. So I\nwould yell at him, please don\u2019t suggest that to her, because she\u2019ll do it, right? Then he\nsaid, I wish she would write to Paul -- my Uncle Paul, who had -- who had stopped short\nof getting a doctor\u2019s certification, as if maybe my uncle\u2019s information, medical\ninformation, could save him.",

He was\na railroad stoker. I mean, it\u2019s so sweet to think of somebody being a stoker. That meant\nhe was the person who put the fuel in the place that makes the train go.",
        "A: He was a -- a -- a union man, a -- a charming, witty fellow. He had a wife who played\nthe piano. He ha -- who in -- sta -- stammered. And two daughters, one of whom I\u2019m still\nin touch with --",
        "A: -- Mari. Mari -- oh, this is an interesting story. I -- oh it -- probably shouldn\u2019t even tell\nthis story because it was told me in confidence, but it\u2019s so long ago. There was also --\nthese are people, these are working class people who take in the Jewish refugee child and\nthey also took in the orphan from the orphanage. And the orphan from the orphanage was\na horror. His name -- I call him Albert, I think his name was Harold.

And a -- at some point we were wa --\nMari and I went to go to the public school -- oh -- ra -- or the -- the -- th-the s -- city\nschool, and we both won a -- a -- a -- a -- what do you -- what do you call it, a -- a-- a--a\n-- we were -- both could have gone to the -- what she called the la-ti-da school, and told\nme that she wasn\u2019t going to go because it would -- it would betray her class.

        "A: -- and I went. Now, many, many, many, many years later, I was in vi -- was in\nEngland and I -- Mari and her husband, a -- who was an engineer, a ship -- shipbuilder\u2019s\nengineer, came to see me and I reminded her of this. And she said, that wasn\u2019t why I\ndidn\u2019t go. I went because my mother told me that my sister Joy had not made the\nexamination and there would be bad blood in -- in the family if I went. So that\u2019s why I\ndidn\u2019t go. I said, Mari, would you do the same thing with your children? She said, are\nyou kidding? A-And -- well then Mari -- and then it was Mari -- what I said in the book,\nand what I believed was that the discrepancy between our education finally got too much\nfor the Gillams and they said I had to leave. They also had an aunt, a blind aunt who\nneeded to be taken care of.",

Mari then\nwent to the bathroom, and John, her husband, said to me, that was not why they -- you\nknow why they sent you away? Because Harold attacked Mari and tried to rape her, and\nthey wanted to get you out of the house.

They had a daughter called Ruby who went -- who was a -- a ladies\u2019\nmaid, I -- a -- across town, who went to stay with a neighbor so that they could give me\nher room.

That\u2019s the kind of people they were, they really a -- th-they were and\nare extraordinary. These were people who were -- y-you see, they were good in the way\nm-most of my -- my m-m -- foster parents were not. They did their duty, but these people\ndid their duty out of some -- out of some -- some heart -- un-unthinking heart.",
        "A: I always -- I -- I love them. I -- I really think they were -- they were -- they were\nextraordinary. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s it -- almost a -- a -- almost a view of what -- what the world\ncould be like.",
        "A: First of all, the mill is absolutely gorgeous, and -- and -- and it\u2019s built over -- over a\nwa -- arunning water, with the mill wheel, though broken, still -- still there, and the\nwatercress growing on the side.",
        "A: I mean, it\u2019s just physically beautiful.",
        "A: And we all -- we go spend summers there sometime.",
        "A: Yeah. But there\u2019s a great difference between that kind of goodness and that other\nprincipled goodness. I mean that difference -- I\u2019m making the difference there. Miss\nWallace certainly was -- was -- was good-natured and -- and -- and --",
        "A: -- careful. Miss wa -- Miss Ellis, the older one was -- was not. She was doing her duty.",
        "A: Oh, it --",
        "A: -- and I -- as I -- as I then add, I have not done the same. I have not taken in alien\nchildren. Most of us don\u2019t do that.",
        "A: Most of us don\u2019t. Most of us have perfectly good reasons for not doing it, but they did\nit. The Cohens, the Gillams, the -- all of them, and -- and I find it amazing.",
        "A: Think what -- I think what it\u2019s like to have a child in your house.",
        "A: You know, I didn\u2019t have to be a nasty child, I was just a child.",
        "A: And all that involves and all the -- all the thought, all the -- all the -- the -- the noise,\nthe mess. And then they go and menstruate.",
        "A: Yeah. I tho -- I think they were -- I think the English were just wonderful, they were\nwon -- ama -- wa -- amazingly wonderful.",
        "A: I was hearing the bombs. Guilford was on the route from London to wherever the --\nthe -- the bombers came from.",
        "A: So you see a double -- a double -- ah, you would see our bombers fly in this classic\nformation, to bomb what they were going to bomb. In the morning we would open the\nwindows and watch them come back and you would see where there were holes in the\nformation. You could count how many had been --",
        "A: -- had been shot down. Meanwhile, the bombers flying back, would very often unload\n-- unlike Graf Bobby, they would unload and we would very often have bombs in the\nvicinity. They were not -- we were not targets, but they would unload before they flew\nback.",
        "A: There was a lot of bombing. I remember lying in bed thinking, where there ever be a\ntime where there will not be bombs dropped? Later in the war, there were the\ndoodlebugs. Do you remember? Do you hear about? They were self-propelled and they\nmade a very particular noise, they went bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz, and then they stopped.\nAnd we were, at that point already knew you -- I forget, you ca -- a count of five and they\nwould explode.",
        "A: And that\u2019s when you wondered whether you were the one they were exploded on top\nof.",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember when that became conscious.",
        "A: That is Ruth Kluger\u2019s.",
        "A: Her story of -- of the -- of th -- her shock at the unwillingness of the Jews in England\nand in America to -- to want to hear --",
        "A: -- to want to think about that.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know --",
        "A: -- the answer to that.",
        "A: Iam -- Iam shocked that I don\u2019t know the answer to that.",
        "A: Now wa -- the -- but England a -- 1s in the war in a way that really, the States don\u2019t --",
        "A: Miss Ellis -- when -- when France fell, Miss -- the -- they create -- they were --\nimagine of -- pieces of concrete, about this high with ab -- as -- a pole of iron. Imagine\nfour of them. Imagine those poles connected with barbed wire, and they went across the\nwhole of England, including through Miss Ellis\u2019s rose garden, to keep out the invasion,\nthe -- the German a -- the Germans. Miss el -- Miss Wallace, she\u2019s the one who -- the --\nthe -- the member of the refugee committee, collected our refugee\u2019s paper, put them in\nboxes, ready to bury them, so that the nat -- the in -- the incoming Nazis would not --",
        "A: -- identify the Jews.",
        "A: I mean, it was, in -- in a sense that you were about to be invaded. That it didn\u2019t happen\nwas, I think a surprise. They would change the names of ro -- of streets. They would\nrearrange street names to --",
        "A: -- to confuse. It just a -- it just happened now to happen, but -- but England was\nentirely -- and there was the Home Guard. My mother was so anxious to play her part that\nshe and m -- an-and my singing teacher from school were Home Guards together to -- to\nwalk up and down the street. And she did -- see, this is where m -- where my fa -- where I\nwas angry with my father. My father had lost the lo -- was becoming -- a -- e -- couldn\u2019t\nwalk any more, couldn\u2019t -- he -- he was becoming senile. And my mother did not only\nher own evening, but his as well. My mother paid the -- the -- the -- the refugee\ncommittee paid for my private school and my mother insisted on giving them 15 dollars a\nmonth.",
        "A: I still have the -- 15 shillings, 15 shillings.",
        "A: I still have the roster of -- of her payments, which 1s really very touching. She\nabsolutely wanted to do everything that was possible to be part of the -- of the solution.",
        "A: And -- except here. Here is where we -- here is where we differ. One of the other miss\n-- miss -- Mrs. Biddle of the refugee committee, when I had finished high school, called\nme in and said you know, your mother is working, your father is so ill -- I had applied for\ncollege and got into c -- University of London. And she said, you know you can\u2019t go.\nYou know that, don\u2019t you? You have to go to work. And I went home and said to my\nmother, she doesn\u2019t -- she thinks I\u2019m not going to go to college. She thinks I\u2019m going to\nwork. My mother said, oh, it\u2019s just ridiculous. Ridiculous.",
        "A: Thinking about -- what\u2019s she talking about? Of course you\u2019re going to college. The\nmindset, the Jewish mindset.",
        "A: This is towards the end of the war.",
        "A: Yes. \u201945 -- I went to college in --",
        "A: -- 45.",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "A: The -- what -- what was the last -- I don\u2019t know what is the last day of the last week.\nLiterally, the week before the end of the European war. I mean, the Japanese war went on\nfor some time.",
        "A: \u201945, yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: He dies the week before.",
        "A: I did have a paroxysm of crying when I first heard, and then I couldn\u2019t.",
        "A: Couldn\u2019t do it any more.",
        "A: Well, the relief takes one of the evil forms. I dream of hearing my father\u2019s tap tap of\nhis stick and I\u2019m appalled. And wake up feeling monstrous.",
        "A: After my father died, my mother had a brief breakdown of her own, but it took the\nform of buying a pink dress, and almost acquiescing in having an affair with his doctor, at\nleast going around the block with him, and being invited to coffee.",
        "A: But she -- she couldn\u2019t --",
        "A: -- she couldn\u2019t -- she couldn\u2019t do it. But she did buy the pink dress.",
        "A: She told me, I bought a pink dress. I said, you mean a dull pink. She said, a pink dress.",
        "A: I mean, she wore it twice and then -- and then abandoned it, but -- you see, when I tell\nmy students, assume that when something happens you will not react the way you think,\nit\u2019s only another example.",
        "A: With -- with white dots.",
        "A: Paul -- Uncle Paul came to England with his wife Edith.",
        "A: A very beloved, a very, very passionate young -- young love. They were in the\nmidlands, he was working as a farmer. He was over 60 and he was a --",
        "A: -- a German speaking enemy alien. He finds himself in -- on the Isle of Man with\nEdith still somewhere and speaking not a word of English, in the midlands, living on a\nfarm where she knows nobody and there\u2019s nobody -- now this is that moment when the --\nwhen somebody comes to the camp and says, who would like to go to the Dominican\nRepublic, and everybody says, in the what? Who\u2019s heard the Dominican Republic?",
        "A: And Paul says, will I be reunited with my wife and they say sure.",
        "A: That\u2019s how --",
        "A: -- Paul gets to the Dominican Republic. When he -- he got there -- domin --\nDominican Republic was -- was the attempt to set up -- make up a settlement of -- of t --\nEuropean farmers, taught by American experts on goodness knows what, certainly not\ntropical farming. And I c -- Ic -- this is too long a story, though it\u2019s awfully interesting.\nYou should -- you should have somebody talk to you about [indecipherable] really --",
        "A: -- it\u2019s really -- but that\u2019s a whole -- that\u2019s its own story. Edith died of -- I -- in the store\n-- in the -- in the -- see, this is what you can do with a novel. I -- I -- I did not want to put\nPaul through what actually happened, so what -- I made her die in childbirth, which is not\nwhat happened. She was pregnant, but died actually of blood poisoning.",
        "A: After having touched a -- a -- a spot on her face, and I think blood poisoning 1s a s -- is\na Sl -- aS -- you know, grows as rapidly as the pla -- as tropical plants. By the time they\ngot her to Puerta Plata to the hospital, she was already dying or dead. And as I say, I think\nthey hurried up -- m-my theory is, my theory, my belief, my fantasy, my knowledge is\nthat they got Paul his parents. That -- that -- that th-they got out --",
        "A: -- yeah.",
        "A: He was going to go crazy, I think with his grief and -- and -- and when my unc -- Paul\nfound that he could not physically do the land work. So they set up in a shop for him,\ncalled Productus [indecipherable] where the -- where the cheese and sausages and\nwhatever were sold in the nearby middle -- mid-mid -- little town called Santiago de los\nCaballeros. And my -- when my grandfather became ill, Paul called my mother who was\n-- she and I were living in London, I was going to University of London, to please come\nand help. Help in the shop, help with my grandfather. And my -- and we agreed that I\nwould finish -- get my degree and then join my mother.",
        "A: All this time we were waiting for the American quota. I mean, it took us from August\n\u00b038 til May *51 for the quota to come through. But one of my -- one of my thoughts these\ndays is, if -- this was 48, if it had been \u201978, I would have said to my mother, I really like\nit in England.",
        "A: Pll come visit. Never oc -- what interests me is it never entered my mind --",
        "A: -- that I could say that to her. It isn\u2019t that I fought valiantly to -- to do what I had\npromised, it never occurred to me --",
        "A: -- that -- that I had that choice.",
        "A: And I think that really is a -- a -- a difference of the decades, don\u2019t you think?",
        "A: That a -- a g -- a-- a young woman of 21 -- of 20 --",
        "A: -- would -- would stay in England if she chose to stay in England.",
        "A: So I finished my degree.",
        "A: Went to the Dominican Republic via Trinidad by -- by boat to Trinidad. There were\nonly three flights a week from Trinidad to the Dominican Republic. Just to give a sense\nof it --",
        "A: -- of the changing of -- I went to stay with my uncle -- with -- with -- with the -- with -\n- with the f-family in S-Santiago. It was interesting that they would not let me help in --\nin the shop. It was still assumed that I was made for better things. It\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s funny. My\nmother worked there, my grandfather worked there, my grandmother --",
        "A: -- everybody. It never occurred to them.",
        "A: Another things that doesn\u2019t occur to people, right? Didn\u2019t occur to them I was going to\nbe a shop girl. I was going to go to sh -- to [indecipherable], live there and teach English.",
        "A: Not work. Didn\u2019t occur to me, didn\u2019t occur to them.",
        "A: Well, I started wri -- I mean, she read it --",
        "A: -- in the book, yes.",
        "A: She was, of course, fascinated by the book.",
        "A: Which 1s dedicated to her. No, she didn\u2019t -- I-I mean, I don\u2019t think the sausage meant\nto her what it meant to me.",
        "A: She didn\u2019t think, oh here if I give them a sausage. That was my experience.",
        "A: Yes. For her not at all.",
        "A: Well, let me go back a little bit.",
        "A: My -- my Uncle Paul -- my father had died in England in 45.",
        "A: My uncle\u2019s wife Edith died in the Dominican Republic at age 21. My f -- grandfather\ndied in the Dominican re -- is buried in the Dominican Republic, in 40-something. My\nfather had put our name down on the American quota in ma -- in August \u201938, and our\nquota came through in *51. But it ca -- it came -- th-the quota was -- was given out\ndepending on land of birth. So my grandmother went -- came to ing -- to New York first.\nMy Uncle Paul -- she was Hungarian quota. My Uncle Paul was on the -- on the Viennese\nquota, came next, and my mother and I came next. So the remnant of the family, whoever\nwas leftover and hadn\u2019t died, all came to New York by 1951.",
        "A: I was on -- my mother and I were on the -- both on the Viennese quota, yeah.",
        "A: But it also depended on when you had put your name on this -- on this list.",
        "A: Or goodness knows what else it depended on.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes",
        "A: Oh yes, and -- and I thought, because I had this degree in -- in th -- in English\nliterature I was going to get some wonderful job.",
        "A: But what I ended up was filing.",
        "A: In Queens, in a shoe factory. Badly.",
        "A: No, I\u2019m not good on -- on -- on filing details.",
        "A: Oh yes. And I had been writing by the -- I mean, in a way I been writing since 1938 --",
        "A: -- in sa -- no, in \u201939 I was already writing.",
        "A: And in -- in -- when I came to the -- to New York, I -- I discovered, because\nsomebody asked me a question, somebody asked m -- I kept thinking I\u2019ve got nothing to\nwrite about. Finished. I\u2019ve shot my wad. I have not been in love, I\u2019ve not died, what di --\nwhat -- what -- what am I supposed to write about? And then I was -- I went to the -- I\nwent to a -- the new school fo-for social research and took a course in creative writing.\nAnd in one of those sessions, or rather in a party afterwards, somebody said, so how did\nyou come to the United States? And I had been thinking that everybody knew all those\nstories. You saw them on the newsreels. I knew them, everybody I knew knew them.\nThat was nothing to write about, but being asked that question, how did you get here, I\nbegan to tell my stories. And the room was silent. And I had the experience, which I\u2019ve\nhad often since, having been a teacher of me talking, other people listening.",
        "A: Delicious.",
        "A: So I realized I actually did have a theme and I began to write the stories.",
        "A: In -- and when I first came in \u201951, they didn't get published until -- \u00b062 they began to\nbe published.",
        "A: Yeah. They were published in \u201cThe New Yorker\u201d between \u201962 and \u201964 and then -- but\nlook what a -- what a -- what a long --",
        "A: -- a long haul.",
        "A: No. Well, I was going to write anyway, that would have --",
        "A: -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s all I\u2019m really good at doing. So [indecipherable]",
        "A: Thank you, Joan. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Thank you for inviting me to do this.",
        "A: These are my mother\u2019s parents, my grandmother Rosa Stern -- Shtern and my\ngrandfather Josey Shtern. Do you need more than that?",
        "A: And they we -- my Uncle Paul was able to bring them from Vienna to the Dominican\nRepublic even after the war started, I think in -- in 1940, which was a remarkable thing to\nmanage.",
        "A: This is my father\u2019s mother, Gisele Groszmann, who died -- she -- well, she and her\nhusband died before my mother was married -- my mother and father were married. They\nlived in Pressbourg, and I know very little about them, except that my mother was once\nmistaken for her. So maybe there was a little family resemble -- a non-family\nresemblance. I think the greengrocer addressed my mother as Gisele Groszmann.",
        "A: The child is Franzi, Franzi Stern. She is my -- my mother -- th -- the -- my mother as a\nlittle girl, and I want you to know that my grandmother made all her dresses for her.",
        "A: And the other one is my mother at, I would say, she -- this 1s already in the United\nStates, so it must be after fif -- after 51. I can\u2019t do arithmetic fast enough to figure, but\nthis is -- this is how I remember her.\nQ2: And when was this picture taken?",
        "A: This is my mother in her late 90\u2019s. She died in -- a-at -- three months before her 101*\nbirthday. She disliked this picture very much, but it was taken by a painter called\nKatherine Kadish, who -- who loved my mother and who thought she was very beautiful\nin her late old age. I love that picture.\nQ2: Okay, go ahead.",
        "A: My mother lived in her own apartment on the ground floor of the building in which I\nlive on the 12\" floor and she was able to stay at home until she was 97, and only spent\nthe last four years in a nursing home, quite close -- some 16 blocks -- 13 blocks out from\nwhere I live.",
        "A: This is my father, Ignatz Groszmann. He was an accountant in a bank. He had been an\nofficer in the Austrian army, briefly, I think. And my mother -- I -- my mother married\nhim, firstly because he asked her, and secondly because he was not like all the -- the\ncrude and joke-y salesmen who came to my grandfather\u2019s store in Fischamend and\nwanted to marry her.\nQ2: And who\u2019s this little cherub?",
        "A: This 1s little Lore, age about four or five, I imagine, 1n -- in Hammerling Park, which\nwas the park very close to where we lived, which I went -- went to see when I went back\nto Vienna and where I remember the words, kina Juden, no Jews, during the Hitler\nperiod.\nQ2: And on the left?",
        "A: In the left, my father had -- always had August off from his bank job, and we would\nalways spend a month in the Austrian Alps. This is my father, mother and me biting my\nnails, because my parents had decided I needed some little other kid to play with and they\ngot -- they found -- somewhere found this little boy who was Hungarian, didn\u2019t speak a\nword of English.\nQ2: And what\u2019s this photograph?",
        "A: These are my dolls. I\u2019m not sure that I was that interested in ma -- as babies, but I did\nlike to arrange them. No, really.\nQ2: And this shot?",
        "A: Yes.\nQ2: What\u2019s this?",
        "A: This 1s the ti -- a little older Lore, doing her homework.",
        "A: I would have to guess six, seven? I\u2019m trying to think of my grandchildren, trying to\nguess how old I would be at that a -- at that -- with that look.\nQ2: And this group shot here?",
        "A: It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it seems to be posed for -- for some very s-stiff photograph -- I\u2019m sorry\nI\u2019m screwing up.\nQ2: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Have you already d-d-di --this --\nQ2: Who -- who is in the shot here?",
        "A: Oh, oh. It\u2019s my father on -- on the left, my grandmother in the middle, my Uncle Paul\nstanding behind -- who was then a medical student. Little Lore on the table and my\nmother, Franzi. This is a formal shot made for perhaps my grandfather\u2019s birthday or\nsomething like that.",
        "A: Three, two? Two or three.\nQ2: And where was this document here?",
        "A: This is the lifesaving document. You will see it says, this document requires no visa.\nAnd the attempt to get visas and -- and -- and permits and everything at the same time\nwas a -- an almost impossible job. So the -- the Kult-Kultusgemeinde in Vienna and the\nBloomsbury House and the State Department in England cooked up this particular way of\nfacilitating the -- the imi -- the emigration of children, but only children without parents.\nAnd this is the document that got me onto the Kindertransport and from Vienna to\nEngland.\nQ2: And what does this represent?",
        "A: It is actually not the camp to which we -- 1n -- in which we were housed while they\nwere find -- trying to find foster parents for us, but it is the closest thing that exists today,\nor rather this is the only picture that -- that -- that I could find of such a camp, such a\nworker\u2019s camp, which were used for the children. And this is the kind of view that I\nwould have had -- that we would have had from the bus, from the top of the bus, after the\ncrossing the channel and arriving, this is the view we would have had, with the ocean\nbehind it and this little -- little s -- little town of little -- little houses in which we were\nhoused while we were in the camp.\nQ2: And what about this picture?",
        "A: The family Cohen, whom I -- my first foster parents, bought me a little coat and then\nthey took me to the -- to the photographer to have a picture to send to my parents and I\nwas 11 years old, or almost 11. This would be 1930 -- \u201939, early 1939.\nQ2: And who is this couple?",
        "A: This is my -- this -- these are my first foster parents, L-Lena Cohen and the -- her\nhusband, whose name I can\u2019t remember. I do remember that he was very dear and very\nquiet and didn\u2019t ec -- expect anything of me except for me to sit next to him while we --\nand look into the fire, whereas Auntie Lena insisted that I call her Auntie Lena and I\ncould never get myself to do it. This picture was given me by their youngest daughter\nRuth, who was my friend and champion and with whom I am still in touch. And who\nspeaks very lovingly of -- of these two parents.\nQ2: And this shot, Lore?",
        "A: It\u2019s a picture of my father, my mother and me, age about 14. I think what -- what is\nmost the -- moving and sad 1s the degree of my father\u2019s illness and the deterioration.\nQ2: And who are these?",
        "A: These are the three children of the family of the munitions worker, whose name I can\u2019t\nremember, but who took me in after the first family, the Gillams could no longer keep\nme. I remember taking -- after I was told they could not take me, I remember borrowing a\nbicycle and -- and going to -- essentially going to interview their mother to see if -- if I\nwould be taken in by them.\nQ2: And who is this?",
        "A: This is Miss Wallace, one of the two ladies -- one of the two ladies with whom I lived\nin Guilford. She -- I -- and her -- and her dog, her favorite dog, she was -- I -- what I can s\n-- tell you about it is that she bought one house to take care of -- of -- of a -- of\npauperized gentlefolk and another house to house refugees like my parents. She was a -- a\n-- a-- amarvelously good woman. And I -- probably the -- probably a companion to the\nother, older woman called Miss Ellis. And this was -- they took me in when I came to --\nto Guilford, and I lived with them for some four years.\nEnd of Tape Ten\nConclusion of Interview\n"
