        "Answer: My names is Sigmund Strochlitz.",
        "Q: And when and where you were born.",
        "A: I was born in Bendezin, on the first day of Hanukkah 1916. But my parents registered me\nFebruary first, 1917 to make me younger.",
        "Q: Can you tell us the full name of both of your parents?",
        "A: My father\u2019s name was Herman and my mother\u2019s name was Rifka.",
        "Q: Di -- your mother\u2019s maiden name?",
        "A: Yes, Kermer.",
        "Q: Can you spell that?",
        "A: K-e-r-m-e-r.",
        "Q: And do you know the names of your grandparents?",
        "A: Yes. I know -- I know the first name of my grandfather, who I admired. His name was -- was\nMorchai. The -- my grandmother\u2019s name I have forgotten.",

        "A: Yes. It -- no, my maternal.",

        "Q: And on the other side, do you re --",
        "A: No, my father grew up as a -- after his par -- parents -- his parents died very, very early at his\nage.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit about the town that you born in, and that you grew up in?",
        "A: Yes. There were 31,000 Jews living in Bendezin. Of course there\u2019s not a trace of them today\nin that town. Life was very interesting and families were extremely close. My grandfather lived\nacross the street from our home. Life was not abundant in riche -- riches, but somehow we -- we\nfelt that we are destined to play an important role in the life of humankind, that we have given\nthe world the 10 commandments, not in order to achieve power, but to set moral examples. To\nset standards of how to deal, how men should deal with God, how men should deal with -- with\nman. I went, as a youngster to a religious, Zionist school. I stayed there for about four years and\nthen my parents transferred me into a secular [indecipherable] school. I remember Friday --\nFridays very well. My mother wil -- getting up very early, going to buy [indecipherable] chicken.\nAnd there was excitement of a Friday. Saturday morning I used to go with my grandfather, and\nsometimes with my father to pray. The town on Saturday was completely engulfed in silence.\nYou see only Jewish people marching to the synagogue, quietly. The prayers were -- were\n[indecipherable] and you felt some sacredness in the air. I loved those Fridays and I loved those\nSaturdays. Furthermore, I remember that Jews from its -- Jews from surrounding towns were\ncoming to our town in order to buy chicken, fish and bring them into the shochet, the ritual\nslaughterer. They were -- they were buying all -- always for the whole week and then came the\nnext Friday again. I was extremely happy in school, learning about Zionism, learning about --\nabout Jewish religion, and developing an extremely fond love for the Jewish people. The city --\nthe cultural life in the city was on a very high level. There was a Jewish theater, there was a\nJewish newspaper. There was a voluntary symphony orchestra. There was a -- was a big library.\nAnd there were sports clubs, and we always were trying to participate in the sport events. The\ncommunity, however, was divided. There were people who belonged to a very radical Zionist\nmovement, the Zhabotinsky movement. And there were again [indecipherable] especially where\nsome of my friends belonged to a socialist Zionist movement. And in the middle there was the\nmean, mean Zionist. People who did not try to define themselves as -- as right wingers or left\nwingers. The Orthodox community was also divided. There were strictly Orthodox groups, and\nthen there were groups that did not only believe that prayer is the answer to our problems, but\nforming or creating, or returning to our ancient homeland is extremely important. My two sisters\nbelonged to that general Zionist organization, and I, as a young man, felt that perhaps the\nZortinsky movement, the movement that was teaching us to go and move to it -- to Israel and\nfight, I felt at that time that this is the only solution. In my town, I did not feel any anti-Semitism\nwhen I grew up, because there were not too many Gentiles in town, and there was no contact\nwhatsoever between the Jewish community and the Christian community. We lived separate --\nseparate lives, not mingling with each other. I remember my teachers were -- who I liked very,\nvery much, they really cared. I remember my uncles, merchants and [indecipherable], aunts that -\n- more pious than their husbands. School friends who were bookworms, and others who really\ndidn\u2019t care. But the discussions among all those groups were very heated. We really believed in\nour cause, and tried to convince those others to join us. We did not have any luck. They were\nalso convinced in their just cause. There was a communist movement in town. Their aim was to\nmove to Soviet Union, create a state there. I remember the name of the state that they were trying\nto -- to establish, they call it Biro Blam. Someplace in Siberia. I did not meet any of them after\nthe war, and I don\u2019t believe that some of them survived in the Soviet Union.",
        "Q: Can you tell me some more about --",
        "A: About what?",
        "Q: About the group that you were involved in --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- that -- can you say the name again?",
        "A: It was a revisionist organization formed by a leader, his name was Zeev Zhabotinsky.",
        "Q: And to become a member of that did you have to petition in any way, I mean --",
        "A: No, no, no, no. We did not have to do anything, you have to join them. [indecipherable]\norganization, and most of the people, please understand, were my age. Older people did not\nbelong to those organizations, to those radical organizations. Most of them were part of the\ngeneral Zionist movement.",
        "Q: What did it mean to be a member, and how -- how did you get together?",
        "A: We were getting together sometimes in the evenings, but mostly Saturdays afternoon,\ndiscussing events in the Jewish world, expressing our opinion, and participating in all events that\nwere taking place in our town, whenever somebody came to our town to speak to us. Those were\nreally wonderful years, really wonderful years. My two sisters did belong to the general Zionist\norganization. And I\u2019m not sure that I remember, but it seems to me that m-mostly -- my\norganization, there were mostly men. I don\u2019t remember any women in my organization. But in\nthe general Zionist organization, there were a lot of women.",
        "Q: Can you tell us the names of your sisters? I don\u2019t believe you --",
        "A: My older sister\u2019s name was Esther. My younger sister\u2019s name was Rushka.",
        "Q: And at this point when you were in this youth group, or this group, now how old are you?",
        "A: At that time I must have been 14. Around 14.",
        "Q: Did your parents have opinions about the group?",
        "A: No, my parents belonged to the general Zionist organization. This is perhaps one of the\nreasons that my sis -- two sisters joined that organization. They felt more comfortable. It may be\nalso that most of their friends belonged to that same organization.",
        "Q: Did anyone in the family have a strong reaction to the fact that you were 1n a separate group?\nWhat -- what, for instance, did your father or your mother say about that?",
        "A: My father and my mother were very tolerant people, and they felt that if this 1s what I would\nlike to do, this is the organization that I would like to belong to, they will not interfere. They will\nnot interfere, as long as it is a Zionist organization. Did my uncles, who were very pious people\nobject to it? I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. They actually also belong to -- to radical Zionist\norganizations.",
        "Q: What were the goals of the group that you were part of?",
        "A: The goal was, first of all, as long as we cannot move to Israel, to develop a strong sense of\nJewish identity, reinforcing the feelings that we had in school, reinforcing it in such a way that --\nthat we were more free to discuss things. And I don\u2019t [indecipherable] discussing events and\nproblems that are taking place not only in Poland, but all over the world. We used to get\nnewspapers, discuss articles, have -- have opinions. And all of 1t was very exciting. We were\nlooking forward to those meetings, sometimes in the evening, but most of the time on Saturdays\nafternoon.",
        "Q: How did -- how do you make sense of a kind of -- th-the fact that you went your separate way\nfrom the family, and that you were very passionate? How do you explain that?",
        "A: I was young, and I was concerned with the rest of -- the rest of -- with the members of\n[indecipherable] who felt that -- especially the older [indecipherable] that felt that we should not\nhasten the arrival of the Messiah, that we have no right to do things like this. I was resentful of it.\nAnd I strongly believed that only power will force the English people to let us come in. Only our\ndetermination and our willingness to fight and not wait for the goodwill of the English\ngovernment, is the only solution.",
        "Q: Did you imagine yourself perhaps, getting smuggled in there and becoming a -- a military --",
        "A: Ye -- yes, yes. I know that some of my friends who still live in Israel came in 1936 or 1937 as\nillegal immigrants, being brought into Israel in a very clandestine way. I\u2019m asking myself why\ndidn\u2019t I go. It\u2019s a very painful question. Perhaps even though I felt that this is the only way, and\nto feel that way, you have to have courage. Could be that I did not have the courage to go along\nwith, being 17 or 18 years old and start a life on my own. My family was a very close family,\nand I never developed a feeling that I can be alone. And that prevented me from making that\nfateful decision. In hindsight of course, I would have been much better off, and perhaps that\nbothers me, and perhaps convince my two sisters after I will be there, that they should do the\nsame thing. It bothers me. On the other hand I have doubts that my sisters would leave our\nparents alone. They were not young any more, and I am not sure that they would have accept this\nidea of going to Israel, and abandoning -- I\u2019m using that word because this is the way they felt\nprobably, abandoning our parents. My two sisters, if we can go to a different topic, joined me in\nKrakow when I went to the university in 19 - nine -- 1936. In 1937 they joined me. I was\ntransferring to the business academy. I went to the university only to be able to get into medical\nschool. But the quota was very low and I didn't make it. I transferred to the business academy\nand my si -- two sisters came to Krakow to study. But at the same time, I\u2019m not proud of myself,\nI\u2019m proud of my youngest sister. We made a deal, all three of us, that every Friday one of us\nwould go and spend the -- the weekend of the Shabbat with our parents. My youngest sister\nnever failed to go. I had sometimes a -- an event that I wanted to attend in Krakow, sports event\nor cultural event. On Friday morning I was turning to my youngest sister and tell Rushka, I am\nnot going. It is my turn but I am not going, you better go. And she always went there. She never\nleft my parents alone.",
        "Q: Talk a little bit about what -- ca -- what a regular day was like in your home, I guess this 1s\nbefore you went to the university, but when you were growing up. What your mother did during\nthe day, a little bit about your father.",
        "A: My father was a merchant. My moth -- mother was a housewife, like in every Jewish family\nat that time, maybe even every Christian family. We had our store and building that my father\nbuilt in 1929. We lived on the first floor and there were three floors above us. Was a very, very\ncapable man, even though he grew up without his parents. He was a self taught individual who\ncared very much about the family. I was very close to him. My father, even though he had very\nlittle schooling, became in that city of 31,000 Jews, the vice president of [indecipherable] you\ncan call it today the federation, or whatever you want to. That was very unusual because every\ntwo years were elections. This was not an appointed position, you had to win the election to -- to\n-- to be part of it. He won every election as long as -- as much as I remember. He had a very\nwonderful way of dealing with people, and my father became the [indecipherable] a\nrepresentative of a big, big manufacturing firm in Lodz, and if people that are buying anything\nthat were produced by that -- that manufacturing outfit, they had to come to us. And I also\nremember the recession. My father just finished building the house and all of a sudden it became\nvery, very difficult to accept the fact that people are not paying their bills. And please understand\nthat in most of the businesses, people were buying and mi -- and signing a note. And my father\n[indecipherable] those notes in the bank, all of a sudden he confronted the fact that they\u2019re not\npaying their notes, and he has to -- he has to redeem those notes. It was a very difficult time\nbecause he locked himself in one of the rooms, and did not want to listen to anybody. But as I\ntold you, my father grew up as an orphan, and he had the -- he had three brothers and two sisters.\nThe older brother raised the family, and was a very wise man but lived in a different city, about\n15 or 20 kilometers from u -- from Bendezin. And he came and stayed with my father for a long\ntime and convince him that not everything is lost, and you should get in touch with this -- with\nthat manufacturer in Lodz and see if they will help him. And that what happened. They came and\nthey bailed out my father, who later on, of course, became again a very, very successful\nbusinessman. And those were times that were really threatening. We -- we felt that perhaps we\nhave to -- we have to leave school, and that was to me, to my sisters, unacceptable. But thank\nGod for my uncle, and that -- that manufacturing company in -- in ro -- in -- in Lodz that saved\nus and our family.",
        "Q: Do you remember the --\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Just a -- a couple details. Do you remember the name of that manufacturing company?",
        "A: Yes, Karl Eisert, E-1-s-e-r-t.",
        "Q: Was it a -- a Polish, or German --",
        "A: No, those are Germans [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And the name of your uncle, the uncle that helped your father, the older uncle?",
        "A: Liam. We called him Libish.",
        "Q: Liam Stroch.",
        "A: Strochlitz.",
        "Q: And can you tell us a little bit about your mother? H-How your mother would spend an\nordinary day.",
        "A: Very good question. We had in the city two old age homes. The people couldn\u2019t afford to stay\nhome, they came and lived in those two age -- two old age homes, supported by the community.\nWe had also a very beautiful home for orphans, there were a lot of orphans. My mother spent\nmost of her time volunteering in those old age homes, and in the orphan home. And she derived a\nlot of satisfaction from that. On top of it, from time to time I used to see her in the store, helping\nmy father. And -- I was thinking of cooking, but it is not correct because we had a maid that was\nwith us for many, many years. And she -- my two sisters and I, when we\u2019re youngsters, were\nmore afraid of her than of my mother. She was a strict disciplinarian. We were afraid but we\nliked her very much because we probably realized that she is trying to do her best to -- to make\nus avoid getting in trouble. She was a Polish woman, and came during the war asking my parents\nto move. I as -- I tried many, many times to remember why my parents rejected the idea. I wish\nthey would have accepted the idea. But there must have been some reason why they rejected the\nidea. After the war, I met a neighbor of ours who survived in hiding, the age of my parents. They\ntold me, they were convinced that on the same street, my parents are hiding with that lady that\nworked for us. But it is a mystery to me why they rejected to go into hiding. And sometimes I\nfeel -- I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m justified feeling that way, that they did not want to leave us alone, we\nwere youngsters still. And sometimes I do believe, especially my father, who could not -- who\ncould not perceive that people are going to be killed. He somehow looked at the German nation\nwith admiration for their accomplishments, and he couldn\u2019t visualize, probably -- and I am\nguessing just -- that those people who he is holding in high esteem, who gave us Beethoven and\nBach and Dieter and Schiller and Mendelssohn, are capable of committing such crimes, such\nheinous crimes. And he felt the war will end and on the [indecipherable] but I\u2019m guessing, just.\nBut he -- if he will go into hiding and we be discovered, he\u2019Il be shot. Am I sure about it? No,\nI\u2019m not. But I was thinking many times about it, and those thoughts crossed my mind. I wish\nthey would have listened to her. She was a wonderful woman, but it\u2019s water over the dam. It\nhappened, and --",
        "Q: Do you remember her name?",
        "A: Yes. Antosia, A-n-t-0-s-1-a.",
        "Q: And she was also from Bendezin? Where was she from?",
        "A: From the same town, or a neighboring town [indecipherable] I\u2019m not sure any more.",
        "Q: What language was spoken at home?",
        "A: We -- I mean, my sisters and I were communicating in Polish. But my father was a Yiddishist,\nand there was a newspaper in Warsaw by the name of Hient, on a very, very high level. I always\ncompare it with the New York Times today. And we were getting that paper every day, a\nYiddish paper, and if during the luncheon my two sisters and I did not know what a very famous\njournalist was writing today in the paper -- his name was Margoshis, my father used to be very,\nvery upset with us. And he enjoyed having those discussions in that -- at the table in the Yiddish\nlanguage. There is [indecipherable] something that I will never forget. My youngest sister, before\ngoing in the room for lunch was telling around to me always, Sigmund, did you read Margoshis\u2019\ncolumn today? You told me what it was. Sorry.",
        "Q: When do you remember becoming aware of a change in your life, o-of being apprehensive in\nany way about the future? That possibly something was going to change? Or would -- perhaps\nhearing about Hitler, or Nazism?",
        "A: Yes. We were glued to the radios, listening to his speeches, and we were frightened. But at\nthe same time I do remember that there was a feeling among a lot of people that he is talking\nabout it only in order to gain power, and to exercise power. But perhaps it\u2019s empty talk. And still\nwe were frightened. Now of course, on the first of September 1939, when they came to town, we\nimmediately realized that it is not just talk. There were two events the first two days of -- after\nthey came to town that I will never forget. One were a family by the name of Schlesinger, father\nand two sons, running to the synagogue to rescue the Torah scrolls -- from the burning\nsynagogue, the Germans put fire on -- on it -- burned the synagogue. They were able to run in\nand bring out two Torahs. When they emerged from the burning synagogue, the Nazis shot them\non the spot. That was one event that of course frightened us. The second, han -- in hindsight, it\nwas a policy probably, to frighten the people. On the second or third, or fourth day, and I don\u2019t\nremember any more, they came to -- to -- they entered homes and took out some leaders. And I\ndon\u2019t remember -- remember today how many, but must have been at least five or six, and\nhanged them in the middle of the market. For nothing. For the fact that they were Jewish. That\nfrightened us quite a bit, quite a bit. The people were really naive in \u201939. They lived during the\nfirst World War, and they felt it\u2019s going to be a static war. And what my parents did is to move\npart of the business to a town by the name of Jarolsitsa around 30 or 40 kilometers from my\ntown, believing that the war will not -- that the Germans will not come as far, and they will\nsurvive and return. Of course, it turned out to be an illusion, and my sisters and I were -- were in\nthe -- together with my parents in that town, that all of a sudden you realize that the ger --\nGermans are moving very fast. And the young people were trying to hitchhike and go east after\nlearning that the Soviet Union have entered the war, and occupying east of Poland. We strongly\nbelieved that we can survive there. I was one of them, and my sisters did not join me. Again, I\nwas thinking why, why did it happen. And then I remember -- I -- I remembered that -- that in all\nthose seven or eight or nine days that it took me to hitchhike to eastern Poland to the city of\nLvov, I don\u2019t remember seeing on the roads -- the roads were crowded -- too many young ladies,\ntoo many young women walking and trying to hitchhike and -- to the eastern part of Poland.\nWhy? I don\u2019t have really a good answer. I don\u2019t know why, but those were the facts.",
        "Q: Can we just go back to the first day that the Germans arrive in your town. If you can\nremember where you were, h-how you knew they were there. W-What it looked like, even\nsmelled like?",
        "A: How it looked like?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. When they arrived.",
        "A: We were at the windows. They came in in tanks, just shooting around indiscriminately. We\nare afraid to leave the home -- our houses. And then, I remember the ger -- Germans breaking\ninto stores, taking whatever they wanted as though it\u2019s -- it\u2019s theirs. Breaking into homes, and\ntaking paintings or whatever they found, and cutting it away. Of course, that was really\nfrightening, our age, to understand that people can come -- just come in and take away something\nthat my father worked all his life, without any -- any consideration about anything. Was perhaps\na moment when we felt that life will not be the same any more, that life has changed. I also\nremember that when they ever -- when they saw a Jew on the streets with a beard, they were\ncutting it off, and laughing, and kicking people. I don\u2019t remember all those -- all the time that\nthey occupied Bendezin [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t remember to confront or being confronted by a\nGerman who showed sympathy for us, or gave us a piece of bread, even though my wife\nremembers that there was a German in Krakow who helped her. But I don\u2019t remember. All my\nanger at the German people blocks my -- my willingness to accept there could have been a good\nGerman. Of course I changed my mind lately. But that could have been behind me not\nremembering that there were at least one German who tried to show sympathy or tried to help.",
        "Q: What did you do in those days, did your -- did your father sort of give you orders to stay in\nthe house, or were you trying to have contact with your youth group?",
        "A: Oh no, we did not have any comfort of the youth group any more, everything was -- came to a\nstandstill. In the first few days I stayed home, but I went with my parents to the city of Jarolsitsa,\nwhere as I told you before I was hitchhiking to the -- to eastern -- to eastern Poland. But after\nbeing in Lvov, and I don\u2019t remember, three or four months, my father sent a mi -- a mis -- an\nemissary to tell me that I should return home, that things have calmed down and life is almost\nnormal. My faith in the wisdom of my father was absolutely boundless. I went back. I had a\ndifficult trip. I was on the floor -- 1-1n the city of [indecipherable] that were only about 10 miles\nfrom my town, on the floor of the railroad station. They run -- came running in, trying to find\nJews and drag them out. I was on -- I was somehow lying between two or three Gentiles and they\nmissed me. Within the next day or two days later, I came to town. As I told you, my father was a\n-- was the vice-president of [indecipherable] and he were very close to a -- to young people that\nwere in town form -- they formed a kibbutz that they were together trying to emigrate to Israel,\nwaiting for certificates to Israel. And they were -- they were involved in -- in -- in producing -- in\n-- in -- in planting, I\u2019m sorry, not producing, planting food, potatoes and tomatoes. And that was\nvery important and my father, on behalf of the Judenrat, this is the way they called that\nfederation that I mentioned before, was supervising that kibbutz. I was -- my father brought me\nin and I stayed for awhile, also helping. And then something very unusual happened. I got hold\nof a book with certain laws that the German observe, and I notice that there is a law saying that\npeople who work in defense industries -- and we had three enterprises working for German\ndefense industry in town, they\u2019re entitled to additional meat. They call them sverarbeiter, people\nwho work hard. I took advantage of the law. I went to the authorities and I was successful to\nconvince them that those people over there are entitled to more meat. And I used to get every\nweek meat designated for them. There was a sausage factory in town [indecipherable] in the\nnearer -- neighbor town -- neighboring town, Sosnowiec, where we worked hard and produced\nsausages. Of course it was much easier to distribute sausages and to cut meat for [indecipherable]\nand this is where I worked from 1940 or \u201941, until deportation of the -- in sep -- August of 1939 -\n- 1943.",
        "Q: I just want to go over a few details, just -- just to k-kind of clarify a few things. So within a\nfew days, your parents packed up a few things and moved to a neighboring town, correct?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: The name of the town?",
        "A: Jarolsitsa",
        "Q: The day after that, it was agreed upon that you would go to Lvov.",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure it was a day after or three, four days after.",
        "Q: Just tell us if you can, just briefly, a little bit about what you did in Lvov. You were there for\nthree or four months, what -- what was it like at that point? Was it a refuge center?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I was able to find a family. They were butchers, and they said to me, alright, we will give you\na place to sleep. So basically what I needed is to earn enough money to buy food. The soldiers,\nthe Russian soldiers were absolutely obsessed with getting a watch, getting watches. This was\ntheir mean -- mean d-desire, to get watches. I used to go out and try to find out who wants to sell\na watch and sell it to them and buy food. This is the way I lived for the -- for those three or four\nmonths.",
        "Q: Were you comfortable there with the Russian soldiers versus the German soldiers?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I was much more comfortable until all of a sudden the Russians were transporting\nmy friends to Siberia. And -- and that bothered me. I thought they might be able to come and\npick me up, too. And as I said to you before, when my father sent somebody to convince me to\ngo back, and I said to you that I had boundless faith in the wisdom of my father, sitting here just\nnow, I also believe that I was afraid, especially that I came from a family that was a wealthy\nfamily, that I would end up in Siberia. It was hard to realizing what to expect home.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: I wanted to think back, when you returned from your three to four months in Lvov, what did\nyour hometown look like? Had it changed in any way?",
        "A: As a matter of fact it did not. Life all of a sudden became semi-normal. The Germans putting\nmen, they called them the [indecipherable] who was now [indecipherable] together with my\nfather. Not giving anything to us, not -- being guided by my father. And we -- life became semi-\nnormal. We were walking the streets. I am not sure that I remember if our youth group met. I had\ndoubts about -- I have doubts about it. But people worked, as I told you in those defense\nfactories, and the illusion that we will survive the war became much stronger. That was 1940 -\n\"41. And furthermore, young people were -- were taken away by the Germans to Germany to\nwork there. And here the -- the image of the man who was in charge of all those communities, all\nthose Jewish communities, a man by the name of Merin, M-e-r-i-n -- perhaps was a visionary.\nPerhaps in this -- that feeling came to me only after the war, because during war I was very\nunhappy with the fact that he is cooperating with the Germans. But he understood that people\nwho work are being sent to Germany to help in their defense industry, may have a much better\nchance than others. Even though I remember discussions in our groups at that time, quoting a\nvery fa -- very, very famous saying of the philo -- Jewish philosopher Maimonides, that if the\nenemy comes, and he is asking to hand him o -- hand them over one person that they are going to\nkill, the community should never accept it. Yes, we should all -- all of us should go. But Merin\nfelt -- felt differently. He felt on the contrary that this cooperation with the Germans and imbu --\nimbued young people -- not imbued them, but forcing young people to -- to accept the fact that\nthey are going to be deported, and they are going to be working in Germany, was perhaps a very\ngood idea. Most of them, most of them survived the war. [indecipherable] the war, we young\npeople couldn\u2019t accept his decisions of cooperation with the enemy. On the other hand, again in\nhindsight, they had -- if he would not have, the Germans would have taken over everything and\nmassacred us, like they did later on when they invaded the Soviet Union in June of 1942. They\ncame to towns and just took out people and killed them, massacred. And maybe we avoided that\nfate. Maybe. But of course, that he will found that he has a good relationship with the Gestapo,\nand he can do many things. But again, misleading people. He couldn\u2019t -- yes, he could get\nsomebody out of a transport to Germany, but he was really fulfilling their wishes. If he had not\nhave done it, would there be other people in town who would have taken over the function?\nPerhaps. I don\u2019t condemn him any more like I used to during the war, and immediately after the\nend of the war. He fulfilled a certain function in the life of the Jewish people in Bendezin,\nSosnowiec and [indecipherable]",
        "Q: You -- you\u2019re talking about Moshe Merin?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. Wa -- was he 1n your town before the Germans came, or -- how was he a part of your\ntown before that time?",
        "A: He was not a very highly respected person before the war. I don\u2019t remember anything about\nhis family, but I know that he was not among the people who gained the respect of others. How\nhe emerged as a leader in 1939 is to me a mystery. Maybe there are others who lived closer to\nhim. Maybe they know the answers. I am unable to remember and tell you why he emerged as a\nleader of the Jewish [indecipherable]. He was not elected, of course, there were no elections.\nSomething must have happened that the Germans either agreed or appointed him to be the head\nof the Jewish [indecipherable]. Not only the Jewish community in his town, Sosnowiec, it was\nthis -- it had a -- probably the same [indecipherable] we had probably between 30 or 31,000 Jews\nand next town [indecipherable] other small surrounding towns. He became the leader. Why? I\nhave no answer.",
        "Q: Can you talk -- we\u2019re talking a little bit about their being discussion within the community\nand some people felt that Moshe Merin was -- was collaborating, cooperating with the enemy.\nWhat did people who disagreed with what he was doing, what did they think should be done?\nAnd then of course, what did you think? You disapproved at that time of him. What did you\nthink he should be doing?",
        "A: What he should be doing?",
        "Q: Well, you spoke about disagreeing with the fact that he cooperated in some ways.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: In many ways, with the Germans.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What -- what did you think he should have done instead?",
        "A: He couldn\u2019t do anything instead. I suppose that, as I said before, they would have found\nanother man, another substitution to making [indecipherable] and cooperate with them. You\nknow, I used an expression that I learned someplace, that Moshe Merin and we are confronted\nwith choiceless choices. There was no way to -- to change anything. We had no choices. And\nagain, I do believe that -- that his -- his cooperation saved a certain number of Jewish people who\nwere sent to Germany and survived. There is nothing, no justification for cooperating with the\nGermans, and preparing lists of people that are going to be taken to Auschwitz. No. No, it is not.\nBut he may have thought, as I said before, that we are going to be exposed to massacres, that\nnobody will survive. Those are feelings that I had after the war, not during the war. There were\nother leaders in Poland that took upon themselves to cooperate and save. Perhaps under the\nillusion that time is -- will be on our side, if we will drag it out, the war will come to an end. Of\ncourse, that was an e -- just an illusion. That\u2019s illusion, and before the war, when we listened to\nHitler, I thought it\u2019s just talk. It was not just talk. He meant tt.",
        "Q: Did you ever meet Moshe Merin or hear him speak?",
        "A: Yes. When you say meet, I hope you\u2019re not implying that I was sitting down with him and\nhaving a discussion, no. But I met him, perhaps several times, when he came to town and was\nspeaking and again everything -- people to follow him and to leave and be -- to accept the fact\nthat they\u2019re going to be shipped to Germany, and convincing -- trying to convince people that\nthat is -- that they will survive, they will have -- they will work under completely different\nconditions, that they -- they will not die out of hunger or disease. But I was never involved in any\n-- in any conversations with him.",
        "Q: When he spoke at a public rally like that, saying those kinds of things, what were people\nsaying in the crowd? Did you every overhear anything?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: What were they thinking?",
        "A: Not that I remember. Not -- I assume that there were those who believed him, and those who\nhad doubts about what he is saying. But this is natural, it is normal. If a majority believed him, or\na minority believed him, who knows? Who knows? But again, as I said before, it turned out that\nmost of them survived.",
        "Q: Can you describe life at this point in the town? Tell us a little bit more about how your\nfather\u2019s shop is run. You mentioned a German being there to help him.",
        "A: Not to help him, he -- h-he -- he -- he was there to help them.",
        "Q: Your father was there to help the Germans?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What -- what was the atmosphere in the shop like, and again what was daily life like? Was\nthere enough food? [inaudible]",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe that I -- I thought that I was ever hungry. How did we get food? Yes, there\nwere some stores open and -- and I do remember that Poles, they come to town and send food.\nWhen I say that my father was there to help them, even though -- even though he was not paid,\nbut I do remember that permit -- perhaps with their permission or with none -- no -- not -- not get\n-- getting their permission, he used to take out from the store certain things from the store and\nsell them. And that was a blessing, cause we could buy food.",
        "Q: And when the Germans came to town were there any new laws they passed, that insisted that\nyou give them personal items?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you know if you were present for any of that?",
        "A: If what?",
        "Q: If -- if -- 1f you experienced any of that.",
        "A: Well, they came to town, and after a few weeks everyone had to wear that yellow band and\nthe sign Juden here. Of course this was already demeaning, and something [indecipherable] and\nsuch a state of mind, you are losing your faith, yeah. Your world is sudden start to feel that you\nare something that is -- has to live on a much lower level. And, as I told you, we are in school --\nthere\u2019s a school, we -- we were very proud of be-belonging to the Jewish people. When they\ncame, immediately brought us down completely, taking away our confidence. And perhaps\n[indecipherable] they -- they took away a -- our faith and resistance, even though in my town\nthere was a group of young people who somehow were able to secure a gun or two guns. They\nkilled a German in the street. Of course, they later, the Germans came in and of course they took\nmost of the young people and killed them. I\u2019m not sure most, but a certain number of people that\nthey killed on the spot. That what I remember.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve mentioned two situations now of being -- sounded like they were asking people to go\nto Germany, and then in this case rounding up people after the resistance attack. How did you\nescape those two situations?",
        "A: First of all, I hope you don\u2019t mind if I will correct something in your statement.",
        "Q: Not at all.",
        "A: Not asking people to go to Germany, deporting people to go to Germany. I hope you don\u2019t\nmind --",
        "Q: Not at all.",
        "A: -- but I -- I am correcting that.",
        "Q: Well, let me clarify. So at that point when Moshe Merin, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not a sign up, he\u2019s not --\nhe\u2019s just justifying. He\u2019s not telling people that they should volunteer to go to Germany.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No, he was the per --",
        "Q: He\u2019s justifying a certain deportation.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: And preparing the lists of people that should be deported.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: What was your question?",
        "Q: I-I wanted to know in those two situations, how were you able to avoid, in the first one being\nchosen, in the second being rounded up perhaps if I\u2019m -- if I\u2019m imagining it --",
        "A: Yes, yeah, I avoided it because of the influence of my father, and the fact that I was working\non that kibbutz and being protected that way, being healed that way. That was [indecipherable]\nthat I was not deported.",
        "Q: Will you tell us a little bit about the influence of your father at that point in the town?",
        "A: Oh, his influence was diminished to a great extent, but he knew the members, all the members\nof the Judenrat, and he was kept in very high respect, perhaps he avoided, or he was able to -- to\nconvince them not to put me on the list, that somebody else go in -- in my place. I\u2019m sure\nsomebody else went and took my place. Did I think of it at that time? No. But after the war, you\nknow, you are going back, you are trying to determine in your own mind what happened. And I\ncame to the conclusion that somebody else was deported in my place. It\u2019s not a very comfortable\nfeeling, but again, that expression that I used, choiceless choices, comes to my mind.",
        "Q: At this point -- at this point, is your father -- you\u2019re a young man, 1s your father talking to you\nin any way about the future or choices that may have to be made? Perhaps even a strategy of how\nto deal with danger, I guess is the best word for it. At this point people are being deported,\npeople are being rounded up, they\u2019re being shot in the street. Are you and your father having any\ndiscussions about what may come for you [indecipherable]",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember any specific discussions, but a lot of people in town were building hiding\nplaces in the basements that were really difficult to discover. And by -- and my father, of course,\nbuilt such a place in our home. No, he build that place of hiding only after they brought us into\nthe ghetto. In our home he did not, but after they brought us into the ghetto, he build a place of\nhiding. And that was perhaps the best indication how bad the situation is.",
        "Q: Can you describe where the place was, or how it was hidden?",
        "A: The place -- yeah, the place was in our basement, and the entrance for the -- to the -- to the\nhiding place was -- was -- was done in a way to disguise it, how? By putting a -- putting a big\ncredenza, or whatever you call it at that time to hide the entrance. And there were no signs, if I\nremember correctly that there is a [indecipherable] even if you moved out the -- the -- the\nfurniture that was there. At the same time, the Germans learned, especially in homes of more\nimportant people that they build hiding places in there, and they found most of them, or all of\nthem. It was again only another illusion. But you have to live with illusions in times like this.\nLife becomes unbearable if you don\u2019t have any illusions. We lost faith, we lost confidence, but if\nyou lose illusions too, then -- then you are hopelessly paralyzed.",
        "Q: What do you mean when you say you lost faith?",
        "A: We lost faith in ourselves after they put those yellow bands and wearing that sign Juden. It\nwas difficult for us to understand. If you are referring to faith as faith in God, I am not sure at\nthat point that we lost faith in God. We lost faith in man, but I am not sure that we lost faith in\nGod, but we lost faith after arriving in Auschwitz, completely in God, seeing what is happening.\nAnd there\u2019s a very interesting change of minds among people who arrived in Auschwitz and\nwere my friends or acquaintances. Maybe after the war I understood it. People who were in my\ntown who I knew were very pious people, very pious people. [indecipherable] starting to\nchallenge God, mocking. Maybe mocking 1s a too strong word. And on the contrary, my friends\nwho are atheists in town, who belonged as I told you before to that left wing organization and\ncommunists -- I\u2019m not sure about communist, but who belo -- belonged to the left wing\norganizations, and were atheists, all of a sudden became belie -- they became believers. Why?\nAnd again, after analyzing it, I have one answer. Here I have an answer. I think that the atheists\nbecame more believing, blaming themselves for creating that situation and forcing the wrath of\nGod. And the other group, the religious group couldn\u2019t understand that God is not interfering.\nThey learned in Jewish history that God interfered in many instances in Egypt or -- or Persia,\nwhatever. Why is He all of a sudden becoming invisible. Why is he not interfering? Seeing small\nchildren that are innocent being thrown into the fire. If I am innocent -- if I am guilty, fine. But\nhow can you permit small children being th-thrown into the fire? But again, a change happened\nin me too, later on. I realized that without faith in God, or faith in a human -- in entity that 1s --\nthat is managing the world, it\u2019s very difficult for this, very difficult for this.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: At some point in all of this, you -- you get married.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you tell us about that?",
        "A: When I came back to town, I -- perhaps several months later, either it was the second part of\n1940, I got married. I got married to somebody who was in my class in school, and with whom I\nwas very close all those years. We were what you call today sweethearts. And even though we\naccepted that we should not bring -- and we should not bring people -- well, you should not raise\na family, that -- perhaps that was the expression, to have children, we wanted to get married.",
        "Q: Why did you -- why did you think that you should not raise a family?",
        "A: Because I thought at that point that perhaps there\u2019s an uncertain future, and perhaps also it --\nit will be easier to survive without having to shield or protect small kids. And we were young, we\nthought the war would end, and we can have children at that time. We felt it\u2019s irresponsible for\npeople getting married to ha -- to try to build a family, build a family into a very uncertain future\nand having to protect those children, that is no way for us really to protect. And it is a mistake, a\nbig mistake to raise a family.",

        "A: The ceremony took place at her home, only family were invited. Was it a happy ceremony? I\ndon\u2019t believe so. It was a ceremony with lack of enthusiasm, even though we were deeply in love\nwith each other, but how could you become happy in to the [indecipherable] times when you\nknew that things are going very, very badly, that who knows if you will survive. So why did we\nmarry? We married -- when you are 19 or 20, you are -- and you went out with your future wife\nfor six, seven years, a desire to get married -- the desire to get married is stronger than logic.\nMuch stronger than logic. Her parents were pushing, even though my parents were reluctant.\nAnd we got married. I don\u2019t have any regrets. I was in love with my future wife for many years. I\ndo believe that I made that -- at that time, the right decision even though my parents were not\nvery happy about it. And they participated in the wedding, together with my sisters, and never\nmentioned anything to anybody that they are uncom -- not that I know of, that they are\nuncomfortable with the marriage.

        "A: Yes, unfortunately that happens. There were some who were informing on neighbors, leading\nsome Germans to -- to homes where they could take more -- take -- take out valuable things. This\nis very -- was very regrettable. Do you have to be informer to survive? I don\u2019t believe so, but\nthere were informers, and not only there were informers, the Germans have insisted on having a\npolice force, a Jewish police force in town. And those police officers, whenever there was a day\nthat they were trying to round up people and deport them to Auschwitz or any other place, they\nwere -- that Jewish police force were working with the Germans. This I wish would have never\nhappened. And again, would it have led to a massacre? Could very well be, if they would not\nhave -- if the Jewish police would not have cooperated with them, that could very well be. But --\nbut perhaps, same thing, who am I to judge somebody who has -- who wants to save him and his\nfamily? Difficult, very difficult.",
        "Q: Did you have -- can you tell us when you first heard of the idea of the ghetto?",
        "A: It must have been at the end of \u201942 or the beginning of \u201943. That\u2019s -- again, we heard about\nthe ghettos much earlier, because they have -- the Germans established ghettos in different towns\nbefore they did it in my town. Why? Maybe because my town was incorporated into Germany,\nand the others were in Poland, were the -- where they could -- where there were no publicity.\nEven though there were no publicity, nobody really was trying to inform the western world at\nthat time what is happening. But the fact that we were incorporated into Germany must have\nbeen a factor, that we were living to the ghetto only at the end of \u201942, and perhaps even ni --\nperhaps -- perhaps not in 42, but in \u00b043. I don\u2019t remember the exact date.",
        "Q: So you remember the ghetto coming towards the end?",
        "A: \u00b043. Before we were deported to -- before the -- there was a complete liquidation of the ghetto\nthat took place on August 1943. There was no -- there was -- we knew that there are -- that there\nare qu -- establishing ghettos in different towns, and perhaps that one day it would happened in\nour town too, and it happened. But again, I remember people who were -- who were terribly\ndisposed to Merin, saying that he is avoiding it, that he 1s trying to avoid, the he is trying to\nconvince them not to -- not to deport us into a ghetto. Did he have so much power? I doubt it\nvery, very much. I doubt it very, very much. But people -- some people believed in his good\nrelationship with the Gestapo and that we can avoid it. But the decisions were not of local\nGestapo people or even district Gestapo people. Decisions were made in Berlin. They get -- they\ngot the -- got the letter, or whatever. Building has to be a ghetto by the first of June or whatever\nit is. And they were just fulfilling the wishes of the main authorities in Berlin. So I have doubt\nthat he could influence local authorities to postpone it. They would have been probably put into\njail or killed, you know, there was no ob -- not obeying. Not obeying a decision made in Berlin\nwould have cost them their lives. So I have great doubts that Merin was able to postpone our\nbeing deported into the ghettos.",
        "Q: Can you describe what it wa -- what actually happened when you went to the ghetto? I mean,\nhow much warning were you given, did you just walk out of your house and leave most\neverything there, your parents --",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: -- did you try to find your parents that day?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember, but must have been -- has -- had one or two days warnings that we\nhave to go into the ghettos, and again that Judenrat assigned different apartments. It\u2019s extremely\ncrowded. We got, I believe, two rooms for the entire family.",
        "Q: So this --",
        "A: But on the other hand, and again it\u2019s hindsight -- not hindsight, but thinking about it later on,\nwe may have felt that at that time, \u201942, or the beginning of \u00b043, that this is the way we will\nsurvive. If they are creating or building ghettos, they are not going to take us to annihilation\ncamps. And that was a comforting -- comforting th-thought. But again, an 1l-illusion.",
        "Q: So you had heard of annihilation camps at -- you remember hearing about them before you\nactually went -- went to Auschwitz?",
        "A: I would say that in \u201943, we knew, much more than in \u201942. We knew from emissaries who\ncame to us, warning us that -- that there\u2019s an Auschwitz, and there\u2019s a Birkenau, and there\u2019s a\nTreblinka and they are sent -- shipping those all -- deporting those people those camps, and the\nolder people, and the kids and children and women are being immediately sent to the gas\nchambers. But there was one -- one event. One of the people who were in the train to Auschwitz\nfrom my town, were able before the train stopped in Birkenau to jump out of the train and made\nit back to town. And he came back and he was telling everybody that -- what happened, and that\nwe are going to be all of us shipped to Birkenau and that we will not survive. That was a warning\nthat came very late, must have been \u201943, maybe June or July of \u201943. But what could we have\ndone? We were dealing -- or living in a country with a population who are very hostile to us.\nWhen I say the population, I am referring perhaps to about, I don\u2019t know, I will guess 85 - 90\npercent of the people very hostile to us. They were taking some money, promising to -- to sell\nout -- bring out guns, never happened. They were denouncing us, pointing out to Germans if they\nsaw somebody who looked like Jewish and was trying to -- to go to -- to another town without\nthat yellow band. They -- they had a way of recognizing Jews, and denouncing them. So what\ncould we have done in June, July of 1943? Very little Very, very little.",

        "Q: Describe the room -- the rooms that you had.",
        "A: They were in a part of town they call it kamyonka. Very poor people lived there, very poor\npeople, so you can imagine the rooms. I do believe that we had a toilet. I do believe that we had\nto go outside. But as I said before, and that -- I am reinforcing it now in my own mind. It could\nvery well be that we thought at that time that being in the ghetto will shield us of being -- being\ndeported to a death camp.",
        "Q: How were the sleeping arrangements? I mean, were -- did your mother and father have one\nroom, or were you in --",
        "A: No, I think -- I am not sure that I remember, but somehow we managed to sleep on the floor,\nwhatever. We managed. We did not let our parents sleep on the floor, but we were probably\nlying down on the floor, and I can\u2019t imagine beds for so many people in those small rooms.",
        "Q: What happened to your house? Your house, your parent\u2019s house?",
        "A: Yeah, the German took it over, it was a very nice house. The Germans took it over. There was\none Polish family living in that town, he was a doctor, his name was Bialy, B-1-a -- B-1-a-l-y,\nwith whom I was close. I used to spend some evenings in the 40\u2019s in his apartment discussing --\ndiscussing events. Was he also removed from that -- from my father\u2019s -- or from our ho -- house,\nI don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t remember. I only remember that my father gave him -- we had some\npaintings. I\u2019m not sure how valuable those paintings were, there were no -- not Picassos. But he\ngave him some paintings in order to -- in order to preserve them and give it -- give them back to\nus after the war.",
        "Q: Was there anything else that your family did take with them into the ghetto? What else did\nyour father take?",
        "A: Yes, I am -- yes, we took certain things -- will I be able today to describe them, no, absolutely\nnot. Of course we took certain things with us. Yes, I do remember that we were wheeling\nsomething, and everybody was. But what can you take, you know? You don\u2019t have anyth -- any\nbuses or -- or trucks to -- to transfer. You took something that was -- that you felt -- our parents\nfelt it would be absolutely necessary to have. Pretty sure it was things like this.",
        "Q: Were there any family items or religious artifacts that -- that were included in the things that\nyou took?",
        "A: I doubt that there were religious artifacts. The family, I am not sure any more. I am not sure.",
        "Q: And also, money, what -- what -- was there anyplace that you hid money, or hid money on --\nin your clothes, or jewelry --",
        "A: M-My father hid money in a garden. It was not far from our home. Yes, I am positive about it.\nBut after the war, a friend of mine who I told exactly where the money should be, went back to\nPoland, finally to dig -- dig the money out, didn\u2019t find anything. People knew probably that my\nfather 1s trying to hide certain things.",
        "Q: I-In -- what were you -- were you able to cele -- you know, honor the Sabbath 1-in the ghetto?\nHo --",
        "A: My father was not a religious person.",
        "Q: Really? Can you tell us a little bit about that, because --",
        "A: Yes, I will tell you, my f -- we celebrated Friday nights with our families. They were very\nhappy Friday nights. He observed most of the rituals, all the holidays. He observed very s -- very\nstrictly, with one of us. But he -- yes, during the holidays he was going to -- to the synagogue,\nbut every Saturday morning, my mother was taking me to my grandfather, who was waiting\nalready on the outside, and leading me to his synagogue. And I will never forget the moment, I'll\nnever -- I loved my grandfather, I loved him very dearly. And I will never forget those moments\nsitting with him and he putting his tallit over my head. I was so secure, must have been six or\nseven or eight years old. I was so secure sitting next to him with that tallit. You know, I saw him\nin the morning, this is very -- sometimes praying, almost by heart, and I said to myself, I'll never\nbe able to do that. But the best part was -- and he was -- he was praying the grace after meals.\nThere\u2019s one sentence that stuck into my mind when he was pronouncing loudly, I will say it in\nHebrew [speaks Hebrew here]. I was a young boy, and now I\u2019m an old man, but I have never\nseen a righteous man begging for bread. That was very reassuring. I di -- always waited for that\nsentence.",
        "Q: So then, in the ghetto, did you continue to celebrate Fridays?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We never gave that up. We were a singing family. I mean singing not professionally, but we\nall loved to sing, and he loved it and we were singing Friday night until late into the night. Even\nin the ghetto.",
        "Q: And was it --",
        "A: He was able to -- to separate his Friday nights from everything that happened during the\nweek. This is again an afterthought. I never thought of it at that time.",
        "Q: Were you able to separate the Friday night from the events [indecipherable]",
        "A: You ask the very good questions, I\u2019m not -- I don\u2019t -- I am not sure. I am not sure. I am not\nsure. Having said that, I have to tell you that I enjoyed very much those Friday nights. Was it the\nsinging? Perhaps. Was it the fact that we all are together? Perhaps. But I have fond memories of\nthose Friday nights.\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: I need you to think back to this time in the ghetto. How are people treating each other? Are\nthey acting as a community and trying to support each other? What were you able to observe?",
        "A: I think unfortunately, everybody was living for himself. Everybody was trying to survive 1n a\nsituation where survival was very doubtful. It was difficult in [indecipherable] to create a feeling\nof -- of having a common cause. Any one of us had the one aim, to survive. I am sure that people\ntoday, if they will read all the books and all the diaries will really be -- they will be unable to\nunderstand what indeed took place there. There\u2019s an impossibility. So, for me to say that there\nwas a sense of a community is wrong; there was no such thing. And you may ask the question\nwhy. I told you why. Everybody lived for himself. We have to understand this. You will not be\nable to really know exactly, or know what was life about in those dreadful times.",
        "Q: Who did you trust at that point?",
        "A: I trusted my father, and I later discovered that I could trust my instincts. I discovered in\nAuschwitz, and for certain reasons I did certain things without realizing why I am doing it, but\nby doing it I survived that moment. So yes, I -- I have trust in my instincts.",
        "Q: Some of the youth movements 1n your town were actively resisting. What -- what did you\nknow about that, and were you ever able to observe any of that activity?",
        "A: I was not part of it, so I could not observe it, but I believe I mentioned it before, there was a\ngrou -- small group of people who were able to secure a gun or two, and killed a -- a Nazi in\ntown. But that was all the extent of it -- there\u2019s -- that\u2019s all we have done, nothing else.\n[indecipherable] can you visualize those -- that -- that situation? You cannot. Impossible.\n[indecipherable] resistance was possible.",
        "Q: Did you know of any activity that went on on the -- the kibbutz?",
        "A: Yes. They were already determined to resist, those were young people determined to resist,\nand they were able to secure a few guns, and in August of 1943, they were shooting out from the\nkibbutz, and if they did some damage at all, nobody ever was able to discover. But they were --\nthey were defending themselves. All of them, of course, were killed on the spot there. But they\nwere trying to follow the example of the Warsaw ghetto uprising. They had some connections\nwith those people. And one woman in disguise was able to go to Warsaw and convince them to\ngive us also a couple du -- a couple gu-guns, even though they had not too much either, not too\nmany guns either. And they resisted. That -- that -- that I -- that I know.",
        "Q: Is this woman Frumka Plotnicka?",
        "A: Fr-Frumka.",
        "Q: Frumka Plotnicka.",
        "A: Yes, Frumka.",
        "Q: Was she from your town?",
        "A: No, she was from eastern Poland someplace.",
        "Q: Did you ever meet her?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was she like?",
        "A: Wonderful person, very idealistic. Very idealistic, very devoted to the Jewish people. And I\u2019m\ngoing to contradict myself here. I don\u2019t believe from talking to her that she ever lost faith. She\nstill believed in the cause and she still believed that somehow they will be able to, even during\nthe war, to smuggle themselves to Israel. Another illusion.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting, when you said that this woman was able to go to Warsaw and convince them\nto give us some guns, you put yourself in the group of resisters, in a sense.",
        "A: I shouldn\u2019t have.",
        "Q: Well, I think it\u2019s interesting because I -- I -- and I wonder if -- if you\u2019d want to explore it a\nlittle, that there was a part of you that felt that -- that you were part of that.",
        "A: Iam very little. They were hiding everything, not talking. Maybe when I use the word us, to\nbring guns for us, maybe I thought of them representing us. I was raised on the belief that we are\na very tight community. And by using the word us, I [indecipherable] to have some conscience,\nbut at the same time I felt probably that they are defending us, or they are work -- or they are\nfighting for our dignity or something like this.",
        "Q: Did you talk to them, did you admire them, or were you frightened to be seen with those\nyoung people?",
        "A: Whi-Which ones?",
        "Q: A-At the -- the kibbutz people.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: The young idealistic kibbutz --",
        "A: No, I was not frightened, I was not frightened. But young people who shot the German in\ntown were much younger. They were the generation of my youngest sister, very idealistic, very\nidealistic. And what did they think? What are you trying to accomplish? What did they think\nwould -- they would accomplish by shooting or killing a German? I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t\nknow. But [indecipherable] those young people were so -- so strong that they felt that I\u2019m going\nto give my life, but I\u2019m going to take a Nazi life, too, with me.",
        "Q: Were you ever asked to join that --",
        "A: No, I did not.",
        "Q: You were never asked to?",
        "A: I was never asked to. Would I have joined? Perhaps. I am not sure. The thing is, I said to you\nbefore, I did not have the courage to smuggle myself to Israel. I am not sure that I had at the time\nthe courage to do something like this. It required a lot of courage, a lot of determination. Those\nfour or five young people had it. And they also were students of that gymnasium that I -- that I\nattended.",
        "Q: These were the four or five students that shot the Nazi?",
        "A: Yeah, yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But they took their example from the Warsaw ghetto uprising. And again, let\u2019s look at that --\nat that part of the war, or that event in Warsaw. Did those young fighters really believed that they\ncan conquer or defeat the German army, the most -- the mightiest ar -- army in Europe with\nhaving some homemade bombs? No, they never believed it. But they believed in -- in exacting a\n-- exa -- exacting a -- a -- a price. And they did. They did. It took the German army longer to\nconquer the Warsaw ghetto than to occupy France. They did. They paid with their lives, yes, but\nthey felt at that point I -- they had nothing to lose. [indecipherable] I\u2019m going to be taken to the\n[indecipherable] and killed anyway. And let\u2019s at least die in dignity. I wish that the population,\nthe Polish population would have been more cooperative and helped us. And helped us to secure\narms and to join us -- or to join the Warsaw ghetto in -- in a quiet uprising that could have\nchanged history, could have, if the Polish resistance that had enough arms, and was well or fairly\nwell organized, mostly officers of the Polish army. If they would have joined the uprising, I\nwonder what would have happened. I wonder. Why didn\u2019t they? Maybe they thought they are\nnot ready, that they aren\u2019t going to accomplish too much, that the Russians are at that time\nalready in Poland and will be in Warsaw in a month or two, and at that point they will -- they\nwill stage an uprising and -- and join the Russian army. That they have no more to lose than to\ngain. I have doubts that -- that this was their thinking, but maybe. But I know for sure -- not for\nsure, I know and I believe that if they would have joined the Warsaw ghetto uprising, things\ncould have taken a different turn.",
        "Q: Y-Y-You\u2019re talking about more formal resistance. I wonder if you could talk a bit about\nwhether or not you or your family or anyone you knew resisted in an everyday way, living in the\nghetto. And this could mean a lot of things. But were there ways that you felt you were resisting\nthe situation?",
        "A: I know that some of the activities, before we went to the ghetto, were activities where\nsomehow we were saying that not losing faith, taking part in those activities as though nothing 1s\ngoing to be happening again -- around us. And that what was to some ene -- some extent, a form\nof resistance. It was -- I said I lost faith, and most of us lost faith, but those activities for --- for a\nmoment, restored faith that -- and gave us -- gave us a reprieve of not thinking of the everyday\nmiseries. That was, to some extent, a form of resistance, resistance to survive. And that was, you\nknow, writing poems or taking be -- children, or coming to meetings, if there were meetings,\ngave us a feeling that not everything is lost. That we are still on a higher level than our enemies.\nThat part, I consider resistance. But we didn\u2019t really [indecipherable] faith or comfort in ourself,\nI doubt it, but for the moment it was good for our soul and our well-being.",
        "Q: So a-at this point you\u2019re living in the ghetto, you\u2019re still working. Your father has a hiding\nplace. Are -- tell us a bit about the deportations that are continuing. How are they being done,\nand how -- how are they being done?",
        "A: Are you referring to deportation to Germany or deportations to camp -- to -- to death camps?",
        "Q: I think now to death camps. At what point does that start?",
        "A: Start what?",
        "Q: When did the deportations to the death camps start? Is that after you went into the ghetto?",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: Or when do you become aware of them, let\u2019s say.",
        "A: Of what? Of the deportations?",
        "Q: The deportations to the death camps.",
        "A: I think in the beginning of 1943. Most or maybe all of the deportations were to Birkenau\nAuschwitz. That -- there were no more deportations to Germany to work in the defense\nindustries. And we were aware of what has happened in Auschwitz, perhaps late, even though we\nwere only several kilometers from that town -- not several, but perhaps 20 or 30 kilometers from\nthat town. But we were aware of it late, perhaps not before -- and I\u2019m guessing here, not before\nApril - May of 1943. Poles were informing us what is happening. But we were also thinking at\nthat time that the world must be knowing what is taking place here. And aren\u2019t they going to\nwarn the Nazis that -- that after the war, they will all be responsible for what they are doing here?\nAnother illusion.",
        "Q: You mentioned the emissary coming back who had jumped off the train. Did you yourself\nhear him speak?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What -- what -- what was he saying? How did he describe the train ride, and getting there?",
        "A: Train -- he described the train ride as a -- as a -- they were very crowded, they couldn\u2019t even\nmove around. And the train did not stop anyplace except Birkenau. He jumped out almost --\nalmost [indecipherable] the camp. He jumped out maybe -- maybe a minute or two before the\ntrain went into the camp. And he -- and I am not positive about it any more -- I think that he was\nable to see the chimneys. I don\u2019t remember any more, but I think that what happened, he came\nback and he saw the chimneys and he saw the people being driven, you know. And convincing\nus all that we will all be brought there and to expect the worst.",
        "Q: Do you remember his name?",

        "Q: What happened to him?",
        "A: He survived the war. He survived the war and did something that I admire him for. After the\nwar -- he survived the war on the same camp as I did, Bergen-Belsen. He immediately -- or a\nweek later, formed an organization to take charge of the camp. That was really very reassuring\nand he develop good relationship with the English army. He used to get as much as -- as much as\nhe could from them for us, and again reviving our spirit. That was so important, reviving our\nspirit. He\u2019s responsible for that, and I -- and we should be grateful to him. Imagine same way as -\n- that Moshe Merin was not a known entity in town, he was also not a very well known entity in\ntown, but he turned out to be a real leader, a real leader.",
        "Q: Can you tell us about the liquidation of the ghetto, or are there -- excuse, but I don\u2019t know all\nthe details, were you deported before the liquidation of the ghetto?",
        "A: No, I was deported --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- the first of August 1942. A day before, we felt that something unusual is going to happen.\nAnd there were rumors and whispering around that the Germans are going to liquidate the ghetto.\nMy family -- I saw my father on that day, very early in the morning, and he said to me, \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing into the hiding with entire family. Maybe you should stay outside. Maybe you'll be able to\nwarn us, or protect us.\u201d And I stayed outside. The Germans surrounded the ghetto early in the\nmorning, shooting and shouting and creating in [indecipherable] fear in everyone. I was taken to\nthe railroad station with the first transport, the first train, so I did not see too much in town after I\nleft, must have been 10 - 11 o\u2019clock in the morning when they were taking me to the s -- to -- to\nthe train station. I arrived in Auschwitz the same day. And when the train stopped, I saw an\nunusual scenes. Dogs barking and jumping, SS men shouting and shooting, and one SS man\nstanding in the middle, he looked to me like a very high officer. And people are being asking to\njump out of the train. It was complete chaos. Mothers looking for children, and we looking for\nour fathers. It was complete chaos. Cha-Chaos designed by it -- wha -- by th -- what -- chaos --\ndesigned chaos is what I wanted to say. I jumped out of the train too, and I was brought before\nthat SS officer, like everyone. And I saw that he 1s -- he 1s directing people to the right and to the\nleft, to the right, women with children, older people. To the left, young people. At that point I\nrealize that what is going to happen to those older people and children is immediate death. And\nI'll never forget that. There were inmates that were coordinating everything. A [indecipherable]\ninmate walked over to us and we said to him, \u201cWhere are those older people going?\u201d He pointed\nout to the chimney and said, \u201cYou see? See that smoke coming out from both chimneys? Those -\n- in that smoke your parents will be in, and the children and older people.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe it,\neven though I knew. But I couldn\u2019t believe that this is happening in such a way, so fast. Why\ndidn\u2019t I believe it? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Of course, two or three years later, when I\nrealized that they did not mislead us, that this is what\u2019s happened. I was [indecipherable] to a\nbarrack with people from my town, but before coming to the barrack they brought us to a place\nwhere we were tattooed, taking away everything and giving us those concentration camp\nuniforms. And marching us to the --\nEnd of Tape Five\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "Q: Okay, you were describing the food that they [indecipherable] I think you were describing the\nfood.",
        "A: Yeah, in the evening we got a piece of bread and a -- and a soup. We were at that time already\nvery, very hungry. And I stayed in that part of the camp either two or three weeks. Then we were\nbrought into another part of the camp. And in the morning -- in that first camp we did not work\nat all. In the morning they were dri -- you were driven outside and standing there for sometimes\ntwo, sometimes three hours before they led us into our units to work. I was assigned to a unit\nwhere we were trying to clear weeds on the river, the Vistula River. It was so difficult. We were\nstanding in the water, hungry. And in the evening we returned, waiting for that piece of bread\nand soup. And I made at that point that -- a decision that I\u2019m going only to eat the soup and keep\nthe piece of bread for next day. That was of help. I worked, and I don\u2019t remember again, several\nweeks, or maybe only two weeks. And luck started to play an important role in my life. The\nGermans established a group of tailors all -- established tailors who were -- who were mending\nuniforms, correcting uniforms and -- I mean, fixing uniforms. And sometimes bringing in certain\nitems that they took away from survivors, like shirts and shoes and if they were in good shape, or\nthey needed a little mending we did it. And trucks were coming once a week or twice a week and\ncarted away those -- that good stuff. I suppose they -- I suppose or I am almost sure that they\ntook it to Germany because -- because consumer goods were not available, not too much was\navailable. People could not, during the war, go out and buy new shoes or -- or had difficulties\nreplacing the worn jackets or shirts. And a cousin of mine was a tailor before the war. He was\nable to bring me in into that group. So I was relieved from being on the outside -- outdo -- being\noutdoors and being under a roof all day long. He was helping me in that production 60 or 70\npercent because I wa -- I did not know what to do, but he was -- everybody had to fulfill a certain\nquota, he was doing it for me with his brother. But I guess the -- the kapo, after awhile, realized\nwhat is happening and he was singling me out many days and kicking me and hitting me. But\ninteresting, he did not -- he did not remove me. He did not remove me, I still stayed under roof,\nand --",
        "Q: I\u2019m not sure what you mean by on the roof.",
        "A: Under the -- under a roof.",
        "Q: Under a roof, okay, mm-hm, yeah, okay, under a roof.",
        "A: I -- I didn\u2019t say it correctly?",
        "Q: No, I -- I -- I --",
        "A: Und -- under --",
        "Q: Under a roof.",
        "A: It was under a roof.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, okay.",
        "A: In -- in closed surroundings, in a building, not exposed to nature. That was going on for\nawhile, but then for certain reasons, they closed that place. And I was again -- that must have\nbeen already in \u00b044, either February or March \u201944. I was distressed, but I know that they are\ngoing to assign me to another commando. Walking in Birkenau, all of a sudden, a man turns\naround to me and saying to me, \u201cAre you Herman Strochlitz\u2019 son?\u201d I said yes. \u201cI was a friend of\nyour father. What are you doing?\u201d I told him the story, that I\u2019m going to be assigned to another\ncommando in the morning, that don\u2019t know where I might go assign -- be -- where I will be\nassigned to. He said, \u201cListen to me something. I am working in the berklidinkskomer.\u201d That was\nan outfit that was sorting out everything, and responsible for giving survivors if they came in,\nand they really needed very badly to [indecipherable] we had a cruel kapo, he never gave\nanything to anybody. But again I was under roof, and what was more important was the fact that\nI had smuggled out a pair of shoes and give it to the people who work in the kitchen and they, in\nturn, gave me a piece of bread. And that was extremely important. I was in that commando for a\nlong time. But again, luck, what happened? One day a Pole came in, and -- who was bleeding,\nhis feet -- didn\u2019t have any shoes at all, and asked the kapo to give him a pair of shoes. The kapo\nthrew him out. You know, it\u2019s interesting that those kapos were very eager to hit or to abuse\npeople who in their eyes are weak. Let me finish this guy. I was able to throw out a pair of shoes.\nThe door was open because he threw him out, and he was sitting not far from the door, I was able\nto throw out a pair of shoes. Those shoes were my salvation, and I'll tell you what happened.\nWhat happened was that I was shipped or deported to -- first to Stutthof, the camp in northern --\nnorth -- north -- north Germany, where we stayed, my friend and I with whom I survived\nAuschwitz [indecipherable], and with whom I was very close, stayed in Stutthof, and I don\u2019t\nremember if a week or two weeks. It\u2019s always a mystery to me why they moved us around back\nand forth. They shipped us to another camp, Hiflingen. We also stayed there for a short period of\ntime, and in Hiflingen, the head of the SS walked on the end, we were standing still, he looked at\nme and pulled me out and say, \u201cYou are staying in the barracks, you don\u2019t have to go to work. I\nwill tell you what you are going to do. If people come in and say to you they are sick, if you have\nanything to give them, give them, but if not, tell them we have nothing to give them.\u201d He brought\na -- a bottle of aspirins after a day or two. That was -- that\u2019s the o-on thing -- the only thing that I\nhad was that one bottle of aspirins. But again, I was protected because I was inside. Maybe the\nwork inside is better than under roof. After awhile we were shipped, my friend and I, to another\ncamp [indecipherable]. We were shipped to that camp, and we were assigned to a commando, it\nwas already probably February, or January or February 1945. It was in s -- in the south of\nGermany. The weather was miserable, absolutely miserable. Snow and rain and cold. We were\nassigned to a commando that was going on every day and time to divide rocks, you know? Why\nthey needed it, a mystery to me. We were all day long standing and hitting rocks, hitting rocks.\nAfter one or two days, my friend was a little older than I was, and very wise. He was able, in\nAuschwitz -- yes, in Birkenau to take with him a razor. We hardly made it back, we couldn\u2019t\nwalk, we hardly made it back to camp. And he said to me, \u201cSig, there\u2019s no way we will survive\none day, what 1s the difference? Let\u2019s finish it tonight.\u201d I walked in, I saw the doc -- the man that\nI gave the pair of shoes.",
        "Q: The Polish man you gave --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- the pair of shoes to?",
        "A: Yes. He winked as he recognizes me, but he\u2019s -- I saw that he has an armband as a doctor, so I\nrealize that he is a doctor in camp. Couldn\u2019t help too much as a doctor because [indecipherable]\nmedicine. After we came to our barracks, I went to see him. This is exactly what he said to me,\n\u201cLook sir, I cannot help you with bread, because all of us are getting one portion of bread. But\none thing I can do for you. I can convince SS men with whom I am friendly to let you stay\ninside, not to go out.\u201d And here I said something and I did something, very, very proud of. Very\nproud. And here I had courage. I told him, I am very grateful to you, but I will not stay inside if\nyou cannot -- if you cannot do the same thing for my friend. He threw me out and shouting to\nme, \u201cHere everyone has to survive. What are you going to gain? You\u2019re not going to sur -- both\nof you aren\u2019t going to dri -- I cannot do more. I cannot do -- I cannot save your friend, too.\u201d In\nthe morning he walked in and they called my number, 132407 out. Iam not moving. A second,\nor couple seconds later, I see the doctor whispering something to this SS man, he called my\nfriend\u2019s name. And we were inside til about the middle of March if I remember correctly, we\nwere shipped to Bergen-Belsen. I have to go back a little bit.",
        "Q: Before you do that, if you just say the name of your friend?",
        "A: Romek Vineweich. I have to back up a little bit.",
        "Q: Okay. You were go -- you were going to go back.",
        "A: Yes. For a short period of time, I was working -- September or was it 19 -- oh, it couldn\u2019t be\nthat. No. In -- in -- no, 1t must have been \u00b043, and I\u2019m working in a commando of -- only for a\nshort period of time, where a transport came from Krakow. And I was working there with my\nfriend, and a woman ap -- we approached some -- some people who came from Krakow to find\nout what they know. Then, we always ask people who came in later what they know what is\nhappening. And I said to one of them, \u201cAnd you are from Krakow? What is your name?\u201d\nGreenberg, she said. I said to her, \u201cWha -- did you have any family in my town?\u201d She said, \u201cYes,\nI had an uncle by the name of Bookwhites.\u201d A very prominent family. I said to her, \u201cYou know,\nyour cousin is working in a commando where she can send you some -- some clothes. I will get\nin touch with her.\u201d So people who are working in that camp with that -- where they were\nworking on clothing. \u201cI will try to get you something.\u201d And I did, I got her some clothes. And we\nspoke two or three times again probably, and I lost track of her. When we came to Bergen-\nBelsen, my friend Romek Vineweich, who was standing once at the -- at the -- at the wires -- at\nelectric wires -- I forgot [indecipherable] and he noticed her, and he noticed that she is dressed\nwell. He started to shout to her and the first question she said to him is, \u201cIs Sigmund here?\u201d He\nsaid yes. She said to him, \u201cLook, I am the schreiberin in -- in camp. That means I have to report\nevery day in the morning how many people died during the night and how many are still alive.\nBut I have access to food because of it.\u201d This -- you know, they don\u2019t know, the Germans if\nduring the night 200 people died or 50 people died. They have a little [indecipherable]. \u201cI will\narrange that he has to come because we need here certain materials that only the men\u2019s camp\nhave, and he will come with some -- some -- with a big glass, or something like -- big -- some\ncontainer.\u201d Oh, that\u2019s better. \u201cAnd I will give you -- give him food.\u201d And that what happened.\nAnd I was going to her every two days or three days and she give us food. And what is even\nequally important, she became my wife. I said equally important, that\u2019s more important. Have to\ncorrect myself. Much more important.",
        "Q: What -- what is her full name?",
        "A: Her -- her name is -- is Rushka. Rose we call her here, Rose -- Rose Strochlitz, but her\nmaiden name is Greenberg.",
        "Q: I want to go back to fill in some of the details of --",
        "A: Yes. You know, I don\u2019t want to forget it. I mentioned before that I ha -- I was guided, or had\nconfidence in instincts. What did I mean? There were, in Auschwitz, every few weeks or a\nmonth or two months, selections. And even though we\u2019re young people, again they looked at\ntheir faces because they were exhausted or -- for the gas chambers. And we never knew, because\nit\u2019s the same young people, if the left is good or the right is good. And we were pushed to the left\nor to the right, I don\u2019t remember. After a minute I turned around to Romek, and I said, \u201cLet\u2019s see\nif we can go better to the left. I somehow don\u2019t feel right here. I don\u2019t know what it is, but I feel\nthat this is no good here. I don\u2019t why I feel that, or I think that way. Let\u2019s move to the left, not to\nthe right. Let\u2019s try to -- to smuggle ourself to the left.\u201d I was right.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t completely understand how Romek was your friend, was he a friend from your town?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: How did you meet him?",
        "A: He went to the same gymnasium that I did, but he was five or six years older. He came, not in\n43. He was 1n hiding, and they brought him in 1944. And they assigned him to the same\nbarracks, and I got attached to him and he to me. Why? Who knows? Attached very much so.\nAnd who knows why? He was protecting me all the time and I was protecting him. In Hilflingin,\non that camp, I was kept inside. I had -- I could get more bread. I never ate it until he came.\nYeah, I ate my portion, I always kept the second portion -- and I was hungry -- for him. He has\ndescribed that relationship [indecipherable] 1946, he described it in an article that he wrote for an\nIsraeli newspaper, and to my great regrets, I was looking for that article many times and I cannot\nfind it.",
        "Q: I wonder if we -- you can go back to when you first arrive, you described arriving. Can you\ntell us a little bit more about when you actually are given your uniforms and tattooed? I mean,\nwhat actually happened and did you know that was going to happen?",
        "A: No. We didn\u2019t know it was going to happen. We knew only from the statement made by one\nof the inmates that those who were the people and the children are going -- th-they showed us\nthese chimneys, you see that smoke coming out. But we did not know. But the fact that they\ntattooed us led me to believe that it\u2019s not our end, it\u2019s not my end. Why would they go through\nthe trouble of tattooing us? So it was reassuring. You know [indecipherable] they shaved us\ncompletely. And I walked out and I had problems recognizing my friends and they recognizing\nme. You look so different, you know? You look so different not in your clothes and -- and your\nhead shaved, you know, that it was really difficult to recognize each other.",
        "Q: At this point, wh-what do you know of your family? Di --",
        "A: Of my family?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: You know something? I knew that my family was brought to Birkenau on the third day. Why?\nBecause on that transport were also people who were -- who were not -- who were not sent to --\nto -- to -- to -- to the gas chambers, but to camp, and they told me. No, that is not correct. No,\nthat is not correct. Now I remember a little more. I was trying to find out where\u2019s my family. I\nknow my two young sisters should be in the -- in the camp with all the rest of the women. They\nwere not there. I didn\u2019t count on my parents, but my two sisters. After awhile I found out\nsomething. Found out that there was a young man in the train who had a gun, and he was\nshooting out of the train and he hurt an SS man. And the people were -- who were there when the\ntrain arrived, you know, there were always some sof -- some -- some inmates, you know,\ncoordinating everything, told us that on that day, one train came in that the enti -- there were no\nselections, entire train was taken immediately to the gas chambers. So I found out very early that\nI lost my parents. And because my wife was in the bunker with my parents, she was also taken\nimmediate to -- to the gas chambers.",
        "Q: And your sisters.",
        "A: And my two sisters, yes.",
        "Q: Were -- were you able to say kaddish for them?",
        "A: No. No. Why? I cannot visualize staying -- or saying kaddish in the -- no, I did not. Cannot\nvisualize saying kaddish in the barracks. Why? I really don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: What [indecipherable]. We have to change tapes.\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "A: Sitting here I\u2019m thinking why I did not say kaddish. I don\u2019t have any guilt feelings about it,\nbecause I was taught that the prayer of kaddish 1s a reaffirmation of life. Could I at that point re -\n- reaffirm and praise God and reaffirm that life is -- that life is -- 1s -- 1s beautiful, or whatever\nyou want to say? I couldn\u2019t. Did I think at that time, what I\u2019m saying just now? No. But I have to\nanalyze things later on and try to determine in your own mind what was -- what were you\nthinking unconsciously. And I could have thought unconsciously that there\u2019s no reason for me to\nsay kaddish. Am I sure about it? No, I am not. But it could have happened.",
        "Q: Did -- do you remember having any -- what were your thoughts at that point about God and\nyour faith?",
        "A: I know for sure that at that point, I couldn\u2019t believe that there 1s a God, a merciful,\ncompassionate God who let tho -- whose [indecipherable] let things like this happen to his\nchosen people. Difficult to believe.",
        "Q: What were you reactions then? Was it anger, or sadness? To -- to that thought about God?",
        "A: Perhaps no sadness, but anger. Anger. Even though I was not a religious person, I still felt that\n-- that God, or any -- that God could permit those things to take place. So anger was the right\nreaction. And as I said before, it\u2019s very difficult to live without faith. Very, very difficult to live.\nVery difficult to justify things without faith. You must live with faith.",
        "Q: Talk about that at that point in your life, you -- you had talked about losing your confidence in\nthe ghetto, you were questioning your faith. How -- how did you keep going?",
        "A: Where? In camp?",
        "Q: I-In -- in -- in -- yes, in Auschwitz, in the camps.",
        "A: Luck. Luck was my -- my biggest friend. I described to you four situations where luck played\na very important role in surviving. Don\u2019t believe that anybody will tell you -- any of the\nsurvivors will tell you that they were smart, that\u2019s the reason they survived. Oh, that is nonsense.\nLuck, being young, or coming to Auschwitz late, at the end of \u201943 or -- or \u00b044, end of \u201944, not\n\u00b043, where -- where the war was coming -- we knew that the war was coming to an end, and that\nkept you going.",
        "Q: You -- you were still there an awfully long time.",
        "A: In Auschwitz?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I was from -- first of all [indecipherable] the 26\" of October 1944.",
        "Q: So more than a year.",
        "A: Yes. But most of the time, I was working inside, not exposed to -- to wind, rain and snow.",
        "Q: Can you describe your -- your barracks and the kapo in charge, I don\u2019t know if you remember\nhim in any way, the name and how he ran your barracks.",
        "A: Of course I don\u2019t remember the name, I never spoke to him because he was god, you know.\nYou don\u2019t talk to god, you know. He was god in that barracks, that\u2019s a ver -- he could kill you or\n-- or deny you the portion of bread, whatever he wanted to do. I never spoke to him, I don\u2019t\nremember his name. He was cold. The Germans had a knack of selecting those -- those -- those\nkapos or people who they felt will fulfill that function that they want them to fulfill. To make our\nlife absolutely miserable, to kill us and to -- to abuse us, all right? They had a knack for choosing\nthose people. It was not only in my barracks, in all the rest of the barracks.",
        "Q: Was this kapo German?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: Was he German or Polish, or -- do you remember?",
        "A: Yes [indecipherable] he was German. He were a criminal.",
        "Q: I want to go through some of the details of the -- of the day. Can you tell us about roll call?",
        "A: Yes. I mentioned to you before that that roll call was either five or six o\u2019clock in the morning.\nWe were standing outside for hours, and waiting to go out. And was very difficult, especially in\nthe wintertime. Even though I knew that I will not have to go outside, that I will be able to go\ninto the -- the [indecipherable] and be inside, those two or three hours -- it\u2019s all by -- it was all by\ndesign, because I remember people after an hour or two just giving in, falling down and that\u2019s\nall. They would have died anyway, you know, cause they were already that weak, you know?\nBut even to make the strongest weaker, it was by design.",
        "Q: So da -- when you --",
        "A: They were trying to -- the reason for that roll call was that they were trying to determine how\nmany people are on the barrack. And that was --",
        "Q: When you went to roll call, did you have a strategy in your mind for surviving? Were you\nstanding next to your friend, were -- were you ever holding each other up?",
        "A: We were -- I was standing next to my friend, holding each other up, but no strategy. Don\u2019t\nbelieve that something like this could exist in the camp. What kind of strategy can you have?\nWhat -- what can you do? You are at the whim of people who are -- whose aim is only to kill\nyou. How can you prevent it? You have nothing to -- to defend yourself. You cannot run out\nbecause you are -- you have the electric wires, and it\u2019s powerless, with SS men all over, they will\nshoot you immediately. Even though, I have to be on record that one of my school friends was\nable to run away from Auschwitz, but he\u2019s -- I believe is not the only survivor among the two or\nthree survivors who were able to run away from Birkenau Auschwitz. I can tell you that he lived\nin Israel, and he passed away. We were trying -- every time I came to Israel, all my school\nfriends invited me in. We were spending an evening together reminiscing. We were trying for a\nyear or two to convince him to tell us how he survived. We couldn\u2019t get it. One day -- one\nevening, I turned around to him -- I was very close to him before the war. I said, \u201cShumek, you\nhave to tell us. Just for history\u2019s sake, you have to tell us.\u201d\u201d He was thinking for a moment and he\nsaid okay. I can tell you he was talking for a couple hours. You could cut the air, it was such a\nsilence in the room. And he told us that he had a friend who was working outside the wires, and\nwho hid some clothes for him in a hole, and he described him -- where the hole is. And he will --\nhe will try to get him into that commando to be outside, and then somehow during the day,\nwatching, he should disappear. And he disappeared. And, you know, most of the people that tried\nto run away were hanged the next day. We didn\u2019t -- and we were forced to watch the hanging, of\ncourse. Within a day, two or three, four, they didn't bring him back, I said to myself and to my\nfriend, he escaped. And he told us how he escaped, and what he did. After two days being in that\n-- in that hole -- but he took with him some food, being two days and two nights in that hole, he\nrealized on the third day that the search is off. In the middle of the night he slowly crawled all\nout and went to town. And he saw a light in one of the homes. He entered. He entered and the\nwoman became very scared. He reassured her, and she kept him for another two or three days.\nAnd then he said to her, I have some friends -- again, the woman became his wife later, who are -\n- who look like Aryans not Jews, who are working in Warsaw on false papers. Take me first to\nBendezin. We will sit together, we will look like a -- a son, a mother driving, you know, you\nlook -- nobody will pay any attention to us. And he was successful. She brought him to\nBendezin. In Bendezin he had a friend, a Pole, with whom he was very close. Very unusual to be\nclose, but he was close with him. You -- he came from a very fine family. As a matter of fact, the\nfamily lived in our -- in our house on the second floor. And the son was in town, and they\ndecided, you have to bring him to Warsaw to be -- to -- they will infor -- in Warsaw they will\nfind for him false papers, and he will survive, together with his sisters. With the Pole\u2019s sisters.\nNow, we will survive together with -- with a -- a -- a family that he knew very well, that -- that\nhe knew -- he knew that they are in Warsaw and where they are in Warsaw. That Pole was very\nsmartly shrewd. He took with him on the train, some bottles of liquor. And they were sitting in\nthe train and trying to pretend that they are drinking. SS man came in and he became friend of\nthem, let\u2019s have a drink. They all became drunk and they didn\u2019t realize anything, they were\ndrunk, completely drunk. And they came to Warsaw with him, and found the -- his friends, and\nthey prepared false papers for him, and he was working in a cinema. He didn't look\n[indecipherable], but here is again something that is unexplainable. In the Warsaw ghetto he was\nrounded up with other Poles and taken to a place. He wound up place on the floor. An SS man\nwalks in, and looks around and turns round to him, \u201cYou were the one who run away from\nAuschwitz.\u201d He knew that this is the end. At that moment, and artillery shell 1s exploding in front\nof -- of the place, and everybody is running away in the [indecipherable]. Was he smart? No, was\nluck.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Levinstein. Shumek Levinstein.",
        "Q: How -- how was your health after several months of working in Auschwitz? Wer -- were you\nunderweight --",
        "A: The moment I went --",
        "Q: -- could you -- how -- how was your health?",
        "A: Not too bad. Well, I was sitting all day long and being able to -- to -- to -- to -- to -- to -- to\nsmuggle something out again here as I did in the berklidinkskomer, and getting a little bit -- and\ngetting a piece of bread. Was not too bad. I was young. You know, I had typhoid. And again, it\nwill sound too heroic, but I\u2019m going to tell you about. Maybe I should be on record, and maybe\nnot. As I told you, I worked several weeks in a camp where I met my future wife. I worked not\ndoing anything really. But we had to get our food from the kitchen. That was a kitchen run by\nhalf women. The head of that kitchen was a miserable person, and if the commando was --\nconsists of 12 people, she gave only 10 -- 10 pieces of -- something like this, in order to preserve\nand give the SS men [indecipherable]. One day I turned around to the kapo who was the one\nkapo that I know that was not so cruel. Said to him, \u201cLook, today I would like to go with my\nfriend to -- to get our soup.\u201d",
        "Q: Is this with Rose?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: No, with your friend.",
        "A: Shumek.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: With Romek.",
        "Q: Romek, mm-hm.",
        "A: We went there and she did the same thing. I said, we are 12 or 15, whatever it was. Out! I\nkicked the soup completely. And she had a cane in her hand with a tron. She took that cane an-\nand was standing straight. It\u2019s too heroic, but I have to be on record. She took that cane and she\nlifted it, and was standing straight -- all of a sudden she let it down, and she started to shout,\nclean it up, give him 15. So next day in the morning we are walking again into that camp, she is\nstanding at the gate, and -- with SS man, and the SS man is calling my number out. I said to\nRomek, that\u2019s it. The SS man and -- together with her brought me into the kitchen. And she\nturned around to me and said, \u201cYou are going to work here with me.\u201d I stayed 1n the kitchen with\nher. And when I got the typhoid and my friend also, we knew that they are going to take us to\nthat [indecipherable] that we were going to be one day because after one day there they were\ntaking people to so -- after two days to the gas chambers. I got in touch with her somehow, and I\ntold her what is happening, and if she can get me, not into the [indecipherable], but to the unit on\nsil -- on my block, and I can survive there, because -- and she did it. A day before I left -- before\nthey deported us from Auschwitz she came to the -- to the electric wires, and she threw out a\ngold -- a piece of gold and she said to Romek, \u201cGive it to Sigmund, gold -- this is the only way to\nsurvive.\u201d If you are going to -- you are able to buy something for the gold wherever they were --\nthey\u2019re going to ship you. And it helped. But I have to tell you, again it sounds too heroic, but I\nhave to be on record. She was trying, after the war -- she was a Dutch woman, to get in touch\nwith me. She was sending people and letters. I never responded to any letters of her. I never -- I\nsaid to -- to the people, I will never see her. The fact that she saved me and my friend does not\njustify what she did by causing to have tens or hundreds of people to die by not giving them\nenough food. I never wanted to get in touch with her, and I didn\u2019t. [indecipherable] sound too\nheroic, I was already in love with my future wife.",
        "Q: Per-Perhaps you\u2019re saying she might have also liked you.",
        "A: She what? Might what --",
        "Q: Might have liked you?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Romantically?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: The -- the woman in the kitchen.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes, yes. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, yes, she want probably to marry me.",
        "Q: I see, yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I cannot prove anything.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But I never, ever responded to any letter. Never wanted to see her. My friend was one day in\nAmsterdam and he saw her. She was crying bitterly. Why doesn\u2019t -- at least let -- let him answer\na letter? I said no, she is not entitled to it. Does it sound too heroic? No?",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit more about were you ever able to steal a moment here or there with -- with\nyour future wife, with Rose? How were you able to see her, other than the time --",
        "A: Yeah, because I was working on their camp.",
        "Q: Yeah, okay.",
        "A: And I could see her, and spend the -- and as a matter of fact, I have already the typhoid and\nshe was able, and -- with the permission of my kapo to let me go into their barracks and not be\noutside to sleep all day. That was of help, too. Again luck played a role.",
        "Q: Did you know you were falling in love with her?",
        "A: With my wife?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Not in camp.",
        "Q: Not in camp.",
        "A: Not in camp. But we were liberated together and somehow the fact that she told Romek, is\nSigmund here too, indicated to me that she cares.",
        "Q: I want to return to the moment, the time when you were very discouraged, and you and your\nfriend were considering suicide. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? Had you thought\nabout killing yourself before your friend showed you the razor, and why at that point were you\nconsidering it?",
        "A: There was no way out. I knew that I will die the next day or two days later, that we cannot\nwalk even. It was a terrible winter. And I said to myself, or my friend said, why, why, why still\nsuffer? There\u2019s no way out. We cannot walk, even. We cannot walk. We have to all day long try\nto divide those rocks and we cannot do it, so somebody will shoot us anyway there. If an SS man\nwalked by and say we cannot do it, he will shoot us anyhow. What is the use? I am positive that\nwe would have done it. Positive, if not for the doctor. I have no doubts about that, that we would\nhave done it. As I said before, and I hope I\u2019m not offending anybody. There is no way for\nanybody to imagine, or to try to -- to -- to understand the feeling and the mood. It\u2019s impossible.\nIt\u2019s impossible. Only people who were there are able to describe them.

        "A: What it sounded what?",

        "A: I'm not sure I understand the question.",
        "Q: What would you have been hearing?",
        "A: You see, when could I hear anything? When you are standing at the appelle in the morning,\nwe didn\u2019t talk. Nobody permitted us to talk. When we were coming back in the evening, we are\nso tired. Nobody think -- we li -- nobody was thinking about trying to talk or to -- to be nostalgic.\nNo. We were waiting for the piece of bread, and lie down, that\u2019s all. There was not real talk\nexcept when a new transport came in and we wanted to know what is happening in the world. At\nthat time were talk, and being encouraged, you know\u201d? Believing that the war is coming to an\nend. I remember -- I remember when the allied troops landed in Normandy, and there was a\ntransport, I\u2019d forgot from where. They came and told us that the Americans are in Europe\nalready. And that was very, very reassuring, very. It inspired confidence again that maybe,\nmaybe the tragedy is coming to an end. But to have just -- just empty talk, that was no such\nthing. I don\u2019t remember ever having any empty talk during the appelle, or during -- or after we\ncame ho -- came back from -- from our work assignment. I don\u2019t remember.",

        "Q: Was there ever a time, either in camp or when you might have been marching somewhere,\nthat you were allowed to sing, for instance? Were -- were you ever allowed to sing when you\nwere in camp? Or did you ever sing?",
        "A: Could very well be, but I am not sure, but in one of the camps it could have been Hiflingen,\nwhen we were mar -- they were marching -- wo -- marching out, I\u2019m not sure that the SS man\nwas trying to make us sing a German song or something like this, but I\u2019m not sure about it. I\ndon\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve talked about your faith some, and -- and -- and the questioning of it, did you ever --\ndid you pray once you were in the camps?",
        "A: No. No.",
        "Q: So what ke -- what kept you going?",
        "A: The will to survive is a very strong will. The idea that I will survive and tell the world what\nhappened always was a very, very important element in that feeling of survival. And the feeling\nor the statements of those who were taken to the gas chambers, don\u2019t forget us, was also very\nimportant. Don\u2019t forget us. This was also very important to me. And that was kep -- kept me\ngoing. That what kept me going. You are talking about singing, and I would like to share\nsomething that to me was to some extent understandable, and to some extent I couldn't\nunderstand it. The sonderkommando came one day back and they told a story of an old rabbi\nwho was with a group of people taken to the gas chambers, the rabbi started to sing, and asked\nthem all to sing. We are dying as martyrs, and don\u2019t be afraid to die. Singing and dancing before\nthey entered the cha -- the gas chamber. It\u2019s good to be on [indecipherable] like this.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No, but I know that people were saying things like this. I don\u2019t remember somebody saying it\ndirectly to me, but I\u2019m sure that there are people who were told by those who were taken to the\ngas chambers, don\u2019t forget me, tell the world what happened. Oh, I am positive about it.",
        "Q: How aware were you of the daily functioning of the gas chamber and the crematorium?",
        "A: We saw the sonderkommando, they were in a special block, every day. And they told us that\nthe people are being taken to showers and telling them they have to be clean, and after they will\ncome out there will be food for them, and misleading them completely. When the entered the\nshowers, of course, an SS man was throwing in a -- a gas can Zyklon B, and they heard in the --\nfor a couple -- for three or four minutes people shouting and then, all of a sudden everything was\nsilent, they opened the doors and everybody was dead, of course, holding to each other, and the\nscene was incredible, they were -- always used to say. Mothers holding children tight to them,\ntheir [indecipherable].

        "Q: But how --",
        "A: So we knew exactly what was happening. We knew what transports are coming in, from\nwhere.",
        "Q: Di -- were you ever one of the people to inform the new transports what happened to --",
        "A: No, I was not --",

        "Q: What about s-sanitation, when -- were you allowed to bathe, and when were you allowed to\ngo to the bathroom?",
        "A: In the morning. And my friend and I were keeping it up, they were alway wa -- wa -- people\nstopped after a week or two weeks to wash themself.",
        "Q: People stopped washing themselves?",
        "A: Yes, washing themselves. We never stopped. But having said that, and I don\u2019t remember why,\nin Bergen-Belsen, or even maybe before, we never had the place where we could wash ourself.\nAnd when I was liberated, they had to use a special oil to clean me. The dirt was in -- in my --\nmy entire body, in -- in -- in my flesh almost, you know? They took a special oil to clean me.",
        "Q: When you and your friend, were you aw-aware that you were purposely trying to continue to\nbathe a-as a way to --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- to -- to stay --",
        "A: Yes. And that is an indication where we thought we can survive. The clear indication that we\nare young we will survive, as the war is coming to an end. Would I have done the same thing if I\nwould have been taken in the beginning of \u201942? I doubt it, because the situation was so gloomy,\nthe ger -- the Germans were in Moscow almost, in Leningrad, all over the world, you know?\nThere was no reason for me to believe that the German army can be -- can be defeated. There\nwas no reason whatsoever, they -- they occupied all Europe and they are now next to Stalingrad\nand Moscow and Leningrad, and how -- and again, how do we find out? New transports come in.",
        "Q: One more question on sanitation, you said you were allowed to go to the bathroom in the\nmorning, just once a day?",
        "A: Of course in the evening went -- went again. But during the day, I doubt it very much. I doubt\nit very much. First in Poland, in the place that I was working, inside, there was no rest room.\nThere were no such thing. No.",
        "Q: Can -- can you tell us -- Id just like you to tell us a little bit more about your friendship with\nRomek. What did you tr -- were you able to be with him most days and how did that --",
        "A: All -- every day, all day long.",
        "Q: How --",
        "A: Every day all day long. You see, and again, probably subconsciously, when you know that\nyou lost everything, that you have no family, you are trying to forge a friendship with somebody\nwho\u2019 ll be with you, giving you the feeling that you are not alone. And that cemented that\nfriendship. I can lean on him, and he on me. He could watch my -- my -- my -- my piece of\nbread, and I can watch his piece of bread. And you are as eager to make sure that he will survive\nas you, and he is eager to make sure that you are s -- you are going to survive. That creates a\nlifetime friendship.",
        "Q: What about the very minor contact you\u2019d had with Rose also, was that something that gave\nyou a bit of hope for the future?",
        "A: Mm, I don\u2019t [indecipherable]",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was that something that at -- in some part of your mind you hung onto also?",
        "A: I am not sure about it. I am not sure about that I was thinking at that point of a marriage, but\nthat was unthinkable, incredible, you know? It never entered her mind or my mind. But on the\nfirst day of liberation, I was outside with Romek and we saw her sister. I asked, \u201c\u201cWhere\u2019s\nRushka?\u201d I asked. She said, \u201cWe have to take her from the barracks, she has typhoid, to the\nkrankenhaus.\u201d I said, \u201cI will go.\u201d I will -- I had to crawl before I a -- was able to reach the\nbarrack, she was already taken. I couldn\u2019t walk there at that time too fast, you know, I had to\ncrawl, you know, almost. So I didn\u2019t see her. But I do believe -- I do believe that I saw her in the\nhospital four or five days later. I do believe in that, yes.",
        "Q: Go back just a bit in the -- the weeks before liberation, you\u2019re describing liberation that you\nhave to crawl. Obviously you\u2019ve deter -- your health has deteriorated, so --",
        "A: Oh, of course.",
        "Q: -- what state of health were you in right before liberation, and then sort of bring us up to\nliberation.",
        "A: I mentioned to you that I had typhoid in Auschwitz. There are two types of typhoids. I had the\nsecond type [indecipherable] had in Bergen-Belsen. My future wife saved me. She was able to\nget hold of some medication and send it over to me. That helped me.",
        "Q: So in the weeks right before liberation, were you recovering from typhoid, or --what was your\nstate of health?",
        "A: Before liberation?",
        "Q: A few weeks before.",
        "A: I am not sure that I remember when I discovered that I have typhoid.",
        "Q: Oh, oh.",
        "A: Iam not sure.",
        "Q: Oh, it was after liberation that you had typhoid?",
        "A: No, before liberation.",
        "Q: Before, okay.",
        "A: Before liberation, but I cannot pinpoint.",
        "Q: Well why -- why were you in such bad health that you had to crawl? Not why, but describe\nyour state of health.",
        "A: Because -- because -- because I wa -- it was \u201945, I was exhausted, tired. My weight was 88\npounds at the libera -- on the liberation, 88 pounds. I was weak, extremely weak from all those\nyears. And of course I do believe that on liberation day or two days -- a day later, I -- my typhoid\ndisappeared. But I was extremely weak, weighing 88 pounds.",
        "Q: Well, what was it like to be in the camps, like the week before liberation, what were the\nGermans doing?",
        "A: It\u2019s interesting. A day before liberation on April 14, one day before we were liberated, we all\nknew or felt or sensed that the war has come to an end, that we are going to be liberated in a day\nor two. The Germans were in a hurry. We saw it that they are in a hurry, that they are trying to\nescape. And in the morning when we opened our eyes, we saw that the towers are empty, there\nare no SS men any more. And then we heard some shooting, artillery or something like this. In\nan hour or two -- hours later a single tank rolled into the camp. And we heard -- and this was so\nreassuring, y-y-yo -- you are free. We are here liberating you. I saw it, and I think that perhaps I\nwas not sure that this is true, but in another tr -- \u2018nother English tank rolled in and I saw them\ndistributing chocolate to people. That was a terrible mistake, people were dying like flies, taking\ntwo pieces of chocolate, they couldn\u2019t -- their stomachs couldn\u2019t take it, they were dying like\nflies. Again my friend saved me. He did not let me take anything. And here I have to tell you a\nvery interesting moment at night he was afraid that the -- that the hunger will -- will force me to\ngo out and take some food that I cannot digest. He tied his feet with my feet all night long. I\ncouldn't move. He was much more experienced than I. We were -- he tied with a rope my feet to\nhis feet. This is what friendship 1s all about. You care. You care for your friend as much as you\ncare for yourself, or more.",
        "Q: What -- what did you think and he think you were able to eat?",
        "A: Soup.",
        "Q: Just soup.",
        "A: He was constantly saying, take two soups, five soups, as many as you want, but soup, a soup,\na warm soup. And I followed his advice.",
        "Q: So what did you do when you realized there were no Germans in the tower? There was about\nan hour before the first tank. What did people do --",
        "A: Something like this.",
        "Q: Okay, there was time. What did --",
        "A: We were -- we were waiting. We knew that we -- we knew that something is happening. We\nwere waiting. We greeted those liberators as though they are angels from heaven. It was a lot of\nexcitement, euphoric. We were all euphoric. But I have to mention here something. That feeling\nof happiness, after awhile, and I cannot pinpoint it to two weeks or four weeks or six weeks,\ncompletely faded away. All of a sudden, most of us es -- I, an-and I would say most of us felt\nthat we cannot return to our homes. We have no families, but all those liberators will go back to\nUnited Kingdom, the United States, and -- and live a normal life, but we are alone.\n[indecipherable] we have to start from the beginning. What will I do? And how will I be able to\ncope with that fact that I am alone, or only with one friend? That was a depressing feeling. Very\nstrong, depressing feeling. And that lasted for awhile. But then, after that Rosensaft organized of\ncom -- organized th-the -- all survivors, we became more active. That feeling was replaced by a\nbelief that we will manage. It was interesting also that most of the survivors, and of course\nincluding me, were trying to get married, to create life again. That was a -- a crucial point in our\nliberation, to prove to the world that we are going to bring life again. And that we will be able to\nfind a place, someplace, where we will be able to restore life. And that what happened really.\nThose who were more courageous than I went to live in Israel. The rest of us went to the United\nStates. And having said that, I must express my feelings here, that people who are born here in\nthe United States don\u2019t appreciate at all what the United States 1s all about. We do. We do. We --\nI am -- I am all for the United States, it\u2019s the greatest country that existed in all s -- all civilized\nlife for the last two or 3000 years. We have to preserve it. Why am I expressing it in such a -- in\nsuch an interview? I guess because I need my children and grandchildren to know how I -- how I\nwas in awe of the United States. Maybe they will understand it too.",
        "Q: When were you able to come here?",
        "A: Icame January 1951.",
        "Q: And in between your liberation?",
        "A: I don\u2019t go to work on that. I stay home, I read hist -- American history or the Bill of Rights, I\ndon\u2019t go to work on that day. This is for me a day of celebration.",
        "Q: Oh, now you don\u2019t go to work on that day?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t go to work on that day now, it\u2019s a day of celebration and I sit home and I read\nAmerican history or Bill of Rights, whatever -- whatever I can. But I never go to work on that\nday. This is not the way to wor -- not -- is not a day to work. This is a way -- a day to celebrate.",
        "Q: And just briefly, after liberation, where are you relocated to? And I\u2019m presuming that you\u2019re\nable to stay with your friend and also Rose?",
        "A: Yeah, we were relocated -- the German -- the English army burned the entire camp because it\nwas infested and they had to burn all the barracks. And they transferred us -- they transferred us\nto where -- about three miles from the old barracks and two German military barracks. They\nwere, of course, completely different. We had the very nice room, there were restrooms around.\nAnd I lived, of course, with my friend in that room, and Rose lived with her sister in another\nbuilding not far from that building. I saw her every day, almost every day.\nEnd of Tape Eight\nBeginning Tape Nine",
        "A: Probably at the end of 1940 -- to Rose -- or not to Rose, in December of 1945. December of\n1945, I\u2019m sorry. We have one daughter, and we have adopted three children. One child was the\nchild of Rose\u2019s sister, that she was able after the parents were taken to Auschwitz, Rose was able\nto bring her to a Polish family and she survived with that Polish family. After the war, we\nbrought her back bi -- brought her back to Bergen-Belsen and she lived with us for awhile. But\nthere was a little problem. She was so grateful to that Christian family that she was looking at us\nas people who are trying to take away her religion. And it was very, very difficult. But in 1949,\nRose and I went to Israel. I had some family in Israel from before the war, and Rose had a larger\nfamily, two uncles, and she of course went with us. And here a dramatic change took place. All\nof a sudden she fell in love with the people in Israel and she didn't want to return. She wanted to\nlive her life there. And she lives there, she\u2019s married, she has four children, we have how many\u2019?\nFour, five [inaudible] -- we have nine grandchildren there. No, we have four grandchildren and --\nand how many did I say?",
        "Q: You said nine.",
        "A: Nine or maybe 10 great-grandchildren, you know. And we are very, very attached to each\nother. Wer -- I used to go twice a year with my wife to be with them for six, eight weeks\nsometimes. At least six weeks. And we are, as I said, very close. I love my grandchildren, and I\nlove my great-grandchildren very much. They come to the States and stay with me, and we have\na marvelous time with them. Then, in 1966, something happened. Rose had a cousin in Buenos\nAires in Argentina, and they, husband and wife were involved in a terrible automobile accident\nand got killed. A school friend of mine who lived in Buenos Aires called me up and told me the\nstory and he said, you have to come, because those are two children and nobody knows what to\ndo with them. I will take care of. I went. I spent several weeks in Argentina. I had difficulties\ncommunicating with them, but I was able to get some visas for them to come to the United\nStates. They were tourist visas. They came to the United States and they stayed with me for\nawhile, and even though when I came to Buenos Aires their friends were trying to tell them --\ntheir school friends that I came maybe to take advantage of them. After they came to the States\nand lived with me for a few weeks, I remember taking them to the airport because they had to go\nback to Argentina for me to get permanent visas. They were so afraid that maybe I will not get\nthose permanent visas, they were holding my hand in the airport and I reassured them. And after\n-- and I don\u2019t remember any more, maybe two or three months later, I got the visas and they\ncame to live with us. I love them very dearly. I don\u2019t make any distinction between my daughter\nand the rest of them. And they made me proud of them. One is a professor -- assistant professor\nin Boston. He was first at BU, and now he\u2019s in a different college. And one is a physician in -- in\nNew Britain, who became the chief of neurology in the hospital. And the o -- his brother,\nextremely capable young man, who is -- wrote his story in a very moving way, and who gave us\nthree grandchildren and the -- the younger son gave us also three grandchildren, they come very\noften, but really not often enough and we spend time together. I try to -- to -- to direct them, or to\nshow them the right way of life and I perhaps am successful, perhaps.",
        "Q: You speak about your grandchildren --\nQ2: Give me one second.",
        "Q: You speak about your grandchildren and great-grandchildren --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- children, and you\u2019re doing this interview today. What do you want them to know about\nAuschwitz, your experience?",
        "A: I imagine in the beginning that I was reluctant, very much so, for the last 45 or 50 years, to\ntell my story. But I am doing it today for them. They should know the story. They should watch\nit and remember. I did not speak to them enough, or perhaps at all about my life in camps. Now,\nthey will have a record, and to me that is extremely important.",
        "Q: What was the relux -- reluctance?",
        "A: To talk to them? I was reluctant to talk to anybody about it in the beginning. The main -- the\nfeeling why not was based on a certain, if not arrogance, but a certain feeling, what am I going to\ntell them, they don\u2019t understand me -- they don\u2019t understand it anyhow. On that feeling\ndisappeared. And as you probably know, I was the national chairman of the Days of\nRemembrance, appointed by President Carter, and then the -- reappointed by President Reagan\nand Bush. I was the chairman of the -- of the -- forgot the name of that committee. Yes, dealing\nwith the [indecipherable] of the future museum. I was a member of the executive board, we\nworked very hard to make sure that the world cannot forget, and I became the national chairman\nof Days of Remembrance. That first year I reported to the council that I was able to convince\nthree governors, the governor of Connecticut, New York and New Jersey to have Days of\nRemembrance in their capitals and invite -- and invite all the [indecipherable] and people to -- to\nbe present and to remember the Holocaust, lighting candles. When I reported it, I got a standing\novation. The next year, and I don\u2019t remember the numbers any more, I probably reported 10 or\n12. After four or five years I reported, I have every state having Days of Remembrance in their\ncapitals. I have mai -- main cities. I don\u2019t remember -- don\u2019t remember how many cities doing\nexactly the same thing. I was very, very proud -- I am very, very proud of -- of accomplishing\nwhat I have accomplished. If I spent too much time, for me I did not. But I -- perhaps for my\nfamily I was too -- too many days away. I was in Washington very, very often, maybe five, six\ndays a month in Washington, and traveling to -- to o -- other states and making sure that there\n[indecipherable] done properly. But this is a legacy that I am leaving, leaving for my children\nand grandchildren, never to forget, to get involved in the cause of memory.",
        "Q: Thank you very much.",
        "A: Thank you very much for listening to me. Thank you all. When I came to the United States,\nmy aunt, the sister of my mother\u2019s, had that picture. It was sent to her before the war. My parents\nare here, young, and to me they look beautiful. I keep that picture in my room, to look at it\nwhenever I am there, and I revive memories looking at that picture. It\u2019s very helpful. That\npicture I received in Israel from my sister\u2019s friends. She had a -- she had quite a few friends, and\nI am not sure why my sister sent the picture to Israel. I was thinking many times that maybe she\nwas thinking of going there, and she sent the picture to get her some papers or something like\nthis, but I am not positive, I really don\u2019t know.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, my father grew up as a -- after his par -- parents -- his parents died very, very early at his\nage.",
        "A: Yes. There were 31,000 Jews living in Bendezin. Of course there\u2019s not a trace of them today\nin that town. Life was very interesting and families were extremely close. My grandfather lived\nacross the street from our home. Life was not abundant in riche -- riches, but somehow we -- we\nfelt that we are destined to play an important role in the life of humankind, that we have given\nthe world the 10 commandments, not in order to achieve power, but to set moral examples. To\nset standards of how to deal, how men should deal with God, how men should deal with -- with\nman. I went, as a youngster to a religious, Zionist school. I stayed there for about four years and\nthen my parents transferred me into a secular [indecipherable] school. I remember Friday --\nFridays very well. My mother wil -- getting up very early, going to buy [indecipherable] chicken.\nAnd there was excitement of a Friday. Saturday morning I used to go with my grandfather, and\nsometimes with my father to pray. The town on Saturday was completely engulfed in silence.\nYou see only Jewish people marching to the synagogue, quietly. The prayers were -- were\n[indecipherable] and you felt some sacredness in the air. I loved those Fridays and I loved those\nSaturdays. Furthermore, I remember that Jews from its -- Jews from surrounding towns were\ncoming to our town in order to buy chicken, fish and bring them into the shochet, the ritual\nslaughterer. They were -- they were buying all -- always for the whole week and then came the\nnext Friday again. I was extremely happy in school, learning about Zionism, learning about --\nabout Jewish religion, and developing an extremely fond love for the Jewish people. The city --\nthe cultural life in the city was on a very high level. There was a Jewish theater, there was a\nJewish newspaper. There was a voluntary symphony orchestra. There was a -- was a big library.\nAnd there were sports clubs, and we always were trying to participate in the sport events. The\ncommunity, however, was divided. There were people who belonged to a very radical Zionist\nmovement, the Zhabotinsky movement. And there were again [indecipherable] especially where\nsome of my friends belonged to a socialist Zionist movement. And in the middle there was the\nmean, mean Zionist. People who did not try to define themselves as -- as right wingers or left\nwingers. The Orthodox community was also divided. There were strictly Orthodox groups, and\nthen there were groups that did not only believe that prayer is the answer to our problems, but\nforming or creating, or returning to our ancient homeland is extremely important. My two sisters\nbelonged to that general Zionist organization, and I, as a young man, felt that perhaps the\nZortinsky movement, the movement that was teaching us to go and move to it -- to Israel and\nfight, I felt at that time that this is the only solution. In my town, I did not feel any anti-Semitism\nwhen I grew up, because there were not too many Gentiles in town, and there was no contact\nwhatsoever between the Jewish community and the Christian community. We lived separate --\nseparate lives, not mingling with each other. I remember my teachers were -- who I liked very,\nvery much, they really cared. I remember my uncles, merchants and [indecipherable], aunts that -\n- more pious than their husbands. School friends who were bookworms, and others who really\ndidn\u2019t care. But the discussions among all those groups were very heated. We really believed in\nour cause, and tried to convince those others to join us. We did not have any luck. They were\nalso convinced in their just cause. There was a communist movement in town. Their aim was to\nmove to Soviet Union, create a state there.

        "A: We were getting together sometimes in the evenings, but mostly Saturdays afternoon,\ndiscussing events in the Jewish world, expressing our opinion, and participating in all events that\nwere taking place in our town, whenever somebody came to our town to speak to us. Those were\nreally wonderful years, really wonderful years. My two sisters did belong to the general Zionist\norganization. And I\u2019m not sure that I remember, but it seems to me that m-mostly -- my\norganization, there were mostly men. I don\u2019t remember any women in my organization.

        "A: My father and my mother were very tolerant people, and they felt that if this 1s what I would\nlike to do, this is the organization that I would like to belong to, they will not interfere. They will\nnot interfere, as long as it is a Zionist organization. Did my uncles, who were very pious people\nobject to it? I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. They actually also belong to -- to radical Zionist\norganizations.",
        "A: The goal was, first of all, as long as we cannot move to Israel, to develop a strong sense of\nJewish identity, reinforcing the feelings that we had in school, reinforcing it in such a way that --\nthat we were more free to discuss things. And I don\u2019t [indecipherable] discussing events and\nproblems that are taking place not only in Poland, but all over the world. We used to get\nnewspapers, discuss articles, have -- have opinions. And all of 1t was very exciting.

        "A: Ye -- yes, yes. I know that some of my friends who still live in Israel came in 1936 or 1937 as\nillegal immigrants, being brought into Israel in a very clandestine way. I\u2019m asking myself why\ndidn\u2019t I go. It\u2019s a very painful question. Perhaps even though I felt that this is the only way, and\nto feel that way, you have to have courage. Could be that I did not have the courage to go along\nwith, being 17 or 18 years old and start a life on my own. My family was a very close family,\nand I never developed a feeling that I can be alone. And that prevented me from making that\nfateful decision. In hindsight of course, I would have been much better off, and perhaps that\nbothers me, and perhaps convince my two sisters after I will be there, that they should do the\nsame thing. It bothers me. On the other hand I have doubts that my sisters would leave our\nparents alone. They were not young any more, and I am not sure that they would have accept this\nidea of going to Israel, and abandoning -- I\u2019m using that word because this is the way they felt\nprobably, abandoning our parents. My two sisters, if we can go to a different topic, joined me in\nKrakow when I went to the university in 19 - nine -- 1936. In 1937 they joined me. I was\ntransferring to the business academy. I went to the university only to be able to get into medical\nschool. But the quota was very low and I didn't make it. I transferred to the business academy\nand my si -- two sisters came to Krakow to study. But at the same time, I\u2019m not proud of myself,\nI\u2019m proud of my youngest sister. We made a deal, all three of us, that every Friday one of us\nwould go and spend the -- the weekend of the Shabbat with our parents. My youngest sister\nnever failed to go. I had sometimes a -- an event that I wanted to attend in Krakow, sports event\nor cultural event. On Friday morning I was turning to my youngest sister and tell Rushka, I am\nnot going. It is my turn but I am not going, you better go. And she always went there. She never\nleft my parents alone.",
        "A: My father was a merchant. My moth -- mother was a housewife, like in every Jewish family\nat that time, maybe even every Christian family. We had our store and building that my father\nbuilt in 1929. We lived on the first floor and there were three floors above us. Was a very, very\ncapable man, even though he grew up without his parents. He was a self taught individual who\ncared very much about the family. I was very close to him. My father, even though he had very\nlittle schooling, became in that city of 31,000 Jews, the vice president of [indecipherable] you\ncan call it today the federation, or whatever you want to. That was very unusual because every\ntwo years were elections. This was not an appointed position, you had to win the election to -- to\n-- to be part of it. He won every election as long as -- as much as I remember. He had a very\nwonderful way of dealing with people, and my father became the [indecipherable] a\nrepresentative of a big, big manufacturing firm in Lodz, and if people that are buying anything\nthat were produced by that -- that manufacturing outfit, they had to come to us. And I also\nremember the recession. My father just finished building the house and all of a sudden it became\nvery, very difficult to accept the fact that people are not paying their bills. And please understand\nthat in most of the businesses, people were buying and mi -- and signing a note. And my father\n[indecipherable] those notes in the bank, all of a sudden he confronted the fact that they\u2019re not\npaying their notes, and he has to -- he has to redeem those notes. It was a very difficult time\nbecause he locked himself in one of the rooms, and did not want to listen to anybody. But as I\ntold you, my father grew up as an orphan, and he had the -- he had three brothers and two sisters.\nThe older brother raised the family, and was a very wise man but lived in a different city, about\n15 or 20 kilometers from u -- from Bendezin. And he came and stayed with my father for a long\ntime and convince him that not everything is lost, and you should get in touch with this -- with\nthat manufacturer in Lodz and see if they will help him. And that what happened. They came and\nthey bailed out my father, who later on, of course, became again a very, very successful\nbusinessman. And those were times that were really threatening. We -- we felt that perhaps we\nhave to -- we have to leave school, and that was to me, to my sisters, unacceptable. But thank\nGod for my uncle, and that -- that manufacturing company in -- in ro -- in -- in Lodz that saved\nus and our family.\nBeginning Tape Two",

        "A: Very good question. We had in the city two old age homes. The people couldn\u2019t afford to stay\nhome, they came and lived in those two age -- two old age homes, supported by the community.\nWe had also a very beautiful home for orphans, there were a lot of orphans. My mother spent\nmost of her time volunteering in those old age homes, and in the orphan home. And she derived a\nlot of satisfaction from that. On top of it, from time to time I used to see her in the store, helping\nmy father. And -- I was thinking of cooking, but it is not correct because we had a maid that was\nwith us for many, many years. And she -- my two sisters and I, when we\u2019re youngsters, were\nmore afraid of her than of my mother. She was a strict disciplinarian. We were afraid but we\nliked her very much because we probably realized that she is trying to do her best to -- to make\nus avoid getting in trouble. She was a Polish woman, and came during the war asking my parents\nto move. I as -- I tried many, many times to remember why my parents rejected the idea. I wish\nthey would have accepted the idea. But there must have been some reason why they rejected the\nidea. After the war, I met a neighbor of ours who survived in hiding, the age of my parents. They\ntold me, they were convinced that on the same street, my parents are hiding with that lady that\nworked for us. But it is a mystery to me why they rejected to go into hiding. And sometimes I\nfeel -- I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m justified feeling that way, that they did not want to leave us alone, we\nwere youngsters still. And sometimes I do believe, especially my father, who could not -- who\ncould not perceive that people are going to be killed. He somehow looked at the German nation\nwith admiration for their accomplishments, and he couldn\u2019t visualize, probably -- and I am\nguessing just -- that those people who he is holding in high esteem, who gave us Beethoven and\nBach and Dieter and Schiller and Mendelssohn, are capable of committing such crimes, such\nheinous crimes. And he felt the war will end and on the [indecipherable] but I\u2019m guessing, just.\nBut he -- if he will go into hiding and we be discovered, he\u2019Il be shot. Am I sure about it? No,\nI\u2019m not. But I was thinking many times about it, and those thoughts crossed my mind. I wish\nthey would have listened to her. She was a wonderful woman, but it\u2019s water over the dam.

        "A: We -- I mean, my sisters and I were communicating in Polish. But my father was a Yiddishist,\nand there was a newspaper in Warsaw by the name of Hient, on a very, very high level. I always\ncompare it with the New York Times today. And we were getting that paper every day, a\nYiddish paper, and if during the luncheon my two sisters and I did not know what a very famous\njournalist was writing today in the paper -- his name was Margoshis, my father used to be very,\nvery upset with us. And he enjoyed having those discussions in that -- at the table in the Yiddish\nlanguage. There is [indecipherable] something that I will never forget. My youngest sister, before\ngoing in the room for lunch was telling around to me always, Sigmund, did you read Margoshis\u2019\ncolumn today? You told me what it was. Sorry.",
        "A: Yes. We were glued to the radios, listening to his speeches, and we were frightened. But at\nthe same time I do remember that there was a feeling among a lot of people that he is talking\nabout it only in order to gain power, and to exercise power. But perhaps it\u2019s empty talk. And still\nwe were frightened. Now of course, on the first of September 1939, when they came to town, we\nimmediately realized that it is not just talk. There were two events the first two days of -- after\nthey came to town that I will never forget. One were a family by the name of Schlesinger, father\nand two sons, running to the synagogue to rescue the Torah scrolls -- from the burning\nsynagogue, the Germans put fire on -- on it -- burned the synagogue. They were able to run in\nand bring out two Torahs. When they emerged from the burning synagogue, the Nazis shot them\non the spot. That was one event that of course frightened us. The second, han -- in hindsight, it\nwas a policy probably, to frighten the people. On the second or third, or fourth day, and I don\u2019t\nremember any more, they came to -- to -- they entered homes and took out some leaders. And I\ndon\u2019t remember -- remember today how many, but must have been at least five or six, and\nhanged them in the middle of the market. For nothing. For the fact that they were Jewish. That\nfrightened us quite a bit, quite a bit. The people were really naive in \u201939. They lived during the\nfirst World War, and they felt it\u2019s going to be a static war. And what my parents did is to move\npart of the business to a town by the name of Jarolsitsa around 30 or 40 kilometers from my\ntown, believing that the war will not -- that the Germans will not come as far, and they will\nsurvive and return. Of course, it turned out to be an illusion, and my sisters and I were -- were in\nthe -- together with my parents in that town, that all of a sudden you realize that the ger --\nGermans are moving very fast. And the young people were trying to hitchhike and go east after\nlearning that the Soviet Union have entered the war, and occupying east of Poland. We strongly\nbelieved that we can survive there. I was one of them, and my sisters did not join me. Again, I\nwas thinking why, why did it happen. And then I remember -- I -- I remembered that -- that in all\nthose seven or eight or nine days that it took me to hitchhike to eastern Poland to the city of\nLvov, I don\u2019t remember seeing on the roads -- the roads were crowded -- too many young ladies,\ntoo many young women walking and trying to hitchhike and -- to the eastern part of Poland.\nWhy? I don\u2019t have really a good answer. I don\u2019t know why, but those were the facts.",
        "A: How it looked like?",
        "A: We were at the windows. They came in in tanks, just shooting around indiscriminately. We\nare afraid to leave the home -- our houses. And then, I remember the ger -- Germans breaking\ninto stores, taking whatever they wanted as though it\u2019s -- it\u2019s theirs. Breaking into homes, and\ntaking paintings or whatever they found, and cutting it away. Of course, that was really\nfrightening, our age, to understand that people can come -- just come in and take away something\nthat my father worked all his life, without any -- any consideration about anything. Was perhaps\na moment when we felt that life will not be the same any more, that life has changed. I also\nremember that when they ever -- when they saw a Jew on the streets with a beard, they were\ncutting it off, and laughing, and kicking people. I don\u2019t remember all those -- all the time that\nthey occupied Bendezin [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t remember to confront or being confronted by a\nGerman who showed sympathy for us, or gave us a piece of bread, even though my wife\nremembers that there was a German in Krakow who helped her. But I don\u2019t remember. All my\nanger at the German people blocks my -- my willingness to accept there could have been a good\nGerman. Of course I changed my mind lately. But that could have been behind me not\nremembering that there were at least one German who tried to show sympathy or tried to help.",
        "A: Oh no, we did not have any comfort of the youth group any more, everything was -- came to a\nstandstill. In the first few days I stayed home, but I went with my parents to the city of Jarolsitsa,\nwhere as I told you before I was hitchhiking to the -- to eastern -- to eastern Poland. But after\nbeing in Lvov, and I don\u2019t remember, three or four months, my father sent a mi -- a mis -- an\nemissary to tell me that I should return home, that things have calmed down and life is almost\nnormal. My faith in the wisdom of my father was absolutely boundless. I went back. I had a\ndifficult trip. I was on the floor -- 1-1n the city of [indecipherable] that were only about 10 miles\nfrom my town, on the floor of the railroad station. They run -- came running in, trying to find\nJews and drag them out. I was on -- I was somehow lying between two or three Gentiles and they\nmissed me. Within the next day or two days later, I came to town. As I told you, my father was a\n-- was the vice-president of [indecipherable] and he were very close to a -- to young people that\nwere in town form -- they formed a kibbutz that they were together trying to emigrate to Israel,\nwaiting for certificates to Israel. And they were -- they were involved in -- in -- in producing -- in\n-- in -- in planting, I\u2019m sorry, not producing, planting food, potatoes and tomatoes. And that was\nvery important and my father, on behalf of the Judenrat, this is the way they called that\nfederation that I mentioned before, was supervising that kibbutz. I was -- my father brought me\nin and I stayed for awhile, also helping. And then something very unusual happened. I got hold\nof a book with certain laws that the German observe, and I notice that there is a law saying that\npeople who work in defense industries -- and we had three enterprises working for German\ndefense industry in town, they\u2019re entitled to additional meat. They call them sverarbeiter, people\nwho work hard. I took advantage of the law. I went to the authorities and I was successful to\nconvince them that those people over there are entitled to more meat. And I used to get every\nweek meat designated for them. There was a sausage factory in town [indecipherable] in the\nnearer -- neighbor town -- neighboring town, Sosnowiec, where we worked hard and produced\nsausages. Of course it was much easier to distribute sausages and to cut meat for [indecipherable]\nand this is where I worked from 1940 or \u201941, until deportation of the -- in sep -- August of 1939 -\n- 1943.",

The soldiers,\nthe Russian soldiers were absolutely obsessed with getting a watch, getting watches. This was\ntheir mean -- mean d-desire, to get watches. I used to go out and try to find out who wants to sell\na watch and sell it to them and buy food. This is the way I lived for the -- for those three or four\nmonths.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I was much more comfortable until all of a sudden the Russians were transporting\nmy friends to Siberia. And -- and that bothered me. I thought they might be able to come and\npick me up, too. And as I said to you before, when my father sent somebody to convince me to\ngo back, and I said to you that I had boundless faith in the wisdom of my father, sitting here just\nnow, I also believe that I was afraid, especially that I came from a family that was a wealthy\nfamily, that I would end up in Siberia. It was hard to realizing what to expect home.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: As a matter of fact it did not. Life all of a sudden became semi-normal. The Germans putting\nmen, they called them the [indecipherable] who was now [indecipherable] together with my\nfather. Not giving anything to us, not -- being guided by my father. And we -- life became semi-\nnormal. We were walking the streets. I am not sure that I remember if our youth group met. I had\ndoubts about -- I have doubts about it. But people worked, as I told you in those defense\nfactories, and the illusion that we will survive the war became much stronger. That was 1940 -\n\"41. And furthermore, young people were -- were taken away by the Germans to Germany to\nwork there. And here the -- the image of the man who was in charge of all those communities, all\nthose Jewish communities, a man by the name of Merin, M-e-r-i-n -- perhaps was a visionary.\nPerhaps in this -- that feeling came to me only after the war, because during war I was very\nunhappy with the fact that he is cooperating with the Germans. But he understood that people\nwho work are being sent to Germany to help in their defense industry, may have a much better\nchance than others. Even though I remember discussions in our groups at that time, quoting a\nvery fa -- very, very famous saying of the philo -- Jewish philosopher Maimonides, that if the\nenemy comes, and he is asking to hand him o -- hand them over one person that they are going to\nkill, the community should never accept it. Yes, we should all -- all of us should go. But Merin\nfelt -- felt differently. He felt on the contrary that this cooperation with the Germans and imbu --\nimbued young people -- not imbued them, but forcing young people to -- to accept the fact that\nthey are going to be deported, and they are going to be working in Germany, was perhaps a very\ngood idea. Most of them, most of them survived the war. [indecipherable] the war, we young\npeople couldn\u2019t accept his decisions of cooperation with the enemy. On the other hand, again in\nhindsight, they had -- if he would not have, the Germans would have taken over everything and\nmassacred us, like they did later on when they invaded the Soviet Union in June of 1942. They\ncame to towns and just took out people and killed them, massacred. And maybe we avoided that\nfate. Maybe. But of course, that he will found that he has a good relationship with the Gestapo,\nand he can do many things. But again, misleading people. He couldn\u2019t -- yes, he could get\nsomebody out of a transport to Germany, but he was really fulfilling their wishes. If he had not\nhave done it, would there be other people in town who would have taken over the function?\nPerhaps. I don\u2019t condemn him any more like I used to during the war, and immediately after the\nend of the war. He fulfilled a certain function in the life of the Jewish people in Bendezin,\nSosnowiec and [indecipherable]",

How\nhe emerged as a leader in 1939 is to me a mystery. Maybe there are others who lived closer to\nhim. Maybe they know the answers. I am unable to remember and tell you why he emerged as a\nleader of the Jewish [indecipherable]. He was not elected, of course, there were no elections.\nSomething must have happened that the Germans either agreed or appointed him to be the head\nof the Jewish [indecipherable]. Not only the Jewish community in his town, Sosnowiec, it was\nthis -- it had a -- probably the same [indecipherable] we had probably between 30 or 31,000 Jews\nand next town [indecipherable] other small surrounding towns.

No. No, it is not.\nBut he may have thought, as I said before, that we are going to be exposed to massacres, that\nnobody will survive. Those are feelings that I had after the war, not during the war. There were\nother leaders in Poland that took upon themselves to cooperate and save. Perhaps under the\nillusion that time is -- will be on our side, if we will drag it out, the war will come to an end. Of\ncourse, that was an e -- just an illusion.

        "A: I don\u2019t remember any specific discussions, but a lot of people in town were building hiding\nplaces in the basements that were really difficult to discover. And by -- and my father, of course,\nbuilt such a place in our home. No, he build that place of hiding only after they brought us into\nthe ghetto. In our home he did not, but after they brought us into the ghetto, he build a place of\nhiding. And that was perhaps the best indication how bad the situation is.",
        "A: The place -- yeah, the place was in our basement, and the entrance for the -- to the -- to the\nhiding place was -- was -- was done in a way to disguise it, how? By putting a -- putting a big\ncredenza, or whatever you call it at that time to hide the entrance. And there were no signs, if I\nremember correctly that there is a [indecipherable] even if you moved out the -- the -- the\nfurniture that was there. At the same time, the Germans learned, especially in homes of more\nimportant people that they build hiding places in there, and they found most of them, or all of\nthem. It was again only another illusion. But you have to live with illusions in times like this.\nLife becomes unbearable if you don\u2019t have any illusions. We lost faith, we lost confidence, but if\nyou lose illusions too, then -- then you are hopelessly paralyzed.",
        "A: We lost faith in ourselves after they put those yellow bands and wearing that sign Juden. It\nwas difficult for us to understand. If you are referring to faith as faith in God, I am not sure at\nthat point that we lost faith in God. We lost faith in man, but I am not sure that we lost faith in\nGod, but we lost faith after arriving in Auschwitz, completely in God, seeing what is happening.\nAnd there\u2019s a very interesting change of minds among people who arrived in Auschwitz and\nwere my friends or acquaintances. Maybe after the war I understood it. People who were in my\ntown who I knew were very pious people, very pious people. [indecipherable] starting to\nchallenge God, mocking. Maybe mocking 1s a too strong word. And on the contrary, my friends\nwho are atheists in town, who belonged as I told you before to that left wing organization and\ncommunists -- I\u2019m not sure about communist, but who belo -- belonged to the left wing\norganizations, and were atheists, all of a sudden became belie -- they became believers. Why?\nAnd again, after analyzing it, I have one answer. Here I have an answer. I think that the atheists\nbecame more believing, blaming themselves for creating that situation and forcing the wrath of\nGod. And the other group, the religious group couldn\u2019t understand that God is not interfering.\nThey learned in Jewish history that God interfered in many instances in Egypt or -- or Persia,\nwhatever. Why is He all of a sudden becoming invisible. Why is he not interfering? Seeing small\nchildren that are innocent being thrown into the fire. If I am innocent -- if I am guilty, fine. But\nhow can you permit small children being th-thrown into the fire? But again, a change happened\nin me too, later on. I realized that without faith in God, or faith in a human -- in entity that 1s --\nthat is managing the world, it\u2019s very difficult for this, very difficult for this.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",

Maybe because my town was incorporated into Germany,\nand the others were in Poland, were the -- where they could -- where there were no publicity.\nEven though there were no publicity, nobody really was trying to inform the western world at\nthat time what is happening. But the fact that we were incorporated into Germany must have\nbeen a factor, that we were living to the ghetto only at the end of \u201942, and perhaps even ni --\nperhaps -- perhaps not in 42, but in \u00b043.

But again, I remember people who were -- who were terribly\ndisposed to Merin, saying that he is avoiding it, that he 1s trying to avoid, the he is trying to\nconvince them not to -- not to deport us into a ghetto. Did he have so much power? I doubt it\nvery, very much. I doubt it very, very much. But people -- some people believed in his good\nrelationship with the Gestapo and that we can avoid it. But the decisions were not of local\nGestapo people or even district Gestapo people. Decisions were made in Berlin. They get -- they\ngot the -- got the letter, or whatever. Building has to be a ghetto by the first of June or whatever\nit is. And they were just fulfilling the wishes of the main authorities in Berlin. So I have doubt\nthat he could influence local authorities to postpone it. They would have been probably put into\njail or killed, you know, there was no ob -- not obeying.

If they are creating or building ghettos, they are not going to take us to annihilation\ncamps. And that was a comforting -- comforting th-thought. But again, an 1l-illusion.",
        "A: I would say that in \u201943, we knew, much more than in \u201942.

But there was one -- one event. One of the people who were in the train to Auschwitz\nfrom my town, were able before the train stopped in Birkenau to jump out of the train and made\nit back to town. And he came back and he was telling everybody that -- what happened, and that\nwe are going to be all of us shipped to Birkenau and that we will not survive. That was a warning\nthat came very late, must have been \u201943, maybe June or July of \u201943. But what could we have\ndone? We were dealing -- or living in a country with a population who are very hostile to us.\nWhen I say the population, I am referring perhaps to about, I don\u2019t know, I will guess 85 - 90\npercent of the people very hostile to us. They were taking some money, promising to -- to sell\nout -- bring out guns, never happened. They were denouncing us, pointing out to Germans if they\nsaw somebody who looked like Jewish and was trying to -- to go to -- to another town without\nthat yellow band.

It was complete chaos. Mothers looking for children, and we looking for\nour fathers. It was complete chaos. Cha-Chaos designed by it -- wha -- by th -- what -- chaos --\ndesigned chaos is what I wanted to say. I jumped out of the train too, and I was brought before\nthat SS officer, like everyone. And I saw that he 1s -- he 1s directing people to the right and to the\nleft, to the right, women with children, older people. To the left, young people. At that point I\nrealize that what is going to happen to those older people and children is immediate death. And\nI'll never forget that. There were inmates that were coordinating everything. A [indecipherable]\ninmate walked over to us and we said to him, \u201cWhere are those older people going?\u201d He pointed\nout to the chimney and said, \u201cYou see? See that smoke coming out from both chimneys? Those -\n- in that smoke your parents will be in, and the children and older people.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe it,\neven though I knew. But I couldn\u2019t believe that this is happening in such a way, so fast. Why\ndidn\u2019t I believe it? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Of course, two or three years later, when I\nrealized that they did not mislead us, that this is what\u2019s happened. I was [indecipherable] to a\nbarrack with people from my town, but before coming to the barrack they brought us to a place\nwhere we were tattooed, taking away everything and giving us those concentration camp\nuniforms. And marching us to the --\nEnd of Tape Five\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "A: Yeah, in the evening we got a piece of bread and a -- and a soup. We were at that time already\nvery, very hungry. And I stayed in that part of the camp either two or three weeks. Then we were\nbrought into another part of the camp. And in the morning -- in that first camp we did not work\nat all. In the morning they were dri -- you were driven outside and standing there for sometimes\ntwo, sometimes three hours before they led us into our units to work. I was assigned to a unit\nwhere we were trying to clear weeds on the river, the Vistula River. It was so difficult. We were\nstanding in the water, hungry. And in the evening we returned, waiting for that piece of bread\nand soup. And I made at that point that -- a decision that I\u2019m going only to eat the soup and keep\nthe piece of bread for next day. That was of help. I worked, and I don\u2019t remember again, several\nweeks, or maybe only two weeks. And luck started to play an important role in my life. The\nGermans established a group of tailors all -- established tailors who were -- who were mending\nuniforms, correcting uniforms and -- I mean, fixing uniforms. And sometimes bringing in certain\nitems that they took away from survivors, like shirts and shoes and if they were in good shape, or\nthey needed a little mending we did it. And trucks were coming once a week or twice a week and\ncarted away those -- that good stuff. I suppose they -- I suppose or I am almost sure that they\ntook it to Germany because -- because consumer goods were not available, not too much was\navailable. People could not, during the war, go out and buy new shoes or -- or had difficulties\nreplacing the worn jackets or shirts. And a cousin of mine was a tailor before the war. He was\nable to bring me in into that group. So I was relieved from being on the outside -- outdo -- being\noutdoors and being under a roof all day long. He was helping me in that production 60 or 70\npercent because I wa -- I did not know what to do, but he was -- everybody had to fulfill a certain\nquota, he was doing it for me with his brother. But I guess the -- the kapo, after awhile, realized\nwhat is happening and he was singling me out many days and kicking me and hitting me. But\ninteresting, he did not -- he did not remove me. He did not remove me, I still stayed under roof,\nand --",
        "A: Under the -- under a roof.",
        "A: I -- I didn\u2019t say it correctly?",
        "A: Und -- under --",
        "A: It was under a roof.",
        "A: In -- in closed surroundings, in a building, not exposed to nature. That was going on for\nawhile, but then for certain reasons, they closed that place. And I was again -- that must have\nbeen already in \u00b044, either February or March \u201944. I was distressed, but I know that they are\ngoing to assign me to another commando. Walking in Birkenau, all of a sudden, a man turns\naround to me and saying to me, \u201cAre you Herman Strochlitz\u2019 son?\u201d I said yes. \u201cI was a friend of\nyour father. What are you doing?\u201d I told him the story, that I\u2019m going to be assigned to another\ncommando in the morning, that don\u2019t know where I might go assign -- be -- where I will be\nassigned to. He said, \u201cListen to me something. I am working in the berklidinkskomer.\u201d That was\nan outfit that was sorting out everything, and responsible for giving survivors if they came in,\nand they really needed very badly to [indecipherable] we had a cruel kapo, he never gave\nanything to anybody. But again I was under roof, and what was more important was the fact that\nI had smuggled out a pair of shoes and give it to the people who work in the kitchen and they, in\nturn, gave me a piece of bread. And that was extremely important. I was in that commando for a\nlong time. But again, luck, what happened? One day a Pole came in, and -- who was bleeding,\nhis feet -- didn\u2019t have any shoes at all, and asked the kapo to give him a pair of shoes. The kapo\nthrew him out. You know, it\u2019s interesting that those kapos were very eager to hit or to abuse\npeople who in their eyes are weak. Let me finish this guy. I was able to throw out a pair of shoes.\nThe door was open because he threw him out, and he was sitting not far from the door, I was able\nto throw out a pair of shoes. Those shoes were my salvation, and I'll tell you what happened.\nWhat happened was that I was shipped or deported to -- first to Stutthof, the camp in northern --\nnorth -- north -- north Germany, where we stayed, my friend and I with whom I survived\nAuschwitz [indecipherable], and with whom I was very close, stayed in Stutthof, and I don\u2019t\nremember if a week or two weeks. It\u2019s always a mystery to me why they moved us around back\nand forth. They shipped us to another camp, Hiflingen. We also stayed there for a short period of\ntime, and in Hiflingen, the head of the SS walked on the end, we were standing still, he looked at\nme and pulled me out and say, \u201cYou are staying in the barracks, you don\u2019t have to go to work. I\nwill tell you what you are going to do. If people come in and say to you they are sick, if you have\nanything to give them, give them, but if not, tell them we have nothing to give them.\u201d He brought\na -- a bottle of aspirins after a day or two. That was -- that\u2019s the o-on thing -- the only thing that I\nhad was that one bottle of aspirins. But again, I was protected because I was inside. Maybe the\nwork inside is better than under roof. After awhile we were shipped, my friend and I, to another\ncamp [indecipherable]. We were shipped to that camp, and we were assigned to a commando, it\nwas already probably February, or January or February 1945. It was in s -- in the south of\nGermany. The weather was miserable, absolutely miserable. Snow and rain and cold. We were\nassigned to a commando that was going on every day and time to divide rocks, you know? Why\nthey needed it, a mystery to me. We were all day long standing and hitting rocks, hitting rocks.\nAfter one or two days, my friend was a little older than I was, and very wise. He was able, in\nAuschwitz -- yes, in Birkenau to take with him a razor. We hardly made it back, we couldn\u2019t\nwalk, we hardly made it back to camp. And he said to me, \u201cSig, there\u2019s no way we will survive\none day, what 1s the difference? Let\u2019s finish it tonight.\u201d I walked in, I saw the doc -- the man that\nI gave the pair of shoes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. He winked as he recognizes me, but he\u2019s -- I saw that he has an armband as a doctor, so I\nrealize that he is a doctor in camp. Couldn\u2019t help too much as a doctor because [indecipherable]\nmedicine. After we came to our barracks, I went to see him. This is exactly what he said to me,\n\u201cLook sir, I cannot help you with bread, because all of us are getting one portion of bread. But\none thing I can do for you. I can convince SS men with whom I am friendly to let you stay\ninside, not to go out.\u201d And here I said something and I did something, very, very proud of. Very\nproud. And here I had courage. I told him, I am very grateful to you, but I will not stay inside if\nyou cannot -- if you cannot do the same thing for my friend. He threw me out and shouting to\nme, \u201cHere everyone has to survive. What are you going to gain? You\u2019re not going to sur -- both\nof you aren\u2019t going to dri -- I cannot do more. I cannot do -- I cannot save your friend, too.\u201d In\nthe morning he walked in and they called my number, 132407 out. Iam not moving. A second,\nor couple seconds later, I see the doctor whispering something to this SS man, he called my\nfriend\u2019s name. And we were inside til about the middle of March if I remember correctly, we\nwere shipped to Bergen-Belsen. I have to go back a little bit.",
        "A: Romek Vineweich. I have to back up a little bit.",
        "A: Yes. For a short period of time, I was working -- September or was it 19 -- oh, it couldn\u2019t be\nthat. No. In -- in -- no, 1t must have been \u00b043, and I\u2019m working in a commando of -- only for a\nshort period of time, where a transport came from Krakow. And I was working there with my\nfriend, and a woman ap -- we approached some -- some people who came from Krakow to find\nout what they know. Then, we always ask people who came in later what they know what is\nhappening. And I said to one of them, \u201cAnd you are from Krakow? What is your name?\u201d\nGreenberg, she said. I said to her, \u201cWha -- did you have any family in my town?\u201d She said, \u201cYes,\nI had an uncle by the name of Bookwhites.\u201d A very prominent family. I said to her, \u201cYou know,\nyour cousin is working in a commando where she can send you some -- some clothes. I will get\nin touch with her.\u201d So people who are working in that camp with that -- where they were\nworking on clothing. \u201cI will try to get you something.\u201d And I did, I got her some clothes. And we\nspoke two or three times again probably, and I lost track of her. When we came to Bergen-\nBelsen, my friend Romek Vineweich, who was standing once at the -- at the -- at the wires -- at\nelectric wires -- I forgot [indecipherable] and he noticed her, and he noticed that she is dressed\nwell. He started to shout to her and the first question she said to him is, \u201cIs Sigmund here?\u201d He\nsaid yes. She said to him, \u201cLook, I am the schreiberin in -- in camp. That means I have to report\nevery day in the morning how many people died during the night and how many are still alive.\nBut I have access to food because of it.\u201d This -- you know, they don\u2019t know, the Germans if\nduring the night 200 people died or 50 people died. They have a little [indecipherable]. \u201cI will\narrange that he has to come because we need here certain materials that only the men\u2019s camp\nhave, and he will come with some -- some -- with a big glass, or something like -- big -- some\ncontainer.\u201d Oh, that\u2019s better. \u201cAnd I will give you -- give him food.\u201d And that what happened.\nAnd I was going to her every two days or three days and she give us food. And what is even\nequally important, she became my wife. I said equally important, that\u2019s more important. Have to\ncorrect myself. Much more important.",
        "A: Her -- her name is -- is Rushka. Rose we call her here, Rose -- Rose Strochlitz, but her\nmaiden name is Greenberg.",
        "A: Yes. You know, I don\u2019t want to forget it. I mentioned before that I ha -- I was guided, or had\nconfidence in instincts. What did I mean? There were, in Auschwitz, every few weeks or a\nmonth or two months, selections. And even though we\u2019re young people, again they looked at\ntheir faces because they were exhausted or -- for the gas chambers. And we never knew, because\nit\u2019s the same young people, if the left is good or the right is good. And we were pushed to the left\nor to the right, I don\u2019t remember. After a minute I turned around to Romek, and I said, \u201cLet\u2019s see\nif we can go better to the left. I somehow don\u2019t feel right here. I don\u2019t know what it is, but I feel\nthat this is no good here. I don\u2019t why I feel that, or I think that way. Let\u2019s move to the left, not to\nthe right. Let\u2019s try to -- to smuggle ourself to the left.\u201d I was right.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: He went to the same gymnasium that I did, but he was five or six years older. He came, not in\n43. He was 1n hiding, and they brought him in 1944. And they assigned him to the same\nbarracks, and I got attached to him and he to me. Why? Who knows? Attached very much so.\nAnd who knows why? He was protecting me all the time and I was protecting him. In Hilflingin,\non that camp, I was kept inside. I had -- I could get more bread. I never ate it until he came.\nYeah, I ate my portion, I always kept the second portion -- and I was hungry -- for him. He has\ndescribed that relationship [indecipherable] 1946, he described it in an article that he wrote for an\nIsraeli newspaper, and to my great regrets, I was looking for that article many times and I cannot\nfind it.",
        "A: No. We didn\u2019t know it was going to happen. We knew only from the statement made by one\nof the inmates that those who were the people and the children are going -- th-they showed us\nthese chimneys, you see that smoke coming out. But we did not know. But the fact that they\ntattooed us led me to believe that it\u2019s not our end, it\u2019s not my end. Why would they go through\nthe trouble of tattooing us? So it was reassuring. You know [indecipherable] they shaved us\ncompletely. And I walked out and I had problems recognizing my friends and they recognizing\nme. You look so different, you know? You look so different not in your clothes and -- and your\nhead shaved, you know, that it was really difficult to recognize each other.",
        "A: Of my family?",
        "A: You know something? I knew that my family was brought to Birkenau on the third day. Why?\nBecause on that transport were also people who were -- who were not -- who were not sent to --\nto -- to -- to -- to the gas chambers, but to camp, and they told me. No, that is not correct. No,\nthat is not correct. Now I remember a little more. I was trying to find out where\u2019s my family. I\nknow my two young sisters should be in the -- in the camp with all the rest of the women. They\nwere not there. I didn\u2019t count on my parents, but my two sisters. After awhile I found out\nsomething. Found out that there was a young man in the train who had a gun, and he was\nshooting out of the train and he hurt an SS man. And the people were -- who were there when the\ntrain arrived, you know, there were always some sof -- some -- some inmates, you know,\ncoordinating everything, told us that on that day, one train came in that the enti -- there were no\nselections, entire train was taken immediately to the gas chambers. So I found out very early that\nI lost my parents. And because my wife was in the bunker with my parents, she was also taken\nimmediate to -- to the gas chambers.",
        "A: And my two sisters, yes.",
        "A: No. No. Why? I cannot visualize staying -- or saying kaddish in the -- no, I did not. Cannot\nvisualize saying kaddish in the barracks. Why? I really don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know.\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "A: Sitting here I\u2019m thinking why I did not say kaddish. I don\u2019t have any guilt feelings about it,\nbecause I was taught that the prayer of kaddish 1s a reaffirmation of life. Could I at that point re -\n- reaffirm and praise God and reaffirm that life is -- that life is -- 1s -- 1s beautiful, or whatever\nyou want to say? I couldn\u2019t. Did I think at that time, what I\u2019m saying just now? No. But I have to\nanalyze things later on and try to determine in your own mind what was -- what were you\nthinking unconsciously. And I could have thought unconsciously that there\u2019s no reason for me to\nsay kaddish. Am I sure about it? No, I am not. But it could have happened.",
        "A: I know for sure that at that point, I couldn\u2019t believe that there 1s a God, a merciful,\ncompassionate God who let tho -- whose [indecipherable] let things like this happen to his\nchosen people. Difficult to believe.",
        "A: Perhaps no sadness, but anger. Anger. Even though I was not a religious person, I still felt that\n-- that God, or any -- that God could permit those things to take place. So anger was the right\nreaction. And as I said before, it\u2019s very difficult to live without faith. Very, very difficult to live.\nVery difficult to justify things without faith. You must live with faith.",
        "A: Where? In camp?",
        "A: Luck. Luck was my -- my biggest friend. I described to you four situations where luck played\na very important role in surviving. Don\u2019t believe that anybody will tell you -- any of the\nsurvivors will tell you that they were smart, that\u2019s the reason they survived. Oh, that is nonsense.\nLuck, being young, or coming to Auschwitz late, at the end of \u201943 or -- or \u00b044, end of \u201944, not\n\u00b043, where -- where the war was coming -- we knew that the war was coming to an end, and that\nkept you going.",

He was god in that barracks, that\u2019s a ver -- he could kill you or\n-- or deny you the portion of bread, whatever he wanted to do. I never spoke to him, I don\u2019t\nremember his name. He was cold. The Germans had a knack of selecting those -- those -- those\nkapos or people who they felt will fulfill that function that they want them to fulfill. To make our\nlife absolutely miserable, to kill us and to -- to abuse us, all right? They had a knack for choosing\nthose people. It was not only in my barracks, in all the rest of the barracks.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: Yes [indecipherable] he was German. He were a criminal.",
        "A: Yes. I mentioned to you before that that roll call was either five or six o\u2019clock in the morning.\nWe were standing outside for hours, and waiting to go out. And was very difficult, especially in\nthe wintertime. Even though I knew that I will not have to go outside, that I will be able to go\ninto the -- the [indecipherable] and be inside, those two or three hours -- it\u2019s all by -- it was all by\ndesign, because I remember people after an hour or two just giving in, falling down and that\u2019s\nall. They would have died anyway, you know, cause they were already that weak, you know?\nBut even to make the strongest weaker, it was by design.",
        "A: They were trying to -- the reason for that roll call was that they were trying to determine how\nmany people are on the barrack. And that was --",
        "A: We were -- I was standing next to my friend, holding each other up, but no strategy. Don\u2019t\nbelieve that something like this could exist in the camp. What kind of strategy can you have?\nWhat -- what can you do? You are at the whim of people who are -- whose aim is only to kill\nyou. How can you prevent it? You have nothing to -- to defend yourself. You cannot run out\nbecause you are -- you have the electric wires, and it\u2019s powerless, with SS men all over, they will\nshoot you immediately. Even though, I have to be on record that one of my school friends was\nable to run away from Auschwitz, but he\u2019s -- I believe is not the only survivor among the two or\nthree survivors who were able to run away from Birkenau Auschwitz. I can tell you that he lived\nin Israel, and he passed away. We were trying -- every time I came to Israel, all my school\nfriends invited me in. We were spending an evening together reminiscing. We were trying for a\nyear or two to convince him to tell us how he survived. We couldn\u2019t get it. One day -- one\nevening, I turned around to him -- I was very close to him before the war. I said, \u201cShumek, you\nhave to tell us. Just for history\u2019s sake, you have to tell us.\u201d\u201d He was thinking for a moment and he\nsaid okay. I can tell you he was talking for a couple hours. You could cut the air, it was such a\nsilence in the room. And he told us that he had a friend who was working outside the wires, and\nwho hid some clothes for him in a hole, and he described him -- where the hole is. And he will --\nhe will try to get him into that commando to be outside, and then somehow during the day,\nwatching, he should disappear. And he disappeared. And, you know, most of the people that tried\nto run away were hanged the next day. We didn\u2019t -- and we were forced to watch the hanging, of\ncourse. Within a day, two or three, four, they didn't bring him back, I said to myself and to my\nfriend, he escaped. And he told us how he escaped, and what he did. After two days being in that\n-- in that hole -- but he took with him some food, being two days and two nights in that hole, he\nrealized on the third day that the search is off. In the middle of the night he slowly crawled all\nout and went to town. And he saw a light in one of the homes. He entered. He entered and the\nwoman became very scared. He reassured her, and she kept him for another two or three days.\nAnd then he said to her, I have some friends -- again, the woman became his wife later, who are -\n- who look like Aryans not Jews, who are working in Warsaw on false papers. Take me first to\nBendezin. We will sit together, we will look like a -- a son, a mother driving, you know, you\nlook -- nobody will pay any attention to us. And he was successful. She brought him to\nBendezin. In Bendezin he had a friend, a Pole, with whom he was very close. Very unusual to be\nclose, but he was close with him. You -- he came from a very fine family. As a matter of fact, the\nfamily lived in our -- in our house on the second floor. And the son was in town, and they\ndecided, you have to bring him to Warsaw to be -- to -- they will infor -- in Warsaw they will\nfind for him false papers, and he will survive, together with his sisters. With the Pole\u2019s sisters.\nNow, we will survive together with -- with a -- a -- a family that he knew very well, that -- that\nhe knew -- he knew that they are in Warsaw and where they are in Warsaw. That Pole was very\nsmartly shrewd. He took with him on the train, some bottles of liquor. And they were sitting in\nthe train and trying to pretend that they are drinking. SS man came in and he became friend of\nthem, let\u2019s have a drink. They all became drunk and they didn\u2019t realize anything, they were\ndrunk, completely drunk. And they came to Warsaw with him, and found the -- his friends, and\nthey prepared false papers for him, and he was working in a cinema. He didn't look\n[indecipherable], but here is again something that is unexplainable. In the Warsaw ghetto he was\nrounded up with other Poles and taken to a place. He wound up place on the floor. An SS man\nwalks in, and looks around and turns round to him, \u201cYou were the one who run away from\nAuschwitz.\u201d He knew that this is the end. At that moment, and artillery shell 1s exploding in front\nof -- of the place, and everybody is running away in the [indecipherable]. Was he smart? No, was\nluck.",

        "A: The moment I went --",
        "A: Not too bad. Well, I was sitting all day long and being able to -- to -- to -- to -- to -- to -- to\nsmuggle something out again here as I did in the berklidinkskomer, and getting a little bit -- and\ngetting a piece of bread. Was not too bad. I was young. You know, I had typhoid. And again, it\nwill sound too heroic, but I\u2019m going to tell you about. Maybe I should be on record, and maybe\nnot. As I told you, I worked several weeks in a camp where I met my future wife. I worked not\ndoing anything really. But we had to get our food from the kitchen. That was a kitchen run by\nhalf women. The head of that kitchen was a miserable person, and if the commando was --\nconsists of 12 people, she gave only 10 -- 10 pieces of -- something like this, in order to preserve\nand give the SS men [indecipherable]. One day I turned around to the kapo who was the one\nkapo that I know that was not so cruel. Said to him, \u201cLook, today I would like to go with my\nfriend to -- to get our soup.\u201d",
        "A: No, no, no.",

She took that cane an-\nand was standing straight. It\u2019s too heroic, but I have to be on record. She took that cane and she\nlifted it, and was standing straight -- all of a sudden she let it down, and she started to shout,\nclean it up, give him 15. So next day in the morning we are walking again into that camp, she is\nstanding at the gate, and -- with SS man, and the SS man is calling my number out. I said to\nRomek, that\u2019s it. The SS man and -- together with her brought me into the kitchen. And she\nturned around to me and said, \u201cYou are going to work here with me.\u201d I stayed 1n the kitchen with\nher. And when I got the typhoid and my friend also, we knew that they are going to take us to\nthat [indecipherable] that we were going to be one day because after one day there they were\ntaking people to so -- after two days to the gas chambers. I got in touch with her somehow, and I\ntold her what is happening, and if she can get me, not into the [indecipherable], but to the unit on\nsil -- on my block, and I can survive there, because -- and she did it. A day before I left -- before\nthey deported us from Auschwitz she came to the -- to the electric wires, and she threw out a\ngold -- a piece of gold and she said to Romek, \u201cGive it to Sigmund, gold -- this is the only way to\nsurvive.\u201d If you are going to -- you are able to buy something for the gold wherever they were --\nthey\u2019re going to ship you. And it helped. But I have to tell you, again it sounds too heroic, but I\nhave to be on record. She was trying, after the war -- she was a Dutch woman, to get in touch\nwith me. She was sending people and letters. I never responded to any letters of her. I never -- I\nsaid to -- to the people, I will never see her. The fact that she saved me and my friend does not\njustify what she did by causing to have tens or hundreds of people to die by not giving them\nenough food. I never wanted to get in touch with her, and I didn\u2019t. [indecipherable] sound too\nheroic, I was already in love with my future wife.",

        "A: But I never, ever responded to any letter. Never wanted to see her. My friend was one day in\nAmsterdam and he saw her. She was crying bitterly. Why doesn\u2019t -- at least let -- let him answer\na letter? I said no, she is not entitled to it. Does it sound too heroic? No?",
        "A: Yeah, because I was working on their camp.",
        "A: And I could see her, and spend the -- and as a matter of fact, I have already the typhoid and\nshe was able, and -- with the permission of my kapo to let me go into their barracks and not be\noutside to sleep all day. That was of help, too. Again luck played a role.",
        "A: With my wife?",
        "A: Not in camp.",
        "A: Not in camp. But we were liberated together and somehow the fact that she told Romek, is\nSigmund here too, indicated to me that she cares.",
        "A: There was no way out. I knew that I will die the next day or two days later, that we cannot\nwalk even. It was a terrible winter. And I said to myself, or my friend said, why, why, why still\nsuffer? There\u2019s no way out. We cannot walk, even. We cannot walk. We have to all day long try\nto divide those rocks and we cannot do it, so somebody will shoot us anyway there. If an SS man\nwalked by and say we cannot do it, he will shoot us anyhow. What is the use? I am positive that\nwe would have done it. Positive, if not for the doctor. I have no doubts about that, that we would\nhave done it. As I said before, and I hope I\u2019m not offending anybody. There is no way for\nanybody to imagine, or to try to -- to -- to understand the feeling and the mood. It\u2019s impossible.\nIt\u2019s impossible. Only people who were there are able to describe them.

        "A: I'm not sure I understand the question.",
        "A: You see, when could I hear anything? When you are standing at the appelle in the morning,\nwe didn\u2019t talk. Nobody permitted us to talk. When we were coming back in the evening, we are\nso tired. Nobody think -- we li -- nobody was thinking about trying to talk or to -- to be nostalgic.\nNo. We were waiting for the piece of bread, and lie down, that\u2019s all. There was not real talk\nexcept when a new transport came in and we wanted to know what is happening in the world. At\nthat time were talk, and being encouraged, you know\u201d? Believing that the war is coming to an\nend. I remember -- I remember when the allied troops landed in Normandy, and there was a\ntransport, I\u2019d forgot from where. They came and told us that the Americans are in Europe\nalready. And that was very, very reassuring, very. It inspired confidence again that maybe,\nmaybe the tragedy is coming to an end. But to have just -- just empty talk, that was no such\nthing. I don\u2019t remember ever having any empty talk during the appelle, or during -- or after we\ncame ho -- came back from -- from our work assignment. I don\u2019t remember.",

I\ndon\u2019t remember.",
        "A: No. No.",
        "A: The will to survive is a very strong will. The idea that I will survive and tell the world what\nhappened always was a very, very important element in that feeling of survival. And the feeling\nor the statements of those who were taken to the gas chambers, don\u2019t forget us, was also very\nimportant. Don\u2019t forget us. This was also very important to me. And that was kep -- kept me\ngoing. That what kept me going. You are talking about singing, and I would like to share\nsomething that to me was to some extent understandable, and to some extent I couldn't\nunderstand it. The sonderkommando came one day back and they told a story of an old rabbi\nwho was with a group of people taken to the gas chambers, the rabbi started to sing, and asked\nthem all to sing. We are dying as martyrs, and don\u2019t be afraid to die. Singing and dancing before\nthey entered the cha -- the gas chamber. It\u2019s good to be on [indecipherable] like this.",

        "A: Mm, no.",

I don\u2019t remember somebody saying it\ndirectly to me, but I\u2019m sure that there are people who were told by those who were taken to the\ngas chambers, don\u2019t forget me, tell the world what happened. Oh, I am positive about it.",
        "A: We saw the sonderkommando, they were in a special block, every day. And they told us that\nthe people are being taken to showers and telling them they have to be clean, and after they will\ncome out there will be food for them, and misleading them completely. When the entered the\nshowers, of course, an SS man was throwing in a -- a gas can Zyklon B, and they heard in the --\nfor a couple -- for three or four minutes people shouting and then, all of a sudden everything was\nsilent, they opened the doors and everybody was dead, of course, holding to each other, and the\nscene was incredible, they were -- always used to say. Mothers holding children tight to them,\ntheir [indecipherable]. And of course they were immediately -- they were in -- SS men started\nalways to shout at them, take them out and bring them to the -- to the -- to the -- to the chimney,\nthat\u2019s all, or whatever.",

        "A: Yes, washing themselves. We never stopped. But having said that, and I don\u2019t remember why,\nin Bergen-Belsen, or even maybe before, we never had the place where we could wash ourself.\nAnd when I was liberated, they had to use a special oil to clean me. The dirt was in -- in my --\nmy entire body, in -- in -- in my flesh almost, you know? They took a special oil to clean me.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. And that is an indication where we thought we can survive. The clear indication that we\nare young we will survive, as the war is coming to an end. Would I have done the same thing if I\nwould have been taken in the beginning of \u201942? I doubt it, because the situation was so gloomy,\nthe ger -- the Germans were in Moscow almost, in Leningrad, all over the world, you know?\nThere was no reason for me to believe that the German army can be -- can be defeated. There\nwas no reason whatsoever, they -- they occupied all Europe and they are now next to Stalingrad\nand Moscow and Leningrad, and how -- and again, how do we find out? New transports come in.",
        "A: Of course in the evening went -- went again. But during the day, I doubt it very much. I doubt\nit very much. First in Poland, in the place that I was working, inside, there was no rest room.\nThere were no such thing. No.",
        "A: All -- every day, all day long.",
        "A: Every day all day long. You see, and again, probably subconsciously, when you know that\nyou lost everything, that you have no family, you are trying to forge a friendship with somebody\nwho\u2019 ll be with you, giving you the feeling that you are not alone. And that cemented that\nfriendship. I can lean on him, and he on me. He could watch my -- my -- my -- my piece of\nbread, and I can watch his piece of bread. And you are as eager to make sure that he will survive\nas you, and he is eager to make sure that you are s -- you are going to survive. That creates a\nlifetime friendship.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I am not sure about it. I am not sure about that I was thinking at that point of a marriage, but\nthat was unthinkable, incredible, you know? It never entered her mind or my mind. But on the\nfirst day of liberation, I was outside with Romek and we saw her sister. I asked, \u201c\u201cWhere\u2019s\nRushka?\u201d I asked. She said, \u201cWe have to take her from the barracks, she has typhoid, to the\nkrankenhaus.\u201d I said, \u201cI will go.\u201d I will -- I had to crawl before I a -- was able to reach the\nbarrack, she was already taken. I couldn\u2019t walk there at that time too fast, you know, I had to\ncrawl, you know, almost. So I didn\u2019t see her. But I do believe -- I do believe that I saw her in the\nhospital four or five days later. I do believe in that, yes.",
        "A: Oh, of course.",
        "A: I mentioned to you that I had typhoid in Auschwitz. There are two types of typhoids. I had the\nsecond type [indecipherable] had in Bergen-Belsen. My future wife saved me. She was able to\nget hold of some medication and send it over to me. That helped me.",
        "A: Before liberation?",
        "A: I am not sure that I remember when I discovered that I have typhoid.",
        "A: Iam not sure.",
        "A: No, before liberation.",
        "A: Before liberation, but I cannot pinpoint.",
        "A: Because -- because -- because I wa -- it was \u201945, I was exhausted, tired. My weight was 88\npounds at the libera -- on the liberation, 88 pounds. I was weak, extremely weak from all those\nyears. And of course I do believe that on liberation day or two days -- a day later, I -- my typhoid\ndisappeared. But I was extremely weak, weighing 88 pounds.",
        "A: It\u2019s interesting. A day before liberation on April 14, one day before we were liberated, we all\nknew or felt or sensed that the war has come to an end, that we are going to be liberated in a day\nor two. The Germans were in a hurry. We saw it that they are in a hurry, that they are trying to\nescape. And in the morning when we opened our eyes, we saw that the towers are empty, there\nare no SS men any more. And then we heard some shooting, artillery or something like this. In\nan hour or two -- hours later a single tank rolled into the camp. And we heard -- and this was so\nreassuring, y-y-yo -- you are free. We are here liberating you. I saw it, and I think that perhaps I\nwas not sure that this is true, but in another tr -- \u2018nother English tank rolled in and I saw them\ndistributing chocolate to people. That was a terrible mistake, people were dying like flies, taking\ntwo pieces of chocolate, they couldn\u2019t -- their stomachs couldn\u2019t take it, they were dying like\nflies. Again my friend saved me. He did not let me take anything. And here I have to tell you a\nvery interesting moment at night he was afraid that the -- that the hunger will -- will force me to\ngo out and take some food that I cannot digest. He tied his feet with my feet all night long. I\ncouldn't move. He was much more experienced than I. We were -- he tied with a rope my feet to\nhis feet. This is what friendship 1s all about. You care. You care for your friend as much as you\ncare for yourself, or more.",
        "A: Soup.",
        "A: He was constantly saying, take two soups, five soups, as many as you want, but soup, a soup,\na warm soup. And I followed his advice.",
        "A: Something like this.",
        "A: We were -- we were waiting. We knew that we -- we knew that something is happening. We\nwere waiting. We greeted those liberators as though they are angels from heaven. It was a lot of\nexcitement, euphoric. We were all euphoric. But I have to mention here something. That feeling\nof happiness, after awhile, and I cannot pinpoint it to two weeks or four weeks or six weeks,\ncompletely faded away. All of a sudden, most of us es -- I, an-and I would say most of us felt\nthat we cannot return to our homes. We have no families, but all those liberators will go back to\nUnited Kingdom, the United States, and -- and live a normal life, but we are alone.\n[indecipherable] we have to start from the beginning. What will I do? And how will I be able to\ncope with that fact that I am alone, or only with one friend? That was a depressing feeling. Very\nstrong, depressing feeling. And that lasted for awhile. But then, after that Rosensaft organized of\ncom -- organized th-the -- all survivors, we became more active. That feeling was replaced by a\nbelief that we will manage. It was interesting also that most of the survivors, and of course\nincluding me, were trying to get married, to create life again. That was a -- a crucial point in our\nliberation, to prove to the world that we are going to bring life again. And that we will be able to\nfind a place, someplace, where we will be able to restore life. And that what happened really.\nThose who were more courageous than I went to live in Israel. The rest of us went to the United\nStates. And having said that, I must express my feelings here, that people who are born here in\nthe United States don\u2019t appreciate at all what the United States 1s all about. We do. We do. We --\nI am -- I am all for the United States, it\u2019s the greatest country that existed in all s -- all civilized\nlife for the last two or 3000 years. We have to preserve it. Why am I expressing it in such a -- in\nsuch an interview? I guess because I need my children and grandchildren to know how I -- how I\nwas in awe of the United States. Maybe they will understand it too.",
        "A: Icame January 1951.",
        "A: I don\u2019t go to work on that. I stay home, I read hist -- American history or the Bill of Rights, I\ndon\u2019t go to work on that day. This is for me a day of celebration.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t go to work on that day now, it\u2019s a day of celebration and I sit home and I read\nAmerican history or Bill of Rights, whatever -- whatever I can. But I never go to work on that\nday. This is not the way to wor -- not -- is not a day to work. This is a way -- a day to celebrate.",
        "A: Yeah, we were relocated -- the German -- the English army burned the entire camp because it\nwas infested and they had to burn all the barracks. And they transferred us -- they transferred us\nto where -- about three miles from the old barracks and two German military barracks. They\nwere, of course, completely different. We had the very nice room, there were restrooms around.\nAnd I lived, of course, with my friend in that room, and Rose lived with her sister in another\nbuilding not far from that building. I saw her every day, almost every day.\nEnd of Tape Eight\nBeginning Tape Nine",
        "A: Probably at the end of 1940 -- to Rose -- or not to Rose, in December of 1945. December of\n1945, I\u2019m sorry. We have one daughter, and we have adopted three children. One child was the\nchild of Rose\u2019s sister, that she was able after the parents were taken to Auschwitz, Rose was able\nto bring her to a Polish family and she survived with that Polish family. After the war, we\nbrought her back bi -- brought her back to Bergen-Belsen and she lived with us for awhile. But\nthere was a little problem. She was so grateful to that Christian family that she was looking at us\nas people who are trying to take away her religion. And it was very, very difficult. But in 1949,\nRose and I went to Israel. I had some family in Israel from before the war, and Rose had a larger\nfamily, two uncles, and she of course went with us. And here a dramatic change took place. All\nof a sudden she fell in love with the people in Israel and she didn't want to return. She wanted to\nlive her life there. And she lives there, she\u2019s married, she has four children, we have how many\u2019?\nFour, five [inaudible] -- we have nine grandchildren there. No, we have four grandchildren and --\nand how many did I say?",
        "A: Nine or maybe 10 great-grandchildren, you know. And we are very, very attached to each\nother. Wer -- I used to go twice a year with my wife to be with them for six, eight weeks\nsometimes. At least six weeks. And we are, as I said, very close. I love my grandchildren, and I\nlove my great-grandchildren very much. They come to the States and stay with me, and we have\na marvelous time with them. Then, in 1966, something happened. Rose had a cousin in Buenos\nAires in Argentina, and they, husband and wife were involved in a terrible automobile accident\nand got killed. A school friend of mine who lived in Buenos Aires called me up and told me the\nstory and he said, you have to come, because those are two children and nobody knows what to\ndo with them. I will take care of. I went. I spent several weeks in Argentina. I had difficulties\ncommunicating with them, but I was able to get some visas for them to come to the United\nStates. They were tourist visas. They came to the United States and they stayed with me for\nawhile, and even though when I came to Buenos Aires their friends were trying to tell them --\ntheir school friends that I came maybe to take advantage of them. After they came to the States\nand lived with me for a few weeks, I remember taking them to the airport because they had to go\nback to Argentina for me to get permanent visas. They were so afraid that maybe I will not get\nthose permanent visas, they were holding my hand in the airport and I reassured them. And after\n-- and I don\u2019t remember any more, maybe two or three months later, I got the visas and they\ncame to live with us. I love them very dearly. I don\u2019t make any distinction between my daughter\nand the rest of them. And they made me proud of them. One is a professor -- assistant professor\nin Boston. He was first at BU, and now he\u2019s in a different college. And one is a physician in -- in\nNew Britain, who became the chief of neurology in the hospital. And the o -- his brother,\nextremely capable young man, who is -- wrote his story in a very moving way, and who gave us\nthree grandchildren and the -- the younger son gave us also three grandchildren, they come very\noften, but really not often enough and we spend time together. I try to -- to -- to direct them, or to\nshow them the right way of life and I perhaps am successful, perhaps.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I imagine in the beginning that I was reluctant, very much so, for the last 45 or 50 years, to\ntell my story. But I am doing it today for them. They should know the story. They should watch\nit and remember. I did not speak to them enough, or perhaps at all about my life in camps. Now,\nthey will have a record, and to me that is extremely important.",
        "A: To talk to them? I was reluctant to talk to anybody about it in the beginning. The main -- the\nfeeling why not was based on a certain, if not arrogance, but a certain feeling, what am I going to\ntell them, they don\u2019t understand me -- they don\u2019t understand it anyhow. On that feeling\ndisappeared. And as you probably know, I was the national chairman of the Days of\nRemembrance, appointed by President Carter, and then the -- reappointed by President Reagan\nand Bush. I was the chairman of the -- of the -- forgot the name of that committee. Yes, dealing\nwith the [indecipherable] of the future museum. I was a member of the executive board, we\nworked very hard to make sure that the world cannot forget, and I became the national chairman\nof Days of Remembrance. That first year I reported to the council that I was able to convince\nthree governors, the governor of Connecticut, New York and New Jersey to have Days of\nRemembrance in their capitals and invite -- and invite all the [indecipherable] and people to -- to\nbe present and to remember the Holocaust, lighting candles. When I reported it, I got a standing\novation. The next year, and I don\u2019t remember the numbers any more, I probably reported 10 or\n12. After four or five years I reported, I have every state having Days of Remembrance in their\ncapitals. I have mai -- main cities. I don\u2019t remember -- don\u2019t remember how many cities doing\nexactly the same thing. I was very, very proud -- I am very, very proud of -- of accomplishing\nwhat I have accomplished. If I spent too much time, for me I did not. But I -- perhaps for my\nfamily I was too -- too many days away. I was in Washington very, very often, maybe five, six\ndays a month in Washington, and traveling to -- to o -- other states and making sure that there\n[indecipherable] done properly. But this is a legacy that I am leaving, leaving for my children\nand grandchildren, never to forget, to get involved in the cause of memory.",
        "A: Thank you very much for listening to me. Thank you all. When I came to the United States,\nmy aunt, the sister of my mother\u2019s, had that picture. It was sent to her before the war. My parents\nare here, young, and to me they look beautiful. I keep that picture in my room, to look at it\nwhenever I am there, and I revive memories looking at that picture. It\u2019s very helpful. That\npicture I received in Israel from my sister\u2019s friends. She had a -- she had quite a few friends, and\nI am not sure why my sister sent the picture to Israel. I was thinking many times that maybe she\nwas thinking of going there, and she sent the picture to get her some papers or something like\nthis, but I am not positive, I really don\u2019t know.",
