        "Q: We're on. Tape is rolling. Please tell us your name.",
        "A: My name is Jon Butnaru.",
        "Q: When and where you have been born?",
        "A: I am born in Hu 1, a small city from Moldavia. At... December 4th, 1980...1918.",
        "Q: Please tell us about your family, about growing up in Hu_1 before the war.",
        "A: My family is from Hu_i. My grandfather was born in Hu_1, my father born in Hu_i. What I\ncan tell you? They make a living being vineyards [NB: vintners]. They plant their\nvineyards. They harvest the vineyards. They sell the wine. They are very good\nwinemakers. As a matter of fact, all my young...my childhood, my young years I spent on\nthe...1n the vineyards. So what more I can tell you about? I learn...1 was in elementary\nschool in Hu_1, and, uh, high school in Hu i. I couldn't go to the university, because I was\ntaken to work for the army in 1939--November 11, after the war broke between Germany\nand Poland.",
        "Q: Let's go back for a moment, please, and tell us about the community life in Hu_1.",
        "A: Yes. Uh, uh, the city of Hu 1, it was a very interesting city from a social point of view.\nThey are, uh, Romanian, of course, the majority. It was a Bulgarian population, who, uh\n...they, uh ...they, uh, were vegetable, uh...gardeners. There are a kind of Hungarian people,\nthey are most of them vineyard...vineyards [NB: vintners]; and Jewish population. The\nJewish population, 1t wasn't so big. Around thousand, or twelve hundred, uh, families. Uh,\nthe maj...majority of them are, uh, shopkeepers and, uh, artisans--tailors, shoemakers, uh,\nroof...uh, uh, they... they deal with roofings. And, uh, from a cult...cultural point of view, it\nwas interesting that it was a library organized in the...in the...by the Jewish community,\nwhich each of us...almost each generation of boys and girls from the high school, they work\nas a volunteers in this library. So, uh, they organized, uh...they were organizing, um, the\nliterary festivals and artistical festivals. We...uh, I mean, it was a very interesting, uh,\ncultural life. There was, uh, small newspaper, which I start when I was seventeen years old\nto publish some articles regarding the...the city. Epigrams--I liked this kind of thing when I\nwas young. So it was a kind of apprenticeship writing, to this small newspaper. And, uh, I\nhave a cousin. The cousin, he was a lawyer. He...he was a very talented, uh, writer and\njournalist; and he gave me...gave me the courage to start to do this. I mean, it was the\nbeginning on my writing career, how to say.",
        "Q: Would you tell us a few words about day-to-day life of your family?",
        "A: Uh, it was nothing exciting. My were...my father was very busy with our vineyard. She...he\nwoke up in the early, early hour of the morning, being there. Because I don't know if you\nknow, a vineyard is taking a lot of work to...to maintain it, to keep it. And, uh, my mother\nwas home. I have a sister, which she is...she is older as me--seven years. She married very\nyoung. She moved out from our house. So I was alone. It was nothing... Uh, I had friends--\nboys and girls from my generation. But we spent all the time, our leisure hours out in the\nvineyards.",
        "Q: What happened to you once the war broke?",
        "A: As a matter of fact, it happens in this...1n 1939, in the summer, I was very sick. I was... took\na cold. I...[ caught a cold. I don't know how to say in English \"pleurisy\"; I have water in\nmy...my lungs. I was very, very sick. But in... later in the summer, in the beginning on the\nSeptember, I start to recover. And I... was in our vineyard, because it was fresh air. And,\nuh, I have received good nourishment from my...my family. So, uh, when war broke, I was\nhome. Uh, I was home, recovering from my illness. And in November, when I first...I\nreceived an order to present myself to the...my uh...my, uh, regiment, I could try to postpone\nthe military duty, because I was still not recovered. But I want to do this, because I...I\nunderstood there wasn't any reason to postpone. Because anyway I'll be...I'll have to go\nto...to... to the army. So, uh, in November 11, when the war broked, already I was in the\narmy. And I was tried...uh, I...I trained very hardly. And it was a very hard winter in 1939-\n1940; and after then, the spring of 1940, I was sent, uh, on the military zone 1n northern part\nof, uh, Moldavia where my regiment belongs. I was in the Regiment, 9th Regiment of\nInfantry from Rimnicu S rat. So being in the army, I was trained during the during the\nsummer and we walked to the fortification facing... facing the Russian coming from the\nnorthern part of Moldavia. We didn't know about if they'll ...1f they'll come; then nobody\nthought.... But we worked to this kind of fortification all the period of time. And the\nsummer of, uh, 1940, it was a Russian ultimatum asking Romanian to cede the Bessarabia\n[and], uh, northern part of Bukovina. I was, uh, near...uh, two or three kilometer fr...from,\nuh, uh, small city--the name is Her_a--which, uh, which never was, uh, in the occupied by\nthe Russian. But it was in the Moldavian part. And the Russians, they were interested to\nhave, uh, bridge in[to], uh, uh, Romania. So they took...they took this city of Her_a, too.\nAnd, uh...and after then, we retreat. It was, uh...I retreat from, uh... with the whole army, the\nRomanian army, from this point 'til Roman--the city Roman. Day and night, day and night;\nuh, because it was... We were under very big pressure, because behind us it was the\nRomanian army from Bessarabia [and] from Bukovina, who has to escape. And, uh, after\nthen, being in Roman--as a matter of fact, in a village near Roman--I, uh...I being Jewish,\nand, uh, with other people...and other soldier being Jewish, we were expelled from the\nArmy.\u2019 And I remember, because I was on act...on active duty.\nI didn't have even civilian clothes with me. So they give me some kind of clothes from\nthe...from their warehouse, which didn't fit on me. Which was...I was almost naked. And I\nreceive orders to present myself to the to the regiment in Rimnicu S_rat. And it was...it was\na problem to, uh, to take the train and to make the journey to... to, uh, Rimnicu S rat,\nbecause everybody, it was military. And who was was dressed like me, know...know...they\nknow exactly that...that I...1 was a Jew. So it was...1t was very dangerous to make this trip to,\nto Rimnicu S_rat; because uh, well, I... could be beaten or just threw out...threw out of ...of\nthe window--which that happened to many people. So I managed to escape. And, uh, I\npresent the second day I was to the regiment. And they give me...they give me a order to go\nhome, and to wait for new...new...new disposition. I arrived home. And after three days or\nfour days, I receive an order to come back to the regiment on September Ist, 1940. I come\nback. And I was...I, I was sent to, uh, in the working battalions. It was not yet in the labor\ncamp. All the former soldiers, they have to go to the work...to the fortification. And I was\nsent to the Carpathian Mountains and, uh, the city...the small city Tirgu Neam_, working the\nfortification facing the Hungarian border. That's...this was the period of time when the\nbr...the war broke. And, uh, when in the summer of 1941 I was home, sent back from the\nworking battalions. And I worked in the city [of Hu_i], sent doing kind of cleaning the\nstreets and something like this. Not..not too hard. It was very humiliating, because\neverybody knows us. But we didn't have another choice.\nI remember that the war broke against the Russians on June 22nd [1941]. It was Sunday.\nSaturday, in the afternoon, all Jewish male from, uh, the age of eighteen to sixty, we have to\npresent ourselves to the police quarter. I didn't know why. So I was there; and there we\nwere locked up. Nobody can leave. We left...we slept in the courtyard of the police quarter\nin Hu_i. And in the dawn, we're sent to an unknown destination. What was known, it was\nthat I heard going to the villages that the war broke. And we heard the orders that everybody\nhas to go to war against the...the Russians. As...an interesting story which I remember, that\nwe atrived in a small village in a nearby county near, Tutova, is the name of this county.\nAnd the village, the name is Bogdana. I can't forget it. And we stood there for one night\nwaiting for some orders. I don't know what kind of order we expected. But I remember, that\nit was in afternoon of this same day that, uh, an officer from the gendarmerie came to us.\nAnd we know very well who the gend...the...the...the gendarmerie is. They were the most\n' This would have been early in August 1940.\noppressive part of the Romanian Army. But I have to tell you that this man, it was a very\nkind man. And he told us, \"Don't be afraid, as long as you are under my jurisdiction. If I...1f\nI have to go to eat, I'll never eat if I know that you are hungry...uh, hungry.\" His name is\n[Gheorghe] Pris caru. And I remember that after the war, I wrote about this man, in\nSeptember 1944. But from...from Bogdana, it comes the order to go to a city of Birlad.\n(Cough) I am sorry. And now, in the Birlad, we are...we embarked on the train, the cattle\ntrain, and sent to a camp--deportation camp. And the city, it was Tirgu Jiu. And we arrived\nin Tirgu Jiu after a journey of two or three days. But on this our journey to Tirgu Jiu, I want\nto tell you something which I like to be made...made...make it public.\nWe stopped in a city--the name is Craiova--to change the engine to go to Tirgu Jiu. It was in\nthe morning. The soldier opened the doors from the cattle cars. And some of us stepped out,\njust to take a breathe of fresh air. And a petty man from the... working, uh...a worker from\nthe...from the railroad, come to these people and...and start to mug them, taking their money\nand things which they have. An engine makes a maneuver, and ...and the neighbor from the\ntrain. And the mech...the mechanic from the engine saw this man mugging people. He\nstopped the engine, stepped down; and he went to this guy who who continued to do it, to\nmug. He slapped him in the face. He said, \"Give back everything!\" The guy, uh...the...the\nguy, he was afraid of [the mechanic], and he gave everything [back]. This man stepped up\non the engine, started the engine, and he'll go continue his work. I don't know his name. I\nnever saw him in my life. But I feel that I have to tell this story. In the beginning on the\nwar, when in Ia _1 the Jews start to be killed by the Romani...the same people. We arrived in\nthe camp of Tirgu Jiu.\nIt was something unbelievable huge. I want to tell you that this camp of Tirgu Jiu was built\nby the Polish army. When Polish was destroyed and occupied by the Russian, a part of the\nPolish Army was evacuated in Romania. So this...this camp was built by the Polish Army.\nNow in this period of time, the Polish Army left Romania--this is another story. So it [NB:\nTirgu Jiu] was a concentration camp. It was the first concentration [camp], beside other:\nCaracal, and Lugoj, and Miercurea-Ciuc, and so on. But this was the biggest of all of them.\nAnd, uh, this camp, it was a very interesting mixture of people. It...1t was divided in four and\nseven classes...uh, seven departments. And this department one or two, it was ...1t was some\nopposition of the Antonescus--and, uh, generals and, uh, diplomats, which they paid to stay\nthere. And the third class, 1t was a Legionary--the fascists. I'll tell you that, entering in\nthis...in this camp, I said to myself, \"Hey. At least, here I'll be, uh, nobody's yelling to me.\nNo...no ...no...no...no...nobody will call me dirty names, and so on.\" Walking in front of this,\nuh, [third] department of the labor camp, which we didn't know who they are--these people,\nthey start to yell to us and curs...cursing us. I said, \"Here, too?!\" Where there are the\nLegionnaires. And department four, there were womans. The department five, it was the\nevacuees. We stood [NB: stayed] in the evacuees department. It was the department\nnumber six, it was the suspects of communists. And number seven, these were the\ncommunists. There are separate quarters, but we managed to communicate with each other.\nOf course, not with the Legionnaires! Uh, after a short period of time, uh, part of us they\nsent to work in the garden...in the gardening. And another part, there are sent the place...it\nwas, uh, Valea or Valea Jiului, which was, where it was a famous lieutenant commander--\nTrepadu_--which was the criminal, and after the war he was judged as a criminal. Uh, we\nstood [NB: stayed] in...1n the camp of Tirgu Jiu with a period of time, uh, four months,\nalmost four months, when we are sent back in Hu_ 1.\nAnd we are put in, uh, a local camp, into the courtyard of the Jewish community. We are\nobliged to wear the yellow badge. And we are from time to time allowed to go home and to\nchange our underwear. Talking about this, I want to repeat another story about this, what\nhappens. When I received my first, uh, \"approval,\" how to say, to go home to change my,\nmy, uh, underwear, it was in Hu 1. Uh, I remember that it was way to go to...to my hou...\nmy parents' home. And I know [one is] quite, uh...not a very, uh...not a center of the street;\nbut I said, \"No, I have to go through the center of the street.\" I'm wear the badge, so I ...I\ndidn't care. I want to go see people, and people to see me; because everybody knows me\nthere. And I remember that walking on the street, I saw a girl which it was a very good\nfriend of my young years. And she saw me, too. But she saw...seeing me coming with the\nyellow badge, she crossed the street. She didn't want to talk to me. And I walked farther.\nAnd it was in the center of the street; people usually walked in the center, they stood [NB:\nstayed], they talk to them. And a friend of mine, uh, which are very close, he was a...a\nRomanian. And he saw me. And in front of all the people, he came to me and he hugged\nme. It was just a rebellion, to hug a Jew with a...with...with a yellow badge. And I want to\nsay this, and to be--how to say?--forever. Because I can't forget this. Unfortunately, he died\nafter the war. He was...he has tuberculosis. But doesn't matter. I want to talk about my\nfriend.\nUh, in this period of time being in camp in Tirgu Jiu, 1t happened something with my father\nwhich it was very important and very difficult period of time. As I told you, my father, it\nwas a very well-known person in city. A very honest man, with a... with a high degree of\ndignity and pride. If he borrows from somebody...somebody something, every penny he\ngive back. And he kept his whole word. So I told you that Sunday morning, on June 22nd,\nwe were sent to the camp to...to Tirgu Jiu. So it was Monday, Tuesday,\nWednesday...somebody knocked to our door. We know--my father told me, my mother--\nthey never even saw these people. And he start to talk: \"Hey, Mr. Butnaru! How are you?\"\nIn Yiddish. And he said, my father, \"I don't know who you are.\" \"Oh, it doesn't matter you\ndon't know me. Don't worry! The Russians are coming. Our brothers will be here. You'll\nbe liberated!\" My father was very... \"Who are you, sir? I don't make politics. I don't talk\nabout this. I have my problems.\" And this man, he continued to talk in this way. And after\nthat: \"Don't worry, we'll see each other.\" And he left. And this afternoon, my father was\narrested with another nine people from Hu_1. Leading person, and director of our bank, uh, a\nbookkeeper, a young lady, a pianist--and they're beaten to death to try to tell, ask them...ask\nthem to tell them where their...they have their communist meetings. And my father was a\ncommunist? I don't know if you are talking about somebody who is a...to speak in Hindu\nlanguage. And after then, [they] were sent in a trial. Because the war...the war zone, it was\nvery close from Hu_1. They was to be to be sent to a military court to be judged. Their luck\nit was that the military front moved far away very fast from Hu_1, so they they weren't\nanymore in this jurisdiction of the military court. The, a martial court. So they were sent to\na military court, but not, uh, for the front zone. I don't know if you understand me exact. It\nwas a trial in...in the city Gala_1; they sent to this court. How much they hate the Jews, they\ncouldn't do this mockery. So they acquit them, all of them. But they ask the local authority\nfrom the city of Hu_i to kept them like... like, uh, hostage, as a guarantee. If will be a\nsabotage somewhere in this neighborhood of our city, they'll be shot. So when I came home\nfrom the city, from the camp...from the Tirgu Jiu, I was very surprised that my father didn't\ncome to see me. Only my mother.\nEverybody, waiting from my mother, for...for my father; because everybody's looking for\nrelatives to come. Uh, I talked to some people who knows me, and everybody said, \"Okay.\nIs okay with your father. Don't worry.\" But I didn't know to what to worry, because my\nmother hadn't any opportunity to write me being in...in the camp of Tirgu Jiu. Later on, I\nsaw my mother come--of course, wearing the badge. And she told me this story that my\nfather is not home. Uh, my father is arrested in a military, uh, barracks, near the the...the\nborder of Hu_i. So after a couple of months, we are allowed to go home, as the...as the...as\nthe local camp was dismantled. And my father was allowed to come home, too; but he has\nto present himself each week to the police to sign in, in...1n a book that he didn't leave\nthe...the city. Uh, in this period of time in Romania, it was the Legionary government with\nAntonescu. It was in the fall of 1941. The situation, it was terrifying. My father lost\neverything--the vineyard, the harvest. It happened to be a very good year with wine, and full\nof...it was the...the cellar full with wine. And, uh, they start to take the houses and\neverything. One night was...I was arr...arrested by the Legionary police; and kept arrested...",
        "Q: Excuse me. This happened before the Tirgu Jiu camp?\n* Antonescu declared Romania a \"National Legionary State\" after King Carol II fled the country\nin September 1940.",
        "A: After.",
        "Q: After?",
        "A: After. I told you. Tirgu Jiu, it was on the beginning of the war with Russia. It was the\nsummer of 1941, and I stood in the camp 'til September 1941. In September 1941, I come\nback. My father was hostage, and I was in a local camp. In the fall of 1941 the camp, local\ncamp, was dismantled. My father was allowed to come home. The Legionary government,\nit was in full power. We took out...we lost everything--the vineyard, the house, everything.\nFrom our big house, we are allowed... allowed to live in a one room in...was near...which\nwas a kitchen. It was all which we possessed. One day I was arrested, I said...I told you, by\nthe Legionary police. And I have to confess, I wasn't beaten. I heard people yelling and\nmoaning, because they were [being] beaten. They didn't beat me. Because all of them, they\nare former colleagues and from our childhood. And they didn't dare to do this to me. They\ndidn't do this to me. But they are my friends, all of them. So we decided we have to do\nsomething. We decided to do something; because the situation, it was very dangerous. And\nif I was so lucky not to be beaten once, who knows what will be the second time? So one\nnight...one day, I went to the police quarter. I paid a fee; and my father found a friend of\nours, and he bribed a police...a policeman from the office to give me _ the...the\nauth...authorization to leave the city. And I left the city to Bucharest. My father and my\nmother left in Hu i. So in January...no, in December. December 1941. So in the beginning\nof 1942--no, 1940...1941 ... No. I ama little bit mixed...no, no, no. Yes. Uh, no. There\nwere....",
        "Q: It's all right.",
        "A: No, no, no. In 1941, it was the Legionary movement. Uh, the war started in, uh, 1941 in\nJune, so you have to...in the...to ...to make to edit this part of... I can try to...to tell again.",
        "Q: That's fine. Don't worry about it.",
        "A: Yes. I am mixed a little bit the dates. Because I want to be very precise. So we, uh...L...I\nwas in Bucharest in 1941, in January. Uh, to...of a...to a family...to a relative of ours, very\nclose relatives. As, uh...as they lived near Hala... the place which is Hala Traian. The street,\nit was Miti_a Constantinescu; and not so far from the Jewish quarter, which is V_c_ re ti and\nDude ti. I remember when the, uh, Legionary revolution...uh, rebellion started.\u201d We heard,\nwe...we are close to...to the radio, listening to what happens on the street. _I...I... remember\nthe shootings around the house. And, uh, one, I...I...[ looked through the windows; and I saw\nthe, the, the Legionary in their...in their trucks, and with with the...the flags and the green\n* The Iron Guard rebellion took place from January 21-23, 1941.\nflags and tri-colored flags, running on the streets with their motorcycles. I saw across the\nstreet. I watched through the window when a... when a...when a...a car stopped in front of\nthe window. Uh, three or four people, they would go out. Here, they enter the house and,\nuh, they took somebody and left. And, uh, I remember very vividly that the second day, the\nsecond day of the rebellion, when we heard that the Legionary, they, uh, the gave up,\nthey...they surrendered. I went to V_c re ti and to Dude ti, and I visit them. I\nremember...uh, house after house, it was pillaged and burned. Uh, I saw...I was in the ... on\nthe front of the morgue, which is situated not close from the River Dimbovi_a, with\nthe...surrounded by tanks. And people--Jews--trying to enter in the morgue...in the morgue;\nbecause they want to recognize the...the relatives, their loved ones, who they are killed in...in\nthis period and then during this, uh, rebellion. Uh, I have very vivid memory of this period\nof time. I tried, the house which were...where lived, which was not attacked by the...by the\nLegionnairies. But I remember very well everything. After then, the relatives--it was an\nuncle of ours--he left to Hu_i to see what happens with my family. Because they didn't want\nto allow me to go home. And, um, he stood there for a period of time--two weeks, three\nweeks--and he came back. And he said to me, \"I think you can go home now. But,\nuh...(pause) you'll find your father okay. He is okay now.\" I didn't know what happens. He\nhad a stroke. He used to go... (Crying) I'm sorry.",
        "Q: It's all right.",
        "A: (Pause) He used to go everyday on a certain point on a street, looking to his vineyard like\nsomebody's going to see a beloved one. (Crying) And one day, coming home, he had a\nstroke. Somebody has to carry him home on his shoulder. He couldn't walk. But it happens\nthat he was a very strong man; and he...he managed, how to say, to survive this. And when I\ncame home, he was a broken man. He was very...he lost a lot of weight. But he used to\nwalk, and he talked; and it was a miracle. So he didn't know nothing. And the summer,\nwhen the war start, I told you that he was very, very hard...very brutal beaten by the officer\nwho...who tried to find out he... he was a communist. But he was...he...he managed\nto...to...to survive this period of time. So, after the camp I told you, we're in...1n the local\ncamp; and we, uh...we were sent to work to clear the street of snow, and the highways of\nsnow. Because I...I told you, Hu_1, it was a very important point to go to the front line. So\nthe highways should be cleared by snow; the...the tanks, and the comm...and the lorries, and\nthe [soldiers] too can walk. And the springtime, we...we used to work in the same, uh, way\naround the city; and...and the summer of 1942, it was the first detachment of Jews sent to\nBessarabia. Which is just a new chapter in my life.\n* January 22, 1941.\nIt was the first labor...labor battalion, labor camp, which I was sent. I was sent...the city, it\nwas Bolgrad, the capital of the county Cahul. The railroad stopped in a certain station--the\nname, it was Bulg_rica--thirteen kilometers [northeast] from Bolgrad. So if somebody has to\ngo to Bolgrad, has to stop... make a stop in this station, Bulg rica, and to take a coach or\nsomething--which we didn't (laughter) take, of course--to go to Bolgrad. But not...this is not\nthe point where I am talking about, Bulg rica. When we arrived there, it was in the middle\nof the summer. And a terrible, terrible stink. It was an insupportable stink. We couldn't\nunderstand what is this smell here. And, uh, I asked...we asked people, \"What...why is this\nsmell here?\" They didn't want to answer. So, arriving in Bulg rica, we put...we were put in\na column around...surrounded by the...the gendarmes, and...and went to the...to the direction\nto, uh, Bolgrad. We entered in this city of Bolgrad, and it was a Dante-esque view. Try to\nimagine: You enter in a city--empty city, empty streets. Nobody on the streets. The houses,\nthey don't have doors. The windows are smashed. Everything is pillaged. Just one dog, or a\ncat, running on the street. In the center of the street, it was, uh...1t was some buildings\noccupied by the Romanian administration. And we asked to stay there, to be sent in a certain\ndirection. We didn't know nothing.\nSitting there, waiting for orders, some Jews start to...to walk around. An officer come, uh,\nuh, with a horse... riding a horse. And he saw the people, uh, walking around; and he start\nbeating them with...with...with a whip. With a whip, so everybody was very concentrate. A\nfriend of mine, he was a little bit older as me--two or three year older. He told me, \"Do you\nknow something? I was here in Bolgrad, in...1n my military duty 1n an artillery regiment...the\nart...the number 30[th] Regiment of Artillery from Bolgrad. And I remember that in a Purim\nnight, Jews from Bolgrad used to go to this regiment and ask the commander to allow the\nJewish boys in the Army to come to this Jewish houses to celebrate the festi... the...the\nfestivity of...the festival of Purim. So I remember that the house is not so far. It's very close\nfrom here. Do you want to go with me to this house? I want to see this house.\" And we\nwent. You know, it's a very interesting moment which I can't forget. And I think I wrote\nabout this in my book. Imagine, I went in this house--completely empty. And this guy start\nto tell me, \"In this corner, it was a piano. And on this piano, a young lady plays a piano.\nAnd the house was full with people, and the smell of food. And everything, it was alive.\nAnd now everything is dead. Only ghosts.\" And I understand then why it was this smell in\nthe ...1n the station of Bulg rica. It was a common grave, a mass grave. The people from\nBolgrad, they are shot and put in this grave. After then, uh, we swear...we went to, uh...to a\nvillage, the name it was Cubei. It was a quarry. We start to work in this quarry. A hard\nlabor. We went...we were obliged to make a cubic meter of stones taken from the, from\nthe... from...from the earth. And we worked 'til then late in the fall.\nWe were exhausted, without clothes. And we are sent by train to, uh, Dobruja [region], to\nanother famous, uh, quarry. It was Turcoaia. The county, it was Tulcea. The city was\nM_ cin. And I remember that leaving from...from Bulg rica, from Bul...Bessarabia to...to\nTurcoaia, to...to Gala_i to Br_ ila to cross the River, uh, Da...Da...Danube, it was terrible\ncold... cold. And I didn't manage to enter in, in, in a...1in a wag...wagon, you know. So I\nstood on the stairs of the train. And I said, \"I'll froze. I'll got froze.\" And L..I...1 go down,\nand I put around me a...a...some rug. I have a rug. I slept on this rug, so it protected me.\nAnd I didn't froze. I have this train. So we cross the Danube; and we start to work in\nCubei...in, uh, Turcoaia, to the quarry. It was a very hard situation there. We are under the\ncommand of a certain Captain Munteanu--a degenerate drunkard, [who] played cards.\nHe...he need money all the time. He took ours...all our money which we still have. And\nuh...and it was late in October, late in November, when we were allowed to go home for a\nshort period of time to change our clothes, to take our winter...winter clothes. And after the\nChristmas, we have to go home [NB: to the quarry]. Then I wrote on this card, on a... \"I\nhave to go to camp. It's after Christmas.\" We go back to...to Turcoaia, and we stood [NB:\nstayed] there over the winter. In the spring, we start to work to, uh...um, at some railroad, to\ntransport the...the... the, uh, stone from the quarry which we...we brought out.\nAnd, uh, it was 'til, uh...'til the '43, late in '43, when we moved to another, uh, camp not...not\nso from...from our hou...from Hu_i. It was near Birlad. It was part of improvement of our\nlife. Because we managed to have some friends in Birlad; they brought us some food,\nsome...brought some clothes. So it was a little bit easy for us. We sit over the winter in\n1943-1944; when, uh...when we were brought home in summer of '44. And we worked to\nthe highways, to repair the highways near the city of Hui. And, uh, in 1944, in August '44,\nit happens that the Hu_1, it was, uh, occupied by, uh, liberate [NB: liberators]--we can say\n\"liberate,\" but it's...1t's the truth--by the Russian Army. After a day, the Romanians, uh, took\nover the... the city; which it was, uh, fig...street fights. But the third day, the Romanian\nretreat...the Romanian Army, uh, surrendered; and, uh, we were, how to say, liberated. And,\nuh, it was for us, the war, it was over. It wasn't over for the rest of the Romania; but of this\npart of Moldavia, this part of Romania where I lived with my parents, we managed to...to...to\ngo through this period of time with my sack...sack with bones. So we survived. What do\nyou want to ask me more?",
        "Q: Yah. I...[ would like to know what happened to you after the war.",
        "A: After the war, I need a pair of pants. (Laughter) I need a a jacket. And my father didn't\nhave the money to give me, to ...to buy this. I was young. I want to talk to girls, to, to met\npeople. But I need the pants. So my father give me his only one suit. And we go to a tailor,\nand he tried to manage to arrange for myself. So I was very well elegant in this period of\ntime. So we start to reorganize the life in Hu_i. We need a mayor. We need a prefect. We\nneed the police. We need a...a Chamber of Commerce. We need to start to... to open the\nwindows of the stores, and to have a normal life. And we're not...we start to have...to open\nthe schools. I recetve a job as a Secretary of the Comm...of the Chamber of Commerce. I\nentered it; everything it was destroyed and broken. We didn't have...we didn't even have\npencil to...to ...to start to write some orders and to give some authorization. We had\neverything, (laughter) but it was a very funny situation. Nobody...nobody give us order. But\nwe have to do something. But I remember that after a short period of time--is to say three\nweeks, four weeks, of a kind of republic in Romania--a delegation of the government from\nRomania come in Moldova [NB: Moldavia] to see what happened there. Because nobody\nknows in Bucharest what happens in Moldova. So they start to say to us, \"Look. What you\nare, Stay...stay in place. You are the policeman; you'll be the policeman. You are the mayor;\nyou'll be the mayor.\" So, uh, that we...they...the first thing what they did, they organized the\nCommunist Party. Which I didn't belong. I said, \"It's time to think about.\" So 1944, 1945\nand 1946, I didn't join the Communist Party. In 1946, I said, \"It's any reason to stay in Hu_1?\nI don't want to do this here. And I don't know...I don't think I have a future.\" So we moved\nin Bucharest...to Bucharest.\nI tried to have a job. I couldn't have a job, because I didn't...1 wasn't a Communist [Party]\nmember. Later...later, in 1947, when the Carol [II], the king, has...was obliged to...to\nabdicate, it was no other way. So I said, \"Okay, your way. I am a Communist, too.\" So we\njoined the Communist Party, and I have a job. And, uh, I was a member of the Party 'til I left\nRomania. And I remember when I received the citizenship here in America, the guy...the\nperson from the Immigration Office\u00ae asked me, \"But you are a long time in the Communist\nParty.\" \"Yes. For a long time, I have to eat.\" \"But how come?\" And I said, \"Sir, you have a\nvery nice job here, asking me why. Do you suppose if you have this job in Romania, asking\npeople why, you can be or have the job without being a Communist Party [member]?\" And\nhe start to laugh, \"I know the story.\" So I was a full soldier. I clapped, when I have to clap.\nI have to stay ...uh, say, \"Hurray,\" when I have to say, \"Hurray.\" And that was the life. But\nafter the war, it was something interesting in my life, living in Hu_1i with a friend of mine.\nHis name is Anton Celaru. I don't know if you know him. He was a journalist working for\nInforma ia Bucure tiului for many years. We stood [NB: stayed] in. We, uh, all here with\nTiti Fierstein, we, uh, printed then a newspaper. I remember that the newspaper, the first\nnewspaper after the war in this part of the world, has reprinted in two...two hundred copies.\nAnd they sold these copy through a window; because everybody wants to have this\ncopy...uh, this newspaper. What I remember about this newspaper is that my first article--\nwhich I wrote after the \"liberation,\" [so] to say--1t was an open letter to the Major Pris_caru.\n> Tt was not Carol II who abdicated in 1947, but his son, Michael I--who became king when his\nfather fled the country in September 1940, shortly after Antonescu came to power.\n\u00b0 Immigration and Naturalization Service (also: INS).\nDo you remember I told you, from this gendarme. I said, \"I feel like I have the duty to wrote\nto you, and to thank you now for your humanity. For the human feelings. When we are\ndown, we are nobodies, you told us you can't eat as long as you know that we are hungry.\nSo I am writing this letter to you.\" I...I didn't know if he is alive. I didn't know where he 1s.\nThe story is that people from Hu_1, who after I left the ci...my city, they find him. And they\nask him to come to...to live with them. But this is another story. So, uh, I come in\nBucharest. I had a job in the Ministr...in the Department of Art. And I was sent in a city\nLugoj, in Banat [region], uh, being a Concierge Cultural--a cultural counsellor. I don't know\nwhat. After then, I was, uh, brought back in Bucharest. I give, I...I receive a...a...an\n\"advancement\" [promotion], how to say it; and, uh, I was General Inspector. I work with\nOctav Livezeanu and Eduard Mezinceascu. And, uh, after then, I was, uh, a kind of manager\nof the Department of the Cultural Houses from the city...the Commitee Culturale, how to\nsay; and, uh, I worked a lot of time there. Suddenly, they remember me. And they say,\n\"Hey, hey! Just a minute! Who was your father?\" \"My father was a vineyard [NB:\nvintner].\" \"So you don't have a ...you don't have a...a sound origin. You don't have...you are\nnot...you are not a friend of ours. You are...you are just a com...a road companion.\" And\nthey...they fire me. And I was without job, with...being a Communist, a member of the\nCommunist Party, without a job. And [they're] telling me that I...[...1 am...] am an enemy of\nthe people. Later...later on, I receive a job--the Department of Agriculture. I said, \"I don't\nhave nothing common with this. I...[ don't know nothing about this.\" So I have to have this\njob for a good part of my life. And, uh, because I didn't have nothing in common, with,\nuh...and I couldn't find a job in the Ministry--the Department of the Culture. They didn't\nwant to give me back the job. I found a job as a Secretary Literary was a...with a...with the\ncircus, which I worked. And kind of a period of time. And they built the new building of\nthe circus; I was the director of there--of this building, of this hall of activity, of cultural\nactivities there. And after then, I moved to, uh... was General Secretary of the...of the\npublishing house of the Tourism, with Pop Simion was the director at this period of time. I\ndon't know if you know some...something about Pop Simion. A nice man. After then, I said\nto myself, \"I build enough socialism. The socialism is blowing in Romania; and [it] can\nblow without me, too.\" So what I have to do? To emigrate, it was not easy.\nBecause we had some familial problems with the parents of my wife; so we couldn't leave\nthe country. But I didn't want; I considered I built enough socialism. So one day, see, I said\nto myself, \"I am sick. Not just tired.\" So I managed--paying a good money--to be retired as\nbeing a sick man; and from this position, after a couple of years, I emigrate to America.",
        "Q: Uh, we have to stop now because we need a short time to change tapes.",
        "[A: | Okay. So I immigrate to America. I have this point...) [TEXT IN PRECEDING\nBRACKETS NOT ON VIDEOTAPE]\nTAPE #2",
        "Q: We are on tape again. And I'd like to ask you to describe for us the conditions of arriving in\nHu_1 immediately after the war.",
        "A: You know, I...I tried to recollect this period of time. It's... You know, never...I didn't think\nnever about this. But it was a kind of explosion. A kind of rejoice. You have to understand,\nfrom a psychological point of view, this situation of this specially of the young people.\nSuddenly, from the bottom of the society, you were somebody. You have to have...you\ncan...have the opportunity to have a job. You have a certain position--a certain position\nwhich you can never dream to have. You are a human being, too. You walk on the street,\nand people salute you. And I remember something which I like to tell you. There is\nsomething which I just forgot. One evening, I walked with a friend of mine. A girl. As\nusual in the center of a small city, everybody know each other. And walking on the street,\nthat was a group of three or four boys--old hooligans. I know them. And they saw me\ncoming with the girl. And they blocked my...my, uh... I... couldn't go through them. It was\nonly one way to do this--just to to go around them. In the same way in which I did all my\nlife. And I said [to myself], \"This...now, I don't want to do this.\" And I said, \"Sorry. I have\nto go through.\" And they parted, and I went through them. It was the first time in my life\nthen when I said, \"I am somebody. You can't stop me.\" It was for a short period of time.\nAfter then, I learned my lesson. The same Janet with another haircut, in Romania. But\nanyway, it was a very...very interesting period of time. People get married. (Laughter)\nEverybody wants to ...to get married, to...to have a family, to be together. Uh, everybody\nis...uh, a lot of people went to Bucharest, or to Ia_1, to start to...to study. We worked there\nin...1n...1n our city. We have our friends. Myself, I...[...1 thought I have to...to...to get to get\nmarried. But that happens like in life...as in life. And I didn't do this then. So it was a very\ninteresting period of time. But shortly, a lot of things changed. People there are poor. They\nare poor. The ...the war paid... Everybody paid a great fee in this war. So, uh, nobody had\nan opportunity to do something to improve the life, of condition.\nAnd the meantime, Moldavia was st...st... striken...strucken by a, uh, drought. It was a\nfantastic famine in Moldavia. So when...when we... I was in Hu_i and Bucharest; from\nleaving Hu_1, I tried to send something to my parents. But it wasn't enough. It was a very\nhigh inflation in Romania. Everybody had...has to pay million. They...they print\nmill...paper--bills, money--for five million leu.\u2019 Only, for five million you can buy nothing.\nAbsolutely nothing. So it was a very hard period of time in Romania. And the famine, and\nthe people there are go...going from one part of the country to another part of the country.\n\u2019 Unit of Romanian currency.\nAnd I remember when I received my first job, in March 19...in 1989 [NB: 1949], in Lugo},\nin Banat [region]. In Banat, it wasn't famine. It happens it was a luckier... luckier part of the\nRomania. And I went to a restaurant and I asked to give me something, some, uh...some\nfood. I couldn't eat, because it was period of time when I didn't [have] what to eat in\nBucharest. And so it...1t was a very hard situation in Romania. Very hard. I don't talk about\nthe political situation; because from the political point of view, it was start to be hard from\nthe end of 1980...1948 and beginning of 1989 [NB: 1949]. It was a period of changement,\nfrom the political point of view. But as individual, it was hard to live in Romania. We didn't\nhave what to eat. So for me, when ...when...when my boss in the Department of Arts told\nme, \"Where do you want to go to have a job in province?\" I said, \"Everywhere it's\nsomething to eat!\" So they send me to Lugoj, which is a heaven for me.",
        "Q: Could you describe, please, your arrival in United States?",
        "A: Arrival in United States?",
        "Q: Your coming to America.",
        "A: We arrived...we arrived on the...on the October 27 or 29-- something like this. In the fall.\nHey, it's interesting, what I...what I felt for the first time. Uh, we, uh...we, uh...I, uh...we\nreceive a... We are transferred from Kennedy Airport to, uh, La...LaGuardia Airport; and I\nreceived a room in a motel. It was hot. It was stuffy. No air. And as a Romanian, I went to\nopen the doors. But the door, it was locked. I went to open the window. The windows there\nare locked. And I said, \"Where in Hell you can have a little bit of fresh air in America?\"\nAnd my daughter said, \"Look, you have the air conditioner. Turn the air conditioner, you\nhave fresh air.\" It was my first contact in America. But before all this, the man from the\nCustomer [NB: Customs], he opened .... I brought from the American Embassy from Paris\na... a yellow envelope. And the lady from the Ame...from Embassy from Paris told me,\n\"You have to give... Uh, don't open this envelope; because you have...there are very\nimportant documents here. And, uh, you have to give to the Custom.\" And I give the\nenvelope to the Custom, and they open the...the...the envelope. And he gave to me, to my\nwife and to my daughter my...our \"green card.\" And he said, \"You are a resident in America,\nand you are all welcome here.\" So I, as an American resident coming there in America.\nBecause we came to be unified with our family. Uh, I remember, regarding our arrival here\nin, uh...J remember that I had a discussion with the director from HIAS from Paris--a certain\nSchwartz (ph). Gentleman Schwartz. And he told me once, \"You have... you'll have\nproblems to accommodate in America. But don't be...don't worry. Go to Boston. You'll find\nthere people there who they are not related with you. They'll help you. They don't let you\ndown.\" I looked to this man. And I said, \"Maybe he knows what he's talking about.\" But I\nwas... was very afraid.\nLater on, when I wrote and I published my last book, Moshe Kopf and His World, I wrote a\nshort story about this encounter with the man with a straight face. Uh, I think I said it's a\ntribute. I remember my social worker--a lady. He [NB: she] has a small...a small office in\nBoston, in the Jewish Family [Services]. And I talked to her so many times. And I\nsays...every time when I left from this office, I said to myself, \"If somebody has the\nopportunity to record the echoes of the voices who talk to this lady [in] this small office, it'll\nbe a universe of human sufferings!\" And I said, \"I have to pay [NB: repay] this something\nfor this lady.\" And my first publish...published, uh, piece which I wrote, 1t was an open letter\nto this lady--\"The Unseen Diploma.\" She had behind her her diploma as social worker. But\nI talked about her soul, her wonderful, uh, human feelings. So I wrote a piece, which is in\nmy book, too--\"The Unseen Diploma.\" And there are a lot of people who tried to help us.\nAnd with my broken English, when I start to talk to people everybody's saying, \"Oh, your\nEnglish is very good!\" I know how good is my English. (Chuckling) But I know those\npeople try to understand us. They give us shelter. They give us food. They give us hope.\nYou understand...have to understand something. I discover my identity, not living in\nRomania so many years. I didn't left Romania a young man. I don't want to say I'm a old\n[man] now, but I wasn't young then. I discovered my.... I suffered like a Jew in Romania;\nbut I didn't know I am Jew, because I never considered. I was a Romanian! Here, I discover\nI am Jew. And I discover the whole story about the Holocaust, and what happened in\nRomania. Here, in the United States. You know, I had a job at Boston University.\nBeing here in America, I said--and I...I didn't have [a job]--\"Without a language and a good English,\nwhat I can do? The only thing which I can do is to be a kind of a bookkeeper or accountant, or\nsomething like this.\" So I attended a university course, which I finished with A+. And I have a\ndiploma in accounting. So I was in accounting, but I am a writer by profession. So each...each\nlunch time, every day...absolutely every day in my lunch time, I went to the library and make\nresearch in trying to find out about the Romania, Romanian Jew, Romanian history, and so on.\nSo...so I start to write my book, The Forgotten Holocaust.\u201d This book is not my book. Each line,\neach word, each page--I did it. I written...I write it. But this doesn't belong to me. It's the book of\nmy generation, of my people. And being here in America, I had opportunity to read it...to write this.\nLiving so many years in Romania and going so many years in the library of that academy in\nRomania, making research from my books which I wrote there, I never think about it. Because\nnobody give me the opportunity to see a newspaper, a piece of paper regarding this period of time.\nSo if somebody is...can accept this euphemism \"born in the second time,\" I am born.... I emigrate,\nbecause being a Jew in Romania.... Here in America that I discovered [myself] to be a Jew, living\nhere in America. This is...1t was something which which I can't forget. It is not to...to say, \"Thank\n* 1.C. Butnaru, The Silent Holocaust: Romania and Its Jews (New York: Greenwood Press,\n1992).\nyou, America. You did this, so and so.\" This relationship between me and America, it is another\nkind.\nA kind of a... And I have to tell you something. My character...my character, uh, Moshe Kopf, in\nmy last book, he used to live in Romania. And he has to exp...to ...to talk to somebody, to express\nhimself; but he was afraid. So he wrote a letter to himself. And the second part of my book, when\nhe lived in America [NB: Romania?] waiting for the America visa, he wrote to a friend of, uh, him\nletters in Romania. Arriving in America, he wrote letter to the same le....uh, friend. And it 1s a letter\nwhich is very important to this problem--me and America. My relationship with the United States.\nMoshe Kopf, walking in New York one day, met a very interesting person--Christoforus Columbus.\nAnd he start to...they start to walk, to talk together. And Moshe Kopf said to...to...to Christopher\nColumbus, \"You know, Master, you did a great job discovering America. But, you know, if you are\ndoing something to be good, you have to do it in a right time. You discovered America too late!\"\nAnd Christopher Columbus asked him, \"What means, 'too late.\"\" \"Of course it is too late! If you\ndiscovered America when the Jew were liberated by Moshe [NB: Moses] from their...their slavery\n... Slave situation in Egypt, instead of cross the Red Mer [NB: Red Sea], you can part the water in the\nAtlantic here. He is ...\". How to say? \"He knowed how to do the job. He can part the water in the\nAtlantic, and the Jew can arrive in America. And he can avoid so much persecution, blood, and\ntears, and so on.\" And Christopher Columbus said to him, \"Maybe you're right. Who knows?\" And\nhe depart from him, and he go back on his, uh, pedestal. Moshe Kopf, leaving Christopher\nColumbus, he thought...he said. And Christopher said, \"Come back. I want to tell you something.\nGo back and discover your America. I discovered a territory which is America. But everybody\nwho is arriving on this shore has to discover his own America. Two Americas are not the same.\"\nNo sir. I discovered my America here. And I am very grateful for this.",

They harvest the vineyards. They sell the wine. They are very good\nwinemakers. As a matter of fact, all my young...my childhood, my young years I spent on\nthe...1n the vineyards. So what more I can tell you about? I learn...1 was in elementary\nschool in Hu_1, and, uh, high school in Hu i.

        "A: Yes. Uh, uh, the city of Hu 1, it was a very interesting city from a social point of view.\nThey are, uh, Romanian, of course, the majority. It was a Bulgarian population, who, uh\n...they, uh ...they, uh, were vegetable, uh...gardeners.

So, uh, they organized, uh...they were organizing, um, the\nliterary festivals and artistical festivals. We...uh, I mean, it was a very interesting, uh,\ncultural life.

And I... was in our vineyard, because it was fresh air. And,\nuh, I have received good nourishment from my...my family. So, uh, when war broke, I was\nhome. Uh, I was home, recovering from my illness. And in November, when I first...I\nreceived an order to present myself to the...my uh...my, uh, regiment, I could try to postpone\nthe military duty, because I was still not recovered. But I want to do this, because I...I\nunderstood there wasn't any reason to postpone. Because anyway I'll be...I'll have to go\nto...to... to the army. So, uh, in November 11, when the war broked, already I was in the\narmy. And I was tried...uh, I...I trained very hardly. And it was a very hard winter in 1939-\n1940; and after then, the spring of 1940, I was sent, uh, on the military zone 1n northern part\nof, uh, Moldavia where my regiment belongs. I was in the Regiment, 9th Regiment of\nInfantry from Rimnicu S rat. So being in the army, I was trained during the during the\nsummer and we walked to the fortification facing... facing the Russian coming from the\nnorthern part of Moldavia. We didn't know about if they'll ...1f they'll come; then nobody\nthought.... But we worked to this kind of fortification all the period of time. And the\nsummer of, uh, 1940, it was a Russian ultimatum asking Romanian to cede the Bessarabia\n[and], uh, northern part of Bukovina. I was, uh, near...uh, two or three kilometer fr...from,\nuh, uh, small city--the name is Her_a--which, uh, which never was, uh, in the occupied by\nthe Russian. But it was in the Moldavian part. And the Russians, they were interested to\nhave, uh, bridge in[to], uh, uh, Romania. So they took...they took this city of Her_a, too.\nAnd, uh...and after then, we retreat. It was, uh...I retreat from, uh... with the whole army, the\nRomanian army, from this point 'til Roman--the city Roman. Day and night, day and night;\nuh, because it was... We were under very big pressure, because behind us it was the\nRomanian army from Bessarabia [and] from Bukovina, who has to escape. And, uh, after\nthen, being in Roman--as a matter of fact, in a village near Roman--I, uh...I being Jewish,\nand, uh, with other people...and other soldier being Jewish, we were expelled from the\nArmy.\u2019 And I remember, because I was on act...on active duty.\nI didn't have even civilian clothes with me. So they give me some kind of clothes from\nthe...from their warehouse, which didn't fit on me. Which was...I was almost naked. And I\nreceive orders to present myself to the to the regiment in Rimnicu S_rat. And it was...it was\na problem to, uh, to take the train and to make the journey to... to, uh, Rimnicu S rat,\nbecause everybody, it was military. And who was was dressed like me, know...know...they\nknow exactly that...that I...1 was a Jew. So it was...1t was very dangerous to make this trip to,\nto Rimnicu S_rat; because uh, well, I... could be beaten or just threw out...threw out of ...of\nthe window--which that happened to many people. So I managed to escape. And, uh, I\npresent the second day I was to the regiment. And they give me...they give me a order to go\nhome, and to wait for new...new...new disposition. I arrived home. And after three days or\nfour days, I receive an order to come back to the regiment on September Ist, 1940. I come\nback. And I was...I, I was sent to, uh, in the working battalions. It was not yet in the labor\ncamp. All the former soldiers, they have to go to the work...to the fortification. And I was\nsent to the Carpathian Mountains and, uh, the city...the small city Tirgu Neam_, working the\nfortification facing the Hungarian border. That's...this was the period of time when the\nbr...the war broke. And, uh, when in the summer of 1941 I was home, sent back from the\nworking battalions. And I worked in the city [of Hu_i], sent doing kind of cleaning the\nstreets and something like this. Not..not too hard. It was very humiliating, because\neverybody knows us. But we didn't have another choice.\nI remember that the war broke against the Russians on June 22nd [1941]. It was Sunday.\nSaturday, in the afternoon, all Jewish male from, uh, the age of eighteen to sixty, we have to\npresent ourselves to the police quarter. I didn't know why. So I was there; and there we\nwere locked up. Nobody can leave. We left...we slept in the courtyard of the police quarter\nin Hu_i. And in the dawn, we're sent to an unknown destination. What was known, it was\nthat I heard going to the villages that the war broke. And we heard the orders that everybody\nhas to go to war against the...the Russians. As...an interesting story which I remember, that\nwe atrived in a small village in a nearby county near, Tutova, is the name of this county.\nAnd the village, the name is Bogdana. I can't forget it. And we stood there for one night\nwaiting for some orders. I don't know what kind of order we expected. But I remember, that\nit was in afternoon of this same day that, uh, an officer from the gendarmerie came to us.\nAnd we know very well who the gend...the...the...the gendarmerie is. They were the most\n' This would have been early in August 1940.\noppressive part of the Romanian Army. But I have to tell you that this man, it was a very\nkind man. And he told us, \"Don't be afraid, as long as you are under my jurisdiction. If I...1f\nI have to go to eat, I'll never eat if I know that you are hungry...uh, hungry.\" His name is\n[Gheorghe] Pris caru. And I remember that after the war, I wrote about this man, in\nSeptember 1944. But from...from Bogdana, it comes the order to go to a city of Birlad.\n(Cough) I am sorry. And now, in the Birlad, we are...we embarked on the train, the cattle\ntrain, and sent to a camp--deportation camp. And the city, it was Tirgu Jiu. And we arrived\nin Tirgu Jiu after a journey of two or three days. But on this our journey to Tirgu Jiu, I want\nto tell you something which I like to be made...made...make it public.\nWe stopped in a city--the name is Craiova--to change the engine to go to Tirgu Jiu. It was in\nthe morning. The soldier opened the doors from the cattle cars. And some of us stepped out,\njust to take a breathe of fresh air. And a petty man from the... working, uh...a worker from\nthe...from the railroad, come to these people and...and start to mug them, taking their money\nand things which they have. An engine makes a maneuver, and ...and the neighbor from the\ntrain. And the mech...the mechanic from the engine saw this man mugging people. He\nstopped the engine, stepped down; and he went to this guy who who continued to do it, to\nmug. He slapped him in the face. He said, \"Give back everything!\" The guy, uh...the...the\nguy, he was afraid of [the mechanic], and he gave everything [back]. This man stepped up\non the engine, started the engine, and he'll go continue his work. I don't know his name. I\nnever saw him in my life. But I feel that I have to tell this story. In the beginning on the\nwar, when in Ia _1 the Jews start to be killed by the Romani...the same people. We arrived in\nthe camp of Tirgu Jiu.\nIt was something unbelievable huge. I want to tell you that this camp of Tirgu Jiu was built\nby the Polish army. When Polish was destroyed and occupied by the Russian, a part of the\nPolish Army was evacuated in Romania. So this...this camp was built by the Polish Army.\nNow in this period of time, the Polish Army left Romania--this is another story. So it [NB:\nTirgu Jiu] was a concentration camp. It was the first concentration [camp], beside other:\nCaracal, and Lugoj, and Miercurea-Ciuc, and so on. But this was the biggest of all of them.\nAnd, uh, this camp, it was a very interesting mixture of people. It...1t was divided in four and\nseven classes...uh, seven departments. And this department one or two, it was ...1t was some\nopposition of the Antonescus--and, uh, generals and, uh, diplomats, which they paid to stay\nthere. And the third class, 1t was a Legionary--the fascists. I'll tell you that, entering in\nthis...in this camp, I said to myself, \"Hey. At least, here I'll be, uh, nobody's yelling to me.\nNo...no ...no...no...no...nobody will call me dirty names, and so on.\" Walking in front of this,\nuh, [third] department of the labor camp, which we didn't know who they are--these people,\nthey start to yell to us and curs...cursing us. I said, \"Here, too?!\" Where there are the\nLegionnaires. And department four, there were womans. The department five, it was the\nevacuees. We stood [NB: stayed] in the evacuees department. It was the department\nnumber six, it was the suspects of communists. And number seven, these were the\ncommunists. There are separate quarters, but we managed to communicate with each other.\nOf course, not with the Legionnaires! Uh, after a short period of time, uh, part of us they\nsent to work in the garden...in the gardening. And another part, there are sent the place...it\nwas, uh, Valea or Valea Jiului, which was, where it was a famous lieutenant commander--\nTrepadu_--which was the criminal, and after the war he was judged as a criminal. Uh, we\nstood [NB: stayed] in...1n the camp of Tirgu Jiu with a period of time, uh, four months,\nalmost four months, when we are sent back in Hu_ 1.\nAnd we are put in, uh, a local camp, into the courtyard of the Jewish community. We are\nobliged to wear the yellow badge. And we are from time to time allowed to go home and to\nchange our underwear. Talking about this, I want to repeat another story about this, what\nhappens. When I received my first, uh, \"approval,\" how to say, to go home to change my,\nmy, uh, underwear, it was in Hu 1. Uh, I remember that it was way to go to...to my hou...\nmy parents' home. And I know [one is] quite, uh...not a very, uh...not a center of the street;\nbut I said, \"No, I have to go through the center of the street.\" I'm wear the badge, so I ...I\ndidn't care. I want to go see people, and people to see me; because everybody knows me\nthere. And I remember that walking on the street, I saw a girl which it was a very good\nfriend of my young years. And she saw me, too. But she saw...seeing me coming with the\nyellow badge, she crossed the street. She didn't want to talk to me. And I walked farther.\nAnd it was in the center of the street; people usually walked in the center, they stood [NB:\nstayed], they talk to them. And a friend of mine, uh, which are very close, he was a...a\nRomanian. And he saw me. And in front of all the people, he came to me and he hugged\nme. It was just a rebellion, to hug a Jew with a...with...with a yellow badge. And I want to\nsay this, and to be--how to say?--forever. Because I can't forget this. Unfortunately, he died\nafter the war. He was...he has tuberculosis. But doesn't matter. I want to talk about my\nfriend.\nUh, in this period of time being in camp in Tirgu Jiu, 1t happened something with my father\nwhich it was very important and very difficult period of time. As I told you, my father, it\nwas a very well-known person in city. A very honest man, with a... with a high degree of\ndignity and pride. If he borrows from somebody...somebody something, every penny he\ngive back. And he kept his whole word. So I told you that Sunday morning, on June 22nd,\nwe were sent to the camp to...to Tirgu Jiu. So it was Monday, Tuesday,\nWednesday...somebody knocked to our door. We know--my father told me, my mother--\nthey never even saw these people. And he start to talk: \"Hey, Mr. Butnaru! How are you?\"\nIn Yiddish. And he said, my father, \"I don't know who you are.\" \"Oh, it doesn't matter you\ndon't know me. Don't worry! The Russians are coming. Our brothers will be here. You'll\nbe liberated!\" My father was very... \"Who are you, sir? I don't make politics. I don't talk\nabout this. I have my problems.\" And this man, he continued to talk in this way. And after\nthat: \"Don't worry, we'll see each other.\" And he left. And this afternoon, my father was\narrested with another nine people from Hu_1. Leading person, and director of our bank, uh, a\nbookkeeper, a young lady, a pianist--and they're beaten to death to try to tell, ask them...ask\nthem to tell them where their...they have their communist meetings. And my father was a\ncommunist? I don't know if you are talking about somebody who is a...to speak in Hindu\nlanguage. And after then, [they] were sent in a trial. Because the war...the war zone, it was\nvery close from Hu_1. They was to be to be sent to a military court to be judged. Their luck\nit was that the military front moved far away very fast from Hu_1, so they they weren't\nanymore in this jurisdiction of the military court. The, a martial court. So they were sent to\na military court, but not, uh, for the front zone. I don't know if you understand me exact. It\nwas a trial in...in the city Gala_1; they sent to this court. How much they hate the Jews, they\ncouldn't do this mockery. So they acquit them, all of them. But they ask the local authority\nfrom the city of Hu_i to kept them like... like, uh, hostage, as a guarantee. If will be a\nsabotage somewhere in this neighborhood of our city, they'll be shot. So when I came home\nfrom the city, from the camp...from the Tirgu Jiu, I was very surprised that my father didn't\ncome to see me. Only my mother.\nEverybody, waiting from my mother, for...for my father; because everybody's looking for\nrelatives to come. Uh, I talked to some people who knows me, and everybody said, \"Okay.\nIs okay with your father. Don't worry.\" But I didn't know to what to worry, because my\nmother hadn't any opportunity to write me being in...in the camp of Tirgu Jiu. Later on, I\nsaw my mother come--of course, wearing the badge. And she told me this story that my\nfather is not home. Uh, my father is arrested in a military, uh, barracks, near the the...the\nborder of Hu_i. So after a couple of months, we are allowed to go home, as the...as the...as\nthe local camp was dismantled. And my father was allowed to come home, too; but he has\nto present himself each week to the police to sign in, in...1n a book that he didn't leave\nthe...the city. Uh, in this period of time in Romania, it was the Legionary government with\nAntonescu. It was in the fall of 1941. The situation, it was terrifying. My father lost\neverything--the vineyard, the harvest. It happened to be a very good year with wine, and full\nof...it was the...the cellar full with wine. And, uh, they start to take the houses and\neverything. One night was...I was arr...arrested by the Legionary police; and kept arrested...\n* Antonescu declared Romania a \"National Legionary State\" after King Carol II fled the country\nin September 1940.",
        "A: After.",
        "A: After. I told you. Tirgu Jiu, it was on the beginning of the war with Russia. It was the\nsummer of 1941, and I stood in the camp 'til September 1941. In September 1941, I come\nback. My father was hostage, and I was in a local camp. In the fall of 1941 the camp, local\ncamp, was dismantled. My father was allowed to come home. The Legionary government,\nit was in full power. We took out...we lost everything--the vineyard, the house, everything.\nFrom our big house, we are allowed... allowed to live in a one room in...was near...which\nwas a kitchen. It was all which we possessed. One day I was arrested, I said...I told you, by\nthe Legionary police. And I have to confess, I wasn't beaten. I heard people yelling and\nmoaning, because they were [being] beaten. They didn't beat me. Because all of them, they\nare former colleagues and from our childhood. And they didn't dare to do this to me. They\ndidn't do this to me. But they are my friends, all of them. So we decided we have to do\nsomething. We decided to do something; because the situation, it was very dangerous. And\nif I was so lucky not to be beaten once, who knows what will be the second time? So one\nnight...one day, I went to the police quarter. I paid a fee; and my father found a friend of\nours, and he bribed a police...a policeman from the office to give me _ the...the\nauth...authorization to leave the city. And I left the city to Bucharest. My father and my\nmother left in Hu i. So in January...no, in December. December 1941. So in the beginning\nof 1942--no, 1940...1941 ... No. I ama little bit mixed...no, no, no. Yes. Uh, no. There\nwere....",
        "A: No, no, no. In 1941, it was the Legionary movement. Uh, the war started in, uh, 1941 in\nJune, so you have to...in the...to ...to make to edit this part of... I can try to...to tell again.",
        "A: Yes. I am mixed a little bit the dates. Because I want to be very precise. So we, uh...L...I\nwas in Bucharest in 1941, in January. Uh, to...of a...to a family...to a relative of ours, very\nclose relatives. As, uh...as they lived near Hala... the place which is Hala Traian. The street,\nit was Miti_a Constantinescu; and not so far from the Jewish quarter, which is V_c_ re ti and\nDude ti. I remember when the, uh, Legionary revolution...uh, rebellion started.\u201d We heard,\nwe...we are close to...to the radio, listening to what happens on the street. _I...I... remember\nthe shootings around the house. And, uh, one, I...I...[ looked through the windows; and I saw\nthe, the, the Legionary in their...in their trucks, and with with the...the flags and the green\n* The Iron Guard rebellion took place from January 21-23, 1941.\nflags and tri-colored flags, running on the streets with their motorcycles. I saw across the\nstreet. I watched through the window when a... when a...when a...a car stopped in front of\nthe window. Uh, three or four people, they would go out. Here, they enter the house and,\nuh, they took somebody and left. And, uh, I remember very vividly that the second day, the\nsecond day of the rebellion, when we heard that the Legionary, they, uh, the gave up,\nthey...they surrendered. I went to V_c re ti and to Dude ti, and I visit them. I\nremember...uh, house after house, it was pillaged and burned. Uh, I saw...I was in the ... on\nthe front of the morgue, which is situated not close from the River Dimbovi_a, with\nthe...surrounded by tanks. And people--Jews--trying to enter in the morgue...in the morgue;\nbecause they want to recognize the...the relatives, their loved ones, who they are killed in...in\nthis period and then during this, uh, rebellion. Uh, I have very vivid memory of this period\nof time. I tried, the house which were...where lived, which was not attacked by the...by the\nLegionnairies. But I remember very well everything. After then, the relatives--it was an\nuncle of ours--he left to Hu_i to see what happens with my family. Because they didn't want\nto allow me to go home. And, um, he stood there for a period of time--two weeks, three\nweeks--and he came back. And he said to me, \"I think you can go home now. But,\nuh...(pause) you'll find your father okay. He is okay now.\" I didn't know what happens. He\nhad a stroke. He used to go... (Crying) I'm sorry.",
        "A: (Pause) He used to go everyday on a certain point on a street, looking to his vineyard like\nsomebody's going to see a beloved one. (Crying) And one day, coming home, he had a\nstroke. Somebody has to carry him home on his shoulder. He couldn't walk. But it happens\nthat he was a very strong man; and he...he managed, how to say, to survive this. And when I\ncame home, he was a broken man. He was very...he lost a lot of weight. But he used to\nwalk, and he talked; and it was a miracle. So he didn't know nothing. And the summer,\nwhen the war start, I told you that he was very, very hard...very brutal beaten by the officer\nwho...who tried to find out he... he was a communist. But he was...he...he managed\nto...to...to survive this period of time. So, after the camp I told you, we're in...1n the local\ncamp; and we, uh...we were sent to work to clear the street of snow, and the highways of\nsnow. Because I...I told you, Hu_1, it was a very important point to go to the front line. So\nthe highways should be cleared by snow; the...the tanks, and the comm...and the lorries, and\nthe [soldiers] too can walk. And the springtime, we...we used to work in the same, uh, way\naround the city; and...and the summer of 1942, it was the first detachment of Jews sent to\nBessarabia. Which is just a new chapter in my life.\n* January 22, 1941.\nIt was the first labor...labor battalion, labor camp, which I was sent. I was sent...the city, it\nwas Bolgrad, the capital of the county Cahul. The railroad stopped in a certain station--the\nname, it was Bulg_rica--thirteen kilometers [northeast] from Bolgrad. So if somebody has to\ngo to Bolgrad, has to stop... make a stop in this station, Bulg rica, and to take a coach or\nsomething--which we didn't (laughter) take, of course--to go to Bolgrad. But not...this is not\nthe point where I am talking about, Bulg rica. When we arrived there, it was in the middle\nof the summer. And a terrible, terrible stink. It was an insupportable stink. We couldn't\nunderstand what is this smell here. And, uh, I asked...we asked people, \"What...why is this\nsmell here?\" They didn't want to answer. So, arriving in Bulg rica, we put...we were put in\na column around...surrounded by the...the gendarmes, and...and went to the...to the direction\nto, uh, Bolgrad. We entered in this city of Bolgrad, and it was a Dante-esque view. Try to\nimagine: You enter in a city--empty city, empty streets. Nobody on the streets. The houses,\nthey don't have doors. The windows are smashed. Everything is pillaged. Just one dog, or a\ncat, running on the street. In the center of the street, it was, uh...1t was some buildings\noccupied by the Romanian administration. And we asked to stay there, to be sent in a certain\ndirection. We didn't know nothing.\nSitting there, waiting for orders, some Jews start to...to walk around. An officer come, uh,\nuh, with a horse... riding a horse. And he saw the people, uh, walking around; and he start\nbeating them with...with...with a whip. With a whip, so everybody was very concentrate. A\nfriend of mine, he was a little bit older as me--two or three year older. He told me, \"Do you\nknow something? I was here in Bolgrad, in...1n my military duty 1n an artillery regiment...the\nart...the number 30[th] Regiment of Artillery from Bolgrad. And I remember that in a Purim\nnight, Jews from Bolgrad used to go to this regiment and ask the commander to allow the\nJewish boys in the Army to come to this Jewish houses to celebrate the festi... the...the\nfestivity of...the festival of Purim. So I remember that the house is not so far. It's very close\nfrom here. Do you want to go with me to this house? I want to see this house.\" And we\nwent. You know, it's a very interesting moment which I can't forget. And I think I wrote\nabout this in my book. Imagine, I went in this house--completely empty. And this guy start\nto tell me, \"In this corner, it was a piano. And on this piano, a young lady plays a piano.\nAnd the house was full with people, and the smell of food. And everything, it was alive.\nAnd now everything is dead. Only ghosts.\" And I understand then why it was this smell in\nthe ...1n the station of Bulg rica. It was a common grave, a mass grave. The people from\nBolgrad, they are shot and put in this grave. After then, uh, we swear...we went to, uh...to a\nvillage, the name it was Cubei. It was a quarry. We start to work in this quarry. A hard\nlabor. We went...we were obliged to make a cubic meter of stones taken from the, from\nthe... from...from the earth. And we worked 'til then late in the fall.\nWe were exhausted, without clothes. And we are sent by train to, uh, Dobruja [region], to\nanother famous, uh, quarry. It was Turcoaia. The county, it was Tulcea. The city was\nM_ cin. And I remember that leaving from...from Bulg rica, from Bul...Bessarabia to...to\nTurcoaia, to...to Gala_i to Br_ ila to cross the River, uh, Da...Da...Danube, it was terrible\ncold... cold. And I didn't manage to enter in, in, in a...1in a wag...wagon, you know. So I\nstood on the stairs of the train. And I said, \"I'll froze. I'll got froze.\" And L..I...1 go down,\nand I put around me a...a...some rug. I have a rug. I slept on this rug, so it protected me.\nAnd I didn't froze. I have this train. So we cross the Danube; and we start to work in\nCubei...in, uh, Turcoaia, to the quarry. It was a very hard situation there. We are under the\ncommand of a certain Captain Munteanu--a degenerate drunkard, [who] played cards.\nHe...he need money all the time. He took ours...all our money which we still have. And\nuh...and it was late in October, late in November, when we were allowed to go home for a\nshort period of time to change our clothes, to take our winter...winter clothes. And after the\nChristmas, we have to go home [NB: to the quarry]. Then I wrote on this card, on a... \"I\nhave to go to camp. It's after Christmas.\" We go back to...to Turcoaia, and we stood [NB:\nstayed] there over the winter. In the spring, we start to work to, uh...um, at some railroad, to\ntransport the...the... the, uh, stone from the quarry which we...we brought out.\nAnd, uh, it was 'til, uh...'til the '43, late in '43, when we moved to another, uh, camp not...not\nso from...from our hou...from Hu_i. It was near Birlad. It was part of improvement of our\nlife. Because we managed to have some friends in Birlad; they brought us some food,\nsome...brought some clothes. So it was a little bit easy for us. We sit over the winter in\n1943-1944; when, uh...when we were brought home in summer of '44. And we worked to\nthe highways, to repair the highways near the city of Hui. And, uh, in 1944, in August '44,\nit happens that the Hu_1, it was, uh, occupied by, uh, liberate [NB: liberators]--we can say\n\"liberate,\" but it's...1t's the truth--by the Russian Army. After a day, the Romanians, uh, took\nover the... the city; which it was, uh, fig...street fights. But the third day, the Romanian\nretreat...the Romanian Army, uh, surrendered; and, uh, we were, how to say, liberated. And,\nuh, it was for us, the war, it was over. It wasn't over for the rest of the Romania; but of this\npart of Moldavia, this part of Romania where I lived with my parents, we managed to...to...to\ngo through this period of time with my sack...sack with bones. So we survived. What do\nyou want to ask me more?",
        "A: After the war, I need a pair of pants. (Laughter) I need a a jacket. And my father didn't\nhave the money to give me, to ...to buy this. I was young. I want to talk to girls, to, to met\npeople. But I need the pants. So my father give me his only one suit. And we go to a tailor,\nand he tried to manage to arrange for myself. So I was very well elegant in this period of\ntime. So we start to reorganize the life in Hu_i. We need a mayor. We need a prefect. We\nneed the police. We need a...a Chamber of Commerce. We need to start to... to open the\nwindows of the stores, and to have a normal life. And we're not...we start to have...to open\nthe schools. I recetve a job as a Secretary of the Comm...of the Chamber of Commerce. I\nentered it; everything it was destroyed and broken. We didn't have...we didn't even have\npencil to...to ...to start to write some orders and to give some authorization. We had\neverything, (laughter) but it was a very funny situation. Nobody...nobody give us order. But\nwe have to do something. But I remember that after a short period of time--is to say three\nweeks, four weeks, of a kind of republic in Romania--a delegation of the government from\nRomania come in Moldova [NB: Moldavia] to see what happened there. Because nobody\nknows in Bucharest what happens in Moldova. So they start to say to us, \"Look. What you\nare, Stay...stay in place. You are the policeman; you'll be the policeman. You are the mayor;\nyou'll be the mayor.\" So, uh, that we...they...the first thing what they did, they organized the\nCommunist Party. Which I didn't belong. I said, \"It's time to think about.\" So 1944, 1945\nand 1946, I didn't join the Communist Party. In 1946, I said, \"It's any reason to stay in Hu_1?\nI don't want to do this here. And I don't know...I don't think I have a future.\" So we moved\nin Bucharest...to Bucharest.\nI tried to have a job. I couldn't have a job, because I didn't...1 wasn't a Communist [Party]\nmember. Later...later, in 1947, when the Carol [II], the king, has...was obliged to...to\nabdicate, it was no other way. So I said, \"Okay, your way. I am a Communist, too.\" So we\njoined the Communist Party, and I have a job. And, uh, I was a member of the Party 'til I left\nRomania. And I remember when I received the citizenship here in America, the guy...the\nperson from the Immigration Office\u00ae asked me, \"But you are a long time in the Communist\nParty.\" \"Yes. For a long time, I have to eat.\" \"But how come?\" And I said, \"Sir, you have a\nvery nice job here, asking me why. Do you suppose if you have this job in Romania, asking\npeople why, you can be or have the job without being a Communist Party [member]?\" And\nhe start to laugh, \"I know the story.\" So I was a full soldier. I clapped, when I have to clap.\nI have to stay ...uh, say, \"Hurray,\" when I have to say, \"Hurray.\" And that was the life. But\nafter the war, it was something interesting in my life, living in Hu_1i with a friend of mine.\nHis name is Anton Celaru. I don't know if you know him. He was a journalist working for\nInforma ia Bucure tiului for many years. We stood [NB: stayed] in. We, uh, all here with\nTiti Fierstein, we, uh, printed then a newspaper. I remember that the newspaper, the first\nnewspaper after the war in this part of the world, has reprinted in two...two hundred copies.\nAnd they sold these copy through a window; because everybody wants to have this\ncopy...uh, this newspaper. What I remember about this newspaper is that my first article--\nwhich I wrote after the \"liberation,\" [so] to say--1t was an open letter to the Major Pris_caru.\n> Tt was not Carol II who abdicated in 1947, but his son, Michael I--who became king when his\nfather fled the country in September 1940, shortly after Antonescu came to power.\n\u00b0 Immigration and Naturalization Service (also: INS).\nDo you remember I told you, from this gendarme. I said, \"I feel like I have the duty to wrote\nto you, and to thank you now for your humanity. For the human feelings. When we are\ndown, we are nobodies, you told us you can't eat as long as you know that we are hungry.\nSo I am writing this letter to you.\" I...I didn't know if he is alive. I didn't know where he 1s.\nThe story is that people from Hu_1, who after I left the ci...my city, they find him. And they\nask him to come to...to live with them. But this is another story. So, uh, I come in\nBucharest. I had a job in the Ministr...in the Department of Art. And I was sent in a city\nLugoj, in Banat [region], uh, being a Concierge Cultural--a cultural counsellor. I don't know\nwhat. After then, I was, uh, brought back in Bucharest. I give, I...I receive a...a...an\n\"advancement\" [promotion], how to say it; and, uh, I was General Inspector. I work with\nOctav Livezeanu and Eduard Mezinceascu. And, uh, after then, I was, uh, a kind of manager\nof the Department of the Cultural Houses from the city...the Commitee Culturale, how to\nsay; and, uh, I worked a lot of time there. Suddenly, they remember me. And they say,\n\"Hey, hey! Just a minute! Who was your father?\" \"My father was a vineyard [NB:\nvintner].\" \"So you don't have a ...you don't have a...a sound origin. You don't have...you are\nnot...you are not a friend of ours. You are...you are just a com...a road companion.\" And\nthey...they fire me. And I was without job, with...being a Communist, a member of the\nCommunist Party, without a job. And [they're] telling me that I...[...1 am...] am an enemy of\nthe people. Later...later on, I receive a job--the Department of Agriculture. I said, \"I don't\nhave nothing common with this. I...[ don't know nothing about this.\" So I have to have this\njob for a good part of my life. And, uh, because I didn't have nothing in common, with,\nuh...and I couldn't find a job in the Ministry--the Department of the Culture. They didn't\nwant to give me back the job. I found a job as a Secretary Literary was a...with a...with the\ncircus, which I worked. And kind of a period of time. And they built the new building of\nthe circus; I was the director of there--of this building, of this hall of activity, of cultural\nactivities there. And after then, I moved to, uh... was General Secretary of the...of the\npublishing house of the Tourism, with Pop Simion was the director at this period of time. I\ndon't know if you know some...something about Pop Simion. A nice man. After then, I said\nto myself, \"I build enough socialism. The socialism is blowing in Romania; and [it] can\nblow without me, too.\" So what I have to do? To emigrate, it was not easy.\nBecause we had some familial problems with the parents of my wife; so we couldn't leave\nthe country. But I didn't want; I considered I built enough socialism. So one day, see, I said\nto myself, \"I am sick. Not just tired.\" So I managed--paying a good money--to be retired as\nbeing a sick man; and from this position, after a couple of years, I emigrate to America.",
        "[A: | Okay. So I immigrate to America. I have this point...) [TEXT IN PRECEDING\nBRACKETS NOT ON VIDEOTAPE]\nTAPE #2",
        "A: You know, I...I tried to recollect this period of time. It's... You know, never...I didn't think\nnever about this. But it was a kind of explosion. A kind of rejoice. You have to understand,\nfrom a psychological point of view, this situation of this specially of the young people.\nSuddenly, from the bottom of the society, you were somebody. You have to have...you\ncan...have the opportunity to have a job. You have a certain position--a certain position\nwhich you can never dream to have. You are a human being, too. You walk on the street,\nand people salute you. And I remember something which I like to tell you. There is\nsomething which I just forgot. One evening, I walked with a friend of mine. A girl. As\nusual in the center of a small city, everybody know each other. And walking on the street,\nthat was a group of three or four boys--old hooligans. I know them. And they saw me\ncoming with the girl. And they blocked my...my, uh... I... couldn't go through them. It was\nonly one way to do this--just to to go around them. In the same way in which I did all my\nlife. And I said [to myself], \"This...now, I don't want to do this.\" And I said, \"Sorry. I have\nto go through.\" And they parted, and I went through them. It was the first time in my life\nthen when I said, \"I am somebody. You can't stop me.\" It was for a short period of time.\nAfter then, I learned my lesson. The same Janet with another haircut, in Romania. But\nanyway, it was a very...very interesting period of time. People get married. (Laughter)\nEverybody wants to ...to get married, to...to have a family, to be together. Uh, everybody\nis...uh, a lot of people went to Bucharest, or to Ia_1, to start to...to study. We worked there\nin...1n...1n our city. We have our friends. Myself, I...[...1 thought I have to...to...to get to get\nmarried. But that happens like in life...as in life. And I didn't do this then. So it was a very\ninteresting period of time. But shortly, a lot of things changed. People there are poor. They\nare poor. The ...the war paid... Everybody paid a great fee in this war. So, uh, nobody had\nan opportunity to do something to improve the life, of condition.\nAnd the meantime, Moldavia was st...st... striken...strucken by a, uh, drought. It was a\nfantastic famine in Moldavia. So when...when we... I was in Hu_i and Bucharest; from\nleaving Hu_1, I tried to send something to my parents. But it wasn't enough. It was a very\nhigh inflation in Romania. Everybody had...has to pay million. They...they print\nmill...paper--bills, money--for five million leu.\u2019 Only, for five million you can buy nothing.\nAbsolutely nothing. So it was a very hard period of time in Romania. And the famine, and\nthe people there are go...going from one part of the country to another part of the country.\n\u2019 Unit of Romanian currency.\nAnd I remember when I received my first job, in March 19...in 1989 [NB: 1949], in Lugo},\nin Banat [region]. In Banat, it wasn't famine. It happens it was a luckier... luckier part of the\nRomania. And I went to a restaurant and I asked to give me something, some, uh...some\nfood. I couldn't eat, because it was period of time when I didn't [have] what to eat in\nBucharest. And so it...1t was a very hard situation in Romania. Very hard. I don't talk about\nthe political situation; because from the political point of view, it was start to be hard from\nthe end of 1980...1948 and beginning of 1989 [NB: 1949]. It was a period of changement,\nfrom the political point of view. But as individual, it was hard to live in Romania. We didn't\nhave what to eat. So for me, when ...when...when my boss in the Department of Arts told\nme, \"Where do you want to go to have a job in province?\" I said, \"Everywhere it's\nsomething to eat!\" So they send me to Lugoj, which is a heaven for me.",
        "A: Arrival in United States?",
        "A: We arrived...we arrived on the...on the October 27 or 29-- something like this. In the fall.\nHey, it's interesting, what I...what I felt for the first time. Uh, we, uh...we, uh...I, uh...we\nreceive a... We are transferred from Kennedy Airport to, uh, La...LaGuardia Airport; and I\nreceived a room in a motel. It was hot. It was stuffy. No air. And as a Romanian, I went to\nopen the doors. But the door, it was locked. I went to open the window. The windows there\nare locked. And I said, \"Where in Hell you can have a little bit of fresh air in America?\"\nAnd my daughter said, \"Look, you have the air conditioner. Turn the air conditioner, you\nhave fresh air.\" It was my first contact in America. But before all this, the man from the\nCustomer [NB: Customs], he opened .... I brought from the American Embassy from Paris\na... a yellow envelope. And the lady from the Ame...from Embassy from Paris told me,\n\"You have to give... Uh, don't open this envelope; because you have...there are very\nimportant documents here. And, uh, you have to give to the Custom.\" And I give the\nenvelope to the Custom, and they open the...the...the envelope. And he gave to me, to my\nwife and to my daughter my...our \"green card.\" And he said, \"You are a resident in America,\nand you are all welcome here.\" So I, as an American resident coming there in America.\nBecause we came to be unified with our family. Uh, I remember, regarding our arrival here\nin, uh...J remember that I had a discussion with the director from HIAS from Paris--a certain\nSchwartz (ph). Gentleman Schwartz. And he told me once, \"You have... you'll have\nproblems to accommodate in America. But don't be...don't worry. Go to Boston. You'll find\nthere people there who they are not related with you. They'll help you. They don't let you\ndown.\" I looked to this man. And I said, \"Maybe he knows what he's talking about.\" But I\nwas... was very afraid.\nLater on, when I wrote and I published my last book, Moshe Kopf and His World, I wrote a\nshort story about this encounter with the man with a straight face. Uh, I think I said it's a\ntribute. I remember my social worker--a lady. He [NB: she] has a small...a small office in\nBoston, in the Jewish Family [Services]. And I talked to her so many times. And I\nsays...every time when I left from this office, I said to myself, \"If somebody has the\nopportunity to record the echoes of the voices who talk to this lady [in] this small office, it'll\nbe a universe of human sufferings!\" And I said, \"I have to pay [NB: repay] this something\nfor this lady.\" And my first publish...published, uh, piece which I wrote, 1t was an open letter\nto this lady--\"The Unseen Diploma.\" She had behind her her diploma as social worker. But\nI talked about her soul, her wonderful, uh, human feelings. So I wrote a piece, which is in\nmy book, too--\"The Unseen Diploma.\" And there are a lot of people who tried to help us.\nAnd with my broken English, when I start to talk to people everybody's saying, \"Oh, your\nEnglish is very good!\" I know how good is my English. (Chuckling) But I know those\npeople try to understand us. They give us shelter. They give us food. They give us hope.\nYou understand...have to understand something. I discover my identity, not living in\nRomania so many years. I didn't left Romania a young man. I don't want to say I'm a old\n[man] now, but I wasn't young then. I discovered my.... I suffered like a Jew in Romania;\nbut I didn't know I am Jew, because I never considered. I was a Romanian! Here, I discover\nI am Jew. And I discover the whole story about the Holocaust, and what happened in\nRomania. Here, in the United States. You know, I had a job at Boston University.\nBeing here in America, I said--and I...I didn't have [a job]--\"Without a language and a good English,\nwhat I can do? The only thing which I can do is to be a kind of a bookkeeper or accountant, or\nsomething like this.\" So I attended a university course, which I finished with A+. And I have a\ndiploma in accounting. So I was in accounting, but I am a writer by profession. So each...each\nlunch time, every day...absolutely every day in my lunch time, I went to the library and make\nresearch in trying to find out about the Romania, Romanian Jew, Romanian history, and so on.\nSo...so I start to write my book, The Forgotten Holocaust.\u201d This book is not my book. Each line,\neach word, each page--I did it. I written...I write it. But this doesn't belong to me. It's the book of\nmy generation, of my people. And being here in America, I had opportunity to read it...to write this.\nLiving so many years in Romania and going so many years in the library of that academy in\nRomania, making research from my books which I wrote there, I never think about it. Because\nnobody give me the opportunity to see a newspaper, a piece of paper regarding this period of time.\nSo if somebody is...can accept this euphemism \"born in the second time,\" I am born.... I emigrate,\nbecause being a Jew in Romania.... Here in America that I discovered [myself] to be a Jew, living\nhere in America. This is...1t was something which which I can't forget. It is not to...to say, \"Thank\n* 1.C. Butnaru, The Silent Holocaust: Romania and Its Jews (New York: Greenwood Press,\n1992).\nyou, America. You did this, so and so.\" This relationship between me and America, it is another\nkind.\nA kind of a... And I have to tell you something. My character...my character, uh, Moshe Kopf, in\nmy last book, he used to live in Romania. And he has to exp...to ...to talk to somebody, to express\nhimself; but he was afraid. So he wrote a letter to himself. And the second part of my book, when\nhe lived in America [NB: Romania?] waiting for the America visa, he wrote to a friend of, uh, him\nletters in Romania. Arriving in America, he wrote letter to the same le....uh, friend. And it 1s a letter\nwhich is very important to this problem--me and America. My relationship with the United States.\nMoshe Kopf, walking in New York one day, met a very interesting person--Christoforus Columbus.\nAnd he start to...they start to walk, to talk together. And Moshe Kopf said to...to...to Christopher\nColumbus, \"You know, Master, you did a great job discovering America. But, you know, if you are\ndoing something to be good, you have to do it in a right time. You discovered America too late!\"\nAnd Christopher Columbus asked him, \"What means, 'too late.\"\" \"Of course it is too late! If you\ndiscovered America when the Jew were liberated by Moshe [NB: Moses] from their...their slavery\n... Slave situation in Egypt, instead of cross the Red Mer [NB: Red Sea], you can part the water in the\nAtlantic here. He is ...\". How to say? \"He knowed how to do the job. He can part the water in the\nAtlantic, and the Jew can arrive in America. And he can avoid so much persecution, blood, and\ntears, and so on.\" And Christopher Columbus said to him, \"Maybe you're right. Who knows?\" And\nhe depart from him, and he go back on his, uh, pedestal. Moshe Kopf, leaving Christopher\nColumbus, he thought...he said. And Christopher said, \"Come back. I want to tell you something.\nGo back and discover your America. I discovered a territory which is America. But everybody\nwho is arriving on this shore has to discover his own America. Two Americas are not the same.\"\nNo sir. I discovered my America here. And I am very grateful for this.",
