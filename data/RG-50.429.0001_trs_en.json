        "Q: ....name, date of birth.",
        "A: Milton Green, and I\u2019m 82 years old and I was born in Lowell,\nMassachusetts but we moved to Lowell when I was about five years old\nto Brookline, Mass. And we went to temple, I went to Temple Israel in\nBoston since I was about five years old till even now.",
        "Q: ... growing up, family, religious background.",
        "A: Yes, I moved to, to Brookline in 1925 and I have a twin sister anda\nbrother and another sister. And we lived in Brookline and I went to\nTemple Israel which is a Reform temple and the head of that temple\nwas Rabbi Levy, was a well known rabbi in those days and it\u2019s a\nReform temple. And my parents were quite religious and I was\nactually bar mitzvahed at a temple in Brookline and also went to\nTemple Israel.\nAnd we observed all the holidays or most of the holidays but\nspecifically we weren\u2019t really terribly religious. We didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t\nhave kosher set up and all but we always went at different holidays,\nRosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur and we still do. But our religious\ntraining was, was moderate. And I went to school at Brookline and it\nwas a grammar school called Edward Devotion School and us that\u2019s\nwhen I started to be interested in track and I was captain of the\nerammar school track team.\nAnd the principal of the school was named Charles Taylor and he was\nvery interested in my athletic activities and he really encouraged me\nespecially in track. \u2018Cause in those days I held a record in high jump\nwhen I was eleven years old. And he was sort of sponsoring me in all\nactivities. And then I went to high school and I was captain of the\ntrack team there. And held quite a few records in the interscholastic\nmeets and that was in 19382.\nAnd then I went Exeter Academy for one year in preparation to go to\nHarvard and while I was at Harvard, I, well I was at a summer camp\nrather in 1932. I met this Norman Carnis who eventually became my\nroommate and he was an outstanding track athlete too. He was a\nhammer thrower and also a hundred yard dash runner.\nAnd in 1935 there was a Harvard-Yale track team that competed in\nLondon against Oxford-Cambridge and Norman Carnis was a hammer\nthrower mostly at that time. And they didn\u2019t have the hammer throw\nin the Oxford-Cambridge meet so he trained in the 100, 220 and made\nthe team in the hundred and the 220 which was an unusual\ncombination, a hammer thrower and a hundred year dash. And I was\nin the, in three events. At the Oxford-Cambridge meet.\nThat was in 1985 in the high hurdles, the low hurdles, and the running\nbroad jump. It was called broad jump that time but it\u2019s called the long\njump now. And I won two events at the Oxford-Cambridge meet. And\nwe, I\u2019ve been always thinking and wanting to be in the Olympics. And\nof course that was my hope to be in the Olympics but in 19386 in the\nHarvard-Yale game, the Harvard-Yale track meet, Carnis and myself\nhad won six of, six gold medals between us.\nAnd there was quite a bit of publicity about it and about our Olympic\nplans and whether we were going to the Olympics or whether we could\nqualify. And I had qualified for the final tryouts in Randall Island. And\nI got a certificate from Avery Brundage and I think I had submitted to\nyour group the certificate from Avery Brundage saying that I had\nqualified for the final tryouts.",
        "Q: ... without mentioning the museum, got the certificate.",
        "A: Yes, I had, I received a certificate from the American Olympic\ncommittee. Avery Brundage. And it stated that I had qualified through\nall the preliminary tryouts for the final tryouts at Randall Island. And\nabout at that time, there was some publicity in the Boston papers\nabout my roommate and me, Norman Carnis and myself. There was a\npicture of us winning six gold medals.\nAnd some of the executives or the committee members at Temple\nIsrael and Rabbi Levy had seen the publicity and knew that we were\npotential Olympic candidates. And one of the committee members\ncalled me and said he would like, congratulated me for our\nperformance at the Harvard-Yale track meet. And said that Rabbi\nLevy would like to talk to us about the Olympics and the potential\nthere. And could we meet with him. And we met with him. At Temple\nIsrael.\nAnd they explained to us what was happening in Germany at that\ntime. The terrible things that were going on and all the activities\nagainst the Jews and people in Germany. And we, we sort of knew\nsomething about the problem of ( +) but not in any great details. And\nwere really quite taken aback with information that they gave to us.\nAnd then he, and at that time it was suggested that it might be a good\nidea for us not to go to the Olympics. Because of all this, these\nproblems that sort of register our objections and sort of boycotting the\nOlympics.\nAnd we were quite taken aback about that thought. They tried to\nexplain to us that we would never regret if we did take that action, to\nboycott the Olympics and they suggested that we talk it over and let\nthem know what, what our thoughts were, if we wanted any further\ndiscussion. And we, Norman Carnis and I went back and talked it over\nand thought we had discussed it with our parents as we had great\nrespect for their judgment.\nAnd after talking it over with our parents, they also called Rabbi Levy\nto see what his thoughts were again. To get an explanation from him.\nAnd my father told me that he was satisfied and had confidence in\nRabbi Levy\u2019s judgment and that we wouldn\u2019t regret it if we did boycott\nthe Olympics. Of course the problem was, not the problem but the\nquestion was we, you know how imminent our selection onto the\nOlympic team would be.\nAnd I held the world\u2019s record in the high hurdles and also the Harvard-\nYale record in the broad jump. And at that time and the Harvard-Yale\nbroad jump event which I held the record in was over 24 feet, 11\ninches. And I had been running in three events at that track meet and\nthe coach said not to take too many jumps because I had to save myself\nfor the other events.\nAnd on the first try on the broad jump I had fouled the take off,\nstepped over the mark. And he said to be very careful on the next jump\nbecause he didn\u2019t want me to take all my full jumps. So on the next\njump I was very careful and took off about a foot behind the take off\nboard and I did 24 feet 11, so I was close to 26 feet in the actual jump.\nAnd they thought that I could, had a good chance of qualifying for the\nOlympics in the long jump. Where I had the potential to go close to 26\nfeet. And in the high hurdles, which was the other event that I was,\nhad qualified for, I had been running around 14, 9, 15 seconds in the\nhigh hurdles and the qualifying times were in the 14 second, probably\n14, 2, or 3, but I was improving in the high hurdles and I practiced\ntiming event, timing in the high hurdle practice rounds and I was\ngetting closer to the 14, 5, 14, 4. And they felt that there was a good\nchance that I could make the team in maybe two events. But at any\nrate, after the discussion with Rabbi Levy and my parents and this\nwhole situation about boycotting, both Carnis and I decided that we\nwould boycott the Olympics and we didn\u2019t go into the finial tryouts.\nAnd although I was disappointed I felt that that was the thing to do\nand that\u2019s what basically happened, as far as boycotting the Olympics\n[were] concerned because that time I was a senior at Harvard and I\nwas interested in getting into business and whether to go into business\nright away, after graduation which was in 19386 or to go to graduate\nschool. And now I decided to go to Harvard Business School and then\ngo into the real estate business.\nSo I was interested in looking, I was always interested in athletics.\nAnd I knew that I was a pretty good athlete and as I say I was captain\nof all the track teams since I was in grammar school. But my focus\nafter getting out of college was not, had nothing to do really with\nathletics, although I was interested in all athletics and tennis and\nskiing and all the other activities. But I decided to go to the Harvard\nBusiness School and then to go into business in the real estate\nbusiness.\nAnd that\u2019s what happened and I was interested in, you know, finding a\nnice gal and getting married too. So that\u2019s the basic course that I\nfollowed. And after I got out of the business school I participated in\ntennis. And I was ranked number six in New England in the super\nsenior category so I was always interested in athletics but that\u2019s really\nthe basic story about what happened in the situation.",
        "Q: ...elaborate on some of those points...came from a Jewish background,\nidentified as a Jewish boy.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, absolutely. My mother and father as say were Reform at\nthat time. When I moved to Brookline in 1925. But their parents were\nvery religious, my mother\u2019s parents particularly because my father\u2019s\nparents weren't around at that time. But my mother\u2019s parents, the\nname was Waburn and they were very religious and we used to go over\nto their home, to their apartment and celebrate all the Jewish\nholidays. And as I say they were very religious and my parents were\nreligious but they were Reform.",
        "Q: What about your friends, were your friends mixed or did you really\nerow up 1n a more Jewish environment?",
        "A: I'd say that I grew up basically in a mixed environment. After we lived\nin Brookline, in 1929 we moved to Newton. And I went to Newton High\nSchool. In those days it wasn\u2019t too integrated. And my friends, I\u2019d say\nwere 50/50 Jewish and non-Jewish and so our upper\u2019 _~was [difficult to\nfigure out what was missing here], was mixed but our social activities\nwere mostly Jewish activities.",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism from your classmates or people\nwhen you were growing up?",
        "A: Not particularly. High school, never noticed any. I knew it was around\nand there were situations but in college, at Harvard we lived Carnis\nand I lived in Lowell House. And they had common room eating and we\nmixed with all of the, everyone there and we, we never noticed any\nparticular anti-Semitism. But we knew it existed. But we were never\nparticularly subjected to it.",
        "Q: Do you think that sports in your early athletic career provided a good\nopportunity for you to fit into the main stream and move beyond your\nJewish environment.",
        "A: I never particularly thought of it in that way. But it was the focus that\nyou know put us in contact with all the...",
        "Q: ... start the sentence by saying sports or athletics was the focus so that\nyou say the subject in the sentence...",
        "A: Oh yeah, I see. You know sports and athletics were a focus. Because as\nI say I was captain of the team so I was, did pretty well in all the\nevents. While it was a focus and I enjoyed it, it wasn\u2019t 100 percent\nfocus. But I trained carefully and did all the training that the coaches\nhad suggested but I would say it was a focus but not 100 percent so.",
        "Q: And you mentioned that you had worked toward going to the Olympics.\nWas that a real serious possibility in your mind?",
        "A: Yes, it was. Going to the Olympics was a very serious focus at that\ntime and it was a focus on training and doing extra training and\nexercises too and I was watching the performances all over the world,\nin my particular events, particularly. And yes it was something that I\nwas always thinking about when I was training and I had hoped to\nmake the Olympic team.",
        "Q: So it must have been somewhat disappointing when, even though it\nwas your choice, you weren't going to participate.",
        "A: It was my boycotting the Olympics through the meetings I had with\nRabbi Levy, yes I was, I was disappointed. And felt that that focus that\nI had had all these years was going to materialize but somehow or\nanother I felt that it was the right thing to do and I never had any\nregrets about it one way or another.",
        "Q: What gave you that moral grounding?",
        "A: Well I don\u2019t think the moral grounding in relation to that was not\nreally a basic factor. I don\u2019t think it had anything to do with moral\nerounding. It was just a realization that was something that should be\ndone and I had great respect for Rabbi Levy because prior to our\nmeeting with him, although I had heard about the problems in\nGermany and what was going on, I didn\u2019t really have a detailed\nunderstanding of the problems there and that meeting was really a\nshocker to both Carnis and myself. And it struck home to me that that\nwas something I wanted to do after they explained the situation.",
        "Q: You talk about this meeting. Can you go into more detail about what\nthey said to you and what helped you make this choice?",
        "A: Well the meeting with Rabbi Levy was at the Temple Israel executive\nboardroom. And we weren't sure what he was going to tell us about\nwhat was happening in Germany. But the several board members of\nthe men\u2019s committee and the rabbi went into pretty good detail. But I\ndon\u2019t remember all the items that they discussed particularly, but they\ntold us about the terrible things that were going on in Germany and\nthe Nazi regime. And it was a shocker to me and Norman Carnis and it\njust struck home that 1t was something that we should do or consider\ndoing. But I don\u2019t remember particularly all the gory details that they\nwent into.",
        "Q: Do you remember any of the details?",
        "A: Not really. Something about book burning and taking away the rights\nof the Jews and putting them in ghettos and I suppose it was \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember it was that time or afterwards, but they mentioned about\nthe killing of Jews. And then all those details were pretty repulsive to\nUS.",
        "Q: Were there at that point to your knowledge, press statements or public\nstatements about boycotting and about Germany?",
        "A: Yes there were. There was publicity about the boycotting and\ndiscussions between the Olympic Committee and there were some\nother groups that were, had mentioned in the press about they should\nboycott the Olympics. And there were other groups that said they\nshouldn\u2019t boycott the Olympics so I was just aware that there was a\ndiscussion going on about boycotting but I wasn\u2019t aware of all the\ndetails involved.",
        "Q: Were you aware of other athletes who were considering boycotting?",
        "A: Not particularly. I did, I wasn\u2019t aware of any other athletes that I\nknew of and I wouldn\u2019t be in contact with them other than through\npublicity in the papers. But I remember something about Stoller and\nthose track athletes that were questioning about going to the Olympics\nbut I don\u2019t particularly remember the time frame in connection with\nthat but I do remember the discussion about it.",
        "Q: Did the press and some of these organizations who were talking about\nboycotting influence you or....",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t think the press or the publicity influenced me one way or\nthe other because I wasn\u2019t aware at that time in any great detail of the\nproblems going on in Germany and the Nazis with the Jews. I knew\nthere were problems and it was serious but I wasn\u2019t aware of all the\ndetails.",
        "Q: When you decided to boycott was this primarily to take a stand or was\nthere any concern about your safety in going over there?",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t worried at all about safety but the reason I boycotted it\nwas entirely a result of the meeting with Rabbi Levy. That was the\nessential dominant factor involved.",
        "Q: Did you consider this a substantial sacrifice on your part? I mean you\nhad been working for this for a long time.",
        "A: Well boycotting the Olympics was a sacrifice because I had always\nwanted to be in the Olympics but I didn\u2019t consider it as, once we made\nup our mind and I was aware of what was going on there, I didn\u2019t look\nat it particularly as a sacrifice, although it was. But I didn\u2019t consider it\na terrible blow.",
        "Q: Once you made the decision to boycott, were you asked to or did you\nmake any public statements in an effort to influence other people?",
        "A: No. We never made any public statements or indicated what steps we\nhad taken.",
        "Q: When you were in a pretty high profile position. You were captain of\nvarsity track in Harvard, I\u2019m surprised that someone didn\u2019t come to\nyou and say will you speak out for this boycott.",
        "A: Well after we boycotted the Olympics, no one came to speak to us or\nask us if we'd make any statement about it and I don\u2019t think anyone\nknew particularly that we did boycott it. Cause there was no publicity\nabout it one way or the other. The only publicity we had was when I\nspoke to the track coach at Harvard. His name was Yacko Macola. He\nwas the assistant coach but he was the \u2014 1n 19386 he was the track\ncoach, and we told him about our intention and he tried to persuade us\nnot to do it. He said he didn\u2019t think we\u2019d do much good and we should\ntry to go to the final tryouts and try to make the team. But we didn\u2019t\nwant to do that. And that was the only conversation we really had\nabout it, publicity wise.",
        "Q: ...ask you about where you were during the games and....[tape ended\nand new tape began with the following.] When we stopped you were\ntelling me that you and Norman Carnis, your roommate went and told\nyour Harvard track coach of your decision.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Can you expand upon that a little?",
        "A: We, I went to see the track coach, Norman Carnis didn't.",
        "Q: Let me rephrase that.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: You went and told your coach who you had been working with at\nHarvard of your decision.",
        "A: Yes, I told Yacko Macola. I went to see him and told him that we had\ndecided not to go into the final tryouts.",
        "Q: ...say that again...",
        "A: Well I went to see, to tell my track coach at Harvard, Yacko Macola,\nthat we weren't going to go into the final tryouts and told him the\nreason that we had spoken to our religious leader, Rabbi Levy, and\nthat we had decided because of the situation that we were told about\nthat we weren't going to go to the final tryouts and he was quite\ndisturbed \u2014 not disturbed but felt that we should really go ahead and\nwe ve always wanted to be in the Olympics and he thought we had,\nthat I had a great chance to qualify in two events. And that we, that I\nshould really try to change my mind about going to the final tryouts\nbut he didn\u2019t persuade us, persuade me rather. And that was the\nextent of the discussion with Yacko Macola, the coach.",
        "Q: Did other colleagues of yours on the track team at Harvard go the\nOlympics or go to at least the final tryouts?",
        "A: None that I know of. There was no one else that had qualified for the\nfinal tryouts from Harvard, except me. And I had no discussion with\nthem at that time. We were, I think, having final exams and\neraduation around June 10* or 12*h and I had no discussion with\nanyone about the final tryouts.",
        "Q: You were focused on sports; you were focused on your scholarship. You\nreally weren't at that point \u2014 it doesn\u2019t sound like that focused on being\nJewish. And yet this meeting at your Temple was very compelling to\nyou.",
        "A: Well, no, I was focused on being Jewish. I was focused on being Jewish\nbecause I felt loyal and loyalty to Judaism and I had no, we had\ncontact with non-Jews in college and everything but that wasn\u2019t a\nproblem as far as I was concerned.",
        "Q: Let me ask you where you were at the time of the games?",
        "A: At the time of the Olympic games I was working at a summer camp as\na counselor up in Maine, up in Waterville, Maine. It was called Cedar\nCrest Camp. And I don\u2019t think they had television at that time or they\ndidn\u2019t have it at the camp. But I remember of course eagerly reading\nthe papers on the results and figuring out the times that they were\nwinning the events in and the distances in the long jump. So I was\nfollowing it very carefully but I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t remember seeing them\nactually on TV, but I did later on, on the re-runs.",
        "Q: What about newsreels in the movie houses, anything like that?",
        "A: Well we didn\u2019t go to the movies at camp.",
        "Q: The radio?",
        "A: Yeah, I think we had, I think there was a radio we were listening to> I\ndon\u2019t remember what the time factor was between the events and the\ntime zone in Waterville, Maine.",
        "Q: Do you remember how you felt as you were following the Olympics?\nWistful?",
        "A: Yeah, I was, I was thinking about how it would have been to have been\nrunning in those events and now whether I could have been a medal\nwinner and I was thinking in those terms but I didn\u2019t focus as far as\nactually winning the event at that time.",
        "Q: Were you sorry you weren't there?",
        "A: I suppose in a way I was because as I say I had been thinking about it\nfor all those years, so I was in a way feeling that if I could have made\nthe team and | thought I could that I would have liked to have been in\nthat Olympic setting.",
        "Q: Isn\u2019t the Olympics a real dream? What does it mean to you?",
        "A: Well now that\u2019s the peak of training or one of the peaks, one of the\nobjectives to be in the Olympics as I\u2019ve gone to a lot of the Olympics to\nsee it myself. In Los Angeles and in Korea and I\u2019m going to the\nOlympics in Atlanta this summer with my grandchildren and I always\nwatch those track events with great interest.",
        "Q: Did you feel any resentment about the other athletes who chose to\ncompete, especially the Jewish ones?",
        "A: No, I had no feelings about the Jewish athletes that competed. I didn\u2019t\nknow them number one, but I had no feelings one way or the other\nabout their competing, I mean that was up to them and I had no\nresentment at all about those that did go.",
        "Q: Do you think the American government should have made more of a\nstand?",
        "A: In retrospect, I certainly do. I think they should have definitely\nboycotted.",
        "Q: I need you to say the American government.",
        "A: Well as far as the boycott is concerned, I think the American\ngovernment definitely should have boycotted the Olympics in Berlin\njust like they boycotted the Russian Olympics and now they would\nhave all the more of the facts than I ever had and I think it was\ndefinitely a mistake that they didn\u2019t boycott the Olympics in 1936.",
        "Q: Do you think it would have made a difference?",
        "A: Yes, I think it would have made a great difference to have the\nAmerican government show their opposition to what was going on over\nthere in the Nazi regime. I think they made a serious mistake not to\nboycott it and I know that there was a lot of talk pro and against the,\nboycotting the Olympics. But I think this is a result more in retrospect\nrather than at the time. But as I think of it now, I definitely think it\nwas a mistake not to boycott it.",
        "Q: Did you feel at all alone in your decision, as you were following the\ngames?",
        "A: Well I had no recollection particularly of what my feelings were at that\ntime in 1936. But it wasn\u2019t any great feeling that I had cause once I\nmade up my mind and felt that it should be that I should go or try for\nthe final tryouts, I didn\u2019t lose any sleep over that decision.",
        "Q: It\u2019s really hard for me to imagine that you had been training, that this\nwas a real dream of yours and you made this decision for all of the\nright reasons but that you weren't a little bit torn apart by it.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t, as I remember it, I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t remember being\nparticularly torn apart. No, I had a longing and a desire to have been\nin it, but I didn\u2019t have as I look back on it, I don\u2019t remember having\nany terrible regrets for having made the decision.",
        "Q: Never a second thought?",
        "A: Never a second thought on it.",
        "Q: Now let me ask you a sort of a different question. I think you made a\npretty bold and moral decision, however you want to phrase it in 19386.\nDo you think as you look back on the times since then, do you think\nthat that decision impacted the way you live your life or taught you an\nimportant lesson or really meant something very special?",
        "A: Well my decision not to participate in the final tryouts, I don\u2019t think\nhad any great impact on my future one way or the other. I mean I\nparticipate in athletics and as I said, I was pretty lucky to be\nperforming and held the world\u2019s record and Harvard records and was\nin the Harvard Hall of Fame for athletes and it had no particular\nimpact one way or the other.",
        "Q: Did it encourage you when there were other tough decisions to take the\nhigh road. Did you learn anything from it?",
        "A: Well no, I don\u2019t think, I mean I felt good that I made the decision. But I\ndon\u2019t, as I said I don\u2019t think it had any impact as far as my future\nactivities or living or philosophies were concerned. It had no great\nimpact one way or the other.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a long time ago. Do you ever think back on that period and what\nyou went through at the time?",
        "A: Yeah, I think back on making that decision and whether I would have\non or not \u2014 silver or gold or some sort of a medal and every time I go to\nthe Olympics, I\u2019ve been to three of them and I watch, I particularly\nwatch the high hurdles and the long jump and I picture myself as\nmaybe having won a medal on it, an Olympic medal. But I participated\nin the Senior Olympics in 1983 in Florida. Florida Senior Olympics and\nI won ten medals at that but that was not the real Olympics, that was\nthe Senior Olympics. So I, you know I\u2019ve won medals in Olympic senior\ncompetition.",
        "Q: Since that time you've heard and read a lot about the 19386 Olympics\nand the extent of the pageantry and the celebration and the\npropaganda and all of this. Do you think that sports can be separate\nfrom politics or that they\u2019re just inextricably linked in situations like\nthat?",
        "A: Well I think sports can be separated from politics. In a way they\nshould be but 1t depends on what the separation is. I mean interference\nby the government, particularly in sports, I wouldn\u2019t like to see that\nbut this 1s a, the boycotting is different, I don\u2019t consider that a mixing\nof sports and politics or a separation. I mean I think that\u2019s a moral\neround and I just think that they should have been boycotted; the U.S.\nshould have boycotted it, not because it\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s separation of those\nactivities. But I just think they should have just the way they did in\nthe Russian Olympics.",
        "Q: Germany certainly didn\u2019t separate sports and politics in 1936.",
        "A: Well I imagine they didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Thank you. I think that\u2019s all my questions but I just want to make\nsure. Tell me about how this meeting came about. Who was there, why\nthey called you in, what the atmosphere was like and what you did.",
        "A: Well I remember after the Harvard/Yale track meet, which Carnis and\nI won six gold medals there was quite a bit of publicity in the\nnewspapers and there was a picture of Carnis and myself in the sport\npage. I forget which paper it was, and saying how we'd won six gold\nmedals and I think they called us Damon and Pythias because we were\nsuch good friends.\nAbout three or four days after the track meet, I got a phone call. I\nforget what the fellow\u2019s name was but he said he was calling at the\nrequest of Rabbi Levy. And he was on the men\u2019s council of the Temple\nand he had read about what we did at the Harvard/Yale track meet.\nAnd that he understood we were contenders for the Olympics and he\nhad some important information that he\u2019d like to talk to us about at\nthe request of Rabbi Levy and as I had mentioned, Rabbi Levy was the\nhead of Temple Israel in Boston, a Reform Temple, and he was well-\nrespected all over the United States. And I was confirmed at Temple\nIsrael and naturally when they asked us to come, or asked me and\nNorman Carnis, we agreed to come and | think it was set for two or\nthree days later.",
        "Q: What was going on 1n your mind, why they had called you over?",
        "A: He said something about he wanted to talk to us about the Olympics\nand so I wasn\u2019t particularly prepared, I didn\u2019t know what they were\ngoing to talk about. Except that something about the Olympics and we\nwent to the boardroom at the Temple Israel on Commonwealth Avenue\nin Boston, that\u2019s where the Temple was at that time.\nAnd we went there and they explained about the reason they wanted\nto talk to us was in connection with what was going on in Germany.\nAnd they explained the problems that were going on there with the\nNazis and the terrible things that were happening to the Jews there\nand I don\u2019t remember the exact details of exactly what items they were\ntalking about but it was a terrible picture as I remember it and they\ndiscussed it fully and we told them that, I told them that I was\npreparing to go to the final tryouts. And that I\u2019d qualified and had to\nget prepared for it and train again and they explained to me that again\nit was a terrible situation there in Germany and they suggested that\nthey thought it would be a very good idea to boycott the Olympics and\nthey were quite sure that I'd never regret it. Even though I had my\nheard set on being in the Olympics and they suggested that you know\nit was up to me and Carnis decided what we wanted to do and so I told\nthem that we'd talk it over and let them know what we wanted to do\nand that was the basic situation as far as that meeting is concerned.",
        "Q: And they really left it up to you that decision?",
        "A: that\u2019s right, they left the decision entirely up to us. They didn\u2019t say you\nhad to or they indicated, they recommended strongly that it was the\nright thing to do and we would never regret making the decision.",
        "Q: Why was all this so compelling? You were excited, you were ready to go\nto the tryouts, the finals and that meeting really turned you around.",
        "A: Yes, that meeting really turned us around because we were horrified at\nwhat the terrible things that were going on in Germany and we just\nfelt it was the right thing to do and made up our mind to do it after as I\nsay we, I talked it over with my parents.",
        "Q: After the meeting did you go immediately home? Did you consult with\nyour parents, or your friends? What took place next?",
        "A: Well I was living at the Lowell House at Harvard at the time with\nNorm Carnis and we went back and talked it over and decided that I'd\nvo home and talk things over with my parents, they lived in Newton.\nAnd I went home and talked it over with them and as I explained, my\nfather called Rabbi Levy to find out if I had the right report.\nAnd after his discussion with Rabbi Levy, he felt that the rabbi had a\ncomplete understanding of the whole situation and he could rely on his\njudgment and that I should rely on his judgment and he said that you\nknow left it up to me but he strongly recommended that I go along with\nthe suggestion from the rabbi and the men\u2019s committee. I think the\nhead of the Men\u2019s committee I think it was a fellow named Kimler or\nsomething close to it, or Kimmel or Kemla, it\u2019s some name like that.",
        "Q: Did you follow the trials at Randalls Island?",
        "A: Yes, I followed it to see what they were doing and...",
        "Q: Begin that sentence....",
        "A: Yeah, I followed the trials at Randalls Island cause I was you know\nvery much interested but as I say, I had no regrets after deciding not to\ngo into the final tryouts.",
        "Q: When you were following those tryouts, how were your times compared\nto the times that qualified people? Would you have probably gone?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the details of the times at that time. As I recollect\nnow I think I could have made the team at two events \u2014 the long jump\nand the high hurdles. I\u2019m pretty sure I could have done it in the long\njump, I\u2019m not that certain about the high hurdles. Because it depended\non how much I improved at my timing there and really concentrating\non that event, but I don\u2019t remember the details particularly.",
        "Q: Go back for a second. When you received the certificate from Brundage\nsaying you had qualified for the finals, what was it like getting that\nletter?",
        "A: I was very pleased but I knew that I had qualified because I won the\npreliminary events and knew that the winning of those preliminary\nevents would get me into the finial tryouts but I liked the certificate\nand I was you know very pleased to have it and I framed it and kept it.",
        "Q: When you followed the games from the camp in Maine, did your\ncampers follow them with you and did they know that you were in this\nworld class...",
        "A: Yeah, they knew I was.",
        "Q: Can you say my campers?",
        "A: Yeah, when I was a Cedar Crest camp during the Olympics in 19386,\nmost of the campers knew I was a good athlete and was material for\nthe Olympics and the year before I was in the Oxford-Cambridge meet\nand there was quite a bit of publicity and they talked about it when I\ncame back to camp. So yes, there was quite a bit of talk about the\nOlympics and whether I could have gotten a medal or not.",
        "Q: A more personal way to follow the games.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: After \u201c36 you went on to graduate school.",
        "A: Yes I did.",
        "Q: Did you, during the war were you in the Army or...",
        "A: Yeah, I was. I enlisted in the Navy aviation and I was in 1943 I\nvolunteered for the Navy aviation and I was in a naval squadron which\nat that time was a scouting squadron. It was Scouting Squadron 31\nand I came in as a lieutenant junior grade which is the equivalent to a\nfirst lieutenant. And I came out in 1945 as a lieutenant commander\nand our...",
        "Q: Overseas and all?",
        "A: Our squadron was an anti-submarine squadron and we were patrolling\nfor and escorting ships out of Boston harbor and Portland, Maine\nharbor. And after the VE Day we were sent to Norfolk, Virginia and\nour squadron was being prepared to go out to the Pacific. And I wasn\u2019t\na part of it but I was what they call an air combat intelligence officer.\nAnd then the war ended, while I was in Norfolk and about a year, six\nmonths later I guess it was. So I was in the service in the Navy from\n\"42 I guess to \u201946.",
        "Q: At what point did you, after \u201886, at what point did you start, when did\nyou start learning about what was unfolding in Europe?",
        "A: Well I followed the war very carefully, of the campaigns in North\nAfrica and all the different campaigns and was watching it very\ncarefully. But I wasn\u2019t particularly aware of any more activities in\nNazi Germany at that particular time other than what was going on in\nthe papers.",
        "Q: Did you know about Kristallnacht?",
        "A: Yeah, I remember reading about that and all the terrible things that\nwere happening there and that revolted me tremendously.",
        "Q: Did you feel vindicated in your decision?",
        "A: I never looked at it in that vein; I never looked at it in the idea I was\nvindicated or not vindicated. Because I felt it was the right thing to do\nwhen I made that decision. I didn\u2019t think it was in any other terms.\nTHE END\n"

        "A: Milton Green, and I\u2019m 82 years old and I was born in Lowell,\nMassachusetts but we moved to Lowell when I was about five years old\nto Brookline, Mass. And we went to temple, I went to Temple Israel in\nBoston since I was about five years old till even now.",
        "A: Yes, I moved to, to Brookline in 1925 and I have a twin sister anda\nbrother and another sister. And we lived in Brookline and I went to\nTemple Israel which is a Reform temple and the head of that temple\nwas Rabbi Levy, was a well known rabbi in those days and it\u2019s a\nReform temple. And my parents were quite religious and I was\nactually bar mitzvahed at a temple in Brookline and also went to\nTemple Israel.\nAnd we observed all the holidays or most of the holidays but\nspecifically we weren\u2019t really terribly religious. We didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t\nhave kosher set up and all but we always went at different holidays,\nRosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur and we still do. But our religious\ntraining was, was moderate. And I went to school at Brookline and it\nwas a grammar school called Edward Devotion School and us that\u2019s\nwhen I started to be interested in track and I was captain of the\nerammar school track team.\nAnd the principal of the school was named Charles Taylor and he was\nvery interested in my athletic activities and he really encouraged me\nespecially in track. \u2018Cause in those days I held a record in high jump\nwhen I was eleven years old. And he was sort of sponsoring me in all\nactivities. And then I went to high school and I was captain of the\ntrack team there. And held quite a few records in the interscholastic\nmeets and that was in 19382.\nAnd then I went Exeter Academy for one year in preparation to go to\nHarvard and while I was at Harvard, I, well I was at a summer camp\nrather in 1932. I met this Norman Carnis who eventually became my\nroommate and he was an outstanding track athlete too. He was a\nhammer thrower and also a hundred yard dash runner.\nAnd in 1935 there was a Harvard-Yale track team that competed in\nLondon against Oxford-Cambridge and Norman Carnis was a hammer\nthrower mostly at that time. And they didn\u2019t have the hammer throw\nin the Oxford-Cambridge meet so he trained in the 100, 220 and made\nthe team in the hundred and the 220 which was an unusual\ncombination, a hammer thrower and a hundred year dash. And I was\nin the, in three events. At the Oxford-Cambridge meet.\nThat was in 1985 in the high hurdles, the low hurdles, and the running\nbroad jump. It was called broad jump that time but it\u2019s called the long\njump now. And I won two events at the Oxford-Cambridge meet. And\nwe, I\u2019ve been always thinking and wanting to be in the Olympics. And\nof course that was my hope to be in the Olympics but in 19386 in the\nHarvard-Yale game, the Harvard-Yale track meet, Carnis and myself\nhad won six of, six gold medals between us.\nAnd there was quite a bit of publicity about it and about our Olympic\nplans and whether we were going to the Olympics or whether we could\nqualify. And I had qualified for the final tryouts in Randall Island. And\nI got a certificate from Avery Brundage and I think I had submitted to\nyour group the certificate from Avery Brundage saying that I had\nqualified for the final tryouts.",
        "A: Yes, I had, I received a certificate from the American Olympic\ncommittee. Avery Brundage. And it stated that I had qualified through\nall the preliminary tryouts for the final tryouts at Randall Island. And\nabout at that time, there was some publicity in the Boston papers\nabout my roommate and me, Norman Carnis and myself. There was a\npicture of us winning six gold medals.\nAnd some of the executives or the committee members at Temple\nIsrael and Rabbi Levy had seen the publicity and knew that we were\npotential Olympic candidates. And one of the committee members\ncalled me and said he would like, congratulated me for our\nperformance at the Harvard-Yale track meet. And said that Rabbi\nLevy would like to talk to us about the Olympics and the potential\nthere. And could we meet with him. And we met with him. At Temple\nIsrael.\nAnd they explained to us what was happening in Germany at that\ntime. The terrible things that were going on and all the activities\nagainst the Jews and people in Germany. And we, we sort of knew\nsomething about the problem of ( +) but not in any great details. And\nwere really quite taken aback with information that they gave to us.\nAnd then he, and at that time it was suggested that it might be a good\nidea for us not to go to the Olympics. Because of all this, these\nproblems that sort of register our objections and sort of boycotting the\nOlympics.\nAnd we were quite taken aback about that thought. They tried to\nexplain to us that we would never regret if we did take that action, to\nboycott the Olympics and they suggested that we talk it over and let\nthem know what, what our thoughts were, if we wanted any further\ndiscussion. And we, Norman Carnis and I went back and talked it over\nand thought we had discussed it with our parents as we had great\nrespect for their judgment.\nAnd after talking it over with our parents, they also called Rabbi Levy\nto see what his thoughts were again. To get an explanation from him.\nAnd my father told me that he was satisfied and had confidence in\nRabbi Levy\u2019s judgment and that we wouldn\u2019t regret it if we did boycott\nthe Olympics. Of course the problem was, not the problem but the\nquestion was we, you know how imminent our selection onto the\nOlympic team would be.\nAnd I held the world\u2019s record in the high hurdles and also the Harvard-\nYale record in the broad jump. And at that time and the Harvard-Yale\nbroad jump event which I held the record in was over 24 feet, 11\ninches. And I had been running in three events at that track meet and\nthe coach said not to take too many jumps because I had to save myself\nfor the other events.\nAnd on the first try on the broad jump I had fouled the take off,\nstepped over the mark. And he said to be very careful on the next jump\nbecause he didn\u2019t want me to take all my full jumps. So on the next\njump I was very careful and took off about a foot behind the take off\nboard and I did 24 feet 11, so I was close to 26 feet in the actual jump.\nAnd they thought that I could, had a good chance of qualifying for the\nOlympics in the long jump. Where I had the potential to go close to 26\nfeet. And in the high hurdles, which was the other event that I was,\nhad qualified for, I had been running around 14, 9, 15 seconds in the\nhigh hurdles and the qualifying times were in the 14 second, probably\n14, 2, or 3, but I was improving in the high hurdles and I practiced\ntiming event, timing in the high hurdle practice rounds and I was\ngetting closer to the 14, 5, 14, 4. And they felt that there was a good\nchance that I could make the team in maybe two events. But at any\nrate, after the discussion with Rabbi Levy and my parents and this\nwhole situation about boycotting, both Carnis and I decided that we\nwould boycott the Olympics and we didn\u2019t go into the finial tryouts.\nAnd although I was disappointed I felt that that was the thing to do\nand that\u2019s what basically happened, as far as boycotting the Olympics\n[were] concerned because that time I was a senior at Harvard and I\nwas interested in getting into business and whether to go into business\nright away, after graduation which was in 19386 or to go to graduate\nschool. And now I decided to go to Harvard Business School and then\ngo into the real estate business.\nSo I was interested in looking, I was always interested in athletics.\nAnd I knew that I was a pretty good athlete and as I say I was captain\nof all the track teams since I was in grammar school. But my focus\nafter getting out of college was not, had nothing to do really with\nathletics, although I was interested in all athletics and tennis and\nskiing and all the other activities. But I decided to go to the Harvard\nBusiness School and then to go into business in the real estate\nbusiness.\nAnd that\u2019s what happened and I was interested in, you know, finding a\nnice gal and getting married too. So that\u2019s the basic course that I\nfollowed. And after I got out of the business school I participated in\ntennis. And I was ranked number six in New England in the super\nsenior category so I was always interested in athletics but that\u2019s really\nthe basic story about what happened in the situation.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, absolutely. My mother and father as say were Reform at\nthat time. When I moved to Brookline in 1925. But their parents were\nvery religious, my mother\u2019s parents particularly because my father\u2019s\nparents weren't around at that time. But my mother\u2019s parents, the\nname was Waburn and they were very religious and we used to go over\nto their home, to their apartment and celebrate all the Jewish\nholidays. And as I say they were very religious and my parents were\nreligious but they were Reform.",
        "A: I'd say that I grew up basically in a mixed environment. After we lived\nin Brookline, in 1929 we moved to Newton. And I went to Newton High\nSchool. In those days it wasn\u2019t too integrated. And my friends, I\u2019d say\nwere 50/50 Jewish and non-Jewish and so our upper\u2019 _~was [difficult to\nfigure out what was missing here], was mixed but our social activities\nwere mostly Jewish activities.",
        "A: Not particularly. High school, never noticed any. I knew it was around\nand there were situations but in college, at Harvard we lived Carnis\nand I lived in Lowell House. And they had common room eating and we\nmixed with all of the, everyone there and we, we never noticed any\nparticular anti-Semitism. But we knew it existed. But we were never\nparticularly subjected to it.",
        "A: I never particularly thought of it in that way. But it was the focus that\nyou know put us in contact with all the...",
        "A: Oh yeah, I see. You know sports and athletics were a focus. Because as\nI say I was captain of the team so I was, did pretty well in all the\nevents. While it was a focus and I enjoyed it, it wasn\u2019t 100 percent\nfocus. But I trained carefully and did all the training that the coaches\nhad suggested but I would say it was a focus but not 100 percent so.",
        "A: Yes, it was. Going to the Olympics was a very serious focus at that\ntime and it was a focus on training and doing extra training and\nexercises too and I was watching the performances all over the world,\nin my particular events, particularly. And yes it was something that I\nwas always thinking about when I was training and I had hoped to\nmake the Olympic team.",
        "A: It was my boycotting the Olympics through the meetings I had with\nRabbi Levy, yes I was, I was disappointed. And felt that that focus that\nI had had all these years was going to materialize but somehow or\nanother I felt that it was the right thing to do and I never had any\nregrets about it one way or another.",
        "A: Well I don\u2019t think the moral grounding in relation to that was not\nreally a basic factor. I don\u2019t think it had anything to do with moral\nerounding. It was just a realization that was something that should be\ndone and I had great respect for Rabbi Levy because prior to our\nmeeting with him, although I had heard about the problems in\nGermany and what was going on, I didn\u2019t really have a detailed\nunderstanding of the problems there and that meeting was really a\nshocker to both Carnis and myself. And it struck home to me that that\nwas something I wanted to do after they explained the situation.",
        "A: Well the meeting with Rabbi Levy was at the Temple Israel executive\nboardroom. And we weren't sure what he was going to tell us about\nwhat was happening in Germany. But the several board members of\nthe men\u2019s committee and the rabbi went into pretty good detail. But I\ndon\u2019t remember all the items that they discussed particularly, but they\ntold us about the terrible things that were going on in Germany and\nthe Nazi regime. And it was a shocker to me and Norman Carnis and it\njust struck home that 1t was something that we should do or consider\ndoing. But I don\u2019t remember particularly all the gory details that they\nwent into.",
        "A: Not really. Something about book burning and taking away the rights\nof the Jews and putting them in ghettos and I suppose it was \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember it was that time or afterwards, but they mentioned about\nthe killing of Jews. And then all those details were pretty repulsive to\nUS.",
        "A: Yes there were. There was publicity about the boycotting and\ndiscussions between the Olympic Committee and there were some\nother groups that were, had mentioned in the press about they should\nboycott the Olympics. And there were other groups that said they\nshouldn\u2019t boycott the Olympics so I was just aware that there was a\ndiscussion going on about boycotting but I wasn\u2019t aware of all the\ndetails involved.",
        "A: Not particularly. I did, I wasn\u2019t aware of any other athletes that I\nknew of and I wouldn\u2019t be in contact with them other than through\npublicity in the papers. But I remember something about Stoller and\nthose track athletes that were questioning about going to the Olympics\nbut I don\u2019t particularly remember the time frame in connection with\nthat but I do remember the discussion about it.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t think the press or the publicity influenced me one way or\nthe other because I wasn\u2019t aware at that time in any great detail of the\nproblems going on in Germany and the Nazis with the Jews. I knew\nthere were problems and it was serious but I wasn\u2019t aware of all the\ndetails.",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t worried at all about safety but the reason I boycotted it\nwas entirely a result of the meeting with Rabbi Levy. That was the\nessential dominant factor involved.",
        "A: Well boycotting the Olympics was a sacrifice because I had always\nwanted to be in the Olympics but I didn\u2019t consider it as, once we made\nup our mind and I was aware of what was going on there, I didn\u2019t look\nat it particularly as a sacrifice, although it was. But I didn\u2019t consider it\na terrible blow.",
        "A: No. We never made any public statements or indicated what steps we\nhad taken.",
        "A: Well after we boycotted the Olympics, no one came to speak to us or\nask us if we'd make any statement about it and I don\u2019t think anyone\nknew particularly that we did boycott it. Cause there was no publicity\nabout it one way or the other. The only publicity we had was when I\nspoke to the track coach at Harvard. His name was Yacko Macola. He\nwas the assistant coach but he was the \u2014 1n 19386 he was the track\ncoach, and we told him about our intention and he tried to persuade us\nnot to do it. He said he didn\u2019t think we\u2019d do much good and we should\ntry to go to the final tryouts and try to make the team. But we didn\u2019t\nwant to do that. And that was the only conversation we really had\nabout it, publicity wise.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: We, I went to see the track coach, Norman Carnis didn't.",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: Yes, I told Yacko Macola. I went to see him and told him that we had\ndecided not to go into the final tryouts.",
        "A: Well I went to see, to tell my track coach at Harvard, Yacko Macola,\nthat we weren't going to go into the final tryouts and told him the\nreason that we had spoken to our religious leader, Rabbi Levy, and\nthat we had decided because of the situation that we were told about\nthat we weren't going to go to the final tryouts and he was quite\ndisturbed \u2014 not disturbed but felt that we should really go ahead and\nwe ve always wanted to be in the Olympics and he thought we had,\nthat I had a great chance to qualify in two events. And that we, that I\nshould really try to change my mind about going to the final tryouts\nbut he didn\u2019t persuade us, persuade me rather. And that was the\nextent of the discussion with Yacko Macola, the coach.",
        "A: None that I know of. There was no one else that had qualified for the\nfinal tryouts from Harvard, except me. And I had no discussion with\nthem at that time. We were, I think, having final exams and\neraduation around June 10* or 12*h and I had no discussion with\nanyone about the final tryouts.",
        "A: Well, no, I was focused on being Jewish. I was focused on being Jewish\nbecause I felt loyal and loyalty to Judaism and I had no, we had\ncontact with non-Jews in college and everything but that wasn\u2019t a\nproblem as far as I was concerned.",
        "A: At the time of the Olympic games I was working at a summer camp as\na counselor up in Maine, up in Waterville, Maine. It was called Cedar\nCrest Camp. And I don\u2019t think they had television at that time or they\ndidn\u2019t have it at the camp. But I remember of course eagerly reading\nthe papers on the results and figuring out the times that they were\nwinning the events in and the distances in the long jump. So I was\nfollowing it very carefully but I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t remember seeing them\nactually on TV, but I did later on, on the re-runs.",
        "A: Well we didn\u2019t go to the movies at camp.",
        "A: Yeah, I think we had, I think there was a radio we were listening to> I\ndon\u2019t remember what the time factor was between the events and the\ntime zone in Waterville, Maine.",
        "A: Yeah, I was, I was thinking about how it would have been to have been\nrunning in those events and now whether I could have been a medal\nwinner and I was thinking in those terms but I didn\u2019t focus as far as\nactually winning the event at that time.",
        "A: I suppose in a way I was because as I say I had been thinking about it\nfor all those years, so I was in a way feeling that if I could have made\nthe team and | thought I could that I would have liked to have been in\nthat Olympic setting.",
        "A: Well now that\u2019s the peak of training or one of the peaks, one of the\nobjectives to be in the Olympics as I\u2019ve gone to a lot of the Olympics to\nsee it myself. In Los Angeles and in Korea and I\u2019m going to the\nOlympics in Atlanta this summer with my grandchildren and I always\nwatch those track events with great interest.",
        "A: No, I had no feelings about the Jewish athletes that competed. I didn\u2019t\nknow them number one, but I had no feelings one way or the other\nabout their competing, I mean that was up to them and I had no\nresentment at all about those that did go.",
        "A: In retrospect, I certainly do. I think they should have definitely\nboycotted.",
        "A: Well as far as the boycott is concerned, I think the American\ngovernment definitely should have boycotted the Olympics in Berlin\njust like they boycotted the Russian Olympics and now they would\nhave all the more of the facts than I ever had and I think it was\ndefinitely a mistake that they didn\u2019t boycott the Olympics in 1936.",
        "A: Yes, I think it would have made a great difference to have the\nAmerican government show their opposition to what was going on over\nthere in the Nazi regime. I think they made a serious mistake not to\nboycott it and I know that there was a lot of talk pro and against the,\nboycotting the Olympics. But I think this is a result more in retrospect\nrather than at the time. But as I think of it now, I definitely think it\nwas a mistake not to boycott it.",
        "A: Well I had no recollection particularly of what my feelings were at that\ntime in 1936. But it wasn\u2019t any great feeling that I had cause once I\nmade up my mind and felt that it should be that I should go or try for\nthe final tryouts, I didn\u2019t lose any sleep over that decision.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t, as I remember it, I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t remember being\nparticularly torn apart. No, I had a longing and a desire to have been\nin it, but I didn\u2019t have as I look back on it, I don\u2019t remember having\nany terrible regrets for having made the decision.",
        "A: Never a second thought on it.\nDo you think as you look back on the times since then, do you think\nthat that decision impacted the way you live your life or taught you an\nimportant lesson or really meant something very special?",
        "A: Well my decision not to participate in the final tryouts, I don\u2019t think\nhad any great impact on my future one way or the other. I mean I\nparticipate in athletics and as I said, I was pretty lucky to be\nperforming and held the world\u2019s record and Harvard records and was\nin the Harvard Hall of Fame for athletes and it had no particular\nimpact one way or the other.",
        "A: Well no, I don\u2019t think, I mean I felt good that I made the decision. But I\ndon\u2019t, as I said I don\u2019t think it had any impact as far as my future\nactivities or living or philosophies were concerned. It had no great\nimpact one way or the other.",
        "A: Yeah, I think back on making that decision and whether I would have\non or not \u2014 silver or gold or some sort of a medal and every time I go to\nthe Olympics, I\u2019ve been to three of them and I watch, I particularly\nwatch the high hurdles and the long jump and I picture myself as\nmaybe having won a medal on it, an Olympic medal. But I participated\nin the Senior Olympics in 1983 in Florida. Florida Senior Olympics and\nI won ten medals at that but that was not the real Olympics, that was\nthe Senior Olympics. So I, you know I\u2019ve won medals in Olympic senior\ncompetition.",
        "A: Well I think sports can be separated from politics. In a way they\nshould be but 1t depends on what the separation is. I mean interference\nby the government, particularly in sports, I wouldn\u2019t like to see that\nbut this 1s a, the boycotting is different, I don\u2019t consider that a mixing\nof sports and politics or a separation. I mean I think that\u2019s a moral\neround and I just think that they should have been boycotted; the U.S.\nshould have boycotted it, not because it\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s separation of those\nactivities. But I just think they should have just the way they did in\nthe Russian Olympics.",
        "A: Well I imagine they didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Well I remember after the Harvard/Yale track meet, which Carnis and\nI won six gold medals there was quite a bit of publicity in the\nnewspapers and there was a picture of Carnis and myself in the sport\npage. I forget which paper it was, and saying how we'd won six gold\nmedals and I think they called us Damon and Pythias because we were\nsuch good friends.\nAbout three or four days after the track meet, I got a phone call. I\nforget what the fellow\u2019s name was but he said he was calling at the\nrequest of Rabbi Levy. And he was on the men\u2019s council of the Temple\nand he had read about what we did at the Harvard/Yale track meet.\nAnd that he understood we were contenders for the Olympics and he\nhad some important information that he\u2019d like to talk to us about at\nthe request of Rabbi Levy and as I had mentioned, Rabbi Levy was the\nhead of Temple Israel in Boston, a Reform Temple, and he was well-\nrespected all over the United States. And I was confirmed at Temple\nIsrael and naturally when they asked us to come, or asked me and\nNorman Carnis, we agreed to come and | think it was set for two or\nthree days later.",
        "A: He said something about he wanted to talk to us about the Olympics\nand so I wasn\u2019t particularly prepared, I didn\u2019t know what they were\ngoing to talk about. Except that something about the Olympics and we\nwent to the boardroom at the Temple Israel on Commonwealth Avenue\nin Boston, that\u2019s where the Temple was at that time.\nAnd we went there and they explained about the reason they wanted\nto talk to us was in connection with what was going on in Germany.\nAnd they explained the problems that were going on there with the\nNazis and the terrible things that were happening to the Jews there\nand I don\u2019t remember the exact details of exactly what items they were\ntalking about but it was a terrible picture as I remember it and they\ndiscussed it fully and we told them that, I told them that I was\npreparing to go to the final tryouts. And that I\u2019d qualified and had to\nget prepared for it and train again and they explained to me that again\nit was a terrible situation there in Germany and they suggested that\nthey thought it would be a very good idea to boycott the Olympics and\nthey were quite sure that I'd never regret it. Even though I had my\nheard set on being in the Olympics and they suggested that you know\nit was up to me and Carnis decided what we wanted to do and so I told\nthem that we'd talk it over and let them know what we wanted to do\nand that was the basic situation as far as that meeting is concerned.",
        "A: that\u2019s right, they left the decision entirely up to us. They didn\u2019t say you\nhad to or they indicated, they recommended strongly that it was the\nright thing to do and we would never regret making the decision.",
        "A: Yes, that meeting really turned us around because we were horrified at\nwhat the terrible things that were going on in Germany and we just\nfelt it was the right thing to do and made up our mind to do it after as I\nsay we, I talked it over with my parents.",
        "A: Well I was living at the Lowell House at Harvard at the time with\nNorm Carnis and we went back and talked it over and decided that I'd\nvo home and talk things over with my parents, they lived in Newton.\nAnd I went home and talked it over with them and as I explained, my\nfather called Rabbi Levy to find out if I had the right report.\nAnd after his discussion with Rabbi Levy, he felt that the rabbi had a\ncomplete understanding of the whole situation and he could rely on his\njudgment and that I should rely on his judgment and he said that you\nknow left it up to me but he strongly recommended that I go along with\nthe suggestion from the rabbi and the men\u2019s committee. I think the\nhead of the Men\u2019s committee I think it was a fellow named Kimler or\nsomething close to it, or Kimmel or Kemla, it\u2019s some name like that.",
        "A: Yes, I followed it to see what they were doing and...",
        "A: Yeah, I followed the trials at Randalls Island cause I was you know\nvery much interested but as I say, I had no regrets after deciding not to\ngo into the final tryouts.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the details of the times at that time. As I recollect\nnow I think I could have made the team at two events \u2014 the long jump\nand the high hurdles. I\u2019m pretty sure I could have done it in the long\njump, I\u2019m not that certain about the high hurdles. Because it depended\non how much I improved at my timing there and really concentrating\non that event, but I don\u2019t remember the details particularly.",
        "A: I was very pleased but I knew that I had qualified because I won the\npreliminary events and knew that the winning of those preliminary\nevents would get me into the finial tryouts but I liked the certificate\nand I was you know very pleased to have it and I framed it and kept it.",
        "A: Yeah, they knew I was.",
        "A: Yeah, when I was a Cedar Crest camp during the Olympics in 19386,\nmost of the campers knew I was a good athlete and was material for\nthe Olympics and the year before I was in the Oxford-Cambridge meet\nand there was quite a bit of publicity and they talked about it when I\ncame back to camp. So yes, there was quite a bit of talk about the\nOlympics and whether I could have gotten a medal or not.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes I did.",
        "A: Yeah, I was. I enlisted in the Navy aviation and I was in 1943 I\nvolunteered for the Navy aviation and I was in a naval squadron which\nat that time was a scouting squadron. It was Scouting Squadron 31\nand I came in as a lieutenant junior grade which is the equivalent to a\nfirst lieutenant. And I came out in 1945 as a lieutenant commander\nand our...",
        "A: Our squadron was an anti-submarine squadron and we were patrolling\nfor and escorting ships out of Boston harbor and Portland, Maine\nharbor. And after the VE Day we were sent to Norfolk, Virginia and\nour squadron was being prepared to go out to the Pacific. And I wasn\u2019t\na part of it but I was what they call an air combat intelligence officer.\nAnd then the war ended, while I was in Norfolk and about a year, six\nmonths later I guess it was. So I was in the service in the Navy from\n\"42 I guess to \u201946.",
        "A: Well I followed the war very carefully, of the campaigns in North\nAfrica and all the different campaigns and was watching it very\ncarefully. But I wasn\u2019t particularly aware of any more activities in\nNazi Germany at that particular time other than what was going on in\nthe papers.",
        "A: Yeah, I remember reading about that and all the terrible things that\nwere happening there and that revolted me tremendously.",
        "A: I never looked at it in that vein; I never looked at it in the idea I was\nvindicated or not vindicated. Because I felt it was the right thing to do\nwhen I made that decision. I didn\u2019t think it was in any other terms.\nTHE END\n"
