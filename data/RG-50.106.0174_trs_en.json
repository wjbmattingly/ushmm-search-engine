        "A: Thanks to my grandmother, at the time the Jewish people spoke German, the more cultured\nfamilies wanted expose their children to German at home. But since my grandmother\n[indecipherable] lived with us, she insisted and she said, I do not want my grandchild speaking\ndeutschmueller she used to refer to 1t, making fun of the German language, but I want her to\nspeak Yiddish. So my very first language, my mamalashen was Yiddish.",

Beautiful, colorful fabrics and he was doing well because\nhis sister said, maybe you should come to the United States and he was finally getting on his feet\nand he said no, we\u2019re doing well here in Europe. And he was in business together with his\nbrother-in-law, his sister\u2019s husband. And we shared a two -- was a two family home.

        "A: Well, the Jews pretty much lived in the same area. Was a pretty modern town. My father went\nto shul every Shabbat. He had a beautiful voice, I guess I\u2019ve inherited that from him, and he used\nto be the[indecipherable]. He also belonged to the Havra Kadisha, which is the burial society.\nVery giving, as my grandmother was, they were very pious. He had a sukkah and at that time\nonly the men would eat in the sukkah and the children. And my mother told me that he would\ntake me to shul every Shabbat. And I think -- I didn\u2019t know that, but I loved going to services,\nand I too like to conduct the services, I\u2019m a shuli hatsidore, and to follow in his footsteps, years\nlater I -- I became part of the Havra Kadisha also --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Now, what would be your very first memory? Do you know?",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Had a -- had a happy, loving childhood. Would visit my grandparents and they adored me.\nMy aunts, uncles. So for the most part it was loving, and -- but my grandmother who lived with\nus didn\u2019t allow me to take my toys -- oh, she said, she\u2019I] use it up. Why is she always in the\nstreet playing with the children? And -- course, it was very short-lived, but it was a happy\nchildhood. I was with my cousin, who was just eight months younger and I recall it being happy\nand content. We had a radio, we had running water.",
        "Q: You lived in a house in the center of town?",
        "A: We lived in a house, yes.",

        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Now, do you have memories of that town at all?",
        "A: The street where I played, yes. Some memories, whether they\u2019re my own or because they\nwere related to me. When I would come to my grandparents in the little village, they would give\nme a bath outside. And I would watch my grandmother make her own butter, and how she\nchurned it. It\u2019s just fragmented memories here. I do remember a Sukkor here and there.",
        "Q: Any -- any favorite songs as a young, young child, from that time?",
        "A: That I really don\u2019t remember, just is -- I remember sadness after that, that was all.",
        "Q: Yeah, okay. Well let\u2019s -- when did things start to change from this happy childhood?",
        "A: Well, the -- as I recall, the Russians came in first and they drafted all young men. They\ndrafted my father into the army and that was -- we did not know, but it was to be the last time\nthat I saw him, when we said our goodbyes and he left on a train with other soldiers. My uncle\ngot out of it because of -- I don\u2019t know how, but he stayed with us. So he was the head of that\nwhole family, with my mother and I and luckily her sister, who was sent to live with us.",

        "Q: And you remember -- that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, cause you were so young when he left, but you\ndo remember him?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s exactly my memory or what I\u2019ve been told, cause it\u2019s -- was a long time\nago.",
        "Q: Yes. Right. So he went off the Russian army and then?",
        "A: Yes. Then the war broke out [indecipherable] in \u201941, and the Jews were told, we were told\nthat we would be evacuated and we had to be ready within 48 hours and we could only take\nwhatever we could carry with us, whatever was on our backs and in a little knapsack. Even\nthough I was only four years old, I do recall when they first came marching into town, my cousin\nhad gone up to the attic and he was looking outside. And soldiers saw him and I remember they\ncame knocking on the door with bayonets and my mother said for us to hide under the beds. So\nthe children, we hid under the beds, and they said, where is this spy? She said there were no\nspies, this was a child that was looking out the window, she saw you marching. No, we saw a\nspy. And they came with the bayonets, they came into my mother\u2019s bedroom, that I do recall and\nthey opened the closet door and were looking. And we were afraid, we were whimpering under\nthe bed and they made us come out from under the bed. We were lucky, they didn\u2019t sh -- and my\ncousin admitted that he was the one that was looking at them, and my mother begged them and\nsaid, don\u2019t harm these children, my husband went into the war, he\u2019s a soldier and please don\u2019t --\ndon\u2019t harm them. That\u2019s all I recall and so our lives --",
        "Q: What -- what -- what did the soldiers look like to you, would -- when you were such a young\nchild? Do you have any memory of that?",
        "A: Mean. I was -- it was horrible experience. I was really shivering, we were very frightened that\nwe would be shot. You know, they accused us of being spies.",
        "Q: Right. But you all -- \u2019'm sorry --",
        "A: It was a frightening experience.",
        "Q: Do you have a memory of this time?",
        "A: That I do have a memory of.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Some things distinctly I have a memory of.",
        "Q: Now, these are German soldiers?",
        "A: There were -- I\u2019m not exactly clear if they were German or Romanians who worked hand in\nhand with the German soldiers.",
        "Q: Yeah, okay, mm-hm. So then they left your house?",
        "A: Then they left my house. I then -- next thing we knew we had to pack up and my mother\ndressed me in layers of clothing.",
        "Q: What did she tell you was happening, now here you are just a ch -- such a young child?",
        "A: We have to leave. We have to leave everything behind. [indecipherable] child wanted -- I\nwanted to be with my mother.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: She -- she dressed me. I-I didn\u2019t want to wear so many things. I -- I must have worn about\nfour or five layers and on top of it, coats. And then I -- as little as I was, I had to have a knapsack\non my back, carrying other belongings, with no toys, nothing.",
        "Q: You took nothing personal, no dolls, no anything?",
        "A: No dolls, nothing.",
        "Q: No books, no toys?",
        "A: No, no. And the funny part was that they took -- well, my mother took my father\u2019s suits,\nthinking that -- that when he would return she wanted some clothes for him. And she took his\ntallit. So that tallit was with us. She also took the down pillows and -- and some quilts along. So\nthey really carried large bundles and then we had the -- the Jewish star on, that we had to wear.",
        "Q: By that time you were --",
        "A: The yellow star.",
        "Q: Yes. Do you re --",
        "A: And then we -- we went -- were to be transported to a -- a camp.",
        "Q: Do you remember wearing the yellow star?",
        "A: Do I remember wearing it?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I do remember wearing it.",
        "Q: Do you remember any feelings about that? Did you know what it meant? Again, I un -- you\nwere so young. Did it mean anything?",
        "A: It meant that I was different. It was frightening. I saw a lot of people, we were packed like\nsardines and they didn\u2019t tell us where we were going, but they said our destination was\nMargulav, which afterwards turned out to be -- that was a death camp. However, my\ngrandmother\u2019s half-brother was on that transport as well. He was very well-to-do. And he heard\nin the middle of the night that some soldiers -- we were at that point in a resting place, and a --\nthat --",
        "Q: Now you were -- you were on a train?",
        "A: Yeah, after the train they brought us to a -- it\u2019s a -- was a great big hall with -- with hundreds\nof people. I know I -- I had a terrible earache there, I remember that. And in the middle of the\nnight my uncle disappeared and then he came back. And he said, we\u2019re gonna leave this\ntransport. It\u2019s dangerous, but we\u2019re gonna leave because some of the Romanian soldiers were\ntaking bribes and my grandmother had sewn some money in her bras and in her girdle. I had\nasked her why she was doing that and she said, well, I\u2019m an old lady -- she considered herself\nold then, she probably was just in her -- her 40\u2019s -- if they shoot me, but we never know, it may\nsave our lives. And sure enough, the soldiers who took the bribe, they took us over the Dniester,\nD-n-i-e-s-t-e-r river.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s back up a little bit. From your home --",
        "A: Sorry.",
        "Q: Th-That\u2019s okay. Wi -- from your home to the train, how did you get there?",
        "A: We walked.",
        "Q: You walked. With -- with other villi -- with other Jewish --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- people [indecipherable]",
        "A: With other Jewish people.",
        "Q: And you got to the train station.",
        "A: You know, like Anna Cheska it reminded me. When I saw that, I said oh my God.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, it really hit me.",
        "Q: Yeah. And you got to the train station and you all got on the train. Was it a train with seats?",
        "A: You know, that I really don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Okay, okay, okay.",
        "A: Remember standing, but I don\u2019t really remember.",
        "Q: Okay. So now your -- your uncle said, we\u2019re gonna leave this transport.",
        "A: Okay. Right, but they took us over to the river to a place called Chargolat, which was also in\nTransnistria. It was the Ukraine, but it was a labor camp, okay?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And many a soldier -- th-these were barges we were on, and they drowned -- many of the\nJews were drowned, the soldiers just threw them in the -- in the river.",
        "Q: Did you as a child see this, or you heard it --",
        "A: I saw this. A soldier was holding me, and my mother\u2019s anguished look. He knew that she was\non the verge of tears, she said please don\u2019t hurt my child. And he said -- there were -- really God\nanswered me, I da -- I believe. He said, do not worry. I have a child this age at home, I am not\ngoing to harm her. I was blonde. I had brown eyes and I think he said I reminded him of his\nchild. So there were kindnesses that I do remember and thank God that we did make it across.\nThen our good luck was also the people that took us in, they were prima -- it was a labor camp,\nbut we\u2019d have to find our own housing. And the person that took us in wa -- they were Jewish.\nThey were also part of the labor camp, but he had one of his children, his oldest child, who was\nengaged [indecipherable] went to the riverbank to see which people looked suitable, they looked\nbalabatish to take in. We were nine people. They had a primitive clay house, that is a one\nbedroom with a hearth in the center. They were a family of four taking in ni -- they had to take\nin, they had no choice, so they picked -- they picked us, we were lucky. They picked nine of us.\nHe was a butcher, the gentleman who -- who was the owner of the house, and he took us in. It\nwas my mother and I, my grandmother and her sister, and then my father\u2019s sister and her\nhusband, two children and my uncle\u2019s mother, Baba Chana. So they took all of us in.",
        "Q: Now, is this 1942?",
        "A: No, this was in 1941, September of \u201941.",
        "Q: Oh, September of 41, okay.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And the reason I -- I asked, I said how come my mother wasn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t recall her being --\nfor some reason they had mercy, that if you had a small child, they didn\u2019t take you into the labor\ncamp. Her sister worked in the tobacco fields and she also worked in an area where they dried\napples and fruit and tomatoes. She wasn\u2019t allowed to -- she would have been shot if she would\nhad taken any food out. Thus we experienced a lot of hunger. Whatever we could get, that\u2019s --\nluckily my aunt, who was very handy with a needle and she -- she sewed beautifully and she\nknitted beautifully. And she found some people from home who were not Jewish, but they were\nalso transported to this camp. The two women who gave her work to do on the side, and after she\ncame home from labor, and in exchange, they would give her food here and there. So we would\nhave a potato floating in the water. I would have a -- a piece of bread with some oil occasionally.\nBut as a child I remember you -- we found other -- even though I saw death, I saw people dying\nin the street and starving, they didn\u2019t have a roof over their heads, and as primitive as the\nconditions were -- there was no running water, there was no -- there were no toilet facilities. I\nremember going in a pail, having to go outside in the very bitter cold of the winter. My aunt and\nuncle stayed with us only for one year, but then they -- they left, they went to a different camp. It\nwas ju -- we just couldn\u2019t make it together, 1t was too hard.",
        "Q: But up to that point you were all living with that family of four.",
        "A: All living with that family but my mother and I stayed --",
        "Q: What was their name -- wa -- what was the name of the family, do you know?",
        "A: Yes. I found out. Yoshka Nousins Brytank.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Okay. Brytburt, Brytburt. Yoshka Nousins Brytburt. That was his name.",
        "Q: And what were they like to you? What di --",
        "A: They were very nice actually. They -- they had nothing so they couldn\u2019t share with us. But\nyou can imagine ah -- all I remember is so many of us in this one great big room. They had a\nbedroom, but we had to find sleeping quarters for nine of us. My uncle had typhoid fever and\nthey were very, very nice, they let us -- let him be in the bedroom when he was so ill, they di --\nthey didn\u2019t want him to infect the rest of us, and he was lucky, he made it. But it was a very, very\nhard time and I remember my aunt would get very upset with my cousin who was older. She\nsaid, why don\u2019t you steal like other children, so we could have a piece of bread? And -- and he\nsaid, I can\u2019t do it, I can\u2019t. It\u2019s not in my nature, I will not do it. And that\u2019s when they decided to\nleave and see if they, you know, they -- they didn't want it to be a burden. Here we were women,\nall women, and it was hard for her to leave her mother behind, cause her mother is the one that\nstayed with us, my grandmother, but she also had her husband\u2019s mother and so they went to a\ndifferent camp where she worked on -- on hats, and -- a different labor camp.",
        "Q: Did the host family have children? You said there were four or --",
        "A: Yes, they had two, they were older.",
        "Q: They were older?",
        "A: They had two older children, yeah, one was about to be married.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, the ho -- so what were they -- what did you do during the day?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: You were there for a few years in the --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- in the town.",
        "A: We were there until \u201944, April of \u00b044.",
        "Q: Okay, but staying in this same house?",
        "A: In this same house. I watched my grandmother [indecipherable]. She died in that house, she\nhad stomach cancer. And she had shrouds that were being made for her and I would ask her --\nyou know, a child is very inquisitive, what are these? Why is all this white? And she said, that\u2019s\nfor when they bury me. And she had a little sack of soil that her brother was able to get for her, it\nwas the soil from Israel, as you know, traditionally that\u2019s what we\u2019re buried with. And she knew\nthat her son would never come back, she had that feeling. And she never was to see her\ndaughters again, the one from the United States and she didn\u2019t know what would happen to us\neither, we were all in danger. And when she died, she -- oh, she asked me, she said, I want you to\nlight the candles. But what they didn\u2019t do, they didn\u2019t take me to the cemetery. I remember they\ndid the taharat, they prepared her body for burial right in that room where we lived. And that was\nsuch a -- such a traumatic things for me. And of course when the finished I lit the candle, but\nthen they took her away and they didn\u2019t let me come to the ceremony. Klainer kinder, little\nchildren you don\u2019t take to the cemetery. That is imbedded in my memory, I will never forget\nthat, it was really, really difficult. It was my first experience with -- with loss, somebody close\nlike that who died.",
        "Q: But what -- when did she die?",
        "A: I -- you know, I don\u2019t know exactly, but --",
        "Q: Do you know what year?",
        "A: I think it was about a year and a half in [indecipherable] I wou -- I would think it would be\nabout f -- I would say \u00b042 - 1942.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So she did have a -- a burial site. She was the only one of my grandparents who -- well, she\nand her -- her husband of course died in World War I. I don\u2019t recall them saying that he had a --\na burial ground, I don\u2019t know. But -- so that was it.",
        "Q: All right, uh-huh.",
        "A: As far as what did I do there, we played with little stones. My mother made a -- a rag doll for\nme out of straw. What kept us alive was cleanliness. My mother had to go about a mile and a\nhalf to a running -- running water where she would do our laundry, made sure that we were\nclean. And I fell into that river once. I went with my mother and -- and my cousin, and my\ncousin suddenly said, Tante Tavu, there\u2019s a kinder in wasser. Aunt Tavu, there\u2019s a little child in\nthe water. And my mother takes a look and that little child is -- 1s her daughter, and she did not\nknow how to swim, so luckily she was doing our sheets and she threw the sheet 1n and she told\nme to grab onto it, and I did, but I did not speak for three days. They had me lying down, I -- that\nI remember cause to me it was like witchcraft. There was this woman that came and -- and broke\nan egg on my forehead and she started talking --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: -- after that.",
        "A: Well, I could not speak, so they brought in this woman who broke an egg on my forehead.\nShe said all kinds of abra kadabra language that was not familiar to me. I still didn\u2019t speak, it\nwas traumatic for me, and for the family.",

But as a child I -- I found\nother children, we played with little rocks and there was even a little pre-kindergarten class\norganized by people and I remember going and learning my very first Hebrew, because you had\nto say what you were bringing. So I had [speaks Hebrew] which okay, bread and -- and some oil,\noccasionally. It was very brief, I recall fragments, you know. We learned a song here and there\nand I was with other children. And even though the times were horrible and I saw starvation and\npeople begging in the streets and death, somehow as a child you find some happiness with other\nchildren, you just -- I mean, I saw a lot of sadness but I guess to protect yourself you just want to\nstep back and live in your own little dream world.",

And so the [indecipherable] from our -- our\nlandlord, so to speak, they had a house with a basement and a sub-basement and they took us\ninto a sub-basement where we were all hiding. They had a -- a little boy who suddenly\ndisappeared and they were afraid for him because he ran out in the street. And that\u2019s how we\nfound out though that the Russians actually came, because he was out and when he came back he\nreported that there was drinking in the street and he saw Russian soldiers. So in -- I guess the\nfront broke through and at that point we knew that the war was over. And then our -- our journey\nback home, so to speak, began.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But there was euphoria, there was happiness that we lived through that horrible period so far,\nand we were going to pick up the pieces and go back, what we thought was home.",

        "Q: Was it hard to say goodbye to the people you lived with?",
        "A: No -- yes and no, you know, we thanked them, of course, that they took us in, we were very\ngrateful. And they finally had their house to themselves, but it was very primitive compared to\nthe home that we\u2019d left. When we came back to Waszkow, the Russians -- the Iron Curtain set\nin, and the same real estate people that my aunt was working for when she came to visit -- not\nvisit, to stay with my parents because her father wanted her out when the Russians initially came.\nHe -- he was in charge of a bank, so he invited my aunt to come and work for the bank. But\nwhen we went to our house, it was used as a silo, and they said no, you cannot -- they had\nproduct there, you cannot come in. My mother said look, my husband was fighting the war at\nthat time, he\u2019s a soldier and I just want the pictures that I have in the attic. Can I go into the attic,\ncause I don\u2019t have any pictures. And they did let her go in the attic, I don\u2019t -- and where we were\npermitted to live was my great-grandparents house was converted for the returnees, those who\ncame back home but they couldn\u2019t go into their home. So we were given a room in my great-\ngrandparents house --",
        "Q: What -- what --",
        "A: -- which was not far from where we used to live, okay. And I started going to kindergarten --",

        "A: She found pictures, but she didn\u2019t find the money that she had hidden [indecipherable |",
        "Q: So she took the photographs --",
        "A: She got -- took the photo album and took the pictures, right. They were precious, cause some\npeople have lost -- my husband didn\u2019t have a picture left, nothing. He\u2019s just told how beautiful --\nwhat a beautiful baby he was, but he never saw it.",
        "Q: Was the furniture and everything in the house, was that --",
        "A: Nothing, everything was gone.",
        "Q: Oh, it wasn\u2019t the furniture that you ha -- your parents had had?",

        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: -- no, they had products there, no. No, no, nothing was -- was there.",
        "Q: Did you also go inside the house?",
        "A: Did I? No.",
        "Q: No, okay.",
        "A: Only my mother.",
        "Q: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: And there [indecipherable] my mother put herself in danger with my aunt -- oh, and my aunt\ncame too, from the other labor camp, we were together again. And they would sell different\nproducts so that we could have food on the table. And of course my aunt had a job. And then my\nuncle again found out that if he falsified -- there was a -- a Pole that he knew, a friend. And he\nsaid to him, I\u2019m going to register my family, cause I want to get out. You should also see if you\ncan have false papers drawn up, because I would suggest that you leave this place, it\u2019s going to\nbe hard to leave Russia, if you don\u2019t leave -- we were there for a brief period of time. We got\nthere April \u201944, and we were out by -- by \u00b040 -- \u00b045.",
        "Q: What part of --",
        "A: Na -- we were there about a year, not even a year.",
        "Q: What were your -- y-you talk about your aunt --",
        "A: [indecipherable] excuse me?",
        "Q: You -- you -- you talk about your aunt and uncle, what -- what were their names?",
        "A: Oh, my uncle\u2019s name was [indecipherable] oh, Mendel. Mendel. Mendel Machlovich. He was\nmarried to my father\u2019s sister Esther.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Okay? And this -- a friend of -- of my Uncle Mendel, Mr. Schlitz, his wife was Polish, so he\nknew -- he told us that all ethnic Poles were going to leave the Iron Curtain and that\u2019s when he\ntold him to have these papers falsified. And Mendel, my uncle, decided to lie and say they were\nPolish so they would get then into Poland. And he went with my mother and registered me, that\u2019s\nwhen he made me the two years younger. And my aunt was -- he said that my aunt was his sister.\nI don\u2019t know what he made my mother into, but --",
        "Q: What was the purpose in making you two year younger?",
        "A: Because he had a child that was eight months old and it -- I couldn\u2019t be older because he had\nanother -- he had a son, so he thought that if I would be younger than his daughter, it would\nmake more sense. So they got these false papers and my aunt was not allowed to leave. We were\nall on the train, ready to leave, and my aunt worked in the bank. My mother went to beg her empl\n-- her sister\u2019s employer\u2019s wife to please speak to her husband and let -- and let her s -- only sister\ngo. Oh, and what I didn\u2019t bring up, my mother and aunt found out the fate of their parents. They\nwanted to go back to the little village where their parents lived, but as it turned out they found a\nneighbor of my grandparents who was living in Waszkow aft-after liberation, and they inquired.\nThey said, what happened to our parents? Well, they proceeded to give them the blow by blow\ndescription. The Ukrainians worked hand in hand with -- you know, they were anti-Semites too,\nand they were glad to comply with the government, you know, to get rid of the Jews, and this\nway they had their belongings because my aunt saw him wear -- my mother did too, my\ngrandfather\u2019s shirt. And when they went to the house they saw -- you know, they prepared a\nhope chest. My aunt would have been the next one to get married and my grandmother already\nstarted a hope chest for her and they saw that there and they saw some of the furnishings. And\nthey said that my grandfather escaped briefly, but they said there was HaSharah, they used to\ntrain religious boys in kibbutz life and there was a ri -- so he -- he went there for awhile because\nhe said they won\u2019t touch the families, yes. Well, he came back, he came back the day after his\nwife, my grandmother, the three aunts and my uncle were butchered. I call it butchered because\nthey were, with farm implements, they killed each and every one of them. And they left the\nremains and they showed him the remains. And then for some reason they had mercy and shot\nhim instead of killing him with the farm implements. And this man, this neighbor described it to\nmy mother. It was horrible, so we -- we know exactly the date when they were killed, the 10\" of\nTammuz, which was on a July -- I have it down here --",
        "Q: Do you know what year?",
        "A: It was in 19 -- just -- it was on ju -- on July fifth, but I don\u2019t know the -- the 10\" of Tammuz,\nand he was a day later.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes. Which was -- which was horrible because my mother just tore the earrings out of her --\nyou know, when she heard all that, and you know, they became orphans in -- in a sense and --\nand my father\u2019s best friend came home and we asked him what happened to my father, where\nwas my father. And when he related he also gave us, you know, cause it\u2019s very important to the\nJewish people to know the exact Yahrzeit and when. Of course they had no burial, none of them\ndid, but at least he came back giving us when, the seventh day of Av, it\u2019s always two days before\nTisha B\u2019Av. For me it\u2019s a Tisha B\u2019 Av because from the time I was little I had to say Kaddish for\nhim. Of course then it was only Orthodox, so the girls didn\u2019t say, so that\u2019s when I found out I -- I\ndidn\u2019t have a father any more. And that was very difficult. He was always -- I always missed\nhaving a father in my life.",

        "A: Hard, it was hard. I, of course, cried and I -- I was envious of my cousin who had her father.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And she -- they were never set -- separated from him. But -- and I had the love of my mother\nand -- and her sister and then I went to school and I remember the Russian soldiers looking over\nmy report card and -- and saying, oh you\u2019re such a good student [Russian] means outstanding,\noutstanding. But I was very scared, I used to walk to school through the woods. And I had to\nrecite poetry from memory, remembering -- I learned Russian, Ukrainian, we learned -- and we\nwere told to kiss Stalin\u2019s picture cause these were -- these schools were run by communists.",

        "A: I don\u2019t remember the gradual --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- where -- where we were exactly at what time.",
        "Q: No, I know, I know.",
        "A: All I remember 1s that it took us three months to get to Germany, to Munich where we finally\ngot to a DP camp.",
        "Q: Right, right. Now, did you go by train all the time?",
        "A: We went by different trains, we hopped different trains.",
        "Q: How did you hop it -- a train? How do you hop a train?",
        "A: Illegally. We -- we did it at night, we were on coal cars, we -- when we were stopped -- we\nposed at one point as Greeks and they send us children and -- and we ask for mayim, mayim, and\nwe showed them we wanted some water. The soldiers searched us, you know, we had to undress,\nmy mother, I remember. It -- it was a very frightening time for us, and we found some places --\nagain, the s -- one man appeared that came from the town that my -- my uncle knew and he told\nus where to go, where it was safe to stay. So --",
        "Q: So what was your new name at this point?",
        "A: No, our name --",
        "Q: You said you got --",
        "A: -- our name was the same, just the dates were changed, the birth date and -- and the way I --",
        "Q: Oh, so you --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah --",
        "Q: -- still had the same name?",
        "A: -- yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t have false --",
        "A: And the -- the only thing that\u2019s not clear to me 1s we wound up, my mother and I and my aunt\nwound up in -- in one DP camp and my -- and my other Aunt Esther and her husband, and her\ntwo children and mother-in-law wound up in a different DP camp.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with Rita Lifschitz Rubinstein. This is tape number two, side A. And before we go on\nto talk about your experience in the DP camp, were there any instances where non-Jews helped\nyou and your family out?",
        "A: Yes. When my aunt worked in the labor camp, she recognized one woman who was not\nJewish [indecipherable] and her sister Lydia. One of them had worked in a pharmacy, a Jewish\npharmacist. She was his assistant and she happened to be in Shargarat at the time and she needed\nsome things that had to be fixed. This was not done, of course, during her work in labor camp,\nbut after she would leave they would give her some extra work and in exchange they would give\nher some food that she was --",
        "Q: What -- what kind of work would she give your aunt?",
        "A: She would do repairs and -- and a -- do some dresses for them.",
        "Q: So this was dressmaking --",
        "A: She would sa --",
        "Q: -- this was the dress --",
        "A: Yes, dressmaking work. Tailoring, so to speak. And in exchange they would give her bread,\nand -- but she was very happy to share with us, and so we didn\u2019t starve [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Any other instances besides that?",
        "A: Yes. After the -- the war when we came back to Waszkowitz, there was [indecipherable |\nwhom she -- my aunts had worked in real estate for him, but when the Russians came he became\na banker. He owned a bank and he invited her to work in the bank. So there she earned some\nmoney and we were able to purchase food and that sustained us again. My mother did a lot of\nsmuggling with her -- her sister-in-law. They -- a-and that brought food to the table, too. Ma --\nthey exchanged credits, in other words, they did not do it legally. But we were very poor, we had\nnothing left after the war, no money and so on.",
        "Q: When you say food on the table, what kind of food?",
        "A: The -- what kind of foods? They fix bread, milk and -- and some butter and no luxuries.\nCheeses. I don\u2019t think they had a kosher butcher left, and we were very kosher then. It was\nmostly a -- dairy products. I don\u2019t really remember any -- eating any meats at all.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And -- and is -- was that --",
        "A: Oh, and then there was another in-instance when we were trying to flee the Iron Curtain and\nwe were at the train station when the son of the midwife who delivered both my mother and my\naunt in their little town of Mili, or Mileev, he was married to a Polish woman and he was on the\ntransport to go to -- to Poland. And he thought, so he knew he was able to go because of his wife\nbeing Polish.",
        "Q: But he was Jewish?",
        "A: No. And he knew that they were not really Poles, that we weren\u2019t Poles, but he did not give it\naway. He did not go to the authorities and he pretended that he didn\u2019t know us -- because in that\ninstance he could have -- we probably wouldn't have been allowed to leave.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But you were and you did get away and now you --",
        "A: So, it was the third time, right, that we were lucky.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And now you\u2019re in Germany?",
        "A: So now we went to L\u00e9dz, we went to -- to Czechoslovakia, my aunt met her wonderful\nhusband with other -- we were -- I know we met lots of refugees who were fleeing from different\n-- he was from Lithuania. We were together, the un -- the --",
        "Q: How long did you stay at these places?",
        "A: -- the Israeli underground, they -- I should say organizers from Israel helped us travel through\n-- through the different areas and -- and found places for us to stay.",
        "Q: And would you ever stay more than one or two nights in the --",
        "A: In some -- in some instances, yes.",
        "Q: But you were constantly moving?",
        "A: Constantly moving by the kindness of strangers and other either Jewish families, or non-\nJewish families. They knew where it was safe for us and we were constantly moving, constantly.\nFinally, finally we reached Munich. Yes, it was near Munich and [indecipherable] and that was a\nDisplaced Persons camp and we were in barracks which were used for -- not the soldiers really,\nit was a camp for soldiers, but it was run by HIAS and -- the Hebrew sheltering society.",
        "Q: Before we get now to that --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When you were traveling, those months --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- to get there, were there a lot of children in the group with you?",
        "A: Not a lot of children. Oh, 1t was very sad because as you know, most children didn\u2019t survive\nthe war. A lot of children were murdered. And -- but in DP camp, you did find children.",
        "Q: Yeah, but before the DP camp, were there any children in the group at all that you were\ntraveling with?",
        "A: Other than my cousins, I don\u2019t recall.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Really don\u2019t recall --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- seeing a lot of children.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did y -- did you and your cousins do --",
        "A: But I did see families when we wer -- got on trains.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Groups of people all the time and --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- also doing what we were doing.",
        "Q: And di -- did you know what was happening, what was a nine year old\u2019s perspective at that\ntime?",
        "A: We knew we were the -- we were de -- either destined to go to the United States or we wanted\nto go to Israel.",
        "Q: You knew that at the time on your way to the DP camp?",
        "A: That that was our goal, we knew that --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- we no longer had a home as far as we were concerned. Our home was gone.",
        "Q: Le-Let\u2019s -- let\u2019s talk about what Israel and also the United States meant to a nine year old\nwho had been through the war.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Did you know what Israel was?",
        "A: First of all, to a nine year old, it was my first taste of a formal Jewish school, where I was\ntaught Hebrew, history -- we were like sponges, we were -- had a void in our lives. We didn\u2019t\nhave much of a childhood, we didn\u2019t have time for play, we didn\u2019t have time for study. And\nsuddenly we were given mathematics and -- a-and the thirst for knowledge was unbelievab -- we\nhad wonderful teachers.",
        "Q: This is in the camp -- in -- in Feldafing --",
        "A: This is in DP camp, in Feldafing.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We were given one room, the conditions were certainly not plush, but we were given a room.\nMy mother met a man from Germany, he had lost his wife and he was in Auschwitz and in\nDachau and he lost a wife and son there. His daughter was on a Kindertransport to England, he\ndidn\u2019t know if she was alive. He was 15 years my mother\u2019s senior, but people told my mother,\nwho knew at the time she was probably going to go to the United States, but I -- my Zionism\nwas, I think, embedded in me when I started going to the school there and the love of Israel and I\nwill never forget the day that Israel was declared independent. We children -- the school was --\nconsisted of just maybe a hundred children. I have pictures of that, of DP camp. And yet we were\nso happy that those were happy times, cause we were free. And we danced all night in a bonfire\nand I told my mother, I am not going to the United States, I am going to tear up the papers. I\u2019m a\nhalf an orphan, I wanted to go on the Exodus. My aunt did not -- even though she had two sisters\nin the United States, but my cousin was seven years older than I and he swam the channel\nalready. He refused to go to the United States. But my mother said, my only sister, she had --\nthere was a quota system then. My aunt got married to a Lithuanian Jew and -- who lost his\nentire family and they were allowed to come -- immigrate to the United States right away, they\nleft in 1946 -- \u00b047. \u201946 - \u00b047. And we did not leave until \u201949, we had to wait for our quota system.\nIn the meantime we had our physical exams and many of the children in the school were found\nto have TB. I was in a camp -- they had diagnosed it three months before they even told my\nmother, and then they told her that I indeed had TB and I had to go to a sanitarium, they called it\na sanitarium then. And it was not in the same town, it was in Augsburg. And here I was, nine and\na half, 10 years old. My mother took me there initially and she left me with all the other children.\nI was only able to see her once a week, it was not close. And when she came back and was\nlooking for me, she said where is my daughter? And they said well, she is in quarantine. She has\na bad case of TB and she cannot be with other children. So I was in that sanitarium for nine\nmonths. The treatment that I needed they only gave to people who had TB of the bones, not -- I\nhad it in my lungs. And so they had to collapse a lung and th-the anti-Semitic nurses, they were\nnot -- there were some people that were nice. The doctor that I had was wonderful, the Danish\ndoctor who spoke to my mother. He said, I had TB as a child, I have a family now, don\u2019t worry,\nyour daughter will be okay. But luckily we had family here, so my mother wrote to them in the\nUnited States saying that I needed streptomycin if they could possibly get it for me. In the\nmeantime they had to perform surgery and the nurses would always tell me, you\u2019re going to go\nthrough this test, it\u2019s going to hurt. And they would give me tissues, you\u2019re going to cry. And so\nI believe that my tolerance for pain was established there because I showed them how brave I\ncould be, and no matter how much it hurt, I -- I didn\u2019t give in. I -- I had to show them. I would\nwrite letters to my mother trying to calm her down because [indecipherable] said don\u2019t worry,\nthings will be okay. I -- and I remember my mouth, I had developed a terrible tooth infection,\nthey had to send me to -- I had an abscess and I had to go through surgery, they sent me to a\ndifferent hospital where suddenly I had my period at 10 and a half. And that was so frightening,\nthat it -- I -- that I remember very vividly.",
        "Q: Did you know what it represented, it meant?",
        "A: No, because my mother never talked to me about it, but of course the -- a friend, you found\nout through friends. And we didn\u2019t have tampons, and we didn\u2019t have -- it was rags, that was\ndisgusting. But then finally you know, and the Americans brought over the pads and things. But\nI was frightened. There was a very nice counselor from HIAS who -- who would come to see me\nand she brought me a lot of handiwork to do. I still have an embroidery that I did.",
        "Q: This is while you\u2019re still in solitary?",
        "A: While in -- I was in the sanitarium for nine months and I was in the quarantine for -- for three\nmonths. They performed surgery, I still have the scars. While I was under the knife, my mother\ncame with the streptomycin -- this is before, and I used to get streptomycin shots every four\nhours all during the day and night. That was -- that was for three months. And after surgery I\nwould console my mother, she just wished she had saved my letters, that I saw a bird and don\u2019t\nworry, Ill be fine and I\u2019m feeling okay. But thank God I lived through it and came back to\ncamp. My cousins couldn\u2019t even say goodbye to me, they went to Israel. In the meantime they\nleft for Israel because they were not allowed, but my aunt would come with my uncle and then of\ncourse we had a wonderful reunion first time we went to Israel before the Yom Kippur war, my\nhusband and I. And I -I just can\u2019t describe it, how we felt. We both kissed the soil of Israel and\nwe were just so thrilled. But also \u2019ve been very happy in the United States. I\u2019m glad that, you\nknow, I did go with my mother, cause we did have a loving family here. I met my father\u2019s sisters\nfor the first time, who always sent packages while I was in the sanitarium. At that time they\nbelieved in feeding you. I was, you know, skinny after the war, but my fat cells grew in that\nsanitarium. Then they believed in feeding you a lot. Butter and all kinds of rich things. And they\nwould send me clothing from my cousins and my cousins would blame me for being chubby. We\nhad to eat because our cousin in Europe was starving. But with -- you know, the opportunities\nwere here. We came --",
        "Q: But let us -- before we get to the United States --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- let\u2019s talk a little more about -- about the camp --",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: -- yeah, about the camp. So you were in the sanitartum for nine months and they you went\nback to the camp itself. I -- y-you were in the sanitarium --",
        "A: Oh, from the sanitarium --",
        "Q: And then you were ca --",
        "A: -- for nine months, and f -- my mother visited me once a week only, which was hard.",
        "Q: Yeah. And then you went back to her.",
        "A: I went back to camp at -- yeah, and I went back to school.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And what did you and the other kids talk about?",
        "A: What was very sad for us and -- and a-at the same time rewarding too. I\u2019ve always loved to\nsing and dance and we put on wonderful performances for the people. And that -- one\nperformance I -- I was given solo a lot, with-without any formal training but I had a good voice\nand I loved to sing and we put on some really cute shows, even without the ballet outfits, PII\nshow you the makeshift outfits they made for us. We always had managed with costumes and\nthings. But they were a handful of kids, there were only a hundred of us or so. And there were\npeople that came, survivors who came to see the shows, and one woman sat next to my mother\nand she pointed to me. She said, who knows if -- if the parents of this child is alive. There were\nso many children -- I had friends there that -- whose parents didn\u2019t survive. I mean, that was my\nlucky thing --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that I survived with my mother. And she said, well, thank God, I am the parent. She said,\nhow lucky you are, and people who lost their children, it was so sad. And I learned Polish there\nbecause there were many kids who had been hidden in convents and they didn\u2019t speak a word,\nthey didn\u2019t even know they were Jewish. And they didn\u2019t speak a word of Yiddish. So, in order\nfor me to be able to converse, I learned the language. And people would start speaking Polish to\nmy mother, said I don\u2019t understand. How come? Your daughter speaks Polish. Well, my\ndaughter picked it up.",
        "Q: W-When you put on the shows, in what language were the shows?",
        "A: Oh, now that was all in Yiddish.",
        "Q: That was all in --",
        "A: Yiddish or Hebrew. We learned Hebrew and we learned Yiddish.",
        "Q: And you had a formal schooling there?",
        "A: Absolutely, formal schooling with -- with report cards and excellent teachers, excellent tea --",
        "Q: Who were the teachers?",
        "A: But we remember -- now they would say child molestation, sex -- sex offender, we had -- and\nit\u2019s strange, none of us -- we had a reunion here. I have two friends, dearest friends that I met in\nDP camp. They were -- one was from Poland and one was from Lithuania. We found each other.\nAnd she was just here. We had a reunion because we worked as volunteers for the army, three of\nus. And we never talked about it, I mean, we didn\u2019t think about it, cause then we were so\nashamed. There was one teacher, he was an excellent teacher, but he would invite you to his\nhome. He would say he was going to help us, you know, with the studies or whate -- very\nfriendly, very nice man and I -- I was always lacking a fatherly figure. And -- but he always was\ntouchy-feely, and you know, we were developing girls. And we never, you know, none of us\nshared it. We had a reunion, one of the survivors lived in Vancouver, and we talked about this\nteacher and all of us had this same experience, how we jumped out -- I jumped out of his\nwindow, I ran when he started, you know, anything. And they said they had the same experience.\nAnd we burst out laughing, I mean it -- it\u2019s funny to us now, but we were afraid to say anything\nto our parents or anybody, they would think we are crazy. And we felt so dirty, we felt oh my\nGod, what is he doing, you know, touching us like that.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: So it -- these teachers, a lot of them were trained as teachers and they took us on trips. There\nwere different castles and there were a lot of marbrahim that came from Israel and they talked\nabout Israel and that\u2019s why we -- we had [indecipherable] we had a different assembly for -- for\nHertzel and Schumfeldore and different celebrations.",
        "Q: So you became fluent in Hebrew then?",
        "A: We learned Hebrew well, and Yiddish, right [indecipherable] that\u2019s -- yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm. That\u2019s when -- I was so delighted when I came to New York and they offered\nHebrew in the junior high school and the high school. That\u2019s what I took and I continued with it.",
        "Q: Yeah. So you -- you h -- your daily schedule was to get up and go to school?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And then come back to your mother at the end of the day and --",
        "A: Yeah, and we had woods nearby and I would go with my friends and we would pick\nstrawberries and all kinds of berries and mushrooms. And sometimes we would steal apples from\norchards from the Germans and we didn\u2019t -- we would get like cans of tuna fish we didn\u2019t -- and\nthey gave us Spam. I -- Spam, what the heck 1s that? So what -- my stepfather took it and he -- in\nexchange the Germans -- he would speak German very well, they gave him a chicken that we\nhad slaughtered and had chicken, cause you know, th-the food was not that great that they gave\nyou.",
        "Q: What kind of living arrangement, how -- did you have? Were you in a --",
        "A: We were in a -- we were in a one room with not -- all together in the one room and we had a\nlittle kitchenette. It was a barrack. The living quarters were not great, and I had hand-me-down\nclothing, but I was happy, you know. We had a table and chair -- chairs. They gave us basics that\nwe would need. We had tuna fish we didn\u2019t know what to do with. Then we find -- you know, so\npeanut butter, and --",
        "Q: Did you -- what were your thou -- feelings about Germans at -- at that time? When you would\nsee German people --",
        "A: We did not like them, I'll tell you that. It was a beautiful country, we went to see, but --",
        "Q: So when you would see a German on the street or German in the camp --",
        "A: Well, they were not in -- in uniform then --",
        "Q: No, I know.",
        "A: -- that was --",
        "Q: No, I know, but did it -- did you have any emotional gut feeling towards them at all?",
        "A: All I know that I -- I was robbed of my father, my grandparents because of them. I didn\u2019t\nhave good feel -- but I mean, I didn\u2019t blame them all, I knew that some of them who are my age,\nthey were not at fault, they didn\u2019t do any of it, but their parents, their grandparents.",
        "Q: What about the American, when you would see an American?",
        "A: That made us feel good. They always gave us chocolate and they were very friendly and they\nwere very outgoing and -- but they made it difficult too for us to come to the United States. We\ncouldn\u2019t wait until the quota system finally -- and we were really frightened because you had to\npass the health exam and if anybody was sick, even though Ellis Island was abolished at that\npoint, you still -- you didn\u2019t make it. And they saw calcification on my lung, so my mother\nworried about that. But thank God we had sponsors. She had great-uncles who came to the uni --\nmy -- my grandfather\u2019s stepbrothers, they were here. And so we did have some help as far as\nfinding an apartment. In the beginning it was very difficult. We lived with my aunt, my mother\u2019s\nsist -- only surviving sister.",
        "Q: Your -- you\u2019re talking about in -- in the --",
        "A: When we came to the United States --",
        "Q: Okay, and -- and -- and --",
        "A: -- initially.",
        "Q: -- okay. Wh-When you were still over there in Feldafing, wa -- what were your thoughts\nabout the United States? I know you said you wanted to go to Israel.",
        "A: I wanted to go to Israel because I finally -- finally we had a country that we could call our\nown.",

I guess my mother lost some of her belief because of what happened. I\nmean, how could God do this to such a pious family like my -- my parents, who were just so\ncharitable.

I remember General Haan\nto this day and by coincidence, my husband was on the General Haan when he was drafted into\nthe army and he was not sent to Korea, but instead he was sent to Germany, and he spoke\nGerman, so he had some very interesting conversation in bars with some Germans as a young\nJewish American soldier.

And -- and war 1s a horrible thing for children. I mean, it -- just terrible, I mean breaks\nmy heart there is still a lot of suffering and a lot of poverty in the world now.",
        "Q: Do you think you would have been a different person today if you hadn\u2019t gone through what\nyou did go through?",
        "A: Hard to say. I don\u2019t know. Would have been happier having had the love of my father and the\nguidance of a father. I wouldn\u2019t have felt that -- that void. That was hard, especially when I was\na teenager or later when I had to introduce my dates to my stepfather, who didn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t a\ntalker and who -- who was really [indecipherable] in my life. That was hard. And hard not\nhaving Seders and you know, I -- I\u2019m surprised I picked up as much, cause I guess it was inborn\nbecause my -- my father trained me to be -- have such feelings, but I\u2019m very involved with shul\nand it gives me comfort. But yes, I ask questions. Why and why did my husband have to die\nyoung and -- and why, but I don\u2019t feel sorry for myself, it just -- I feel sorry for those who didn\u2019t\nmake it. Why didn\u2019t my aunt, who was only seven years older than I, she never made anything,\nyou know. So I thank God for what I have, I\u2019m grateful. Yes, I\u2019m angry at the people who did\nthese horrible things. Th-The farmers, how -- how they could turn like that on my grandparents,\nwho were such pious people and you say why? You know, you\u2019re supposed to be rewarded with\nsedakah and you know [indecipherable] Hasidim and --",
        "Q: Are you more comfortable around people who\u2019 ve -- that -- who are survivors also?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: Are you more comfortable around others who -- other people who are survivors as opposed to\npeople who were -- who didn\u2019t have to go through what --",
        "A: There\u2019s a special bond, but it\u2019s interesting that you ask that. \u2019m very comfortable. However,\nwhen my husband and I joined the child survivor group and we went to a couple of meetings,\nboth of us felt that some of the people were very bitter and they had a lot of psychological\nproblems and they wore it on their sleeve, whereas my husband and I had gone through a lot, we\njust put it in the past. We were grateful for what we have here and try not to be bitter. I mean,\nwhat\u2019s the point? How you -- you survived, you\u2019re alive, you picked up the pieces. You have a\nbeautiful family, you just speak up for the -- the ones that are less fortunate and you have to\nspeak out when you see injustices done to -- you know, things that are done to other people, so\nthat it doesn\u2019t happen again. Yes, my heart bleeds for Israel, I always worry. I know I\u2019m an\nAmerican, I\u2019m a Jew, but somehow there 1 -- I have this special feeling for Israel that if God\nforbid anything would happen to Israel, you know, it -- what are we again? You know we\u2019re --\nwe're a people without a land. Yes, I -- I\u2019m a citizen of the United States, I have all my full\nrights here, but somehow I feel like I belong there becau -- and -- and I think that\u2019s as a result of\nhaving survived the war, not having a place to go, that\u2019s all. [sings] Tell me where shall I go. I\nmean, that has so much meaning to me, cause every door was closed to us. And look at how\nmany children, the innocent children, that\u2019s what really gets to me. But I\u2019m thankful for what I\nhave. You know, some people look at their glass half full and some people look at it half empty\nand I thank God for [indecipherable] yes, it could have been different, but you know, life went\non, I have a beautiful family. Hitler didn\u2019t succeed. And people tell me, we thank God you\u2019re\nhere, what do you mean you -- you say why me\u2019? It -- every shul needs a reader who\n[indecipherable] this one lady who is very sweet. I said thank you very much, but -- so -- and --\nand I hope it -- it will never happen again and -- and any of my grandchildren [indecipherable] I\nwouldn\u2019t want them to go through that. And I think because I lacked grandparents, I bend over\nbackwards to be a good grandparent. I try very hard and bond with the kids, and help out, as you\ndo with your -- your gra -- it\u2019s a pleasure. It\u2019s just a pleasure. And I don\u2019t understand how people\ncould do that to kids.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with Rita Lifschitz Rubinstein. This is tape number three, side A. You got your\nteaching certificate and then you started teaching?",
        "A: Got my teaching certificate and I was thrilled to get a job at Olney Elementary School where -\n- this was 1960. I thought I earned a lot of money, it was 7,000 a year and I was supposed to\nsupport my husband through graduate school. However in 1961 our very first child Nina was\nborn and then in \u201963 her sister Sherri and 60 si -- six, Rene. And of course we were not lacking\nfor names, unfortunately, we had lots of names to give them. Wonderful girls, we loved being\nparents and very proud of them. One is a psycholog -- she\u2019s industrial psychologist, one earned a\ndegree in law, she\u2019s an attorney and -- and the third one 1s a -- a nurse at Hopkins, and my\nhusband was privileged to walk two of them down the aisle with me and he was -- he did see\nfour grandchildren, but unfortunately the oldest, when he died in \u201995 was only six and the\nyoungest at the time was only two. So he -- he saw four grandchildren and four have been born\nsince, and he would have been so proud of all of them. Just -- I regret the fact that he never was\nthere for a Bar Mitzvah, but I -- I feel that he was there in spirit, because I can see some of the\ncharacteristics that he had in each and every one of my grandchildren. And we talk about him a\nlot and his -- his memory will be for a blessing and I know he\u2019ll always be remembered. And one\nof his grandchildren has a love of soccer just like he did, and she\u2019s a good soccer player. So my\ngrandchildren range in age from 20 down to two. And --",
        "Q: And their names are?",
        "A: -- I thank God for them. I -- names are Sammy, which would have been my -- my uncle who\nwas killed in the Holocaust. Then I have a Max, Maxwell David Heller and he\u2019s named after my\nfather, David. And -- and then we have Alexis. She has other grandparents who are survivors\ntoo, so she was named after that side. And then we have Mitchell, Mitchell Heller and he was\nnamed after my late husband\u2019s brother, Baruch -- Benny. And then came Tobi, Tavulah, who is\nmy mother, named after my mother and she was born si -- six weeks after my husband died. It\nwas too hard to give her hi-his name. And after Tobi came Jacklyn and she has my husband\u2019s\nname Natanya, which is a gift from God. And then my daughter Rene has the two younger ones,\nshe has Chelsea and Blake, who are -- unfortunately don\u2019t have Hebrew names because she\nmarried a non-Jew. And -- but I love them all and that\u2019s my mishpokhe. I am proud of all of\nthem.",
        "Q: Can we talk a little bit more about your thoughts? Are there any sights -- sights or smells or\nreminders that you come across today that kind of make you go back in time to your experience?",
        "A: In time from when I was a little girl?",
        "Q: Yeah, when you were little, going through the war. Anything today that sparks a return in\nyour mind?",
        "A: I know Seders and Sukkoth, I always had tears in my eyes when I saw people celebrating\nPesach because I -- I didn\u2019t have that, I\u2019d -- I\u2019d recall [indecipherable] I was very little and I\nrecall the Sukkoth, but yeah, that\u2019s why I -- I really celebrate them fully and always invite people\nto Seder. Smells, I -- I\u2019ve -- I know from what my mother told me about her mother having been\nsuch a wonderful balabusta, she made everything from scratch, so whether it\u2019s -- I was told the\ndifference, she was an excellent cook and an excellent baker and -- and did everything, but I\nreally don\u2019t --",

I\u2019d have to do it on my own and of course when I went to court I had\nalready been through school so I did -- 1t was a joke the questions that they would ask, I knew I\nwould pass. It felt very good. Felt I belonged and it was great. Didn\u2019t feel anti -- any anti-\nSemitism, so --",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in the United States?",
        "A: Personally no, but my grandchildren here and there have, and they\u2019ve heard it, and so that\nwas very hurtful to me and they were very angry. And this -- a hockey field, ice hockey?\nParticular instance where -- yeah.",

I did -- oh, I shouldn\u2019t say, I did\nexperience it. My uncle had a house in the country and suddenly I saw a sign, no dogs or Jews\nallowed. And this was the country club, yes. So I knew that there were places that were\nforbidden and I knew that Jewish students had a tough time here, I mean I -- I learned history.\nWhen they went to medical school and other places, it was -- 1t was harder for them. But we\nwere always known as the people of the book, and we -- so we excelled, we knew we had to\nexcel.",
        "Q: Do you think of yourself a survivor? Do you call yourself that?",

There was a lot of\nunspoken, but we had so much more in common. And there\u2019s a special bond that we all --\nsurvivors have. So I think yes. My children also know that they\u2019re the product of survivors. They\nthink they were brought up differently because -- well, I don\u2019t think so because I co -- I consider\nmyself American, I -- I went through schools here, public schools, but I definitely feel like \u2019'ma\nsurvivor. I survived the war, I feel I can survive anything. I\u2019m also a cancer survivor, so --",
        "Q: You -- you started to talk about your teaching experience and then you had the children and\nthen did you go to --",
        "A: All right. At the time when I was teaching my career ended early because I became pregnant\nand they didn\u2019t want pregnant women in the school system. So I decided to rear them when they\nwere very young, myself and stay home and do with a little bit less materially. And then when I\nwas member of Hadassah and somebody was teaching at the Chaim Weizmann Yiddish Hebrew\nSchool and they needed a music teacher and Yiddish teacher and so I said oh, it sounds\nwonderful and I went for an interview and got the job. So I taught Yiddish music, brought me\nback to my music and my days in DP camp, and Hebrew and [indecipherable]. And then after\nmy teaching there about four or five years, the principal, Frieda Frank had retired and she asked\nme to take over for her. I became principal and I enjoyed that very much. And as a -- a Hebrew\nschool teacher I also went to different training session and I was trained to become a Bar and Bat\nMitzvah tutor. I learned the trope for Torah and Haftorah. And I had private students. I did it for\na number of my friends, they were my guinea pigs in the beginning. Friends\u2019 children that 1s,\nwho are now all grown and have children beyond the Bar Mitzvah years. So I enjoyed that very\nmuch. I\u2019ve also taught adult -- adults -- ve had four adult B\u2019nai Mitzvah that I -- I trained and\nthat was rewarding. And right now they all -- all the training I do is for my grandchildren. I\u2019ve\nhad the pleasure of -- of teaching three of -- four of actually -- five of my grandchildren,\nprepared them for Bar and Bat Mitzvah and I\u2019m looking forward to the others in the future, yeah.",
        "Q: That\u2019s wonderful.",
        "A: And I -- I think it\u2019s wonderful that I belong to an egalitarian shul where we were given\ncomplete rights and I can read Torah and Haftorah, I do that in memory of -- of my parents and I\nchant the Haftorah and privileged to ha -- ha -- I\u2019m happy to have the privilege to give -- to be\ngiven the opportunity where I could read Torah, because I remember we were not always\negalitarian and when my mother died and I went to shul every day to say Kaddish, they didn\u2019t\nrecognize me as part of the minyan and I fought it -- and we fought it and under our new rabbi,\nRabbi Jonah Layman, he gave us full rights and I was very happy. W-We actually got those --\nwe were counted in the minyan before Jonah joined us and I was happy because unfortunately\nwhen my husband died and he didn\u2019t leave any male heirs and my daughters went to say\nKaddish, they did not look for a 10\" man, they were counted in the minyan. So I am very proud -\n- | don\u2019t know what my grandparents are thinking about it, but I -- I\u2019m very happy that we have\nequal rights, cause they were all Orthodox.",
        "Q: Do you have any survivor friends or have you talked to survivors, other survivors who say\nthey\u2019ve lost their faith because of what they went through?",
        "A: Well, my own mother really was not as pious here as she had been. She -- sh-she -- she was\nnot Orthodox any more, she traveled on Shabbat and a -- yes, she kept kosher, definitely and --\nas I do. But she was angry with God, yes, so to speak and yes I have survivor friends and we do\nhave a special bond, have older friends and younger friends and they\u2019re -- they\u2019re like family.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial?",
        "A: Oh, I was watching that and I -- I was overwhelmed by what people went through and\nsometimes I f -- I felt guilty that I didn\u2019t go through as much as some people and what -- what 1s\nstrange, the competition sometimes bothers me among survivors. When you tell them where\nyou\u2019re from, or what you\u2019ve gone through, they say oh, that\u2019s nothing. You were not in\nAuschwitz or Dachau, you don\u2019t have a number. But how are they to say what I\u2019ve experienced\nand what losses -- I\u2019ve had losses. I was robbed of a childhood. And in a way that\u2019s what kept\nme away from some of the groups, because I was never honored -- not in my shul, my shul I\u2019ve\nbeen honored many times, but never honored to light a candle, and Transnistria existed, it was a\nlabor camp. So in a sense I felt a little hurt. I didn\u2019t make waves, but -- and a -- I\u2019ve heard other\npeople experience the same thing. People, for instance who were in Russia. My friend Ada, she\nalso experienced that, they say, what did you go through? And you were a kid, you can\u2019t\nremember much. But we did. We\u2019re robbed of our childhood and -- and we certainly went\nthrough a holocaust, our own personal holocaust.",
        "Q: How would you describe yourself? Are you an American, are you Jewish, are you Romanian?",
        "A: No, definitely not Romanian. I have no desire to go back. Well, sometimes --",
        "Q: That was going to be my next question, right.",
        "A: Yeah, sometimes I\u2019ve wanted see where [indecipherable] say oh, it wasn\u2019t so great. I would --\nI\u2019m proud to say I\u2019m an American, yes, very proud and a -- I\u2019m a Jew first. I will always feel\nvery, very Jewish, because no matter what, the Jews who\u2019ve tried to hide that they were Jewish,\nyou couldn\u2019t hide it. Even those who had, they say [indecipherable] whatever, even if you had a\nlittle blood, the great-great grandparents, those Germans found you and they labeled you, you\nwere a Jew. But no, I don\u2019t mean it in that sense, I am proud of who I am. I\u2019m proud of my\npeople, things that we\u2019ve gone through and we persevere. And that\u2019s why we exist. And we --\nwe cling to our belief that the -- the Torah, if we only would all practice what the Torah preaches\nit would be a wonderful world. And the same thing for the Christians.",
        "Q: What do you think your reasons are for doing this interview?",
        "A: What are the reasons?",
        "Q: For doing this interview.",
        "A: To keep the memory alive and to say to deniers, you can\u2019t deny it, it happened. Let\u2019s hope it\nnever happens again.",
        "Q: Mm. Before we close, is there any message you wanted to give to your grandchildren?\nAnything special you wanted to say to them, or --",
        "A: Yes. First of all, I mean, to my children and grandchildren, I love them very much, I\u2019m very\nproud of them, but I want them to remember to always be proud ... of their heritage, proud of\nbeing Jewish and always fight for the underdog, do not stay -- stand back and say oh, they don\u2019t\nmean me. Even if it\u2019s somebody out of the religion, out of your faith, always speak up for the\ntruth and for justice. And -- and do the right thing, as Grandpa said, always do the right thing.\nAnd know I\u2019II be with you, watching over you no matter where I am and I\u2019Il always love you.",
        "Q: Well that -- well that [tape interruption]. Have you been to the Holocaust ceremony at the\nrotunda of the capital, United States capital?",
        "A: Yes, and I will never forget the very first time I was seated in the rotunda. It was an\noverwhelming experience, very emotional. I have taken, when we were allowed to, I have taken\ntwo of my grandchildren there and two of my daughters there. I -- I said -- it was such a -- an\noverwhelming emotional experience, I wanted them to experience it. Of course they experienced\nit differently than I did. But the first time I sat in the rotunda and suddenly I saw all the military\nwalking in with the flags that liberated the camps, I -- I just started crying like a baby. It was a\nfeeling of joy and a feeling of sadness and a feeling of saying well here I am, the greenhorn,\nsitting in the United States, a citizen, a -- in the rotunda and being with other survivors and\nseeing the flags and it brought back memories of the war and saying why me, why was I\nprivileged? And especially this year it was very emotional because I sat very close to the stage\nand there was Elie Wiesel sitting next to our President Obama. And President Obama addressing\nus. I-I will never forget that, I was really choked up, it was quite an experience. And it -- it made\nme proud to be an American and seeing that they recognize the Holocaust. I mean, it\u2019s sad that\nwe had it but at least it\u2019s there and -- and they recognize it by honoring the memory of the dead\nby having the Holocaust Museum, which is a-an educational tool and -- and I see so many people\nfrom different walks of life on line and that makes me feel good. Because hopefully through\neducation, something like this will not happen again. And so I have volunteered and I will start\nworking at the Holocaust Museum myself. It\u2019s difficult, yes. Having been through the museum,\nit\u2019s -- it\u2019s ha -- very hard to take when you see very graphic pictures and when you walk into a\nroom with pictures of smiling faces and families that were, that are no longer here because the\nentire town was gone, maybe a fe -- a handful of people survived, that\u2019s very hard, but it\u2019s an\nimportant lesson. And I think people should go and -- and be educated and I\u2019m glad that they are\noffering it now as part of the curriculum in the schools. So I think it\u2019s my duty, it\u2019s time for me\nto -- to do some volunteering there as well.",
        "Q: Are there any names of relatives you\u2019d like to mention that we haven\u2019t talked about?",
        "A: Yeah, my mother -- my grandparents, my mother\u2019s side, my -- my grandfather Zev\nMirabaum, Worf Mirabaum and his wife, Zora Brina Mirabaum. Her brother Shmul, or Sammy,\nas they called him. A-Anita, Menusha and Esther, who would have been only seven years older\nthan I, she was born in 1929. May their memory be for a blessing and my [indecipherable] my\ngrandma -- my father -- my father\u2019s mother who -- who died in labor camp in Transnistria, were\nwonderful -- they were wonderful people.",
        "Q: Before we close, you had been talking about a singing group that you have started, can we\nend on that note? Tell me a little bit about the singing group.",
        "A: We\u2019re called Die Freyliche Knaidlach which -- the Happy Dumplings. And we sing mostly\nYiddish songs and some Ladino and Hebrew songs. And we bring joy to people. We\u2019ve sung in\nvarious -- he -- in Hebrew homes and nursing homes. We\u2019ve sung at the Israeli embassy, at\nCatholic University, Montgomery College, University of Maryland. And music is wonderful\nmedicine for some people. It 1 -- it evokes such emotion. People with Alzheimer\u2019s who have not\nspoken for quite some time suddenly start crying and singing along with us. We derive a lot of\npleasure and at the same time we feel we\u2019re doing a mitzvah and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s wonderful for us as\nwell. It\u2019s a healing. Music really heals. We love bringing some joy, some freyliche to people and\nit was s -- it really saved me after my husband died. I immersed myself in it and I\u2019m teaching\nYiddish to my fellow knaidlach and they enjoy it immensely too and it brings joy to people. So\nI\u2019m -- I\u2019m happy to be part of the group.",
        "Q: Do-Does your group have a motto or a slogan?",
        "A: Yes, and just like knaidlach, we find ourselves offering hot soup, sometimes in cold soup or\njust like good knaidlach we always rise to the top. And that\u2019s it. I am also involved in other two\nmusical groups, the [indecipherable] choir and the Gaithersburg chorus. And we do quite a few\nYiddish songs there as well.",

And it was on a Shabbat; Shabbat\nHanukah that I was born on. I was born into a very loving family. At the time my father was\ndoing very well. He was -- had a textile business. We sh-shared a home with his sister and her\nfamily. She had two children, a little girl eight months younger than I, and a boy six years --\nseven years older than I. We shared the business and the store as well.",
        "A: I was born in Waszkow, or Waszkowitz, Romania.",
        "A: My father\u2019s name was Abram David Lifschitz. He was one of -- of four children, the only\nson. And my grandmother became a widow after World War I, so she sent her two oldest girls to\nthe golden land, the golden amadina. They were only 16 and 18 and the younger two children\nremained with her. And they have immigrated to the United States. My mother came from a\npious family in a little village where my grandfather had an orchard, apple orchard and he had a\ndry goods store as well.",
        "A: And -- her name was Tavu Shangel Mirbaum. She was the eldest and was the first to get\nmarried and of course, produced their first grandchild. I had an aunt that was only seven years\nolder than I. And unfortunately, they were all killed.",
        "A: They lived there all their lives as far as I know.",
        "A: And when my mother met my father and married, she moved to Waszkow.",
        "A: A-Actually yes. They were introduced. My grandpar -- my -- my grandmother -- my great-\ngrandparents, my grandmother\u2019s parents lived in Waszkow and they knew, they said, a very nice\nyoung man. And so they were introduced, and at that time you didn\u2019t even hold hands in the\nstreet and I think they saw them holding hands and it was really not very ladylike. She got\nreprimanded for that. But he was -- they were really meant for each other. He was a wonderful\nperson from what I heard and they had a very loving and wonderful marriage.",
        "A: They got married in 1934, and two years later I was born.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: My mother came from a very pious family. My grandfather had a -- a long beard, and of\ncourse everything was homemade. I heard my grandmother was an excellent balabusta. She\nmade everything from scratch and she sewed beautifully. I -- she sewed outfits for me as well.\nAnd we lived -- my grandmother lived with us, my father\u2019s mother, who was also a very pious\nwoman. She wore a sheitel which 1s a wig, and va -- she was with us during the war and of\ncourse, died in the war.",
        "A: Thanks to my grandmother, at the time the Jewish people spoke German, the more cultured\nfamilies wanted expose their children to German at home. But since my grandmother\n[indecipherable] lived with us, she insisted and she said, I do not want my grandchild speaking\ndeutschmueller she used to refer to 1t, making fun of the German language, but I want her to\nspeak Yiddish. So my very first language, my mamalashen was Yiddish.",
        "A: Mm-hm. He employed people in the textile -- they had textile machines. They had it -- it\u2019s\nattached to the house and they manufactured peasants\u2019 skirts and shawls and -- which they sold\nin their dry goods store to the villagers. Beautiful, colorful fabrics and he was doing well because\nhis sister said, maybe you should come to the United States and he was finally getting on his feet\nand he said no, we\u2019re doing well here in Europe. And he was in business together with his\nbrother-in-law, his sister\u2019s husband. And we shared a two -- was a two family home. And so\nthings were going well for us, I had dolls and doll carriages and I would play outside and was a\nhappy time.",
        "A: Well, the Jews pretty much lived in the same area. Was a pretty modern town. My father went\nto shul every Shabbat. He had a beautiful voice, I guess I\u2019ve inherited that from him, and he used\nto be the[indecipherable]. He also belonged to the Havra Kadisha, which is the burial society.\nVery giving, as my grandmother was, they were very pious. He had a sukkah and at that time\nonly the men would eat in the sukkah and the children. And my mother told me that he would\ntake me to shul every Shabbat. And I think -- I didn\u2019t know that, but I loved going to services,\nand I too like to conduct the services, I\u2019m a shuli hatsidore, and to follow in his footsteps, years\nlater I -- I became part of the Havra Kadisha also --",
        "A: Of my town?",
        "A: My earliest memories were happy.",
        "A: Had a -- had a happy, loving childhood. Would visit my grandparents and they adored me.\nMy aunts, uncles. So for the most part it was loving, and -- but my grandmother who lived with\nus didn\u2019t allow me to take my toys -- oh, she said, she\u2019I] use it up. Why is she always in the\nstreet playing with the children? And -- course, it was very short-lived, but it was a happy\nchildhood. I was with my cousin, who was just eight months younger and I recall it being happy\nand content. We had a radio, we had running water.",
        "A: We lived in a house, yes.",
        "A: More or less, I believe, but I really don\u2019t recall exactly. I don\u2019t have an address.",
        "A: The street where I played, yes. Some memories, whether they\u2019re my own or because they\nwere related to me. When I would come to my grandparents in the little village, they would give\nme a bath outside. And I would watch my grandmother make her own butter, and how she\nchurned it. It\u2019s just fragmented memories here. I do remember a Sukkor here and there.",
        "A: That I really don\u2019t remember, just is -- I remember sadness after that, that was all.",
        "A: Well, the -- as I recall, the Russians came in first and they drafted all young men. They\ndrafted my father into the army and that was -- we did not know, but it was to be the last time\nthat I saw him, when we said our goodbyes and he left on a train with other soldiers. My uncle\ngot out of it because of -- I don\u2019t know how, but he stayed with us. So he was the head of that\nwhole family, with my mother and I and luckily her sister, who was sent to live with us.",
        "A: Do I have memories?",
        "A: Of my father?",
        "A: He was a tall man, a handsome man, very loving, always smiling.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s exactly my memory or what I\u2019ve been told, cause it\u2019s -- was a long time\nago.",
        "A: Yes. Then the war broke out [indecipherable] in \u201941, and the Jews were told, we were told\nthat we would be evacuated and we had to be ready within 48 hours and we could only take\nwhatever we could carry with us, whatever was on our backs and in a little knapsack. Even\nthough I was only four years old, I do recall when they first came marching into town, my cousin\nhad gone up to the attic and he was looking outside. And soldiers saw him and I remember they\ncame knocking on the door with bayonets and my mother said for us to hide under the beds. So\nthe children, we hid under the beds, and they said, where is this spy? She said there were no\nspies, this was a child that was looking out the window, she saw you marching. No, we saw a\nspy. And they came with the bayonets, they came into my mother\u2019s bedroom, that I do recall and\nthey opened the closet door and were looking. And we were afraid, we were whimpering under\nthe bed and they made us come out from under the bed. We were lucky, they didn\u2019t sh -- and my\ncousin admitted that he was the one that was looking at them, and my mother begged them and\nsaid, don\u2019t harm these children, my husband went into the war, he\u2019s a soldier and please don\u2019t --\ndon\u2019t harm them. That\u2019s all I recall and so our lives --\nchild? Do you have any memory of that?",
        "A: Mean. I was -- it was horrible experience. I was really shivering, we were very frightened that\nwe would be shot. You know, they accused us of being spies.",
        "A: It was a frightening experience.",
        "A: That I do have a memory of.",
        "A: Some things distinctly I have a memory of.",
        "A: There were -- I\u2019m not exactly clear if they were German or Romanians who worked hand in\nhand with the German soldiers.",
        "A: Then they left my house. I then -- next thing we knew we had to pack up and my mother\ndressed me in layers of clothing.",
        "A: We have to leave. We have to leave everything behind. [indecipherable] child wanted -- I\nwanted to be with my mother.",
        "A: She -- she dressed me. I-I didn\u2019t want to wear so many things. I -- I must have worn about\nfour or five layers and on top of it, coats. And then I -- as little as I was, I had to have a knapsack\non my back, carrying other belongings, with no toys, nothing.",
        "A: No dolls, nothing.",
        "A: No, no. And the funny part was that they took -- well, my mother took my father\u2019s suits,\nthinking that -- that when he would return she wanted some clothes for him. And she took his\ntallit. So that tallit was with us. She also took the down pillows and -- and some quilts along. So\nthey really carried large bundles and then we had the -- the Jewish star on, that we had to wear.",
        "A: The yellow star.",
        "A: And then we -- we went -- were to be transported to a -- a camp.",
        "A: Do I remember wearing it?",
        "A: I do remember wearing it.",
        "A: It meant that I was different. It was frightening. I saw a lot of people, we were packed like\nsardines and they didn\u2019t tell us where we were going, but they said our destination was\nMargulav, which afterwards turned out to be -- that was a death camp. However, my\ngrandmother\u2019s half-brother was on that transport as well. He was very well-to-do. And he heard\nin the middle of the night that some soldiers -- we were at that point in a resting place, and a --\nthat --",
        "A: Yeah, after the train they brought us to a -- it\u2019s a -- was a great big hall with -- with hundreds\nof people. I know I -- I had a terrible earache there, I remember that. And in the middle of the\nnight my uncle disappeared and then he came back. And he said, we\u2019re gonna leave this\ntransport. It\u2019s dangerous, but we\u2019re gonna leave because some of the Romanian soldiers were\ntaking bribes and my grandmother had sewn some money in her bras and in her girdle. I had\nasked her why she was doing that and she said, well, I\u2019m an old lady -- she considered herself\nold then, she probably was just in her -- her 40\u2019s -- if they shoot me, but we never know, it may\nsave our lives. And sure enough, the soldiers who took the bribe, they took us over the Dniester,\nD-n-i-e-s-t-e-r river.",
        "A: Sorry.",
        "A: We walked.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: With other Jewish people.",
        "A: You know, like Anna Cheska it reminded me. When I saw that, I said oh my God.",
        "A: Yeah, it really hit me.",
        "A: You know, that I really don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Remember standing, but I don\u2019t really remember.",
        "A: Okay. Right, but they took us over to the river to a place called Chargolat, which was also in\nTransnistria. It was the Ukraine, but it was a labor camp, okay?",
        "A: And many a soldier -- th-these were barges we were on, and they drowned -- many of the\nJews were drowned, the soldiers just threw them in the -- in the river.",
        "A: I saw this. A soldier was holding me, and my mother\u2019s anguished look. He knew that she was\non the verge of tears, she said please don\u2019t hurt my child. And he said -- there were -- really God\nanswered me, I da -- I believe. He said, do not worry. I have a child this age at home, I am not\ngoing to harm her. I was blonde. I had brown eyes and I think he said I reminded him of his\nchild. So there were kindnesses that I do remember and thank God that we did make it across.\nThen our good luck was also the people that took us in, they were prima -- it was a labor camp,\nbut we\u2019d have to find our own housing. And the person that took us in wa -- they were Jewish.\nThey were also part of the labor camp, but he had one of his children, his oldest child, who was\nengaged [indecipherable] went to the riverbank to see which people looked suitable, they looked\nbalabatish to take in. We were nine people. They had a primitive clay house, that is a one\nbedroom with a hearth in the center. They were a family of four taking in ni -- they had to take\nin, they had no choice, so they picked -- they picked us, we were lucky. They picked nine of us.\nHe was a butcher, the gentleman who -- who was the owner of the house, and he took us in. It\nwas my mother and I, my grandmother and her sister, and then my father\u2019s sister and her\nhusband, two children and my uncle\u2019s mother, Baba Chana. So they took all of us in.",
        "A: No, this was in 1941, September of \u201941.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: And the reason I -- I asked, I said how come my mother wasn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t recall her being --\nfor some reason they had mercy, that if you had a small child, they didn\u2019t take you into the labor\ncamp. Her sister worked in the tobacco fields and she also worked in an area where they dried\napples and fruit and tomatoes. She wasn\u2019t allowed to -- she would have been shot if she would\nhad taken any food out. Thus we experienced a lot of hunger. Whatever we could get, that\u2019s --\nluckily my aunt, who was very handy with a needle and she -- she sewed beautifully and she\nknitted beautifully. And she found some people from home who were not Jewish, but they were\nalso transported to this camp. The two women who gave her work to do on the side, and after she\ncame home from labor, and in exchange, they would give her food here and there. So we would\nhave a potato floating in the water. I would have a -- a piece of bread with some oil occasionally.\nBut as a child I remember you -- we found other -- even though I saw death, I saw people dying\nin the street and starving, they didn\u2019t have a roof over their heads, and as primitive as the\nconditions were -- there was no running water, there was no -- there were no toilet facilities. I\nremember going in a pail, having to go outside in the very bitter cold of the winter. My aunt and\nuncle stayed with us only for one year, but then they -- they left, they went to a different camp. It\nwas ju -- we just couldn\u2019t make it together, 1t was too hard.",
        "A: All living with that family but my mother and I stayed --",
        "A: Yes. I found out. Yoshka Nousins Brytank.",
        "A: Okay. Brytburt, Brytburt. Yoshka Nousins Brytburt. That was his name.",
        "A: They were very nice actually. They -- they had nothing so they couldn\u2019t share with us. But\nyou can imagine ah -- all I remember is so many of us in this one great big room. They had a\nbedroom, but we had to find sleeping quarters for nine of us. My uncle had typhoid fever and\nthey were very, very nice, they let us -- let him be in the bedroom when he was so ill, they di --\nthey didn\u2019t want him to infect the rest of us, and he was lucky, he made it. But it was a very, very\nhard time and I remember my aunt would get very upset with my cousin who was older. She\nsaid, why don\u2019t you steal like other children, so we could have a piece of bread? And -- and he\nsaid, I can\u2019t do it, I can\u2019t. It\u2019s not in my nature, I will not do it. And that\u2019s when they decided to\nleave and see if they, you know, they -- they didn't want it to be a burden. Here we were women,\nall women, and it was hard for her to leave her mother behind, cause her mother is the one that\nstayed with us, my grandmother, but she also had her husband\u2019s mother and so they went to a\ndifferent camp where she worked on -- on hats, and -- a different labor camp.",
        "A: Yes, they had two, they were older.",
        "A: They had two older children, yeah, one was about to be married.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We were there until \u201944, April of \u00b044.",
        "A: In this same house. I watched my grandmother [indecipherable]. She died in that house, she\nhad stomach cancer. And she had shrouds that were being made for her and I would ask her --\nyou know, a child is very inquisitive, what are these? Why is all this white? And she said, that\u2019s\nfor when they bury me. And she had a little sack of soil that her brother was able to get for her, it\nwas the soil from Israel, as you know, traditionally that\u2019s what we\u2019re buried with. And she knew\nthat her son would never come back, she had that feeling. And she never was to see her\ndaughters again, the one from the United States and she didn\u2019t know what would happen to us\neither, we were all in danger. And when she died, she -- oh, she asked me, she said, I want you to\nlight the candles. But what they didn\u2019t do, they didn\u2019t take me to the cemetery. I remember they\ndid the taharat, they prepared her body for burial right in that room where we lived. And that was\nsuch a -- such a traumatic things for me. And of course when the finished I lit the candle, but\nthen they took her away and they didn\u2019t let me come to the ceremony. Klainer kinder, little\nchildren you don\u2019t take to the cemetery. That is imbedded in my memory, I will never forget\nthat, it was really, really difficult. It was my first experience with -- with loss, somebody close\nlike that who died.",
        "A: I -- you know, I don\u2019t know exactly, but --",
        "A: I think it was about a year and a half in [indecipherable] I wou -- I would think it would be\nabout f -- I would say \u00b042 - 1942.",
        "A: So she did have a -- a burial site. She was the only one of my grandparents who -- well, she\nand her -- her husband of course died in World War I. I don\u2019t recall them saying that he had a --\na burial ground, I don\u2019t know. But -- so that was it.",
        "A: As far as what did I do there, we played with little stones. My mother made a -- a rag doll for\nme out of straw. What kept us alive was cleanliness. My mother had to go about a mile and a\nhalf to a running -- running water where she would do our laundry, made sure that we were\nclean. And I fell into that river once. I went with my mother and -- and my cousin, and my\ncousin suddenly said, Tante Tavu, there\u2019s a kinder in wasser. Aunt Tavu, there\u2019s a little child in\nthe water. And my mother takes a look and that little child is -- 1s her daughter, and she did not\nknow how to swim, so luckily she was doing our sheets and she threw the sheet 1n and she told\nme to grab onto it, and I did, but I did not speak for three days. They had me lying down, I -- that\nI remember cause to me it was like witchcraft. There was this woman that came and -- and broke\nan egg on my forehead and she started talking --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Well, I could not speak, so they brought in this woman who broke an egg on my forehead.\nShe said all kinds of abra kadabra language that was not familiar to me. I still didn\u2019t speak, it\nwas traumatic for me, and for the family.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, the -- yes, she was Jewish. They called in a specialist, so to speak, and\nluckily after three days I -- I came back and started speaking. But this was the second time that\nmy mother almost lost me and it was very frightening for -- for her. But as a child I -- I found\nother children, we played with little rocks and there was even a little pre-kindergarten class\norganized by people and I remember going and learning my very first Hebrew, because you had\nto say what you were bringing. So I had [speaks Hebrew] which okay, bread and -- and some oil,\noccasionally. It was very brief, I recall fragments, you know. We learned a song here and there\nand I was with other children. And even though the times were horrible and I saw starvation and\npeople begging in the streets and death, somehow as a child you find some happiness with other\nchildren, you just -- I mean, I saw a lot of sadness but I guess to protect yourself you just want to\nstep back and live in your own little dream world.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t recall her name. I can find out.",
        "A: No, food, we were always hungry, no. I remember being cold, being hungry. Yes, we did\nhave clothing from home that, you know, luckily when we dressed in all those layers. And our\nown bedding that my mother carried with us, so that s -- that saved us. And there was a\npotbellied stove and they -- they did heat it, but the winters were bitter there, bitter cold.",
        "A: She herself was just so forlorn, not knowing where her husband was, not hearing a thing\nabout him. Not knowing anything about her parents or the fate of her -- her sibling. She was\nloving and -- but I -- I really don\u2019t recall the stories she made up for me. They were bad people,\nshe said. Do anything --",
        "A: -- to good people.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "A: How could I not know?",
        "A: Separation. I -- I heard bombing. I heard what was going on. Noises always scared me, I s --\ndogs always scared me, because I had seen dogs chasing people, and I have -- to this day when I\nsee a German Shepherd, I hate it. My friend had to put her German Shepherd out in a kennel\nwhenever we\u2019d come to visit, because I just would not even get up from the table. And this was a\nfriendly dog, but he was ju -- 1-1t just -- I couldn\u2019t st -- deal with it. To this day. So there are\nsome things that I -- I hate the -- the noise, 1t always startled me.",
        "A: It was an existence. We would wake up hungry, we\u2019d see what there was to eat, we had\nsomething to drink. Nutrition was very poor, no milk, no -- you know, the hygiene too. I don\u2019t\nremember brushing teeth and things like that.",
        "A: That\u2019s why my teeth are so horrible, and as a result I -- I was sick after the war.",
        "A: There weren\u2019t many that I saw, many children, but --",
        "A: No -- I don\u2019t re --",
        "A: We just played with, you know, my cousin and then they left and -- and then I found some\nother children and my mother was with me. It was --",
        "A: Yes, I heard speeches before we were deported, because we had a radio.",
        "A: And yes, it was like the wild man talking.",
        "A: No, I -- I just heard how it was said, it was -- sounded horrible.",
        "A: You know.",
        "A: You knew hatred and I guess my parents explained it. But they really didn\u2019t know what was\ngoing on either, nobody knew exactly what was going to happen.",
        "A: Did I see swastikas, no.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",

        "A: No, mm-mm.",
        "A: I mean, I don\u2019t know if I want to blot that memory out, but it\u2019s not a pleasant memory.",
        "A: But I did have this memory of -- of playing with some stones and a little rag doll and going\nwith my mother to the river to wash clothes.",
        "A: You know I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t -- I can\u2019t remember, we -- my mother said we found little things\nthat made us happy and -- and we played for hours just with other children, and conversing.",
        "A: And singing. Yes. She said well, after the war, maybe he\u2019ll come back and --",
        "A: You hope.",
        "A: Don\u2019t recall any but my mother said I learned a couple of Hebrew songs here and there and I\nw -- I wish I had written down what, but I have no recollection.",
        "A: No, not yet.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, my only schooling was right after we were liberated.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: That I recall.",
        "A: The days went on, seemed like forever, and then right before liberation, our --",
        "A: Which was -- we were liberated in April of \u201944.",
        "A: We -- we got there September \u201941 --",
        "A: -- and the Russians liberated us in \u201944. But the night before liberation there was a lot of -- a\nlot going on in the camp and people were afraid because they were going to be bombings, you\nknow, the front was pushing towards that area. And so the [indecipherable] from our -- our\nlandlord, so to speak, they had a house with a basement and a sub-basement and they took us\ninto a sub-basement where we were all hiding. They had a -- a little boy who suddenly\ndisappeared and they were afraid for him because he ran out in the street. And that\u2019s how we\nfound out though that the Russians actually came, because he was out and when he came back he\nreported that there was drinking in the street and he saw Russian soldiers. So in -- I guess the\nfront broke through and at that point we knew that the war was over. And then our -- our journey\nback home, so to speak, began.",
        "A: It meant that I was going home. I thought I was going back to my house. I thought I would\nreunite with my father, I thought I would see my grandparents again, my aunts and uncles, which\nunfortunately was not to be.",
        "A: But there was euphoria, there was happiness that we lived through that horrible period so far,\nand we were going to pick up the pieces and go back, what we thought was home.",
        "A: Yeah, my aunt left every day.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yep.",
        "A: I saw marching and I saw people begging in the street.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Oh, was not too good. She was ra -- always sad, but she put up a good front for me, and I\nguess her mother-in-law, who was a lovely woman, and --",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Oh, we didn\u2019t. We left as soon as we were liberated. We left -- I -- don\u2019t ask me, we got ona\ntrain and we went back to Waszkow.",
        "A: No -- yes and no, you know, we thanked them, of course, that they took us in, we were very\ngrateful. And they finally had their house to themselves, but it was very primitive compared to\nthe home that we\u2019d left. When we came back to Waszkow, the Russians -- the Iron Curtain set\nin, and the same real estate people that my aunt was working for when she came to visit -- not\nvisit, to stay with my parents because her father wanted her out when the Russians initially came.\nHe -- he was in charge of a bank, so he invited my aunt to come and work for the bank. But\nwhen we went to our house, it was used as a silo, and they said no, you cannot -- they had\nproduct there, you cannot come in. My mother said look, my husband was fighting the war at\nthat time, he\u2019s a soldier and I just want the pictures that I have in the attic. Can I go into the attic,\ncause I don\u2019t have any pictures. And they did let her go in the attic, I don\u2019t -- and where we were\npermitted to live was my great-grandparents house was converted for the returnees, those who\ncame back home but they couldn\u2019t go into their home. So we were given a room in my great-\ngrandparents house --",
        "A: -- which was not far from where we used to live, okay. And I started going to kindergarten --",
        "A: She found pictures, but she didn\u2019t find the money that she had hidden [indecipherable |",
        "A: She got -- took the photo album and took the pictures, right. They were precious, cause some\npeople have lost -- my husband didn\u2019t have a picture left, nothing. He\u2019s just told how beautiful --\nwhat a beautiful baby he was, but he never saw it.",
        "A: Nothing, everything was gone.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, was converted into a silo, they had --",
        "A: -- no, they had products there, no. No, no, nothing was -- was there.",
        "A: Did I? No.",
        "A: Only my mother.",
        "A: And there [indecipherable] my mother put herself in danger with my aunt -- oh, and my aunt\ncame too, from the other labor camp, we were together again. And they would sell different\nproducts so that we could have food on the table. And of course my aunt had a job. And then my\nuncle again found out that if he falsified -- there was a -- a Pole that he knew, a friend. And he\nsaid to him, I\u2019m going to register my family, cause I want to get out. You should also see if you\ncan have false papers drawn up, because I would suggest that you leave this place, it\u2019s going to\nbe hard to leave Russia, if you don\u2019t leave -- we were there for a brief period of time. We got\nthere April \u201944, and we were out by -- by \u00b040 -- \u00b045.",
        "A: Na -- we were there about a year, not even a year.",
        "A: [indecipherable] excuse me?",
        "A: Oh, my uncle\u2019s name was [indecipherable] oh, Mendel. Mendel. Mendel Machlovich. He was\nmarried to my father\u2019s sister Esther.",
        "A: Okay? And this -- a friend of -- of my Uncle Mendel, Mr. Schlitz, his wife was Polish, so he\nknew -- he told us that all ethnic Poles were going to leave the Iron Curtain and that\u2019s when he\ntold him to have these papers falsified. And Mendel, my uncle, decided to lie and say they were\nPolish so they would get then into Poland. And he went with my mother and registered me, that\u2019s\nwhen he made me the two years younger. And my aunt was -- he said that my aunt was his sister.\nI don\u2019t know what he made my mother into, but --",
        "A: Because he had a child that was eight months old and it -- I couldn\u2019t be older because he had\nanother -- he had a son, so he thought that if I would be younger than his daughter, it would\nmake more sense. So they got these false papers and my aunt was not allowed to leave. We were\nall on the train, ready to leave, and my aunt worked in the bank. My mother went to beg her empl\n-- her sister\u2019s employer\u2019s wife to please speak to her husband and let -- and let her s -- only sister\ngo. Oh, and what I didn\u2019t bring up, my mother and aunt found out the fate of their parents. They\nwanted to go back to the little village where their parents lived, but as it turned out they found a\nneighbor of my grandparents who was living in Waszkow aft-after liberation, and they inquired.\nThey said, what happened to our parents? Well, they proceeded to give them the blow by blow\ndescription. The Ukrainians worked hand in hand with -- you know, they were anti-Semites too,\nand they were glad to comply with the government, you know, to get rid of the Jews, and this\nway they had their belongings because my aunt saw him wear -- my mother did too, my\ngrandfather\u2019s shirt. And when they went to the house they saw -- you know, they prepared a\nhope chest. My aunt would have been the next one to get married and my grandmother already\nstarted a hope chest for her and they saw that there and they saw some of the furnishings. And\nthey said that my grandfather escaped briefly, but they said there was HaSharah, they used to\ntrain religious boys in kibbutz life and there was a ri -- so he -- he went there for awhile because\nhe said they won\u2019t touch the families, yes. Well, he came back, he came back the day after his\nwife, my grandmother, the three aunts and my uncle were butchered. I call it butchered because\nthey were, with farm implements, they killed each and every one of them. And they left the\nremains and they showed him the remains. And then for some reason they had mercy and shot\nhim instead of killing him with the farm implements. And this man, this neighbor described it to\nmy mother. It was horrible, so we -- we know exactly the date when they were killed, the 10\" of\nTammuz, which was on a July -- I have it down here --",
        "A: It was in 19 -- just -- it was on ju -- on July fifth, but I don\u2019t know the -- the 10\" of Tammuz,\nand he was a day later.",
        "A: Yes. Which was -- which was horrible because my mother just tore the earrings out of her --\nyou know, when she heard all that, and you know, they became orphans in -- in a sense and --\nand my father\u2019s best friend came home and we asked him what happened to my father, where\nwas my father. And when he related he also gave us, you know, cause it\u2019s very important to the\nJewish people to know the exact Yahrzeit and when. Of course they had no burial, none of them\ndid, but at least he came back giving us when, the seventh day of Av, it\u2019s always two days before\nTisha B\u2019Av. For me it\u2019s a Tisha B\u2019 Av because from the time I was little I had to say Kaddish for\nhim. Of course then it was only Orthodox, so the girls didn\u2019t say, so that\u2019s when I found out I -- I\ndidn\u2019t have a father any more. And that was very difficult. He was always -- I always missed\nhaving a father in my life.",

But -- and I had the love of my mother\nand -- and her sister and then I went to school and I remember the Russian soldiers looking over\nmy report card and -- and saying, oh you\u2019re such a good student [Russian] means outstanding,\noutstanding. But I was very scared, I used to walk to school through the woods. And I had to\nrecite poetry from memory, remembering -- I learned Russian, Ukrainian, we learned -- and we\nwere told to kiss Stalin\u2019s picture cause these were -- these schools were run by communists.",

She was his assistant and she happened to be in Shargarat at the time and she needed\nsome things that had to be fixed.

After the -- the war when we came back to Waszkowitz, there was [indecipherable |\nwhom she -- my aunts had worked in real estate for him, but when the Russians came he became\na banker. He owned a bank and he invited her to work in the bank. So there she earned some\nmoney and we were able to purchase food and that sustained us again. My mother did a lot of\nsmuggling with her -- her sister-in-law. They -- a-and that brought food to the table, too. Ma --\nthey exchanged credits, in other words, they did not do it legally. But we were very poor, we had\nnothing left after the war, no money and so on.",
        "A: The -- what kind of foods? They fix bread, milk and -- and some butter and no luxuries.\nCheeses. I don\u2019t think they had a kosher butcher left, and we were very kosher then. It was\nmostly a -- dairy products. I don\u2019t really remember any -- eating any meats at all.",
        "A: Oh, and then there was another in-instance when we were trying to flee the Iron Curtain and\nwe were at the train station when the son of the midwife who delivered both my mother and my\naunt in their little town of Mili, or Mileev, he was married to a Polish woman and he was on the\ntransport to go to -- to Poland.

        "A: First of all, to a nine year old, it was my first taste of a formal Jewish school, where I was\ntaught Hebrew, history -- we were like sponges, we were -- had a void in our lives. We didn\u2019t\nhave much of a childhood, we didn\u2019t have time for play, we didn\u2019t have time for study. And\nsuddenly we were given mathematics and -- a-and the thirst for knowledge was unbelievab -- we\nhad wonderful teachers.",
        "A: This is in DP camp, in Feldafing.",
        "A: We were given one room, the conditions were certainly not plush, but we were given a room.\nMy mother met a man from Germany, he had lost his wife and he was in Auschwitz and in\nDachau and he lost a wife and son there. His daughter was on a Kindertransport to England, he\ndidn\u2019t know if she was alive. He was 15 years my mother\u2019s senior, but people told my mother,\nwho knew at the time she was probably going to go to the United States, but I -- my Zionism\nwas, I think, embedded in me when I started going to the school there and the love of Israel and I\nwill never forget the day that Israel was declared independent. We children -- the school was --\nconsisted of just maybe a hundred children. I have pictures of that, of DP camp. And yet we were\nso happy that those were happy times, cause we were free. And we danced all night in a bonfire\nand I told my mother, I am not going to the United States, I am going to tear up the papers. I\u2019m a\nhalf an orphan, I wanted to go on the Exodus. My aunt did not -- even though she had two sisters\nin the United States, but my cousin was seven years older than I and he swam the channel\nalready. He refused to go to the United States. But my mother said, my only sister, she had --\nthere was a quota system then. My aunt got married to a Lithuanian Jew and -- who lost his\nentire family and they were allowed to come -- immigrate to the United States right away, they\nleft in 1946 -- \u00b047. \u201946 - \u00b047. And we did not leave until \u201949, we had to wait for our quota system.\nIn the meantime we had our physical exams and many of the children in the school were found\nto have TB. I was in a camp -- they had diagnosed it three months before they even told my\nmother, and then they told her that I indeed had TB and I had to go to a sanitarium, they called it\na sanitarium then. And it was not in the same town, it was in Augsburg. And here I was, nine and\na half, 10 years old. My mother took me there initially and she left me with all the other children.\nI was only able to see her once a week, it was not close. And when she came back and was\nlooking for me, she said where is my daughter? And they said well, she is in quarantine. She has\na bad case of TB and she cannot be with other children. So I was in that sanitarium for nine\nmonths. The treatment that I needed they only gave to people who had TB of the bones, not -- I\nhad it in my lungs. And so they had to collapse a lung and th-the anti-Semitic nurses, they were\nnot -- there were some people that were nice. The doctor that I had was wonderful, the Danish\ndoctor who spoke to my mother. He said, I had TB as a child, I have a family now, don\u2019t worry,\nyour daughter will be okay. But luckily we had family here, so my mother wrote to them in the\nUnited States saying that I needed streptomycin if they could possibly get it for me. In the\nmeantime they had to perform surgery and the nurses would always tell me, you\u2019re going to go\nthrough this test, it\u2019s going to hurt. And they would give me tissues, you\u2019re going to cry. And so\nI believe that my tolerance for pain was established there because I showed them how brave I\ncould be, and no matter how much it hurt, I -- I didn\u2019t give in. I -- I had to show them. I would\nwrite letters to my mother trying to calm her down because [indecipherable] said don\u2019t worry,\nthings will be okay. I -- and I remember my mouth, I had developed a terrible tooth infection,\nthey had to send me to -- I had an abscess and I had to go through surgery, they sent me to a\ndifferent hospital where suddenly I had my period at 10 and a half. And that was so frightening,\nthat it -- I -- that I remember very vividly.",
        "A: No, because my mother never talked to me about it, but of course the -- a friend, you found\nout through friends. And we didn\u2019t have tampons, and we didn\u2019t have -- it was rags, that was\ndisgusting. But then finally you know, and the Americans brought over the pads and things. But\nI was frightened. There was a very nice counselor from HIAS who -- who would come to see me\nand she brought me a lot of handiwork to do. I still have an embroidery that I did.",
        "A: While in -- I was in the sanitarium for nine months and I was in the quarantine for -- for three\nmonths. They performed surgery, I still have the scars. While I was under the knife, my mother\ncame with the streptomycin -- this is before, and I used to get streptomycin shots every four\nhours all during the day and night. That was -- that was for three months. And after surgery I\nwould console my mother, she just wished she had saved my letters, that I saw a bird and don\u2019t\nworry, Ill be fine and I\u2019m feeling okay. But thank God I lived through it and came back to\ncamp. My cousins couldn\u2019t even say goodbye to me, they went to Israel. In the meantime they\nleft for Israel because they were not allowed, but my aunt would come with my uncle and then of\ncourse we had a wonderful reunion first time we went to Israel before the Yom Kippur war, my\nhusband and I. And I -I just can\u2019t describe it, how we felt. We both kissed the soil of Israel and\nwe were just so thrilled. But also \u2019ve been very happy in the United States. I\u2019m glad that, you\nknow, I did go with my mother, cause we did have a loving family here. I met my father\u2019s sisters\nfor the first time, who always sent packages while I was in the sanitarium. At that time they\nbelieved in feeding you. I was, you know, skinny after the war, but my fat cells grew in that\nsanitarium. Then they believed in feeding you a lot. Butter and all kinds of rich things. And they\nwould send me clothing from my cousins and my cousins would blame me for being chubby. We\nhad to eat because our cousin in Europe was starving. But with -- you know, the opportunities\nwere here. We came --",

        "A: I went back to camp at -- yeah, and I went back to school.",
        "A: What was very sad for us and -- and a-at the same time rewarding too. I\u2019ve always loved to\nsing and dance and we put on wonderful performances for the people. And that -- one\nperformance I -- I was given solo a lot, with-without any formal training but I had a good voice\nand I loved to sing and we put on some really cute shows, even without the ballet outfits, PII\nshow you the makeshift outfits they made for us. We always had managed with costumes and\nthings. But they were a handful of kids, there were only a hundred of us or so. And there were\npeople that came, survivors who came to see the shows, and one woman sat next to my mother\nand she pointed to me. She said, who knows if -- if the parents of this child is alive. There were\nso many children -- I had friends there that -- whose parents didn\u2019t survive. I mean, that was my\nlucky thing --",
        "A: -- that I survived with my mother. And she said, well, thank God, I am the parent. She said,\nhow lucky you are, and people who lost their children, it was so sad. And I learned Polish there\nbecause there were many kids who had been hidden in convents and they didn\u2019t speak a word,\nthey didn\u2019t even know they were Jewish. And they didn\u2019t speak a word of Yiddish. So, in order\nfor me to be able to converse, I learned the language. And people would start speaking Polish to\nmy mother, said I don\u2019t understand. How come? Your daughter speaks Polish. Well, my\ndaughter picked it up.",
        "A: Oh, now that was all in Yiddish.",
        "A: Yiddish or Hebrew. We learned Hebrew and we learned Yiddish.",
        "A: Absolutely, formal schooling with -- with report cards and excellent teachers, excellent tea --",
        "A: But we remember -- now they would say child molestation, sex -- sex offender, we had -- and\nit\u2019s strange, none of us -- we had a reunion here. I have two friends, dearest friends that I met in\nDP camp. They were -- one was from Poland and one was from Lithuania. We found each other.\nAnd she was just here. We had a reunion because we worked as volunteers for the army, three of\nus. And we never talked about it, I mean, we didn\u2019t think about it, cause then we were so\nashamed. There was one teacher, he was an excellent teacher, but he would invite you to his\nhome. He would say he was going to help us, you know, with the studies or whate -- very\nfriendly, very nice man and I -- I was always lacking a fatherly figure. And -- but he always was\ntouchy-feely, and you know, we were developing girls. And we never, you know, none of us\nshared it. We had a reunion, one of the survivors lived in Vancouver, and we talked about this\nteacher and all of us had this same experience, how we jumped out -- I jumped out of his\nwindow, I ran when he started, you know, anything. And they said they had the same experience.\nAnd we burst out laughing, I mean it -- it\u2019s funny to us now, but we were afraid to say anything\nto our parents or anybody, they would think we are crazy. And we felt so dirty, we felt oh my\nGod, what is he doing, you know, touching us like that.",
        "A: So it -- these teachers, a lot of them were trained as teachers and they took us on trips. There\nwere different castles and there were a lot of marbrahim that came from Israel and they talked\nabout Israel and that\u2019s why we -- we had [indecipherable] we had a different assembly for -- for\nHertzel and Schumfeldore and different celebrations.",
        "A: We learned Hebrew well, and Yiddish, right [indecipherable] that\u2019s -- yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm. That\u2019s when -- I was so delighted when I came to New York and they offered\nHebrew in the junior high school and the high school. That\u2019s what I took and I continued with it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, and we had woods nearby and I would go with my friends and we would pick\nstrawberries and all kinds of berries and mushrooms. And sometimes we would steal apples from\norchards from the Germans and we didn\u2019t -- we would get like cans of tuna fish we didn\u2019t -- and\nthey gave us Spam. I -- Spam, what the heck 1s that? So what -- my stepfather took it and he -- in\nexchange the Germans -- he would speak German very well, they gave him a chicken that we\nhad slaughtered and had chicken, cause you know, th-the food was not that great that they gave\nyou.",
        "A: We were in a -- we were in a one room with not -- all together in the one room and we had a\nlittle kitchenette. It was a barrack. The living quarters were not great, and I had hand-me-down\nclothing, but I was happy, you know. We had a table and chair -- chairs. They gave us basics that\nwe would need. We had tuna fish we didn\u2019t know what to do with. Then we find -- you know, so\npeanut butter, and --\nsee German people --",
        "A: We did not like them, I'll tell you that. It was a beautiful country, we went to see, but --",
        "A: Well, they were not in -- in uniform then --",
        "A: -- that was --",
        "A: All I know that I -- I was robbed of my father, my grandparents because of them. I didn\u2019t\nhave good feel -- but I mean, I didn\u2019t blame them all, I knew that some of them who are my age,\nthey were not at fault, they didn\u2019t do any of it, but their parents, their grandparents.",
        "A: That made us feel good. They always gave us chocolate and they were very friendly and they\nwere very outgoing and -- but they made it difficult too for us to come to the United States. We\ncouldn\u2019t wait until the quota system finally -- and we were really frightened because you had to\npass the health exam and if anybody was sick, even though Ellis Island was abolished at that\npoint, you still -- you didn\u2019t make it. And they saw calcification on my lung, so my mother\nworried about that. But thank God we had sponsors. She had great-uncles who came to the uni --\nmy -- my grandfather\u2019s stepbrothers, they were here. And so we did have some help as far as\nfinding an apartment. In the beginning it was very difficult. We lived with my aunt, my mother\u2019s\nsist -- only surviving sister.",
        "A: When we came to the United States --",
        "A: -- initially.",
        "A: I wanted to go to Israel because I finally -- finally we had a country that we could call our\nown.",
        "A: We said, how wonderful this would be, to be in our very own country. To have street\ncleaners, to have garbage men all Jewish. Of course they\u2019re not any more, but to be surrounded\nand not be frightened. To be able to hold our heads up high. And we were just so happy to hear\nabout Israel and -- and the things they were doing. Of course we knew they were in danger. The\nArabs didn\u2019t love us then and they had to fight for the freedom. But when it was declared as a\nstate, it -- but then again we also heard that the United States was so tolerant of all religions. I\nnever felt anti-Semitism at all.",
        "A: And I moved into a neighborhood -- well, initially --",
        "A: Sorry.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, in fact one of the -- there was a grandmother and a little child, her name was Mirunya\nand this grandmother told us about how she rescued her granddaughter. Her -- her children didn\u2019t\nmake it. It was an adorable child. And even though it -- we picked up -- these were the remnants\nof the war that picked up the pieces, and suddenly you saw a lot of weddings, a lot of babies that\nwere born. You saw life again. We had theater, we had the opera. I mean, there was a thirst for\nall of that that we were -- was missing from our lives.",
        "A: Lots of performances, oh --",
        "A: -- we just, it\u2019s --",
        "A: We -- we still did so -- we did a lot of Hebrew songs --",
        "A: -- in Hebrew, we\u2019d -- we did Arab dances, and it was just -- 1t was really -- you know, when\npeople say, oh DP camp -- and both my friend Ada and I said, this is a happy time. We bo -- we\nhad boyfriends, we had -- we remember two boys, we tried to locate them, but we couldn\u2019t. We\nstill remember names, I have pictures of them. There was such a bond, because everybody lost\ngrandparents, everybody lost somebody. We --",
        "A: -- we were very close knit.",
        "A: And then I was --",
        "A: Yeah, we all scattered. Everybody just went to different places. That was sad, parting like\nthat.",
        "A: I can\u2019t say --",
        "A: Oh my God, we\u2019re really going back to my youth. You know, basically the yid -- Zionist\nsongs that you know that were the very old ones, the Chenna Chenna, and [sings] I love that.\n[sings] Sang songs from Israel all the time, all the time.",
        "A: Ada Rosenberg, whose father was the journalist. She was in Russia, hiding in Russia like my\n-- my late husband. And then Ruthka, who immigrated to British Columbia with her family and\nwe found her -- we just -- unfortunately she has died, but we found her six years ago through the\nholocaust -- a little holocaust museum on the island that my friend was volunteering. And she\ntalked to her friend and she says, Ruthka, I know where Ruth -- oh, she was so excited and she\nsent us a letter. And I ran to New York when I heard she was around because we were such --\nshe says, you were my best friend in DP camp, and --",
        "A: We were very good friends, we did a lot of fun things together.",
        "A: We took walks together, we went on trips together, we -- we picked berries together, we were\nin classes together. We were in all the shows together. I have pictures of it.",
        "A: And I have one good friend who was Orthodox and I lost touch with her, but we were\ninseparable. We both had the long braids and w-we really loved one another. I remember staying\nwith her all day when my mother remarried.",
        "A: Who -- Ruth? Ruth Kran.",
        "A: Mm-hm.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: -- and she lived in the same barrack [indecipherable]",
        "A: She was exactly my age, yes, and she too was an only child. Some of parents had babies in\nDP camp, but my mother felt that I was an only child and when she remarried she didn\u2019t want me\nto feel like the stepchild -- I was a stepchild, my stepfather was not very good to me, but she\ndidn\u2019t want me -- want to bring other children into the world where I would feel the difference.",
        "A: His name was Leo Neufeld and he sort of adopted me, but I can look back and see that he lost\nhis son and wife and he was a bitter person and not very good to me, let\u2019s put it this way. Didn\u2019t\nallow me to go on trips, there -- he never came to visit me in the sanitarium. But it -- I did go on\ntrips. And we went to different ski resorts and we -- we did a lot with the Israeli [indecipherable].\nWe would have bonfires, we belonged to -- we -- in the summertime we had the\n[indecipherable], we had camps with tents. So they tried to give us as normal a life as possible,\nwhat we missed. And some people had motorcycles and -- and bicycles. My friend Ada, whose\nfather was a journalist, I thought she lived in the rich part cause she had her own room and that --\nshe said, what are you talking about, we were in barracks also. But they had a little more, she\nhad a bicycle and so did -- her brother was born there and then I had another friend, this Ruthka,\nI remember holding her brother as a baby.",
        "A: We started being interested in boys, we had Leon and then there -- there were the two twins,\nthey had crushes on both Ada Rosenberg and I, and we really -- we socialized and we -- we had\nfun together. We were so happy to be alive, happy to be in the school, and we had a -- a special\nbonding and we fought for one another. We -- we all were lacking grandparents, we all lacked a\nchildhood, we didn\u2019t have the childhood, the normal childhood. I know we didn\u2019t have any love\nleft for the Germans, let\u2019s put it this way, or the Poles for that matter. Most the Polish people,\nthey experienced when they went back home, there were -- many Poles said, what are you doing\nback? We thought they killed all the Jews. And many lost their lives, so it was -- it was sad, but\nsome were saved. There were ri -- Righteous Gentile. They were saved in nunneries and -- and\nsome Poles took them in, but of course they didn\u2019t want to give them up either. They just thought\nthey were Christian.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: You mean [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- liberated?",
        "A: Well, in -- it was the Iron Curtain --",
        "A: -- they had -- didn\u2019t display it openly --",
        "A: -- but I was afraid, as a Jew, although the communist movement, you know they -- they said\nthey loved all children and blah, blah, blah, all of that. What was interesting though was that I\nlacked religion. You know, come to think of it, you said I -- I came from a pious home, you\nknow, before the war. I guess my mother lost some of her belief because of what happened. I\nmean, how could God do this to such a pious family like my -- my parents, who were just so\ncharitable. And it was the same goyim that they were so good to. He would give them credit. He\nhad a dry goods store, but when it was their holiday and one goy would invite my grandparents,\neven though they didn\u2019t eat anything at the weddings, to the weddings. And they\u2019re the same\ngoyim that turned on them and they -- and they butchered the family? I -- how can human beings\ndo this to other human beings? You just wonder what -- what triggers it.",
        "A: That\u2019s why it\u2019s important, you know, it -- 1t could happen, God forbid, could happen again.",
        "A: Back in the DP camp.",
        "A: It was a happy time. I knew I was going to see aunts and cousins that I had never met.",
        "A: And the arrival -- oh my God, I remember that journey. I think that cured me of any cruises, I\nnever wanted to go on a cruise or on a boat. That -- of course we didn\u2019t go under plush\ncircumstances at all. We were transported on -- on the army transport. I remember General Haan\nto this day and by coincidence, my husband was on the General Haan when he was drafted into\nthe army and he was not sent to Korea, but instead he was sent to Germany, and he spoke\nGerman, so he had some very interesting conversation in bars with some Germans as a young\nJewish American soldier. But in any case, that journey was horrible. We were --",
        "A: We got there by train.",
        "A: And I know we went through all kinds of exams, and had the papers and we were allowed\nluggage and we were assigned to a huge room with bunk beds, and my mother said, if you have\nto be sick you better choose a -- a top bunk bed and we did. I was together with my mother and\nboth she and I were sick the entire time. Did not set foot into a dining room. I think we had\nmaybe two grapes -- grapefruit. If we had a grapefruit a day it was a lot and we -- but the day\nthat we landed and -- near the Statue of Liberty, I will never forget that. They -- that\u2019s where we\nfinally -- when we arrived, we got on -- onto the deck and when we saw the statue it -- you really\nfelt such welcome. And at -- it was such an overwhelming feeling, I said, why me? Why was I\nprivileged, and how come not the others? And I was happy, very happy that I was finally coming\nto a country, land of opportunity that I\u2019d heard so much about. Course I would have been happier\ngone to Israel, but I was happy, I made peace with it. After all, I wanted to be with my mother\nand other family members. And we got a big reception.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s sister, husband and baby and all the relatives on my -- from my father\u2019s side, my\n-- my father\u2019s -- my father\u2019s two sisters Aunt Bertha and Sarah and they had dinner for us --",
        "A: It\u2019s a good feeling, but 1t was strange too, cause they -- they thought we -- some of them who\nhad emigrated years ago, you know, they thought we didn\u2019t see lights and this is a light. And the\nsalad was kind of strange because we didn\u2019t -- we ate different, 1t was not like the iceberg\nlettuce, we were used to different salad. And they served us salads and they kept asking us if we\nsaw -- and of course I didn\u2019t speak a word of English. I had -- when we moved in with my\nmother\u2019s sister, who had a one bedroom apartment, it was very difficult to get apartment --",
        "A: This is the 19 -- September 1949. At -- she lived in the Midwood section of Brooklyn where I\nthought, oh the Jews are so rich, because they had their own home and a piano in the house and\noh my God, I -- but I did not open up my mouth for three months because I didn\u2019t speak English.\nAnd I\u2019m very frustrated I remember because they gave me a -- an I.Q. test and I could hardly\nspeak the language. So when I got to high school and the principal called me in, and he said, I\u2019ve\nnever seen anybody improve so much on the I.Q. test, I said look, you gave it to a greenhorn who\ndidn\u2019t know a tailor from a dressmaker. I said, it\u2019s lucky I didn\u2019t test as an imbecile, I passed it.\nYes, I didn\u2019t pass it with high marks, but I said, no wonder it\u2019s gone up so much, I said, now I\nknow the language. And they frustrated me even further, they gave me French, they put me in a\nspecial class. I said oh my God, you know, that was really unreal. I look at it today they have the\nbilingual education, and I say what -- what\u2019s going on, you know? They bend over backwards,\nthen it was sink or swim, when I --",
        "A: Lived with my aunt for three months until we got our own apartment and we moved to a\nneighborhood that was not quite as affluent. There was -- we lived in Midwood section with -- in\nFlatbush near Brooklyn College with my aunt, and then we moved to Bensonhurst, where it was\na mixed neighborhood, Italian and Jewish. And more people -- some people spoke Yiddish as\nwell, it -- it -- I felt more comfortable, I -- perhaps also because my English was quite -- you\nknow, much better.",
        "A: And thanks to the land of opportunity really because we were poor and my -- my stepfather\ndidn\u2019t really have a trade here. [coughs] Excuse me. He had been a businessman in -- 1n\nGermany, and there was no business for him to take over so they taught him how to house paint.\nMy mother\u2019s uncles were in the real estate, so he became a housepainter. And my mother wanted\nto work so that I wouldn\u2019t have to go to clinics and he didn\u2019t like that too much. So she quit and\nso I remember working my way through school really. While I went -- was in high school I\nalways had jobs from the time I was 15. I worked in bakeries, I worked 1n -- in different stores, I\nworked as a counselor. And I came to -- when I was -- graduated from high school and wanted to\ngo on to college I definitely had the grade, and my stepfather didn't want me to go to college. He\nbelieved girls should marry rich [indecipherable] it was not easy, I -- we had lived in a one\nbedroom apartment, my room was the living room, the sleep sofa and my pinups were on the\ncloset, but I did not leave home ye -- at that time you respected your parents and my mother went\nthrough a lot with me and I -- it was a di -- a difficult time, but I -- I told my mother I can\u2019t -- I\njust for [indecipherable] like, I didn\u2019t go to school right away, but I said I have to go to school,\ncause people even offered to give me money to send me away, but I said, I can\u2019t do that to my\nmother. Brooklyn College accepted -- you know, if you had A average, the girls had to have 90 -\n95, the boys only 80 something. So -- it was free, other than just the books. I said, Pll go to scho\n-- Pll support myself. During the day I went -- I worked in a real estate office and at night I -- I\nwent to school at night until I had to go student teach. You know, you have to do that for a year,\nso I transferred and I started going in during the day.

I said, we\u2019re in America, we have to\ntalk English. But as I got older, I -- I wanted to cling to the Yiddish. That was my, you know,\nMamalashen. And no, strangely enough, they didn\u2019t talk of it, but the -- my relatives wanted to\nknow what we went -- what we lived through, but nobody from school, we didn\u2019t have --",

And having not been born in the United States, I was so -- and you know, people in\nBrooklyn have very distinct accents, that I made sure in college I took speech classes and I said,\nI\u2019m going to pass this exam, because some of my friends who were native Americans, they were\nborn in the States didn\u2019t pass it and I really was scared. I said, uh-oh, I\u2019m going to go before this\nwhole board, there are principals and teachers and they gave me things to read and things to\npronounce, and I s -- I was so nervous. Oh, never -- and when I passed I was ecstatic. I just\ndidn\u2019t -- I was so careful to enunciate and pronounce everything correctly.

You can\u2019t just\nbring your life into their -- but at one point if they would complain they had so much pressure, I\nwould -- then I would see that my background was with me, I -- what do you know from\npressure? You\u2019ve had loving parents and thank God you have your grandma, and --",
        "A: Yeah, I look at my granddaughter now, I say oh my God, was I that age?",
        "A: Oh, I think what --",
        "A: No, well -- well, I -- I look at my granddaughter who is five and a half [indecipherable] you\nknow and I say thank God. Thank God there 1s not, an-and I hope that they\u2019Il never be war, I\ndon\u2019t want them to go through anything like that again. I don\u2019t want them to go through loss like\nthat again. And -- and war 1s a horrible thing for children. I mean, it -- just terrible, I mean breaks\nmy heart there is still a lot of suffering and a lot of poverty in the world now.",
        "A: Hard to say. I don\u2019t know. Would have been happier having had the love of my father and the\nguidance of a father. I wouldn\u2019t have felt that -- that void. That was hard, especially when I was\na teenager or later when I had to introduce my dates to my stepfather, who didn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t a\ntalker and who -- who was really [indecipherable] in my life. That was hard. And hard not\nhaving Seders and you know, I -- I\u2019m surprised I picked up as much, cause I guess it was inborn\nbecause my -- my father trained me to be -- have such feelings, but I\u2019m very involved with shul\nand it gives me comfort. But yes, I ask questions. Why and why did my husband have to die\nyoung and -- and why, but I don\u2019t feel sorry for myself, it just -- I feel sorry for those who didn\u2019t\nmake it. Why didn\u2019t my aunt, who was only seven years older than I, she never made anything,\nyou know. So I thank God for what I have, I\u2019m grateful. Yes, I\u2019m angry at the people who did\nthese horrible things. Th-The farmers, how -- how they could turn like that on my grandparents,\nwho were such pious people and you say why? You know, you\u2019re supposed to be rewarded with\nsedakah and you know [indecipherable] Hasidim and --",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: There\u2019s a special bond, but it\u2019s interesting that you ask that. \u2019m very comfortable. However,\nwhen my husband and I joined the child survivor group and we went to a couple of meetings,\nboth of us felt that some of the people were very bitter and they had a lot of psychological\nproblems and they wore it on their sleeve, whereas my husband and I had gone through a lot, we\njust put it in the past. We were grateful for what we have here and try not to be bitter. I mean,\nwhat\u2019s the point? How you -- you survived, you\u2019re alive, you picked up the pieces. You have a\nbeautiful family, you just speak up for the -- the ones that are less fortunate and you have to\nspeak out when you see injustices done to -- you know, things that are done to other people, so\nthat it doesn\u2019t happen again. Yes, my heart bleeds for Israel, I always worry. I know I\u2019m an\nAmerican, I\u2019m a Jew, but somehow there 1 -- I have this special feeling for Israel that if God\nforbid anything would happen to Israel, you know, it -- what are we again? You know we\u2019re --\nwe're a people without a land. Yes, I -- I\u2019m a citizen of the United States, I have all my full\nrights here, but somehow I feel like I belong there becau -- and -- and I think that\u2019s as a result of\nhaving survived the war, not having a place to go, that\u2019s all. [sings] Tell me where shall I go. I\nmean, that has so much meaning to me, cause every door was closed to us. And look at how\nmany children, the innocent children, that\u2019s what really gets to me. But I\u2019m thankful for what I\nhave. You know, some people look at their glass half full and some people look at it half empty\nand I thank God for [indecipherable] yes, it could have been different, but you know, life went\non, I have a beautiful family. Hitler didn\u2019t succeed. And people tell me, we thank God you\u2019re\nhere, what do you mean you -- you say why me\u2019? It -- every shul needs a reader who\n[indecipherable] this one lady who is very sweet. I said thank you very much, but -- so -- and --\nand I hope it -- it will never happen again and -- and any of my grandchildren [indecipherable] I\nwouldn\u2019t want them to go through that. And I think because I lacked grandparents, I bend over\nbackwards to be a good grandparent. I try very hard and bond with the kids, and help out, as you\ndo with your -- your gra -- it\u2019s a pleasure. It\u2019s just a pleasure. And I don\u2019t understand how people\ncould do that to kids.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Got my teaching certificate and I was thrilled to get a job at Olney Elementary School where -\n- this was 1960. I thought I earned a lot of money, it was 7,000 a year and I was supposed to\nsupport my husband through graduate school. However in 1961 our very first child Nina was\nborn and then in \u201963 her sister Sherri and 60 si -- six, Rene. And of course we were not lacking\nfor names, unfortunately, we had lots of names to give them. Wonderful girls, we loved being\nparents and very proud of them. One is a psycholog -- she\u2019s industrial psychologist, one earned a\ndegree in law, she\u2019s an attorney and -- and the third one 1s a -- a nurse at Hopkins, and my\nhusband was privileged to walk two of them down the aisle with me and he was -- he did see\nfour grandchildren, but unfortunately the oldest, when he died in \u201995 was only six and the\nyoungest at the time was only two. So he -- he saw four grandchildren and four have been born\nsince, and he would have been so proud of all of them. Just -- I regret the fact that he never was\nthere for a Bar Mitzvah, but I -- I feel that he was there in spirit, because I can see some of the\ncharacteristics that he had in each and every one of my grandchildren. And we talk about him a\nlot and his -- his memory will be for a blessing and I know he\u2019ll always be remembered. And one\nof his grandchildren has a love of soccer just like he did, and she\u2019s a good soccer player. So my\ngrandchildren range in age from 20 down to two. And --",
        "A: -- I thank God for them. I -- names are Sammy, which would have been my -- my uncle who\nwas killed in the Holocaust. Then I have a Max, Maxwell David Heller and he\u2019s named after my\nfather, David. And -- and then we have Alexis. She has other grandparents who are survivors\ntoo, so she was named after that side. And then we have Mitchell, Mitchell Heller and he was\nnamed after my late husband\u2019s brother, Baruch -- Benny. And then came Tobi, Tavulah, who is\nmy mother, named after my mother and she was born si -- six weeks after my husband died. It\nwas too hard to give her hi-his name. And after Tobi came Jacklyn and she has my husband\u2019s\nname Natanya, which is a gift from God. And then my daughter Rene has the two younger ones,\nshe has Chelsea and Blake, who are -- unfortunately don\u2019t have Hebrew names because she\nmarried a non-Jew. And -- but I love them all and that\u2019s my mishpokhe. I am proud of all of\nthem.",
        "A: In time from when I was a little girl?",
        "A: I know Seders and Sukkoth, I always had tears in my eyes when I saw people celebrating\nPesach because I -- I didn\u2019t have that, I\u2019d -- I\u2019d recall [indecipherable] I was very little and I\nrecall the Sukkoth, but yeah, that\u2019s why I -- I really celebrate them fully and always invite people\nto Seder. Smells, I -- I\u2019ve -- I know from what my mother told me about her mother having been\nsuch a wonderful balabusta, she made everything from scratch, so whether it\u2019s -- I was told the\ndifference, she was an excellent cook and an excellent baker and -- and did everything, but I\nreally don\u2019t --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It was a great feeling. I\u2019d have to do it on my own and of course when I went to court I had\nalready been through school so I did -- 1t was a joke the questions that they would ask, I knew I\nwould pass. It felt very good. Felt I belonged and it was great. Didn\u2019t feel anti -- any anti-\nSemitism, so --",
        "A: Personally no, but my grandchildren here and there have, and they\u2019ve heard it, and so that\nwas very hurtful to me and they were very angry. And this -- a hockey field, ice hockey?\nParticular instance where -- yeah.",
        "A: They were called a name, and --",
        "A: By other children. And I said, how could this be in the United States, my grandchild, you\nknow. But I know it\u2019s there and I know it\u2019s hidden. You feel it. I did -- oh, I shouldn\u2019t say, I did\nexperience it. My uncle had a house in the country and suddenly I saw a sign, no dogs or Jews\nallowed. And this was the country club, yes. So I knew that there were places that were\nforbidden and I knew that Jewish students had a tough time here, I mean I -- I learned history.\nWhen they went to medical school and other places, it was -- 1t was harder for them. But we\nwere always known as the people of the book, and we -- so we excelled, we knew we had to\nexcel.",
        "A: Definitely. Definitely. Il always be a survivor. I felt like a greenhorn for a long time, I -- I\ndidn\u2019t after -- you know.",
        "A: Does it define me?",
        "A: I think I am -- in a way I was glad that I married a survivor because we understood each other\nfully. You know, the sadness and there was a lot of un -- [coughs] Excuse me. There was a lot of\nunspoken, but we had so much more in common. And there\u2019s a special bond that we all --\nsurvivors have. So I think yes. My children also know that they\u2019re the product of survivors. They\nthink they were brought up differently because -- well, I don\u2019t think so because I co -- I consider\nmyself American, I -- I went through schools here, public schools, but I definitely feel like \u2019'ma\nsurvivor. I survived the war, I feel I can survive anything. I\u2019m also a cancer survivor, so --",
        "A: All right. At the time when I was teaching my career ended early because I became pregnant\nand they didn\u2019t want pregnant women in the school system. So I decided to rear them when they\nwere very young, myself and stay home and do with a little bit less materially. And then when I\nwas member of Hadassah and somebody was teaching at the Chaim Weizmann Yiddish Hebrew\nSchool and they needed a music teacher and Yiddish teacher and so I said oh, it sounds\nwonderful and I went for an interview and got the job. So I taught Yiddish music, brought me\nback to my music and my days in DP camp, and Hebrew and [indecipherable]. And then after\nmy teaching there about four or five years, the principal, Frieda Frank had retired and she asked\nme to take over for her. I became principal and I enjoyed that very much. And as a -- a Hebrew\nschool teacher I also went to different training session and I was trained to become a Bar and Bat\nMitzvah tutor. I learned the trope for Torah and Haftorah. And I had private students. I did it for\na number of my friends, they were my guinea pigs in the beginning. Friends\u2019 children that 1s,\nwho are now all grown and have children beyond the Bar Mitzvah years. So I enjoyed that very\nmuch. I\u2019ve also taught adult -- adults -- ve had four adult B\u2019nai Mitzvah that I -- I trained and\nthat was rewarding. And right now they all -- all the training I do is for my grandchildren. I\u2019ve\nhad the pleasure of -- of teaching three of -- four of actually -- five of my grandchildren,\nprepared them for Bar and Bat Mitzvah and I\u2019m looking forward to the others in the future, yeah.",
        "A: And I -- I think it\u2019s wonderful that I belong to an egalitarian shul where we were given\ncomplete rights and I can read Torah and Haftorah, I do that in memory of -- of my parents and I\nchant the Haftorah and privileged to ha -- ha -- I\u2019m happy to have the privilege to give -- to be\ngiven the opportunity where I could read Torah, because I remember we were not always\negalitarian and when my mother died and I went to shul every day to say Kaddish, they didn\u2019t\nrecognize me as part of the minyan and I fought it -- and we fought it and under our new rabbi,\nRabbi Jonah Layman, he gave us full rights and I was very happy. W-We actually got those --\nwe were counted in the minyan before Jonah joined us and I was happy because unfortunately\nwhen my husband died and he didn\u2019t leave any male heirs and my daughters went to say\nKaddish, they did not look for a 10\" man, they were counted in the minyan. So I am very proud -\n- | don\u2019t know what my grandparents are thinking about it, but I -- I\u2019m very happy that we have\nequal rights, cause they were all Orthodox.",
        "A: Well, my own mother really was not as pious here as she had been. She -- sh-she -- she was\nnot Orthodox any more, she traveled on Shabbat and a -- yes, she kept kosher, definitely and --\nas I do. But she was angry with God, yes, so to speak and yes I have survivor friends and we do\nhave a special bond, have older friends and younger friends and they\u2019re -- they\u2019re like family.",
        "A: Oh, I was watching that and I -- I was overwhelmed by what people went through and\nsometimes I f -- I felt guilty that I didn\u2019t go through as much as some people and what -- what 1s\nstrange, the competition sometimes bothers me among survivors. When you tell them where\nyou\u2019re from, or what you\u2019ve gone through, they say oh, that\u2019s nothing. You were not in\nAuschwitz or Dachau, you don\u2019t have a number. But how are they to say what I\u2019ve experienced\nand what losses -- I\u2019ve had losses. I was robbed of a childhood. And in a way that\u2019s what kept\nme away from some of the groups, because I was never honored -- not in my shul, my shul I\u2019ve\nbeen honored many times, but never honored to light a candle, and Transnistria existed, it was a\nlabor camp. So in a sense I felt a little hurt. I didn\u2019t make waves, but -- and a -- I\u2019ve heard other\npeople experience the same thing. People, for instance who were in Russia. My friend Ada, she\nalso experienced that, they say, what did you go through? And you were a kid, you can\u2019t\nremember much. But we did. We\u2019re robbed of our childhood and -- and we certainly went\nthrough a holocaust, our own personal holocaust.",
        "A: No, definitely not Romanian. I have no desire to go back. Well, sometimes --",
        "A: Yeah, sometimes I\u2019ve wanted see where [indecipherable] say oh, it wasn\u2019t so great. I would --\nI\u2019m proud to say I\u2019m an American, yes, very proud and a -- I\u2019m a Jew first. I will always feel\nvery, very Jewish, because no matter what, the Jews who\u2019ve tried to hide that they were Jewish,\nyou couldn\u2019t hide it. Even those who had, they say [indecipherable] whatever, even if you had a\nlittle blood, the great-great grandparents, those Germans found you and they labeled you, you\nwere a Jew. But no, I don\u2019t mean it in that sense, I am proud of who I am. I\u2019m proud of my\npeople, things that we\u2019ve gone through and we persevere. And that\u2019s why we exist. And we --\nwe cling to our belief that the -- the Torah, if we only would all practice what the Torah preaches\nit would be a wonderful world. And the same thing for the Christians.",
        "A: What are the reasons?",
        "A: To keep the memory alive and to say to deniers, you can\u2019t deny it, it happened. Let\u2019s hope it\nnever happens again.",
        "A: Yes. First of all, I mean, to my children and grandchildren, I love them very much, I\u2019m very\nproud of them, but I want them to remember to always be proud ... of their heritage, proud of\nbeing Jewish and always fight for the underdog, do not stay -- stand back and say oh, they don\u2019t\nmean me. Even if it\u2019s somebody out of the religion, out of your faith, always speak up for the\ntruth and for justice. And -- and do the right thing, as Grandpa said, always do the right thing.\nAnd know I\u2019II be with you, watching over you no matter where I am and I\u2019Il always love you.",
        "A: Yes, and I will never forget the very first time I was seated in the rotunda. It was an\noverwhelming experience, very emotional. I have taken, when we were allowed to, I have taken\ntwo of my grandchildren there and two of my daughters there. I -- I said -- it was such a -- an\noverwhelming emotional experience, I wanted them to experience it. Of course they experienced\nit differently than I did. But the first time I sat in the rotunda and suddenly I saw all the military\nwalking in with the flags that liberated the camps, I -- I just started crying like a baby. It was a\nfeeling of joy and a feeling of sadness and a feeling of saying well here I am, the greenhorn,\nsitting in the United States, a citizen, a -- in the rotunda and being with other survivors and\nseeing the flags and it brought back memories of the war and saying why me, why was I\nprivileged? And especially this year it was very emotional because I sat very close to the stage\nand there was Elie Wiesel sitting next to our President Obama. And President Obama addressing\nus. I-I will never forget that, I was really choked up, it was quite an experience. And it -- it made\nme proud to be an American and seeing that they recognize the Holocaust. I mean, it\u2019s sad that\nwe had it but at least it\u2019s there and -- and they recognize it by honoring the memory of the dead\nby having the Holocaust Museum, which is a-an educational tool and -- and I see so many people\nfrom different walks of life on line and that makes me feel good. Because hopefully through\neducation, something like this will not happen again. And so I have volunteered and I will start\nworking at the Holocaust Museum myself. It\u2019s difficult, yes. Having been through the museum,\nit\u2019s -- it\u2019s ha -- very hard to take when you see very graphic pictures and when you walk into a\nroom with pictures of smiling faces and families that were, that are no longer here because the\nentire town was gone, maybe a fe -- a handful of people survived, that\u2019s very hard, but it\u2019s an\nimportant lesson. And I think people should go and -- and be educated and I\u2019m glad that they are\noffering it now as part of the curriculum in the schools. So I think it\u2019s my duty, it\u2019s time for me\nto -- to do some volunteering there as well.",
        "A: Yeah, my mother -- my grandparents, my mother\u2019s side, my -- my grandfather Zev\nMirabaum, Worf Mirabaum and his wife, Zora Brina Mirabaum. Her brother Shmul, or Sammy,\nas they called him. A-Anita, Menusha and Esther, who would have been only seven years older\nthan I, she was born in 1929. May their memory be for a blessing and my [indecipherable] my\ngrandma -- my father -- my father\u2019s mother who -- who died in labor camp in Transnistria, were\nwonderful -- they were wonderful people.",
        "A: We\u2019re called Die Freyliche Knaidlach which -- the Happy Dumplings. And we sing mostly\nYiddish songs and some Ladino and Hebrew songs. And we bring joy to people. We\u2019ve sung in\nvarious -- he -- in Hebrew homes and nursing homes. We\u2019ve sung at the Israeli embassy, at\nCatholic University, Montgomery College, University of Maryland. And music is wonderful\nmedicine for some people. It 1 -- it evokes such emotion. People with Alzheimer\u2019s who have not\nspoken for quite some time suddenly start crying and singing along with us. We derive a lot of\npleasure and at the same time we feel we\u2019re doing a mitzvah and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s wonderful for us as\nwell. It\u2019s a healing. Music really heals. We love bringing some joy, some freyliche to people and\nit was s -- it really saved me after my husband died. I immersed myself in it and I\u2019m teaching\nYiddish to my fellow knaidlach and they enjoy it immensely too and it brings joy to people. So\nI\u2019m -- I\u2019m happy to be part of the group.",
        "A: Yes, and just like knaidlach, we find ourselves offering hot soup, sometimes in cold soup or\njust like good knaidlach we always rise to the top. And that\u2019s it. I am also involved in other two\nmusical groups, the [indecipherable] choir and the Gaithersburg chorus. And we do quite a few\nYiddish songs there as well.\n"
