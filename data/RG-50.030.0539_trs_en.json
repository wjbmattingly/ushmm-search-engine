        "Question: Good morning.",
        "Answer: Good morning to you.",
        "Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Professor\nSaul Merin, on April 19, 2009. We are very, very pleased that you have agreed to\ncome and speak with us today. The interview is about your life story, and we\u2019ll\nstart, as we always do, at the beginning. Can you tell us some details about your\nbirth, about your family, about the world that you were born into?",
        "A: And, thank you very much. I-I was born in a township, what they called shtetl,\nthe small towns where most Jewish people lived in Eastern Europe. This township\nwas called Bendzin. It had a \u2014 between 50 and 60,000 people \u2014 population. And it\nwas similar to so many other places like this. It was in southwest Poland, very close\nto the German border, of more than maybe five miles.",
        "Q: Was it a contested territory with Germany?",
        "A: Yes, it was, always they were fighting about it. It was in Silesia, Silesia.\nSchilesia in \u2014 in German. And the Germans thought that this is their country. The\nPoles thought that this is their country. Before the war, all of Lower Silesia was\nnext to Germany, and Upper Silesia, most of it belonged to Germany. A small part\nrem-remained Polish.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "Q: In Bendzin, was it a multi-cultural town? Were there Germans living there, and\nPoles living there and Jews living there?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, but really, the majority were Jewish people, in the town itself.",
        "Q: How large was \u2014",
        "A: About 60 percent. About 60 percent of the people living in Bendzin were \u2014 were\nJewish people. And they \u2014 their language mostly was Jewish.",
        "Q: Yiddish.",
        "A: Yiddish.",
        "Q: Yiddish.",
        "A: Was Yiddish. While a \u2014 in addition, they learned Polish, and knew Polish, but\nYiddish was the major language. And there were people who lived there and spoke\nGerman.",
        "Q: What about you?",
        "A: We spoke Yiddish. And \u2014 at home, it was Yiddish. I knew, of course, very well,\nPolish. And I knew a little of German, not much. But I learned German during the\nwar, and after the war, as a child.",
        "Q: And how is it \u2014 how was the town\u2019s structure 1n social classes, for example?\nWere \u2014 were Jews in a certain merchant class, or a certain class and Poles in another\nand Germans in another? How was that split up?\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: The whole town was poor. Poverty was probably the characteristic finding in\ntown. Poverty among all classes. It was among Germans and among \u2014 among Poles,\nand among the Jewish people. The \u2014 the poverty was manifested by \u2014 by the houses,\nwhich were terrible dwellings. Many of them, there were no washrooms 1n the\nhouse, they have to go out to the courtyard. Sometimes this was seen even in \u2014 in\nhouses which had four floors, and 20 - 30 families lived there. They had to go down\nand \u2014 life was not easy, not nice. Jewish people lived there probably for longer than\nmany other places, because in Bendzin there was a castle, which was built by King\nCasimir. Casimir, or Kazimierz in Polish. Kazimierz the Great. He was the Polish\nking in the 14\" century who united Poland. This is why they called him the Great.\nAfter he united it, usually by fighting, okay, in combat \u2014",
        "Q: Was that the Treaty of Lublin? Was he part \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No, okay.",
        "A: No. This was \u2014 a-and he \u2014 he really thought \u2014 he ruled over Poland. This was\nunusual in Poland, because Poland was \u2014 the noblemen rule \u2014 ruled the country,\nnot the king. But he was strong; he was the one who ruled at that time, in the 14\ncentury, must have been about 1345. He invited the Jews of Germany to come over\nand live in Poland. And he promised that he will take care of it \u2014 of them, he will\nApril 19, 2009\nsupport them, and th \u2014 especially, he will be the one who will defend them, if there\nwill be problems about \u2014 in \u2014 in Poland. The Jews heard it and they just couldn\u2019t\ncome at a better time for the Poles, and for the Jews, cause this was the time after\nthe plague, after the plague, disease, the plague epidemic, the Black Plague. While\nthe Germans, which \u2014 which maybe \u2014 nobody knows how much, but it probably\nwas not less than a quarter of the \u2014 of European population who perished at that\ntime from the disease, from the epidemic, and they possibly wa \u2014 it came up from\n50 percent a \u2014 of the jew \u2014 of the European population. The plague was brought by\nan Italian ship from the east, from somewhere in the east. The story goes, in 1943,\nthe \u2014 the ship came and they tried to disembark in Messina, in south\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Not 1943, some pa \u2014 some other point, yes?",
        "A: In 1343.",
        "Q: *43.",
        "A: 1343. And in Messina, the customs officer came on the ship and looked what\nkind of, how do you call it \u2014",
        "Q: Goods they had?",
        "A: Goods, what kind of goods they brought with them. And then he has seen th-the\nsick sailors. He has seen this, he left the ship. He told them, you are not allowed to\nApril 19, 2009\ngo to Messina, you must leave immediately the port. And they left and they went\naround into Venice. In Venice they disembarked.",
        "Q: That was it.",
        "A: Brought down the goods. And unfortunately, one of the problems was, later for\nthe Jews, that one of the businessmen in Switzerland had a Jew for his assistant.\nAnd \u2014 sorry.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: And he was sent to Venice to bring the goods. And he came over there and took\nthe goods and came back to Switzerland. The goods were infected, like all of the\ngoods which were [indecipherable]",
        "Q: This is \u2014 excuse me for interrupting, but it\u2019s interesting to hear history \u2014 first of\nall, Pll back up a little bit. I have a theory, it\u2019s a not very deep theory, it\u2019s a little\nsuperficial, but I have a theory that east Europeans carry around their history for\n600 years.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Whereas Americans don\u2019t remember what Vietnam War was: that\u2019s already\nancient history.",
        "A: How right you are.",
        "Q: And listening to you now, I hear an east European, because \u2014 because \u2014\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: This was just 600 years \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 from that time.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and I\u2019m wondering whether \u2014 whether these were stories and this was\nhistory that you grew up with in a \u2014 in order to explain how the Jews came to\nBendzin, or is this \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 information that you learned later, history that you learned later?",
        "A: No, it was \u2014 no, I th \u2014 I think I knew about it already as a child. I knew about it,\nbecause it\u2019s very important for the life of Jewish people in Bendzin. You see, when\nthe plague broke out, the Germans accused the Jews, that they brought in the\nplague, that they caused the plague, they caused the death of at least one-quarter of\nthe European population, and thousands of Jews were massacred as a \u2014",
        "Q: Result.",
        "A: \u2014 result of this. And when he invited the Jews to come, tens of thousands left\nGermany into Poland. Poland, til then, had one small community in Kalish(ph), a\ntown more to the north [indecipherable]. And after this there were many\ncommunities which were put up.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "Q: So you could sa \u2014 so one could say that Bendzin was one of the oldest Jewish\ncommunities in Poland.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s what I think, yes. This wa \u2014 this was what we knew about it. This was\none of the oldest \u2014 because Jews settled near the king they loved. And \u2014",
        "Q: This is the other point I wanted to bring up, th \u2014 and again, excuse me for\ninterrupting, but it sounds from what you\u2019re saying, is that there are traces of a\nPolish patriot in you, in your telling, because of \u2014 now, I could be wrong, I\u2019m \u2014 this\nis why I\u2019m testing this out, because it sounds like the story was a favorable story to\nPoland, that it was a refuge, that it was a country where one could live. It was a\ncountry that offered survival and reprieve. And the reason I \u2014 I \u2014 I bring this up 1s\nthat just recently there was a Professor Polonsky who was the chair of Judaic\nstudies at Brandeis, gave a presentation where he said, until World War 2, many\nJews believed that about Poland.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Many Jews believed that about where they lived. And so that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking\nyou, is that \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 is there something to this?\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: Yes, I agree fully with this. Many Jews believe that they are \u2014 they are Jewish,\nbut they \u2014 that the Poles can be depended upon, and we should live with the Poles.\nTh-This happened at the time of Tadeusz Kosciuszko, when Berek\nYoselevich(ph), a Jew from Warsaw, from the other side of Warsaw, Fraha \u2014\nFraga(ph). He put up a battalion that fought in the mutiny of Kosciuszko, as a\nseparate battalion under \u2014 under the order of \u2014 of yos \u2014 of Berek Yoselevich(ph),\nBerek Yoselovich. And Poles that remember this, will find his name anywhere oret\n\u2014 of how he fought. He fell in \u2014 in combat. He died in combat. But he dus \u2014anyhow,\nin \u2014 in Bendzin, most Jews went to Krakow. Krakow was the place where the king\nlived, and they put up a town near Krakow and called it Kazimierz, which is this\nstill today, after the king. But in this place, the castle which he built, on the shores\nof a river, he \u2014 this town was built, Bendzin, and Jews lived there, I think for\ncenturies. I lived in the place where I was born, and I lived on the street corner\ncalled the Street of the Castle. And I could throw a stone and hit the castle, it was\nin the same \u2014",
        "Q: That was that close?",
        "A: It was very close, yes. It was on the same street.",
        "Q: Did you live di\u2014 were you born into one of those houses that had four stories\nhigh, and a courtyard below?\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, exactly, exactly like this. For there were three, like buildings\naround a courtyard, and I lived on the third floor in one of them, on the \u2014 the site\nwhere there was no building like this, there was a small building of three stores\nonly, or what do \u2014 what \u2014 shops 1n the lower floor, and then two floors of\napartments, which belonged to my grandfather.",
        "Q: So, it was extended family who lived together?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s turn a little bit to your own family, within this context, within this\ncommunity and within this history. When were you born? What was the date of\nyour birth?",
        "A: 1933. August, 1930 \u2014 end of August, 1933.",
        "Q: August?",
        "A: 1933.",
        "Q: But the date in August was \u2014 I \u2014 August \u2014",
        "A: 25.",
        "Q: August 25\", 1933. Were you the only child?",
        "A: No, my sister was born two years later.",
        "Q: But there were the two of you then?",
        "A: Yes.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "Q: Okay. And what was her name?",
        "A: Dina.",
        "Q: Nina?",
        "A: Dina.",
        "Q: Dina. And your parents\u2019 names?",
        "A: My father was Itzhak, Itzhak, and he belonged to the family Merin, that lived\nin this place, at least documented, I know, 200 years.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a long time.",
        "A: Yeah, 200 \u2014 1820, I could see the name of Merin written down in the Jewish\ncommunity, where they had the list of all newborns, you know, and saw his name,\nthe name Merin came back \u2014 back several times.",
        "Q: And your mother\u2019s name?",
        "A: My mo \u2014 my mother was Gruen, g-r-u-e-n, that\u2019s the way \u2014",
        "Q: Gruen?",
        "A: Gruen.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That\u2019s the way they have written it. It\u2019s probably more German, like this, the u-\ne.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: And they \u2014",
        "Q: Her first name?",
        "A: \u2014 she was born in \u2014 Gitl(ph).",
        "Q: Gitl(ph).",
        "A: Okay. She was born in a village nearby, a village about 20 miles from there.",
        "Q: In this \u2014 in Bendzin, if there was such poverty, what did people do to make their\n\u2014 earn their living? How did they earn their living?",
        "A: I think it was lot different from other places in Poland. They lived there as\nowners of small shops. This was \u2014 my father had a small shop given to him by his\nfather, by my grandfather. And he became very religious, and \u2014 and my mother was\nreally running it. And I \u2014",
        "Q: What did you sell? What \u2014",
        "A: They were selling all kinds of \u2014 they called it galanteria in Polish.",
        "Q: How \u2014 and \u2014",
        "A: You know, okay \u2014",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: So this was a galanteria. Was a big sign galanteria, I remember this as a child.",
        "Q: All kinds of haberdashery, I think would be the English phrase. Socks and gloves\nand umbrellas and things like that.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Yeah, hats.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. So this was one owners, shop owners. Then there were various\nprofessions, like tailors and [indecipherable] and \u2014",
        "Q: Do you think that that would have been your future, had there been no war, that\nyou would have taken over the shop?",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s a difficult question. I was too young to \u2014 to even \u2014 to think about it. I\nbelieve my father would like me to go to the yeshiva and become a rabbi, or like\nthis, but it will \u2014 there was no chance for it, I would never agree to it. Already as a\nchild five year old, I knew that that will not be my way.",
        "Q: That\u2019s interesting that at age five \u2014",
        "A: Yes. At the age of three, I was sent to a chayder, so I learned with all these ren \u2014\nreligious way, I learned from the age of three. I hated. This I remember well. I did\nnot like it.",
        "Q: Why? What \u2014 what is in your memory\u201d?",
        "A: I didn't like the attitude of the rabbi. The rabbi was the teacher over there\n[indecipherable] on many occasion he would hit you with a \u2014",
        "Q: Ruler?\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: \u2014atuler, you know, which he had there, in his hand. A \u2014 and I hated it. And I\ndid not like the way they were learning it, you know, to repeat after the rabbi what\nhe said, and this was the way of learning. I didn\u2019t like it. This I know very well.\nAnd on any occasion I had, I wou \u2014 I run away from them.",
        "Q: Well, three years old is a very young \u2014 for a small child to be so \u2014",
        "A: Yes, I probably started to run away at the age of four or so, after one year there.\nNot at the beginning, but already at the age of four I was definitely running away.\nMy -",
        "Q: Did you get in trouble from this?",
        "A: Well, I tried to \u2014 not to let my parents know about it. But my mother would\ncertainly support me if I would \u2014 if she would know, she would say, well, let him do\nwhat he likes. And my father wouldn\u2019t forgive me, no way. And so \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s kind of tough on a little child.",
        "A: Yes. But, it was \u2014 my friend was the \u2014 there was a man who lived in the same\nhouse, he had a cart and a horse to carry things. And he became \u2014 we became very\ngood friends, and he tried to take me always when he was going to work, and I was\nwith him on the cart there, going like this. The other people \u2014 so there there were all\nthese professions, there were \u2014 was a bakery, and people worked in the bakery.\nThere was a mikveh, and a synagogue, a shul, where they \u2014 and so many people are\nApril 19, 2009\n\u2014 were all in this. The most \u2014 the most common, I would say, and the most Jewish\nprofession \u2014 you probably don\u2019t know it, but the most Jewish profession at that\ntime, my opinion, was porters.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. These people were taking things on their shoulders and carry them from \u2014\nthey were Jewish, almost exclusively Jewish.",
        "Q: Like loaders, people who would take heavy sacks on their shoulders and \u2014",
        "A: Yes, heavy loads and these were Jewish. Almost exclusively. We knew it \u2014",
        "Q: How do you explain it?",
        "A: Well, th-the problem was that the Poles didn\u2019t like Jews, and you know, if we\nliked King Kazimierz, there were not many like him. And he \u2014 he \u2014 he was\nexceptional. And the Poles tried to make, for Jews, life difficult. And one of things\nthey did was not to \u2014 too much to work with them. Now, if you were a doctor, if\nyou were a\u2014 a tailor, and you were good at it, and really they came to you, most\nJews and Poles, and \u2014 and they worked with you, because it was good for them to\ndo it. But if you didn\u2019t have any education, if you didn\u2019t have any professional\neducation, you were not a tailor, you were not a [indecipherable] you didn\u2019t learn\nanything, then the only thing that was left for you was to work as a porter.",
        "Q: Carrying these loads.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: And I \u2014I think this was the reason why they work. I knew \u2014 I knew children of\nthe porters who were my age. I remember them. They had the very difficult time.\nTheir income was low. They hardly could have shoes to walk around with them.\nAnd I\u2014 I\u2019m not sure how mu \u2014 what they were doing about it, you know, and\ncertainly their parents, uneducated. They couldn\u2019t do anything else, except this.",
        "Q: Was there mandatory schooling for children, all children?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. Schooling is another interesting fact about the place, because there was one\nsecondary school, one high school, and the one high school was \u2014 my father learned\nin it. Was called Yavener(ph) at the time, and the language of teaching was\nHebrew. This was the only secondary school, high school in town. So the Poles \u2014",
        "Q: So the Poles didn\u2019t have their own?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: There was no education \u2014",
        "A: l\u2014I\u2019m not sure they have now, but they didn\u2019t have at that time. This was the\nonly one. And so when a Pole wanted to learn in high school, would get\nmatriculation, for instance, the only way for him was to learn in Hebrew. Go to that\nschool \u2014\nApril 19, 2009",
        "Q: And did they?",
        "A: Yes, many did. Many did. It was [indecipherable] a \u2014 a \u2014 a chain of schools,\nJewish schools, all over Poland.",
        "Q: But private, hm, not state.",
        "A: Private \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 private. But then, you know, life became very difficult, worse and worse from\nyear to year.",
        "Q: Well, I would like to see \u2014 I would like to kind of weave in the general picture\nyou\u2019re painting for me with words, to what happened in your own family. And\nbefore we do that, I\u2019d like to get a sense of what your family was like, what\nmemories do you have of your family, of your sister, of your mother. You know,\nsome people report that their pre-war lives were pretty idyllic, and that they grew up\nin warm, happy families. Some report that it wasn\u2019t quite so, and their relations\nwere more, how shall I say? Complicated. How would you describe your own?",
        "A: Whe-en-en \u2014 if we speak before the war \u2014",
        "Q: Before the war.",
        "A: \u2014 before the world changed \u2014",
        "Q: Before the war.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: \u2014 before the war I was \u2014 I was five years old when the war broke out, I wasn\u2019t\nyet Six.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: [indecipherable] so during that time, I could only see what\u2019s going around\nthere.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And already I knew at that time that what happens in town, and all over in\nPoland, because I heard my parents speaking about it, the anti-Semitism grew\nquickly. It became monstrous, I think, before breakout of the second World War.",
        "Q: Did your parents talk about what happened to them, or to people they knew, or \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes, I heard them talking about it. They \u2014 the \u2014 the major problem was that\nPoles organized into a \u2014 a \u2014 in \u2014 in the party, which was called Boycott.",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "A: And this was, really, this was their purpose, to boycott the Jews. And then they\nmeant \u2014 fewer people came to the store to buy there. They could find a Polish store,\nnot Jewish. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you have ever seen, there is a book e \u2014 of pictures,\npublished in New York, by Vishniac.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "Q: Oh yes, mm-hm.",
        "A: Have you seen it?",
        "Q: Roman Vishniac, yes.",
        "A: Roman Vishniac. It\u2019s amazing. When you see [indecipherable] you can see the\nporters, who were the ones who suffered most of the Polish boycott, because they,\nyou know, have \u2014 a Pole could take a load on his shoulders without learning\nanything, and take it over.

You know, when \u2014 when you think\nabout life over there before the war, that\u2019s certainly on the one side, it\u2019s the poverty,\nwhich became worse in 1930s, after my birth, when I was a small child. With every\nyear it became worse for the Jews because of this, I mean, because of the boycott,\nbecause of what Poles did. And \u2014 but on the other hand, you \u2014 you must \u2014 it was a\nApril 19, 2009\nlife you could enjoy, with all this. You know, you had something to expect, you\nknow, you didn\u2019t have enough. I think nobody, really, except some rich people, they\ndidn\u2019t have enough bread. They would eat more bread if they would be given. But\nthey knew that in another 10 days, Pesach comes, Passover. And then they will eat\nas much as they want. Or another holiday, or the Sabbath. Was no way, even the\npoorest people, that on the Sabbath they would not \u2014 the whole family would not sit\ndown and eat, really as one should. You know, no way. They would be ashamed of\nit. They wouldn't be ashamed during the week that they cannot give their children\nenough to eat, but on the Sabbath they would certainly be ashamed of, and they\nwould do anything, you know, on Sabbath and the holidays, that they did \u2014 the\nbehavior of the family 1s different, and they can \u2014 and this was really every Friday, I\nwas going already as a four year old child.

        "Q: That\u2019s right across the border, yeah.",

So we went down. When we came back we have\nseen some shots in the ceiling of \u2014 when they \u2014 they shoot around just to frighten\npeople, you know. But \u2014\nApril 19, 2009",

Did you\nhear anything from what was going on down the street?",
        "A: It was a noise there. We heard that it\u2019s burning. I heard them talking about it,\nthat they burned down the synagogue. We didn't think that this happens with the\npeople inside.

        "Q: So-",
        "A: Y-You know, and after this, when the Germans, after burning down the\nsynagogue it became a little quieter. You know, there was nothing going on. Well,\nhere and there some, I would say, things not on the level of the whole town. Like,\nfor instance, I learned at home. I never went to school. And in 1940, my parents\nbrought a Jewish young woman, was teaching me Polish. How to write, how to\nread, and \u2014",
        "Q: Is she the one who taught you history? Because if \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no. She was \u2014 and she was really not a long time. I liked her very much,\nI still remember this.",
        "Q: Do you remember her name?",
        "A: I was six \u2014 no, no. Six or maybe seven years old, she was older. She looked to\nme the perfect lady, you know, th-the perfect girl, which could be I looked at her, I\nApril 19, 2009\nwas waiting for her coming every time. Then one day \u2014 and she learned. I mean, sa\n\u2014 I learned how to write in maybe a couple of months when she was teaching me.\nThen she didn\u2019t come. And I asked my parents what happened, they didn\u2019t want to\ntell me. And then | heard that, one day a talk between them, and one of them saying\nthat her parents are accusing my parents about what happened. And then I\nunderstood what happened. When she left our house after teaching me, she went\nback to her home. She had to cross a lawn which was on the way, quite a large\nlawn, and when she went through it a German soldier went by and just shot her,\nkilled her on the way. I-I \u2014 I remember, when I heard this, I was shocked by it. First\ntime in my life that I really started to understand what\u2019s going on with the Germans\nin that time. All schools were of course closed, and there was no way, even\nreligious schools, like I learned in the chayder, so I could like, continue, up to a\ncertain time when the \u2014 the rabbi was taken to Auschwitz. And I start in another\nplace and the rabbi also was taken away a short time later, and there was no way to\nlearn. I started my school only a-after the war.",

        "A: One \u2014 and, yes, undoubtedly, most customers were Polish. Nearby was a shop, a\nbutcher, and the butcher was Polish, it was not kosher. But my grandfather rented it\nApril 19, 2009\nfor \u2014 to \u2014 to him, and he \u2014 he m \u2014 he was bankrupt. And this was the way they lived\nuntil the war broke out in \u2014 at the end of 1939, beginning of 1940, we were\ninformed that the house of my grandfather is [indecipherable] too much into the\nstreet. And so they had to leave it in 24 hours, and they demolished it, the German \u2014\nnot the Germans, but the people who worked for them, and \u2014 including the Jewish.",
        "Q: So that meant that in this \u2014 was this house owned by your grandfa-father? In\nother words, it was his asset, it was his property?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Completely destroyed?",
        "A: Oh, the whole house was destroyed, yes. This was his major property, he lived\non this because he rented this \u2014 the shops downstairs and \u2014 and he rented the other \u2014\nth-the other apartments. He lived in one of them, and he rented the other, four or\nfive other.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about this grandfather. Did you ha \u2014 did \u2014 did he play a role in\nyour life, in your childhood? Do you remember, or was he a more distant person?",
        "A: H-He was \u2014 no, he was like a grandfather. When I was born, probably in that\ntime, my parents didn't have an apartment of their own, they lived with the\ngrandfather. I was born there, this I was told. Then they moved over to this\napartment. H-H-He was \u2014 he was like a zayde should be, you know, like a\nApril 19, 2009\ngrandfather, a zayde should be. He was the one always prepared for me something\nwhich I liked. And so I loved him, I loved him in that time. Like, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: \u2014 most grandsons would \u2014 would love. He was the one, o-or maybe it was 1941,\nit was already becoming very bad. The pressure was rising all the time. Was\nstanding on the balcony of the \u2014 of the house and he said to me, you see, when this\nwar will end, we are going to Palestine. It was \u2014 for the first time I heard the word\nPalestine.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. I had an uncle there. His son. He was the oldest son, went to Tel Aviv,\nand then there were four sisters, and then my father was the youngest.",

        "A: Yes, but when they demolished his house, we couldn\u2019t take him in because our\napartment was small. So we moved over to the place of my aunt, the oldest aunt\nwho lived in the [indecipherable] in Bendzin. She had the large apartment.",
        "Q: These things sound terrifying, when I \u2014 I mean they sound terrifying at any age,\nbut I am just trying to imagine still, a child of six and seven years old. How did your\nparents explain, or try to explain to you what was going on? Did they \u2014 did they\nApril 19, 2009\ncomfort you, or were they so worried with their own fears that you kept quiet about\nyour own?",
        "A: We spoke very little about it, if at all, if at all. They never, ever, ever, ever spoke\nwith me about it, really. And the truth 1s that I think they \u2014 they were clever to do it,\nnot to tell me anything, because it certainly frightened me, there\u2019s no doubt about\nthis. But they knew what\u2019s going on in my head, you know. They knew that I live a\n\u2014 in an imaginary world. And all this just kind of doesn\u2019t belong to me, and they\nknew it. And I remember my father saying to me, we\u2019re going down to try to open\nthe sukkah. The sukkah for \u2014 a sukkah. And they said to me, you know, and I was\ntrying to explain to him, because there \u2014 there were several things he couldn\u2019t do.\nHe was not allowed to go at [indecipherable] outside, he had to put it in this \u2014\nwhich is not according to the religious laws and the \u2014 there\u2019s several things, also\nwith the sukkah, he couldn\u2019t put this way, he had to put it in another way, and he\nsaid that\u2019s not the way it should be done, it should be \u2014 and then he looked at me\nand he said, you know, I envy you. It\u2019s good to be a child at this time. You know,\nwhen \u2014 he knew I am living in an imaginary world, which 1s not the world of\n[indecipherable] during the war. And I think this was the way, really, you could\nkeep yourself normally.",
        "Q: How about your little sister? She was truly a baby, wasn\u2019t she, at that point, still?\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: Yes, she was a baby, and I felt like this was always, for me she was the baby.\nAnd I always think I told her, look, I will take care of you, you don\u2019t be afraid, I\nwill always take care of you. And that\u2019s really what happened later.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Tell me, after you \u2014 after your grandfather\u2019s house was demolished, how did\nthings proceed, how did life continue to change?",
        "A: So my grandparents moved over to her, my grandfather died later in the \u2014 and\nI\u2019m not sure, but possib \u2014 certainly from natural causes, but it\u2019s also probable that\nhe didn\u2019t get the treatment which he could get if there wouldn't be a war.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He died, and we continued to live. Th-The main problem was how to get away\nfrom the Germans, that they don\u2019t catch you when they go in the streets and catch\nsome Jews to send away. And there were several cases when it was organized. One\nday it was organized this way, that they came to surround our place, all the four\nbuildings. And they took everybody to the police station, or whatever it was, and \u2014\nand they said \u2014 they decided, whatever one of you is going back to his house, or 1s\nApril 19, 2009\nsent over for deportation, as they called it. Deportation was Auschwitz. Auschwitz\nwas not more than about an hour by train from our place. And so, at that time, we\nlearned something. And we learned this, that they \u2014 they are taking away larger\nfamilies, because it\u2019s easier for them. If they have to take, they come over in there\nto bring a thousand Jews, they take larger families, then they do it quicker and it\u2019s\nfor them much easier. We survived this because what happened 1s that a Jewish\npoliceman was there, they were helping the \u2014 the Germans. And they were\npolicemen of the Judenrat. And the Jewish policeman was a distant relative of\nours. So he said, you don\u2019t take \u2014 stay here. Went out and locked the outer lock on\nthe door. So it was clear to everybody who came over there, there is nobody inside,\nthey left already and locked the door.",
        "Q: Did people know that they were being \u2014 go \u2014 going to Auschwitz, or did they\njust know they\u2019re being deported?",
        "A: Not at that time. They were \u2014 they knew they were deported, and not at that time.\nLater on, yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Later \u2014",
        "Q: Was there a ghetto formed \u2014",
        "A: Yes.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "Q: \u2014 in your town, 1n Bendzin?",
        "A: Much later.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Much later. Was just at the end of \u201942 that they oh \u2014 in \u201942, one day, this was the\nsecond time after this, that they called all Jews to the stadium. And in the stadium,\nafter a whole day [indecipherable] waiting, and th \u2014 everybody had to go through a\nstation where Gestapo was sitting, and they decided every one, if he is going to be\ndeported, or he is going back.",
        "Q: Did you remember that, did you go?",
        "A: A-And \u2014 yes, I do remember it, very well. Because what I did was \u2014 and I did it\nmyself, I had my \u2014 when \u2014 when my parents with my sister came over to the table, I\nkind of hid ara \u2014 behind them. So here seems three people, and he stamped the \u2014 the\n[.D.s and he gave it to them, then he has seen a fourth I.D. He looked around and\nsee me and what\u2019s that [indecipherable] cause then it would be already you\ncouldn't change it any more. But they told me later, the parents that I saved them,\nbecause families of four, they were deported, and only smaller families not. So my\nhiding behind it, and so they \u2014 they manifested only three members.",
        "Q: And then the fourth seems to show up, but the stamp is already there \u2014",

        "A: Yeah, yeah. So they \u2014 they gave it to me, they let me out. Then the \u2014 a man\ncame, a \u2014 a distant relative of mine. You know, I had maybe \u2014 I counted for si \u2014\nKaddish somewhere, maybe tomorrow, I counted \u2014 I had first relatives, first degree\nrelatives, up to first cousins, there must have been some 25. And we speak about\ndistant relatives, more distant, second cousins, so once \u2014 first cousins once\nremoved, we\u2019re coming to maybe 200.",

Last time when it was, I had to \u2014 well, usually I give\nit to the agent, to the travel agent, and he does it for me. Now, they changed the law,\nand the rules, and now you have to come yourself and be there. Takes half a day. I\ndidn't have time for it. So I was angry about it, well, you cannot do anything. I came\nover there, it was four months ago. And I come in there and they \u2014 I was waiting\nwith the others, and I come to a large hall where I\u2019ve seen people waiting, they said,\nthis takes the most time.

        "A: \u2014 I went to the consulate in Jerusalem. And they said, this may take two or three\nhours to hear. The minute when I come in, I sat down. Merin. I said to my wife,\nsomething wrong here, it cannot be. All these people were before us. But I come in\nthere, a woman is sitting there, at one of the windows, smiling. And she says to me,\nyou are Merin? I say yes. You are from Bendzin? I says, what do you mean?\nThat\u2019s not written there. So, she said, my father is from Bendzin, and he told me if\nat any time somebody named Merin will come, take him immediately, he is from\nBendzin. And this was her.",
        "Q: How wonderful.",
        "A: Yeah, was funny.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, like \u2014",
        "Q: Did you know who her father was?",
        "A: I didn't know him before, I don \u2014 she thought that I know, but I was a\u2014 you\nknow, \u2019'ma-\u2014",
        "Q: A lot of Merins, yes.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: \u2014I was so small.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I knew many Merins, but not \u2014 in 1942, a man came back, a distant relative of\nours, and he had the broken hand, I remember. And he told us that he was on the\nway to Auschwitz, and he jumped out of the train. And he broke his hand, and \u2014\nand th-this, but came back. And I remember him sitting down with my parents and I\nwas listening from the side and I heard him telling about Auschwitz, what it means\nAuschwitz and what \u2014 that they are killing Jews there.",
        "Q: And you were nine years old?",
        "A: I was nine years, yes. When \u2014 when he left, I heard my father and mother\nspeaking, they were angry. They said, he is lying. It cannot be that this is\nhappening. It\u2019s really \u2014 it\u2019s a pity that he is saying things like this, which are not\ntrue, he\u2019s frightening everybody. This was the attitude. There were a few people\nlike him, but they didn't believe it. I think that this is probably the basis for not\ndoing more to defend themselves, of the Jews, because it seemed so unreal, so\nimpossible, that anybody, any country, they may not like Jews, but th \u2014 they \u2014\nnobody would think about it, that there may be an [indecipherable] arrangement of\n\u2014 of massacre of Jews. So \u2014\nApril 19, 2009",
        "Q: And then \u2014 but it \u2014 in some ways it sounds like he gave you the idea that saved\nyou, if we go further in your story.",
        "A: Maybe. Maybe.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t want to suggest, but you know \u2014",
        "A: Maybe this was, I \u2014 I ran away because of my mother.",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s get to that part. Let\u2019s go \u2014 after this person visited, that\u2019s very close\nthen to the time that things changed.",
        "A: That we moved into \u2014 into the ghetto.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We moved into the ghetto and th-the starvation became much more serious.",
        "Q: All right, so now \u2014 now we speak \u2014 excuse me Professor Merin, I\u2019m going to\npause once more. Press \u2014",
        "A: Press the pause, and \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, so now I\u2019m recording again.",
        "A: And now stopped, you pause [indecipherable] again, you see.",
        "Q: Record?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. It doesn\u2019t. See, here\u2019s the thing.",
        "A: Yes. Now you have to \u2014\nApril 19, 2009",
        "Q: Thank you.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Thank you.",
        "A: That\u2019s all right.",
        "Q: You did it, all right. So, we\u2019re in the ghetto. Then \u2014",
        "A: We moved into the ghetto end of \u201942, and the main problem there was starvation,\nthe \u2014 we didn\u2019t have enough to eat.",
        "Q: How did your parents get food for you?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t. They \u2014",
        "Q: They had no way, huh?",
        "A: Yeah. They cannot \u2014 I don\u2019t have, we never forget, you know, just the two or\nthree evenings before a \u2014 the end of the ghetto, that \u2014 from dinner, we had one egg.\nAnd we were sitting, all four of us, and my father or my mother said look, we\ndiscussed it [indecipherable] between us, and we could divide this egg into four.\nOr another way, one will receive the whole egg, and then when we get another one,\nthe second one, third one and so on. So we decided we go for one, so that he can be\nstronger, and \u2014 and they said, we decided you\u2019|l be the one. And they gave me the\negg. You know, I was eating it [indecipherable] and you know, it looked to me like\nthe delicatess(ph) of the world. And in the middle of eating this, I raised my head, I\nApril 19, 2009\nhave seen the three people, both my parents, and Dina, my sister looking at me with\nhungry eyes. You know, I remember their eyes, you know, like it will be yesterday.\nMaybe this explains more than anything else, the starvation which we went through\nat that time. There was certainly not enough bread, not enough anything, ca \u2014 on the\nbread, you know. Not even all these ersatz, the \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014 that came instead of\ncoffee, like ersatz coffee and ersatz tea and things like this.",
        "Q: Replacement, replacement, replacement.",
        "A: Yes. But even that \u2014 this we couldn\u2019t get.",
        "Q: In all this ttme, do you remember having any contact with either the Germans, or\nany of the Poles, or the soldiers? I mean, did these \u2014 did any of these outsiders come\ninto your world? No.",
        "A: No, not at all.",
        "Q: Not at \u2014",
        "A: It couldn\u2019t be. It couldn\u2019t \u2014 it couldn\u2019t happen, it couldn\u2019t be. The-They wou \u2014 th\n\u2014 our way of knowing things was through my mother. We used to go to the\nJudenrat, which was in the second town, just nearby, and to sit with them. The\nhead of the Judenrat was also a me \u2014 a Merin. Probably a \u2014 I don\u2019t know even, he\nwas certainly not a relative of \u2014 a near relative, but maybe he was a distant relative,\nthis could well be. And she was meeting him, and he was telling her about what\u2019s\nApril 19, 2009\ngoing on. Towards the end of July \u201943, she came back home and she said, they am\ngoing to cancel this ghetto. And, you know, my father said, how do you know\u201d?\nWhat happened? She say, I have seen today that the Gestapo took all the members\nof the Judenrat somewhere away, and they \u2014 they didn\u2019t come back. This must me\n\u2014 mean that they send them to Auschwitz. We already knew at that time about\nAuschwitz. Ha \u2014",
        "Q: And so they started to believe the man who had come to your home?",
        "A: Yes, yes, at that time they already believed what\u2019s going on there.",
        "Q: And so, it\u2019s about a year\u2019s difference, isn\u2019t it?",
        "A: Yes, this was about \u2014",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t you say he came at 1942?",
        "A: Yes. And this was July \u201943, when they \u2014 July \u00b043 already, it wa \u2014 1t became clear\nwhat\u2019s going on. Still tried to make normal life. I know \u2014 I remember my father,\nwhen we moved into the ghetto, my father tried to build a fence around the small\npiece of land which belonged to this \u2014 to the room which we had, because no Jew\nwas allowed more than one room. So he built this, and I remember somebody\ncoming over and said, are you crazy? They are going to kill off all of us. Why do\nyou do it? Well, it was quite clear. When my mother said it, she said, we cannot\nApril 19, 2009\nstay here. They will cancel this ghetto. And they \u2014 they decided to leave the ghetto,\nand try to escape into the woods.",
        "Q: Did she know what was happening with her family from the village?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: She had \u2014",
        "A: At that time, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: There was no connection with the village, there was no way to know. But, we\ndecided to leave, and we decided to leave on a Sunday where they \u2014 there\u2019s less\nguards, fewer guards around the ghetto. So we decided to \u2014 to leave on the first of\nAugust, Sunday, in the morning.",
        "Q: 1943.",
        "A: 1943.",
        "Q: Just before your 10\" birthday.",
        "A: Before, yes. In the evening of the 31\u201c of July, you know, I remember how I went\nto sleep and I put on my clothes and I put them neatly on the chair, I thought, to\nhave tomorrow when we leave [indecipherable] what I decided to take, and they\nwere put down here. In the middle of the night, the Germans came. This wen \u2014\nshouting of the streets, the Germans are coming, the Germans are coming. And\nApril 19, 2009\nJudenrein. Judenrein, they are taking everybody. It\u2019s not that they select people,\nsome to come and some not, they are taking everybody. The same \u2014 so we be \u2014 we\nhad no choice. Now, there were \u2014 it was impossible, because they put heavy guards\naround the ghetto. It was impossible to leave. We went down into what we called\nthe bunker. The bunker, many families arranged some way out, to escape, because,\nif it was not the Judenrein and they were coming and taking, then they took\nanybody whom they found. They \u2014 they didn\u2019t look too much for it, but yes. So we\nwent down into the bunker, and the bunker was a very good one. You had to go\nthrough a \u2014 through a cupboard like this, to move a drawer, and then to open\nanother door like this, and went to go down over a ladder, and into the bunker. Very\ndifficult, nobody could really \u2014 when you open the cupboard, you wouldn\u2019t see\nanything. So we went down. This was prepared for exactly such a case. It was\nprepared for four people. In a short time we found ourselves with 16 other people,\nand you couldn\u2019t say anything, I mean, all our family came, cause they knew that\nour bunker is the best. We stayed there for three days, probably the worst three days\nof my life. It was terrible. It was August, very hot, small place. It was \u2014",
        "Q: No toilet.",
        "A: Of course no toilet, but there was no water in th-there. We didn\u2019t think about it.\nThere was no water. There was no place to sit for everybody, you know? My father,\nApril 19, 2009\nremember, was sitting on the ladder, which was taking down. The thirst was\nterrible. On the third day they understood how it\u2019s done. They came over there and\nthey couldn\u2019t find the entrance into this, so they went down into the basement and\nstarted to break the wall. Soldiers came and start to break the wall. When they did\nit, and they opened the hole, there were my cousin, older than me by three or four\nyears shouted we \u2014 we give in, we don\u2019t \u2014 we give up and we are \u2014 we are going\nout. So the soldier shouted, all right, how do we get in here? So he told him where\nto open it. Started to go out, and they took all of us to the place where we were\nwaiting for the train to Auschwitz. It was terrible three days, really, it\u2019s not only \u2014I\ntried once to go out, and it was quiet, to find water. And they couldn\u2019t, there was no\nwater anywhere, they closed the water, the Germans. So there was no water\nanywhere. I looked [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So you had gone out of the bunker into your old apart \u2014 into your old room?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And did you remember seeing anything, or hearing anything \u2014",
        "A: It was a ground floor, I \u2014 I\u2014 I heard a cart on the street, so I looked out, and I\nlooked behind it. It was a cart full of dead bodies. I remember the picture of it, was\nterrible.",
        "Q: Was this the first time that you saw dead bodies?\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: Dead, yes, yes. There were so many of them, this I remember. Many, one on the\nother, on the other. But it were terrible three days. And then they were taken to the\nstation, to the train station. It was \u2014 it was not the regular train station, 1t was a\nstation which was made up for Jews, to take up the Jews. And we were waiting\nthere surrounded by the German soldiers. And there my mother told me, you must\nrun away, must run away. So I said, okay. I took my sister with me, and I broke out.\nThere was a fence with \u2014 a wooden fence, so I could break up one place, and being\na slim boy, could easily get through, and my sister was slim as I was. And we went\nthrough it. After a few minutes, when we were there hiding on the other side of the\nfence, I found out that we are in a German military camp.",
        "Q: Oh, God.",
        "A: And of course it took another 10 minutes or so, and the soldiers found us. But\nluckily, you know, both of us looked sympathetic, I would say.",
        "Q: You\u2019re kids, you\u2019re kids.",
        "A: Kids, and the soldiers didn\u2019t beat us or \u2014 as they would do otherwise, but they\ntook us back, and they send us in. When I came over there I wanted to speak with\nmy mother, but she said. when I was, not yet at her, she said, don\u2019t come to me,\ndon\u2019t come to me, because us there will be, when they see that we are your parents,\nafter you tried to run away. A second time, when we were \u2014 it was close and the \u2014\nApril 19, 2009\nthe train was already coming in, I thought, that\u2019s the last chance that we have, and I\ntried it another time. And th-this time we succeeded. We went by, not far from the\nGerman watchman who was there. He \u2014 he was looking over the street on the other\nside. He didn\u2019t look anybody would walk nearby him, cause he wouldn\u2019t think that\nany Jew would do it. And this was just off the edge, where all the Poles were\ncoming through. So, the only thing I felt was \u2014 my thought was only, how does it\nfeel when the bullet would struck you \u2014 strike you. And so we \u2014 we could get out\nfrom there.",
        "Q: And Dina was not crying, she was not \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no. No, no.",
        "Q: She \u2014 she trusted big brother.",
        "A: Yes. She n\u2014 she never. But once when I was talking about it with the scouts, and\nthen they asked a lot of questions; one of them was, how did you go out your sister,\nhow much did you quarrel, how much did you fight with her and so on? And I said,\nnever. We never quarreled. We never was fighting. Not in that time, and not after\nthis. And that\u2019s true.",
        "Q: Can I ask \u2014 can I ask you too, how did your relation to your father change?\nBecause it sounds wi \u2014 the last time we left it is before the war, and he wants one\nApril 19, 2009\nthing for you and you want another. But certainly with the way things took, that was\nout of \u2014 that \u2014 that issue went off the table.",
        "A: How right you are. How right you are, you know. That\u2019s exactly so. You know,\nfor the first time in \u2014 in my life, my young life, I felt sorrow about my father, cause\nI felt how much he suffers. And for the first time in my life I came to him, I said,\nlook, if you want to teach me religious stuff, I want you. Just say when, I am\ncoming and learn it. First time. Cause he knew that I don\u2019t like.",
        "Q: And how did he react to that?",
        "A: He was \u2014 I think he was happy that he \u2014 he gave me lessons.",
        "Q: Did you feel closer to him, besides having sympathy and seeing his sorrow, did \u2014\ndid you feel like he was closer to you, too?",
        "A: Yes, I think so. I think so. For the first time that he really \u2014 I felt that he\nunderstands me better. But I certainly did understand him. I knew that he 1s\nsuffering this. So we went \u2014 we left this place, and the two of us went to town. And\nI knew about the Polish woman who was the maid in my aunt\u2019s place before the\nwar.",
        "Q: Had you met her?",
        "A: Y \u2014I knew her well.",
        "Q: You knew her well, okay.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: Very well, even. She came from a village in Poland, and she was the only Polish\nwoman whom I really knew. I didn\u2019t know anybody else. I went to her. And we\nstayed there for one and a half years.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: We were hiding in a place what \u2014 what \u2014 there was a \u2014 it was one room when she\nlived where she lived, but there was a connection to a small room after this. We put\na cupboard between the two, so anybody who came in has seen only one room, and\nwe were in the second room. Second room was about this size, maybe a little\nsmaller.",
        "Q: So, was this the last time you saw your parents?",
        "A: Yes, it was the last time. [phone ringing]",
        "Q: Yeah. So this was the last time you saw your parents.",
        "A: Yes, this was the last time I\u2019ve seen my parents. I said the \u2014 this Polish woman,\nwhen \u2014 she was not at \u2014 at home, she was working in a German factory for\nammunition. She was preparing the sandwiches for the workers, the bread wa \u2014\nsandwiches were bread and jam, you know, and they \u2014 much di \u2014 that was her job.\nShe was working there and when she came back home, she found us waiting for her\nout in the street. She was \u2014 I \u2014 I am not sure that she was very happy about it. 1am\ncertain that she was not. But she was shocked by th \u2014 us. And \u2014\nApril 19, 2009",
        "Q: How did she behave?",
        "A: [indecipherable] you know, she behaved all right. She behaved as \u2014 as she\nshould. Sh-She said to us, after a few days, look, she said, if you had come with\nyour parents, I would never take you in. This would be impossible. But you came\nalone, you two, you will stay with me here. And she was frightened all the time, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Well, did she have a family, or was she living by herself?",
        "A: She was single, but her family was in the village. The family certainly did not\nsupport her. One day when I asked her what would your family do if they would\nknow that you keep Jews? So she said they would go to the Gestapo. They would\ngo, she would \u2014 she lived after the war in a \u2014 Italy, and I came to visit her several\ntimes. One day when I came, she was sad. I said, what happened Aniela(ph)? A \u2014\nsaid, my brothers came to Rome to see the Polish pope, and \u2014 you know, there was\na Polish pope \u2014 pope, and they didn\u2019t call me. They didn\u2019t come to see me. I am\nhere, not far from Rome, you know? Just imagine, all the time she was in Italy, she\nwas sending parcels to her family, of fruits, of \u2014 usually of some \u2014",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: [indecipherable] like this\nApril 19, 2009",

        "Q: Did she tell you while you were living with her, or many years later?",
        "A: At least twice. She was at that time telling me \u2014 no, I asked her, during the time\nwas there, she said it. I thought maybe she\u2019s not right. We were lucky because we\ndidn't have, you know, she couldn\u2019t \u2014 she had to pay on the black market to get\nsome food for us. And luckily I knew where my parents \u2014 they told me before I left,\nthey said, look, we put some money in this place. The money \u2014 and I knew where it\nis, and I told her. And said, I will never find it. You know, the way I explained to\nher. So we decided my sister would go. She doesn\u2019t look Jewish at all, and she \u2014\nthey will take \u2014 she \u2014 so she went with her. On the way \u2014 they passed a park or so\non the way, when suddenly Polish kids started to shout, a Jewish girl, a Jewish girl.\nYou know, there was \u2014",
        "Q: How do you say that in Polish?\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: Zyd\u00e9wka. And when \u2014 when they \u2014 she succeeded to hide, my sister, run away\n[indecipherable] somehow found \u2014 found a place to \u2014 to hide, until 1t became dark,\nand then they came back.",

        "Q: But during that year and a half, how did you feel in her one and a half rooms?\nHow did you interact? How much of the outside did you see?",
        "A: Not at all. We \u2014 we couldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: You were just in that little tiny area.",

It was a game, an imaginary\nworld in which the two of us lived. We\u2019re playing, all imagination. I remember she\n\u2014 one day she wanted to make a present to us, and she brought over paper figures\nfor us to play, just to show that she wants to give us. And she was so angry because\nshe found that we are not playing with this. And I couldn\u2019t explain to her, we are\nnot playing \u2014",
        "Q: Paper dolls.",
        "A: \u2014 paper dolls, or we are not playing anything which exists, we are playing\nsomething which does not exist, just an imaginary world. That\u2019s the only way that\nyou can live in a place like this for so long as a child.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did Dina cry, or did you cry at night \u2014",
        "A: No-\nApril 19, 2009",
        "Q: \u2014 thinking about your parents?",
        "A: \u2014no, I don\u2019t think so. I never heard her crying and I was never crying. There was\nno way that \u2014",
        "Q: Did yo \u2014 were you thinking about your parents during this time?",
        "A: Certainly thinking about it, especially when the war e-ended. On the 27\" of\nJanuary 1945, in this place there was a cousin of mine who \u2014 who stayed with her,\nmuch older than I am. He was maybe 15 years older than I was.",
        "Q: He also stayed with Aniela(ph)?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Oh, so were you together, or was he in a separate \u2014",

        "A: We were all \u2014 yeah, he lived in the first room mainly, he didn\u2019t stay with us\nthere. On the 27\" of January 1945, he woke me up at six o\u2019clock in the morning,\nand he says, rise quickly. The Germans found us. And I looked through the window\nand I have seen a lot of soldiers there. And it was clear that they found us, and that\u2019s\nthe end of it. And suddenly we see a Jeep passing by with a red flag, with the red\narmy. So this was not the \u2014 these were not Germans, but Russians, and for the first\nApril 19, 2009\ntime. So we left a few days later, this place. Oh, and they found another apartment\nfor us. We stayed with Aniela(ph).",
        "Q: Can I ask this? In her one room, was she \u2014 did she have like a separate little\nhouse, or did she have one room \u2014",
        "A: No, no.",

        "A: No, it was an apartment building with maybe six, seven apartments there. At\nleast six, seven, maybe 10, even.",
        "Q: Was it a courtyard as well, like you had?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. it was a entrance from the street. What my cousin did, he closed the entrance\nto the building. Was all the time kept locked. Nobody was there. And he \u2014 he\ndestroyed all the other apartments so that nobody would move in. So there was\nanything which could be broken, he broke.",
        "Q: So, in other words, Aniela(ph) lived in this apartment building by herself, with\nyou.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: With the three of you.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: Yes, until one family moved in, in spite of the ruined house, you know. And so\nwe had to take care much more about it. For instance, in the winter of 1944, it was a\nbitter winter, but one day when they \u2014 she came back from work, the neighbors say\nto her, look, what\u2019s going on there? There was the chimney, there was steam from\nyour chimney. And so she said, I left it, my mistake. Nobody would keep it, because\nthere was not enough \u2014",
        "Q: Fuel for everything.",
        "A: \u2014 fuel to run it. So nobody would leave it when you are not at home. But from\nthat time we couldn\u2019t heat the room in the bitter winter, you know, because it\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 it would happen again, they would know that something fishy is going on\nthere [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you interact with your cousin much, when she was not there? I mean, were\nyou then more together?",

        "A: Yes, yes, she was \u2014 they were together, yeah.",
        "Q: Did he come to her after she found \u2014 after you had \u2014",
        "A: He came probably a short time before we came, because he was caught by the\nGestapo and accused of trading the points, you know, which were given for \u2014 for \u2014\nfor food.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And he was put, as they did it for a \u2014 before a court, which looked like any other\ncourt, except that they had only one sentence, this was the death sentence, and that\u2019s\nwhat he received, the death sentence for this. But a day later he ran away, he\nsucceeded to flee from the prison, and he came to Aniela(ph), stayed there with her.\nAnd that\u2019s \u2014 after the war, this was the thi \u2014 like the third period, you know, once\nApril 19, 2009\nthe \u2014 once the war was over. I was still \u2014 I didn't learn in school at any time. And I\nwas really lucky, because two or three months later, in \u2014 in April, actually two\nmonths later, in April 1945, my aunt came from Russia. She survived in Russia,\nshe was one of the sisters of my father.",
        "Q: Had she left for Russia \u2014",
        "A: In 1939 in August, just before the war. She said, I will not stay here.",
        "Q: Interesting, interesting.",
        "A: Pll not stay here waiting for the Germans. So that she decided to leave and run\naway.",
        "Q: Did sh \u2014 how \u2014 I had a couple of questions here. Did she have stories of how she\nhad been treated, and what had happened to her when she was in Russia?",
        "A: Yes, she was \u2014 she succeeded to get through to Lvov. You know Lvov is today\nth \u2014 one of the three cities of Ukraine. And she was there, settled there and \u2014 but\nshe lived in Lvov with thousands, thousands of refugees who came over there, and\nlife was not good. She was a rich woman. She was otherwise not like the other\nbrothers and sisters. And in Lvov, the rumors came in 1940 that it\u2019s not bad with\nthe Germans. They didn\u2019t know anything about killing Jews. And they said, well,\nthey are not very good, the Germans, but it\u2019s not that it\u2019s impossible to live with\nthem. In \u2014 in April 1940, the Russians announced that whoever wants to go back to\nApril 19, 2009\nthe German side can do it, and they will help, they will make a train which will take\nthem to the German side. She decided to go back, like another one or 2,000 people\nwho came to the train. On a certain day they came to the train, and when they\u2019re\nsitting in the tain \u2014 train, the Russians closed the doors, and they said, you are\nenemy of the people, you want to go back to the Germans. You are all going to\nSiberia.",
        "Q: And this is during the Molovov-Ribbentrop Pact, when they\u2019re friends?",
        "A: This was after this.",
        "Q: Oh, this was after this?",
        "A: Yeah, the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact was til the war, til the \u2014 til bast --\nBarbarossa, til the attack of the Germans.",
        "Q: Til 1941.",
        "A: Til 1941. Til the 22\u2122 of June 1941.",
        "Q: Oh, and I thought you said it was in 1940 that she wanted to go back.",
        "A: Yes, 1940.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s \u2014 so it\u2019s while they\u2019re still friends?",
        "A: Yes. Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was in 1939.",
        "Q: Correct.",
        "A: This was in 1940.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "Q: So that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying, isn\u2019t it unusual \u2014",
        "A: There were still friends.",
        "Q: \u2014 that while they\u2019re still friends, they\u2019re called enemies of the people, and taken\nto Siberia?",
        "A: Don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s what they said, that\u2019s what they did. They took all of them to\nSiberia, all these who decided, according to their saying, and it really seemed\nunlikely that they will do anything, because they were friends. They took them all to\nSiberia. And many, many of them survived, because of this. But what she did, she\ndecided we\u2019re not going to Siberia. On the way [indecipherable] and succeeded to\nflee from that train. They were stopping the train from time to time, once in a\ncouple of days, and so \u2014 to supply, to buy some products, and that\u2019s what they did.\nAnd they went down and got back. And they li \u2014 stayed there, until in \u201941 the\nGermans came in. When the Germans came in, her husband was killed on the same\nthing. They went from house to house looking for communists and Jews and took\nthem, and all the men were shot in the same thing. She told me how after a couple\nof days, she went to the Gestapo and told them look, my husband is in prison.\nWould you \u2014 I brought him a sweater because it\u2019s cold. And the German looked at\nit, gave it back to her. He doesn\u2019t need it. So she understood. She stayed with her\nson, they changed th \u2014 on false papers. Got an I.D. of a Polish woman and that\u2019s\nApril 19, 2009\nwhat \u2014 what \u2014 what they did to survive. When she came back in April \u201945 \u2014 no, it\nwas the first time, she said, I will take care of, we will not staying here with\nAniela(ph) or with Wolfe. You will come with me. She had the son, the son\nsurvived with her and she really took very good care of \u2014 of me and 1n fact, she\nnever let me feel that I am not her son, or Dina 1s not her daughter.",
        "Q: I was going to ask, did she take Dina, too? Yes.",
        "A: She \u2014 yes. We\u2019re all \u2014 we were three of us there like brothers and sister.",
        "Q: And you stayed in Bendzin, you moved to Israel\u2019?",
        "A: No, she moved to another town there, Hoczew, and this was the place where she\nlived before the war, not far from there, a more German town than ours, Bendzin.\nAnd we stayed there. In 1940 \u2014 in 1946, the chief rabbi of Israel, Yitzhak Herzog,\ncame to Poland, and he had an agreement with the Polish government that he can\ntake children up to the age of 14, if they are orphans, they will go with him to\nIsrael, Palestine at that time. And so we joined this train. Went with him, but 1t was\nstuck in Prague, and then we went to Austria, where we had that distant relative of\nthe new husband of my aunt. And they stayed \u2014 w-we stayed there for some time,\ndecided to go back to Poland because you couldn\u2019t move on. And it was a camp of\nthe DPs in Linz. The DP camps were run by the Americans, and by the Joint. So\nthere were Jewish people of the Joint there wh-who were really helping us a lot.\nApril 19, 2009\nAnd the Americans, they were running the places. And it was Bindermichl, and the\nother place in Linz was Wegsheid. Just these days I see in the newspaper a picture\nof Wegsheid, which was not far from there. So, we \u2014 we stayed there and came\nback to [indecipherable]. When \u2014 already in 1945, we understood that our parents\nwill not come back. You know, at the beginning, the first few months, e-every \u2014\neverybody who knocking on the door, maybe they are coming back, or one of them\nis coming back. But towards April or May, it was clear that nobody would come\nback. In fact, I tried to find out what happened with them. I went to Auschwitz,\ncause that time I was 11, I went to Auschwitz with my cousin, tried to look there\nover this, the only thing I could find is in \u2014 in the gas chambers that was written the\nkemar(ph) \u2014 revenge, which they have written with their blood.",
        "Q: Were there people, were there officials in Auschwitz? Was there anybody\nmanning \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t mean Germans, I mean, had anyone else come in, was\nthe place empty, was it deserted?",
        "A: It was deserted in that time. The-They opened it as a museum much later \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: But at that time it was just deserted. You could come in, you could go in, look\nwhere \u2014 whatever you want, at wherever you want, and that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what we did.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "Q: And no one was \u2014 yeah, and no one was there keeping \u2014 you know, looking at\nthe \u2014 whatever records they might have kept to say, okay, let\u2019s see, maybe you\u2019re \u2014\nthere was nobody there?",
        "A: I\u2014I wouldn\u2019t know it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t know itt.",
        "Q: You were 11 years old, also.",
        "A: Yes, I wouldn\u2019t know it. The Russians came in on the same day, on the 27\" of\nJanuary \u00b045,they came into Auschwitz \u2014",
        "Q: Auschwitz.",
        "A: \u2014 the same day they came into our town.",
        "Q: How did they behave? Did you have any interaction with the Russian soldiers?",
        "A: Not too much.",
        "Q: Not too much.",
        "A: Not too much. My cousin left immediately, he had a \u2014 a red \u2014",
        "Q: Armband?",
        "A: \u2014 banderola(ph) \u2014 armband, like this. And he went down. And I\u2019ve seen the\nsoldiers from the window, I\u2019ve seen soldiers stopping him and talking with him, and\nshouting at him. And then somebody ordering him to take it off, so he took it off.\nApril 19, 2009\nNo, there was not much communication with the Russians. The Russians left\nAuschwitz also, very quickly.",
        "Q: So they were on to Berlin?",
        "A: Yes, they went on. This was the south, I believe, to Berlin, where Zhukov and\nhis army was more to the north.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: This was a southern army that moved out. The Poles didn\u2019t behave too well after\nthe war, you know. I remember first time that I really went out, to the square of the\ncity center, pole \u2014 position where a man stood at one of the windows and gave a\nspeech about new Poland, and the communist Poland. They called it the socialist\nparty, and the socialist Poland. And they said that the Russian promised that if they\nwill behave really like true communists, they will change the name of the party\nfrom the socialist part of Poland to the communist party of Poland. Very like today\nthat they say that. And I was standing there listening to him, together with\nthousands of Poles, when the woman said to me, you are Jewish? I said yes. She\nsaid, how do you survive? So I told her, a Polish woman helped us. She said oh\nGod, she said, oh God. And a boy much older than I was, you know, heard it from\n[indecipherable] what Jew, you are a Jew? Ga \u2014 gave me a fist in my head, in my\nface. And you know, to me, then I understood that they don\u2019t like us too much. I\nApril 19, 2009\ncouldn\u2019t find a \u2014 a barber to \u2014 to make my head, which looked terrible, of course,\nafter all these years. Nobody wanted to take me, when he understood that I am\nJewish, yes.",
        "Q: That\u2019s an awful lot for an 11 year old to have to look at, to deal with \u2014 12 year\nold.",
        "A: Yes, yeah. It was not nice. You know, at that time it was really \u2014 later on \u2014 I\nwent to Poland again. I left in 1949 for Israel, when \u2014 when it was allowed, when\nthe Polish government allowed the people to go out to Israel, only to Israel. But\nmany years later I\u2019ve been in Poland, just like eight or 10 years ago. So now they\naccepted me, now in a different way, because I came, they knew at the time a\nprofessor of ophthalmology and I immediately also invited a Polish ophthalmologist\nto come to Israel and I will help him for a couple of weeks to see the country, but\nmaybe to learn about ophthalmology in Israel. And they were very happy about it.\nMade a dinner for me and so this was very nice. And I tried to think all the time, is\nthere still anti-Semitism in Poland? And you know what? It changed completely. It\nbecame ridiculous. It\u2019s not that there is no anti-Semitism, but it\u2019s an anti-Semitism\nof \u2014 of a ridiculous sort. You could only laugh at it, you know? I remember my \u2014 a\n\u2014a cousin of mine in Israel went to the town, to Bendzin, and he took pictures,\nvideo pictures, he had a \u2014 a team which [indecipherable] for him. And then he\nApril 19, 2009\nasked people, he went to the school. The school exists, but it\u2019s not called\nFurstenberg.",
        "Q: What happened to Furstenberg?",
        "A: Fursten(ph) was killed by the Germans, like anybody else. It was \u2014 you know,\nthey didn\u2019t kill people because they were poor or rich, they killed people because\nthey were Jewish. He was Jewish, that was enough. He spoke at the school. They\nasked him to speak, which \u2014 so he spoke with them, and si \u2014 before I start my talk,\nwho knows what was the name of the school before the war? Not one of them\nknew. Said, did you hear the name of Furstenberg? Not one of them knew. So he\ntold them the history of the school and about. Then he went into a place that looked\nvery similar to our house. So it\u2019s three buildings around a large courtyard. It was in\nanother part of the city. I knew that there were two places like this. Ours was\ndestroyed later, cause they put the \u2014 a road there. They built a road there. And the\nother place, he went there. And in both places there were Jewish \u2014 there only Jewish\npeople living. And he went around, first in the main street of the city and asked\npeople, remember the Jews who lived here? Nobody know. He went into this house,\nwhere only Jews lived, in all of the three buildings. And when they came out and\nthey were standing around him, and he says to them, remember the Jews who lived\nhere? Not one. You look at the people, he took pictures. Old people that certainly\nApril 19, 2009\nlived there, you know, in the second World War. Nobody remembers. Then a dog\npassed by, and he looks at the dog, and the woman sticks out her head from one of\nthe windows and calls, Aaron, Aaron. So he says to her, that\u2019s the name of the\ndog\u2019? She says yes. Why Aaron? So she says, Aaron, that\u2019s so that we remember\nthe Jews who lived here. This was the first time that he found somebody who\nremembered the Jews, you know, through the dog. This is ridiculous. That\u2019s not the\nsame anti-Semitism that frightened my parents and the Jews before the war, or even\nafter the war, in the first years after the war. It \u2014 1t was just same like before the\nwar, in Kielce, the pogrom in Kielce where more than 40 Jews were killed in 1946.",
        "Q: How do you explain that? How do you explain it?",
        "A: You know, I\u2019m not sure that I tried to think even about it. It certainly changed,\nthere\u2019s no \u2014 today, it stopped at \u2014 it\u2019s something on a personal level, it\u2019s not \u2014\ncertainly not that [indecipherable] of a country.",
        "Q: Did you feel when you were \u2014 when you were meeting with people, and they had\nthis dinner, that there was a lack of sincerity? That there was a lack of\nunderstanding, of genuineness, that somehow or other you couldn\u2019t trust what it was\nthat you were seeing?",
        "A: That they could not trust?",
        "Q: No, that you could not.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: Well, may \u2014 may well be like this, yes. That \u2014 that I couldn\u2019t trust everything\nthat was said to me. You know, after I invited the ophthalmologist, I got maybe\nthree or four calls from the mayors of the townships of \u2014 which belonged to this\narea, and they were all at the dinner, five mayors, cause these were the places where\nJews \u2014 Jewish people lived around, including Sztemaszitsa(ph), the \u2014 the village of\nmy mother. And after I left, and I left the invitation for one of the [indecipherable]\nfrom Dombrowa, one of the fi \u2014 five townships. I got later maybe three or four\ncalls from the mayors. Look, maybe you take them for three weeks instead of two\nweeks. And another one calls me, maybe you know, I have somebody else who may\nbe better, maybe we\u2019ll take two ones, you know. [indecipherable] the Poles, one\nmust understand it. I don\u2019t know if you read the book, it was Michener, was\n[indecipherable] Poland.",
        "Q: No, but I heard of it, I know of it.",
        "A: You know, when you read it, you \u2014 you read the history of a tragedy. The Poles\nsuffered always, from the beginning. The Jews suffered more, but it was a tragedy\nfor the Poles, what was going on there. The Swedes attacked them, I think it was the\n17\" century, 17\" or 18\", I believe 17 century, and massacred the Poles. You know,\nthey killed thousands, thousands of Poles. And if it wasn\u2019t the Swedes, then it was\nthe Russians or the Germans, the Prussians, you know, all of the time. They\nApril 19, 2009\nsuffered a lot. And on the \u2014 on the personal level, they suffered from the system, it\nwas a feudal system. Why are there so many Polish jokes, the Polack jokes in \u2014 in \u2014\nin the United States, you know, because they came when the [indecipherable] was\n\u2014 was annihilated at the beginning of the 20\" century, after the second World War,\nthe end of the second World War, suddenly they could trave \u2014 they could g \u2014 and\nmany of them traveled to the United States, they had relatives here or so \u2014 they\ncame over here, most of them settled in Chicago, and it\u2019s not only they didn\u2019t know\nEnglish, cause Ukraines also didn\u2019t know English when they came over, and \u2014",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking probably the first World War, yes?",
        "A: Yes, first war.",
        "Q: First World War, mm-hm.",
        "A: Did I say second? No, first World War. And the Ukraines when they came over,\nthey also didn\u2019t know English. They didn't know English, but they didn\u2019t know\nanything, they were uneducated. They didn\u2019t know to read and to write, most of\nthem. It \u2014 and \u2014 because in the feudal system they couldn\u2019t go to school without\npermission to go to school was not given by the noblemen. [indecipherable] want\nthe educated people here, I need workers here. And so, they [indecipherable]\npeople like this, I think, always start trying to find the scapegoat. The scapegoat for\nthat \u2014 you know, it was a good feeling that there is somebody who 1s inferior to\nApril 19, 2009\nthem. And for this they have to show that the Jews are inferior. And if they can kill\nthe Jews, or you know, curse them or show their inferiority, then it gives them the\nsuperiority complex. I think that\u2019s the main reason for [indecipherable] anti-\nSemitism. That\u2019s it. I \u2014",

        "A: You know, if I divide my history, my story into four periods, the fourth period\nwas different. That\u2019s th \u2014 that\u2019s the time when I came to Israel, and for the first\ntime in my life I felt like equal with equals. There was no problem any more. I\nknew that when I go to school, I will not be chased up like in the Polish school\nwhere I remember very well. In mathematics, I\u2019m very good in mathematics. I knew\nit, there was no doubt about it. But always I was given a very low \u2014",
        "Q: Grade.",
        "A: \u2014 grade. And I couldn\u2019t understand it in that \u2014 in the last class when I was, I\nknew that I can get a grade which will not be enough to pass into the next class.",

        "A: And I knew also that the teacher is anti-Semitic. A young woman, anti-Semitic.\nOne day she came, and she said, whoever will \u2014 I\u2019m giving here some exercises to\ndo. Whoever will finish it the first will get a very good grade. A grade of very good.\nAnd she was \u2014 I knew, that\u2019s mine. I filled it out for it, I came much before the\nsecond one, to give it to her. And she didn\u2019t take it, she was sitting there, she didn\u2019t\ntake it, she waited. Then another boy came after me, and she took his. I said, I was\nthe first. No, no, he was the first. What can I do?",
        "Q: Of course not.",
        "A: And this happen \u2014 on the same day she gave another exercise and another\nexercise, and in all of them I was the first one of the whole class, by far, you know.\nAnd then she had no choice, so she gave me good, but not very good. She couldn\u2019t\n\u2014 you know, all this changed, of course. In Israel I was even. And maybe that\u2019s the\nbest. I went to school of medicine, became a doctor, became an ophthalmologist,\nprofessor of ophthalmology, so I could devote a lot to teaching. I became a\nprofessor also here at the University of Illinois, where from time to time I have\nbeen there and I work there. And in [indecipherable] I did many things for\nhumanity, I would say, you know. Like I went to Africa to work two years, with my\nfamily. My wife and the two kids, when they \u2014 Zak, my son, who works here in\nApril 19, 2009\n[indecipherable] he was, at that time, five years old. And the \u2014 I went to work for\ntwo years.",
        "Q: In what country?",
        "A: In Malawi.",
        "Q: In Malawi.",
        "A: Malawi is southeast. And then I came back maybe 10 times to Africa, each time\nfor periods of between three months to one month. And I liked it. It\u2019s only mi \u2014\nmaybe five years ago when I went back to Rwanda to operate, to operate people.\nAnd so there are, at least, 2,000 Africans who are walking around, who are walking\naround there seeing, just because I operated them, you know? So it gives you a\ngood feeling. Maybe that\u2019s the \u2014 the revenge on the Nazis \u2014 Nazis. They not only\ndidn\u2019t succeed to kill you, but also they couldn\u2019t prevent me, you know, doing\nthings for \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 humanity.",
        "Q: Yes. They didn\u2019t take away your humanity.",
        "A: Yes. Didn\u2019t stop me from doing it. I\u2019m in the last nine years. I am in \u2014 a doctor, a\nspecialist in Saint John Eye Hospital, which is an eye hospital in eastern\nJerusalem that serves the Arab population of the West Bank and Gaza. Mainly it\nApril 19, 2009\nserves the Arab population of Jerusalem, but also of all the complicated cases are\nsent over to me. So I see there a lot of complicated cases from the West Bank and\nfrom Gaza as well. And I continue with this, I like it, and \u2014",
        "Q: Do you \u2014 do you have more interaction beyond \u2014 beyond being a doctor to them?\nIs there any way of \u2014 of \u2014I don\u2019t even know how to put the question. Do your\nPalestinian patients get to know you, do you get to know them in some ways?",
        "A: Well, they know me and they like me, I\u2019ve no doubt about it. You cannot get\nthrough a certain level. A couple \u2014 also because of different attitude and different\nway of thinking, you know? It was maybe three or four months ago, where I gave\nan injection into the eye of an Arab patient. It\u2019s a thing which I do a lot, I give at\nleast 10 injections every week. That\u2019s the modern, new way to treat some eye\ndiseases. And I gave him this injection. And he stands up and says, thank you, thank\nyou, thank you, thank you. After four or five times I say to my nurse, look, he\nknows two words in English, thank and you. So tell him to speak Arabic, and you'll\ntranslate for me. So she said all right. And he say something in Arabic, and she\ntranslates it to me. He wants to bless you. And he wants to tell you \u2014 to wish that\nyou will have four wives. So, you know, this was \u2014 so it 1s a different way of\nthinking.",
        "Q: But he means well.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: He means well, I have no doubt. I said they liked me there.",
        "Q: Professor Merin, the last question I have before we end, unless there is\nsomething else that you would like to add to what we have talked about, is that my\nimpression 1s that you didn\u2019t \u2014 you didn't have a chance to really be a child, except\nin very stolen moments, when you were growing up. That you had to grow up and\nbe pretty strong, very early on. That\u2019s my impression. Is that true?",
        "A: That\u2019s certainly very true. I \u2014 in fact, the only thing that \u2014 the only thing that I\nbehaved like a child is the place in \u2014 in \u2014 in the hiding place, there, wa \u2014 how I\nplayed with my sister. And this was all about imaginary things with the \u2014 we put up.\nSo this was one and a half years that we played around with this, lucky, because I\nthink that allowed me to live normally, almost, at least from th-the \u2014 the point of\nview of my soul, you know, about \u2014 which was a chil \u2014 child\u2019s soul at that time, you\nknow, at the \u2014 this was only one and a half years, just at the time when it was the\nworst time for me. You know, li-living without my parents, living in a place like\nthis, in a closed place like this, and living on very poor food. Just in that time, I\nthink I felt a child at that time. Just playing around with all this, and \u2014",
        "Q: In \u2014 in these circumstances \u2014\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: \u2014 I think this was lucky, yes, this was lucky. I think it happened also with the\nother children, who survived at that time, that they \u2014 they survived because they\nplayed the imaginary plays, you know? And this kept them alive.",
        "Q: When you had your own children, did you play with them more because \u2014\nbecause of that? Did you \u2014 did \u2014 was there anything from this entire history that\nshowed up when your children were the same ages that you \u2014",
        "A: I never \u2014 I never made such decisions, but yes, the truth 1s that it was like this.\nYou know, you are all the time \u2014 I was already a doctor. I \u2014 I married when I was a\nstudent, and I was a doctor when I had children already. And in Africa when they\ncame to \u2014 with me to Africa, and there was not a night, unless I was busy in the\nhospital in the evening, was not a now \u2014 a night that I didn\u2019t sit down with them for\nhalf an hour at least, and tell them a story. All imaginary stories, you know. But\nthey still remember it day \u2014 today. My son here, well, I think he told to his children\nalready, some of the stories I was telling them at the time. All right.",

It was a\ncountry that offered survival and reprieve. And the reason I \u2014 I \u2014 I bring this up 1s\nthat just recently there was a Professor Polonsky who was the chair of Judaic\nstudies at Brandeis, gave a presentation where he said, until World War 2, many\nJews believed that about Poland.",

It had a \u2014 between 50 and 60,000 people \u2014 population. And it\nwas similar to so many other places like this. It was in southwest Poland, very close\nto the German border, of more than maybe five miles.",
        "A: Yes, it was, always they were fighting about it. It was in Silesia, Silesia.\nSchilesia in \u2014 in German. And the Germans thought that this is their country. The\nPoles thought that this is their country. Before the war, all of Lower Silesia was\nnext to Germany, and Upper Silesia, most of it belonged to Germany. A small part\nrem-remained Polish.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: That\u2019s right, but really, the majority were Jewish people, in the town itself.",

        "A: We spoke Yiddish. And \u2014 at home, it was Yiddish. I knew, of course, very well,\nPolish. And I knew a little of German, not much. But I learned German during the\nwar, and after the war, as a child.",
        "A: The whole town was poor. Poverty was probably the characteristic finding in\ntown. Poverty among all classes. It was among Germans and among \u2014 among Poles,\nand among the Jewish people. The \u2014 the poverty was manifested by \u2014 by the houses,\nwhich were terrible dwellings. Many of them, there were no washrooms 1n the\nhouse, they have to go out to the courtyard. Sometimes this was seen even in \u2014 in\nhouses which had four floors, and 20 - 30 families lived there. They had to go down\nand \u2014 life was not easy, not nice. Jewish people lived there probably for longer than\nmany other places, because in Bendzin there was a castle, which was built by King\nCasimir. Casimir, or Kazimierz in Polish. Kazimierz the Great. He was the Polish\nking in the 14\" century who united Poland. This is why they called him the Great.\nAfter he united it, usually by fighting, okay, in combat \u2014",

But he was strong; he was the one who ruled at that time, in the 14\ncentury, must have been about 1345. He invited the Jews of Germany to come over\nand live in Poland.

While\nthe Germans, which \u2014 which maybe \u2014 nobody knows how much, but it probably\nwas not less than a quarter of the \u2014 of European population who perished at that\ntime from the disease, from the epidemic, and they possibly wa \u2014 it came up from\n50 percent a \u2014 of the jew \u2014 of the European population.

You see, when\nthe plague broke out, the Germans accused the Jews, that they brought in the\nplague, that they caused the plague, they caused the death of at least one-quarter of\nthe European population, and thousands of Jews were massacred as a \u2014",

And then | heard that, one day a talk between them, and one of them saying\nthat her parents are accusing my parents about what happened. And then I\nunderstood what happened. When she left our house after teaching me, she went\nback to her home. She had to cross a lawn which was on the way, quite a large\nlawn, and when she went through it a German soldier went by and just shot her,\nkilled her on the way. I-I \u2014 I remember, when I heard this, I was shocked by it. First\ntime in my life that I really started to understand what\u2019s going on with the Germans\nin that time.

And the truth 1s that I think they \u2014 they were clever to do it,\nnot to tell me anything, because it certainly frightened me, there\u2019s no doubt about\nthis. But they knew what\u2019s going on in my head, you know. They knew that I live a\n\u2014 in an imaginary world. And all this just kind of doesn\u2019t belong to me, and they\nknew it. And I remember my father saying to me, we\u2019re going down to try to open\nthe sukkah. The sukkah for \u2014 a sukkah.

        "A: He died, and we continued to live. Th-The main problem was how to get away\nfrom the Germans, that they don\u2019t catch you when they go in the streets and catch\nsome Jews to send away. And there were several cases when it was organized. One\nday it was organized this way, that they came to surround our place, all the four\nbuildings. And they took everybody to the police station, or whatever it was, and \u2014\nand they said \u2014 they decided, whatever one of you is going back to his house, or 1s\nApril 19, 2009\nsent over for deportation, as they called it. Deportation was Auschwitz. Auschwitz\nwas not more than about an hour by train from our place. And so, at that time, we\nlearned something. And we learned this, that they \u2014 they are taking away larger\nfamilies, because it\u2019s easier for them. If they have to take, they come over in there\nto bring a thousand Jews, they take larger families, then they do it quicker and it\u2019s\nfor them much easier. We survived this because what happened 1s that a Jewish\npoliceman was there, they were helping the \u2014 the Germans. And they were\npolicemen of the Judenrat. And the Jewish policeman was a distant relative of\nours. So he said, you don\u2019t take \u2014 stay here. Went out and locked the outer lock on\nthe door. So it was clear to everybody who came over there, there is nobody inside,\nthey left already and locked the door.",

        "A: They didn\u2019t. They \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. They cannot \u2014 I don\u2019t have, we never forget, you know, just the two or\nthree evenings before a \u2014 the end of the ghetto, that \u2014 from dinner, we had one egg.\nAnd we were sitting, all four of us, and my father or my mother said look, we\ndiscussed it [indecipherable] between us, and we could divide this egg into four.\nOr another way, one will receive the whole egg, and then when we get another one,\nthe second one, third one and so on. So we decided we go for one, so that he can be\nstronger, and \u2014 and they said, we decided you\u2019|l be the one. And they gave me the\negg. You know, I was eating it [indecipherable] and you know, it looked to me like\nthe delicatess(ph) of the world. And in the middle of eating this, I raised my head, I\nApril 19, 2009\nhave seen the three people, both my parents, and Dina, my sister looking at me with\nhungry eyes. You know, I remember their eyes, you know, like it will be yesterday.\nMaybe this explains more than anything else, the starvation which we went through\nat that time. There was certainly not enough bread, not enough anything, ca \u2014 on the\nbread, you know. Not even all these ersatz, the \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014 that came instead of\ncoffee, like ersatz coffee and ersatz tea and things like this.",
        "A: Yes. But even that \u2014 this we couldn\u2019t get.",

        "A: It couldn\u2019t be. It couldn\u2019t \u2014 it couldn\u2019t happen, it couldn\u2019t be. The-They wou \u2014 th\n\u2014 our way of knowing things was through my mother. We used to go to the\nJudenrat, which was in the second town, just nearby, and to sit with them. The\nhead of the Judenrat was also a me \u2014 a Merin. Probably a \u2014 I don\u2019t know even, he\nwas certainly not a relative of \u2014 a near relative, but maybe he was a distant relative,\nthis could well be. And she was meeting him, and he was telling her about what\u2019s\nApril 19, 2009\ngoing on. Towards the end of July \u201943, she came back home and she said, they am\ngoing to cancel this ghetto. And, you know, my father said, how do you know\u201d?\nWhat happened? She say, I have seen today that the Gestapo took all the members\nof the Judenrat somewhere away, and they \u2014 they didn\u2019t come back. This must me\n\u2014 mean that they send them to Auschwitz. We already knew at that time about\nAuschwitz. Ha \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, at that time they already believed what\u2019s going on there.",
        "A: Yes, this was about \u2014",
        "A: Yes. And this was July \u201943, when they \u2014 July \u00b043 already, it wa \u2014 1t became clear\nwhat\u2019s going on. Still tried to make normal life. I know \u2014 I remember my father,\nwhen we moved into the ghetto, my father tried to build a fence around the small\npiece of land which belonged to this \u2014 to the room which we had, because no Jew\nwas allowed more than one room. So he built this, and I remember somebody\ncoming over and said, are you crazy? They are going to kill off all of us. Why do\nyou do it? Well, it was quite clear. When my mother said it, she said, we cannot\nApril 19, 2009\nstay here. They will cancel this ghetto. And they \u2014 they decided to leave the ghetto,\nand try to escape into the woods.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: At that time, no.",
        "A: There was no connection with the village, there was no way to know. But, we\ndecided to leave, and we decided to leave on a Sunday where they \u2014 there\u2019s less\nguards, fewer guards around the ghetto. So we decided to \u2014 to leave on the first of\nAugust, Sunday, in the morning.",
        "A: 1943.",
        "A: Before, yes. In the evening of the 31\u201c of July, you know, I remember how I went\nto sleep and I put on my clothes and I put them neatly on the chair, I thought, to\nhave tomorrow when we leave [indecipherable] what I decided to take, and they\nwere put down here. In the middle of the night, the Germans came. This wen \u2014\nshouting of the streets, the Germans are coming, the Germans are coming. And\nApril 19, 2009\nJudenrein. Judenrein, they are taking everybody. It\u2019s not that they select people,\nsome to come and some not, they are taking everybody. The same \u2014 so we be \u2014 we\nhad no choice. Now, there were \u2014 it was impossible, because they put heavy guards\naround the ghetto. It was impossible to leave. We went down into what we called\nthe bunker. The bunker, many families arranged some way out, to escape, because,\nif it was not the Judenrein and they were coming and taking, then they took\nanybody whom they found. They \u2014 they didn\u2019t look too much for it, but yes. So we\nwent down into the bunker, and the bunker was a very good one. You had to go\nthrough a \u2014 through a cupboard like this, to move a drawer, and then to open\nanother door like this, and went to go down over a ladder, and into the bunker. Very\ndifficult, nobody could really \u2014 when you open the cupboard, you wouldn\u2019t see\nanything. So we went down. This was prepared for exactly such a case. It was\nprepared for four people. In a short time we found ourselves with 16 other people,\nand you couldn\u2019t say anything, I mean, all our family came, cause they knew that\nour bunker is the best. We stayed there for three days, probably the worst three days\nof my life. It was terrible. It was August, very hot, small place. It was \u2014",
        "A: Of course no toilet, but there was no water in th-there. We didn\u2019t think about it.\nThere was no water. There was no place to sit for everybody, you know? My father,\nApril 19, 2009\nremember, was sitting on the ladder, which was taking down. The thirst was\nterrible. On the third day they understood how it\u2019s done. They came over there and\nthey couldn\u2019t find the entrance into this, so they went down into the basement and\nstarted to break the wall. Soldiers came and start to break the wall. When they did\nit, and they opened the hole, there were my cousin, older than me by three or four\nyears shouted we \u2014 we give in, we don\u2019t \u2014 we give up and we are \u2014 we are going\nout. So the soldier shouted, all right, how do we get in here? So he told him where\nto open it. Started to go out, and they took all of us to the place where we were\nwaiting for the train to Auschwitz. It was terrible three days, really, it\u2019s not only \u2014I\ntried once to go out, and it was quiet, to find water. And they couldn\u2019t, there was no\nwater anywhere, they closed the water, the Germans. So there was no water\nanywhere. I looked [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: It was a ground floor, I \u2014 I\u2014 I heard a cart on the street, so I looked out, and I\nlooked behind it. It was a cart full of dead bodies. I remember the picture of it, was\nterrible.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: Dead, yes, yes. There were so many of them, this I remember. Many, one on the\nother, on the other. But it were terrible three days. And then they were taken to the\nstation, to the train station. It was \u2014 it was not the regular train station, 1t was a\nstation which was made up for Jews, to take up the Jews. And we were waiting\nthere surrounded by the German soldiers. And there my mother told me, you must\nrun away, must run away. So I said, okay. I took my sister with me, and I broke out.\nThere was a fence with \u2014 a wooden fence, so I could break up one place, and being\na slim boy, could easily get through, and my sister was slim as I was. And we went\nthrough it. After a few minutes, when we were there hiding on the other side of the\nfence, I found out that we are in a German military camp.",
        "A: And of course it took another 10 minutes or so, and the soldiers found us. But\nluckily, you know, both of us looked sympathetic, I would say.",
        "A: Kids, and the soldiers didn\u2019t beat us or \u2014 as they would do otherwise, but they\ntook us back, and they send us in. When I came over there I wanted to speak with\nmy mother, but she said. when I was, not yet at her, she said, don\u2019t come to me,\ndon\u2019t come to me, because us there will be, when they see that we are your parents,\nafter you tried to run away. A second time, when we were \u2014 it was close and the \u2014\nApril 19, 2009\nthe train was already coming in, I thought, that\u2019s the last chance that we have, and I\ntried it another time. And th-this time we succeeded. We went by, not far from the\nGerman watchman who was there. He \u2014 he was looking over the street on the other\nside. He didn\u2019t look anybody would walk nearby him, cause he wouldn\u2019t think that\nany Jew would do it. And this was just off the edge, where all the Poles were\ncoming through. So, the only thing I felt was \u2014 my thought was only, how does it\nfeel when the bullet would struck you \u2014 strike you. And so we \u2014 we could get out\nfrom there.",

        "A: Yes. She n\u2014 she never. But once when I was talking about it with the scouts, and\nthen they asked a lot of questions; one of them was, how did you go out your sister,\nhow much did you quarrel, how much did you fight with her and so on? And I said,\nnever. We never quarreled. We never was fighting. Not in that time, and not after\nthis. And that\u2019s true.",
        "A: How right you are. How right you are, you know. That\u2019s exactly so. You know,\nfor the first time in \u2014 in my life, my young life, I felt sorrow about my father, cause\nI felt how much he suffers. And for the first time in my life I came to him, I said,\nlook, if you want to teach me religious stuff, I want you. Just say when, I am\ncoming and learn it. First time.

So we went \u2014 we left this place, and the two of us went to town. And\nI knew about the Polish woman who was the maid in my aunt\u2019s place before the\nwar.",
        "A: Y \u2014I knew her well.\nApril 19, 2009",

        "A: She was single, but her family was in the village. The family certainly did not\nsupport her. One day when I asked her what would your family do if they would\nknow that you keep Jews? So she said they would go to the Gestapo. They would\ngo, she would \u2014 she lived after the war in a \u2014 Italy, and I came to visit her several\ntimes. One day when I came, she was sad.

And suddenly we see a Jeep passing by with a red flag, with the red\narmy. So this was not the \u2014 these were not Germans, but Russians, and for the first\nApril 19, 2009\ntime.

She had the son, the son\nsurvived with her and she really took very good care of \u2014 of me and 1n fact, she\nnever let me feel that I am not her son, or Dina 1s not her daughter.",
        "A: She \u2014 yes. We\u2019re all \u2014 we were three of us there like brothers and sister.",
        "A: No, she moved to another town there, Hoczew, and this was the place where she\nlived before the war, not far from there, a more German town than ours, Bendzin.\nAnd we stayed there. In 1940 \u2014 in 1946, the chief rabbi of Israel, Yitzhak Herzog,\ncame to Poland, and he had an agreement with the Polish government that he can\ntake children up to the age of 14, if they are orphans, they will go with him to\nIsrael, Palestine at that time. And so we joined this train. Went with him, but 1t was\nstuck in Prague, and then we went to Austria, where we had that distant relative of\nthe new husband of my aunt. And they stayed \u2014 w-we stayed there for some time,\ndecided to go back to Poland because you couldn\u2019t move on. And it was a camp of\nthe DPs in Linz. The DP camps were run by the Americans, and by the Joint. So\nthere were Jewish people of the Joint there wh-who were really helping us a lot.\nApril 19, 2009\nAnd the Americans, they were running the places. And it was Bindermichl, and the\nother place in Linz was Wegsheid. Just these days I see in the newspaper a picture\nof Wegsheid, which was not far from there. So, we \u2014 we stayed there and came\nback to [indecipherable]. When \u2014 already in 1945, we understood that our parents\nwill not come back. You know, at the beginning, the first few months, e-every \u2014\neverybody who knocking on the door, maybe they are coming back, or one of them\nis coming back. But towards April or May, it was clear that nobody would come\nback. In fact, I tried to find out what happened with them. I went to Auschwitz,\ncause that time I was 11, I went to Auschwitz with my cousin, tried to look there\nover this, the only thing I could find is in \u2014 in the gas chambers that was written the\nkemar(ph) \u2014 revenge, which they have written with their blood.",
        "A: It was deserted in that time. The-They opened it as a museum much later \u2014",
        "A: But at that time it was just deserted. You could come in, you could go in, look\nwhere \u2014 whatever you want, at wherever you want, and that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what we did.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: I\u2014I wouldn\u2019t know it.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t know itt.",
        "A: Yes, I wouldn\u2019t know it. The Russians came in on the same day, on the 27\" of\nJanuary \u00b045,they came into Auschwitz \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the same day they came into our town.",
        "A: Not too much.",
        "A: Not too much. My cousin left immediately, he had a \u2014 a red \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 banderola(ph) \u2014 armband, like this. And he went down. And I\u2019ve seen the\nsoldiers from the window, I\u2019ve seen soldiers stopping him and talking with him, and\nshouting at him. And then somebody ordering him to take it off, so he took it off.\nApril 19, 2009\nNo, there was not much communication with the Russians. The Russians left\nAuschwitz also, very quickly.",
        "A: Yes, they went on. This was the south, I believe, to Berlin, where Zhukov and\nhis army was more to the north.",
        "A: This was a southern army that moved out. The Poles didn\u2019t behave too well after\nthe war, you know. I remember first time that I really went out, to the square of the\ncity center, pole \u2014 position where a man stood at one of the windows and gave a\nspeech about new Poland, and the communist Poland. They called it the socialist\nparty, and the socialist Poland. And they said that the Russian promised that if they\nwill behave really like true communists, they will change the name of the party\nfrom the socialist part of Poland to the communist party of Poland. Very like today\nthat they say that. And I was standing there listening to him, together with\nthousands of Poles, when the woman said to me, you are Jewish? I said yes. She\nsaid, how do you survive? So I told her, a Polish woman helped us. She said oh\nGod, she said, oh God. And a boy much older than I was, you know, heard it from\n[indecipherable] what Jew, you are a Jew? Ga \u2014 gave me a fist in my head, in my\nface. And you know, to me, then I understood that they don\u2019t like us too much. I\nApril 19, 2009\ncouldn\u2019t find a \u2014 a barber to \u2014 to make my head, which looked terrible, of course,\nafter all these years. Nobody wanted to take me, when he understood that I am\nJewish, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yeah. It was not nice. You know, at that time it was really \u2014 later on \u2014 I\nwent to Poland again. I left in 1949 for Israel, when \u2014 when it was allowed, when\nthe Polish government allowed the people to go out to Israel, only to Israel. But\nmany years later I\u2019ve been in Poland, just like eight or 10 years ago. So now they\naccepted me, now in a different way, because I came, they knew at the time a\nprofessor of ophthalmology and I immediately also invited a Polish ophthalmologist\nto come to Israel and I will help him for a couple of weeks to see the country, but\nmaybe to learn about ophthalmology in Israel. And they were very happy about it.\nMade a dinner for me and so this was very nice. And I tried to think all the time, is\nthere still anti-Semitism in Poland? And you know what? It changed completely. It\nbecame ridiculous. It\u2019s not that there is no anti-Semitism, but it\u2019s an anti-Semitism\nof \u2014 of a ridiculous sort. You could only laugh at it, you know? I remember my \u2014 a\n\u2014a cousin of mine in Israel went to the town, to Bendzin, and he took pictures,\nvideo pictures, he had a \u2014 a team which [indecipherable] for him. And then he\nApril 19, 2009\nasked people, he went to the school. The school exists, but it\u2019s not called\nFurstenberg.",
        "A: Fursten(ph) was killed by the Germans, like anybody else. It was \u2014 you know,\nthey didn\u2019t kill people because they were poor or rich, they killed people because\nthey were Jewish. He was Jewish, that was enough. He spoke at the school. They\nasked him to speak, which \u2014 so he spoke with them, and si \u2014 before I start my talk,\nwho knows what was the name of the school before the war? Not one of them\nknew. Said, did you hear the name of Furstenberg? Not one of them knew. So he\ntold them the history of the school and about. Then he went into a place that looked\nvery similar to our house. So it\u2019s three buildings around a large courtyard. It was in\nanother part of the city. I knew that there were two places like this. Ours was\ndestroyed later, cause they put the \u2014 a road there. They built a road there. And the\nother place, he went there. And in both places there were Jewish \u2014 there only Jewish\npeople living. And he went around, first in the main street of the city and asked\npeople, remember the Jews who lived here? Nobody know. He went into this house,\nwhere only Jews lived, in all of the three buildings. And when they came out and\nthey were standing around him, and he says to them, remember the Jews who lived\nhere? Not one. You look at the people, he took pictures. Old people that certainly\nApril 19, 2009\nlived there, you know, in the second World War. Nobody remembers. Then a dog\npassed by, and he looks at the dog, and the woman sticks out her head from one of\nthe windows and calls, Aaron, Aaron. So he says to her, that\u2019s the name of the\ndog\u2019? She says yes. Why Aaron? So she says, Aaron, that\u2019s so that we remember\nthe Jews who lived here. This was the first time that he found somebody who\nremembered the Jews, you know, through the dog. This is ridiculous. That\u2019s not the\nsame anti-Semitism that frightened my parents and the Jews before the war, or even\nafter the war, in the first years after the war. It \u2014 1t was just same like before the\nwar, in Kielce, the pogrom in Kielce where more than 40 Jews were killed in 1946.",
        "A: You know, I\u2019m not sure that I tried to think even about it. It certainly changed,\nthere\u2019s no \u2014 today, it stopped at \u2014 it\u2019s something on a personal level, it\u2019s not \u2014\ncertainly not that [indecipherable] of a country.",
        "A: That they could not trust?\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: Well, may \u2014 may well be like this, yes. That \u2014 that I couldn\u2019t trust everything\nthat was said to me. You know, after I invited the ophthalmologist, I got maybe\nthree or four calls from the mayors of the townships of \u2014 which belonged to this\narea, and they were all at the dinner, five mayors, cause these were the places where\nJews \u2014 Jewish people lived around, including Sztemaszitsa(ph), the \u2014 the village of\nmy mother. And after I left, and I left the invitation for one of the [indecipherable]\nfrom Dombrowa, one of the fi \u2014 five townships. I got later maybe three or four\ncalls from the mayors. Look, maybe you take them for three weeks instead of two\nweeks. And another one calls me, maybe you know, I have somebody else who may\nbe better, maybe we\u2019ll take two ones, you know. [indecipherable] the Poles, one\nmust understand it. I don\u2019t know if you read the book, it was Michener, was\n[indecipherable] Poland.",
        "A: You know, when you read it, you \u2014 you read the history of a tragedy. The Poles\nsuffered always, from the beginning. The Jews suffered more, but it was a tragedy\nfor the Poles, what was going on there. The Swedes attacked them, I think it was the\n17\" century, 17\" or 18\", I believe 17 century, and massacred the Poles. You know,\nthey killed thousands, thousands of Poles. And if it wasn\u2019t the Swedes, then it was\nthe Russians or the Germans, the Prussians, you know, all of the time. They\nApril 19, 2009\nsuffered a lot. And on the \u2014 on the personal level, they suffered from the system, it\nwas a feudal system. Why are there so many Polish jokes, the Polack jokes in \u2014 in \u2014\nin the United States, you know, because they came when the [indecipherable] was\n\u2014 was annihilated at the beginning of the 20\" century, after the second World War,\nthe end of the second World War, suddenly they could trave \u2014 they could g \u2014 and\nmany of them traveled to the United States, they had relatives here or so \u2014 they\ncame over here, most of them settled in Chicago, and it\u2019s not only they didn\u2019t know\nEnglish, cause Ukraines also didn\u2019t know English when they came over, and \u2014",
        "A: Yes, first war.",
        "A: Did I say second? No, first World War. And the Ukraines when they came over,\nthey also didn\u2019t know English. They didn't know English, but they didn\u2019t know\nanything, they were uneducated. They didn\u2019t know to read and to write, most of\nthem. It \u2014 and \u2014 because in the feudal system they couldn\u2019t go to school without\npermission to go to school was not given by the noblemen. [indecipherable] want\nthe educated people here, I need workers here. And so, they [indecipherable]\npeople like this, I think, always start trying to find the scapegoat. The scapegoat for\nthat \u2014 you know, it was a good feeling that there is somebody who 1s inferior to\nApril 19, 2009\nthem. And for this they have to show that the Jews are inferior. And if they can kill\nthe Jews, or you know, curse them or show their inferiority, then it gives them the\nsuperiority complex. I think that\u2019s the main reason for [indecipherable] anti-\nSemitism. That\u2019s it. I \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 I have five minutes more? No.",
        "A: You know, if I divide my history, my story into four periods, the fourth period\nwas different. That\u2019s th \u2014 that\u2019s the time when I came to Israel, and for the first\ntime in my life I felt like equal with equals. There was no problem any more. I\nknew that when I go to school, I will not be chased up like in the Polish school\nwhere I remember very well. In mathematics, I\u2019m very good in mathematics. I knew\nit, there was no doubt about it. But always I was given a very low \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 grade. And I couldn\u2019t understand it in that \u2014 in the last class when I was, I\nknew that I can get a grade which will not be enough to pass into the next class.",
        "A: Postwar, 1949, before I left.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: And I knew also that the teacher is anti-Semitic. A young woman, anti-Semitic.\nOne day she came, and she said, whoever will \u2014 I\u2019m giving here some exercises to\ndo. Whoever will finish it the first will get a very good grade. A grade of very good.\nAnd she was \u2014 I knew, that\u2019s mine. I filled it out for it, I came much before the\nsecond one, to give it to her. And she didn\u2019t take it, she was sitting there, she didn\u2019t\ntake it, she waited. Then another boy came after me, and she took his. I said, I was\nthe first. No, no, he was the first. What can I do?",
        "A: And this happen \u2014 on the same day she gave another exercise and another\nexercise, and in all of them I was the first one of the whole class, by far, you know.\nAnd then she had no choice, so she gave me good, but not very good. She couldn\u2019t\n\u2014 you know, all this changed, of course. In Israel I was even. And maybe that\u2019s the\nbest. I went to school of medicine, became a doctor, became an ophthalmologist,\nprofessor of ophthalmology, so I could devote a lot to teaching. I became a\nprofessor also here at the University of Illinois, where from time to time I have\nbeen there and I work there. And in [indecipherable] I did many things for\nhumanity, I would say, you know. Like I went to Africa to work two years, with my\nfamily. My wife and the two kids, when they \u2014 Zak, my son, who works here in\nApril 19, 2009\n[indecipherable] he was, at that time, five years old. And the \u2014 I went to work for\ntwo years.",
        "A: In Malawi.",
        "A: Malawi is southeast. And then I came back maybe 10 times to Africa, each time\nfor periods of between three months to one month. And I liked it. It\u2019s only mi \u2014\nmaybe five years ago when I went back to Rwanda to operate, to operate people.\nAnd so there are, at least, 2,000 Africans who are walking around, who are walking\naround there seeing, just because I operated them, you know? So it gives you a\ngood feeling. Maybe that\u2019s the \u2014 the revenge on the Nazis \u2014 Nazis. They not only\ndidn\u2019t succeed to kill you, but also they couldn\u2019t prevent me, you know, doing\nthings for \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 humanity.",
        "A: Yes. Didn\u2019t stop me from doing it. I\u2019m in the last nine years. I am in \u2014 a doctor, a\nspecialist in Saint John Eye Hospital, which is an eye hospital in eastern\nJerusalem that serves the Arab population of the West Bank and Gaza. Mainly it\nApril 19, 2009\nserves the Arab population of Jerusalem, but also of all the complicated cases are\nsent over to me. So I see there a lot of complicated cases from the West Bank and\nfrom Gaza as well. And I continue with this, I like it, and \u2014",
        "A: Well, they know me and they like me, I\u2019ve no doubt about it. You cannot get\nthrough a certain level. A couple \u2014 also because of different attitude and different\nway of thinking, you know? It was maybe three or four months ago, where I gave\nan injection into the eye of an Arab patient. It\u2019s a thing which I do a lot, I give at\nleast 10 injections every week. That\u2019s the modern, new way to treat some eye\ndiseases. And I gave him this injection. And he stands up and says, thank you, thank\nyou, thank you, thank you. After four or five times I say to my nurse, look, he\nknows two words in English, thank and you. So tell him to speak Arabic, and you'll\ntranslate for me. So she said all right. And he say something in Arabic, and she\ntranslates it to me. He wants to bless you. And he wants to tell you \u2014 to wish that\nyou will have four wives. So, you know, this was \u2014 so it 1s a different way of\nthinking.\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: He means well, I have no doubt. I said they liked me there.",
        "A: That\u2019s certainly very true. I \u2014 in fact, the only thing that \u2014 the only thing that I\nbehaved like a child is the place in \u2014 in \u2014 in the hiding place, there, wa \u2014 how I\nplayed with my sister. And this was all about imaginary things with the \u2014 we put up.\nSo this was one and a half years that we played around with this, lucky, because I\nthink that allowed me to live normally, almost, at least from th-the \u2014 the point of\nview of my soul, you know, about \u2014 which was a chil \u2014 child\u2019s soul at that time, you\nknow, at the \u2014 this was only one and a half years, just at the time when it was the\nworst time for me. You know, li-living without my parents, living in a place like\nthis, in a closed place like this, and living on very poor food. Just in that time, I\nthink I felt a child at that time. Just playing around with all this, and \u2014\nApril 19, 2009",
        "A: \u2014 I think this was lucky, yes, this was lucky. I think it happened also with the\nother children, who survived at that time, that they \u2014 they survived because they\nplayed the imaginary plays, you know? And this kept them alive.",
        "A: I never \u2014 I never made such decisions, but yes, the truth 1s that it was like this.\nYou know, you are all the time \u2014 I was already a doctor. I \u2014 I married when I was a\nstudent, and I was a doctor when I had children already. And in Africa when they\ncame to \u2014 with me to Africa, and there was not a night, unless I was busy in the\nhospital in the evening, was not a now \u2014 a night that I didn\u2019t sit down with them for\nhalf an hour at least, and tell them a story. All imaginary stories, you know. But\nthey still remember it day \u2014 today. My son here, well, I think he told to his children\nalready, some of the stories I was telling them at the time.
