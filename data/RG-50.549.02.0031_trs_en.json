So if it\u2019s\ngoing in a direction that you think 1s less important and you have something else you\u2019d\nlike to talk about, or just something you don\u2019t want to talk about, then just let me know,\nwe'll just go to [indecipherable] thing.\nSL: Okay.",
        "Q: Some of the questions I have for you are just some questions that I had that weren\u2019t\nfully explained in the video, and then I have other questions that we\u2019 ll start after -- after\nyou left Buchenwald. O-One of the questions that I had was -- was, could you describe\nfor me again, your perception of the -- the relationship between Jews and Gentiles in\nKovno when you were very young?\nSL: Before the war, you\u2019re talking?",
        "Q: Yes, before the war, mm-hm.\nSL: Well, before the war, the relation between the Jews and the Gentiles was very good.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nSL: I mean, they didn\u2019t show no anti-Semitism, right. And never make -- like we had ra\n-- Gentiles working for us, right? They were the finest pe-people you ever met. Even I\nused to play with the Gentiles, they was never say, hey you dirty Jew or things like that.\nEverything was friendly, except one -- we used to have a boy that used to take care on\nour property where we lived. He used to be a janitor. And when Hitler start to come in\npower, you know, and he used to listen to the radio, and he be -- this guy became very",
        "Q: Mm.\nSL: Bec -- They became so anti-Semitic after that, 1t was just unbelievable. I guess ma-\nmaybe because they didn\u2019t like the Russians, because the Russian depressed them. So\nmaybe because of that, but they were such a -- so anti-Semitic, they were worse than the\nGermans.",
        "Q: I -- I know this 1s something you can\u2019t really answer, but how do you explain that?\nHow do you explain that sort of general getting along and then this in-incredible\nbetrayal?\nSL: I don\u2019t know. Maybe it could have been jealously, because the Jewish people in\nLithuania were we -- we -- pretty well off. And we -- we had the -- in -- in Lithuania --",
        "Q: Yeah.\nSL: And -- And the Jew didn\u2019t -- I mean, they used -- they even used to speak Yiddish\nin -- advertisement in the street used to be in -- in -- in Yiddish. We used to have\nYeshivas there and we -- we had the very sh -- very famous Yeshiva in Slobotka was\nve-very famous. And I guess maybe it was jealousy. And I guess when the Germans\ncame in and they were -- they were the -- they were depressed into the Russians and the\nJews owned -- owned a lot of things, the chance to take everything away from the Jews.\nMaybe that\u2019s where they turned. Because -- Because the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the\nEstonians and the Ukrainians, they were worse than Nazis. They were -- All the killing,\nactually, was done by them. Very few Germans that -- that did the killing. All the dirty\nwork was done by them. Even be -- When the -- When the Germans came in and all the\npogroms was done by the Lithuanians. The Germans din -- We were come -- We were\nra -- We ran away, you know, when the bobocart, and we start to run towards the\nGerman -- to the Russian border. And what happen, there were a lot of bombardments\non the road and we were going by horse and wagon, you know, and the Germans were\nmechanized and next day they passed us already. So we stopped in a small town, I don\u2019t\nremember the name of it, and you know, they told us that we have to back where we\ncame from. And while we were going back, on the roads, the Germans stopped us and\nask us where are we going. So we told them we\u2019re going back to Kovno. So they told",
        "Q: An-And how do you explain this message from the Germans? Why did they -- Why\ndid they do that for you?\nSL: They won\u2019t -- I tell you, they di -- all those killings, that they weren\u2019t that bad in the\nbeginning of the war. The mass killing started in 19 four -- in -- in -- late in \u201841. That\u2019s\nwhen the mass killings started, and actually, the-they started -- the --the -- all the\nkillings were in -- 1n the -- in the Kovno ghetto in Lithuania. They we --the -- that\u2019s\nwhere all the experimentals -- the killings started.",
        "Q: What -- What were these experiments?\nSL: Well, to see how the -- how they used to gather all the Jews and they used to get\nthem in certain places and just shoot them. Because, I have a book about it, you know,\nand -- and that\u2019s where -- that\u2019s where they -- they claim that most experimental killing\nstarted in Lithuania.",

        "Q: Was it to figure out that -- most efficient way to kill people?",
        "Q: While you were there?\nSL: Yeah. I was in the -- there was only -- there was only -- there was only about 5,000\nJews, from the Kovno Jews, Lithuanian Jews that survived the war. Out of -- Out of\nalmost a quarter of a million Jews. And that included the -- the -- the ones that ran away\nto Russia.

You take\nas -- this side and you -- you -- if you were on the left you were safe, on the right you\nwent to death. That day, out of 40 -- 42,000 people, one ti -- one quarter of the people\nwent to the -- it\u2019s called a nightfort, and that was the killing ground.

See, what happ -- the thing 1s, I didn\u2019t like to work inside. I didn\u2019t want to\nbe cooped up. Maybe because from the -- all the time I was in concentration camp, I\ndidn\u2019t like to be cooped up. I wanted to be always outside. So like -- like I felt -- like if -\n- if I have to run away, it\u2019s open, I could run, see? Once you work inside, I mean, you\nfeel like you\u2019re locked in. There\u2019s no place where to run.

He says, \u201cThat\u2019ll help you.\u201d But instead of\nhelping me, made it worse, because it cut the circulation altogether.

        "Q: Mm.\nSL: Bec -- They became so anti-Semitic after that, 1t was just unbelievable. I guess ma-\nmaybe because they didn\u2019t like the Russians, because the Russian depressed them. So\nmaybe because of that, but they were such a -- so anti-Semitic, they were worse than the\nGermans.",

We used to have\nYeshivas there and we -- we had the very sh -- very famous Yeshiva in Slobotka was\nve-very famous. And I guess maybe it was jealousy. And I guess when the Germans\ncame in and they were -- they were the -- they were depressed into the Russians and the\nJews owned -- owned a lot of things, the chance to take everything away from the Jews.\nMaybe that\u2019s where they turned. Because -- Because the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the\nEstonians and the Ukrainians, they were worse than Nazis. They were -- All the killing,\nactually, was done by them.

And what happen, there were a lot of bombardments\non the road and we were going by horse and wagon, you know, and the Germans were\nmechanized and next day they passed us already. So we stopped in a small town, I don\u2019t\nremember the name of it, and you know, they told us that we have to back where we\ncame from.

        "Q: Yeah.\nSL: Because my -- my aunt -- my cousins were telling me. That was many years ago. I\ndidn\u2019t know when -- when she died, see? But my aunt and my cousin, they were in the\nsame camp. Then they were in Stutthof, and what happened, we\u2019re -- had a cousin that\nwas sick, some -- and they were liquidating the camp. So my -- my -- my -- my mother\nsays, \u201cI\u2019m going with -- with -- with -- with my niece.\u201d So my Aunt Hannah was\n[indecipherable], and my cousin Edka. Says, \u201cBazil, come with us. Leave her, she\u2019s\nsick.\u201d She says, \u201cI can\u2019t leave her alone.\u201d And she wouldn\u2019t leave her alone. Now, my\naunt and my cousin survived.",

        "Q: Mm-hm.\nSL: And they -- I -- I -- I understand they drown them in the -- and they drowned them.\nThey sunk the boat. They put them all on the boat and they drowned them. Listen, my\nmother was a wonderful woman. She gave her life to be with her niece.",

And then there were -- I\ndidn\u2019t want to go back to Russia, ma -- I knew before the war how they were and after\nthe war, they were worse yet. So I didn\u2019t want to go back to Russia. And first of all, I\ndidn\u2019t know if -- if I come to -- to Kovno, I know da -- what would it be, because in\nRussia you never knew. You could be in one place here and next day the-they -- they\nshipped you to Siberia. Here, I know where I was. And listen, I was very independent\nalready, I could take care of myself. I guess it\u2019s -- it\u2019s fate, 1t\u2019s destiny, it\u2019s meant to be,\nit\u2019s meant to be that way.",
        "Q: But I guess what -- what you -- 1s it accurate to say that this is two different reactions\nto the murders that you saw and that you knew how murderous the Russians could be,\nthat your father and brother wanted to go back for some reason and you didn\u2019t want to\ngo back.\nSL: Well, they wanted to go for a certain purpose. My brother and sister, they wanted to\ngo look for my mother",

If I wouldn\u2019t a known what was going on in\nRussia, I might have gone back. But I knew what was going on there. And I tell you,\nwhen you went -- you go through a war like that, you become very selfish, too. You\nbecome very cold. Don\u2019t know wh -- you look out it -- for yourself. It\u2019s like an animal,\nsurvival. So if -- You\u2019re not attached no more. The feeling 1s not there no more.",

And the only way to\nsurvive, you have to do -- it\u2019s something to look forward to, which is why -- once you\ngive up, that\u2019s it, right? So, if you make a goal in your -- in your own mind, I\u2019m going\nto accomplish this, right? And -- And -- And -- And that\u2019s when it -- that was my goal. I\nwant to survive so badly and I made my goal that I\u2019m going to outlive Hitler. And that\u2019s\nwhat kept me going.",

To have a goal like that, where that --\nSL: The goal was very important, because if you haven\u2019t got a goal, and you don\u2019t set\nyour mind on something, you\u2019re not going to do it.

She thought I was kidding\naround.",
        "Q: How important was it to you to become an American citizen?\nSL: Very important, I didn\u2019t have to go to the army, but I went, because when I came to\nthis country and I saw what the -- I know what the country did for me, the way I was\ntreated. I had freedom, I could say anything I want, right? And I want to fight for this\ncountry, to preserve the -- [indecipherable] the freedom.

But the thing is,\nyou see, we were brought up to respect people and -- and to help people. And that\u2019s the\nway I was brought up and it stays -- it -- 1t stayed with me, see, because they -- they got\nin this country, right? I mean, they come from a bad environment, that\u2019s why the\nchildren are bad. There\u2019s no such a thing. It\u2019s the house. It\u2019s what the parents teach\nchildren.

He says, \u201cThat\u2019ll help you.\u201d But instead of\nhelping me, made it worse, because it cut the circulation altogether.
