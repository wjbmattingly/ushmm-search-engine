        "Q: Your early school experiences.",
        "A: Yes, I attend to the public school in Arrokoveetsaplatz. You know, was a regular public\nschool, and later was a problem, because my father decided that we have two good\nfriends. One was German, another Russian. And he thought that from his experience, he\nsurvived during the war first, because he know perfect Russian language. He told me that\nif I would like to survive, probably would be the wa-war not in five, then in three -- in\nfive, in 10 years. You know, we\u2019re talking about nine -- the early 30 years. Then I have to\nattend to the gi -- gimnasium, in which I would be learned perfect one of these languages,\nRussian, or German. And he asked me which one I would like to selected. I decided that I\nwould like to speak German. There is on the [indecipherable] to the gimnasium\n[indecipherable] what was next to the Augsburg Evangelist Church, to which belonged\nmost of the German people. The German people which -- it was a Polish people, but with\nthe German background, and these people speak most time -- the kids speak most time in\nhome, German. That\u2019s mean the German languages were very, very high level. I was a\nvery poor student, very, really poor, you know, compared with the kids who would speak\nhome every day, German -- that I have every year a tutor. The tutor was this way, that\nusually my parents, and parents of another my friend -- I remember Yashu Nashuroski,\nyou know, rent the room someplace in vacation place, and come there tutor from\nGermany. Usually every year was a tutor from different part of Germany, and we speak\nduring this one month, almost two months, only German. That\u2019s mean, if we s -- we\ncannot speak one word -- one to each one other Polish, because he immediately beat us,\nbecause he expect we were talking something wrong against him, because he do not\nunderstand. And this way, when the German come, I speak fluently German. All the --\nalmost the same German went -- when the Polish. And additional I know, because the\ntutors were from different parts of Germany every year, that I know different slang, and\ndifferent -- different accent, because one was from one da -- one year were from Berlin,\nthe \u2018nother day was from Vien-Vienna, the \u2018nother year from Hamburg, that I speak\nHaplardeutsch, and Howdeutsch, and gin accent.",
        "Q: So --",

        "Q: So when the war began, you were able to converse in German?",
        "A: That -- I can -- I can speak fluently German.",
        "Q: So now let\u2019s go back to the time when the war began. Can you tell us a little bit about\nwhere you were, and what your reactions were, what you were doing?",
        "A: Before the war?",
        "Q: Just at the time --",
        "A: Just before the war. You know, before the war I attend, in 19 -- the year 1938 -- \u201839, I\nwas attend to the last year, to the gimnasium, because folsee -- the education was four\nyears in gimnasium, and was in mas -- last year. This year, I attend -- I have one class\nlike a -- they teach us -- they train us th -- something about the army. That\u2019s mean we\nhave training with -- like what\u2019s in the army. That\u2019s mean that the -- when German come,\nwe have a special uniform, you know, like a student uniform grim, looks something like a\nskulls -- like was most adverse like skulls. And when the German co -- before -- when the\nwar start in 1939, in September first, when the German attacked Poland, that I start\nworking for the organization which take care about fire and houses in -- in Warsaw. I was\nin -- very lucky, because I was 16 years [indecipherable] in June, and additional I can\ndrive. I can drive motorcycle, and I can drive car. What this time was something you\nknow, like special knowledge, this was, you know, like high education, this knowledge,\nthat when the -- the -- th -- the war start, I get fr-from this organization the motorcycle,\nand I was a line officer, you know, just delivered information. And a few days later, when\nthe German come close to the Warsaw -- and Warsaw was, you know -- Warsaw was on\nthe -- all side of the Warsaw was the German army. Then, was no water that the army --\nthe army give me a truck, they -- a soldier make on that truck -- put the big barrels, they\npump the water, and I drive this water from the -- from the hospital when they -- wh-\nwhere was that water place, you know, go to the bakery for they make bread for the army,\nthat during the night I pull water -- drive the water. During the day I delivered documents\nfrom the -- for the army, you know that I was very busy this time.

They grab this, you know, a lot which Ill grab this and throw away on the\nstreet, and the kids who on the street put with the sont, cover this.",

        "A: When war began?",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: No, during the -- this was -- this was an organization -- aha -- this was organization, but\nthis was like a public organization, they call -- I don\u2019t -- difficult to translate it, it was\naupahelle. This was organization against the -- like a self defense of the -- of the bombing\nof the fire -- you know, for the -- for the German.",
        "Q: How long did you remain in the self defense?",
        "A: This was -- this was from the first day -- no, from the first day of the war, to the day what\nwas Warsaw, you know, capital, you know, surrendered. It was like one month -- no --\napproximately one month, maybe a little bit less.",
        "Q: And then where were you?",
        "A: Pardon me? And later was -- you know, was --",
        "Q: Well, what happened to you at the time when Warsaw surrendered?",
        "A: When the Warsaw surrendered, this 1s -- 1t was -- did nothing, was few weeks we\u2019re with\nnothing, because it was completely disaster. I used to try to work in ki -- this time in the -\n- like voluntary in different organization. That\u2019s mean we have two people -- bread, you\nknow, daily bread, the breadmaker, breadmaker -- food, because was completely disaster.\nThis was -- was like almost the fu -- two or three weeks. Later, they opened the schools,\nbut they opened the schools for the Polish children only, for the technical school. That\u2019s\nmean it was not like a grammar school, it was not the gimnasium, only was technical\nschool. And I attend -- start attending to the school which was the mainin -- mechanical\nschool, because I finished this full class gimnasium, and then I attend to this school, it\nwas in Gorsky. This was a very famous gimnasium, Gorsky in Warsaw, and in this\ngimnasium they opened like -- it was not the school like a training for the -- techni -- for\nthe mechanics. I attend to this school to one year, maybe one and a half, and German\nclosed the school, because they find the school 1s not only the training the -- the\nmechanic, but the same time they train the underground terrorists, you know, they closed\nthe school. They opened another school, which I started and was another mechanical\nschool. It was in Mokotof, the different parts of the town. This school I attend I think one\nyear that -- anyway, I finish, I was get a diploma from this school. And in the meantime\nthey opened a -- a polytechnic institute they call herateknisha fakshula, in German. This\nmean the school with the highest -- highest education like a -- they call betripinjinids.\nThat\u2019s mean the -- like a high level technician.",
        "Q: And how long did you stay [indecipherable]",
        "A: And this -- this school I stayed -- this is what I have documents in there, I document --\nthis school I think I attend one and a half year, because at ex -- started the uprising there,\nand a -- August first was uprising. This August? Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: June, July, yes, sorry. Uprising -- the school was ot -- not open any more.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s go back a little bit to think about when you found yourself working with the\nunderground army --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes. In 1939, in th -- December, I remember this exactly, in December, they -- I met a\nfriends which have connection with the -- like a main organization they call zetfouzet.\nThis was the like organiza-organization which supposed to fight with the arms against the\noccupation. I had -- I have a fr -- met a friend, and he thought, listen we start organize, I\nalready have connection, organization will be five. This mean we have to have five guys\nwho have to -- fi -- five more. Four guys, they will be together five. Because this was\norganization, they would be very difficult to discover by the German. That\u2019s mean if the\nGerman find -- they all will find one guy and one small group, no more. Will be no\nconnection between the group -- was completely no connection. You know, was this\nsystem of the organization. And this start in th-the -- exactly I remember was December\nthirti -- 1939. And in the beginning was training, that\u2019s mean we have to know how use\nthe guns. We already have guns, because during the ja -- the war, I hired few different\nguns, and I hired few different radiopera. The German -- because German, when come,\nthey take all radiopera, you have to bring to the German, they destroy. I hide at this time -\n- the people get that I hide, you know, on different places, usually on the attics, in the\nbasement. In the basement was a big hole in the wall. In the wall I remember that I put\nthe cover with the -- with the rubber, with the fabrics, you know, because was no plastic\nthis time, and [indecipherable] I put, you know, wall, and I covered this. Then, when we\nstart going to [indecipherable] then we start learning how using the -- the arms, and how -\n- we Start using the radio, listen the BBC, because BBC was in the Polish language, all\ninformation. And additional, we tried to organize, you know, and learn. In meantime, we\nget from the alliance, I think it was a little bit later, the name of the organization changed.\nI think was maybe in 1940 or \u201c41, we started to get the arms and material from the sky,\nyou know, from the alliance. And then, because I was mechanic, I was very, you know,\nwas very good working my hands, that I start learn from this book what they sent from\nthe -- England, usually, they drop off, you know, about the mine. That\u2019s mean I know\nhow make the mines to blow up the bridges, how blow the trains, and then I was expert\nfor this. And this was the -- all the -- the action they call tashma -- tashma, this mean the\n[indecipherable] one, you know, that\u2019s the same time was blow the train in many places,\nusually the train with the supply to the east front of the oolopsageta. Oolopsageta was a\ntrain which bring the German from the east front for vacation. Vacation train they call\noolopsoogen. They would blow up this -- this oolopsoogen. Yes?",
        "Q: What was your role in this process?",
        "A: In this process, you know, because I was very fast in making mines, installed the mines\non the train, that I was like a miner, you know? Usually the people stay in the back of me,\nthey care about me, and I built, and I installed this equipment, and this material to blow\nup the trains, mostly we did many, many this action. The problem was usually to deliver\nit, the material, because this time the material was -- they call it troten, I don\u2019t know, they\nnamed it troten, was -- looks like a -- you probably remember many, many years ago, the\nsoap was in the bar, approximately one foot long, like a two inches time two inches core.\nThis to -- looks like a -- this material looks approximately like this bar of soaps. And to\nuse this material [indecipherable] soap, you know, the material you need lot. Not like\nnow when you can use a few pounds, this was not, we have to like 10 - 20 pounds. We\nhave to transport this material, sometimes from Warsaw. Outside the Warsaw was\nproblem, because in that train, that German you make -- checking everything. They check\n-- their people check documents, they\u2019re using counterfeit documents, and this material,\nusually we have connection with the train man, you know, was because this time most\npeople belong to this different organization. We don\u2019t know one -- each other, but we get\nthis, and they help us to transport this. When we go to the same place, we have usually\nthere somebody from the local place, who get us -- was a guide for the place, and the\nguide let her disappear. She was not involved, you know. This required that not people\ntry don\u2019t know one each other too good, because if they catch one guy, it\u2019s better if he\ndon\u2019t know too much.",
        "Q: When you found yourself in this informal army activity of destroying trains, was this\nwhen you were also part of the AK, or was this earlier than that?",
        "A: This was -- this was -- the name of the AK changed, because first was zed vouset, then\nlater was different names of this organization. Before it was AK, they call -- the AK have\ndifferent names. I don\u2019t know -- is difficult to translate it. It was deska broda 69. It was\nthe name of organization. Deska, this mean bort. Broda -- you know broda. This was like\na bed, was a synonym for this organization, but this was always the same. They call lar --\nverka de versia. This mean large -- big diversion, right? Because was a small diversion, a\nbig diversion. Because additional what we did, because I was a little bit older, and this\ntime you know, 17 - 18 years old, because 16, I finish in June 19 -- 1939, that\u2019s -- we\ntrained the young kids from the scouts. We bring him the gun for the meetings and train\nhim into -- was usually no more like five guys, you know, because was a rule, you know?\nAnd t -- we bring guns, and explain him how you say gun, how clean, how open, how\nloading. If they stuck, how release, you know, because was very important.",
        "Q: Okay, so --",
        "A: And because guns we have different, because we have Polish guns, we have guns, we\nhave guns which we get from the England -- 1t was -- some was American, and some was\nEnglish, Sten, and tommy gun, Thompson, and Colt was -- lot of different, that you have\nto be -- when I be -- because I was mechanic, this for me was very, very simple, very\neasy.",
        "Q: Okay, so during *41, this is what you were doing. In \u201842, the same?",
        "A: The same, \u201841, \u201842. What else we did additional. We release -- we clean -- we call the\nclean the apartments. What that\u2019s mean? For instance, you belong to the organization,\nand you was -- the Gestapo arrest you. But in your house was a lot of hiding places we\nknow about, in the floor, in the wall, you know, in the furnitures, some documents, some\ninformation, some ti -- with the cords for the radio, you know, many important\ndocuments. This guy was arrested, and then they arrested the people, but Gestapo still\nwatching for this house, and watching who is coming to this apartment, they would like\nto arrest him. That our job was cla -- come and take everything from this apartment, what\nwas less -- left of it. We usually -- somebody know what is there -- make the -- you\nknow, a place was hiding. Usually wa -- it was -- was in the ba -- in the floor. You have\nto use a special knife, stick in the hole, and slip and this spring open, you open, and can\nremove this. That\u2019s mean we have to clean this. Usually this can equal very -- pretty\ndangerous, because the German -- few people are watching for this Gestapo, and we have\nto come and take -- come in that room and clean everything. We fight -- sometime was\nfighting. I remember once we have bitte -- big -- very high kiting because somebody\nwatching, and -- have seen us. When we come to the room, they called the -- not Gestapo,\nthey was a fredgendarmarie come. It was the \u2018nother group of German which helped\nGestapo. They -- I remember this fredgendarmarie have a big metal plate he -- that was\nfeltgendarmarie. And they come. Before they come, we fortunately ran away, but we take\nout everything what -- what has to be take out from there. And it was the \u2018nother job. The\n\u2018nother job was liquidation, the -- no spy there -- they spy the people, which was\ninformed for the Gestapo. No, this was the -- the \u2018nother -- not -- not very funny job, but\nwe have to sometimes kill -- liquidating the person, because this get lot of trouble for our\norganization.",
        "Q: During this period of time, were you able to witness what was developing in relation to\nthe Jewish community in Warsaw?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: Were you able to observe what was happening to the Jewish community in Warsaw --",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes, because we -- we helped Jewish people different way. You know,\nWarsaw different, like a people -- was always different people, but we help the Jewish --\nmy organization helped the people -- to Jewish -- to the ghetto, because was a ghetto --\nthe ghetto, they need their food. Then we supply as much as we can, and this time, in the\nbeginning, then German take Jewish people from ghetto to different work, outside the\nghetto. You know, they make like a column. In the front was a German, in the end of the\nGerman, but in the beginning was not very strong, the -- the -- the -- these people who\ndoesn\u2019t strong very -- th -- you know, was not watching very strong, that sometimes we\ntried to -- these run away, these people. And some people, some people -- I remember\nthat it was in 19 -- in 19 -- before the uprising, it was like a -- May, or June in 1944, yes,\nuprising was \u201844 --",
        "Q: \u201843",
        "A: \u201843. In 1943, before the uprising, because I attend to this school -- let\u2019s start this way --\nwhen I attend to this school, the German sent us for vacation to work for the German\nfactory. This time a -- they sent me to the BMW factory, what was like a branch in\nWarsaw, in okentsia, and in this factory, where I built the engine for the German plane,\nfor Faulkebuvs. Because was few guys that our job, first of all, was how we can make --\nrebuild this engine, this good, to where the engine would be not working. You know, it\nwas our thinking. You have to under -- that everybody tried to do something against, that\nwe tried go this way. They get us a tolerance -- because I was like a technician there -- in\nGerman was a rule that, 1t depend what you have a function, you have a different coat. I\nwas like a technician, they have a gray coat. The -- the other people have a red coat, they\ncan make a control, then other people blue coat, the black coat, it depend what they\ndoing, they -- the -- the German come on the -- on the -- to the fabri, they know\nimmediately who is who, what he is doing. That we\u2019re organized with my friends, which\nwill make a control, and with this, what I get the -- in this information, we tried to change\nthe tolerance. We find when we change the tolerance in this -- this engine was for the\nfolkewulf, what I told for folkewulf fighters. And to change this lightly, the tolerance.\nAnd the -- and there was this, the plane -- the engine approximately, was working on that,\nbecause after they repaired the engine, they placed it that end -- the -- the engine on the\nstand. Then later, they take this engine from stand, and install to the plane, and plane was\nfighting. Was a problem that most this engine blow out, that they stuck, approximately\nafter -- between 30 and 35 minutes fight -- flight. They came Gestapo, to start\ninvestigating why from this plate that all engine stop. And we know about this, the -- one\nday they se -- they start investigated, then next day we disappear, we didn\u2019t come any\nmore. We run away. Fortunately, if I remember, was June, I think, and unfortunately, we\ninform a lot of -- because in this factory, was working a lot of Jewish people. They didn\u2019t\nknow Jaimander was the Jewish, but what\u2019s important, Dakin hired himself like a worker\nfor the factory. And the problem, they have a good ousva, that mean good documentation,\nthey can live in there, not in the ghetto, they can be hired like -- not the Jewish, like --\nlike, you know, Catholic people, you know, like a cri -- Christian -- Christians. And this\nday, when the -- we ran away, and to inform -- we know which 1s Jewish, you know, w --\nbecause we keep this inform over there. They were let him know, they -- ris -- disappear\ntogether with us, was like a -- the Jewish, maybe, was five, maybe six, and a -- us was\nfive guys together. We attend to the same school, and we send to the same job. And was\nmore Jewish people, which we didn\u2019t know about, they sent. Unfortunately, when the\nGestapo come, then start investigated these people, and few people was killed over there,\nbetween this, if I remember what they told me later, two Jewish people, too.",
        "Q: When you were observing what was going on in Warsaw, how do you remember seeing\nthe developments of the ghetto?",
        "A: I have to think a little bit. Maybe you can break a moment?",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: Okay. Maybe we can talk about because I did not understand good question. Let me --",
        "Q: Take your time.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: If you\u2019d like a drink of water.",

        "A: -- what was -- what was my opinion? No.",
        "Q: No. How do you remember the experience? Do y -- do you remember seeing things that\nwere happening in Warsaw in relation to the Jewish community?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember how the Germans were acting, how they were functioning, how they\ndealt with the Jewish population?",
        "A: Yes, that -- let me remind myself, because first in the beginning -- in the beginning was\nnot very bad because the ghetto was, you know, like they people can come in and out,\nwas not big problem, they take a group of the Jewish people to work, if I remember, but\nlater, every time they -- was more tight, and more tight, and more tight. They let the --\nmake -- make a wall -- a g -- around the wa -- ghetto, like they make in there -- in Berlin,\nthe Communists make the wall the same. But in the beginning was not the wall, later they\nmake a wall. And then, this time was very bad, because the -- 1-1t was -- th -- it was big\nproblem with food. The problem with food was not only in the ghetto, but was all around\nthere, everybody has a problem. We had the same outside the ghetto, the same problem\nwith food. But in the ghetto was a big problem because was lot of people, they bring their\npeople from -- not only the Polish people, but bring the Jewish people from different part\nof the -- Europe. They bring from -- if I remember, from Holland, from Hungaria, from --\nfrom France, from many parts of Europe, they bring to the Warsaw ghetto. Because later\nthey bring these people from Warsaw ghetto to the concentin cap. It was later. In -- in the\nghetto was terrible, you know, because first of all was not [indecipherable] on the\nGerman, you know, shooting to the -- to the people, like to the -- to the animals, you\nknow, they don\u2019t -- some -- somebody was th -- they shoot him, additional. There was\nproblem, if I remember, they make a -- some Jewish people was a kapo. Kapo was this,\nlike internal police, you know, they always with -- you have a light -- large wooden\nsticks, and they, you know, tried to beat them to ord -- make some orders in ghetto for the\nJewish people. You understand mandy -- many -- every population, was always different\npeople, you know, between people always you find some -- like not people, like animals,\nyou know, they were this. But the amount of these people was very small, but still exist.\nAnd --",
        "Q: Did you have any personal relationship with people, Jewish people inside?",
        "A: Yes, some we did. I did my -- I n -- [remember my father have some friends, because,\nyou know, before, he make a business with many people that I remember that my father\nhad -- we cannot hide the people, because we live in Warsaw, in apartment, because we\nhave a nice house, but during the first days of bombing Warsaw, was destroyed, and we\nhave apartment, like three rooms, if I remember.

        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: What were your functions, and how long did you actually participate in that uprising?",
        "A: In the uprising, I was from the first day of uprising, because the -- this -- we made this --\nwe make this meeting from the uprising the first day. It was August first, what I said to\nyou, four o\u2019clock. We come over there very early, you know, the way that we come, we\nmet some -- already are so many people, the guys always coming, coming. And is the\nfirst day, you know, from this uprising, we stay over there, I don\u2019t remember exactly, but\nI think the second, or third day, I get the order to release -- to go to the \u2018nother place,\nbecause he says some orga -- is some chief from organization which has to be released. It\nwas the story -- it was in the last building on the street, it was -- over there was a factory,\na tobacco factory, in which stayed the German. And next building to this tobacco factory\nwas a letter. I find this letter, was all comments on AK, all big shots from akai -- AK,\nthey was over there. They give me the order to release this -- to go and to make a\nconnection with these people. The problem was this way, there was two streets, and the\nbuilding was last on the Emperdetto Street, the street was dead, dead end because was a\nbi -- you know, the factory to the whole block. And was there machine gun, they have\nbunkers and machine guns. Already few people tried to go over there, was killed. That\nwhen I go over there, they thought no way. This way we will be ki -- before we make a\nfew hundred yards we will be killed. Then we go over the building to the basement, but\nthis time all people help one each other, that we need a lot that they help us over the\nroofs, over the basement, and the -- only to last building we cannot go, we have to go\nover [indecipherable]. But I remember was like a -- already, it was summer, was pretty\nlong, you know, good light, you know, but I remember I reach this point approximately\nnine o\u2019clock, was a -- one building before. And then I have to jump to this -- to this gate.\nWhen I go over there I see already few people was killed on the street. Later, I find it was\na German, a g -- a German bunshutz. A bunshutz was a -- I don\u2019t know from where they\ncome, or where they -- what was the German organization in the black uniforms, it was\ntake care about the factories, about the trains. Then t -- I jumped over there, I was lucky, I\njumped, I came to that building. Friends of mine stay outside, do-don\u2019t go, because you\nwill be killed. And I come in, I take care about these bunkers. I go to the building, they\nlet me come in, they was very happy that here\u2019s a first connection. I come to the building,\ngo on the second floor, open the window, I take a few hand grenade, I drop on the -- on\nthe bunker, and clean the bunker right away. It was not very -- I was not here -- I do not\ntrust [indecipherable] my brains, and you know, he cleaned that bikey, my friend was\nhey, you okay, we can come in. The German [indecipherable] disappear, so was killed in\nthis bunker. And it was the -- mys first -- first action during the uprising.",

        "Q: How many months? How many months did the uprising continue until it was --",
        "A: No, uprising was -- what was 90 -- no, how many days? I don\u2019t remember, but I was not\nto the end of uprising, because they -- I was catch by the German before the end uprising,\nbecause uprising -- the longest time in uprising was in the center of the Warsaw, and I\nwas from the Ovalski, got to the center -- to the old town. From old town I go to the\ncenter, to the Warsaw, to the canals. And from the old -- from the center, we go to the --\nclose to the vistulary, but to the visla, and over there, like six or seven days if I\nremember, beca -- before the end of the uprising, the German catch us.",
        "Q: Okay. Why don\u2019t we take a drink of water.",
        "A: Okay, fine.",
        "Q: -- for this [inaudible]. In this period of time, just before the Germans caught you, were\nyou involved in any activity that related to releasing Jews from another prison, or another\nbuilding on Geshwear Street?",
        "A: Oh yes, on Geisha Street, yes, this was that -- you asked me when I -- how long was\nuprising. Well, first my s -- action was [indecipherable], the second action I don\u2019t\nremember, it was the fifth or sixth day of uprising. This difficult to remember, for --\nwhich day was --",
        "Q: [inaudible |",
        "A: -- maybe four, maybe fifth day. We firs -- I remember afternoon, we got to the\nrecognition, recognizing. Because I was the leader of my group, because on this Kerlitska\nStreet, what I thought y-you w-was mention, was killed another friends of mi -- and I was\nthe leader of the group, this time I still the leader. Then we come, at first for recognition.\nTake [indecipherable] German what is going on, what is going, because the next day we\nsupposed to take action. This time we stay in the Okapova Street, in the big -- we call\nbunker, it was a big school. And we stay -- our headquarters was in this school, and to a\nlot of guys, because lot of different groups, I met a lot of friends, which I never expect\nthey would belong to the Akar, because everything is now -- and then -- first we make\nrecognition, it was like five or six guys, I remember we go all together, because every --\nfrom us has a different function, but we went for recognition together, to get over there\nour leader, Capitan Yahn, who was their, you know, leader, but he come from England.\nHe was the -- in England he parach -- sorry, he parach with [indecipherable] in Poland.\nWe recognition, and I get the order to take about a left -- left side of that gashuf.\nGagayshufka, it was the last prison in which they keep the Jewish people, the German\nkeep the Jewish people. Most was intelligent people, most intelligent men what they use\nfor different purpose. They fix the cloths, but was engineers, was even the doctors. All\ndifferent, you know, profession, they were all professional people. They keep these\npeople for his use. And we know about this, because in this time we have, you know,\norganization, we have connection with these Jewish people, they expect something. And I\nhave the order to take left side, an other friend center, the right side. This time we have\ntwo German tanks. I -- I don\u2019t if you have heard, two tigres -- two tigers. One tiger was in\nwork -- good working condition, the \u2018nother was defected, because he has a fuel -- if I\nremember exactly, fuel pump was defective, because I was mechanic that I was\ninteresting what is going on. And this tank, first this tank ca -- whole action was day\nbefore all arranged, they will have as -- meeting in the night, you know, and first thing in\nthe morning, the tank come, get a few shots. The German, in the beginning, will not\ncome, he will expect this is not Polish tank, was his own. When the tanks are shooting,\nyou know, they disappeared, they start kill, and then we -- we go to the action. Action\nwas very fast because the German -- we didn\u2019t fight too much, because the German rather\ndisappear. And my group -- I grabbed this group from the left side, was not too many. I\ndon\u2019t remember, it was approximately 20, maybe 20 few people, this I don\u2019t remember\nexactly, which I release. They -- each people, you know, release different -- each group\nbecause this ja -- this Jewish people was in the barracks, small buildings, you know. It\nwas -- this releasing was like, if I remember, maybe start the action like nine, eight\no\u2019clock in the morning, and all action was finish up to two o\u2019clock. Everything was quiet,\nwe come back to -- this time. And this Jewish people, this I remember, because more\nintelligent, professional people was broken by the German this way, because was his\nidea. That was like a kids, you know? They called it as they stay with us, you know,\nbecause they see they go away, they will probably lost something. They -- I -- w-we was\nvery friendly, and we use -- we stayed together, they\u2019re good friend with these people.\nAnd after a few days, you know, they start be more confident. But in the first day, you\nsee, was difficult to -- was -- for this -- this -- like young kids, and it was professional\npeople. And we divided this people, we told him, you have three choices. If you\u2019d like to\nfight with us, because we have a lot of guns, you get a gun since you will be fighting with\nus. If you don\u2019t want fighting, we can -- you can -- you would like to stay with us,\nbecause we need people who would be -- carry our supply. That\u2019s mean foot armor in the\nback -- on the back. If you don\u2019t want, we help you to switch the cloth, and to go to the\npeople. If I remember, all these people stay with us, all of them. Some -- some, you\nknow, fighting, and some stay with us like supply. But some of this was, you know, so\nhungry for this situation, for the German, they would like to fight. And was, you know,\nvery good friends. I was very friendly with these people, and because -- when we\n[indecipherable] in the old town, then we have to go to the mid-town -- to the mid --\nmiddle of the Warsaw, with the canals. And some of these guys told me, \u201cListen, if we go\nto the canal, the German drop their bomb [indecipherable] to the canal, we could be\nkilled. We have -- we prepare someplace in ghetto,\u201d -- because some building in ghetto\nstill exist, you know, ruins, but still exists. We have someplace, when we have water and\nsome food, we can go over there, put the -- destroy the entrance that ve waiting, because\nwe know the Russian was on the other side there. The oth-other side of the, you know,\nriver, of the Visla river. And to stay we\u2019ll be waiting, Russian come right away. Thought,\nwho knows when the Russian coming? We don\u2019t expect. And then, all of -- all these\npeople we got together to the mid-town. And I remember something, because one of\nthese people was engineer, he was waking -- working before the war was second in the --\nin this sir -- sir -- sewer institution, you know, on -- in Warsaw, and he thought -- I know\nthey can\u2019t answer very good, and he help us to go to this canal. This his worl -- worl --\nhis trip was much longer what regular, but much more safeky. And this the reason there\nwas [indecipherable]. If was problem, I was wounded, my leg was wounded, I was shot\nhere, with this open, you know, open, you know, bleeding, run, I got to the sewer, you\nknow that, to this place. I was survive, I don\u2019t know. The \u2018nother guy was -- one of the J-\nJewish guy was a doctor, and he told me this way, \u201cYou will be survived, don\u2019t worry, I\nhave to steal from German some medicine.\u201d I don\u2019t know what medicine was, because\nwas no pain [indecipherable], was nothing this time. I know that only I pee in the violet\ncolor. This was some medicine, you know, which helped me against the infection. And\nfrom these people -- from these people, I do not change their moment -- from these\npeople you know, was another guy whom I remember very good his name even, because\nhe was a wholesaler for the factory, for the sh-shoe -- Polish factory, Dubrolen, and he\nwas like a wholesaler. I don\u2019t remember this time at -- in which place of the Poland, but I\nremember his name, because this guy, Mr. Zinberstein -- I think this was the name, he\ncome after the World War second -- you know, when everything arrived. One day I see\nthe guy in English uniform in the house, he come to my house, and looking. I thought,\n\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t remember me? I survived because you -- yo-you\nexplained me the -- the best way for me if I will go to the -- to the -- to the camp together\nwith all soldiers.

        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And one of the points she makes is that your story is really so interesting that we\u2019d like\nyou to speak a little more slowly, so that we can not only hear it better, but think with\nyou, as you\u2019re telling the story. So, we\u2019re going to go back as I\u2019d proposed to you earlier,\nwhile we were on our little break, and we\u2019re going to pick up the story again, with you\nback in -- in the AK, during the uprising, when you were telling us that you were in the\nprocess of being wounded. And if you can tell us again how you were wounded, and\nwhere you went when you were wounded, and let\u2019s just take it from there.",

        "A: This was -- this was approximately -- let me remind, it was approximately the third or\nfourth day was releasing the -- the headquarter of the Akar. Then next -- after next day of\ntwo days later was releasing the -- the ga-gayshoufka. Then next project what I have the\norder, was tekae for recognition to Naftousha. Naftousha was a part of the povonsky\nwhere was the group and the camp from the SS. That was the place when we have to go -\n- go over there and take care -- make a recognition over there. And I wen -- went over\nthere with my group, over there to recognition, and this time the German who wi -- the\nGerman -- we was in this school building what I said be -- from -- from which we go --\nmake all action. And the German start to make what we find -- start to make a -- a action\nagainst us. It was like a group around maybe hundred, maybe 150 soldiers, this SS, and\nthey have not only SS, they have additional the Russian -- no Russian, this was Ukrainian\npeople. This time they organize -- the German organize, you know, the -- for the German\narmy, different nationality.

        "Q: Latvia. And they go shoudis. There was another organization, what was they have\nuniform like SS, the same uniform SS. It will -- you know SS was the worst, and what\ncan be -- exist, was not the people, they think they are people, you know. And this group,\nthe German SS, and this, the \u2018nother SS, going to attack. When we see they prepare for\nattack, then we start, because they was waiting, you know, they was not ready for\nfighting, and we just come and we start fighting with these people. We probably give him\na very hard time, because this was on the cemetery. We go to the cemetery, to the\nPovalsky smentoush because on the -- on the north side was a Jewish cemetery, and this\nwas a Catholic cemetery. We go to the cemetery on the \u2018nother side. And we start\nfighting very strong with these people, and this time I was wounded. A friend of mine\nwas killed, and I was wounded. When I was wounded, I ask to my friend because I was\nwounded, to try -- like I immediately lost, you know, cannot stay on this leg. That I told\nto my friend, \u201cGive me more grenades, hand grenades and leave me alone. You go, run\naway and I will stay here, and I be waiting for this German, you know, with the hand\ngrenade, this -- you know, I will be fight as long as I can.\u201d They thought oh no, no, no,\nno. We was together so many times before the uprising, we have together so hard time,\nthen no. They grabbed me and told you no, you will not stay. And they helped me walk\nback to this school. And from this school -- I come to this school, the friends of my see\nthis I wounded, they give me their first help, and then drop me off during the ghetto,\nbecause ghetto was no more German, they drop me during the ghetto in the ambulance,\nbecause we have ambulance. During the fighting we find everything. We have car, we\nhave tanks, and we have ambulance. They give me -- and they put me in the ambulance,\nand go with this ambulance through ghetto, through the old town -- through the old town\nto the hospital. Was a hospital for the mental people hospital, but still was the hospital.\nAnd they dropped me off. Over there was -- the drive was terrible because this ambulance\ngo over the street bad -- on street -- across the street, the German make a small train to g -\n- to, you know, to -- they remove the bricks, and use the small train, you -- the wagon,\nyou know, with car -- de-delivered the bricks to the -- t-to the train station, they take the\nbricks to -- to Germany. And they go with this ambulance over this railroad. Was terrible,\nyou know? But still I was survive. When they get me over there to this hospital, they find\n-- they make a ha -- this time was still electric, so they make me x-ray. They find the\nbones are okay, and they put me on the second floor, this Polish first floor, but the one\nfloor over the ground, to the bed. I was in this bed to the next day, because next day the\nGermans start bombed. And they come, friends of mine which drop me over there, take\nme from the bed, you know, because was sno -- nothing, was only one dus together with\nthe -- you know, with the mattress, from this on the fl -- on the stairs, dropped me down,\nand over the street to the \u2018nother building.",
        "Q: Did the Germans bomb that building?",
        "A: They bombed all building. The German -- listen, the -- the German bombed the hospital,\nthe German -- like a ghetto, what was in the ghetto was in the beginning -- the uprising in\nghetto was later, but in the beginning was no uprising. The g -- people in ghetto, they\ndidn\u2019t fight with the German. And when the -- when the Jewish people start uprising,\nstart uprising because they\u2019re innocent people, innocent people what the people -- what\nthe -- they bombed these people, they killed these people. That was the reason that in -- in\nthe ghetto they start uprising. But first they start to kill the innocent people, and the\nGerman dropped the bomb on the hospital. They don\u2019t recognize nothing.",
        "Q: Somewhere you had mentioned that as a consequence of a bombing while you were in\nthe hospital, you were almost buried --",
        "A: Yes, it was from this hospital, they give me to the -- over the street to the \u2018nother place\nwhat was near hospital, that was restaurant. In this restaurant the windows was covered\nwith sandbags, and then was the people which survive from this hospital, they bring to\nthis restaurant. Was a one cell -- I don\u2019t remember how many people -- was no more like\n10 - 15 people in this one room, you know, wounded. And -- and if I remember only was\nSunday, this I remember, and I remember that this Sunday, the -- the Germans start very\nhard bombing the -- this area, the whole old town, because was in old town. And then I\nstay up and I talk to the friends of mine that listen, we have to maybe try to go to the --\nunder the church because it\u2019s a very strong building. This time I cannot walk, but they\ngive me, you know, now they -- piece of wood, you know, with a little bit cut what I put\nunder th -- my arm, and I use this wood and my left leg. In this moment, what I se -- I\nremember only onet. I have seen the orange color only, I never -- no noise, no nothing,\nand I see the orange -- very orange color, and was finish, I was unconscious, I don\u2019t know\nwhat happened. This I remember the last moment, orange color. And I don\u2019t know when I\nwake up, I don\u2019t know how long, maybe -- maybe few hours, maybe two days, I don\u2019t\nknow this, exactly how long. But anyway, when I wake up, I t-tried to make a voice, I\ncouldn\u2019t, because when I start talking, I start pick up a lot of dust, you know, because I\nwas completely covered. And w -- st-start make a voice, that I cannot, that I start yelling,\nvery slowly, and this time when I start yelling, I have heard some girl voice that, \u201cI heard\nyou, I will try to help you.\u201d And then she start looking for me, and open me, a little bit\nover my head, because what happen, the bomb throw away me from the building, the\nbuilding collapse, my legs was in the frame of the -- of the doors, and my head was\noutside. And through the very large doors, the -- all the dust go out, you know, on the\nangle, and I was here. There was pretty -- not very high over there my head. She open\nme, you know, that I see the light, and I have the a -- then she call for the help, they\ncome, the people, and remove me from this. When they remove me from this place, I was\ncompletely without cloth, nothing, everything was take out from me. I was completely\nlike a newborn, and I -- my body was a violet color.",
        "Q: Papers that you had with you, your identification?",
        "A: No -- everything stay -- I don\u2019t know, because everything was out. What was else? When\n-- first moment when I wake up, I know that I have in my pocket gun, that I told to\nmyself I would be -- I would die here, this 1s only one [indecipherable] that when I shoot\nmyself, I kill myself. I would be n -- I would be short story, would be -- not stay like this.\nBut I was in this position that I cannot move hand, nor move nothing, because I was\ncompletely cover, you know, with bricks, with dust, with everything. And when I -- when\nthey -- when they find me, when I said I was completely -- all clothes, all documents,\neverything was out, I have nothing on me. And later, 1t was in January or February -- no,\nfebru -- no, after the war was -- it was like in May, I think, they exhumated all bodies\nfrom -- because the places like this in Warsaw was plenty. They exhumated lot of places.\nOver there was my ver -- my very good friend who were over there. And I was told by\n[indecipherable] he -- he -- his wife told me that he was bed -- be -- that will be his\nfuneral in the church, that I went to this church. This time, th -- when they exhumated\nthese bodies was I don\u2019t remember, six or seven bodies, was six or seven casket, one of\nthe top the \u2018nother one, in one church was one mass, and one funeral for these all people.\nAnd on each casket was their name and their all information. And I was for this funeral,\nbecause this George who you know, you [indecipherable] he was over there. And after I\nwas sick, I feel very bad, and I was a little bit late that I stay on the end in the church, that\nwas fuel -- full with the people. And then come to me the one girl, and she take from my\nhand and bring to me to the -- to the casket. I thought -- was a surprise because she know\nme very well, my name and everything, and she -- the name they -- and because her\nboyfriend was killed over there between these people, and I saw, hey, this is everything\ncorrect. My -- they put my name, my date of birth, and my father\u2019s name, because was a\nRussian medal, they have to put the father name. Everything was over there, was mine,\nthat\u2019s me. That when I find this I went later to the Red Cross, and I start discuss with the\nRed Cross that -- that it was whole big discussion, because they thought listen, the story\nwas close, why you bothered us? You know, the person was buried, everything is\nfinished, and you start open the case again?",
        "Q: And how was it resolved?",
        "A: And the result, you know, I get -- they give me these documents, and they opened the\ndocuments, and they find these documents because I\u2019ve [indecipherable] they find the --\nthe -- you know, the doc -- all documents in red color, they find this document, and this\ndocument what I bring here, down from the Red Cross in Warsaw what I get. And\nbecause was -- the house was buried -- the -- the -- bombed, and tof -- was fired, this\nreason, that this document was like a few months, or few weeks -- few months in the -- in\nthe building, and this -- there is under -- was in this condition.",
        "Q: Do you remember more or less when this accident took place, this bombing when you\nwere buried? Do you remember more or less when that happened?",
        "A: What the --",
        "Q: This orange flash of --",
        "A: Yes, I just remember the orange flash and finish, and no more, and -- and I didn\u2019t know\nwhat happened less. I didn\u2019t -- did not, completely no idea. And only find -- I don\u2019t know\nhow long I was unconscious, I don\u2019t know how long they keep -- when they again --\nsomebody heard my voice and opened this.",
        "Q: Okay, from that period of time, do you remember when the funeral took place?",
        "A: Oh, it was few months, because was during the uprising in the old town. It was the -- it\nwas August, approximately. It was not September yet, it was August, maybe eight --\nmaybe 20, maybe 25\" August, during the uprising, before you know, this -- when I was\n00 -- 00 -- ooldit -- when I was, you know, under the -- under the bombing, and then the\nfuneral, it was in \u201844, and funeral was in the -- when the -- was a Russian come, it was\nprobably in May, maybe a -- maybe April, maybe May \u201845.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: This was few -- nice few months.",
        "Q: So it was seven or eight months after.",
        "A: Seven or eight months, and the people even then exhumated the people, during this time\nthey can not recognize, you know, the --",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: -- absolutely not. They find the body, they find the [indecipherable] was this -- that\u2019s it.\nWas impossible, you know, the thought -- you know, find what is the story.",
        "Q: Well, you have given us a very impressive variety of issues. Okay. We\u2019d like you to go\nback now in the discussion to when you were talking about the sabotaging of trains that\nyou were trained to do. And if you could tell us a little about the difference between your,\nor -- the difference bet -- how you sabotaged military trains, and whether you sabotaged\nnon-military trains, passenger trains, or any other kinds of trains.",
        "A: No, we -- we sabotage only -- because we have a -- the people which working on trains\nwill belong to organization and get us all information. We sabotage two type of train, the\nmilitary train with the soldiers, and the train with supply, with ammunition, with other\nsupply which went to the east front.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Okay. So those were the only two trains -- two types of trains that you were\nactually sabotaging?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: And in the sabotaging, how did you get word of which train to destroy?",
        "A: We know exac -- we know exactly how it works. We -- before we sabotage the train, first\nwe went to the fute and check the -- find the area in which place we can blow the train.\nBecause I was engineer, I was very good t-train that I know, I have information from the\nsky. You know, we called from sky, from the -- from the -- what they drop us off, which\nplace was the best. Always the place to blow the train was a curve, when the train was on\nthe curve. Because when you blow on the curve the train, you blow the same time, two\nlines. That\u2019s mean you di -- di -- two -- because was two train, two direction there, you\nhave to blow that train this way, that you blow both direction, not one direction. The train\nwhich you blow has to the same time block the \u2018nother direction of the line. It was the\nwhole -- the most difficult combination. Then we find the place, that when we find the\nplace, we told the -- we ready to take care about this place. They told us okay, that the\nsame day was designed. For instance, one day, one approximately time, was designed in\ndifferent place, that mean different group the same -- get the same orders. And now, they\norga -- have connection with the -- with the time table of the train, they thought, listen,\nthis place when you find would be the train, this, this and this time, there will be the train\nwhich is going eastbound, or westbound, they told -- told us, they told this time, because\nthe -- the same day was explode the train different places. And sometimes you get the\ntrain from there, this oolopsoogen,, the vacation train, or other time you get the train for\nthe supply. You know, this was not the plan from us, it the plan from the schedule, you\nknow, what you can find this time. And they told us the train will be approximately this --\non this time, run.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s mean, you know, th -- they -- we know that that -- that train will be going over\nthere, will be blow. The train we make it two different way. In the beginning, we make\nexplosion. This way, the explosive material was start for explosion by the locomotive, in\nthe beginning, because we didn\u2019t have so much supply. That\u2019s mean we put the whole\nmaterial, prepare under the train, and the -- before the material was in the o -- some land\nwas all explosive for the start explosion. It was beginning. That\u2019s mean if something\nhappened, if would be wrong train, you don\u2019t have a choice, because was explosion\nautomatically. Fortunately we never have an accident in which we don\u2019t want. And later,\nwe get machine for explosion. Was a machine when you press down, you make electric\nexplosion. You know, that mean you explode that train which you want, in that time\nwhich you want.",
        "Q: And that was more effective?",
        "A: More -- not -- not only more effective, but you know, the first you have to calculate it, the\ntime, how long, you know, you have to calculate it the speed of the that train, because it -\n- you can poss -- if you maybe too -- too close that the locomotive passed the explosion,\nand would be the fourth or third, you know, car blow up. And you have to blow always\nthe locomotive, was more ecu -- effective.",
        "Q: During the time when you were involved in these activities, did you ever find any Jewish\nparticipation [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. We have -- we have -- because for this action, usually go this way, that we\nworking in different ways, was three different ways. In the beginning, was a group like\nthree or four guys from our group only blow the -- make this action. Later, was action\nrequired more people that come the people, the people from the woods. That\u2019s mean we\ncoming like a specialist, and they come, they people which they [indecipherable |\nwatching for us. And we help him, and in this group was the Jewish people. In this group\nI met few times the Jewish people, because we make -- they was made arrangement and\nwe met in the place, and we didn\u2019t watch the face one [indecipherable] but you can find\nright away, you know. We have the -- the -- this Jewish people was in the woods, they\nwas.",
        "Q: How did you know they were Jewish?",
        "A: They -- they -- they talking, you know, because we talking, you know, they -- sometime\nthey thought we help a Jewish guy [indecipherable] they thought. Because the Jewish\npeople in this time in the partisan, what they thought was they were very valuable, you\nknow, when they fighting, because the worse -- worse -- if somebody -- fighter was the\nworse if he have family. The most active, and most valuable, was without family. The\nmost of us was single, was ne -- no married, you know, because married has a wife, got\nthe children, and who was single, you know, all the young kids what were fighting was\nsingle. We didn\u2019t have this -- this ballast, you know, for they -- for they remember about\nthe family. The problem [indecipherable] ours mothers.",
        "Q: Yeah. That you had. Do you remember whether you\u2019 ve heard of, or you saw any hostility\non the part of the Polish AK towards the Jewish partisans, or Jews who wanted to\nparticipate in the uprising?",
        "A: No, never. Never I have heard -- even I tell you. It was the additional -- two Akar was\ntwo different organization. Was a BH, bartelyoni huopsky, it was -- it was the \u2018nother\norganization -- it was the \u2018nother organization, the Communist organization was -- no --\nhave to remember, remind myself. One second, I remind myself. Armia ludova, AL,\narmia ludova. That\u2019s -- what was the story? Akar was friendly for everybody, bartelyoni\nhuopsky was friendly for everybody, but armia ludova was not friendly for everybody.\nThey always watching for another people like for the same for enemies.",
        "Q: Could you give me an example?",
        "A: I have heard -- I was not involved, but I have heard from friend -- friend of mines that\narmia ludova fight a few times with the -- with the armia cryova, and with the bartelyoni\nhuopsky.",
        "Q: Do you have any idea why they did?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: But in your experience you\u2019ve never heard of any hostility between the AK and Jews\nwho took [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, never, never, never. This, never. You know, I tell you additional. The Polish people,\nduring the hard time, when you have a really problem, they are fighting all together\nagainst the -- against the problem. They try -- everybody, you know, help very, very\ngood. I give you -- maybe we\u2019re not taping this, but I tell you the \u2018nother story. It was in\nWarsaw, in 1940, maybe one -- \u201841, was a gun -- was a helmia -- hel -- Nearna Street run\n-- | was a witness, run the guy away, and ta -- oozas calling politics, politician. And was\nnot -- of the street was no cars, not buses, was a crowded old people walking on the\nstreet, you know, small street. The people just give him a space, and the guy ran away.\nThe guy who ran behind him, he cannot -- and in one moment the guy was -- he run -- he\nis not politic, he steal my [indecipherable]. The guy was on the floor in one second. You\n-- you understand this? When he was -- the people help him right, but he was a chief, oh\nno.",
        "Q: So you --",
        "A: This is a good example, you know, how the all people, all people was tied together. Was\nnot enemies, was always was all the friends. But I talking the bo -- the armia ludova was\nnot -- they was not fighting, they didn\u2019t have a group in Warsaw, they have only the\nsmall group outside the Warsaw. Only one action with the armia ludova have said that\nwas belong to him, I was not sure -- it was -- I don\u2019t remember exactly, yeah, they bir --\nthey dropped few gra -- hand grenades to the cafeteria which was only for the German. It\nwas on the corner the allia zalinsky and nofisfiat, I don\u2019t remember the name of the\n[indecipherable]. And they dropped the bomb, you know, explosive that later was a big\nstory because for this, a -- grenades which didn\u2019t kill no Germans, just wounded few,\nthey probably kill few hundred of Polish people. One action -- what vogler was d -- was\ndone by the -- by the -- by the -- this armia ludova. You\u2019re talking about another\nsabotage. I have even here the article, I wouldn\u2019t to translated this, because what I told\nyou the -- the -- our job was cleaning the apartments, what I told you, that. Gestapo was\nso upset that they come to the room, apartment was clean, and sometime they fight with\nus because was -- we expect they coming, you know, they waiting one or two guys, and\nwe was coming big group, and -- you know, with good recognition. They bring small --\nsmall Panzer wagon. You know, the small Panzer wagon they prepare was not new, but\nwas used, and they bring to the harkapay. Harkapay was head of [indecipherable], it was\na German organization which repair and tribute all cars for the army. This car was over\nthere, but people which working was a Polish worker. They bring this small Panzer car to\nthis -- to one garage ou forty per. And this car, the German supposed to pick up -- the\nGestapo -- supposed to pick up like nine o\u2019clock in the morning one day. It was winter,\nand this day we know about this, and we decided that this guy would be better would be -\n- belong to us like for the Gestapo. That we come seven o\u2019clock in the morning and pick\nthis car up. I have whole article, if I have the time I translate it, you know, because this\nwas -- we call this action plouskva. Plouskva, this is a back, the small back I don\u2019t know,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Well, perhaps after the interview we can hold it up and -- and take a picture of it, and we\ncan discuss it. But I -- I would like to thank you very much Mr. Madejski. Okay. Okay.\nThen, what we\u2019re going to do is move beyond this experience, into the time after the war\nwhen the Russians came, and found you, and inducted you into the Russian army, or the\nequivalent of it at that time. So maybe you can tell us a little about that part of your life.",
        "A: Yeah, this mean, in -- after the uprising, I was in Potekovalishna what I said. From\nPotekovalishna, in February -- in February what was very cold -- something like in\nFebruary, or maybe beginning the February, maybe end of the appa -- s -- f -- January,\nwhen the Russian come over, because they come like in the January, begin the January, I\nwent from Potekovalishna, because you have no -- no possibility to live. I go to the\nPiotkov Telbunaski. Piotkov Telbunaski, this 1s another village, what I have a friends. Is\non the south of Poland. I went over there, and then come the -- this time come the\nRussian over there for good. And then I pick up all young people to the army, because I\nwas in the Akar, and for me was convenient go to the army, because they looking for the\nmember of Akar, and send him for Siberia, that I went for the army, but I have a good\nfriends. And friend of mine was -- he was priest, and he was there because this time in the\narmy was a priest and was rabbi.

And they sent me to the priest there, I went to the army, and they sent\nme to the priest, I go back. Was this organization, was this headquarter of this priest was\nclose to the Warsaw, in Vuokie. It was one small building, in half a building was the\npriest. They called general priest of the army, they -- now they have a building with\ngeneral rabbi of the army.

You need\nthe points, if you worker you have five points, if you in prison you have negative five\npoints, or zero points. And he thought -- I very glad that he win, because he to -- able\ncome to university. But this time we get the passport for my son, for myself, because he\nhave five months vacation. And this time we come to United State, and it was 25 years\nago, and we stay here. And my wife was in Poland, and later she get a passport.

Okay.\nThen, what we\u2019re going to do is move beyond this experience, into the time after the war\nwhen the Russians came, and found you, and inducted you into the Russian army, or the\nequivalent of it at that time. So maybe you can tell us a little about that part of your life.",
        "Q: And that was in '48?",

I ra -- ra -- raise in Warsaw, I attend in Warsaw to the public school, in\nArrokoveetsaplatz, and later I attend to the gimnasium, Meekoayray, in Warsaw, in\nMarrahowskiplatz.

        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: Yes, I attend to the public school in Arrokoveetsaplatz. You know, was a regular public\nschool, and later was a problem, because my father decided that we have two good\nfriends. One was German, another Russian. And he thought that from his experience, he\nsurvived during the war first, because he know perfect Russian language. He told me that\nif I would like to survive, probably would be the wa-war not in five, then in three -- in\nfive, in 10 years. You know, we\u2019re talking about nine -- the early 30 years. Then I have to\nattend to the gi -- gimnasium, in which I would be learned perfect one of these languages,\nRussian, or German. And he asked me which one I would like to selected. I decided that I\nwould like to speak German. There is on the [indecipherable] to the gimnasium\n[indecipherable] what was next to the Augsburg Evangelist Church, to which belonged\nmost of the German people. The German people which -- it was a Polish people, but with\nthe German background, and these people speak most time -- the kids speak most time in\nhome, German. That\u2019s mean the German languages were very, very high level. I was a\nvery poor student, very, really poor, you know, compared with the kids who would speak\nhome every day, German -- that I have every year a tutor. The tutor was this way, that\nusually my parents, and parents of another my friend -- I remember Yashu Nashuroski,\nyou know, rent the room someplace in vacation place, and come there tutor from\nGermany. Usually every year was a tutor from different part of Germany, and we speak\nduring this one month, almost two months, only German. That\u2019s mean, if we s -- we\ncannot speak one word -- one to each one other Polish, because he immediately beat us,\nbecause he expect we were talking something wrong against him, because he do not\nunderstand. And this way, when the German come, I speak fluently German. All the --\nalmost the same German went -- when the Polish. And additional I know, because the\ntutors were from different parts of Germany every year, that I know different slang, and\ndifferent -- different accent, because one was from one da -- one year were from Berlin,\nthe \u2018nother day was from Vien-Vienna, the \u2018nother year from Hamburg, that I speak\nHaplardeutsch, and Howdeutsch, and gin accent.",

        "A: Before the war?",
        "A: Just before the war. You know, before the war I attend, in 19 -- the year 1938 -- \u201839, I\nwas attend to the last year, to the gimnasium, because folsee -- the education was four\nyears in gimnasium, and was in mas -- last year. This year, I attend -- I have one class\nlike a -- they teach us -- they train us th -- something about the army. That\u2019s mean we\nhave training with -- like what\u2019s in the army. That\u2019s mean that the -- when German come,\nwe have a special uniform, you know, like a student uniform grim, looks something like a\nskulls -- like was most adverse like skulls. And when the German co -- before -- when the\nwar start in 1939, in September first, when the German attacked Poland, that I start\nworking for the organization which take care about fire and houses in -- in Warsaw. I was\nin -- very lucky, because I was 16 years [indecipherable] in June, and additional I can\ndrive. I can drive motorcycle, and I can drive car. What this time was something you\nknow, like special knowledge, this was, you know, like high education, this knowledge,\nthat when the -- the -- th -- the war start, I get fr-from this organization the motorcycle,\nand I was a line officer, you know, just delivered information. And a few days later, when\nthe German come close to the Warsaw -- and Warsaw was, you know -- Warsaw was on\nthe -- all side of the Warsaw was the German army. Then, was no water that the army --\nthe army give me a truck, they -- a soldier make on that truck -- put the big barrels, they\npump the water, and I drive this water from the -- from the hospital when they -- wh-\nwhere was that water place, you know, go to the bakery for they make bread for the army,\nthat during the night I pull water -- drive the water. During the day I delivered documents\nfrom the -- for the army, you know that I was very busy this time.

They grab this, you know, a lot which Ill grab this and throw away on the\nstreet, and the kids who on the street put with the sont, cover this.",
        "A: When war began?",

        "A: This was -- this was from the first day -- no, from the first day of the war, to the day what\nwas Warsaw, you know, capital, you know, surrendered. It was like one month -- no --\napproximately one month, maybe a little bit less.",
        "A: Pardon me? And later was -- you know, was --",
        "A: When the Warsaw surrendered, this 1s -- 1t was -- did nothing, was few weeks we\u2019re with\nnothing, because it was completely disaster. I used to try to work in ki -- this time in the -\n- like voluntary in different organization. That\u2019s mean we have two people -- bread, you\nknow, daily bread, the breadmaker, breadmaker -- food, because was completely disaster.\nThis was -- was like almost the fu -- two or three weeks. Later, they opened the schools,\nbut they opened the schools for the Polish children only, for the technical school. That\u2019s\nmean it was not like a grammar school, it was not the gimnasium, only was technical\nschool. And I attend -- start attending to the school which was the mainin -- mechanical\nschool, because I finished this full class gimnasium, and then I attend to this school, it\nwas in Gorsky. This was a very famous gimnasium, Gorsky in Warsaw, and in this\ngimnasium they opened like -- it was not the school like a training for the -- techni -- for\nthe mechanics. I attend to this school to one year, maybe one and a half, and German\nclosed the school, because they find the school 1s not only the training the -- the\nmechanic, but the same time they train the underground terrorists, you know, they closed\nthe school. They opened another school, which I started and was another mechanical\nschool. It was in Mokotof, the different parts of the town. This school I attend I think one\nyear that -- anyway, I finish, I was get a diploma from this school. And in the meantime\nthey opened a -- a polytechnic institute they call herateknisha fakshula, in German. This\nmean the school with the highest -- highest education like a -- they call betripinjinids.\nThat\u2019s mean the -- like a high level technician.",
        "A: And this -- this school I stayed -- this is what I have documents in there, I document --\nthis school I think I attend one and a half year, because at ex -- started the uprising there,\nand a -- August first was uprising. This August? Yeah.",
        "A: June, July, yes, sorry. Uprising -- the school was ot -- not open any more.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. In 1939, in th -- December, I remember this exactly, in December, they -- I met a\nfriends which have connection with the -- like a main organization they call zetfouzet.\nThis was the like organiza-organization which supposed to fight with the arms against the\noccupation. I had -- I have a fr -- met a friend, and he thought, listen we start organize, I\nalready have connection, organization will be five. This mean we have to have five guys\nwho have to -- fi -- five more. Four guys, they will be together five. Because this was\norganization, they would be very difficult to discover by the German. That\u2019s mean if the\nGerman find -- they all will find one guy and one small group, no more. Will be no\nconnection between the group -- was completely no connection. You know, was this\nsystem of the organization. And this start in th-the -- exactly I remember was December\nthirti -- 1939. And in the beginning was training, that\u2019s mean we have to know how use\nthe guns. We already have guns, because during the ja -- the war, I hired few different\nguns, and I hired few different radiopera. The German -- because German, when come,\nthey take all radiopera, you have to bring to the German, they destroy. I hide at this time -\n- the people get that I hide, you know, on different places, usually on the attics, in the\nbasement. In the basement was a big hole in the wall. In the wall I remember that I put\nthe cover with the -- with the rubber, with the fabrics, you know, because was no plastic\nthis time, and [indecipherable] I put, you know, wall, and I covered this. Then, when we\nstart going to [indecipherable] then we start learning how using the -- the arms, and how -\n- we Start using the radio, listen the BBC, because BBC was in the Polish language, all\ninformation. And additional, we tried to organize, you know, and learn. In meantime, we\nget from the alliance, I think it was a little bit later, the name of the organization changed.\nI think was maybe in 1940 or \u201c41, we started to get the arms and material from the sky,\nyou know, from the alliance. And then, because I was mechanic, I was very, you know,\nwas very good working my hands, that I start learn from this book what they sent from\nthe -- England, usually, they drop off, you know, about the mine. That\u2019s mean I know\nhow make the mines to blow up the bridges, how blow the trains, and then I was expert\nfor this. And this was the -- all the -- the action they call tashma -- tashma, this mean the\n[indecipherable] one, you know, that\u2019s the same time was blow the train in many places,\nusually the train with the supply to the east front of the oolopsageta. Oolopsageta was a\ntrain which bring the German from the east front for vacation. Vacation train they call\noolopsoogen. They would blow up this -- this oolopsoogen. Yes?",
        "A: In this process, you know, because I was very fast in making mines, installed the mines\non the train, that I was like a miner, you know? Usually the people stay in the back of me,\nthey care about me, and I built, and I installed this equipment, and this material to blow\nup the trains, mostly we did many, many this action. The problem was usually to deliver\nit, the material, because this time the material was -- they call it troten, I don\u2019t know, they\nnamed it troten, was -- looks like a -- you probably remember many, many years ago, the\nsoap was in the bar, approximately one foot long, like a two inches time two inches core.\nThis to -- looks like a -- this material looks approximately like this bar of soaps. And to\nuse this material [indecipherable] soap, you know, the material you need lot. Not like\nnow when you can use a few pounds, this was not, we have to like 10 - 20 pounds. We\nhave to transport this material, sometimes from Warsaw. Outside the Warsaw was\nproblem, because in that train, that German you make -- checking everything. They check\n-- their people check documents, they\u2019re using counterfeit documents, and this material,\nusually we have connection with the train man, you know, was because this time most\npeople belong to this different organization. We don\u2019t know one -- each other, but we get\nthis, and they help us to transport this. When we go to the same place, we have usually\nthere somebody from the local place, who get us -- was a guide for the place, and the\nguide let her disappear. She was not involved, you know. This required that not people\ntry don\u2019t know one each other too good, because if they catch one guy, it\u2019s better if he\ndon\u2019t know too much.",
        "A: This was -- this was -- the name of the AK changed, because first was zed vouset, then\nlater was different names of this organization. Before it was AK, they call -- the AK have\ndifferent names. I don\u2019t know -- is difficult to translate it. It was deska broda 69. It was\nthe name of organization. Deska, this mean bort. Broda -- you know broda. This was like\na bed, was a synonym for this organization, but this was always the same. They call lar --\nverka de versia. This mean large -- big diversion, right? Because was a small diversion, a\nbig diversion. Because additional what we did, because I was a little bit older, and this\ntime you know, 17 - 18 years old, because 16, I finish in June 19 -- 1939, that\u2019s -- we\ntrained the young kids from the scouts. We bring him the gun for the meetings and train\nhim into -- was usually no more like five guys, you know, because was a rule, you know?\nAnd t -- we bring guns, and explain him how you say gun, how clean, how open, how\nloading. If they stuck, how release, you know, because was very important.",
        "A: And because guns we have different, because we have Polish guns, we have guns, we\nhave guns which we get from the England -- 1t was -- some was American, and some was\nEnglish, Sten, and tommy gun, Thompson, and Colt was -- lot of different, that you have\nto be -- when I be -- because I was mechanic, this for me was very, very simple, very\neasy.",
        "A: The same, \u201841, \u201842. What else we did additional. We release -- we clean -- we call the\nclean the apartments. What that\u2019s mean? For instance, you belong to the organization,\nand you was -- the Gestapo arrest you. But in your house was a lot of hiding places we\nknow about, in the floor, in the wall, you know, in the furnitures, some documents, some\ninformation, some ti -- with the cords for the radio, you know, many important\ndocuments. This guy was arrested, and then they arrested the people, but Gestapo still\nwatching for this house, and watching who is coming to this apartment, they would like\nto arrest him. That our job was cla -- come and take everything from this apartment, what\nwas less -- left of it. We usually -- somebody know what is there -- make the -- you\nknow, a place was hiding. Usually wa -- it was -- was in the ba -- in the floor. You have\nto use a special knife, stick in the hole, and slip and this spring open, you open, and can\nremove this. That\u2019s mean we have to clean this. Usually this can equal very -- pretty\ndangerous, because the German -- few people are watching for this Gestapo, and we have\nto come and take -- come in that room and clean everything. We fight -- sometime was\nfighting. I remember once we have bitte -- big -- very high kiting because somebody\nwatching, and -- have seen us. When we come to the room, they called the -- not Gestapo,\nthey was a fredgendarmarie come. It was the \u2018nother group of German which helped\nGestapo. They -- I remember this fredgendarmarie have a big metal plate he -- that was\nfeltgendarmarie. And they come. Before they come, we fortunately ran away, but we take\nout everything what -- what has to be take out from there. And it was the \u2018nother job. The\n\u2018nother job was liquidation, the -- no spy there -- they spy the people, which was\ninformed for the Gestapo. No, this was the -- the \u2018nother -- not -- not very funny job, but\nwe have to sometimes kill -- liquidating the person, because this get lot of trouble for our\norganization.",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes, because we -- we helped Jewish people different way. You know,\nWarsaw different, like a people -- was always different people, but we help the Jewish --\nmy organization helped the people -- to Jewish -- to the ghetto, because was a ghetto --\nthe ghetto, they need their food. Then we supply as much as we can, and this time, in the\nbeginning, then German take Jewish people from ghetto to different work, outside the\nghetto. You know, they make like a column. In the front was a German, in the end of the\nGerman, but in the beginning was not very strong, the -- the -- the -- these people who\ndoesn\u2019t strong very -- th -- you know, was not watching very strong, that sometimes we\ntried to -- these run away, these people. And some people, some people -- I remember\nthat it was in 19 -- in 19 -- before the uprising, it was like a -- May, or June in 1944, yes,\nuprising was \u201844 --",
        "A: \u201843. In 1943, before the uprising, because I attend to this school -- let\u2019s start this way --\nwhen I attend to this school, the German sent us for vacation to work for the German\nfactory. This time a -- they sent me to the BMW factory, what was like a branch in\nWarsaw, in okentsia, and in this factory, where I built the engine for the German plane,\nfor Faulkebuvs. Because was few guys that our job, first of all, was how we can make --\nrebuild this engine, this good, to where the engine would be not working. You know, it\nwas our thinking. You have to under -- that everybody tried to do something against, that\nwe tried go this way. They get us a tolerance -- because I was like a technician there -- in\nGerman was a rule that, 1t depend what you have a function, you have a different coat. I\nwas like a technician, they have a gray coat. The -- the other people have a red coat, they\ncan make a control, then other people blue coat, the black coat, it depend what they\ndoing, they -- the -- the German come on the -- on the -- to the fabri, they know\nimmediately who is who, what he is doing. That we\u2019re organized with my friends, which\nwill make a control, and with this, what I get the -- in this information, we tried to change\nthe tolerance. We find when we change the tolerance in this -- this engine was for the\nfolkewulf, what I told for folkewulf fighters. And to change this lightly, the tolerance.\nAnd the -- and there was this, the plane -- the engine approximately, was working on that,\nbecause after they repaired the engine, they placed it that end -- the -- the engine on the\nstand. Then later, they take this engine from stand, and install to the plane, and plane was\nfighting. Was a problem that most this engine blow out, that they stuck, approximately\nafter -- between 30 and 35 minutes fight -- flight. They came Gestapo, to start\ninvestigating why from this plate that all engine stop. And we know about this, the -- one\nday they se -- they start investigated, then next day we disappear, we didn\u2019t come any\nmore. We run away. Fortunately, if I remember, was June, I think, and unfortunately, we\ninform a lot of -- because in this factory, was working a lot of Jewish people. They didn\u2019t\nknow Jaimander was the Jewish, but what\u2019s important, Dakin hired himself like a worker\nfor the factory. And the problem, they have a good ousva, that mean good documentation,\nthey can live in there, not in the ghetto, they can be hired like -- not the Jewish, like --\nlike, you know, Catholic people, you know, like a cri -- Christian -- Christians. And this\nday, when the -- we ran away, and to inform -- we know which 1s Jewish, you know, w --\nbecause we keep this inform over there. They were let him know, they -- ris -- disappear\ntogether with us, was like a -- the Jewish, maybe, was five, maybe six, and a -- us was\nfive guys together. We attend to the same school, and we send to the same job. And was\nmore Jewish people, which we didn\u2019t know about, they sent. Unfortunately, when the\nGestapo come, then start investigated these people, and few people was killed over there,\nbetween this, if I remember what they told me later, two Jewish people, too.",
        "A: I have to think a little bit. Maybe you can break a moment?",
        "A: Okay. Maybe we can talk about because I did not understand good question. Let me --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No. No, I don\u2019t get -- you think your question was --",
        "A: -- what was -- what was my opinion? No.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, that -- let me remind myself, because first in the beginning -- in the beginning was\nnot very bad because the ghetto was, you know, like they people can come in and out,\nwas not big problem, they take a group of the Jewish people to work, if I remember, but\nlater, every time they -- was more tight, and more tight, and more tight. They let the --\nmake -- make a wall -- a g -- around the wa -- ghetto, like they make in there -- in Berlin,\nthe Communists make the wall the same. But in the beginning was not the wall, later they\nmake a wall. And then, this time was very bad, because the -- 1-1t was -- th -- it was big\nproblem with food. The problem with food was not only in the ghetto, but was all around\nthere, everybody has a problem. We had the same outside the ghetto, the same problem\nwith food. But in the ghetto was a big problem because was lot of people, they bring their\npeople from -- not only the Polish people, but bring the Jewish people from different part\nof the -- Europe. They bring from -- if I remember, from Holland, from Hungaria, from --\nfrom France, from many parts of Europe, they bring to the Warsaw ghetto. Because later\nthey bring these people from Warsaw ghetto to the concentin cap. It was later. In -- in the\nghetto was terrible, you know, because first of all was not [indecipherable] on the\nGerman, you know, shooting to the -- to the people, like to the -- to the animals, you\nknow, they don\u2019t -- some -- somebody was th -- they shoot him, additional. There was\nproblem, if I remember, they make a -- some Jewish people was a kapo. Kapo was this,\nlike internal police, you know, they always with -- you have a light -- large wooden\nsticks, and they, you know, tried to beat them to ord -- make some orders in ghetto for the\nJewish people. You understand mandy -- many -- every population, was always different\npeople, you know, between people always you find some -- like not people, like animals,\nyou know, they were this. But the amount of these people was very small, but still exist.\nAnd --",
        "A: Yes, some we did. I did my -- I n -- [remember my father have some friends, because,\nyou know, before, he make a business with many people that I remember that my father\nhad -- we cannot hide the people, because we live in Warsaw, in apartment, because we\nhave a nice house, but during the first days of bombing Warsaw, was destroyed, and we\nhave apartment, like three rooms, if I remember. Yes, three -- three rooms, that\u2019s mean\nlike a three bedrooms now we call different, you know, three rooms and the kitchen in\nAhota, on Jerosderhofska Street. Jehof -- Jehoferska S-street, you now, and we can not\nhide nobody, it was too small. But I remember my father gets some money, and some\ninformation, and tried to transport some fr -- his Jewish friend outside the Warsaw to\nSohatchefentwobeets, because he has some other friends over there, that he give him a --\nhelp him to transport these people to their -- to their country -- to their country, to their\nvillage.",
        "A: Inside the ghetto? I don\u2019t remember -- it was once or twice -- I don\u2019t remember for what\npurpose, but you know, I was not to man -- not too many times. We have one action,\nwhich supposed to be -- make, you know, exit from the ghetto for the Jewish people, it\nwas in 19 -- I think one year before -- you know, in the spring what was the uprising. But\nthis action was in the last second. Re -- rebor -- yes -- re -- r -- [indecipherable], no, no,\nthey -- they conserred this action, and it was very bad, because they -- this action is\nsupposed to be met in the -- he -- like in the end of the day, and they conserred this -- you\nknow, we have a Polish -- Polish hours, we cannot -- nobody can walk after eight o\u2019clock\nor nine o\u2019clock, I don\u2019t remember this time exactly. I think was nine or eight o\u2019clock, and\nthey conserred this action like 7:30. And we was whole group organize in few different\nplaces, because we don\u2019t know rada -- one each other, but my group who I remember was\n-- this time we was two group, that was like almost 10 guys together, and was the \u2018nother\ngroup in this place, it was in Povolski, we have this pointers when we have to meet to get\n-- and they conserred this -- this action, and I, fortunately knowed the road, and I got to\nZholeeboz, to the \u2018nother place, but in this time was a killed very good boy, a young boy,\nLubamilski, he was princess Lubamilski. His name was Maui, this means small, and he\nwas killed -- I -- I was wounded in this -- this place. I was wounded, fortunately they\ndidn\u2019t kill me, and to w -- we run away. We have only the Stens, the gun, and the\nGerman. We went -- they conserred this action, we have to go out. Was too late to take a\ntrain, or take a -- was no buses only the -- how you tramviad, you know, the -- the -- the -\n- the train, you know, go home. Because was impossible, was too late. The action was --\nsomebody organized this, but without head, you know, and a lot of people was killed in\nthis time, because my group, fortunately we lost only one guy. I was wounded, and\nsomebody was else wounded, very light. But they [indecipherable] a lot of people was\ncompletely killed, because they stay, and the German find what is going on, and bring the\n-- the pilots, you know, because they have different, and pilots, young, strong, engaged in\nthis fighting, and they killed lot of -- lot of group, big group was killed over there.",
        "A: The ghetto.",
        "A: Oh, was terrible in the ghetto this time, was terrible, because it was -- there was a -- like a\nfew different group of the people in the ghetto, was terrible, because some was pretty rich\nJewish people, and some were -- most was very poor. And the worst was the young kids,\nalmost die on street, without food, without help, without nothing. We would try to, you\nknow, it doesn\u2019t matter, you know, a lot of people tried to help these people, but was --\nwas what you said, that was shortage with food for everybody. And these people was\ntreat like animals, you know, because there was no -- no help for these people.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember exactly. I remember, you know, like through the -- you know, is so\nmany years. I remember only when the stukas, the plane, it come and drop the bombs to\nthe ghetto, you know, and there\u2019s people, which was -- I remember December -- what\nwas 1939, and the same the German did, you know, with the ghetto, they drop the bomb,\nyou know, they come the plane, and drop the bomb, and they burned this ghetto. The Je-\nJewish people, some people, run away. But was very, very rare, because they was lucky\nto run away. We know later there was uprising in ghetto. Some group -- not myso -- but\nfrom our organization, some group has ordered to get the help with the guns, with ammo,\nyou know, not fighting, I don\u2019t remember was people with fighting to get there with\nJewish people. But they supply him the guns, they supply him the arms. This, which we\nget from the supply from the alliance. I have heard a different story, you know, they said,\nyou know, different story, but this I don\u2019t remember, it\u2019s so many years.",
        "A: Oh yes, this I remember -- I remember very good because the plane, you know, flies so\nvery low over the Warsaw -- over the ghetto, and they drop the bomb. This -- you can see\nthe bomb they did drop on the -- on the housing, and burned the housing.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t have any -- only one action what I told you before, we supposed to free this\n-- make a -- like a -- you know, a possibility to run away from ghetto, but this action was\ncancelled.",
        "A: They -- they wi -- they -- always doing the same, we organize, and always prepare to\nmoment when we be [indecipherable] and thought we\u2019d be uprising, but we expect\nsomething like this.",
        "A: We up -- we expect uprising.",
        "A: When the Warsaw uprising -- before the Warsaw, I -- we was organized. Before the\nWarsaw uprising began, we get -- I don\u2019t remember exactly, maybe four, maybe five\ndays before, we have order, don\u2019t stay home, we stay all together, with guns, with all\neverything what our supply in one place. We\u2019II stay in this place, in Zalaz nebrama. It\nwas close to the Ogwidzowski. You don\u2019t know Warsaw. You know a little bit?",
        "A: Yes. Okay, then we stay, we have apartment over there. We get the address, and over\nthere we have like a two group, that\u2019s mean was 10 or 11 people, something like this,\ntogether, and we stay all together. It was few days already before the uprising. And to\nwasti -- waiting for something was like in alert. We didn\u2019t know what for we waiting, but\nit was on [indecipherable]. And then we get the order that on this hour, it was four\no\u2019clock, or three o\u2019clock, something like this, we have to go to the telefunken factory.\nTelefunken factory was in -- close to the occupovite, was in Avola. We went over there\nfor the -- with whole supply. We have very good supply, our group, really good supply,\nbecause we was supply not only for us, but we have a magazines, you know, the storage,\nyou know, for the -- another group, with the -- that\u2019s mean the group would pick up\nsupply from the alliance, they get to our magazine, because what I said in the beginning,\nwe have few houses which have double wall, and over there we keep lot of different\nsupply. And then we bring for the uprising, we come with a pair of hoses, you know, a\ncar what carried a lot of guns. In meet -- give you example, we have even machine --\nheavy machine gun, which was hired from the -- from the 1939. They would bring lot of\nguns, lot of ammunition, we bring this, everything to this point, this telefunken factory,\nyou know, when we bring this over there. When we come over there, we say oh goy, my\nGod, what is going on. The group like this, which was, you know, hundreds. It was lot of\ndifferent groups which bring the supply, and lot of young fellows, even some, if I\nremember, some young kids come for this point from the woods, you know, because\nsome group was -- they didn\u2019t stay in the -- Warsaw, they stay in the woods. They come\nfrom the campin -- campino seever, they come over there. Was very big. And this place\nwas -- was on the weerneck, next over there -- over their fence was a Jewish cemetery,\nKierkud, and tha -- across the street, on the \u2018nother side of the occupovasid, but a little bit\nfarther was again shufka. Was this place where later I get the order to release the Jewish,\nlast Jewish people, which was alive.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: In the uprising, I was from the first day of uprising, because the -- this -- we made this --\nwe make this meeting from the uprising the first day. It was August first, what I said to\nyou, four o\u2019clock. We come over there very early, you know, the way that we come, we\nmet some -- already are so many people, the guys always coming, coming. And is the\nfirst day, you know, from this uprising, we stay over there, I don\u2019t remember exactly, but\nI think the second, or third day, I get the order to release -- to go to the \u2018nother place,\nbecause he says some orga -- is some chief from organization which has to be released. It\nwas the story -- it was in the last building on the street, it was -- over there was a factory,\na tobacco factory, in which stayed the German. And next building to this tobacco factory\nwas a letter. I find this letter, was all comments on AK, all big shots from akai -- AK,\nthey was over there. They give me the order to release this -- to go and to make a\nconnection with these people. The problem was this way, there was two streets, and the\nbuilding was last on the Emperdetto Street, the street was dead, dead end because was a\nbi -- you know, the factory to the whole block. And was there machine gun, they have\nbunkers and machine guns. Already few people tried to go over there, was killed. That\nwhen I go over there, they thought no way. This way we will be ki -- before we make a\nfew hundred yards we will be killed. Then we go over the building to the basement, but\nthis time all people help one each other, that we need a lot that they help us over the\nroofs, over the basement, and the -- only to last building we cannot go, we have to go\nover [indecipherable]. But I remember was like a -- already, it was summer, was pretty\nlong, you know, good light, you know, but I remember I reach this point approximately\nnine o\u2019clock, was a -- one building before. And then I have to jump to this -- to this gate.\nWhen I go over there I see already few people was killed on the street. Later, I find it was\na German, a g -- a German bunshutz. A bunshutz was a -- I don\u2019t know from where they\ncome, or where they -- what was the German organization in the black uniforms, it was\ntake care about the factories, about the trains. Then t -- I jumped over there, I was lucky, I\njumped, I came to that building. Friends of mine stay outside, do-don\u2019t go, because you\nwill be killed. And I come in, I take care about these bunkers. I go to the building, they\nlet me come in, they was very happy that here\u2019s a first connection. I come to the building,\ngo on the second floor, open the window, I take a few hand grenade, I drop on the -- on\nthe bunker, and clean the bunker right away. It was not very -- I was not here -- I do not\ntrust [indecipherable] my brains, and you know, he cleaned that bikey, my friend was\nhey, you okay, we can come in. The German [indecipherable] disappear, so was killed in\nthis bunker. And it was the -- mys first -- first action during the uprising.",
        "A: How long?",
        "A: No, uprising was -- what was 90 -- no, how many days? I don\u2019t remember, but I was not\nto the end of uprising, because they -- I was catch by the German before the end uprising,\nbecause uprising -- the longest time in uprising was in the center of the Warsaw, and I\nwas from the Ovalski, got to the center -- to the old town. From old town I go to the\ncenter, to the Warsaw, to the canals. And from the old -- from the center, we go to the --\nclose to the vistulary, but to the visla, and over there, like six or seven days if I\nremember, beca -- before the end of the uprising, the German catch us.",
        "A: Okay, fine.",
        "A: Oh yes, on Geisha Street, yes, this was that -- you asked me when I -- how long was\nuprising. Well, first my s -- action was [indecipherable], the second action I don\u2019t\nremember, it was the fifth or sixth day of uprising. This difficult to remember, for --\nwhich day was --",
        "A: -- maybe four, maybe fifth day. We firs -- I remember afternoon, we got to the\nrecognition, recognizing. Because I was the leader of my group, because on this Kerlitska\nStreet, what I thought y-you w-was mention, was killed another friends of mi -- and I was\nthe leader of the group, this time I still the leader. Then we come, at first for recognition.\nTake [indecipherable] German what is going on, what is going, because the next day we\nsupposed to take action. This time we stay in the Okapova Street, in the big -- we call\nbunker, it was a big school. And we stay -- our headquarters was in this school, and to a\nlot of guys, because lot of different groups, I met a lot of friends, which I never expect\nthey would belong to the Akar, because everything is now -- and then -- first we make\nrecognition, it was like five or six guys, I remember we go all together, because every --\nfrom us has a different function, but we went for recognition together, to get over there\nour leader, Capitan Yahn, who was their, you know, leader, but he come from England.\nHe was the -- in England he parach -- sorry, he parach with [indecipherable] in Poland.\nWe recognition, and I get the order to take about a left -- left side of that gashuf.\nGagayshufka, it was the last prison in which they keep the Jewish people, the German\nkeep the Jewish people. Most was intelligent people, most intelligent men what they use\nfor different purpose. They fix the cloths, but was engineers, was even the doctors. All\ndifferent, you know, profession, they were all professional people. They keep these\npeople for his use. And we know about this, because in this time we have, you know,\norganization, we have connection with these Jewish people, they expect something. And I\nhave the order to take left side, an other friend center, the right side. This time we have\ntwo German tanks. I -- I don\u2019t if you have heard, two tigres -- two tigers. One tiger was in\nwork -- good working condition, the \u2018nother was defected, because he has a fuel -- if I\nremember exactly, fuel pump was defective, because I was mechanic that I was\ninteresting what is going on. And this tank, first this tank ca -- whole action was day\nbefore all arranged, they will have as -- meeting in the night, you know, and first thing in\nthe morning, the tank come, get a few shots. The German, in the beginning, will not\ncome, he will expect this is not Polish tank, was his own. When the tanks are shooting,\nyou know, they disappeared, they start kill, and then we -- we go to the action. Action\nwas very fast because the German -- we didn\u2019t fight too much, because the German rather\ndisappear. And my group -- I grabbed this group from the left side, was not too many. I\ndon\u2019t remember, it was approximately 20, maybe 20 few people, this I don\u2019t remember\nexactly, which I release. They -- each people, you know, release different -- each group\nbecause this ja -- this Jewish people was in the barracks, small buildings, you know. It\nwas -- this releasing was like, if I remember, maybe start the action like nine, eight\no\u2019clock in the morning, and all action was finish up to two o\u2019clock. Everything was quiet,\nwe come back to -- this time. And this Jewish people, this I remember, because more\nintelligent, professional people was broken by the German this way, because was his\nidea. That was like a kids, you know? They called it as they stay with us, you know,\nbecause they see they go away, they will probably lost something. They -- I -- w-we was\nvery friendly, and we use -- we stayed together, they\u2019re good friend with these people.\nAnd after a few days, you know, they start be more confident. But in the first day, you\nsee, was difficult to -- was -- for this -- this -- like young kids, and it was professional\npeople. And we divided this people, we told him, you have three choices. If you\u2019d like to\nfight with us, because we have a lot of guns, you get a gun since you will be fighting with\nus. If you don\u2019t want fighting, we can -- you can -- you would like to stay with us,\nbecause we need people who would be -- carry our supply. That\u2019s mean foot armor in the\nback -- on the back. If you don\u2019t want, we help you to switch the cloth, and to go to the\npeople. If I remember, all these people stay with us, all of them. Some -- some, you\nknow, fighting, and some stay with us like supply. But some of this was, you know, so\nhungry for this situation, for the German, they would like to fight. And was, you know,\nvery good friends. I was very friendly with these people, and because -- when we\n[indecipherable] in the old town, then we have to go to the mid-town -- to the mid --\nmiddle of the Warsaw, with the canals. And some of these guys told me, \u201cListen, if we go\nto the canal, the German drop their bomb [indecipherable] to the canal, we could be\nkilled. We have -- we prepare someplace in ghetto,\u201d -- because some building in ghetto\nstill exist, you know, ruins, but still exists. We have someplace, when we have water and\nsome food, we can go over there, put the -- destroy the entrance that ve waiting, because\nwe know the Russian was on the other side there. The oth-other side of the, you know,\nriver, of the Visla river. And to stay we\u2019ll be waiting, Russian come right away. Thought,\nwho knows when the Russian coming? We don\u2019t expect. And then, all of -- all these\npeople we got together to the mid-town. And I remember something, because one of\nthese people was engineer, he was waking -- working before the war was second in the --\nin this sir -- sir -- sewer institution, you know, on -- in Warsaw, and he thought -- I know\nthey can\u2019t answer very good, and he help us to go to this canal. This his worl -- worl --\nhis trip was much longer what regular, but much more safeky. And this the reason there\nwas [indecipherable].

In this restaurant the windows was covered\nwith sandbags, and then was the people which survive from this hospital, they bring to\nthis restaurant. Was a one cell -- I don\u2019t remember how many people -- was no more like\n10 - 15 people in this one room, you know, wounded. And -- and if I remember only was\nSunday, this I remember, and I remember that this Sunday, the -- the Germans start very\nhard bombing the -- this area, the whole old town, because was in old town. And then I\nstay up and I talk to the friends of mine that listen, we have to maybe try to go to the --\nunder the church because it\u2019s a very strong building. This time I cannot walk, but they\ngive me, you know, now they -- piece of wood, you know, with a little bit cut what I put\nunder th -- my arm, and I use this wood and my left leg. In this moment, what I se -- I\nremember only onet. I have seen the orange color only, I never -- no noise, no nothing,\nand I see the orange -- very orange color, and was finish, I was unconscious, I don\u2019t know\nwhat happened.

She open\nme, you know, that I see the light, and I have the a -- then she call for the help, they\ncome, the people, and remove me from this. When they remove me from this place, I was\ncompletely without cloth, nothing, everything was take out from me. I was completely\nlike a newborn, and I -- my body was a violet color.",
        "A: No -- everything stay -- I don\u2019t know, because everything was out. What was else? When\n-- first moment when I wake up, I know that I have in my pocket gun, that I told to\nmyself I would be -- I would die here, this 1s only one [indecipherable] that when I shoot\nmyself, I kill myself. I would be n -- I would be short story, would be -- not stay like this.\nBut I was in this position that I cannot move hand, nor move nothing, because I was\ncompletely cover, you know, with bricks, with dust, with everything. And when I -- when\nthey -- when they find me, when I said I was completely -- all clothes, all documents,\neverything was out, I have nothing on me. And later, 1t was in January or February -- no,\nfebru -- no, after the war was -- it was like in May, I think, they exhumated all bodies\nfrom -- because the places like this in Warsaw was plenty. They exhumated lot of places.\nOver there was my ver -- my very good friend who were over there. And I was told by\n[indecipherable] he -- he -- his wife told me that he was bed -- be -- that will be his\nfuneral in the church, that I went to this church. This time, th -- when they exhumated\nthese bodies was I don\u2019t remember, six or seven bodies, was six or seven casket, one of\nthe top the \u2018nother one, in one church was one mass, and one funeral for these all people.\nAnd on each casket was their name and their all information. And I was for this funeral,\nbecause this George who you know, you [indecipherable] he was over there. And after I\nwas sick, I feel very bad, and I was a little bit late that I stay on the end in the church, that\nwas fuel -- full with the people. And then come to me the one girl, and she take from my\nhand and bring to me to the -- to the casket. I thought -- was a surprise because she know\nme very well, my name and everything, and she -- the name they -- and because her\nboyfriend was killed over there between these people, and I saw, hey, this is everything\ncorrect. My -- they put my name, my date of birth, and my father\u2019s name, because was a\nRussian medal, they have to put the father name. Everything was over there, was mine,\nthat\u2019s me. That when I find this I went later to the Red Cross, and I start discuss with the\nRed Cross that -- that it was whole big discussion, because they thought listen, the story\nwas close, why you bothered us? You know, the person was buried, everything is\nfinished, and you start open the case again?",
        "A: And the result, you know, I get -- they give me these documents, and they opened the\ndocuments, and they find these documents because I\u2019ve [indecipherable] they find the --\nthe -- you know, the doc -- all documents in red color, they find this document, and this\ndocument what I bring here, down from the Red Cross in Warsaw what I get. And\nbecause was -- the house was buried -- the -- the -- bombed, and tof -- was fired, this\nreason, that this document was like a few months, or few weeks -- few months in the -- in\nthe building, and this -- there is under -- was in this condition.",
        "A: What the --",
        "A: Yes, I just remember the orange flash and finish, and no more, and -- and I didn\u2019t know\nwhat happened less. I didn\u2019t -- did not, completely no idea. And only find -- I don\u2019t know\nhow long I was unconscious, I don\u2019t know how long they keep -- when they again --\nsomebody heard my voice and opened this.",
        "A: Oh, it was few months, because was during the uprising in the old town. It was the -- it\nwas August, approximately. It was not September yet, it was August, maybe eight --\nmaybe 20, maybe 25\" August, during the uprising, before you know, this -- when I was\n00 -- 00 -- ooldit -- when I was, you know, under the -- under the bombing, and then the\nfuneral, it was in \u201844, and funeral was in the -- when the -- was a Russian come, it was\nprobably in May, maybe a -- maybe April, maybe May \u201845.",
        "A: This was few -- nice few months.",
        "A: Seven or eight months, and the people even then exhumated the people, during this time\nthey can not recognize, you know, the --",
        "A: -- absolutely not. They find the body, they find the [indecipherable] was this -- that\u2019s it.\nWas impossible, you know, the thought -- you know, find what is the story.",
        "A: No, we -- we sabotage only -- because we have a -- the people which working on trains\nwill belong to organization and get us all information. We sabotage two type of train, the\nmilitary train with the soldiers, and the train with supply, with ammunition, with other\nsupply which went to the east front.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: We know exac -- we know exactly how it works. We -- before we sabotage the train, first\nwe went to the fute and check the -- find the area in which place we can blow the train.\nBecause I was engineer, I was very good t-train that I know, I have information from the\nsky. You know, we called from sky, from the -- from the -- what they drop us off, which\nplace was the best. Always the place to blow the train was a curve, when the train was on\nthe curve. Because when you blow on the curve the train, you blow the same time, two\nlines. That\u2019s mean you di -- di -- two -- because was two train, two direction there, you\nhave to blow that train this way, that you blow both direction, not one direction. The train\nwhich you blow has to the same time block the \u2018nother direction of the line. It was the\nwhole -- the most difficult combination. Then we find the place, that when we find the\nplace, we told the -- we ready to take care about this place. They told us okay, that the\nsame day was designed. For instance, one day, one approximately time, was designed in\ndifferent place, that mean different group the same -- get the same orders. And now, they\norga -- have connection with the -- with the time table of the train, they thought, listen,\nthis place when you find would be the train, this, this and this time, there will be the train\nwhich is going eastbound, or westbound, they told -- told us, they told this time, because\nthe -- the same day was explode the train different places. And sometimes you get the\ntrain from there, this oolopsoogen,, the vacation train, or other time you get the train for\nthe supply. You know, this was not the plan from us, it the plan from the schedule, you\nknow, what you can find this time. And they told us the train will be approximately this --\non this time, run.",
        "A: That\u2019s mean, you know, th -- they -- we know that that -- that train will be going over\nthere, will be blow. The train we make it two different way. In the beginning, we make\nexplosion. This way, the explosive material was start for explosion by the locomotive, in\nthe beginning, because we didn\u2019t have so much supply. That\u2019s mean we put the whole\nmaterial, prepare under the train, and the -- before the material was in the o -- some land\nwas all explosive for the start explosion. It was beginning. That\u2019s mean if something\nhappened, if would be wrong train, you don\u2019t have a choice, because was explosion\nautomatically. Fortunately we never have an accident in which we don\u2019t want. And later,\nwe get machine for explosion. Was a machine when you press down, you make electric\nexplosion. You know, that mean you explode that train which you want, in that time\nwhich you want.",
        "A: More -- not -- not only more effective, but you know, the first you have to calculate it, the\ntime, how long, you know, you have to calculate it the speed of the that train, because it -\n- you can poss -- if you maybe too -- too close that the locomotive passed the explosion,\nand would be the fourth or third, you know, car blow up. And you have to blow always\nthe locomotive, was more ecu -- effective.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. We have -- we have -- because for this action, usually go this way, that we\nworking in different ways, was three different ways. In the beginning, was a group like\nthree or four guys from our group only blow the -- make this action. Later, was action\nrequired more people that come the people, the people from the woods. That\u2019s mean we\ncoming like a specialist, and they come, they people which they [indecipherable |\nwatching for us. And we help him, and in this group was the Jewish people. In this group\nI met few times the Jewish people, because we make -- they was made arrangement and\nwe met in the place, and we didn\u2019t watch the face one [indecipherable] but you can find\nright away, you know. We have the -- the -- this Jewish people was in the woods, they\nwas.",
        "A: They -- they -- they talking, you know, because we talking, you know, they -- sometime\nthey thought we help a Jewish guy [indecipherable] they thought. Because the Jewish\npeople in this time in the partisan, what they thought was they were very valuable, you\nknow, when they fighting, because the worse -- worse -- if somebody -- fighter was the\nworse if he have family. The most active, and most valuable, was without family. The\nmost of us was single, was ne -- no married, you know, because married has a wife, got\nthe children, and who was single, you know, all the young kids what were fighting was\nsingle. We didn\u2019t have this -- this ballast, you know, for they -- for they remember about\nthe family. The problem [indecipherable] ours mothers.",
        "A: No, never. Never I have heard -- even I tell you. It was the additional -- two Akar was\ntwo different organization.

I give you -- maybe we\u2019re not taping this, but I tell you the \u2018nother story.

The guy was on the floor in one second. You\n-- you understand this? When he was -- the people help him right, but he was a chief, oh\nno.",
        "A: This is a good example, you know, how the all people, all people was tied together. Was\nnot enemies, was always was all the friends. But I talking the bo -- the armia ludova was\nnot -- they was not fighting, they didn\u2019t have a group in Warsaw, they have only the\nsmall group outside the Warsaw. Only one action with the armia ludova have said that\nwas belong to him, I was not sure -- it was -- I don\u2019t remember exactly, yeah, they bir --\nthey dropped few gra -- hand grenades to the cafeteria which was only for the German. It\nwas on the corner the allia zalinsky and nofisfiat, I don\u2019t remember the name of the\n[indecipherable]. And they dropped the bomb, you know, explosive that later was a big\nstory because for this, a -- grenades which didn\u2019t kill no Germans, just wounded few,\nthey probably kill few hundred of Polish people. One action -- what vogler was d -- was\ndone by the -- by the -- by the -- this armia ludova. You\u2019re talking about another\nsabotage. I have even here the article, I wouldn\u2019t to translated this, because what I told\nyou the -- the -- our job was cleaning the apartments, what I told you, that. Gestapo was\nso upset that they come to the room, apartment was clean, and sometime they fight with\nus because was -- we expect they coming, you know, they waiting one or two guys, and\nwe was coming big group, and -- you know, with good recognition. They bring small --\nsmall Panzer wagon. You know, the small Panzer wagon they prepare was not new, but\nwas used, and they bring to the harkapay.

It was like this, I was in this place up to the end, it\nwas \u201845 up to the end of the October, because in the end of the October, there was the\norder for the army, that all soldiers which have a -- have diploma on the Polytech\nInstitute, they has to be released from the army to finish his study. And he\u2019s doy -- was\nthe end of my experience with the army. And this time, I went to the Polytechnic\nInstitute, and I s-study. The study was not long time ago, because after approximately\ntwo or three weeks, three o\u2019clock in the morning was big knock to my doors. \u201cWake up,\nyou are mik -- ma -- Mieczyslaw Madejski?\u201d \u201cYes, I am.\u201d \u201cCome with us.\u201d They took\nme to the endcavoodare, to the -- to praga, to the city and metro district. Over there they\nput me to the nice room on the second floor -- on the main floor, you know, was like a --\nI was only one person in this building. I was still, you know, poor man, sick, in the\nmilitary uniform, because only wa -- everything was burned. Th -- what I have on in this\n-- they put me on the main floor to the building. Hey, I get a breakfast, I get the supper,\nvery good.

The guy told\nme the same. I didn\u2019t discuss too much, because I didn\u2019t know what the story. I know\nfrom the -- from the -- you know, the people told me, they always have the people, you\nknow, spy one each other. Was over there like a two days. After two day they take me for\ninterrogation, and they told me you belong to the Akar. No, I never belonged to the\nAkar, what is Akar?

He\ntold me, \u201cYou dummy.\u201d And hit me in my face, and I fall on the floor. That was\ndiscussion like this seven or eight days, every day. Sometimes 12 o'clock in the night,\nsometime bring me like a two o'clock in the morning, and they keep me to the four\no'clock in the morning next day, you know, sitting in the room, and only the guy -- one\nguy come, discuss with me five minutes, go away. After one hour comed another guy.\nThey asked me what your name, where you was born, and wa -- ran away, after two\nhours comed another guy. You know, there was method.

        "A: This was '40 -- '45 -- this was -- this happened with me in the -- like December '45.",
        "A: Yes, after -- it was -- because I was -- I live practically in Warsaw, and study over there\nin the woods, you know, the condition over there, no money, no food, no apartment. I\nsleep on the doors, you know, because friend of mine have one room, and we were few\nguys, and we have a doors, we open that -- take doors off from the hinges and sleep on\nthe doors.",
        "A: I have a lot of friends in Warsaw, I was born -- and one day was visiting a friend of mine,\nand she was the friend of -- she was friend of this my friend, they met over there.",
        "A: Yes, they were enjoyed together.

This time, we was looking one each\nother, who has the same mind, we have the same viewpoint for the politic -- for the\npoliticking -- for the politician, you know, what is going on. Because we know from\nexperience that some -- in some family that men was belong to the party, was a\nCommunist, the wife was not, and there was the whole discussion. There was no smooth\nfamily -- was no different the family, we know about this.",
        "A: My -- this time my father was -- when I me-met her, my father was very sick, he has a\ncancer, and approximately two months, I think, when I met her, he passed away. That we\nmarried like after one and a half year.",

I have experience about the\nCommunisms from my father, what I told you that he sent me to the school, and he taught\nme about the 1920 lot, about the World War trip, and how he survived. And he taught me\nthat Communist is a system. That system, that\u2019s mean in the beginning they have to\nexplain all poor people -- all poor people that everything what is wrong, this is because\nthe rich people. They taught me -- my father taught me, when every people will have the\nsame, you know, level, they thought the blonde people are nice, and the people which\nhave a black head are no good. And when there will be -- when they went all people,\nchanged their color, the people which have a -- his nails on the finger cut around, are\ndifferent if you point them this way, have a in the edge are different. Always this system\nhas to find we'll be fighting one people against another one. We thought, as long this\nsystem exist, then there will be no quiet in the bed when the people, the people will be\nfighting. And this was not quiet, because I never belonged to the -- any party\norganization. I never was s -- never told that I belonged to the AK. And I always was on\nthe bottom th -- level. I was working for the factory in Poland, I was engineer, that I was -\n- I supposed to be like a chief engineer, but they thought you have to belong to the party.\nNo, no, I am not interesting, that I -- I did this job, but I was never nominated, because\nnomination can be done only by the -- by the Communistic party, by the -- you know, this\nwas the different level of the Communistic party, and I never belong and I always was\ndown that I thought I cannot live this system, I have enough. Additional, the teacher of\nmy son, which you met him, was belong to AK. We know one each other, and he\nthought, \u201cListen, he will never go to any university, no way, because his background is\nvery bad.\u201d But fortunately, in Poland, was a allinpee game, you know, like a science\ngame, and he win this game in physics and mathematics. And then the reason that he can\ngo to the Polytechnical University without examp -- without points, you know. You need\nthe points, if you worker you have five points, if you in prison you have negative five\npoints, or zero points. And he thought -- I very glad that he win, because he to -- able\ncome to university. But this time we get the passport for my son, for myself, because he\nhave five months vacation. And this time we come to United State, and it was 25 years\nago, and we stay here. And my wife was in Poland, and later she get a passport. You\nknow, this is the \u2018nother -- additional big story first of money, then involvement. She\nwent to Austria for two weeks, get a passport, and from Austria she arrive here. Because\nher family, all -- her family, her sister, and her two brothers was in this country already.",
