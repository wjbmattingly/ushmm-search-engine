        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Peter Masters, conducted by Esther Finder on August\n7\", 1998, in Bethesda, Maryland. This is a follow-up interview that will focus on\nMr. Master\u2019s post-Holocaust experiences. In preparation for this interview I\nlistened to the interview conducted with the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History\nFoundation on November 10\" of 1996. I also reviewed your book. I will not ask\nyou to repeat everything you said in that interview, instead I will use this interview\nas an opportunity to follow up on that interview and focus on your post-Holocaust\nexperiences. This is tape number one, side A. I\u2019d like to ask you when you were\nborn and where.",
        "Answer: I wa \u2014I was born on the fifth of February, 1922 in Vienna, Austria.",
        "Q: And what was your name at birth?",
        "A: My name was Peter Ferdinand Arany, a-r-a-n-y.",
        "Q: When did you change your name?",
        "A: My name was changed by war office order on joining the commandos in 1942, I\nbelieve.",
        "Q: Did you ever think of going back and using your original name?",
        "A: Of the 86 people who were in my troop, I know of three who changed \u2014 who \u2014\nwho took their old name back. Most of us got used to the new names and identities\nAugust 7, 1998\nvery quickly and we \u2014 we looked upon this, unless we were attached to the former\nname, unless they were ancient family names, or this or that, the motivation to go\nback to the original name didn\u2019t exist for many of us.",
        "Q: What languages did you speak in 1945?",
        "A: What name?",
        "Q: What languages?",
        "A: What languages. Well, I was born w \u2014 my \u2014 my original language was the\nAustrian version of German, which incidentally has always been a little bone of\ncontention between Germans and Austrians. Austrians feel that the only correct and\nproper German is spoken in Austria, and different parts of Germany make the\nsame claim. Hamburg, for instance, han \u2014 Hannover, they think that\u2019s \u2014 they also\nthink that the claims by the others are absurd, and \u2014 and funny. I learnt a little\nFrench as a small child, we had a French teacher, a Madame come to the apartment\nand \u2014 and purportedly teach us French, my sister and myself. It didn\u2019t really work,\ndidn\u2019t go much beyond \u201cFr\u00e9re Jacques.\u201d And we didn\u2019t really like her; that didn\u2019t\nhelp. And \u2014 however, when \u2014 in my school system, we took a fir \u2014 a foreign\nlanguage from the age of 11, and I chose French. The teacher who taught French\nalso taught German and was the fore-master of my class. So he was the\nadministrative, disciplinary head of that class. And he wa \u2014 turned out to be one of\nthe well known arch-Nazis of Vienna. A published author, who when the Austrian\nAugust 7, 1998\nwriters club, the Pen Club, the International Pen Club, Austrian branch sent a\ntelegram to their Jewish colleagues in Germany to express their sympathy upon\ntheir book burning and treatment, there were two Austrian authors who refused to\nsign the otherwise unanimous declaration, and he was one of them. I got barely\npassing grades in German, which was my best subject, and I switched to the English\nclass because of him. Solely because of him. So I had four years of high school\nEnglish and I thought I spoke fluent English. That was disillusioned fairly quickly\nupon arrival in England, but I could get by fairly well. I learned a little Spanish\nbefore I left. This was really emigration learning other things type of thing. But I\ndon\u2019t think there was enough of it to have any impact.",
        "Q: Where were you on V-E day, when victory was declared in Europe?",
        "A: Victory in Europe. I\u2019m trying to think. The \u2014 the \u2014 strangely perhaps, the impact\nwas not enormous on us because we had felt pretty solidly that we had won, so the \u2014\nthe fact of the \u2014 of it becoming official was relatively minor. The date, if I recall,\nwas May \u2014 May eight, May eight. At May eight, I believe I was in cadet school in\nEngland, and there was a little bit of razzmatazz of people celebrating, cheering,\nwhat have you. And it \u2014 I think many of the cadets thought that now they were more\nlikely to go to the Orient than before. And that concerned me only marginally\nbecause I thought the British would surely send me somewhere where my fluent\nGerman would make sense. I \u2014 I made some halfhearted efforts to get sent to\nAugust 7, 1998\nAustria because that would have interested me, and besides, being to Germany for\nthe first time ever, during the fighting, and I had a distaste for going to Germany.\nSome of our people were there and sort of lived it up in occupation, but didn\u2019t\nattract me. The \u2014 the \u2014 the problem as to \u2014 who was and who wasn\u2019t a Nazi and so\non had already come up when \u2014 when we were fighting in Germany. And I was\ntold that chances of getting to Austria were minimal because they were being\nsupplied from central Mediterranean forces, meaning from Italy, whereas\nGermany was being supplied by personnel from northwest Europe, from \u2014 from\nour end. Th-The \u2014 the army has its own ways and when it came up, where I did go\nwas West Africa.",
        "Q: Before I have you going to West Africa, can you tell me, in May of 1945, what\nwas your rank, and what \u2014 what action had you seen during the war.",
        "A: St-Starting at the beginning, when I was in the Pioneer corps, I was a private and\nI saw no chance of ever getting promoted to anything, because I was just one of the\nyounger lads who was unloading trains or testing bridging material and so on. And I\n\u2014I wasn't one of the boot polisher and button polishers, so I \u2014 I wasn't a standout to\nthe people on the parade ground by any means. In-In fact, I was a bit of a\nnonconformist [indecipherable]. I was more likely to get in trouble about\nsomething than I was to get promoted. So, when I came to the commandos, just\nprior to D-Day, I was made a lance corporal, which was a big deal. It \u2014 it\u2019s nothing\nAugust 7, 1998\nreally, but as such I was the second in command of my detachment, a five man\nteam, attached to number six commando, we were number 10 commando at-\nattaching teams to eight different commandos for D-Day. So, I was a lance corporal\nand was subsequently promoted to be a corporal in the field, which caused a little\nargument because I said to my colleague and sergeant, who said, I\u2019m making you a\ncorporal and I said, you know, jokingly, want me to stitch on an extra stripe here in\n\u2014 in the front line? And he said, you\u2019re damn right. And I said I\u2014 you \u2014 you mean\nyou have the authority to make me a paid corporal? And he said, who said anything\nabout paid? And I came back as a corporal, largely because one of our detachments\nhad been wiped out and I became a one man detachment. When I came back I was\npromoted to sergeant and when we went out to Holland and Germany again, I was\na sergeant. And it was then that one of our own, who had been \u2014 who \u2014 who had\nbecome the commanding officer of our detachments, Kurt Gowza(ph) who served\nunder the name of James Griffith, wanted to send me to cadet school. And I said,\nat this stage, it\u2019s late in the war, do you think it\u2019s worthwhile? And I don\u2019t want to\ndo the parade square bashing and \u2014 and \u2014 and pamphlet bullshitting, I just don\u2019t\nwant to do it. And he persuaded me to do it, with the help of the brigade major, Sir\nMaxwell Hopagow(ph). He \u2014 they \u2014 they li \u2014 I wanted to talk to the brigadier, if \u2014\nif \u2014 if a commission then happened in the field, Montgomery was against\ncommissions in the field unless from dire need, casualties, because he said it leads\nAugust 7, 1998\nto fraternization through the enlisted men. Which we thought was just fine, and he\napparently as a [indecipherable] thought was in \u2014 improper. This is sort of regular\narmy smokiness, you know, and \u2014 and he s \u2014 he stopped quite \u2014 quite a few of us\ngot commissions 1n the field because they were doing a good job. And I \u2014 I fairly\nlikely m-might have gotten one, but when I was transferred from one unit to the\nother, I had to start from square one to build my reputation of being keen and\ndetermined and willing to do anything and so on. Which I did. And it led to the 1 \u2014\nthe notion of going to cadet school. I went to cadet school, and I must say I had a\nball. The fact that I\u2014 I m \u2014 I remember arriving and there were a whole bunch of\nyoungsters out of \u2014 out of school who were going to cadet school and they were\nstudying pamphlets. And they ask questions from the pamphlets and I had no idea\nwhat th-the answers were, b-but I said, I don\u2019t know the name of the plunger of the\n\u2014 this weapon, but we had a rather specialized version of that weapon for a special\noperation. Then suddenly everybody is listening and they want to know. Well, when\nit came to the tests, the same thing happened. Some \u2014 some weapon sergeant would\nask questions and say, ask me about the Sten gun. I said, Sten gun was not a\ncommando weapon, we used Thompsons, which are a higher quality. And the only\nSten gun I\u2019ve ever seen was one \u2014 a special one for an operation with a silencer. He\nsaid, a\u2014 a Sten with a silencer? I\u2019ve never seen one. Tell me about it. I said, P'\ndraw you a picture. And we talked about the Sten with the silencer for the rest of\nAugust 7, 1998\nthe examination. He said, I assume you were a weapons instructor. I said, I\u2019m not\nsupposed to comment. You abandon your rank when you are a \u2014 a cadet. But some\nlance corporal who was \u2014 had the job of taking the stripes off, relished to take a\nsergeants stripes off, you see, so he had slashed the sleeve of my best uniform and\nthere were cuts where my stripes had been. And the weapon instructor sergeant who\nwas doing the testing assumed \u2014 he could see I\u2019d been a sergeant by \u2014 by the cuts on\nmy arm. Well, I \u2014 I breezed through this whole thing like nobody\u2019s business and\nthen \u2014 then came to cadet school, and there I was quite determined to be a\nnonconformist and a rebel when nonsense was being talked about, you know,\npamphlet stuff, and \u2014 which often is \u2014 is outdated and \u2014 and \u2014 and has been written,\nwho knows for whom, and \u2014 and I would \u2014 I would say \u2014 well, for instance a\nquestion. What use is the Bren gun carrier? Hands go up and the cadets \u2014 the cadet\nkept asking questions, you see. And they said, to carry out flanking attacks, and\nsomebody else said something else, and when it was my turn, I said none. The Bren\ngun carrier is no use. I have seen more burnt out Bren gun carriers than \u2014 than non-\nburned out Bren gun carriers. It\u2019s a little [indecipherable] not enough armament.\nAnd I said, it is useful possibly for two things, which is to bring up the tea after\nbattle, or if you have nothing and want to fake like you have armor, you run them\noff somewhere where nobody can see them and the enemy will think you\u2019re coming\nwith a lot of tanks, because they make such a racket that they inevitably get shot at\nAugust 7, 1998\nand \u2014 and \u2014 and then that\u2019s when they burn. And the instructor said, th-that Masters\nis absolutely right, because he had just come back from Italy himself, so he knew\nwhat I am saying is true, you see? So \u2014 so after awhile I found out wasn\u2019t that much\n\u2014I mean, I wa \u2014 it wasn\u2019t working the way I had thought. I \u2014 I thought I'd be a\nrebel and I found the management agreed with me. Which was in a way, of course,\na big help and gratifying and so I graduated very high in my class, and that\u2019s the\nend of that one. Tha \u2014 you asked me what rank I was when I graduated. I was, of\ncourse, a second lieutenant and was subsequently promoted during my service in\nAfrica, aut \u2014 almost automatically to first lieutenant and then my time was up. Six\nyears. It was age plus length of service in the British army. So my number was up\nand I \u2014 somebody wanted me to stay as an instructor at the school of infantry and I\nsaid thank you but no thank you. Why not? Well, I said, In \u2014I-\u2014I-\u2014TI relish the\nillusion of freedom, that I can go wherever I want, whenever I want and not be sent.\nI\u2019ve been sent for a number of years now. So even bef \u2014 realizing it\u2019s an illusion,\nenough.",
        "Q: While you were serving in Europe, did you have the opportunity to visit or to\nsee any of the concentration camps or labor camps?",
        "A: Never saw one. Some of \u2014 few of us did. This really depended on what unit you\nwere with, and \u2014 and \u2014 and chance. And you have to bear in mind, commandos\nwere essentially assault units. And then they \u2014 th-the \u2014 the people in charge always\nAugust 7, 1998\nstretched what was an initial assault way beyond our normal role, because we didn't\nhave heavy support weapons, you know. But they had us, so they kept us. And if\nyou didn\u2019t happen \u2014 well, it \u2014 it just so happened that no concentrat-tration camp\nwas in the path of where they wanted a \u2014 a-a-a \u2014 an assault made. These were\nusually river crossings that they used us for, after the \u2014 the initial landings at \u2014 on\nD-Day or in Italy or in Sicily or in Holland. So, one of our people of course, as you\nknow, heard his parents might be alive in Terezin and went to \u2014 to go \u2014 go get\nthem, and succeeded. That was extremely gratifying. None of us, the rest of us even\nhave the slightest opportunity to do that.",
        "Q: When the war in Europe was over, did you make any attempts to find people\nthat were left behind in Vienna, when you had left?",
        "A: I didn't understand that.",
        "Q: When the war was over, did you make any attempts to find any family or friends\nthat were left behind in Vienna?",
        "A: Orndorf(ph), yes. It seemed hopeless the immediate family insofar as they have\nnot gotten out. We knew that my \u2014 my \u2014 my grandfather was murdered in\nAuschwitz and we knew that were a number of distant relatives had \u2014 had \u2014 had\nperished. And other than looking for individual friends here and there, and \u2014 and fi\n\u2014 si\u2014later finding some, not very much finding materialized. There were things like\ngetting in touch again with people who had gone to Israel. Friends. Getting in touch\nAugust 7, 1998\nagain with such people as my kinderfraulein, my nanny in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 who had\nbeen in Austria throughout the war. In fact, we invited her to come and visit in\nLondon, and that was very exciting. So, not much in the way of \u2014 of finding people\nthat had \u2014 that had disappeared. There were some weird things. My \u2014 my mother\nlived in an apartment in London and once went to a neighbor to borrow some\nwrapping paper for a package she had to make in a hurry. And the woman said,\nwell, I have this one, you can turn it over, it\u2019s used. And on the reverse side were\nnames and addresses of my father\u2019s nephew \u2014 two of my father\u2019s nephews in New\nYork. Since my parents were divorced, my mother never pursued that. And I tried\nmuch later to see what I could find it, found some people by this un \u2014 very unusual\nname in \u2014 in the telephone directory and called them up and they said, it\u2019s just a\nname we call our firm, and there\u2019s no one here by that name. But, it went off into\nthe sand, nothing happened. Of course, you know, people still appear nowadays\nhere and there, and that could theoretically happen. My \u2014 I \u2014 \u2019m-\u2014I\u2019m still looking\nfor some of my classmates and when I came to Europe I used to read the telephone\nbooks wherever I was, to see what I could find. And sometimes I\u2019d find a name and\nsometimes I\u2019d pursue it and call up for some classmate or other, and not find them\nat home, or in the country or something. And it never really led anywhere. If I came\nback a few years later and looked in the phone book again, maybe a name was\nmissing and I assumed the person died, or moved. So it \u2014 not \u2014 not \u2014 not very much.\nAugust 7, 1998\nAnd by now, anyone older than I is likely to be dead. I mean, purely, technically,\nyou know, you \u2014 I-I\u2019m 76 years old. If I start thinking in terms of people who were\nolder \u2014 substantially older, 86 years old, how many are there, you know? So you \u2014\nyou find that \u2014 that some of this is \u2014 is quite \u2014 quite hopeless. When I was in\nLondon just now, a friend of mine whom I haven\u2019t seen since 1940-something,\nactually came from Munich to spend the day with me and we talked all day long\nabout the old times. He was especially good friend. I would never have \u2014 I would\nnever have recognized him in \u2014 in the street, or [indecipherable]. And \u2014 but \u2014 but\nwe had so many common memories that there was no shortage of material to talk\nabout.",
        "Q: Before I ask you about your service in Africa, which I will do in a minute, I\nwanted to ask you, when did you realize the full extent of the genocide in Europe?",
        "A: This is a question I \u2014 that 1s very difficult, and I have asked myself that, because\nno \u2014 many atime still, it\u2019s very, very hard to answer, because the fact that people\nwere being killed became known almost immediately. And by that I mean the\nanschluss was in 12\" of March 1938. At that time people were arbitrarily arrested.\nThe brutality in Austria was much more immediate than the gradual tightening of\nthe noose in Germany. Which of course was a good thing, except if it happened to\nyou. A good thing in that it scared you into action, which it didn\u2019t do for many\npeople in Germany, because it just got a little worse all the time. Well, in Austria\nAugust 7, 1998\nthe brutality was immediate and many people said, let\u2019s get out of here and \u2014 a \u2014 or,\nany border, quick. And not enough people said that and \u2014 and \u2014 but \u2014 but those who\ndid benefited from that scenario. Oh, people were arrested and in the beginning one\nasked naively, why were they arrested. And then there were some black humor\njests. They were arrested because they had eggs for breakfast. You know, the people\nwere still joking about this sort of thing. And then some of these neighbors or\nfriends who had been arrested, actually were released. And some of them were in\nvery poor condition, having been beaten and goodness knows what. So\n[indecipherable] became aware that people were being tortured or beaten. And\nthen in some cases one heard that the family received an urn with ashes, saying,\nshot while trying to escape. Well, shot while trying to escape. If this was some very\npeaceable neighbor, you know \u2014 knew them well, that this was not a man who was\ngoing to escape from \u2014 from benevolent detention. So there began to materialize a\ncertain awe of, are they coming for me, if they\u2019re coming for me, what will happen\nto me? Are they coming for my relatives? Should one work more actively on getting\nout, and \u2014 and so on. And this is \u2014 was a gradually increasing image, and I have a\nmemory. I haven\u2019t researched this, but I have a memory that there \u2014 I went to the\nmovies once in England, and there was a movie \u2014 there\u2019s \u2014 there was a group, you\nknow, like the Stoogies, called The Crazy Gang. Funny people in \u2014 you know, in \u2014\nin \u2014 movie comedians. And the thing was called, The Crazy Gang ina\nAugust 7, 1998\nConcentration Camp. Now, that\u2019s appalling, isn\u2019t it? I mean, I \u2014 I \u2014 I suppose in a\nway some of this Stalag 17 series became from a serious film into a TV series that\nwas humorous. It was a comical German and y-y-you remember that thing? Well,\nThe Crazy Gang in the Concentration Camp. One should really try and fish that out\nand look at it and see how \u2014 how appalling it \u2014 it might well be. But it shows you\nthe scenario that some people who were aware of the fact that there are\nconcentration camps thought it was a subject matter for a comical film. Now\n[indecipherable] seen from this end of \u2014 of \u2014 of history or time. So, what I\u2019m using\nit for here 1s to illustrate the unawareness of some, how real and how serious it was,\nand yet the awareness of others, but \u2014 but shout it in an ominous [indecipherable]\nof \u2014 of nothing, behind which you could not look. And that built and built and built\nand built until 1t became a fu-full awareness. When, I cannot put a date on that.\nThen there \u2014 there were stories, and I don\u2019t remember any more whether we heard\nthem then or later, of the man who tried to make \u2014 make the \u2014 the \u2014 the British awa\n\u2014 government aware \u2014 or first of all, tried to make his Jewish neighborhoods in\nPoland aware and went from village to village saying, Juden es brennt. And\nnobody believed him.",
        "Q: Can you translate that for me?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: Would you please translate that for me?\nAugust 7, 1998",
        "A: Oh, Jews \u2014 there\u2019s fire, 1t\u2019s burning. And \u2014 and this 1s \u2014 there were people who\nwere lobbying and \u2014 and trying to communicate bec \u2014 an-and \u2014 and \u2014 and failed, at\nthe Evian Conference, you \u2014 I\u2019m sure you knew. There were good people trying to\nget the government to do something. Now, some governments did do something.\nThe British government passed a bill in 10 minutes to let 10,000 children come to\nBritain. The same bill was on the floor of Congress and never got off the floor.\nUlterior motives, indifference, take your pick. Politics.",
        "Q: You did some part of your military service in Africa. Can you tell me what your\nduties and responsibilities were in \u2014 in Africa and what memories you have of that\npart of your service?",
        "A: Well, first of all, I had an attitude, which said, as Kurt Vonnegut says,\nunexpected opportunities to travel are dancing lessons from God. And I would\nnever have gotten to Africa, to West Africa in normal circumstances in my life.\nAnd I really relished the idea. So there was a shipload of \u2014 of young officers who\nwere to go to Africa, amusingly, on a ship called the Jan Sobieski. That doesn\u2019t\nmean anything to you, but Jan Sobieski was a king of Poland who was responsible\nfor the relief of Vienna from the Turkish siege. He came with the Polish cavalry\nand relieved fa \u2014 Vienna and \u2014 and saved western civilization, from what was\nprobably a superior civilization of the Turks but we are \u2014 haven\u2019t gotten to admit\nthat yet. They had social services far adva \u2014 in advance of what western civilization\nAugust 7, 1998\nhad. Well, the \u2014 the \u2014 that \u2014 th-there in \u2014 in the \u2014 1n the lounge was this great big\nportrait of Jan Sobieski and I was the only passenger on that ship who knew who it\nwas. We went to Africa and the purpose to send us was to train native troops as aid\nto civil power. Because the British had not yet decided to relinquish the empire.\nAnd in case they decided to hang onto the empire, they needed military support,\nideally from the local population, hopefully. Well, we didn\u2019t ever say that. What we\nwere doing 1s we were training native troops to wipe out remaining pockets of\nJapanese resistance in remote parts of the world. You know, there were Japanese\nsoldiers who were holed up on some Pacific island, I mean, Oriental \u2014 in the\nAleutian islands, wherever, and who either hadn\u2019t heard that they had surrendered\n20 years previously, or \u2014 well, at that time not 20 years. And every now and again\none of them would come out. Well, we were training our people to \u2014 our \u2014 our\nnative Ghanaians -- before there was a Ghana [indecipherable] to wipe out these\npockets of fanatic resistance. But what we were really doing 1s training them, you\nsee, to civil power. And I was greatly helped by my attitude, I really liked them.\nAnd they really liked me. They had nicknames for everybody. I was called\nlieutenant aero-plane driver. That was because I wore parachute wings, which \u2014 for\nwhich I had qualified, and they saw wings and they though wings must be an aero-\nplane, and what do you do with an aero-plane? You drive it. So I was lieutenant\naero-plane driver. And I talked to them, which many did not. And found it most\nAugust 7, 1998\ninstructive, the different philosophy, just beginning to be materialistic, but by and\nlarge, not materialistic. No work ethic. Now, you have to picture that. We are so\nsteeped into our work ethic that we say, if you are industrious you will be rewarded.\nThey say, do-do \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t make work. If things grow by themselves, then sow\nthem and then go and harvest them, but you don\u2019t have to work in between.",

[break] \u2014 uation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Peter Masters. This is tape one, side B. Okay,\nwe\u2019re back and you were telling me about your experiences in Africa and you were\ntalking about the work ethic.",
        "A: Yes, well, the \u2014 the Africans were really just beginning in \u2014 1-1n that area. I\nmean, the present \u2014 the Africans would resent my saying some of these things\nbecause they want to be contemporary, modern people. And that\u2019s fine, although\none can\u2019t help but deplore losing certain things. For instance, the most important\nthing to the men was to talk. They would sit under a shady tree and talk and talk and\ntalk. And that was not something that you would say they are lazy and good for\nnothing. No, they were doing an important thing, they were talking. It\u2019s true that \u2014\nthat that meant more work for the women, but the tradition of that, I guess is so\nancient that it \u2014 it isn\u2019t a thing where you had the feeling that there\u2019s going to be a\nfeminist movement saying let the women sit and talk, let the men carry the logs.\nAugust 7, 1998\nYou know, it is a peculiar \u2014 a peculiar attitude that said \u2014 that admired certain\nthings. I can give you some sample conversations that are favorites of mine. That\nthe European or American countries is showing off too, what they can perceive to\nbe a primitive culture. And so you show them a picture of the Golden Gate bridge.\nAnd they say mm, fine bridge. And then comes a little noise, that you learn to hear.\nIt is ah. It\u2019s just a little doubt in the admiration. And they say, this bridge, fine\nbridge. What 1s it for? A very basic question. You say well, it\u2019s so people,\nobviously, can get from one side to the other. Ah, of course. Ah, why do the people\nfrom one side want to go on the other side? Well, some people work on one side\nand live on the other. Ah, ah yeah. There\u2019s no work on the other side. I said, yes,\nthere \u2014 there is work on the other side, but some of them \u2014 and so it goes. And then\nI say, well, you\u2019re giving me a hard time because obviously they are leading me on,\nyou see. You build bridges, you have bridges for \u2014 so, I mean, this is just a\u2014a\nbigger bridge. Yeah, fine bridge. Ah, how long it take to build this bridge? How\nmuch did it cost? Well, they have you, you know, I mean th-the \u2014 then \u2014 you now\nwould have to demonstrate that it is economically worthwhile to build all our\nbridges and that it pays, and \u2014 and \u2014 and that it\u2019s \u2014 makes more sense than \u2014 and so\non and so on and so on and so on. And this goes on and now I offer you \u2014 imagine\nwhat happened when one of the young officers committed suicide. British officers.\nFar away from home for the first time, unhappy, hot climate, who knows? I was the\nAugust 7, 1998\nmentor because I was the one they \u2014 that talked to them. So the natives gathered\naround me and said, why? And I said, he had \u2014 he was lonely, he had few friends.\nYou\u2019re not his friend? I said yes, I tried to be his friend, but he was unapproachable,\nI couldn\u2019t get to him. How is he better now than he was when he was lonely? I\u2019m\ngetting into theology here or whatever, you see, I mean I\u2014 so I say \u2014 I\ncounterattack. I said, there\u2019s nobody ever committed suicide here, your people?\nThat caused a huddle and a long discussion and then they came back and said,\nmaybe two people \u2014 no, maybe one lot of people, and then another person. And I\nsaid, when you mean \u2014 when \u2014 when you say a lot of people \u2014 well, long time ago,\nthe story, king died. King had 40 wives. Wives were singing pious songs and\nwalked into a swamp, to accompany the soul of dead king. Don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s\ntrue. Is that suicide? I said, well, I suppose so, I don\u2019t know. What\u2019s the other one?\nThere was this crazy woman, and some people say she jumped into a well, deep\nwell, died. Some people say somebody pushed her into the well. Some people say\nshe fell into the well. But some people say jumped into the well. That\u2019s the only one\nwe can think of. And I said, well what does a person do who 1s very unhappy? You\nca \u2014 you can\u2019t tell me everybody\u2019s happy all the time. Oh, he go for bush. That\nmeans into the jungle. Maybe drink some palm wine. Go to sleep. Wake up,\neverything fine. Not bad. You see? So \u2014 so \u2014 so Pm \u2014 I\u2019m -\u2014I\u2019m literally learning in\nmany ways, because we are so assuming that in our self righteousness that what we\nAugust 7, 1998\ndo is absolutely the only way, and in a way it explains that when \u2014 when \u2014 when\nslavery used some of these very places as a source, and transposed forcibly people\nwho did not have a work ethic and suddenly told them they had to work God knows\nwhat hours, that it was very tempting to say they are good for nothing and lazy. And\nthey were not good for nothing and lazy, we were stupid. And now all over the\nworld everybody\u2019s sins are coming home to roost. The British empire has fallen\napart and they are all coming to Britain and \u2014 and they used to sneer at the United\nStates for having racial problems, and they\u2019ve been relatively quiet recently. They \u2014\nit\u2019s not a question of racial problems, it\u2019s [indecipherable] at the bottom layer\nobjects cheap labor force coming in and so on and so on and so on.",
        "Q: Were you ever asked to serve in Palestine by either the British army or by\nJewish Palestinians?",
        "A: Well, in a word yes. Not-Not \u2014 not \u2014 not that specifically. I had a\u2014as a\nspecialist, and a \u2014 a fluent German speaker trained in the German armed forces, my\nlast attachment was with all Marine commandoes and the colonel, who was a great\nsoldier, was quite fond of me and after the war we had a drink at the Army-Navy\nclub in London. He introduced me to some retired Marine general and \u2014 who \u2014 who\ntold me how fortunate I was that I had the honor and privilege to serve with Marines\n\u2014 Marine commandos. And the colonel a-asked, what are you doing now? And I\nsaid, I\u2019m going to art school, because I \u2014 that\u2019s was \u2014 I was going to be a di \u2014\nAugust 7, 1998\ngraphic designer. And he said, lord bless my soul, whatever for? And I said, I want\nto be a graphic designer. He said, well, if you are stuck for anything \u2014 for something\nto do, I am taking up my post as inspector general of the Palestine police, and I \u2014\nthere\u2019Il always be a job for you. I said, thank you very much sir. And my mother\nhad mentioned that to a visiting friend from Israel, my th \u2014 as a son of my\ngrandfather\u2019s partner. And he said \u2014 she \u2014 she \u2014 she mentioned the colonel first of\nall, before all this took place. And he said he won\u2019t live long. And I said \u2014 my\nmother said, good heavens, why? And he said, well we have very \u2014 engaged in a\nwar to shake British domination of \u2014 of \u2014 of what is promised us under the Balfour\nDeclaration. And sh \u2014 if he is in charge of the Palestine police then 1-is \u2014 there is\nsomething very close to total war between us. And so a few days later this\nconversation I had at the Army-Navy club was reported to him and he said, he\nshould take it. And my mother was outraged, she said, you just said that the man\nhe\u2019d be working with isn\u2019t \u2014 may not live long and now you want my son to be in\nthat position? And he said, it might be very useful to have somebody in there. And\nmy mother said, but you said it\u2019s very dangerous. And he said, dane \u2014 what\u2019s\ndangerous? Walks across Piccadilly and a tile falls off a roof and kill you. That\u2019s\ndangerous. But Mother was not convinced, and \u2014 and 1-1-1t didn\u2019t happen. Now, it\u2019s\nalso true that there were services annually, memorial services, what have you, in\nWestminster Abbey and so on. And my \u2014 some of my fr \u2014I didn't attend any,\nAugust 7, 1998\nmaybe one, I can\u2019t remember. And a\u2014 some of my friends told me they went to it\nand as they came out there were people on either side of the entrance saying psst,\ncome here, I want to talk to you. And apparently they were recruiting. The \u2014 the\nIsraelis were recruiting, that is the \u2014 the Irgun, or whoever, or the Stern gang, or I\n\u2014I don\u2019t know. And on the other side the Arabs were recruiting, because they were\nrecruiting for the Arab legion and for what have you. And one of the commando\ncolonels came to command the Arab legion, Brigadier Young, whom I knew well in\nNormandy and \u2014 and so you see, there were both sides, very weird for \u2014 for\ncommandos. I mean, there was a demand for trained people. That still goes on in a\nway, because when I gave a book talk in Florida, a young man came in with a\nRottweiler on a leach \u2014 leash and I \u2014 I-I was amazed they let him into the\nbookstore, and he said, can \u2014 do you live in this area? And I said no, I\u2019m just here\nfor a few days. And he said, that\u2019s too bad, and I said why? And he said, I belong to\na group that is very interested in commando training. So you see, there are jobs\neverywhere.",
        "Q: Did you ever consider the possibility of \u2014 of going to Palestine?",
        "A: I first heard about it when I was maybe eight or nine years old, or maybe a little\nyounger. We had a game where you had to pick a nation, you represented that\nnation. And then when that nation was called you had to pick up the ball and hit\nsomebody with it. You know, throw at them. And there was one boy who always\nAugust 7, 1998\nsaid, Palestinian. It was Jewish boy. And I \u2014 I must have asked him, why do you\nwant to be a Palestinian? And he said, that\u2019s the country of our future. Obviously a\n\u2014 from a Zionist family. And I said why? And he said \u2014 he explained it to me as best\nas a young child could. And I was extremely puzzled, because we were so\nintegrated into Viennese middle class society, that the reaction would have \u2014 was\nwhy would we go and sit in the desert and become a part of some agrarian society\nwhen we are in an intellectual society here and part of [indecipherable]. And so it\ntook quite awhile to understand what this was all about. And of course, a lot \u2014 a lot\nof the most material contribution ca-came from Hitler, where people suddenly\nrealized that however integrated the \u2014 and accepted or honored they thought they\nwere, that didn't count any more. So, the notion of living there didn\u2019t really occur\nuntil relatively recently when it\u2019s part of a very broad overall attitude of mind that I\nhave felt that I could live anywhere and \u2014 and relish living anywhere and become\npart of living anywhere. And I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve only been to Israel once, and it was\nabsolutely wonderful, and if I haven\u2019t recently gone back, it\u2019s largely because I\nhave ma \u2014 we have discovered some distant relatives who want to take over if we\ngo there, and we are a little afraid of that because we\u2019d rather be our own \u2014\ndetermine on our own where we want to go, what we want to do. And that may be\ndifficult. But we'll \u2014 we\u2019ll go again. And we have many friends and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nAugust 7, 1998\nsome family. So I\u2014T\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m not an\u2014I\u2014I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m pro-Zionist, but not an \u2014 an\nactive person likely to make aliyah next week.",
        "Q: I'd like to ti \u2014 try and get a time frame. When did you leave the continent and go\nback to England for cadet school?",
        "A: And go where?",
        "Q: To cadet school.",
        "A: We had just crossed the line, which I believe was in middle or late March, I have\nthe date, of course, in my book, in \u201945. And I \u2014 I was then sent to cadet school and\nthat would ch \u2014 check out with V-E day in May, it\u2019s a three months course, all\nright? So you have 45 \u2014 spring of \u201945 cadet school graduating perhaps in early June.",
        "Q: And when were you in Africa? When did you get there and how long did you\nstay?",
        "A: Six months. And shortly after that \u2014 I mean, I went first to Colchester in Essex.\nI-I had hoped by the choice of my regiment and because I graduated high, you get\nyour first choice to get to Oxford, because I chose to be commissioned 1n the\nOxfordshire and Buckinghamshire light infantry. And I made mistake. They\ndidn't send me to Cowley Barracks in Oxford, they sent me to Colchester\n[indecipherable] city, but brimful of soldiers. I was in para \u2014 in a barracks where\nthere were three light infantry regiments. Each one had a different drill, totally\ndifferent drill. So that if you were orderly officer, which you were often, as a junior\nAugust 7, 1998\nofficer, you had to get the orderly sergeant, who was usually an old hand, and put\ncoins on the table. This half crown is me, this florin is you, this sixpence is the\nbugler, these are the ranks. And now, there were no words of command, it was all\ndone silently and precisely and we marched together for 12 paces and halt. We\nabout face, we do this, we do that, we [indecipherable] bugle \u2014 bugles and\n[indecipherable]. And the town would gather around the parade square, they would\nknow it better than I did, certainly. There was, for instance, no ceremonial march\npast for the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. It was a bubble past, being light\ninfantry, so you ran 12 abreast at the bubble, in step, in line and you were the officer\nout in front saluting the pedestal where the commanding officer stands. And if they\ndon\u2019t look lined up properly or in step properly, it\u2019s your fault, although you\nhaven\u2019t the slightest influence what\u2019s happening behind you. I also discovered that\n\u2014 so I had to learn three different drills. I also discovered that the \u2014 one of the\nreasons I had chosen the \u2014 the Ox and Bucks 1s because their airborne battalion had\ntaken the bridges on D-Day and we linked up with them, and they had done a\nbeautiful job taking these bridge intact. And they were delighted to see us, and we\nthem. It turned out they were persona non grata in their own regiment, because the\nregulars at the base considered them irregular forces, air landing people\n[indecipherable] pilots, parachutists, what have you, as I was, you see? So the ones\nwith the maroon beret of the airborne were looked at askance, and me with a green\nAugust 7, 1998\nberet is even worse. And I \u2014 I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of there, which I managed\nfirst of all to be sent to the school of infantry, and that was a course, company\ncommanders course. And that\u2019s when the major there said didn\u2019t I want to stay as\nan instructor, because we hit it off perfectly. It was the same principal as the cadet\nschool, I was telling them how it was and they agreed, because they were veterans\nfrom this campaign or that. And I turned it down for the illusion of freedom that I\ndescribed to you. Well, after that, West Africa and happy to get out of this place\nwhere the people seemed to have the attitude that these irregular force pe \u2014\nmembers were coming to take their jobs away [indecipherable] headquarters and\nGod, I would have paid not to take it away, you know? I \u2014 I \u2014 I wa \u2014 I wanted out,\nout. It\u2019s terrible. And \u2014 and I\u2019m delighted that my last six months were this extra\nboon of \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of Africa and the preceding course. All were lovely compared to\nbeing at the base.",
        "Q: What marketable skills did you have at the end of your military service?",
        "A: Ha, what marketable skills. I had strong cartoons in the army, and I had an older\nmentor who was a stage designer. And he advised me what to do with my cartoons,\nwhich he liked very much. And I had an interview with \u201cPunch.\u201d He said, you start\nat the top. I said, you mean at the bottom? He said no, at the top. If you can\u2019t hack\nit, you go down one rung. Wisdom. Well, they bought two ideas for cartoons and I\nwas so rich that I couldn\u2019t believe it. But this is before the commandos and the\nAugust 7, 1998\nPioneer corps. I-I got paid like for several months salary for two ideas. And I\nthought this is a lovely way of making a living. These were not political cartoons,\nthey were like \u201cNew Yorker\u201d type cartoons. And I drew another batch and I said I\nwould throw a party for the whole platoon, and the \u2014 nothing seemed to happen and\nthen a terrible thing. Well, I went to the local pub where I was well known and I\nsaid, I-I must give this party. I have a whole batch of cartoons out there and when\nthey come in I\u2019Il have plenty of money and right now I don\u2019t. And they gave me\ncredit and I threw a party, all the beer you can drink for the whole platoon. And the\ncheck hadn\u2019t come yet, th-the second installment, but after the party, I think one or\ntwo days later, it came saying the editor regrets at this time we are not buying any\nof the cartoons. And now I had absolutely six months to pay it off, you see. And I\ndidn\u2019t draw a cartoon for a year and a half, in utter depression. Now, I still thought\nthat in that direction was my \u2014 my \u2014 my future profession. I came out of the army\nand I made one brief attempt. I talked to a friend of my family\u2019s who was a\u2014as \u2014\njournalist. And she wrote things about resorts who then gave her a limousine, and\nyou know the bit. One of my daughters says it\u2019s half a step from prostitution, not\njournalism, but that\u2019s a matter of t \u2014 personal taste. Anyhow, I asked her, do you\nthink there would be some opening as an apprentice journalist somewhere? And she\nsaid no, completely hopeless. You might sell one story about your war experience,\nmaybe, but doesn\u2019t amount to much, everybody has stories. And I gave up. She\u2019s\nAugust 7, 1998\nstill writing a \u2014 a Austrian cooking column for a Jewish magazine in London, very\npopular. Written several books, still going to all the best resorts. Well, I thought \u2014 I\n\u2014I-\u2014I wrote her a note when my \u2014 when my book came out, and the movie rights\nwere bought. I haven\u2019t heard from her since. Anyhow, I gave up and I decided\nreluctantly I would have to go to school. So, my mentor, who had sent me with the\ncartoons, you know, to \u201cPunch,\u201d he said, I have a young woman friend who has\njust graduated from art school, and she said she would be willing to come and meet\nwith you and advise you which school to go to and so on. So we met in his studio\nand she [indecipherable] sort of snippety, brisk young woman, and she said, I went\nto the Central School of Art and Crafts, it\u2019s \u2014 I consider it the best school. It\u2019s very\nhard to get in and you probably won\u2019t. And sh \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014I said, you \u2014 you\u2019ve\ngraduated from there? Yes, she had graduated from there, and she was a German\nrefugee and she had been president of the student union, an elective office. Not bad\nfor a\u2014 for a refugee. Well, I was this commando first lieutenant, you see, and I\ndecided to go to that school and become president of the student union, as a matter\nof \u2014 point of honor, you see? And I did both. I\u2014I daresay my jingling uniform\nhelped a bit to boost my portfolio, but it \u2014 they accepted me and I went to that\nschool and I learned quite a lot. And after three years, my mother drew my attention\nto a middle paragraph in a paper that talked about Fulbright scholarships. And she\nsaid, wouldn\u2019t a graduate year be very beneficial for your career? Well, I had just\nAugust 7, 1998\nbegun to go and look for jobs and I found they paid nothing and wanted me to do\nthings that I was not willing to do. I\u2014 I \u2014I asked one studio where I went for a job,\nwhat would I have to show you that you would hire me? And they produced an\nextremely realistic painting of a plate of bacon and eggs, wi-with fat bubble in the\ncenter, and very real. And that\u2019s an illustrator, you know, I mean, I \u2014 obviously\nwhoever was talking to me didn\u2019t understand where I came from or didn\u2019t care.\nAnyway, I \u2014I said to myself, I shall never be able to do this and what\u2019s more I\ndon\u2019t want to be able to do that. I\u2019m a problem solver, I\u2019m a designer, I \u2014 I\u2019m a\u2014\nand for that they were willing to pay, I think, three pounds a week starting salary,\nand I \u2014 I thought that that was absolutely horrible. And I welcomed the opportunity\nto apply for the scholarship, for the Fulbright. And I did with full support of the\nprincipal of the school, a \u2014 a\u2014a Scottish painter who was not my friends because as\npresident of the student union, you can imagine we had many, many skirmishes. But\nhe said, America is entering what we entered in the first Elizabethan age, culturally,\nand you must go there. And o-off I went and they threw in a summer scholarship at\nYale, six weeks. And money was a problem, because sterling was not converted \u2014\nnot that I had any. But 1-it \u2014 it created a problem, because most art schools are not\nboarding schools. So I had to live somewhere. So I lived at International House in\nNew York, in the cheapest room in the basement, and developed techniques, how to\neat for little or nothing. I was also helped by the fact that my mother had a couple of\nAugust 7, 1998\ncousins where I was invited to dinner once a week and they\u2019d give me sandwiches\nfor the next couple of days. And then I\u2019d buy a box of cereal and I\u2019d buy a loaf of\nbread. And I couldn\u2019t afford the school cafeteria, but I could buy 20 cents worth of\nbologna or cheese, and that would stretch for a couple of meals with my loaf of\nbread. And as to \u2014 and \u2014 and a carton of milk, which I put on the windowsill to \u2014 to\nkeep cool. A-And \u2014 and I discovered the American luxury, there\u2019s free sugar in the\ncafeteria, where you can help yourself, put a couple of packages in your \u2014 in your\npocket and with my box of cereal I had breakfast every morning, and my carton of\nmilk, you know. And it \u2014 it worked. And I started to freelance. There was a woman\nwho did [indecipherable] greeting cards, and I did the finished drawings. Making\nthe bells on the wedding cards nice and oval, the polka dots round. And listening to\nthese \u2014 the radio programs of the day, like the trace of lost persons, the FBI and\npeace and war. I got a whole education. And I worked there some nights a week.\nAnd then the father of a schoolmate of mine from Vienna had a business of\nembroidering blouses, women\u2019s blouses. And he \u2014 he paid for these designs, lots of\nmoney. And he didn\u2019t want them finished, he wanted them on tracing paper so he\ncould trace them onto the blouses. Now I employed my best friend to help me, we\nhad so many to do. Unfortunately we discovered it late in the year, but we could\nactually afford to go to the movies, which we hadn\u2019t been able to do before. Was a\nsensational year at International House. We put on shows. And if I give you the\nAugust 7, 1998\ncast, let me say that one of our fellow students was Leontyne Price. So we had the\nbest show in town, and a bunch of Hawaiian friends which [indecipherable]\nsometimes still in touch, who were musicians. Was lovely.",
        "Q: When did you come to the United States? What year was that?",
        "A: \u201949, I believe, if I\u2019m not mistaken. I can verify that, but I think that\u2019s right. For a\nyear. And \u2014 and \u2014 and there is the story I \u2014 I once mentioned to you, which I think is\nvery wor \u2014 well worth saying. My ow \u2014 my own attitude was I could not live in this\ncountry, because I\u2019d just been through six years of war against discrimination and I\nwas seeing the newspapers and what have you that din \u2014 din \u2014 discrimination in this\ncountry was rampant. I \u2014 I\u2014 I read the \u2014 the anti-Semitic diatribes of \u2014 of \u2014 on the\nhill, of [indecipherable] and \u2014 and Father Coughlin(ph) all this was not unfamiliar\nto me, but then the discrimination against black people seemed totally intolerable.\nAnd a couple of things happened. I arrived on the Queen Mary on my Fulbright,\nand there was a green uniformed customs official who looked at my papers and \u2014\nand looked at my \u2014 my suitcase, my shipping trunk, whatever I had brought, and he\nsaid, how long do you propose to stay here? And I said, oh I don\u2019t know, I have a \u2014\na year\u2019s \u2014 I mean, a school year\u2019s scholarship, preceded by six weeks in Yale. And I\nmight hitchhike around a bit to see some of the country. So, it\u2019ll be a year, or \u2014 or\nmaybe 18 months at the most. And he said no. And I said, I \u2014 I beg your pardon?\nAnd this great big, red-haired Irishman, you see \u2014 I said, you mean I can\u2019t do that?\nAugust 7, 1998\nAnd to my utter amazement he put his arm around my shoulder and he said, young\nman, this is the country to live. And we \u2014 we need young people to come here, and\nyou don\u2019t want to go back after 18 months. And I was completely floored by this,\nbecause I had seen customs officials in \u2014 in Austria, in Germany, in France, in\nBritain, and never had anyone said a fre \u2014 a \u2014 a friendly word. It wasn\u2019t fashionable\nuntil that time. Now they say welcome to the country or something, but this 1s all\nthe last few years, you know. To me, this was absolutely stunning. I\u2019ve never\nforgotten it.\n[break]",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Peter Masters. This is tape number two, side A,\nand you were telling me about coming to this country on what you thought was\ngoing to be a temporary excursion and your \u2014 your encounter with a customs\nofficer.",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 the s \u2014 the next thing that made a tremendous impression was 1n this\nsix week course a-a-at Yale, which was for students 20-odd students from different\ncountries all over the world who were coming to \u2014 to study for year, and this was\nsort of a conditioning, American studies, you know, so they would not get too much\nof a culture shock because university here was different from university in their\nown countries. And there were courses in \u2014 in politics and in English and in\nAugust 7, 1998\nliterature and so forth. And one of them was in sociology. The professor was a\nprofessor by the name of Serge(ph) Yamaki(ph), a Finnish American, young man\nwho was wonderful. I had never had a professor like that. He told it how it is, talked\nstraight. He talked about religion in this country. He said there are statistics about\nhow many people go to church. I assure you a percentage, or a large percentage of\nthe \u2014 the majority of people going to church \u2014 to various churches, doesn\u2019t matter\nwhich, are going to show their Sunday clothes, or their automobiles, or whatever. It\nbecomes a social thing. It has very little to do with religion. We had a course \u2014 oh,\noh and he talked about discrimination and about what must have been the first\nseedlings of the Civil Rights movement. And he said, this is an uphill struggle, it\u2019ll\ntake a while, but it\u2019s moving along. We are correcting. There are \u2014 there are serious\nattempts to correct the wrongs of the past. And he went into detail saying what\npeople were doing and what was going on and so on. And you had not heard about\nthat in Europe, you only heard about the negative stories. So I became aware that\nsomebody was trying to do something. And that was \u2014 that \u2014 I\u2019d perhaps been hasty\nwhen I said I could never live in a country where these things exist, as long as there\nwere forces at work that were trying to counteract the \u2014 the \u2014 the bad things I had\nheard. Well then circumstances overtook me. I \u2014 I met my wife again, after we had\nknown each other in London, in fact we had been double dating, but not a-as each\nother\u2019s partner. And she went to America when the Czech government in exile\nAugust 7, 1998\ncollapsed because of the Czech coup in Prague, the communist coup, and she was\nnot going to go back to Prague under the communists. So, she had helped out the\nsecond world meeting of the International Monetary Fund which was in London,\nand sh-sh-she was o-on loan to them from the Czech government be \u2014 just before\nthe coup. And they offered her a job in America and she said, I am very happy\nhere, and when the Czech government collapsed, somebody remembered the \u2014 her\njob offer and he \u2014 he \u2014 he restated it and she accepted. So she came what she\nthought was for a year to work for the Monetary Fund in Washington, and she\nworked there for 36 years. And I came and \u2014 to the United States and one day \u2014\nthere was a Greek student in International House who said, I\u2019m hitchhiking to\nWashington, anybody want to come? I said, I know somebody in Washington, let\nme try and get to a telephone. Well, I tried and \u2014 and they told me that the United\nNations were in Flushing Meadows, New York, and I said yes, but a branch, and I\ngot a Russian operator and forget it, I could not convince her that there was any\nUnited Nations here, which of course there was, the World Bank and Monetary\nFund, and a couple of other one. I gave up. So did the Greek chap, by the way. Said,\nah, I\u2019m not going. So that was \u2014 I \u2014I\u2019d looked for telephone listings under her\nname, there was none. Anyway, I \u2014 I just gave up. I\u2014 a short while later she went\non home leave, which was London, although she is from Slovakia. Ka \u2014 children\u2019s\ntransport survivor. And my \u2014 our mutual friends gave her a book that had just come\nAugust 7, 1998\nout, \u201cThe Green Beret\u201d by Hilary Saint George Saunders. It was the first book\nabout the commandos by a historian. And they said, bring that to Peter. And she\nsaid, where? He\u2019s in New York. Really? I\u2019m going through New York, I'll bring it\nto him. She did and I said I tried to come and see you in Washington, told her the\nstory. She said, you \u2014 you must come and see Washington. So I hitchhiked to\nWashington, which if you had a straight ride took seven and a half hours, before\neverything. Before \u2014 before the bridge, before the parkway, before the tunnel in\nBaltimore. And I then developed the habit of hitchhiking after school on Friday to\nWashington and we got engaged and in the spring of 1950 we were married. And I\ncould now stay under \u2014 as the family member of a U.N. employee, and work. And I\ngot job in Washington and I\u2019ve been here ever since.",
        "Q: In what ways was it significant to you that your wife was also a survivor?",
        "A: It was like a homecoming. I had been engaged to a \u2014 a \u2014 an Irish Protestant girl\nwho was as liberal as the day is long and as bright as can be, and that, however, did\nnot include her family. Her father was a colonel and he was the \u2014 one of the leading\nheart specialists in \u2014 in Ireland. And he wer \u2014 had been a colonel at\n[indecipherable] the African \u2014 north African campaign. He was actually in on the\nconcentration camp reparations in Europe. And you would have thought that that\nmight impact him in some way, and it di \u2014 it certainly impacted him, but the \u2014 the\nnotion of his daughter marrying a foreigner, a Jew, an artist, all bad. You see, so the\nAugust 7, 1998\n\u2014 the mother was also a doctor, a research. The young woman herself, her father\nwas a professor at Queens in Belfast. She went to Trinity in Dublin, which is, of\ncourse, Catholic. And so, we did a lot of commuting between Dublin and Belfast\nand I got s \u2014 deeply into the Irish problem, so similar to the Israeli problem, so\nsimilar to so many of the other discriminatory problems. And found th \u2014\nintellectuals or not, there was no reasoning with the people. They believed every\natrocity story. They told me the same atrocity stories north and south, with a change\nof characters. And \u2014 and the young people were generally against that. But they had\na tremendous uphill struggle. Anyway, the mother, the researcher doctor said do not\ntell Dad that you are getting engaged, because it will kill him. In defense of this\nabsurd attitude, let me tell you that my own family was not lagging far behind. And\nmy mother\u2019s eagerness to get me on that graduate year to America was without a\ndoubt largely motivated by \u2014 she was even willing to not be near me 1-1n order to\nsave me from a fate worse than death 1n \u2014 in her \u2014 in her view. And \u2014 and so \u2014 so\nwhat \u2014 what can I say to you? It is a\u2014 an amazing thing. I have never found out\nwhat happened to this young woman, who was certainly completely innocent of \u2014 of\nanything that took place. And for awhile I was in \u2014 in agony to make a decision\nwhat I would do with my life before I decided to marry my wife, whom I admire\ntremendously as the child survivor of her entire family. The three children were the\nonly survivors, everybody else was murdered. And so you do what you feel you\nAugust 7, 1998\nmust do. And I as \u2014 must say I \u2014 we\u2019ve had an absolutely marvelous marriage. With\nthe millennium it'll be our golden wedding anniversary. And ma \u2014 the secret recipe\nis respect and admiration.",
        "Q: I would like to ask you more about England after the war, and then we\u2019ll go\nback to the United States in a moment. Did you experience any other anti-Semitism\nin England after the war?",
        "A: Not really, not really. I would say we had a mixed bag of friends, some refugees,\nGermany and Austria and Hungary and so on. And quite a few British people.\nYou see, I\u2019ve been several people in my life. I\u2019ve been a student, so I had art\nstudent friends. I had \u2014 some of whom became very famous artists. I had been a\u2014a\n\u2014a soldier, not only with other foreigners, but with British colleagues. When I was\nin London just now, one of my friends from cadet school, who was a fellow\ncommander with whom I'd actually done a night patrol in Normandy, without us\nrealizing it until we told each other the stories, that we obviously were both on the\nsame thing, in cadet school we were very close friends, and he is as English as they\nmake them, and he came to see me up from Essex, where he now lives. And we said\nwe\u2019ll have lunch in a pub, and a drink. And he told me that it was his 75\" birthday.\nAnd I said how c \u2014 how could you leave your family on your 75\" birthday? And he\nsaid, I told Peggy I\u2014 I w \u2014I wanted to do this. And he said, you don\u2019t realize it, but\non my 50\" birthday I happened to be visiting you in Washington. And on my 21\u00b0\nAugust 7, 1998\nbirthday we were both in Normandy. So I thought it appropriate. He also brought\nme a thing he had written about his D-Day experience. It is extremely moving. It\nwas his father\u2019s birthday, D-Day. And when it was over, D-Day night, he said, I felt\n\u2014 I suddenly reflected that I was very grateful not to have spoiled my father\u2019s\nbirthday by becoming a casualty. So, I\u2014 I \u2014I think his D-Day account is brilliant.\nHe writes as I wish I could, and he in turn, has read \u2014 read my book and he said to\nme \u2014 he wrote me a letter and he said, I\u2019ve read your book, and you\u2019re not supposed\nto enjoy a book about such grim times and experiences. But you and I know that in\nbetween the grim times and experiences, we had some wonderful times. So forget\nwhat I said about \u2014 I really enjoyed your book, because it\u2019s like you were there, I\nmean, when you read it. And so is his. And he says, you know, D-Day wasn\u2019t so\nbad for us compared to what we experienced in the next few days afterwards, and\nthat\u2019s true. But in describing his D-Day, he tells me where \u2014 you see, he was \u2014 he\nhad a disadvantage over me. He was surrounded by all the people with whom he\nhad trained. I was one of me attached to people I barely knew. A training mistake,\nthey should have put me with them earlier. But, when they were killed, I didn\u2019t\nknow them. When his buddies were killed, and one was like shot in half crossing a\nroad in front of him, these were his friends. So it was much more personal for him,\na-and I respect that, I mean I \u2014 I never saw one of my immediate friends killed or\nwounded. I saw a lot of people killed or wounded, but not my immediate friends.\nAugust 7, 1998\nThey were attached to the unit next door, as \u2014 a specialist as I was, to this. So it \u2014 it\nmade a-an emotional difference that was to my advantage. I mean, I was shocked\nenough when I heard that two chaps down the road whom I knew very well had \u2014\nhad just been killed, you know, and so on. I don\u2019t see them. And I was Tommy gun\nguard for a burial party that buried, I don\u2019t know, 40 people. I didn\u2019t know any of\nthem. So it \u2014 it \u2014 you know, these are all factors in this thing, it\u2019s a very, very\npersonal the experiences.",
        "Q: You were in England during the Nuremberg trials and during the U.N. vote on\nthe partition of Palestine, and I would like you to talk about both of those events,\nstarting first please with the \u2014",
        "A: Both of which? The Nuremberg trials \u2014",
        "Q: Nuremberg trials and then also the U.N. vote on the partition of Palestine.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: First, if you would, please tell me about Nuremberg, and did you ever think\nabout possibly going over and working as a translator or an interpreter?",
        "A: No, no, I never had the opportunity, nobody asked me. It didn\u2019t happen. I\nfollowed it closely and \u2014 and relished the just punishments of some of the\nparticipants. I also was aware that many people were given immunity for \u2014 for\nreasons of practicality of \u2014 of [indecipherable] scientists who were needed and\ngoodness knows what else. It did not involve me personally. I now welcome the\nAugust 7, 1998\nnotion that \u2014 that Palestine \u2014 that \u2014 that Israel came into existence, and I have\nmentioned to you before my Scottish principal with whom I used to skirmish in art\nschool, and I remember that I was in his office when the assassination of Count\nBernadotte came th-through \u2014 the news came through. And I said, I\u2019m shocked\nabout that, one should not kill United Nations officials. I-I think that\u2019s beyond the\npale. And he said, to my utter amazement, these are the birth pains of a new nation,\nand you have to accept it, that this is the sort of thing, we don\u2019t know the details.\nAnd later of course, I heard that Bernadotte was targeted because he was assuming\na stance of a very unfavorable [indecipherable] and so on and so on. But I was\namazed that this Scotsman had the vision to s \u2014 way beyond mine, that this was a\nthing you had to take into your stride. Anti-Semitism, which is coming back to early\nChristian, didn\u2019t affect, but you have to bear in mind that all our chaps had cover\nstories and many of them found the [indecipherable] of that cover story was\ncomfortable, and so they didn't say who they were. Many of them didn\u2019t practice\nany religion particularly, and when it came to intermarriage, all of us were\nindependent enough to say if I want marry an Eskimo, I will. Metaphorically\nspeaking, quite a few married Eskimos, which some of them came to regret. But\nthat doesn\u2019t alter the fact that on principle, you felt, I\u2019m my own person, I can do\nwhat I like. Now comes the question which is probably down your list somewhere,\nof \u2014 of h-how much did Judaism mean? It\u2019s very difficult. On the one hand, some of\nAugust 7, 1998\nus had a reaction, saying I don\u2019t want to belong to anything that excludes\nsomebody. That\u2019s a very broad statement, but \u2014 but 1-it\u2019s meant to be. I don\u2019t want\nto belong to a Jewish club. That means only Jews can join, because that is the\nexclusion of somebody and that\u2019s what we were just fighting against. I don\u2019t want\nto belong to another club either, that include \u2014 excludes people. In fact, I don\u2019t want\n[indecipherable]. But it goes beyond that, because you say, if I send my children to\nSunday school, or they belong to a club, I don\u2019t want to join any clubs. Clubs\nsegregate. That\u2019s not always reasonable, but that\u2019s an emotional reaction to some of\nthe things that have happened before. So you see, we did not send in our children to\n\u2014 to Sunday school. I had two daughters and a son. We had the son, the son was\nBar Mitzvahed. The girls were not Bat Mitzvahed because we hadn\u2019t even heard\nof that in Europe. The son was Bar Mitzvahed. When he was born he did not have\na bris, he was circumcised in the hospital. It\u2019s again the emotional reaction against\nbelonging to something that excludes other people. It\u2019s quite absurd if you reflect\nupon it, and it\u2019s taken me years to \u2014 to \u2014 to overcome it. But \u2014 but it was a very real\nfactor, possibly an error, socially, possibly an error religiously, because parallel to\nthat are the war memories of going to shul with my grandfather, who was very, very\nserious about it, as my parents were not. And the tug of war between the sentiment\nan \u2014 of emotional tradition on the one hand, and the not wanting to belong to\nanything that excludes anybody else is an ongoing thing. Right now I\u2019m deeply\nAugust 7, 1998\nembroiled in a fight that I find myself in, rather surprisingly. It is that the members\nof my troop of \u2014 of foreign refugees, want to put up a memorial to the troop and the\n20 who were killed in north Wales where we were trained. This 1s all initiated by\nmy book, where it suddenly has sort of come to \u2014 come alive, and a retired judge\nwho was one of us, refugee from Germany, has taken the ball and is running with it\nlike crazy, and the people in north Wales think that the movie will be made in \u2014 in\nnorth Wales, which of course doesn\u2019t follow. But \u2014 so the local council and the\ncouncil of Wales is all in favor and has given us a lovely little green plot\noverlooking the ocean in this resort town, where they are going to put up a\nmemorial. And when they drafted the words, it said, refugees from Nazi oppression.\nIt did not use the word Jewish. And I\u2019m up in arms, and I say it has to include the\nword at least mostly Jewish. And in order to bring this about, I am fighting tooth\nand nail, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m enlisting the support of my surviving colleagues or their\nwidows. I sought an interview with the Honorable Miriam Rothschild, who was\nmarried to one of our chaps and is a wealthy ma \u2014 scientist in her 90\u2019s. And she\nsaid, you must come down and talk about it, and I just now I went to the Rothschild\nestate and we spent all day talking and she is solidly on my side. And the \u2014 the thing\nthat\u2019s happening is that some of the chaps who have embraced their cover story,\ndon\u2019t want to break that cover story. It is as if they thought that the York massacre,\nof which they have never heard, happened last year rather than hundreds of years\nAugust 7, 1998\nago, and that by assuming the \u2014 their identities as British citizens church of\nEngland, which is what our dog tags said, they are escaping any danger of anti-\nSemitism and they have forgotten who they really are. Or rather, they would like to\nforget. Not all of them. Some of the non-Jewish members of the troop, there is a \u2014a\n\u2014a fellow, he is now in his 80s, friend of mine, who \u2014 whose name is Gizer(ph), he\nserved under the name of Gordon. He is a grandson of Walter Liebknecht(ph).\nWalter Liebknecht(ph) was the buddy and companion of Rosa Luxemburg, if that\nmeans anything to you, early German communism. His father, the son of Walter\nLiebknecht(ph) \u2014 Walter Liebknecht(ph) was assassinated by forerunners of the\nNazis in the 20s. There is a Kathe Kollwitz woodcut, a gorgeous woodcut of the \u2014\nthe body of Walter Liebknecht(ph) and mourners. She was very much involved in\nthat, Kathe Kollwitz. Well, the grandson of Walter Liebknecht(ph), not Jewish,\nsaid there is not a drop of Jewish club in \u2014 blood in me, but I respect, applaud and\nsalute my Jewish comrades and their bravery and I am on your side that it should\nsay mostly Jewish on the monument. Another one, Ron Gilbert Goodman, he\nserved in undercover intelligence in Germany after his command of duty. He got\nan MBE, Member of the British Empire in \u2014 from \u2014 from the queen, and he said \u2014\nhe maintained his cover longer than anybody, because he had to. He was \u2014 he was\ncatching Nazis, you see. Post-war Nazis. And he said \u2014 it was a bit embarrassing\nbecause he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s widowed, his girlfriend wanted to read the book and he thought\nAugust 7, 1998\nwell, that will break my cover as far as she\u2019s concerned. But while he \u2014 they were\ndiscussing it, she got it from Amazon dot com and read it and \u2014 and he said, the hell\nwith the cover, I\u2019m on your side. He remembers that he was forced to destroy his\nshul, by the Nazis. So you see, for the judge, it\u2019s probably very difficult to go to the\nWelsh council and say, on reflection, it ought to say mostly Jewish. And I don\u2019t\nknow whether he\u2019s man enough to do it. But if he isn\u2019t, Pll withdraw my support.\nThat\u2019s how that one 1s.",
        "Q: I wanted to get clarification on your cover story and something that you told me\nin the course of the interview so far. When you were offered the possible job as a\npoliceman in Palestine \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 did the man who offered you that job know the truth, that your \u2014 your real\nidentity?",
        "A: I doubt it. I\u2014 I think \u2014 I mean, as a colonel, somebody might have said these\npeculiar chaps we are giving you here are German speakers. But I mean, the\nbrigadier, Lord Lovett(ph) until he was wounded, had some very early members of\nthe forerunner of the two who I think were Sudeten Germans. Now, well a\u2014 we\ndidn\u2019t know them, they were killed at Dieppe on \u2014 in the raid. They might have\nbeen Sudeten German Jews. No idea. Didn\u2019t know them, I don\u2019t know their real\nnames. But he was very fond of referring to all of us as good Germans, you see?\nAugust 7, 1998\nSudeten Germans. He didn\u2019t understand what that meant, really. Scottish highland\nchief, you know, head of the [indecipherable], the 17\" Lord Lovett(ph). He \u2014 he\ndoesn\u2019t understand what \u2014 who \u2014 who \u2014 who we are, although he subsequently\napparently did. I ust \u2014 in Scotland I talked to the widow of the brigade major, Lady\nHopagow(ph) and she was full of \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 brimful of Holocaust stories and \u2014 and\n\u2014 and saying how \u2014 how supportive she was and so on. But, the Honorable Miriam\nRothschild tells me that when she was in north Wales, first as the fianc\u00e9e of one of\nour people, the landlady said she did not wish her to come again, because she didn\u2019t\nwant a Jewish person in her house. And then she said two other things happened.\nOne was that Lord Rothschild was in MI-5 in British Intelligence, counter-\nIntelligence, and he told her that somebody had accused her in Wales to be\nprobably a spy, and that they had actually searched her belongings. And she said,\nhow could they? And sh \u2014 he \u2014 he actually cited examples of a crossword puzzle\nshe had been working on, that MI-5 knew had \u2014 had been extracted from her room.\nAnd when she \u2014 ou-our man, of course, was under his cover story, the one who was\nengaged to her, so he couldn\u2019t say anything in particular. And when they were\nmarried, they kicked him out too. So, for that reason she was against that memorial\nand I said to her, I\u2019m much more confrontational than you are. If there was a\nmanifestation as you describe, of anti-Semitism, the more reason to have a\nAugust 7, 1998\nmemorial there saying mostly Jewish, so that, you know, what\u2019s wrong with that?\nAnd she agreed with me.",
        "Q: And the gentleman who told you about the birth pains of a new nation, did he\nalso know your true background?",
        "A: The answer 1s, I don\u2019t know. I simply don\u2019t know. He was an autocrat and we \u2014\nwe \u2014 we fought quite a bit because of various school matters. And \u2014 but he\nrespected me and I respected him in \u2014 1n-in \u2014 in our stubbornness. And what he\nknew, I really don\u2019t know. I told you some of my fellow students became very\nfamous. I tried to talk one of them out of his career because he wanted to be a\nscenic designer and I said, there\u2019s no future in that field. And he almost changed his\nmajor, but then he stayed a scenic designer. He 1s now one of the most famous ones\nin the world. He has, I think, a CBE from the queen and he is working. We couldn\u2019t\nmeet because he was doing an amphitheater in the south of France. And he called\nme and we had a long chat. And then he is going to ho \u2014 Peking, and then he is\ngoing to Hong Kong and then he is going to Kuala Lumpur and in between he is\ndoing \u201cMidsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d in Copenhagen. In \u2014 he was doing\n\u201cNabucco,\u201d which is a Jewish Verdi opera, I mean, Jewish subject about\nNebuchadnezzar and what have you, and the Jews in the south of France, in the\nhotbed of French neo-Nazism. And so he had, in an amphitheater, which makes it\nmore difficult, he projected a Star of David over the amphitheater. And at first it\nAugust 7, 1998\nwas going to be during the famous Nabucco chorus of the \u2014 of the Jews. And then\nhe said, in reflection, after reflection, I\u2019d like to make a political statement. So I\nwant it from the beginning of the overture, through the first act, the Star of David\nprojected onto the entire amphitheater.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry to interrupt you, but I have to change the tape. One moment. [break]\nThis is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Peter Masters. This is tape number two, side B, and you\nwere telling me about the scenic designer, but you have not mentioned his name.",
        "A: His name is Ralph Koltai. He \u2014 he was material in the Sydney Opera House\ndesign, etcetera, etcetera. And he is \u2014 when \u2014 when I \u2014 when I relinquished my year\nas president of the student union, he was my vice president and followed me as\npresident of the student union. He is from Berlin, Hungarian Jewish family. And I-I\nfirst noticed how famous he was when I saw a play in Washington where the\nprogram notes said that the scenic designer was a student of Ralph Koltai\u2019s. So\nthat, I suppose means you have arrived. He is sending me a book, he had a big\nretrospective recently, and I am sending him my book, so we are exchanging \u2014\nexchanging books. I\u2019m very thrilled and he is very, very enthused about the fact that\nI wrote my book.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you to reflect upon what was going on in your head and what\nwas going on around you during the conflict over the partition of Palestine and then\nAugust 7, 1998\nultimately the declaration of independence and statehood. For you, as a Jewish\nrefugee, what was going on in your mind in England in those days?",
        "A: Well, as I have really explained when I talked to you about my conversations\nwith Mr. Johnson \u2014 I didn\u2019t mention his name either, William Johnson was the\nScottish painter who was the principal of my school. He must be long dead. I \u2014 a-at\nfirst abhorred the violence, and it took me awhile to \u2014 to settle into the\nunderstanding that he had ahead of me. I \u2014 I could not at first fathom that oh,\nblowing up the King David hotel was a good thing to do, you see. Difficult. I \u2014 I-I\nrespect his explanation that he gave, saying the birth pangs of a nation, you see.\nBut, at first it was very difficult to grasp that the average \u2014 I mean, you have to bear\nin mind, you\u2019re a British soldier and you are assigned to this. Now, I have a friend\nwho was in the Pioneer corps with me, his name is Peter Bloch(ph). He is from\nGermany, a refugee, Jewish refugee. He volunteered and he got into the 21\"\nindependent parachute company, which was \u2014 had some foreigners in it, British\nparachute company. He found himself in Greece, fighting civilians, political\ncivilians and he hated it. It \u2014 1t ma \u2014 pushed him wa \u2014 way over left politically and\nthen he was assigned to Palestine with the six \u2014 with the first airborne division.\nAnd he said, I don\u2019t want to go. And they said, well, what do you mean? You are a\nwar hero, you\u2019re \u2014 he said, I\u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 you can call me what you will. I may have\nbeen a war hero in your eyes, but now I\u2019m a conscientious objector. And I think he\nAugust 7, 1998\nmanaged that, conscientious objection not to serve with the first airborne in \u2014\nBritish first airborne in what was Palestine. And surely you can understand it. I\ncan\u2019t understand that it threw him, but I can understand but I don\u2019t agree that it\nmade him go way over to the left when he studied at the [indecipherable] school of\neconomics and we used to have arguments about that. And I think he has settled\ndown more or less as a liberal. But a\u2014 a \u2014 a\u20141n~\u20141n his youth certainly the people\nhe was hanging out with were \u2014 were a mixed bag of people who were reading the\n\u201cDaily Worker\u201d in the London underground demonstratively, and I remember\nhearing them complain saying I wish they\u2019d give us a new one, I\u2019m getting fed up\nholding this paper all the time. But it\u2019s done for demonstrative purposes, you see.\nThe \u2014 well, the whole communism question, of course had s \u2014 got into the act in\nthat when \u2014 when Stalin did some of the things he did, he became unacceptable,\nand the people who had been supportive of \u2014 of \u2014 of communism suddenly found\nthemselves in a rather awkward position, because how do you backtrack when\nyou\u2019ve been such an enthusiast? And suddenly you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re \u2014 the people you\nhave been following are committing atrocities that you cannot \u2014 cannot accept. So, I\n\u2014 I never \u2014 I never got into that communist game as so many young students did. I\nsuppose it was a question of upbringing, because after losing World War I, for\nwhich many Jewish Austrians were great enthusiasts, they \u2014 they suddenly found\nthat war is hell. Meaning the depression following it, meaning defeat, meaning the\nAugust 7, 1998\npeculiar post-war \u2014 post World War I dealings, politically, where Austria was\ncompletely emaciated to a six million country from being a world empire. And\npeculiarly Germany, which was the much younger country, something like 2,000\nyears of Austria compared to 90 years of Germany. Germany was intact and more\npowerful than ever after \u2014 well, not economically, but \u2014 but territorially. So, you\nhear of Germans yearning for a return to power. You ga \u2014 you do \u2014 never hear of\nAustrians yearning for a return to power, because they were made up of so many\nminorities, that wanted to be torn apart. Which you see again in what used to be\nYugoslavia. Every minority wants to be independent, whether they are viable or\nnot. First independence, then maybe we\u2019ll confederate. I'll believe it when I see it.\nTerrible.",
        "Q: Is there anything else that you would like to add about your years in postwar\nEngland?",
        "A: My years in postwar England were primarily as a student. I had a \u2014 a wonderful\ntime. I had \u2014 there was no G.I. bill, but there was a so-called further education and\ntraining grant, which was more modest than the G.I. bill, but it certainly sustained\nme together with my freelance activities. And I had my \u2014 my own apartment in\nsouthwest London, and I traveled mostly by bicycle, and by underground. And I\nhad lots of friends Wartime friends, English friends, English friends from cadet\nschool. I had some with whom I corresponded for years afterwards and the\nAugust 7, 1998\ncorrespondence only ended because they died. I had a brilliant friend who wrote me\nsheafs of letters, all not about news, but about philosophical observations. I have\nkept them all. I \u2014 I find that \u2014 well, the Latin proverb, Ubi bene ibi patria. Where\nI\u2019m well, there is my country, applies to some extent. I could live in England\neasily, but I could live anywhere unless the system of the country were such that I\ncould not stomach it. I have a reluctance to visit countries in my travels where there\nis the juxtaposition of luxurious wealth and abject poverty, which has kept me away\nfrom China, from India and many other countries. I-It is perhaps a \u2014a\u2014a-\u2014an\nostrich policy of simply not wanting to see it, but I find it distressing. I would say it\nincludes Mexico. I\u2019ve been to Mexico once to a Club Med and I don\u2019t think Pll go\nthere again. I-It\u2019s not my thing. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I find that postwar England, I \u2014 I\n\u2014 I never really worked in England, other than on a farm as a boy, which did me a\nlot of good, and briefly on being released from internment \u2014 I did not go from\ninternment into the army, I went from internment to being released, forgotten out\nmomentarily, and then into the army, when I was old enough. I \u2014 I worked for a\nPolish publisher, and I was nothing. I mean, I was a gopher. And I have therefore,\nno work experience in England that could be called a work experience. The \u2014 the\nthing about the bacon and eggs picture turned me off rather solidly. Whether I\nwould have gotten into my profession, I would imagine I would. I don\u2019t know how\nit would have worked. I\u2019m \u2014 I can\u2019t, I really don\u2019t know. In this country there was a\nAugust 7, 1998\ncertain realization, that if you have any talents at all, there is someone somewhere to\nwhom those talents are worth money, and they are willing to pay for it. They might\nbe willing to pay as little as possible, but on the other hand, if you are reasonably\nalert and if you are willing to go where it\u2019s at \u2014 which is something that almost no\nother country seems to have. I mean, I can\u2019t picture people doing what people in\nthis country have been doing for a couple of generations, that is the economic\nsituation in our town is bad, so we put everybody in the car and drive to a state\nwhere I understand you can get a job. People ga \u2014 actually do that. They don\u2019t do it\nelsewhere. And most of all, I realize that in this country, if something bothers you\nand you are willing to spend some time trying to remedy it \u2014 1t needn\u2019t be a very\npolitical thing, it can be the bumps on the street, or \u2014 or the speed limit, or whether\nyour school needs an addition. You don\u2019t have to \u2014 to \u2014 to give up your job to \u2014 to\npursue this. You work on in a little bit and then get together with a few people who\nare like-minded. And in your own lifetime \u2014 even in \u2014 within the next few years,\nsomething actually starts to happen. Sometimes too fast. I come back to the bumps\nwhere they \u2014 they want the bumps in, then now they want the bumps out. And when\nthey\u2019re out they will want them in again. You know, I mean, and \u2014 and \u2014 and that\nactually happens, at great expense and with a big effort. But you try and do that in\nsome other country, and you know what\u2019s gonna happen? Nothing is gonna happen.\nMaybe it\u2019s changing a little, slowly now, and there are things happening here and\nAugust 7, 1998\nthere. But by and large, you run your head up against a wall, and the wall, the base\nof the wall is littered with the bleached bones of people who have tried before you,\nand some of them were good people, but they failed. Well, that\u2019s a big\ndiscouragement to run your head against the wall. I have participated in some of\nthese things in this country. Got an addition built at the elementary school where\nmy children went, which actually came into use while the youngest one was still\nthere. You know, I mean, unheard of in \u2014 in \u2014 1n other countries. Doesn\u2019t \u2014 doesn\u2019t\nhappen, doesn\u2019t happen. So I find it enormously refreshing, and you can take some\nof the other things in your stride a little bit if you know that on the other hand, this\nexists.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to the 1950s and now you are living in the United States. I would\nlike to get a sense of what was happening in your life, now you\u2019re newly married\nand you are now in the Washington, D.C. area. What was happening to you\nprofessionally and personally in the 1950s?",
        "A: I first g \u2014 my \u2014 my wife arranged that I should see a man who was himself a n \u2014\na German refugee, and he re \u2014 had a small public relations agency, that was a new\nprofession. And he would steer me to where I might get a job as a graphic designer.\nWell, I went to see him, and he decided to employ me. In some \u2014 in many respects\nthat was a disaster. It was a very small firm, of more heads than employees. And the\nattitude was rather peculiar. I was now the art director and the art department all in\nAugust 7, 1998\none, and we didn\u2019t have many jobs to do. Through family connections he got an\nassignment where I \u2014 where there were to be free full page, full color ads in\n\u201cHK squire\u201d magazine. I had never done anything like it, and neither had anybody\nelse there. So it was my assignment. I not only designed them, I wrote them, I\nsupervised the photography, I went into unbelievable acrobatics. And they came\nout, for those times, pretty well. One of the partners suggested that I be given a\nbonus, because I think I earned 30 dollars a week. The big boss said, he is an artist\nand he had the fun of doing it, it\u2019s a bad idea to give him a bonus. And they didn\u2019t.\nThis kind of attitude made it a little difficult. I-It was in everything. I mean, if we\ndid get money for this, there\u2019s no doubt we did, he would buy a new oriental rug for\nthe office. And I designed a shiny brass nameplate for downstairs on\n[indecipherable] street where we were \u2014 had a \u2014 had a upstairs office with a three-\ndimensional logo which I had designed in the \u2014 custom made in brass. I mean, we\nwere really going for it, and everybody had their own hand-engraved business card,\nand \u2014 which we really couldn\u2019t afford, you know? And \u2014 and the \u2014 well, we went to\na meeting for \u2014 with \u2014 with some corporate association, and I discovered the thing I\nmentioned elsewhere in \u2014 in other connections, and that is that nobody was saying\nanything, and we were to sell these people on why we wanted to do this. So I spoke\nup and I said, here\u2019s what we need to do. We actually did a brochure for them. That\nwas unprecedented, and \u2014 and 1-1t wouldn\u2019t have happened if I hadn\u2019t sold them on\nAugust 7, 1998\nthe concept, because it was way out modern for them at that time, you know. Well,\nultimately everybody quit, and I was the sole employee. The boss took a job with\nthe government and said, don\u2019t ever call me there unless there\u2019s an utter emergency.\nAnd then he said, I see here an advertisement that the Pentagon is \u2014 wants to retain\nan agent, an advertising agency for the army. So why don\u2019t you go and bid on that.\nMe. And I said, you know, tha-that\u2019s a bit absurd, because they are looking for a big\ncorporation to handle this. Never mind, you do as you\u2019re told. I went to the\nPentagon and to this room full of colonels and what have you and advertising\nagencies from all over the country. And the colonel who made the opening speech\nsaid any firm whose business would be doubled by this account 1s disqualified.\nObviously it didn\u2019t want small time people. I knew my boss so I stayed til the end\nof the talk and I came back and I said, we are disqualified because of this\nstipulation. And he said why? And I said, because if your business is doubled. He\nsaid, well, it would do much more than double our business, so we are all right. And\nhe was absolutely ser-serious, you see. So I\u2014 I \u2014 he filled out the forms, I filled out\nthe forms and he sent them in. I was still the only employee. After awhile there was\n\u2014 the door rang one day \u2014 doorbell rang and it was a team to evaluate our facilities.\nThat was rather difficult for me, but I had been trained to improvise, and I said\nseveral people are on assignment with [indecipherable] and several people are on\nvacation, and right at this moment I am the only person here just for this next hour\nAugust 7, 1998\nor so. Would you rather come back another time, or what? And they said, perhaps\nwe should. And there were lots of empty desks and the place was very elegant, with\nthe oriental rug and all the other stuff. And they left, and I called the boss at work in\ngovernment. I told you never to call me. I said, well, I think this is an emergency.\nThese guys might come back any time, I \u2014 they \u2014 they don\u2019t \u2014 I tried to pin them\ndown, but they said they come for random inspection. And he said, I\u2019m coming\nover. And he came and he said, you know, in \u2014 we \u2014 we have to do something. And\nhe said, I just crossed Lafayette Park. We could take some of the bums from the\nbenches, and some of them are your size and some of them are mine, and could\ndress them up and sh \u2014 have them \u2014 give them a shave and they could be sitting at\nthe desks when these pe \u2014 if \u2014 if only we knew when they are coming again. I \u2014 I\nsaid, you know, I \u2014 I don\u2019t think that that\u2019Il work. He was deadly serious. Well, a\nshort while later, he had the account of an African nation, and who was doing it? I.\nWe had a newsletter. I had absolutely no material for the newsletter, but I went to\nthe ambassador and interviewed him, and I went to look at the postage stamps of the\ncountry, and there \u2014 there were some animals that were indigenous only to that\ncountry, so I went to the zoo and talked to the director about whether he had any of\nthese specimen, and he did, and I had a photographer and I took pictures in the zoo,\nand pictures of the stamps and I got a congratulatory letter from a philatelist at the\nSmithsonian saying I wish more people were doing this. He didn\u2019t know I was\nAugust 7, 1998\ndoing it out of desperation, you see. And then the boss was invited for the\ninauguration of the president in that country, and he went, and was decorated. And I\nsaid, be sure to keep me informed so I can write the newsletter that should get to the\nguests before they go \u2014 all go home. And he said he would, and he sent me nothing.\nAnd I was getting progressively more desperate because I felt duty-bound to do this\nand I called his wife. And I said, is he writing to you? And she said yes. I said, can I\nsee the letters? She said no, they are rather private. I said, cross out the private\nthings and \u2014 and I \u2014I have to have something of what\u2019s going on. Didn't get\nanything. I finally took \u2014 fished out accounts of the first inauguration. This was a\nre-Inauguration of a second term president, and I wrote as if somebody had been\nthere, and if it described the \u2014 the women\u2019s dresses in general terms, I described the\nwomen\u2019s dresses in general terms. And I \u2014 I \u2014 I just winged the whole thing and \u2014\nand showed pictures of the previous inauguration. And I had it all just about done,\nwith each story on one desk and now all I had to do is assemble it, and he came\nback and he said, the place 1s in an awful mess. And I said mess? The mess is each\ndesk, since nobody sits at the desks, it\u2019s one story. It\u2019s perfectly organized, I \u2014 it\u2019s\nthe only way I can get this thing out in time. And he said, first we\u2019re going to get\nthe place shipshape. I said, you touch one of these stories, I\u2014 I\u2019m out of here. He\ntouched the stories, and I quit. And then he wanted to pay me to come back to put\nout the issue, and so I \u2014 but I mean, for the swan song, but I wa \u2014 you know, there\nAugust 7, 1998\nwas simply no way. So I called all the people who had quit before, half a dozen and\none of them was working for channel nine television. And he said, how would you\nlike to be a television art director? I said, well there\u2019s one catch, I know nothing\nabout television. He said, neither does anybody else, it\u2019s new. Why don\u2019t you come\non out, I can\u2019t promise anything, but we\u2019ll see. I went out and I was television art\ndirector, and it was lots of fun. Pioneers, you know. Never before. Live television.\nWe did fantastic things. We had more courage than good sense. We \u2014 we \u2014 we did\nspectacular things, we got \u2014 and being Washington we did network things, and I-I\ndid presidential broadcasts for several presidents, some at the White House, some in\nthe studio. I \u2014 then \u2014 then CBS did a survey and discovered that the country was\nread for country music. I think the survey meant Simon and Garfunkel, but they\ndidn\u2019t understand that, and so we got Jimmy Dean. And we did the Jimmy Dean\nshow, network, and I had a ball. I had a free hand to do what I like. I did a network\nmusical every week. It meant not sleeping for one night, working clean acro \u2014\naround the clock. And for couple of adjacent night, if we got home by two or three\nin the morning, we were doing well. And I decided I had to make a move\nfinancially, so I went to the management, which was as autocratic as they come, and\nI said, you are not charging enough for my services. That was the approach. And\nthey said, how much should we be charging? I said, well first of all, \u2019'd like to have\na percentage, like all the other talent is getting. Oh really, how much do you have in\nAugust 7, 1998\nmind? So I\u2014 my wife and I had a long session over the weekend, because if I said\nthe right amount, they would cut it in half. If I said too much they would laugh and\nfire me. If I said not enough, they would accept it. So I had to say too much, but just\nenough too much that by cutting it back 1t would be reasonable. And that actually\nworked. And it was based on the premise that the role of Washington television\nwould increase. I was much more optimistic than they were, and I was right. The\ntrouble was when I didn\u2019t get any sleep any more, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t have time to\nbill, so that my bills were accumulations of several weeks. And that meant the\ncheck was large, and that meant the person who had to sign the check was signing a\ncheck that was bigger than his. It wasn\u2019t really bigger than his, but it was by the fact\nthat it was several weeks. And that irked them. So after a period of time, they said,\nwe are going to terminate this agreement. And I said, and what? And they said,\nwe ll \u2014 we\u2019ll see that you are all right. Well, seeing that was \u2014 I was all right was a\nludicrous joke compared to what I\u2019d been earning. So I said, I don\u2019t know whether\nthat is acceptable. So they said, do you want to see the president, whom we could\nnever see. I met him in the elevator and usually told him what \u2014 what \u2014 what I \u2014\nwhat I needed and he would support me, because I was an asset. This time they\nwere waiting. You want to see the president? Sure. I walked in and he was \u2014 you\nknow, it was the days of having no desk and a long settee and he was sitting on the\narmrest with his feet up on the settee and said, sit down. I was sitting 12 foot away\nAugust 7, 1998\non the long settee. And he said, can we help you to relocate? And I said, I \u2014 I think\nPll manage. And in the meantime they offered my assistant, who was Afro-\nAmerican, my job at half the salary. And he quit and we formed a partnership, and\nwe freelanced for \u2014 after 10 years, for channel nine, really doing, if I say so myself,\nan excellent bloody job. We were way ahead of people, right to the right and left.\nSome of them even called us and said, you are giving us a hard time, you are doing\nsuch fascinating things that our management is constantly on us. We freelanced for\nanother five years, as you know, a design partnership. Now, we did work for the\nother networks. We did the [indecipherable] orbital launch for ABC, we did the\ninaugural coverage for ABC. We are \u2014 we had been CBS. They had \u2014 they\ndeliberately prevented us from doing freelance for a few years, out of sheer malice.\nUltimately we got into a difficult situation because my partner \u2014 we were doing a \u2014\na fashion show at the Mayflower with Lyndon Johnson\u2019s daughters. And we were\nbuilding a \u2014 a\u2014 a walkway and sets and this was in Herndon, Virginia and I\u2019d\nworked there all day and I was getting very tired, and I said, can you come out and\nfinish up, and he said sure. And as he walked into the shop where we were building\nthings, a guy hit a knot on a four by four [indecipherable] his lathe, and a piece\nflew off like a shell and hit him \u2014 hit my partner over the head and he had a\nfractured skull. And he didn't want to be hospitalized in Virginia in those days. So\nhe got on the phone and arranged for his ambulance and hospitalization in the\nAugust 7, 1998\ndistrict where his sister was a nurse for a neurosurgeon. And he said, I\u2014 I have a\nfractured skull, can you come and get me? It\u2019s near Dulles airport, th-they took an\nhour before he was in that hospital. And they put in a metal plate and \u2014 and I found\nhim a lawyer, and he got enough insurance compensation to buy a couple houses on\nCapitol Hill. And talking about anti-Semitism, or anti-black or anti anything, my\nart director colleagues in Washington would sometimes take me aside and say, we\nrespect what a courageous thing you are doing. And I said, what am I doing? And\nthey said, you have a black partner. And I said, it\u2019s not because I\u2019m courageous, we\nwork well together. And they would say yes, but it can\u2019t be easy. I say, it\u2019s no\nproblem at all, we have \u2014 we have always worked together where we could work on\none piece of rush work where I start on the right and he starts on the left and we\nmeet in the middle and it looks like one piece. What more could you want? See? So\nthat was still even in the creative arts a\u2014 a-\u2014a fact that people respected me for\ndoing this. And reversely, I advertised for an assistant and one of my friends and\ncolleagues called up and said, we lost one big account, so we have to lay off a\ncouple of designers. We highly recommend so and so. He is Jewish, but he\u2019s a very\nnice guy. But he is a very nice guy. I hired him, but that still went on, you see, and\nthat\u2019s in the liberal arts. So maybe that\u2019s why my friends in England want to duck\nout from the words on the monument.\nAugust 7, 1998",

Today is September 25\"\", we\nare continuing from an interview that was begun on August 7\" of 1998, this is now\nSeptember 25\", 1998. This is tape three, side A. Okay, can you hear me now Mr.\nMasters?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You had been telling me about five years of freelance work after 10 years\nworking with CBS.",
        "A: This Washington CBS station, which was, at one time, owned and operated by\n\u201cThe Washington Post,\u201d but it was also Washington\u2019s CBS station and we did\noriginate it, Washington being Washington, presidential broadcasts and so forth.\nAnd I did [indecipherable] I did some at the White House with President\nEisenhower, subsequently with President Kennedy. We did a great big show at\nthe \u2014 at the Sheraton Park Hotel, which was called, Dinner with the President,\nseven cameras, prime time, with Kennedy in attendance and Johnson in\nattendance, and a cast of stars. Josh White, Hanya Holm ballet, the CBS\nsymphony orchestra. Robert Preston was the MC, the movie actor who did, you\nknow, \u201c76 Trombones,\u201d etcetera. And Josh \u2014 I said Josh White, the folk singer.\nThe Clancy brothers. These were big names at the time, and Judy Collins and \u2014\nSeptember 25, 1998\nand I did a lot of id \u2014 scenery and had to build a stage because they didn\u2019t have\none. And had to build dressing rooms downstairs. And that was quite \u2014 quite an\nexciting project, I enjoyed it thoroughly. I remember President Kennedy sitting\nthere at the table facing the stage when his alarm went off. His \u2014 his wristwatch\nalarm to tell him that he had to \u2014 only so much more time to \u2014 to stay. And he\nmade some joke about it, he was very quick with things like that. He was very\nfunny. Very, very nice event, very warm hearted. I remember they had written\nthings especially for him. There\u2019s an old American song called, \u201c\u201cWe Want No\nIrish Here,\u201d which was, you know, prejudice against the Irish immigrants. And\nthey sang that facetiously, and lots of fun. Well done, great success. So I \u2014 I af \u2014\nyou want to know what happened afterwards in \u2014 after my television years, I\nfreelanced for the other networks. I did the six orbital flight for ABC. There was\nsome scenery and some background material. I did inauguration of Kennedy for\nABC, when it snowed so hard, we had great problems because it was almost\nimpossible to get to the capital. On the way the truck broke down, and we had to\nget this show on the air. So we \u2014 we had a little pickup truck with \u2014 with \u2014 to \u2014 to\nbuild the booth at the stand facing the inauguration platform. And we called the\nAmerican Automobile Association to help us, and they said, we can\u2019t help anyone\nwho 1s not blocking traffic on the \u2014 on the parade route \u2014 on the route. So we said,\nthank you very much. And there were three of us in that pickup truck, my\nSeptember 25, 1998\nconstruction man and his assistant and I. And we pushed the truck to where it was\nblocking traffic in the inauguration route because we \u2014 we obviously had to get\nthere. And without making another phone call, a roving AAA service truck got us\nstarted and we \u2014 in \u2014 in the snow, and we made it to the capital. The next near\ndisaster was that the moisture of the snow that was melting on top of the flimsily\nconstructed booth was leaking into the booth and short circuiting the cameras. And\n\u2014 and w \u2014I mean, we an \u2014 we knew we would short circuit the cameras. Well, I \u2014\nwhen you\u2019re a television art director, one thing you know how to do is where to\nget help quickly and who is reliable to come through and so on. I mean it \u2014 this\nwas in the days of live television, 1-1t might be the sort of thing where somebody\nwanted to have a sailboat in the studio in the two hours and you would find one\nand get one into the studio in two hours. I once had a taxi pick up a chestnut man,\nyou know, who \u2014 in the street, with his little oven, roasting \u2014 there was only one in\nWashington, in New York they used to be on every corner in the winter. And I\nknew where he was and we needed him for a live show, and I had a taxi pull up\nnext to him and offer him, I think 10 bucks if he came. And h-he did, and they\nloaded his whole paraphernalia, the hot stove and we had him in the studio, you\nknow. That\u2019s how we used to do things. Well, I knew a \u2014 a construction \u2014a-\u2014a\nroofing person in \u2014 in \u2014 1n \u2014 in Virginia, and I got him out in the snow to get \u2014\nfight his way through to the capital to lay that stuff on top of the booth to keep the\nSeptember 25, 1998\nwater out. And in those days we were not pooled but this \u2014 we \u2014 I was doing ABC,\nand the people I had \u2014 used to work with was ceeb \u2014 from CBS were next door in\nthe next booth. And I went over to a man with whom I\u2019d had many skirmishes\nbecause I felt that the \u2014 the \u2014 what shall I say, the \u2014 the good of the country\npreceded our little professional skirmishes. And I said to him, Bill, your cameras\nare going to short out. And he said, oh my God, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right. What can I\ndo? And I said, I have an \u2014 I happen to have a roofing guy come who 1s laying\ninsulation on top of my booth, I\u2019Il have him lay some on top of your booth if\nyou\u2019re willing to pay him for what he is doing. He\u2019s \u2014 he won\u2019t charge you much.\nAnd he was so grateful, you know, and I\u2019m sure that that kept him \u2014 kept CBS on\nthe air for the coverage of the Kennedy inauguration. When it was over somebody\nstole all the furniture, even though to get to the booth, you had to get up a ladder.\nYou know, it was a\u2014 a rather improvised arrangement, a \u2014 a plywood nailed\ntogether to make a platform and so on. And somehow they managed to unload that\nfurniture during the night following the inauguration. And wasn\u2019t much furniture,\nbut it was a desk and whatever, you know, for the newscasters a chair and a rug,\nand it was gone. Those were the exciting days of live television, I don\u2019t think it\nquite goes on that way now. Was really wonderful. After that I did some shows for\nthe United States Information Agency, ITV, and my assistant \u2014 my \u2014 my partner\nand I did a number of shows for them which were seen all over the world, they had\nSeptember 25, 1998\nan English learning thing that we-went international and was probably seen by\nmore people than any television show ever se \u2014 as a series. And we tried to give\nthem \u2014 whe-when we came they looked rather amateurish and \u2014 and we were\nretained to do a\u2014 a f\u2014a couple of seasons, I believe, of thei \u2014 all their shows,\ninternationally seen. And we tried to make them look like network television, and\nI think we did. Politically \u2014 when I say politically, I mean professional politically,\nit was rough going. Very, very difficult to deal, because \u2014 to deal with these\npeople, because television and \u2014 and \u2014 and government don\u2019t mix easily. The\nbureaucracy 1s too \u2014 too slow, too complex, and too \u2014 frequently too f\u2014 too\nunreasonable to do things that \u2014 that need simple and quick solutions and \u2014 and w-\nwe \u2014 we managed it as best we could, but it was not altogether a happy \u2014 a happy\nsituation. They would say, for instance, we have \u2014 we need to hire additional help,\nand we haven\u2019t got the government slots, so why don\u2019t you hire them under\ncontract? And that\u2019s not altogether proper, but again, it \u2014 absolutely necessary at\ntimes, you \u2014 you \u2014 you can\u2019t get \u2014 if you can\u2019t get the work done, you can\u2019t get on\nthe air, and if you \u2014 a deadline 1s a deadline and so forth. And s \u2014 then you have to\nmake, as an outsider, decisions whether you want to do this if \u2014 if it \u20141f you can\nsee its urgency. And then, very frequently, you don\u2019t get the backup it requires to\ncontinue doing it. Like they would say, we have a person we \u2014 whom we want you\nto hire and you hire that person and recognize that this 1s a big mistake, but you\u2019re\nSeptember 25, 1998\nstuck in an in-between situation. I-It\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s not altogether a \u2014 you \u2014 you really\nhave to walk a tightrope of \u2014 of constant difficult professional ethical decisions\nhow you handle this, recognizing that the need on the one hand, downright\npatriotic need in \u2014 in the case of \u2014 I mean, they \u2014 they say they\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re not\na ministry of propaganda and I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019ll accept that, but naturally they are trying to\ntell the world about what America is doing, and to give people news that would\notherwise not have an unbiased news report of any international event. So, the\nresponsibility weighs heavily on you, and you try and do the best you can, and\nwhile you are doing it, you are being hampered by all kinds of nonsense. So that,\nas I say, is not altogether easy. After a period of time, I had \u2014 when was it? Yes, I\nworked f \u2014 I was then asked by the office of economic opportunity to work on the\nwar on poverty, President\u2019s Johnson\u2019s war on poverty. And I became its first art\ndirector. Now, for \u2014 for Sargent Shriver, President Kennedy\u2019s brother-in-law, and\nwe have been friends ever since. And that was a-again, a very fascinating\nexperience, because pa \u2014 the war on poverty was a \u2014 a thing that if you were\ninvolved in it, you were enthused to the point of \u2014 of personal dedication. I see\nimages of that time where 20 or more people \u2014 20 of us would get a mailing ready,\nand it didn\u2019t matter what rank you were, there were the top officials and \u2014 and the\nbottom officials in tennis shoes, running around tables, stuffing envelopes to get\nthe thing out that had to be out the next day. And from my point of view, I\nSeptember 25, 1998\ndesigned the image of the whole thing, the \u2014 the \u2014 the logos, the emblems, the\nvisual impact which was necessary because we had to do everything we could to\nmuster the enthusiasm of a \u2014 a \u2014 a nation that was not always enthusiastic about\nthe specific things we were trying to do. If you tried to open a job corps camp\nsomewhere where you were training underprivileged youngsters, these were\nteenagers and \u2014 and people were afraid of them. They were racial \u2014 there were\nracist prejudices, where they said we don\u2019t want that next to our town, you know,\nand th-the \u2014 the kind of thing we had to try and overcome. I remember incidents\nwhere in some job corps camp young men stole a car and drove it into a station\nwagon with a family and several members of that family were killed. And the next\nday there was an outcry and the persec \u2014 across the country saying this program is\nno good. Well, it \u2014 nothing to do with the quality of the program and he would\nhave stolen the car if he had not been in the job corps presumably, and no reason\nto assume otherwise. Bu \u2014 and to \u2014 to \u2014 to then crucify the program because s-\nsomebody had deviated what was the kind of thing that we were at times up\nagainst. There were a\u2014a story possibly apic \u2014 apocryphal that went around, that\nthe mayor of a town who didn\u2019t want to have a job corps camp next to him said,\nthese are going to be the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 I \u2014 I have se \u2014 now the camp had already\nopened and he was trying to get it closed down. And the mayor said, th-the \u2014 it \u2014\nit\u2019s predominantly blacks in this program, and the official from the war on poverty\nSeptember 25, 1998\noffice of economic opportunity said, as a matter of fact, it\u2019s 50 percent white. It \u2014\nit\u2019s no \u2014 as a matter of fact, it\u2019s only 50 percent black. And the mayor responded,\nwell, you see, if it were 50 percent white, that would make it all right. Which, as I\nsay, possibly apocryphally illustrates y \u2014 the absurdity of the prejudice. The \u2014 then\nthere was this \u2014 a s \u2014 a sudden solution for some of our problems because some\nbrilliant mind, probably Sargent Shriver invented Head Start. Head Start being\na preschool program when children are perceived to be cute and \u2014 and little, and\nnot a threat. And yet, in and of itself a most useful thing because the learning\nprocess should start pre school, as I think we have all come to realize. And that\nwas started with a tea at the White House. It was inaugurated and announced, and\n\u2014 and I designed its \u2014 its \u2014 its logo and so on of a couple of building blocks,\nsymbolically. Lady Bird Johnson officiated at this opening, of which I had like\ntwo days notice, and it\u2019s still in existence now. And I just had a letter from Sarge\nShriver about it, because I wrote a short article about how we \u2014 we \u2014 the obstacle\ncourse of getting that logo in to the White House tea in \u2014 with \u2014 with no advance\nnotice. And it was not without problems, because one of the things the legislation\nhad said was, the maximum feasible participation of the poor. And it was not easy\nto get \u2014 to recruit poor people who understood the state of the art methodology of\ndealing with pre-school children, because many of them had themselves been\ntreated very casually, or neglected in their own preschool period or \u2014 and later.\nSeptember 25, 1998\nAnd to then put them into a responsible positions to do it in such a way as not to\ndamage the preschool children was \u2014 was not \u2014 well, it was quite a problem. Still,\nmuch good was done over a difficult course. I worked for them for \u2014 for 10 years.\nIt started in a real f \u2014 peculiar way. I mean, they had asked me to \u2014 to help, and I\ncame as a volunteer, and then they wanted more help, and more help. And I said,\nlisten, you guys, I can\u2019t spend all my time here, I have to make a living. And they\nsaid, do you want to do it as an outside person, or as a staff person? Well, having\nhad the experience with USA television, where as an outside person I found it\nterribly hard, I said staff. And they said, well, what would it take to hire you? And\nI s\u2014mind you, I had really believed when I was first asked to do pro bono\ncontributions that a-all the people working for this program were volunteers and it\nturned out that all of them were staff and I was a volunteer. So I became a staff\nperson. And I remember in the beginning of my being a staff person, which meant\nsomebody gave me a desk and a telephone, you know, and everything else was\nimprovisation in the beginning, there was a writer who shared my office, as did\nindeed, five writers. But this particular one told me of his hardship that he was\ndoing this as volunteer work and he hoped to get a job eventually, and that his\nchildren were hungry and neighbors were looking after them and so forth. And I\nsaid, you have to \u2014 you know, they are all so busy with what they are doing, they\nare not thinking of you and me. And I had to go and say, look, fish or cut bait.\nSeptember 25, 1998\nEither you \u2014 or I can\u2019t come as much as you want me to come and work. And then\nthey gave me a job. And he said, darn it, I\u2019m gonna do it. And he walked down to\npersonnel and never came back. He had told them to hire him more or not and they\nsaid not. So e-e \u2014 these were rough days. I mean, you never knew what was going\nto \u2014 what was going to happen next. And \u2014 and we moved from place to place into\nimprovised offices. And at the \u2014 at the times Shriver had two jobs, Peace Corps\nand poverty program and so on. But we did an enormous amount of good, I am\nquite convinced that some of the \u2014 the enthusiasm that was mustered, of you \u2014\nyou\u2019ve never seen government offices like that where people are really \u2014 I mean,\nthey would work into the night and through the night for nothing, to get things out,\nget things done. It was a marvelous experience. Of course, there came the time 10\nyears later when the administration changed and the new one decided that there\nwas no more poverty in the United States, along with many other myth, you\nknow, I mean the \u2014 the perception that poverty is priv \u2014 predominantly Afro-\nAmerican is quite false. It is by no means that. It 1s, percentage-wise there are poor\n\u2014 poor whites in \u2014 in \u2014 in Appalachia and \u2014 and not only in Appalachia. Because\nof the migration to the cities to find jobs for the \u2014 from \u2014 from the rural\ncommunities, and then the disillusionment when there aren\u2019t enough jobs, and\nliving in city slums and so on, this 1s a syndrome that 1s true across the country. It\nis probably better now than it has been, which doesn\u2019t mean its \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it\u2019s good.\nSeptember 25, 1998\nBut the awareness was, I think initiated \u2014 well, I don\u2019t want \u2014 I \u2014 I wanted to say\nby \u2014 by this program and \u2014 and it\u2019s not quite true, because of course, Roosevelt\nbefore has done \u2014 had done tremendous work. But that had begun to perhaps\ndissipate a bit, until it was revived by \u2014 by Johnson, who \u2014 who knew what it was\nlike to be poor.",
        "Q: Can I ask you to give me a time frame? When \u2014 what years \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, well, let\u2019s see, time frame. I worked for the Office of Economic\nOpportunity from October \u201964 to August \u201974, 10 years roughly. And then when \u2014\nwhen there was supposedly no more poverty, we were dispersed and I was sent to\nthe General Services Administration, which many perceived to be a fate worse\nthan death. But by that time, having been in government for 10 years, I had\ninevitably become involved in some other battles, which is to make the\ngovernment look better, which I think is terribly important. The government \u2014 you\nknow, we \u2014 we tend to be cynical about what the government does, and the\ngovernment does some things extremely well. Extremely well. And hides its \u2014 its\nlight under a bushel, where \u2014 where you don\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t see what \u2014 how well\nthey are doing certain things. I was al \u2014 I-I\u2019m not saying this is true of \u2014 of every\naspect, but it\u2019s true of many of their functions. I remember when a \u2014 a thing was\nintroduced in the general service administration, where \u2014 to help citizens with\nquestions about government, which if you\u2019ve ever tried it by yourself, can be very,\nSeptember 25, 1998\nvery difficult. You call up and they say that\u2019s not in my job description, or the \u2014\nyou \u2014 you \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2014 doesn\u2019t belong here and it belongs over there and then you \u2014\nyou have a sheet of paper in front of you full of telephone numbers going down as\nyou\u2019re being referred from one place to the other. Well, we in the General Service\nAdministration at that time set out to \u2014 to \u2014 to end this kind of irritating obstacle\ncourse. And we had a \u2014 an \u2014 an office specializing in giving you the right answer\nand steering you the right way. And I was skeptical that this would work. So I\ncalled them up. They couldn\u2019t tell that I was calling from the same building, you\nknow, and I asked \u2014 I\u2014 I got a young Afro-American woman on the phone, and I\nasked her a question which I knew she could not possibly know the answer, it was\na complex question that required some research. And sh \u2014 she said, I\u2019m sorry, I\ncan\u2019t answer this right away. I will call you in half an hour with the answer. And I\nsaid, thank you very much, and I so \u2014 said to myself, yeah sure. In about 27\nminutes she called me up with the right answer. Now, I was absolutely bowled\nover, because it \u2014 believe me, it was a difficult, tough question that she had to\nresearch and she did it with no complaints, no fuss. I was very impressed. Tha \u2014\ntha \u2014 I hesitate to say that I believe the program no longer exists, and I wonder\nhow easy it is now to get information. But it was a move in the right direction.\nWhen I say I\u2019m not sure it exists, I learned another big lesson 1-1-in \u2014 in \u2014 in\ngovernment, and that is, I thought, when we had real progress, like by the poverty\nSeptember 25, 1998\nprogram, visible progress, or with an invention such as this answering of citizen\u2019s\nproblems, you know, that there was no going back, that you could not \u2014 that no\nfuture administration would be foolish enough to go back to where, you know, it\nwould continue to move forward. That\u2019s not true. They are not only going back at\n\u2014 to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to square one, they go to 50 years before square one, and there\u2019s\nsome common syndromes that I came to observe. For instance, a person fro \u2014\nappointed politically, either party, doesn\u2019t make any difference, to some office and\nheads maybe a department, maybe a division. Even smaller sub-units. You get the\nimpression that the first thing they want to do is to write a letter home to mom to\nsay I\u2019m not at the feet of the president, I have his ear. And whether they want to\ninvent a new identity for this particular department, division, whatever, regardless\nthat it\u2019s part of a bigger thing, the government, or if you want to go one step down,\nof \u2014 of \u2014 of one of the agencies of the government, 1t doesn\u2019t matter, they want\ntheir own identity. So they \u2014 for \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m speaking as a visual person. So all of\na sudden you have all these things spring up, and their taste generally runs to the\n19\" century, and not the 20\" because they haven\u2019t heard of what things look like\nin the 20\" century. But I\u2019m \u2014 when I\u2019m speaking visually, believe me that\u2019s\nsymbolic of everything else, they \u2014 they tend to hark back to something they ha \u2014\nheard of how things are, where, and they want to imitate, and since they are not\nnecessarily chosen for being innovators, they tend to retard the pro \u2014 the progress\nSeptember 25, 1998\nand go back to, before it was when it was already outmoded. Well, that\u2019s how it is.\nSo one has to be constantly alert, to keep things going forward. And people get\nreally doing that at times. So \u2014 and I\u2019m not even mentioning politics, I\u2019m\nmentioning simply the bureaucratic process, which is unavoidable to \u2014 s-so it\nwould seem, because innovators who are capable of not that common a specimen.\nWell, after many a fight, some of which I\u2019ve won, I di \u2014 for instance, I designed\nthe building signs in the federal triangle that you still see where the newscasters\nstand in front of the thing that says Department of Justice, or U.S. Department of\nAgriculture, whatever. They are these vertical standing brownish colored things\nwith very clear lettering, with a little bulge forward so you can read the title. And\nthey are made of reinforced fiberglass. And I had to get those accepted by the fine\narts commission. They were supposedly supposed to be a pilot program for all of\nWashington and then the whole country. The federal triangle being the\nexperimental area. When I \u2014 when I presented it to the fine arts commission, they\nsaid, how long are these signs good for? And I said \u2014 I was about to say, oh, state\nof the art, they last long time, when Carter Brown, who was the chairman of the\nfine arts commission anticipated that and said, what we are afraid of is that they\nwill last too long, because after 10 years our tastes will have changed and we\u2019ll get\ntired of looking at them, and they won\u2019t give us any money to do new ones if\nthey\u2019re still good. So I said, they will last exactly 10 years. And two things\nSeptember 25, 1998\nhappened. One, they are still there after, I think, what is it? 25 years. And they are\ngetting shabby, and still they are not replacing them. And secondly, it never\nhappened that they were \u2014 that they were done all over th-the \u2014 the town, or all\nover the country. A few were done by the initiative of some agencies here and\nthere, but never beyond that. I-It just \u2014 not because they didn\u2019t like them, not\nbecause they weren\u2019t good, they just didn\u2019t get around to it, to it \u2014 it doesn\u2019t\nfollow if something is efficient and works that this plan \u2014 that this plan will be\npermitted.",

        "A: Yes. The \u2014 when \u2014 \u201974 \u2014I\u2019d gone slightly beyond that \u2014 was when the Office\nof Economic Opportunity ceased to exist and I was transferred to the General\nService Administration and I had said that I had, by now, become a fighter for\nmaking the government look better to the s \u2014 to the citizen. And to try and\nintroduce some, at least semblance of the 20\" century while it lasted, to the\ngeneral population. Whereas everything tended to be done backwards, visually, I\nmean, a government department. When I did the signs in the federal triangle, I had\nSeptember 25, 1998\nto find a sign that would be compatible with the earlier tendency to make a\ngovernment office look like a Greek temple, because why? A Greek temple is \u2014 is\nold and solid, and the government, like banks, built like Greek temples, as we used\nto do, were deemed to be more solid if they looked like a Greek temple. Well then\ncame the \u2014 the craving for modernity, and we got the kind of new deal architecture\nof an empty \u2014 beginnings of the influences of Bauhaus in \u2014 in \u2014 in style. And that\nin turn led to a degree of Bauhaus fatigue. That you didn\u2019t want plain boxes that\nwere functional. The idea of \u2014 of the Bauhaus being that if it\u2019s functional and \u2014\nand \u2014 and simple, and 1-1 \u2014 and efficient, it 1s beautiful, and it does not require\ndecoration. And I was brought up with that in art school, that simple, if it\u2019s\nfunctional, it\u2019s beautiful, okay? Now look what\u2019s happened since. We \u2014 because of\nthe \u2014 what I call the Bauhaus fatigue, we started with arbitrary and often ugly\ndecora \u2014 over decoration. We had put flying buttresses onto buildings as a sort of\nharking back to when we were building thi \u2014 Greek temples. And in post-modern\nyou see arbitrary archways that lead nowhere, attached to buildings as \u2014 as\ndecoration. And \u2014 a-and th-the answer, if any \u2014 no \u2014 I\u2014I-\u2014I\u2019m not suggesting\nthere is an answer, the answer is that no matter what we have, the only constant\nthing is \u2014 is change. We are going to go to something else, because you want\nsomething else, and it doesn\u2019t mean that it is necessarily better than its\npredecessor. That would be nice, and \u2014 but again, like I was saying about \u2014 a-\nSeptember 25, 1998\nabout progress in government, I \u2014 you mustn\u2019t accept the notion that because the\nultimate has been achieved, that it will therefore stay in \u2014 in \u2014 even in its \u2014 in its\ndegree of quality. This is true in the arts. It\u2014 one could make one heck of an\nargument of saying that beyond Beethoven, you know, maybe we should have\nstopped there. Well, that\u2019s not fair, because look at some of the great things that\nhave come to us since then. Whether they are better than the classic, the role\nmodels, is \u2014 1s arguable. Another thing is that \u2014 that today\u2019s art modern is\ntomorrow\u2019s classic. We had been talking before about the Beatles, Elvis Presley,\nand some of us were shocked when they came on the scene. And some of us now\nlook upon these manifestations as classical, compared to hard rock, compared to\nwhere we are now. We are nostalgic for the Beatles and for Elvis Presley. You\nsee? And it\u2019s amazing how you can apply this formula to all kinds of completely\ndifferent things, as I have just done, and I can go beyond that, it is in \u2014 in the ci \u2014\nCivil Rights Movement, which I embraced with great enthusiasm, having just been\nthrough six years of war to f\u2014 to fight against racism. And I would have\narguments with people on all sides. I\u2019'd have arguments with some of my Afro-\nAmerican friends who would say ha \u2014 I had an Afro-American partner with whom\nI had va \u2014 hardly any arguments, we were on the same wavelengths. But with\nsome of them who said that the persecution of Afro-Americans was as bad as the\nHolocaust, and I would say th ho \u2014 ho \u2014 hold it, hold it right there.\nSeptember 25, 1998\n[indecipherable] I will agree with one thing, that if \u2014 1f you are running away\nfrom a lynch mob, it probably doesn\u2019t make any difference whether you\u2019re\nrunning from the Holocaust or from the lynch mob. But, apart from that, the\nnotion that there is a federal program for your extermination and murder is\ndifferent than even the collusion and permissiveness of a government that allows\nlynch mobs. That \u2014 this is not an advocacy of lynch mobs, obviously, but \u2014 but the\npoint is, the idea that it was legislated to murder everybody. Men, women,\nchildren, old people, whatever, 1s unique. And therefore, the comparison does not\nhold, okay? I remember that when I was in t \u2014 in television, and my Afro-\nAmerican assistant, who later became my partner when we both quit, wa \u2014 there\nwas one sort of greasy spoon restaurant owned by a Greek man on the corner. The\nonly place you could eat outside, before we had a cafeteria. Well, sometimes\nsomebody would say, let\u2019s talk about next week\u2019s show over lunch at Frank\u2019s,\nthat restaurant. And that meant that I would have to go, and my assistant could not\ngo because of being Afro-American, they didn\u2019t serve black people in the\nrestaurant. Which was embarrassing for me. I could either say let\u2019s not eat, which\nI wasn't always e-empowered to say, depending on who wanted to eat where and\nwhen. Mind you, they would sell my partner Joe sandwiches to take out. There\nwas aS \u2014 back counter, and he would sometimes have to do that, because he \u2014 he \u2014\nhe \u2014 well, I don\u2019t know, he didn\u2019t have time to have a sandwich prepared at home\nSeptember 25, 1998\n\u2014 have to eat. And we worked around the clock often, you know, so I mean \u2014 came\nthe Civil Rights Act in the 60s and I said, Joe, are you gonna eat at Frank\u2019s? And\nhe said, I been thinking about that. And I said, well, I can see both sides of the\nargument. Why should you take your custom to a place that wouldn\u2019t serve you?\nIn fact, the waitress, when the Civil Rights Act was passed, told me at the meeting\nthat they \u2014 I think I\u2019m going to quit because we are going to have to serve niggers.\nAnd I made some remark saying, well I think it\u2019s time that that act was passed,\nyou know. Well, Joe said, on the other hand, if I don\u2019t go in to eat at Joe\u2019s, what\nwas the point of getting the Civil Rights Act? So he said, I think I will. On the\nother hand, he said, I will fully understand if some of my race do not go in to eat\nin restaurants that were segregated until yesterday, because \u2014 and here comes the\nimportant sentence \u2014 not everybody can be a pioneer. And I think that\u2019s true. I\nthink that there are people who are willing to fight and to be confrontational, and\ntell people, who say I\u2014I-\u2014I don\u2019t think I\u2019m up to that. And you can try and \u2014 and\n\u2014 and \u2014 and influence people, but basically it is also true that some people are\npioneers and some people are not. You need the pioneers and you must accept that\nthere are some people who are not. So, when we got into subsequent discussions, I\nremember some people I considered racist in the poverty program, saying, you\nknow, we\u2019d come out of the building from work and there would be some news\nheadlines out in the street, and they would say that Stokey Carmichael, or Rap\nSeptember 25, 1998\nBrown, aren\u2019t they awful troublemakers, what have you. Now, Martin Luther\nKing, that\u2019s a different proposition. And I said, aren\u2019t you forgetting that that\u2019s\nhow you looked at Martin, until the more extreme Stokey Carmichaels and Rap\nBrown came on the scene, by which the \u2014 yesterdays revolutionary becomes the\nclassicist, just like we were saying in the arts, or in other things, you see? They \u2014\nthe extreme of today makes the extreme of yesterday the conservative. In fact,\nsometimes pathetically so. And \u2014 and that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s how \u2014 ho-how that played,\nand it was an ongoing \u2014 an ongoing discussion, and I feel that it has progressed.\nBut one thing we learned in the poverty program is that we were trying to redress\npast wrongs. If you ask the redressee, have we redressed wrongs enough, the\nanswer is inevitably that we have barely scratched the surface. That leads to\nsomeone wanting to put on the brakes, if only for political reasons, because if you\nare doing something that is unpopular with the general public because they say\nyou are redressing too much, and unpopular with the redressees, because they say\nyou are not redressing enough, you are losing on both sides. You are losing\npolitically and you are losing the things you are setting out to do. So, you have a\nvery, very, very serious problem, and you inevitably begin to repress a bit together\nwith redressing. In other words, when you put the brakes on redressing wrongs,\nyou are repressing th-the people. By that I mean you are denying them some of the\nredressing they would like to have, because they \u2014 you \u2014 you can\u2019t do as much as\nSeptember 25, 1998\nthey want you to do. So, this \u2014 the rather delicate balance between redressing and\nrepressing \u2014 and by repressing I don\u2019t mean any \u2014 any acts of \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of\nkeeping somebody down, I\u2019m merely calling it the insufficient redressing which is\nperceived as repression, all right? So when you do this \u2014 this \u2014 this delicate\nbalance. You come to the point where it\u2019s almost impossible to walk the tightrope\nand your political opponents will scream bloody murder that you are redressing\ntoo much. And then you have protesters outside your building saying you are not\nredressing enough. Now, Shriver had a great talent for this, he would go down on\nthe sidewalk to the protesters, invite them to his office and sit down with them and\nreason with them. His successors barricaded themselves in the building, stopped\nthe elevator service, which again illustrates the misconception that things that\nmove forward continue to move forward, they don\u2019t. Well, I found that 1-1n \u2014 in\nsome ways progression continues to progress, perhaps. An example that comes to\nmind is anti-Semitism which probably belongs here. When I first came to this\ncountry and \u2014 1n \u2014 in \u2014 in the \u2014 the end of the 40s, the beaches around\nWashington had signs saying Gentiles only. Not whites only, Gentiles only. And\nit was in \u2014 understood without saying that that meant white Gentiles, okay? And\nthere was Father Coughlin and there was Bilbo up on the hill spouting anti-\nSemitism and the likes of which we have mercifully forgotten, how blatant and \u2014\nand \u2014 and crude that anti-sin \u2014 Semitism wa \u2014 seemed acceptable on the floor of\nSeptember 25, 1998\nthe house. Now, shall we say that has become unfashionable, or deemed primitive,\nwhatever, I don\u2019t know. And I find it difficult to picture that it would return in\ntotality. Perhaps there\u2019s some elements of the extreme so-called religious right that\nwould like to revive those days. I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t admit it at this point,\nbecause as I say, it\u2019s unfashionable, and recognized to be primitive, which I think\nis a good thing. But we shouldn\u2019t delude ourselves that there aren\u2019t places where\nthe attitude exists. I find it exists in \u2014 in Europe to a \u2014 to a considerable extent,\nmore overtly than in \u2014 in the United States now. I was told yesterday by a man\nwho told me that his father was a Nazi, that there is m \u2014 that in Germany, even\nthough there is this movement of \u2014 of \u2014 of the young who \u2014 who \u2014 who abhor their\nNazi past, or the Nazi past of their parents, and this man abhors the Nazi past of\nhis father, but he says his father was unemployed, and he was an engineer and he\nwas repairing radios to make a living of sorts. And when Hitler came to power he\ngot a job as an engineer. So he thought that \u2014 he \u2014 he said, what they are doing to\nthe Jews is \u2014 that\u2019s bad, bad. But look what it has done for me. And von\nStauffenberg, who tried to assassinate Hitler 1s considered a traitor by one and\nall, by the vast majority of people. I found that shocking, I didn\u2019t know that, I\nthought \u2014 and I still believe there are segments of the people who consider him a\nresistance person. This \u2014 this man told me that there isn\u2019t a single memorial or\nmonument to Stauffenberg, because vast majority of people consider him a\nSeptember 25, 1998\ntraitor. Now, I\u2014 I\u2019ve \u2014I\u2014I find that \u2014 I mean, that came as a shock. I did not\nknow that. I thought that the disillusionment with Hitler and \u2014 and by saying\ndisillusionment I\u2019m implying that there was an illusionment before, and \u2014 and\nthere certainly was. And some of it, if you will understand the burden, like the\nman who didn\u2019t have a job that got a job, like the peculiar historic situation where\nyou have a German Reich that was 90 years old. Before that there were duchies\nand principalities of \u2014 of Munich, Saxony, whatever. Prussia. And that after\nlosing World War I, there was \u2014 first of all, it was kept intact, as opposed to the\nAustro-Hungarian empire, which was 2,000 years old and was completely\nchopped up because of the ethnic elements, all of whom had been caught in this\nthing we just mentioned about th-th-the tightrope between repression and\nredressing, because if an Austrian emperor or Austrian government tried to redress\nthe demands of the Hungarians, or the Serbs, or the Czechs, it was politically\nunpopular at home and deemed insufficient by the recipients of the programs, who\nwanted out, never mind how and just sooner better than later. As indeed we are\nnow seeing in Bosnia and in all these places where small minorities, whether they\nare viable or not, completely not caring about whether they can form a viable\nentity, want to be nationalistically independent. Even the most reasonable among\nthem, and I have talked to some of the most reasonable, will say that first we must\nhave our independence and then we can attempt to confederate. In the meantime,\nSeptember 25, 1998\nthe process of getting that independence is bloody and \u2014 and destructive. And\nunreasonable. And \u2014 and there\u2019s nothing we seem to be able to do about it because\nwe don\u2019t necessarily progress. Now, in Germany, this \u2014 this relatively recent\nempire of \u2014 of \u2014 of 90 year old confederation, they yearned to be powerful again.\nUnderstandably, the Austro-Hungarians never had any dream of becoming a\npowerful empire again, because that would mean gluing together the thing where\nthe glue hadn\u2019t held, o-of \u2014 of \u2014 of ethnic minorities, you see? So they never had\nthat ambition, except perhaps in the case of some Austrians who were pan \u2014 pan-\nGerman thinkers, and thought as part of the German empire, they could see some\ngreatness again. But I wouldn\u2019t say there were many until Hitler demonstrated\nthat that dream of be \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of regaining power for this German entity could\nbe realized, in that he was immensely successful politically and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nmilitarily. And took over one country after the other, right? And if your victorious\narmies are marching into country after country with a minimum of casualties, and\nasserting themselves as \u2014 as the masters of the world, it\u2019s probably hard for the\naverage citizen not to stand and cheer at \u2014 at the sidelines, when all that\ntechnological hardware is rolling past you and \u2014 and the pageantry, at which they\nwere very good. They were very, very skilled in visual pageantry. Well, the \u2014 I see\na bridge here to something else we wanted to cover, which is Vietnam. The bridge\nis this; when the Vietnam situation started, I, after my six years of war and being\nSeptember 25, 1998\nan officer in the British army, in an elite unit, thought that that was the reasonable\nthing to do. I thought that the domino theory, which had been demonstrated by\nHitler, that is you don\u2019t stop him when he first occupies the Rhineland, then he\nwill occupy Austria, Czechoslovakia and then continue the rest of western\nEurope, all right? If you \u2014 what you should have done, clearly, was to stop him\nwhen he occupied the Rhineland. Well, the parallels seemed obvious. The big\nthreat now was communism. If they took over Vietnam and one didn\u2019t stop them\nthere, they would take over the rest of southeast Asia. And not necessarily as a\npopular movement, but as a enslaving kind of mechanism. Well, true or false,\nright? What subsequently changed my mind, not very long after, was the painful\nrealization that just before \u2014 because you are right \u2014 and even that, of course,\nbecomes \u2014 is arguable, but even if you perceive yourself to be right, you can\u2019t\nundertake things that are \u2014 that you\u2019re going to lose. It\u2019s impractical. So for\npragmatic reasons if nothing else, the idea of subduing communism in Vietnam,\nwhich turned out to be a popular nationalistic movement, if you are going to \u2014 to\nfight a losing war, the answer obviously is don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t go in the first place. That\nmeans admitting that you can\u2019t do it. And \u2014 and that takes a lot \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s\nsometimes harder to do for a head of state to say, we think we ought to be doing\nthis, but we can\u2019t. It\u2019s harder to do than to say okay, go. A-And then afterwards,\nwhen you have enormous numbers of people killed and \u2014 and maimed, there 1s, of\nSeptember 25, 1998\ncourse, no \u2014 no easy way back. You \u2014 you can\u2019t bring them back. But, in a sense,\nthose who were afraid of a domino theory had their \u2014 their fears borne out to a\nconsiderable extent. After awhile when \u2014 when \u2014 when communism itself became\nthe image of a failed methodology, the whole thing seems redundant. I mean, what\ncommunism were we afraid of? Russian communism, Chinese communism. Well,\nRussian communism as \u2014 1s \u2014 1-1s \u2014 1s gone. Chinese communism 1s\nmetamorphosing in all \u2014 into all kinds of other things. Whether we are justifiably\nafraid of that now, is really, A, it \u2014 it \u2014 it doesn\u2019t apply in the same sense as it\napplied at that time. And there were probably a couple of other factors in there. I\nthink that we are still in this country resentful of the former colonial powers,\nbecause after all, we were under British rule, and so, if the British were pushed out\nof the Persian gulf, that didn\u2019t really hurt us. I-If the French were pushed out of\nVietnam, Indochina, that \u2014 we were gonna do it better. We were gonna show\nthem that 1-1t spilt \u2014 the failure was because they were colonial powers. Well, our\ntrying to get into these things with limited experience and assume a pseudo-\ncolonial role in c \u2014 in \u2014 1n countries 1-in the Persian gulf, or in \u2014 in \u2014 1n\u20141in\nsoutheast Asia, hasn\u2019t worked out too well. And \u2014 because the world is readjusting\nitself and \u2014 and the \u2014 yesterday\u2019s methods progressed as na \u2014 as \u2014 it begins to be\nquestionable whether progress 1s progress as we perceive it. And also, it doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily go forward. It goes \u2014 I-I would think that if you asked people the \u2014 the\nSeptember 25, 1998\nacademic question whether they would prefer the Persian gulf to be as it was,\nwhich means playing footsy with the shah, who was not necessarily a democratic\nleader, we\u2019d probably happily settle for that at \u2014 at this moment, instead of what\nwe ve got. What can you do? I-It \u2014 the \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and as for the \u2014 the non-\nviable mini-states that spring up as nationalist units, the example of Slovakia\nhaving split off from Czech Republic, because they felt that they were treated like\nunderdogs, with justification. But, by themselves much less viable, and I\u2019m sure\nthat a great many of them are sorry that they split off. There 1s no visible easy way\nback to that confederation, that comes after the national thing, as I have been told,\nyou know. No easy way back. So we are \u2014 we are perpetually shooting ourselves\nin the foot all over, I mean, not you and I, but people everywhere, in their own\nsituations.\n[break]",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Peter Masters. This is tape four, side A. And\nyou had told me about your professional career, and you told me about the social\nchanges that you saw in this country in the 60s and into the 70s. But you haven\u2019t\nspoken to me about your personal life and your family. Can you tell me about your\nfamily?\nSeptember 25, 1998",
        "A: Well, I came, if you recall, from \u2014 from England on a Fulbright and sterling \u2014\npounds sterling were not convertible, so I had no money. And the art schools were\nnot boarding schools, so I lived at International House in New York at 500\nRiverside Drive. And that was very stimulating because there were students from\nall over, and many friends, which I maintain to this day. Some of them I haven\u2019t \u2014\nI hadn\u2019t seen in, I guess almost 50 years, but my friendships are of the nature that I\ncan pick them up any time as if there had been no time gap. We had recently been\nto Hawaii, where I had friends from International Student House whom I hadn\u2019t\nseen since. And it worked like we had never parted. I \u2014 one day, a Greek student in\nNew York who lived at the house, said let\u2019s hitchhike to Washington. I\u2019m going\nto hitchhike to Washington, anybody want to come along? I said sure. I \u2014 I\u2019ve\nnever been there, and I know somebody in Washington. Let me try and telephone\nand see whether I can arrange something. So I did what in those days was an\nunusual activity, a long distance telephone call. And I went and called\nWashington, and | had no address of the person I was looking for, who had been\nthe fianc\u00e9e of a friend of mine who was a commando colleague in \u2014 in England\nand in Normandy, we b-both went in on the same team to Normandy, and we\nwere very, very close friends. And we double dated in England. I was engaged to\nan Irish girl from northern Ireland. Have we covered that before? Well, the \u2014 his\nfianc\u00e9e was \u2014 had come out on the ch \u2014 ki \u2014 children\u2019s transport from\nSeptember 25, 1998\nCzechoslovakia and had work in London for the Czech government in exile until\nthe coup in Czechoslovakia when she lost her job. She had been alone to the\nsecond international conference, annual conference of the International Monetary\nFund, and they had offered her a job in Washington. And when she lost her job in\nLondon, she accepted the job in Washington, because why not, for a year, and\nhad \u2014 in other words, come for a year at the International Monetary Fund in\nWashington. I couldn\u2019t remember the name of the International Monetary Fund\nand I first asked th-the Washington telephone operator whether I \u2014 she had a\nlisting by name, and she didn\u2019t. So I said well, there\u2019s an organization that belongs\nto the United Nations. And she said, the United Nations are in Flushing\nMeadows, New York. And I said, I know that, but there 1s some branch, it\u2019s\ncalled the United Nations Fund, or the United Nations bank, or something. And\nshe said, sir, United Nations are in Flushing Meadows, Long Island, New York.\nAfter we\u2019d been over that a couple of times, I said, I tell you what, forget it, and I\nhung up. Obviously I wasn't going to get anywhere and I went to see the Greek\nstudent who had wanted to hitchhike to Washington, and I said, I\u2019m having\nproblems about this Washington thing, I can\u2019t reach my party. And he said, I\u2019ve\ndecided not to go. I said okay, it\u2019s off. So it didn\u2019t happen. Awhile later, Alice\nwent to London on home leave, London being her home, and met with our\nmutual friend and \u2014 and other friends from the commandos. And they said, oh,\nSeptember 25, 1998\nwhen you go back through New York, you must bring this book that is just out to\nPeter. The book was \u201cThe Green Beret,\u201d the first book about the commandos by\nHilary Saint George Saunders, a historian. And she had said, oh, Peter is in\nNew York? I didn\u2019t know that. And she brought me the book. Now, I \u2014 I have to\ngo back a moment and say that when she left for \u2014 for Washington from London,\nher fianc\u00e9 said to me, I have \u2014 he was in business already and I was in art school \u2014\nhe said, I have a shipment coming in in the docks, and I can\u2019t take off, I have to be\nthere. But you are an art student, you can take time off. Why don\u2019t you go with her\nto \u2014 whatever it was, Cooks, and help her make the arrangements? Anyone who\nknows Alice knows that she needed my help like the hole in the head. She \u2014 when\nshe worked for the International Monetary Fund, she made travel arrangements for\n60 people, and my helping her was a laugh. But I took time off and went down the\nroad to Cooks on Southampton Row, King\u2019s Way, which was five minutes from\nmy school, and gave her, as \u2014 as a matter of fact, a going away present of one of\nmy little Ashanti gold weights that I had acquired during my six months in Africa\nat the end of the war. And she brought me the book and I told her the story about\nhow I had almost come to Washington and she said, well, you must come and see\nWashington. And I said sure. And of course, having no money, I hitchhiked.\nHolland tunnel or whatever, and in those days, if you got a ride straight through it\ntook seven and a half hours, and you never got a ride straight through, so it took\nSeptember 25, 1998\n10 - 11 - 12 hours. And I would start at \u2014 after school, about four o\u2019clock, and \u2014\nand hitchhike. There was, of course, no New Jersey turnpike. There was no bridge\nover the Delaware. There was a ferry. There was no tunnel under Baltimore and\nno route 95, but route one with traffic lights and what have you. I usually hit\nBaltimore in the early hours of the morning, like two o\u2019clock a-and \u2014 and usually\non a truck which dropped me off somewhere in the harbor district. And on one\noccasion, two potential muggers followed me and in fact I \u2014 I had a suitcase and a\nportfolio to carry, so they could walk faster than I could, and they \u2014 I \u2014 I decided I\nw \u2014 I would \u2014 I would walk in the middle of the road so I wouldn\u2019t be pulled in\nanywhere, and I stopped and they came and said, at two in the morning, and asked\nme for a light. And I said, I don\u2019t smoke. Is there anything else you want? And I\nhad a metal suitcase which I held, which I was going to throw at them and run, if\nnecessary. And they decided that this was not a good proposition and they decided\nnot to \u2014 to mug me. And \u2014 but it was an unpleasant incident and looked very\nthreatening. And a \u2014 another story that comes to mind is it \u2014 one time it poured,\nand it was just before Alice\u2019s birthday and I was \u2014 I had bought her ano \u2014 a new\numbrella, and it was gift wrapped. And I carried that umbrella gift wrapped and\nwouldn\u2019t open it because I didn\u2019t want to spoil the thing, I carried it under my\njacket so it wouldn\u2019t get wet. Anyway, after hitchhiking to Washington a few\ntimes, w-we met in New York and in Washington. And in the following spring,\nSeptember 25, 1998\n1950, we were married. And Alice had arranged some interviews for me in\nWashington to find a job, and the person who was going to help me find the job\nran a small public relations agency, and he desired \u2014 he si \u2014 he decided that he\nwould hire me himself and call it public relations and advertising and I was the art\ndirector of this small outfit, and it was not an altogether positive experience. I\nthink I earned 30 dollars a week and that was low even by the standards of that\ntime. But I had quite some exposure. I did three full color ads for \u201cEsquire\u201d\nmagazine and I found that I had to solicit some of the jobs because nobody else\nseemed to be doing it and after awhile everybody quit and I was the only\nemployee. But one of them had preceded me into television and he offered me a \u2014\na job in television. We\u2019ve \u2014 may have covered that before. Anyway, in the\nmeantime, A-Alice and I had moved into a one room apartment on \u2014 on Belmont\nStreet in Washington, which was rather \u2014 rather primitive, but not \u2014 not at all bad,\nand after a period we moved downtown into an air conditioned apartment. That\nwas the height of luxury. Small one, also. And we had our first child, a daughter,\nAnne, who from a very early age wanted to do professionally exactly what I was\ndoing and \u2014 and helped me, even as a child. And got very proficient and became a\ngood graphic designer and is one to this day. Then we had a second daughter,\nKim, who also \u2014 all of them leaned in directions that I had marginally been\ninvolved in. She started to write poetry, which we have done traditionally in my\nSeptember 25, 1998\nfamily for every birthday. And of course, she went beyond that and she became a\nwriter and is at this stage a contributing editor to \u201cVanity Fair\u201d and \u201cTime\u201d\nmagazine, and is writing her second book, called tentatively, \u201cKeys to the\nKingdom,\u201d meaning Michael Eisner and the Disney operation. That\u2019s big league\nwriting, not the sort of thing that \u2014 that I\u2019m doing. Well, as \u2014 this morning, as a\nmatter of fact, in looking for a certain book, I came across the album of \u2014 of\nbirthday cards over the years, and it\u2019s quite a collection because they are both\ngraphics and \u2014 and \u2014 and at least doggerel verse, and it\u2019s a heartwarming memento\nthat I \u2014 I \u2014 I think 1-I \u2014 astonished me because I had forgotten some of them,\nthey\u2019ve been so long ago. But the tradition goes on. The tradition also goes on to\nmy third child which \u2014 Tim, a \u2014 a\u2014a son who works for the Discovery Channel as\nsenior manager of special events, and lives only five minutes from my house. And\nhe writes absolutely beautiful birthday poets \u2014 poems. Everybody knows what\nbirthday poems sound like and I sometimes wince at the bad meter and \u2014 and the\nsuggested ego trip of all of us who do this. But my daughter Kim and my son\nTim, write absolutely gorgeous ones, far better than anything I\u2019ve ever done. And\nincidentally, my children being named Anne, Kim and Tim, the last one was\nKim\u2019s idea, together with the support of her older sister. And we said, if we call\nhim Tim and we calling you \u2014 him \u2014 or we call you, you will never know which\none we are calling because it sounds alike. And she said, that\u2019s the idea. A-As you\nSeptember 25, 1998\ncan see where she comes from. Well, they\u2019re all married. Anne is married to an\narchitect and lives in Washington and has three children; David, who 1s now 11,\nSam, who is nine and Hannah who is almost six. And Kim had great trouble \u2014\nshe is married to Gary Simpson, who is in television, movies in Hollywood. She\n\u2014 Kim moved to Hollywood because she covers Hollywood. She used to work for\nthe \u201cWashington Post\u201d for many years for style, but now she doesn\u2019t work for a\npapers, she writes the book and contributes articles to those two publications. She\nhad great difficulty having a baby. She had 10 in-vitros attempting to have a baby,\nall failed. And ultimately succeeded by having a \u2014 a surrogate carry her child. The\nbaby is hers and her husband\u2019s, implanted into a surrogate, who carried it and it\u2019s\nnow a few months old, a little girl. And the \u2014 one thing that comes to mind is when\nshe and the surrogate were together in the hospital for the birth of the baby, the\nbaby cried during the night, and Kim said, the baby is crying. And the surrogate\nmother said, it\u2019s not my baby, you go and take care of it. And she has been doing\nthat happily ever since. Took some adjustment, because when you don\u2019t carry the\nbaby, the impact on your life, whe \u2014 which suddenly changes without the relief of\nnot carrying it any more is \u2014 1s quite an experience, that I hadn\u2019t really anticipated.\nBut she adjusted to it very well, and now all is going very well. And as we sit here\nand speak, Tim and his wife Laurie, who also works for Discovery cable\ntelevision, she is vice-president in charge of marketing, expect their first baby. The\nSeptember 25, 1998\nphone could ring now. I know we\u2019 ve turned them off, but even so, and she might\nbe having that baby. We don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a boy or a girl, any \u2014 any day\nnow. The \u2014 all three children, by the way, went to school in \u2014 in this area, in the\nWashington area, and all three of them didn't like high school, and wanted to get\nout as soon as possible. So, 1t was possible in the district to take, I don\u2019t know,\nEnglish four and I forget what else, math, over the summer and graduate early. All\nthree of them did that. You didn\u2019t have to be brilliant to graduate early, just had to\ntake a couple of summer courses. And they wanted to avoid the graduation\nceremony, none of them wanted to go through it, peculiarly perhaps, and all of\nthem wanted out. And all of them \u2014 each one of them did something different with\nthe year they gained by graduating a year early. Anne worked for a design studio\nbefore she went to art school. She had helped me all along. And after a period of\ngood experience, went to Pratt in \u2014 in New York, and was in many ways ahead,\nbecause she had the practical experience. And this was in a period when\npracticality was not big in the art schools. You know, they would say, design a\nlogo for \u2014 design a logo for a \u2014 an \u2014 and use \u2014 draw it on a brick. If that sounds\nabsurd, that was \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m doing this on purpose, or a cinder block, because that\nwas characteristic of the time. Practicality was not the main thing. You did things\nthat were impractical, but original, okay? It was the post-modern I talked to you\nabout before. Well, so that was how she spent her year that she gained. Kim did\nSeptember 25, 1998\nsomething entirely different. She went to visit my wife\u2019s sister in London. And in\nLondon the county council runs all kinds of courses, which are affordable and\nvery, very good. So she learned \u2014 she took courses in all the things she might want\nto be interested in later, having no idea where she was going to go. She took one in\npsychology, one in ceramics, one in Italian, one in drama, and I forget what else.\nAnd after she was through, she decided none of the above, and she became an\nEnglish major, and now it became very important at what school she was to\ncontinue. And one of my colleagues on \u2014 a very senior older person in the poetry\nprogram, had been a president of Bryn Mawr, and she \u2014 and when I talked about\nthe program said, oh Kim absolutely must go to Bryn Mawr and she took her\nthere. And there was a sort of a \u2014 it really fitted Kim like \u2014 like a glove. There is a\ntraditional Poet Laureate in Bryn Mawr who is anonymous un \u2014 and writes under\nthe name of Applebee, which was the name of the gym teacher who introduced\nhockey to schools in the United States. And Applebee is selected by the outgoing\nApplebee after submissions of sample poems. And nobody knows who it is, and\nthey write snide poems about \u2014 well, critical of \u2014 of \u2014 of the school management\nor whatever, or social gossip bu \u2014 and with \u2014 with double entendres galore. And\nKim became Applebee in her junior year, I think. And the \u2014 the \u2014 I \u2014 I even recall\nthe interview because Kim had read more books than anybody I know, and sh \u2014\nbefore she went to college. And when you go for an interview they want to see\n100September 25, 1998\nyour reading list. And she went to Cornell and they looked at her reading list,\nwhich was a \u2014 a foldout, a-a \u2014 it was so long, and said, about what we would\nexpect and that offended Kim deeply because she knew it wasn\u2019t true. It was a\nputdown, you see. And at Bryn Mawr, when she showed her reading list, the\ninterviewer put it aside after glancing at it and said yes, but what is your favorite \u2014\nwho is your favorite author? And Kim said, without hesitation, Jane Austen. And\nthe interviewer said, she is mine too, let\u2019s talk about Jane Austen. They talked for\nthree hours about Jane Austen. So there\u2019s no question she was going to go\nanywhere else. Tim used his extra year to take an internship in television, because\nhe had been interested 1n \u2014 in radio and television from being a \u2014 a toddler. In fact,\nin his house hangs a picture of him with his first phonograph when he was about\nfour years old, and he is carefully putting down the needle, and subsequently\nworked as a disc jockey for the university of dis \u2014 dis \u2014 District of Columbia\nstation. He had a program called Jazzmasters with Tim Masters. And when C-\nSpan bought the station and there was no more jazz, the hearts of all the listeners\nbled, because they were so attached to that classical jazz program. And he misses\nit. He did it for, I think 12 years, as a sideline, unpaid. But he has been in \u2014 in\nsome form of \u2014 of broadcasting all \u2014 all his life. Well, where were we? Yes, my\nwife Alice, who came for a year, stayed for 36 years. She became an\nadministrative officer, and her \u2014 by now there are few people left who remember\n101September 25, 1998\nher, but there are some, and when we go there for some function, or if we meet\nsomebody by chance, she would \u2014 was literally a legend in that organization,\nbecause having been a \u2014 a \u2014 from a children\u2019s transport, you know, and having\nbeen self reliant from an early teenage age, she was so protective of the people\nworking on the staff, that she would tell newly arrivals that the first thing they\u2019d\nhave to do 1s to start thinking of their careers in terms of security and retirement\nand so on. And very few people \u2014 very few young people think about that at all.\nAnd now there are many \u2014 there are many out there who are thanking her for her\nbeing so solicitous. And she is a most remarkable person. She is a \u2014 a \u2014 the \u2014 the\nfastest at many things that I can \u2014 that I\u2019ve ever seen. I mean, if I\u20141if we go\nshopping and I get out of the car and I can\u2019t see where she 1s, it is because she is\nalready in the house, having carried 50 percent of the bags and dinner is almost\nready. You know, that sort of thing. And she never hesitated to have a social life,\nto \u2014 to invite people, while she was working. And how \u2014 how 1s \u2014 1s \u2014 by today\u2019s\nstandards, unimaginable. And \u2014 and I \u2014 I don\u2019t think \u2014 I mean, some of my\nchildren have to have \u2014 have dinner party, what have you. But to think of the kind\nof dinner party she would have fo-for friends after she came home from work, and\nit was ready and delicious at the time when you didn\u2019t think she had hung up her\ncoat yet. It\u2019s just a very special talent. When we were recently visiting friends on\nCape Cod, we had an engagement to which we had to go, I\u2019ll come back to that\n102September 25, 1998\nlater, and we were going to have dinner afterwards, at our guests\u2019. And we had\nbeen talking about a continent-ental dessert that is \u2014 is a big favorite in central and\neastern Europe. And in central and eastern Europe it\u2019s a dessert \u2014 it\u2019s a dumpling,\neither with plums or apricots. But she has figured out that it\u2019s better with peaches,\nbecause there\u2019s more fruit and the peaches are so good 1n this country, and in \u2014\nparticularly this year, by the way. So, she said, I\u2019m going to make that for dessert.\nAnd they said, well do it afterwards, because we really have to go. And she said, it\nwon\u2019t take a minute. She had du-dumplings for five people ready while the others\nwere putting on their jackets to go to the function. And so when we came back, all\nshe had to do is put them in the water, and they were done, you know, I mean none\n\u2014 none of them could believe that she had actually accomplished that in this\nextremely narrow time span. Doesn\u2019t bother her [indecipherable]. And she has\nbecome a most valued counselor for my activities, which of course means\nparticularly the book I have written. And the reason I wrote that book is because I\nfelt that as the interest in the Holocaust and in World War II revived, people were\nwriting books and telling stories that were horrible, and in recounting their \u2014 their\nstories, and I felt that someone ought to stress the fact that not everybody went like\nsheep to the slaughter, but some of us had the fortunate opportunity to be able to\nfight back. So I \u2014 and 1n addition, I wanted to commemorate all those who were\nless lucky that I was, because a lot of my refugee friends who succeeded in ha \u2014 in\n103September 25, 1998\n\u2014 in doing special and hazardous duty, were killed or maimed or at least wounded.\nI was one of the lucky ones that came through without a scratch except a tiny\ngrenade splinter in my rear end that I threw myself in house clearing, by being a\nlittle cowboy-like \u2014 cavalier about how I tossed the grenade. Which was partly\nencouraged by the management to be a little macho. Came with the job. So, I\nwrote my first book as a septuagenarian. It took me years and years to do it,\nbecause I had no idea how one writes a book. But I\u2019d always had the inclination to\ntell stories, as you can tell from this interview. So I \u2014I first wrote \u2014 I tried to do it\nby tape recording while walking the dog when I\u2019d had a heart attack. And I \u2014 my\nchildren ga-gave \u2014 borrowed somebody\u2019s dog or something, a very ugly\nDalmatian. And I had to walk this dog twice a day, and they gave me a tape\nrecorder and they said, that way you can get your \u2014 the book you always talk\nabout, written. And I recorded while walking the dog. You can hear cars going by\nand stuff. And then I tried to get it transcribed, because I can\u2019t type. And I found\nseveral people who said they would do it, and they had two common\ndenominators. One, they were very expensive, and two, they were absolutely\nincompetent at understanding what I was saying, perhaps because of my accent,\nperhaps because there are many proper nouns in there that they were unfamil \u2014\nthat were unfamiliar to them. And I struggled. I tried to transcribe it myself, I\nfound I couldn\u2019t do it. So some friend said, you got to get yourself a word\n104September 25, 1998\nprocessor and I did. It\u2019s a very primitive machine, a word processor and the\nprinter. And I struggled to learn it and found that every now and again it would\nabsolutely balk and not do what I told it to do. So I needed to call friends to help\nme to get it going again, to jumpstart it. And I found that this happened so often,\nthat one friend wouldn\u2019t do it, I couldn\u2019t bother the same person, so I alternated\nabout three friends and called them with my emergencies, in the middle of the\nnight at times, because I couldn\u2019t stop, I had to go on. And that \u2014 that \u2014 with their\npatience and my persistence, that seemed to work. And then I talked to some\npublishers without submitting it, but I \u2014 I submitted, I think a synopsis to one in\nEngland, with whom I met and he said, you know, it doesn\u2019t all have to be true.\nAnd that finished it as far as I was concerned, because that was precisely my\npurpose, that it should all be true. H-He said, you know, faction is acceptable. And\nI \u2014 as long as you have a thrill on every page. I thought there were enough thrills\nwithout having to invent them. So we parted before we even started. And then I \u2014 I\nwent to various people for advice and some of the advice was good and some of it\nwas \u2014 was not. Some people said, you must have more dialog, some people said\nyou must have less dialog. Some people said you must be sequential. And I think\nthat\u2019s true. People want to know how it continues.",
        "Q: Speaking of continuing, I have to pause to change the tape. Just one moment.\n[break] This is an continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\n105September 25, 1998\nvolunteer collection interview with Peter Masters. This is tape four, side B, and\nyou were telling me about your book, and the genesis of your book. Let me first\nask you, can you give me the title of your book?",
        "A: The book is called, \u201cStriking Back.\u201d I \u2014 I literally polled some of my\ncommando friends and other people for a title and they made all kinds of\nsuggestions. I can\u2019t pin down where the title ultimately came from, except perhaps\ni-in discussion between the publisher and myself, and utilizing, and re \u2014 rattling\noff all the names that have been suggested. And the publisher wrote the subtitle\nmodified from something that I suggested, namely, it\u2019s called \u201cStriking Back: A\nJewish Commandos War Against the Nazis.\u201d I wanted to say Jewish refugee\ncommandos, but they said, the word refugee has a different connotation nowadays\nand people wouldn\u2019t know what it means in this context. And besides, it\u2019s too\nlong. So there it is, a Jewish refugees war against the Nazis. And a \u2014 well, how did\nI find a publisher and be \u2014 believe me, people have asked me since, how do you\nget a book published, like I\u2019m the expert. And of course I \u2014 first time author, and I\n\u2014 what do I know\u201d? So, the \u2014 the way \u2014 the way this came about was that the\nhistorian Stephen Ambrose, who was the head of the \u2014 president of the\nEisenhower Institute in New Orleans, and professor at the University of\nLouisiana in New Orleans, and the D-Day Museum in New Orleans, called\ntogether D-Day veterans from \u2014 mostly from the U.S. forces, but some from \u2014\n106September 25, 1998\nfrom England and one from Germany. And \u2014 people who had experienced D-\nDay. And a friend in New York, Harry Nomberg(ph) called me, he was a\ncommando friend, he served under the name of Harry Drew, and he said, my wife\nand I are going, why don\u2019t you come with Alice? And we decided we\u2019d all go.\nAnd we had work sessions and it was absolutely fascinating because you could\ntalk to people who had been involved in some other activity on D-Day that I had\nseen but never fully understood. And now you could ask questions, how did you\ndo this? How did these rocket firing craft work that were on our left, and so on.\nAnd we all submitted a tape beforehand and Ambrose told me that he liked mine\nam \u2014 and considered it to be among his best. And we \u2014 and then he wrote the\nbook, D-Day, which became a best seller and my story is in there in multiple\ninstallments about my D-Day experience. So I mentioned to him that I we \u2014 was \u2014\nI wanted to write a book, for the reasons I\u2019ve already stated. And he said, you\nmust absolutely. And I said, don\u2019t I need an agent? And he said, yes you do, why\ndon\u2019t you use mine? And he recommended me to his agent in New York, and that\ndidn\u2019t work out at all, because the man told me on th \u2014 I never met him, but the\nman told me on the phone that he was suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\nand it would be quite some time before he got around to reading my book, because\nhe \u2014 he couldn\u2019t in his present condition. That was very discouraging. Secondly \u2014 I\nmean, I had notions that I\u2019d get it out for the 50\" anniversary of D-Day, and it \u2014 I\n107September 25, 1998\nwas clearly not going to make it. Then he said, it will require extensive editing,\nand he recommended an editor to me, who said he charged 250 dollars an hour.\nAnd I said, I can\u2019t afford for you to read my book, leave alone to edit it. And we\nmade a \u2014 an agreement that I would pay him an amount for giving me advice, after\nreading some of the book. And he gave me some advice, some of it good, some of\nit I discarded, which was to be anticipated. Then a man published a book about my\noverall unit, that is a\u2014 my \u2014 my commando unit, in which I was fortunate enough\nto \u2014 to be able to strike back. It was number three troop, 10 commando. The 10\ncommando had two French troops, a Dutch troop, a Norwegian troop, a Polish\ntroop. I think we\u2019ve been through that. And he wrote about all of us, you know, so\nwe were one chapter in that book. And this man had done considerable research\nand was familiar with all the dramatis personae. So I told \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 he offered to\nhelp me edit, and \u2014 and to advise me. And in return, he was writing additional\nbooks on the SOE, special operations of the U.S. \u2014 of the allied forces, and he\nneeded research done at the National Archives, because it didn\u2019t exist in England.\nSo I did the research for him for days on end, and found very interesting things\nthat he could use in his book and in return he \u2014 we exchanged tapes and he advised\nme. When I told Stephen Ambrose that he and \u2014 that I \u2014 I didn\u2019t get along with\nhis agent, he said, oh, I haven\u2019t used him in years. But naturally it didn\u2019t occur to\nhim to, you know, to \u2014 to call me and say I didn't use \u2014 I don\u2019t use that agent any\n108September 25, 1998\nmore. And he said, well, there are several options, and one of the ideas that came\nup was that I should talk to the people at the Holocaust Museum. And I talked to\nMr. Aronowitz at the Holocaust Museum, who had been in publishing in a\nprevious life, and he said, tell you what Pll do. I-I will print out publishers who I\nthink would be interested in your book. Now, they won\u2019t all be big publishers,\nsome of them specialize in military memoirs and that\u2019s probably a prime\nconsideration. And he printed out the list and the top publisher on the list was\nPresidio Press in California, and I sent them \u2014 a-and Mr. Aronowitz advised me\nthat the way to do it was to telephone and ask for the acquisition editor. Now, the\naverage first time author doesn\u2019t know that, and sends it blind. Well, I sent it to the\nacquisition editor and got a letter back saying we are interested in your book. First\npublisher I submitted it to. And they accepted the book, they said they print 20\nvolumes a year, and they get 1600 submissions. And before the book was printed,\nit was ti\u2014 the movie options were bought by Miramax. And recently the German\ntranslation options were bought by a German publisher, whom I\u2019m trying to\ncontact to offer my services in case they need any help, because I want to make\nsure that it\u2019s done right. Now, the book has totally changed my life. As a first time\nseptuagenarian author, I am being asked to speak here, there and everywhere and\nto give book talks. The story I told you about the fruit dumplings, the commitment\nto which we were not to be late was at the Eldredge Library in Chatham on Cape\n109September 25, 1998\nCod. And this is a retiree audience, by no means Jewish, and they were a\nmarvelous audience. And I spoke for about an hour, and then I \u2014 we had a book\nsigning at the bookstore about three houses away. And I said, I think I \u2014 I have to\nfinish now, so that we make it in time to the bookstore. And the people started to\nyell, don\u2019t stop, keep going, we want to hear more. Which is fascinating, I mean\nit\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 they were really interested and into it and asked intelligent questions\nand I have since discovered that in these little New England towns, the library is\nreally the focal point of the community. That\u2019s where people gather. I mean, it\u2019s a\nsort of intellectual exercise. And that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s always a good sign and very\ngratifying. But apart from that, and I spoke to an Orthodox synagogue in London\nwhere there were 450 people and no microphone because I was billed as the \u2014 the\nShabbat preacher, 1f you will. And so nobody could turn on a microphone and I\ncouldn\u2019t hold a piece of paper, because that\u2019s working. I mean, carrying the piece\nof paper. And so I thought how, as a sergeant major you would have to shout that\nyou could be heard at the other end of the parade ground and I thought I sa \u2014I\u2014 I\ndid that when I was a sergeant, I\u2019Il do it again. Be \u2014 the rabbi was doing it. And it\nworked very well, and I was given all kinds of honors, opening the ark and closing\nthe ark, I was worried whether it was \u2014 you \u2014 you asked earlier about my religious\norientation, which was \u2014 activity, which was somewhat marginal. I was Bar\nMitzvahed, and my grandfather was a very religious man, but he never explained\nSeptember 25, 1998\na\u2014a-\u2014a word about \u2014 not even at Seder, he just rattled off his prayers and \u2014 and\nwas a\u2014 nota teacher. Well, so I was worried whether I was going to do all these\nthings right in the Orthodox synagogue, I\u2019d never officiated in \u2014 in any synagogue\nleave alone an Orthodox one. And they said there will be somebody behind you\nwho will tell you to do all the right things, and it turned out it was very, very\nsimple, it worked very well, and I shook hands for umpteen officials in a given\norder [indecipherable] traditional. I also spoke at a Reform synagogue to largely\nveterans. And there is an a-americ \u2014 an organization called AJEX, the Association\nof Jewish ex-Servicemen and Women. And they organized that in Edgware, a\nsuburb of London. And I spoke there, and when I finished \u2014 again, marvelous\naudience, the \u2014 there wer-were questions and one man stood up in the audience\nand said, you say your mission is to spread the word that you didn\u2019t go like lambs\nto slaughter, you are accomplishing that, I trust. But you are accomplishing\nanother mission that you don\u2019t even know of. And he held up a British army pay\nbook, which every soldiers carries. And he said, this is my uncle\u2019s pay book. \u2019ma\nmember of the Sachs(ph) family of \u2014 of refugees from Germany. And my uncle\nserved under the name of Seymour in your commando troop. And until we read\nyour book just now, the family did not know what happened to him beyond the\nwar office telegram saying that he was killed in action. In your book you say that\ni-in the night assault crossing of the river Rhine, you were in a amphibious track\n111September 25, 1998\ncra \u2014 vehicle called the Buffalo, and that the Buffalo next to yours in mid-river\nwas hit and burst into flames, and that nobody got out alive, as far as you know.\nAnd two of the people on it, you say, were Fogel(ph) and Sachs(ph) who served\nunder the name of [indecipherable] and Seymour. And this 1s the first time we\nfound out what happened to my uncle. And that brings closure to our feelings and\nwe thank you for it. And people in the audience started to cry, and it was very\nemotional, and I felt that 1t somehow made it all worthwhile to have done this, and\nstruggled to write the book and to do this. And that\u2019s by no means all. I had the\nphone call from a woman who said that her name was Claudine Schindler.\nActually Claudine Arbour Schin-Schindler. And she had seen the article about\nme that was caused by my book in the B\u2019nai B\u2019rith international magazine, th-the\nmonthly. And it said that my name had been Arany, and her name had been\nArany, and were we related? And she started to lay out her family. And she is the\ngranddaughter of my father\u2019s oldest brother, who was a \u2014 quite a character, in fact\nthe name Arany was invented by him. The family name had been Freed(ph) but\non \u2014 being in Hungary he wanted to have a Hungarian name, and what\u2019s more, he\nwas a sort of macho character who in the 20s wore a black leather jacket and rode\na red Indian motorcycle. And my father imitated him in almost everything, his\nolder brother. They were both jewelers. Arany in Hungarian means gold, so it was\nsort of a pun to have that name. And in addition, it\u2019s the name of the national poet\n112September 25, 1998\nof Hungary, Arianosh(ph), and aristocratic, he wanted tha \u2014 obviously. And he \u2014\nhe was divorced from a very nice woman whom I knew much better than I knew\nmy Uncle Carol(ph), Ilsa(ph) who ran a \u2014 a pensionne 1n the country that\nbelonged to some very wealthy relatives of hers. But she was sort of the poor\nrelative. Lovely woman, who invited us as children a couple of times to this\npensionne in the country and I have very nice memories of that. We had to be on\nour best behavior because of all the elegant people there. And she had two sons,\nAussie(ph) and Jurry(ph) Arany, and apparently they got out. We were not in\ntouch. And they got out and lived in France throughout the war, running from\nplace to place in hiding, as people did who survived in France. And then one of\nthem got \u2014 oh, in France they changed the name Arany to Arbor, spelled like the\nEnglish word arbor, but pronounced arbore(ph). And one of them got to Brazil,\nand then got the rest of the family, postwar to Brazil, and some went on to the\nUnited States. And this woman was terribly excited about having found a relative\nbecause she didn\u2019t know that she had any relatives at all. And her father is dead,\nand so is her uncle, the two sons of Carol(ph) and Ilsa(ph). And she said, I will\ntell my brothers and they\u2019Il probably call you. And the next day I had a telephone\ncall from Brazil, from what is after all a first cousin once removed. And they are\nall coming \u2014 he is coming to America in November, and he\u2019Il rent a car and bring\ndown as many of the family as he can. And as I said, all very, very excited. So I\n113September 25, 1998\nfound some close relatives I didn't know I had. I mean, I knew they existed, but\nthat\u2019s the next generation, you see? The generation after. And the \u2014 th-th-there are\nthree grown children of the woman in New Jersey, and the \u2014 the youngest just\ngraduated from college. And I did know at one point that I thought the two sons of\nmy uncle had gotten out, because in London, in her apartment building, my\nmother needed some wrapping paper once, and she borrowed it from a Mrs.\nBuerger(ph) who was living at the other end of the corridor. And Mrs.\nBuerger(ph) gave her a used piece of brown wrapping paper, that\u2019s all she had on hand.\nAnd on it was the name of one of these two boys, cousins. But my mother, being\ndivorced from my father, had no interest in taking up a relationship, and she just\nremembered the fact that she had seen the name, and so maybe they got out, she said, and\nI s\u2014I said, ask Mrs. Buerger whether she knows these people. And nothing ever\nhappened, it \u2014 1t ran off into the sand.",
        "Q: How has your book been received with respect to sales?",
        "A: I have had nothing but excellent reviews. Some of the major papers have not reviewed\nit. The \u2014 and \u2014 and you learn a whole new thing, you know, about what to \u2014 what did I\nknow about publishing? A woman called me from \u201cThe Wall Street Journal,\u201d saying I\nreview books for \u201cThe Wall Street Journal,\u201d but they devote very little space to it. I\nloved your book, but \u2014 and I wrote a review, but it may not appear. And, it didn\u2019t,\nbecause there are lots of books and limited space and that\u2019s how it is. And the publisher\u2019s\nweekly pub \u2014 which guides libraries, published it very favorably, and suddenly at the be \u2014\n114September 25, 1998\nbe \u2014 beginning of last months, the \u201cJerusalem Post\u201d reviewed it, with a very, very good\nreview. And the \u2014 it \u2014 it suddenly rekindles a \u2014 you know, like \u2014 like a fire that dies down\nand then catches a \u2014 a flame anew, this goes on and on. And I get phone calls and letters\nfrom people all over the world. I had a letter \u2014 a-and a \u2014 a tape \u2014 a CD from Australia\nfrom a man who said he is sending me a CD of the song, \u201cThe Bells of Aberdovey,\u201d\nwhich is where we trained in North Wales, and I knew of the song. I\u2019ve forgotten how it\ngoes, but I \u2014 I remember it from that time. And he said, I am the first tenor on this record,\nbecause I am Welsh. I live in Australia now, but I thought you might like to have it. So\nhe sent me a CD of \u201cThe Bells of Aberdovey.\u201d I mean, as I say, weird things happen all\n\u2014all the time. And various friends whom I \u2014 with whom I had lost contact have contacted\nme because they\u2019ve heard of \u2014 seen the book and \u2014 and sought me out, or they wrote \u2014 or\nthey wrote to the publisher to forward mail to me. One of my best friends is the son of an\nAustrian matinee idol who \u2014 Hubert Marischka. His name is Franz Marischka and he\nlives \u2014 he was in the Pioneer Corps with me, he lives in Munich now. He came to spend\nthe day with me in London from Munich especially. And he is the grandson of Victor\nL\u00e9on who wrote the libretto for the \u201cMerry Widow,\u201d and the godson of Franz Lehar.\nAnd quite a character in his own right, and we had a marvelous day comparing notes. I\nwould never have recognized him, he is a\u2014 a \u2014 a little portly, bald man, and he was a\ndashing, blonde, young movie actor when I knew him. So \u2014 but we had a lot of fun. And\nthat happens all the time.",
        "Q: What is the status of the movie that\u2019s being \u2014 that was optioned [indecipherable]\n115September 25, 1998",
        "A: The status of the movie may be known to the moviemakers, a-and \u2014 and I \u2014 not even\nto the publisher, because the publisher handed it to the William Morris Agency, who\nacts as his agent, and o-other than my having a contract with the publisher for a portion of\nsubsidiary rights, lest anyone thinks that \u2014 well, one of the English papers wrote the last\nparagraph in a review saying, and Peter Masters sold his book, \u201cStriking Back,\u201d to the\nmovies for a million dollars. Well, don\u2019t you believe it. First of all, there\u2019s no million\ndollars. Secondly, the William Morris Agency gets 10 percent off the top. The publisher\ngets 50 percent of the remainder. That\u2019s already si\u2014 more than 60 percent if you take\nthen off the top. Then my \u2014 my daughter Kim who covers Hollywood told me, you have\nto have a lawyer when there\u2019s a movie contract. And I said, why, naively. And she said,\ntry to go it alone and see what happens to you. So I have a lawyer in Hollywood. He gets\nfive percent, okay? Then they bought the movie option, that doesn\u2019t mean they are\nmaking the movie just yet, although they assigned a writer and a producer, which is\npromising. But I haven\u2019t seen a piece of paper, but when I ask I am told it\u2019s a done deal.\nSo a done deal is a favorite expression 1n the publishing business. Now, people expect me\nto tell them how to get books published [indecipherable] and I used to say, look, \u2019'm a\nnovice and I don\u2019t know and that didn\u2019t seem to make them very happy, they thought I\nwas hedging. So after awhile I decided I would try and give them more of an answer.\nAnd so I came up with the following formula. And they send me manuscripts, okay? So I\nsaid, it takes three ingredients. One, you have to have an unusual story, because no matter\nhow moving your story is, if it is one of many, the chances are it will not get published.\nSo, an unusual story is one. Number two, you have to be able to tell it reasonably well. I\n116September 25, 1998\nmean, you can be edited and helped, but reasonably well. And the most important\ningredient is the third one, and that is luck. Because I don\u2019t know, I mean, I feel I\u2019ve \u2014 as\nI say in my book, I\u2019ve been lucky all my life. Lucky to get out, lucky to be able to get\ninto England, lucky to be able to join the army, lucky to be able to get into an elite\nassault unit and be able to fight back. Lucky to survive that. Lucky to be able to get my\nbook written and accepted by the first publisher. Lucky to have the movie thing, lucky to\nhave all the other things that are happening in conjunction with it. So, that\u2019s what it ta \u2014 it\ntakes as far as I\u2019m concerned, and look, if the movie doesn\u2019t turn out as I would hope it\nwould, or isn\u2019t made bef \u2014 as long as I live \u2014 I don\u2019t know how these things work \u2014 my\nwife Alice points out, you\u2019ve done your thing, you\u2019ve written your book. Right now there\nis a debate raging about \u2014 raging is perhaps an overstatement. But one of the members of\nmy troop, who was in combat very briefly because he stepped on a mine and lost a foot in\nItaly, so he was out of it. He continues his law studies, became a judge in England,\nwhich isn\u2019t bad for a Jewish refugee boy from Europe, and he\u2019s now a retired judge. And\nhe picked up the ball as it were, when my book came out and he wants us to contribute\nmoney to a monument in North Wales. And the \u2014 to my utter shock, the words on it did\nnot include the word Jewish. So I started a sort of agitating, lobbying campaign to enlist\nsupport of ex-members of the troop or widows or families to insist that it does include the\nwords Jewish. He \u2014 the judge went so far as to say that my saying a Jewish commandos\nwar against the Nazis in the subtitle was a blur and a s \u2014 and the flaw in my book. And\nafter I got over the shock and \u2014 and told him off about making such an excessive\nstatement, I had quite the time writing him a letter saying, having been a judge I suppose\n117September 25, 1998\nyou feel you must be judgmental in some direction. I am slowly beginning to understand\nwhere this comes from, and it\u2019s very simple. First of all, this is not America, where we\nhave just finished talking about the fact that 50 years ago there was overt anti-Semitism.\nIt has become unfashionable as I say \u2014 as I put it. It\u2019s, in sophisticated circles equally\nunfashionable in England, but there is the fear of it among Jews in Britain, apparently.\nI\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 and here\u2019s the thing. When we were first changing our names and becoming\na different person, that was rather fun for most of us, because having been a hate object in\nGermany, Austria, Hungary, having been a poor refugee, as most of us were, having\nbeen in the labor unit, which was the bottom of the army, becoming an elite unit member\nand wearing the green beret and the parachute wings for which we had qualified, and then\nknowing we were risking considerable \u2014 our lives, o-our limbs, carried with it a certain\nsatisfaction and pride. And to be a different person, I mean, I \u2014 I became ultimately, well,\na commando, a commando sergeant, an officer in the Oxfordshire and\nBuckinghamshire Light Infantry, a good regiment. And I am Peter Masters and \u2014 and\ngone is the refugee Peter Arany, you see? Now, some of them relished that so much that\nthey didn\u2019t want to step out of it because they felt 1t would be stepping back. And so, to\nmy utter shock, one of my friends in Edinburgh where I spoke at the Church of\nScotland church hall, and a classmate of mine from grade school invited lots of people\nand arranged it so I had a very nice audience. Yet, a commando friend of mine in\nScotland didn\u2019t invite anybody. And I suddenly realized that the reason he didn\u2019t invite\nanybody is because it would have blown his cover, now. Because he has a Scottish name.\nHe has very little accent, much less than I do, and I suppose he can account for that by\n118September 25, 1998\nour cover story where he was aw \u2014 brought up or something. He is the president of \u2014 or\nwas, of the local rugby club. And if \u20141f he \u20141f he invited people to something called,\n\u201cStriking Back: A Jewish Commandos War Against the Nazis,\u201d and he was one of\nthe commandos, the thought would occur to them that he too is a Jewish commando from\nEurope, and he doesn\u2019t want to be. And the judge probably doesn\u2019t want to be anything\nexcept a retired judge. And that goes for quite a few. Now it doesn\u2019t go for everybody.\nThe widow of my friend Harry Nomberg(ph) says who \u2014 whose name is \u2014 is Beatrice\nNomberg(ph) and she is from Argentina. Catholic, and Harry\u2019s dead, died recently.\nAnd she says Harry wouldn\u2019t have wanted it any other way but that it says mostly\nJewish. And the judge says that was not a prerequisite for joining the troop. It was not in\nthe criteria that qualified you and I said, that\u2019s true. But where would they have found\nGerman speaking people who wanted to do special and hazardous duty, if it had not been\nfor refugees that were Jewish and German speaking. And he says, well, some of them\nwere \u2014 were not Jewish. They were half Jewish or they were baptized, or they were \u2014\nthey didn\u2019t even know that the \u2014 part of their family was Jewish. And I said, the Nazis\nknew.\n[break]",
        "Q: \u2014 uation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Peter Masters. This is tape five, side A. We have talked\nabout a number of different things over the hours that we\u2019ve been together, and I\nwould like to go back and finish up some \u2014\n119September 25, 1998",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 bits of unfinished business.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Let me go chronologically. In your professional life we got as far as, I think\nabout 1984. Can you pick up your professional life from that time?",
        "A: Sure. In \u2014 in 1984, I retired. It was the earliest time that I could retire, and that\nalways brings with it certain f \u2014 financial disadvantages, but I felt it was high time\nfor me to get a \u2014 get out of what had become a rather difficult thing. The time of\nenthusiasm that we had had in the \u2014 1n the poverty program was long gone. Even\nthe transformation into wanting to take on the \u2014 the musty look of government and\ntry and brush it up into something more contemporary and positive, that was\nbeginning to ebb away and the fights were more frequent than \u2014 than the \u2014 the \u2014\nthe challenges. And there were various \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 that\u2019s another thing in that period\nof government, and that is that you can have an administration, a government with\nwhich you agree politically, but the person in charge of your agency may not be at\nall conducive to doing any positive things in \u2014 in what I considered my field and\nmy charge. Or reversely, you might have an administration that is unacceptable\npolitically to you, and you have no choice until next election as it were, and then\nyou may lose. And the \u2014 a-and yet it might be possible to do some positive things\nbecause you have somebody who is interested and who cares. Now, in the overall,\n120September 25, 1998\nin order to improve, and there have been conscious efforts of bringing good design\nto government, not always, what shall I say, enlightened efforts. But there were\ntimes when Nancy Hanks was in charge of \u2014 of the endowment, and she had a\nway to get around politicians that was admirable. And in \u2014 so \u2014 so there \u2014 there\nwere times when it \u2014 when one had the feeling that something worthwhile could\nbe accomplished, and there were other times when it seemed utterly hopeless.\nUtterly hopeless. And we \u2014 I \u2014 I remember \u2014 I remember trying to get \u2014 to come\nup with a formula a-and saying, well \u2014 o-or \u2014 at least an analysis, a diagnosis of\nwhy things were so hopeless at times and it 1s because the government is made up\nalmost entirely of lawyers. All right? Now, I have nothing against lawyers per se,\nbut with the very specialized methodology of American education, unlike some\nEuropean educations, which in my opinion emphasize general knowledge and a\ngeneral sort of Renaissance view of not knowing only your subject, but also the\narts and literature and music and something of a-at least basic something. This\ndoes not necessarily hold in this country. And it\u2019s perfectly possible to be a\nbrilliant lawyer and have absolutely \u2014 if \u2014 if you were asked to name three\nAmerican sculptors, they couldn\u2019t do it. Which is astonishing, you know? There\nhave been some wonderful ones. But I mean, ap \u2014 quite apart from that, perhaps\nthe size of the country is counterproductive to this kind of thinking because if you\nask me to name an artist from every of the 50 states, I probably would have a very\n121September 25, 1998\nhard time, because well, because I \u2014 and \u2014 and you see, there are layers of\nknowledge. There are people who know a lot about a subject, there are people who\nknow a li\u2014a bit ab \u2014 some, and there are people who know a little and then there\nare people who know nothing. And it\u2019s perfectly possible to be prominent in one\nfield in this country and know nothing about the others. It\u2019s a bit shocking, but\nthen there are many shocking things like that, culturally. I\u2014 I\u2014 one of my favorite\nexamples since I was in Japan a few years ago 1s tell me somebody who knows\nanything \u2014 anything about Japanese culture, who learned it in school. Thi \u2014\nanything besides \u201cShogun\u201d and \u201cMadame Butterfly.\u201d Anything about the\nbackground of an ancient culture, you see? And we don\u2019t learn it in school, I guess\nit\u2019s assumed. I mean, unless you\u2019re a specialist, because perhaps it\u2019s assumed that\nthere is so much knowledge out there that you can\u2019t know it all. Computers can\nchange that a bit now, because you can, if you\u2019re at all interested, you can look it\nup in the internet and it\u2019s pro \u2014 no doubt in there. And I wonder to what extent that\nwill spread a degree o-o-of feeling, of general knowledge? Now, when \u2014 if we\ndon\u2019t have a president one day who really cares about the arts, beyond the\nKennedy Center Awards, do you think that \u2014 that the arts will flourish all by\nthemselves a-as congress encourages sponsored by corporations, rather than by the\nendowment and so on? This is a very tricky subject, you see? It da \u2014 it \u2014 some of it\nisn\u2019t going to happen. And if you look back, historically, whether we have had any\n122September 25, 1998\narts in \u2014 in top positions; there\u2019s Thomas Jefferson, who was in his own right, an\ninventive, creative mind that I think overlapped into the arts and certainly into\narchitecture. What he did at Monticello and at the university 1-is \u2014 is admirable.\nCan you think of any other ones? You see, you \u2014 I probably don\u2019t know enough\nabout some of the intervening ones, but \u2014 but certainly, I mean \u2014 okay,\nRockefeller was an art collector and he was vice-president. Whether he collected\n\u2014I don\u2019t know his motivations. Mondale\u2019s wife was into ceramics, all right?\nJackie was into \u2014 int \u2014 into interior decoration, all right? But \u2014 but going\nbackwards, do you think that Carter, Bush, Reagan? Well, into movies.\nEisenhower, Kennedy? Blank. You see, I mean, an interest - Humphrey was\nvery interested in photography. We did a big photo exhibits when I was in the\npoetry program that he prompted. And it was lovely. I took him through it and it\nwas marvelous how perceptive he was. But you see, we are not going to elect an\nartist or even an art collector president, it \u2014 as it stands. And then th \u2014 and I think\nthat it would take a strong hand to do something to \u2014 1-1-in fact, let me backtrack\nthat [indecipherable]. It is marvelous that we are doing as well as we are, because\nthe point \u2014 the center point of the arts has actually shifted to this country from \u2014\nfrom Europe, from Paris to New York and perhaps Los Angeles, I don\u2019t know.\nChicago. And \u2014 and we are doing amazingly well considering that \u2014 that what I\njust said holds true. And when I applied for my Fulbright you may recall, my\n123September 25, 1998\nprincipal, a Scots painter said they are in their Elizabethan age in the United\nStates, artistically, culturally. Meaning the first Elizabeth, right? So, we are doing\nremarkably well, we could be doing much better still, with more encouragement,\nwith less sort of redneck small town attitudes about the arts being on the border of\nsomething questionable, and sinful and not quite reputable. Which is what we are\nseeing every time the endowment happens to \u2014 to endorse, or not even endorse,\nbut \u2014 but gets marginally involved with a grant that is then used for something that\nis appalling and shocking. And of course, that\u2019s the chance you take, to some\nextent. You can\u2019t pre-examine and sense everything you award, and some of them\nare going to misfire. So, we get some demonstrative art that\u2019s a bit beyond the pale\nwhen people shoot themselves 1n \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in the toes in order to \u2014 yeah, there\nwas some man who \u2014 who considered that demonstrative art, he actually shot\nholes into himself on the stage, or the other one kicked herself in chocolate in the\nnude, and so on, and this is performance art, you see, but th \u2014 there 1s much in art\nthat is shocking if it is new. Some of it is bad. Well, if you want some good,\nthere\u2019s also going to be some bad, th-there has to be freedom. Now, perhaps one\ncan control that a little bit, but the attempts have been made to go by local\nstandards only. Well, there are some Noguchi sculptures in Seattle that the\ngovernment, General Services Administration under its arts in \u2014 in government\nbuildings program put in, and a local congressman protested that these were pet\n124September 25, 1998\nrocks, because Noguchi takes a stone and works it minimally, but very, very\nbeautifully. My judgment okay, but not only mine. And he thought that this was\nmeaningless, and a waste. And a Sugarman sculpture in a court in Baltimore was\nhated by the judge and the judge rules his court like a-an autocratic ruler. And he\nsaid it was dangerous because it offered hiding places for muggers who would\nwaylay the secretaries when they came from work in the evening. Well, I mean,\nthese are pretty farfetched criticisms. He just didn\u2019t like that sculpture, you know.\nAnd maybe it was not a nice sculpture, I mean, a-are you going to love all\nsculptures equally? I heard scathing criticism of the Roosevelt Memorial. And\nthen I \u2014 and I haven\u2019t seen it yet. And I looked at a brochure about it, and the\nartists who were involved, like Baskin and Segal and \u2014 and Benton, who is the\ncarver of the letters, are top notch people. So it can\u2019t be all bad. Oh, I didn\u2019t\ncontinue that I said \u2014 well, in \u201984, in \u201984 I retired and I took my early retirement\nand \u2014 and made a rousing farewell speech where I told them all what was wrong\nwith government and with the General Services min \u2014 Administration in particular\nand it made people blanch, but I really loved the opportunity to use the commando\nspirit and \u2014 in at least telling them how it was, which was pretty much off the rails\nby that time and I was glad to \u2014 to get out. And I freelanced and I started to work\non my book. I freelanced and my daughter Anne is in the same \u2014 she has design\nstudio, of course, it\u2019s high tech. She has two Macintosh and she does stuff on the\n125September 25, 1998\ncomputer. But there are things that I \u2014 I maintain, I\u2019m not sure she would agree,\nthat I can do that the computer can\u2019t. And so we work together and she does the\ntechnological stuff and she has very good ideas, but they work better when we\nbrainstorm together. And we do that by phone and in person, and \u2014 and the last\nconversation was this morning, on th \u2014 a project she is working on. And we come\nup with \u2014 with very nice solutions together.",
        "Q: I also wanted to follow up on something that you had mentioned before with\nrespect to an article printed in B\u2019nai B\u2019rith, in the B\u2019nai B\u2019rith magazine. You\nhad told me you wanted to elaborate on that.",
        "A: Paula Ammon(ph) wrote an article in the B\u2019nai B\u2019rith monthly magazine\ncalled what, \u201cJewish Monthly,\u201d I think? And it\u2019s an international magazine. And\nthey sent a photographer out whose \u2014 whose name I\u2019d have to look up, but he is\nbrilliant, because he actually took a picture of me that I like, and that\u2019s hard to do.\nHe took a lot of pictures and they used one, and it shows that even as a\nseptuagenarian first time author, you don\u2019t have to look like a decrepit old man.\nHe \u2014 and she wrote a very nice article. There were a couple of errors. One she\ndidn\u2019t do herself, because somebody else writes the table of content at the front of\nthe magazine. And in that table of content, they \u2014 this person wrote that I had\nserved in Normandy and Salerno. And I was nowhere near Salerno. But some of\nour people were. My friend Stefan(ph) Rosskum(ph) who served as Steve Ross\n126September 25, 1998\nwas in Salerno and I think the judge who is now retired, with whom I am debating\nthe inscription on the monument was in Salerno, and \u2014 and they were in Anzio\nand in Salerno, and then in the river crossings in the Italian campaign, the\nCarilliano(ph), the Isonzo and so on, before we landed on D-Day. But I was not\nin Salerno. Secondly, the second mistake is much worse, it says that when I went\nto art school in London after my military service, I wanted to get into the Central\nSchool of Art and Design, because I had heard that it will \u2014 because it was so\nanti-Semitic that it was hard to get in. That is totally untrue. She got that fir-first\nbecause I \u2014 I said that I had been told it was a very competitive school and it was\nhard to get in, not a word of anti-Semitism is true. I made up my mind that I would\nget into the school because it was competitive and it was going to be difficult to\nget accepted. I felt that I had perhaps an unfair advantage because I was still in\nuniform, and if you come to apply to a school after six years of war ina\ncommando uniform with parachute wings and your medal ribbons, the chances are\nthey\u2019re gonna let you in if your work isn\u2019t terribly bad, I guess my work was not\nthat terribly bad, although I remember sitting in a life class and the very prominent\npainter who taught that life class looked over my shoulder and said, how many\ntimes a week are you taking life class? And I said, three times a week. And he\nsaid, make that five. A sobering experience. So, and it says then, with \u2014 with\ntypical chutzpah I became president of the students union. Well, the person who\n127September 25, 1998\ntold me it was hard to get into the school in the first place was a young woman\nwho had just graduated, and she boasted that she had been president of the student\nunion, she was a refugee. And so I decided that I would get into the school and\nbecome president of the student union, and I did. So that was not with typical\nchutzpah, but I said, with the drive of an ex-commando, I dis \u2014 I became president\nof the student union.",
        "Q: P\u2019ve asked you about your personal life, and I\u2019ve asked you about your\nprofessional life, and I\u2019ve asked you about social events in this country in the\nyears that you\u2019ve lived here, but I haven\u2019t asked you about contemporary Jewish\nhistory. If you would take a moment and reflect on \u2014 on the birth of the state of\nIsrael. You\u2019ve talked about that before, but things since the birth of Israel, the\nEichmann trial, and Israel\u2019s wars. As a refugee now living in this country, how\nhave those events impacted you?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not sure I told you the story that after the war, there were\nannual memorial services at Westminster, and when people came out of the \u2014 I\u2019m\nnot sure if it\u2019s Westminster Cathedral or Westminster Abbey, because I think\nI\u2019ve been to one. I\u2019m told there were people recruiting. I da \u2014 I told you that story,\nthat they were recruiting for the \u2014 for the Arabs and \u2014 and for the Israelis because\nthey wanted train the sol \u2014 soldiers. Well, the Israeli \u2014 the Israeli military effort\nappeared to me to be a continuation of this thing that I was about, the \u2014 the striking\n128September 25, 1998\nback mentality. And if anything, they underscored what I was trying to\ndemonstrate, because when I was a high school kid in Vienna, the notion that\nJews would fight meaningful, strategic \u2014 no, meaningful military assault actions\nseemed very farfetched. The pictures the Nazi tried to create was that Jews were\npersons that sought desk jobs in \u2014 in \u2014 1n \u2014 or \u2014 and were over intellectualized and\nphysically incapable of any actions such as the one required in \u2014 such actions as\nthe Israelis demonstrated they were extremely capable of doing, and we too, in our\nway, demonstrated that we were able to do that sort of thing and do it well. It\nhadn't really occurred to the world, and I find that \u2014 that Jews could do an\nEntebbe raid, or fight off a vast armored superiority with mainly the spirit and \u2014\nand enthusiasm and ingenuity of a dedicated people. So all this was very important\nto me, and it had not really \u2014 well, 1-1t was novel, and it was bright and shiny. And\nI think it was wonderful that these things \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 that we were gathering\nrespect. At times I was appalled at the attempted turnaround of making that this\nwas comparable to the militarists on the enemy\u2019s side. In other words that mean-\nspirited critics would say that the Israeli actions were Nazism in the Middle East. I\nthink that that 1s a partisan point of view, that I-I find very hard to stomach. And\nagain, I have friends who are much more knowledgeable about the details of some\nof these Israeli actions, and who when criticized for the politics, which of course is\n\u20141s \u20141S a\u2014a\u2014a popular pastime anyway, point out the geography. And I\u2019ve been\n129September 25, 1998\nto Israel once, and I stood on the Golan Heights, and I \u2014 I said, if it were mine, I\nwouldn\u2019t give it up, because it means that they can do \u2014 aim shooting into the\nkibbutz on the other slope, and I obviously would have to prevent that from\nhappening. Much of this is outdated now because if the warfare is by rocket and\nmissile, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you do observed shooting or not. Nevertheless,\nthe narrow waist of Israel is so \u2014 is so narrow that you find that to give up\nterritory that would make it narrower still, is not the kind of thing you want to do\neasily and without some guarantees that are meaningful.",
        "Q: I have heard you talk about Jewish resistance during the Holocaust. You had\nspoken on several occasions and even in your book about Jewish resistance. And\nI'd like you to comment.",
        "A: About Jewish resistance I\u2019ve had some lively de-debates, mostly by letter with\nthe Holocaust Museum people, because I feel that we who, as refugees,\nvolunteered for special and hazardous duty and put our lives on the line, that this 1s\nunlike somebody joining the armed forces and serving at the Pentagon. It seems to\nm \u2014 especially if you judge it by its ultimate results. It\u2019s true that people were\nkilled in all kinds of units here and there, but many of us were killed. Twenty of\n86 were killed. And almost all were wounded and some of the wounds were by no\nmeans minor, a lost eye, a lost leg, things from which they subsequently, years\nlater, became invalids and died. I \u2014 I think the fact that a \u2014 a refugee who 1s, by\n130September 25, 1998\ndefinition a person who escaped, who \u2014 who either went into hiding and escaped\nor managed to escape when it was still possible to do so without pretense, usually\npenniless, did not sit back and say, we\u2019ve suffered enough and let somebody else\ndo it, but volunteered and volunteered and volunteered and overcame all the\ndifficulties that 1t took me and my friends to be allowed to volunteer for risky\nthings. I say we are resistance, and they say this \u2014 by resistance we define the\npeople in the forests of Vilna, or the people who, in the Warsaw uprising, and I\ncertainly agree that they were resistance, and I would define it by saying they were\nresistance of desperation, because if you are in their situation in the Warsaw\nghetto, if you are in their situation hiding in the forests and trying to \u2014 to do\ndamage to the enemy, y-y-you \u2014 you ar \u2014 this is a \u2014 a desperation move. If you\nquestioned and interviewed them as I am being interviewed now, they would say,\nthe ideal thing for us would have been to get out if we could, if only we could. To\nget equipped and trained, trained and equipped, and then to come back with the\nmaximum effectiveness of the well-trained, well-equipped person. I don\u2019t really\nwant to quibble about this indefinitely, because if they don\u2019t call us resistance,\nokay. I think we were resistance, that\u2019s all. I think we did what we could to resist\nand \u2014 and were willing to take risks and volunteer and volunteer and volunteer.\nAnd volunteer on top of volunteering for special assignments. So that gave us\nimmense satisfaction, insofar as we survived it, and I would say even insofar as we\n131September 25, 1998\ndidn\u2019t, it was a comforting thought to those who lay dying that they had done it in\nluc \u2014 that they were there because they wanted to be.",
        "Q: On a related subject, I wanted to ask you about something you said in the\ninterview that you did for the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation.\nYou mentioned what you called reaction beyond reflex, and you talked about\nknowing that sometimes a person needs to take action. I was wondering if you\ncould expand on that, since this is a follow-up to that interview.",
        "A: I\u2014[P\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not sure there is very much to expand, but it works like this,\nand it\u2019s a wartime thing. You have a feeling, at times, in \u2014 in situations that might\nbe desperate or \u2014 or dangerous, or whatever, that somebody has to take some\naction that is required to resolve the situation. And you have the fi \u2014 th \u2014 and the\nfollow-up feeling of that feeling is, in my experience, that you find \u2014 and if I\ndon\u2019t, perhaps nobody will take the necessary action. That therefore you \u2014 you \u2014\nyou realize \u2014 and this doesn\u2019t \u2014 isn\u2019t a lengthy process, you suddenly realize\nsomebody must do something and must do it now and nobody seems to be doing\nit, so I better. So you do it. And you do it swiftly and with determination and you\nhave decided to do it and so you do it. And this 1s true in a great many things and\nhas its application by an extension to \u2014 to non-wartime situations where the feeling\nis, Somebody must do something, and \u2014 and \u2014 and what \u2014 what \u2014 what can I do?\nAnd 1-1 \u2014 perhaps it\u2019s entirely up to me. Sometimes with some of my best\n132September 25, 1998\ncommando friends, I found that as I was thinking somebody must do something,\nthey were already doing it, because they had a similar mindset. But not everybody\ndoes, and I think that to \u2014 to take a long bridge to some of our political problems at\nthe moment, I heard somebody ask not long ago, where is the person who is taking\nthe kind of action that was taken by an Ed Murrow in the McCarthy situation, by\nspeaking out with authority and saying, this has to stop. Or a\u2014 a\u2014a-\u2014 Welsh in\nthe McCarthy hearings when he said, sir, have you no shame, to Senator\nMcCarthy. I feel that the speaking out, and s \u2014I mean, surely an authority def \u2014\nan authority figure should stand up and say, enough already. Surely. I understand\nwhat this is all about, I understand that \u2014 that \u2014 and I have my own partisan view\nof it, wh-which \u2014 which is irrelevant. I-It seems to me that it ought to be possible\nto rise about the partisan thing when the damage done to our daily lives, the \u2014 the\nmere fatigue of \u2014 of listening to the ongoing argument about the various options\nof, and what disasters each one of them will bring upon us, surely gets you to f\u2014a\npoint where you say, enough already. I \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t get over the way the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the media makes news.",
        "Q: I\u2019m gonna pause for just a minute. You\u2019re making reference to things that are\nhappening tod \u2014 you know, today, in the contemporary time.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But you have not mentioned what exactly it is that you\u2019re referring to.\n133September 25, 1998",
        "A: Okay. I\u2019m talking about the \u2014 the comparisons of the present \u2014 what \u2014 what the\nmedia called a White House in crisis, or the presidency in crisis and comparing it\nto the Nixon Watergate situation, which I think is an outrageous comparison. And\nto say that, as I heard yesterday on television, this was o-only about a minor\nburglary, the Watergate, and I say, it was about a minor burglary that affected the\ndemocratic process, the political party of the opposition and that there 1s\nabsolutely no comparison to a sex scandal.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, we have to pause to change tape. [break] \u2014 continuation of the\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with\nPeter Masters. This is tape five, side B. We were talking about comparing the\nWatergate crisis and the contemporary crisis that Clinton is having, and you had\nmentioned about the media making the news. I would also like to \u2014 to ask you to\ncomment on \u2014 on the differences that you see in the coverage of the White House\nru \u2014 when you were working with CBS news \u2014",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: \u2014 in the 60s, and you were in the White House with Kennedy, and today.",
        "A: Well, when Kennedy was in the White House, I heard from inside people who\nhad worked there, I think the f \u2014 the thing was that \u2014 the phrase, if I remember it\nrightly was a man telling me, well you know he has this thing about airline\nstewardesses. And I thought \u2014 I \u2014 I had no idea what you were talking about and\n134September 25, 1998\nthen they spelled it out to me about the swimming pool adventures of Kennedy.\nAnd you see, that \u2014 at that time, this sort of thing was going on, but traditionally\nnot talked about except in \u2014 in \u2014 in stage whispers, and entirely separate from all\nother considerations. Now, I-I can see how any moralist person would object to\nthe details of \u2014 of \u2014 of the sexual adventures of the present president. I \u2014 I \u2014 I think\nthat it is of course true, that if I described you \u2014 to you any sexual activity by\nanybody in detail, 1t would sound shocking, simply because we are not used to\nseeing this sort of thing in print, except \u2014 I mean, the beginning \u2014 le-let me\nbacktrack there. When D.H. Lawrence wrote \u2014 wrote \u201cLady Chatterley\u2019s\nLover\u201d where he first called \u2014 u-used the expressive language for a sexual\nactivity, that was banned and considered shocking. It was the first time it had\nreally happened by a major author. James Joyce describes oral sex in considerable\ndetail. The sug \u2014 but it\u2019s not customary in the average novel or \u2014 or history to go\ninto detailed descriptions, largely because the hint of Hollywood before overt sex\non the screen, the hint 1s more powerful than the spelling out. It has more \u2014 more \u2014\n1-1-1t\u2019s in \u2014 it\u2019s more tasteful, it\u2019s \u2014 it-it\u2019s more genteel. That caused some authors\nto go deliberately the other way and write it very bluntly. Miller, not Arthur, but\nth \u2014 \u201cTropic of Cancer,\u201d if you recall, made it very, very \u2014 spelled out sex\nreferences. Personally I\u2019m not shocked by anything, I think it\u2019s in pretty poor\ntaste. And the best criticism I have found, the one that strikes me the most\n135September 25, 1998\nmeaningful is the one that a president shoul \u2014 knowing that in today\u2019s scenario this\nwill come back at him and be publicized all over the place, takes what is a \u2014 a very\nreckless risk in \u2014 in doing it. And \u2014 and that is, to me, the main criticism. The fact\nthat he did it doesn\u2019t interest me at all. People do all kinds of things, some are\nmore kinky than others. But you see, there is another current in the present thing\nand that is, to many patriotic and religious Americans, the Oval Office is\nsomewhat comparable to the holiest of holy in the temple, and \u2014 before its\ndestruction. And so, if anything happened \u2014 like that happens in the Oval Office,\nwhich was presumably the ambition of this young woman, so that she would have\nher place in history, sh-she \u2014 th-the thing 1s that this 1s in and of itself appalling,\nbecause it was \u2014 it desecrated the holiest of holy in the temple of the White House.",
        "Q: You mentioned a few moments ago on the \u2014 the end of the last tape, about how\nthe media makes the news. And I\u2019d like you to comment on how that has changed\nfrom \u2014 from your earlier experience with \u2014 with CBS news and then freelancing\nfor the other stations.",
        "A: Well, what can I say? Ed Murrow, Eric Sevareid, where are you now? You\nsee, would \u2014 even \u2014 even taking the best of the best of the present, there isn\u2019t\nreally anybody who could hold a candle, to use a clich\u00e9, to any \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to those\ntwo men, who were serious, responsible reporters. Now, we get multiple\nspeculation. One of my pet aversions at the moment, by the way, 1s the talking\n136September 25, 1998\nheads, when \u2014 and \u2014 and the only credit you have to explain who they are, is a\nformer prosecutor. It\u2019s a favorite choice. There are lots of former prosecutors, of\nall \u2014 of all shades, you see? Now, I think \u2014 and I\u2019ve seriously considered to \u2014 to try\nand communicate that wish to the media, they ought to be compelled to say \u2014 to\ngive a\u2014 an extra s \u2014 a\u2014a-a subtitle under former prosecutor and saying, a former\nprosecutor, a political appointee appointed by Richard Nixon, for instance.\nBecause then you would understand \u2014 I mean, I understand where they come from\nby what they say anyway, but I think there are lots of people out there who say ah,\na former prosecutor. Must be a legally well-informed person, you see. And some\nof them were shallow political appointees, ultra-partisan appointees and the least\nyou could do is say, who put them there to be a former prosecutor, so that we \u2014\neverybody can understand th \u2014 and anticipate what they are going to say. Now, if\nwhat they are going to say 1s a partisan line, that they tell you. And then they\u2019ll say\n\u2014they\u2019|l anticipate what might be done to counteract that. And they will say, the f\n\u2014 the following options, and so wa \u2014 in any case they will exhaust and dismantle\nany option before it has even been dreamt of by anybody. And now there 1s\nnothing new you are going to hear, but you are going to hear again and again and\nagain that this was a minor burglary, and this is not a case of sex, but a case of\nprofound obstruction of justice. And to \u2014 to me, I would even suggest that all these\nlawyers get together and say that perjury in cases of denying sexual activity should\n137September 25, 1998\nbe discounted as ca \u2014 as perjury. Because, it\u2019s an automatic reflex. If you ask\nsomebody \u2014 it\u2019s like the question, when did you last beat your wife? It\u2019s a\nquestion, when did you last have an extramarital affair? Gee, I never had an\nextramarital affair, okay? This is a reflex by people, and their \u2014 is that peryurous if\n\u20141f you say, I \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014I mean, a per \u2014 it took a President Carter to say, I only\nlusted in my heart. Some of them go beyond lusting in their heart.",
        "Q: I have just one or two final questions for you. First of all, I want to ask you, is\nthere anything that we haven\u2019t talked about that you want to mention before we\nconclude?",
        "A: We had perhaps mentioned a couple of things. Offhand I can\u2019t think of any. I \u2014\nI think that \u2014 I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll remember afterwards what we \u2014 I should have spoken\nless of, and what I should have spoken more of, but there it is.",
        "Q: What have been your most significant accomplishments?",
        "A: Whose accomplishments?",
        "Q: Yours. Your most significant.",
        "A: Ha. Well, I don\u2019t know that I would call them accomplishments, I \u2014 I\u2019ve always\npointed to my apparently continuing streak of luck in \u2014 in many of the things I\u2019ve\nundertaken. Accomplish, it\u2019s \u2014 1s it an accomplishment to have gotten out of \u2014 out\nfrom under the Nazis? Is it an accomplishment to have continued a life in which I\nwas able to strike back at the Nazis? All these are accomplishments, if you want to\n138September 25, 1998\ncall them that, that I relish, but I \u2014 I think they\u2019re sort of automatic. It\u2019s the sort of\nthing I felt I had to do. And that applies to everything. It applies to my struggling\nand typing a book with two fingers, sometimes three, to \u2014 and \u2014 and getting it\ndone. It applies to \u2014 to all these things which I don\u2019t consider accomplishments,\nbut as \u2014 as we said before, when you feel you have to do it because \u2014 I mean,\nmaybe another one of my colleagues had written a book. And some of them\nactually did, I think, for their own family accounts and so on. But I thought the\nimportant thing was not to tell my family, per se, the important thing was to get\nthe word out that this existed, and that 1t did happen. So that was an\naccomplishment if you will, but I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 I would substitute the\nphrase, 1t was something I had to do, rather than saying it\u2019s an accomplishment.",
        "Q: Along that same line, what do you feel you have yet to do \u2014 that you yet have\nto do?",
        "A: Well, what do I have to do? I\u2019m aware by simple arithmetic that I will not see\nmy grandchildren accomplish the things I\u2019d love to see them accomplish. So I\ntried to influence them by telling them a lot of stories. As you know, I\u2019m prone to\ndo that. And I\u2019ve just written a birthday poem for my 11 year old grandson, in\nwhich I urge him to become a Renaissance man. And I\u2019m si \u2014 when I told him that\nin person the other day, because his \u2014 he \u2014 he tends to have a \u2014 at present a one\ntrack interest in fishing and \u2014 and \u2014 fly fishing. He gets very sophisticated about\n139September 25, 1998\nhow and what, and he knows the name of every fish that ever swam in the water,\nwhich I think is very fine. But I say there is even more to the world than \u2014 than \u2014\nthan fish, and the great thing is to strive to become a Renaissance man, and then\nrelax with his fishing rod, and think about the great things that he has learned in\nother subjects. So, if I could guarantee that I can g \u2014 influence my grandchildren to\nlead meaningful lives, that would satisfy me no end.",

        "Answer: I wa \u2014I was born on the fifth of February, 1922 in Vienna, Austria.",
        "A: My name was Peter Ferdinand Arany, a-r-a-n-y.",
        "A: My name was changed by war office order on joining the commandos in 1942, I\nbelieve.",
        "A: Of the 86 people who were in my troop, I know of three who changed \u2014 who \u2014\nwho took their old name back. Most of us got used to the new names and identities\nAugust 7, 1998\nvery quickly and we \u2014 we looked upon this, unless we were attached to the former\nname, unless they were ancient family names, or this or that, the motivation to go\nback to the original name didn\u2019t exist for many of us.",
        "A: What name?",
        "A: What languages. Well, I was born w \u2014 my \u2014 my original language was the\nAustrian version of German, which incidentally has always been a little bone of\ncontention between Germans and Austrians. Austrians feel that the only correct and\nproper German is spoken in Austria, and different parts of Germany make the\nsame claim. Hamburg, for instance, han \u2014 Hannover, they think that\u2019s \u2014 they also\nthink that the claims by the others are absurd, and \u2014 and funny. I learnt a little\nFrench as a small child, we had a French teacher, a Madame come to the apartment\nand \u2014 and purportedly teach us French, my sister and myself. It didn\u2019t really work,\ndidn\u2019t go much beyond \u201cFr\u00e9re Jacques.\u201d And we didn\u2019t really like her; that didn\u2019t\nhelp. And \u2014 however, when \u2014 in my school system, we took a fir \u2014 a foreign\nlanguage from the age of 11, and I chose French. The teacher who taught French\nalso taught German and was the fore-master of my class. So he was the\nadministrative, disciplinary head of that class. And he wa \u2014 turned out to be one of\nthe well known arch-Nazis of Vienna. A published author, who when the Austrian\nAugust 7, 1998\nwriters club, the Pen Club, the International Pen Club, Austrian branch sent a\ntelegram to their Jewish colleagues in Germany to express their sympathy upon\ntheir book burning and treatment, there were two Austrian authors who refused to\nsign the otherwise unanimous declaration, and he was one of them. I got barely\npassing grades in German, which was my best subject, and I switched to the English\nclass because of him. Solely because of him. So I had four years of high school\nEnglish and I thought I spoke fluent English. That was disillusioned fairly quickly\nupon arrival in England, but I could get by fairly well. I learned a little Spanish\nbefore I left. This was really emigration learning other things type of thing. But I\ndon\u2019t think there was enough of it to have any impact.",
        "A: Victory in Europe. I\u2019m trying to think. The \u2014 the \u2014 strangely perhaps, the impact\nwas not enormous on us because we had felt pretty solidly that we had won, so the \u2014\nthe fact of the \u2014 of it becoming official was relatively minor. The date, if I recall,\nwas May \u2014 May eight, May eight. At May eight, I believe I was in cadet school in\nEngland, and there was a little bit of razzmatazz of people celebrating, cheering,\nwhat have you. And it \u2014 I think many of the cadets thought that now they were more\nlikely to go to the Orient than before. And that concerned me only marginally\nbecause I thought the British would surely send me somewhere where my fluent\nGerman would make sense. I \u2014 I made some halfhearted efforts to get sent to\nAugust 7, 1998\nAustria because that would have interested me, and besides, being to Germany for\nthe first time ever, during the fighting, and I had a distaste for going to Germany.\nSome of our people were there and sort of lived it up in occupation, but didn\u2019t\nattract me. The \u2014 the \u2014 the problem as to \u2014 who was and who wasn\u2019t a Nazi and so\non had already come up when \u2014 when we were fighting in Germany. And I was\ntold that chances of getting to Austria were minimal because they were being\nsupplied from central Mediterranean forces, meaning from Italy, whereas\nGermany was being supplied by personnel from northwest Europe, from \u2014 from\nour end. Th-The \u2014 the army has its own ways and when it came up, where I did go\nwas West Africa.",
        "A: St-Starting at the beginning, when I was in the Pioneer corps, I was a private and\nI saw no chance of ever getting promoted to anything, because I was just one of the\nyounger lads who was unloading trains or testing bridging material and so on. And I\n\u2014I wasn't one of the boot polisher and button polishers, so I \u2014 I wasn't a standout to\nthe people on the parade ground by any means. In-In fact, I was a bit of a\nnonconformist [indecipherable]. I was more likely to get in trouble about\nsomething than I was to get promoted. So, when I came to the commandos, just\nprior to D-Day, I was made a lance corporal, which was a big deal. It \u2014 it\u2019s nothing\nAugust 7, 1998\nreally, but as such I was the second in command of my detachment, a five man\nteam, attached to number six commando, we were number 10 commando at-\nattaching teams to eight different commandos for D-Day. So, I was a lance corporal\nand was subsequently promoted to be a corporal in the field, which caused a little\nargument because I said to my colleague and sergeant, who said, I\u2019m making you a\ncorporal and I said, you know, jokingly, want me to stitch on an extra stripe here in\n\u2014 in the front line? And he said, you\u2019re damn right. And I said I\u2014 you \u2014 you mean\nyou have the authority to make me a paid corporal? And he said, who said anything\nabout paid? And I came back as a corporal, largely because one of our detachments\nhad been wiped out and I became a one man detachment. When I came back I was\npromoted to sergeant and when we went out to Holland and Germany again, I was\na sergeant. And it was then that one of our own, who had been \u2014 who \u2014 who had\nbecome the commanding officer of our detachments, Kurt Gowza(ph) who served\nunder the name of James Griffith, wanted to send me to cadet school. And I said,\nat this stage, it\u2019s late in the war, do you think it\u2019s worthwhile? And I don\u2019t want to\ndo the parade square bashing and \u2014 and \u2014 and pamphlet bullshitting, I just don\u2019t\nwant to do it. And he persuaded me to do it, with the help of the brigade major, Sir\nMaxwell Hopagow(ph). He \u2014 they \u2014 they li \u2014 I wanted to talk to the brigadier, if \u2014\nif \u2014 if a commission then happened in the field, Montgomery was against\ncommissions in the field unless from dire need, casualties, because he said it leads\nAugust 7, 1998\nto fraternization through the enlisted men. Which we thought was just fine, and he\napparently as a [indecipherable] thought was in \u2014 improper. This is sort of regular\narmy smokiness, you know, and \u2014 and he s \u2014 he stopped quite \u2014 quite a few of us\ngot commissions 1n the field because they were doing a good job. And I \u2014 I fairly\nlikely m-might have gotten one, but when I was transferred from one unit to the\nother, I had to start from square one to build my reputation of being keen and\ndetermined and willing to do anything and so on. Which I did. And it led to the 1 \u2014\nthe notion of going to cadet school. I went to cadet school, and I must say I had a\nball. The fact that I\u2014 I m \u2014 I remember arriving and there were a whole bunch of\nyoungsters out of \u2014 out of school who were going to cadet school and they were\nstudying pamphlets. And they ask questions from the pamphlets and I had no idea\nwhat th-the answers were, b-but I said, I don\u2019t know the name of the plunger of the\n\u2014 this weapon, but we had a rather specialized version of that weapon for a special\noperation. Then suddenly everybody is listening and they want to know. Well, when\nit came to the tests, the same thing happened. Some \u2014 some weapon sergeant would\nask questions and say, ask me about the Sten gun. I said, Sten gun was not a\ncommando weapon, we used Thompsons, which are a higher quality. And the only\nSten gun I\u2019ve ever seen was one \u2014 a special one for an operation with a silencer. He\nsaid, a\u2014 a Sten with a silencer? I\u2019ve never seen one. Tell me about it. I said, P'\ndraw you a picture. And we talked about the Sten with the silencer for the rest of\nAugust 7, 1998\nthe examination. He said, I assume you were a weapons instructor. I said, I\u2019m not\nsupposed to comment. You abandon your rank when you are a \u2014 a cadet. But some\nlance corporal who was \u2014 had the job of taking the stripes off, relished to take a\nsergeants stripes off, you see, so he had slashed the sleeve of my best uniform and\nthere were cuts where my stripes had been. And the weapon instructor sergeant who\nwas doing the testing assumed \u2014 he could see I\u2019d been a sergeant by \u2014 by the cuts on\nmy arm. Well, I \u2014 I breezed through this whole thing like nobody\u2019s business and\nthen \u2014 then came to cadet school, and there I was quite determined to be a\nnonconformist and a rebel when nonsense was being talked about, you know,\npamphlet stuff, and \u2014 which often is \u2014 is outdated and \u2014 and \u2014 and has been written,\nwho knows for whom, and \u2014 and I would \u2014 I would say \u2014 well, for instance a\nquestion. What use is the Bren gun carrier? Hands go up and the cadets \u2014 the cadet\nkept asking questions, you see. And they said, to carry out flanking attacks, and\nsomebody else said something else, and when it was my turn, I said none. The Bren\ngun carrier is no use. I have seen more burnt out Bren gun carriers than \u2014 than non-\nburned out Bren gun carriers. It\u2019s a little [indecipherable] not enough armament.\nAnd I said, it is useful possibly for two things, which is to bring up the tea after\nbattle, or if you have nothing and want to fake like you have armor, you run them\noff somewhere where nobody can see them and the enemy will think you\u2019re coming\nwith a lot of tanks, because they make such a racket that they inevitably get shot at\nAugust 7, 1998\nand \u2014 and \u2014 and then that\u2019s when they burn. And the instructor said, th-that Masters\nis absolutely right, because he had just come back from Italy himself, so he knew\nwhat I am saying is true, you see? So \u2014 so after awhile I found out wasn\u2019t that much\n\u2014I mean, I wa \u2014 it wasn\u2019t working the way I had thought. I \u2014 I thought I'd be a\nrebel and I found the management agreed with me. Which was in a way, of course,\na big help and gratifying and so I graduated very high in my class, and that\u2019s the\nend of that one. Tha \u2014 you asked me what rank I was when I graduated. I was, of\ncourse, a second lieutenant and was subsequently promoted during my service in\nAfrica, aut \u2014 almost automatically to first lieutenant and then my time was up. Six\nyears. It was age plus length of service in the British army. So my number was up\nand I \u2014 somebody wanted me to stay as an instructor at the school of infantry and I\nsaid thank you but no thank you. Why not? Well, I said, In \u2014I-\u2014I-\u2014TI relish the\nillusion of freedom, that I can go wherever I want, whenever I want and not be sent.\nI\u2019ve been sent for a number of years now. So even bef \u2014 realizing it\u2019s an illusion,\nenough.",
        "A: Never saw one. Some of \u2014 few of us did. This really depended on what unit you\nwere with, and \u2014 and \u2014 and chance. And you have to bear in mind, commandos\nwere essentially assault units. And then they \u2014 th-the \u2014 the people in charge always\nAugust 7, 1998\nstretched what was an initial assault way beyond our normal role, because we didn't\nhave heavy support weapons, you know. But they had us, so they kept us. And if\nyou didn\u2019t happen \u2014 well, it \u2014 it just so happened that no concentrat-tration camp\nwas in the path of where they wanted a \u2014 a-a-a \u2014 an assault made. These were\nusually river crossings that they used us for, after the \u2014 the initial landings at \u2014 on\nD-Day or in Italy or in Sicily or in Holland. So, one of our people of course, as you\nknow, heard his parents might be alive in Terezin and went to \u2014 to go \u2014 go get\nthem, and succeeded. That was extremely gratifying. None of us, the rest of us even\nhave the slightest opportunity to do that.",

And other than looking for individual friends here and there, and \u2014 and fi\n\u2014 si\u2014later finding some, not very much finding materialized. There were things like\ngetting in touch again with people who had gone to Israel. Friends. Getting in touch\nAugust 7, 1998\nagain with such people as my kinderfraulein, my nanny in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 who had\nbeen in Austria throughout the war. In fact, we invited her to come and visit in\nLondon, and that was very exciting. So, not much in the way of \u2014 of finding people\nthat had \u2014 that had disappeared. There were some weird things. My \u2014 my mother\nlived in an apartment in London and once went to a neighbor to borrow some\nwrapping paper for a package she had to make in a hurry. And the woman said,\nwell, I have this one, you can turn it over, it\u2019s used. And on the reverse side were\nnames and addresses of my father\u2019s nephew \u2014 two of my father\u2019s nephews in New\nYork. Since my parents were divorced, my mother never pursued that. And I tried\nmuch later to see what I could find it, found some people by this un \u2014 very unusual\nname in \u2014 in the telephone directory and called them up and they said, it\u2019s just a\nname we call our firm, and there\u2019s no one here by that name. But, it went off into\nthe sand, nothing happened. Of course, you know, people still appear nowadays\nhere and there, and that could theoretically happen. My \u2014 I \u2014 \u2019m-\u2014I\u2019m still looking\nfor some of my classmates and when I came to Europe I used to read the telephone\nbooks wherever I was, to see what I could find. And sometimes I\u2019d find a name and\nsometimes I\u2019d pursue it and call up for some classmate or other, and not find them\nat home, or in the country or something. And it never really led anywhere. If I came\nback a few years later and looked in the phone book again, maybe a name was\nmissing and I assumed the person died, or moved. So it \u2014 not \u2014 not \u2014 not very much.\nAugust 7, 1998\nAnd by now, anyone older than I is likely to be dead. I mean, purely, technically,\nyou know, you \u2014 I-I\u2019m 76 years old. If I start thinking in terms of people who were\nolder \u2014 substantially older, 86 years old, how many are there, you know? So you \u2014\nyou find that \u2014 that some of this is \u2014 is quite \u2014 quite hopeless. When I was in\nLondon just now, a friend of mine whom I haven\u2019t seen since 1940-something,\nactually came from Munich to spend the day with me and we talked all day long\nabout the old times. He was especially good friend. I would never have \u2014 I would\nnever have recognized him in \u2014 in the street, or [indecipherable]. And \u2014 but \u2014 but\nwe had so many common memories that there was no shortage of material to talk\nabout.",
        "A: This is a question I \u2014 that 1s very difficult, and I have asked myself that, because\nno \u2014 many atime still, it\u2019s very, very hard to answer, because the fact that people\nwere being killed became known almost immediately. And by that I mean the\nanschluss was in 12\" of March 1938. At that time people were arbitrarily arrested.\nThe brutality in Austria was much more immediate than the gradual tightening of\nthe noose in Germany. Which of course was a good thing, except if it happened to\nyou. A good thing in that it scared you into action, which it didn\u2019t do for many\npeople in Germany, because it just got a little worse all the time. Well, in Austria\nAugust 7, 1998\nthe brutality was immediate and many people said, let\u2019s get out of here and \u2014 a \u2014 or,\nany border, quick. And not enough people said that and \u2014 and \u2014 but \u2014 but those who\ndid benefited from that scenario. Oh, people were arrested and in the beginning one\nasked naively, why were they arrested. And then there were some black humor\njests. They were arrested because they had eggs for breakfast. You know, the people\nwere still joking about this sort of thing. And then some of these neighbors or\nfriends who had been arrested, actually were released. And some of them were in\nvery poor condition, having been beaten and goodness knows what. So\n[indecipherable] became aware that people were being tortured or beaten. And\nthen in some cases one heard that the family received an urn with ashes, saying,\nshot while trying to escape. Well, shot while trying to escape. If this was some very\npeaceable neighbor, you know \u2014 knew them well, that this was not a man who was\ngoing to escape from \u2014 from benevolent detention. So there began to materialize a\ncertain awe of, are they coming for me, if they\u2019re coming for me, what will happen\nto me? Are they coming for my relatives? Should one work more actively on getting\nout, and \u2014 and so on. And this is \u2014 was a gradually increasing image, and I have a\nmemory. I haven\u2019t researched this, but I have a memory that there \u2014 I went to the\nmovies once in England, and there was a movie \u2014 there\u2019s \u2014 there was a group, you\nknow, like the Stoogies, called The Crazy Gang. Funny people in \u2014 you know, in \u2014\nin \u2014 movie comedians. And the thing was called, The Crazy Gang ina\nAugust 7, 1998\nConcentration Camp. Now, that\u2019s appalling, isn\u2019t it? I mean, I \u2014 I \u2014 I suppose in a\nway some of this Stalag 17 series became from a serious film into a TV series that\nwas humorous. It was a comical German and y-y-you remember that thing? Well,\nThe Crazy Gang in the Concentration Camp. One should really try and fish that out\nand look at it and see how \u2014 how appalling it \u2014 it might well be. But it shows you\nthe scenario that some people who were aware of the fact that there are\nconcentration camps thought it was a subject matter for a comical film. Now\n[indecipherable] seen from this end of \u2014 of \u2014 of history or time. So, what I\u2019m using\nit for here 1s to illustrate the unawareness of some, how real and how serious it was,\nand yet the awareness of others, but \u2014 but shout it in an ominous [indecipherable]\nof \u2014 of nothing, behind which you could not look. And that built and built and built\nand built until 1t became a fu-full awareness. When, I cannot put a date on that.\nThen there \u2014 there were stories, and I don\u2019t remember any more whether we heard\nthem then or later, of the man who tried to make \u2014 make the \u2014 the \u2014 the British awa\n\u2014 government aware \u2014 or first of all, tried to make his Jewish neighborhoods in\nPoland aware and went from village to village saying, Juden es brennt. And\nnobody believed him.",
        "A: Hm?\nAugust 7, 1998",
        "A: Oh, Jews \u2014 there\u2019s fire, 1t\u2019s burning. And \u2014 and this 1s \u2014 there were people who\nwere lobbying and \u2014 and trying to communicate bec \u2014 an-and \u2014 and \u2014 and failed, at\nthe Evian Conference, you \u2014 I\u2019m sure you knew. There were good people trying to\nget the government to do something. Now, some governments did do something.\nThe British government passed a bill in 10 minutes to let 10,000 children come to\nBritain. The same bill was on the floor of Congress and never got off the floor.\nUlterior motives, indifference, take your pick. Politics.",
        "A: Well, first of all, I had an attitude, which said, as Kurt Vonnegut says,\nunexpected opportunities to travel are dancing lessons from God. And I would\nnever have gotten to Africa, to West Africa in normal circumstances in my life.\nAnd I really relished the idea. So there was a shipload of \u2014 of young officers who\nwere to go to Africa, amusingly, on a ship called the Jan Sobieski. That doesn\u2019t\nmean anything to you, but Jan Sobieski was a king of Poland who was responsible\nfor the relief of Vienna from the Turkish siege. He came with the Polish cavalry\nand relieved fa \u2014 Vienna and \u2014 and saved western civilization, from what was\nprobably a superior civilization of the Turks but we are \u2014 haven\u2019t gotten to admit\nthat yet. They had social services far adva \u2014 in advance of what western civilization\nAugust 7, 1998\nhad. Well, the \u2014 the \u2014 that \u2014 th-there in \u2014 in the \u2014 1n the lounge was this great big\nportrait of Jan Sobieski and I was the only passenger on that ship who knew who it\nwas. We went to Africa and the purpose to send us was to train native troops as aid\nto civil power. Because the British had not yet decided to relinquish the empire.\nAnd in case they decided to hang onto the empire, they needed military support,\nideally from the local population, hopefully. Well, we didn\u2019t ever say that. What we\nwere doing 1s we were training native troops to wipe out remaining pockets of\nJapanese resistance in remote parts of the world. You know, there were Japanese\nsoldiers who were holed up on some Pacific island, I mean, Oriental \u2014 in the\nAleutian islands, wherever, and who either hadn\u2019t heard that they had surrendered\n20 years previously, or \u2014 well, at that time not 20 years. And every now and again\none of them would come out. Well, we were training our people to \u2014 our \u2014 our\nnative Ghanaians -- before there was a Ghana [indecipherable] to wipe out these\npockets of fanatic resistance. But what we were really doing 1s training them, you\nsee, to civil power. And I was greatly helped by my attitude, I really liked them.\nAnd they really liked me. They had nicknames for everybody. I was called\nlieutenant aero-plane driver. That was because I wore parachute wings, which \u2014 for\nwhich I had qualified, and they saw wings and they though wings must be an aero-\nplane, and what do you do with an aero-plane? You drive it. So I was lieutenant\naero-plane driver. And I talked to them, which many did not. And found it most\nAugust 7, 1998\ninstructive, the different philosophy, just beginning to be materialistic, but by and\nlarge, not materialistic. No work ethic. Now, you have to picture that. We are so\nsteeped into our work ethic that we say, if you are industrious you will be rewarded.\nThey say, do-do \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t make work. If things grow by themselves, then sow\nthem and then go and harvest them, but you don\u2019t have to work in between.",
        "A: Yes, well, the \u2014 the Africans were really just beginning in \u2014 1-1n that area. I\nmean, the present \u2014 the Africans would resent my saying some of these things\nbecause they want to be contemporary, modern people. And that\u2019s fine, although\none can\u2019t help but deplore losing certain things. For instance, the most important\nthing to the men was to talk. They would sit under a shady tree and talk and talk and\ntalk. And that was not something that you would say they are lazy and good for\nnothing. No, they were doing an important thing, they were talking. It\u2019s true that \u2014\nthat that meant more work for the women, but the tradition of that, I guess is so\nancient that it \u2014 it isn\u2019t a thing where you had the feeling that there\u2019s going to be a\nfeminist movement saying let the women sit and talk, let the men carry the logs.\nAugust 7, 1998\nYou know, it is a peculiar \u2014 a peculiar attitude that said \u2014 that admired certain\nthings. I can give you some sample conversations that are favorites of mine. That\nthe European or American countries is showing off too, what they can perceive to\nbe a primitive culture. And so you show them a picture of the Golden Gate bridge.\nAnd they say mm, fine bridge. And then comes a little noise, that you learn to hear.\nIt is ah. It\u2019s just a little doubt in the admiration. And they say, this bridge, fine\nbridge. What 1s it for? A very basic question. You say well, it\u2019s so people,\nobviously, can get from one side to the other. Ah, of course. Ah, why do the people\nfrom one side want to go on the other side? Well, some people work on one side\nand live on the other. Ah, ah yeah. There\u2019s no work on the other side. I said, yes,\nthere \u2014 there is work on the other side, but some of them \u2014 and so it goes. And then\nI say, well, you\u2019re giving me a hard time because obviously they are leading me on,\nyou see. You build bridges, you have bridges for \u2014 so, I mean, this is just a\u2014a\nbigger bridge. Yeah, fine bridge. Ah, how long it take to build this bridge? How\nmuch did it cost? Well, they have you, you know, I mean th-the \u2014 then \u2014 you now\nwould have to demonstrate that it is economically worthwhile to build all our\nbridges and that it pays, and \u2014 and \u2014 and that it\u2019s \u2014 makes more sense than \u2014 and so\non and so on and so on and so on. And this goes on and now I offer you \u2014 imagine\nwhat happened when one of the young officers committed suicide. British officers.\nFar away from home for the first time, unhappy, hot climate, who knows? I was the\nAugust 7, 1998\nmentor because I was the one they \u2014 that talked to them. So the natives gathered\naround me and said, why? And I said, he had \u2014 he was lonely, he had few friends.\nYou\u2019re not his friend? I said yes, I tried to be his friend, but he was unapproachable,\nI couldn\u2019t get to him. How is he better now than he was when he was lonely? I\u2019m\ngetting into theology here or whatever, you see, I mean I\u2014 so I say \u2014 I\ncounterattack. I said, there\u2019s nobody ever committed suicide here, your people?\nThat caused a huddle and a long discussion and then they came back and said,\nmaybe two people \u2014 no, maybe one lot of people, and then another person. And I\nsaid, when you mean \u2014 when \u2014 when you say a lot of people \u2014 well, long time ago,\nthe story, king died. King had 40 wives. Wives were singing pious songs and\nwalked into a swamp, to accompany the soul of dead king. Don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s\ntrue. Is that suicide? I said, well, I suppose so, I don\u2019t know. What\u2019s the other one?\nThere was this crazy woman, and some people say she jumped into a well, deep\nwell, died. Some people say somebody pushed her into the well. Some people say\nshe fell into the well. But some people say jumped into the well. That\u2019s the only one\nwe can think of. And I said, well what does a person do who 1s very unhappy? You\nca \u2014 you can\u2019t tell me everybody\u2019s happy all the time. Oh, he go for bush. That\nmeans into the jungle. Maybe drink some palm wine. Go to sleep. Wake up,\neverything fine. Not bad. You see? So \u2014 so \u2014 so Pm \u2014 I\u2019m -\u2014I\u2019m literally learning in\nmany ways, because we are so assuming that in our self righteousness that what we\nAugust 7, 1998\ndo is absolutely the only way, and in a way it explains that when \u2014 when \u2014 when\nslavery used some of these very places as a source, and transposed forcibly people\nwho did not have a work ethic and suddenly told them they had to work God knows\nwhat hours, that it was very tempting to say they are good for nothing and lazy. And\nthey were not good for nothing and lazy, we were stupid. And now all over the\nworld everybody\u2019s sins are coming home to roost. The British empire has fallen\napart and they are all coming to Britain and \u2014 and they used to sneer at the United\nStates for having racial problems, and they\u2019ve been relatively quiet recently. They \u2014\nit\u2019s not a question of racial problems, it\u2019s [indecipherable] at the bottom layer\nobjects cheap labor force coming in and so on and so on and so on.",
        "A: Well, in a word yes. Not-Not \u2014 not \u2014 not that specifically. I had a\u2014as a\nspecialist, and a \u2014 a fluent German speaker trained in the German armed forces, my\nlast attachment was with all Marine commandoes and the colonel, who was a great\nsoldier, was quite fond of me and after the war we had a drink at the Army-Navy\nclub in London. He introduced me to some retired Marine general and \u2014 who \u2014 who\ntold me how fortunate I was that I had the honor and privilege to serve with Marines\n\u2014 Marine commandos. And the colonel a-asked, what are you doing now? And I\nsaid, I\u2019m going to art school, because I \u2014 that\u2019s was \u2014 I was going to be a di \u2014\nAugust 7, 1998\ngraphic designer. And he said, lord bless my soul, whatever for? And I said, I want\nto be a graphic designer. He said, well, if you are stuck for anything \u2014 for something\nto do, I am taking up my post as inspector general of the Palestine police, and I \u2014\nthere\u2019Il always be a job for you. I said, thank you very much sir. And my mother\nhad mentioned that to a visiting friend from Israel, my th \u2014 as a son of my\ngrandfather\u2019s partner. And he said \u2014 she \u2014 she \u2014 she mentioned the colonel first of\nall, before all this took place. And he said he won\u2019t live long. And I said \u2014 my\nmother said, good heavens, why? And he said, well we have very \u2014 engaged in a\nwar to shake British domination of \u2014 of \u2014 of what is promised us under the Balfour\nDeclaration. And sh \u2014 if he is in charge of the Palestine police then 1-is \u2014 there is\nsomething very close to total war between us. And so a few days later this\nconversation I had at the Army-Navy club was reported to him and he said, he\nshould take it. And my mother was outraged, she said, you just said that the man\nhe\u2019d be working with isn\u2019t \u2014 may not live long and now you want my son to be in\nthat position? And he said, it might be very useful to have somebody in there. And\nmy mother said, but you said it\u2019s very dangerous. And he said, dane \u2014 what\u2019s\ndangerous? Walks across Piccadilly and a tile falls off a roof and kill you. That\u2019s\ndangerous. But Mother was not convinced, and \u2014 and 1-1-1t didn\u2019t happen. Now, it\u2019s\nalso true that there were services annually, memorial services, what have you, in\nWestminster Abbey and so on. And my \u2014 some of my fr \u2014I didn't attend any,\nAugust 7, 1998\nmaybe one, I can\u2019t remember. And a\u2014 some of my friends told me they went to it\nand as they came out there were people on either side of the entrance saying psst,\ncome here, I want to talk to you. And apparently they were recruiting. The \u2014 the\nIsraelis were recruiting, that is the \u2014 the Irgun, or whoever, or the Stern gang, or I\n\u2014I don\u2019t know. And on the other side the Arabs were recruiting, because they were\nrecruiting for the Arab legion and for what have you. And one of the commando\ncolonels came to command the Arab legion, Brigadier Young, whom I knew well in\nNormandy and \u2014 and so you see, there were both sides, very weird for \u2014 for\ncommandos. I mean, there was a demand for trained people. That still goes on in a\nway, because when I gave a book talk in Florida, a young man came in with a\nRottweiler on a leach \u2014 leash and I \u2014 I-I was amazed they let him into the\nbookstore, and he said, can \u2014 do you live in this area? And I said no, I\u2019m just here\nfor a few days. And he said, that\u2019s too bad, and I said why? And he said, I belong to\na group that is very interested in commando training. So you see, there are jobs\neverywhere.",
        "A: I first heard about it when I was maybe eight or nine years old, or maybe a little\nyounger. We had a game where you had to pick a nation, you represented that\nnation. And then when that nation was called you had to pick up the ball and hit\nsomebody with it. You know, throw at them. And there was one boy who always\nAugust 7, 1998\nsaid, Palestinian. It was Jewish boy. And I \u2014 I must have asked him, why do you\nwant to be a Palestinian? And he said, that\u2019s the country of our future. Obviously a\n\u2014 from a Zionist family. And I said why? And he said \u2014 he explained it to me as best\nas a young child could. And I was extremely puzzled, because we were so\nintegrated into Viennese middle class society, that the reaction would have \u2014 was\nwhy would we go and sit in the desert and become a part of some agrarian society\nwhen we are in an intellectual society here and part of [indecipherable]. And so it\ntook quite awhile to understand what this was all about. And of course, a lot \u2014 a lot\nof the most material contribution ca-came from Hitler, where people suddenly\nrealized that however integrated the \u2014 and accepted or honored they thought they\nwere, that didn't count any more. So, the notion of living there didn\u2019t really occur\nuntil relatively recently when it\u2019s part of a very broad overall attitude of mind that I\nhave felt that I could live anywhere and \u2014 and relish living anywhere and become\npart of living anywhere. And I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve only been to Israel once, and it was\nabsolutely wonderful, and if I haven\u2019t recently gone back, it\u2019s largely because I\nhave ma \u2014 we have discovered some distant relatives who want to take over if we\ngo there, and we are a little afraid of that because we\u2019d rather be our own \u2014\ndetermine on our own where we want to go, what we want to do. And that may be\ndifficult. But we'll \u2014 we\u2019ll go again. And we have many friends and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nAugust 7, 1998\nsome family. So I\u2014T\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m not an\u2014I\u2014I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m pro-Zionist, but not an \u2014 an\nactive person likely to make aliyah next week.",
        "A: And go where?",
        "A: We had just crossed the line, which I believe was in middle or late March, I have\nthe date, of course, in my book, in \u201945. And I \u2014 I was then sent to cadet school and\nthat would ch \u2014 check out with V-E day in May, it\u2019s a three months course, all\nright? So you have 45 \u2014 spring of \u201945 cadet school graduating perhaps in early June.",
        "A: Six months. And shortly after that \u2014 I mean, I went first to Colchester in Essex.\nI-I had hoped by the choice of my regiment and because I graduated high, you get\nyour first choice to get to Oxford, because I chose to be commissioned 1n the\nOxfordshire and Buckinghamshire light infantry. And I made mistake. They\ndidn't send me to Cowley Barracks in Oxford, they sent me to Colchester\n[indecipherable] city, but brimful of soldiers. I was in para \u2014 in a barracks where\nthere were three light infantry regiments. Each one had a different drill, totally\ndifferent drill. So that if you were orderly officer, which you were often, as a junior\nAugust 7, 1998\nofficer, you had to get the orderly sergeant, who was usually an old hand, and put\ncoins on the table. This half crown is me, this florin is you, this sixpence is the\nbugler, these are the ranks. And now, there were no words of command, it was all\ndone silently and precisely and we marched together for 12 paces and halt. We\nabout face, we do this, we do that, we [indecipherable] bugle \u2014 bugles and\n[indecipherable]. And the town would gather around the parade square, they would\nknow it better than I did, certainly. There was, for instance, no ceremonial march\npast for the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. It was a bubble past, being light\ninfantry, so you ran 12 abreast at the bubble, in step, in line and you were the officer\nout in front saluting the pedestal where the commanding officer stands. And if they\ndon\u2019t look lined up properly or in step properly, it\u2019s your fault, although you\nhaven\u2019t the slightest influence what\u2019s happening behind you. I also discovered that\n\u2014 so I had to learn three different drills. I also discovered that the \u2014 one of the\nreasons I had chosen the \u2014 the Ox and Bucks 1s because their airborne battalion had\ntaken the bridges on D-Day and we linked up with them, and they had done a\nbeautiful job taking these bridge intact. And they were delighted to see us, and we\nthem. It turned out they were persona non grata in their own regiment, because the\nregulars at the base considered them irregular forces, air landing people\n[indecipherable] pilots, parachutists, what have you, as I was, you see? So the ones\nwith the maroon beret of the airborne were looked at askance, and me with a green\nAugust 7, 1998\nberet is even worse. And I \u2014 I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of there, which I managed\nfirst of all to be sent to the school of infantry, and that was a course, company\ncommanders course. And that\u2019s when the major there said didn\u2019t I want to stay as\nan instructor, because we hit it off perfectly. It was the same principal as the cadet\nschool, I was telling them how it was and they agreed, because they were veterans\nfrom this campaign or that. And I turned it down for the illusion of freedom that I\ndescribed to you. Well, after that, West Africa and happy to get out of this place\nwhere the people seemed to have the attitude that these irregular force pe \u2014\nmembers were coming to take their jobs away [indecipherable] headquarters and\nGod, I would have paid not to take it away, you know? I \u2014 I \u2014 I wa \u2014 I wanted out,\nout. It\u2019s terrible. And \u2014 and I\u2019m delighted that my last six months were this extra\nboon of \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of Africa and the preceding course. All were lovely compared to\nbeing at the base.",
        "A: Ha, what marketable skills. I had strong cartoons in the army, and I had an older\nmentor who was a stage designer. And he advised me what to do with my cartoons,\nwhich he liked very much. And I had an interview with \u201cPunch.\u201d He said, you start\nat the top. I said, you mean at the bottom? He said no, at the top. If you can\u2019t hack\nit, you go down one rung. Wisdom. Well, they bought two ideas for cartoons and I\nwas so rich that I couldn\u2019t believe it. But this is before the commandos and the\nAugust 7, 1998\nPioneer corps. I-I got paid like for several months salary for two ideas. And I\nthought this is a lovely way of making a living. These were not political cartoons,\nthey were like \u201cNew Yorker\u201d type cartoons. And I drew another batch and I said I\nwould throw a party for the whole platoon, and the \u2014 nothing seemed to happen and\nthen a terrible thing. Well, I went to the local pub where I was well known and I\nsaid, I-I must give this party. I have a whole batch of cartoons out there and when\nthey come in I\u2019Il have plenty of money and right now I don\u2019t. And they gave me\ncredit and I threw a party, all the beer you can drink for the whole platoon. And the\ncheck hadn\u2019t come yet, th-the second installment, but after the party, I think one or\ntwo days later, it came saying the editor regrets at this time we are not buying any\nof the cartoons. And now I had absolutely six months to pay it off, you see. And I\ndidn\u2019t draw a cartoon for a year and a half, in utter depression. Now, I still thought\nthat in that direction was my \u2014 my \u2014 my future profession. I came out of the army\nand I made one brief attempt. I talked to a friend of my family\u2019s who was a\u2014as \u2014\njournalist. And she wrote things about resorts who then gave her a limousine, and\nyou know the bit. One of my daughters says it\u2019s half a step from prostitution, not\njournalism, but that\u2019s a matter of t \u2014 personal taste. Anyhow, I asked her, do you\nthink there would be some opening as an apprentice journalist somewhere? And she\nsaid no, completely hopeless. You might sell one story about your war experience,\nmaybe, but doesn\u2019t amount to much, everybody has stories. And I gave up. She\u2019s\nAugust 7, 1998\nstill writing a \u2014 a Austrian cooking column for a Jewish magazine in London, very\npopular. Written several books, still going to all the best resorts. Well, I thought \u2014 I\n\u2014I-\u2014I wrote her a note when my \u2014 when my book came out, and the movie rights\nwere bought. I haven\u2019t heard from her since. Anyhow, I gave up and I decided\nreluctantly I would have to go to school. So, my mentor, who had sent me with the\ncartoons, you know, to \u201cPunch,\u201d he said, I have a young woman friend who has\njust graduated from art school, and she said she would be willing to come and meet\nwith you and advise you which school to go to and so on. So we met in his studio\nand she [indecipherable] sort of snippety, brisk young woman, and she said, I went\nto the Central School of Art and Crafts, it\u2019s \u2014 I consider it the best school. It\u2019s very\nhard to get in and you probably won\u2019t. And sh \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014I said, you \u2014 you\u2019ve\ngraduated from there? Yes, she had graduated from there, and she was a German\nrefugee and she had been president of the student union, an elective office. Not bad\nfor a\u2014 for a refugee. Well, I was this commando first lieutenant, you see, and I\ndecided to go to that school and become president of the student union, as a matter\nof \u2014 point of honor, you see? And I did both. I\u2014I daresay my jingling uniform\nhelped a bit to boost my portfolio, but it \u2014 they accepted me and I went to that\nschool and I learned quite a lot. And after three years, my mother drew my attention\nto a middle paragraph in a paper that talked about Fulbright scholarships. And she\nsaid, wouldn\u2019t a graduate year be very beneficial for your career? Well, I had just\nAugust 7, 1998\nbegun to go and look for jobs and I found they paid nothing and wanted me to do\nthings that I was not willing to do. I\u2014 I \u2014I asked one studio where I went for a job,\nwhat would I have to show you that you would hire me? And they produced an\nextremely realistic painting of a plate of bacon and eggs, wi-with fat bubble in the\ncenter, and very real. And that\u2019s an illustrator, you know, I mean, I \u2014 obviously\nwhoever was talking to me didn\u2019t understand where I came from or didn\u2019t care.\nAnyway, I \u2014I said to myself, I shall never be able to do this and what\u2019s more I\ndon\u2019t want to be able to do that. I\u2019m a problem solver, I\u2019m a designer, I \u2014 I\u2019m a\u2014\nand for that they were willing to pay, I think, three pounds a week starting salary,\nand I \u2014 I thought that that was absolutely horrible. And I welcomed the opportunity\nto apply for the scholarship, for the Fulbright. And I did with full support of the\nprincipal of the school, a \u2014 a\u2014a Scottish painter who was not my friends because as\npresident of the student union, you can imagine we had many, many skirmishes. But\nhe said, America is entering what we entered in the first Elizabethan age, culturally,\nand you must go there. And o-off I went and they threw in a summer scholarship at\nYale, six weeks. And money was a problem, because sterling was not converted \u2014\nnot that I had any. But 1-it \u2014 it created a problem, because most art schools are not\nboarding schools. So I had to live somewhere. So I lived at International House in\nNew York, in the cheapest room in the basement, and developed techniques, how to\neat for little or nothing. I was also helped by the fact that my mother had a couple of\nAugust 7, 1998\ncousins where I was invited to dinner once a week and they\u2019d give me sandwiches\nfor the next couple of days. And then I\u2019d buy a box of cereal and I\u2019d buy a loaf of\nbread. And I couldn\u2019t afford the school cafeteria, but I could buy 20 cents worth of\nbologna or cheese, and that would stretch for a couple of meals with my loaf of\nbread. And as to \u2014 and \u2014 and a carton of milk, which I put on the windowsill to \u2014 to\nkeep cool. A-And \u2014 and I discovered the American luxury, there\u2019s free sugar in the\ncafeteria, where you can help yourself, put a couple of packages in your \u2014 in your\npocket and with my box of cereal I had breakfast every morning, and my carton of\nmilk, you know. And it \u2014 it worked. And I started to freelance. There was a woman\nwho did [indecipherable] greeting cards, and I did the finished drawings. Making\nthe bells on the wedding cards nice and oval, the polka dots round. And listening to\nthese \u2014 the radio programs of the day, like the trace of lost persons, the FBI and\npeace and war. I got a whole education. And I worked there some nights a week.\nAnd then the father of a schoolmate of mine from Vienna had a business of\nembroidering blouses, women\u2019s blouses. And he \u2014 he paid for these designs, lots of\nmoney. And he didn\u2019t want them finished, he wanted them on tracing paper so he\ncould trace them onto the blouses. Now I employed my best friend to help me, we\nhad so many to do. Unfortunately we discovered it late in the year, but we could\nactually afford to go to the movies, which we hadn\u2019t been able to do before. Was a\nsensational year at International House. We put on shows. And if I give you the\nAugust 7, 1998\ncast, let me say that one of our fellow students was Leontyne Price. So we had the\nbest show in town, and a bunch of Hawaiian friends which [indecipherable]\nsometimes still in touch, who were musicians. Was lovely.",
        "A: \u201949, I believe, if I\u2019m not mistaken. I can verify that, but I think that\u2019s right. For a\nyear. And \u2014 and \u2014 and there is the story I \u2014 I once mentioned to you, which I think is\nvery wor \u2014 well worth saying. My ow \u2014 my own attitude was I could not live in this\ncountry, because I\u2019d just been through six years of war against discrimination and I\nwas seeing the newspapers and what have you that din \u2014 din \u2014 discrimination in this\ncountry was rampant. I \u2014 I\u2014 I read the \u2014 the anti-Semitic diatribes of \u2014 of \u2014 on the\nhill, of [indecipherable] and \u2014 and Father Coughlin(ph) all this was not unfamiliar\nto me, but then the discrimination against black people seemed totally intolerable.\nAnd a couple of things happened. I arrived on the Queen Mary on my Fulbright,\nand there was a green uniformed customs official who looked at my papers and \u2014\nand looked at my \u2014 my suitcase, my shipping trunk, whatever I had brought, and he\nsaid, how long do you propose to stay here? And I said, oh I don\u2019t know, I have a \u2014\na year\u2019s \u2014 I mean, a school year\u2019s scholarship, preceded by six weeks in Yale. And I\nmight hitchhike around a bit to see some of the country. So, it\u2019ll be a year, or \u2014 or\nmaybe 18 months at the most. And he said no. And I said, I \u2014 I beg your pardon?\nAnd this great big, red-haired Irishman, you see \u2014 I said, you mean I can\u2019t do that?\nAugust 7, 1998\nAnd to my utter amazement he put his arm around my shoulder and he said, young\nman, this is the country to live. And we \u2014 we need young people to come here, and\nyou don\u2019t want to go back after 18 months. And I was completely floored by this,\nbecause I had seen customs officials in \u2014 in Austria, in Germany, in France, in\nBritain, and never had anyone said a fre \u2014 a \u2014 a friendly word. It wasn\u2019t fashionable\nuntil that time. Now they say welcome to the country or something, but this 1s all\nthe last few years, you know. To me, this was absolutely stunning. I\u2019ve never\nforgotten it.\n[break]",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 the s \u2014 the next thing that made a tremendous impression was 1n this\nsix week course a-a-at Yale, which was for students 20-odd students from different\ncountries all over the world who were coming to \u2014 to study for year, and this was\nsort of a conditioning, American studies, you know, so they would not get too much\nof a culture shock because university here was different from university in their\nown countries. And there were courses in \u2014 in politics and in English and in\nAugust 7, 1998\nliterature and so forth. And one of them was in sociology. The professor was a\nprofessor by the name of Serge(ph) Yamaki(ph), a Finnish American, young man\nwho was wonderful. I had never had a professor like that. He told it how it is, talked\nstraight. He talked about religion in this country. He said there are statistics about\nhow many people go to church. I assure you a percentage, or a large percentage of\nthe \u2014 the majority of people going to church \u2014 to various churches, doesn\u2019t matter\nwhich, are going to show their Sunday clothes, or their automobiles, or whatever. It\nbecomes a social thing. It has very little to do with religion. We had a course \u2014 oh,\noh and he talked about discrimination and about what must have been the first\nseedlings of the Civil Rights movement. And he said, this is an uphill struggle, it\u2019ll\ntake a while, but it\u2019s moving along. We are correcting. There are \u2014 there are serious\nattempts to correct the wrongs of the past. And he went into detail saying what\npeople were doing and what was going on and so on. And you had not heard about\nthat in Europe, you only heard about the negative stories. So I became aware that\nsomebody was trying to do something. And that was \u2014 that \u2014 I\u2019d perhaps been hasty\nwhen I said I could never live in a country where these things exist, as long as there\nwere forces at work that were trying to counteract the \u2014 the \u2014 the bad things I had\nheard. Well then circumstances overtook me. I \u2014 I met my wife again, after we had\nknown each other in London, in fact we had been double dating, but not a-as each\nother\u2019s partner. And she went to America when the Czech government in exile\nAugust 7, 1998\ncollapsed because of the Czech coup in Prague, the communist coup, and she was\nnot going to go back to Prague under the communists. So, she had helped out the\nsecond world meeting of the International Monetary Fund which was in London,\nand sh-sh-she was o-on loan to them from the Czech government be \u2014 just before\nthe coup. And they offered her a job in America and she said, I am very happy\nhere, and when the Czech government collapsed, somebody remembered the \u2014 her\njob offer and he \u2014 he \u2014 he restated it and she accepted. So she came what she\nthought was for a year to work for the Monetary Fund in Washington, and she\nworked there for 36 years. And I came and \u2014 to the United States and one day \u2014\nthere was a Greek student in International House who said, I\u2019m hitchhiking to\nWashington, anybody want to come? I said, I know somebody in Washington, let\nme try and get to a telephone. Well, I tried and \u2014 and they told me that the United\nNations were in Flushing Meadows, New York, and I said yes, but a branch, and I\ngot a Russian operator and forget it, I could not convince her that there was any\nUnited Nations here, which of course there was, the World Bank and Monetary\nFund, and a couple of other one. I gave up. So did the Greek chap, by the way. Said,\nah, I\u2019m not going. So that was \u2014 I \u2014I\u2019d looked for telephone listings under her\nname, there was none. Anyway, I \u2014 I just gave up. I\u2014 a short while later she went\non home leave, which was London, although she is from Slovakia. Ka \u2014 children\u2019s\ntransport survivor. And my \u2014 our mutual friends gave her a book that had just come\nAugust 7, 1998\nout, \u201cThe Green Beret\u201d by Hilary Saint George Saunders. It was the first book\nabout the commandos by a historian. And they said, bring that to Peter. And she\nsaid, where? He\u2019s in New York. Really? I\u2019m going through New York, I'll bring it\nto him. She did and I said I tried to come and see you in Washington, told her the\nstory. She said, you \u2014 you must come and see Washington. So I hitchhiked to\nWashington, which if you had a straight ride took seven and a half hours, before\neverything. Before \u2014 before the bridge, before the parkway, before the tunnel in\nBaltimore. And I then developed the habit of hitchhiking after school on Friday to\nWashington and we got engaged and in the spring of 1950 we were married. And I\ncould now stay under \u2014 as the family member of a U.N. employee, and work. And I\ngot job in Washington and I\u2019ve been here ever since.",
        "A: It was like a homecoming. I had been engaged to a \u2014 a \u2014 an Irish Protestant girl\nwho was as liberal as the day is long and as bright as can be, and that, however, did\nnot include her family. Her father was a colonel and he was the \u2014 one of the leading\nheart specialists in \u2014 in Ireland. And he wer \u2014 had been a colonel at\n[indecipherable] the African \u2014 north African campaign. He was actually in on the\nconcentration camp reparations in Europe. And you would have thought that that\nmight impact him in some way, and it di \u2014 it certainly impacted him, but the \u2014 the\nnotion of his daughter marrying a foreigner, a Jew, an artist, all bad. You see, so the\nAugust 7, 1998\n\u2014 the mother was also a doctor, a research. The young woman herself, her father\nwas a professor at Queens in Belfast. She went to Trinity in Dublin, which is, of\ncourse, Catholic. And so, we did a lot of commuting between Dublin and Belfast\nand I got s \u2014 deeply into the Irish problem, so similar to the Israeli problem, so\nsimilar to so many of the other discriminatory problems. And found th \u2014\nintellectuals or not, there was no reasoning with the people. They believed every\natrocity story. They told me the same atrocity stories north and south, with a change\nof characters. And \u2014 and the young people were generally against that. But they had\na tremendous uphill struggle. Anyway, the mother, the researcher doctor said do not\ntell Dad that you are getting engaged, because it will kill him. In defense of this\nabsurd attitude, let me tell you that my own family was not lagging far behind. And\nmy mother\u2019s eagerness to get me on that graduate year to America was without a\ndoubt largely motivated by \u2014 she was even willing to not be near me 1-1n order to\nsave me from a fate worse than death 1n \u2014 in her \u2014 in her view. And \u2014 and so \u2014 so\nwhat \u2014 what can I say to you? It is a\u2014 an amazing thing. I have never found out\nwhat happened to this young woman, who was certainly completely innocent of \u2014 of\nanything that took place. And for awhile I was in \u2014 in agony to make a decision\nwhat I would do with my life before I decided to marry my wife, whom I admire\ntremendously as the child survivor of her entire family. The three children were the\nonly survivors, everybody else was murdered. And so you do what you feel you\nAugust 7, 1998\nmust do. And I as \u2014 must say I \u2014 we\u2019ve had an absolutely marvelous marriage. With\nthe millennium it'll be our golden wedding anniversary. And ma \u2014 the secret recipe\nis respect and admiration.",
        "A: Not really, not really. I would say we had a mixed bag of friends, some refugees,\nGermany and Austria and Hungary and so on. And quite a few British people.\nYou see, I\u2019ve been several people in my life. I\u2019ve been a student, so I had art\nstudent friends. I had \u2014 some of whom became very famous artists. I had been a\u2014a\n\u2014a soldier, not only with other foreigners, but with British colleagues. When I was\nin London just now, one of my friends from cadet school, who was a fellow\ncommander with whom I'd actually done a night patrol in Normandy, without us\nrealizing it until we told each other the stories, that we obviously were both on the\nsame thing, in cadet school we were very close friends, and he is as English as they\nmake them, and he came to see me up from Essex, where he now lives. And we said\nwe\u2019ll have lunch in a pub, and a drink. And he told me that it was his 75\" birthday.\nAnd I said how c \u2014 how could you leave your family on your 75\" birthday? And he\nsaid, I told Peggy I\u2014 I w \u2014I wanted to do this. And he said, you don\u2019t realize it, but\non my 50\" birthday I happened to be visiting you in Washington. And on my 21\u00b0\nAugust 7, 1998\nbirthday we were both in Normandy. So I thought it appropriate. He also brought\nme a thing he had written about his D-Day experience. It is extremely moving. It\nwas his father\u2019s birthday, D-Day. And when it was over, D-Day night, he said, I felt\n\u2014 I suddenly reflected that I was very grateful not to have spoiled my father\u2019s\nbirthday by becoming a casualty. So, I\u2014 I \u2014I think his D-Day account is brilliant.\nHe writes as I wish I could, and he in turn, has read \u2014 read my book and he said to\nme \u2014 he wrote me a letter and he said, I\u2019ve read your book, and you\u2019re not supposed\nto enjoy a book about such grim times and experiences. But you and I know that in\nbetween the grim times and experiences, we had some wonderful times. So forget\nwhat I said about \u2014 I really enjoyed your book, because it\u2019s like you were there, I\nmean, when you read it. And so is his. And he says, you know, D-Day wasn\u2019t so\nbad for us compared to what we experienced in the next few days afterwards, and\nthat\u2019s true. But in describing his D-Day, he tells me where \u2014 you see, he was \u2014 he\nhad a disadvantage over me. He was surrounded by all the people with whom he\nhad trained. I was one of me attached to people I barely knew. A training mistake,\nthey should have put me with them earlier. But, when they were killed, I didn\u2019t\nknow them. When his buddies were killed, and one was like shot in half crossing a\nroad in front of him, these were his friends. So it was much more personal for him,\na-and I respect that, I mean I \u2014 I never saw one of my immediate friends killed or\nwounded. I saw a lot of people killed or wounded, but not my immediate friends.\nAugust 7, 1998\nThey were attached to the unit next door, as \u2014 a specialist as I was, to this. So it \u2014 it\nmade a-an emotional difference that was to my advantage. I mean, I was shocked\nenough when I heard that two chaps down the road whom I knew very well had \u2014\nhad just been killed, you know, and so on. I don\u2019t see them. And I was Tommy gun\nguard for a burial party that buried, I don\u2019t know, 40 people. I didn\u2019t know any of\nthem. So it \u2014 it \u2014 you know, these are all factors in this thing, it\u2019s a very, very\npersonal the experiences.",
        "A: Both of which? The Nuremberg trials \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "A: No, no, I never had the opportunity, nobody asked me. It didn\u2019t happen. I\nfollowed it closely and \u2014 and relished the just punishments of some of the\nparticipants. I also was aware that many people were given immunity for \u2014 for\nreasons of practicality of \u2014 of [indecipherable] scientists who were needed and\ngoodness knows what else. It did not involve me personally. I now welcome the\nAugust 7, 1998\nnotion that \u2014 that Palestine \u2014 that \u2014 that Israel came into existence, and I have\nmentioned to you before my Scottish principal with whom I used to skirmish in art\nschool, and I remember that I was in his office when the assassination of Count\nBernadotte came th-through \u2014 the news came through. And I said, I\u2019m shocked\nabout that, one should not kill United Nations officials. I-I think that\u2019s beyond the\npale. And he said, to my utter amazement, these are the birth pains of a new nation,\nand you have to accept it, that this is the sort of thing, we don\u2019t know the details.\nAnd later of course, I heard that Bernadotte was targeted because he was assuming\na stance of a very unfavorable [indecipherable] and so on and so on. But I was\namazed that this Scotsman had the vision to s \u2014 way beyond mine, that this was a\nthing you had to take into your stride. Anti-Semitism, which is coming back to early\nChristian, didn\u2019t affect, but you have to bear in mind that all our chaps had cover\nstories and many of them found the [indecipherable] of that cover story was\ncomfortable, and so they didn't say who they were. Many of them didn\u2019t practice\nany religion particularly, and when it came to intermarriage, all of us were\nindependent enough to say if I want marry an Eskimo, I will. Metaphorically\nspeaking, quite a few married Eskimos, which some of them came to regret. But\nthat doesn\u2019t alter the fact that on principle, you felt, I\u2019m my own person, I can do\nwhat I like. Now comes the question which is probably down your list somewhere,\nof \u2014 of h-how much did Judaism mean? It\u2019s very difficult. On the one hand, some of\nAugust 7, 1998\nus had a reaction, saying I don\u2019t want to belong to anything that excludes\nsomebody. That\u2019s a very broad statement, but \u2014 but 1-it\u2019s meant to be. I don\u2019t want\nto belong to a Jewish club. That means only Jews can join, because that is the\nexclusion of somebody and that\u2019s what we were just fighting against. I don\u2019t want\nto belong to another club either, that include \u2014 excludes people. In fact, I don\u2019t want\n[indecipherable]. But it goes beyond that, because you say, if I send my children to\nSunday school, or they belong to a club, I don\u2019t want to join any clubs. Clubs\nsegregate. That\u2019s not always reasonable, but that\u2019s an emotional reaction to some of\nthe things that have happened before. So you see, we did not send in our children to\n\u2014 to Sunday school. I had two daughters and a son. We had the son, the son was\nBar Mitzvahed. The girls were not Bat Mitzvahed because we hadn\u2019t even heard\nof that in Europe. The son was Bar Mitzvahed. When he was born he did not have\na bris, he was circumcised in the hospital. It\u2019s again the emotional reaction against\nbelonging to something that excludes other people. It\u2019s quite absurd if you reflect\nupon it, and it\u2019s taken me years to \u2014 to \u2014 to overcome it. But \u2014 but it was a very real\nfactor, possibly an error, socially, possibly an error religiously, because parallel to\nthat are the war memories of going to shul with my grandfather, who was very, very\nserious about it, as my parents were not. And the tug of war between the sentiment\nan \u2014 of emotional tradition on the one hand, and the not wanting to belong to\nanything that excludes anybody else is an ongoing thing. Right now I\u2019m deeply\nAugust 7, 1998\nembroiled in a fight that I find myself in, rather surprisingly. It is that the members\nof my troop of \u2014 of foreign refugees, want to put up a memorial to the troop and the\n20 who were killed in north Wales where we were trained. This 1s all initiated by\nmy book, where it suddenly has sort of come to \u2014 come alive, and a retired judge\nwho was one of us, refugee from Germany, has taken the ball and is running with it\nlike crazy, and the people in north Wales think that the movie will be made in \u2014 in\nnorth Wales, which of course doesn\u2019t follow. But \u2014 so the local council and the\ncouncil of Wales is all in favor and has given us a lovely little green plot\noverlooking the ocean in this resort town, where they are going to put up a\nmemorial. And when they drafted the words, it said, refugees from Nazi oppression.\nIt did not use the word Jewish. And I\u2019m up in arms, and I say it has to include the\nword at least mostly Jewish. And in order to bring this about, I am fighting tooth\nand nail, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m enlisting the support of my surviving colleagues or their\nwidows. I sought an interview with the Honorable Miriam Rothschild, who was\nmarried to one of our chaps and is a wealthy ma \u2014 scientist in her 90\u2019s. And she\nsaid, you must come down and talk about it, and I just now I went to the Rothschild\nestate and we spent all day talking and she is solidly on my side. And the \u2014 the thing\nthat\u2019s happening is that some of the chaps who have embraced their cover story,\ndon\u2019t want to break that cover story. It is as if they thought that the York massacre,\nof which they have never heard, happened last year rather than hundreds of years\nAugust 7, 1998\nago, and that by assuming the \u2014 their identities as British citizens church of\nEngland, which is what our dog tags said, they are escaping any danger of anti-\nSemitism and they have forgotten who they really are. Or rather, they would like to\nforget. Not all of them. Some of the non-Jewish members of the troop, there is a \u2014a\n\u2014a fellow, he is now in his 80s, friend of mine, who \u2014 whose name is Gizer(ph), he\nserved under the name of Gordon. He is a grandson of Walter Liebknecht(ph).\nWalter Liebknecht(ph) was the buddy and companion of Rosa Luxemburg, if that\nmeans anything to you, early German communism. His father, the son of Walter\nLiebknecht(ph) \u2014 Walter Liebknecht(ph) was assassinated by forerunners of the\nNazis in the 20s. There is a Kathe Kollwitz woodcut, a gorgeous woodcut of the \u2014\nthe body of Walter Liebknecht(ph) and mourners. She was very much involved in\nthat, Kathe Kollwitz. Well, the grandson of Walter Liebknecht(ph), not Jewish,\nsaid there is not a drop of Jewish club in \u2014 blood in me, but I respect, applaud and\nsalute my Jewish comrades and their bravery and I am on your side that it should\nsay mostly Jewish on the monument. Another one, Ron Gilbert Goodman, he\nserved in undercover intelligence in Germany after his command of duty. He got\nan MBE, Member of the British Empire in \u2014 from \u2014 from the queen, and he said \u2014\nhe maintained his cover longer than anybody, because he had to. He was \u2014 he was\ncatching Nazis, you see. Post-war Nazis. And he said \u2014 it was a bit embarrassing\nbecause he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s widowed, his girlfriend wanted to read the book and he thought\nAugust 7, 1998\nwell, that will break my cover as far as she\u2019s concerned. But while he \u2014 they were\ndiscussing it, she got it from Amazon dot com and read it and \u2014 and he said, the hell\nwith the cover, I\u2019m on your side. He remembers that he was forced to destroy his\nshul, by the Nazis. So you see, for the judge, it\u2019s probably very difficult to go to the\nWelsh council and say, on reflection, it ought to say mostly Jewish. And I don\u2019t\nknow whether he\u2019s man enough to do it. But if he isn\u2019t, Pll withdraw my support.\nThat\u2019s how that one 1s.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I doubt it. I\u2014 I think \u2014 I mean, as a colonel, somebody might have said these\npeculiar chaps we are giving you here are German speakers. But I mean, the\nbrigadier, Lord Lovett(ph) until he was wounded, had some very early members of\nthe forerunner of the two who I think were Sudeten Germans. Now, well a\u2014 we\ndidn\u2019t know them, they were killed at Dieppe on \u2014 in the raid. They might have\nbeen Sudeten German Jews. No idea. Didn\u2019t know them, I don\u2019t know their real\nnames. But he was very fond of referring to all of us as good Germans, you see?\nAugust 7, 1998\nSudeten Germans. He didn\u2019t understand what that meant, really. Scottish highland\nchief, you know, head of the [indecipherable], the 17\" Lord Lovett(ph). He \u2014 he\ndoesn\u2019t understand what \u2014 who \u2014 who \u2014 who we are, although he subsequently\napparently did. I ust \u2014 in Scotland I talked to the widow of the brigade major, Lady\nHopagow(ph) and she was full of \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 brimful of Holocaust stories and \u2014 and\n\u2014 and saying how \u2014 how supportive she was and so on. But, the Honorable Miriam\nRothschild tells me that when she was in north Wales, first as the fianc\u00e9e of one of\nour people, the landlady said she did not wish her to come again, because she didn\u2019t\nwant a Jewish person in her house. And then she said two other things happened.\nOne was that Lord Rothschild was in MI-5 in British Intelligence, counter-\nIntelligence, and he told her that somebody had accused her in Wales to be\nprobably a spy, and that they had actually searched her belongings. And she said,\nhow could they? And sh \u2014 he \u2014 he actually cited examples of a crossword puzzle\nshe had been working on, that MI-5 knew had \u2014 had been extracted from her room.\nAnd when she \u2014 ou-our man, of course, was under his cover story, the one who was\nengaged to her, so he couldn\u2019t say anything in particular. And when they were\nmarried, they kicked him out too. So, for that reason she was against that memorial\nand I said to her, I\u2019m much more confrontational than you are. If there was a\nmanifestation as you describe, of anti-Semitism, the more reason to have a\nAugust 7, 1998\nmemorial there saying mostly Jewish, so that, you know, what\u2019s wrong with that?\nAnd she agreed with me.",
        "A: The answer 1s, I don\u2019t know. I simply don\u2019t know. He was an autocrat and we \u2014\nwe \u2014 we fought quite a bit because of various school matters. And \u2014 but he\nrespected me and I respected him in \u2014 1n-in \u2014 in our stubbornness. And what he\nknew, I really don\u2019t know. I told you some of my fellow students became very\nfamous. I tried to talk one of them out of his career because he wanted to be a\nscenic designer and I said, there\u2019s no future in that field. And he almost changed his\nmajor, but then he stayed a scenic designer. He 1s now one of the most famous ones\nin the world. He has, I think, a CBE from the queen and he is working. We couldn\u2019t\nmeet because he was doing an amphitheater in the south of France. And he called\nme and we had a long chat. And then he is going to ho \u2014 Peking, and then he is\ngoing to Hong Kong and then he is going to Kuala Lumpur and in between he is\ndoing \u201cMidsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d in Copenhagen. In \u2014 he was doing\n\u201cNabucco,\u201d which is a Jewish Verdi opera, I mean, Jewish subject about\nNebuchadnezzar and what have you, and the Jews in the south of France, in the\nhotbed of French neo-Nazism. And so he had, in an amphitheater, which makes it\nmore difficult, he projected a Star of David over the amphitheater. And at first it\nAugust 7, 1998\nwas going to be during the famous Nabucco chorus of the \u2014 of the Jews. And then\nhe said, in reflection, after reflection, I\u2019d like to make a political statement. So I\nwant it from the beginning of the overture, through the first act, the Star of David\nprojected onto the entire amphitheater.",
        "A: His name is Ralph Koltai. He \u2014 he was material in the Sydney Opera House\ndesign, etcetera, etcetera. And he is \u2014 when \u2014 when I \u2014 when I relinquished my year\nas president of the student union, he was my vice president and followed me as\npresident of the student union. He is from Berlin, Hungarian Jewish family. And I-I\nfirst noticed how famous he was when I saw a play in Washington where the\nprogram notes said that the scenic designer was a student of Ralph Koltai\u2019s. So\nthat, I suppose means you have arrived. He is sending me a book, he had a big\nretrospective recently, and I am sending him my book, so we are exchanging \u2014\nexchanging books. I\u2019m very thrilled and he is very, very enthused about the fact that\nI wrote my book.\nAugust 7, 1998\nultimately the declaration of independence and statehood. For you, as a Jewish\nrefugee, what was going on in your mind in England in those days?",
        "A: Well, as I have really explained when I talked to you about my conversations\nwith Mr. Johnson \u2014 I didn\u2019t mention his name either, William Johnson was the\nScottish painter who was the principal of my school. He must be long dead. I \u2014 a-at\nfirst abhorred the violence, and it took me awhile to \u2014 to settle into the\nunderstanding that he had ahead of me. I \u2014 I could not at first fathom that oh,\nblowing up the King David hotel was a good thing to do, you see. Difficult. I \u2014 I-I\nrespect his explanation that he gave, saying the birth pangs of a nation, you see.\nBut, at first it was very difficult to grasp that the average \u2014 I mean, you have to bear\nin mind, you\u2019re a British soldier and you are assigned to this. Now, I have a friend\nwho was in the Pioneer corps with me, his name is Peter Bloch(ph). He is from\nGermany, a refugee, Jewish refugee. He volunteered and he got into the 21\"\nindependent parachute company, which was \u2014 had some foreigners in it, British\nparachute company. He found himself in Greece, fighting civilians, political\ncivilians and he hated it. It \u2014 1t ma \u2014 pushed him wa \u2014 way over left politically and\nthen he was assigned to Palestine with the six \u2014 with the first airborne division.\nAnd he said, I don\u2019t want to go. And they said, well, what do you mean? You are a\nwar hero, you\u2019re \u2014 he said, I\u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 you can call me what you will. I may have\nbeen a war hero in your eyes, but now I\u2019m a conscientious objector. And I think he\nAugust 7, 1998\nmanaged that, conscientious objection not to serve with the first airborne in \u2014\nBritish first airborne in what was Palestine. And surely you can understand it. I\ncan\u2019t understand that it threw him, but I can understand but I don\u2019t agree that it\nmade him go way over to the left when he studied at the [indecipherable] school of\neconomics and we used to have arguments about that. And I think he has settled\ndown more or less as a liberal. But a\u2014 a \u2014 a\u20141n~\u20141n his youth certainly the people\nhe was hanging out with were \u2014 were a mixed bag of people who were reading the\n\u201cDaily Worker\u201d in the London underground demonstratively, and I remember\nhearing them complain saying I wish they\u2019d give us a new one, I\u2019m getting fed up\nholding this paper all the time. But it\u2019s done for demonstrative purposes, you see.\nThe \u2014 well, the whole communism question, of course had s \u2014 got into the act in\nthat when \u2014 when Stalin did some of the things he did, he became unacceptable,\nand the people who had been supportive of \u2014 of \u2014 of communism suddenly found\nthemselves in a rather awkward position, because how do you backtrack when\nyou\u2019ve been such an enthusiast? And suddenly you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re \u2014 the people you\nhave been following are committing atrocities that you cannot \u2014 cannot accept. So, I\n\u2014 I never \u2014 I never got into that communist game as so many young students did. I\nsuppose it was a question of upbringing, because after losing World War I, for\nwhich many Jewish Austrians were great enthusiasts, they \u2014 they suddenly found\nthat war is hell. Meaning the depression following it, meaning defeat, meaning the\nAugust 7, 1998\npeculiar post-war \u2014 post World War I dealings, politically, where Austria was\ncompletely emaciated to a six million country from being a world empire. And\npeculiarly Germany, which was the much younger country, something like 2,000\nyears of Austria compared to 90 years of Germany. Germany was intact and more\npowerful than ever after \u2014 well, not economically, but \u2014 but territorially. So, you\nhear of Germans yearning for a return to power. You ga \u2014 you do \u2014 never hear of\nAustrians yearning for a return to power, because they were made up of so many\nminorities, that wanted to be torn apart. Which you see again in what used to be\nYugoslavia. Every minority wants to be independent, whether they are viable or\nnot. First independence, then maybe we\u2019ll confederate. I'll believe it when I see it.\nTerrible.",
        "A: My years in postwar England were primarily as a student. I had a \u2014 a wonderful\ntime. I had \u2014 there was no G.I. bill, but there was a so-called further education and\ntraining grant, which was more modest than the G.I. bill, but it certainly sustained\nme together with my freelance activities. And I had my \u2014 my own apartment in\nsouthwest London, and I traveled mostly by bicycle, and by underground. And I\nhad lots of friends Wartime friends, English friends, English friends from cadet\nschool. I had some with whom I corresponded for years afterwards and the\nAugust 7, 1998\ncorrespondence only ended because they died. I had a brilliant friend who wrote me\nsheafs of letters, all not about news, but about philosophical observations. I have\nkept them all. I \u2014 I find that \u2014 well, the Latin proverb, Ubi bene ibi patria. Where\nI\u2019m well, there is my country, applies to some extent. I could live in England\neasily, but I could live anywhere unless the system of the country were such that I\ncould not stomach it. I have a reluctance to visit countries in my travels where there\nis the juxtaposition of luxurious wealth and abject poverty, which has kept me away\nfrom China, from India and many other countries. I-It is perhaps a \u2014a\u2014a-\u2014an\nostrich policy of simply not wanting to see it, but I find it distressing. I would say it\nincludes Mexico. I\u2019ve been to Mexico once to a Club Med and I don\u2019t think Pll go\nthere again. I-It\u2019s not my thing. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I find that postwar England, I \u2014 I\n\u2014 I never really worked in England, other than on a farm as a boy, which did me a\nlot of good, and briefly on being released from internment \u2014 I did not go from\ninternment into the army, I went from internment to being released, forgotten out\nmomentarily, and then into the army, when I was old enough. I \u2014 I worked for a\nPolish publisher, and I was nothing. I mean, I was a gopher. And I have therefore,\nno work experience in England that could be called a work experience. The \u2014 the\nthing about the bacon and eggs picture turned me off rather solidly. Whether I\nwould have gotten into my profession, I would imagine I would. I don\u2019t know how\nit would have worked. I\u2019m \u2014 I can\u2019t, I really don\u2019t know. In this country there was a\nAugust 7, 1998\ncertain realization, that if you have any talents at all, there is someone somewhere to\nwhom those talents are worth money, and they are willing to pay for it. They might\nbe willing to pay as little as possible, but on the other hand, if you are reasonably\nalert and if you are willing to go where it\u2019s at \u2014 which is something that almost no\nother country seems to have. I mean, I can\u2019t picture people doing what people in\nthis country have been doing for a couple of generations, that is the economic\nsituation in our town is bad, so we put everybody in the car and drive to a state\nwhere I understand you can get a job. People ga \u2014 actually do that. They don\u2019t do it\nelsewhere. And most of all, I realize that in this country, if something bothers you\nand you are willing to spend some time trying to remedy it \u2014 1t needn\u2019t be a very\npolitical thing, it can be the bumps on the street, or \u2014 or the speed limit, or whether\nyour school needs an addition. You don\u2019t have to \u2014 to \u2014 to give up your job to \u2014 to\npursue this. You work on in a little bit and then get together with a few people who\nare like-minded. And in your own lifetime \u2014 even in \u2014 within the next few years,\nsomething actually starts to happen. Sometimes too fast. I come back to the bumps\nwhere they \u2014 they want the bumps in, then now they want the bumps out. And when\nthey\u2019re out they will want them in again. You know, I mean, and \u2014 and \u2014 and that\nactually happens, at great expense and with a big effort. But you try and do that in\nsome other country, and you know what\u2019s gonna happen? Nothing is gonna happen.\nMaybe it\u2019s changing a little, slowly now, and there are things happening here and\nAugust 7, 1998\nthere. But by and large, you run your head up against a wall, and the wall, the base\nof the wall is littered with the bleached bones of people who have tried before you,\nand some of them were good people, but they failed. Well, that\u2019s a big\ndiscouragement to run your head against the wall. I have participated in some of\nthese things in this country. Got an addition built at the elementary school where\nmy children went, which actually came into use while the youngest one was still\nthere. You know, I mean, unheard of in \u2014 in \u2014 1n other countries. Doesn\u2019t \u2014 doesn\u2019t\nhappen, doesn\u2019t happen. So I find it enormously refreshing, and you can take some\nof the other things in your stride a little bit if you know that on the other hand, this\nexists.",
        "A: I first g \u2014 my \u2014 my wife arranged that I should see a man who was himself a n \u2014\na German refugee, and he re \u2014 had a small public relations agency, that was a new\nprofession. And he would steer me to where I might get a job as a graphic designer.\nWell, I went to see him, and he decided to employ me. In some \u2014 in many respects\nthat was a disaster. It was a very small firm, of more heads than employees. And the\nattitude was rather peculiar. I was now the art director and the art department all in\nAugust 7, 1998\none, and we didn\u2019t have many jobs to do. Through family connections he got an\nassignment where I \u2014 where there were to be free full page, full color ads in\n\u201cHK squire\u201d magazine. I had never done anything like it, and neither had anybody\nelse there. So it was my assignment. I not only designed them, I wrote them, I\nsupervised the photography, I went into unbelievable acrobatics. And they came\nout, for those times, pretty well. One of the partners suggested that I be given a\nbonus, because I think I earned 30 dollars a week. The big boss said, he is an artist\nand he had the fun of doing it, it\u2019s a bad idea to give him a bonus. And they didn\u2019t.\nThis kind of attitude made it a little difficult. I-It was in everything. I mean, if we\ndid get money for this, there\u2019s no doubt we did, he would buy a new oriental rug for\nthe office. And I designed a shiny brass nameplate for downstairs on\n[indecipherable] street where we were \u2014 had a \u2014 had a upstairs office with a three-\ndimensional logo which I had designed in the \u2014 custom made in brass. I mean, we\nwere really going for it, and everybody had their own hand-engraved business card,\nand \u2014 which we really couldn\u2019t afford, you know? And \u2014 and the \u2014 well, we went to\na meeting for \u2014 with \u2014 with some corporate association, and I discovered the thing I\nmentioned elsewhere in \u2014 in other connections, and that is that nobody was saying\nanything, and we were to sell these people on why we wanted to do this. So I spoke\nup and I said, here\u2019s what we need to do. We actually did a brochure for them. That\nwas unprecedented, and \u2014 and 1-1t wouldn\u2019t have happened if I hadn\u2019t sold them on\nAugust 7, 1998\nthe concept, because it was way out modern for them at that time, you know. Well,\nultimately everybody quit, and I was the sole employee. The boss took a job with\nthe government and said, don\u2019t ever call me there unless there\u2019s an utter emergency.\nAnd then he said, I see here an advertisement that the Pentagon is \u2014 wants to retain\nan agent, an advertising agency for the army. So why don\u2019t you go and bid on that.\nMe. And I said, you know, tha-that\u2019s a bit absurd, because they are looking for a big\ncorporation to handle this. Never mind, you do as you\u2019re told. I went to the\nPentagon and to this room full of colonels and what have you and advertising\nagencies from all over the country. And the colonel who made the opening speech\nsaid any firm whose business would be doubled by this account 1s disqualified.\nObviously it didn\u2019t want small time people. I knew my boss so I stayed til the end\nof the talk and I came back and I said, we are disqualified because of this\nstipulation. And he said why? And I said, because if your business is doubled. He\nsaid, well, it would do much more than double our business, so we are all right. And\nhe was absolutely ser-serious, you see. So I\u2014 I \u2014 he filled out the forms, I filled out\nthe forms and he sent them in. I was still the only employee. After awhile there was\n\u2014 the door rang one day \u2014 doorbell rang and it was a team to evaluate our facilities.\nThat was rather difficult for me, but I had been trained to improvise, and I said\nseveral people are on assignment with [indecipherable] and several people are on\nvacation, and right at this moment I am the only person here just for this next hour\nAugust 7, 1998\nor so. Would you rather come back another time, or what? And they said, perhaps\nwe should. And there were lots of empty desks and the place was very elegant, with\nthe oriental rug and all the other stuff. And they left, and I called the boss at work in\ngovernment. I told you never to call me. I said, well, I think this is an emergency.\nThese guys might come back any time, I \u2014 they \u2014 they don\u2019t \u2014 I tried to pin them\ndown, but they said they come for random inspection. And he said, I\u2019m coming\nover. And he came and he said, you know, in \u2014 we \u2014 we have to do something. And\nhe said, I just crossed Lafayette Park. We could take some of the bums from the\nbenches, and some of them are your size and some of them are mine, and could\ndress them up and sh \u2014 have them \u2014 give them a shave and they could be sitting at\nthe desks when these pe \u2014 if \u2014 if only we knew when they are coming again. I \u2014 I\nsaid, you know, I \u2014 I don\u2019t think that that\u2019Il work. He was deadly serious. Well, a\nshort while later, he had the account of an African nation, and who was doing it? I.\nWe had a newsletter. I had absolutely no material for the newsletter, but I went to\nthe ambassador and interviewed him, and I went to look at the postage stamps of the\ncountry, and there \u2014 there were some animals that were indigenous only to that\ncountry, so I went to the zoo and talked to the director about whether he had any of\nthese specimen, and he did, and I had a photographer and I took pictures in the zoo,\nand pictures of the stamps and I got a congratulatory letter from a philatelist at the\nSmithsonian saying I wish more people were doing this. He didn\u2019t know I was\nAugust 7, 1998\ndoing it out of desperation, you see. And then the boss was invited for the\ninauguration of the president in that country, and he went, and was decorated. And I\nsaid, be sure to keep me informed so I can write the newsletter that should get to the\nguests before they go \u2014 all go home. And he said he would, and he sent me nothing.\nAnd I was getting progressively more desperate because I felt duty-bound to do this\nand I called his wife. And I said, is he writing to you? And she said yes. I said, can I\nsee the letters? She said no, they are rather private. I said, cross out the private\nthings and \u2014 and I \u2014I have to have something of what\u2019s going on. Didn't get\nanything. I finally took \u2014 fished out accounts of the first inauguration. This was a\nre-Inauguration of a second term president, and I wrote as if somebody had been\nthere, and if it described the \u2014 the women\u2019s dresses in general terms, I described the\nwomen\u2019s dresses in general terms. And I \u2014 I \u2014 I just winged the whole thing and \u2014\nand showed pictures of the previous inauguration. And I had it all just about done,\nwith each story on one desk and now all I had to do is assemble it, and he came\nback and he said, the place 1s in an awful mess. And I said mess? The mess is each\ndesk, since nobody sits at the desks, it\u2019s one story. It\u2019s perfectly organized, I \u2014 it\u2019s\nthe only way I can get this thing out in time. And he said, first we\u2019re going to get\nthe place shipshape. I said, you touch one of these stories, I\u2014 I\u2019m out of here. He\ntouched the stories, and I quit. And then he wanted to pay me to come back to put\nout the issue, and so I \u2014 but I mean, for the swan song, but I wa \u2014 you know, there\nAugust 7, 1998\nwas simply no way. So I called all the people who had quit before, half a dozen and\none of them was working for channel nine television. And he said, how would you\nlike to be a television art director? I said, well there\u2019s one catch, I know nothing\nabout television. He said, neither does anybody else, it\u2019s new. Why don\u2019t you come\non out, I can\u2019t promise anything, but we\u2019ll see. I went out and I was television art\ndirector, and it was lots of fun. Pioneers, you know. Never before. Live television.\nWe did fantastic things. We had more courage than good sense. We \u2014 we \u2014 we did\nspectacular things, we got \u2014 and being Washington we did network things, and I-I\ndid presidential broadcasts for several presidents, some at the White House, some in\nthe studio. I \u2014 then \u2014 then CBS did a survey and discovered that the country was\nread for country music. I think the survey meant Simon and Garfunkel, but they\ndidn\u2019t understand that, and so we got Jimmy Dean. And we did the Jimmy Dean\nshow, network, and I had a ball. I had a free hand to do what I like. I did a network\nmusical every week. It meant not sleeping for one night, working clean acro \u2014\naround the clock. And for couple of adjacent night, if we got home by two or three\nin the morning, we were doing well. And I decided I had to make a move\nfinancially, so I went to the management, which was as autocratic as they come, and\nI said, you are not charging enough for my services. That was the approach. And\nthey said, how much should we be charging? I said, well first of all, \u2019'd like to have\na percentage, like all the other talent is getting. Oh really, how much do you have in\nAugust 7, 1998\nmind? So I\u2014 my wife and I had a long session over the weekend, because if I said\nthe right amount, they would cut it in half. If I said too much they would laugh and\nfire me. If I said not enough, they would accept it. So I had to say too much, but just\nenough too much that by cutting it back 1t would be reasonable. And that actually\nworked. And it was based on the premise that the role of Washington television\nwould increase. I was much more optimistic than they were, and I was right. The\ntrouble was when I didn\u2019t get any sleep any more, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t have time to\nbill, so that my bills were accumulations of several weeks. And that meant the\ncheck was large, and that meant the person who had to sign the check was signing a\ncheck that was bigger than his. It wasn\u2019t really bigger than his, but it was by the fact\nthat it was several weeks. And that irked them. So after a period of time, they said,\nwe are going to terminate this agreement. And I said, and what? And they said,\nwe ll \u2014 we\u2019ll see that you are all right. Well, seeing that was \u2014 I was all right was a\nludicrous joke compared to what I\u2019d been earning. So I said, I don\u2019t know whether\nthat is acceptable. So they said, do you want to see the president, whom we could\nnever see. I met him in the elevator and usually told him what \u2014 what \u2014 what I \u2014\nwhat I needed and he would support me, because I was an asset. This time they\nwere waiting. You want to see the president? Sure. I walked in and he was \u2014 you\nknow, it was the days of having no desk and a long settee and he was sitting on the\narmrest with his feet up on the settee and said, sit down. I was sitting 12 foot away\nAugust 7, 1998\non the long settee. And he said, can we help you to relocate? And I said, I \u2014 I think\nPll manage. And in the meantime they offered my assistant, who was Afro-\nAmerican, my job at half the salary. And he quit and we formed a partnership, and\nwe freelanced for \u2014 after 10 years, for channel nine, really doing, if I say so myself,\nan excellent bloody job. We were way ahead of people, right to the right and left.\nSome of them even called us and said, you are giving us a hard time, you are doing\nsuch fascinating things that our management is constantly on us. We freelanced for\nanother five years, as you know, a design partnership. Now, we did work for the\nother networks. We did the [indecipherable] orbital launch for ABC, we did the\ninaugural coverage for ABC. We are \u2014 we had been CBS. They had \u2014 they\ndeliberately prevented us from doing freelance for a few years, out of sheer malice.\nUltimately we got into a difficult situation because my partner \u2014 we were doing a \u2014\na fashion show at the Mayflower with Lyndon Johnson\u2019s daughters. And we were\nbuilding a \u2014 a\u2014 a walkway and sets and this was in Herndon, Virginia and I\u2019d\nworked there all day and I was getting very tired, and I said, can you come out and\nfinish up, and he said sure. And as he walked into the shop where we were building\nthings, a guy hit a knot on a four by four [indecipherable] his lathe, and a piece\nflew off like a shell and hit him \u2014 hit my partner over the head and he had a\nfractured skull. And he didn't want to be hospitalized in Virginia in those days. So\nhe got on the phone and arranged for his ambulance and hospitalization in the\nAugust 7, 1998\ndistrict where his sister was a nurse for a neurosurgeon. And he said, I\u2014 I have a\nfractured skull, can you come and get me? It\u2019s near Dulles airport, th-they took an\nhour before he was in that hospital. And they put in a metal plate and \u2014 and I found\nhim a lawyer, and he got enough insurance compensation to buy a couple houses on\nCapitol Hill. And talking about anti-Semitism, or anti-black or anti anything, my\nart director colleagues in Washington would sometimes take me aside and say, we\nrespect what a courageous thing you are doing. And I said, what am I doing? And\nthey said, you have a black partner. And I said, it\u2019s not because I\u2019m courageous, we\nwork well together. And they would say yes, but it can\u2019t be easy. I say, it\u2019s no\nproblem at all, we have \u2014 we have always worked together where we could work on\none piece of rush work where I start on the right and he starts on the left and we\nmeet in the middle and it looks like one piece. What more could you want? See? So\nthat was still even in the creative arts a\u2014 a-\u2014a fact that people respected me for\ndoing this. And reversely, I advertised for an assistant and one of my friends and\ncolleagues called up and said, we lost one big account, so we have to lay off a\ncouple of designers. We highly recommend so and so. He is Jewish, but he\u2019s a very\nnice guy. But he is a very nice guy. I hired him, but that still went on, you see, and\nthat\u2019s in the liberal arts. So maybe that\u2019s why my friends in England want to duck\nout from the words on the monument.\nAugust 7, 1998",
        "A: Well, it doesn\u2019t exist any more, although the boss still is there, and \u2014 and I\u2019m not\neager to give you the name, because I\u2019ve said some nasty things about him.",

        "A: This Washington CBS station, which was, at one time, owned and operated by\n\u201cThe Washington Post,\u201d but it was also Washington\u2019s CBS station and we did\noriginate it, Washington being Washington, presidential broadcasts and so forth.\nAnd I did [indecipherable] I did some at the White House with President\nEisenhower, subsequently with President Kennedy. We did a great big show at\nthe \u2014 at the Sheraton Park Hotel, which was called, Dinner with the President,\nseven cameras, prime time, with Kennedy in attendance and Johnson in\nattendance, and a cast of stars. Josh White, Hanya Holm ballet, the CBS\nsymphony orchestra. Robert Preston was the MC, the movie actor who did, you\nknow, \u201c76 Trombones,\u201d etcetera. And Josh \u2014 I said Josh White, the folk singer.\nThe Clancy brothers. These were big names at the time, and Judy Collins and \u2014\nSeptember 25, 1998\nand I did a lot of id \u2014 scenery and had to build a stage because they didn\u2019t have\none. And had to build dressing rooms downstairs. And that was quite \u2014 quite an\nexciting project, I enjoyed it thoroughly. I remember President Kennedy sitting\nthere at the table facing the stage when his alarm went off. His \u2014 his wristwatch\nalarm to tell him that he had to \u2014 only so much more time to \u2014 to stay. And he\nmade some joke about it, he was very quick with things like that. He was very\nfunny. Very, very nice event, very warm hearted. I remember they had written\nthings especially for him. There\u2019s an old American song called, \u201c\u201cWe Want No\nIrish Here,\u201d which was, you know, prejudice against the Irish immigrants. And\nthey sang that facetiously, and lots of fun. Well done, great success. So I \u2014 I af \u2014\nyou want to know what happened afterwards in \u2014 after my television years, I\nfreelanced for the other networks. I did the six orbital flight for ABC. There was\nsome scenery and some background material. I did inauguration of Kennedy for\nABC, when it snowed so hard, we had great problems because it was almost\nimpossible to get to the capital. On the way the truck broke down, and we had to\nget this show on the air. So we \u2014 we had a little pickup truck with \u2014 with \u2014 to \u2014 to\nbuild the booth at the stand facing the inauguration platform. And we called the\nAmerican Automobile Association to help us, and they said, we can\u2019t help anyone\nwho 1s not blocking traffic on the \u2014 on the parade route \u2014 on the route. So we said,\nthank you very much. And there were three of us in that pickup truck, my\nSeptember 25, 1998\nconstruction man and his assistant and I. And we pushed the truck to where it was\nblocking traffic in the inauguration route because we \u2014 we obviously had to get\nthere. And without making another phone call, a roving AAA service truck got us\nstarted and we \u2014 in \u2014 in the snow, and we made it to the capital. The next near\ndisaster was that the moisture of the snow that was melting on top of the flimsily\nconstructed booth was leaking into the booth and short circuiting the cameras. And\n\u2014 and w \u2014I mean, we an \u2014 we knew we would short circuit the cameras. Well, I \u2014\nwhen you\u2019re a television art director, one thing you know how to do is where to\nget help quickly and who is reliable to come through and so on. I mean it \u2014 this\nwas in the days of live television, 1-1t might be the sort of thing where somebody\nwanted to have a sailboat in the studio in the two hours and you would find one\nand get one into the studio in two hours. I once had a taxi pick up a chestnut man,\nyou know, who \u2014 in the street, with his little oven, roasting \u2014 there was only one in\nWashington, in New York they used to be on every corner in the winter. And I\nknew where he was and we needed him for a live show, and I had a taxi pull up\nnext to him and offer him, I think 10 bucks if he came. And h-he did, and they\nloaded his whole paraphernalia, the hot stove and we had him in the studio, you\nknow. That\u2019s how we used to do things. Well, I knew a \u2014 a construction \u2014a-\u2014a\nroofing person in \u2014 in \u2014 1n \u2014 in Virginia, and I got him out in the snow to get \u2014\nfight his way through to the capital to lay that stuff on top of the booth to keep the\nSeptember 25, 1998\nwater out. And in those days we were not pooled but this \u2014 we \u2014 I was doing ABC,\nand the people I had \u2014 used to work with was ceeb \u2014 from CBS were next door in\nthe next booth. And I went over to a man with whom I\u2019d had many skirmishes\nbecause I felt that the \u2014 the \u2014 what shall I say, the \u2014 the good of the country\npreceded our little professional skirmishes. And I said to him, Bill, your cameras\nare going to short out. And he said, oh my God, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right. What can I\ndo? And I said, I have an \u2014 I happen to have a roofing guy come who 1s laying\ninsulation on top of my booth, I\u2019Il have him lay some on top of your booth if\nyou\u2019re willing to pay him for what he is doing. He\u2019s \u2014 he won\u2019t charge you much.\nAnd he was so grateful, you know, and I\u2019m sure that that kept him \u2014 kept CBS on\nthe air for the coverage of the Kennedy inauguration. When it was over somebody\nstole all the furniture, even though to get to the booth, you had to get up a ladder.\nYou know, it was a\u2014 a rather improvised arrangement, a \u2014 a plywood nailed\ntogether to make a platform and so on. And somehow they managed to unload that\nfurniture during the night following the inauguration. And wasn\u2019t much furniture,\nbut it was a desk and whatever, you know, for the newscasters a chair and a rug,\nand it was gone. Those were the exciting days of live television, I don\u2019t think it\nquite goes on that way now. Was really wonderful. After that I did some shows for\nthe United States Information Agency, ITV, and my assistant \u2014 my \u2014 my partner\nand I did a number of shows for them which were seen all over the world, they had\nSeptember 25, 1998\nan English learning thing that we-went international and was probably seen by\nmore people than any television show ever se \u2014 as a series. And we tried to give\nthem \u2014 whe-when we came they looked rather amateurish and \u2014 and we were\nretained to do a\u2014 a f\u2014a couple of seasons, I believe, of thei \u2014 all their shows,\ninternationally seen. And we tried to make them look like network television, and\nI think we did. Politically \u2014 when I say politically, I mean professional politically,\nit was rough going. Very, very difficult to deal, because \u2014 to deal with these\npeople, because television and \u2014 and \u2014 and government don\u2019t mix easily. The\nbureaucracy 1s too \u2014 too slow, too complex, and too \u2014 frequently too f\u2014 too\nunreasonable to do things that \u2014 that need simple and quick solutions and \u2014 and w-\nwe \u2014 we managed it as best we could, but it was not altogether a happy \u2014 a happy\nsituation. They would say, for instance, we have \u2014 we need to hire additional help,\nand we haven\u2019t got the government slots, so why don\u2019t you hire them under\ncontract? And that\u2019s not altogether proper, but again, it \u2014 absolutely necessary at\ntimes, you \u2014 you \u2014 you can\u2019t get \u2014 if you can\u2019t get the work done, you can\u2019t get on\nthe air, and if you \u2014 a deadline 1s a deadline and so forth. And s \u2014 then you have to\nmake, as an outsider, decisions whether you want to do this if \u2014 if it \u20141f you can\nsee its urgency. And then, very frequently, you don\u2019t get the backup it requires to\ncontinue doing it. Like they would say, we have a person we \u2014 whom we want you\nto hire and you hire that person and recognize that this 1s a big mistake, but you\u2019re\nSeptember 25, 1998\nstuck in an in-between situation. I-It\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s not altogether a \u2014 you \u2014 you really\nhave to walk a tightrope of \u2014 of constant difficult professional ethical decisions\nhow you handle this, recognizing that the need on the one hand, downright\npatriotic need in \u2014 in the case of \u2014 I mean, they \u2014 they say they\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re not\na ministry of propaganda and I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019ll accept that, but naturally they are trying to\ntell the world about what America is doing, and to give people news that would\notherwise not have an unbiased news report of any international event. So, the\nresponsibility weighs heavily on you, and you try and do the best you can, and\nwhile you are doing it, you are being hampered by all kinds of nonsense. So that,\nas I say, is not altogether easy. After a period of time, I had \u2014 when was it? Yes, I\nworked f \u2014 I was then asked by the office of economic opportunity to work on the\nwar on poverty, President\u2019s Johnson\u2019s war on poverty. And I became its first art\ndirector. Now, for \u2014 for Sargent Shriver, President Kennedy\u2019s brother-in-law, and\nwe have been friends ever since. And that was a-again, a very fascinating\nexperience, because pa \u2014 the war on poverty was a \u2014 a thing that if you were\ninvolved in it, you were enthused to the point of \u2014 of personal dedication. I see\nimages of that time where 20 or more people \u2014 20 of us would get a mailing ready,\nand it didn\u2019t matter what rank you were, there were the top officials and \u2014 and the\nbottom officials in tennis shoes, running around tables, stuffing envelopes to get\nthe thing out that had to be out the next day. And from my point of view, I\nSeptember 25, 1998\ndesigned the image of the whole thing, the \u2014 the \u2014 the logos, the emblems, the\nvisual impact which was necessary because we had to do everything we could to\nmuster the enthusiasm of a \u2014 a \u2014 a nation that was not always enthusiastic about\nthe specific things we were trying to do. If you tried to open a job corps camp\nsomewhere where you were training underprivileged youngsters, these were\nteenagers and \u2014 and people were afraid of them. They were racial \u2014 there were\nracist prejudices, where they said we don\u2019t want that next to our town, you know,\nand th-the \u2014 the kind of thing we had to try and overcome. I remember incidents\nwhere in some job corps camp young men stole a car and drove it into a station\nwagon with a family and several members of that family were killed. And the next\nday there was an outcry and the persec \u2014 across the country saying this program is\nno good. Well, it \u2014 nothing to do with the quality of the program and he would\nhave stolen the car if he had not been in the job corps presumably, and no reason\nto assume otherwise. Bu \u2014 and to \u2014 to \u2014 to then crucify the program because s-\nsomebody had deviated what was the kind of thing that we were at times up\nagainst. There were a\u2014a story possibly apic \u2014 apocryphal that went around, that\nthe mayor of a town who didn\u2019t want to have a job corps camp next to him said,\nthese are going to be the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 I \u2014 I have se \u2014 now the camp had already\nopened and he was trying to get it closed down. And the mayor said, th-the \u2014 it \u2014\nit\u2019s predominantly blacks in this program, and the official from the war on poverty\nSeptember 25, 1998\noffice of economic opportunity said, as a matter of fact, it\u2019s 50 percent white. It \u2014\nit\u2019s no \u2014 as a matter of fact, it\u2019s only 50 percent black. And the mayor responded,\nwell, you see, if it were 50 percent white, that would make it all right. Which, as I\nsay, possibly apocryphally illustrates y \u2014 the absurdity of the prejudice. The \u2014 then\nthere was this \u2014 a s \u2014 a sudden solution for some of our problems because some\nbrilliant mind, probably Sargent Shriver invented Head Start. Head Start being\na preschool program when children are perceived to be cute and \u2014 and little, and\nnot a threat. And yet, in and of itself a most useful thing because the learning\nprocess should start pre school, as I think we have all come to realize. And that\nwas started with a tea at the White House. It was inaugurated and announced, and\n\u2014 and I designed its \u2014 its \u2014 its logo and so on of a couple of building blocks,\nsymbolically. Lady Bird Johnson officiated at this opening, of which I had like\ntwo days notice, and it\u2019s still in existence now. And I just had a letter from Sarge\nShriver about it, because I wrote a short article about how we \u2014 we \u2014 the obstacle\ncourse of getting that logo in to the White House tea in \u2014 with \u2014 with no advance\nnotice. And it was not without problems, because one of the things the legislation\nhad said was, the maximum feasible participation of the poor. And it was not easy\nto get \u2014 to recruit poor people who understood the state of the art methodology of\ndealing with pre-school children, because many of them had themselves been\ntreated very casually, or neglected in their own preschool period or \u2014 and later.\nSeptember 25, 1998\nAnd to then put them into a responsible positions to do it in such a way as not to\ndamage the preschool children was \u2014 was not \u2014 well, it was quite a problem. Still,\nmuch good was done over a difficult course. I worked for them for \u2014 for 10 years.\nIt started in a real f \u2014 peculiar way. I mean, they had asked me to \u2014 to help, and I\ncame as a volunteer, and then they wanted more help, and more help. And I said,\nlisten, you guys, I can\u2019t spend all my time here, I have to make a living. And they\nsaid, do you want to do it as an outside person, or as a staff person? Well, having\nhad the experience with USA television, where as an outside person I found it\nterribly hard, I said staff. And they said, well, what would it take to hire you? And\nI s\u2014mind you, I had really believed when I was first asked to do pro bono\ncontributions that a-all the people working for this program were volunteers and it\nturned out that all of them were staff and I was a volunteer. So I became a staff\nperson. And I remember in the beginning of my being a staff person, which meant\nsomebody gave me a desk and a telephone, you know, and everything else was\nimprovisation in the beginning, there was a writer who shared my office, as did\nindeed, five writers. But this particular one told me of his hardship that he was\ndoing this as volunteer work and he hoped to get a job eventually, and that his\nchildren were hungry and neighbors were looking after them and so forth. And I\nsaid, you have to \u2014 you know, they are all so busy with what they are doing, they\nare not thinking of you and me. And I had to go and say, look, fish or cut bait.\nSeptember 25, 1998\nEither you \u2014 or I can\u2019t come as much as you want me to come and work. And then\nthey gave me a job. And he said, darn it, I\u2019m gonna do it. And he walked down to\npersonnel and never came back. He had told them to hire him more or not and they\nsaid not. So e-e \u2014 these were rough days. I mean, you never knew what was going\nto \u2014 what was going to happen next. And \u2014 and we moved from place to place into\nimprovised offices. And at the \u2014 at the times Shriver had two jobs, Peace Corps\nand poverty program and so on. But we did an enormous amount of good, I am\nquite convinced that some of the \u2014 the enthusiasm that was mustered, of you \u2014\nyou\u2019ve never seen government offices like that where people are really \u2014 I mean,\nthey would work into the night and through the night for nothing, to get things out,\nget things done. It was a marvelous experience. Of course, there came the time 10\nyears later when the administration changed and the new one decided that there\nwas no more poverty in the United States, along with many other myth, you\nknow, I mean the \u2014 the perception that poverty is priv \u2014 predominantly Afro-\nAmerican is quite false. It is by no means that. It 1s, percentage-wise there are poor\n\u2014 poor whites in \u2014 in \u2014 in Appalachia and \u2014 and not only in Appalachia. Because\nof the migration to the cities to find jobs for the \u2014 from \u2014 from the rural\ncommunities, and then the disillusionment when there aren\u2019t enough jobs, and\nliving in city slums and so on, this 1s a syndrome that 1s true across the country. It\nis probably better now than it has been, which doesn\u2019t mean its \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it\u2019s good.\nSeptember 25, 1998\nBut the awareness was, I think initiated \u2014 well, I don\u2019t want \u2014 I \u2014 I wanted to say\nby \u2014 by this program and \u2014 and it\u2019s not quite true, because of course, Roosevelt\nbefore has done \u2014 had done tremendous work. But that had begun to perhaps\ndissipate a bit, until it was revived by \u2014 by Johnson, who \u2014 who knew what it was\nlike to be poor.",
        "A: Yeah, well, let\u2019s see, time frame. I worked for the Office of Economic\nOpportunity from October \u201964 to August \u201974, 10 years roughly. And then when \u2014\nwhen there was supposedly no more poverty, we were dispersed and I was sent to\nthe General Services Administration, which many perceived to be a fate worse\nthan death. But by that time, having been in government for 10 years, I had\ninevitably become involved in some other battles, which is to make the\ngovernment look better, which I think is terribly important. The government \u2014 you\nknow, we \u2014 we tend to be cynical about what the government does, and the\ngovernment does some things extremely well. Extremely well. And hides its \u2014 its\nlight under a bushel, where \u2014 where you don\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t see what \u2014 how well\nthey are doing certain things. I was al \u2014 I-I\u2019m not saying this is true of \u2014 of every\naspect, but it\u2019s true of many of their functions. I remember when a \u2014 a thing was\nintroduced in the general service administration, where \u2014 to help citizens with\nquestions about government, which if you\u2019ve ever tried it by yourself, can be very,\nSeptember 25, 1998\nvery difficult. You call up and they say that\u2019s not in my job description, or the \u2014\nyou \u2014 you \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2014 doesn\u2019t belong here and it belongs over there and then you \u2014\nyou have a sheet of paper in front of you full of telephone numbers going down as\nyou\u2019re being referred from one place to the other. Well, we in the General Service\nAdministration at that time set out to \u2014 to \u2014 to end this kind of irritating obstacle\ncourse. And we had a \u2014 an \u2014 an office specializing in giving you the right answer\nand steering you the right way. And I was skeptical that this would work. So I\ncalled them up. They couldn\u2019t tell that I was calling from the same building, you\nknow, and I asked \u2014 I\u2014 I got a young Afro-American woman on the phone, and I\nasked her a question which I knew she could not possibly know the answer, it was\na complex question that required some research. And sh \u2014 she said, I\u2019m sorry, I\ncan\u2019t answer this right away. I will call you in half an hour with the answer. And I\nsaid, thank you very much, and I so \u2014 said to myself, yeah sure. In about 27\nminutes she called me up with the right answer. Now, I was absolutely bowled\nover, because it \u2014 believe me, it was a difficult, tough question that she had to\nresearch and she did it with no complaints, no fuss. I was very impressed. Tha \u2014\ntha \u2014 I hesitate to say that I believe the program no longer exists, and I wonder\nhow easy it is now to get information. But it was a move in the right direction.\nWhen I say I\u2019m not sure it exists, I learned another big lesson 1-1-in \u2014 in \u2014 in\ngovernment, and that is, I thought, when we had real progress, like by the poverty\nSeptember 25, 1998\nprogram, visible progress, or with an invention such as this answering of citizen\u2019s\nproblems, you know, that there was no going back, that you could not \u2014 that no\nfuture administration would be foolish enough to go back to where, you know, it\nwould continue to move forward. That\u2019s not true. They are not only going back at\n\u2014 to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to square one, they go to 50 years before square one, and there\u2019s\nsome common syndromes that I came to observe. For instance, a person fro \u2014\nappointed politically, either party, doesn\u2019t make any difference, to some office and\nheads maybe a department, maybe a division. Even smaller sub-units. You get the\nimpression that the first thing they want to do is to write a letter home to mom to\nsay I\u2019m not at the feet of the president, I have his ear. And whether they want to\ninvent a new identity for this particular department, division, whatever, regardless\nthat it\u2019s part of a bigger thing, the government, or if you want to go one step down,\nof \u2014 of \u2014 of one of the agencies of the government, 1t doesn\u2019t matter, they want\ntheir own identity. So they \u2014 for \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m speaking as a visual person. So all of\na sudden you have all these things spring up, and their taste generally runs to the\n19\" century, and not the 20\" because they haven\u2019t heard of what things look like\nin the 20\" century. But I\u2019m \u2014 when I\u2019m speaking visually, believe me that\u2019s\nsymbolic of everything else, they \u2014 they tend to hark back to something they ha \u2014\nheard of how things are, where, and they want to imitate, and since they are not\nnecessarily chosen for being innovators, they tend to retard the pro \u2014 the progress\nSeptember 25, 1998\nand go back to, before it was when it was already outmoded. Well, that\u2019s how it is.\nSo one has to be constantly alert, to keep things going forward. And people get\nreally doing that at times. So \u2014 and I\u2019m not even mentioning politics, I\u2019m\nmentioning simply the bureaucratic process, which is unavoidable to \u2014 s-so it\nwould seem, because innovators who are capable of not that common a specimen.\nWell, after many a fight, some of which I\u2019ve won, I di \u2014 for instance, I designed\nthe building signs in the federal triangle that you still see where the newscasters\nstand in front of the thing that says Department of Justice, or U.S. Department of\nAgriculture, whatever. They are these vertical standing brownish colored things\nwith very clear lettering, with a little bulge forward so you can read the title. And\nthey are made of reinforced fiberglass. And I had to get those accepted by the fine\narts commission. They were supposedly supposed to be a pilot program for all of\nWashington and then the whole country. The federal triangle being the\nexperimental area. When I \u2014 when I presented it to the fine arts commission, they\nsaid, how long are these signs good for? And I said \u2014 I was about to say, oh, state\nof the art, they last long time, when Carter Brown, who was the chairman of the\nfine arts commission anticipated that and said, what we are afraid of is that they\nwill last too long, because after 10 years our tastes will have changed and we\u2019ll get\ntired of looking at them, and they won\u2019t give us any money to do new ones if\nthey\u2019re still good. So I said, they will last exactly 10 years. And two things\nSeptember 25, 1998\nhappened. One, they are still there after, I think, what is it? 25 years. And they are\ngetting shabby, and still they are not replacing them. And secondly, it never\nhappened that they were \u2014 that they were done all over th-the \u2014 the town, or all\nover the country. A few were done by the initiative of some agencies here and\nthere, but never beyond that. I-It just \u2014 not because they didn\u2019t like them, not\nbecause they weren\u2019t good, they just didn\u2019t get around to it, to it \u2014 it doesn\u2019t\nfollow if something is efficient and works that this plan \u2014 that this plan will be\npermitted.",
        "A: Yes. The \u2014 when \u2014 \u201974 \u2014I\u2019d gone slightly beyond that \u2014 was when the Office\nof Economic Opportunity ceased to exist and I was transferred to the General\nService Administration and I had said that I had, by now, become a fighter for\nmaking the government look better to the s \u2014 to the citizen. And to try and\nintroduce some, at least semblance of the 20\" century while it lasted, to the\ngeneral population. Whereas everything tended to be done backwards, visually, I\nmean, a government department. When I did the signs in the federal triangle, I had\nSeptember 25, 1998\nto find a sign that would be compatible with the earlier tendency to make a\ngovernment office look like a Greek temple, because why? A Greek temple is \u2014 is\nold and solid, and the government, like banks, built like Greek temples, as we used\nto do, were deemed to be more solid if they looked like a Greek temple. Well then\ncame the \u2014 the craving for modernity, and we got the kind of new deal architecture\nof an empty \u2014 beginnings of the influences of Bauhaus in \u2014 in \u2014 in style. And that\nin turn led to a degree of Bauhaus fatigue. That you didn\u2019t want plain boxes that\nwere functional. The idea of \u2014 of the Bauhaus being that if it\u2019s functional and \u2014\nand \u2014 and simple, and 1-1 \u2014 and efficient, it 1s beautiful, and it does not require\ndecoration. And I was brought up with that in art school, that simple, if it\u2019s\nfunctional, it\u2019s beautiful, okay? Now look what\u2019s happened since. We \u2014 because of\nthe \u2014 what I call the Bauhaus fatigue, we started with arbitrary and often ugly\ndecora \u2014 over decoration. We had put flying buttresses onto buildings as a sort of\nharking back to when we were building thi \u2014 Greek temples. And in post-modern\nyou see arbitrary archways that lead nowhere, attached to buildings as \u2014 as\ndecoration. And \u2014 a-and th-the answer, if any \u2014 no \u2014 I\u2014I-\u2014I\u2019m not suggesting\nthere is an answer, the answer is that no matter what we have, the only constant\nthing is \u2014 is change. We are going to go to something else, because you want\nsomething else, and it doesn\u2019t mean that it is necessarily better than its\npredecessor. That would be nice, and \u2014 but again, like I was saying about \u2014 a-\nSeptember 25, 1998\nabout progress in government, I \u2014 you mustn\u2019t accept the notion that because the\nultimate has been achieved, that it will therefore stay in \u2014 in \u2014 even in its \u2014 in its\ndegree of quality. This is true in the arts. It\u2014 one could make one heck of an\nargument of saying that beyond Beethoven, you know, maybe we should have\nstopped there. Well, that\u2019s not fair, because look at some of the great things that\nhave come to us since then. Whether they are better than the classic, the role\nmodels, is \u2014 1s arguable. Another thing is that \u2014 that today\u2019s art modern is\ntomorrow\u2019s classic. We had been talking before about the Beatles, Elvis Presley,\nand some of us were shocked when they came on the scene. And some of us now\nlook upon these manifestations as classical, compared to hard rock, compared to\nwhere we are now. We are nostalgic for the Beatles and for Elvis Presley. You\nsee? And it\u2019s amazing how you can apply this formula to all kinds of completely\ndifferent things, as I have just done, and I can go beyond that, it is in \u2014 in the ci \u2014\nCivil Rights Movement, which I embraced with great enthusiasm, having just been\nthrough six years of war to f\u2014 to fight against racism. And I would have\narguments with people on all sides. I\u2019'd have arguments with some of my Afro-\nAmerican friends who would say ha \u2014 I had an Afro-American partner with whom\nI had va \u2014 hardly any arguments, we were on the same wavelengths. But with\nsome of them who said that the persecution of Afro-Americans was as bad as the\nHolocaust, and I would say th ho \u2014 ho \u2014 hold it, hold it right there.\nSeptember 25, 1998\n[indecipherable] I will agree with one thing, that if \u2014 1f you are running away\nfrom a lynch mob, it probably doesn\u2019t make any difference whether you\u2019re\nrunning from the Holocaust or from the lynch mob. But, apart from that, the\nnotion that there is a federal program for your extermination and murder is\ndifferent than even the collusion and permissiveness of a government that allows\nlynch mobs. That \u2014 this is not an advocacy of lynch mobs, obviously, but \u2014 but the\npoint is, the idea that it was legislated to murder everybody. Men, women,\nchildren, old people, whatever, 1s unique. And therefore, the comparison does not\nhold, okay? I remember that when I was in t \u2014 in television, and my Afro-\nAmerican assistant, who later became my partner when we both quit, wa \u2014 there\nwas one sort of greasy spoon restaurant owned by a Greek man on the corner. The\nonly place you could eat outside, before we had a cafeteria. Well, sometimes\nsomebody would say, let\u2019s talk about next week\u2019s show over lunch at Frank\u2019s,\nthat restaurant. And that meant that I would have to go, and my assistant could not\ngo because of being Afro-American, they didn\u2019t serve black people in the\nrestaurant. Which was embarrassing for me. I could either say let\u2019s not eat, which\nI wasn't always e-empowered to say, depending on who wanted to eat where and\nwhen. Mind you, they would sell my partner Joe sandwiches to take out. There\nwas aS \u2014 back counter, and he would sometimes have to do that, because he \u2014 he \u2014\nhe \u2014 well, I don\u2019t know, he didn\u2019t have time to have a sandwich prepared at home\nSeptember 25, 1998\n\u2014 have to eat. And we worked around the clock often, you know, so I mean \u2014 came\nthe Civil Rights Act in the 60s and I said, Joe, are you gonna eat at Frank\u2019s? And\nhe said, I been thinking about that. And I said, well, I can see both sides of the\nargument. Why should you take your custom to a place that wouldn\u2019t serve you?\nIn fact, the waitress, when the Civil Rights Act was passed, told me at the meeting\nthat they \u2014 I think I\u2019m going to quit because we are going to have to serve niggers.\nAnd I made some remark saying, well I think it\u2019s time that that act was passed,\nyou know. Well, Joe said, on the other hand, if I don\u2019t go in to eat at Joe\u2019s, what\nwas the point of getting the Civil Rights Act? So he said, I think I will. On the\nother hand, he said, I will fully understand if some of my race do not go in to eat\nin restaurants that were segregated until yesterday, because \u2014 and here comes the\nimportant sentence \u2014 not everybody can be a pioneer. And I think that\u2019s true. I\nthink that there are people who are willing to fight and to be confrontational, and\ntell people, who say I\u2014I-\u2014I don\u2019t think I\u2019m up to that. And you can try and \u2014 and\n\u2014 and \u2014 and influence people, but basically it is also true that some people are\npioneers and some people are not. You need the pioneers and you must accept that\nthere are some people who are not. So, when we got into subsequent discussions, I\nremember some people I considered racist in the poverty program, saying, you\nknow, we\u2019d come out of the building from work and there would be some news\nheadlines out in the street, and they would say that Stokey Carmichael, or Rap\nSeptember 25, 1998\nBrown, aren\u2019t they awful troublemakers, what have you. Now, Martin Luther\nKing, that\u2019s a different proposition. And I said, aren\u2019t you forgetting that that\u2019s\nhow you looked at Martin, until the more extreme Stokey Carmichaels and Rap\nBrown came on the scene, by which the \u2014 yesterdays revolutionary becomes the\nclassicist, just like we were saying in the arts, or in other things, you see? They \u2014\nthe extreme of today makes the extreme of yesterday the conservative. In fact,\nsometimes pathetically so. And \u2014 and that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s how \u2014 ho-how that played,\nand it was an ongoing \u2014 an ongoing discussion, and I feel that it has progressed.\nBut one thing we learned in the poverty program is that we were trying to redress\npast wrongs. If you ask the redressee, have we redressed wrongs enough, the\nanswer is inevitably that we have barely scratched the surface. That leads to\nsomeone wanting to put on the brakes, if only for political reasons, because if you\nare doing something that is unpopular with the general public because they say\nyou are redressing too much, and unpopular with the redressees, because they say\nyou are not redressing enough, you are losing on both sides. You are losing\npolitically and you are losing the things you are setting out to do. So, you have a\nvery, very, very serious problem, and you inevitably begin to repress a bit together\nwith redressing. In other words, when you put the brakes on redressing wrongs,\nyou are repressing th-the people. By that I mean you are denying them some of the\nredressing they would like to have, because they \u2014 you \u2014 you can\u2019t do as much as\nSeptember 25, 1998\nthey want you to do. So, this \u2014 the rather delicate balance between redressing and\nrepressing \u2014 and by repressing I don\u2019t mean any \u2014 any acts of \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of\nkeeping somebody down, I\u2019m merely calling it the insufficient redressing which is\nperceived as repression, all right? So when you do this \u2014 this \u2014 this delicate\nbalance. You come to the point where it\u2019s almost impossible to walk the tightrope\nand your political opponents will scream bloody murder that you are redressing\ntoo much. And then you have protesters outside your building saying you are not\nredressing enough. Now, Shriver had a great talent for this, he would go down on\nthe sidewalk to the protesters, invite them to his office and sit down with them and\nreason with them. His successors barricaded themselves in the building, stopped\nthe elevator service, which again illustrates the misconception that things that\nmove forward continue to move forward, they don\u2019t. Well, I found that 1-1n \u2014 in\nsome ways progression continues to progress, perhaps. An example that comes to\nmind is anti-Semitism which probably belongs here. When I first came to this\ncountry and \u2014 1n \u2014 in \u2014 in the \u2014 the end of the 40s, the beaches around\nWashington had signs saying Gentiles only. Not whites only, Gentiles only. And\nit was in \u2014 understood without saying that that meant white Gentiles, okay? And\nthere was Father Coughlin and there was Bilbo up on the hill spouting anti-\nSemitism and the likes of which we have mercifully forgotten, how blatant and \u2014\nand \u2014 and crude that anti-sin \u2014 Semitism wa \u2014 seemed acceptable on the floor of\nSeptember 25, 1998\nthe house. Now, shall we say that has become unfashionable, or deemed primitive,\nwhatever, I don\u2019t know. And I find it difficult to picture that it would return in\ntotality. Perhaps there\u2019s some elements of the extreme so-called religious right that\nwould like to revive those days. I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t admit it at this point,\nbecause as I say, it\u2019s unfashionable, and recognized to be primitive, which I think\nis a good thing. But we shouldn\u2019t delude ourselves that there aren\u2019t places where\nthe attitude exists. I find it exists in \u2014 in Europe to a \u2014 to a considerable extent,\nmore overtly than in \u2014 in the United States now. I was told yesterday by a man\nwho told me that his father was a Nazi, that there is m \u2014 that in Germany, even\nthough there is this movement of \u2014 of \u2014 of the young who \u2014 who \u2014 who abhor their\nNazi past, or the Nazi past of their parents, and this man abhors the Nazi past of\nhis father, but he says his father was unemployed, and he was an engineer and he\nwas repairing radios to make a living of sorts. And when Hitler came to power he\ngot a job as an engineer. So he thought that \u2014 he \u2014 he said, what they are doing to\nthe Jews is \u2014 that\u2019s bad, bad. But look what it has done for me. And von\nStauffenberg, who tried to assassinate Hitler 1s considered a traitor by one and\nall, by the vast majority of people. I found that shocking, I didn\u2019t know that, I\nthought \u2014 and I still believe there are segments of the people who consider him a\nresistance person. This \u2014 this man told me that there isn\u2019t a single memorial or\nmonument to Stauffenberg, because vast majority of people consider him a\nSeptember 25, 1998\ntraitor. Now, I\u2014 I\u2019ve \u2014I\u2014I find that \u2014 I mean, that came as a shock. I did not\nknow that. I thought that the disillusionment with Hitler and \u2014 and by saying\ndisillusionment I\u2019m implying that there was an illusionment before, and \u2014 and\nthere certainly was. And some of it, if you will understand the burden, like the\nman who didn\u2019t have a job that got a job, like the peculiar historic situation where\nyou have a German Reich that was 90 years old. Before that there were duchies\nand principalities of \u2014 of Munich, Saxony, whatever. Prussia. And that after\nlosing World War I, there was \u2014 first of all, it was kept intact, as opposed to the\nAustro-Hungarian empire, which was 2,000 years old and was completely\nchopped up because of the ethnic elements, all of whom had been caught in this\nthing we just mentioned about th-th-the tightrope between repression and\nredressing, because if an Austrian emperor or Austrian government tried to redress\nthe demands of the Hungarians, or the Serbs, or the Czechs, it was politically\nunpopular at home and deemed insufficient by the recipients of the programs, who\nwanted out, never mind how and just sooner better than later. As indeed we are\nnow seeing in Bosnia and in all these places where small minorities, whether they\nare viable or not, completely not caring about whether they can form a viable\nentity, want to be nationalistically independent. Even the most reasonable among\nthem, and I have talked to some of the most reasonable, will say that first we must\nhave our independence and then we can attempt to confederate. In the meantime,\nSeptember 25, 1998\nthe process of getting that independence is bloody and \u2014 and destructive. And\nunreasonable. And \u2014 and there\u2019s nothing we seem to be able to do about it because\nwe don\u2019t necessarily progress. Now, in Germany, this \u2014 this relatively recent\nempire of \u2014 of \u2014 of 90 year old confederation, they yearned to be powerful again.\nUnderstandably, the Austro-Hungarians never had any dream of becoming a\npowerful empire again, because that would mean gluing together the thing where\nthe glue hadn\u2019t held, o-of \u2014 of \u2014 of ethnic minorities, you see? So they never had\nthat ambition, except perhaps in the case of some Austrians who were pan \u2014 pan-\nGerman thinkers, and thought as part of the German empire, they could see some\ngreatness again. But I wouldn\u2019t say there were many until Hitler demonstrated\nthat that dream of be \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of regaining power for this German entity could\nbe realized, in that he was immensely successful politically and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nmilitarily. And took over one country after the other, right? And if your victorious\narmies are marching into country after country with a minimum of casualties, and\nasserting themselves as \u2014 as the masters of the world, it\u2019s probably hard for the\naverage citizen not to stand and cheer at \u2014 at the sidelines, when all that\ntechnological hardware is rolling past you and \u2014 and the pageantry, at which they\nwere very good. They were very, very skilled in visual pageantry. Well, the \u2014 I see\na bridge here to something else we wanted to cover, which is Vietnam. The bridge\nis this; when the Vietnam situation started, I, after my six years of war and being\nSeptember 25, 1998\nan officer in the British army, in an elite unit, thought that that was the reasonable\nthing to do. I thought that the domino theory, which had been demonstrated by\nHitler, that is you don\u2019t stop him when he first occupies the Rhineland, then he\nwill occupy Austria, Czechoslovakia and then continue the rest of western\nEurope, all right? If you \u2014 what you should have done, clearly, was to stop him\nwhen he occupied the Rhineland. Well, the parallels seemed obvious. The big\nthreat now was communism. If they took over Vietnam and one didn\u2019t stop them\nthere, they would take over the rest of southeast Asia. And not necessarily as a\npopular movement, but as a enslaving kind of mechanism. Well, true or false,\nright? What subsequently changed my mind, not very long after, was the painful\nrealization that just before \u2014 because you are right \u2014 and even that, of course,\nbecomes \u2014 is arguable, but even if you perceive yourself to be right, you can\u2019t\nundertake things that are \u2014 that you\u2019re going to lose. It\u2019s impractical. So for\npragmatic reasons if nothing else, the idea of subduing communism in Vietnam,\nwhich turned out to be a popular nationalistic movement, if you are going to \u2014 to\nfight a losing war, the answer obviously is don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t go in the first place. That\nmeans admitting that you can\u2019t do it. And \u2014 and that takes a lot \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s\nsometimes harder to do for a head of state to say, we think we ought to be doing\nthis, but we can\u2019t. It\u2019s harder to do than to say okay, go. A-And then afterwards,\nwhen you have enormous numbers of people killed and \u2014 and maimed, there 1s, of\nSeptember 25, 1998\ncourse, no \u2014 no easy way back. You \u2014 you can\u2019t bring them back. But, in a sense,\nthose who were afraid of a domino theory had their \u2014 their fears borne out to a\nconsiderable extent. After awhile when \u2014 when \u2014 when communism itself became\nthe image of a failed methodology, the whole thing seems redundant. I mean, what\ncommunism were we afraid of? Russian communism, Chinese communism. Well,\nRussian communism as \u2014 1s \u2014 1-1s \u2014 1s gone. Chinese communism 1s\nmetamorphosing in all \u2014 into all kinds of other things. Whether we are justifiably\nafraid of that now, is really, A, it \u2014 it \u2014 it doesn\u2019t apply in the same sense as it\napplied at that time. And there were probably a couple of other factors in there. I\nthink that we are still in this country resentful of the former colonial powers,\nbecause after all, we were under British rule, and so, if the British were pushed out\nof the Persian gulf, that didn\u2019t really hurt us. I-If the French were pushed out of\nVietnam, Indochina, that \u2014 we were gonna do it better. We were gonna show\nthem that 1-1t spilt \u2014 the failure was because they were colonial powers. Well, our\ntrying to get into these things with limited experience and assume a pseudo-\ncolonial role in c \u2014 in \u2014 1n countries 1-in the Persian gulf, or in \u2014 in \u2014 1n\u20141in\nsoutheast Asia, hasn\u2019t worked out too well. And \u2014 because the world is readjusting\nitself and \u2014 and the \u2014 yesterday\u2019s methods progressed as na \u2014 as \u2014 it begins to be\nquestionable whether progress 1s progress as we perceive it. And also, it doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily go forward. It goes \u2014 I-I would think that if you asked people the \u2014 the\nSeptember 25, 1998\nacademic question whether they would prefer the Persian gulf to be as it was,\nwhich means playing footsy with the shah, who was not necessarily a democratic\nleader, we\u2019d probably happily settle for that at \u2014 at this moment, instead of what\nwe ve got. What can you do? I-It \u2014 the \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and as for the \u2014 the non-\nviable mini-states that spring up as nationalist units, the example of Slovakia\nhaving split off from Czech Republic, because they felt that they were treated like\nunderdogs, with justification. But, by themselves much less viable, and I\u2019m sure\nthat a great many of them are sorry that they split off. There 1s no visible easy way\nback to that confederation, that comes after the national thing, as I have been told,\nyou know. No easy way back. So we are \u2014 we are perpetually shooting ourselves\nin the foot all over, I mean, not you and I, but people everywhere, in their own\nsituations.\n[break]\nSeptember 25, 1998",
        "A: Well, I came, if you recall, from \u2014 from England on a Fulbright and sterling \u2014\npounds sterling were not convertible, so I had no money. And the art schools were\nnot boarding schools, so I lived at International House in New York at 500\nRiverside Drive. And that was very stimulating because there were students from\nall over, and many friends, which I maintain to this day. Some of them I haven\u2019t \u2014\nI hadn\u2019t seen in, I guess almost 50 years, but my friendships are of the nature that I\ncan pick them up any time as if there had been no time gap. We had recently been\nto Hawaii, where I had friends from International Student House whom I hadn\u2019t\nseen since. And it worked like we had never parted. I \u2014 one day, a Greek student in\nNew York who lived at the house, said let\u2019s hitchhike to Washington. I\u2019m going\nto hitchhike to Washington, anybody want to come along? I said sure. I \u2014 I\u2019ve\nnever been there, and I know somebody in Washington. Let me try and telephone\nand see whether I can arrange something. So I did what in those days was an\nunusual activity, a long distance telephone call. And I went and called\nWashington, and | had no address of the person I was looking for, who had been\nthe fianc\u00e9e of a friend of mine who was a commando colleague in \u2014 in England\nand in Normandy, we b-both went in on the same team to Normandy, and we\nwere very, very close friends. And we double dated in England. I was engaged to\nan Irish girl from northern Ireland. Have we covered that before? Well, the \u2014 his\nfianc\u00e9e was \u2014 had come out on the ch \u2014 ki \u2014 children\u2019s transport from\nSeptember 25, 1998\nCzechoslovakia and had work in London for the Czech government in exile until\nthe coup in Czechoslovakia when she lost her job. She had been alone to the\nsecond international conference, annual conference of the International Monetary\nFund, and they had offered her a job in Washington. And when she lost her job in\nLondon, she accepted the job in Washington, because why not, for a year, and\nhad \u2014 in other words, come for a year at the International Monetary Fund in\nWashington. I couldn\u2019t remember the name of the International Monetary Fund\nand I first asked th-the Washington telephone operator whether I \u2014 she had a\nlisting by name, and she didn\u2019t. So I said well, there\u2019s an organization that belongs\nto the United Nations. And she said, the United Nations are in Flushing\nMeadows, New York. And I said, I know that, but there 1s some branch, it\u2019s\ncalled the United Nations Fund, or the United Nations bank, or something. And\nshe said, sir, United Nations are in Flushing Meadows, Long Island, New York.\nAfter we\u2019d been over that a couple of times, I said, I tell you what, forget it, and I\nhung up. Obviously I wasn't going to get anywhere and I went to see the Greek\nstudent who had wanted to hitchhike to Washington, and I said, I\u2019m having\nproblems about this Washington thing, I can\u2019t reach my party. And he said, I\u2019ve\ndecided not to go. I said okay, it\u2019s off. So it didn\u2019t happen. Awhile later, Alice\nwent to London on home leave, London being her home, and met with our\nmutual friend and \u2014 and other friends from the commandos. And they said, oh,\nSeptember 25, 1998\nwhen you go back through New York, you must bring this book that is just out to\nPeter. The book was \u201cThe Green Beret,\u201d the first book about the commandos by\nHilary Saint George Saunders, a historian. And she had said, oh, Peter is in\nNew York? I didn\u2019t know that. And she brought me the book. Now, I \u2014 I have to\ngo back a moment and say that when she left for \u2014 for Washington from London,\nher fianc\u00e9 said to me, I have \u2014 he was in business already and I was in art school \u2014\nhe said, I have a shipment coming in in the docks, and I can\u2019t take off, I have to be\nthere. But you are an art student, you can take time off. Why don\u2019t you go with her\nto \u2014 whatever it was, Cooks, and help her make the arrangements? Anyone who\nknows Alice knows that she needed my help like the hole in the head. She \u2014 when\nshe worked for the International Monetary Fund, she made travel arrangements for\n60 people, and my helping her was a laugh. But I took time off and went down the\nroad to Cooks on Southampton Row, King\u2019s Way, which was five minutes from\nmy school, and gave her, as \u2014 as a matter of fact, a going away present of one of\nmy little Ashanti gold weights that I had acquired during my six months in Africa\nat the end of the war. And she brought me the book and I told her the story about\nhow I had almost come to Washington and she said, well, you must come and see\nWashington. And I said sure. And of course, having no money, I hitchhiked.\nHolland tunnel or whatever, and in those days, if you got a ride straight through it\ntook seven and a half hours, and you never got a ride straight through, so it took\nSeptember 25, 1998\n10 - 11 - 12 hours. And I would start at \u2014 after school, about four o\u2019clock, and \u2014\nand hitchhike. There was, of course, no New Jersey turnpike. There was no bridge\nover the Delaware. There was a ferry. There was no tunnel under Baltimore and\nno route 95, but route one with traffic lights and what have you. I usually hit\nBaltimore in the early hours of the morning, like two o\u2019clock a-and \u2014 and usually\non a truck which dropped me off somewhere in the harbor district. And on one\noccasion, two potential muggers followed me and in fact I \u2014 I had a suitcase and a\nportfolio to carry, so they could walk faster than I could, and they \u2014 I \u2014 I decided I\nw \u2014 I would \u2014 I would walk in the middle of the road so I wouldn\u2019t be pulled in\nanywhere, and I stopped and they came and said, at two in the morning, and asked\nme for a light. And I said, I don\u2019t smoke. Is there anything else you want? And I\nhad a metal suitcase which I held, which I was going to throw at them and run, if\nnecessary. And they decided that this was not a good proposition and they decided\nnot to \u2014 to mug me. And \u2014 but it was an unpleasant incident and looked very\nthreatening. And a \u2014 another story that comes to mind is it \u2014 one time it poured,\nand it was just before Alice\u2019s birthday and I was \u2014 I had bought her ano \u2014 a new\numbrella, and it was gift wrapped. And I carried that umbrella gift wrapped and\nwouldn\u2019t open it because I didn\u2019t want to spoil the thing, I carried it under my\njacket so it wouldn\u2019t get wet. Anyway, after hitchhiking to Washington a few\ntimes, w-we met in New York and in Washington. And in the following spring,\nSeptember 25, 1998\n1950, we were married. And Alice had arranged some interviews for me in\nWashington to find a job, and the person who was going to help me find the job\nran a small public relations agency, and he desired \u2014 he si \u2014 he decided that he\nwould hire me himself and call it public relations and advertising and I was the art\ndirector of this small outfit, and it was not an altogether positive experience. I\nthink I earned 30 dollars a week and that was low even by the standards of that\ntime. But I had quite some exposure. I did three full color ads for \u201cEsquire\u201d\nmagazine and I found that I had to solicit some of the jobs because nobody else\nseemed to be doing it and after awhile everybody quit and I was the only\nemployee. But one of them had preceded me into television and he offered me a \u2014\na job in television. We\u2019ve \u2014 may have covered that before. Anyway, in the\nmeantime, A-Alice and I had moved into a one room apartment on \u2014 on Belmont\nStreet in Washington, which was rather \u2014 rather primitive, but not \u2014 not at all bad,\nand after a period we moved downtown into an air conditioned apartment. That\nwas the height of luxury. Small one, also. And we had our first child, a daughter,\nAnne, who from a very early age wanted to do professionally exactly what I was\ndoing and \u2014 and helped me, even as a child. And got very proficient and became a\ngood graphic designer and is one to this day. Then we had a second daughter,\nKim, who also \u2014 all of them leaned in directions that I had marginally been\ninvolved in. She started to write poetry, which we have done traditionally in my\nSeptember 25, 1998\nfamily for every birthday. And of course, she went beyond that and she became a\nwriter and is at this stage a contributing editor to \u201cVanity Fair\u201d and \u201cTime\u201d\nmagazine, and is writing her second book, called tentatively, \u201cKeys to the\nKingdom,\u201d meaning Michael Eisner and the Disney operation. That\u2019s big league\nwriting, not the sort of thing that \u2014 that I\u2019m doing. Well, as \u2014 this morning, as a\nmatter of fact, in looking for a certain book, I came across the album of \u2014 of\nbirthday cards over the years, and it\u2019s quite a collection because they are both\ngraphics and \u2014 and \u2014 and at least doggerel verse, and it\u2019s a heartwarming memento\nthat I \u2014 I \u2014 I think 1-I \u2014 astonished me because I had forgotten some of them,\nthey\u2019ve been so long ago. But the tradition goes on. The tradition also goes on to\nmy third child which \u2014 Tim, a \u2014 a\u2014a son who works for the Discovery Channel as\nsenior manager of special events, and lives only five minutes from my house. And\nhe writes absolutely beautiful birthday poets \u2014 poems. Everybody knows what\nbirthday poems sound like and I sometimes wince at the bad meter and \u2014 and the\nsuggested ego trip of all of us who do this. But my daughter Kim and my son\nTim, write absolutely gorgeous ones, far better than anything I\u2019ve ever done. And\nincidentally, my children being named Anne, Kim and Tim, the last one was\nKim\u2019s idea, together with the support of her older sister. And we said, if we call\nhim Tim and we calling you \u2014 him \u2014 or we call you, you will never know which\none we are calling because it sounds alike. And she said, that\u2019s the idea. A-As you\nSeptember 25, 1998\ncan see where she comes from. Well, they\u2019re all married. Anne is married to an\narchitect and lives in Washington and has three children; David, who 1s now 11,\nSam, who is nine and Hannah who is almost six. And Kim had great trouble \u2014\nshe is married to Gary Simpson, who is in television, movies in Hollywood. She\n\u2014 Kim moved to Hollywood because she covers Hollywood. She used to work for\nthe \u201cWashington Post\u201d for many years for style, but now she doesn\u2019t work for a\npapers, she writes the book and contributes articles to those two publications. She\nhad great difficulty having a baby. She had 10 in-vitros attempting to have a baby,\nall failed. And ultimately succeeded by having a \u2014 a surrogate carry her child. The\nbaby is hers and her husband\u2019s, implanted into a surrogate, who carried it and it\u2019s\nnow a few months old, a little girl. And the \u2014 one thing that comes to mind is when\nshe and the surrogate were together in the hospital for the birth of the baby, the\nbaby cried during the night, and Kim said, the baby is crying. And the surrogate\nmother said, it\u2019s not my baby, you go and take care of it. And she has been doing\nthat happily ever since. Took some adjustment, because when you don\u2019t carry the\nbaby, the impact on your life, whe \u2014 which suddenly changes without the relief of\nnot carrying it any more is \u2014 1s quite an experience, that I hadn\u2019t really anticipated.\nBut she adjusted to it very well, and now all is going very well. And as we sit here\nand speak, Tim and his wife Laurie, who also works for Discovery cable\ntelevision, she is vice-president in charge of marketing, expect their first baby. The\nSeptember 25, 1998\nphone could ring now. I know we\u2019 ve turned them off, but even so, and she might\nbe having that baby. We don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a boy or a girl, any \u2014 any day\nnow. The \u2014 all three children, by the way, went to school in \u2014 in this area, in the\nWashington area, and all three of them didn't like high school, and wanted to get\nout as soon as possible. So, 1t was possible in the district to take, I don\u2019t know,\nEnglish four and I forget what else, math, over the summer and graduate early. All\nthree of them did that. You didn\u2019t have to be brilliant to graduate early, just had to\ntake a couple of summer courses. And they wanted to avoid the graduation\nceremony, none of them wanted to go through it, peculiarly perhaps, and all of\nthem wanted out. And all of them \u2014 each one of them did something different with\nthe year they gained by graduating a year early. Anne worked for a design studio\nbefore she went to art school. She had helped me all along. And after a period of\ngood experience, went to Pratt in \u2014 in New York, and was in many ways ahead,\nbecause she had the practical experience. And this was in a period when\npracticality was not big in the art schools. You know, they would say, design a\nlogo for \u2014 design a logo for a \u2014 an \u2014 and use \u2014 draw it on a brick. If that sounds\nabsurd, that was \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m doing this on purpose, or a cinder block, because that\nwas characteristic of the time. Practicality was not the main thing. You did things\nthat were impractical, but original, okay? It was the post-modern I talked to you\nabout before. Well, so that was how she spent her year that she gained. Kim did\nSeptember 25, 1998\nsomething entirely different. She went to visit my wife\u2019s sister in London. And in\nLondon the county council runs all kinds of courses, which are affordable and\nvery, very good. So she learned \u2014 she took courses in all the things she might want\nto be interested in later, having no idea where she was going to go. She took one in\npsychology, one in ceramics, one in Italian, one in drama, and I forget what else.\nAnd after she was through, she decided none of the above, and she became an\nEnglish major, and now it became very important at what school she was to\ncontinue. And one of my colleagues on \u2014 a very senior older person in the poetry\nprogram, had been a president of Bryn Mawr, and she \u2014 and when I talked about\nthe program said, oh Kim absolutely must go to Bryn Mawr and she took her\nthere. And there was a sort of a \u2014 it really fitted Kim like \u2014 like a glove. There is a\ntraditional Poet Laureate in Bryn Mawr who is anonymous un \u2014 and writes under\nthe name of Applebee, which was the name of the gym teacher who introduced\nhockey to schools in the United States. And Applebee is selected by the outgoing\nApplebee after submissions of sample poems. And nobody knows who it is, and\nthey write snide poems about \u2014 well, critical of \u2014 of \u2014 of the school management\nor whatever, or social gossip bu \u2014 and with \u2014 with double entendres galore. And\nKim became Applebee in her junior year, I think. And the \u2014 the \u2014 I \u2014 I even recall\nthe interview because Kim had read more books than anybody I know, and sh \u2014\nbefore she went to college. And when you go for an interview they want to see\n100September 25, 1998\nyour reading list. And she went to Cornell and they looked at her reading list,\nwhich was a \u2014 a foldout, a-a \u2014 it was so long, and said, about what we would\nexpect and that offended Kim deeply because she knew it wasn\u2019t true. It was a\nputdown, you see. And at Bryn Mawr, when she showed her reading list, the\ninterviewer put it aside after glancing at it and said yes, but what is your favorite \u2014\nwho is your favorite author? And Kim said, without hesitation, Jane Austen. And\nthe interviewer said, she is mine too, let\u2019s talk about Jane Austen. They talked for\nthree hours about Jane Austen. So there\u2019s no question she was going to go\nanywhere else. Tim used his extra year to take an internship in television, because\nhe had been interested 1n \u2014 in radio and television from being a \u2014 a toddler. In fact,\nin his house hangs a picture of him with his first phonograph when he was about\nfour years old, and he is carefully putting down the needle, and subsequently\nworked as a disc jockey for the university of dis \u2014 dis \u2014 District of Columbia\nstation. He had a program called Jazzmasters with Tim Masters. And when C-\nSpan bought the station and there was no more jazz, the hearts of all the listeners\nbled, because they were so attached to that classical jazz program. And he misses\nit. He did it for, I think 12 years, as a sideline, unpaid. But he has been in \u2014 in\nsome form of \u2014 of broadcasting all \u2014 all his life. Well, where were we? Yes, my\nwife Alice, who came for a year, stayed for 36 years. She became an\nadministrative officer, and her \u2014 by now there are few people left who remember\n101September 25, 1998\nher, but there are some, and when we go there for some function, or if we meet\nsomebody by chance, she would \u2014 was literally a legend in that organization,\nbecause having been a \u2014 a \u2014 from a children\u2019s transport, you know, and having\nbeen self reliant from an early teenage age, she was so protective of the people\nworking on the staff, that she would tell newly arrivals that the first thing they\u2019d\nhave to do 1s to start thinking of their careers in terms of security and retirement\nand so on. And very few people \u2014 very few young people think about that at all.\nAnd now there are many \u2014 there are many out there who are thanking her for her\nbeing so solicitous. And she is a most remarkable person. She is a \u2014 a \u2014 the \u2014 the\nfastest at many things that I can \u2014 that I\u2019ve ever seen. I mean, if I\u20141if we go\nshopping and I get out of the car and I can\u2019t see where she 1s, it is because she is\nalready in the house, having carried 50 percent of the bags and dinner is almost\nready. You know, that sort of thing. And she never hesitated to have a social life,\nto \u2014 to invite people, while she was working. And how \u2014 how 1s \u2014 1s \u2014 by today\u2019s\nstandards, unimaginable. And \u2014 and I \u2014 I don\u2019t think \u2014 I mean, some of my\nchildren have to have \u2014 have dinner party, what have you. But to think of the kind\nof dinner party she would have fo-for friends after she came home from work, and\nit was ready and delicious at the time when you didn\u2019t think she had hung up her\ncoat yet. It\u2019s just a very special talent. When we were recently visiting friends on\nCape Cod, we had an engagement to which we had to go, I\u2019ll come back to that\n102September 25, 1998\nlater, and we were going to have dinner afterwards, at our guests\u2019. And we had\nbeen talking about a continent-ental dessert that is \u2014 is a big favorite in central and\neastern Europe. And in central and eastern Europe it\u2019s a dessert \u2014 it\u2019s a dumpling,\neither with plums or apricots. But she has figured out that it\u2019s better with peaches,\nbecause there\u2019s more fruit and the peaches are so good 1n this country, and in \u2014\nparticularly this year, by the way. So, she said, I\u2019m going to make that for dessert.\nAnd they said, well do it afterwards, because we really have to go. And she said, it\nwon\u2019t take a minute. She had du-dumplings for five people ready while the others\nwere putting on their jackets to go to the function. And so when we came back, all\nshe had to do is put them in the water, and they were done, you know, I mean none\n\u2014 none of them could believe that she had actually accomplished that in this\nextremely narrow time span. Doesn\u2019t bother her [indecipherable]. And she has\nbecome a most valued counselor for my activities, which of course means\nparticularly the book I have written. And the reason I wrote that book is because I\nfelt that as the interest in the Holocaust and in World War II revived, people were\nwriting books and telling stories that were horrible, and in recounting their \u2014 their\nstories, and I felt that someone ought to stress the fact that not everybody went like\nsheep to the slaughter, but some of us had the fortunate opportunity to be able to\nfight back. So I \u2014 and 1n addition, I wanted to commemorate all those who were\nless lucky that I was, because a lot of my refugee friends who succeeded in ha \u2014 in\n103September 25, 1998\n\u2014 in doing special and hazardous duty, were killed or maimed or at least wounded.\nI was one of the lucky ones that came through without a scratch except a tiny\ngrenade splinter in my rear end that I threw myself in house clearing, by being a\nlittle cowboy-like \u2014 cavalier about how I tossed the grenade. Which was partly\nencouraged by the management to be a little macho. Came with the job. So, I\nwrote my first book as a septuagenarian. It took me years and years to do it,\nbecause I had no idea how one writes a book. But I\u2019d always had the inclination to\ntell stories, as you can tell from this interview. So I \u2014I first wrote \u2014 I tried to do it\nby tape recording while walking the dog when I\u2019d had a heart attack. And I \u2014 my\nchildren ga-gave \u2014 borrowed somebody\u2019s dog or something, a very ugly\nDalmatian. And I had to walk this dog twice a day, and they gave me a tape\nrecorder and they said, that way you can get your \u2014 the book you always talk\nabout, written. And I recorded while walking the dog. You can hear cars going by\nand stuff. And then I tried to get it transcribed, because I can\u2019t type. And I found\nseveral people who said they would do it, and they had two common\ndenominators. One, they were very expensive, and two, they were absolutely\nincompetent at understanding what I was saying, perhaps because of my accent,\nperhaps because there are many proper nouns in there that they were unfamil \u2014\nthat were unfamiliar to them. And I struggled. I tried to transcribe it myself, I\nfound I couldn\u2019t do it. So some friend said, you got to get yourself a word\n104September 25, 1998\nprocessor and I did. It\u2019s a very primitive machine, a word processor and the\nprinter. And I struggled to learn it and found that every now and again it would\nabsolutely balk and not do what I told it to do. So I needed to call friends to help\nme to get it going again, to jumpstart it. And I found that this happened so often,\nthat one friend wouldn\u2019t do it, I couldn\u2019t bother the same person, so I alternated\nabout three friends and called them with my emergencies, in the middle of the\nnight at times, because I couldn\u2019t stop, I had to go on. And that \u2014 that \u2014 with their\npatience and my persistence, that seemed to work. And then I talked to some\npublishers without submitting it, but I \u2014 I submitted, I think a synopsis to one in\nEngland, with whom I met and he said, you know, it doesn\u2019t all have to be true.\nAnd that finished it as far as I was concerned, because that was precisely my\npurpose, that it should all be true. H-He said, you know, faction is acceptable. And\nI \u2014 as long as you have a thrill on every page. I thought there were enough thrills\nwithout having to invent them. So we parted before we even started. And then I \u2014 I\nwent to various people for advice and some of the advice was good and some of it\nwas \u2014 was not. Some people said, you must have more dialog, some people said\nyou must have less dialog. Some people said you must be sequential. And I think\nthat\u2019s true. People want to know how it continues.\n105September 25, 1998\nvolunteer collection interview with Peter Masters. This is tape four, side B, and\nyou were telling me about your book, and the genesis of your book. Let me first\nask you, can you give me the title of your book?",
        "A: The book is called, \u201cStriking Back.\u201d I \u2014 I literally polled some of my\ncommando friends and other people for a title and they made all kinds of\nsuggestions. I can\u2019t pin down where the title ultimately came from, except perhaps\ni-in discussion between the publisher and myself, and utilizing, and re \u2014 rattling\noff all the names that have been suggested. And the publisher wrote the subtitle\nmodified from something that I suggested, namely, it\u2019s called \u201cStriking Back: A\nJewish Commandos War Against the Nazis.\u201d I wanted to say Jewish refugee\ncommandos, but they said, the word refugee has a different connotation nowadays\nand people wouldn\u2019t know what it means in this context. And besides, it\u2019s too\nlong. So there it is, a Jewish refugees war against the Nazis. And a \u2014 well, how did\nI find a publisher and be \u2014 believe me, people have asked me since, how do you\nget a book published, like I\u2019m the expert. And of course I \u2014 first time author, and I\n\u2014 what do I know\u201d? So, the \u2014 the way \u2014 the way this came about was that the\nhistorian Stephen Ambrose, who was the head of the \u2014 president of the\nEisenhower Institute in New Orleans, and professor at the University of\nLouisiana in New Orleans, and the D-Day Museum in New Orleans, called\ntogether D-Day veterans from \u2014 mostly from the U.S. forces, but some from \u2014\n106September 25, 1998\nfrom England and one from Germany. And \u2014 people who had experienced D-\nDay. And a friend in New York, Harry Nomberg(ph) called me, he was a\ncommando friend, he served under the name of Harry Drew, and he said, my wife\nand I are going, why don\u2019t you come with Alice? And we decided we\u2019d all go.\nAnd we had work sessions and it was absolutely fascinating because you could\ntalk to people who had been involved in some other activity on D-Day that I had\nseen but never fully understood. And now you could ask questions, how did you\ndo this? How did these rocket firing craft work that were on our left, and so on.\nAnd we all submitted a tape beforehand and Ambrose told me that he liked mine\nam \u2014 and considered it to be among his best. And we \u2014 and then he wrote the\nbook, D-Day, which became a best seller and my story is in there in multiple\ninstallments about my D-Day experience. So I mentioned to him that I we \u2014 was \u2014\nI wanted to write a book, for the reasons I\u2019ve already stated. And he said, you\nmust absolutely. And I said, don\u2019t I need an agent? And he said, yes you do, why\ndon\u2019t you use mine? And he recommended me to his agent in New York, and that\ndidn\u2019t work out at all, because the man told me on th \u2014 I never met him, but the\nman told me on the phone that he was suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\nand it would be quite some time before he got around to reading my book, because\nhe \u2014 he couldn\u2019t in his present condition. That was very discouraging. Secondly \u2014 I\nmean, I had notions that I\u2019d get it out for the 50\" anniversary of D-Day, and it \u2014 I\n107September 25, 1998\nwas clearly not going to make it. Then he said, it will require extensive editing,\nand he recommended an editor to me, who said he charged 250 dollars an hour.\nAnd I said, I can\u2019t afford for you to read my book, leave alone to edit it. And we\nmade a \u2014 an agreement that I would pay him an amount for giving me advice, after\nreading some of the book. And he gave me some advice, some of it good, some of\nit I discarded, which was to be anticipated. Then a man published a book about my\noverall unit, that is a\u2014 my \u2014 my commando unit, in which I was fortunate enough\nto \u2014 to be able to strike back. It was number three troop, 10 commando. The 10\ncommando had two French troops, a Dutch troop, a Norwegian troop, a Polish\ntroop. I think we\u2019ve been through that. And he wrote about all of us, you know, so\nwe were one chapter in that book. And this man had done considerable research\nand was familiar with all the dramatis personae. So I told \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 he offered to\nhelp me edit, and \u2014 and to advise me. And in return, he was writing additional\nbooks on the SOE, special operations of the U.S. \u2014 of the allied forces, and he\nneeded research done at the National Archives, because it didn\u2019t exist in England.\nSo I did the research for him for days on end, and found very interesting things\nthat he could use in his book and in return he \u2014 we exchanged tapes and he advised\nme. When I told Stephen Ambrose that he and \u2014 that I \u2014 I didn\u2019t get along with\nhis agent, he said, oh, I haven\u2019t used him in years. But naturally it didn\u2019t occur to\nhim to, you know, to \u2014 to call me and say I didn't use \u2014 I don\u2019t use that agent any\n108September 25, 1998\nmore. And he said, well, there are several options, and one of the ideas that came\nup was that I should talk to the people at the Holocaust Museum. And I talked to\nMr. Aronowitz at the Holocaust Museum, who had been in publishing in a\nprevious life, and he said, tell you what Pll do. I-I will print out publishers who I\nthink would be interested in your book. Now, they won\u2019t all be big publishers,\nsome of them specialize in military memoirs and that\u2019s probably a prime\nconsideration. And he printed out the list and the top publisher on the list was\nPresidio Press in California, and I sent them \u2014 a-and Mr. Aronowitz advised me\nthat the way to do it was to telephone and ask for the acquisition editor. Now, the\naverage first time author doesn\u2019t know that, and sends it blind. Well, I sent it to the\nacquisition editor and got a letter back saying we are interested in your book. First\npublisher I submitted it to. And they accepted the book, they said they print 20\nvolumes a year, and they get 1600 submissions. And before the book was printed,\nit was ti\u2014 the movie options were bought by Miramax. And recently the German\ntranslation options were bought by a German publisher, whom I\u2019m trying to\ncontact to offer my services in case they need any help, because I want to make\nsure that it\u2019s done right. Now, the book has totally changed my life. As a first time\nseptuagenarian author, I am being asked to speak here, there and everywhere and\nto give book talks. The story I told you about the fruit dumplings, the commitment\nto which we were not to be late was at the Eldredge Library in Chatham on Cape\n109September 25, 1998\nCod. And this is a retiree audience, by no means Jewish, and they were a\nmarvelous audience. And I spoke for about an hour, and then I \u2014 we had a book\nsigning at the bookstore about three houses away. And I said, I think I \u2014 I have to\nfinish now, so that we make it in time to the bookstore. And the people started to\nyell, don\u2019t stop, keep going, we want to hear more. Which is fascinating, I mean\nit\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 they were really interested and into it and asked intelligent questions\nand I have since discovered that in these little New England towns, the library is\nreally the focal point of the community. That\u2019s where people gather. I mean, it\u2019s a\nsort of intellectual exercise. And that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s always a good sign and very\ngratifying. But apart from that, and I spoke to an Orthodox synagogue in London\nwhere there were 450 people and no microphone because I was billed as the \u2014 the\nShabbat preacher, 1f you will. And so nobody could turn on a microphone and I\ncouldn\u2019t hold a piece of paper, because that\u2019s working. I mean, carrying the piece\nof paper. And so I thought how, as a sergeant major you would have to shout that\nyou could be heard at the other end of the parade ground and I thought I sa \u2014I\u2014 I\ndid that when I was a sergeant, I\u2019Il do it again. Be \u2014 the rabbi was doing it. And it\nworked very well, and I was given all kinds of honors, opening the ark and closing\nthe ark, I was worried whether it was \u2014 you \u2014 you asked earlier about my religious\norientation, which was \u2014 activity, which was somewhat marginal. I was Bar\nMitzvahed, and my grandfather was a very religious man, but he never explained\nSeptember 25, 1998\na\u2014a-\u2014a word about \u2014 not even at Seder, he just rattled off his prayers and \u2014 and\nwas a\u2014 nota teacher. Well, so I was worried whether I was going to do all these\nthings right in the Orthodox synagogue, I\u2019d never officiated in \u2014 in any synagogue\nleave alone an Orthodox one. And they said there will be somebody behind you\nwho will tell you to do all the right things, and it turned out it was very, very\nsimple, it worked very well, and I shook hands for umpteen officials in a given\norder [indecipherable] traditional. I also spoke at a Reform synagogue to largely\nveterans. And there is an a-americ \u2014 an organization called AJEX, the Association\nof Jewish ex-Servicemen and Women. And they organized that in Edgware, a\nsuburb of London. And I spoke there, and when I finished \u2014 again, marvelous\naudience, the \u2014 there wer-were questions and one man stood up in the audience\nand said, you say your mission is to spread the word that you didn\u2019t go like lambs\nto slaughter, you are accomplishing that, I trust. But you are accomplishing\nanother mission that you don\u2019t even know of. And he held up a British army pay\nbook, which every soldiers carries. And he said, this is my uncle\u2019s pay book. \u2019ma\nmember of the Sachs(ph) family of \u2014 of refugees from Germany. And my uncle\nserved under the name of Seymour in your commando troop. And until we read\nyour book just now, the family did not know what happened to him beyond the\nwar office telegram saying that he was killed in action. In your book you say that\ni-in the night assault crossing of the river Rhine, you were in a amphibious track\n111September 25, 1998\ncra \u2014 vehicle called the Buffalo, and that the Buffalo next to yours in mid-river\nwas hit and burst into flames, and that nobody got out alive, as far as you know.\nAnd two of the people on it, you say, were Fogel(ph) and Sachs(ph) who served\nunder the name of [indecipherable] and Seymour. And this 1s the first time we\nfound out what happened to my uncle. And that brings closure to our feelings and\nwe thank you for it. And people in the audience started to cry, and it was very\nemotional, and I felt that 1t somehow made it all worthwhile to have done this, and\nstruggled to write the book and to do this. And that\u2019s by no means all. I had the\nphone call from a woman who said that her name was Claudine Schindler.\nActually Claudine Arbour Schin-Schindler. And she had seen the article about\nme that was caused by my book in the B\u2019nai B\u2019rith international magazine, th-the\nmonthly. And it said that my name had been Arany, and her name had been\nArany, and were we related? And she started to lay out her family. And she is the\ngranddaughter of my father\u2019s oldest brother, who was a \u2014 quite a character, in fact\nthe name Arany was invented by him. The family name had been Freed(ph) but\non \u2014 being in Hungary he wanted to have a Hungarian name, and what\u2019s more, he\nwas a sort of macho character who in the 20s wore a black leather jacket and rode\na red Indian motorcycle. And my father imitated him in almost everything, his\nolder brother. They were both jewelers. Arany in Hungarian means gold, so it was\nsort of a pun to have that name. And in addition, it\u2019s the name of the national poet\n112September 25, 1998\nof Hungary, Arianosh(ph), and aristocratic, he wanted tha \u2014 obviously. And he \u2014\nhe was divorced from a very nice woman whom I knew much better than I knew\nmy Uncle Carol(ph), Ilsa(ph) who ran a \u2014 a pensionne 1n the country that\nbelonged to some very wealthy relatives of hers. But she was sort of the poor\nrelative. Lovely woman, who invited us as children a couple of times to this\npensionne in the country and I have very nice memories of that. We had to be on\nour best behavior because of all the elegant people there. And she had two sons,\nAussie(ph) and Jurry(ph) Arany, and apparently they got out. We were not in\ntouch. And they got out and lived in France throughout the war, running from\nplace to place in hiding, as people did who survived in France. And then one of\nthem got \u2014 oh, in France they changed the name Arany to Arbor, spelled like the\nEnglish word arbor, but pronounced arbore(ph). And one of them got to Brazil,\nand then got the rest of the family, postwar to Brazil, and some went on to the\nUnited States. And this woman was terribly excited about having found a relative\nbecause she didn\u2019t know that she had any relatives at all. And her father is dead,\nand so is her uncle, the two sons of Carol(ph) and Ilsa(ph). And she said, I will\ntell my brothers and they\u2019Il probably call you. And the next day I had a telephone\ncall from Brazil, from what is after all a first cousin once removed. And they are\nall coming \u2014 he is coming to America in November, and he\u2019Il rent a car and bring\ndown as many of the family as he can. And as I said, all very, very excited. So I\n113September 25, 1998\nfound some close relatives I didn't know I had. I mean, I knew they existed, but\nthat\u2019s the next generation, you see? The generation after. And the \u2014 th-th-there are\nthree grown children of the woman in New Jersey, and the \u2014 the youngest just\ngraduated from college. And I did know at one point that I thought the two sons of\nmy uncle had gotten out, because in London, in her apartment building, my\nmother needed some wrapping paper once, and she borrowed it from a Mrs.\nBuerger(ph) who was living at the other end of the corridor. And Mrs.\nBuerger(ph) gave her a used piece of brown wrapping paper, that\u2019s all she had on hand.\nAnd on it was the name of one of these two boys, cousins. But my mother, being\ndivorced from my father, had no interest in taking up a relationship, and she just\nremembered the fact that she had seen the name, and so maybe they got out, she said, and\nI s\u2014I said, ask Mrs. Buerger whether she knows these people. And nothing ever\nhappened, it \u2014 1t ran off into the sand.",
        "A: I have had nothing but excellent reviews. Some of the major papers have not reviewed\nit. The \u2014 and \u2014 and you learn a whole new thing, you know, about what to \u2014 what did I\nknow about publishing? A woman called me from \u201cThe Wall Street Journal,\u201d saying I\nreview books for \u201cThe Wall Street Journal,\u201d but they devote very little space to it. I\nloved your book, but \u2014 and I wrote a review, but it may not appear. And, it didn\u2019t,\nbecause there are lots of books and limited space and that\u2019s how it is. And the publisher\u2019s\nweekly pub \u2014 which guides libraries, published it very favorably, and suddenly at the be \u2014\n114September 25, 1998\nbe \u2014 beginning of last months, the \u201cJerusalem Post\u201d reviewed it, with a very, very good\nreview. And the \u2014 it \u2014 it suddenly rekindles a \u2014 you know, like \u2014 like a fire that dies down\nand then catches a \u2014 a flame anew, this goes on and on. And I get phone calls and letters\nfrom people all over the world. I had a letter \u2014 a-and a \u2014 a tape \u2014 a CD from Australia\nfrom a man who said he is sending me a CD of the song, \u201cThe Bells of Aberdovey,\u201d\nwhich is where we trained in North Wales, and I knew of the song. I\u2019ve forgotten how it\ngoes, but I \u2014 I remember it from that time. And he said, I am the first tenor on this record,\nbecause I am Welsh. I live in Australia now, but I thought you might like to have it. So\nhe sent me a CD of \u201cThe Bells of Aberdovey.\u201d I mean, as I say, weird things happen all\n\u2014all the time. And various friends whom I \u2014 with whom I had lost contact have contacted\nme because they\u2019ve heard of \u2014 seen the book and \u2014 and sought me out, or they wrote \u2014 or\nthey wrote to the publisher to forward mail to me. One of my best friends is the son of an\nAustrian matinee idol who \u2014 Hubert Marischka. His name is Franz Marischka and he\nlives \u2014 he was in the Pioneer Corps with me, he lives in Munich now. He came to spend\nthe day with me in London from Munich especially. And he is the grandson of Victor\nL\u00e9on who wrote the libretto for the \u201cMerry Widow,\u201d and the godson of Franz Lehar.\nAnd quite a character in his own right, and we had a marvelous day comparing notes. I\nwould never have recognized him, he is a\u2014 a \u2014 a little portly, bald man, and he was a\ndashing, blonde, young movie actor when I knew him. So \u2014 but we had a lot of fun. And\nthat happens all the time.\n115September 25, 1998",
        "A: The status of the movie may be known to the moviemakers, a-and \u2014 and I \u2014 not even\nto the publisher, because the publisher handed it to the William Morris Agency, who\nacts as his agent, and o-other than my having a contract with the publisher for a portion of\nsubsidiary rights, lest anyone thinks that \u2014 well, one of the English papers wrote the last\nparagraph in a review saying, and Peter Masters sold his book, \u201cStriking Back,\u201d to the\nmovies for a million dollars. Well, don\u2019t you believe it. First of all, there\u2019s no million\ndollars. Secondly, the William Morris Agency gets 10 percent off the top. The publisher\ngets 50 percent of the remainder. That\u2019s already si\u2014 more than 60 percent if you take\nthen off the top. Then my \u2014 my daughter Kim who covers Hollywood told me, you have\nto have a lawyer when there\u2019s a movie contract. And I said, why, naively. And she said,\ntry to go it alone and see what happens to you. So I have a lawyer in Hollywood. He gets\nfive percent, okay? Then they bought the movie option, that doesn\u2019t mean they are\nmaking the movie just yet, although they assigned a writer and a producer, which is\npromising. But I haven\u2019t seen a piece of paper, but when I ask I am told it\u2019s a done deal.\nSo a done deal is a favorite expression 1n the publishing business. Now, people expect me\nto tell them how to get books published [indecipherable] and I used to say, look, \u2019'm a\nnovice and I don\u2019t know and that didn\u2019t seem to make them very happy, they thought I\nwas hedging. So after awhile I decided I would try and give them more of an answer.\nAnd so I came up with the following formula. And they send me manuscripts, okay? So I\nsaid, it takes three ingredients. One, you have to have an unusual story, because no matter\nhow moving your story is, if it is one of many, the chances are it will not get published.\nSo, an unusual story is one. Number two, you have to be able to tell it reasonably well. I\n116September 25, 1998\nmean, you can be edited and helped, but reasonably well. And the most important\ningredient is the third one, and that is luck. Because I don\u2019t know, I mean, I feel I\u2019ve \u2014 as\nI say in my book, I\u2019ve been lucky all my life. Lucky to get out, lucky to be able to get\ninto England, lucky to be able to join the army, lucky to be able to get into an elite\nassault unit and be able to fight back. Lucky to survive that. Lucky to be able to get my\nbook written and accepted by the first publisher. Lucky to have the movie thing, lucky to\nhave all the other things that are happening in conjunction with it. So, that\u2019s what it ta \u2014 it\ntakes as far as I\u2019m concerned, and look, if the movie doesn\u2019t turn out as I would hope it\nwould, or isn\u2019t made bef \u2014 as long as I live \u2014 I don\u2019t know how these things work \u2014 my\nwife Alice points out, you\u2019ve done your thing, you\u2019ve written your book. Right now there\nis a debate raging about \u2014 raging is perhaps an overstatement. But one of the members of\nmy troop, who was in combat very briefly because he stepped on a mine and lost a foot in\nItaly, so he was out of it. He continues his law studies, became a judge in England,\nwhich isn\u2019t bad for a Jewish refugee boy from Europe, and he\u2019s now a retired judge. And\nhe picked up the ball as it were, when my book came out and he wants us to contribute\nmoney to a monument in North Wales. And the \u2014 to my utter shock, the words on it did\nnot include the word Jewish. So I started a sort of agitating, lobbying campaign to enlist\nsupport of ex-members of the troop or widows or families to insist that it does include the\nwords Jewish. He \u2014 the judge went so far as to say that my saying a Jewish commandos\nwar against the Nazis in the subtitle was a blur and a s \u2014 and the flaw in my book. And\nafter I got over the shock and \u2014 and told him off about making such an excessive\nstatement, I had quite the time writing him a letter saying, having been a judge I suppose\n117September 25, 1998\nyou feel you must be judgmental in some direction. I am slowly beginning to understand\nwhere this comes from, and it\u2019s very simple. First of all, this is not America, where we\nhave just finished talking about the fact that 50 years ago there was overt anti-Semitism.\nIt has become unfashionable as I say \u2014 as I put it. It\u2019s, in sophisticated circles equally\nunfashionable in England, but there is the fear of it among Jews in Britain, apparently.\nI\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 and here\u2019s the thing. When we were first changing our names and becoming\na different person, that was rather fun for most of us, because having been a hate object in\nGermany, Austria, Hungary, having been a poor refugee, as most of us were, having\nbeen in the labor unit, which was the bottom of the army, becoming an elite unit member\nand wearing the green beret and the parachute wings for which we had qualified, and then\nknowing we were risking considerable \u2014 our lives, o-our limbs, carried with it a certain\nsatisfaction and pride. And to be a different person, I mean, I \u2014 I became ultimately, well,\na commando, a commando sergeant, an officer in the Oxfordshire and\nBuckinghamshire Light Infantry, a good regiment. And I am Peter Masters and \u2014 and\ngone is the refugee Peter Arany, you see? Now, some of them relished that so much that\nthey didn\u2019t want to step out of it because they felt 1t would be stepping back. And so, to\nmy utter shock, one of my friends in Edinburgh where I spoke at the Church of\nScotland church hall, and a classmate of mine from grade school invited lots of people\nand arranged it so I had a very nice audience. Yet, a commando friend of mine in\nScotland didn\u2019t invite anybody. And I suddenly realized that the reason he didn\u2019t invite\nanybody is because it would have blown his cover, now. Because he has a Scottish name.\nHe has very little accent, much less than I do, and I suppose he can account for that by\n118September 25, 1998\nour cover story where he was aw \u2014 brought up or something. He is the president of \u2014 or\nwas, of the local rugby club. And if \u20141f he \u20141f he invited people to something called,\n\u201cStriking Back: A Jewish Commandos War Against the Nazis,\u201d and he was one of\nthe commandos, the thought would occur to them that he too is a Jewish commando from\nEurope, and he doesn\u2019t want to be. And the judge probably doesn\u2019t want to be anything\nexcept a retired judge. And that goes for quite a few. Now it doesn\u2019t go for everybody.\nThe widow of my friend Harry Nomberg(ph) says who \u2014 whose name is \u2014 is Beatrice\nNomberg(ph) and she is from Argentina. Catholic, and Harry\u2019s dead, died recently.\nAnd she says Harry wouldn\u2019t have wanted it any other way but that it says mostly\nJewish. And the judge says that was not a prerequisite for joining the troop. It was not in\nthe criteria that qualified you and I said, that\u2019s true. But where would they have found\nGerman speaking people who wanted to do special and hazardous duty, if it had not been\nfor refugees that were Jewish and German speaking. And he says, well, some of them\nwere \u2014 were not Jewish. They were half Jewish or they were baptized, or they were \u2014\nthey didn\u2019t even know that the \u2014 part of their family was Jewish. And I said, the Nazis\nknew.\n[break]\n119September 25, 1998",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Sure. In \u2014 in 1984, I retired. It was the earliest time that I could retire, and that\nalways brings with it certain f \u2014 financial disadvantages, but I felt it was high time\nfor me to get a \u2014 get out of what had become a rather difficult thing. The time of\nenthusiasm that we had had in the \u2014 1n the poverty program was long gone. Even\nthe transformation into wanting to take on the \u2014 the musty look of government and\ntry and brush it up into something more contemporary and positive, that was\nbeginning to ebb away and the fights were more frequent than \u2014 than the \u2014 the \u2014\nthe challenges. And there were various \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 that\u2019s another thing in that period\nof government, and that is that you can have an administration, a government with\nwhich you agree politically, but the person in charge of your agency may not be at\nall conducive to doing any positive things in \u2014 in what I considered my field and\nmy charge. Or reversely, you might have an administration that is unacceptable\npolitically to you, and you have no choice until next election as it were, and then\nyou may lose. And the \u2014 a-and yet it might be possible to do some positive things\nbecause you have somebody who is interested and who cares. Now, in the overall,\n120September 25, 1998\nin order to improve, and there have been conscious efforts of bringing good design\nto government, not always, what shall I say, enlightened efforts. But there were\ntimes when Nancy Hanks was in charge of \u2014 of the endowment, and she had a\nway to get around politicians that was admirable. And in \u2014 so \u2014 so there \u2014 there\nwere times when it \u2014 when one had the feeling that something worthwhile could\nbe accomplished, and there were other times when it seemed utterly hopeless.\nUtterly hopeless. And we \u2014 I \u2014 I remember \u2014 I remember trying to get \u2014 to come\nup with a formula a-and saying, well \u2014 o-or \u2014 at least an analysis, a diagnosis of\nwhy things were so hopeless at times and it 1s because the government is made up\nalmost entirely of lawyers. All right? Now, I have nothing against lawyers per se,\nbut with the very specialized methodology of American education, unlike some\nEuropean educations, which in my opinion emphasize general knowledge and a\ngeneral sort of Renaissance view of not knowing only your subject, but also the\narts and literature and music and something of a-at least basic something. This\ndoes not necessarily hold in this country. And it\u2019s perfectly possible to be a\nbrilliant lawyer and have absolutely \u2014 if \u2014 if you were asked to name three\nAmerican sculptors, they couldn\u2019t do it. Which is astonishing, you know? There\nhave been some wonderful ones. But I mean, ap \u2014 quite apart from that, perhaps\nthe size of the country is counterproductive to this kind of thinking because if you\nask me to name an artist from every of the 50 states, I probably would have a very\n121September 25, 1998\nhard time, because well, because I \u2014 and \u2014 and you see, there are layers of\nknowledge. There are people who know a lot about a subject, there are people who\nknow a li\u2014a bit ab \u2014 some, and there are people who know a little and then there\nare people who know nothing. And it\u2019s perfectly possible to be prominent in one\nfield in this country and know nothing about the others. It\u2019s a bit shocking, but\nthen there are many shocking things like that, culturally. I\u2014 I\u2014 one of my favorite\nexamples since I was in Japan a few years ago 1s tell me somebody who knows\nanything \u2014 anything about Japanese culture, who learned it in school. Thi \u2014\nanything besides \u201cShogun\u201d and \u201cMadame Butterfly.\u201d Anything about the\nbackground of an ancient culture, you see? And we don\u2019t learn it in school, I guess\nit\u2019s assumed. I mean, unless you\u2019re a specialist, because perhaps it\u2019s assumed that\nthere is so much knowledge out there that you can\u2019t know it all. Computers can\nchange that a bit now, because you can, if you\u2019re at all interested, you can look it\nup in the internet and it\u2019s pro \u2014 no doubt in there. And I wonder to what extent that\nwill spread a degree o-o-of feeling, of general knowledge? Now, when \u2014 if we\ndon\u2019t have a president one day who really cares about the arts, beyond the\nKennedy Center Awards, do you think that \u2014 that the arts will flourish all by\nthemselves a-as congress encourages sponsored by corporations, rather than by the\nendowment and so on? This is a very tricky subject, you see? It da \u2014 it \u2014 some of it\nisn\u2019t going to happen. And if you look back, historically, whether we have had any\n122September 25, 1998\narts in \u2014 in top positions; there\u2019s Thomas Jefferson, who was in his own right, an\ninventive, creative mind that I think overlapped into the arts and certainly into\narchitecture. What he did at Monticello and at the university 1-is \u2014 is admirable.\nCan you think of any other ones? You see, you \u2014 I probably don\u2019t know enough\nabout some of the intervening ones, but \u2014 but certainly, I mean \u2014 okay,\nRockefeller was an art collector and he was vice-president. Whether he collected\n\u2014I don\u2019t know his motivations. Mondale\u2019s wife was into ceramics, all right?\nJackie was into \u2014 int \u2014 into interior decoration, all right? But \u2014 but going\nbackwards, do you think that Carter, Bush, Reagan? Well, into movies.\nEisenhower, Kennedy? Blank. You see, I mean, an interest - Humphrey was\nvery interested in photography. We did a big photo exhibits when I was in the\npoetry program that he prompted. And it was lovely. I took him through it and it\nwas marvelous how perceptive he was. But you see, we are not going to elect an\nartist or even an art collector president, it \u2014 as it stands. And then th \u2014 and I think\nthat it would take a strong hand to do something to \u2014 1-1-in fact, let me backtrack\nthat [indecipherable]. It is marvelous that we are doing as well as we are, because\nthe point \u2014 the center point of the arts has actually shifted to this country from \u2014\nfrom Europe, from Paris to New York and perhaps Los Angeles, I don\u2019t know.\nChicago. And \u2014 and we are doing amazingly well considering that \u2014 that what I\njust said holds true. And when I applied for my Fulbright you may recall, my\n123September 25, 1998\nprincipal, a Scots painter said they are in their Elizabethan age in the United\nStates, artistically, culturally. Meaning the first Elizabeth, right? So, we are doing\nremarkably well, we could be doing much better still, with more encouragement,\nwith less sort of redneck small town attitudes about the arts being on the border of\nsomething questionable, and sinful and not quite reputable. Which is what we are\nseeing every time the endowment happens to \u2014 to endorse, or not even endorse,\nbut \u2014 but gets marginally involved with a grant that is then used for something that\nis appalling and shocking. And of course, that\u2019s the chance you take, to some\nextent. You can\u2019t pre-examine and sense everything you award, and some of them\nare going to misfire. So, we get some demonstrative art that\u2019s a bit beyond the pale\nwhen people shoot themselves 1n \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in the toes in order to \u2014 yeah, there\nwas some man who \u2014 who considered that demonstrative art, he actually shot\nholes into himself on the stage, or the other one kicked herself in chocolate in the\nnude, and so on, and this is performance art, you see, but th \u2014 there 1s much in art\nthat is shocking if it is new. Some of it is bad. Well, if you want some good,\nthere\u2019s also going to be some bad, th-there has to be freedom. Now, perhaps one\ncan control that a little bit, but the attempts have been made to go by local\nstandards only. Well, there are some Noguchi sculptures in Seattle that the\ngovernment, General Services Administration under its arts in \u2014 in government\nbuildings program put in, and a local congressman protested that these were pet\n124September 25, 1998\nrocks, because Noguchi takes a stone and works it minimally, but very, very\nbeautifully. My judgment okay, but not only mine. And he thought that this was\nmeaningless, and a waste. And a Sugarman sculpture in a court in Baltimore was\nhated by the judge and the judge rules his court like a-an autocratic ruler. And he\nsaid it was dangerous because it offered hiding places for muggers who would\nwaylay the secretaries when they came from work in the evening. Well, I mean,\nthese are pretty farfetched criticisms. He just didn\u2019t like that sculpture, you know.\nAnd maybe it was not a nice sculpture, I mean, a-are you going to love all\nsculptures equally? I heard scathing criticism of the Roosevelt Memorial. And\nthen I \u2014 and I haven\u2019t seen it yet. And I looked at a brochure about it, and the\nartists who were involved, like Baskin and Segal and \u2014 and Benton, who is the\ncarver of the letters, are top notch people. So it can\u2019t be all bad. Oh, I didn\u2019t\ncontinue that I said \u2014 well, in \u201984, in \u201984 I retired and I took my early retirement\nand \u2014 and made a rousing farewell speech where I told them all what was wrong\nwith government and with the General Services min \u2014 Administration in particular\nand it made people blanch, but I really loved the opportunity to use the commando\nspirit and \u2014 in at least telling them how it was, which was pretty much off the rails\nby that time and I was glad to \u2014 to get out. And I freelanced and I started to work\non my book. I freelanced and my daughter Anne is in the same \u2014 she has design\nstudio, of course, it\u2019s high tech. She has two Macintosh and she does stuff on the\n125September 25, 1998\ncomputer. But there are things that I \u2014 I maintain, I\u2019m not sure she would agree,\nthat I can do that the computer can\u2019t. And so we work together and she does the\ntechnological stuff and she has very good ideas, but they work better when we\nbrainstorm together. And we do that by phone and in person, and \u2014 and the last\nconversation was this morning, on th \u2014 a project she is working on. And we come\nup with \u2014 with very nice solutions together.",
        "A: Paula Ammon(ph) wrote an article in the B\u2019nai B\u2019rith monthly magazine\ncalled what, \u201cJewish Monthly,\u201d I think? And it\u2019s an international magazine. And\nthey sent a photographer out whose \u2014 whose name I\u2019d have to look up, but he is\nbrilliant, because he actually took a picture of me that I like, and that\u2019s hard to do.\nHe took a lot of pictures and they used one, and it shows that even as a\nseptuagenarian first time author, you don\u2019t have to look like a decrepit old man.\nHe \u2014 and she wrote a very nice article. There were a couple of errors. One she\ndidn\u2019t do herself, because somebody else writes the table of content at the front of\nthe magazine. And in that table of content, they \u2014 this person wrote that I had\nserved in Normandy and Salerno. And I was nowhere near Salerno. But some of\nour people were. My friend Stefan(ph) Rosskum(ph) who served as Steve Ross\n126September 25, 1998\nwas in Salerno and I think the judge who is now retired, with whom I am debating\nthe inscription on the monument was in Salerno, and \u2014 and they were in Anzio\nand in Salerno, and then in the river crossings in the Italian campaign, the\nCarilliano(ph), the Isonzo and so on, before we landed on D-Day. But I was not\nin Salerno. Secondly, the second mistake is much worse, it says that when I went\nto art school in London after my military service, I wanted to get into the Central\nSchool of Art and Design, because I had heard that it will \u2014 because it was so\nanti-Semitic that it was hard to get in. That is totally untrue. She got that fir-first\nbecause I \u2014 I said that I had been told it was a very competitive school and it was\nhard to get in, not a word of anti-Semitism is true. I made up my mind that I would\nget into the school because it was competitive and it was going to be difficult to\nget accepted. I felt that I had perhaps an unfair advantage because I was still in\nuniform, and if you come to apply to a school after six years of war ina\ncommando uniform with parachute wings and your medal ribbons, the chances are\nthey\u2019re gonna let you in if your work isn\u2019t terribly bad, I guess my work was not\nthat terribly bad, although I remember sitting in a life class and the very prominent\npainter who taught that life class looked over my shoulder and said, how many\ntimes a week are you taking life class? And I said, three times a week. And he\nsaid, make that five. A sobering experience. So, and it says then, with \u2014 with\ntypical chutzpah I became president of the students union. Well, the person who\n127September 25, 1998\ntold me it was hard to get into the school in the first place was a young woman\nwho had just graduated, and she boasted that she had been president of the student\nunion, she was a refugee. And so I decided that I would get into the school and\nbecome president of the student union, and I did. So that was not with typical\nchutzpah, but I said, with the drive of an ex-commando, I dis \u2014 I became president\nof the student union.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not sure I told you the story that after the war, there were\nannual memorial services at Westminster, and when people came out of the \u2014 I\u2019m\nnot sure if it\u2019s Westminster Cathedral or Westminster Abbey, because I think\nI\u2019ve been to one. I\u2019m told there were people recruiting. I da \u2014 I told you that story,\nthat they were recruiting for the \u2014 for the Arabs and \u2014 and for the Israelis because\nthey wanted train the sol \u2014 soldiers. Well, the Israeli \u2014 the Israeli military effort\nappeared to me to be a continuation of this thing that I was about, the \u2014 the striking\n128September 25, 1998\nback mentality. And if anything, they underscored what I was trying to\ndemonstrate, because when I was a high school kid in Vienna, the notion that\nJews would fight meaningful, strategic \u2014 no, meaningful military assault actions\nseemed very farfetched. The pictures the Nazi tried to create was that Jews were\npersons that sought desk jobs in \u2014 in \u2014 1n \u2014 or \u2014 and were over intellectualized and\nphysically incapable of any actions such as the one required in \u2014 such actions as\nthe Israelis demonstrated they were extremely capable of doing, and we too, in our\nway, demonstrated that we were able to do that sort of thing and do it well. It\nhadn't really occurred to the world, and I find that \u2014 that Jews could do an\nEntebbe raid, or fight off a vast armored superiority with mainly the spirit and \u2014\nand enthusiasm and ingenuity of a dedicated people. So all this was very important\nto me, and it had not really \u2014 well, 1-1t was novel, and it was bright and shiny. And\nI think it was wonderful that these things \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 that we were gathering\nrespect. At times I was appalled at the attempted turnaround of making that this\nwas comparable to the militarists on the enemy\u2019s side. In other words that mean-\nspirited critics would say that the Israeli actions were Nazism in the Middle East. I\nthink that that 1s a partisan point of view, that I-I find very hard to stomach. And\nagain, I have friends who are much more knowledgeable about the details of some\nof these Israeli actions, and who when criticized for the politics, which of course is\n\u20141s \u20141S a\u2014a\u2014a popular pastime anyway, point out the geography. And I\u2019ve been\n129September 25, 1998\nto Israel once, and I stood on the Golan Heights, and I \u2014 I said, if it were mine, I\nwouldn\u2019t give it up, because it means that they can do \u2014 aim shooting into the\nkibbutz on the other slope, and I obviously would have to prevent that from\nhappening. Much of this is outdated now because if the warfare is by rocket and\nmissile, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you do observed shooting or not. Nevertheless,\nthe narrow waist of Israel is so \u2014 is so narrow that you find that to give up\nterritory that would make it narrower still, is not the kind of thing you want to do\neasily and without some guarantees that are meaningful.",
        "A: About Jewish resistance I\u2019ve had some lively de-debates, mostly by letter with\nthe Holocaust Museum people, because I feel that we who, as refugees,\nvolunteered for special and hazardous duty and put our lives on the line, that this 1s\nunlike somebody joining the armed forces and serving at the Pentagon. It seems to\nm \u2014 especially if you judge it by its ultimate results. It\u2019s true that people were\nkilled in all kinds of units here and there, but many of us were killed. Twenty of\n86 were killed. And almost all were wounded and some of the wounds were by no\nmeans minor, a lost eye, a lost leg, things from which they subsequently, years\nlater, became invalids and died. I \u2014 I think the fact that a \u2014 a refugee who 1s, by\n130September 25, 1998\ndefinition a person who escaped, who \u2014 who either went into hiding and escaped\nor managed to escape when it was still possible to do so without pretense, usually\npenniless, did not sit back and say, we\u2019ve suffered enough and let somebody else\ndo it, but volunteered and volunteered and volunteered and overcame all the\ndifficulties that 1t took me and my friends to be allowed to volunteer for risky\nthings. I say we are resistance, and they say this \u2014 by resistance we define the\npeople in the forests of Vilna, or the people who, in the Warsaw uprising, and I\ncertainly agree that they were resistance, and I would define it by saying they were\nresistance of desperation, because if you are in their situation in the Warsaw\nghetto, if you are in their situation hiding in the forests and trying to \u2014 to do\ndamage to the enemy, y-y-you \u2014 you ar \u2014 this is a \u2014 a desperation move. If you\nquestioned and interviewed them as I am being interviewed now, they would say,\nthe ideal thing for us would have been to get out if we could, if only we could. To\nget equipped and trained, trained and equipped, and then to come back with the\nmaximum effectiveness of the well-trained, well-equipped person. I don\u2019t really\nwant to quibble about this indefinitely, because if they don\u2019t call us resistance,\nokay. I think we were resistance, that\u2019s all. I think we did what we could to resist\nand \u2014 and were willing to take risks and volunteer and volunteer and volunteer.\nAnd volunteer on top of volunteering for special assignments. So that gave us\nimmense satisfaction, insofar as we survived it, and I would say even insofar as we\n131September 25, 1998\ndidn\u2019t, it was a comforting thought to those who lay dying that they had done it in\nluc \u2014 that they were there because they wanted to be.",
        "A: I\u2014[P\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not sure there is very much to expand, but it works like this,\nand it\u2019s a wartime thing. You have a feeling, at times, in \u2014 in situations that might\nbe desperate or \u2014 or dangerous, or whatever, that somebody has to take some\naction that is required to resolve the situation. And you have the fi \u2014 th \u2014 and the\nfollow-up feeling of that feeling is, in my experience, that you find \u2014 and if I\ndon\u2019t, perhaps nobody will take the necessary action. That therefore you \u2014 you \u2014\nyou realize \u2014 and this doesn\u2019t \u2014 isn\u2019t a lengthy process, you suddenly realize\nsomebody must do something and must do it now and nobody seems to be doing\nit, so I better. So you do it. And you do it swiftly and with determination and you\nhave decided to do it and so you do it. And this 1s true in a great many things and\nhas its application by an extension to \u2014 to non-wartime situations where the feeling\nis, Somebody must do something, and \u2014 and \u2014 and what \u2014 what \u2014 what can I do?\nAnd 1-1 \u2014 perhaps it\u2019s entirely up to me. Sometimes with some of my best\n132September 25, 1998\ncommando friends, I found that as I was thinking somebody must do something,\nthey were already doing it, because they had a similar mindset. But not everybody\ndoes, and I think that to \u2014 to take a long bridge to some of our political problems at\nthe moment, I heard somebody ask not long ago, where is the person who is taking\nthe kind of action that was taken by an Ed Murrow in the McCarthy situation, by\nspeaking out with authority and saying, this has to stop. Or a\u2014 a\u2014a-\u2014 Welsh in\nthe McCarthy hearings when he said, sir, have you no shame, to Senator\nMcCarthy. I feel that the speaking out, and s \u2014I mean, surely an authority def \u2014\nan authority figure should stand up and say, enough already. Surely. I understand\nwhat this is all about, I understand that \u2014 that \u2014 and I have my own partisan view\nof it, wh-which \u2014 which is irrelevant. I-It seems to me that it ought to be possible\nto rise about the partisan thing when the damage done to our daily lives, the \u2014 the\nmere fatigue of \u2014 of listening to the ongoing argument about the various options\nof, and what disasters each one of them will bring upon us, surely gets you to f\u2014a\npoint where you say, enough already. I \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t get over the way the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the media makes news.",
        "A: Yeah.\n133September 25, 1998",
        "A: Okay. I\u2019m talking about the \u2014 the comparisons of the present \u2014 what \u2014 what the\nmedia called a White House in crisis, or the presidency in crisis and comparing it\nto the Nixon Watergate situation, which I think is an outrageous comparison. And\nto say that, as I heard yesterday on television, this was o-only about a minor\nburglary, the Watergate, and I say, it was about a minor burglary that affected the\ndemocratic process, the political party of the opposition and that there 1s\nabsolutely no comparison to a sex scandal.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Well, when Kennedy was in the White House, I heard from inside people who\nhad worked there, I think the f \u2014 the thing was that \u2014 the phrase, if I remember it\nrightly was a man telling me, well you know he has this thing about airline\nstewardesses. And I thought \u2014 I \u2014 I had no idea what you were talking about and\n134September 25, 1998\nthen they spelled it out to me about the swimming pool adventures of Kennedy.\nAnd you see, that \u2014 at that time, this sort of thing was going on, but traditionally\nnot talked about except in \u2014 in \u2014 in stage whispers, and entirely separate from all\nother considerations. Now, I-I can see how any moralist person would object to\nthe details of \u2014 of \u2014 of the sexual adventures of the present president. I \u2014 I \u2014 I think\nthat it is of course true, that if I described you \u2014 to you any sexual activity by\nanybody in detail, 1t would sound shocking, simply because we are not used to\nseeing this sort of thing in print, except \u2014 I mean, the beginning \u2014 le-let me\nbacktrack there. When D.H. Lawrence wrote \u2014 wrote \u201cLady Chatterley\u2019s\nLover\u201d where he first called \u2014 u-used the expressive language for a sexual\nactivity, that was banned and considered shocking. It was the first time it had\nreally happened by a major author. James Joyce describes oral sex in considerable\ndetail. The sug \u2014 but it\u2019s not customary in the average novel or \u2014 or history to go\ninto detailed descriptions, largely because the hint of Hollywood before overt sex\non the screen, the hint 1s more powerful than the spelling out. It has more \u2014 more \u2014\n1-1-1t\u2019s in \u2014 it\u2019s more tasteful, it\u2019s \u2014 it-it\u2019s more genteel. That caused some authors\nto go deliberately the other way and write it very bluntly. Miller, not Arthur, but\nth \u2014 \u201cTropic of Cancer,\u201d if you recall, made it very, very \u2014 spelled out sex\nreferences. Personally I\u2019m not shocked by anything, I think it\u2019s in pretty poor\ntaste. And the best criticism I have found, the one that strikes me the most\n135September 25, 1998\nmeaningful is the one that a president shoul \u2014 knowing that in today\u2019s scenario this\nwill come back at him and be publicized all over the place, takes what is a \u2014 a very\nreckless risk in \u2014 in doing it. And \u2014 and that is, to me, the main criticism. The fact\nthat he did it doesn\u2019t interest me at all. People do all kinds of things, some are\nmore kinky than others. But you see, there is another current in the present thing\nand that is, to many patriotic and religious Americans, the Oval Office is\nsomewhat comparable to the holiest of holy in the temple, and \u2014 before its\ndestruction. And so, if anything happened \u2014 like that happens in the Oval Office,\nwhich was presumably the ambition of this young woman, so that she would have\nher place in history, sh-she \u2014 th-the thing 1s that this 1s in and of itself appalling,\nbecause it was \u2014 it desecrated the holiest of holy in the temple of the White House.",
        "A: Well, what can I say? Ed Murrow, Eric Sevareid, where are you now? You\nsee, would \u2014 even \u2014 even taking the best of the best of the present, there isn\u2019t\nreally anybody who could hold a candle, to use a clich\u00e9, to any \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to those\ntwo men, who were serious, responsible reporters. Now, we get multiple\nspeculation. One of my pet aversions at the moment, by the way, 1s the talking\n136September 25, 1998\nheads, when \u2014 and \u2014 and the only credit you have to explain who they are, is a\nformer prosecutor. It\u2019s a favorite choice. There are lots of former prosecutors, of\nall \u2014 of all shades, you see? Now, I think \u2014 and I\u2019ve seriously considered to \u2014 to try\nand communicate that wish to the media, they ought to be compelled to say \u2014 to\ngive a\u2014 an extra s \u2014 a\u2014a-a subtitle under former prosecutor and saying, a former\nprosecutor, a political appointee appointed by Richard Nixon, for instance.\nBecause then you would understand \u2014 I mean, I understand where they come from\nby what they say anyway, but I think there are lots of people out there who say ah,\na former prosecutor. Must be a legally well-informed person, you see. And some\nof them were shallow political appointees, ultra-partisan appointees and the least\nyou could do is say, who put them there to be a former prosecutor, so that we \u2014\neverybody can understand th \u2014 and anticipate what they are going to say. Now, if\nwhat they are going to say 1s a partisan line, that they tell you. And then they\u2019ll say\n\u2014they\u2019|l anticipate what might be done to counteract that. And they will say, the f\n\u2014 the following options, and so wa \u2014 in any case they will exhaust and dismantle\nany option before it has even been dreamt of by anybody. And now there 1s\nnothing new you are going to hear, but you are going to hear again and again and\nagain that this was a minor burglary, and this is not a case of sex, but a case of\nprofound obstruction of justice. And to \u2014 to me, I would even suggest that all these\nlawyers get together and say that perjury in cases of denying sexual activity should\n137September 25, 1998\nbe discounted as ca \u2014 as perjury. Because, it\u2019s an automatic reflex. If you ask\nsomebody \u2014 it\u2019s like the question, when did you last beat your wife? It\u2019s a\nquestion, when did you last have an extramarital affair? Gee, I never had an\nextramarital affair, okay? This is a reflex by people, and their \u2014 is that peryurous if\n\u20141f you say, I \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014I mean, a per \u2014 it took a President Carter to say, I only\nlusted in my heart. Some of them go beyond lusting in their heart.",
        "A: We had perhaps mentioned a couple of things. Offhand I can\u2019t think of any. I \u2014\nI think that \u2014 I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll remember afterwards what we \u2014 I should have spoken\nless of, and what I should have spoken more of, but there it is.",
        "A: Whose accomplishments?",
        "A: Ha. Well, I don\u2019t know that I would call them accomplishments, I \u2014 I\u2019ve always\npointed to my apparently continuing streak of luck in \u2014 in many of the things I\u2019ve\nundertaken. Accomplish, it\u2019s \u2014 1s it an accomplishment to have gotten out of \u2014 out\nfrom under the Nazis? Is it an accomplishment to have continued a life in which I\nwas able to strike back at the Nazis? All these are accomplishments, if you want to\n138September 25, 1998\ncall them that, that I relish, but I \u2014 I think they\u2019re sort of automatic. It\u2019s the sort of\nthing I felt I had to do. And that applies to everything. It applies to my struggling\nand typing a book with two fingers, sometimes three, to \u2014 and \u2014 and getting it\ndone. It applies to \u2014 to all these things which I don\u2019t consider accomplishments,\nbut as \u2014 as we said before, when you feel you have to do it because \u2014 I mean,\nmaybe another one of my colleagues had written a book. And some of them\nactually did, I think, for their own family accounts and so on. But I thought the\nimportant thing was not to tell my family, per se, the important thing was to get\nthe word out that this existed, and that 1t did happen. So that was an\naccomplishment if you will, but I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 I would substitute the\nphrase, 1t was something I had to do, rather than saying it\u2019s an accomplishment.",
        "A: Well, what do I have to do? I\u2019m aware by simple arithmetic that I will not see\nmy grandchildren accomplish the things I\u2019d love to see them accomplish. So I\ntried to influence them by telling them a lot of stories. As you know, I\u2019m prone to\ndo that. And I\u2019ve just written a birthday poem for my 11 year old grandson, in\nwhich I urge him to become a Renaissance man. And I\u2019m si \u2014 when I told him that\nin person the other day, because his \u2014 he \u2014 he tends to have a \u2014 at present a one\ntrack interest in fishing and \u2014 and \u2014 fly fishing. He gets very sophisticated about\n139September 25, 1998\nhow and what, and he knows the name of every fish that ever swam in the water,\nwhich I think is very fine. But I say there is even more to the world than \u2014 than \u2014\nthan fish, and the great thing is to strive to become a Renaissance man, and then\nrelax with his fishing rod, and think about the great things that he has learned in\nother subjects. So, if I could guarantee that I can g \u2014 influence my grandchildren to\nlead meaningful lives, that would satisfy me no end.\n"
