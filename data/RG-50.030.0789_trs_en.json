So somehow they \u2014 the families arranged it. He was\ndark, tall, my grandmother was blue eyed with very light blonde hair, and also tall.\nSo \u2014",

He received a permission to teach them religion. They\ngave him only the first part of the Bible, the Old Testament, written in old Polish.\nAnd for one hour on Sunday, he taught them the language, based on the Bible.",
        "Q: Isn\u2019t that interesting.",

        "Q: And this is in Garnisonkirche?",
        "A: And this is in Garnisonkirche, but somehow I think somebody \u2014",
        "Q: Informed on him?",
        "A: \u2014 informed on him, and he was told that the best part would be if he left \u2014\nmoved northwest, so he \u2014 they went to north Dortmund. And from there on he\npromised himself that he will not return to Poland until Poland had a government.\nJanuary 21, 2015\nThe government was established in 1922, so I believe that it took them almost two\nyears to travel back.",
        "Q: Amazing.",

        "Q: It\u2019s not such a long distance.",

I had 11 cousins, including my brothers and my cousin and I was the only\ngirl in that age. I had cousins, girls, but they were older, much older than I was,\nabout 10 - 12 years old. But \u2014",
        "Q: Well, that makes you quite special.",
        "A: But I played with them, and when they were quarreling, they always said, okay,\nwe have to have a general. Who is going to be the general? They pointed at me\nbecause I was the only girl. Would I quarrel with anybody\u201d?",
        "Q: Yeah. So, tell me a \u2014a little bit about what happened to your family on\nSeptember 1*, 1939, when Germany attacked Poland. You were a baby, so \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And Mother tried to move closer to her mother, who lived in KoSscian, which\nwas northwest of Poznan, and about 30 kilometers northwest of \u2014 of Leszno. And\n 4January 21, 2015\nwe were right \u2014 few kilometers south. But she told me that she moved from town\nto town, zigzagging back and forth until she reached KoScian, because it was \u2014\nshe was already pregnant with my brother Andrew. But she reached KoScian and\nlived with my mother and her ailing sister.",
        "Q: That is with your grandmother.",
        "A: Yes, with my grandmother, mm-hm.",
        "Q: And what happened with your father?",
        "A: My father was caught in an ambush in \u2014 in the forest behind \u2014 around Oder,\nand that part of the regiment was practically annihilated. He was shot, was\nwounded. Those that were caught, which were about 10 \u2014 he said about 10, maybe\n15 people, but no more, cause some of them were very wounded, but were alive.\nThey took them, but he passed out apparently, and after two days, the German\npatrol was walking with dogs, and they stopped where he was lying, and the dogs\nknow if somebody is gone or alive. And when they searched him they saw my\nfather\u2019s army registration ca-card, a teacher\u2019s card, and that he was born in\nGermany, so they took him for one of his \u2014 one of their own.",
        "Q: So he wasn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: They took him to Germany, they took him to a German hospital, and he, after\na month, he came, he was well enough to speak, and he was interrogated. And my\nJanuary 21, 2015\nfather said, I am not a German, I am a Pole. I was taken \u2014 I was born in Germany\nbecause my parents were taken there. This was during the part o \u2014 Prussian\npartition. So \u2014",
        "Q: And so what happened to \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 then he was \u2014 when he came through, they \u2014 because my father, being an\nofficer, he was taken to Murnau, which is Bavaria, to a [indecipherable] camp.\nThat camp was a camp that was dedicated or \u2014 or protected by Himmel(ph). And\nit was a camp to show off how the Germans treat Polish officers.",
        "Q: So it was sort of like a show camp.",
        "A: Yes. When there was no visitation, they would treat it like any other \u2014 well,\nsomebody \u2014 a prisoner. And, I mean, they had to scrape food. My father liked to\ncook, and everybody knew this, so he sometimes actually \u2014 I said \u2014 he said, I\ntalked at the wrong time and was sent back to the \u2014",
        "Q: The kitchen?",
        "A: \u2014 kitchen, yes, the ki \u2014 the kitchen.

So \u2014",
        "Q: So in other words, it was a show camp only sometimes.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Oh yes. They had an orchestra, he played in a co \u2014 a symphony. There was a\ntheater, there were \u2014 they had lectures, because there were quite \u2014 many\nprofessors. Polish officers and intelligentsia were sent there. So \u2014 and he stayed\nthere til the end of the war.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: When an American general was passing by, he opened \u2014 my father was right on\nguard at that time by the \u2014 by the gates. He opened, and he \u2014 that\u2019s where my\nfather learned some English, cause they wanted to show off that you could take\nEnglish, you could take French, other \u2014 to improve yourself, to show off that you \u2014\nthat \u2014 that the Germans were treating them properly.",
        "Q: And so that\u2019s why he could practice his English",
        "A: Yes, yes. And when he said, open the door, my father said, that was the first\ncommand of a different voice asking. I didn\u2019t know what to do. But he said open\nthe door, and he showed them what to do. So the other fellow who was with him,\nthey opened the gates, and he went through, all around. And said, you, where 1s\nyour family, do you have a family? And \u2014 and he said, my wife and children are in\n\u2014 in Nordhorn, in northern part \u2014 northeastern part of \u2014 of Germany, right next to\nthe Holland border. So he said, I\u2019m going to Munich, hop in. And one \u2014 as my\nfather hopped into the sidecar of the motorcycle, he hurt his leg. By the time they\n 14January 21, 2015\ngot to Munich, my father was collapsing. He had a cut on his right leg, and he\nalready had poison. So they kept him there. But my father had a letter from my\nmother, who could write to my dad in Murnau only three times a \u2014 every year \u2014\nevery quarter, she could. Every four months she could write a letter. And she\nwrote to him that we are in Nordhorn.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s in the northwestern part of Germany, if it\u2019s close to the Dutch border",
        "A: Border, na \u2014 yes \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 northwestern part of Germany, right. Right.",

        "Q: \u2014 as far as your life was concerned.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: You \u2014 did you remember anything of him in your first years, or is the first time\nyou remember seeing him, is that month and a half later, when he shows up?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t \u2014 I knew only my father from the photograph that was standing on \u2014 on\nthe the table, on the side table at home. And in-in-in the place where my\ngrandmother lived, and when I saw him, as an almost seven year old child, I\nlooked and I said, that is not my father. My father was a handsome man, with a\nbushy hair. This 1s a sick man, this 1s \u2014 cause when I saw him in Lingen(ph) in\n1945 in July, I saw a man bent over, grayish hair and \u2014 and his face was grayish, it\n\u2014 he looked like he just came out of a tomb. He could barely walk, he was so\nweak. So, it was at \u2014 that\u2019s the first time I heard him, after all these \u2014 after six\nyears of not seeing him. Cause I was a year old when he left.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: When he was gone, and I did not see him before. But we, my mother and I, we\nstayed in \u2014 in KoScian. It\u2019s through June of 1944.",

        "Q: Ah, so \u2014",
        "A: But \u2014 but what happened is that my mother was notified by her father-in-law\nwhere Jusef(ph) is and that she can only write once every four months to him.\nAnd so they \u2014 so that they, many times \u2014 my mother taught me that she would put\nher letter with their letter, in order to make certain that it gets there. So my father\nsa \u2014 had some letters when he came in 1944, when he appeared, because he kept\n \"January 21, 2015\ncertain letters. But certain letters, I\u2019ve noticed that 1t was only my dear, or my\nbeloved, and everything was blacked out.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Only he would \u2014 and [indecipherable] I\u2019m kissing you [indecipherable]. That\nwas all, because whatever he wrote in it, was apparently unacceptable. So somebo\n\u2014all the letters were read through before they went to the \u2014 to the people, on both\nsides.",

And later on I\nfound out that books were on one side, and a wardrobe was on the other side. But\nsomebody took something out of it and left a black strip of a \u2014 I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe of a \u2014 a sash, or something, but 1t was looking at me.

When\nsomebody called oh, you must be \u2014 not long ago somebody had some kind of an\ninterview of people, and somebody says, oh, she\u2019s a newcomer. | said oh yes, thir\n\u2014 65 years ago I came to this country. I\u2019m only a delayed pilgrim. He said, and\nwhat is that? He took off the \u2014 the macro \u2014 microphone. I said, a delayed pilgrim\nmeans the pilgrim who came later than the first pilgrims.

I just took my brother and I sat under a tree and I said \u2014 and I just\nstarted crying, and that\u2019s it.

It was awful. Of course my hair was completely shaven\n <9January 21, 2015\nwhen I was in the hospital because it was falling off anyway. And \u2014 but somehow,\nyou know, we survived, because my mother signed a paper in December of 1944\nin the hospital.

        "Q: Or not.\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 or not. My mother said, 1t\u2019s a 50-50 chance. He says yes. You don\u2019t know,\nand we don\u2019t know, but can we try? And in the hospital we had a stamp here, and\nthey eradicated.",

I \u2014 I just \u2014 when, many\ntimes I would get up and say, why this number comes back to me? And my mother\nsaid, because it was a number that was given to you. And because I had to\nremember it when I went to the \u2014 to the platz at eight o\u2019clock in the morning, and\nwaited there with my brother. It was rain or shine, we had to be there.",

        "A: That I don\u2019t know, but there were people who were taken out of the camp, put\non a train to \u2014 outside to work someplace, to factories, to farms, for \u2014",

        "A: And it\u2019s being disinfected, so that means something \u2014 something has \u2014 I asked\nmy mother once, and she said, because those people left already. And those that\ndidn\u2019t make it were put aside, and \u2014 toward the incineration, that\u2019s it. Tha-That\nwas the only way to tak \u2014 to get rid of the bodies.

If you want to, why\ndon\u2019t you write to Germany? Or find out?",
        "Q: Did your daughter ever ask you about this stuff?",
        "A: I think she knows certain things because I said, ask Grandma. That means, ask\nmy mother. I said, my mother will tell you certain things. But my mother was very\n\u2014 she w \u2014 she was not scrupulous, but she only said \u2014 only told her certain things\nand that\u2019s it. In general, that\u2019s it, because she says, I don\u2019t want her sh \u2014 because\nmy daughter 1s very sensitive.

        "Q: And how did you end up here in Chicago?",
        "A: We had a sponsor in Wisconsin, who happened to be a Jehovah Witness. He\nfound out that my father was well-educated, knew several languages, and that \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015\ncause they wanted somebody to run their community. They needed a bishop, and\nthey would make him a bishop. And my father says, never! And it was cat \u2014 well,\nyou know, through NW \u2014 NCWC. They found out, they said this man \u2014 that\nfamily cannot, they are Roman Catholic. So, when we changed trains from New\nYork at Union Station and got on the \u2014 the Hiawatha train, we landed in \u2014 in\nLisbon, and there was nobody to pick us up. And half an hour later came a\u2014a\npriest, and spoke to us in English, sort of sounding Polish, and said, I will have to\ntake you. My mother lives here, not far away, and we\u2019re going \u2014 we have to talk.\nWe had to find another sponsor. There\u2019s a woman who will take you. She has one\ngoat and two rabbits, and \u2014 and \u2014 and three or four chickens, and she has a small\ngarden, and she would lo \u2014 she would love to take you in. Oh, my goodness. My\nmother cried. Of course it was impossible. She was lately demented, but she was a\nvery good woman. And the priest himself realized that this was not the place. So\nhe called the chancellery office in that area, and we landed in New Lisbon, not far\nfrom Mauston, Wisconsin. And a farmer, a Mr. Barlette(ph), who was a Belgian,\nmarried to an Irish woman, they had a big farm. A very wealthy man, cause he had\n500 cattles and all that stuff and \u2014 and oh, acres and acres of \u2014 of fields. And we\nwere there for six weeks, but my father had to work from four o\u2019clock in the\nmorning til eight o\u2019clock at midnight \u2014 at night, and many milking and doing all\nJanuary 21, 2015\nfarm work. I mean, you know, he was not \u2014 physically he was not ready to do this,\nto work like this. He wanted any work, he never complained. I had to say he never\n\u2014 but my mother work \u2014 worked as a housekeeper. She cleaned the whole house,\nall the windows. I was just turned 11 years old. I was ironing 30 shirts a week,\nbecause there were people working, and doing things. In the morning we got up at\nsix o\u2019clock and at 6:30 we had \u2014 we walked three miles to New Lisbon, cat \u2014\ncaught a bus that took us to Mauston, to a Catholic school, which was run by\nGerman nuns. And at least I could confer \u2014 converse freely with somebody. I\nknew some English, because I \u2014 we were taught English by the British soldiers.\nThey were \u2014 one time we had a English major, and then we had a Scottish\nsergeant. And he ri \u2014 loved the Polish language because it was such a beautiful R.\nWe could roll our Rs, as he said.",
        "Q: As they can too.",
        "A: And they can too. O-Only th-they can too. So, you know, it was \u2014 but I knew\nGerman very well, and English was in my ears. I could hear it, but 1t was difficult\nfor me to \u2014 to express myself, because the German would \u2014",
        "Q: Come in.",
        "A: Come in, and well, it \u2014 it worked itself out. The Father Evans who took care of\nus, he said, you know, I received a call from the Chicago chancellery, and there\u2019s\nJanuary 21, 2015\na Franciscan priest, who apparently knows you. And yes, because he was in\nAuschwitz, and then he was in Dachau. And he came out, and he lived with us\nand \u2014 in li \u2014 Lingen(ph). And I think then the order asked him to \u2014 to come to\nAmerica. And he stayed here, because he had TB. But he came out of it, and we\nonly saw him here for a very few weeks, and he orga \u2014 he found somebody here to\ntake care of us, and \u2014",

So \u2014 and I sang, apparently, pretty well.

Even if one makes a mistake, it is not a\nJanuary 21, 2015\nsin to say, I done this and then apologize.

But he said open\nthe door, and he showed them what to do. So the other fellow who was with him,\nthey opened the gates, and he went through, all around. And said, you, where 1s\nyour family, do you have a family? And \u2014 and he said, my wife and children are in\n\u2014 in Nordhorn, in northern part \u2014 northeastern part of \u2014 of Germany, right next to\nthe Holland border. So he said, I\u2019m going to Munich, hop in. And one \u2014 as my\nfather hopped into the sidecar of the motorcycle, he hurt his leg. By the time they\n 14January 21, 2015\ngot to Munich, my father was collapsing. He had a cut on his right leg, and he\nalready had poison. So they kept him there.

And in-in-in the place where my\ngrandmother lived, and when I saw him, as an almost seven year old child, I\nlooked and I said, that is not my father. My father was a handsome man, with a\nbushy hair. This 1s a sick man, this 1s \u2014 cause when I saw him in Lingen(ph) in\n1945 in July, I saw a man bent over, grayish hair and \u2014 and his face was grayish, it\n\u2014 he looked like he just came out of a tomb. He could barely walk, he was so\nweak. So, it was at \u2014 that\u2019s the first time I heard him, after all these \u2014 after six\nyears of not seeing him. Cause I was a year old when he left.",

So my father\nsa \u2014 had some letters when he came in 1944, when he appeared, because he kept\n \"January 21, 2015\ncertain letters.

And when somebody says, how do\nyou know what kind of a book is this, or what paper this 1s, I say, in Polish\n[speaks Polish] It had to rhyme, I don\u2019t know why, because I \u2014 my mother always\nsaid, we\u2019re going to Jaja(ph), or we\u2019re going to Babcia for their birthday or their\nImieniny, their name day. And Jola, you have to learn how to say another poem.\nSo I had to learn this. And I said, why do you read to me?

And I was always afraid to go to that room, because there was \u2014\none wall was the glass, the opposite wall was composite of doors. And later on I\nfound out that books were on one side, and a wardrobe was on the other side. But\nsomebody took something out of it and left a black strip of a \u2014 I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe of a \u2014 a sash, or something, but 1t was looking at me.

        "A: Sailed \u2014 we a\u2014 no, we had to detour and go to Ellis Island, my mother, I and\nthe youngest one. My father and Andrew went to New York, then they took us\nback on the ship, 24 hours later from Ellis Island and brought us to New York\nharbor. That\u2019s where I got my green card.",
        "A: We had a sponsor in Wisconsin, who happened to be a Jehovah Witness. He\nfound out that my father was well-educated, knew several languages, and that \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015\ncause they wanted somebody to run their community. They needed a bishop, and\nthey would make him a bishop. And my father says, never! And it was cat \u2014 well,\nyou know, through NW \u2014 NCWC. They found out, they said this man \u2014 that\nfamily cannot, they are Roman Catholic. So, when we changed trains from New\nYork at Union Station and got on the \u2014 the Hiawatha train, we landed in \u2014 in\nLisbon, and there was nobody to pick us up. And half an hour later came a\u2014a\npriest, and spoke to us in English, sort of sounding Polish, and said, I will have to\ntake you. My mother lives here, not far away, and we\u2019re going \u2014 we have to talk.\nWe had to find another sponsor. There\u2019s a woman who will take you. She has one\ngoat and two rabbits, and \u2014 and \u2014 and three or four chickens, and she has a small\ngarden, and she would lo \u2014 she would love to take you in. Oh, my goodness. My\nmother cried. Of course it was impossible. She was lately demented, but she was a\nvery good woman. And the priest himself realized that this was not the place. So\nhe called the chancellery office in that area, and we landed in New Lisbon, not far\nfrom Mauston, Wisconsin. And a farmer, a Mr. Barlette(ph), who was a Belgian,\nmarried to an Irish woman, they had a big farm. A very wealthy man, cause he had\n500 cattles and all that stuff and \u2014 and oh, acres and acres of \u2014 of fields. And we\nwere there for six weeks, but my father had to work from four o\u2019clock in the\nmorning til eight o\u2019clock at midnight \u2014 at night, and many milking and doing all\nJanuary 21, 2015\nfarm work. I mean, you know, he was not \u2014 physically he was not ready to do this,\nto work like this. He wanted any work, he never complained. I had to say he never\n\u2014 but my mother work \u2014 worked as a housekeeper. She cleaned the whole house,\nall the windows. I was just turned 11 years old. I was ironing 30 shirts a week,\nbecause there were people working, and doing things. In the morning we got up at\nsix o\u2019clock and at 6:30 we had \u2014 we walked three miles to New Lisbon, cat \u2014\ncaught a bus that took us to Mauston, to a Catholic school, which was run by\nGerman nuns. And at least I could confer \u2014 converse freely with somebody. I\nknew some English, because I \u2014 we were taught English by the British soldiers.\nThey were \u2014 one time we had a English major, and then we had a Scottish\nsergeant. And he ri \u2014 loved the Polish language because it was such a beautiful R.\nWe could roll our Rs, as he said.",
        "A: And they can too. O-Only th-they can too. So, you know, it was \u2014 but I knew\nGerman very well, and English was in my ears. I could hear it, but 1t was difficult\nfor me to \u2014 to express myself, because the German would \u2014",
        "A: Come in, and well, it \u2014 it worked itself out. The Father Evans who took care of\nus, he said, you know, I received a call from the Chicago chancellery, and there\u2019s\nJanuary 21, 2015\na Franciscan priest, who apparently knows you. And yes, because he was in\nAuschwitz, and then he was in Dachau. And he came out, and he lived with us\nand \u2014 in li \u2014 Lingen(ph). And I think then the order asked him to \u2014 to come to\nAmerica. And he stayed here, because he had TB. But he came out of it, and we\nonly saw him here for a very few weeks, and he orga \u2014 he found somebody here to\ntake care of us, and \u2014",
        "A: In Chicago, and we left \u2014 we got here of \u2014 three or four days before\nThanksgiving.",
        "A: In 1949.",
        "A: Mm-hm. November \u2014 I don\u2019t know if was 24\" or 25\". November something.",
        "A: So ever since, we lived in \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in \u2014 in Chicago. We lived first at Saint Adalbert\u2019s Church \u2014 parish, 17\"\nStreet and Ashland. And then we moved later on to \u2014 to the north \u2014 northern side,\nand \u2014\nJanuary 21, 2015",
        "A: Oh, in 1957? Yes, 1957 at the scouting celebration of \u2014 of Christmas and I\nhappened to be playing the role of Blessed Virgin, because I had hair long down to\nhear. So \u2014 and I sang, apparently, pretty well. So I had my \u2014 and I didn\u2019t have time\nto even comb it properly, I just put it in the \u2014 in back with a \u2014 with a ribbon, and \u2014\nand \u2014 and \u2014",
        "A: Yes, and I had a uni \u2014 my scout uniform, and \u2014 and we were pouring coffee and\ntea, and bringing, you know, sweets to the \u2014 to the parents, and \u2014 and guests and\nthat\u2019s how \u2014 and then he realized that he saw the same girl in church that he saw in\nthe uniform. And he stopped me one day when I was coming from North Avenue,\nand that\u2019s how it started.\nto what we\u2019ve talked about today? Is there something \u2014 again, as I asked Mr.\nPawlikowski, is there something you\u2019d like your granddaughter, Kinga(ph) to\nunderstand about what happened to you, what you went through, how you came\nout of it?",
        "A: Endurance. It \u2014 1t \u2014 it requires a personal endurance. And education, and\nfollowing the right way. Always be noble. Even if one makes a mistake, it is not a\nJanuary 21, 2015\nsin to say, I done this and then apologize. Otherwise, if you don\u2019t have the nobility\nto do this, the noble heart, then you\u2019re not a full person. And if \u2014 and have a strong\nbelief in what you want to do, and follow it. Follow your calling. But first, learn.\nGet a good education, just like we tried to instill 1t in our daughter, who went\nthrough the Jesuit education for nine years, and \u2014 and got a scholarship, full\nscholarship to in \u2014 to Loyola, and then \u2014",

She was 21,\nshe \u2014 on her 21* birthday, she went to Poland and had the Christmas \u2014 she could\nhave come to Chicago, she could have come here. But she went over thor \u2014 there,\nand she brought a Polish soul with her. They didn\u2019t even want to celebrate\nWigilia, which is the Christmas eve. And she says, what? I am going to buy the\nChristmas tree, I am going to dress it, and I am going to set the Wigilia for you. I\nwill go and stand in line and buy fish. And this was only what, \u201987? Winter of \u201987.\nAnd she did it.",
