        "Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH\nPage l\nJudah Nadich interview 2/8/95\nSWB:\nJUDAH NADICH: The DP camps, the displaced persons camps\nwere the camps to which the survivors of the holocaust who\nwere found alive on German concentration camps on German\nsoil and on Austrian soil were placed after they had been\nliberated by the advancing allied armies. In other words\nthey were camps were these survivors lived and the main\nJewish survivors until the time came for them to migrate to\nother countries where they had chosen to live for the\nremainder of their lives. Their sojourn in the camps began\nafter they had been moved out of the concentration camps\nsoon after their liberation and they lived in the camps\nuntil they left for the countries where they had chosen to\ngo.\nSWB:\nJUDAH NADICH: There were a good number of displaced\nperson's camps and they varied both in size and in nature.\nFor example (um) there was a displaced person's camp in\nStuttgart which in reality had no appearance as a camp. It\nwas a series of (um) what we would call apartment houses\nwhich had been taken over by the American Army and to which",
        "(um) the amy had placed Jewish survivors from German\nconcentration camps. On the other hand, there was a ki..,\nthere was a DP camp like um L_ berg, where there were when\nI visited it over 6,000 survivors and which had been a large\ncamp for military purposes which had been used also by the\nforeign workers who had come to Germany to help the German\neffort in industry during the war. So there are all kinds\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH\nPage 2\nof Displaced Person's camps. Um in addition, there um\ngroups of survivors who lived in a place that could not\u2019 be\ntermed a DP camp. For example, there were some Hungarian\nJewish women who had been liberated in a from a\nconcentration camp in Germany and who had gone to an- um\nsmall town in Northern Germany nearby where they just lived\ntogether in whatever kind of housing they could find. They\nlived as um a group. I don't know whether you could call\nthem a DP camp, but in essence it was. So as I said at the\noutset there were different kinds of DP camps as to the\nnumber of them I'm not exactly sure. Perhaps 20 more or\nless.",
        "SWB:\nJUDAH NADICH: That's um a difficult question to answer.\nAnd I'll tell you why. Perhaps at the um time of the\nliberation of the German concentration camps, there may have\nbeen a total of 50,000 Jewish survivors in the American zone\nof Germany. Remember that Germany immediately after the\ndefeat of the German army was divided among four conquering\narmies and were governed by the British, the Russians, the\nFrench, and the Americans. The largest zone in Germany was\nthe American zone. and there were about 50,000 Jewish\nSurvivors in the American zone, but Jews kept coming in to\nthe American zone of Germany, day by day, and soon the\nnumber was not 50,000 but 80,000 by soon I mean in a period\nof um a month, six weeks or more. I am now speaking only of\nthe American zone in Germany.\nSWB:\nJUDAH NADICH: It was a very difficult problem that had to\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH\nPage 3",
        "be dealt with. And a problem that had been unforeseen by\nthe American military authorities who had long planned for\nthe kind of governance they would establish in a defeated\nGermany. The um American plans called once Germany would be\ndefeated, for the liberation of course of all those found in\nGerman concentration camps. And for the return of all those\nSurvivors to the countries from which they had come. And\nthat was to be done within 90 days, so the plans called for.\nAnd indeed after the concentration camps had been liberated,\nthe American military authorities worked efficiently and\nwithin 90 days the um the Belgians, the French, the Greeks,\nthe Poles, whoever um whoever were found in the\nconcentration camps who wanted to go back to their homelands\nwere sent home. But the military planners had not foreseen\nthe fact that there would be Jews in the concentration\ncamps, they would be the largest number and there would be\npeople who would not or could not return to their homeland.\nThey could not because their homes and their businesses in\ntheir native countries had been seized by their former\nneighbors. They knew that if they returned and tried to\nreclaim their homes and businesses that they would be set\nupon, attacked, and perhaps even killed, and indeed, that\ndid happen with the few Jews who did go back and who tried\nto regain what they had once owned. So, most of the Jews\ndidn't want to back because they could not. There were no\nhomes for them to return to. In addition, they would not,\nbecause, the lands where they had lived and at the moment I\nam thinking particularly of Poland as well as the Baltic",
        "countries, that they knew that their former neighbors in\nmany cases had reported on their whereabouts to the Germans.\nThat they could not live among those people who were\nresponsible for their having suffered during the years of\nthe war in concentration camps. And who had been\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH\nPage 4\nresponsible for the fact that their nearest and dearest ones\nhad been killed either on their native soil or in the\nconcentration camps later. They knew that the countries\nfrom which they had come were now lands where the soil had\nbeen polluted by the blood of their loved ones, the very air\nhad been polluted by the smoke of the concentration camps\nthat had come out of the crematorium where members of their\nfamilies had been burned. At least their bodies had _ been\nburned. So as I said at the outset, they could not return\nthey would not return. They wanted to live elsewhere. So\nthe American army found these people who would not\u2019 go\nanywhere who could not go anywhere, and no plans had been um\nar arranged for such people beforehand, because the problem\nhad had not been foreseen.",
        "Long pause\nJWB:\nJUDAH NADICH: The conditions of course varied from camp to\ncamp. But by in large I think the following conditions were\npretty much accurate or if not all the camps most of the\ncamps. Firstly, the housing was inadequate, that is they\nwere crowded, the survivors were crowded in the housing.\nThere were not enough beds and mattresses to go around. In\naddition, many of the structures were poor wooded structures\nthat would not be good enough for the oncoming winter. In\nsome of the structures and some of the buildings, the um\nwater supply was insufficient, and there were often Jleeks.\nSo generally, the housing was not what it should have been.\nSecondly, they weren't getting enough food. These were\npeople who had been malnourished for years under the\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH\nPage 5\nGermans. They were now suffering from malnutrition and they\nweren't getting enough calories. When more calories were",
        "added very often those calories came from the wrong sources.\nThey were given a lot of potatoes and bread. Sometimes,\neven that wasn't good, the bread was stale the potatoes were\nrotten. So, food was a_ problem. In addition, um _ they\nlacked all kinds of things for which to occupy their time.\nThey had um no means of doing any kind of work. Um those\nwho had been musicians before the war and who were very\nanxious to get their hands and fingers on a musical instu..\ninstrument again didn't have those. Uh even those who\nwanted to spend some time um exercising, sports, using what\nwe call um in American soccer ball to play with, didn't have\nthose things. Of course, uh some people might say those are\nunimportant things. But for people who had been without\neverything for years, every little thing was important. Uh\ntheir clothing lacked much to be desired. Their clothing\nwas waS poor. It certainly was not enough for the oncoming\nwinter. They needed umb warm clothing of all kinds. Uh\nbeginning with underwear, and going all the way up to uh\novercoats. And hats and caps. Their shoes were in _ bad\ncondition. They needed shoes of all kinds. They needed\nmedical attention, although I uh must say at this point that\ndoctors, Jewish doctors among the survivors aS soon as\nliberation took place, tried to take care of their fellow uh\nnow liberated uh inmates of of the the former concentration\ncamps. But they didn't have medicines, they didn't have\nmedical instruments or surgical instruments. Uh the teeth\nof the survivors were in terrible condition. They had had\nnot dental care all through the years of the war and their",
        "teeth needed immediate uh inspection and treatment. Uh\nthere were dentists among the survivors who would have been\nglad to go to work on that, but they had nothing with which\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH\nPage 6\nto work. Uh in addition, uh they needed materials from\nwhich to make uh false teeth for example, bridges and so on.\nI'm just telling you that which comes to mind at the moment.\nBut the most important things they needed were better\nhousing, better food, better clothing, and other things.\n(SWB interjects....) Oh, I've excuse me, I've left out one\nof the most important things. That is when the war when the\nwar was over and they were transferred to concentration\ncamps to to uh DP camps. Among the survivors there were\nnone Jews. Many of those non JewsS were victims of the\nGermans. They were sent home as I told you ae little\nearlier, within 90 days after liberation. There were other\nnon Jews who did not go home, who were they? They had come\nfrom BFastern Europe. Most of them had come to Germany\nwillingly as volunteers, to help in the German war effort.\nSince many of the Germans who had worked in the factories,\nmost of them were now in the German armed forces, there was",
        "need for additional industrial workers to take care their\nplaces. And many men and women had come from the countries\nof Eastern Europe as volunteers. They got good pay, they\nreceived good food, add ..adequate housing, and they worked\nin the war effort. But as soon as the Germans lost the war,\nthey pronounced the war, they pronounced themselves\nSurvivors and they were placed into displaced persons camps.\nNow, the problem with that was first of all, there was a\nbuilt-in anti Semitism on the part of almost all of these\nnon-Jewish workers who had come to help the Germans.\nSecondly, they had been well feed all through the years of\nthe war, and if efforts were now to be made to give more\nfood to the Jews suffering from malnutrition they would only\npour oil on the fires of anti-Semitism and would lead _ to\ndisputes and conflicts and who knows what else between the\nJews and the non-Jews in the DP camps. So one of the first\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH\nPage 7\nthings that had to be done when I took uh my position as\nadvisor to General EKisenhower on Jewish Affairs, was to see\nto it that his orders of late August, I believe August 22nd,\nshould be carried out, namely the orders to establish DP",
        "camps in which the sole inhabitants would be Jewish\nSurvivors. So that was a very great need that had to _ be\ntaken care of at the beginning.\nJWB:\nJUDAH NADICH: Oh yes, Umb, there were certain camps,\nparticularly, in Bavaria, under the supervision of the\nAmerican Third Army, commanded by General Patton, like\nFeldafing and Landsberg, where the camps were locked, and\nwhere the Jewish inmates were permitted to leave camp only\nby means of a pass system that permitted a small percentage\nof them to go out of the camp on these passes and of course\nthey returned to the camp before the end of the day. The\nJewish survivors in the DP camps could look beyond the\nbarbed wire that surrounded their camp, they could see\nGerman civilians walking on the roads, they knew that the\nGermans had been the enemy of the American Army, yet the\nGermans were free to come and go as they please, but they\nwho had been liberated by the American Army did not have\nthat privilege. They were confined behind barbed wire to a\nDP camp with only a small percentage permitted to go out for\na few hours each day. Moreover, psychologically, they had\nbeen behind barbed wire in German concentration camps, now\nliberated they were still behind barbed wire. I think that\nmay have been among the first if not the very first\ncomplaints that I heard when I met with a committee of\nJewish survivors in the Feldafing--??? Displaced persons\ncamp.",
        "Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH\nPage 8\nLong pause\nSWB:\nNB: Dean Earl Harrison of the umb Law School of the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania was appointed by President Truman\nto umb examine the conditions in the DP camps. During the\nmonth of June, 1945 newspaper correspondents, foreign\ncorrespondents, in Germany had umb sent back stories to the\nAmerican press that there were Jewish survivors of the Nazi\nNazi concentration camps living in Displaced Person's Camps\nunder the American army who's\u2019 living conditions were\nabominable. And that created quite a stir, evidently, in\nthe United States and President Turman as I said appointed\nthe Dean of the Law School of the University of of\nPennsylvania, Dean Earl G Harriman, Harrison , excuse me, to\numb examine the camps and to report to him to see whether or\nnot the reports of the umb war correspondent were accurate.\nUmb, Dean Harrison came to Europe and he was accompanied by\nDr. Joseph Jay Swartz who was a Euro European Head of",
        "Operations for the American Jewish Joint Distribution\nCommittee. And he visited the camps in Germany in the\nAmerican Zone and he came back to umb Washington and\nSubmitted his report. The uh report caused a number of\ncables to go from Washington to General Eisenhower's\nHeadguarters in Frankfurt. Uh first uh General Marshall who\nwas Chief of Staff got in touch with umb General Eisenhower\nand told him that he soon would be getting a summary of the\nreport of Dean uh Earl Harrison that it it was not a good\nreport that it did not put the American Army in a_= good\nlight. And then umb I believe it was on August the 10th,\nI'm certain of that date, August the 10th, General\nEisenhower got a cable from the Secretary of War, umb his\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH\nPage 9\nname was Secretary Stimpson who gave General Eisenhower a\nsummary of the umb Harrison Report and said that the Report\ncontained some very damaging descriptions of conditions in\nthe Displaced Person's camps administered by the American\nArmy and what did General Hisenhower expect to do to correct\nthe situation, but also told him that in do course he would\nbe receiving the entire Har ah Harrison report. Uh that uh",
        "report was a reason for the creation of a position that was\nrather unique in the History of the American Military. The\ncreation of an advisor to a Commanding General on Jewish\nconditions in the area of Command of the General. General\nEisenhower sent back a cable the day after he had received\nthe Stimpson cable to say that he was creating a position of\nAdvisor to General Eisenhower to himself on Jewish Affairs\nto be filled by an American Army Jewish Chaplin. And that\nwas the reason for my being order to uh fly from Paris where\nI had been stationed for about a year to Frankfurt to\nundertake my new responsibilities. Long pause\nSWB:\nJUDAH NADICH: One of the questions uh in my questionnaire\nthat I had prepared for myself before visiting any of the DP\ncamps was precisely that where did these people want to go\nassuming that there would be no barrier to going to lands\nthey had chosen. Between 70 and 75 per cent of them. said\nthey wanted to go to the country then known as Palestine.\nOthers chose other countries, United States, Canada,\nAustralia, countries in South America.

They had no funds, they didn't have\ndecent clothing on their backs. They were many of them weak\nbecause of malnutrition. And in addition, there was the\nobstacle of immigration laws that limited the number of\npeople that could arrive in any of these before mentioned\ncountries. Great Britain had been appealed to just uh a\nshort while before the time that about which I speak by\nPresident Truman to grant special visas to 100,000 of these\npeople. Great Britain didn't act upon General Truman's\nrequest. American immigrations lawS were strict and\npermitted for very small numbers to come from the lands of\nEFastern Europe. And most of people in the concentration\ncamps were Jews who had come from Eastern European Lands.\nSo there were all kinds of reasons for their not being able\nto go forthwith to go to the countries of their choice.\nSWB:\nJUDAH NADICH: I can't tell you about umb Bergen-Belsen I\ncan't answer that question because Bergenbelsen was under\nBritish Zone of Germany. I wasn't allowed into the British\nZone of Germany unless I requested special permission. I",
        "had more than enough to do with my responsibilities in the\nAmerican Zone of Germany. All that I can tell you in answer\nthat I question is that I had gotten requests uh from London\nfrom uh a number of leaders of the Jewish Community in that\ncity to send to them copies of the military orders creating\nby post and its duties to them in London so that they might\nrequest uh uh General Montgomery to create a similar\nposition that is Advisor to the Commanding General on Jewish\nAffairs for the British Zone of Germany.

These\nofficers frequently and their superiors that 1S captains and\nmajors above them had little knowledge what had transpired\nduring the years of the war and particularly no knowledge",
        "whatsoever as to what had happened to the Jews during the\nwar. For the most part, very few of them knew anything at\nall about the umb treatment the Jews by the Nazi's.\nI'm sorry to say that some of them uh had a little bit of\nanti-Semitism within them which was to have been expected.\nBecause members of the American Army were uh a broad cross\nsection of the American people. I think that in 1941, uh\nthe year that uh war was declared in the United States, in\nDecember of that year, there was far more anti-Semitism in\nthe United States than there is in 1995. There had been uh\nanti-semitic perchers and speakers on the radio, there was\nno television then, but on the radio, week in and week out.\nLike Father Coglin (?) Gerald L. K. Smith and others, and\nI'm sure that their words spoken week in and week out had an\neffect. So to come back to the subject, there was anti\nSemitism on the part of some if not all of American Military\nofficers and even more, there was little knowledge on their\npart and some cases they were doing a job that they didn't\nlike doing, that they didn't want to do because it wasn't\nstrictly speaking a military position, something that they\nhad expected when they entered the army. So very often, the\numb military men placed in charge of camps provided\nproblems. Mind you, some of them were good hearted people,\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.",
        "Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH\nPage 12\nand they tried to do what they thought was best, but they\nwere young men. They were dealing with people who not only\nhad suffered greatly under the Germans during World War II,\nbut who before the war, many of these survivors had _ been\nprominent people in their home cities. They were older\nmature people, and yet they were lorded over by perhaps a\nyoung lieutenant in his early twenties who thought that he\nknew what was best for them. In addition to this, I must say\nthat the orders that inundated from General Eisenhower's\nHeadquarters in Frankfurt were not always translated into\naction in the field. And that was a source of many\nproblems.\nSWB:\nLN: There were many Americans, many military Americans who\nwere of great help. And that should be underscored. There\nmany Americans who overlooked military regulations in order\nto help the survivors. In addition, the umb divisions that\nfirst liberated the camps, did everything that they possibly\ncould to help the strickened men and women and even some\nchildren whom they found in the concentration camps\u2019 that\nthey had liberated. I know that American army medical men\nand women worked around the clock to help save the lives of\nthe survivors in the concentration camps. Many of them they\ncould not save. They were too far gone and they died in the",
        "hands of their American rescuers, but doctors, Surgeons,\nnurses worked 24 hours a day after their units had captured\na concentration camp in order to help save the Jews\u2019 whom\nthey could possibly save. So all praise to them, and to the\nmany other American military people who helped saved the\nlives of many Jewish survivors. May I give you just one\ninteresting example. In Austria, Southberg, I called upon\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH\nPage 13\nthe G5, the officer in charge of civilian government in\noccupied countries.

But there weren't many like him.\nSWB:\nJUDAH NADICH: No they were not. And if I go back a little\nbit when I was still stationed in Paris. The uh Jewish\nunderground that had just begun to operate in conquered\nEurope and in liberated Europe, one of their leaders came to\nsee me and to say that there were about some six hundred",

Then I told him I would meet\nhim that very night on the railroad platform where the\nAmerican military train that ran between Paris and\nFrankfurt. I got there early at the railroad station and I\num Saw the uh American Captain in charge the train. He gave",

I gave it to him. He~= said,\nuh, well he was to sit in the Coach. I told the Captain\nthat this gentleman was a distinguished visitor who was\ncoming to General Eisenhower's Headquarters and it was not\nproper for him to sit up all night in the in a Coach. The\nCap the Captain asked me what I thought he should do. I\nsaid, \"I think you should the Major sharing that bedroom\nwith me that unfortunately a distinguished guest of General\nEisenhower had arrived to take the train for Frankfurt. And\nthat the major would have to leave the bedroom and take the\nseat in the Coach.\" That's what happened. And so Ben\nGurion and I occupied the bedroom on the train. And we\ntalked until about 2 o'clock in the morning as the train was\nriding while Ben-Gurion flied me with questions about\u2019 the\ndisplaced person's. We arrived in the morning at Frankfurt.\nI took him to Headquarter's. Introduced him to uh General\nWalter Beatle Smith, Chief of Staff. General Eisenhower was\naway on one of his many fieldtrips.

I had been there often before. We\nchatted awhile and suddenly one of them went over to the\ncar, looked inside and saw this man sitting in the _ back\nseat. He couldn't believe his eyes. He looked and then he\nscreamed, \"Ben-Gurion.\" And the others began to look. They\ntoo began screaming at this familiar face. To them it was\nunbelievable. That this man who was the Head of the Jewish\nAgency for Palestine, the Head of the umb the umb Government\nof the Jews, uh the substitute break government was there in\nZeilshyme???? their DP camp. And other Jews came running\nand I was afraid that a riot might ensue. So I quickly\ncalled them together.

Now you people run around the Camp, tell the\npeople to get together in the assembly hall. And they will\nhear Mr. Ben-Gurion then speak.\" They did that.

        ", the Hope, the national anthem in what\nwas then Palestine. And as they sang, they broke down into\ntears, and Mr. Ben-Gurion did and I did and eventually when\nthey could get back to it they finished singing and for the\nfirst time, for the first time, these people that had gone\nthrough years of hell, knew that they were free.

And\nthroughout his talk, there was sobbing, there were tears,\nand as the conclusion there were cheers. It waS a scene\nthat I shall never forget. And I'm sure that know one who\nwas there will ever forget. And when I met Mr. Ben-Gurion\nin the following years in Israel, he and I would often speak",
        "about that historic event in the assembly hall of the\nZeilshyme ????? DP camp. I then took Mr. Ben-Gurion back\nto American Army Headquarters and he very much wanted to\nvisited the DP camp's.

That\nnight Mr. Ben-Gurion and I met with the Committee of the\nJewish Leaders of the Zeislhyme??? camp that we had visited\nearlier in the day. Mr. Ben-Gurion fired questions at them,\ntrying to test their mettle, to see what they were made of.\nWhat did they really want, and I remember that he asked them\na question that I knew was not a real question. But he\nwanted to see how they would react. He asked them if the\nJewish Agency were to give orders for all the Jews of the DP\ncamps in Germany to walk out of their camps and to keep\nwalking until they crossed the boarders to Italy and _ to\nFrance, and to go to the Southern coast of Italy and France\nand board ships for Palestine, would you_ go? Would you\nfollow those orders? Despite the danger involved, you might\nbe shot at, you might beaten. Would you go? And they gave\nthe answer, that he had hoped for.

That gentleman was to arrive that same night and\nI was of course to meet him and to bring him to General\nEisenhower. That gentleman was Judge Simon H. Rifkins. I\nfinish with that.\nLong pause.\nJWB:\nJUDAH NADICH: The problem that inserted itself into the\nvery earliest consideration of how to take care of the\nJewish survivors was on of, who are the Jews? That is a\nguestion that has perplexed writers and authors for a_ long\ntime. Are they a religion, a people, a race, a nation?\nWell that question to the floor soon after the Jews had been\nliberated in the concentration camps and methods\u2019 were\nadopted that uh were uh aimed at relieving their plight.\nNow, uh the plans as I mentioned earlier drawn up by\nAmerican Military experts in civilian government were that\npeople of different nations were to be sent back to their\nnative lands within 90 days after the liberation of the",
        "concentration camps. The Jews, however, as I said earlier,\ndidn't want to go back, they couldn't back, they wouldn't go\nback. Now, when General Eisenhower was asked to appoint a\nLiaison Officer who would coordinate the work of helping the\nJewish survivors. He was asked to do this by the American\nrabbi, Steven S. Wise, who was in London the first days of\nAugust for a Zionist conference, the first to take place\nSince before World War II. The Zionist came from various\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH\nPage 22\ncountries, free countries, for the conference. Some us\nAmerican Military Chaplains got permission to go to London\nto attend the conference. We spoke with Rabbi Steven \u201cS.\nWise, one of the most prominent American Rabbi's of the\n1920's, the 1930's, the 1940's, as well as with other\nAmerican and other Jewish leaders about what we had seen of\nthe Jewish survivors. Rabbi Steven S. Wise sent a cable\nthrough the American Embassy in London to Army Headquarters\nin Frankfurt asking General Eisenhower to appoint a Liaison\nOfficer to coordinate the various efforts at helping the\nJewish survivors. That came to Army Headquarters at\nFrankfurt on the 7th day of August 1945. General Eisenhower",
        "replied on August 9th, two days later, saying he could not\nappoint a Jewish Liaison Officer. There were Liaison\nOfficer's at Eisenhower's Headquarters, but they\nrepresented, each one, a different nation. There waS a\nFrench Liaison Officer, there was British Liaison Officer, a\nPolish Liaison Officer, a Czech Liaison Officer, but the\nJews are not a nation. So he rejected Rabbi Wise's request.\nThe very next day on August th 10th, he got the cable from\nSecretary of War Stimpson, asking him what he was going to\ndo about the report from Dean Earl Harrison and its critical\nreport, the critical umb remarks about the American Army's\ncare of the Jewish survivors. So General Eisenhower replied\nthat he was going appoint an advisor on Jewish Affairs, not\na Liaison Officer, an Advisor. And on August 22nd he issued\nan order that despite the fact that Jews had come to\nconcentration camps with the nationality of their native\nlands, Polish nationality, Lithuanian nationality, whatever.\nThat they were now to be regarded as stateless people, and\ntherefore were to be put in concentration camps by\nthemselves with no other people with them, no other, no non-\nJews. So Hisenhower was able to bridge this gap, to answer\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH\nPage 23",
        "this problem by appointing an Advisor and to regard the Jews\nas \"stateless persons.\" Now General Montgomery, when he was\nasked by the leaders of the London Jewish Community to\nappoint an Advisor on Jewish Affairs, replied that he\ncouldn't. Because he then he would have to appoint a\nCatholic Advisor, and a Protestant Advisor, and therefore he\ndidn't appoint a Jewish Advisor. So the problem of \"who\nwere the Jews\" reared its head throughout the discussions of\nwhat to do with the Jewish survivors.\nJWB:\nlong pause\nJUDAH NADICH: General Eisenhower when he was made _ to\nunderstand what the problem was as a result of the Harrison\nReport and as a result of his own visiting the camps\nafterwards and you'll forgive me if I say as a result of the\nreports that I submitted to him of my visits to the DP\ncamp's. At once acted, speedily, to remedy the problem. I\ncan say, frankly and honestly, that there was not a\nrecommendation that I made to him to improve the lot of the\nJewish survivors in the DP camp's that he did not address\naffirmative, at once. By issuing an order to rectify the\nSituation. I uh call you attention particularly to the fact\nthat hundreds, thousands of Jews, were coming into the\nAmerican Zone of Germany from Poland, in particular, and\nfrom other Eastern lands. These were Jews in many cases, in\nmost cases, who when Russia entered the war had been",
        "uprooted from their homes and their cities and cou and\ntowns. And trucked back of the Russian lines all the way to\nAsiatic Russia, in order to keep them out of the battle\nzones. Now they were brought back by the Russians to their\nformer homes only to find that their homes had been taken by\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH\nPage 24\ntheir neighbors as well as their visitor's. They didn't\nwant to live there anyhow in those in those countries' where\ntheir families had been destroyed. So they began moving at\nfirst on their own, across across the\nS EF borders, from Poland into Czechoslovakia,\nfrom Czechoslovakia into Austria, from Austria into the\nAmerican Zone of Germany. The guestion was, \"what to do\nwith them?\" Technically speaking, they were not defined as\nDP's. DP's according to army regulations on the orders,\nrather, were Jewish survivors found in concentration camps\non German soil or on Austrian soil and who where then placed\nin DP camps in Germany and Austria. So these Jews arriving\nfrom Poland and Baltic countries were technically not DP's.\nWhat to do with them? They were coming across the borders\nand soon questions started coming into Hisenhower's office.",
        "Uh we discussed the matter, I recommended that they be\nadmitted to our DP camps which eventually would be emptied.\nAnd they would go to other countries. And Eisenhower issued\nan order saying that they were to be admitted and I don't\nknow exactly how many were saved in this fashion. But I\nthink it have been 80,000 Jews. On the other hand,\nMontgomery turned back such Jews as they tried to enter\nBritish Zone of Germany and issued orders that they were to\nbe turned back by force. But you see the contrast between\nEisenhower and Montgomery.\nLong pause.\nWhat does what does he shoot when he.....\nJWB:\nJUDAH NADICH: Hmmmmm......General Patton commanded the\nThird Army which had the supervision of most of the DP\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH\nPage 25\ncamps. The Third Army was in charge of all of Bavaria and\none of the first complaints given by the Jews in uh Bavaria,",
        "particularly in Zeldezing??? but also elsewhere was\u2019 that\nthey were not allowed to leave the camp as they would like.\nBut only a small percentage would be permitted to leave each\nday with a pass system. And they objected to that because\ndespite the fact that they were now liberated, they still\ndidn't enjoy freedom to come and =<4go. They could look\noutside of the con the DP camp and see the Germans, the\nthe former enemies of the Americans walking freely, but they\nthe victims of the Germans whom the American's had liberated\nwere not free to come and go as they please. And of course\nthey objected vehemently to the barbed wire around the DP\ncamp. It reminded them of the barbed wire around the German\nconcentration camp. And one of their first requests to me\nwas to try to do something to have the barbed wire removed\nand the pa pass system abolished. That was incorporated in\nmy report to General Eisenhower through General Smith and\norders were issued to have the pass system abolished and the\nbarbed wire removed. Well, next I west from Frankfurt to\nBavaria, to visit the DP camps, Zeld in particular as\nwell as Lansberg and the other camps. The barbed wires was\nstill there and the pass system was still in existence. I\ncame back to Frankfurt and I reported in due course to\nGeneral Walter Beatle Smith, General Eisenhower's Chief of\nStaff. I visited him, I reported to him most of the time\nbecause General Eisenhower was often on field visits to the\ntroops and General Smith would then report to EHisenhower\nwhen he returned.

And his highly polished belt and straps. And I\nguickly beat a retreat. He glared at me and I knew what was\nhealthy for me...I got out of there. Afterwards, General\nSmith told me that General Eisenhower asked General Patton,\n\"George, why aren't you doing something for those Jews?\"\nAnd Patton, thinking that he was talking to his old West\nPoint buddy said, ina half laughter, \"Why the hell should\nI?\" And, Eisenhower replied, with anger, \u201cWell, goddamit,\nand for no other reason...and because I have ordered you to\nhelp those Jews.\" Not long afterwards, General Patton was\nremoved from command of the Third Army and he was ordered to\ncommand the 15th Army which consisted only of a Headquarters\nwithout troops.

I know that books about Patton and the movie about\nPatton showed that he was ordered out of the Third Army\nbecause, supposedly he slapped a soldier in a military\nhospital in Sicily for malingering??? But, to my mind,\nthere has always been a question. \"Why was Patton punished\na couple of years latter for something he had done in\nSicily?\" My own thought is that he was punished because he\nhad transgressed, he had violated a direct order from a\nSuperior officer which is something that an American Army\nSoldier knows he must not do.\nSWB:\nJUDAH NADICH: See, I no longer was acting as a chaplin, once\nI was assigned to the post of Advisor to Eisenhower.

Uh, the orders of General Eisenhower had\ntaken a long time, but eventually they filtered down to all\nthe lower levels and they were being carried out. The dp\nthe Jewish DP's were in separate camps now. They were\ngetting more food, better housing, clothing, shoes. They\neven got soccer balls and musical instruments, and even\nYiddish newspapers from the United States and books in\nYiddish and in German and in French that they could read and\nunderstand. Umb, in addition, they had organized\nthemselves, the Jewish survivors. They were for many of\nthem, very capable people. They had been leaders of\ncommunities in their home towns before the war had started.\nThere was this excellent organization, the Central Committee\nof Liberated Jews in Munich. And in every camp there was a\nCommittee of Jewish DP leaders. And for the time I went\nhome, the situation was far improved over what I had seen in\njust two and a half months earlier.
