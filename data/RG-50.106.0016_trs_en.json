        "Question: The following is an interview of Ivan Becker. It is taking place on January 18th,\n1995. It is being conducted in Washington, D.C. on behalf of the United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum.\nCould you please give us your full name.",
        "Answer: Becker, Ivan.",
        "Q: And your middle name?",
        "A: Endre.",
        "Q: Where were you born?",
        "A: In Budapest on June 14, 1929.",
        "Q: Let's begin about your -- talking about your childhood. Who made up your family?",
        "A: My family was made up from my mother and father, Coto and Desha (phonetic) Becker. My\nfather was an accountant in a factory manufacturing cigarette paper called Modino,\nM-O-D-I-N-O. My mother was a homemaker.\nWe were pretty much middle class people. We didn't have a car, but we did have a maid who\nlived with us. And my father, as was normal in the Thirties and Forties, worked and came home\nfor lunch in the afternoon, went back to work, and came home quite late. So the family was\nreally together mostly in the middle of the day and in the evenings. As I said, we were not well\nto do at all, but we had a nice life, basically enjoying music and theater, movies.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nFrom the early Thirties on, I went to school in Budapest and was elementary school for four\nyears and --",
        "Q: Was this a public school or private?",
        "A: It was a public school. It was a public school. I was also a boy scout. Reason for bringing\nthat one out, that it became a segregated -- in spite of all the boy scout vows, it was a segregated\ntroop, only Jews. And after 1938 or so, even the elementary school was segregated, Jews in one\nclass, Christians in the other classes.",
        "Q: Yeah, we'll get to 1938 in a moment. Let's move back a little bit. Did you live right in town?",
        "A: Yes. We lived -- well, up to about maybe 4 or 5 years old we were in the suburbs, what\nwould be termed in a garden apartment today. And then we moved into town when I guess it\ncame to -- time to go to school.",
        "Q: Did you live in a private house or an apartment in town?",
        "A: We were in a large, large apartment house.",
        "Q: What kind of neighborhood was it? Was it mixed with Jews and non-Jews?",
        "A: It was primarily a Jewish neighborhood. It was a newer part of town, but it was totally\nintegrated basically.",
        "Q: So you had non-Jewish friends and neighbors to play with --",
        "A: [had --",
        "Q: -- as well as Jews?",
        "A: Yes. Because of classmates lived all over town, not just in the district, my friends came from\nmostly from the apartment house. And they were both Jews and Christian.",
        "Q: Was there any problem when you were very young about treatment of your friends?",
        "A: The only problem that we --\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: I'm talking about when you were younger.",
        "A: All right. I mean, we're talking about the first --",
        "Q: Few years or so.",
        "A: -- Jewish laws coming in in 1938 when I was 9 years old.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so until then there was no discrimination.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And even after that, at least amongst friends, we had no problems.",
        "Q: Yeah. So you moved into town you said because of the school.",
        "A: I'm assuming that's why my father changed.",
        "Q: Yeah. How religious was your family?",
        "A: The family was not religious at all. We -- I think we were Hungarian -- I know we were\nHungarians first and Jews second.",
        "Q: Did you observe any holidays at home, Jewish holidays at home?",
        "A: The only high holidays -- we observed the high holidays, primarily because my uncle, my\nmother's brother, was more religiously oriented. He was in Israel in the Twenties, came back to\nHungary in '29, and then stayed there. And so we used to go to their house for the high holidays.",
        "Q: But within your own home?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Within our own home we were not religious, although it was mandatory to have religion in\nschool. And once a week we had to go to synagogue, and so learning Hebrew was part of it.\nBar mitzvah was another part of 1t, which was orthodox because that was the only thing -- only\nreligion, Jewish religion that was available. There was no -- in those days there was no reformed\ntemples. So I remember being bar mitzvahed in an orthodox one, which later on in our story\ncomes out --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- I found much later.",
        "Q: Okay. We'll talk about that. Did you have any hobbies? I know you had mentioned that\nyour family was interested in music.",
        "A: Well, yes.",
        "Q: Any other interests besides school?",
        "A: I loved to play soccer. I was beginning to be a pretty good photographer when I was about\n12. Iloved to read. I was a lousy student.\nBut basically I liked certain subjects and excelled in those. And what I didn't like I didn't excel\nin at all, which really was the way I've -- the rest of my life turned out. I enjoy certain things and\nI was good at it, but other than that I didn't work very hard.",
        "Q: When you played soccer, were you playing with non-Jewish children also?",
        "A: Yes. Soccer, hockey, water polo.",
        "Q: Right. And no -- and --",
        "A: There was a total integration in the area, so there was really no -- I don't remember any even\nlatent discrimination.",
        "Q: Do you remember your father talking about any of that --\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- work wise?",
        "A: Iremember my father talking about politics. I remember that when the German troops took\nover Hungary, my father was throwing out social democratic newspapers and so that if there was\na search they wouldn't find it because it was unacceptable. But other than that, I don't think that\nhe was aware of any -- and I know that he had coworkers that we have seen socially that were\nChristian.",
        "Q: Did you have a large extended family, aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents?",
        "A: I had about probably four or five family members who were really family. There was an\nextended acquaintanceship, friends of the family. But the aforementioned uncle, his wife and\ntwo children were really the only relatives that we had in Budapest. That was on my mother's\nside.\nOn my father's side everybody was in Transylvania in two towns -- actually maybe three, but one\nis Nagyvarad, which is Oradea today, Cluj, which was Kolozsvar, and Otog (phonetic) was the\nthird town where my father's family was traced basically. They kind of moved around. There\nwas a substantial -- there was a -- an uncle, my father's brother, my father's mother and father.",
        "Q: Did you go to visit these relatives?",
        "A: I did go to visit them on school holidays usually in the summertime. One of the family\nmembers had a vineyard in Nagyvarad, and I stayed there in a vineyard most of the summer.\nI remember visiting there even in the wintertime because I'm remembering trying to kill myself\non a sled, some ridiculous places with a bunch of my cousins and other kids. And that probably\ngoes back to around 19 -- 1938, '39, 1937.",
        "Q: What language did you speak at home?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Only Hungarian.",
        "Q: So that's the only language you --",
        "A: Only language spoken. We did not speak Yiddish. We were not -- we were not\nvery -- because of the religious orientation, we also didn't know anybody who was religious, and\nso the assimilated ones would not speak Yiddish even if they could. And I don't think my\nparents could. My uncle did and could.",
        "Q: All right. Let's now start to talk about when you noticed a change in your life. What was the\nfirst memory or experience that you can recall? 1938?",
        "A: 1938 when the first Jewish restriction -- restrictive laws came in. And that was --",
        "Q: You were only 9 years old.",
        "A: I was 9 years old.",
        "Q: What do you remember from that?",
        "A: I was aware of the fact that the proclamation that Jews can now not do certain things and they\ncan only do certain things in terms of jobs.",
        "Q: How did you know that at 9 years old?",
        "A: I guess reading it and listening to my parents talking about it. Radio.",
        "Q: Were you frightened on hearing this?",
        "A: No. We were not frightened. And strangely enough, in 1938 -- well, my grandmother, my\nfather's mother from Transylvania, went out to her two daughters in America, supposedly for the\nworld's fair in 1938, and she stayed behind. And in 1938 --",
        "Q: Stayed in the United States?",
        "A: Stayed in the United States, never went back. My grandfather was dead by that time, and so\nshe stayed with her two daughters in New York.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nThe -- the husband of one of the daughters sent us an affidavit that would have enabled us, my\nfather, my mother and I, to immigrate to America. But I remember my father worrying about the\nfact that he is -- at that time was 40 -- '38 -- 41, 41, 42 years old, the fact that he didn't speak any\nEnglish. He did not want to -- he found that he could not get a job. And he was not worried too\nmuch about the restrictions because they were fairly light, it didn't touch him. His job was not of\nthat level. And he felt that because he was in the -- in the Army during the first world war and\nhe was an officer and he was decorated that they're not going to touch him. And so he decided\nnot to take advantage of this affidavit.\nAs I mentioned, he was in the first world war. He fought on the Italian front and also on the\nRussian front. He was in the infantry in Italy and he was an aerial observer on the Russian front.\nI'm bringing this up because I have the -- I have his pictures from those times, which 1s the few\nthings that were left. And so the decision was made essentially to stay behind. And as things got\nworse and worse in terms of the restrictions --",
        "Q: Well, let's talk about how these restrictions applied to you and your family.",
        "A: The first -- if I remember correctly, the first thing that I personally felt was the segregation in\nschool. So I remember the first two years of elementary school we were integrated.",
        "Q: How old were you when you started school?",
        "A: I was 7.",
        "Q: 7. Okay.",
        "A: It was 1936.",
        "Q: '36.",
        "A: And '38 and '39 got more and more restrictive.",
        "Q: Separating Jews from non-Jews?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Separated the Jews from non-Jews ina class. Also --",
        "Q: Were you angry?",
        "A: I don't remember being angry. I -- I remember being --",
        "Q: Puzzled?",
        "A: Not -- authority was always paramount in Hungary and government authority was, so\nessentially the government could do most anything that they wanted you to be or wanted you to\ndo, and so the acceptance was there. And I think that there was maybe a relief that, well, it's not\nso bad, we can live with this.\nSome people stayed behind because of that kind of a belief, and some tried to immigrate at that\npoint because they believed that things are going to get worse and worse.\nMy family wouldn't believe how bad things would be later on. So there was no anger. There\nwas acceptance. It was the law, so we got segregated.",
        "Q: Did you still see these children outside of school, or was it segregation in playing also?",
        "A: No, the segregation was really in school and in -- in the -- even in the boy scout troop which\nwas split up into families so-called of four or five children. The -- the Jewish kids had one or\ntwo of the families, and the rest of them were the Christian. And we played together and we\nwere boy scouts together. And I believe I remember as a boy scout marching when Lord\nBaden-Powell came to Budapest. And it will be interesting to find it, whether he in fact did and\ndid I remember it correctly, but I seem to remember a story that he told us over the megaphone\nthat he had, I believe, scarlet fever as an adult. The reason for that was that God looked down\nand saw this person in short pants and said he did not have scarlet fever yet, so give it to him.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNow, the story is basically that we did not have long pants as boy scouts. I mean, we were -- as\nchildren we had short pants. Nobody had long pants. Winter or summer we had short pants, and\nthis was the gist of that story. Whether I read it or it's memory, it's hard to tell, but I remember\nparading with all the scouts from all over Hungary in one of the stadium, soccer stadiums.",
        "Q: You would have been how old then?",
        "A: Probably 8, 9, 10, thereabouts.",
        "Q: Okay. The first you said was segregation within school.",
        "A: In class.",
        "Q: Inclass. And then next?",
        "A: Second one, the boy scouts.",
        "Q: Boy scouts.",
        "A: Then subsequent laws mandated that the men go into service, into the labor brigades. That\nmust have been around 1940. I'm not clear on it. My father was drafted into this, but because he\nhad a medal for -- a bronze medal for heroism during the first world war, he went in as a\ncompany commander and was in for -- my guess is for a couple of years.",
        "Q: Okay. He was taken away to another location?",
        "A: He was taken away to another location where we could visit him on occasion.",
        "Q: What was your feelings when he left? Was that --",
        "A: I think there was anxiety, but then there was acceptance. Again, it was not -- there was\nworry, I remember. There was fear. There was no anger that I was aware of. Acquiescence\nreally what came into being at that point.",
        "Q: Did he say anything special to you when he left? Do you remember anything specific?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: No. It was very matter of fact. I knew he was going to be an officer, and I guess it was\nexpected. He did not really talk to me about it. My communication with him was loving but not\nformal necessarily, but except for the weekends didn't see much of him.\nMy mother and I were always together. But I basically remember the good relationship with my\nfather, a loving relationship. He was a very nice person. So --",
        "Q: So you knew where he was being sent?",
        "A: I was -- I knew where he was -- well, I knew that he went in but not where he was going to\nbe sent. But then he came -- then he was communicating with us and told us where he was.",
        "Q: How did he communicate with you, by letter?",
        "A: Letters and telephone call, uh-huh. And so we knew where he was and we went visiting.\nThere was visiting privileges.",
        "Q: What kind of conditions was he living under?",
        "A: I think as an officer he had quite good conditions. And even in those days the labor brigade\nitself was fairly well treated. It was early, early on. That evolved into -- as further laws came in,\nhe was discharged for a period of time and then drafted back but into the brigade itself.\nBy that time you had to have a high rank or many more medals to remain an officer. And so he\nwent back into -- and essentially, this is a period of two or three years, they traveled around and\nwe heard from him sometime but he never came home and we never could visit, to the best of\nmy recollection.",
        "Q: When your father left, it was you and your mother. How did you manage -- how did your\nmother manage financially?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Iam not sure. I know we have help. We had help from some people, money help. She\neventually had to discharge the maid, and just mother and I were in the same apartment where\nwe had always been. But she picked up and started making small jewelry from pearls and was\nselling it. At the same time, I was also going to -- well, we're talking about now -- we skipped a\ncouple of years where nothing much happened except things got tighter and the laws came in.",
        "Q: What other ways?",
        "A: Further restrictions.",
        "Q: On you what were they?",
        "A: On us in terms of --",
        "Q: Was it curfew?",
        "A: Curfew, when we could go out, when we had to be home.",
        "Q: What were you --",
        "A: I was not able to go to school anymore. I went to gymnasium, and I was no longer able to go\nto gymnasium because of the curfews.",
        "Q: What were the time curfews? You couldn't get home in time? Was that the problem?",
        "A: No, I think that the restriction was from 10:00 in the morning till 4:00 in the afternoon we\nwere able to get out. But then eventually that got tighter, like only in the afternoon that we were\nable to get out, out of the house.",
        "Q: How did you feel as a young boy being restricted to your house like that?",
        "A: I think there was a great deal of resentment. It was troubling because we knew that\nthe -- there were certain actions taken against Jews. We heard of beating, et cetera, because we\nhad to wear the yellow star, so --",
        "Q: When did you start wearing your yellow star?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: I can't remember the date. It was -- I am only guessing that it was kind of 1940, 1941,\nthereabouts.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was part of the restrictions.",
        "Q: How did you like wearing a yellow star?",
        "A: I was -- [remember being very upset about it. First of all, I didn't like -- I didn't like to be\nlabeled and stand out from a group, from the rest of the world. I did not like to be picked on, as\nit were, because it was too easy to pick us off the street when the Nazis wanted to do it.\nAlthough I think that I'm skipping a little bit ahead because up to March of 1944, so I'm skipping\nabout two years of mounting difficulties of getting food, of getting money. I was also going to\ngymnasium at that time and I was in the fourth year of gymnasium. And I mentioned I was a\nrather poor student. And I made a deal with the professor, who was the class supervisor, I guess,\nthat because of my mathematical inability, I would not come back to the fifth year and he would\nlet me graduate on the fourth year. Before graduation, however, which would have been in May\nor June, March 19 the Germans marched in. And so that effectively ended school career\ncompletely.\nFrom that point on I did some smuggling to go into the provinces -- well, going out of town, they\ncall it the suburbs, by bus and train and trade for some meats and cold cuts, bring it back into\ntown and trade it for food --",
        "Q: How did you know --",
        "A: -- or other staples.",
        "Q: How did you know how to do this?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: I don't remember. I remember that I had a little backpack and I went out and picked up some\nsausages and salami and such and I brought it back, and I believe my mother was able to either\nsell it or trade it.",
        "Q: You did this by yourself?",
        "A: I did it by myself with the knowledge that if I get caught for smuggling, then I would be\nkilled.",
        "Q: Were you wearing your star while you were doing this?",
        "A: I believe so.",
        "Q: While you were doing it?",
        "A: I believe so. I pretty much had to at that point. It's a little bit fuzzy, but I remember that for\nsome reason one of the pack full of sausages smelled terribly, and how anybody could miss me\nthat I was smuggling it, I never could understand. So my smuggling days came to an end at that\npoint because it was becoming too dangerous.\nAnd I also was able to get a job 1n a printing plant as an apprentice. My uncle, who was still\nliving in Budapest at that time, was a graphic artist, quite well known, specialty placards for\ndisplay purposes and advertising, and he had connections with a rather large printing company\ncalled Globus, which 1s still in existence as of 1994. And I went to there as an apprentice in the\nphoto engraving section of the printing shop. And this happened after 19 -- March of 1944, so\nthis must have been in later part of March, April, May, June, July. I would -- go ahead.",
        "Q: Yeah, I just wanted to back up a little bit before spring of '44. Tell me about your\nbar mitzvah. You said you did have one, and that would have been in 1942.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: June of '42.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: The -- my bar mitzvah was in the neighborhood nearby where I lived. The -- it was in an\northodox temple. It was an orthodox bar mitzvah to the point where men, women were\nseparated. As usual, I was not a very good Hebrew student, so everything was written out for me\nphonetically in Hungarian, which later on will be -- will have a connection to something else that\nwent on many years later.\nIt was a family affair. I remember my mother serving little cakes called minion from Gerbeaud,\nwhich was one of the best --",
        "Q: Bakery?",
        "A: -- bakeries, sweetshops, still in existence. The family was, and friends. We didn't have too\nmany people that came over, but it was largely a family affair and mostly grownups. I only\nremember my cousins being there, no other child. And it certainly was not a fancy deal at all.\nIt's just we went to the temple, had the bar mitzvah, came home, and --",
        "Q: Was everybody wearing --",
        "A: -- had people in.",
        "Q: Was everybody wearing their stars at the time?",
        "A: I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't -- I have -- the only picture that I have of myself\nwith a star was taken in 1944, so Iam not sure. It's something I ought to find out. I believe that\nthe stars were put -- had to be put on after the Germans took over in March of 1944.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: I am pretty sure of that. So until then there was no major identification problem. And\nalthough I said it before, I don't know if we actually had curfews before that. I suspect it was in\n1944 that the curfews started at the insistence of the Germans, because Hungary was --",
        "Q: Was an ally of Germany.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: It was an ally of Germany but was not occupied and was a reluctant ally, if you will. They\ntried to survive. The Germans were fighting in Russia.",
        "Q: You were explaining about the Hungarian situation being an ally of Germany.",
        "A: Right. And the -- after -- in March or thereabouts of 1944, the Hungarians tried to\nmake -- pull out of the alliance and wanted to make a separate peace with the west. It was very\nimpractical because we were -- certainly the Germans were west of us, and the Germans\nwere -- well, all over us, all around us, but they clearly felt that to have Hungary as an\nindependent, hostile country would threaten their efforts in Russia and their -- threaten their\nsupply lines, so they were compelled to occupy the country.",
        "Q: Did you ever see Admiral Horthy --",
        "A: I have seen him.",
        "Q: -- at that time?",
        "A: I have seen him certainly in magazines and -- but not in person.",
        "Q: Did you or your -- how did you and your mother hear about what was happening in the rest\nof Europe at that time, in 1942, 1943, or did you know?",
        "A: We knew what was happening. We had a radio and it was capable of listening to the BBC,\nwhich was against -- I mean, punishable by death if they catch you do it. But the --",
        "Q: So that was another restriction.",
        "A: That was another restriction that you -- you actually had to hand in any fancy radio which\nwas capable of short wave reception. But we had a radio which was a simple one, and my father\ndidn't hand it in, and so we listened to it at night with the windows closed and the shades drawn.",
        "Q: You and your mother?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: My mother and he when he was home. We did listen to it, and so we were aware of the war\nin general.",
        "Q: Did your family have to turn in any jewelry, any valuables?",
        "A: I believe they had to turn in jewelry, I believe along with the radios. And I'm not sure of\nanything else that had to be at that point given up by us. We had no car, so there was no\nproblem.\nBut in reminiscing back into the '38, kind of interesting memories that the -- the future Pope\ncame to Hungary in 1938, which was the thousandth year of -- of the Catholic conversion of\nHungary. And his name was Pacelli at that time. I saw him because we had friends on the -- on\nthe Danube and he came by boat and I saw him within a hundred yards of him coming. He\nultimately, of course, didn't help the Jews all that much. He was rather working with the\nGermans as we found out much later.\nBut childhood was fairly normal going to summertime the swimming pools to playing soccer,\nbicycling all over the town.",
        "Q: This is even in '42, '43?",
        "A: This is even then, even then.",
        "Q: So up till spring of --",
        "A: Growing up without any restrictions of that type. And I don't believe that I had to give up\nmy bicycle because I had it in 1944, so I'm assuming that I --",
        "Q: Before spring '44, did any -- did you yourself have any anti-Semitic incidents happen\npersonally on the street to you by other people?",
        "A: Once in awhile we were called a dirty Jew, something like that --",
        "Q: And how did you respond --\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: -- in the street.",
        "Q: -- or did you?",
        "A: With shock but no response, no fighting back. The -- I guess we knew it was -- it was\nwidespread enough because of the laws and because of the shops being -- signs that this was a\nJewish shop and only Jews go in here and in some cases, so there was no real fighting spirit left\nin us, but --",
        "Q: Did you talk among your friends, your -- other boys your age about what was happening?",
        "A: Not that Iremember. I remember some of them were Christian, and so we did not talk about\nreligion. I had a -- my little girlfriend was Christian. That family will come up later. So\nthe -- and it was a -- it was really expected by our parents that we probably going to end up\nmarried at one day. But -- so I'm not aware of any discrimination.\nOne of them -- one of my friends who I have pictures with became a conductor, world renowned,\nthat we played with. He was half Christian, but his father's mother, so somewhere along in the\nbackground there was one family that was Jewish, but he was basically Christian and he survived\nas a Christian.\nSo there was nothing -- there was no Kristallnacht and there was no beatings that I have seen on\nthe street, although we heard, clearly.",
        "Q: So you yourself never witnessed?",
        "A: We were never -- I have not witnessed anything like that until the end of '44 --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- when things got real sticky. So the normalcy, from a normal childhood into a more\nrestricted one was gradual. It was not cataclysmic. It was difficult only from a financial point of\nview and the fact that my father was not there.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Okay. Now it's spring of '44.",
        "A: Spring of 1944, I remember that the school class, I was still in the fourth gymnasium. The\nname of the gymnasium was Berzsenyi Daniel Gimnazium, which is a state gymnasium or high\nschool where I spent four years. And in spring of '44, in March of '44 we went on a class outing,\nand it was on March 19th. And the day -- and we were coming back from the outskirts of\nBudapest. Our bus broke down, and so we walked. We had to walk the rest of the way. And we\nsaw in the -- over the town, over Budapest, the German dive bombers diving, going up, diving,\nnot dropping bombs, just scaring people. And we didn't know what was going on. And when we\ngot back to Budapest, the German army was marching in. And --",
        "Q: You saw them?",
        "A: -- that scared us, yes. That was the first time that I really felt fear.",
        "Q: When you saw the uniforms?",
        "A: When I saw the Germans, yeah.",
        "Q: You went back to school right away, or did you all go home? Do you remember?",
        "A: No, I went back to school --",
        "Q: What did you --",
        "A: -- wearing the star.",
        "Q: What did your teachers say?",
        "A: They said nothing. They were mostly -- except one, who was our Latin professor, most of\nthem were old people, old being their 50s and 60s and in some cases I would guess the 70s.\nThey did not discriminate against us. They were teaching our class much like any other class. I\ndon't remember any of them making any anti-Semitic statements.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nBut sometime in the spring of '44 we were no longer allowed to go to school, allowed to go out.\nSo that's when I went to the printing factory.",
        "Q: What do you mean not allowed to go out?",
        "A: The restrictive times.",
        "Q: You had special --",
        "A: Going out except certain periods 1n time --",
        "Q: Except for curfew, right.",
        "A: -- ina day, and certainly not at night. I think after 4:00 we had to be in the houses. And the\nhouses eventually had Jewish stars on them.\nAnd some of them were mixed. Our house was mixed because it was a double-sized apartment\nhouse and the first half was Christian and the second half was Jewish. And the Jews moved from\nthe first half into the second half of the house.",
        "Q: But you stayed in your --",
        "A: We stayed in our apartment, and we did not have -- we had a boarder at that time, a woman,\nand so we did not have to take in anybody else.",
        "Q: A Jewish woman?",
        "A: A Jewish woman. Because I went to work in this printing house and the --",
        "Q: This is at the age of 15?",
        "A: At the age of 15. And we were printing German army magazines as well as the equivalent of\nLife magazine, for instance.",
        "Q: What was it like to work for an organization that printed German army magazines? Bother\nyou?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: It didn't bother me. It gave me the opportunity to wear an armband that let me move freely\naround outside of the times that -- the restrictions, the curfew.",
        "Q: What did the armband look like?",
        "A: It was the Hungarian flag. And at a certain point again, within a few weeks of the Germans\ncoming in, we were no longer allowed to go home at night, so I slept in the -- in the printing\nplace and worked at my job. I got some money for it all day long, and then I took another job\npacking the magazines and loading cars with -- trucks with it, which was extra money.\nMy mother -- my mother at that time was by herself in the apartment and was able to bring me\nfood once a day, so I saw her. And that system went on and I was able to go home once in\nawhile because of the armband that allowed me to move outside of curfew.",
        "Q: Was this a very frightening time for you?",
        "A: It was, because we were not only restricted in movement and feared really for our lives when\nwe were out or even in the home, but we were also being bombed by the Americans as well as\nthe British. So that was really the beginning of the really tough times because by that time food\nshortage, also death was easy to come by because of the bombings which were quite heavy.",
        "Q: What did you do when bombing raids came?",
        "A: Usually the sirens went off and went down into the cellars, which were reinforced.\nAnd on May 2nd there was a particularly heavy bombing raid where -- where I was in a printing\nplant, was -- and that neighborhood was hit fairly heavily, so we felt the earth shake and the dust\nand it was rather scary.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnd after the raid was over, I went home and found that the one half of the house was also\nbombed. And our apartment was basically blown out. The walls and the doors and the windows\nwere blown out so that we couldn't stay up in the apartment, but had to move down a few floors\nand moved in with a family including our furniture.\nAnd so we lived there basically until we were finally taken away, but -- so that -- and shortly\nafter that May bombing, it became quite unsafe to be in the printing place, so I essentially moved\nback home. And --",
        "Q: What was happening to your father during this time?",
        "A: My father, we didn't know -- we didn't know where he was or what was happening to him.\nThere was no communication at that point that I can recall, not until much later. So it was\nstrictly my mother and I trying to make a go of it.",
        "Q: So what did you do during the day? What was the day like when you moved back with your\nmother?",
        "A: During the -- during the curfew I was out and I visited friends. And I remember one\nparticular time that -- again, my recollection is that we had curfew in the morning and then we\nhad to be home and then curfew opened 1n the afternoon again. And I went off to a friend's\nhouse, and I didn't call my mother that I am not coming home until later in the afternoon. And\nwhen I showed up, of course, she was out of her mind and got a real severe spanking for scaring\nher, which I could understand. But at that time I guess I was not frightened of what could be\nhappening to me, so I did not think that I should call her. But that was quite clear in my mind\nwhat happened then.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nBut we have played with friends in the house, and so except for the curfew when we went out\nand had to stand in line for food. We had ration stamps. We had to go out to find -- try to find\nsome bread and -- which was by that time made from rice flour because wheat was no longer\navailable. And there were shortages of food, meat only once in a great while, very little sugar,\nvery little staple food available.\nAnd certainly during the curfew times, of course, all the Jews were out and trying to find the\nshops that had something. And sometimes the lines were long and the curfew came so you had\nto go home empty-handed, which was difficult.",
        "Q: What was your health like at that time?",
        "A: I was not aware of being underfed, particularly. I remember that bananas and oranges were\nsomething that I remembered from early childhood and I was really -- would have loved to have\nsome. I think that bananas to this day has a significance because I remember eating it as a child.",
        "Q: But your health was okay?",
        "A: But my health was okay. So was my mother's. We were in reasonably good shape. As the\nsummer wore on, things got tighter and the bombing got worse, and --",
        "Q: Did you -- did you see any deportations during the summer?",
        "A: I believe that I was aware of the fact that the -- my father's family was deported, was taken\naway from Transylvania. I don't think it was called deportation. I was not aware of it. I\nremember hearing people receiving postcards from various places in Germany, I believe, or\nPoland with stamps saying that we're okay, we're working, et cetera. And of course that was a\nsham we found out many, many years later. So the awareness that they were killing the people,\nwe did not have the awareness.",
        "Q: Did you see people in Budapest being taken away? Did you ever witness that?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: No, because Budapest was not really --",
        "Q: The summer.",
        "A: Summer of '44 was still reasonably safe. No one was deported because the Germans\nconcentrated on the 400,000 in the provinces.",
        "Q: In the provinces, right.",
        "A: And so we did not see any of it. What we did see, of course, later on when they started\ndeporting people from Budapest, but that's not until September, October.",
        "Q: Okay. So the summer went on.",
        "A: The summer went on. Again, staying alive because of bombings was paramount. We spent\nan awful lot of time down in the cellars. We really --",
        "Q: What did you do when you were down in the cellar?",
        "A: Kind of sat around in the dark and hoped that the bomb is not going to hit us. We were\nacross the street from the western railroad station, and so we were in a prime target area. And\nwhen in May the bombing finally got our house, it was a fluke because the Americans were\nfairly accurate. Their system was -- is to send 1n an aircraft and to circle the target area with\nsmoke in the sky. And the bomber stream unloaded into that circle, saturation bombing.\nThe May that we got it but the railroad station didn't, the wind took that circle and we got\nclobbered. So the raids were pretty regular. Around 10:00 at night they started, so by 20 of\n10:00 we were down in the cellars expecting it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnd I was working as a -- well, my doctor, my pediatrician was the head of the volunteer\nambulance corps in Budapest. And after my stint in the printing place, I asked him -- I suppose I\nhad to ask him to see if I can get trained as a first aid person. And I went through a course with\nadults, being the youngest to graduate from that course, and so I was a full-fledged first aid type.\nAnd as such, I did not go down to the cellar until the bombs came awfully close.\nWe were also fire guards. We were 15, so we didn't like the basement. It was a horrible place to\nbe. And so my poor mother scared out of her wits for me, but I was all over the house and\nwatching for the aircraft to come and the antiaircraft trying to shoot them down. And when a\nbomb started whistling too close, then we ran down. So I really did not spend that much time in\nthe cellars, ever really. I felt it was better to die up there than not.\nOne of the things that also happened in the -- after we had to wear the yellow star, that the\nVatican curia I guess made an arrangement with the Nazis, the Hungarian Nazi government, that\nif a Jew converted, then they would wear a different color, I think it was either white or yellow\nor just white armband, and they would be basically exempt from the curfew or from the\ndeportation, from the taking them to labor camps, labor brigades.\nAnd our superintendent's son, who was a priest in Rome, came back to the apartment house and\nwas trying to convert the Jews. His name was Kuhn, K-U-H-N, I believe. And my mother and I\nwent, took a few lessons, learned a catechism, and after awhile I refused to go back.\nAnd I remember I had the sense of abandoning one's religion under duress and that that was not\nright at age 15. Not being a Jew, I don't know where that came from, but that was my feeling.\nIt's interesting. It also led to another during the Korean War, that kind of a feeling surfaced once\nagain when I was drafted.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nBut the priest ultimately became known as the hanging priest of Budapest. He was -- and I think\nthat the museum has a picture of him with a pistol on his cassock. And he went around the\nstreets shooting Jews. And he was hung shortly after the liberation. But 1t was kind of a\ndichotomy that he's trying to convert but his hatred was such that he would shoot those who\ndidn't.",
        "Q: Did your mother willingly leave the conversion lessons also with you?",
        "A: I don't remember that. It seems that in some cases I took the lead and she deferred to me in\nmaking some decisions. One of them was a life-and-death decision. There was a suicide in the\nhouse once. Somebody jumped off the floor above us and died. And I kind of remembered that.\nThat surfaced later on. But the time period between this conversion attempt and -- which had to\nbe maybe August, September, October, things were really getting hairy.\nAnd I remember being out on the streets as usual and getting caught in a bombing raid away\nfrom home and coming home after the curfew, because the bombing raid didn't end, and dodging\nthrough and hoping to -- not to get stopped by the Nazis.\nAnd I'm trying to remember at what point, but it may be -- again, when we're talking about that\n90-day period of September, October, November, things really get a little bit hazy, but I\nremember in one of the bombing raids I got caught under an arch in an apartment house and were\ncowering, lying on the floor. And the raid was over, and there was a bomb, an unexploded bomb\nwithin 20 feet of us, right in the open arch area, and we had to step over it to go home.\nAnd of course by that time I began to see an awful lot of death and injured people and things\nwere -- bombings were three, four times a day really. And of course the Nazis were getting\nworse, and so the paranoia set in quite naturally that everybody was after me, whether it was on\nfoot or in the air. And so things were going downhill fairly fast at that point.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Were you ever stopped by any of the Nazis?",
        "A: No, I was not. I looked very much like a German kid. I was blond, very light blond. I also\nwore the school uniform coat, which was a -- an old Hungarian type uniform --",
        "Q: But you had the star on?",
        "A: -- with braids. But I had the star on. The period I'm referring to really, I took the star off and\nwas on the street without the star moving around without any papers. And of course --",
        "Q: This is September-October you're talking about?",
        "A: I would say October-November. And I don't know how I had the guts to do it or why. I just\ndid it. And I moved because I didn't like restriction. And it pretty much had to be that period,\nalthough I was doing that out of the Swedish house also for a few days. But at any rate, I moved\naround.\nThe danger, of course, was -- is that if you were stopped, you had no papers, pulled your pants\ndown and if you were circumcised, they killed you.",
        "Q: When you say you had no papers, it's because you left them at home?",
        "A: Well, all my papers were Jewish. Other words, all the papers that we had --",

        "A: -- the documents we had --",
        "Q: You purposely left them at home.",
        "A: -- said Judo, Jewish. And so we had to -- we just left it. And I could claim that it was lost,\nand I had a -- my apprenticeship papers which said who I was, and I tore it in such a way that the\nJewish religion was torn off, but 1t would have kidded no one. They still would have had my\npants off and -- but didn't. I was never stopped, luckily. I got caught up in a roundup once, and I\nwas able to run away.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: How did that happen?",
        "A: I saw the -- I saw the Hungarian Nazis blocking off the street, and there were some\nbombed-out houses and I just scrambled over the ruins and ran home at that point.\nSO we were coming to the December time period because things were in this October-November\nperiod very much the same.\nEnd of File 1\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nBeginning of File 2\nPart 2 of interview with Ivan Becker\nConducted by Gail Schwartz on August 29, 1989.",
        "Question: What were you aware of about the general Jewish situation in Budapest?",
        "Answer: I'm guessing at about September, October, November, we found out about the\navailability of Schutz-Passes issued by the Portuguese, the Vatican, the Swiss, the Swedish\ngovernment.",
        "Q: You had not heard of Raoul Wallenberg at that point?",
        "A: At that time, I had not heard of Wallenberg at all. We were fairly well isolated and therefore,\nit's very difficult to -- to have had news of that type coming in to the -- in to the house. If you\nhad no -- no one that was visiting you, you didn't find out very much. We were aware of that one\nof our neighbors had the access to the Swiss Schutz-Pass. He was selling it to those who were\nable to pay for it.",
        "Q: Did your mother try to get one?",
        "A: We didn't have the money, so we could not get it. And at the same time, in the same time\nperiod, the Germans allowed, I believe, 1,200 Zionists to pay their way out of Hungary. The -- I\ndon't remember the -- I thought it was \u2014 it was either 1,200 people or it was $1,200 per person\nthat they let go. But one family that did go was my uncle with his wife and two children.",

        "Q: Right. But you, yourself, did not have any contact with these refugees?",

        "A: Which I experienced.",

        "A: Yes. But we're not -- we had a Jewish religion and not the Jewish -- we had the faith but not\nthe -- I guess the ethnic grouping, which is fairly typical of the German and Hungarian Jews of\nthe middle class. Not very proud of it, actually. But it was that way, nevertheless.",

I resented bitterly that we had to buy our way in to a Swiss\nSchutz-Pass because by that time, I knew we should have -- that things are going to get real bad.\nAnd came the time, specifically, December 13th. Let me go back.\nIn this September, October, November period, my uncle from Transylvania, my father's brother.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: His name?",
        "A: His name was Leslie Lutzy (ph). We found out that he was not deported or he did not\ndisappear. He was in a labor brigades. He was in Russia. They took him to Russia. He was\ndigging his way back in to Hungary and ended up on a freight train, not like the deportations, an\nopen freight train. That's where they -- they were being transported and lived in. They were \u2014\nthey were pulled in to -- across the street from our house in the western railroad station. And he\ngot in touch with us. He sent us a message. And during the curfew, I was taking over food to\nthe people and soup and such that my mother made. And they were there for several weeks and\nwere pulled out at some point. We didn't know when they were going. They just disappeared,\njust left. So that was a relative out of nowhere showing up, relatives, my uncle going to --\nsupposedly to -- I guess the Germans were promising to take him to Switzerland. We have found\nout, after the war, that they ended up in Bergen-Belsen in a transit logger about the same time, I\nguess, that the Dutch girl was there, Anna Frank.",
        "Q: Anna Frank.",
        "A: Um-hum. Subsequent to their stay in Bergen-Belsen , the Germans indeed took them out and\nthey did end up in Switzerland. But they had \u2014 it was a fairly close call.\nGoing to December 13th, in the morning, we got a phone call from my father from\nnowhere, from all of a sudden, that he is in a railroad station, another railroad station in\nBudapest and asking us to bring him food. I talked to him, and he asked us to bring him\nfood and clothing and told us where he's going to meet us. This was December 13. We went to\nsee him. We couldn't find him, so we brought the food and the clothing back. And we made it\nback before the curfew when the gendarmes came in to the house and wanted all Jews, and there\nwere only men, women, and children, to come downstairs and be taken out.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: These were the Hungarians?",
        "A: These were the Hungarians. The Hungarian gendarmes actually were worse than the\nGermans, by far to us, anyway, because they were the ones who were in charge of rounding up -\n\u2014 they rounded them up -- they rounded the Jews up in the provinces because these were the\nprovincial. It's like the State Police, if you will. But it was really federal police. It was the\ngovernment employees that oversaw the provinces. And they were doing the deportations from\nthe provinces, and then in October, November, when the Jews of Budapest were being rounded\nup, they bring \u2014 they brought all of them back in to Budapest, and they were the ones who\nguarded us and took us in. But in -- when the -- when the gendarmes came in to the house and\nmy mother suggested that remember the men who jumped off from the sixth floor, whether do I\nwant to commit suicide with her or not.\nAnd again, I made a decision, which was no, because things could be better, may be better.\nAnd so we went downstairs and joined a group of I think no more than seven or eight people. I\nwas the only child in that group. Some of them hid and got away with it\nbecause it was so late in the game. Even the -- even in the Holocaust Museum, in one of\ntheir publications, mentions the fact that the last death March transport left November 17,\nwhich is not correct. There were some groups even after us. But I was certainly -- we\nwere taken away December 13th and ended up in the brick factory that night, the\nbrickyard in the old part of Buda.",
        "Q: You're down in the courtyard with the other people.",
        "A: Okay. It's raining. Miserably cold. Middle European winter. We had some food with us\nbecause I took it -- we took it to our father -- to my father.",
        "Q: What were you wearing?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: I was wearing a pair of boots, knickers, which were my first grownup pants that I had got that\nyear. I wore a coat with a fur on it which is the one that looked so very Hungarian, typically\nHungarian, which later on helped, and I had a short waterproof jacket with a hood over it\nbecause it was raining. We also had blankets. We were told to take blankets with us, if I\nremember.",
        "Q: Did you take anything personal to you, anything special?",
        "A: My father left us a silver Omega pocket watch, which I think he got from his grandfather.\nAnd my mother took that. Took her wedding ring.",

        "A: I took nothing. I took nothing with me.",
        "Q: What was it like to stand there with the other people in the courtyard?",
        "A: Well, by that time, it was \u2014 it was becoming very scary. We didn't believe that we were\ngoing to get killed. But we did not know what was going on or what is going to happen to us.\nSo it was kind of a fatalistic attitude set in at that point. Felt rather powerless. And, in fact, you\nwere.",
        "Q: Were people calm?",
        "A: Yes. They were unnaturally calm. And we were -- walked through the street under guard,\ntaken to -- across the Danube on a pontoon bridge because the main bridge\nwas accidentally blown by the Germans, supposedly. The Hungarians claim that they\nblew it, with people on it, including German buses in the summer. So the army put a\npontoon bridge across to an island, and from the island, we walked across the remaining part of\nthe bridge to the old part of Buda in to the brickyards which was the first stop on the cavalry that\nwe went through. The brickyard was a pretty horrible place. It was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nopen on three sides. It had a roof over it. We got there. It was fairly dark. There was no lights.\nIt was raining. And we were jammed in there so that nobody really had any room to even lie\ndown in the mud. And one of the recurring things that still haunt -- after 50 years -- there are a\nlot of things that came out later on where some of my fears and concerns came from. But I\nremember even today, my wife is a very independent person. And when we go to a museum, for\ninstance, she will disappear. She'll go ahead of me or behind me. And I get terribly anxious and\nvery angry.\nWell, of late, I decided the reason for that is -- is the first night in the brickyard because I had to\ngo to the bathroom real bad. And of course there were no latrines. There were some open areas\nwhere everybody squatted and did what they have to do, but then you had to find your way back\nin the pitch black. And I believe my mother had a flashlight. And so eventually, I remember\ngetting -- well, I caught up with her. I found where she was. But I remember the anxiety of -- of\nbeing in the pitch dark with hundreds, if not thousands of people milling about. And by that\ntime, people were crying. They were -- certainly knew that something that -- things are going to\nget real dicey, and there was no food, no water. And that was the beginning of the death marches\nwhere we were driven on day after day on the roads.",

        "A: Stayed overnight. And every day you moved --",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: -- on foot. These were groups of thousand, maybe more people, strung out, moving from one\nof these Stations of the Cross -- of my cross, if you will.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: On foot.",
        "A: On -- onward to what turned out to be the Austrian border. The --",
        "Q: Do you remember the kind of places you stayed at? You stopped at night?",
        "A: We stopped at night, which also had an effect on me for all my life. If you were ahead of the\ngroup leaving, you were the first one to get to a marketplace where animals were sold in the day\ntime or the marketplace where the food was sold, so these were open areas with the junk and\nwith the animal droppings where you could pick a spot where you can sleep. These were all\nopen. And we're talking about mid-December in Europe, which is pretty harsh. Food was\nminimal. Once in a while, we got a piece of bread. I remember one bit of soup. And on one of\nthese, before stopping for the night, my mother gave that silver Omega watch away to get a loaf\nof bread. And we had no money. We had nothing left after that.\nThe march, itself, was pretty hairy. The idea was, of course, to drive us as fast as we can move\nso those who can't move can be shot and those were old and could move, they committed\nsuicide. There were people hanging from the -- from the trees and went on and on and on.",
        "Q: And you saw this?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: As a teenager?",
        "A: Yes. That particular period is important for me because it became the catharsis,\nmaybe 30 years later, seeing the depiction of that march in a mini-series, Wallenberg \u2014 on\nWallenberg that Chamberlain did for television. It was a two-part series. And was the first one\nthat depicted this particular death march. And until that point, I was in total denial. Memories\nwhere I could see pictures of Auschwitz didn't mean anything to me. There was no emotion\nwhatsoever. And my sons and my wife, we watched it in a bedroom on a bed, and I broke up for\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe first time, and I broke down, and it was the first time I cried since Christmas of 1944. There\nwere never any tears no matter what happened.\nSo that march was really cataclysmic for me in terms of memories. Memory in a group that we\nwent with --let me just say again importance of being first was because you could sleep longer;\nyou could pick your spot. If there was food, the stragglers would get nothing, as they were not\nable to. So all my life, I have to be at the airports hours early. I have to -- I have to know\nexactly where I'm going, when I'm going to be there, and I'm always early.\nThose are just one of the few things that affected the rest of my life.",
        "Q: Were you and your mother able to get to the front --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- a lot?",
        "A: No. She had a hard time keeping up, but we walked together all the way. We were strafed\nby Russian aircraft. On one occasion, because we had fire engines and soldiers in between the\nJews being taken, and so the Russians saw the fire engines and the\nsoldiers and they came strafing, but they did it -- the line was going on the road. They came\nacross. So when they shot at the engines and the soldiers, they were not strafing\ndown the road. So they didn't kill anybody. They did not kill, except people who were\naround those engines. And they were some of -- some of us, of course. But I remember\ncarrying the blanket and putting it over our heads because I think it was a pink blanket. And\nclearly to show the -- if the pilots even saw it or cared, that these were not soldiers that were\ngoing.\nIn one case, we ended up in the hull of a ship on the Danube where people were supposed to\nhave been pushed in to the water, those who couldn't walk. We saw some dead bodies. But we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwere in the ship. It was damp, and the clanging noise I remember still. It was just one of the six\nor seven stopover places before we got to the border.\nIt was roughly six or seven days, six or seven stops before we got to the border town of\nHegyeshalom to the railroad station.",
        "Q: Were -- did either you or your mother have the strength to talk\nto each other during this time?",
        "A: I think we have talked some. I remember, although not talking to her, but I remember that\nGerman troops, like newsreels people took newsreels of us. And I told my mother to look in to\nthe camera or at least went with my mother, and I pushed my hood back so if people see the\nmovie, they would see that my mother and I have been taken away. And I was -- I guess I was\nbasically targeting that if relatives or friends would know what happened to us because nobody\nwould know. We just -- contact was dropped. Nobody would know what happened to us.",
        "Q: Were there other people in the march that you knew? Did you stay with the people in your\napartment house --\nA No.\nQ -- they were all strangers?",
        "A: No. No. It was all strangers. And I don't know what happened to the -- you\nknow, clearly there were so many thousands moving on that the people that we left the house\nwith, they disappeared as soon as we got to the brickyard, the first stop really.",
        "Q: What were some of the other places that you stopped at?",
        "A: Mostly marketplaces in the day time.",
        "Q: Marketplaces.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: The bottom of the freight boat. It's not a tug -- or it's not a -- it's one of those -- that ply the\nDanube still today. It\u2019s essentially freighters.",
        "Q: What do the -- what did the soldiers say to you? Did they talk to you?",
        "A: They did not talk to us. They were beating some of the stragglers. I heard shots, knew what\nthat was about. So -- and during this strafing, they disappeared. And we still went on.\nUnderstand the circumstances that these were the old and the young, the women. I don't think\nthere were men in there. There had been. I have seen the suicides. They were men. But mostly\nwomen and children because the men have already been taken away. All the old ones really\ndidn't make it too far and they were killed. The idea was that it was no longer any rolling stock\nto deport the Jews of Budapest. Eichman wanted to finish the job. So this was a way of getting\nonly the strong ones to the Austrian border and getting rid of the rest.",
        "Q: What about young children?",
        "A: Young children.",
        "Q: What \u2014",
        "A: But I don't remember that I've seen too many much younger than I was, which was 15, 14. I\ndon't know what happened to the younger ones, whether they were left behind\nor just what happened, I don't know. But we were going on, and it was hard to trace\nwhere we've been. I remember the brickyard. I went back many years later to Hungary\nand tried to identify some of the places and had a hard time doing it. When I took my\nsons back to Budapest with me, the younger one wanted to walk with me the route that I took,\nwhich was very interesting. And we were looking for and driving around trying to find the\nbrickyard because that was probably -- that was more significant than anything else. It was the\nfirst stop. It was also, I think, unusually cruel being there with so many thousands, and it was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nraised and apartment houses stood in its place. So that was kind of a disappointment. I really\nwanted to show that to them. It would have given them a little bit more of a feeling. But the --\nthe trip of the six or seven days ended at Hegyeshalom, where the children under 16 were\nseparated from the adults. My mother gave me her wedding ring. We kissed goodbye and never\nsaw her again. Never found out what happened to her. I guess one of the people came back\nfrom the group that was taken away from the -- from the house, and she ended up in Bergen-\nBelsen but didn't know anything what happened to my mother. Just -- my mother disappeared in\nto thin air. Gone.\nWe were put in to a barn with perhaps 10, maybe a dozen children about the same age or a little\nyounger than I was.",
        "Q: Boys and girls?",
        "A: Boys and girls. And we stayed there hours overnight, and one day -- and this is what I told\nPer Anger last night -- that a German officer came, skinny, well-dressed, spit-polished German\nofficer came into a barn and told us children come\nwith me. We have a train going back to Budapest. And shortly after that, a civilian in a\nblack coat and hat came in and said don't believe the German. Stay here for a little while\nlonger, and I guarantee to take you back to Budapest.\nNow, Per Anger was there; Wallenberg was there; and Eichman was there. We'll\nnever know which one, but it -- certainly the black coat and the hat Wallenberg wore.\nCertainly the spiffy German uniform that Eichman wore, but at any rate, some of us -- and I\nthink it happened that I decided that the civilian makes more sense, and some of the kids\nremained with me. The others went with the German. I believe there was a classmate that went\nwith the German. And I have never heard from him, which doesn't necessarily mean that -- in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmy mind, it meant that he was dead. And the likelihood was very good that they were killed off\nshortly after that.\nThe effect was --",
        "Q: How many stayed with you?",
        "A: I remember five or six, perhaps. Small group.",
        "Q: About half went with one and half went --",
        "A: I think so. It's -- it would be interesting to meet some of them that stayed with me, whether\nwe recall the same things or not -- but the effect was such that for many years after that, when\nsomebody asks me for an advice of anything, what to eat, what to wear, what to do, and I gave it\nand they did not follow it, I was unreasonably furious. And through therapy, it came out that\nprobably the reason was that if you don't listen me, then you will die. And when I was bringing\nup my children, who knew nothing of this, my reaction to some of these things were rather\nvociferous. But we were packed in to open cattle cars. Not really packed. It wasn't the usual 80\nor 100 people in there. But our doors were open because I remember I had to go to the\nbathroom. The train was moving, and I had to go, and so they were holding me up and I went.\nAnd it took us about three days, I think -- that's a recollection -- to get back to Budapest.",
        "Q: Who were the other people in the car besides your six?",
        "A: People -- there were some adults. I am now assuming that they were people that\nWallenberg saved from the trains.",
        "Q: Um-hum.",
        "A: The children. And we were -- we were not locked in. I think that the doors were closed at\nnight. But we closed it. And then we opened it again. So it was not -- it was clearly under the\nSweedish people that were organizing it and essentially manned the trains.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: And you're on the train, which you said was Sweedish?",
        "A: And at night, we could see the muzzle flashes of the Russian artillery that was then circling\nBudapest. And we made it back to Budapest on a train without getting bombed, arriving, I\nbelieve, Christmas Eve. We arrived at the railroad station, not close to my house, but as I looked\nat it just last November, to the eastern station, and we walked off and were taken to the Sweedish\nhouses.\nNow, did I know that we were going to be taken to the Sweedish houses? I am not sure.",
        "Q: How much information did you have --",
        "A: Very little. Very little information, which surprises me, unless I'm walking it. But\nI remember some -- walking by a food store and somebody gave me an apple. I\nremember that. I also remember scribbling a message to the little Christian girl that was\nmy friend. Her family, by that time, moved from the house because only Jews were remaining\nbehind, in to a new apartment house. And I am guessing that -- because it makes sense, and I \u2014\nyou know, you're recreating history as to what's logical. So I'm not sure that it's true. But I was\nable to send a message to them because I knew where they\nwere, where they lived, and must have indicated to them where I'm going to be going,\nwhere I'm going to be taken. That's the reason I'm guessing that we must have known\nsomething.",
        "Q: When you were on the train, were other people talking about what was going to happen?",
        "A: I don't remember.",
        "Q: You don't remember.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: The only thing that I can recall on that train trip, that I had a piece of bread, which I horded\nand ate. And that was about the only thing that I remember eating. But I remember that I cried\non that train because I realized that I'm alone. I had no one to go\nto. I cried, and I did not cry again until my family and I saw the Wallenberg movie.",
        "Q: Did the older people on the train comfort the younger people?",
        "A: I don't remember that. I am guessing no. By that time -- and even on the -- on the death\nmarch, there was really no connection with anybody. We were all foreign to one\nanother. We were all strangers. And we were all kind of in our own microcosm.\nThere was no heroism between people. There was no -- that I remember. There was no\nhelp being given because if you're helping somebody, you both could be shot. And so\nthe isolation, I believe, which is what made me break down and cry, that I was really totally\nalone. But having sent all that message, after having got off that train, we were\ntaken in to one of the Sweedish houses on the Danube. And we were fed something. I\ncan't remember what. There were thousands of people, or at least hundreds of people in an\napartment house. And I had to find a place to sleep, which I did. We were upstairs, probably\nfifth or sixth floor. And -- well, we did not go down to the cellar. There was too many people in\nthe house for that. So we never -- raids or really the artillery shells were coming in by that time.\nAs a matter of fact, the first artillery shell that I saw was\nChristmas Day -- jumping ahead. Sent a message to this little friend's family. Next\nday, which I believe was Christmas Day, it was a holiday, and there was a banging on the\napartment houses door, a Hungarian soldier was banging with his rifle, demanding to see and to\ntake Becker Ivan, and people told me that he's down there.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnd I went out, went through the gate, the door, and here was the soldier pointing a gun at me\nand said that he was sent to take me away. After we went a few steps, he said don't worry. I am\na friend of your acquaintances, and they have asked to fetch you and to bring you to their home.\nAnd so with a pointed gun, he marched me to their apartment house. And I met them, of course.\nThis is a father, the mother and two daughters, young one, which was my friend, 12 year old.\nShe was, by the way, the first girl that I went to the theater with. My parents took us to the\ntheater. So we were dropping back a few years. But just because she is going to surface for\nseveral years after that.\nBut the first theater prece we saw was Our Town in Hungarian in Backa. But at any\nrate, Christmas time, her sister, who was what, four or five years older than we were, or\nthat she was. So she had to be about 16, and they fed me. We had dinner together.\nAnd --",
        "Q: What were your feelings when you saw this German soldier telling you --",
        "A: Hungarian soldier.",
        "Q: Excuse me. Hungarian soldier telling you --",
        "A: Scared. Didn't know what was going on, of course, and didn't quite know what to do. I mean\nI -- clearly I couldn't run because it would have been too easy to shoot. And so I went with the\nflow.",
        "Q: Um-hum.",
        "A: And of course finding out that he was a friend, that was quite a load off my mind at\nthat point. The friend's -- their name is Kadar. They had another person there, a woman\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthere. And they have suggested, I believe, the daughter many years later told me that they asked\nme to stay with them, and that they will hide me because they have another woman that they\nwere hiding. And I refused to do so.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Iam not sure whether I was afraid that if they find me, they are going to kill them, as well. I\nthink that would be very nice. But I'm not sure that was my driving point. I think, perhaps, that\nthe authority said that I should be in another house and that's where I should go back to. But --\nand here it becomes fuzzy. I do go back to the Wallenberg house, the Sweedish houses. I\nremember that. I remember also that during the bombing\nraid, one of the impacts was fairly close. I was eating a plate of food. And a door came\nout and cracked me across the face and my tooth chipped. And that is the only injury\nthat I have from the war, other than psychological and physical, just well-being, stomach\nproblems, etc. But that was the only thing where I bled. And my hearing got affected. But that\nwas not an injury. It was an explosion.\nBut nevertheless, in this period of time, I was back in the Sweedish houses and this is between\nChristmas and New Years. And I am assuming that our friends, the Kadars, took me out once\nmore because the rumors were heard that the Sweedish houses will be\nevacuated. There were military -- German military transports, horse drawn transports around the\nblock where the Sweedish houses were full of ammunition, and it was -- the Danube and the\nRussians were coming closer, and the assumption was that they were going to -- they need to fuel\nthe fire, and they're going to evacuate the Jews, whether they were Sweedish passports or not,\ntaking them in to the ghetto that was established in Budapest.",
        "Q: Did you have any newspapers at this point?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Nothing?",
        "A: I did not get my Schutz-Pass until much later, and I went to the -- the Sweedish office not far\nfrom where the Sweedish houses were to get it. It was not handed to me. And I never used it as\na -- aS a Saving grace. It was really used as establishing an identity more than anything else\nbecause I had no papers. I have no birth certificate. I have no -- I have my father's passport, and\nthat's about the only thing that I have.\nBut in that period, being in the Sweedish house and getting out, going back to the Kadars, the\nconstant bombings, the artillery shells coming in, I mean we were, at that time, completely\nencircled, I think the Russians were already in Vienna. They were still fighting in Budapest.\nAnd hearing rumors that the houses will be moved in to the ghetto, I came out again, and without\nwearing the star, went back to the Kadars, and the Kadars heard, I believe, of a Red Cross shelter\nfor children. And I think it was just before New Years, end of December, beginning of January -\n- very beginning of January. One late afternoon, I was going in to that Red Cross shelter. And\nthey sent the youngest daughter, who was 12 at that time; I was 15, to go with me.\nSo these two gentile-looking children went across this dark abandoned bombed and\nshelled part of town, pitch dark, and went hand-in-hand to the address where I was to go.\nWe did not lose our way but were not sure where we were exactly. I saw a -- somebody in the\ndark, and I walked up; we walked up actually. And I asked him where the Red\nCross shelter was. And he flicked on his light and shined it on our faces. And I saw that he was\none of the Arrow Cross people. And of course I paled. And the girl didn't\nknow what I was scared of. And the guy looked at us and told us where the shelter was.\nNever asked us for papers. And she asked me why I was so scared. And I told her,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nvery reluctantly, she recalls later, that I told her that I was afraid that they were going to take my\npants off. And I didn't tell her why, that circumcision was something. And of course she was\nyoung. She didn't know it. But I would say 30 years later, she told me that she did not\nunderstand what I was worried about until she married her husband, who was Jewish. And then\nshe realized what could have happened.\nBut she left me and walked back through that dark town by herself, and again, 30 years later,\nmore than that, 40 years later, when I saw her in Switzerland, I asked her what made her do it, to\nwalk with me, and what made her parents suggesting that she did. And her reaction was that she\nfelt all her life, that she was not as important to her parents as her sister was. And she and her\nsister have not talked since the war days. Whether that's the reason they sent her and she just\ncame with me because we were friends.\nBut I ended up in this Red Cross shelter for a few days. We were taking care of babies, young\nchildren.",
        "Q: Do you know the address of it?",
        "A: I'm sorry?",
        "Q: Do you know the address of it?",
        "A: No, I don't. Never could find the building. I remember the layout. I remember\nthat we broke into -- because the houses were already -- people were taken away. I think\nthey were Jewish houses to begin with. And so the houses were empty or the people ran away.\nAnd we broke in to houses trying to find some leftover food to feed ourselves and to give it to\nchildren. Very hazy on that. But I remember very well that another guy, probably a little bit\nolder than I, we were sleeping on cots, and he was singing and I was\nsinging. We were singing \u201cIt's a long way to Tipperary.\u201d\u201d> Who knows where the song\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncame from. But the pronunciation was it's a long vay because we spoke no English. Didn't\nknow what we were singing. But it was kind of a defiant thing. I mean we could have again -- it\nwas stupid to do it. But we did it nevertheless.",
        "Q: You said you were taking care of babies at the Red Cross?",
        "A: Yes. And I don't remember any of them. I remember some little ones, some young ones\nwalking about. But we were not the only ones taking care of them. There had to be some adults\nthere. We were just forging -- we were just forging around for food. Didn't last long because we\nalso heard a rumor that anybody over 10 or 12 years old will be taken away by the gendarmes or\nthe Arrow Cross.\nAnd so at that point, I went back to the Sweedish house, and shortly after that, the Sweedish\nhouse was evacuated and taken in to the ghetto.",

        "Q: When you would see people who were killed and were dead on the street, did have you any\nemotional reaction?",
        "A: No. Not by that time. By that time, there was really no fear. It was not catatonic, but\ncertainly --",
        "Q: Numbness?",
        "A: -- a total numbness of going with it. Now -- and making decisions that essentially going right\ninstead of going left. It was the right decision. Running away. It was the right decision.\nHiding, trying to make a go of it. It just happened. Probably not, but probably it was the kind of\na primeval survival syndrome, the fight -- fear and flight\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsurvival. But we were taken in to the ghetto. I remember being very upset about it. It\ndidn't look good. It was tremendous numbers of people. And went in to a house with a\ncourtyard. And I was essentially taken in to one of the apartments and given a place to flop. I\ntook a down blanket -- not blanket, but -- what 1s this called?",
        "Q: Comforter?",
        "A: Comforter. -- from the Sweedish house. I carried that with me. That's the only thing that I\nhad.",

        "A: No. No, I don't. I really have no souvenirs that I brought along with me.",
        "Q: You were still wearing the same clothes?",
        "A: Same clothing. I was full of lice, but beautifully manicured because that was one thing that I\nwas fastidious about. Trimmed my toenails and my hand nails because my -- when I lived at\nhome, my mother used to have a manicurist coming in, who manicured her and just as a lark, did\nit for me, as well.\nShe was also a woman who brought us some milk and some food. Her husband was a German\nNazi and had pictures of her with her of him in a Nazi uniform. But she was a\nmanicurist for a long time for us. And so she was trying to help us. But when I was\ngetting in to -- when I got in to the ghetto, got this space in front of a huge double French\nwindow, and one early morning -- I don't know what made me pull the comforter over my head,\nbut within split second, there was an explosion with an incoming shell, blew the window out, all\nthe glass came tumbling down on me. And essentially, people had to get the glass off me before\nI could get up.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nBut then I had to move in to another house with pregnant women and young babies. And I\nalways worked, did something, somewhere, trying to pass the time really more than anything\nelse.",
        "Q: Did you think about your mother and father a lot at that time?",
        "A: No. No, I did not. It was really hard to stay alive and dodging bullets, although did some\nstupid things like watching people shooting at me, Russians, or Russian airplanes strafing me.\nBullets hitting the wall, missing me but pulling -- bullets were slamming in to five feet above my\nhead before I jumped.\nAnd in this particular Red Cross shelter, there was some food. Very little. I remember that we\nwere given some split peas that were originally, I understood, not for\nfood, but for sewing from the fields, and I remember at that time, my first real big bad\nstomach pain because we crushed it, crushed the -- those hard peas, made flour out of it,\nmixed it with a little water and then tried to make kind of a -- pancakes out of it and had terrible\nheartburn, which was the beginning of all my stomach problems.\nBut in this Red Cross shelter for the women, I was helping getting some food, getting\nprovisions.",
        "Q: Is this in the ghetto --",
        "A: In the ghetto. There was some food, and they were trying to keep the women and the\nchildren alive. And so I was asked to go and get some basket of bread. And in\nbringing it back, at that point, I had not really have any food for days, if not weeks at that\npoint. I took some of the -- of the outside of the bread and I ate it on the way back. The\nresulting guilt trip lasted for 100 years after that. When my children were taking pennies out of\nmy pocket, well the younger one, I was terrible upset about stealing, and again, traced it back to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwhen I stole bread to survive. But the other aspect of that, working there, was that at least once I\nhad to make a trip to the morgue with a -- like a laundry\nbasket on my back, a woven basket with dead babies, and I remembered a feeling of\nmovement as I walked to the morgue. And they gave me a plate of beans, the first warm\nfood in weeks. And they gave me a -- what is it called -- a stretcher, blood-soaked \u2014 frozen,\nblood-soaked stretcher to take back somewhere. That -- those dead babies were -- that stayed\nwith me forever. When my children were young in their crib, I used to go in there at night to see\nwhether they were breathing or not because that part of it was extremely tough.\nAnd so I was not that blocked that I felt something at that \u2014 although, I did not feel that when I\ndid it. I mean I walked in to the morgue, which I tried to find and couldn't, where because it was\nso cold, the ground was frozen, the -- I think it was Amegra (ph), and the\ndead bodies were piled up like wood, and hundreds of them that eventually, of course,\nwere buried in a mass grave in the temple, the central temple garden, where when I was in\nschool, I used to sing during our holidays. And I stayed in that Red Cross shelter until liberation,\nwhich was 50 years ago today, this morning at 8:30, roughly.\nAnd during the period of time I was in a ghetto, again, I stayed upstairs, never went\ndown to the cellars, walked around with bullets whizzing around. I'm not sure I felt that I could\nnot be hit because I went through so much shit before, or I just didn't want to go down in to the\nshelters because I didn't want to be buried, I think. Maybe that -- it could\nbe that. I can't really guess at what the feeling was. But by that time, really went through such\nhell that nothing seemed to touch me, that I felt that I could just stand up and watch the Russians\ntaking pot shots at me. Because it was the latter stages of the siege of Budapest -- of Pest. And\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthey were coming close to the ghetto and in to the ghetto. And you could see them fighting\nhouse to house.\nThe last day I went down in to the shelter, maybe the last couple of days, and the Russian\nsoldier came through the wall of the shelter. In a shelter, there's inter-connecting shelters, which\nmean apartment houses for emergency purposes. There\nwas always a lightly-bricked over doorway. And they just broke through and came right\nthrough laying telephone lines.",
        "Q: Was this your first --",
        "A: It was the first Russian. And --",
        "Q: When you saw him, what -- what did you feel?",
        "A: I -- I hugged him. I tried to hug him. He didn't know where the hell he was or what was\ngoing on. I mean the Russian shock troops were absolutely illiterate, from the Far East, looking\nvery much like Mongols. They -- they were illiterate, and they didn't know where they were.",
        "Q: But you --",
        "A: They lived off the land.",
        "Q: And you realized what this meant?",
        "A: I realized that it meant that the Germans were out. I took my -- took the star off and\nwas heading for where I used to live, and just before I got to the western railroad station, which\nwas maybe a mile away from the ghetto, there was a group of long, long line of soldiers,\npolicemen, postmen, anybody with uniform, was rounded about by the Russians and they looked\nat me and they looked at my coat and they pushed me in to the line of prisoners. I tried to tell\nthem that I was Jewish. They couldn't understand me and couldn't care less. And went \u2014 well,\nseveral blocks with them.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nEnd of File 2\nBeginning of File 3\nPart 3 of interview with Ivan Becker\nConducted by Gail Schwartz on January 18, 1995.\nQ. We were talking about liberation and you had left the ghetto and was trying to get back to\nyour apartment.\nA. And got pushed into the line of uniformed people guarded by just a few very young\nlooking Russian soldiers. And I went into the line with them, hung back to the end of the line,\nand when we got to a bridge that was going across the railroad yard, it had a Russian anti aircraft\ngun and placement right there on the bridge, I ran. Just cut out of the line, ran like hell, ran past\nthis post with the Russians, didn't shoot after me, and I managed to get home to where I lived for\nthe first time since the 13th of December. So we're talking about months and three days. So the\nenormity of what happened during that time a month and a half affects you for the rest of your\nlife. You think about it every day, you dream about it, nightmares never leave you, reactions\nremain the same. I hate to be stopped by policemen for speeding because I get scared stiff. I had\ntrouble when I was in the Army with officers because of the same fear of what I saw and what I\nwent through.\nBut I did get home, found no one, found nothing of what we had except the furniture, even my\ntoys were stolen, no clothing. I found a pair of shoes which I took and that's about the only thing\nthat was found at that time. I stayed there for a period of time by myself, staying in a house and\nevidently, going to in April 24th to a some organization that were that was helping Jews, the\nstamp is on here but not the year. So I have to assume that this was April 29th where I got some\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfood. I mean, I was forging. I was getting some food here and there. I remember I joined a\nyoung Communist league because they give you a pound of beans if you did. So I did that. That\nwas rather scary when I had to sign all sorts of affidavits that I never was a Communist, which I\nnever was, but I was very hungry. But before this period of time, one of my uncle, who\nremember I took to his troop food because they were across, one of my uncle's comrades came\nback looking for me. He was liberated, he was the only one. My uncle died typhus, typhoid, but\nhe wanted to see if we were alive or not. Now, that was the time when I started thinking of my\nparents again and looking every corner that they are going to come around the corner and they're\ngoing to find me.\nThere was a movie a few years back called the Empire of the Sun where it was playing in either\nSingapore or Shanghai where a British family when the Japanese were occupying or coming into\nShanghai, their son got separated and looked for his parents and reunited with his parents and I\nwas hysterical in the movie and that feeling was always there from decades after the liberation\nwaiting that maybe the next ring in the apartment that I have was going to be my parents because\nI left messages all over the place. But clearly, they didn't come back and I didn't wait for them to\ncome back.\nI went with this man to Transylvania. We traveled well, we first traveled on top of a freight\ntrain and we left from the western radio station across the street, stole some nails, he had some\nneedles and thread, and we were going to try to make our way to see if any of my relatives in\nTransylvania came back or was there more food less Russians. We had a rather nasty situation\nwhere the Russians had a free month of looting and raping in Budapest because of some things\nthat happened somebody told me wasn't true but we heard that the Germans killed the Russian\ndelegation that came to ask for their surrender. And what I was just recently told that it was the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nRussians who killed their own to use as an excuse. Who knows what the truth is but 1t was a\npoint where the Russians were just shooting people on the street, do anything they wanted to for\n30 days. The 31st day, the Russian officers were shooting their men if they did something wrong,\nthat was the atmosphere. So I clearly wanted to get away with this guy.\nWe got on top of the train, a freight car, and I was___ there was, I don't know, 10 15 people on\ntop of the car, it was filled with people down below. And I watched a kid kicking a hand\ngrenade around, playing football with it, and it exploded. So my left ear is pretty bad, went deaf\nfor a while. People were hurt by shrapnel around me, never scratched, absolutely never\nscratched. And we few days in the winter this is January, maybe before February Ist even, but\ncertainly after January 18th, a couple weeks after I think, we arrived to Oradea Nagyvarad which\nis where my father's family lived. And I didn't know, at what point do we cut off\nQ. Well the\nA. the reminiscence because it goes on and on and on.\nQ. Just generally what happened in those months?\nA. Winding up.\nQ. Where you went and\nA. Okay. We ended up in Nagyvarad and I was in Nagyvarad until August of 1945. I fell in\nlove and the girl decided to go to Israel. I was 16, she was 17, beautiful girl. And at that time, the\nJewish brigade of the British Army was operating in the occupied area, Russian occupied area,\ntrying to get Jews who are returning out into Israel. And I got caught up in the exodus, the Alley\nof Beth (sic), put me into a kibbutza and went to Hungary, back to Hungary, and then was forced\npapers and ended up in Austria DP camp.\nQ. Where in Austria were you? Well, any way, you stayed\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nA. I remember\nQ. so you stayed with her, she was doing this also?\nA. I stayed with her until I got. we had a jealous tiff and I went on but we were first in\nVienna transit camp. Vienna was under four party occupation but in the middle of the Russian\nzone so we had to be evacuated. We had to be taken out. I left with her there and I went out to\nLinz. Linz Donau is where I walked across the Russian border from the Russian zone to the\nAmerican zone and ended up in an old SS camp in town called Wels, W E LS, in Austria and\nthat was the end of the odyssey as it were. But of course after that, I didn't get to the United\nStates until a year later.\nQ. So you stayed in Austria for that year?\nA. In Austria I stayed in Wels and then I was transferred, I guess in about December of\n1945, to a show displaced persons camp and by gosh darn in Austria. And in September of\n1946, as a war orphan, was taken to the United States to an orphanage in New York.\nQ. You came by boat?\nA. Yes, very small boat for a very long time\nQ. What was the name?\nA. it was miserable weather. Marine Marlin.\nQ. And landed in New York?\nA. Landed in a lower bay New York. Of course, there was a strike so we had to unload our\nboat. I had a suitcase with I think I must have had a shirt in it. I know I had made in one of the\nDP camps in the Wels camp an American blanket, pair of pants, and an Eisenhower jacket. And\nthen in the other camp, my route 1s from here sent me a pair of pants I think and a shirt, I think,\nunless I got it from the Onra (sic).\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nQ. When you were in the DP camp, did you do anything activity wise?\nA. Yes, always, always.\nQ. What did you do?\nA. I became a storekeeper for the camp. I had a bodyguard because I looked too Germanic\nand the Polish Jews who are coming back from Auschwitz and was coming through being\nrepatriated looked at me and I didn't speak Hebrew and I didn't speak Yiddish and so they\nassumed that I was German. And so there were life threats. So I had a body guard that came\nwith me all the time, six feet tall. I was 16.\nQ. Did you feel very old?\nA. Well, I never felt young after that. I mean, really after being taken away, I was totally\nformed although misformed, if you will, and I never felt like a child, really. I never felt like I\nfelt like a child but not as an adolescent, adolescence didn't happen. I used to joke about that I\nhad a midlife crisis at 20 and probably true. But I was always working in the camps, I always did\nsomething to get paid or food or clothing for and I got recommendations. I still have from the\nOnra that I worked if I remember such a job and have looked at it for a while but I did work.\nMade up my own identification card, which happens to be true. Young as I look, I was still born\nin 1929 because I have a telegram that my mother sent in my name the day I was born saying to\nmy grandmother that I arrived June 14, 1929. I was also told that I believe Kersler was the first\nperson out of the family that saw me. The child Artie Kersler, I believe it was Kersler, or one of\nthe other German. This is 1929.\nQ. Yeah. And he saw you?\nA. Yes. He saw me after I was born. He was the first outside of the family to see me I'm\ntold.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nQ. Because he was a friend of the family?\nA. Family told me.\nQ. He was a friend of the family?\nA. He was a friend of my uncle's evidently of the artist so but I had no papers except this\nwhich didn't have my birthday but it had my year on it.\nQ. Then you. okay. So you came to the United States you stayed in the orphanage\nA. For a few days.\nQ. for a few days and then where did you go?\nA. I went to my aunt and uncle and slept in the living room. They were living up in the\nBronx. Poor people basically.\nQ. When did you arrive in the United States?\nA. September 16, 1946. I stayed with them for two weeks. After two weeks, they told me\nthey wanted me to go to school but they showed me an accounting, a ledger, of how much I cost\nthem in the two weeks and told me they really can't afford it. So I decided to I took the subway\nand went downtown and happened to be on 7th Avenue, which at that time, was where most of\nthe photo studios were and photo labs and I went from place to place, not speaking English very\nwell very little because I studied it in the DP camp actually. The teacher was a Nazi Baron,\nHungarian Baron, who spoke BBC English. So I came here with speaking not very many words\nbut old British English. I did get a job in a photo lab. And because of my background in gravure\nand photo engraving, which is what I did in the printing plant in '45, somehow I found a job as\nan apprentice on 23rd = on 22nd Street in New York. And I started working, hoping, trying to\nget into the union to establish a trade. And I was good enough that I did my boss's job. I closed\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe doors and I did always work. Generally, cleaned photographic glass plates in nitric acid with\nbare hands, washing my hands with cyanide.\nQ. So you adjusted\nA. I adjusted\nQ. to the new country?\nA. to the new routine.\nQ. And then just again the pattern your life took.\nA. The pattern\nQ. You stayed in New York?\nA. I stayed in New York. I was always working either in the graphic arts or in silkscreen\nprinting. Lived in the Bronx with a friend of mine who I knew from Transylvania who came\nhere much later skipping the displaced persons camp, and being drafted during the Korean War\nin 1951. Went to military intelligence school became core photographer, never went overseas\nbut went through military intelligence training.\nQ. When did you become a citizen?\nA. After I got discharged. They didn't have [I didn't have the time to get my citizenship\nuntil '53 so it was seven years instead of five years without being a citizen. But I went through\nintelligence school without having a birth certificate which was absolutely no sense to anybody.\nAnd people are looking at me I was crazy. First of all, you don't speak English, which not very\nwell, certainly still after six years or five years initially, didn't have a birth certificate, and they\nput me through intelligence school. It's the usual Army routine. But came out in '53, joined this\nfriend of mine that I used to room with in starting to work in the plastics business making plastic\nbags which were very new in 1953 and really worked in that area until now.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nQ. Then you got married?\nA. I got married in 1962. My children were born in '64 and '67. In '67, I started a plastics\nbusiness for a company on the American Stock Exchange, became their Division Manager, and\nended up as Chief Executive and President of the company in 1988. Went through hell in\nbetween but different kinds of hell.\nQ. Can we now talk, which you have alluded to so far, about some of your feelings and\nthoughts about what you went through though you have expressed some. How do you feel about\nbeing Jewish now considering what you did go through in the war?\nA. Well, I think there's two periods of time; one, certainly after after coming back or after\ngoing through the ghetto, I did not deny it but I did not practice. I did not go to synagogue or a\ntemple until I got until I met my wife. Her father was came out to the States from Russia but\nhe was about the same age as I was, became a pharmacist. And was while not very religious,\ncame out of orthodox home and kept the high holidays. They were the first who invited me to go\nto synagogue with them and it was the first time I went after 1944. So 1964, in 20 years, no\nJewishness whatsoever. Didn't deny it but didn't identify it because I was afraid of what's going\nto happen here, that it could happen here. And the fact I remember when I came to the States\nand found out that most everybody every man is circumcised, and that you didn't have to have an\nidentification card, and you didn't have to report to the police, that was the first time I remember\nrelaxing.\nBut nevertheless, I tried to assimilate again and spoke no Hungarian, practiced no Judaism for\ncertainly 20 years and Hungarian even beyond. And I managed to learn quite well to speak\nwithout an accent on me. I was surprised that Tom Lantos, yesterday, very strong Hungarian\naccent, the Ambassador to the U.S. who spoke beautiful English and Lantos couldn't. And\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nLantos and his wife and I were at the same time, I'm assuming or within days of one another of\nthe Wallenberg Houses in Budapest. I met him yesterday, cold fish, didn't even try to be nice.\nHe's a politician on the one hand, which I understand. On the other hand, he was not very\nhuman, stuffed shirt like.\nQ. What about your father, how did you\nA. My father died in Bonneval (sic) in the 10th of January\nQ. How did you find that?\nA. My uncle, who ended up in Israel, found his name in one of the rolls. So he died a month\nafter I took\nQ. When did you find that out?\nA. I don't remember, probably somewhere in '47 -'48, pretty soon after when the war started\ncoming out and when the logs were starting to be available.\nQ. Had you was that devastating?\nA. It was pretty devastating because it was a closure which never happened with my mother.\nSo my mother would be now in her'90s__ this is'95 she was born in '99 so it'll be impossible\nfor her to have lived.\nQ. Do you receive war reparations?\nA. No because I was not in a concentration camp and I was not long enough in dire straits, if\nyou will, so I never would qualify for it. And I didn't want to lie. I could have. There was\nnobody I didn't want to lie about the fact that I was in a concentration camp and came back to\nHungary and then I took the Alley of Beth (sic) out. There was nobody to tell me.\nI wanted it behind me essentially to the point where I always wanted a lacquer that was a\nphotographer when I was 12 and I always wanted and I did get myself a Rolex and love to have a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMercedes. I went back to Germany and I went back to Hungary and I really didn't have too\nmany problems with it, again, blocking it. It's the Hungarians who were the worst to me but of\ncourse the German were the cause and so I couldn't hate so much of Europe not to ever travel or\nbe there again.\nI did business with Germans. I did business with Hungarians. Just recently, I was in a house\nwhere in Munich where my host, who was a businessman, told me about the house that there\nwas an actress who lived up on the top floor, mistress of a famous surgeon, and had Hitler. He\nsaid Hitler came here very often, you know, and\nQ. Did you say anything?\nA. No, no, no. I was an American as far as he was concerned. There was no point in saying\nanything. But I was there with a British heir and my boss was Christian and he was appalled. He\nwould not want to do business with him for all the tea in China and I was just going to smile.\nThe only other things that which may or may not be of any interest that the two women, the two\ngirls that I knew as a young man and was essentially in love with both, different times, they have\nsurfaced. A Christmas card just this past month from the 12 year old whom I met twice in\nEurope, 25, maybe 40 years after the things. And I have met the girl that I was in love with that I\nleft Hungary with. She still haven't heard from her lately but she lived in Munich and in Berlin\nand the story was very specific to our generation but equally interesting. So the past shows up.\nAnd I was in Budapest twice in November. I was in Slovakia helping some Slovaks and this is a\nreflection. During the Death March went through the town called Dure in Komarno on the\nDanube. I was in Bratislava in Slovakia helping Slovak Hungarians evaluate some business as a\nvolunteer executive. And I saw a Hungarian broadcast of the premier of the Fiddler on the Roof\nin Hungarian from this town that was ethnically cleansed and it was a tremendous success\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\naccording to the narrator. And here on the stage where the did you see it? Did you see the\nshow? This typical Orthodox Jews with the tolus and the pius dancing and singing in Hungarian.\nAnd I couldn't imagine the people of those towns going to see it because they saw us being\ndeported, all the Jews were deported. So how come this is such a success? Can't understand it.\nBut I mean again, it takes you back. Everything continues to take you back and there's always\nsome revelation.\nSo it's a life that was so affected and I guess what I try to do, rightly or wrongly, not to have my\nchildren grow up as children of survivors which has its own bad psychological syndrome. They\nare affected by more than even a survivors. But we went through family therapy together with\nmy wife and so that she could understand it a little bit more, so the children can understand it,\nand they seem to have grown up to be _ the two boys really normal American kids with some\naffinity towards Judaism, Hungary. We took them back to and took them through where I went\nto school and the affect was not bad on them which is good.\nThe children and I went back with my wife in the '80s, took them back to the house where I was\nliving, the schools that I went to, and as a matter of fact, interestingly enough, Cartie, who I met\nat lunch, her brother went to the same elementary school as I did. He's evidently the same age as\nIam. Sol promised to I did get, by the way, people found and sent to me some geography\npictures and my mother's cook book. And amongst the childhood pictures are some of the class\npictures from the elementary school and a lot more including the one that's in there. But I guess\nwhat was curious my mother taught me to be independent and take care of myself and this is the\nlate '30s, early '40s when that was not in vogue. She certainly came from a traditional middle\nEuropean homemaker background, not professional person. But she taught me how to sew and\nhow to cook and how to bake, 1n case, in case what, you know, I ask now. They never told me to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nexpect something that will happen and I don't know if they were aware of it. But to this day, I\nbake from her book that she and I used to bake Saturdays cakes for Sunday.\nI still made just yesterday I finished up a Zahar Tort that is given to my sons and now to be a\nwife for birthdays. It gets frozen and air shipped wherever they are. They also cook. They don't\nbake they don't have to be competitive. They also take pictures which I did when I was 12 and I\nhave my first picture still. So I feel that I imparted some good things and it wasn't that bad that\nthey didn't know early on what was happening to their father and to their family, their\ngrandfather, their grandmother, and all their relatives. They never had nightmares about it so I\nthink that it worked well that they find out about it under professional guidance. I think that was\nthe big thing. It may have been very difficult for them at that time but it did not affect them\nbecause the explanations were there and so there is no guilt.\nOne of them just married a French Canadian Catholic girl. He's trying to wrestle with the fact\nthat how should they bring their children up, if any. His wife told him that she's elapsed Catholic.\nHis wife told him that if he really believes in Judaism and Jews and a Jewish religion and the fact\nhe's wrestling with where I came from and what I went through, that she'll be happy to bring\ntheir kids up as Jewish and he's wrestling with it whether he should or should not. It'll be\ninteresting to see what happens. Their older son married a Jewish girl and we have a grand dog at\nthis point.\nQ. Is there anything else you would like to share about what you went through?\nA. I don't know.\nQ. Any messages you'd like to leave your children?\nA. I think they got the messages and that was, unfortunately, in a way pessimism I call it\nrealism that it certainly can happen again. During McCarthy times I remember that it could have\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\neasily happened again. With some of the far right coming into vogue around the world, it could\nhappen again. It's certainly happening again in Yugoslavia to Africa. They should be aware of\nit. They should perhaps look at people and evaluate them before they make commitments,\nbefore they entrust their lives with it with some people.\nJust to go back on the Swiss passport, the Swiss papers that were being sold which we couldn't\nafford to buy, I testified at the guy's trial because I was not the only one who was terribly angry\nbut there were others and I testified that we probably could have been saved.\nQ. Which trial was this?\nA. There was a trial in Hungary, in Budapest, bringing some of the people, the collaborators,\nor some of the people who did not help when they hindered rather than helped. The neighbor was\na Jew and he would not give us. He wanted to sell us the Swiss Schutz Passes and so I went to\nCourt and I made a deposition that I was aware of that fact that he did this.\nQ. When was the trial?\nA. It was in Budapest somewhere. It never came to be because he died of a heart attack\nbefore the trial. But I had a certain feeling of satisfaction at that point that I did something.\nQ. What year was that?\nA. 1945, early '45.\nQ. Early '45?\nA. Early '45.\nQ. Could you just again go into a little bit of detail about how you got your Schutz Pass?\nA. It's hazy but Iremember that the not the embassy but it had to be an office that,\nguessing, Wallenberg had set up. He satellite offices as I understood it. And somehow I found\nout about it. Being in a Swedish house but not having been handed the document, I went to get it\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand I remember hundreds of people outside clamoring to get in and I got in and somebody typed\nthis up and got it. But, it was really a fullback position. It never was used, would not have by\nthat time and this would have to be in January, by that time, these things were not worth very\nmuch, only occasionally would they help and I just didn't need it but it was something good to\nhave in case.\nSo really my closest meeting was in the barn with the children that I have come close to a Sweed\nor a Swedish delegate or somebody who worked for Wallenberg. I was pretty much on my own\nother than that. It was very hectic and I had to make decisions whether to stay or move on or\nand went and then went back and still got back into the ghetto, which may have been the best\nthing that happened to me at that point. Certainly, my belief in God nose dived after that and\ncertainly couldn't understand, which is what everybody asks, how can God let this happen and\nthere was never any answer.\nThe affect 1s ever lasting and I started talking about this to young people what I went through\nonly very recently and I guess the reason for it is perhaps because people started asking. My own\nfamily in America did not have any idea what I went through. They never asked me. To them, it's\nAO years later it's a total surprise. My in laws never knew about it. They knew I came out but not\nwhat came before it. It was very touching.\nI went Nancy's uncle was dying of cancer just recently and we have been close to them because\nI liked him and I liked his wife and not so much the rest of the family but he and I never talked\nabout this and we knew that he's not going to live much longer. So we went really to say good\nbye to him up in Vermont and Massachusetts where they retired and we talked about it then. And\nthey were flabbergasted that they never asked and they don't know why they didn't ask but they\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfound out and they were _ they felt better for it. But there's no asking. I mean, when the little\ngirl, the 12 year old 40 years later or I asked why she came with me, she couldn't answer it.\nIwas I escorted Miskia (sic) and her husband to receive the award from one of the Wallenberg\norganizations in New York. I asked them what made them try to save the family, the front\nfamily, and they couldn't tell me. So I'm not the only one who has no answers. It happens. It's a\nreaction to an occurrence and it's kind of instantaneous. It's not premeditated very often. In\nsome cases, of course it was. Giorgio Perlasca and the Japanese envoy that was premeditated.\nThe front family saving was not premeditated. It was do it quickly because it has to be done,\nthey're friends. Therefore, we have to save them.\nI often ask how sympathetic I would be, what would do, I don't have the answer. I don't believe\nI'm brave enough to do it but then you don't know until you get there. And hopefully it'll never\nbe tested. Hopefully never will people be faced with decisions of life and death ever again but\nthat's too optimistic to believe. I guess that's really basically it.\nQ.

        "A: In Budapest on June 14, 1929.",
        "A: My family was made up from my mother and father, Coto and Desha (phonetic) Becker. My\nfather was an accountant in a factory manufacturing cigarette paper called Modino,\nM-O-D-I-N-O. My mother was a homemaker.\nWe were pretty much middle class people. We didn't have a car, but we did have a maid who\nlived with us. And my father, as was normal in the Thirties and Forties, worked and came home\nfor lunch in the afternoon, went back to work, and came home quite late. So the family was\nreally together mostly in the middle of the day and in the evenings. As I said, we were not well\nto do at all, but we had a nice life, basically enjoying music and theater, movies.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nFrom the early Thirties on, I went to school in Budapest and was elementary school for four\nyears and --",
        "A: It was a public school. It was a public school. I was also a boy scout. Reason for bringing\nthat one out, that it became a segregated -- in spite of all the boy scout vows, it was a segregated\ntroop, only Jews. And after 1938 or so, even the elementary school was segregated, Jews in one\nclass, Christians in the other classes.",
        "A: Yes. We lived -- well, up to about maybe 4 or 5 years old we were in the suburbs, what\nwould be termed in a garden apartment today. And then we moved into town when I guess it\ncame to -- time to go to school.",
        "A: We were in a large, large apartment house.",
        "A: It was primarily a Jewish neighborhood. It was a newer part of town, but it was totally\nintegrated basically.",
        "A: [had --",
        "A: Yes. Because of classmates lived all over town, not just in the district, my friends came from\nmostly from the apartment house. And they were both Jews and Christian.",
        "A: The only problem that we --\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: All right. I mean, we're talking about the first --",
        "A: -- Jewish laws coming in in 1938 when I was 9 years old.",
        "A: And so until then there was no discrimination.",
        "A: And even after that, at least amongst friends, we had no problems.",
        "A: I'm assuming that's why my father changed.",
        "A: The family was not religious at all. We -- I think we were Hungarian -- I know we were\nHungarians first and Jews second.",
        "A: The only high holidays -- we observed the high holidays, primarily because my uncle, my\nmother's brother, was more religiously oriented. He was in Israel in the Twenties, came back to\nHungary in '29, and then stayed there. And so we used to go to their house for the high holidays.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Within our own home we were not religious, although it was mandatory to have religion in\nschool. And once a week we had to go to synagogue, and so learning Hebrew was part of it.\nBar mitzvah was another part of 1t, which was orthodox because that was the only thing -- only\nreligion, Jewish religion that was available. There was no -- in those days there was no reformed\ntemples. So I remember being bar mitzvahed in an orthodox one, which later on in our story\ncomes out --",

I was a lousy student.\nBut basically I liked certain subjects and excelled in those.

I remember that when the German troops took\nover Hungary, my father was throwing out social democratic newspapers and so that if there was\na search they wouldn't find it because it was unacceptable. But other than that, I don't think that\nhe was aware of any -- and I know that he had coworkers that we have seen socially that were\nChristian.",
        "A: I had about probably four or five family members who were really family. There was an\nextended acquaintanceship, friends of the family. But the aforementioned uncle, his wife and\ntwo children were really the only relatives that we had in Budapest. That was on my mother's\nside.\nOn my father's side everybody was in Transylvania in two towns -- actually maybe three, but one\nis Nagyvarad, which is Oradea today, Cluj, which was Kolozsvar, and Otog (phonetic) was the\nthird town where my father's family was traced basically. They kind of moved around. There\nwas a substantial -- there was a -- an uncle, my father's brother, my father's mother and father.",
        "A: I did go to visit them on school holidays usually in the summertime. One of the family\nmembers had a vineyard in Nagyvarad, and I stayed there in a vineyard most of the summer.\nI remember visiting there even in the wintertime because I'm remembering trying to kill myself\non a sled, some ridiculous places with a bunch of my cousins and other kids. And that probably\ngoes back to around 19 -- 1938, '39, 1937.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Only Hungarian.",

We were not -- we were not\nvery -- because of the religious orientation, we also didn't know anybody who was religious, and\nso the assimilated ones would not speak Yiddish even if they could. And I don't think my\nparents could. My uncle did and could.",

        "A: No. We were not frightened. And strangely enough, in 1938 -- well, my grandmother, my\nfather's mother from Transylvania, went out to her two daughters in America, supposedly for the\nworld's fair in 1938, and she stayed behind. And in 1938 --",

My grandfather was dead by that time, and so\nshe stayed with her two daughters in New York.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nThe -- the husband of one of the daughters sent us an affidavit that would have enabled us, my\nfather, my mother and I, to immigrate to America. But I remember my father worrying about the\nfact that he is -- at that time was 40 -- '38 -- 41, 41, 42 years old, the fact that he didn't speak any\nEnglish. He did not want to -- he found that he could not get a job. And he was not worried too\nmuch about the restrictions because they were fairly light, it didn't touch him. His job was not of\nthat level. And he felt that because he was in the -- in the Army during the first world war and\nhe was an officer and he was decorated that they're not going to touch him. And so he decided\nnot to take advantage of this affidavit.\nAs I mentioned, he was in the first world war. He fought on the Italian front and also on the\nRussian front. He was in the infantry in Italy and he was an aerial observer on the Russian front.\nI'm bringing this up because I have the -- I have his pictures from those times, which 1s the few\nthings that were left. And so the decision was made essentially to stay behind. And as things got\nworse and worse in terms of the restrictions --",

And I think that there was maybe a relief that, well, it's not\nso bad, we can live with this.\nSome people stayed behind because of that kind of a belief, and some tried to immigrate at that\npoint because they believed that things are going to get worse and worse.\nMy family wouldn't believe how bad things would be later on. So there was no anger. There\nwas acceptance. It was the law, so we got segregated.",
        "A: No, the segregation was really in school and in -- in the -- even in the boy scout troop which\nwas split up into families so-called of four or five children. The -- the Jewish kids had one or\ntwo of the families, and the rest of them were the Christian. And we played together and we\nwere boy scouts together. And I believe I remember as a boy scout marching when Lord\nBaden-Powell came to Budapest. And it will be interesting to find it, whether he in fact did and\ndid I remember it correctly, but I seem to remember a story that he told us over the megaphone\nthat he had, I believe, scarlet fever as an adult. The reason for that was that God looked down\nand saw this person in short pants and said he did not have scarlet fever yet, so give it to him.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNow, the story is basically that we did not have long pants as boy scouts. I mean, we were -- as\nchildren we had short pants. Nobody had long pants. Winter or summer we had short pants, and\nthis was the gist of that story. Whether I read it or it's memory, it's hard to tell, but I remember\nparading with all the scouts from all over Hungary in one of the stadium, soccer stadiums.",

My father was drafted into this, but because he\nhad a medal for -- a bronze medal for heroism during the first world war, he went in as a\ncompany commander and was in for -- my guess is for a couple of years.",
        "A: He was taken away to another location where we could visit him on occasion.",
        "A: I think there was anxiety, but then there was acceptance. Again, it was not -- there was\nworry, I remember. There was fear. There was no anger that I was aware of. Acquiescence\nreally what came into being at that point.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: No. It was very matter of fact. I knew he was going to be an officer, and I guess it was\nexpected. He did not really talk to me about it. My communication with him was loving but not\nformal necessarily, but except for the weekends didn't see much of him.\nMy mother and I were always together.

        "A: I think as an officer he had quite good conditions. And even in those days the labor brigade\nitself was fairly well treated. It was early, early on. That evolved into -- as further laws came in,\nhe was discharged for a period of time and then drafted back but into the brigade itself.\nBy that time you had to have a high rank or many more medals to remain an officer. And so he\nwent back into -- and essentially, this is a period of two or three years, they traveled around and\nwe heard from him sometime but he never came home and we never could visit, to the best of\nmy recollection.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",

        "A: I was -- [remember being very upset about it. First of all, I didn't like -- I didn't like to be\nlabeled and stand out from a group, from the rest of the world. I did not like to be picked on, as\nit were, because it was too easy to pick us off the street when the Nazis wanted to do it.\nAlthough I think that I'm skipping a little bit ahead because up to March of 1944, so I'm skipping\nabout two years of mounting difficulties of getting food, of getting money. I was also going to\ngymnasium at that time and I was in the fourth year of gymnasium. And I mentioned I was a\nrather poor student. And I made a deal with the professor, who was the class supervisor, I guess,\nthat because of my mathematical inability, I would not come back to the fifth year and he would\nlet me graduate on the fourth year. Before graduation, however, which would have been in May\nor June, March 19 the Germans marched in. And so that effectively ended school career\ncompletely.\nFrom that point on I did some smuggling to go into the provinces -- well, going out of town, they\ncall it the suburbs, by bus and train and trade for some meats and cold cuts, bring it back into\ntown and trade it for food --",

It's a little bit fuzzy, but I remember that for\nsome reason one of the pack full of sausages smelled terribly, and how anybody could miss me\nthat I was smuggling it, I never could understand. So my smuggling days came to an end at that\npoint because it was becoming too dangerous.\nAnd I also was able to get a job 1n a printing plant as an apprentice. My uncle, who was still\nliving in Budapest at that time, was a graphic artist, quite well known, specialty placards for\ndisplay purposes and advertising, and he had connections with a rather large printing company\ncalled Globus, which 1s still in existence as of 1994. And I went to there as an apprentice in the\nphoto engraving section of the printing shop.

And at a certain point again, within a few weeks of the Germans\ncoming in, we were no longer allowed to go home at night, so I slept in the -- in the printing\nplace and worked at my job.

And that system went on and I was able to go home once in\nawhile because of the armband that allowed me to move outside of curfew.",

        "A: Usually the sirens went off and went down into the cellars, which were reinforced.\nAnd on May 2nd there was a particularly heavy bombing raid where -- where I was in a printing\nplant, was -- and that neighborhood was hit fairly heavily, so we felt the earth shake and the dust\nand it was rather scary.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnd after the raid was over, I went home and found that the one half of the house was also\nbombed. And our apartment was basically blown out. The walls and the doors and the windows\nwere blown out so that we couldn't stay up in the apartment, but had to move down a few floors\nand moved in with a family including our furniture.\nAnd so we lived there basically until we were finally taken away, but -- so that -- and shortly\nafter that May bombing, it became quite unsafe to be in the printing place, so I essentially moved\nback home.

        "A: My father, we didn't know -- we didn't know where he was or what was happening to him.\nThere was no communication at that point that I can recall, not until much later. So it was\nstrictly my mother and I trying to make a go of it.",

And I remember one\nparticular time that -- again, my recollection is that we had curfew in the morning and then we\nhad to be home and then curfew opened 1n the afternoon again. And I went off to a friend's\nhouse, and I didn't call my mother that I am not coming home until later in the afternoon. And\nwhen I showed up, of course, she was out of her mind and got a real severe spanking for scaring\nher, which I could understand. But at that time I guess I was not frightened of what could be\nhappening to me, so I did not think that I should call her. But that was quite clear in my mind\nwhat happened then.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nBut we have played with friends in the house, and so except for the curfew when we went out\nand had to stand in line for food. We had ration stamps. We had to go out to find -- try to find\nsome bread and -- which was by that time made from rice flour because wheat was no longer\navailable. And there were shortages of food, meat only once in a great while, very little sugar,\nvery little staple food available.\nAnd certainly during the curfew times, of course, all the Jews were out and trying to find the\nshops that had something. And sometimes the lines were long and the curfew came so you had\nto go home empty-handed, which was difficult.",

        "A: I believe that I was aware of the fact that the -- my father's family was deported, was taken\naway from Transylvania. I don't think it was called deportation. I was not aware of it. I\nremember hearing people receiving postcards from various places in Germany, I believe, or\nPoland with stamps saying that we're okay, we're working, et cetera. And of course that was a\nsham we found out many, many years later. So the awareness that they were killing the people,\nwe did not have the awareness.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",

        "A: Summer of '44 was still reasonably safe. No one was deported because the Germans\nconcentrated on the 400,000 in the provinces.",
        "A: And so we did not see any of it. What we did see, of course, later on when they started\ndeporting people from Budapest, but that's not until September, October.",
        "A: The summer went on. Again, staying alive because of bombings was paramount. We spent\nan awful lot of time down in the cellars. We really --",
        "A: Kind of sat around in the dark and hoped that the bomb is not going to hit us. We were\nacross the street from the western railroad station, and so we were in a prime target area. And\nwhen in May the bombing finally got our house, it was a fluke because the Americans were\nfairly accurate. Their system was -- is to send 1n an aircraft and to circle the target area with\nsmoke in the sky. And the bomber stream unloaded into that circle, saturation bombing.\nThe May that we got it but the railroad station didn't, the wind took that circle and we got\nclobbered. So the raids were pretty regular. Around 10:00 at night they started, so by 20 of\n10:00 we were down in the cellars expecting it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnd I was working as a -- well, my doctor, my pediatrician was the head of the volunteer\nambulance corps in Budapest. And after my stint in the printing place, I asked him -- I suppose I\nhad to ask him to see if I can get trained as a first aid person. And I went through a course with\nadults, being the youngest to graduate from that course, and so I was a full-fledged first aid type.\nAnd as such, I did not go down to the cellar until the bombs came awfully close.\nWe were also fire guards. We were 15, so we didn't like the basement. It was a horrible place to\nbe. And so my poor mother scared out of her wits for me, but I was all over the house and\nwatching for the aircraft to come and the antiaircraft trying to shoot them down. And when a\nbomb started whistling too close, then we ran down. So I really did not spend that much time in\nthe cellars, ever really. I felt it was better to die up there than not.\nOne of the things that also happened in the -- after we had to wear the yellow star, that the\nVatican curia I guess made an arrangement with the Nazis, the Hungarian Nazi government, that\nif a Jew converted, then they would wear a different color, I think it was either white or yellow\nor just white armband, and they would be basically exempt from the curfew or from the\ndeportation, from the taking them to labor camps, labor brigades.\nAnd our superintendent's son, who was a priest in Rome, came back to the apartment house and\nwas trying to convert the Jews. His name was Kuhn, K-U-H-N, I believe. And my mother and I\nwent, took a few lessons, learned a catechism, and after awhile I refused to go back.\nAnd I remember I had the sense of abandoning one's religion under duress and that that was not\nright at age 15. Not being a Jew, I don't know where that came from, but that was my feeling.\nIt's interesting. It also led to another during the Korean War, that kind of a feeling surfaced once\nagain when I was drafted.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nBut the priest ultimately became known as the hanging priest of Budapest. He was -- and I think\nthat the museum has a picture of him with a pistol on his cassock. And he went around the\nstreets shooting Jews. And he was hung shortly after the liberation. But 1t was kind of a\ndichotomy that he's trying to convert but his hatred was such that he would shoot those who\ndidn't.",
        "A: I don't remember that. It seems that in some cases I took the lead and she deferred to me in\nmaking some decisions. One of them was a life-and-death decision. There was a suicide in the\nhouse once. Somebody jumped off the floor above us and died. And I kind of remembered that.\nThat surfaced later on. But the time period between this conversion attempt and -- which had to\nbe maybe August, September, October, things were really getting hairy.\nAnd I remember being out on the streets as usual and getting caught in a bombing raid away\nfrom home and coming home after the curfew, because the bombing raid didn't end, and dodging\nthrough and hoping to -- not to get stopped by the Nazis.\nAnd I'm trying to remember at what point, but it may be -- again, when we're talking about that\n90-day period of September, October, November, things really get a little bit hazy, but I\nremember in one of the bombing raids I got caught under an arch in an apartment house and were\ncowering, lying on the floor. And the raid was over, and there was a bomb, an unexploded bomb\nwithin 20 feet of us, right in the open arch area, and we had to step over it to go home.\nAnd of course by that time I began to see an awful lot of death and injured people and things\nwere -- bombings were three, four times a day really. And of course the Nazis were getting\nworse, and so the paranoia set in quite naturally that everybody was after me, whether it was on\nfoot or in the air. And so things were going downhill fairly fast at that point.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",

I talked to him, and he asked us to bring him\nfood and clothing and told us where he's going to meet us. This was December 13. We went to\nsee him. We couldn't find him, so we brought the food and the clothing back.

The Hungarian gendarmes actually were worse than the\nGermans, by far to us, anyway, because they were the ones who were in charge of rounding up -\n\u2014 they rounded them up -- they rounded the Jews up in the provinces because these were the\nprovincial. It's like the State Police, if you will. But it was really federal police. It was the\ngovernment employees that oversaw the provinces. And they were doing the deportations from\nthe provinces, and then in October, November, when the Jews of Budapest were being rounded\nup, they bring \u2014 they brought all of them back in to Budapest, and they were the ones who\nguarded us and took us in.

        "A: Okay. It's raining. Miserably cold. Middle European winter. We had some food with us\nbecause I took it -- we took it to our father -- to my father.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: I was wearing a pair of boots, knickers, which were my first grownup pants that I had got that\nyear. I wore a coat with a fur on it which is the one that looked so very Hungarian, typically\nHungarian, which later on helped, and I had a short waterproof jacket with a hood over it\nbecause it was raining. We also had blankets. We were told to take blankets with us, if I\nremember.",

But we did not know what was going on or what is going to happen to us.\nSo it was kind of a fatalistic attitude set in at that point. Felt rather powerless. And, in fact, you\nwere.",
        "A: Yes. They were unnaturally calm. And we were -- walked through the street under guard,\ntaken to -- across the Danube on a pontoon bridge because the main bridge\nwas accidentally blown by the Germans, supposedly. The Hungarians claim that they\nblew it, with people on it, including German buses in the summer. So the army put a\npontoon bridge across to an island, and from the island, we walked across the remaining part of\nthe bridge to the old part of Buda in to the brickyards which was the first stop on the cavalry that\nwe went through. The brickyard was a pretty horrible place. It was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nopen on three sides. It had a roof over it. We got there. It was fairly dark. There was no lights.\nIt was raining. And we were jammed in there so that nobody really had any room to even lie\ndown in the mud. And one of the recurring things that still haunt -- after 50 years -- there are a\nlot of things that came out later on where some of my fears and concerns came from. But I\nremember even today, my wife is a very independent person. And when we go to a museum, for\ninstance, she will disappear. She'll go ahead of me or behind me. And I get terribly anxious and\nvery angry.\nWell, of late, I decided the reason for that is -- is the first night in the brickyard because I had to\ngo to the bathroom real bad. And of course there were no latrines. There were some open areas\nwhere everybody squatted and did what they have to do, but then you had to find your way back\nin the pitch black. And I believe my mother had a flashlight. And so eventually, I remember\ngetting -- well, I caught up with her. I found where she was. But I remember the anxiety of -- of\nbeing in the pitch dark with hundreds, if not thousands of people milling about. And by that\ntime, people were crying. They were -- certainly knew that something that -- things are going to\nget real dicey, and there was no food, no water. And that was the beginning of the death marches\nwhere we were driven on day after day on the roads.",
        "A: I think overnight.",
        "A: Stayed overnight. And every day you moved --",

        "A: On -- onward to what turned out to be the Austrian border. The --",
        "A: We stopped at night, which also had an effect on me for all my life. If you were ahead of the\ngroup leaving, you were the first one to get to a marketplace where animals were sold in the day\ntime or the marketplace where the food was sold, so these were open areas with the junk and\nwith the animal droppings where you could pick a spot where you can sleep. These were all\nopen. And we're talking about mid-December in Europe, which is pretty harsh. Food was\nminimal. Once in a while, we got a piece of bread. I remember one bit of soup. And on one of\nthese, before stopping for the night, my mother gave that silver Omega watch away to get a loaf\nof bread. And we had no money. We had nothing left after that.\nThe march, itself, was pretty hairy. The idea was, of course, to drive us as fast as we can move\nso those who can't move can be shot and those were old and could move, they committed\nsuicide. There were people hanging from the -- from the trees and went on and on and on.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. That particular period is important for me because it became the catharsis,\nmaybe 30 years later, seeing the depiction of that march in a mini-series, Wallenberg \u2014 on\nWallenberg that Chamberlain did for television. It was a two-part series. And was the first one\nthat depicted this particular death march. And until that point, I was in total denial. Memories\nwhere I could see pictures of Auschwitz didn't mean anything to me. There was no emotion\nwhatsoever. And my sons and my wife, we watched it in a bedroom on a bed, and I broke up for\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe first time, and I broke down, and it was the first time I cried since Christmas of 1944. There\nwere never any tears no matter what happened.\nSo that march was really cataclysmic for me in terms of memories. Memory in a group that we\nwent with --let me just say again importance of being first was because you could sleep longer;\nyou could pick your spot. If there was food, the stragglers would get nothing, as they were not\nable to. So all my life, I have to be at the airports hours early. I have to -- I have to know\nexactly where I'm going, when I'm going to be there, and I'm always early.\nThose are just one of the few things that affected the rest of my life.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. She had a hard time keeping up, but we walked together all the way. We were strafed\nby Russian aircraft. On one occasion, because we had fire engines and soldiers in between the\nJews being taken, and so the Russians saw the fire engines and the\nsoldiers and they came strafing, but they did it -- the line was going on the road. They came\nacross. So when they shot at the engines and the soldiers, they were not strafing\ndown the road. So they didn't kill anybody. They did not kill, except people who were\naround those engines. And they were some of -- some of us, of course. But I remember\ncarrying the blanket and putting it over our heads because I think it was a pink blanket. And\nclearly to show the -- if the pilots even saw it or cared, that these were not soldiers that were\ngoing.\nIn one case, we ended up in the hull of a ship on the Danube where people were supposed to\nhave been pushed in to the water, those who couldn't walk. We saw some dead bodies. But we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwere in the ship. It was damp, and the clanging noise I remember still. It was just one of the six\nor seven stopover places before we got to the border.\nIt was roughly six or seven days, six or seven stops before we got to the border town of\nHegyeshalom to the railroad station.",
        "A: I think we have talked some. I remember, although not talking to her, but I remember that\nGerman troops, like newsreels people took newsreels of us. And I told my mother to look in to\nthe camera or at least went with my mother, and I pushed my hood back so if people see the\nmovie, they would see that my mother and I have been taken away. And I was -- I guess I was\nbasically targeting that if relatives or friends would know what happened to us because nobody\nwould know. We just -- contact was dropped. Nobody would know what happened to us.",
        "A: No. No. It was all strangers. And I don't know what happened to the -- you\nknow, clearly there were so many thousands moving on that the people that we left the house\nwith, they disappeared as soon as we got to the brickyard, the first stop really.",

        "A: They did not talk to us. They were beating some of the stragglers. I heard shots, knew what\nthat was about. So -- and during this strafing, they disappeared. And we still went on.\nUnderstand the circumstances that these were the old and the young, the women. I don't think\nthere were men in there. There had been. I have seen the suicides. They were men. But mostly\nwomen and children because the men have already been taken away. All the old ones really\ndidn't make it too far and they were killed. The idea was that it was no longer any rolling stock\nto deport the Jews of Budapest. Eichman wanted to finish the job. So this was a way of getting\nonly the strong ones to the Austrian border and getting rid of the rest.",
        "A: Young children.",
        "A: But I don't remember that I've seen too many much younger than I was, which was 15, 14. I\ndon't know what happened to the younger ones, whether they were left behind\nor just what happened, I don't know. But we were going on, and it was hard to trace\nwhere we've been. I remember the brickyard. I went back many years later to Hungary\nand tried to identify some of the places and had a hard time doing it. When I took my\nsons back to Budapest with me, the younger one wanted to walk with me the route that I took,\nwhich was very interesting. And we were looking for and driving around trying to find the\nbrickyard because that was probably -- that was more significant than anything else. It was the\nfirst stop. It was also, I think, unusually cruel being there with so many thousands, and it was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nraised and apartment houses stood in its place. So that was kind of a disappointment. I really\nwanted to show that to them. It would have given them a little bit more of a feeling. But the --\nthe trip of the six or seven days ended at Hegyeshalom, where the children under 16 were\nseparated from the adults. My mother gave me her wedding ring. We kissed goodbye and never\nsaw her again. Never found out what happened to her. I guess one of the people came back\nfrom the group that was taken away from the -- from the house, and she ended up in Bergen-\nBelsen but didn't know anything what happened to my mother. Just -- my mother disappeared in\nto thin air. Gone.\nWe were put in to a barn with perhaps 10, maybe a dozen children about the same age or a little\nyounger than I was.",
        "A: Boys and girls. And we stayed there hours overnight, and one day -- and this is what I told\nPer Anger last night -- that a German officer came, skinny, well-dressed, spit-polished German\nofficer came into a barn and told us children come\nwith me. We have a train going back to Budapest. And shortly after that, a civilian in a\nblack coat and hat came in and said don't believe the German. Stay here for a little while\nlonger, and I guarantee to take you back to Budapest.\nNow, Per Anger was there; Wallenberg was there; and Eichman was there. We'll\nnever know which one, but it -- certainly the black coat and the hat Wallenberg wore.\nCertainly the spiffy German uniform that Eichman wore, but at any rate, some of us -- and I\nthink it happened that I decided that the civilian makes more sense, and some of the kids\nremained with me. The others went with the German. I believe there was a classmate that went\nwith the German. And I have never heard from him, which doesn't necessarily mean that -- in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmy mind, it meant that he was dead. And the likelihood was very good that they were killed off\nshortly after that.\nThe effect was --",
        "A: I remember five or six, perhaps. Small group.",
        "A: I think so. It's -- it would be interesting to meet some of them that stayed with me, whether\nwe recall the same things or not -- but the effect was such that for many years after that, when\nsomebody asks me for an advice of anything, what to eat, what to wear, what to do, and I gave it\nand they did not follow it, I was unreasonably furious. And through therapy, it came out that\nprobably the reason was that if you don't listen me, then you will die. And when I was bringing\nup my children, who knew nothing of this, my reaction to some of these things were rather\nvociferous. But we were packed in to open cattle cars. Not really packed. It wasn't the usual 80\nor 100 people in there. But our doors were open because I remember I had to go to the\nbathroom. The train was moving, and I had to go, and so they were holding me up and I went.\nAnd it took us about three days, I think -- that's a recollection -- to get back to Budapest.",
        "A: People -- there were some adults. I am now assuming that they were people that\nWallenberg saved from the trains.",
        "A: The children. And we were -- we were not locked in. I think that the doors were closed at\nnight. But we closed it. And then we opened it again. So it was not -- it was clearly under the\nSweedish people that were organizing it and essentially manned the trains.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: And at night, we could see the muzzle flashes of the Russian artillery that was then circling\nBudapest. And we made it back to Budapest on a train without getting bombed, arriving, I\nbelieve, Christmas Eve. We arrived at the railroad station, not close to my house, but as I looked\nat it just last November, to the eastern station, and we walked off and were taken to the Sweedish\nhouses.\nNow, did I know that we were going to be taken to the Sweedish houses? I am not sure.",
        "A: Very little. Very little information, which surprises me, unless I'm walking it. But\nI remember some -- walking by a food store and somebody gave me an apple. I\nremember that. I also remember scribbling a message to the little Christian girl that was\nmy friend. Her family, by that time, moved from the house because only Jews were remaining\nbehind, in to a new apartment house. And I am guessing that -- because it makes sense, and I \u2014\nyou know, you're recreating history as to what's logical. So I'm not sure that it's true. But I was\nable to send a message to them because I knew where they\nwere, where they lived, and must have indicated to them where I'm going to be going,\nwhere I'm going to be taken. That's the reason I'm guessing that we must have known\nsomething.",
        "A: I don't remember.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: The only thing that I can recall on that train trip, that I had a piece of bread, which I horded\nand ate. And that was about the only thing that I remember eating. But I remember that I cried\non that train because I realized that I'm alone. I had no one to go\nto. I cried, and I did not cry again until my family and I saw the Wallenberg movie.",
        "A: I don't remember that. I am guessing no. By that time -- and even on the -- on the death\nmarch, there was really no connection with anybody. We were all foreign to one\nanother. We were all strangers. And we were all kind of in our own microcosm.\nThere was no heroism between people. There was no -- that I remember. There was no\nhelp being given because if you're helping somebody, you both could be shot. And so\nthe isolation, I believe, which is what made me break down and cry, that I was really totally\nalone. But having sent all that message, after having got off that train, we were\ntaken in to one of the Sweedish houses on the Danube. And we were fed something. I\ncan't remember what. There were thousands of people, or at least hundreds of people in an\napartment house. And I had to find a place to sleep, which I did. We were upstairs, probably\nfifth or sixth floor. And -- well, we did not go down to the cellar. There was too many people in\nthe house for that. So we never -- raids or really the artillery shells were coming in by that time.\nAs a matter of fact, the first artillery shell that I saw was\nChristmas Day -- jumping ahead. Sent a message to this little friend's family. Next\nday, which I believe was Christmas Day, it was a holiday, and there was a banging on the\napartment houses door, a Hungarian soldier was banging with his rifle, demanding to see and to\ntake Becker Ivan, and people told me that he's down there.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnd I went out, went through the gate, the door, and here was the soldier pointing a gun at me\nand said that he was sent to take me away. After we went a few steps, he said don't worry. I am\na friend of your acquaintances, and they have asked to fetch you and to bring you to their home.\nAnd so with a pointed gun, he marched me to their apartment house. And I met them, of course.\nThis is a father, the mother and two daughters, young one, which was my friend, 12 year old.\nShe was, by the way, the first girl that I went to the theater with. My parents took us to the\ntheater. So we were dropping back a few years. But just because she is going to surface for\nseveral years after that.\nBut the first theater prece we saw was Our Town in Hungarian in Backa. But at any\nrate, Christmas time, her sister, who was what, four or five years older than we were, or\nthat she was. So she had to be about 16, and they fed me. We had dinner together.\nAnd --",
        "A: Hungarian soldier.",
        "A: Scared. Didn't know what was going on, of course, and didn't quite know what to do. I mean\nI -- clearly I couldn't run because it would have been too easy to shoot. And so I went with the\nflow.",
        "A: And of course finding out that he was a friend, that was quite a load off my mind at\nthat point. The friend's -- their name is Kadar. They had another person there, a woman\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthere. And they have suggested, I believe, the daughter many years later told me that they asked\nme to stay with them, and that they will hide me because they have another woman that they\nwere hiding. And I refused to do so.",
        "A: Iam not sure whether I was afraid that if they find me, they are going to kill them, as well. I\nthink that would be very nice. But I'm not sure that was my driving point. I think, perhaps, that\nthe authority said that I should be in another house and that's where I should go back to. But --\nand here it becomes fuzzy. I do go back to the Wallenberg house, the Sweedish houses. I\nremember that. I remember also that during the bombing\nraid, one of the impacts was fairly close. I was eating a plate of food. And a door came\nout and cracked me across the face and my tooth chipped. And that is the only injury\nthat I have from the war, other than psychological and physical, just well-being, stomach\nproblems, etc. But that was the only thing where I bled. And my hearing got affected. But that\nwas not an injury. It was an explosion.\nBut nevertheless, in this period of time, I was back in the Sweedish houses and this is between\nChristmas and New Years. And I am assuming that our friends, the Kadars, took me out once\nmore because the rumors were heard that the Sweedish houses will be\nevacuated. There were military -- German military transports, horse drawn transports around the\nblock where the Sweedish houses were full of ammunition, and it was -- the Danube and the\nRussians were coming closer, and the assumption was that they were going to -- they need to fuel\nthe fire, and they're going to evacuate the Jews, whether they were Sweedish passports or not,\ntaking them in to the ghetto that was established in Budapest.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I did not get my Schutz-Pass until much later, and I went to the -- the Sweedish office not far\nfrom where the Sweedish houses were to get it. It was not handed to me. And I never used it as\na -- aS a Saving grace. It was really used as establishing an identity more than anything else\nbecause I had no papers. I have no birth certificate. I have no -- I have my father's passport, and\nthat's about the only thing that I have.\nBut in that period, being in the Sweedish house and getting out, going back to the Kadars, the\nconstant bombings, the artillery shells coming in, I mean we were, at that time, completely\nencircled, I think the Russians were already in Vienna. They were still fighting in Budapest.\nAnd hearing rumors that the houses will be moved in to the ghetto, I came out again, and without\nwearing the star, went back to the Kadars, and the Kadars heard, I believe, of a Red Cross shelter\nfor children. And I think it was just before New Years, end of December, beginning of January -\n- very beginning of January. One late afternoon, I was going in to that Red Cross shelter. And\nthey sent the youngest daughter, who was 12 at that time; I was 15, to go with me.\nSo these two gentile-looking children went across this dark abandoned bombed and\nshelled part of town, pitch dark, and went hand-in-hand to the address where I was to go.\nWe did not lose our way but were not sure where we were exactly. I saw a -- somebody in the\ndark, and I walked up; we walked up actually. And I asked him where the Red\nCross shelter was. And he flicked on his light and shined it on our faces. And I saw that he was\none of the Arrow Cross people. And of course I paled. And the girl didn't\nknow what I was scared of. And the guy looked at us and told us where the shelter was.\nNever asked us for papers. And she asked me why I was so scared. And I told her,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nvery reluctantly, she recalls later, that I told her that I was afraid that they were going to take my\npants off. And I didn't tell her why, that circumcision was something. And of course she was\nyoung. She didn't know it. But I would say 30 years later, she told me that she did not\nunderstand what I was worried about until she married her husband, who was Jewish. And then\nshe realized what could have happened.\nBut she left me and walked back through that dark town by herself, and again, 30 years later,\nmore than that, 40 years later, when I saw her in Switzerland, I asked her what made her do it, to\nwalk with me, and what made her parents suggesting that she did. And her reaction was that she\nfelt all her life, that she was not as important to her parents as her sister was. And she and her\nsister have not talked since the war days. Whether that's the reason they sent her and she just\ncame with me because we were friends.\nBut I ended up in this Red Cross shelter for a few days. We were taking care of babies, young\nchildren.",
        "A: I'm sorry?",
        "A: No, I don't. Never could find the building. I remember the layout. I remember\nthat we broke into -- because the houses were already -- people were taken away. I think\nthey were Jewish houses to begin with. And so the houses were empty or the people ran away.\nAnd we broke in to houses trying to find some leftover food to feed ourselves and to give it to\nchildren. Very hazy on that. But I remember very well that another guy, probably a little bit\nolder than I, we were sleeping on cots, and he was singing and I was\nsinging. We were singing \u201cIt's a long way to Tipperary.\u201d\u201d> Who knows where the song\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncame from. But the pronunciation was it's a long vay because we spoke no English. Didn't\nknow what we were singing. But it was kind of a defiant thing. I mean we could have again -- it\nwas stupid to do it. But we did it nevertheless.",
        "A: Yes. And I don't remember any of them. I remember some little ones, some young ones\nwalking about. But we were not the only ones taking care of them. There had to be some adults\nthere. We were just forging -- we were just forging around for food. Didn't last long because we\nalso heard a rumor that anybody over 10 or 12 years old will be taken away by the gendarmes or\nthe Arrow Cross.\nAnd so at that point, I went back to the Sweedish house, and shortly after that, the Sweedish\nhouse was evacuated and taken in to the ghetto.",

        "A: No. Not by that time. By that time, there was really no fear. It was not catatonic, but\ncertainly --",
        "A: -- a total numbness of going with it. Now -- and making decisions that essentially going right\ninstead of going left. It was the right decision. Running away. It was the right decision.\nHiding, trying to make a go of it. It just happened. Probably not, but probably it was the kind of\na primeval survival syndrome, the fight -- fear and flight\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsurvival. But we were taken in to the ghetto. I remember being very upset about it. It\ndidn't look good. It was tremendous numbers of people. And went in to a house with a\ncourtyard. And I was essentially taken in to one of the apartments and given a place to flop. I\ntook a down blanket -- not blanket, but -- what 1s this called?",

        "A: Same clothing. I was full of lice, but beautifully manicured because that was one thing that I\nwas fastidious about. Trimmed my toenails and my hand nails because my -- when I lived at\nhome, my mother used to have a manicurist coming in, who manicured her and just as a lark, did\nit for me, as well.\nShe was also a woman who brought us some milk and some food. Her husband was a German\nNazi and had pictures of her with her of him in a Nazi uniform. But she was a\nmanicurist for a long time for us. And so she was trying to help us. But when I was\ngetting in to -- when I got in to the ghetto, got this space in front of a huge double French\nwindow, and one early morning -- I don't know what made me pull the comforter over my head,\nbut within split second, there was an explosion with an incoming shell, blew the window out, all\nthe glass came tumbling down on me. And essentially, people had to get the glass off me before\nI could get up.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nBut then I had to move in to another house with pregnant women and young babies. And I\nalways worked, did something, somewhere, trying to pass the time really more than anything\nelse.",
        "A: No. No, I did not. It was really hard to stay alive and dodging bullets, although did some\nstupid things like watching people shooting at me, Russians, or Russian airplanes strafing me.\nBullets hitting the wall, missing me but pulling -- bullets were slamming in to five feet above my\nhead before I jumped.\nAnd in this particular Red Cross shelter, there was some food. Very little. I remember that we\nwere given some split peas that were originally, I understood, not for\nfood, but for sewing from the fields, and I remember at that time, my first real big bad\nstomach pain because we crushed it, crushed the -- those hard peas, made flour out of it,\nmixed it with a little water and then tried to make kind of a -- pancakes out of it and had terrible\nheartburn, which was the beginning of all my stomach problems.\nBut in this Red Cross shelter for the women, I was helping getting some food, getting\nprovisions.",
        "A: In the ghetto. There was some food, and they were trying to keep the women and the\nchildren alive. And so I was asked to go and get some basket of bread. And in\nbringing it back, at that point, I had not really have any food for days, if not weeks at that\npoint. I took some of the -- of the outside of the bread and I ate it on the way back. The\nresulting guilt trip lasted for 100 years after that. When my children were taking pennies out of\nmy pocket, well the younger one, I was terrible upset about stealing, and again, traced it back to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwhen I stole bread to survive. But the other aspect of that, working there, was that at least once I\nhad to make a trip to the morgue with a -- like a laundry\nbasket on my back, a woven basket with dead babies, and I remembered a feeling of\nmovement as I walked to the morgue. And they gave me a plate of beans, the first warm\nfood in weeks. And they gave me a -- what is it called -- a stretcher, blood-soaked \u2014 frozen,\nblood-soaked stretcher to take back somewhere. That -- those dead babies were -- that stayed\nwith me forever. When my children were young in their crib, I used to go in there at night to see\nwhether they were breathing or not because that part of it was extremely tough.\nAnd so I was not that blocked that I felt something at that \u2014 although, I did not feel that when I\ndid it. I mean I walked in to the morgue, which I tried to find and couldn't, where because it was\nso cold, the ground was frozen, the -- I think it was Amegra (ph), and the\ndead bodies were piled up like wood, and hundreds of them that eventually, of course,\nwere buried in a mass grave in the temple, the central temple garden, where when I was in\nschool, I used to sing during our holidays. And I stayed in that Red Cross shelter until liberation,\nwhich was 50 years ago today, this morning at 8:30, roughly.\nAnd during the period of time I was in a ghetto, again, I stayed upstairs, never went\ndown to the cellars, walked around with bullets whizzing around. I'm not sure I felt that I could\nnot be hit because I went through so much shit before, or I just didn't want to go down in to the\nshelters because I didn't want to be buried, I think. Maybe that -- it could\nbe that. I can't really guess at what the feeling was. But by that time, really went through such\nhell that nothing seemed to touch me, that I felt that I could just stand up and watch the Russians\ntaking pot shots at me. Because it was the latter stages of the siege of Budapest -- of Pest. And\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthey were coming close to the ghetto and in to the ghetto. And you could see them fighting\nhouse to house.\nThe last day I went down in to the shelter, maybe the last couple of days, and the Russian\nsoldier came through the wall of the shelter. In a shelter, there's inter-connecting shelters, which\nmean apartment houses for emergency purposes. There\nwas always a lightly-bricked over doorway. And they just broke through and came right\nthrough laying telephone lines.",
        "A: It was the first Russian. And --",
        "A: I -- I hugged him. I tried to hug him. He didn't know where the hell he was or what was\ngoing on. I mean the Russian shock troops were absolutely illiterate, from the Far East, looking\nvery much like Mongols. They -- they were illiterate, and they didn't know where they were.",
        "A: They lived off the land.",
        "A: I realized that it meant that the Germans were out. I took my -- took the star off and\nwas heading for where I used to live, and just before I got to the western railroad station, which\nwas maybe a mile away from the ghetto, there was a group of long, long line of soldiers,\npolicemen, postmen, anybody with uniform, was rounded about by the Russians and they looked\nat me and they looked at my coat and they pushed me in to the line of prisoners. I tried to tell\nthem that I was Jewish. They couldn't understand me and couldn't care less. And went \u2014 well,\nseveral blocks with them.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nEnd of File 2\nBeginning of File 3\nPart 3 of interview with Ivan Becker\nConducted by Gail Schwartz on January 18, 1995.\nQ. We were talking about liberation and you had left the ghetto and was trying to get back to\nyour apartment.\nA. And got pushed into the line of uniformed people guarded by just a few very young\nlooking Russian soldiers. And I went into the line with them, hung back to the end of the line,\nand when we got to a bridge that was going across the railroad yard, it had a Russian anti aircraft\ngun and placement right there on the bridge, I ran. Just cut out of the line, ran like hell, ran past\nthis post with the Russians, didn't shoot after me, and I managed to get home to where I lived for\nthe first time since the 13th of December. So we're talking about months and three days. So the\nenormity of what happened during that time a month and a half affects you for the rest of your\nlife. You think about it every day, you dream about it, nightmares never leave you, reactions\nremain the same. I hate to be stopped by policemen for speeding because I get scared stiff. I had\ntrouble when I was in the Army with officers because of the same fear of what I saw and what I\nwent through.\nBut I did get home, found no one, found nothing of what we had except the furniture, even my\ntoys were stolen, no clothing. I found a pair of shoes which I took and that's about the only thing\nthat was found at that time. I stayed there for a period of time by myself, staying in a house and\nevidently, going to in April 24th to a some organization that were that was helping Jews, the\nstamp is on here but not the year. So I have to assume that this was April 29th where I got some\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfood. I mean, I was forging. I was getting some food here and there. I remember I joined a\nyoung Communist league because they give you a pound of beans if you did. So I did that. That\nwas rather scary when I had to sign all sorts of affidavits that I never was a Communist, which I\nnever was, but I was very hungry. But before this period of time, one of my uncle, who\nremember I took to his troop food because they were across, one of my uncle's comrades came\nback looking for me. He was liberated, he was the only one. My uncle died typhus, typhoid, but\nhe wanted to see if we were alive or not. Now, that was the time when I started thinking of my\nparents again and looking every corner that they are going to come around the corner and they're\ngoing to find me.\nThere was a movie a few years back called the Empire of the Sun where it was playing in either\nSingapore or Shanghai where a British family when the Japanese were occupying or coming into\nShanghai, their son got separated and looked for his parents and reunited with his parents and I\nwas hysterical in the movie and that feeling was always there from decades after the liberation\nwaiting that maybe the next ring in the apartment that I have was going to be my parents because\nI left messages all over the place. But clearly, they didn't come back and I didn't wait for them to\ncome back.\nI went with this man to Transylvania. We traveled well, we first traveled on top of a freight\ntrain and we left from the western radio station across the street, stole some nails, he had some\nneedles and thread, and we were going to try to make our way to see if any of my relatives in\nTransylvania came back or was there more food less Russians. We had a rather nasty situation\nwhere the Russians had a free month of looting and raping in Budapest because of some things\nthat happened somebody told me wasn't true but we heard that the Germans killed the Russian\ndelegation that came to ask for their surrender. And what I was just recently told that it was the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nRussians who killed their own to use as an excuse. Who knows what the truth is but 1t was a\npoint where the Russians were just shooting people on the street, do anything they wanted to for\n30 days. The 31st day, the Russian officers were shooting their men if they did something wrong,\nthat was the atmosphere. So I clearly wanted to get away with this guy.\nWe got on top of the train, a freight car, and I was___ there was, I don't know, 10 15 people on\ntop of the car, it was filled with people down below. And I watched a kid kicking a hand\ngrenade around, playing football with it, and it exploded. So my left ear is pretty bad, went deaf\nfor a while. People were hurt by shrapnel around me, never scratched, absolutely never\nscratched. And we few days in the winter this is January, maybe before February Ist even, but\ncertainly after January 18th, a couple weeks after I think, we arrived to Oradea Nagyvarad which\nis where my father's family lived. And I didn't know, at what point do we cut off\nQ. Well the\nA. the reminiscence because it goes on and on and on.\nQ. Just generally what happened in those months?\nA. Winding up.\nQ. Where you went and\nA. Okay. We ended up in Nagyvarad and I was in Nagyvarad until August of 1945. I fell in\nlove and the girl decided to go to Israel. I was 16, she was 17, beautiful girl. And at that time, the\nJewish brigade of the British Army was operating in the occupied area, Russian occupied area,\ntrying to get Jews who are returning out into Israel. And I got caught up in the exodus, the Alley\nof Beth (sic), put me into a kibbutza and went to Hungary, back to Hungary, and then was forced\npapers and ended up in Austria DP camp.\nQ. Where in Austria were you? Well, any way, you stayed\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nA. I remember\nQ. so you stayed with her, she was doing this also?\nA. I stayed with her until I got. we had a jealous tiff and I went on but we were first in\nVienna transit camp. Vienna was under four party occupation but in the middle of the Russian\nzone so we had to be evacuated. We had to be taken out. I left with her there and I went out to\nLinz. Linz Donau is where I walked across the Russian border from the Russian zone to the\nAmerican zone and ended up in an old SS camp in town called Wels, W E LS, in Austria and\nthat was the end of the odyssey as it were. But of course after that, I didn't get to the United\nStates until a year later.\nQ. So you stayed in Austria for that year?\nA. In Austria I stayed in Wels and then I was transferred, I guess in about December of\n1945, to a show displaced persons camp and by gosh darn in Austria. And in September of\n1946, as a war orphan, was taken to the United States to an orphanage in New York.\nQ. You came by boat?\nA. Yes, very small boat for a very long time\nQ. What was the name?\nA. it was miserable weather. Marine Marlin.\nQ. And landed in New York?\nA. Landed in a lower bay New York. Of course, there was a strike so we had to unload our\nboat. I had a suitcase with I think I must have had a shirt in it. I know I had made in one of the\nDP camps in the Wels camp an American blanket, pair of pants, and an Eisenhower jacket. And\nthen in the other camp, my route 1s from here sent me a pair of pants I think and a shirt, I think,\nunless I got it from the Onra (sic).\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nQ. When you were in the DP camp, did you do anything activity wise?\nA. Yes, always, always.\nQ. What did you do?\nA. I became a storekeeper for the camp. I had a bodyguard because I looked too Germanic\nand the Polish Jews who are coming back from Auschwitz and was coming through being\nrepatriated looked at me and I didn't speak Hebrew and I didn't speak Yiddish and so they\nassumed that I was German. And so there were life threats. So I had a body guard that came\nwith me all the time, six feet tall. I was 16.\nQ. Did you feel very old?\nA. Well, I never felt young after that. I mean, really after being taken away, I was totally\nformed although misformed, if you will, and I never felt like a child, really. I never felt like I\nfelt like a child but not as an adolescent, adolescence didn't happen. I used to joke about that I\nhad a midlife crisis at 20 and probably true. But I was always working in the camps, I always did\nsomething to get paid or food or clothing for and I got recommendations. I still have from the\nOnra that I worked if I remember such a job and have looked at it for a while but I did work.\nMade up my own identification card, which happens to be true. Young as I look, I was still born\nin 1929 because I have a telegram that my mother sent in my name the day I was born saying to\nmy grandmother that I arrived June 14, 1929. I was also told that I believe Kersler was the first\nperson out of the family that saw me. The child Artie Kersler, I believe it was Kersler, or one of\nthe other German. This is 1929.\nQ. Yeah. And he saw you?\nA. Yes. He saw me after I was born. He was the first outside of the family to see me I'm\ntold.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nQ. Because he was a friend of the family?\nA. Family told me.\nQ. He was a friend of the family?\nA. He was a friend of my uncle's evidently of the artist so but I had no papers except this\nwhich didn't have my birthday but it had my year on it.\nQ. Then you. okay. So you came to the United States you stayed in the orphanage\nA. For a few days.\nQ. for a few days and then where did you go?\nA. I went to my aunt and uncle and slept in the living room. They were living up in the\nBronx. Poor people basically.\nQ. When did you arrive in the United States?\nA. September 16, 1946. I stayed with them for two weeks. After two weeks, they told me\nthey wanted me to go to school but they showed me an accounting, a ledger, of how much I cost\nthem in the two weeks and told me they really can't afford it. So I decided to I took the subway\nand went downtown and happened to be on 7th Avenue, which at that time, was where most of\nthe photo studios were and photo labs and I went from place to place, not speaking English very\nwell very little because I studied it in the DP camp actually. The teacher was a Nazi Baron,\nHungarian Baron, who spoke BBC English. So I came here with speaking not very many words\nbut old British English. I did get a job in a photo lab. And because of my background in gravure\nand photo engraving, which is what I did in the printing plant in '45, somehow I found a job as\nan apprentice on 23rd = on 22nd Street in New York. And I started working, hoping, trying to\nget into the union to establish a trade. And I was good enough that I did my boss's job. I closed\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe doors and I did always work. Generally, cleaned photographic glass plates in nitric acid with\nbare hands, washing my hands with cyanide.\nQ. So you adjusted\nA. I adjusted\nQ. to the new country?\nA. to the new routine.\nQ. And then just again the pattern your life took.\nA. The pattern\nQ. You stayed in New York?\nA. I stayed in New York. I was always working either in the graphic arts or in silkscreen\nprinting. Lived in the Bronx with a friend of mine who I knew from Transylvania who came\nhere much later skipping the displaced persons camp, and being drafted during the Korean War\nin 1951. Went to military intelligence school became core photographer, never went overseas\nbut went through military intelligence training.\nQ. When did you become a citizen?\nA. After I got discharged. They didn't have [I didn't have the time to get my citizenship\nuntil '53 so it was seven years instead of five years without being a citizen. But I went through\nintelligence school without having a birth certificate which was absolutely no sense to anybody.\nAnd people are looking at me I was crazy. First of all, you don't speak English, which not very\nwell, certainly still after six years or five years initially, didn't have a birth certificate, and they\nput me through intelligence school. It's the usual Army routine. But came out in '53, joined this\nfriend of mine that I used to room with in starting to work in the plastics business making plastic\nbags which were very new in 1953 and really worked in that area until now.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nQ. Then you got married?\nA. I got married in 1962. My children were born in '64 and '67. In '67, I started a plastics\nbusiness for a company on the American Stock Exchange, became their Division Manager, and\nended up as Chief Executive and President of the company in 1988. Went through hell in\nbetween but different kinds of hell.\nQ. Can we now talk, which you have alluded to so far, about some of your feelings and\nthoughts about what you went through though you have expressed some. How do you feel about\nbeing Jewish now considering what you did go through in the war?\nA. Well, I think there's two periods of time; one, certainly after after coming back or after\ngoing through the ghetto, I did not deny it but I did not practice. I did not go to synagogue or a\ntemple until I got until I met my wife. Her father was came out to the States from Russia but\nhe was about the same age as I was, became a pharmacist. And was while not very religious,\ncame out of orthodox home and kept the high holidays. They were the first who invited me to go\nto synagogue with them and it was the first time I went after 1944. So 1964, in 20 years, no\nJewishness whatsoever. Didn't deny it but didn't identify it because I was afraid of what's going\nto happen here, that it could happen here. And the fact I remember when I came to the States\nand found out that most everybody every man is circumcised, and that you didn't have to have an\nidentification card, and you didn't have to report to the police, that was the first time I remember\nrelaxing.\nBut nevertheless, I tried to assimilate again and spoke no Hungarian, practiced no Judaism for\ncertainly 20 years and Hungarian even beyond. And I managed to learn quite well to speak\nwithout an accent on me. I was surprised that Tom Lantos, yesterday, very strong Hungarian\naccent, the Ambassador to the U.S. who spoke beautiful English and Lantos couldn't. And\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nLantos and his wife and I were at the same time, I'm assuming or within days of one another of\nthe Wallenberg Houses in Budapest. I met him yesterday, cold fish, didn't even try to be nice.\nHe's a politician on the one hand, which I understand. On the other hand, he was not very\nhuman, stuffed shirt like.\nQ. What about your father, how did you\nA. My father died in Bonneval (sic) in the 10th of January\nQ. How did you find that?\nA. My uncle, who ended up in Israel, found his name in one of the rolls. So he died a month\nafter I took\nQ. When did you find that out?\nA. I don't remember, probably somewhere in '47 -'48, pretty soon after when the war started\ncoming out and when the logs were starting to be available.\nQ. Had you was that devastating?\nA. It was pretty devastating because it was a closure which never happened with my mother.\nSo my mother would be now in her'90s__ this is'95 she was born in '99 so it'll be impossible\nfor her to have lived.\nQ. Do you receive war reparations?\nA. No because I was not in a concentration camp and I was not long enough in dire straits, if\nyou will, so I never would qualify for it. And I didn't want to lie. I could have. There was\nnobody I didn't want to lie about the fact that I was in a concentration camp and came back to\nHungary and then I took the Alley of Beth (sic) out. There was nobody to tell me.\nI wanted it behind me essentially to the point where I always wanted a lacquer that was a\nphotographer when I was 12 and I always wanted and I did get myself a Rolex and love to have a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMercedes. I went back to Germany and I went back to Hungary and I really didn't have too\nmany problems with it, again, blocking it. It's the Hungarians who were the worst to me but of\ncourse the German were the cause and so I couldn't hate so much of Europe not to ever travel or\nbe there again.\nI did business with Germans. I did business with Hungarians. Just recently, I was in a house\nwhere in Munich where my host, who was a businessman, told me about the house that there\nwas an actress who lived up on the top floor, mistress of a famous surgeon, and had Hitler. He\nsaid Hitler came here very often, you know, and\nQ. Did you say anything?\nA. No, no, no. I was an American as far as he was concerned. There was no point in saying\nanything. But I was there with a British heir and my boss was Christian and he was appalled. He\nwould not want to do business with him for all the tea in China and I was just going to smile.\nThe only other things that which may or may not be of any interest that the two women, the two\ngirls that I knew as a young man and was essentially in love with both, different times, they have\nsurfaced. A Christmas card just this past month from the 12 year old whom I met twice in\nEurope, 25, maybe 40 years after the things. And I have met the girl that I was in love with that I\nleft Hungary with. She still haven't heard from her lately but she lived in Munich and in Berlin\nand the story was very specific to our generation but equally interesting. So the past shows up.\nAnd I was in Budapest twice in November. I was in Slovakia helping some Slovaks and this is a\nreflection. During the Death March went through the town called Dure in Komarno on the\nDanube. I was in Bratislava in Slovakia helping Slovak Hungarians evaluate some business as a\nvolunteer executive. And I saw a Hungarian broadcast of the premier of the Fiddler on the Roof\nin Hungarian from this town that was ethnically cleansed and it was a tremendous success\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\naccording to the narrator. And here on the stage where the did you see it? Did you see the\nshow? This typical Orthodox Jews with the tolus and the pius dancing and singing in Hungarian.\nAnd I couldn't imagine the people of those towns going to see it because they saw us being\ndeported, all the Jews were deported. So how come this is such a success? Can't understand it.\nBut I mean again, it takes you back. Everything continues to take you back and there's always\nsome revelation.\nSo it's a life that was so affected and I guess what I try to do, rightly or wrongly, not to have my\nchildren grow up as children of survivors which has its own bad psychological syndrome. They\nare affected by more than even a survivors. But we went through family therapy together with\nmy wife and so that she could understand it a little bit more, so the children can understand it,\nand they seem to have grown up to be _ the two boys really normal American kids with some\naffinity towards Judaism, Hungary. We took them back to and took them through where I went\nto school and the affect was not bad on them which is good.\nThe children and I went back with my wife in the '80s, took them back to the house where I was\nliving, the schools that I went to, and as a matter of fact, interestingly enough, Cartie, who I met\nat lunch, her brother went to the same elementary school as I did. He's evidently the same age as\nIam. Sol promised to I did get, by the way, people found and sent to me some geography\npictures and my mother's cook book. And amongst the childhood pictures are some of the class\npictures from the elementary school and a lot more including the one that's in there. But I guess\nwhat was curious my mother taught me to be independent and take care of myself and this is the\nlate '30s, early '40s when that was not in vogue. She certainly came from a traditional middle\nEuropean homemaker background, not professional person. But she taught me how to sew and\nhow to cook and how to bake, 1n case, in case what, you know, I ask now. They never told me to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nexpect something that will happen and I don't know if they were aware of it. But to this day, I\nbake from her book that she and I used to bake Saturdays cakes for Sunday.\nI still made just yesterday I finished up a Zahar Tort that is given to my sons and now to be a\nwife for birthdays. It gets frozen and air shipped wherever they are. They also cook. They don't\nbake they don't have to be competitive. They also take pictures which I did when I was 12 and I\nhave my first picture still. So I feel that I imparted some good things and it wasn't that bad that\nthey didn't know early on what was happening to their father and to their family, their\ngrandfather, their grandmother, and all their relatives. They never had nightmares about it so I\nthink that it worked well that they find out about it under professional guidance. I think that was\nthe big thing. It may have been very difficult for them at that time but it did not affect them\nbecause the explanations were there and so there is no guilt.\nOne of them just married a French Canadian Catholic girl. He's trying to wrestle with the fact\nthat how should they bring their children up, if any. His wife told him that she's elapsed Catholic.\nHis wife told him that if he really believes in Judaism and Jews and a Jewish religion and the fact\nhe's wrestling with where I came from and what I went through, that she'll be happy to bring\ntheir kids up as Jewish and he's wrestling with it whether he should or should not. It'll be\ninteresting to see what happens. Their older son married a Jewish girl and we have a grand dog at\nthis point.\nQ. Is there anything else you would like to share about what you went through?\nA. I don't know.\nQ. Any messages you'd like to leave your children?\nA. I think they got the messages and that was, unfortunately, in a way pessimism I call it\nrealism that it certainly can happen again. During McCarthy times I remember that it could have\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\neasily happened again. With some of the far right coming into vogue around the world, it could\nhappen again. It's certainly happening again in Yugoslavia to Africa. They should be aware of\nit. They should perhaps look at people and evaluate them before they make commitments,\nbefore they entrust their lives with it with some people.\nJust to go back on the Swiss passport, the Swiss papers that were being sold which we couldn't\nafford to buy, I testified at the guy's trial because I was not the only one who was terribly angry\nbut there were others and I testified that we probably could have been saved.\nQ. Which trial was this?\nA. There was a trial in Hungary, in Budapest, bringing some of the people, the collaborators,\nor some of the people who did not help when they hindered rather than helped. The neighbor was\na Jew and he would not give us. He wanted to sell us the Swiss Schutz Passes and so I went to\nCourt and I made a deposition that I was aware of that fact that he did this.\nQ. When was the trial?\nA. It was in Budapest somewhere. It never came to be because he died of a heart attack\nbefore the trial. But I had a certain feeling of satisfaction at that point that I did something.\nQ. What year was that?\nA. 1945, early '45.\nQ. Early '45?\nA. Early '45.\nQ. Could you just again go into a little bit of detail about how you got your Schutz Pass?\nA. It's hazy but Iremember that the not the embassy but it had to be an office that,\nguessing, Wallenberg had set up. He satellite offices as I understood it. And somehow I found\nout about it. Being in a Swedish house but not having been handed the document, I went to get it\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand I remember hundreds of people outside clamoring to get in and I got in and somebody typed\nthis up and got it. But, it was really a fullback position. It never was used, would not have by\nthat time and this would have to be in January, by that time, these things were not worth very\nmuch, only occasionally would they help and I just didn't need it but it was something good to\nhave in case.\nSo really my closest meeting was in the barn with the children that I have come close to a Sweed\nor a Swedish delegate or somebody who worked for Wallenberg. I was pretty much on my own\nother than that. It was very hectic and I had to make decisions whether to stay or move on or\nand went and then went back and still got back into the ghetto, which may have been the best\nthing that happened to me at that point. Certainly, my belief in God nose dived after that and\ncertainly couldn't understand, which is what everybody asks, how can God let this happen and\nthere was never any answer.\nThe affect 1s ever lasting and I started talking about this to young people what I went through\nonly very recently and I guess the reason for it is perhaps because people started asking. My own\nfamily in America did not have any idea what I went through. They never asked me. To them, it's\nAO years later it's a total surprise. My in laws never knew about it. They knew I came out but not\nwhat came before it. It was very touching.\nI went Nancy's uncle was dying of cancer just recently and we have been close to them because\nI liked him and I liked his wife and not so much the rest of the family but he and I never talked\nabout this and we knew that he's not going to live much longer. So we went really to say good\nbye to him up in Vermont and Massachusetts where they retired and we talked about it then. And\nthey were flabbergasted that they never asked and they don't know why they didn't ask but they\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfound out and they were _ they felt better for it. But there's no asking. I mean, when the little\ngirl, the 12 year old 40 years later or I asked why she came with me, she couldn't answer it.\nIwas I escorted Miskia (sic) and her husband to receive the award from one of the Wallenberg\norganizations in New York. I asked them what made them try to save the family, the front\nfamily, and they couldn't tell me. So I'm not the only one who has no answers. It happens. It's a\nreaction to an occurrence and it's kind of instantaneous. It's not premeditated very often. In\nsome cases, of course it was. Giorgio Perlasca and the Japanese envoy that was premeditated.\nThe front family saving was not premeditated. It was do it quickly because it has to be done,\nthey're friends. Therefore, we have to save them.\nI often ask how sympathetic I would be, what would do, I don't have the answer. I don't believe\nI'm brave enough to do it but then you don't know until you get there. And hopefully it'll never\nbe tested. Hopefully never will people be faced with decisions of life and death ever again but\nthat's too optimistic to believe. I guess that's really basically it.\nQ. Well, thank you very much for doing the interview.\nThis concludes the interview of Ivan Becker. It took place on January 18th, 1995, in Washington\nD.C.
