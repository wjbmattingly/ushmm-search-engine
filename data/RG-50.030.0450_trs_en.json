        "Answer: ...was Eva Irene. She was born in 1927. My family background was that I\nam, my parents were completely assimilated in German culture and in the German way of\nlife and there were very few of Jewish observances. My mother went with us to the\nsynagogue on the high holidays, that is the only thing I remember. I remember much\nmore distinctly, however, that we celebrated Christmas, we had a Christmas tree every\nyear, Santa Claus came and distributed gifts and I grew up really knowing very little\nabout being Jewish except I knew that I was Jewish. My, also my father had a very\nextensive library, he was actually generally very widely read and widely educated. I do\nnot remember any Jewish books, the books that we had were just general literature,\nGerman writers, Shakespeare, of course. The particular pride of my father was a 54\nvolume edition of the collected works of Goethe, the German playwright and philosopher\nof the early 19th Century. We were, as far as I can tell, relatively well off. We went on\nsummer vacations every year and I particularly was sent during the summer vacations,\nfrom maybe the age of 10 on or so, to acamp. These camps were usually all Jewish\ncamps. They were headed usually by a Jewish sports teacher and were located, they were\ndifferent from American camps in that they didn't have a specific camp location, but\ninstead the head of the camp, the sports teacher, would contract with some vacation\nowner of a building, of a vacation house, in the mountains or near the sea to rent that\nhouse for a period of about four weeks, I guess, or six weeks, and then he would take the\nkids to that place and, of course, with a number of assistants and so on. I personally\nwould have liked much better to be going on vacations with my parents, but my father\nworked very hard and I was always told that my father needed complete rest and\nrelaxation and that it was just too much of a commotion if we kids would also come\nalong. And usually what happened was, after a few days of being home sick then I got\nsort of sucked into the activities of the camp, made some friends and, in some of the\ncases, actually some school friends of mine from the school in Berlin were at the same\ncamp, so I had already ready-made friends there. From then on, I usually enjoyed these\nvacations. My contacts with Judaism really became stronger basically out of two events.\nThe first one was Hitler's assumption of power in, generally, 1933, where in the school\nwhere I was I was made to feel that I was different. The first year there was very little\nNazi activity in the school. The school I went to, incidentally, was the Mommsen\nGymnasium named after the German historian of the Roman Empire, Theodor\nMommsen, who actually personally was a very liberal minded historian. And\nGymnasium, in German means really classical high school. That school received, got a\nnew principal in the year 1934, he was a retired Army colonel who had fought in the First\nWorld War and also was a through and through convinced Nazi ideologue. And right\nafter his assumption of the principal-ship, he announced in a school assembly that it is his\ngoal to make the school a sort of example for Nazi ideological indoctrination. At that\npoint, many Jewish kids were taken out of that school by their parents and sent to other\nschools. I stayed in and after one year of that principal, only two kids, Jewish kids, were\nleft, another boy and I. The principal introduced all kinds of new activities like, for\nexample, before the beginning of the school day, the entire school had to assemble for\nsort of like a military roll call. Behind the school building there was a big sports field\nand we assembled there and had to stand at military attention and while the principal read\na particular paragraph that he had selected for that day out of Hitler's book, Mein Kampf,\nas sort of motto for the day. And during lunch hour, after we had eaten our food, we\nusually marched, the entire school in military formation, through the streets of the\nneighborhood, singing Nazi songs. After one year of his principal-ship, as I said there\nwere two kids left, and he asked us to come into his office and that, in Germany, where\nthe principal in general is a much more fearsome authority than you see now. In addition\nto that, of course, we knew where he stood, for us 1t was a somewhat intimidating\nexperience. When we were in his office he told us that he could not really see having\nJewish children in his school, which he wanted to make as a purely Germanic or Aryan\nschool serving as an example for all other schools in Germany. But, he also had no legal\nway to expel us from the school, so he thought about it and came to the following\nconclusion, that there were basically two options. Either our parents withdrew us\nvoluntarily or he would simply resign the principalship because he would not be able,\nunder those conditions, to carry out his goals, and with that message we were sent home.\nOur fathers got together on the telephone and discussed that this was obviously a veiled\nthreat and we were never sent back to that school.",
        "Question: I was surprised when you mentioned that you were sent to a Jewish camp.",
        "A: Yeah, well, after 1933, there was increasing pressure really for, to keep Jews and\nnon-Jews apart. I think maybe in '33 or '34, I may still have been in a mixed camp, but\nafter that, such camps simply didn't exist anymore. Actually, there was an additional\nreason, that all youth activities for Germans were progressively taken over by the Hitler\nYouth Organization. They went on summer excursions, on hikes and so on, and German\nchildren initially were just sort of socially pressured to participate, but I think in the\nmid-'30's, I don't remember the year, maybe '36 or so, it was actually made compulsory,\nthat every German kid, as a boy, had to be in the Hitler Youth and it had a parallel girls\norganization which was called, it was a German word, Bund Deutscher Madel , it means\nAssociation of German Girls, and girls were compulsorily in that organization. And if\nthere were any organizations outside of the Hitler Youth, they definitely would not be\npermitted to have any Jewish children in them, so that was not a religious thing, these\ncamps. Actually, I remember one camp where I was where the head was actually a\nwoman sports teacher and she was a very strong Zionist and she would have Friday\nevening Shabbat ceremonies and carry on other Jewish activities. And in all the other\ncamps, they were Jewish only to the extent that both the head and teachers, as well as all\nthe kids, were Jews, but otherwise, there were no Jewish related activities.",
        "Q: Now, prior to Hitler, do you remember any instances of antisemitism, did you get\nalong well with your neighbors and your schoolmates?",
        "A: Yes. No, I mean, I don't remember such instances. I always got along, the strange\nthing is that practically all, with one exception, all of my friends were always Jewish\nkids. That happened somehow naturally, I don't know. There was truly no, I wasn't told\nby my parents to have Jewish friends exclusively, but that's the way it turned out. But\neven after Hitler came to power, I had, I mean I had no, I do not remember any incidents\nwhere I was either attacked or had any violence on the part of my German school\nchildren. In fact, initially, my reaction to the Nazi seizure of power was that I felt sorry\nfor myself for not being an Aryan, I mean, a German kid, and that I couldn't participate in\nall the what I considered fun things that they were doing, games and so on, and it was\nreally only after I was expelled from the German school, actually, let me back up. I said\nearlier that my relationship to Judaism changed drastically for two reasons. I mean, one\nwas Hitler's accession to power and, which basically forced me to confront my\nJewishness, the other was my bar mitzvah, which came up in 1935 and which required\nme to take, several times a week, preparatory lessons, both for my, for the parshah which\nI was going to read from the Torah on the Shabbat during services on my bar mitzvah, as\nwell as additional sort of Jewish history and some Hebrew. And that, and then on top of\nit also, in 1935 was my expulsion from the Mommsen Gymnasium by this antisemitic\nprincipal, and my parents then transferred me to a very orthodox Jewish school. That has\nalways been a puzzle in my mind, my parents never explained it. There were other\nJewish schools which were much less orthodox, but they transferred me to the most\northodox of Jewish schools in Berlin. In fact, it was a school associated with a sort of\nseparatist congregation, the, all of the, the rest of the Jewish community was in one large\nsort of super congregation, I think that is in most European cities like that, where Jewish\ncommunal life, is handled by one big congregation and that congregation also is\nresponsible for building synagogues according to different needs. I mean, there were one\nor two reform synagogues in Berlin and many what was called liberal synagogues, that\nwas the sort of predominant denomination. In spite of the name, the liberal synagogues\nwere about very close to what is called conservative here in this country. The service\nwas almost entirely in Hebrew with only one or two prayers in German, however, in most\nliberal synagogues, organs were also present and otherwise, the service, also the selection\nof prayers, was basically the same as that in the conservative synagogues and much more\nextensive than in the reform synagogues 1n this country, but all of the synagogues were\nessentially the responsibility of this central congregation and also there were a number of\northodox synagogues. But the school into which I was transferred to was from a\nseparatist, very orthodox congregation affiliated with the Agudas Yisrael which is a\nworldwide sort of umbrella organization of orthodox congregations. I think the reason\nwas that school had an excellent reputation, while it obviously taught a lot of Judaism,\nHebrew and Jewish history and so on, but they, of course, they still were governed by the\nGerman education law and had to provide, therefore, all of the curriculum that regular\nGerman schools had to offer in mathematics and science and literature and so on. But,\nobviously, that was a tremendous change for me, a change of cultures. Coming from the\nmilitaristic Nazi school, now to a very orthodox Jewish school which, at the beginning\nwhen I came there, seemed to be without any semblance of discipline. I, myself, have\nalways been somewhat of a rebel in the sense that I resented authority, and even in the\nMommsen Gymnasium, which was governed by this Prussian ex-officer, there were a\nnumber of boys to whom I also belonged to, sort of tried to get away with things. Now\nwhen I came to that Jewish school, I really reveled in the fact that there seemed to be no\ndiscipline at all and people even talked back to their teachers and I must say, I enjoyed\nthat very much and in spite of that, the funny thing is I learned. The thing is that the\nexcuse for extreme discipline is always that it is needed in order for the kids to learn, I\nmean I realize there has to be a certain amount of discipline, but in the German schools,\nat least at the Nazi time, that was an ideology by itself, in its own right, discipline, of\ncourse, as a preparation for later military.",
        "Q: Now, didn't you experience antisemitism from your schoolmates at the Mommsen\nschool?",
        "A: I don't, no I didn't. In fact, one, I remember that one of my non-Jewish, we weren't\nreally friends, but we sort of spent some time together frequently in school during\nintermissions and so on, recess is the word, recess, he was, he had joined the Hitler Youth\nand he had given me a small Hitler Youth pennant with a swastika which I proudly\ndisplayed. And, unfortunately, it turned out that on that day we had, at home a party, I\nforgot what the cause was, there were relatives there and, of course, all the people who\ncame were Jews, and in the middle of it, I burst with my swastika flag and holding it\nproudly and marched in there. And I remember that my mother took me very forcefully\nby my arm, took me out to my room and gave me a horrific beating and told me that I\nshould never dare to bring that flag home and she tore it up and I felt terribly sorry for\nmyself and felt as a victim of, but as I said, that was in the beginning when I felt that\nbeing Jewish was basically a punishment and it took a number of jolts for me to realize\nreally what was behind that and also what my Judaism really meant to me. The\nantisemitism that I encountered was mainly from the teachers. That principal, maybe I\nforgot to mention that he also taught, that was I think common in German schools, and he\nwas our math teacher and he made frequent antisemitic remarks and derogatory remarks\nabout Jews in his mathematics class. And then we had a German teacher who was, if\nanything, even worse and, on the other hand, some of the older teachers were very\ndemocratic. Our Latin teacher was an elderly gentleman, in fact was the only teacher\nwith whom, to whom my mother took me after I left school, very, from one day to the\nnext, to say goodbye. And he lived only a few blocks away from us and we went there\nand he was, I still remember, very nice to me and shook my hand and wished me all the\nbest of luck for my future. So, I think some of the older teachers were definitely not\nNazis and most of the younger ones were. In addition, of course, the principal who was\nan elderly gentleman, he must have been already in his late 50's at that time.",
        "Q: How did you feel hearing these remarks by your teachers? Do you remember?",
        "A: I felt hurt, basically. I felt that, I mean, it was really like a physical slap in the face,\nexcept this was not physical but emotional. I mean, I felt, even at that time, that the men\nhad no reason to attack me that way.",
        "Q: Did you talk about this with your parents? Did they make some sense out of it for\nyou?",
        "A: I don't remember it, but it's possible that I did. I don't, I mean there are many things\nthat I don't really understand about my parents and I feel in a way terrible about it. Of\ncourse, in the beginning I was too little, but later on I was a teenager and then finally an\nupper teenager and even 20 years old by the time they were arrested. And, but I don't\nreally understand many of the actions they took and their motivations. That is one of the\nthings I have been trying for years and years sort of to reconstruct, no understanding now\nhow they thought and what their mental sort of outlook was to explain why they acted the\nway they did. It's very difficult, for example, my father's decision during the first years\nof Hitler not to emigrate was based, that is one thing, one of the few things I can\nunderstand, as strange as it may sound. But the thing was that Jewish lawyers, a large\ngroup of, the majority Jewish lawyers were disbarred within a few weeks after the Nazis\ntook power. There were two groups of lawyers which were exempted, one were the front\nline soldiers from World War I, which my father was not, the other one were lawyers\nwho had already been admitted to the bar under the Kaiser, that means before the\noutbreak of World War I and that's the category my father fell in. And many of the\nlawyers who were then disbarred lost their livelihood over night and the only thing they\ncould do, unless they wanted to dig ditches in Germany, was to emigrate, and most of\nthem did. On the other hand, my father always considered himself lucky that he was\nexempted because at each stage of the Nazi development of their antisemitic policies, the\nJews always were under the illusion that this is the way, okay, the Nazis want to do\nbusiness and that's, but we can live with it and that's the way it's going to remain. In\nretrospect, the fact that my father was in one of the exempted groups, was not his luck,\nbut it was his death sentence because otherwise he would have left Germany. In fact, one\nremark I still remember vividly, when the others urged him to emigrate, he would say,\nhere I am a lawyer, if I go to New York, all I can become is a dishwasher, and what shall\nI do with German law in New York? You know, logically, that made total sense, in '35,\nwho would have ever thought of gas chambers? Plus, the thought also was that since\nHitler was constantly breaking agreements with the Allies, and particularly with Britain\nand France, that one of these days they would have enough and just take care of him. At\nthat time, their military force was still much bigger than that of Germany and my father\nthought if I stay here, then I'll just pick up where I left off in '33 and all of that, you\nknow, if I think back, really made sense. In the framework, I mean putting myself into\nthe framework of my parents at that time and, of course, ignoring the history that\noccurred later which you know ts just hindsight. I mean, obviously, my parents also\nwere, and that may have been in general in those days, very sort of withdrawn in terms of\nsay financial things and so on. I mean, they never discussed any of these things with us\neven as I got older, but I am now certain, looking back that the income of my father from\nhis law practice, must have plummeted. Because, first of all, many of his clients were\ngentiles and there was, if a German gentile, so called Aryan, appeared in court with a\nJewish lawyer, that already was not one strike, but 10 strikes against him. And most of\nthe judges were fierce Nazis. So, who would want a Jewish lawyer? And so I'm sure that\nmost of the non-Jewish clients must have left him. Of course, he may have picked up\nsome Jewish clients because from those Jewish lawyers who were disbarred, I don't know\nhow that evened out, but I'm fairly certain that his income must have declined after '33.\nHe had actually a very well going practice, he had, I remember he used to talk about one\nof the most famous German movie actresses he represented in her divorce and then he\nhad some members of the Hohenzollern family, that was the family of the last German\nKaiser. In fact, the nephew of the Kaiser and his mother who was a sister-in-law of the\nKaiser, were his clients. And, in fact, they stuck with him until the end, that's very\ninteresting. But his, their cases did never involve court appearances, he drew up personal\nwills for them and made property arrangements and advice and things like that, where he\ndidn't really appear in public for them.",
        "Q: Let me ask you, Hitler came to power, can you kind of describe to me the progression\nof events and regulations and policy that altered your life and your lifestyle.",
        "A: In the beginning, I must say also one thing, is my parents, in retrospect, must have\nmade heroic efforts to insulate us children from all of these events. Initially, we didn't\nnotice anything, in fact, that is a little story that I didn't really plan to tell you, but I was,\nin January of '33, I was 10 years old then and I had scarlet fever, it's a childhood disease\nwhich doesn't exist anymore, but in those days kids had it. And our pediatrician who was\nalso a distant relative, it was still in the days of house calls, came every day and looked\nme over, looked into my throat and so on, and he came at a certain time, in the morning at\nsome point. And it was sort of a regular routine, the bell would ring, my mother would\ncome into my room with him and then he would examine me. On one day, and now I\nknow it was the 30th of January, 1933, instead of coming in, my mother and he were\noutside the door of my room, but with the door closed, and sort of in a low voice which I\ncouldn't understand, kept talking and talking and talking. And finally they came in and I\nwas very sort of disappointed, not only because of the change in routine, but somehow I\nwasn't that important and they talked and then I asked them what's the matter, and my\nmother said in a grave voice, Hitler has just been appointed Chancellor. And at that time,\nit sort of went 1n here, out there, it didn't mean anything. I knew I was 10 years old, so I,\nthe German, there had been several elections before so the house walls and public places\nwere plastered with election placards and so I remember having seen, vote for Hitler and\nvote for Tahlmann who was the Communist party leader, and vote for this man, and\nGermany also had many parties. And, so vaguely the name Hitler rang a bell, but I had\nno idea basically who he was, what he stood for and so on. Now, coming specifically to\nyour question, the first real change was that eviction from the Mommsen Gymnasium.\nBefore that, the laws, there were laws of course, as I said, about disbarring lawyers, didn't\naffect me and, unfortunately, it did not affect my father either. Then there were many\nother, there weren't too many laws, until '35, in '35 the so called Nuremberg laws were\npassed which actually defined Jews as second class citizens, but that also had no\nimmediate effect, the main effect was also that Jews not only could not marry gentiles, I\nmean, Aryan gentiles, but even the act of intercourse without being married was a\npunishable offense, but obviously, I was 12, 13 years old then, that was the last thing on\nmy mind. And second class citizenship had, of course, trickled through and had many\nother effects which at that point did not affect me. But, as I said, the eviction from the\nschool did and but also, our lifestyle never changed, I mean we went, my parents went on\ntheir summer vacations and my sister and I went to our camps and we had, I mean we\nwere clothed, we had food to eat and, in fact, oh yeah, one big change also was that the\nNazis were totally obsessed with the idea that the Jews were sort of spoiling the German\nrace and most Jewish families, at least middle and upper middle classes, had maids and in\nthose days maids were usually live-in maids, and one of the outgrowths of the Nuremberg\nlaws was that any Jewish household which has a male, a Jewish male in the household,\nwas forbidden to have a German maid who is below 45 years of age. So, we had, I think\nwe had one at that time so we had to dismiss her and took an older woman. You could\ntake an older one, I mean it was all that obsession with that maybe a Jew would then\nfather an illegitimate child with such a maid. I don't know, maybe there were such cases,\nbut they were, it was almost a sickness with the Nazis. Anyway, I then started at the\nJewish school and I remember there were several kids besides myself in my grade who\nstarted new there. Now, we were up to grade level in all the general subjects like math,\nGerman and so on, but in the Jewish subjects, and particularly in Hebrew, our classmates\nwere already freely translating the Torah, the Tenach, the entire bible, from English, from\nHebrew into German, and I could barely sort of read stammeringly and so did the others.\nSo they instituted a sort of second track Hebrew for us assimilated kids; and for the first\nclass the principal, a Dr. Schlesinger came in to give us a little pep talk about the\nimportance of knowing Hebrew for Jewish children. And after he was finished, he said,\nokay, tomorrow will be the first, now he dismissed us, tomorrow will be the first real\nclass and we are supposed to bring, he wrote on the board a certain grammar by so and so\nwhich you could buy at some book store that he named, and a copy of the Chumash. And\nas soon as he said that, my arm shot up and he pointed at me and I asked, what is a\nChumash. And that question completely floored that principal. He couldn't imagine a\nJewish boy asking, being so unbelievably ignorant that he wouldn't know what a\nChumash is. And so all he could, yeah and also, he was a short, very thin, wiry man with\na reddish goatee, bald head but a fringe of red hair around the back of his head and his\nentire head, as I remember it, turned red just as his beard, he walked toward me and\nfinally, I guess he took some time to think about what to say, and then he said, you are a\nJew and you don't know what a Chumash is? And, of course, that question totally\ndemolished me and I sat down and felt as if I had said something. . .\nEnd of side one of tape one.",
        "Q: This is an interview with Ernest Fontheim on March 12, 1997, tape one, side B.",
        "A: Yeah, my immediate reaction was that I was totally embarrassed by the principal's\nremark and, but soon, as a result of the very strong Jewish education which was part of\nthe curriculum in that school, I started to become more and more interested in that. The\nname of the school, actually that is very important, was Adass Jisroel, it means Jewish\nCongregation, a Jewish Community. And we came to the point even where I decided that\nI wanted to become a rabbi when I grew up, which very much upset my father,\nparticularly. I started to go regularly to Shabbat services in. * * * Berlin had many\nsynagogues and, as I said before, there was only one congregation which ran all of the\nsynagogues in Berlin and also the rabbis, therefore, were not confined to one synagogue,\nso one didn't have to put up with the same rabbi Shabbat after Shabbat the way it is here,\nfor example, in this country, where each congregation has its own rabbi, but instead, the\nrabbis circulated. But, obviously, Berlin is a big city and it was taken for granted that\nthey would take public transport to go to the various synagogues which were widely\nscattered in different parts of the city. So, I particularly became very fond of two rabbis\nwho were both very dynamic and also gave me a lot of moral support in their sermons.\nOne was Dr. Max Nussbaum who later emigrated to this country and became rabbi in\nHollywood, California. And the other one was Dr. Manfred Swarsenski who came to this\ncountry and actually founded a synagogue in Madison, Wisconsin. I never saw\nNussbaum again, but Swarsenski I visited in the mid-'60's when I went to a scientific\nconference in Madison. I knew he was there so I contacted him before and we set up a\nluncheon, we spent several hours together just talking and reminiscing. I, yeah, in that,\nso the years went by from '35 to '38 and by 1938, I must have been about in 10th grade\nand in October, 1938, the German police arrested all Jews who had Polish passports,\novernight, without any prior warning, in fact, they came in the early morning hours. And\nput them on, into railroad cars which were all ready prepared beforehand and they were\nshipped off to Poland and the only thing the German saw to it was that they had their\nPolish passports with them because by International law, the Poles had to admit anyone\nwho had a valid Polish passport. And there were quite a number of kids from my class\naffected by that and even a few teachers who didn't appear the next day.",
        "Q: What were you thinking when all this was happening?",
        "A: It was terrible, I mean, I still remember, I mean these kids, that was actually the first\nfore taste of the later deportations. I mean, people just vanished overnight, the day before\nnobody knew anything, they didn't know, we didn't know and on the next day, they just\ndidn't appear in school. Our Hebrew teacher was one of them and then several kids, one\nof them, but that's beside the point here, I met again 30 years later in Israel where he is,\nby now he must be retired, he was a professor of classical languages at Hebrew\nUniversity.",
        "Q: What's surprising me about what you're telling me, is that you, what I'm\nunderstanding here is that until 1938, your life went on pretty much the way it had before\nexcept for that you changed schools? You haven't described any real hardships or laws or\nregulations that affected you personally. Is that true?",
        "A: That's true. I mean, that was my, I mean first of all, it's 50, 60 years later, what I\nremember, but I think my memory is pretty good as far as that is concerned, that doesn't\nmean that these regulations didn't exist, but they didn't really touch me personally and, as\nI said, after I've read a lot of what happened in those days, and I see now that my parents\nmust have made a monumental effort to keep things away from us, that's the only\nexplanation I have. One thing that I noticed also maybe in my life, and that was that\nearlier, I think in either late '37 or early '38, all Jewish stores were required to put the\nnames of their owners in letters of a prescribed size on the store window in, and not in an\nartistic way, so in a way that identified the store as a Jewish store because no other store,\nin white paint of a prescribed size, but again, we didn't have a store, I just noticed it, that\nthis is what was happening. Another thing that happened also, was that all Jews were\nforced to adopt an additional middle name, males the name Israel and females the name\nSara. In this country there are many non-Jews, Jewish women, who are called Sarah, but\nin Germany, the name Sarah is totally unknown, it was purely a Jewish name and Israel,\nanyway, so, and also the law stipulated not only that we had to take those names, but that\nwe had to use it, particularly in all communications with government agencies or also\nwith commercial enterprises and so on. Like, I had to call myself Ernest Israel Fontheim,\nwritten out. And my father had to do the same thing. It was, of course, also a\nhumiliation and in addition to that, it was a sort of signal for the recipient, this is a Jew\nwho is writing to me.",
        "Q: Could you play in public parks, could you ride the busses?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You could do all this?",
        "A: Right, at that time there were no restrictions of any sort to our life, we could go to\nmovies, theaters, I could go to, now there were places which on their own initiative, had\nposted signs, Jews, \"Juden unerwinscht\", that means Jews are not desired here, actually\nto translate it literally, but what it means really, Jews forbidden. That was already, there\nwere, for example, many benches on parks, because again the Nazis with their obsession\nwith sex, had that idea that maybe a German woman might sit on a park bench and then\nsome Jewish man might sit next to her and start to, some dirty business with her and so a\nGerman woman cannot be expected to sit next to a Jew on a park bench. But whatever,\nthat started up and then, as I said, certain, maybe some restaurants, but we didn't go much\nto restaurants anyway, SO...",
        "Q: Did you know about the book, that huge book burning earlier?",
        "A: At that time, I don't remember it, I remember it, obviously having read about it, but\nthat happened I think in '33 or '34 and I was 10 or 11 years old and so...",
        "Q: So your family insulated you to the extent that you weren't particularly distressed or\nfearful?",
        "A: That's correct, yeah.",
        "Q: Could you sense any change in your parents or relatives or friends?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, I mean that I should mention. They were, there was a stream of people\nwho emigrated, you know, some uncle, some cousin, you know, and there was always\nfarewells and friends of mine, their parents emigrated and, of course, the kid then went\nalong. I should say I had a best friend in this Adass Jisroel school, he was a boy, a very\ninteresting boy, in fact, we became best friends initially because we both were new in that\nclass, but from totally different backgrounds. He came, his parents had moved from\nVienna to Berlin, they were Austrian Jews, but the parents were, of course, born before\nWorld War I like all of our parents and before World War I, the Austro-Hungarian\nEmpire included southern Poland and particularly, most of Galicia, the province, and his\nparents actually were orthodox Jews from Galicia who had, however, left there I think\nbefore the war already and settled in Vienna and so they were then, by citizenship, they\nwere Austrian Jews and they came to Berlin, it might sound strange since Austria at that\ntime was still a democracy, but his father had some business, I think he sort of\nadministered buildings and as an Austrian, he was not subject, he was a foreigner, foreign\nJews were not subject to all these antisemitic laws. So we, and in fact, this friend also\ninfluenced me in that, and I took him also to services to a liberal synagogue with the\norgan and he found that very impressive and so we influenced each other. And we stuck\ntogether, he was a very bright boy and on the 13th of March, 1938, that was the day\nHitler marched into Austria, I'll never forget that. I visited him, I saw his father sit in the\ndining room with his head in his hands like that and crying because he knew that his\ngame was up now, now he was also a German and subject to all the laws. And to see a\nfather cry is an incredibly powerful experience for and also a devastating experience for a\nboy. Totally devastating. And then the parents finally decided to send their boy out to\nEngland, you may know, England had relatively liberal immigration for Jewish children\nand they, they were of course orthodox, and they enrolled him in a Yeshiva in Scotland\nand ostensibly for him to become a rabbi which he never did, but that was the rules under\nwhich he could get out and into England. And that was actually the first personal blow in\nmy life. And also for that reason, I never forgot the date, 1t was January 18, 1938. And I\nwas at the railroad station together with his parents, of course, to say goodbye and he was\nmy best friend and I lost him. But, of course, the year 1938 then had many other, all of\nthose things happening, I mentioned the arrest and deportation of the Polish Jews and\nthen just a few weeks later, two or three weeks later, came the infamous Kristallnacht\nPogrom. Of course, the two events were not unrelated. Among the people who were\narbitrarily arrested and shipped to Poland was an elderly couple, Grynszpan, who, and the\nPoles, of course, claimed they didn't know what to do with all those Jews, so they put\nthem into camps 1n inhuman conditions and they had lived in Germany, I'm not sure\nwhether in Berlin or some other city, anyway, they had a son, Herschel, whom they had\nsent to Paris to relatives because it became, Berlin became too oppressive, and he lived\nwith an uncle in Paris. And when the parents wrote to him a letter of desperation and he\nbecame so furious he obtained a gun and decided to assassinate the German ambassador\nto Paris, but you know, if a 16 year old boy enters an embassy and says he wants to talk\nto the ambassador, that's not whom he's going to see, obviously, and so they ushered him\ninto some underling from, a consular secretary or something, his name was Ernst vom\nRath, and history probably would never know him if it hadn't been for Grynszpan to pull\nhis pistol and assassinate him there. And the German government, on the other hand,\nused that as a pretext to stage these pogroms and that was starting the night, from\nNovember 9th to 10th, for several days. I mean, synagogues were burned, Jewish shops\nand now, of course, you see, since the Jewish shops all had to be labeled with the names\nof the owner, it never said Jewish shop, but it was known that the stores which had the\nname of the owner in this particular prescribed way, these were the Jewish stores so it\nwas clear for the mob which windows to smash and loot.",
        "Q: What were you doing during the time of Kristallnacht, what did you see?",
        "A: Yeah, on that day in the morning, where we lived there were, at least on my way to\nthe station, I had to take a commuter train to the city, to that school, I didn't pass any\nshops, they were all just apartment houses, so I knew nothing. That was the morning of\nthe 10th, now, it was a Thursday. So I took the train and I went to school and as soon as I\nwas in the school, I realized what was on, first of all, many kids weren't there and those\nwho were there told horror stories of passing shops that had been smashed and looted.\nAnd then the next thing that was unusual is, as you know, the school day starts at eight\nsharp, the bell is ringing and then the normal thing would be that the teacher would\nappear at the crack of the bell, no teacher not just in our class, but in the neighboring, in\nno class any teacher was to be seen. And after some time, I don't remember it was a half\nan hour, whatever, all the teachers came from the teacher's conference room with the\nfollowing instructions, that there was unrest all over Berlin and the safety of the school\ncannot be guaranteed and furthermore, we should go home but we should go home alone,\nif we go in groups that might attract mobs and just a single boy, you know, can sort of\nslip under, unrecognized and also we should not go to friends because our parents might\nget worried, we should only go the shortest way and fastest way home so the parents\nknow we are safe, and there won't be any school for the time being, we will be notified\nwhen the school will start up again.",
        "Q: So you went home?",
        "A: Yes. The commuter train was an elevated train and it passed by the synagogue where\nI had my bar mitzvah and what I saw there was really one of the worst horror shocks in\nmy life. It was a beautiful building with huge, three huge domes, sort of in Moorish style\nand from the center dome came a huge thick column of smoke. When I saw that I\nbecame so obsessed that I forgot the warning that was given to us to go straight home. At\nthe next train stop I left the train and I raced back to the building, to the synagogue and\nwhat I saw there is there was a mob of people across the street, held back by a police line\nand the fire department was there hosing down adjacent buildings so to prevent the\nflames from doing damage to German property and no hose was directed at the\nsynagogue and that, I just stood there, I was totally sort of hypnotized. That was\nsomething; I couldn't even imagine that something like that could happen. And then,\nthere were many antisemitic sort of shouts from the mob, I mean like, I don't know, throw\nout the Jews or kill the Jews and it never occurred to me that I was one in the middle of\nthat mob. And then suddenly somebody said that in the house where, against which the\nmob was sort of standing looking at the synagogue, on the ground floor somebody knew\nthere was a Jew living. So there were immediate shouts, let's get them. And then the\nmob turned its back to the synagogue and burst into the house itself and then I heard sort\nof heavy blows against the apartment door and I was way outside, I couldn't see what was\nhappening there. And all I could think was, I hope that the door is going to hold and I\nremember that was sort of as if I was trying to influence the door to hold, but of course, it\ndidn't and I could hear sort of splintering wood and then after that there was total silence,\nit lasted for minutes, not a sound. And then I heard again shouts like, get them, get them,\nand then there was an elderly man, all I remember seeing, he had a huge bald head, he\nwas probably sixty, or I don't know how old he was, and then from all sides there were\nblows and his face soon was completely bloodied. And suddenly there was a young man\nwho shouted, you cowards, so many all fighting against one single guy. And then some\nothers tried to attack that man and sort of pushed him away. And then once he was\npushed through the crowd, there was police already waiting in a car as if this was all\nstaged, I have no idea and he was pushed off into the car and the police drove him off.\nAnd after I saw that, I turned around and went back to the train and went home. So the\nyear 1938 was really for me, it was a big turning point. It started out with the emigration\nof my best friend which was a tremendous personal loss for me, then the arrest of the\nPolish Jews, who I also knew quite a number including some of my teachers and then the\nKristallnacht. So I stayed home as we were told on Friday. And on Saturday one of my\nfriends had a birthday party that already was long planned and so I went to it, and we had\nhardly come there when somebody, I think one of the boys came in saying that his father\nhad just been arrested by the Gestapo and that the Gestapo is arresting the Jewish men.\nSo the party never took place, we all immediately raced, in those days, Saturday was a\nweekday, so my father was in his office and actually it was not too far, it was several\nblocks from where the birthday party was supposed to take place. So I raced to his office\nand just when I came in, he said he had just received an urgent telephone call from a\ncolleague, a German, an Aryan colleague to see him immediately on an important matter\nand he asked me to come along. I was at that time 16 years old and so we went, that\ncolleague was two blocks from my father's office and was a certain Dr. Kiilz. He was a\nfew years somewhat younger than my father and his father, Dr. Kiilz's father, had also\nhimself been a lawyer, but more importantly, he had been Minister of the Interior in one\nof the pre-Hitler governments of the Weimar Republic and in Germany, like I think in\nmany European countries, the police is within the Interior Ministry sort of an agency, I\nmean like somewhat comparable to the FBI here, which is in the Justice Department. But\nthere the police, the entire police organization, is national, it's not local like 1n this\ncountry. And anyway, the father still had close contacts to high police officials and had\nlearned, therefore, of this action against, for the arrest of Jewish men and in those days,\nalso, everybody was paranoiac, partly with justification, that the Gestapo was listening on\ntelephone calls, so therefore, the son who my father actually knew the son better than the\nfather, who had, I think, done legal cases together with him, and the son did not say\nanything over the phone, just told my father to see him in his office on an important\nmatter. And my father then was ushered in and asked me to stay outside in the waiting\nroom and they were quite a time together there and then they came out again and my\nfather told me that that lawyer had warned him not to go back to his office or, of course,\nnot to his own apartment and to, it is safe, however, to stay at places where there are no\nJewish males. Fortunately, my father's sister, who was a widow and she had three\nchildren, two daughters and a son. One daughter had already emigrated to Argentina, and\nthe son had just left a few months or so before Kristallnacht also for Argentina. So it was\njust his sister and the remaining daughter. So in other words, there were no males in that\nhousehold. So my father immediately went there, and the Gestapo came both to our\napartment and also to the office to inquire and, of course, we told them he left and didn't\ntell us where he was going, and in those days the Gestapo still took these relatively stupid\nexcuses and just reappeared a few random times maybe hoping to catch him, but didn't,\nand that was the second great stroke of luck that my father had after having been\npermitted to practice law. The thing was that the Gestapo immediately let 1t be known\nthat those Jews who were arrested were put into concentration camps, with the Berlin\nJews mainly in the camp Sachsenhausen which is north of Berlin. And the treatment, of\ncourse, was horrible, full of sadism and physical brutality. However, in those days at\nleast there was no killing, no mass killings, I think a few Jews actually did die due to just\nmistreatment, but I mean which 1s horrible enough in its own right, but at least most\nsurvived and the Gestapo let it be known that anyone whose family can produce an\nemigration visa to another country will be immediately released and will have to leave\nthe country within one month, giving him one month's time to wind up affairs and so on.\nSo, but as I said, my father was lucky, he was warned, he was never arrested and, of\ncourse, the Jewish relief organizations from the Joint here in America to the local ones in\nGermany, now put high pressure on and the first priority to get those Jews immigration\nvisas to somewhere, anywhere in the world, just to get them out, I mean those who were\nin concentration camps, to save their lives, to get them out.",
        "Q: Was there a strong Nazi presence in the streets, I mean were there marches, were\nthere Gestapo?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, I mean that is, no Gestapo, by its very nature is a secret police, they\nwere in civilian and they were, I mean not conspicuous, even though they themselves\nwere everywhere and they had a whole army of informers who were not actually Gestapo\nbut reported to them. And that was a network, throughout Germany, maybe I neglected\nto say that, that belongs much earlier. As soon as Hitler assumed power, there were\nfrequent marches by the SA on, they had a fascination with marches, as I said, this\nMommsen Gymnasium, after that Nazi officer took over, one of the things he introduced,\nas I explained, was during the lunch hour, after eating lunch, we always marched around\nthe street singing songs. But the SA, at every, whatever occasion or even no occasion,\nthey would march around and one of their favorite songs, incidentally, was\n\"Und wenn das Judenblut vom Messer spritzt, dann geht's nochmal so gut.\"\nwhich translated means, if Jewish blood squirts from the knives then things will go quite\nas well. I mean, to sing a song like that, I mean I listened to it even at that time, but the\nolder I get, the more incredible it seems to me that somebody, I mean even who hates\nsome group, to make that into a song is so unbelievable that it defies description.\nAnother song which was a favorite was, I'll say it in German first,\n\"Wir werden weiter marschieren,\nauch wenn alles in Scherben fallt,\ndenn heute gehort uns Deutschland\nund morgen die ganze Welt.\"\nthat means, we will continue to march and even if everything breaks down and falls into\npieces, because today Germany belongs to us and tomorrow the entire world. And so,\nand they had all kinds of other songs, obviously, I mean these are the things that I never\nforgot.",
        "Q: So even if you were insulated, this had to be fairly alarming.",
        "A: Yeah, I mean I found it, I mean there were other things that were alarming also.\nThere was a weekly newspaper called Der Stiirmer, the storm trooper, maybe you've\nheard of it. It was published by the Nazi governor of the province of Franconia, a man\nnamed Julius Streicher, and which was full of antisemitic articles and also totally fixated\non the sexual aspect of antisemitism. The paper, I mean apparently calling to that Jews\nhad infinite sexual appetites and particularly for little innocent blond German girls to\nseduce them, that was somehow a Jewish command to do that, I mean it was just\nincredible, I mean the man must have been sick himself, or whoever wrote these stories.\nAnd, of course, sometimes they were true. They would intermix it with some true stories,\nwhere sometimes a Jew was convicted of some crime. Usually the crimes Jews were\nconvicted of were such things as smuggling money out. In Germany foreign exchange\nwas strictly controlled, because the whole economy was managed and controlled, but you\nknow Jews, rather than letting the Nazis take it all away from them, sometimes tried to\nsmuggle some money out and in some cases they succeeded and in other cases they were\ncaught, and that was always touted as a big crime against the German nation. And of\ncourse, the story always was that the Jew, they came with nothing and now they are rich,\nso that is all just taken away from the Germans. And stories like that, and then of course,\nthere were also true stories of where a Jew somehow was caught having had a\nrelationship with a non-Jewish girl and if that happened, then the Jew usually came to a\nconcentration camp and those Jews who were there for, there was actually a term, a\nGerman term for that, which translated means sort of defilement of the race. And they\nwere mercilessly tortured and punished and usually, if they weren't shot outright, just\ndied of torture. So that newspaper was not just sold at newsstands, but they had sort of\ndisplay cases on various strategic points, like in busy railroad stations and so on. And\nusually I ignored it, but sometimes I sort of went there and read it and somehow I did not\nrelate it to me, it's a funny thing.\nEnd of tape one\nTape 2",
        "Q: This is an interview with Ernest Fontheim on March 12, 1997. The interviewer is\nRandy Goldman, this is tape two, side A.",
        "A: What I, what affected me actually more than these vicious articles in the Sturmer,\nwere antisemitic articles in the general press and I also felt at that time and still feel\ntoday, that they probably were much more effective in influencing people than the\nSttirmer articles because the articles in the Sttirmer, most of them at least, were so\noutlandish that, and also they were always accompanied by horrible caricatures where a\nJew looked like a, maybe a mixture of a gorilla and a human being and totally distorted,\nthat I am sure many people just couldn't take it seriously, on the other hand, that\nantisemitic articles in the general press, which were more sort of subdued and not as\noutwardly ridiculous, and therefore, also probably appeared more reasonable, probably\ninfluenced many more people toward increased antisemitism. And they were, for\nexample, I have to admit that to some extent, even I was influenced by the constant\nrefrain of the German press was that the Jews were in charge of all the countries that\nwere fighting against Germany, particularly of course, the United States, and there was a\nwhole succession of names that always appeared, one was that, of course, of Felix\nFrankfurter, the supreme court justice, another one was Herbert Lehman, the governor of\nthe state of New York, I remember, and there were one or two others. Oh, yeah, of\ncourse, Bernard Baruch, the financier and they made it appear as if they are, these people\nwere sort of behind the scenes manipulating and, of course, Roosevelt himself, whose\nname was often distorted as Rosenfeld, implying that if he wasn't a Jew at least he was of\nJewish descent. And after the war, particularly after meeting American soldiers, and\nmany of them Jewish, I was surprised actually to hear that there was large scale\nantisemitism in this country and that the influence of these Jews was a relatively minimal.\nOh, I forgot one name, of course, that was Henry Morgenthau, the Secretary of the\nTreasury at that time. He was probably, I would say, from what I can judge reading\nhistory, the most influential, in the government at least, of the United States and I think\nhe was fairly close to President Roosevelt. But it was nothing like that and as the Nazis,\nand I was, I have to admit now, disappointed because somehow that part of the Nazi\npropaganda I had started to believe somewhat. And then, by the way, the same thing in\nthe Soviet Union, you know, there were lots of Jewish names, many of these were\nactually exterminated by Stalin himself, and particularly, many of the original\nrevolutionaries, and starting with Trotsky, of course. And there too, actually, the fact that\nthere was wide spread antisemitism in the Soviet Union, never made it into the German\npapers, 1t wouldn't have fit their purposes. Okay, now, the Kristallnacht was not only a,\njust devastating horrible event in my personal life as well as the lives of all Jews in\nGermany, but it represented a watershed because that was followed by a avalanche of\nnew laws and regulations totally restricting Jews. What affected us first of all was that\nthe remaining Jewish lawyers were now disbarred. So suddenly my father was not only\nliving in an antisemitic hotbed like Germany, but on top of it, he was unemployed here\nand my parents made, then from then on really, desperate efforts to get out of the country.\nAnd, but it was, by that time everybody had woken up and I remember once standing in\nfront of the British Consulate in Berlin which was in the embassy compound, arriving\nthere at six in the morning, just to get some form to fill out and I think by eleven or\ntwelve or so, finally it was my turn to receive those forms. I don't know what ever\nhappened, but I don't think, but obviously they didn't go to England and neither did I, so I\nstood there for nothing. And then, also, that was followed by laws making it illegal for a\nJew to visit any place of amusement or entertainment or general culture, that included the\nwhole spectrum, I mean from theater, symphony, opera to circuses, county fairs kind of\nthing, you name it. Also, public beaches, swimming, public swimming pools, movie\ntheaters, public parks even. Parks were much more popular in Germany than they are\nhere because most people in this country, or at least a high proportion, live in their own\nhomes and have their own gardens, in Germany the vast majority, at least at that time,\nlived in apartments and so parks were visited by people just regularly, just for recreation,\njust like people here might just sit in their back yard. Anyway, they were now outlawed\nfor Jews. I, from the beginning, I and all of my friends, totally ignored the, that law and\nwe just kept going. I remember one rather humorous incident, in the summer of 1940,\nthe Rome State Opera from Rome, Italy, gave a one week guest appearance at the Berlin\nState Opera and I had been an opera fan and on the day when the ticket sales started for\nthe Rome Opera, obviously everybody knew you had to be there early, so I was there, I\nthink, at five in the morning or so, and there was already a long line, and while you stand\nin line, of course, for hours, sort of trotting from left leg to right leg and vice versa, you\nstart also with people around you to get acquainted and talk and so on and the advantage\nof that was that you could then ask somebody to hold your place while you, it's just easier\nto take a little walk than to stand at the same spot, so I did that also. And while I then\ntook my walk, I walked along the line and I saw three other boys from my Jewish high\nschool classroom and it was sort of an unwritten law, you know, one Jew might get away,\ntwo Jews is already like a synagogue, so we just waved at each other with a grin, without\nreally getting together. And most people I knew did that, but there was a danger. I\nmean, if the Gestapo caught somebody, I mean the least thing was a concentration camp,\nbut as a young person, first of all, I was always sort of defying authority and plus, a\nyoung person is always more reckless than an older one. Yeah, let me, actually, in my\npersonal life, what happened then, finally the schools were permitted to operate again\nand, but then, shortly, that was probably late '38, that date I don't quite remember any\nmore precisely, but then in early '39, most Jewish schools were closed by the Gestapo,\nincluding the Adass Jisroel school, to which I was going. And there was only one Jewish\nhigh school left operating and that was the official high school of the Jewish community\nof Berlin, but by that time, my parents were really in high gear trying to emigrate and\nthey had the idea that it would be good for me to go to the American School in Berlin.\nThe American School in Berlin, also it was very close to where we lived, it was run by an\nAmerican principal and it mainly served children of diplomats, I mean not just\nAmericans, obviously, but also British and others who would know English, and also\nchildren of businessmen who were stationed in Berlin. And therefore, the tuition was, of\ncourse, very high and I remember that was the first time sort of I heard about that this\nwas a sort of a big sacrifice for my parents to put me in that school, and actually, I was\nscared because I would be thrown suddenly into a totally English environment, I mean,\nthe teachers were all Americans, some maybe British, actually, and English was the\nlanguage. Most kids had English as their native tongue and I had had three years of\nEnglish at the Adass school. But fortunately, things turned out to be not quite as bad. It\nturned out the school followed the curriculum of sort of the basic American school\nsystem and the German gymnasium was really a much more rigorous and elitist school\nand was at least a year if not more ahead of it, so many of the things, for example, in\nLatin and biology, I remember, we had had already much earlier, so the material itself\nwas often, just for me, a review of things I had learned earlier and, therefore, that made it\neasier for me to concentrate on the language. I think I made quite a bit of progress there,\nI don't know exactly how long I was, I wasn't there very long, probably from about\nFebruary, March '39, until the start of the summer term, which was, I think, May or June\n'39. In '39 also, was a lot, the first summer in my life where my parents didn't send me to\na summer camp. And on the first of September, 1939, of course the German Wehrmacht\nentered Poland, attacked Poland, and I still, I listened to Hitler's speech to the Reichstag\nin which he explained his rationale and I never forget the words which he said, \"since\nfive o'clock this morning, we are shooting back\", I mean the fairy tale that the Nazis told\nthe world was that Poland had attacked Germany and that had been going on already for\ndays and weeks, and while he patiently sort of tried to look the other way and tried to\ncome to a peaceful solution and finally he is not taking it anymore and they are shooting\nback. I mean, it's unbelievable. Okay, anyway, that was a Friday, September 1, and I\nshould say actually two days before, on August 30, that was my father's birthday, 1939,\nmust have been his 57th birthday, and at that time already everything was much more\nsubdued and we didn't have a party at home. We just went out to some nice restaurant\ndowntown. And while we were sitting there, suddenly a newsboy came in with stacks of\nnews, extra editions, shouting extra, extra, you know, and every table bought a paper and\nthe big fat headline was, general mobilization in Poland. And so, everybody knew\nalready, see and in Germany, general mobilization was never officially announced\nbecause the Nazis had already quietly mobilized and then on the first, as I said, Germany\nattacked Poland, it was a Friday. On Sunday the 3rd, we took our customary Sunday\nexcursion, we walked through the forest near where we lived to one of the cafes at the\nriverbank of the Havel River and at that time also, most if not all of the restaurants in\nGermany were sort of wired for public address systems. And while we were sitting there,\nit was early afternoon I think, the public address system went on with an important\nannouncement from the German government, and it said that the British Ambassador had,\nat 11:00, I still remember the time, submitted a diplomatic note saying that, requesting\nthat German troops be taken back to the original German-Polish border within a certain\nnumber of hours. If Germany refused to do that, then Britain in line with its treaty\nobligations to Poland, will consider itself at war with Germany. And the French\nAmbassador had submitted a similar note also. As we were sitting there, I remember that\nmy father broke out into tears and that was the first time that I saw him cry. And he said,\nthis is the Second World War in his lifetime and that he was not going to survive it.\nWhat prompted that remark, I never, it was the Holocaust was still so far away as to be\nunbelievable, but obviously, he must have sensed something. And then we went home.\nAnd then the outbreak of the war was followed then by many more restrictions. One was\nwe had to turn in our telephones, we had to turn in all appliances, of course in those days,\npeople had much fewer than today, but still I mean that included such things as vacuum\ncleaners, phonograph players, I don't know what else one had in those days, it was before\nwashing machines and dishwashers, but whatever one had, it had to be turned in. And in\naddition to. . .",
        "Q: Radios?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, radio, yeah, I think radios, too, yeah, right. And then some, up to that time\nI think Jews religiously obeyed all these things, and that was the first time where people\nstarted to sort of balk and not everything was turned in. I knew of many cases where\npeople didn't turn in everything. Also, jewelry, valuables, you know, gold, silver,\ndiamonds, things like that, had to be all turned in. And it was just turned in for a receipt,\nin other words, there was not thought of even to, for the government to buy it, it was just\nstolen. And of course, one victim of the outbreak of the war was the American School in\nBerlin which did not reopen because even though America itself at that time was not yet\nin the war, but Germany was in the war and Germany was considered a war zone, there\nwas the possibility of air raids and so on, so anyway, the school didn't reopen. And then\nat that point, I wanted to go back and do my high school graduation so I went back to the\nhigh school of the Jewish community and graduated there in March, 1940. There's a big\ndifference between a high school graduation in Germany, or I think in any European\ncountry, and also England, and that in America. In America, it is simply sort of an\nautomatic thing, after completing 12 years, 12th grade of school you graduate. They had\na rigorous examination, I still remember it was a fearful thing and I studied day and night\nand, I mean, passed it of course, but it was, it ranks in my memory together with my\nPh.D. prelims, I mean each one at their own level. Also, it's a state administered exam,\nso they, from the state education authority, a sort of high official appeared there. Yeah,\nand the way the graduation sort of examination goes, was the following. There was first\na set of written examinations, each three hours long, one was a German composition,\nwhich incidentally, we had several essay topics to choose from. And the topic I chose\nwas the discussion and evaluation of the work of a leading personality of modern times,\nand I chose Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism. And later on my father\nchided me for it and said, since that will be read by a German examination commission\nthat was a mistake that I did that, it might harm me and I said, well, the people know who\nI am, I am a Jew and they know that, that's a Jewish school, so anyway, my father was\nalways very concerned with such things. And actually, I got a very good grade for that.\nAnd mathematics and so on and that takes place over a period of about a month, these\nvarious exams, spaced. And then after that, about I think, after the last exam, maybe two\nor three weeks, comes the oral. And the German examiners, I mean, they get all the\nwritten tests and then one of them appears for the final oral examination. And the oral\nexamination was handled in such a way that the examination commission which\nconsisted of all the teachers that we had in 12th grade, the school principal and the\nGerman official were sitting in the examination room and we were called in one by one,\nwe were 14, 13 or 14, I forgot, I think 13, we were called in. And before that started, we\nwere all called in together and the German official made a little speech and he was a tall\ngood-looking guy, with a white thick mane of hair, and such a huge swastika party\nmember button here. And, which didn't particular make us, or at least me, feel easy. And\nhe, I don't know, he said a few things, but then he went on to say that he has read so far\nour written examinations and he wanted to make us a compliment, he said they are far\nabove the average of what he has seen and he wanted to particularly compliment us\nbecause he is aware of the difficult circumstances under which we are living. And then\nhe dismissed us and that man was obviously, you know, he must have been a holdover\nfrom the Weimar Republic, he was old enough anyway for that, and many of these guys\nwere pressured into joining the party or losing their job, and so they all, not all I guess,\nbut many, compromised and joined the party, but that man obviously, to have said that,\ntook already courage. So, anyway, that was the examination and then after that, I was,\nanyway very Zionist inclined, so I volunteered for one of the preparatory camps for\nemigration to Israel, or Palestine in those days. And there was, they were named by the\nHebrew name Hachsharah means preparation. And, but I discovered that I was totally\nunsuited for communal living, I felt totally unhappy. I mean, the living there was sort of\nto simulate kibbutz style living, you know, and I was constantly homesick and didn't like\nit at all. And then for me, fortunately actually, that camp was dissolved for some reason\nand people were distributed partly to other camps and partly to a work camp in a suburb\nof Berlin and that's where I was put and that was in a southern suburb of Berlin and we\nwere just a small group of boys, there wasn't more than 10, detailed to work in a forest\nwhich was managed by a forestry official to cut down certain trees that were diseased.\nAnd I still remember that must have been the healthiest time of my life. It was by that\ntime, midsummer of 1940, and we were working all bare-chested, just some shorts on and\nsawing down, that was in the days before chain saws and all that, I mean it was really\nhand sawing, these long band saws where one man grabs the handle at one end and the\nother on the other and you go back and forth. And then after the tree has been felled,\nthen with an ax all the branches had to be cut, apparently they were diseased, but still\ncould be used for some purpose, because we had to hack off with axes all of the branches\nand then with a special peeler, peel the bark off so that just the bare trunk remained. And\nthe local forester was sort of a fairly decent guy, I mean he got us as Jews, oh yeah, I\nshould have said that with the outbreak of World War I, of course, immediately food\nwas rationed. And not only food, also clothing, everything, shoes, everything you can\nthink of, all consumer goods were rationed. And Jews from the beginning, got less than\nthe, the ration system was a three tiered system, the lowest was called the general\nconsumer and then a higher, the next step up was workers cards, these are for like factory\nworkers, they got certain items more like I think fat, milk, maybe meat, I don't know.\nAnd then the highest category was heavy labor, these were people like construction,\nminers, you know, in the coal mines, this sort of thing. But, first of all, Jews were not\nentitled to any worker's cards even if they did do some work where Germans would have\nreceived them. And then our rations were actually shortened even compared to the\ngeneral consumer. But the forester there, since he wanted also to get work out of us and\nhe knew you know hungry people are not as strong, so he got actually through the local\nNazi \"Bauern\" or farmer leader, peasant leader, whatever, extra rations for us of farmers\nbread and sausages which were actually delicious. And we were sort of a really nice little\ncommunity there and I spent the summer there and occasionally we had furloughs where\nI could go into the city to visit my parents and so that was over, I think, in the fall of\n1940. And then my parents still hoping that maybe something will come of the\nemigration attempts, my parents did all kinds of things that I never really was aware of\nfully. And there was, in Berlin, a mechanics school from ORT, O-R-T, you know that\nexists still today in many countries, and they had a school sort of for mechanics and\nmachine working and so I started there sometime in the fall of 1940, and by that time,\nhowever, already the Germans started to draft Jews into factories, namely to replace\nGerman workers who had been drafted into the Army, to the Wermacht. But, my parents\nwere lucky, they somehow they were able to produce doctor's certificates so to exempt\nthem from the \"Arbeitseinsatz\", that means forced labor, basically. And I was exempted\nbecause I worked in that mechanics school.",
        "Q: I just want to ask you a couple of questions here. What was your sister doing\nthroughout all of this, was she just at home with your parents?",
        "A: No, yeah, actually, it must have been telepathy, I just thought of my sister. She went,\nfirst of all, when she went to school, initially she started in the German public school, but\nwas then transferred by my parents to a Jewish school, but a much less religious Jewish\nprivate school and when all of these schools were dissolved in early '39, just like the\nschool I was in, she was transferred to another school, a Jewish school of the Jewish\ncommunity. And then there she was until, but that came later, I think in '41, all schooling\nfor Jewish children was simply outlawed by the Gestapo. But until then, she went to\nschool and had her friends, in fact, she had already a little boy friend.",
        "Q: Your sister was a little bit younger, so at that point when schools were outlawed, were\nthere underground schools or people just stopped going?",
        "A: When schooling was forbidden, no I think first of all, she was sent also to the country\nfor, there was, some young Jewish kids were sent to help in harvesting, you know, things\nin the country. And then when she came back from there, the deportations were already\ngoing strong.",
        "Q: And your parents, were they supportive of your going to these little Zionist camps?",
        "A: Yeah. They were supportive, but that time they wanted to get me out, in fact, we\nalready applied for a passport and, in fact, that is one also incident I remember where we\nwent, the passport office was actually part of the Jewish emigration office, which was\nheaded by Adolf Eichmann, and we applied there for a passport for me and for someone\nhere to come along, probably because I was a minor or something. And while we were\nstanding in line, I mean you went sort of from one position to the next filling out forms\nand answering questions or whatever, while we were standing in line two very tall and\nvery good looking SS officers sort of walked across the waiting room where people are\nstanding in line, and for some reason, one of them just got pulled to my father for some\nreason, and walked towards him and asked him why we were waiting there and my father\nanswered that this is my son and he is preparing to emigrate to Palestine and then he said,\noh, and then he answered, he asked my father, is he going with the Hechalutz? And sort\nof in perfect Hebrew, and my father said, yes and then he just turned around and walked\naway. And I don't, my father didn't seem nervous and so on, but I'm sure he must have\nbeen extremely, you know, that guy was, he looked very aggressive and I mean like the\nimage of an SS officer. Anyway, so in fact, that passport I still have, part of my\ncherished memories, with a big J which after the war I found out, we actually owe the\nSwiss more than the Germans. Did you ever read about that? That the Swiss pressured\nthe Germans to put the J because Germany and Switzerland had a treaty for tourist visas,\nnot to need visas for tourism, but that apparently Jews discovered and went there as\ntourists with their German passports, but then didn't leave. And the Swiss didn't like that\nand so they told the Germans to do something, put a J in or whatever so that they can\nimmediately recognize the passport of a Jew and then they can refuse them. These nice,\nneutral Swiss. Yeah, anyway, coming back, where was I? Oh, yeah, I went to ORT to\nlearn mechanics. And actually that turned out to be one of the more useful things I\nlearned in my life, probably more useful than Latin or, I don't know, but anyway, I\nlearned how to operate a lathe, although that I have never done later, and operate various\ntools. And, as I said, at that time also they started to draft Jews, and on April 30, 1941,\nalso, oh no, I'm sorry, I have to back up there. I want to say that in February of 1941, we\nreceived a notice that we have to vacate the huge apartment that we still occupied on the\nKaiserdamm. That was one of the major boulevards of Berlin, within a few days. That\nwas an action that was actually originated by Albert Speer who was a German armaments\nminister and also in charge of construction in Berlin and he always tried after the war to\nsort of pretend that he was just a professional and did his thing for the armaments, but\nhad nothing to do whatsoever with persecution of Jews or other minorities. Which is a\nbig lie, I mean that was one of the things which he did, to kick Jews out of their\napartments and Jews who were kicked out in this way, had to move in then, were\nrestricted to move into so called Jew houses. These were apartment buildings where at\nleast 50% of the tenants were already Jews and then also, you couldn't by any means, of\ncourse, displace a German family in such a house. But you had to move into sort of a\nsublet, into an apartment already inhabited by another Jewish family. And that was a big\nblow, that was a huge, we had a huge apartment, of course, I never had mentioned that so\nfar. But it was an eight room apartment and there were many art pieces in there that my\nparents had collected, of course, in better times, many oriental rugs and I did mention the\nbig library that my father had. And so, I mean just to, and of course, if I think today for\nexample, if we had to move out of our house, which I think in square footage may be\nsmaller than that apartment, that would be a nightmare within a few days. You know,\nyou accumulate so many things, personal things, documents, whatever, pictures, and but\nin addition to that, a new apartment had to be found, a new room or rooms in another\napartment. Anyway, to make a long story short, we thought we had an ideal solution,\nmoving into the apartment of an uncle of my mother. Now, he was, the man was the\nbrother of my maternal grandfather and his wife and it was a much smaller apartment,\nand they were living there and they had a son in the mid or late 30's and then two single\nwomen were already living there also who had been kicked out somewhere else.\nEnd of side one of tape two.",
        "Q: This is an interview with Ernest Fontheim, March 12, 1997, tape two, side B.",
        "A: Of course, we were not the only family living under such circumstances, it was\nthroughout the Jewish community that Jews were cramped together. That, I guess, was\nthe equivalent of a ghetto, in Berlin it would have been impossible for the Nazis to sort of\ninstitute a real ghetto in an area where only Jews lived because Jews never were\nconcentrated in one area to such an extent, so they would have had basically to clear\nsome area of non-Jewish Germans and anyway that would have been too disruptive. So,\ninstead, they crammed then the remaining Jews at that time simply into a much smaller\nnumber of apartment buildings. That immediately led to innumerable conflicts. First of\nall, I think I indicated before, that food was rationed and so it was very important for each\nfamily to keep its food supply identified and separate and there were frequent suspicions\nand some even, sometimes even accusations that somebody else ate somebody else's\nsausage or at least part of it or that something was missing that should have not been\nmissing. And, in fact, the kitchen became known throughout the community as the\nbattlefield of the apartment. Because it wasn't just the problem of keeping the food\nsupplies separate, then there was a problem even of preparing dinner for example.\nUsually people eat more or less at the same time and they don't eat dinner at four when\nnobody needed the kitchen. And so there was a source of friction in that respect. And of\ncourse, with clean up and this was particularly, these things all might seem to be petty,\nbut at that time, the nerves of all or most Jews at least, were so frayed already by years of\noppression and innumerable Nazi anti-Jewish measures, that it never took much for\npeople to fly into a rage and to, that was really actually a very tragic outcome of that, but\nthat's what happened in many families, it happened in ours. The fact that we lived with\nrelatives had absolutely nothing to do with it and I think my mother and her aunt became\nfierce enemies while we lived there. I would like just to back up briefly to a somewhat\nearlier time when we were still in the apartment, in the big apartment on the Kaiserdamm\nBoulevard. When I mentioned that after the outbreak of the war, the telephones were\ntaken away from Jews, a few days after that measure was instituted, our doorbell rang\nand when we opened the door, the man who lived in the apartment upstairs above us was\nat the door, he was a wealthy bachelor, middle aged, I have no idea, but the way I\nremember him, he was probably then around 50, and he asked to talk to my father in\nprivate under four eyes. So my father and he went into my father's study, and they spent\nsome time there, and we were all puzzled because there had never been really any social\nor any other contact with him. And then after, I don't know, some minutes he\nre-emerged, and they were both, both gentlemen were chatting sort of pleasantly, and our\nupstairs neighbor said goodbye and left. And my father then turned to us with total\nsurprise on his face, saying that Mr. Kopf, that was his name, just offered that we could\nuse his telephone, he just heard that our phone was taken away and he felt that was\nterrible, and if we had the need to call somebody, we should feel free and not only that,\nbut he even gave us permission to pass his number on to a few, but absolutely reliable,\npeople who may have a need to call us, in that case he would send his maid down and\nsomeone could come up and answer the call. And that was, in those days and under those\ncircumstances, was extraordinary because the man surely risked, particularly in the\nsecond part of the offer. So there were sometimes such cases also. Another thing that I\nwanted to mention is that in the same building, on the first floor, the Ambassador of a\nsmall Central American country was living. I'm not 100% certain any more, but I'm\nfairly sure that it was Costa Rica, I can't swear it, anyway, my parents when the situation\nbecame worse and worse, particularly after Kristallnacht, my parents decided maybe an\napproach to that man might be helpful in opening some doors, and although we barely\nknew him except you know when we crossed paths on the stairs or so on, my father made\nan appointment and went to see him and all I know is that nothing ever came of it. Okay,\nback now to February, 1941, after our eviction from the big apartment and our move into\nthat much smaller apartment. That, yeah, that was in February of 1941. Two months\nlater, in April, precisely on April 30, 1941, the apprentice workshop of ORT, where I was\napprenticing for sort of mechanic and machine shop work, was ordered closed by the\nGestapo, and all students in there were supposed to report to the labor office. The Nazis,\nincidentally, had instituted a special labor office for Jews shortly after the outbreak of the\nwar, whose task it was to deal with Jews exclusively and to give them, give Jews jobs\nmainly in the defense industry or also in other sort of generally considered unpleasant\nwork, like for example, the city garbage department, garbage pickup and similar things,\nand also they ride the railroads, certain unpleasant jobs in connection with the railroads\non tracks and so on. Many Jews had already been drafted to work, my parents succeeded\nin getting exemptions by doctors, by getting certificates from doctors, I mean neither one\nof them really was very healthy by that time any more. And, now for our advantage was,\nI mean our, meaning the students, the apprentices at the ORT school, that we were\nconsidered to be sort of already trained mechanics and, therefore, could get some better\njobs and all of us wound up at one of the Siemens factories. Now before the war, the\ncentral Siemens factory was in Berlin, although they did have factories 1n other parts of\nGermany, but in Berlin was the central factory, and also the central administration\nbuilding of Siemens was in Berlin, and it was a huge complex, it took, it was many\nsquare miles large, fenced in of course, many, many buildings manufacturing all kinds of\nthings. In general, Siemens is an electrical equipment manufacturer along the same lines\nas General Electric maybe, at least used to be, before they started building such things as\njet engines. Of course, they were entirely into war production at that time and one day\nafter our, after the ORT school was dismissed, we already, we had to report to this labor\noffice and there we were given, you know, pieces of paper telling us where to report the\nnext day and at what time and so on and so that's how I wound up at Siemens.",
        "Q: Did you have any choice in this?",
        "A: None whatsoever. In fact, the labor office also was run strictly along Nazi lines, I\nmean we were treated very badly there, I mean with words, nobody was beaten there, but\njust sort of insulted and we were just told where to work. Some others who were there,\nby the way, were told to work also, were sent to other factories, but I happened to wind\nup at Siemens.",
        "Q: Did you feel a bit safer because they needed your output?",
        "A: At that time, the deportations hadn't started yet, so actually I felt, for two reasons, I\nmean to put it mildly, disappointed. I mean one was that I had just been about, I don't\nknow, seven or eight months at the ORT school and was just sort of getting into it\nlearning all kinds of aspects of the trade, of being a mechanic, and that would be\ninterrupted now. And the second thing, of course, that I knew I would be working for the\nGerman war production which didn't really make me obviously happy. At Siemens, the\nJews who worked there, and I think that 1s true of all other defense plants also, did not\nwork sort of scattered around throughout the factory here, maybe one machine operated\nby a Jew and next to him by a German worker. Instead, the Jews were all in one\nparticular department where all workers were Jews except for the foreman, of course.\nAnd in this way we also could be easier controlled. Number two, we were not permitted\nto walk through the factory area unescorted. Now, that meant the shift started at 6:00\na.m. and it was already quite a walk from the factory gate to the building where we were\nworking. So we had to be at the gate at 5:45 to be picked up by a guard which then led us\nto our department where we then punched in, we had to punch in before 6:00. If\nsomebody missed that guarded walk from the gate to the department, then a separate\nguard had to be sent and the foreman made a point of waiting after 6:00 and the person\nhad no way to get to the department and then he would send somebody down, the person\nthen would come and, of course, punch in after 6:00 and there was a rule that every late\nappearance has to be reported to the Gestapo and so that was a very powerful incentive to\nbe on time. Even at that time, at which deportations hadn't started yet, because nobody\nwanted to get entangled with the Gestapo. Furthermore, since we were not permitted to\nwalk through the factory alone, that also meant that there was no way how we could walk\nto the toilets or restrooms whenever the individual need arose for a person. Instead, twice\na day, we were also under guard, conducted to the toilets. One was at 9:00 and the\nsecond time after the lunch hour, around 1:00 or between 1:00 and 2:00. That meant if\nsomebody, for example, needed to go in between, that person had to report to the foreman\nand depending on the foreman's mood at that particular instant, he could either tell the\nperson, well, you just have to wait, sorry, until the group goes, or he could give him a\ndressing down and say, well, okay, I will detail somebody to take you down there. At\nthis point, by the way, all the workers, or the Jewish workers were men. Later on I will\nmention that we also had many Jewish women and, of course, that was particularly\nhumiliating in that case if a woman had to go to that male foreman and tell him that she\nhas to go to the restroom and then for him possibly to sneer and to detail somebody to\ntake her down to the ladies room.",
        "Q: What was the actual work you were doing?",
        "A: We built a part of electric motors called commutators. We didn't know what they\nwere used for, there was a rumor these were motors which were built into submarines,\nyou know, for their electrical supply, but that whether that was true or not, we didn't\nknow. Anyway, these commutators present an essential part of an electric motor.",
        "Q: Were there any attempts to your knowledge, to sabotage in subtle ways, the\nproduction?",
        "A: To my knowledge not, I gave it a brief thought and rejected it outright because while\nbeing there, of course, I also acquainted myself with the system, they had a very thorough\nand sophisticated quality control system whereby any part that was produced before it left\nthe factory, went to a controller, somebody who checked it out electrically and so on, that\nwould have been, anything that I would have done to, you know, sort of make it\nmisfunction, would have been discovered by that person. So, first of all, 1t wouldn't have\nachieved anything because it would have never gone to a place where it could have done\ndamage and secondly, as far as I remember they could trace who made it. So I would\nhave wound up in some horrible way without even achieving any purpose in doing so.\nYeah, I mean, the atmosphere, there were still a few German workers in that Jewish\ndepartment, actually, some even women, they had started to use women in factories,\nwhich used to be also unheard of in Germany, but simply because of the labor shortage\nafter the war broke out, since you know most of the able bodied males, of course, served\nin the Wehrmacht, in the army. And also, German workers, some actually were quite\nnice, I have to say, and some others were very hostile, so it varied from person to person.\nIn the, as I said before, that happened on the 30th of April, 1941, and in the summer of\n1941, there was rumor running around, we are going to get Jewish women. So,\nobviously, there was big excitement, notwithstanding the fact that for these women it\nprobably was not so much of a pleasure, but at least we looked forward to some positive\ndiversions. And the rumor turned out to be true and so later on that day, I think in the\nafternoon, a whole group of girls and women led again by a guard, of course, came in.\nOne of them particularly caught my eye immediately, she was in appearance exactly what\nI had always looked for sort of in a woman as far as appearance is concerned, sort of dark\nbrown, close to black hair, and brown eyes, curls and looking in general, a very pleasant\nfacial expression and sort of a very Semitic expression in her face, which I always\nenjoyed in a woman and still do, in fact. And it turned out, so I sort of concentrated my\nattentions the first few days on her, I found out that her first name was Margot and I also\nfound out that she had a steady boyfriend, which didn't surprise me. So this immediately\ncooled my interest, as least for the time being. We worked then together, I mean, we\nwere usually interspersed, there may have been a woman here and a male here and so on,\nseveral males and so on, and among ourselves a real camaraderie developed, the chief\nforeman was a man, his name was, I'll never forget, Alexander Siegel, and this, he was\nabout in his, retrospectively guessing, in his late 30's, I would say, possibly 40, and sort\nof a real rough neck, extremely nice to all females, who also after the war really didn't\nfind much reason to complain about him. And very gruff to males, and myself, I again\nstarted to rub him the wrong way and me the wrong way, so I was sort of on his list to\nbark at whenever he found a pretext for doing that. Yeah, I also met, that is very\nimportant, a male, in fact that was already on the first day that I started to work there, a\nmale, I mean a man a few years older than I, his name was Hans Fabisch and we became\nreally extremely close friends, it was my first close friend since I lost the one whom I had\nin high school, who emigrated to England. And we really went through thick and thin,\nwe were, we became close personal confidants, we shared our recreational hours and did\na lot together and talked a lot and he was probably one of two or three best friends that I\never had. He was, as I said, a few years older than I and he had decided to study\nmedicine and was already, he had all kinds of medical books at home and had started to\nsort of self-educate himself in anatomy and other similar medical subjects. Oh yeah, that\nreminds me of something else. Since we graduated from high school, there was really no\neducational outlet for us. Universities, of course, we were prohibited from enrolling in or\neven attending classes, and there was really nothing else except, you know, my\napprenticeship to become a mechanic. So, with a group of other friends and also\nparticularly former classmates from my high school graduating class, we developed sort\nof a set of informal talks which were held in different apartments of us sort of moving\naround. At that time I didn't use that word, but later on it occurred to me it was almost\nlike an underground university. First of all, our German teacher, who was actually a very\nhighly educated man and also in philosophy, he taught us sort of a course in philosophy\nand it was partly that he talked and partly it was done already in seminar style, where he\nwould assign certain topics to one of us and that person had to report back at the next\ntime and give a little talk on that. And this Hans Fabisch, whom I just mentioned, he had\nconnections to various medical doctors and we got talks from, I don't know, various\nmedical subjects, you know, of general interest and so on and then somebody else, I\nforgot who that was, knew an architect, a Jewish architect, these were all of course Jews\nwho talked and they were also happy because they were thrown out of their professions\nand had nothing to do, particularly this former German teacher whose name, incidentally,\nwas Kurt Levinstein, he, the others sort of rotated, but he consistently, week after week,\nhe never took a penny and he taught with extreme enthusiasm, which sort of was\ninfectious even. And that was a tremendous sort of intellectual outlet for us which\notherwise we had really no outlet for. Another person that I would like to mention is a\ngirl who was a few years older than I, I think about four years, her name was Ruth Perl,\nand she was part of that circle that also went to classes and she sort of became somewhat\nclose to my friend, Hans Fabisch and myself. And as time went on, I think closer to\nmyself, and we sort of started to strike up a friendship and we occasionally went to\nmovies together and it sort of developed that we became quite close and she was my first\ngirlfriend and we shared a lot of both personal thoughts, general thoughts and everything,\nalso entertainment and so on. Oh, yeah, an important factor by the way, also, was music.\nAll of us in that circle and in various other circles were lovers of classical music and that\nwent also for Ruth, and it was in wartime, practically impossible to buy records. So\npeople in private apartments, I mean also many non-Jews, sort of started business\nswapping, used records that is, and so I enriched my collection by, and by the way not\njust swapping, but also selling, so I bought quite a number of records in those days that I\ndidn't have before. It should be remembered, of course, that the quality and the kind of\nphonograph was a totally different world from what we have today. I mean, there was\nobviously no high-fi, there was obviously, there was only one speaker out of an inferior\nphonograph, and the phonograph was sometimes even hand driven by winding it up, and\nif it was electric, then it was kept illegally by the way, because it should have been turned\nin. But we managed to have sort of house concerts, also periodically, where we actually\nmade up a program like for a philharmonic concert, say some Beethoven symphony and\nmaybe a piano concerto by somebody else and different people would then bring those\nrecords and then we would all assemble in somebody's living room and listen to it just the\nway one would have gone to a philharmonic concert, which of course, was also forbidden\nfor Jews to go to. A drastic change in the situation of the Jews occurred with the\nintroduction of the yellow Star of David as of September 19, 1941. The law was very\nspecific that every Jew as defined by the Nuremberg laws has to wear such a yellow star\non his outer clothing whenever the person is in public, and it specified even exactly\nwhere it had to be worn, on the left hand side at about the level of the heart and also it\ncouldn't be tagged on by pins or safety pins, but had to be firmly sewn on, and this way\nthey wanted to avoid that people might put on a star and then later on take it off again and\nthe Gestapo was known to walk up to Jews with a star and sort of try it with their hand,\nwith their fingers to get under it to see whether there is a space between the star and the\ngarment to make sure that it was firmly sewn on.",
        "Q: They did this to you?",
        "A: No, not to me, but they have done it to people. That made it finally impossible to, or\nalmost impossible I should say, for Jews to go to all the entertainments and cultural\nofferings that were forbidden after Kristallnacht three years earlier. My friend Hans\nFabisch and I devised, actually it was his original idea, a method even to get around that.\nAnd it was based on the following, that in those days double breasted suits and coats\nwere fashionable and if you had, if you buttoned it the way, I mean men buttoned their\nsuit jackets then the left side where the star was on was, of course, on the outside and\nvisible, but if you changed the buttoning, and most were also sewn in such a way that\nthere were button holes and buttons, you could button it either way, and the way say\nwomen usually button them with the right part over the left, then the star would be\nautomatically covered up. That, it was important to have it that way because upon\nleaving one's apartment and also walking in one's own neighborhood, it would have been\nmuch too dangerous to walk around without a star because people know you and you\nwould have been immediately reported to the Gestapo, so what we did is we left our\nneighborhood as good Jews with our yellow stars, walked many blocks, maybe 10, to an\narea where nobody knew us, then ducked into an entrance of some apartment building\nand quickly changed the buttoning of our jacket or coat and reappeared as Aryan\nGermans and then we could go to a movie or anything without detection.",
        "Q: Weren't you a little bit afraid of doing this?",
        "A: No, in fact, it sort of actually got me excited, like getting my adrenalin flowing that I\nwas doing something like that. My father, I should say, was horrified and forbade me\nstrictly to do that because not only did I endanger myself, very often the Gestapo would\nthen also arrest the rest of the family, but I just didn't want to listen to any advice of\ncaution and also I couldn't stand being so cooped up. I should make a reference,\nincidentally, in connection with culture and movies. There existed a Jewish Kulturbund,\nor culture society, that actually existed already since long before the Kristallnacht,\nnamely since the time when Jewish artists were summarily thrown out from all German\ntheaters and movie production companies, etcetera. And it was founded originally, of\ncourse, to give Jewish musicians, actors, etcetera, a way of earning a living in their craft.\nAnd it was always fairly well visited, I remember in the summer of 1939, I saw an\nexcellent performance of a Kalman operetta (Kalman was a Hungarian operetta\ncomposer) Grafin Mariza, Countess Mariza, which was staged by the Kulturbund very\nprofessionally and I enjoyed it very much. I have seen other things, too, but of course,\nand then after Jews were prohibited from going to other general cultural events and\nentertainment etcetera, then, of course, the Kulturbund became, in addition to providing\nan outlet for fired Jewish artists, became also the only legal way at least, for the Jewish\npopulation at large even to see a movie or a play or symphony. They had a very nice\nsymphony orchestra, by the way, all consisting of Jews. But anyway, I considered it\nsimply a challenge to do something that I was prohibited from doing by the government.\nAnd so, we did that and my girlfriend, Ruth, went one day to a beauty parlor. Even\nbeauty parlors were forbidden for Jews, so of course, she didn't wear a Jewish star and\nalong the way she was stopped by a policeman, it was a regular policeman in uniform,\nand asked for her ID and when he saw that she was Jewish, he, the way she told it to me,\nwas evidently embarrassed and told her in an apologizing way that unfortunately, he is\nforced by law to report that to the Gestapo, any transgression by a Jew had to be reported\nto the Gestapo and he had no way to avoid that. And so we were terribly scared, and then\nfor weeks we didn't hear anything and so our scare sort of slowly subsided, although I\ntold her that if they really get after her, that she should simply go underground and then\nshe told me she will definitely not do that because she has no way to sustain herself and\ndoesn't know anyone where to go to, so anyway. On one day, in fact, on the 9th of\nSeptember, 1941, the 9th of September or the 9th of October, doesn't make a difference\nanyway, she, we always met in the morning on the way to the factory, my train actually, I\nhad to change trains at a certain station and she, and join another train where she already\nwas sitting in and she always sat in the same car so from there on, we always rode\ntogether. And on that morning, when I came into the railroad car where she was sitting\nin, I took one look and knew what had happened. Her eyes were totally red from both\nprobably having cried and having been sleepless, and she pulled, without saying a word,\na letter from the, from her pocketbook and which had the dreaded head Geheime\nStaatspolizei, the complete word for Gestapo, which is just an abbreviation. And it asked\nher to appear on that morning at 9:00 in the offices, room such and such, with, that's all,\njust to appear for an interrogation. But everybody knew what that meant. And she, now I\nhaven't really talked about the deportations, but the deportations had started a month\nearlier and Jews working in defense plants were understood to be exempted from\ndeportations, so she had come to work mainly to show our foreman, Alexander Siegel,\nthe summons to see what he could do for her. But he coldly told her that there was\nnothing that he could do for her because the Gestapo does have the complete lists of all\nJews employed by Siemens, and they know also of the agreement that Jews working in\ndefense plants are to be deferred, however, they can do what they want and there 1s\nnothing more that he can do. And then we talked a little bit, the atmosphere was so\nunbelievably stifling that I almost felt like somebody choked my throat, and then she said\ngoodbye to our mutual friend Hans Fabisch and to me and just walked out. It was the last\ntime I saw her. And, yeah, back up briefly, in September, just about a month before the\n7th, the first deportation train left for the East and it was characteristic, it was\ncharacteristic of all transports to the East, nobody knew where these people went to, it\nwas just said that it goes to the East.",
        "Q: Who was deported, what kinds of groups or categories?",
        "A: I don't think it was any particular category with the exception that those working in\ndefense plants were exempted, but otherwise, they just, I don't even know, I think the\nJewish community was enlisted in putting together lists for deportation. . .\nEnd of side tape two.\nTape 3",
        "Q: This is an interview with Ernest Fontheim on March 12, 1997. The interviewer is\nRandy Goldman, this is tape three, side A.",
        "A: The deportations, the mechanisms of the deportation was handled, of course, by the\nGestapo at the command level, but it was carried out under order of the Gestapo by the\nJewish community organizations. And they put together the lists of Jews to be deported.\nSometimes the Gestapo would make particular demands, for example, at one time the\nGestapo was afraid that Jews who lived along the elevated train tracks might give\nflashlight signals to Allied bombers and thus directing them to bomb the tracks, which on\nits face was ludicrous because they would have then also directed the bombs to\nthemselves living right next to the tracks. But anyway, be that as it may, the Gestapo\nordered the Jewish community to provide such a list and get these people on the\ndeportation trains. But in general, that was one exception, the community picked the\npeople, that was initially a process where people were notified sometime ahead of time\nby a letter which only said that their apartment has been designated to be cleared. It was\nsort of as if that was all there was to it, that the apartment was to be cleared. But\neverybody knew what it meant, of course. And with a set of detailed questionnaires\nwhere all the assets had to be filled in and so on and then another questionnaire where all\nthe contents of the luggage, there were detailed instructions how much luggage in terms\nof size and weight could be taken along, which items should be taken along and which\ncould not be taken along. Among those not to be taken along, for example, were\nnegotiable, anything negotiable value, securities, money, cash, jewelry and it had to be\nfilled out exactly what the contents of the luggage was that was to be taken along. Now\nthe result of that was that there was a wave of suicides. Many people who were too\nscared to go through the deportations since nobody knew what really happened to these\npeople and so after awhile the Gestapo discontinued that and then went over to assist\nthem, where people were just being picked up without any prior notification. And\nanyway, they had to be kept in a transit camp before being shipped out because the cattle\ncars and freight cars that were used for deporting Jews, such a train was holding upward\nof six, seven hundred people, even up to a thousand and eleven hundred. And it took\nmore than a day or two to pick up that many people, so they were housed in a transit\ncamp. At first the transit camp, in fact, was one of the synagogues until the military,\nyeah, that synagogue, by the way, had been only lightly damaged during Kristallnacht\nand had been repaired afterwards. So that was first used for a transit camp and then the\nmilitary sort of made a demand to have that synagogue for, I think, storage of some sort\nor other. And then it was shifted to an old age home of the Jewish community and Jews\nwere collected there until they had enough people in there to fill a transport, then they\nwere taken away.",
        "Q: During this process, were you very aware of what was going on?",
        "A: Yeah, at that point, yes. And in fact, this group of people that I mentioned who were\nalso having various lectures and so on, we, at that point, we decided that we have to\nsomehow do something, at least, first of all, to find out what is happening because people\nwere being picked up and then never heard from again. Now, that in itself has a\ntremendously terrorizing effect, somebody, your neighbor or maybe even your brother or\nsomebody close to you whom you still saw yesterday, today he was gone, or she. And\nnot only was that person gone, but I mean except for the fact that you knew they were\ntransported East, otherwise you had no inkling. There was never a letter or postcard\ncoming back, there was never any sign of life even, so that in itself had a terrorizing\neffect, so but we were all very, very naive about the whole process. We sat down and\nhad a big sort of session where we threw out all kinds of ideas then we came away with a\ngreat idea that whoever of the group is the first one to be deported, then has to see\nsomehow after getting to the East, to contact maybe German soldiers or somebody who\ncan get a message back to one of us describing what was happening. In the light of how\nthe deportations were handled, that was just unbelievably naive and, of course, the first\none of our group, there was a girl, I still remember her, and of course, she vanished\nexactly like everybody else and nothing was ever heard from her. She obviously had no\nchance to contact anyone. I mean, Jews who were deported were immediately, of course,\nthat was not really known at that time, but they were immediately put into either ghettos\nor extermination camps. And in extermination camps, many were immediately on the\nspot gassed and that who were not gassed were kept in that camp for hard labor and had\nno way to communicate with anybody outside of that camp. It was just totally\nimpossible.",
        "Q: And your family? They were all fine?",
        "A: Yeah. Of course, again, the thing was that my father considered himself lucky\noriginally because he was exempted from the forced labor because of a doctor certificate,\nbut now that labor was the only thing that exempted you from deportation, that turned out\nto be not so lucky. He went through several stages of such real ironies. Now, of course,\nhe would not have been in a position really to do factory work, however, he, now he\nknew one of the personalities at the central, at the congregation offices and, in fact, it was\na woman who was in charge of the sort of deportation decisions and so on. And she gave\nhim an unpaid job there for the community, what he did he never really talked about and\nhe was, I mean like in all other things, very close mouthed, but I know he had some work\nat the Jewish community that may have exempted him for some time. Now, in April of\n'42, oh, I have to back up, actually. Now I remember I made a mistake when I talked\nabout the arrest of my girlfriend, Ruth. I know that I said it was in either September or\nOctober of '41. It was actually '42. In '41 the deportations had barely started and it was\nin October of '42, or September, I don't know, that her arrest took place. Okay, coming\nback, my parents were actually arrested in April of '42 and by the Gestapo.",
        "Q: Now, I want to interrupt you for a second. Because on your notes, I see that you said\nthey were imprisoned in December of '42.",
        "A: Yeah, well I'm coming to that.",
        "Q: Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.",
        "A: And they were taken to the collection point, to that synagogue that I referred to, but\nthe Gestapo officers who arrested them said, oh yeah, what happened was that my father\nhad agreed with his personal physician that he would either commit suicide or take some\nstrong sedative which would totally knock him out and the physician prescribed to him\nsomething called Veronal. I don't think it exists here now, at least not under this name, so\nI don't know what it would be here. But, he immediately took that and was sort of like in\na coma, so he was, obviously they couldn't take him along, so they put in a phone call and\nhad the Jewish hospital pick him up and then my mother and sister were taken and they\ntold me to come along because they said it's likely if the father is not capable of being\ntransported, that my mother and sister would be sent home again. So that is also one of\nthe weird examples where occasionally they had something that might almost sound like\nhumane in all this murderous brutality. At any rate, I spent several hours in that transit\ncamp and it was a horrible sight. The Jews there, it was a synagogue, and the people who\nwere to be sort of awaited their deportation, they were all at the balcony. I mean,\nEuropean synagogues at that time, and I think still today in fact, separate the sexes, men\npray downstairs and women in the balcony, so they had all of the people for deportation\nin the balcony and you could see sort of people up wandering around absentmindedly and\nso on, and in a daze. And then on the ground floor, which was the area where men used\nto pray, that's where the Gestapo, they had their offices and they would periodically call\nsomebody down to fill out forms and for interrogation and so on. So anyway, after\nseveral hours my mother and sister were told they could go home again and so that's what\nwe did. And they handed me our luggage back, their luggage, and then we went back.",
        "Q: Did you think that when you were in that synagogue that you might all be leaving and\nthat it was just a ruse?",
        "A: No, I didn't. It didn't occur to me. But maybe that was just my habitual optimism, I\ndon't know. Now as time went on, the situation became more and more unbearable. I\nremember one co-worker in the factory, from the Jews he was probably about five years\nolder than I. He appeared one morning with a totally lost expression. The night before\nwhen he came home from work, he found the apartment empty. He had a wife and a little\nbaby girl, I think, and they were gone. I mean, he couldn't even say goodbye to them.\nThey were gone, and he was supposed to continue working. And there were many\nsimilar horror stories, and they were constantly, of course, circulating and, in fact, since\nall Jews were also no longer permitted to buy newspapers, by the way, and as we\ndiscussed before, also had to turn in their radios, so there was a new way to sort of spread\nthe news, and that was called sort of radio by mouth or mouth radio. And I mean the\npsychological situation became just unbearable, it was sort of a combination of a fear of\nthe worst to come and being trapped into something where one has no control and mixed\nwith a desire to do something about it. I mean, many of my friends, also my friend Hans\nand I and so on, we talked about going underground, but to go underground that means\ngoing into hiding with forged papers, seemed like such an enormous undertaking, I mean\nfirst of all to get forged ID's and it would cost a lot of money and then food would have\nto be procured on the black market and, of course, none of us had any money to speak of,\nso it was mainly a lot of talk. Now some people, mainly those who were politically\nengaged, they were able to go underground and be protected by politically like-minded\npeople. That was true, especially of communists. Oh yeah, and talking about\ncommunists, there was a Jewish communist cell actually centered in one of the other\nJewish departments at Siemens and headed by a man named Herbert Baum and his wife,\nMarianne Baum, B-A-U-M. And they had been, apparently, an underground cell for\nyears only of Jews and basically just meeting and sort of like holding seminars about\nMarxism and the dangers of capitalism and fascism and so on and then at some point they\ndecided that wasn't really enough and something had to be done to fight back against the\nNazis. And in the, it was also sort of the summer, I think, of 1942, in the center of Berlin\nthe Nazis staged a vast exhibit under the name the Soviet Paradise and, of course, they\nmeant it sarcastically and the exhibit was devoted to materials which they had, you know,\nuncovered in their process of conquering large parts of the western Soviet Union and\nmuch of it may have been true, much of it was lies, whatever, and the exhibit was\napparently quite successful, there was throngs visiting it, so they decided to burn it down.\nBut, of course, they were not experts at anything, I mean they were not experts in\nsabotage and in technical things and so on, so it was a big tragedy, they succeeded in\nputting in a small fire somehow, the damage was so minimal that the Germans even could\nkeep it out of the newspapers. If it had been a major fire, they would have had no choice\nbut to at least report it, but 1t wasn't even reported in the press. And not only that, but\nimmediately they didn't catch anybody, they sort of, they scattered certain delayed\nincendiaries which you put somewhere and then it takes five minutes or so for the flame\nto break out, so they were gone by the time, so nobody was caught. But the Gestapo had\nfound a network of undercover agents in the underground communist movement, anyway\nthe details I don't know. The fact is, that they got on their trail, they were arrested all of\nthem and the first thing that the Gestapo did is tell the Jewish community that they want\n500 Jewish men immediately, 250 of them will be shot on the spot and another 250 will\nbe immediately deported to concentration camps. And if any sabotage by where Jews are\ninvolved happens again, they will take 10 times as many people. And that was a horror\nthat immediately spread through this mouth radio, of course, and I knew some of the\npeople involved, incidentally, because it was centered at Siemens, and the Baums were at\nSiemens. And so that contributed to the demoralizing effect. As a sideline, I want to say\nthat they became great heroes in the now defunct German Democratic Republic, formerly\nEast Germany, and there was a street named after them and books were written and so on.\nBut, of course, they are all dead. Actually, one of the members of the group was a girl\nwho graduated with me from that high school, she was in my class, and in fact, I\nremember that after graduation, I once had a long discussion. She was then already a\ncommunist, and she tried to convert me. All I remember is that we had a very lively hard\nhitting discussion and I didn't convince her and she didn't convince me. But it never\noccurred to me that she would belong to the, if she would have convinced me, who\nknows, maybe I would have been in that group also. Anyway, yeah, they were all tried\nby the so-called People's Court, that's the same court that also convicted those, you know,\nplotters who tried to assassinate Hitler two years later in July, '44. And of course, most\nof them were executed, a few got some jail sentences. Alright, this is basically the\natmosphere, now also I should say about Siemens, coming back to that, I said already that\nwe got no worker food ration stamps and even less than the general consumer, we got\npaid less than the German workers who did similar work and I said we couldn't go to the\ntoilets, also we couldn't use their cafeteria, we had to bring our own lunch and sort of eat\nit at our work desk and of course, we had no right to vacation time. And, but through my\nfriend Hans Fabisch, whom I mentioned earlier and who was training to become a\nphysician, he sort of advised me on certain back symptoms which cannot be traced by a\ndoctor which are purely subjective, but make you incapable of working, it has to sort of\nhurt at a certain point and when the doctor pushes this way it hurts more and that way it\nhurts less, and so I feigned that and so I received an official sort of a statement, yeah, as a\nJew I couldn't just call in, I'm sick today, you had to have a physician certified written\nstatement, you know, that Ernest Fontheim, you know, has blah, blah, such and such a\nsickness or disease and is not capable to come to work. So anyway, I got that following\nhis instructions, that was in the latter part of December. So on December 24th, then I was\nat home. I want to come back, I said earlier in this interview, that Christmas played a\nspecial role in our family and I meant that in many ways, it played a role as I grew up\nbecause we always had a Christmas tree and we, and Santa Claus came and we had gifts.\nWell, on the 24th of December, 1942, my parents were arrested and my sister. And it\nhappened this way. I was actually that was when I was on that fake sick leave and I had\nleft the apartment to make a phone call from a public phone, as I said we didn't have a\nphone. Public phones were also prohibited to Jews but by walking a few blocks and\nhiding my star I could then go into a booth and I was making a call to the parents of\nMargot, whom I had met sometime earlier. And they had a phone because they were\nsubletting an apartment that was in the name of a Hungarian Jewish woman and since she\nwas not a German citizen, all these German laws, these antisemitic laws, did not apply to\nher, even though she was a Jew, but so anyway, so they had that phone and I called them\nup, I don't even know why anymore, it doesn't make a difference, but when I went back,\nwe lived now in that apartment with these relatives of ours that I described earlier, which\nwas a second floor apartment and as I approached the apartment, I noticed my sister, Eva,\nleaning out the window and waving me away. And I knew immediately, in those days\nyou knew always what was happening on a signal. And so I walked away, I knew the\npeople were there to pick my family up. So I walked just maybe 50 yards or so back so\nthat I was still in view and watched what was going on. And then after a while the janitor\ncame, the janitor actually happened to be also a Jew, but lived in a mixed marriage and\nwas protected therefore by, through the Nazi laws. And he came and said I should come\nup, the people who came for the pickup were actually Jewish orderlies and they go\nstrictly by lists and my name, there were just the names of both parents and my sister. So\nI went up and there was total frenzy at home, of course, and my father was again out, he\nhad done the same thing, and one of the orderlies had already gone down to call the\nGestapo to say that he was not, could not be transported. And he came back after, I don't\nknow, 10, 15 minutes saying he was told that my father has to be brought under whatever\ncircumstances, even if they have to carry him down the stairs in a chair. And then my\nparents were frantically packing, I mean most people had already most of the things\npacked and so did they, but there are some last minute things. My father was not\ncompletely out in a coma, but in a very weakened state and he took my hands and said we\nwill never see each other again. And then my sister suddenly out of the blue, threw her\narms around my neck and had an incredible crying spell. Her whole body shook and I\nkept her close and I frequently thought to myself why I simply did not take her and walk\nout with her. That is a question which I have asked myself ever since. Then when the\npreparations were done, my father was actually really carried down the steps in a chair;\nand the picking up of Jews was done by a moving van from a company that I'll never\nforget, the name was Scheffler. Of course, the Gestapo presumably leased those vans,\nand inside the vans they had long benches where the Jews that were picked up were sort\nof lined up and then sitting until it was full and then the van would go to the transit camp.\nBy that time the transit camp had shifted from the synagogue where it used to be still in\nApril, to a former old age home of the Jewish community.",
        "Q: And your sister, your mother and father?",
        "A: Yeah, and actually, I decided to ride along in that van for some blocks to be together\nwith them some more. And then at the corner of Guntzelstrasse and Trautenaustrasse I\nsaid goodbye and jumped out the back and that was the last time I saw my parents and\nmy sister on December 24, 1942, Christmas Eve. On the next day our doorbell rang and\nwhen I opened, I was surprised to see my former mathematics teacher, Dr. Baer, from the\nJewish school. He told me that he was serving as an orderly in the transit camp and had a\nmessage from my mother, and he added that it was strictly forbidden for orderlies to\nmake any communication between people in the transit camp and people outside, but\nsince I had been his student for quite a number of years and he knew me already as a\nsmaller boy, he did it out of a gesture of friendship. He told me first of all that my\nmother had forgotten certain things that he offered to bring in and they would also be\nglad if I could pack some additional food and then he added that my mother also told him\nthat she was interrogated the day they arrived there by the Gestapo, and the Gestapo\nshowed particular interest in me. They wanted to know what hours I work, when I come\nhome from work, etcetera. And I knew immediately that that was a message and\nobviously the message was never to go back. So that's what I did. At that point I had no\nplace to stay. But as I just mentioned earlier, the parents of my co-worker, Margot, in\nwhom I had been interested at first, lived, sublet an apartment that was actually registered\nin the name of a Hungarian Jewish woman and, therefore, was not on the Gestapo list.\nAnd they had a small sort of a maid's room, aside of the apartment but it belonged to it,\nwhich they used for storage, but they said that I could stay there and sleep there also. So\nthat's what I did. On New Year's Eve, December 31, first of all I knew at that time that\nno transport had left Berlin, so I knew that my parents were still there and I was there\nwith Margot and her parents and also with a friend of theirs, I forgot his name, he was\nsort of an elderly man, about 60, in his 60's, and his entire family had been arrested, but\nhe had some contact to the Gestapo and was negotiating with them to bribe them to get\nhis family out. And he was supposed to meet his Gestapo contact the next day, but he\nalso knew the Gestapo had power to do anything; they could just take whatever he had to\noffer, arrest him too and laugh in his face. And that New Year's Eve was the most\nhorrible New Year's Eve that I ever had in my life. My parents and sister were in the\ntransit camp, my girlfriend Ruth was already long gone and I didn't know what would\nbecome of me and that man was there with his horror story. The atmosphere was so\nunbelievably gloomy that it is even hard to describe. I kept in touch with my friend Hans\nFarbisch, of course, and he actually had met a physician, a Jewish physician whom he\nwas going to marry. She was a few years older than he and she was Austrian so that's\nwhy, otherwise a person of that age wouldn't have had a medical degree in Germany\nbecause in Germany a Jew couldn't study any more since 1933, but coming from Vienna,\nshe could study until '38. Anyway, she had her medical degree and her name was Valli\nand they got married in the first week of January, wait a minute, yeah. And Hans and I\ndiscussed the possibility maybe of going underground together. But a basic difference of\nopinion developed between Hans and myself. He, his philosophy was that as long as we\nwere employed at Siemens, we were protected and deferred from deportation. On the\nother hand, if we went underground and were caught in some ID check on the street\nwithout a star, that meant immediate deportation. Therefore, he felt at this point 1t was\nmuch safer if we stayed legal, quote, worked at Siemens and were protected that way and\nthen go underground whenever the, you know, the deferment would no longer be valid or\nSiemens might lay us off or whatever. I, on the other hand, argued that the Gestapo was\nnot going to send us printed invitations or announcements saying now you are no longer\nprotected and deferred. That is going to come overnight without that anybody knows it\nand then it's going to be too late. It is true right now it is safer to be walking around with\na star and working at Siemens because that is protection, but because of the uncertainty of\nhow long that is going to last, there is no, that risk we have to take. And there was\nanother point, in fact, which leads me to briefly flash back to our time at Siemens. I had\nforgotten to mention that already since the fall of 1942, we received in our department\nforced laborers from occupied, German occupied territories. It started out with a group of\nFrench women and after a while, we also got Polish women to work in our department.\nThese were all people who were deported, obviously, against all international law and\nwithout their consent, into Germany to work for war production. And I also referred to\nthat in talking to Hans, that it's very obvious, first of all the Germans have millions and\nmillions of people in the occupied territories and a few tens of thousands of Jews, so I,\nwhy do they need a few tens of thousands of Jews if they can be replaced from a pool that\nhas millions of people. And they have already started to introduce these people in our\ndepartment and they know already how to do the things that we are doing, so I think that\nprobably the time is imminent even that these deferments for work in defense plants are\ngoing to lapse. But we did not, obviously, resolve that difference of opinion. Hans\nhimself felt that for the time being he was safer that way. He did, however, do one thing\nand that is to order forged ID's. A forged ID at least for himself to go, it was practically\nimpossible to live in Germany without some sort of an ID because there were frequent\nchecks for identification on the streets, there was a whole spectrum of agencies who\ncould do that in addition to just the ordinary police, there was the Gestapo, of course,\nwhich was essentially a political police, there was the so-called criminal police, these\nwere detectives looking for common criminals, there was the military police, there was a\nso-called labor police and probably other agencies that I wasn't even aware of. So,\nbasically, it was definitely necessary to have forged identification papers because if you\nwere asked for an identification on the, by any one of these agencies, and you were not\nable to identify yourself to their satisfaction, that meant immediate arrest. Margot's father\nhad a contact that could provide a forged identification as an employee for the, an\norganization called Deutsche Arbeitsfront, which means in English, German Labor Front.\nEnd of side one of tape three.",
        "Q: This is tape three, side B of an interview with Ernest Fontheim continued on March\n13, 1997, the interviewer is Randy Goldman.",
        "A: This organization, the German Labor Front, was the Nazi answer, basically, to labor\nunions. They had smashed, of course, the labor unions and declared them illegal and also\nthey declared that their ideology, this whole idea of class warfare and of a sort of\nadversarial relationship between management and labor is not in the sense of Germanic\nnationalism. Instead they formed this German Labor Front which contained members\nboth of the employed laborers and employees and of management and owners and the\nsupposed idea was that in this forum, before conflicts arise, all issues will be discussed in\na cooperative way because both sides are obviously interested in the flourishing of the\ncompany. This whole idea might have sounded good on paper, but it was, of course,\ndone mainly in order to smash the voice of the workers and to enable German industry to\nincrease production and mainly war production, without any disruptions. So, Margot's\nfather had some contact and for roughly the sum of fifteen hundred German Reichsmark,\nwhich was the currency at that time, the opportunity, fifteen hundred apiece, of course, to\nobtain ID's as an employee with the German Labor Front. This was, of course, a very\nprestigious organization and so, and the ID also contained a passport picture of the\nperson, the obviously name, birthdate, address and so on and then a rubber stamp\nnumbered one, two, three, four, five, to be stamped, I think, semiannually, so that it also\nhad the impression of being updated on a semiannual basis. The rubber stamp came, was\njust a number, came with the ID itself so we could sort of revalidate it every six months\nfor ourselves. Hans also agreed to buy this ID and sort of put it away in case when the\nsituation is what he considers ripe to go underground. In the meantime, as I had\nmentioned earlier, I was already no longer living in our apartment because of the hidden\nwarning that my mother had conveyed to me and I lived in a small maid's room of the\napartment of Margot's parents, but during the day commuted to our apartment because I\nhad decided to save as much as possible. And, incidentally, I should also add that at that\ntime, my parents and sister were still in the transit camp in that former Jewish old age\nhome. Only after the war, in fact fairly recently with publications of the history and so\non, did I learn of the brutal conditions in that camp. I mean, I never thought that there\nwould be nice conditions, but at least I thought, since it was an old age home, there would\nbe beds in there and they would at least have some form of amenities. I learned now that\na, some so-called specialists in Jewish emigration from the Vienna SS had been gotten to\nBerlin on the orders of Adolf Eichmann and also to speed up the deportation of Jews, and\nthe first thing they, that the man in charge was a man named Alois Brunner incidentally,\nhis rank was SS Hauptsturmfthrer. The fact that he was in Berlin, in fact, was known at\nthat time, but what was not known 1s that his first act after arriving and looking at the\ntransit camp in that former old age home, that he ordered that all furniture be thrown out\nthe windows and that was literally done, they were thrown out of the windows, even\nthough there was a shortage of furniture for Germans. And there were just bare floors so\nhe could pack more Jews into the building. And so even in that transit camp already,\nthey must have lived under very miserable circumstances.",
        "Q: How long was your family in that camp?",
        "A: That comes to, their transport left on the 12th of January, it was a Tuesday and an\nunbelievably unusually cold day, even for Berlin. And the departure of a transport\nbecame known within hours always in Berlin because that couldn't, you know, there were\nwhat, a thousand people were marched from the transit camp to the nearest, they didn't go\nto a regular railroad station, but to a freight yard where they were loaded on like cattle.\nThe, as I had said earlier, the arrest of my parents took place on December 24th and I\nguess 1n order to allow the SS some Christmas vacation from their strenuous activities, no\ntransport went away from Berlin between December 24th and January 12th, so they were\nthere almost three weeks, two and a half weeks.",
        "Q: Were you at work when they left?",
        "A: No, I, as I explained earlier, I was on that faked sick leave and I simply never went\nback. The sick leave, of course, was limited to, I forgot what it was, a certain number of\ndays, maybe a week, but by never going back then I was hoping that my absence\nwouldn't be immediately noticed because obviously, if somebody was just absent, they\nwould immediately send orders for the arrest of that person.",
        "Q: So, where were you when the transport left, did you see this procession?",
        "A: No, no, no. I didn't see, I just heard that also through the mouth radio that I had\nmentioned also at some point, that when, actually considering how primitive it was and\nthat we didn't even have telephones, was incredibly efficient how it went from, these\nthings went from mouth to mouth. Yeah, let me see. During that time, as I said, we, I\nlived at the, in that maid's room at the apartment of Margot's parents which was really\nvery far away in distance from our apartment where we lived, so every day I went there\nto pack things, yeah, and my plan was to have as much of personal effects and so on\npicked up by a moving company. That moving company had been a client of my father's\nwhen he was still practicing law, I still remember the name was Gebriider Zimmermann,\nwhich means Brothers Zimmermann. The owner actually was a Mr. Schiitt and who was\nvery, I must say, was a fantastic man and he knew of course that we are Jews and he\nstuck with us, he had already from our nice apartment where we were thrown out, a lot of\nfurniture stored in his storage place under a different name, and so that it couldn't be\ntraced. And I went to him and told him that my parents had been arrested and would be\ndeported and I wanted to save more things and he immediately agreed and the pickup\nthen was supposed to come on January 19th and I was supposed to designate all the\npieces that were supposed to be picked up and there were certain pieces of furniture that I\nthought maybe at one time I might want to sell. And also, a trunk full of all kinds of\npersonal articles, it also contained the diary of my sister, she had kept a diary for a long\ntime and also particularly, the letter that my sister had written to me when she was, as a\nharvest helper away from Berlin and I had written to her of the arrest of my girlfriend,\nRuth. And so I was busy then every day for a few hours in the apartment and always left\nconsiderably earlier than I would have come back had I worked, so that I wouldn't be\nrunning into some trap by the Gestapo. On the 18th of January, it was one day before I\nhad ordered the van, the moving van, to come. I was again doing some last packing to\nfinish up for the pickup on the next day, when one of the women I had mentioned earlier\nthat there were quite a number of people living, had been living in that apartment, one of\nthe women came and reported that the infamous pickup, moving van, was in the\nBrandenburgische Strasse, that is the street where my friend Hans was living. I think I\nhad mentioned that the pickup of Jews for deportation was done by a furniture van, a\nfurniture moving van, of the firm Scheffler and Brandenburgische Strasse, as I said, was\nthe street where my friend Hans was living, although that was in midmorning and I knew\nthat Hans was at work at Siemens, but his wife, Valli, did not work and might be at home.\nSo I immediately grabbed my coat and raced, it was several blocks away from where our\napartment was, and then I turned the corner into Brandenburgische Strasse and saw that\nvan parked right in front of their house. And it struck me like lightening, I stopped for a\nfew seconds, considering how that house also like all houses where Jews lived, of course,\nwas a so-called Jew house which meant that there was a large number of Jewish parties,\nand I figured that the probability that they were just in their apartment is probably small,\nand at any rate, I would never be able to face my friend if I didn't do anything I could to\nget his wife out. So, and they lived, it was a walk-up on the fifth floor, I raced up the\nsteps, rang the bell and they had sublet one room, just in an apartment which was rented\nby a Mrs. Striem, and the door, Mrs. Striem opened the door, her face looked horrible, as\nwhite as even more white than this wall here, like this cuff, I've never seen her like that.\nAnd she looked completely dejected and all she said, \"what are you doing here? Get\naway quickly!\" And then instead of turning and running, I asked, \"1s Valli, I want to talk\nto Valli\". Then she repeated, \"get away!\" And upon that, I saw behind her a man in an\nSS uniform appearing and at that point I turned around and raced down and was on the\nlanding below when I heard a thunderous voice in a Viennese dialect saying, halt\nimmediately. And I turned around, I saw an SS officer leaning over the balustrade and\nwith a drawn pistol pointing at me. And I got such a shock of scare that almost my knees\nbuckled under me and I walked back up and he got me in, closed the door and the first\nthing, your papers. And then I pulled out my forged ID from the German Labor Front\nwhich he looked at carefully and compared my face with the picture on the ID and then\nhe barked at me what I was doing there. You know, because there was supposed to be no\ncontact between so-called Aryans and Jews. And, of course, the question totally caught\nme by surprise and I was so devastated and fearful anyway that I couldn't think straight\nso all I could blurt out was that the Jew who lives here still owes me some money which\nin that respect was stupid and the guy didn't even catch it because if he owed me money,\nthat meant that I must have loaned it to him and if I loaned him money, what business did\nI have loaning money to a Jew, but he didn't pursue it. But instead, he took my ID put it\nin his uniform pocket and said, I want to ask you some more questions tomorrow, I want\nyou to come to my office at Gestapo headquarters, such and such street address, room\nnumber so and so, I forgot that, but I do remember at 9:00 tomorrow morning I want to\nsee you there and then you will get your ID back. And then I left and I felt as if I had sort\nof escaped from hell, that was one of the two or three scariest episodes in my entire life.\nI went down, but I had at least one thing, while we were standing, that little conversation\ntook place inside their door, in a little sort of like a vestibule, and the various rooms went\noff it, and in Hans' room I didn't see a person. So it seemed to me that Valli wasn't there.\nSo as I raced down as quickly as possible because I thought maybe the guy changes his\nmind, I decided, then I walked out of the house to the street and to the next corner was\nseveral houses. So I walked to the next corner and around the corner, but then I\npositioned myself there on the corner so I could see who approached the house and I was\nhoping that if Valli would come, that I could signal or shout at her and get her away. It\nwas also a cold winter day, the 18th of January, and I stood there. In the meantime, that\nvan had already left, but it was known that sometimes if a person that they were looking\nfor wasn't there, they left somebody behind so that's why I stuck there until my legs were\nreally like just columns of ice and I couldn't stand it anymore, and at 4:00 also was shift\nchange, I felt I had to notify Hans. And, of course, that was a tricky thing because I was\nby that time, away without, from work without permission, so I couldn't be seen there.\nSo I went to the elevated station that we went to when we went to work at Siemens and\nthen walked toward the factory, but didn't walk all the way, but sort of hid in the entrance\nof an apartment building which was still a block or two away from the factory, but where\npeople at the shift change would sort of stream past. And of course, by that time it was\nwinter, it was already fairly dark. So I stood there and then when Hans came by, I\nwhistled to him and he stopped and was surprised to see me and I told him the events of\nthe morning and of course, he got very depressed and agitated by that. Anyway, we went\nthen together back, and then when we arrived in front of his house and looked up, there\nwas the. In wartime windows had to be darkened in order not to give away locations to\nenemy airplanes, but often, I mean not often but always, there was sort of a small slit of\nlight coming just from the edge where the curtain just quite didn't hit the wall. And we\nsaw some light coming out of his apartment so we both felt somebody must be home at\nleast. So we rushed up and on the floor below, Hans turned to me and said, you know,\nwhy don't you wait here. I'll go up and if everything 1s clear, I'll call you. So I stood one\nfloor below and watched him and he put the key into the lock but hadn't turned it yet,\nwhen the door opened from the inside. And I saw a tall grey haired civilian opening the\ndoor who didn't belong there, never seen before in my life, and he immediately looked\ndown and shouted to me, who are you? And then I turned around and ran as fast as I\ncould. I never ran as fast in my life, I think, and that was the last time I saw Hans. And\nas sort of a sideline, that was the 18th of January, 1943, exactly to the day five years later\nthat my high school friend from that orthodox high school, on the 18th of January, '39, no\nfour years later I guess, left Berlin to emigrate to England. So I left I guess the two best\nfriends that I had in my life, I lost on the same day, on the 18th of January, the only thing\nis the one who left for England, left for life and he 1s still alive, he's in Jerusalem now.\nSo then I went back again to Margot's parents and there was a terrible argument. Her\nfather accused me that I was reckless, that I should have never, by having that ID\nconfiscated that means now that ID may even be useless now because the Gestapo\nknows, they obviously are going to find out that this is a forged ID and I was endangering\neverybody else and so we had a big argument about that. And then, not only that, but I\nprobably overreacted and overestimated the efficiency of the Gestapo, but at that time I\nthought they could probably lift my fingerprints from that ID, and all Jews had been\nfingerprinted already, years before, so they had a fingerprint file of all Jews and\nexperienced criminologists can match fingerprints, so it occurred to me that, what if they\nmatch my fingerprint, find out who I really, who the owner of that ID really was and then\ncome to the apartment and if the moving van is just there, they will immediately find out\nthat this is being picked up, you know, by that firm of Zimmermann and that will lead\nthem to me somehow. So I called up the firm and cancelled the pickup and that was one\nof the most horrible mistakes of my life. It wasn't the furniture, but it was the personal\nthings that were contained in the trunk. The trunk contained my sister's diary, her letters,\nincluding the letter that she had written to me after the arrest of Ruth and I never went\nback to that building simply because I was afraid that it might be staked out. While the\nGestapo, as far as I know, never looked just for Jews who were in hiding in particular, but\nin a case where there was a forged ID from an important Nazi agency, they would surely\nbe interested in finding out how that ID was obtained, from whom, etcetera, etcetera, so\nthat would have been worthwhile to stake that address out. I just, in retrospect, don't\nbelieve that they were that efficient that they would have had all of that figured out within\nless than a day, but at that time, I felt strongly that it was too unsafe to go back and also\ntoo unsafe to have the moving company come because that would have led them to me.\nThe result of this is that I have no personal belongings of my sister whatsoever. I have\npictures, of course, but that's all. We intensified now the search for a place to hide.\nMargot's parents, and incidentally, and of course I immediately had to practically move\nmountains to get another ID. Margot's parents were also planning to go underground, but\ndidn't, had one or two possible sort of options, none of which was ideal. Then I came up\nwith an idea and that was the former office supervisor of my father's law office. It was a\nMrs. Frieda Kunze. She was actually a marvelous person. She had been in his office as\nfar back as Ican remember. I don't know whether she was there since before I was born\nor since I was a little boy, but as long as remember. As a little boy whenever I was\ntaken to the office, she was already working for my father and in the last years, she was\nhis office supervisor. And she held to us even after my father lost his license to practice\nand, of course, then she lost that job. She visited us frequently and I remember often she\nbrought us food even, that she had taken from her own not very generous rations. And\nshe owned a primitive weekend cottage in a village about roughly 35 miles southeast of\nBerlin. And I didn't, all I knew is that she owned that place, I didn't know, I had never\nbeen there, what it was like or so, but I went to her and, of course, I told her also that my\nparents and sister had been arrested and I told her that whether we could make some\narrangement that I and also a family of friends, that's a couple and a daughter, could live\nin that cottage. And she said that, you know, because my father was such a marvelous\nboss for decades for her and she also considered herself as a friend of the family, that she\nwould do anything to save my life. On the other hand, she wasn't so sure whether that\ncottage really was the right place, she repeated again that it was very primitive and maybe\nwe ought to look at it. So first of all, of course, I introduced her to Margot's parents, I\nthink 1t was even the next day, we all went to her apartment and sort of got acquainted\nand then we agreed on a day when we would together travel out and look at the place.\nShe said she hadn't been there even for a year or two and that it may be in a very\nrundown state. So we went out there and it was sort of a settlement, this is a sort of\nGerman custom actually, that there were settlements of colonies, sort of colonies of\ncottages with very small pieces of land like gardens around them, which sort of say lower\nmiddle class Germans would own to have a place to go to on weekends. And so we went\nthere and looked at the place. It was again a cold winter day and the first thing we\nnoticed was that the roof was leaking and the cottage was really very primitive, there was\nof course, no inside running water, there was a pump in front of the house in the garden\nand, of course, there was no electricity, there was an oil lamp there, but for that one had\nto buy sort of a particular kind of petroleum which was almost impossible to get. Also\none could use candles, which also were hard to get. And then for heating, basically, there\nwas a kitchen stove which served both as a stove for heating and as a stove for cooking, it\nwas sort of a cast iron sort of a rectangular body on cast iron legs and on top there were\nsort of concentric rings of iron which could be taken out and pots of different sizes put in\nthere to heat things and cook things. And that was all there was and the furniture,\nobviously, was very primitive, there were two rooms and a sort of a veranda. And we\nwere desperate and so anyway, we said we would have to make do and she agreed to let\nus have the place and, of course, she impressed on us the need to be extremely careful\nand, but I mean, we were aware of that ourselves. Our punishment would have been\nAuschwitz if we would have been not careful and would have been discovered and she\nwould have probably also wound up in a concentration camp.",
        "Q: What about the neighbors?",
        "A: Yeah, I'm coming to that. I mean that was just a visit there. So she let it, and she\ndidn't take, she took a small rent, I forgot what it was any more, it may have been on the\norder of 40 to 50 mark per month, which at that time was nothing. And the garden,\nincidentally, contained a number of marvelous fruit trees, some cherry and also plum\ntrees and even the, and she told us we could use the harvest and the harvest was so rich\nthat in terms of black market money, that was almost more than the 40 or 50 mark that\nwe paid her for the rent. And yeah, okay, so then we, that was agreed upon and then we\ndecided we would move out there as soon as possible, having, you know, we had to settle\ncertain affairs, but I didn't, I was out of our apartment and that was it and everything in\nthere was gone as far as I was concerned. But I had, the only things I had taken, of\ncourse, personal items like clothing along already to the maid's room at Margot's parent's\nhouse so I was all set up to move there. But they had to pack their things yet and that\ntook a few days and then actually on the 30th of January, 1943, we moved out to that, the\nname of the village, incidentally, was Senzig, S-E-N-Z-I-G. And now a completely\ndifferent life started for us. I considered it at the time a real adventure, first of all, I was\nfinally off that continuous pressure that was increasing by the month of whether to be\npicked up and to be deported and I felt for the first time in years, like a free person and I\nalso felt that I somehow I am in control of my life now, which I wasn't before. And\nfurthermore, I mean the threat was lifted and I could do what I wanted to do, not exactly\nactually, but at least in a limited way. Yeah, there were obviously many, many things\nnow to consider. The first item was money. I have to, again, sort of back track a little\nbit. My father had stored away some, what was called black money, in the years before\nhis arrest, because all Jewish assets, even if they were not confiscated, were blocked by\nthe German authority, by basically the German equivalent of the IRS, the Treasury\nDepartment. That meant that these assets still belonged to the particular Jewish owner,\nbut he could not, he or she could not freely dispose of them. Each family had, was given\nby the Gestapo, a maximum amount of money it could spend per month and withdraw\nfrom the bank account. Obviously, that was all in preparation for confiscation. They\nwanted to prevent that Jews stash away money. So and that was based entirely on the\nsize of the family. Like we were four people. So I don't know what the amount was, but\nmy father had a certain amount of money, maximum amount that he could spend. And\nanything that he sold or so on, had to be paid into that blocked account also. But my\nfather did particularly at the time when our big apartment was given up, he sold many\nitems under the hand and established black accounts with a number of friends, basically\nthree. Two of them were former, no, one of them was a former client, that was a very\ninteresting man whom I'll talk about a little bit later. He was a furrier and, in fact, he had\nthe largest, probably the most prominent fur business in Berlin. One of his customers, in\nfact, was none other than Hermann Goring, one of the top Nazis and commander in chief\nof the air force in addition to many other offices that he held. And his name was Walter\nLange and, in fact, he had a Jewish wife and he told us that Goring called him up in the\nsummer of 1939 telling him, if you want to, your wife to be safe, get her out now and I'll\nsee to it that anything that she wants to take out, she can. At that time, an ordinary Jew\nwho emigrated, could take out only very limited amounts of valuables and so on. And he\nshipped his wife out with I know oriental rugs and other valuables to England and they\nhad a son, by the way, and the son also, so they were now in safety in England, safety\nexcept for German air raids, maybe. But, of course, he conducted, kept conducting his\nbusiness. And he, I forgot what the exact amounts of money were, but it was a fairly\nsizeable amount that he kept in a separate account for my father. And my father had told\nhim and also the others that 1f anything happened to him, then I should have access to\nthese assets. The second person was actually the father of the German lawyer whom I\nhad mentioned earlier who had warned my father of his imminent arrest after\nKristallnacht and I think I mentioned at the time, that the father of this lawyer had been a\nMinister of the Interior in one of the pre-Hitler governments of the Weimar Republic.\nThe son, the lawyer himself, who had warned my father, was by that time, of course,\ndrafted and was an officer in the Wehrmacht, but the father was an elderly gentleman and\nhe kept also a sizeable amount of money for my father and also was informed that I\nshould have access to these assets. The third person was my father's former accountant\nand tax advisor. He actually had the smallest amount, but also I think 1t was somewhere\nbetween five and ten thousand Deutsche Reichsmark, which was at that time fairly\nsizeable. The interesting thing is that he was the only one who cheated me of the money.\nObviously, because of the danger for them and for us, no receipts were ever exchanged, I\nmean it was all just by word of honor. And when I came to claim part of the money, he\ntold me with a straight face, and in fact, that was at the time that my father was still in the\ntransit camp, and he told me with a straight face that unfortunately my father did not\nfollow his advice to let him keep the money, but he picked the money up about three or\nfour months ago and he advised my father that was not a good idea, that he should, it\nwould be better for the safety of the money if he would keep the money.\nEnd of side tape three.\nTape 4",
        "Q: This is tape four, side A of an interview with Ernest Fontheim on March 13, 1997.\nThe interviewer is Randy Goldman.",
        "A: Yeah, I, then had my father asked about that, as I explained earlier, my former\nmathematics teacher, Dr. Baer, was an orderly employed in that transit camp and he\nbrought messages back and forth between my father and myself and also every day I\nmade sandwiches for them and he would take them in. And I sent a sort of, obviously,\ncloaked message just saying that the accountant said that he had picked everything up and\nmy father sent a message back, that is definitely not so and he has everything. So I went\nback to the accountant for a second time and told him the message of my father and he\nbecame then at first just unfriendly, but when I kept persisting, he pointed to the\ntelephone and said if I don't leave him alone, you know, he has one phone call to make to\nthe police and then I can explain to them that he owes me money. Well at that point, I\nturned around and left and I guess that's one of these unfortunate experiences. So money\nwas a problem. Another problem was, of course, how to arrange our lives there. We,\nthese plots in these settlements are very close together, you cannot live there literally in\nhiding and avoid people, in fact, that would have aroused suspicion. Neighbors are\ntraditionally, in these settlements, very close, talk to each other and so on, so we decided\nwe, first of all, we have to have a believable story, you know, who we are and so on. So\nwe concocted a whole sort of curriculum vitae for ourselves and the story was, our papers\nincidentally were all made in the last name of Hesse, mine, too, H-E-S-S-E. And the\nstory was that this was a couple with their daughter, Margot, and I was a nephew, in other\nwords, the son of Mr. Hesse's brother. And my parents had been killed in an accident\nwhile I was still a baby and I had been raised by my aunt and uncle and so. They were\nalmost total strangers to me, I just met them a few months before, but I had to train\nmyself to address them in the sort of familiar German Du form and also, instead of\ncalling them Mr. or Mrs. Hesse, I had to call them Uncle Hermann and Aunt Lucy. And\nincidentally, the name Hermann Hesse also was chosen because from the telephone book,\nthat actually Mr. Hesse found that out, there existed a real Hermann Hesse at a Berlin\naddress and that was the address that we gave. So if somebody just made a cursory\ncheck, say with our ID, there existed such a person at the address that we gave. Okay, we\nalso had to have credible stories of what our lives were like. For example in my case, a\nGerman, which I pretended to be, would normally be inducted into the army and, of\ncourse, I was a civilian. Now I, after my ID was taken away by the SS, from the German\nLabor Front, I acquired after a few months another ID as a technician in one of the major\nGerman defense plants in Berlin. And that, of course, was in itself an excellent alibi\nbecause a person of such technical expertise would be deferred from military service.\nHowever, I should also add that the ID requirements were much more rigorous. For\nexample, every male of military age, and I don't remember any more up to what age that\nwas, but surely much more than my age at that time which was 20. Every such person\nhad to have military papers. If the person was actually a member of the Wehrmacht, it\nmeans of any one of the three branches, army, navy or air force, the person had to have a\nMilitarpass, military pass, with picture, identifying the unit, etcetera, etcetera. If the\nperson was exempt from military service for whatever reason, then also a military paper\nwith picture and other personal information, stating that reason, be it deferment for job\nreasons or maybe for health reasons, somebody may have had only one leg, for example,\nthe paper would have to state what the reason was and that also had to be carried on the\nperson and shown on request. In the case of job deferment, in fact that paper was only\nissued for a limited time, I forgot exactly but I believe it was six months. So after, it had\nto be revalidated every six months. That made it very difficult to obtain forgeries. First\nof all, forgeries of military papers were very rare and hard to get in the first place, and\nthen it was only valid for six months; then it had to be revalidated. And as I said, I had\nnow obtained an ID as a technician for a defense plant in Berlin and I, and with that I\nlived for the rest of the war, showing it the many times that I was asked for an ID and in\nfact, it was convincing enough so that there was never a follow-up question, but I was\naware of the fact that each time the official asking me to identify myself could have asked\nwhere is your Wehrmacht ID? And then I had already prepared one fall back and that\nwas that I would pretend to go through the, I would actually go through the pockets of my\njacket and pretend to look for the paper and then with surprise on my face say, ah, I must\nhave left it in the coat that I wore yesterday. And at that point, the official could have\nsaid, well, I believe you this time, but be sure don't forget it again. He could, however\nalso, have told me, in that case I have to take you along to check you out, in which case I\nwould have been done. And in fact, that never occurred and in all of my cases where I\nwas controlled for ID, that ID that I had and the one that I obtained later that I will\ndiscuss then, was sufficient. I think that also had to do with the fact that I had learned by\nliving in Nazi Germany since '33 and by being in that Nazi gymnasium or high school for\ntwo years from '33 to '35, I had learned exactly the correct Nazi demeanor. They were in\nmany ways sort of very naive almost bordering on the childish. For example, whenever I\nwas asked for an ID, before I did anything like showing my ID, I would in this military\ndemeanor click my heels, I had special heels for that with sort of iron or steel plates to\nprovide the impressive military click that German soldiers had, I would stretch out my\nright arm, say a snappy Heil Hitler, and then I would show my, and such silly little things\nwould make just the right impression and would dispel any, in most cases at least, any\nsuspicion that I could be anything but a convinced and truthful Nazi. Yeah, that was my\ncase. Then the case of Mr. Hesse, Margot's father, he was actually by profession a tailor\nand pattern maker and had owned a women's coat factory in earlier years, in the '30's, and\nthen when forced labor came, he was actually drafted into a uniform, military uniform\nfactory and had also, even though he was a Jew, a position of sort of a supervisory\nposition there because of his background and knowledge. So he carried that, continued\nthat and also said that he was in such a factory. In addition to that of course, he had the\nID for the Deutsche Arbeitsfront, which was sort of like a secondary position he\npretended. Margot's mother had an undefined office job in Berlin and Margot herself\nactually was by training a baby nurse and she worked in sort of a German nursery. These\nstarted to spring up now, today they would be called day care centers, because many\nGerman women were not exactly forcibly drafted to work in factories, but they were\nstrongly coerced and urged because there was a tremendous need, obviously, for factory\nworkers because German males were in the army. And because of the fact that many of\nthese women worked, there was a need for day care centers. So Margot pretended to\nwork in one of those. But that alone, to have a job, a credible job wasn't really enough. I\nmean, the thing is that village where we lived was about three to four miles away from\nthe nearest commuter station to Berlin and people either bicycled from the village and\nparked their bicycles then at the railroad station, there were bicycle racks, or they took a\npostal bus that sort of went down the country road which the village was at certain\nschedules, I forgot what it was, but not very frequently, I think once an hour or so. And\nnow I went into Berlin actually twice a week to maintain contact with black market\nsources to obtain food and so I made it a point then always to take the bus and people saw\nme at the bus stop and, of course, I pretended to go to work to my factory. On other days\nwhen I did not go there, since it was also known that I had a bicycle and I would bicycle\naround the neighborhood, I simply sort of spread the word that whenever I had a chance,\nI liked to bicycle, I would take the bicycle to that commuter line station and park it there\nso that people wouldn't wonder why I wasn't there regularly. I forgot what Margot's\nfather's alibi was, he and his wife also went into Berlin twice a week to catch up with\ntheir and keep contact with their black market sources. Margot herself was, number one,\nthe most Jewish looking of the four of us and on top of it, she was at that time always\nextremely nervous and afraid, and so she stayed out there and never went into the city\nand that created somewhat of a problem, but what she had to do was to stay inside the\nhouse, I mean people didn't check up really literally, and she just stayed inside the house\nall day and only appeared outside after, I don't know, five or six when people normally\nwould be home from their jobs. Another very important issue was that of police\nregistration. In Germany at that time, and I believe even today still, every person has to\nbe registered with the police at his or her place of residence and a person can only have\none place of residence. Now, all the people out there who lived in these houses, in these\ncottages, some were as primitive as ours, others may have been a little bit more fancy,\nthey actually had apartments in Berlin where they were registered with the police and\nthey moved out there because just about the time when we went underground, air raids\nincreased tremendously, particularly the American air force which was stationed at air\nfields in, on the British Islands and would regularly attack Berlin. Later on, actually, on a\ndaily basis, in early '43 it wasn't that frequent, but still frequent enough for people to be\nscared. So, therefore, people preferred the safety of some village which surely wouldn't\nbe bombed, to being in Berlin and being trapped in an apartment building. But that, of\ncourse, posed a problem for them because, as I said, by law everybody has to be\nregistered and a person can only be registered at one place with the police. So if these\npeople would have to, so if you, if a person moved there was actually also a\nde-registration form. The person had to de-register at his or her old residence and then\nthe person actually received a copy of the de-registration form to present at the new place\nwhere the person would then register. Well, if the people would have done that, would\nhave de-registered in Berlin, they would immediately have lost their apartments since as a\nresult of the air raids many people lost their apartments and there was practically no new\nbuilding going on because of wartime conditions and all of the raw material and labor\nwere really put into the war effort to build tanks, planes and whatever else was needed.\nSo there was an acute and increasing shortage of apartments, so if somebody moved out\nof his apartment, the first thing was that it would be snapped away by the housing\nauthority and the apartment would be given over to some bombed out family. And of\ncourse, people wanted to maintain their apartments. To make a long story short, the\nresult was that all of these good Germans who lived out there, lived there essentially,\nquote, illegally. They did not register there because they couldn't because they didn't\nwant to de-register and give up their Berlin apartments. The local police which was in\ncharge of that, of course, knew about it and simply looked the other way because it was\nunderstandable, you know, people didn't want to lose their city apartments. And that was\na perfect argument for us because we couldn't register for different reasons, we were\nunderground Jews. But we had that perfect argument, of course we had our apartment in\nBerlin and as I mentioned earlier, the address that we gave, the fictitious, there was\nactually a Hermann Hesse living there, so somebody could check us out in the telephone\nbook and we were there only for fear of the air raids. So actually I always felt that was\nthe first time in my life that the Americans came and helped me. So, alright, that was,\nyeah, and then what we did in the beginning was, we had several sessions in that little\ncottage where we interrogated ourselves on all of these issues, you know, I mean who I\nwas, I was a nephew and that my parents had died while I was still a baby and I was\nraised by my aunt and uncle and where I worked and where they worked and so that\nbecame part of our nature, we constantly asked ourselves these questions so that nobody\nwould ever make a slip-up or give some wrong answer or even an answer contradicting\nsomebody or somebody else who said something. And, alright, I should say also by the\nway, the date that we moved out there, I mentioned earlier was the 30th of January, 1943,\nwas an extremely interesting date. First of all, it was the 10th anniversary of Hitler's\nassumption of power, that he was named Reich Chancellor, and secondly and more\nimportant for us, it was the day on which Field Marshall Paulus, commander of German\nSixth Army in the Ukraine, surrendered his army in the city of Stalingrad. The huge\nbattle of Stalingrad which had raged from October through January, that means four\nmonths, the Germans had lost and it was the first major military loss for the Germans.\nAnd that made us unbelievably ecstatic. In fact, we decided that after that loss the war\ncan't last longer than next summer, meaning the summer of '43. I think it was that\noptimism that made us keep going. We would have, if we would have known it would\nlast another over two years, I don't know whether, what we would have, I guess we had\nno other choice anyway, but it kept our spirits up. Yeah, then the food situation. As I\nhad mentioned earlier also, food was rationed, the ration coupons were given out to\npeople who were registered with the police, see, the food rationing offices had actually a\nduplicate of the police registration file. So obviously, since we were not registered with\nthe police, we couldn't get food ration cards and therefore, we had to buy all of our food\non the black market. The black market does not mean that there was actually a market\nsomewhere where people traded. I mean that would have been immediately, been\nexploded by the Gestapo. Black market simply means that people were trading in\nrationed food, but without ration coupons. Who were these people? Well, they were all\nkinds of people. First of all, fellow underground Jews, you know for example, somebody\nmight have had a terrific source for baked goods and breads but nothing else, but that\nperson would then trade in breads and sell them at a profit for him and use that maybe to\nbuy a sausage from somebody else who had that source. And so there was, we knew of\nquite a circle of underground Jews and so that was also a source for black market food.\nThen various sympathetic gentiles, I had for example, a house maid of my maternal\ngrandparents, in fact my maternal grandmother died, fortunately a natural death, only a\nfew months before the deportations started. And her last maid, she had been with my\ngrandmother for many years and she was a very faithful family friend and she was the\nlast one who could afford even to buy black market food, but she was a very modest and\nsimple person and she claimed she didn't even need all the food that she was getting on\nher ration cards. So I went there, one of the stops that I did on my Berlin visits was her\nlittle apartment and she always had some food, first of all she always fed me a warm meal\nand then she also gave me something that she had saved from her rations. Then there was\nthe butcher of the Hesse family, near where they lived. Now, they were very decent\npeople, very strongly anti-Nazi and when they told them that they were going\nunderground, they immediately promised to supply them as much as they could with\nmeats. But the problem was they couldn't really go there because they were known in the\nneighborhood, they lived around the corner there from that butcher and everybody knew\nthem. If they would appear there without a star, somebody would surely denounce them.\nSo before we actually went underground, I was introduced to them and as I had\nmentioned earlier, we had lived, our family lived in a totally different part of Berlin. So\nnot a soul knew me there. So I was introduced, and there was also a ruse agreed upon\nhow I would go about getting food from her. But people were very jealous in those days\nand so I would come into the store and say to her that my mother was in here this\nmorning and left an order for sausage and meat and gave you already the food stamps and\nshe would say yes, that's right, I have your order ready. Then she would go in the back\nand pack us whatever she felt like up and charged me just the regular amount of money\nfor these items, which were all under price control. She could have, I should have said\nearlier, on the black market roughly the price of food was 10 times the regular price\ncontrol price, it varied a little bit, 1t also depend on what kind of food, but that was a good\naverage. And she could have made a lot of money with that, instead she sold it to me\nexactly at the price that was under price control and that was also purely, I mean, out of\nsupport. And then another important item, incidentally, which people never think about,\nis shoe repair. Not only were shoes rationed, but shoe repair was rationed. In other\nwords, if you needed a new sole, there was a ration coupon that you had to hand in for a\nsole for a shoe and we didn't have that. Well, here our old shoemaker from our area had\nagreed to support us and the thing was, he was actually a secret communist and, of\ncourse, he was not active in the underground communist party, but he had been a\ncommunist earlier and maintained his sympathies. And his shoe shop was not as close to\nour old apartment as that butcher was to the Hesse's apartment, so I could go there\nwithout fearing to run into anybody. So we had all our shoe repairs and that was, in the\nlong run, that was as much a life saver as food. What are you going to do if your shoes\nfall apart, you can't get new shoes, you can't repair them, that basically condemns you to\nstay at home, so we solved that problem with him. And then we had various other, I\nmean there was a whole bunch of people who we relied on to obtain food and for the\nmoney, as I said, we paid, I used the money gradually that I obtained from the assets of\nmy father that I talked about earlier.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a question here. Was there any difficulty in figuring out which\npeople you could trust or not trust?",
        "A: No, I mean the difficulty might have been in somebody whom [ ran across sort of\nunexpectedly somewhere, but the people that we had sort of contact with, we knew we\ncould trust.",
        "Q: What about people you ran across, like old family friends?",
        "A: Yeah, I mean, Berlin was a city at that time still close to five million people, in a\nsense even though New York is much bigger, it 1s also similar in the sense that you don't\nrun into people. Yeah, and of course, one thing, we had to be very careful where we\nwent. I mean, I never went into our old neighborhood and they never went into theirs.\nAnd also then there were certain areas, I'll discuss that a little bit later, where sort of Jews\nwere sort of quote, known to be often and we tried to avoid these areas also. But there is\na possibility, I mean there was a possibility and you didn't trust anyone at all.",
        "Q: What about in this village where you were living?",
        "A: Yeah, okay, in the village, okay, that was a, I sort of said already how we concocted\nour story there and we decided from the beginning then to just act like normal neighbors\nand anything else would have been impossible anyway. So we actually started a whole\nsocial life there, we met people and, you know, invited each other, we were invited, we\ninvited people for, I don't know, a game of cards or whatever. The most interesting\nperson actually we met, was the local Nazi party chieftain for that village. He, I mean\nMargot's father, was a very good accordion player and he played often and I guess in\nthose cottages the walls are thin anyway, somehow that became known that he plays the\naccordion and that Nazi, his name was Harry Gladenik, a very nice charming fellow, you\nknow. In spite of the fact that he was a rabid Nazi. He came over and said he heard that\nhere someone plays the accordion and he loves accordion music and they have actually\nevery Saturday evening, a party at his house with dancing and so on and why don't we\ncome over sort of sometime and participate in that. So we were frequent guests then at\nthe home of that Nazi, dancing with some of the women there and what was for me most\nimportant, more important than the dancing at least, was the food. They had what\nseemed to me limitless supplies of food there, I don't know what their sources were, but\npart of the source, in fact, was the sister of Harry Gladenik, that Nazi. She lived with\nthem, but her husband who was also a real professional Nazi ideologue, was an official in\nthe German occupation of the Soviet Union and had his ways of obtaining meat and\nsausages and all kinds of other goodies that were, even for good Germans, hard to get in\nGermany. And he sent regular packages and so that was all served there and we always\nenjoyed going there and had a wonderful time with these people.",
        "Q: And when you went to these parties you felt comfortable?",
        "A: Yeah, totally, I totally sort of divorced myself from my real self and chatted with\nthem and later on I think I felt sort of elation that, you know, that I was able to put up\nsuch a front and, I mean this whole, in the beginning I changed, in the later part of the\nwar. In the beginning this whole life of deception sort of had some tremendous attraction\nfor me, now it sounds almost childish, but I felt somewhat like a secret agent in enemy\nterritory, trying to pretend something that wasn't the case and fooling all of the enemies.",
        "Q: But there certainly is an element of risk there. Yes?",
        "A: What element of risk was there anyway? I mean, but I mean after having lived by\nthat time, a year and a half before we went underground with the threat of deportation,\nwhich was a constant risk and something that was out of my control even. I felt like a\nfree person there.",
        "Q: Did anybody there know of your situation other than the person whose house it was?",
        "A: No. Yeah, and she wasn't really known too well. She had just bought it a year before\nand was a few times, so yeah, she obviously knew us, but no, nobody else knew us.",
        "Q: During this period, were you in contact with other Jewish people who had gone\nunderground?",
        "A: Yeah, right. There was one fellow actually, he was an interesting fellow,\nunfortunately I lost contact with him after the war, his name was Heinz Jacobius. He was\nthe most versatile person, underground Jew, that I encountered. He lived in the middle of\nthe city with an Aryan girlfriend and of course, he also was not registered and in the city\nit was even more complicated than in the country where we were because the janitors of\nbuildings sort of had, they were legally obligated to see to it that every tenant was\nregistered with the police. In fact, he had to countersign the registration form that one\nhad to fill out. And if somebody, you know, regularly comes by, the janitor is supposed\nto watch out so they were somewhat like spies also, they're supposed to notice that and\nreport that person. But that Heinz Jacobius, he was a tremendous black market artist and\nhe just fed that janitor so well that he surely had no interest in killing the goose that laid\nhis golden eggs. Yeah, and actually he was, and then his house was hit by incendiary\nbombs during an air raid. And, of course, that scared him because if that house would\nhave burned down, then you know, that would have sort of destroyed the whole\narrangement. And during wartime, incidentally, the fire department, and that was made\nknown also, did never, never did anything to protect or put out fires in ordinary apartment\nhouses because they were needed for more important objects, you know, either\ngovernment or military installations and so on and so the whole population had been\ntrained in extinguishing fires. And he apparently distinguished himself, went out of his\nway in I don't know, whatever he did, that anyway, the local party organization gave him\na special sort of order of merit that people got for going out of their way and beyond the\ncall of duty in putting out the fire, which they did.",
        "Q: The reason I asked you about your knowledge of other Jews who had gone\nunderground is, I was wondering whether there was any sort of informal network for\ninformation purposes, for any sort of political or sabotage purposes or anything else.",
        "A: No. I mean, there was what you might call an informal network. I knew some and\nthen others knew some others, but it had nothing to do, in other words, with any attempt\neven at sabotage. We were totally devoted to only surviving and not being caught. I\nmean sabotage would have endangered us even more.",
        "Q: But what about access to information?",
        "A: Yeah, well that's what that served, but on the other hand, you had to be very careful if\nyou, I'm coming to something that I haven't mentioned yet, but the Gestapo employed a\nnumber of Jewish spies and if you met a Jew whom you had not seen sort of on a more or\nless continuous basis, you didn't know whether that person was legitimately underground,\nlike I was, or whether that was a spy working for the Gestapo and ready to hand me over.\nSo, for that reason, one, the unwritten law was, first of all you did not disclose to anyone\nwhere you lived. And secondly, if you met somebody, say just on the street, from earlier\ntimes, you would try to avoid that person.\nEnd of side one of tape four.",
        "Q: This is tape four, side B of an interview with Ernest Fontheim. It is March 13, 1997.\nThe interviewer is Randy Goldman.",
        "A: Another important aspect of our stay there was the total change in lifestyle. I mean, I\nwas even in the apartment where we were forced into in the Jewish house. It was still,\nyou know, we had running water, we had running toilet, water toilets, even running hot\nwater, central heating and all these amenities. And suddenly from one day to the next,\ntransformed, transferred into that primitive cottage, was a tremendous, I don't know if\nculture shock as far as the wrong word, sort of a living style shock would be probably\nbetter. We had to, as I said, get our water from a pump outside and we learned that if it\nfreezes, then the pump freezes and you had to do all kinds of shenanigans to unfreeze the\npump, like pouring hot water through a priming hole. We had, of course obviously, no\nwater toilet, but an outhouse which was very primitive and in winter very cold. And, as I\nalso said, there was of course no electricity. We had, for a lot of money we had to buy\npetroleum on the black market to run the one petroleum lamp and also had candles for\nwhich we had to pay a lot of money. And so it was a total change in lifestyle and I found\nthat at the time, very romantic and felt that living in a big city apartment house with\nrunning water and central heating made us only degenerate and now at least these\nhorrible times had one advantage, they make us sort of return to nature and so that we\nreally appreciate what is heat. Heat 1s not just some pipes that radiate heat, but in our\ncase, wood had to be cut with an ax and was hard work and that's how you create your\nheat. And water had to be obtained from a pump and sometimes you had to unfreeze it\nand I remember at that time I was very romantic about all of this and thought that was a\ngreat thing that was happening to me that I was returning to nature in some form. Okay,\nyeah, I had mentioned earlier also, these so-called black accounts that my father had with\nvarious people. Now it turned out that the black market prices were continuously\nincreasing, there was an inflation even in the black market and so I was aware of the fact,\nyou know, a fixed sum of money sort of would shrink in purchasing power over the years\nand I wanted to avoid that. So, the money which I had with that former client furrier,\nclient of my father, I decided to invest in something that would keep its value at least for,\nor would increase with inflation, thereby keeping its purchasing power. And through a\nfriend I had the opportunity to buy a women's sort of evening handbag made out of sort\nof high carat gold and platinum, little elements sort of like in a chain. And for that\nhandbag I paid twelve thousand Reichsmark and then I gave it back to the furrier because\nI didn't want to have it for fear, you know, something happens and so he kept it. But he\nalso offered me to do some work on his estate. He had a fantastic estate outside of\nBerlin, east of Berlin in a very fancy area with big mansions and he said he needed\nanyway some workers and if I came, he would feed me for that day and pay me also and\nin addition, he also dealt on a large scale in black market, there would be always some\nthings that he could give me along. So once a week, I went out to his estate. Now on that\nestate, he had actually three workers already. One was a Polish couple, they were real\npeasants and in fact he detailed me sort of to that Polish guy and he told me what to do.\nAnd his wife was I think sort of a cleaning woman in his house. And then he had a single\nPolish girl, a young woman, her name was Maria and she was the cook and also sort of\nhomemaker. And incidentally, I have to add that he had all these workers was only a\nresult of his connections. As I said earlier, he supplied Goring with furs, because\naccording to the law at that time, forced foreign laborers could be used only in either\nagriculture or defense plants. And agriculture meant not for the people, you know,\npeople for their own back yards as he did, but agriculture in the sense these were\nsuppliers of food for the population. So he was legally not entitled to them but had them\nanyway. But I mean the German, the system under the Nazis was shot through with\ncorruption and anyone could get anything he wanted. I mean, incidentally, the film\nSchindler's List 1s an excellent example how Schindler, even in Auschwitz with a number\nof diamonds, gets his workers out of the concentration camp again. So I went, as I said, I\nwent there once a week and worked under the supervision of that Polish peasant and that\npeasant, he talked German haltingly but fairly well, and he was obsessed because he was\na great Polish patriot and he was obsessed with, I mean with the terrible fate of Poland.\nAnd in his theory, the cause for the terrible fate of Poland, it had two causes. One was\nthe communists or the Soviets and the other one was the Jews. The Germans, for some\nreason, never occurred to him, even though they were the ones to attack Poland. And so I\nhad to listen to his antisemitic tirades and sort of appear to agree with him. And another\naspect, there was that Maria, the maid, every time when I was ready to leave, she called\nme to her room to give me some food and also something to eat right there and something\nto take along. And I was convinced that she must sort of be secretly in love with me, but\nI didn't want to have anything to do with her, I mean for many reasons. First of all, I\nwasn't attracted to her and secondly, I felt any involvement of that kind can only be\ndangerous. - One of the other underground friends, we had a whole circle of people who\nwere underground, not a circle in the sense that we actually lived together, but we kept in\ntouch with each other, and one of them was a fellow from my high school graduating\nclass. His name was Gerd Cohn. He lived also with a non-Jewish girlfriend and he had\nall kinds of contacts also for black market foods and necessities. And one day he told me\nthat he met a group of foreign forced laborers who were a tremendous source of black\nmarket food. And in fact, there was a plan somewhere to illegally slaughter a pig and sell\nit off right away. And he asked me, he had to, he was going there, he had to commit\nhimself, however, to a given amount of pounds of meat and I discussed it at home and I\ngave him a certain order, I forgot what it was, X number of pounds and, incidentally, the\nlistener will from that, I guess, gather that I don't eat kosher which is true. I never did eat\nkosher and actually I always enjoyed ham, but at that point we didn't even have the\nluxury of being very choosy. Anyway to make a long story short, on the day, on the\nappointed day when I was supposed to come to pick up the meat, his girlfriend was in\nhysterics. He didn't come back, and the next day he didn't come back either. And of\ncourse, there was no way, where do you go to find out? Now, this under, other\nunderground Jewish friend of mine whom I had mentioned earlier, Heinz Jacobius, who\nyou know also did all kinds of things in the underground, he even, he had some sort of a\nline, I didn't know what it was, to the Gestapo where he could find out things and I asked\nhim to make some inquiries whether this Gerd Cohn ever appeared. The thing is here, all\nJews who were arrested for deportation ultimately wound up in the transit camp. And he\nmade those inquiries and there was no Gerd Cohn ever appeared there. So it was clear\nthat he must have been the victim of a crime and there was actually a German newspaper\narticle that, about two weeks later or so, that a torso with the head missing and the hands\nmissing and these would be the identifiers, the hands, because of fingerprints and\nobviously the head because of the facial features, was found floating in the river. Oh\nyeah, and it was, the article mentioned a certain scar, I forgot from some operation, and\nfriends of his knew that he had such a scar. So apparently, he must have had some\nhorrible fate and the suspicion was that these foreign laborers, apparently you know, he\nhad first of all, a large amount of money with him to purchase that large amount of meat\nthat he had ordered, and in addition to that, he had some excellent forged ID which could\nalways be re-forged into a different name or a different picture, and maybe other things\nthat were of value to those guys, so the opinion among people who knew him and the\ncircumstances was that he was, that this was a trap, there never was a pig and that he was\nmurdered. That he was lured into that trap and lost his life that way, a horrible fate.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. Since you have mentioned a few minutes ago that most\npeople who were arrested went initially to the transit camp.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were there random crimes or murders by the SS or against Jews, or was it all done\nvery, in an organized fashion for deportation?",
        "A: No, actually, no that's a good question. The Germans somehow abhor sort of random\nviolence. In fact the Kristallnacht even, which was a case of random violence, was\ncriticized within the Nazi circles very much and in fact actually, at a ministerial meeting,\na cabinet meeting two days afterwards, Goring severely criticized, I think Goebbels was\nmainly behind that, because of all the destruction. It turned out that the kind of glass that\nis used for shop windows was, at that time was a glass that was not even made in\nGermany, they had to buy it in Belgium, that means they had to use foreign exchange and\nthen Goring turned to Goebbels and said, you could have, it would have been better if\nyou would have killed a few more hundred Jews rather than cause all of that destruction\nwhich now we have to, you know, so they are, anyway to come back specifically to your\nquestion, that process was very orderly. The Jew was arrested, he was put into that camp\nuntil enough people were together to put together a transport and then they were shipped\noff. I mean, they may have been beaten up maybe in some sadistic urge by some SS\nmen, but...",
        "Q: But this isn't like in camps or in ghettos where if you said something wrong you could\nhave been shot? This didn't really happen in Berlin?",
        "A: No. I mean, if you did something wrong, yeah, I mean, they had a bunker there\nwhich was a sort of a nickname for a part of the basement, I think it was only four feet\nhigh and only a few square feet, people were put in as punishment. Particularly if there\nwere escape attempts, that sort of thing. But they were not shot sort of randomly like you\nsaw in the film Schindler's List, that was not, they were always shipped for orderly\nkilling. Let me see, yeah, I had mentioned already that if one met some Jewish person in\nthe underground whom one hadn't seen for a long time, the initial reaction was always to\nbe suspicious. I'm coming now probably to the saddest chapter of the underground, and\nthese are the Jewish catchers or spies. The Gestapo kept a sort of a small herd of them\nand they operated also out of the transit camp. Incidentally, the transit camp had shifted\nin the meantime. It was no longer in the old age home, I think the old age home was then\nused for other governmental purposes. The transit camp was shifted to the Jewish\nhospital of Berlin, which was then the last place, I mean sort of Jewish owned building in\nthe city. And a part of, one wing of the hospital was turned over to the Gestapo to\nmaintain the transit camp. And the spies also had their rooms in that transit camp and\nthey lived there, but they could come and go as they wanted, of course, and more\nimportantly, they obviously didn't wear the yellow star as they normally would have had\nto. And their task was to track down Jews, other Jews who were underground. And the\nsad story 1s that first of all, they were incredibly more effective than the Gestapo because\nthe Gestapo basically in tracking down a Jew, was sort of like a blind person trying to\nfind something, they had really nothing to go by. While the spies, all of them had\nthemselves been underground and had then been caught and they knew many of the tricks\nand trades of underground Jews. They knew where to go to and so on and they had a\nmuch better nose, plus many of them, of course, knew other underground Jews anyway\nand would just give those names to the Gestapo. Now the most notorious of these was a\nwoman, her maiden name was Stella Goldschlag, and unfortunately, I knew her fairly\nwell. She worked part of the time that I was at Siemens, she also worked for Siemens.\nAt that time, she was married to a man whose last name was Kubler, so then her name\nwas Stella Kiibler. Stella was a strikingly beautiful woman, she was tall, slender, had\nlong golden blond locks, wavy hair and blue eyes and a very pretty face. She, at Siemens\nalso, she was sort of the center of attention. I came to know her, even though she was not\nin my department but in a different one, in fact she was in the same department where\nsome members of the Baum group, this underground Jewish communist group, were\nworking that I had mentioned earlier. But, in my class in the orthodox school that I went\nto in the '30's was a boy named Klaus Goldschlag, in fact I remembered him very well, he\nwas the top student in our class. And I know he left and emigrated to Canada. And\nGoldschlag is not exactly a common name, so when I met her first, I asked her whether\nshe is related to him and then she said, yeah, that's her cousin, and so we talked several\ntimes about him and then also sometimes about other things. But otherwise, I had not\nmuch in common with her, I don't think she had any, to my knowledge, any intellectual\ninterests or music interests and the circles that I sort of circulated in, she surely did not\nbelong to. But, through the mouth radio, sometime in the, maybe mid-'43, I heard that\nshe is working for the Gestapo as a catcher and that really scared me. And in fact, I know\nthat at one point, I almost encountered her. What happened was the following thing.\nEven in walking around in Berlin, I developed various strategies to avoid being\nrecognized and one was, in a big city of course, there 1s a lot of pedestrian traffic, you\nknow, people walking this way, people walking that way, and when I walked down a\nstreet, I would look at the faces of the people, not who would just be in front of me, but\nthree or four people down behind them, so that I would, could possibly recognize others\nbefore I was recognized by them. That was one, the other strategy was that I always had\na handkerchief at hand and if some real emergency arose, I would pretend to have to\nblow my nose, but in such a way that I covered most of my face with my handkerchief\nand wouldn't be recognizable that way. So one day I was walking down a street, I even\nremember the name, Pfalzburger Strasse, and I saw, again looking back several people\nbeyond the one that immediately faced me and I saw what seemed to be Stella. I couldn't\n100% identify her, but I, obviously I didn't want to take a chance, you know, to get closer\nto her. I immediately decided turning around and running away would be the worst thing\nto do and I was lucky, just at that point where I recognized her, I passed a store, so I just\nwent into the store pretending, I remember it was a green grocer, so he had potatoes,\nvegetables, things like that. And I turned my back to the window and pretending to look\nat various items in the store. For awhile the saleswoman or probably the owner, already\nasked me what I wanted and I said, well, I just want to see what you have and so on and\nthen after quite a while, after she must have long passed, I sort of excused myself and\nlooked out and she was gone. I mean, there has been a book written about her and she\nhas really caused the death of many people. Now, she was after the war then tried in a\nGerman court, well first she was tried by the Russians who everybody hoped would just\nfinish her off, instead they gave her just a 10-year sentence from '46 to '56. Then she\nreappeared and then there was an unbelievable clamor that for her to be put away. And\nthen the Germans meticulously said, well, a person cannot be tried for the same crime\ntwice, but there were in the meantime, many other arrests that she made which had not\nbeen covered by the Soviet trial and so she was then tried for those cases and then she\nwas found guilty and the judge gave her another 10 years, but applying the 10 years that\nshe already served under the Soviets, she was immediately set free. And it is known that\nshe lives now under an assumed name somewhere in West Germany. That is something,\nthat is some of the worst, she should have been done away with, preferably hanged\nimmediately after the war. Supposedly after some research that other people did, she is\nguilty of hundreds of lives that she gave over to the Gestapo.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a few questions here. Were you, do you think that while you were\nworking together at Siemens that she was involved in this kind of activity?",
        "A: No, not at all.",
        "Q: It was later?",
        "A: It was later, yeah.",
        "Q: What sorts of stories did you hear at the time about what she was doing? What kinds\nof things was she doing?",
        "A: Well, I mean, what she was doing was to walk around Berlin and she knew where\nJews were likely to go and, for example, it became known that a very safe place was, of\nall places, the Berlin State Opera. And the Gestapo would never bother with that and\nmost Jews, they were music lovers, so you could have a pleasant evening even, listening\nto good music and be safe. The problem was that Stella knew that, too. So she appeared\nthere one day and arrested a whole family of, a sort of middle aged couple and a teenage\nson or something. You know, that was exactly the, and she would pull, she had a small\nrevolver that she would pull on people if they didn't exactly, and then one person tried to\nrun away and she shouted, stop him, it's a Jew, and there were some men that grabbed\nthat person.",
        "Q: You knew her a little bit, what motivated her to do such evil things? What was it\nabout her, what was she like?",
        "A: What was about her was self preservation, I mean that's how she survived the war, I\nmean by having others killed. Now, she claimed after the war also that she did it mainly\nto protect her parents. Yeah, well, she had a bargain initially with the Gestapo and SS\nofficial who commanded that transit camp. And the bargain was that her parents could\nstay also, they got a room there and they could stay there with her, she was an only child.\nAnd then at some point, I forgot when that was, I think late '43 or maybe early '44, the\nGestapo told her that they can't protect the parents any longer and then she managed to\nhave them transported to Theresienstadt, that was the only, instead of to Auschwitz, but\nthey were then transferred later to Auschwitz. I mean, the parents are sort of a tragic\nthing, they can't be blamed for what the daughter did, but she maintained her own life\nthat way by killing others. Now, there were many other people, a good friend of mine,\nIsmar Reich, who was underground and was caught. And he was immediately offered\nfreedom if he could name some others and he simply refused. And he said he wasn't\neven beaten, I mean he refused, fine, you don't want to, fine, you go to Auschwitz. Now,\nhe was a very clever resourceful guy. He was with some friends there and somehow they\nsucceeded in smuggling some tools with them and then while the train rolled, they started\nto saw, you know, they, these freight trains are basically wooden siding, they sawed some\nplanks off and when the train slowed down somewhere they jumped out and saved\nthemselves that way.",
        "Q: Were there a great number of these catchers?",
        "A: I mean, too many probably. I don't know how many, but maybe 10, 15 or so.",
        "Q: But you knew of others?",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah, there were others, too. Maybe this is a point where I might indicate\nan incident that we had. We decided that in the long run it may not be safe if we stay just\nat that one point all the time. So we decided we ought to look for a sort of substitute\nplace in case we have to leave. So I contacted, I'm not sure whether I mentioned that, or\nmaybe I did, my father's, one of his clients were members of the Hohenzollern family, it\nwas actually the sister-in-law of the last German Kaiser and her son and they had an\nestate sort of half way Berlin, between Berlin and Potsdam, a suburb which used to be the\nsummer residence of Prussian kings. And she was, they were very good friends of our\nfamily and we made an appointment and Margot, her mother and I went there and\ndiscussed and I knew, apparently, something that she had separate servants quarters\nsomewhere and I discussed with her, you know, the possibility whether there might be\nsome place for us to spend maybe not long periods, but maybe a week or so at a time.\nAnd it was somewhat inconclusive and so on, I mean she also had to be careful,\nobviously, so on the way back from there, that estate was off a sort of a country road\nconnecting Berlin and Potsdam and where a bus only came, I don't know, once every\nhour, if that much. And we decided, we knew when the bus was coming and that maybe\nthere was another half hour left or so and there was a little country inn and we did have\nalso illegally obtained ration coupons, so why don't we go in and maybe have a piece of\ncake and a cup of coffee and talk there. So we went in and Margot's mother immediately,\nthere was a revolving door I remember, you know you go through the revolving door and\nthen you walk in. She instead of walking in, right away revolved back out and, you\nknow, that immediately rang a bell. So I didn't ask any questions and Margot not either.\nWe immediately revolved out and then the mother said that there was a couple sitting that\nshe knew, they are Jews, she don't know, she doesn't know, you know, what their\nbackground, who they are, but one has to be careful. So we walked out and then walked\nalong and decided maybe to walk to the next bus stop in order not to wait right in front\nthere. And as we walked, and we walked fairly briskly, we heard sort of footsteps\ncoming from behind, closing in, and it was the man. And he said, he saw us come in and\nhe had the impression maybe we were afraid of him, but there was no reason, we\nshouldn't be afraid, he is himself in hiding and we should just feel free to come in. That\nof course, was a giveaway already. No Jew at that time would have told somebody else\nwhom he hadn't known, like he didn't even know me, you know, that he was in hiding.\nHe should have been mistrustful of me as I would have been of him. Anyway, he sort of\nimplored us to come back and we just refused and as an excuse we gave that we\ndiscovered that we are actually late, we have to get back to Berlin to meet somebody or\nsome excuse like that and we were walking to the next bus stop. Yeah, and the man then\ngave up and returned to the restaurant where there was actually the previous bus stop was\nthere and we were hurrying up because it was already getting the time for the bus to come\nand we were still some distance away from the next bus stop when we saw the bus\ncoming and so we sort of speeded up but never made it. But as the bus passed us, in\nthose days busses were not closed, where you entered it was sort of open and there was\nan open platform at the back. And as the bus passed us, we saw that man standing in that\nbus. So then it was obvious that he was trying to follow us and was trying to take the\nsame bus with us. So we were glad we didn't make it to the next stop, instead after the\nbus had cleared there, we walked off the, this country road and there was a forest. Now, I\nhad the basic map of Berlin fairly well in my head, we didn't have a map along because it\ndidn't occur to us that we needed one. But I knew that in the direction if we walked, that\nwas walking east from there, just through forests, I mean it may have been several miles,\nwe would come to a suburban sort of commuter line where we could catch a train because\nwe were sure that if we would take the next bus, he would have alerted police at the next\nsuburban station for that line which was actually Wannsee. And so that's what we did.\nWe walked for hours through the forest roughly sort of keeping in the direction until we\ncame to that suburban line which was a totally different line and there we boarded the\ntrain and got back. But such incidents, I mean of that kind, happened fairly frequently.\nAnother incident that just occurred to me now, was, for heating our stove of course, we\nbought firewood which was expensive and even some coal and in addition to that, I went\nand collected sort of dead wood branches from the forest around that village there. And\nfor that, even for that one needed a official permission of the Forestry Department. I still\nhave that, it's sort of almost like a joke, it permits the bearer, Gunther Hesse, that was my\nname then, to collect dead branches that are lying on the floor. But of course, I didn't\nconfine myself to dead branches, I often just broke off live branches and even small trees\nand we would then sort of hack them into pieces and let them dry out before using them\nin our oven. The problem was that I was once observed by the forester and but he didn't\nstop me, I never saw him even and he didn't stop me and so I didn't know that I was\nobserved. But one of the settlers in our settlement was a good friend of his and he, and\nthe forester told him that he noticed that I was violating the law and taking live branches\nand he would have to report me. Now basically, that was probably a, you know, a kind of\noffense was a little fine, but the problem was if it was reported, I didn't exist legally and\nthat would have immediately endangered our existence there. So, but we had a\ntremendous source for cigarettes. Cigarettes were of course rationed. Margot's father was\na chain smoker and so he spent a lot of his money on cigarettes and he went to that other\nsettler and told him again a lie story, I mean the story was that if I got fined for that, then\nmy military exemption will immediately be taken away from me and I will be shipped to\nthe eastern front and by that time the eastern front was by everyone considered sort of\nlike a death sentence and people had sort of understanding for that. And if he can do\nsomething about it, you know, we will supply the necessary cartons of cigarettes and the\nforester had a certain price, I forgot what it was, several cartons, and of course, the guy\nhad to get his cut, too. And in this way we avoided that I was, you know, cited for that\noffense of taking live branches. Then another incident occurred once in splitting wood\nwith our ax. We didn't really have a proper base for splitting wood, but just sort of a\nrelatively soft wood stump and once when I sort of apparently hit the wood that I wanted\nto split particularly hard, I split not only the wood but also the stump and the ax went\nright into my foot at my ankle. And there was a really big open wound which obviously,\nfirst of all, needed to be sewn up and secondly also, probably my bone would have to be\nx-rayed in case the bone was damaged. So one of the neighbors who had a car drove me\nto the nearest hospital and then there was, of course, first we are afraid if they say I have\nto stay overnight then again, there was a need for identification and so on, so I was\nx-rayed and fortunately, they discovered that the bone wasn't damaged.\nEnd of tape four.\nTape 5",
        "Q: This is tape number five, side A of an interview with Ernest Fontheim on March 13,\n1997, the interviewer is Randy Goldman.",
        "A: So all that needed to be done was to sew up the wound and send me home, I thought.\nBut Margot's father was with me, we were in a sort of a holding area and a nurse\napproached with a needle and he knew something, I mean Margot's father, that I wasn't\naware of, namely that after such an injury one needs a tetanus shot. And the tetanus shot\nis given into a person's rear end and so he knew immediately they would ask me to lower\nmy pants and that would surely have been a 100% give-away to anyone in Germany who\nI really was, once they would have discovered my circumcision. So he had a quick\npresence of mind and I was lying on a stretcher and he turned me around on my belly and\nthen pulled my pants off before the nurse could get to me so I got the shot into my rear\nend and nobody saw anything else of me. And then I was sewn up and since hospitals\nanyway were short of beds, obviously because of the large demands for wounded\nsoldiers, they were glad that I didn't have to stay and we were glad that I didn't have to\nstay for different reasons. I also want to mention a cousin of mine, he was actually the\nson of the couple where we stayed in that apartment in the Jew house. He was several\nyears older than I, he was by that time, I would guess, in his mid or late 30's, I was just 20\nor 21 then, and he lived with his girlfriend, Bella Ritter. His name was Albert Marck.\nAnd Bella Ritter's husband had already been arrested and had been for years in a\nconcentration camp and she lived now with my cousin and they decided to go\nunderground in Bavaria and he told me that before they left, that he considered Berlin too\ndangerous. Of course he had lived there much longer also as an adult, and they had\nfigured out a way, apparently, that they thought was foolproof. And that was that he had\nsome medical sort of statements from doctors that he was suffering from some lung\ndisease which required his recuperation in the country. And then he had some ID, I\nguess, on the name that matched it and so did his woman friend. And we decided we\nwanted to keep in touch, of course, and that was a big problem because he was planning\nsort of to move around from different sanatoriums, and I didn't want to give anyone my\naddress. So the solution was that is something that can be done in Germany, I don't know\nwhether that exists here, you can address a letter to somebody under a code name at\ngeneral delivery at a given post office. I still remember my code was the letter F like in\nFontheim, 58, F58 and at a particular post office in Berlin. I mean that was also a risky\nthing because if somehow he had been found by the Gestapo with such a letter, they\ncould have waited for me there, but I guess one did all kinds of stupid things. So\nanyway, we corresponded in that way and then one day the correspondence stopped and\nthen I got a letter from Bella, his friend, that something happened to him and he is very\nsick and she is returning to Berlin alone. So that immediately told me that he was\narrested. It was a big tragedy actually because what happened she told, we met in Berlin\nand she told me that he, apparently there were some questions raised at the place where\nthey were staying, but they were still able to get away, but they left all of their assets, I\nmean that they had to carry with them always, certain valuables, I don't know what they\nwere, but what they needed to sustain their life. And he said he had to go back quickly to\nretrieve these things and she had warned him and tried to keep him from doing it. His\npoint was that without the assets, how can they even continue living and she felt\nsomehow they will make it. Anyway, the result was that he went back and never\nreturned. So obviously he walked into a trap there. So she was now alone in Berlin. We\nkept in touch. We saw each other periodically and when the time came that, she\nmentioned to me several times that she had a very good friend who is a jeweler and I\nneeded some money from that furrier where I had converted all of the money into that\nladies evening handbag and so I wanted to sell it. And she said that man gives very good\nprices and so on. Anyway my first intent was not even to sell it immediately, but just to\nget it appraised. So I gave the handbag to her and we were then agreed to meet the next\nday and she would bring the handbag back and the appraisal price from her jeweler\nfriend. Well, guess what, she never appeared there. I couldn't believe that she would\ncheat me out of that handbag, I mean that was just incredible. And as I found out shortly\nthereafter, she didn't. The problem was Stella Goldschlag. It turned out that Stella\nactually transferred from Siemens where she worked and where I had met her to a\ndifferent factory for some reason and at that factory Bella had worked, so they knew each\nother. And apparently, Bella must have run into Stella and got snatched away and she\nwas arrested, transported to Auschwitz and never came back.",
        "Q: Can I ask you something here? Was a there a different feeling about being betrayed\nby fellow Jews than there was by being arrested and deported by the Nazis?",
        "A: Totally. I mean, as absurd as it may sound, but that's what I expected from the\nGestapo to do, if they arrest me that they would deport me. But for a Jew to do that, to\nturn on other Jews that was such an unbelievable act of betrayal that, I mean it just, I\nmean if you ask any Jew who lived underground in Berlin, whether they knew her or not,\nshe was, everybody knew her by name at least, there is not one that I can think of who\nwould excuse her or even say that she should have gotten anything less than execution\nafter the war. I mean, she just didn't deserve to live, her life is based on the lives of\nhundreds of people who are not alive anymore because of her. I mean, to think of 1t even\nnow still drives me crazy that she is alive and she has apparently a pleasant life and has\nsome sort of a government pension. Yeah, one thing, I have to back up a little bit, on the\n27th of February, 1943, that was just about a little bit less than a month after we went\nunderground, remember we went underground on the 30th of January, '43. On the 27th\nof February, the SS made a general sweep of all factories which employed Jews under\nextremely brutal conditions. The 27th of February, of course, was a winter day and it\nwas a cold day, the Gestapo simply collected the Jews without giving them the\nopportunity to go back to their dressing rooms to pick up their outerwear, coats or\nwhatever they had, they were just like that taken to various transit camps that had been\nreadied for that because the regular transit camp, obviously, wouldn't have taken the\nthousands and thousands of people. And then they were shipped out in a series of\ntransports in the first week of March, 1943. After that, Berlin was essentially\n\"judenrein\". It's a tragedy because, I mean it's a tragedy for everyone, but I also have to\nthink back again at my good friend, Hans Fabisch, who had hoped that he was safe\nworking in a factory. Well, he himself wasn't safe anyway, but even if he would not have\nbeen arrested on that day, it was the 18th of January, '43, he would have been arrested a\nlittle bit later and without announcement. None of these people knew it and, incidentally,\nStella Goldschlag, in that factory, she was smart enough when the Jews were herded\ndown, apparently nobody thought of sort of bringing up the rear and she stayed back, she\nworked there, by the way, with her mother, she and her mother stayed back and walked\nslower and then ducked into one of the ladies restrooms and then left at the end of the\nshift, at the end of the day when thousands of workers sort of streamed out of the factory\ngate and that way they escaped being deported on that day. And then they went\nunderground and then sometime later, she was caught, actually by another catcher for the\nGestapo.",
        "Q: Do you want to just, I know this is jumping forward, but because we're talking about\nStella, I understand she was caught after the war. How did that come about?",
        "A: That is all explained, a book was written about her. I mean, she wasn't caught, I mean\nshe voluntarily went to the Jewish community to get papers as a victim of fascism and to\ntake advantage of, you know, many of the sort of restitution measures that were then\ntaken or given to the Jews. And she, I mean that was an unbelievable act of naivet\u00e9, how\nshe could have thought to get away with it. I ought to say one other thing, you know\nthere were Jews also during the years when Jews were deported and picked up, there\nwere Jews who picked up other Jews, like my parents were picked up by Jews, that can't\nbe compared to what Stella did. Because these Jews picked up Jews who were not in\nhiding, who were basically, you might say, at the disposal of the Gestapo, I mean the\nGestapo knew where they were and they could have picked them up. It is true those Jews\nmade life easier for the Gestapo, but nobody believes that the Gestapo would have given\nup the Holocaust or the murdering of the German Jews even, if these Jewish orderlies\nwould have refused the pickup. I know that quite a number of authors, even Raul Hilberg\nand particularly Hannah Arendt, have criticized very strongly the collaboration by Jews\nin the deportation process, and not only in Berlin, but in the Eastern ghettos and in other\nplaces. However, I think each case has to be judged individually and many of these\norderlies were simply not given any choice. They had a tragic task to fulfill. Similar, in\nfact, you can compare it to the so-called \"Sonderkommandos\", or special commandos, in\nthe concentration camp. These were the Jews who serviced the gas chambers and the\ncrematoria and extracted gold teeth from the corpses and so on. They could have refused\nand would have been shot probably, and the Gestapo still would have, or the SS over\nthere, would have obtained everything they wanted to obtain. In the case of Stella, these\nwere people who otherwise in all likelihood, would have survived the war. So it is a\ntotally different thing and I want in the strongest terms, in moral terms, to make a strong\ndifference between her actions and the actions of the orderlies who had that tragic task to\npick up Jews for deportation.\nBeginning Tape Six, Side A",
        "Question: This is a continuation of an interview with Ernest Fontheim, on June fourth, 1997.\nThis is tape one, side A. For the record, why don't we begin again with your stating your name,\ndate of birth and city of birth, if you don't mind.",
        "Answer: Well, my name is, my full name is Ernest Gundolf Fontheim. I was born on October 23,\n1922, in Berlin, Germany. I might add that my father was a lawyer, he was born in 1881, so he\nwas already over 40 years old when I was born and he was one of the best known lawyers in\nBerlin. And I grew up in a -- very comfortably and in a very assimilated home, assimilated to\nGerman culture and with very little awareness of my Judaism.",
        "Q: Okay. Do you want to pick up where we left off before?",
        "A: Yeah. I would -- I would like to say that the transition from -- to the life underground,\nunderground meaning simply with forged papers and under a different identity, meant of course\nfor me also, a radical transition in family. My parents had just been arrested and deported and\nnow I am living -- I was living with a completely different family and the family atmosphere was\ntotally different. While my parents were both actually highly educated and very intellectual, the\nfamily of Margaret and her parents, family Haas, were on the other hand -- I mean Mr. Haas was\na -- a tailor and designer of women's clothes and -- and actually had owned a factory be -- until\nthe Nazis took it away from him. He was a man who was much more folksy than my parents, had\na tremendous sense of humor and was a very warm person. And of course there were frictions\nnow and then. I guess that is always unavoidable, but in -- in general, I felt comfortable and of\ncourse also grateful that I was accepted, practically as a family member by this new family. Also,\nanother big difference was the age difference. As I said, my father was actually quite old and for\na boy of my age -- I mean, my mother was 10 years younger than he, but Margaret's parents\nwere, they were both of the same age, 20 years younger than my father and 10 years younger\nthan my mother and I think that also made a difference in -- in the relationship.",
        "Q: What kind of difference are we talking about in terms of your rapport with them?",
        "A: In -- in, to some extent, in terms of rapport and then also in -- in terms of how they took life. I\nmean also, I have to say that my fa -- my parents had gone through unbelievable agony, I mean\nstarting in 1933. Probably to some extent, they took it much harder. They surely lost much more,\nbecause they had more to lose. They were, in those 10 years, starting in 1933, they were robbed\nof all of their possessions, everything that my father had worked for and also their social\nstanding and everything had been taken away from them. And by the time that the deportation\nstarted, they were totally devastated and -- and the atmosphere therefore at home, also was\nalways -- ho-how can I describe it? I mean morbid, maybe and -- and -- and just extremely ne-\nnegative. While, in -- in spite of all the hardships, Margaret's parents, first of all because they\nwere younger and secondly because, I guess, they didn't go quite through the same amount of\ntremendous radical turmoil and change, had retained their sense of humor and also their, sort of\nsome sense of ad-adventurism and -- and so on. And I-I-I think to that extent, I-I felt comfortable\nthere, in spite of the fact that the lot of my parents and my sister continued to be a -- a\ntremendous weight, I mean I-I -- by that time of course, I always hoped that they'll be in some\ncamp and -- which will be liberated at some point in the future.",
        "Q: So you have -- it was -- it was a more fun atmosphere?",
        "A: Well, funner -- well yeah, I mean to some extent that is also true, we -- for example, we -- we\nhad brought along a -- a phonograph player, we played records, both classical as well as dance\nmusic. I didn't know how to dance and so Margaret, who was an excellent or is still -- is an\nexcellent dancer, taught me how to dance and -- and -- and yeah, as I said, ther-there was a\ncertain amount of -- of -- of -- of humor and -- and -- and also light-heartedness. And of course,\nthat went together with the fact that I and none of us, in fact, was wearing the yellow star any\nmore, which made us outcasts. We felt sort of, at least I felt liberated by that and I mean all of\nthat contributed to a -- to a -- a more positive mental outlook. In addition, I want to say that we\ntried to keep as much as possible, the Jewish holidays. I don't remember any more, how we even\nknew the dates, we surely didn't have any Jewish calendars, there were none printed in Germany.\nBut we did know, for example, when Yom Kippur was and we fasted on it. We did know when\nPesach, the date was and we even kept the ornamental Seder. Margaret's father, who was in\ngeneral an excellent cook and -- and baker, baked some approximation of a matzo, which we ate\nand of course we didn't even have a Haggadah, but we talked about the exodus from Egypt, just\nfrom out of our memory. I did have a handwritten copy of the Kiddush and so every Friday\nevening, we lit candles and made Kiddush. If we didn't have wine, we used some other liquid,\nwhatever came handy, even if it had to be water. And -- and if we didn't have two candles, we\ncu-cut one candle into two. And I derived a lot of strength, I think from the -- the fact, I mean, of\nthe Jewish religion and that was actually one important pillar of -- of strength I had. Looking\nback, there were three pillars of strength. One was my Judaism, the second was my unshakable\ntrust in the future. I had almost certainty that Germany would lose the war, even at a time when\nGermany was -- still seemed to be winning. And in fact I had taken along some books. I had\nalready decided to study physics later. I took a book for self teaching of calculus along, which I\nworked through from cover to cover in those years. And I had a physics book, which I studied.\nEvery week I located some time to do that. And -- and in addition to that, by the way, we -- there\nwas in -- in a local, bigger town, there was a public library, which we joined, of course, under\nour assumed names and so we checked books out, novels and other things and -- and I already\nsaid that we played music, so we -- we tried to maintain as normal an atmosphere a-as possible.\nSo -- and -- and incidentally, I -- and in fact, none of the four of us ever had the intention, after\nthe end of the war, to stay one day longer in Germany than absolutely necessary and we had, at\nthat time already, always dreamt about coming to America. That was sort of a dream, like --\nalmost like a castle in the sky. And so it -- it was the Judaism and my trust in the future are the\ntwo. The third pillar of strength was actually Margaret, as I had indicated earlier, I had at one\ntime, in -- in the -- during -- while we -- while we were still working at the factory at Zeemens,\nstarted to fall in love with Margot, only to hear that she had a -- a -- a steady boyfriend, but by\nthat time, I-I-I forgot what happened to the boyfriend, I think he also went underground, actually\nand anyway, he -- he was not available and there was no contact and so my interest in Margot\nwas of course rekindled and at that time, finally, 1t was reciprocated. And -- and actually she was\nthe person really closest to me and -- who gave me much of the inner strength also. She was sort\nof the third leg in that -- what -- what kept me going, emotionally I mean, mentally going. I\nshould also say that, one thing that I was not aware of at that time, but that -- was the arrest of\nmy friend Huntz, which I had mentioned earlier. All people that I had known in my earlier life,\nwere gone. Some of them of course had emigrated, the rest had been deported. There was\nnobody from my immediate family, my first girlfriend, school friends, factory friends, you name\nit. Relatives, there was nobody. I-I was totally alone in the world and the funny thing is, or the\nstrange thing is that I was totally unaware of it at that time. It occurred only years after the end of\nthe war, when I sort of went through my memory, it occurred to me that's what actually was the\ncase. And -- and she was the only one who was close to me and who -- who, as I said, who\nsustained me. Then I-I had talked about the primitive nature of the house we lived in, that --\nhouse is probably a -- a euphemism, maybe a cottage or a hut. I had mentioned the pump in the\ngarden, what I didn't say is, people might assume it was an electric pump, it wasn't, 1t was a\nhand pump and you had to work very hard to get water up, pumping it and as I also mentioned,\nin -- in winter sometimes it froze. The hut itself was built of wooden boards with -- with fairly\nwide slits of what I would say an eighth of an inch or so and that made it, obviously, very\nuncomfortable in winter. Through our Nazi friend, whom I had also mentioned before, we had --\nwe made contact to people where one could get building material. Building material of course,\nwere severely rationed and practically impossible to get and we got sort of insulation plates and\neve-even nails were hard to get and so we co-completely insulated the house from the inside with\nsort of, some plastic type material. I don't know what it is any more. And -- and we got all that\nmaterial really, through his connections. Then one day during our stay there, suddenly the local\nvillage policeman came and fortunately while I was out of the house. I was probably in Berlin\nand he said he wanted to find out who was living there and asked Margaret's father all kinds of\nquestions, where he worked and he wanted to see the ID, which he showed him and -- and where\neverybody else worked and whatever other questions. And then -- and he was fairly -- he wasn't\noutright unfriendly, but -- but very business-like, which is in -- in -- in a rural setting in that\nvillage is really unusual. People were sort of more like a family there. And at the end he said,\n\u201cWell, I hear there's a young man living here also.\u201d And then Mr. Haas said, \u201cYes, that's my\nnephew and his name so and so, Gunther Hessem,\u201d that was my assumed false name. And the\npoliceman then said, \u201cWell, I want to ask him some questions. When --\u201d Yeah, and he was also\ntold that I'm working in a factory and then he asked when I am home and he was told I'll be back\non -- on the weekend and he said then, \u201cWell, tell him I'll be here next Saturday,\u201d I forgot,\nprobably 10 or whatever in the morning, \u201cand I want to ask him some questions.\u201d And -- and\nthen he left and -- and we felt very threatened by that and -- and of course I was the most\nvulnerable because I was of military age and I did not have, as I explained earlier, the complete\nset of required papers, so Margaret's father went immediately to our Nazi district leader friend\nand complained bitterly about it, said that the village policeman, I remember his name, even. His\nname was Mueller, good German name, had come and -- and interrogated him, almost like a\ncriminal and he felt very indignant. After all, he is an honest, honorable citizen and so on. And\nHarry, the -- the Nazi's name, said, \u201cOh, don't worry about it Herman, he is a good friend of\nmine, I'll take care of it.\u201d And a few days later, Harry came, paid us a visit and said, \u201cMueller\nisn't going to come any more here. I had a beer with him yesterday at the village pub and I told\nhim that you guys are good friends of mine and I've known you for years and you're honest,\nhonorable people and there was no reason to.\u201d And we never saw Mueller again. So, unwittingly,\nthe guy po-possibly might have saved our lives. I had once a close brush with arrest in Berlin. As\nI mentioned, also earlier, the trips to Berlin were necessary to keep up with our black market\ncontacts and -- and to get food. And I should say also, by the way, that most of the food was\nobtained by Margaret's father and his wife, they had of course many more contacts. They had\nlived longer, they knew more people and -- but I had a number of people also, that I visited\nusually once a week, sometimes twice a week. So, and I was always extremely careful. I think I\nmentioned some of the strategies already that I used to avoid detection. And when I was riding in\nthe subway, I always rode -- sat on -- on the bench, sort of midway between the doors, which are\n-- were on either end. So -- and -- and watching the people who would enter and if somebody\nwould enter whom I suspected or even knew, on the door to the right, I would get up and leave to\nthe left. Not that 1t ever came, but at least that was my strategy. Well, on -- on that particular day,\nit was rush hour and I entered the train at the Wittenburg Platz station, in Witten, in the part of --\nthe busiest part of the western Berlin business district and since it was rush hour, the train was\npacked with people, of course and I never got to the center, I just was sort of next to the entrance\ndoor where I entered, sort of squeezed in between people. And as I stood there, as the train\nrumbled and rumbled along -- and incidentally, after Wittenburg Platz, the train emerged from a\ntunnel and became then an elevator train. I saw a chubby, short man next to me, say thank you to\na soldier who was also standing next to him, handing back his ID, and I immediately knew that\nwas a -- some sort of a secret policeman. And by that time it was obviously first of all, I couldn't\nget out of the train and if I would have made one move, that would have even arranged --\naroused suspicion. So I just looked into the air, trying to look as harmless and innocent as I\ncould, but the guy sort of swung around and fixated me with his eyes and said, \u201cYour papers,\nplease.\u201d And he made me very ma -- nervous. I had been controlled, I must say, several times\nbefore and usually it went very -- people looked at my ID and I greeted them with a snappy Heil\nHitler and that -- that's the job. Well, he looked at my ID and I -- the more he looked, the more I\nnoticed he must have been a real professional. He -- he looked back between me and the picture,\nand it was of course my picture. Then he tried to lift the picture up to see how it was fastened to\nthe material of the ID and asked me one or two questions and I got so unbelievably nervous that I\nnoticed that my artery in my neck started really to pump very hard and that was something that I\ncouldn't control, but he must have noticed that. And -- and because he -- he constantly gave me\nsharp looks and then I was already expected to be arrested or at least taken along for further\ninterrogation. Instead he handed me the paper back and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d And I had the distinct\nfeeling that guy wasn't satisfied and the reason why he didn't arrest me is he had decided it might\nbe smarter to follow me, because I might lead him somewhere, where he could get maybe a\nbigger catch, or something. So -- a-and at the next stop, which then, as I said was an elevated\nstop, Nolendorf Platz, he left the tra -- he left the car. And I decided immediately, that guy didn't\nleave. There are two possibilities. Either he had another man with him, whom I didn't know who\nit was, whom he might give him -- have given some wink to follow me, or he would just have\ngone to the next car and wait where I would leave. So I quickly, in my mind, made a plan of how\nto shake off either him, or somebody whom I may not even know. And the next stop was\nBuellerstrasser, was one of the busiest intersections in -- in Berlin. Buellerstrasser, corner\nPutstamastrasser. And I-I left the car then and walked down and the stairs from the elevated\nended in a median strip between the two lanes of traffic, you know, going one way and one side\nand the opposite way in the other side. And at the bottom of the stairs, I-I knew the area like my\nown pockets. At the bottom of the stairs was a newspaper kiosk. So my plan was, and that's what\nI did, I stopped at the newspaper kiosk and pretended t-to read newspapers and headlines and so\non, while out of my -- the corner of my right eye, I peered up, who was coming down the stairs\nand I figured that if so -- if somebody whom I didn't know was going to follow me, that person\nwould sort of linger around and I could sort of make out who it was. Was the guy himself, of\ncourse I would know and lo and behold, I had hardly stopped and started looking at the\nnewspaper, when I saw that guy come down. So he obviously did what I had suspected. He was\nin another car and waited for me to leave. So I ignored him and just kept reading the newspapers\nand that was probably not part of his plan. Because he had to follow me surreptitiously and if he\nhad lingered around there, I would have been aware of it. So he didn't He stayed, I don't know,\nmaybe 10, 20 seconds or so and then he crossed over to one side and that was exactly what I had\nanticipated. I should say also, there was a traffic light at that corner of Buellerstrasser and\nPutstamastrasser. So, once he crossed over to one side, I waited for the light to be such that\ntraffic was going and then I made my way, sprinted between cars, to the opposite side, so that\nthere were now two lanes of moving traffic between him and me. And then I walked along, not\nto -- to the busy street, which was Putstamastrasser, but to the next block, which was a -- sort of\na residential street, with very few people only walking there. And -- but I-I -- in order not to\narouse suspicion, I didn't run, I just walked briskly, the way one walks purposefully in a city, if\none goes after some appointment or so. And as soon as I had turned the corner, I raced as fast as\nI could and it was about 100 meter dash to the next corner and there I looked around and I saw\nthat guy come around also, following me. Then I-I walked, I-I turned again the corner and came\nback at a different block of Putstamastrasser, see that busy street, jumped on a moving trolley\ncar. In those days, trolley cars had rear platforms, without a door, so you could, just by grabbing\nthe handlebars and jumping on, you could even jump o-on a -- a car, while it was -- they -- they -\n- they didn't go very fast. While it was in the middle of -- of riding, driving. And -- in this way I\nshook that guy off. I am still convinced that -- that he had some suspicion, that he was not -- my\npaper was not that perfect. I should also say that, over the -- by that time, though, we are into\n1944 and many of my friends and acquaintances, who had gone underground, or had -- one after\nanother had been caught by the Gestapo. I mentioned that cousin of mine, who had gone to\nBavaria and -- and his girlfriend. There were various schoolmates from my high school class\nwho got caught. Then that other friend, Galcoun, who wasn't caught, but who was murdered.\nAnd -- and of course that -- that had an effect on -- on our, you know, mental outlook obviously\nand -- but I guess there's a -- there's a German saying which sounds very cruel, but it was really\nthe case in our case, it's veba graba forwards, it means, \u201cYou walk forward over graves.\u201d And\nthat's -- that was all the time what happened to us. We -- we lost a tremendous number of friends.\nSome of them came back, but most did not. During that period of time, of course, also the\nmilitary situation changed more and more against Germany and that gave us a tremendous\nmorale boost. I mean, by that time, in the 1943, Italy had already capitulated and -- and then in\nearly '44, there were continuous rumors of a landing of the Allied Forces, somewhere in France.\nAnd that happened finally, on June 6, 1944. I still remember the -- the day distinctly. Of course\nwe didn't have any radio in our hut, so we didn't know anything, but Margaret's parents were in\nthe city, in Berlin on that day, on -- on their various errands to contact black market sources. And\nthey had bought extra editions of newspapers, so when they arrived out, 1n -- in -- in -- 1n our\nhouse, in our cottage in -- in the evening, they came with the news that the Allied had landed in\nthe Normandy and for Margaret, that was such a shock of joy that she broke out into tears. I-I-I\nnever forget that. And -- and we were just unbelievably happy. Of course, a-as the Allies then\ncontinued to make progress, and yeah, I should say also, incidentally, on the eastern front, the\nsuccesses were tremendous. Even before that, in -- in 1943, I think the biggest attack battle of all\ntime took place in the area of Koosk and Orwell, in the western Soviet Union and where\nGermany suffered a decisive defeat. And by that time, by 1944, when the allies landed in the --\nthe western allies landed in the Normandy, the Russians had already taken Warsaw and from\nboth sides, the allies were approaching finally, German territory. And, so one response of the\nNazi's was to create a new unit called folkshdum, best translated as \u201cmilitia.\u201d And all Germans\nwho were not -- all German males, I should say, between 16 and 60, who were not in the armed\nforces, were immediately conscripted into that folkshdum. And the conscription, since they didn't\nwant to create a new bureaucracy, was -- the task of conscription was given to the Nazi party\norganization, which was already an existing organization with offices and so on. And -- but now\nit became necessary to have ideas, because if you're not in the Vairmarkt, in the armed forces or\nany of its branches, you had to be in the folkshdum. It's was either one or the other. So\nfortunately, Margaret's father had a -- a colleague from earlier days, also a Jewish colleague, I\nmean, from the garment line, who was underground and he had access to blank ID's f-for the\nfolkshdum. And -- but what he couldn't supply was the -- the -- the rubber stamp, it -- 1t was\nstamped by the Nazi party district, in which one was mustered in-into the folkshdum. And then I\nremembered that I knew a stamp maker. So I went to -- and -- and he knew me only, also under\nmy forged, I mean assumed name, not who I really was. And of course for stamp makers it was\nstrictly forbidden to make official stamps because they can be used then for all kinds of purposes\n-- illegal purposes. So I went to him and told him a long story, the story basically was that my\nuncle was working in a local party district, registering folkshdum members and that in the -- in\nthe crush and the busy work there, somehow the stamp got lost. He thinks it may have fallen off\nthe table into a wastebasket and then empty out, but -- but he simply didn't know what happened\nto it and he reported it immediately to the local -- to his boss, the district leader and the district\nleader was very unhappy about that and said if that got into the wrong hands, you know,\nanything can be done with forgeries and he holds him personally responsible, he better look\nwithin two days, if he doesn't -- if he has not found the stamp, then he has to face consequences.\nSo -- a-and of course the consequences in those days usually were that the party would fire him\nand then he would be immediately subject to military induction and be shipped to the eastern\nfront. And so I told that stamp maker, then finally said I would like to have that stamp within a\nday. I -- I can give him, first of all, the actual cost, whatever it is. In addition to that, 300\ncigarettes, 100 immediately and 200 when I get the stamp. And in those days, cigarettes were --\nwere almost worth their weight in gold. And so the guy agreed. I had the stamp within -- less\nthan two -- two days. And then Margaret's father went back to his friend and they made a deal\nthat he would give us, free of charge, two of folkshdum membership blanks and we in turn\nwould stamp his own with the party stamp that we had, also free of charge for itwasa. And so --\nso that's what happened and of course, women didn't need a -- an ID as I said, because only\nmales were inducted into the folkshdum militia. So -- so we had, in fact I still have my\nfolkshdum ID. And -- and to have that ID was actually terrific because that obviated the need for\nany military papers, because only people who were not in the armed forces were inducted into\nthe folkshdum. And since -- and the party, of course, had all of that background material. So, by\nbeing in the folkshdum, that automatically implied that the military status of that person was\nokay, whatever it was. And -- and also, of course, as the situation became more desperate for the\nNazis, there were more and more ID checks on the streets, I mean they were looking first of all\nfor German deserters. They were looking for allied spies, they were looking for -- you know they\nhad millions of foreign workers in Germany also, they had been forcibly deported to work in the\narmaments industry. And many of those were on the loose, they just ran away. So, anyway, the\nthing was that having that paper, I'm sure saved my life, because I was then frequently\ncontrolled, particularly by military police. Now, on the other hand, as the situation worsened, it\nalso became more and more difficult to get food. I-I-I should say where -- what with black\nmarket food prices, I believe I mistakenly said in an earlier interview here, that the black market\nprices were 10 times regular prices. That -- I have to take that back, it-it's closer to 100 times. In\nother words, any, say pound of meat or whatever, was -- which whose price may have been one\nmark regularly bought in a store with food ration stamps, would be 100 mark on the black\nmarket. But, because of increasing shortages, because Germany of course, used to get a lot of its\nfood from the occupied areas and they were no longer occupying them, obviously the scarcity\ngrew higher and as the supply dwindled and the demand either stayed the same or increased,\nobviously the price increased. So, just at that point, that problem was solved for us. What\nhappened was -- was that on a d -- on one day, I was also in Berlin, using the -- the subway and\nas I sat there, a girl -- I mean young woman actually, a year or two older than I, whom I had\nknown from before, in fact she was a counselor in a vacation camp that I went to 1n the 1930's, in\nthe mid '30's and then later I met her again at Zeemans, where she was also a forced laborer. And\nshe approached me and said, \u201cOh hi, how are you,\u201d and that, \u201cI'm so happy to see you.\u201d But\nsince one didn't trust anyone whom one hadn't seen continuously, I said, \u201cWell, my name isn't\nFontheim.\u201d And -- and then she said, \u201cWell, don't you have a smaller sister?\u201d I said, \u201cNo,\u201d and I\ngave her some fictitious name, say like my name 1s Irige Billow and I only have an older brother.\nAnd she sort of left the train puzzled. And -- and at that point I decided she 1s obviously not\nworking for the Gestapo because she wouldn't be put off by such a rude, crude lie. Okay, but\nanyway, about a week or two later, I ran into her again on the same sort of line of the subway\nwhere I met her the first time and then I admitted that -- that her memory was really correct and\nthen she said, \u201cOh, that's marvelous,\u201d and \u201clet's sit down at a cafe and -- and then have a little\ntalk.\u201d And I said, \u201cThat's a great idea, but I don't have any food ration coupons\u201d And in\nrestaurants and cafes, you also had to pay, obviously, the price in mark, but in addition, which\nwas much more important, give the food coupons, equivalent for whatever you were ordering,\nwhat -- even if it was just a piece of cake. And she said, \u201cOch, d-d-don't bother, I invite you.\u201d So\nokay, so since I was always hungry, I fo -- I accepted the invitation, so we sat down in a cafe and\ntalked. Of course I have to say that I didn't tell her a thing, where I was actually living, we were\njust talking sort of in general terms and -- and then she said -- yeah, I mean I-I asked her whether\nI couldn't pay for the stamps, coupons that she used on me, she said no, she didn't pay for hers\neither and in fact she'll show me how to get them free of charge and all one had to do is find out\nwhere the last air raid -- there were daily air raids now. Where the last air raid was centered at.\nAnd that was easy, that spread through Berlin like fire, the news, you know, last night this\ndistrict was hit or that district. So we went to where last night --",
        "Q: Finish your sentence.",
        "A: Oh, where last night the -- the allies had bombed, and looked up a house that was destroyed.\nEnd of Tape Six, Side A\nBeginning Tape Six, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape one, side B of a continued interview with Ernest Fontheim, on June fourth, 1997.",
        "A: So we arrived at the part of town where last night's air raid had done the most of the damage\nand then my friend -- her name by the way is Ursula, she said, \u201c\u201cWhat we need to do 1s first of all,\nwrite down the address of a house that's completely destroyed, or at least remember and note it\ndown.\u201d So, that's what we did. And then the German, sort of air raid support system was, by\nyears of experience, of course very well organized. Each house had -- I mean the -- the -- the\npeople who lived in -- in each house knew exactly where to go if that house became destroyed. It\nwas usually a public -- usually a school nearby, sometimes a church or some such public\nbuilding. So -- and that was posted also in the -- near the building. So we -- after noting the\naddress of the place, of the house that was destroyed -- of course that was just one of many\nhouses, and also discovering where to go for further support, we went there and of course that\nwas a school, I remember and it was in the main auditorium and the place was mobbed with\npeople who had been bombed out the previous night. Some with some of their belongings still\nsaved and others with nothing. And there were -- and the place was run again by a subsidiary of\nthe Nazi party organization. And -- and then I-I stuck with her and we -- first of all registered at a\ndesk where a man in full Nazi party regalia was sitting. And she would give some fictitious name\nand that address and saying that she lost all of her belongings, including even her papers. And so\nthey immediately did two things. They gave a person a temporary ID, identifying that person as a\nbombed out person and also asking then all agencies of the government to sort of give any\nsupport possible. And for people who had lost their food ration cards, they -- oh no, wait a\nminute. I-I'm sorry, I take that back. They did not hand out any food ration. They simply noted\ndown the -- listed the person as totally bombed out and then they supplied people with\nsandwiches and cigarettes and if they needed, also an overnight, a simple cot, although people\nwere urged, if possible, to move in with friends or relatives, but those who didn't have either,\ncould also stay overnight there. So, of course I followed her example, gave a differ -- I did not\ngive my name that I had adopted on my papers, I didn't want that to appear there. So I chose just\nsome arbitrary name that came to my mind, but the same address and I also got an ID,\nidentifying me as bombed out. Now the point was, with that ID, one could go then to any food\nrationing office and get a set of food ration cards. And the idea of course was, you couldn't do it\nin the same district where the building was located because they had, of course, a complete card\ncatalog of people who were living in that district and -- and of course neither one of these people\neven existed. But with the bombed out ID, one -- any other food ration office -- suppose one\nmoved to a different part of Berlin than was required to hand out a -- a set of food ration cards.\nAnd of course, in another district, they wouldn't have the set of -- of you know, registered people\nliving in that district. Comes to my mind, I'm glad that the tech -- to -- that today's technology\ndidn't exist in those days, because today all they would have to do is, on a computer, access a\ndatabase and look up anyone from any other di-district. But fortunately the Nazis didn't have that\ncapability yet, otherwise they would have used it. So what we did is we took them -- the subway\nto a different part of Berlin. Went there, got our set of food ration cards and then took off. And\nthat was now the first set and I enjoyed that game so much, I-I should add also, by the way, that\nthe sandwiches they handed out were terrific. I had not had such good sa-salami sandwiches in --\nin years, in fact. And that alone was even worth it. So I start practically every time when I was in\nBerlin, since there were daily air raids, there was -- there were every -- every day there were\nhouses destroyed the preceding night, so all one had to do was sort of ask and find out in what\npart of the city, to go there, look up an address of a destroyed, I mean house from the -- from last\nnight and then go to the local sort of air raid support facility, where people were helped with\ntheir fi-first needs and so on, get another ID. And -- and so I kept doing that and finally at the\nheight of the thing, I got -- I-- I got food ration stamps for 16 people, without paying a penny for\nit. So we could just go into stores and -- and buy food at the regular price-controlled prices,\nwhich was peanuts. And -- and that obviously was a tremendous help also in our -- our, you\nknow, for our budget.",
        "Q: Wasn't there any chance that there was going to be duplication?",
        "A: Yeah, I mean -- I-I am sure that these card officers, foo-food coupon officers where I went\nunder an assumed name then would forward my name and -- and this address that I gave to the\nfood office in that district and then within days they would find out that person never existed\nthere, and -- but by that time I was gone and when you -- the food ration coupons themselves\ndidn't have a name of a person on it. So you could -- you didn't have to be afraid that they knew\nalready that this was, the whole thing was a fake. I mean, I-I could use the stamps without being\nafraid to be identified. It was a marvelous thing. And yeah, also of course, the continuous air\nraids -- by the way, the air raids started I should say, really to become severe and shortly after we\nmoved there, I think I discussed that even, that helped us in -- in -- in our fictitious story that we\ntold people. And of course it got worse as the war went on and usually it was the British bomber\nfleet coming at night and the Americans during daytime. And it was sometimes an awful --\nawesome, not awful -- an awesome sight during daytime. The Americans were flying in like on a\nsort of military exercise, in -- in close formation. And the roar of the bombers -- there were\nhundreds usually, filled the heavens. It was for us almost a shout of liberation. And -- and they\nwere just coming an-and you -- we could see the anti-aircraft guns, the German flock firing at\nthem without much effect. And -- and then when they start dropping their bombs, the bombs sort\nof had made a whistle sound as they fell down on the -- with tremendous speed. And -- and the\nwhistle sound then was followed by seconds of silence and then a tremendous explosion. And of\n-- of course there were hundreds of them. It -- it -- it was a -- an unbelievable experience and --\nand at night of course one couldn't see the bombers any more, but the noise was the same and --\nand then of course the flames that engulfed large parts of the city would almost be a -- a --\npresent a ghostly scene of -- of fire and destruction. And obviously that had also a tremendous\neffect on the population and people reacted differently, but by that time, it was obvious I think to\nmost sane people at least, that the war was lost. And if the war was lost, then all that destruction\nand all of the German soldiers who were still falling on all fronts, were just a total waste or a\nwasted loss, which wouldn't really do anything for Germany. And so many -- there was a lot of\ndissatisfaction ex-expressed with the government. But it was all sort of below the surface and the\nreason was, there was a tremendous government terror that increased. There wasn't just the\nGestapo, but I mean, the employed agents of the Gestapo, but there was a much larger army of\neither paid or unpaid informers, or people who are sometimes just out of spite, were informing\non others. And obviously that kept people in line and they would often grumble only between\ntheir four walls or to -- only to people whom they definitely knew to be okay and safe. But there\nwas increasing dissatisfaction as the war came closer to the German borders and the -- the\nGerman government -- and particularly the propaganda machine of Goebbels, had another\nweapon given to them and -- and that was actually by the Russians. The -- while it is\nunderstandable that the Russians, who had suffered unbelievably under German occupation were\nnot very kindly disposed towards the Germans, but the -- the atrocities committed by the\nRussians and the -- the totally wanton destruction in the wake of the Soviet army, was such that\nGoebbels was able to whip up enthusiasm for continuing the fight by basically threatening the\nGermans with the Russians. And of course the worst part of the terror probably were the\nunbelievable rapes. I-I must admit that I did not believe the stories at first and thought they were\njust an outgrowth of Goebbels propaganda, I mean in the same way how the antisemitic press,\nfor years had smeared the Jews with all kinds of sexual innuendoes and so on, which were just\ninventions. But it turns out, I mean the Russians -- incidentally, the Russians did not only do that\nin Germany, I mean, even in areas that they liberated, countries that were supposed to be allies,\nlike Czechoslovakia, Poland, there were unbelievable rapes in those countries. And so it can't be\njust explained by the fact that there was an accumulated hatred against the Germans. But of\ncourse that contributed to it. But, be that as it may, they handed the Germans a tremendous\npropaganda weapon and -- and occasionally it would happen that the -- the German army would\nmake a counter-offensive and sort of re-occupy some locality which the Russians had already\ntaken before. And then they would immediately send in the entire press corps and -- and\ninterview people and they would get some sort of first hand horror stories of how the Russians\nbehaved. And I'm sure that was part of why th-the Germans put up resistance t-to the very end\nBut the -- the -- the fact is that resistance didn't give them any better results anyway and I would\nsay that any building that was destroyed and any German that was killed fighting in the latter\npart of '44 and '45 was just a waste. Of course not to forget that during that time also, hundreds\nof thousands, if not millions of Russians, still were killed and -- and also Jews were killed in the\nHolocaust, which continued unabated. I should say on that subject, incidentally, the fact that a\nholocaust was going on was totally unknown to us. We did occasionally -- we had opportunity to\nlisten to foreign broadcasts and incidentally, that was strictly forbidden and it was under death\npenalty that if anyone listened to a foreign radio broadcast. But sometimes we had the chance to\nand -- and -- and there were reports finally, mainly from BBC, the British radio, that the Nazis\nwere killing, at that time it was said, hundreds of thousands of Jews, and that -- while it filled us\nwith fear, it -- the number, hundreds of thousands, was so huge that it staggered our imagination.\nAnd that was not even 10 percent of the truth, but we didn't know it in -- at that time.",
        "Q: Had you heard of some of these notorious extermination centers?",
        "A: Well, we definitely had heard of Auschwitz and -- because that was the -- that was the camp\nthat most Jews from Berlin were deported to. And -- at least in the later stages. In the beginning\nthere were also deportations to Riga and then other ghettos. But starting, I think about in the\nmiddle of 1942, maybe early fall of 1942, all deportations went to Auschwitz. Even that was not\nreally officially announced, but it somehow became known. So Auschwitz became known as a\ndestination for the deportations, but the term extermination camp was not known. I mean, what\nwas believed in general, that Jews were worked extremely hard under inhuman conditions and of\ncourse people die under such conditions also. But that they were sort of murdered in a mass\nproduction style, the way it was actually done, was not known to us. It may have now -- that -- I\nhave to add that German soldiers, hundreds of sol -- if not millions of them were in one way or\nanother witnesses of all of these exterminations. And -- and of course they, in -- in most cases\nwere too fearful to even report or -- or tell the -- or even told to keep that silent. But we were, I\nmean in -- in a certain amount of isolation there and -- and to some extent I have to say that it\nmay also have been simply that we, or at least I myself, I can really only talk of mys -- about\nmyself, simply refused to believe that, that it was so horrible and -- and all the people who were\nclose to me were involved in -- in these deportations. And -- and maybe to some extent I -- it was\nwishful thinking, that I did not believe in what really happened in those camps. But all I can say\nis that I hoped, til the victory and even after that, to see my family again.",
        "Q: Was there -- was there -- I mean you said people were fearful to even talk about them, so was\nthere much conversation at all about these places?",
        "A: No, I mean, even in earlier times, it was -- somewhere I-I mentioned for example that after\nthe costan of Jewish males were arrested. They were all told that unless they wanted to come\nback there, to keep their mouth shut. And so people only whispered about it. Some didn't talk at\nall about it and some only to the closest friends or family members, what -- what really happened\nand these were not extermination camps, they were just sort of quote everyday brutalities\ncommitted by the SS.",
        "Q: What I'm try -- what I'm trying to get a sense of is -- since you were amongst German people,\nnot Jews at this point --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And for quite a long time, did there seem to be any horror expressed or any remorse of what\nwas going on, other than the fact that the war had inconvenienced them terribly?",
        "A: No, it was terrib -- the -- the horror was only at the impending loss of the war and what might\nbecome of Germany and of them personally. I-I didn't -- of course, as I said, people had to be\ncareful, but -- but the people that we associated with, and we had a certain social life there and --\nand as I had or said earlier, they -- the -- the cruelties against the Jews never even came up. Now\nthat's -- actually there's one exception. There was one family, an -- an elderly couple with a son\nwho Is -- was about six, seven years older than I and was an officer in the Vairmarkt. They were\npolitically 100 percent -- they often even talked to us and that surprised us because you know,\nthey -- they should have been somewhat mistrustful, but they ex -- op-openly expressed their\nopposition and their hatred of the Nazis and Hitler. They were -- one thing they were a very\ndevout Catholic family. And in northern Germany, where Berlin is located, the vast majority of\npeople of course, are Protestant. But I don't know whether that was the -- bu-but they were --\nthese people actually then, played a role in -- in our final survival. And that's a story I'm coming\nto now. In -- in March -- in March 1945, about six weeks before the end of the war, we heard\nthrough one of our friends that we sort of were socializing with, a very strange story. He -- he\nmet Mr. Haas, Margaret's father, and said he has to tell him something very funny. A -- a\npensioner, who lived in our area, and who earned himself some additional money by working on\npeople's property and he worked also often on a property of our neighbor and he was known as a\nfanatical Nazi. And that pensioner had told him to be careful with us and stay away from us\nbecause there's something not okay. We -- he 1s convinced that we are either foreign spies or\nJews. And -- and then when that man said, you know, \u201cW-W-What makes you think so?\u201d The\nman said, \u201cWell, they have -- they have a -- a Berlin address, where Herman Hesser lives.\u201d And\nthere is actually a Herman Hesser living, he checked the phone book. But he decided to really\nlook into it himself. And so, he -- and being a pensioner, you know he had nothing better to do,\nhe took the subway and went to that address and actually rang the bell and there's indeed a\nHerman Hesser living at that place, but it's a completely different person. And we simply used\nthat person's name to legitimize ourselves. And he told that fellow to -- to be careful and not to\nsay anything to us of stay -- and that guy again -- he was also, by the way, secretly very much\nagainst the Nazis and made commensur. And he interpreted it as saying that now that the war is\nobviously lost, that fanatical Nazi is sort of becoming -- going out of his mind, losing his mind.\nAnd didn't take it seriously, in fact found it really funny. And well, Margaret's father came back\nto us, he didn't find it funny at all, nor did we. And we were thinking about what to do now. Now\nwe knew that that guy probably would, within a day or two, notify the police, if he hadn't already\ndone so. And that we had to get out of there. And in fact we -- we had to get out sort of\nseemingly just as if we go into the city. In other words, without luggage, in order not to arouse\nsuspicion. But we had all of our per-personal belongings there and many of them were also\nnecessary for survival. I mean we, in those days it was practically impossible to buy anything,\ncloth -- gloves, clothing, anything you need. Shoes and so on. So we -- and of course also we\ndidn't really know where to go. So our first reaction was to talk to that elderly couple that I just\nmentioned, and their son -- he was a first lieutenant in the German army, was actually home\nduring that week, on furlough. I think he -- he had some sort of a sick leave, he had a slight\ninjury. And -- and we knew that all of them are totally okay, so the plan was that I -- but we\nwanted to talk to the son alone first. So I went over and asked the son, we would like to have a\ncard game with him, he sometimes played cards. And -- and he said, \u201cYeah, gladly,\u201d he'll be\nover in a few minutes. So in a few minutes he came and we both decided, among the four of us,\nthat the two women would stay in -- in the back room and Margaret's father and I and he would\nsort of play the game. So Margaret's father started out, I still feared -- to mix the -- the cards, to\ndistribute then -- the cards, to -- to play the game, when he suddenly put down the cards on the\ntable and said -- actually, we -- we invited him not to play cards but to discuss some serious\nbusiness with him. And then he told him right of the events -- that our name isn't actually\nHessem. We are Jews who live here in hiding and our name js so and so and we -- and then he\ntold him what happened with that pensioner and that we have to get out immediately or within a\nday at least. And also possibly save some of our belongings. And the -- the officer was in full\nuniform. His name, incidentally, his first name is Heinz. He listened in stony silence, then he got\nup and said he'll discuss everything with his parents and will be back as soon as possible. After\nsome time that to us seemed like an eternity, it was probably not more than 15, 20 minutes, I\ndon't know -- they lived just one block over from us, he came back not alone, but with his\nmother. His mother was a gray haired -- sort of gray haired, dignified lady, came with a huge\nbasket of food, which she plunked on the table with a thump and an angry face and said, \u201cListen,\nyou have known our politics for -- for years now. We have known each other closely enough, we\ncould have helped you all that time. How come you didn't have confidence in us to tell us that\nbefore?\u201d And the food basket contained things which were worth a fortune on the black market.\nSausage, eggs and all kinds of things. And their -- their behavior was just incredible. So -- so\nthen they, right th-they said okay, what -- what they would -- they would like to, first of all,\nsupport us in -- in hiding some of our belongings. And after some discussion, we made the\nfollowing decision. As I had mentioned earlier, every night the British Air Force, the Royal Air\nForce bombarded Berlin, and of course all surrounding areas and had airplane alert, and so\npeople would be up and then after the all clear siren, people obviously would go immediately to\nsleep, because they had to get up early in the morning to go to work. So the decision was to wait\nabout half an hour after the all clear, hoping by that time everybody will be sound asleep and in\nthe meantime have suitcases with certain necessities packed and Heinz said he would help us\ncarry them over to their place and they have a shed behind their house where they could lock\nthem up and they would be safe there. And -- and then Heinz said he had a room in -- in the\nsouthern borough of Berlin, Templehoff. It became known later under -- during the air lift of '48,\n'50, because there was also an airport that played an important role in the air lift. But anyway, in\nTemplehoff he had a room where he could, we c -- all four of us could at least temporarily stay,\nbut or -- some of us. And Margaret's mother knew -- had a -- a girlfriend, I mean a woman friend\nwho was also underground. Now she had succeeded 1n totally legalizing herself with police\nregistration and so on. And she said that the next day, she and Margaret would try to go there and\n-- and -- and Ma-Margaret's father and I would go to the room that Heinz had. And then, before\nleaving, Heinz turned around, pulled out his revol -- service revolver, gave it to Margaret's father\nand said, \u201cHere is my service revolver. If they should come tonight, just finish them off in self\ndefense. The war is over soon, anyway.\u201d And -- and then they left. That was an incredible thing\nthat he did. And -- and then the next day -- I mean then, at night, right, everything worked out the\nway it was planned. We carried the luggage over and I don't know whether we got any sleep\ndone or not, we probably didn't feel like it. The next morning we left, you know, as if going to\nwork, with no particular luggage on us. And -- and never came back and I just want to say that\nafter -- the few weeks after the Battle of Berlin, I came back to visit the place and neighbors told\nus that the following day, the Gestapo came looking for us. So that -- that really saved our lives.\nSo I-I, yeah -- then in that room where we stayed, incidentally, Heinz knew that the\nsuperintendent of the house, a janitor, was a secret Communist. I don -- I never knew how -- how\nhe actually knew that because that was itself subject to execution, but anyway he knew and --\nand he said he will talk to him about us, because he would -- he -- in -- in -- in the city, apartment\nhouse janitors were responsible to have every new person who appears, registered with the\npolice, I discussed that earlier. So -- but he said, if -- he -- he would not tell him that we are Jews,\nthat doesn't fly well with Communists, we -- he'll just tell him -- tell him that we are some\nSocialist activists and have to hide out. And so that's what he did and we were intoruss -- in fact I\nremember the janitor's name, Kuchinski, sort of a Polish name, huh? And -- but I mean, he was a\nGerman. And -- but Kuchinski himself had access to black market pistols. And so I bought a\npistol from him and -- for my own self protection and I had never had a gun in my hand in my\nlife and I decided if I, you know, ever have to use it in an emergency, I don't even -- I-I barely\nknew where to pull the trigger, but not how to aim and so on. So I bought additional ammunition,\nand that was also expensive. Each bullet costs -- I forgot, substantial amount of money. And\nfrom a piece of paper, I made myself a -- sort of a goal to aim at, with concentric circles and then\nI-I traveled out into a forest near Berlin and nailed it to a tree, of course in a solitary place where\nno people were around and then I sort of practiced shot. And I -- and you know, in those days\nthese more old fashioned guns, I think today -- they had a tremendous sort of a backlash. And all\nI remember is I never even hit the outer circle, not to speak of the inner circle. But at least I knew\na little bit of how to handle the thing. And actually I never had to use it, but at least it gave me\nalso some self confidence just to carry it with me. In the meantime, as I said, Margaret's mother\nand she herself were with that woman friend of Mrs. Haas. And -- and in the meantime they --\nthey knew some other people, through whom they finally found a place in Pottsdam. Now\nPottsdam is a suburb. It used to be the summer residence of Prussian kings. And there's\nparticularly one famous castle, the one of Frederick the Great, called Soswasee, which is French\nof course, means without worries or no worries. And that summer -- he was actually a great\nFrancophile and basically even talked mainly French and had his castle and also his garden\nsurrounding the castle designed in imitation of Versailles, on a much smaller scale, of course.\nAnd it also contained an orangery, just like the park in Versailles does. The orangery basically\nserved to keep plants in winter, which were -- which were not durable during winter. And also a\nservant's quarters for the gardeners. And that orangery had been turned into a huge sort of camp\nfor people who were out, bom-bombed out and also for refugees. I-I forgot to say that, actually.\nAs the Soviet army moved westward and came into areas which were inhabited by Germans, the\nGermans were systematically evicted from everywhere. And even that was, it started already\nbefore, I am now talking about March and early April, '45. Even in -- in midwinter, the -- the\nGermans were evicted and day and night you could hear, on the country road that passed by near\nthat cottage where we lived, horse drawn carriages with ref -- German refugees, hundred them.\nAnd, although that obviously was tremendous personal misery for these people, it filled me with\na tremendous joy to see, finally, the hardships of the war hitting back at those who had caused all\nthe misery to us, but also to other peoples. And -- and so there were millions and millions of\nGerman refugees, who were streaming westward, into the still unoccupied areas of Germany,\nincluding Berlin. And so, that orangery, as I said, was a huge camp for such people and so people\nwhom the Haas's knew, who -- who were themselves out bombed and lived there, they were\nintroduced simply as a family that was bombed out, but they said also they knew of my\nexistence, that it is too unsafe to have me there, because why would a youn-young 20, 22 year\nold or so man be living there? I mean he would be normally in the Vairmarkt, fighting. So I\nstayed then, alone in that room of Heinz in -- 1n the city, in the district of Templehoff and they\nwere out there. Of course I had a bicycle and I commuted -- I forgot what, once or twice a week\nout there. One reason also 1s I had all these food coupons that I collected and kept collecting and\nso I also brought food out there. And -- and -- and as -- as the war slowly sort of wound down to\nan end. Now, the Battle of Berlin, 1-1t -- yeah ona, I-I-I-I should say one other thing before the\nbattle. Th-th-the Germans made --",
        "Q: Why don't you finish that thought and then --",
        "A: No, but th-that's a totally new subject.",
        "Q: Okay, then why don't we stop here?\nEnd of Tape Six, Side B\nBeginning of Tape Seven, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape two, side A of an interview with Ernest Fontheim, on June fourth, 1997. The\ninterviewer is Randy Goldman.",
        "A: Yeah, as the war finally came home to Germany, we were delighted to see in the official\nvairmarkten, armed forces report, that was issued at the end of each day, finally German place\nnames. Names like Argen, Kern and so on, instead of names like Zabororja, Minsk, Halokoff,\nKiev and so on. That al-already felt like a liberation and there were more and more German place\nnames now in the official army reports. And all -- while all that happened, the government\nmaintained the official line that the war will be won, that there will be a final victory. As the\nfronts on all sides collapsed, of course preparations were made for the defense of Berlin. I have\nto say, that of all the insanities, that may have been probably the biggest one. There was n-no\nreason really, to defend Berlin and the Germans should have done what the French did in 1940,\ndeclared an open city and surrendered. But of course that was not to be. Instead, throughout\nBerlin, tank traps were built, ditches were dug. And the folkshdum was called up, finally, for\nparticipating in the defense of the city. And often they would even grab civilians from the street\nand just incorporate them in some unit. The battle itself began in earnest on April the 16th, 1945.\nI never forget that day, because even though the -- the Russian front was on the east side of the\nOda river, which runs north-south and about 50 to 60 miles east of Berlin, so it was pretty far\naway, but the artillery barrage was such that the ground under Berlin, under the city, was\nrumbling and slightly shaking. And of course, in battle reports, which I read long after the end of\nthe war, I can see the reason why. That was the biggest concentration of artillery ever. The\nRussians spent about two months getting ready for that assault on the city and they had\nassembled a density of artillery which was unheard of. And they raked the entire German front\nfor hours and hours. As I said, that -- at that time I was living in the Berlin borough of\nTemplehoff and through the Communist, I mean secretly Communist janitor of the house that I\nlived in, I also got some information of how the folkshdum members were called up and in fact\nhe showed me such a call up order that a friend of his got. So I-I kept a copy of that and then\ntyped on a typewriter that I had available, my own call up order, every day. So that if I had to -- I\nhad an errand to a certain part of the city, I would write myself a call up order that I had to report\nthere for duty. The reason was that there were -- I mean groups of folkshdum people either\ngrabbing civilians from the street, or also sometimes they are confiscating their bicycle, yeah. I-I\ndid all of my -- or almost all of my commuting by bicycle. Public transport had all but ceased to\nexist. There were still a few subway lines that were -- would run intermittently between a few\nstops until they came to a place where there was an artillery or a bomb crater, shutting down the -\n- the rest of the line. So that was surely not reliable transport. But the folkshdum did have the\npower to confiscate bicycle for service, so I always -- I wrote my marching order always in such\na way that it -- 1t would say I have to appear with my b-bicycle, which for purposes of my\nservice, is confi-confiscated by the folkshdum, the -- the militia. I kept visiting a number of\nfriends and there was a peculiar atmosphere then. By -- by that time the Russians were still far\naway from Berlin, but nobody knew how the Russians would take the city, what would happen\nafterwards. After all, the city was still totally dominated by the Nazis, not just the military, also\npropaganda-wise. Goebbels's voice was everywhere, in -- in newspapers, on the radio. And it -- it\nseemed as if a deep chasm sort of separated us -- our today, from what would happen tomorrow\nafter the Nazis are gone and nobody could really imagine how it would be like. From day to day\nof course, the Russians worked their way closer to the city and in fact, the way they planned their\nattack, instead of entering the city from the east, they passed -- their units passed by Berlin to the\nnorth and south, and then closed the pincer west of Berlin and -- and then entered the city from\nthe west. After -- and then the joy of hearing German city names in the official army report was\nplaced by the -- replaced by the even greater joy of hearing su-subdivisions and districts of\nBerlin mentioned in the -- in the army report. Like parts of Shallotenburg, which is a well known\nborough of the city, had fallen into Russian hands. Or the suburban railroad station of Eichner\nhas been taken by the Russians. It simply seemed unbelievable that these names, these place\nnames, where I had been sometimes only days before, were already in Russian hands. In fact,\nthere was a curious situation developing. People could make telephone calls into parts of the city\nwhich were already occupied by the Russians, which were behind the Russian lines. That was the\nweirdest thing, really. And visiting people, one usually parted never knowing whether one would\nsee each other again and instead of the German Auf Weidersain, which means really, \u201cSee you\nagain.\u201d One would greet each other, I mean say good-bye with a formaller Ubalips -- that means,\n\u201cSurvive it.\u201d And as I said, nobody could even imagine how life would be once the Nazis were\ngone. Berlin was, of course under constant bombardment and in the beginning, when the first\nartillery shells fell on the city in the -- in -- in the inner parts of the city, Goebbels distributed a\nnews release saying that these are not enemy artillery bombardment, but trial runs of a new\nGerman sort of miracle weapon, which is going to be used any day now, to throw the Russians\nback again. And there were people who believed this nonsense. Yeah, let me -- so the -- the -- the\ncity and of course also electricity slowly stopped being supplied and water stopped being\nsupplied in Berlin, even it -- it had already been drained by evacuation of ma -- children and\ninfirm people. There were still, I think, between three and four million people in the city and to\nimagine, that city was sort of headed into chaos, without -- without running water, without at\nleast reliable electricity and the gas lines on many places were -- had been, of course, hit. And so\nthere was no gas supply any more for cooking. The -- for me the crucial day was Sunday and I\nremember distinctly, Sunday, April 22nd, 1945. On -- by orders of Goebbels, who, besides all his\nother offices, was also in charge of the defense of Berlin, on his orders, all food st-stores were\nordered to be open. Now anyone who knows Germany and German mentality, must be aware\nthat the closing of stores on Sunday, of all stores, was something absolutely holy. There was\nnothing -- there was always one day, one Sunday -- that was the Sunday before Christmas, where\nstores were open, that was a tradition, but on all other Sundays, nothing -- the world had to go\nunder for -- for an order to be issued for stores to be open. And that of course, exactly was what\nwas happening. I mean their world was going under. And it was obvious then, that what\nGoebbels wanted to avoid is that the food stores and the shops might be maybe taken by Russian\ntroops. And rather than have that happen, had to distribute it to the population. And in fact, there\nwas enough food there that he also announced the distribution of all kinds of special rations. See\nhow the -- the ration coupons had -- of course most coupons were dedicated, like 1t would say for\n100 gram of butter or 100 gram of meat or whatever, this and that. But there were certain\ncoupons always which were unassigned. They were just labeled with a letter, like A, B, C or\nsomething, for special occasions. And so, he -- he announced that on coupon A, everybody\nwould get so much of this food and on coupon B, so much of that food. There was a -- a -- a\ntremendous amount of these special rations amounts. Now here I was with my 16 food ration\ncards for 16 people. So I basically went wild. I went -- found -- of course that was in the days\nbefore the supermarket, so in other words, you had to go to the butcher separately and to the\nbaker and to the dairy, for each particular type of food. And so I was busy for a long time, you\nknow, buying all that and coll -- and bringing it into the room which I occupied in -- in\nTemplehoff and thinking how I can get most of it out to Pottsdam, to my friends. And -- and then\n-- but even more overpowering was, that on that day, finally, beaten German army units started\nto stream into Berlin. And that is a sight which I will never forget, I think that made -- that day I\ncan say without equivo-vocation may be the happiest day in my life. Anyone who has seen\nGerman soldiers in -- in an ordinary life or in -- du-during the war or on -- on parades, they\nalways looked spic and span, there was not a button missing, there was not a spot. An-and -- and\nthey all -- an-and they looked well-shaved, clean and -- and with a certain aggressive stride and\ndemeanor. These guys who came back, they were dirty, unshaved. Their uniforms had buttons\nmissing. Many had bloody bandages around their head or their arms in a sling. None of them\nbore any weapons and -- and they had that dull look of defeat in their eyes. Wh-wh-when I saw\nthose guys, I finally -- even though I knew the war was lost for Germany of course, somehow\nintellectually and mentally, but now I saw it with my own eyes and I almost lost my mind. I-I got\non my bike, I remember and bicycled along and felt almost like thanking each of these soldiers\nfor the way they looked. I-I'm somewhat of a history buff and I had read reports of Napoleon's\narmy streaming back from Russia after their defeat in 1812 and -- and these guys looked exactly\nlike those descriptions of Napoleon's defeated army. And -- and then the -- the eerie thing was\nthat now and then truckloads of newly outfitted soldiers, who looked clean and fresh and with\nweapons, drove into the opposite direction, towards the -- towards the front, which was probably\njust, I don't know, 10 or 20 miles or so away, if that much. So -- but then I -- I finally sort of\ngrabbed a hold of myself and -- and went back to the house and this German apartment houses\nare always sort of built with a courtyard in the back and the rumor spread that -- there was one\nperson apparently, who for some reason owned a horse and he couldn't feed that horse anymore\nand so he decided to have it slaughtered by a professional butcher. But of course there was no\nrefrigeration either, so he couldn't say, keep the -- the meat for-forever. So he invited just anyone\nfrom the house to serve himself. So it was incredible, I-I got myself a long, sharp knife and went\ndownstairs and cut a sort of a big chunk out of the upper thigh, or the rear end of -- of the horse,\nof the dead horse that was lying there. And a-as -- as -- as another sort of trophy. And -- and then\nanother rumor spread that was -- th- there -- there was a huge freight yards of the German\nrailroads, about -- less than a mile away from that apartment building and the rumor spread that\nthe Vairmarkt, the German army had just abandoned and withdrawn from the freight yards and\nthat there were many freight cars loaded with food. And then I got on my bike with a knapsack\nand -- and bicycled to the -- to the freight yard and I saw already people streaming there from all\nover and -- and then the -- the freight yard was periodically raked with machine gun fire from\ndeep diving Russian fighter planes. And you know, to avoid being shot, I-I sort of threw the\nbicycle away and -- and I had to -- anyway I wasn't on my bike, it was across tracks, so I-I-I\nwalked, pushed it. And then I-I threw myself down, pressed myself against the -- sort of the --\nwh-what are these, these wooden ties, I guess, the railroad ties and -- until the planes had gone\nand then I would get up. So then I-I came to a -- to a railroad car, which had, was loaded with big\nvats full of butter, so ea-each one, maybe 50 pounds or so. And -- so how do you -- an-and that\nwas sort of solid butter, so how do you grab solid butter? Well, I had a -- I had a huge\nscrewdriver in a tool kit on my bike, so I got that screwdriver out and sort of staked out a huge\nsort of a cube of butter and took 1t with my hands and threw it in my, into my knapsack, which at\nother times, I had taken potatoes in, with dirty peels and -- and -- and coal and so on. So what I\ndecided, if the outer layer of the butter is covered with dirt, I'll just cut off a layer and then inside\nit should be clean. So, anyway -- so then I-I-I took that back and -- and my room that I had in\nthat house was like a veritable sort of food storage place. Incidentally, as a side light, when I\ncame back after the war, I-I was told that maybe half an hour or so after I left that place, the\nfolkshdum turned up there, collected all males, put them on trucks and drove them out to the\nfront. So I was spared having to fight the Russians. And -- and then I decided I-I better get al --\no-o-on the one hand I didn't want to get out of Berlin, because I felt a tremendous inner\nexcitement, to see the fall of a major capital, which had a sort of world dominating role played,\nwas to me like -- see, witnessing the fall of Rome to the Germanic tribes, whatever, 2000 years\nor so earlier and that filled me with excitement. But on the other hand, I -- I really felt that I\nwanted to spend these hours with Margaret and so I-I finally -- what I did is I wrote myself a\nmarching order for the folkshdum, which said that my battalion that I belonged to, had to report\nfor duty in Pottsdam, which I h-had earlier mentioned, the suburb where Margaret and her\nparents had found a place. And I put as much into the knapsack as I could, I mean the more s --\nvulnerable things of course, were the butter and also the -- the chunk of horsemeat. And -- and\nthen a few other things, I don -- I-I forgot what it was, anyway, was a knapsack just full with\nfood and -- and by that time also, the army had taken over traffic control and at each major\nintersection, there were transportation officers directing traffic of course, what there was was the\ntraffic was all military by that time. Military trucks and -- and jeeps and this sort of thing. And\nthere was a major intersection near the house where I lived and I-I went up to the officer in\ncharge and told him that I had been ordered to report into Pottsdam and whether he knew\nwhether the highway to Pottsdam was still open or whether the Russians had cut it. By the way,\nthe Russians then were always referred to by their nickname, Ivan. So -- Ivan in English. So -- I -\n- that's how you talked about them, with a Ivan, because no -- nobody really knew it and -- and\nthe officers answer was that he knows only what goes on within a radius as far as he can see in\neach direction. And he -- he didn't under -- it was just total chaos. And -- and -- and those idiots\nwere still fighting and -- and defending the city. And by the way, at each of these intersections,\nlike that also, there were heavy guns and -- put into place, that -- so that in case Russian tanks\nwould appear, they would immediately be subject to heavy artillery fire. So anyway, I decided, I\nmean to see whether I can get through to Pottsdam, there were rumors that the Russians had\nalready cut that highway. And I got on my bike and with my marching orders and everything and\n-- and set out. And that trip to Pottsdam was a -- a -- a major experience. Th-the -- the -- the\nhighway was mobbed, Pottsdam was in the direction sort of southwest of Berlin. In other words,\nsort of away from the eastern front and it was full with people. And -- and all kinds. There were\ngroups of allied soldiers, I mean British and French, who were obviously prisoners of war and\nwhich you had seen throughout the war, always in groups, but under heavy German military\nguard. These guys, they were simply walking down there, no-nobody even, they were part of the\npopulation, nobody even gave a damn that they were supposed to be under German military\nguard. I suppose they were trying to get home or something. There were foreign laborers. There\nwere people who pushed, sort of some belongings they wanted to save, in -- in baby carriages or\nin little wagons that they pulled. And then -- now and then a -- a fancy, big Mercedes, with the\ndriver leaning on the horn to make way, was slowly making its way, getting some big shot out of\nthe city before the Russians would take it. And then, in the midst of all of that, periodically,\nRussian fighter planes would st-swoop down and rake the street with machine gun fire and then\neverybody, like on a -- a -- as even blown away by the wind, would vanish to the sides of the\nroad. And there are sort of rainwater ditches on each side, and lie down there until that danger\nwas over, then get back up and walk. It was the most incredible, it was a -- a -- the -- part of it I\nbicycled, part I pushed. Yeah, there were some areas where there was a b -- one area, I think,\nwhere a water main was broken and the -- the water was almost knee high. So you had to wade\nthrough that and -- anyway -- and -- and then finally I arrived at the bridge which connected\nBerlin to Pottsdam, the -- there was actually, at the western outskirts of Berlin is a -- there was a\nhavel, spelled exactly by the way, the same way as the name of the president of the Czech\nRepublic, H-a-v-e-l. That river also separates Berlin and Pottsdam, there's a bridge leading over\nit and that's how you get then, from Berlin into Pottsdam. The name of the bridge is Gleenic\narburger and -- which became famous several decades later, which I couldn't have known at that\ntime, of course. It's famous because that's where, often, spies were exchanged. Yeah, that was, of\ncourse, West Berlin, then. What -- what became later West Berlin and among others for example,\nthe Jewish refusnik Anatoly Sharunski, now an Israeli minister, Nathan Sharunski was\nexchanged there and given freedom on that bridge. Well, anyway, at that bridge, I saw already, at\nthe distance, was completely, there was a -- like a chain across the bridge, of SS, checking\ncarefully everybody's papers. So -- but I had my folkshdum ID and my marching orders to report\nto Pottsdam, so I figured nothing can happen. I-I had in my breast pocket also, the gun which I\nhad bought on the black market, through that janitor, but I was hoping not to have to use it. And\nof course there was such a sea of humanity, they obviously didn't really have the time anyway to\ndo very thorough checks, but they found my papers to be in order and -- and then I-I passed\nthrough and I had to still bicycle through a major part of Pottsdam, because the park of\nSoswasee, where that orangery building was located, was on the other side of Pottsdam and --\nand then I appeared there and they had already almost given up hope that I would be able to get\nout of Berlin. So that was the 22nd. But I had still a lot of food left in the -- in the apartment, so I\ndecided the next day, I ought to go back and -- and pick up some more food. And when I arrived\nat the Gleenic Arburger to bicycle across, the commanding officer told not just me, but\neverybody else, that Russians were reported nearby -- oh yeah, and -- and of course all bridges\nhad been -- had been supplied with explosive charges, so that at the approach of Russian troops,\nthey would be blown up so that they couldn't use the bridges. That was another part of the\ninsanity, because while the Russians could have used the bridge, these bridges also were part of\nthe German infrastructure, which at that time was already almost totally destroyed and -- and\nunder those conditions, with a -- a lack of raw materials and so on, wasn't easily re-buildable in -\n- in those days. But -- but the Germans and -- and particular the Nazi party fa -- we-were so\nfanatic, that they completely disregarded the needs of their own population, even. But I mean,\nthey had it coming. The -- with all of that, I -- my thoughts always go back again to the period of\nthe deportations. And how brutally the Jews were treated and nobody gave a damn about them\neither at that time. And -- and furthermore, I didn't even know yet, what had become of my\nparents and everybody else who had been close to me or whom I had known and I was still\nhoping to see them back once that whole thing was over. And I decided t-to go across the bridge\nanyway, hoping that they wouldn't dynamite it soon.",
        "Q: It's okay, it's okay.",
        "A: Oh. And -- but then I was finally stopped, as I said, when I came to Pottsdam the day before,\nthere was a place where a water main had broken and the water was almost knee high. Where by\nth-the next day I came back, it was even higher and it was under a bridge. And I mean that, it\nwas practically impossible to -- you'd have to swim across and of course I would have been\ncompletely wet then and -- anyway, I didn't have the stomach to do it, so -- and how would I\nhave taken the bike through it? So I just returned without having been able to get into the city\nagain. Th-There was constant artillery bombardment of course. The 22nd, by that time, was over.\nThat was the day when I went out. Now the day where I made the unsuccessful attempt to return,\nwas the 23rd. So that is over now, then there were several days -- there were several days of -- of\nfighting and -- and finally on the twent -- yeah -- and final -- yeah -- wh-what we had to do also\nis, we finally decided -- we meaning all of the people who lived there as refugees, to transfer to\nthe basement. There was a huge basement with s-sort of simple benches and actually no\nelectricity, only some candles we had occasionally. And we just sort of hoped to wait out the\nworst danger. On the 27th of April, there was still no change, there was still artillery rumble and\n-- but we didn't know what was going on. So I decided I ought to go out and look and see what\nthe situation is. I went out and didn't see a soul until I finally saw a man in what looked to me\nlike the uniform of the -- an engineering battal -- the German army had engineering battalions\nwhich had sort of brownish type uniforms, which were used in support of the troops. I mean, to -\n- to build more quickly, bridges over rivers and things like that. And so I-I shouted at the guy and\nwanted to -- to know where -- wh-whether he knew where Ivan is. His response was to point his\ngun at me and shout back at me in a language that I had never heard before. And run toward me\nas I stood there with my raised arms and then he grabbed my left arm, saw the watch, gave it a\nstrong jerk, pulled the watch off and vanished again. So from that I knew that the Russians had\narrived, which I related downstairs. And from then on we frequently were visited by Russians\nwho came down there. They were interested only in two things. One was the women and the\nother one was possessions of any value. They took everybody's watches of course and other\nvaluables and -- and many women were taken, not just once, but innumerable times. And -- and\nso that went on for a day or two and -- and of course caused everyone to be totally demoralized\nand -- and then I think on -- on the second day or so, I -- there -- there was an artillery unit\nactually stationed in front of the orangery building, fighting was still going on in the\nneighborhood. And that artillery unit was under the command of a colonel who made a more\neducated impression than the run of the mill Russian soldiers. And in particular, he spoke fairly\nfluent German. And -- so Margaret's father went up to him and introduced himself and told him\nthat -- that we are Jews, whether -- that's the first Russian word that I learned, Jew means Yvrai\nin -- in Russian. And -- and we were treated just like the Germans, even though we had suffered\nunder them, just the same way the Russians. So the colonel pulled out a piece of paper and wrote\nsomething down in Russian and said whenever in the future, Russians sort of try to attack us or\nmolest us, to show that paper. And okay -- and then he -- he got orders to move on, which he did.\nAnd then -- now unbeknownst to me also, by the way, the -- the Russian commander in the area,\nhad ca-called on all German forces to surrender and furthermore had, i-in that order also, had\ndeclared that any German who tries to eva -- any German soldier who tries to evade captivity by\nputting on civilian clothes, will be treated by the Soviet armed forces exactly the same way as he\nwould have been treated by the German forces. And the German force -- the German forces, I\nmean that was already going on for months. Any deserter was, after a brief re -- cursory so called\nmilitary tribunal, was immediately hung from a tree and with a sign around his neck, I am too\nmuch of a coward to fight for my country and -- and for our women and children. And -- or\nsomething of that nature. In other words, what it meant is that if a German civilian was found, he\ncould be immediately executed by the Russians, because they would interpreted that as the guy\nbeing a deserter, trying to evade captivity. So I was out, on -- on that day and that was about, I\nthink a day after that colonel came, either the same day, later or the next day. And a-again, a\nRussian soldier was in the neighborhood, whereas -- as soon as he saw me, he pointed his gun at\nme and -- and pointed me toward a tree. As I said, it was in a park there. And I saw immediately\nthat he was going to execute me. So I shouted down into the basement for Margaret's father to\ncome up, because he had that paper that that Russian colonel had -- had given him, in Russian.\nAnd he came running up and handed the paper to that Russian soldier. He looked at it and made\na motion with it, as if he was wiping his rear end with it, sort of put it in his fist and crumpled it\nup and threw it away and told him to wait there too. Then I stood at the tree while he aimed at\nme. And at that moment, the only thing I could think of is, I survived the Nazis and now I end up\nlike this. And I could hear the click of the trigger, but nothing came out and he did that two or\nthree times and then he got mad and sort of threw his gun on the floor and shouted to me at\nRussian -- in -- in Russian, which I didn't understand and pointing at the tree, what it obviously\nmeant, that I should wait for him there at the tree, to be shot when he comes back with a different\ngun. And of course then Margaret's father and I, we immediately ran -- there was some bushes\nnot too far away and hid sort of right at the bottom there. And it wasn't long, I don't know, maybe\nfive minutes, maybe less, I don't -- when he came back and -- and we heard him shout and I was\njust sweating with fear. And we know that wouldn't be long until he found us and all we heard is\nhe kept shouting and then new voices appeared, more voices and -- which -- wa -- since we didn't\nknow Russian, I don't know what all these voices were saying, but apparently they had to move\non because the voices became more and more distant and -- and then finally ceased. And -- but\nwe decided that maybe the guy is just lying in wait for us, so we -- we waited there for at least an\nhour, if not more. And -- co -- wa-was completely silent, until we were sure that he really had\nleft the area.\nEnd of Tape Seven, Side A\nBeginning of Tape Seven, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape two, side B, of an interview with Ernest Fontheim, on June fourth, 1997.",
        "A: So we finally emerged from there and there was not a soul around. Then we went back into\nthe basement and there was a tremendous shout of relief. Apparently, downstairs, somebody\nmust have seen the Russian soldier pointing his gun at me, so the rumor had spread that both of\nus had been shot. And -- so when we appeared alive, obviously the joy was great. So then, finally\ncame the first of May, 1945. And the first of May, of course, is a big Russian holiday, a Soviet\nholiday and -- and it was for the soldiers. By that time, things had sort of quieted down a little\nbit, although not too much and a large group of soldiers visited us. It somehow spread around\nthat Margaret's father, who was in general very handy, was also very good in some simple sort\nof dressing up wounds and things like that. And we had, of course for our own purposes, all\nkinds of medical supplies. And there were some soldiers who had, I don't know what it was any\nmore, some open flesh wounds flumow and anyway, he treated them. And then there was also a\npiano around for some reason and he played the piano and to celebrate them, he played the s-\nsong, \u201cThe Internationale,\u201d which is the sort of international Communist party song. And that\nmade them all very happy and -- and they became sort of somewhat friendly and then one -- I\nremember one soldier, he was a -- a giant of a guy, pulling out of a -- a dirty pocket, some\nequally dirty photographs of -- were obviously family pictures. Wife, children or something. And\nwith -- with tears streaming down his face, he said they were all killed by the Germans. And --\nand then after awhile, they said they needed all of the women to co-come along. And then so\nobviously we were very uneasy about that and then we said, you know, what they wanted -- I\nmean there was very difficult communication, obviously. None of us spoke Russian and they\nonly knew sort of a s-smattering of some German words. Anyway, it turned out they had nearby,\nsort of a -- some battalion or regiment camped and to prepare for their meal, they needed people\nto peel potatoes. And so we immediately, all of u -- males, volunteered to go and so they took the\nwomen and the men along to about, I don't know, it wasn't far away, a quarter of a mile or so,\nwhere they were camped and put us down and they had piles and piles of potatoes. And so we --\nwe peeled potatoes for them. And in fact they had discovered apparently somewhere, a storage\nshed that was full with potatoes. And one d -- and they needed more from there. One of the\nRussian soldiers took Margaret's father along to help him carry them in a-- 1n a sack or\nsomething. And when they opened the door of the shed, the first thing, before they even saw the\npotatoes, there was a dead German woman lying. So the soldiers just -- soldier kicked her away\nwith his foot and said something like \u201cKaput,\u201d which is a German word for broken. And then\nthey gathered the potatoes and -- and -- and brought them back. And -- and then we peeled\npotatoes and then we were actually taken back by them. Oh, while we -- while we -- while we\npeeled the potatoes, they had accordion players there, they -- they played the accordion and sang\nsongs, so for awhile it became even somewhat romantic and they also gave us some meat dishes\nto eat, which was hearty and -- even if not exactly gourmet style, but we were always hungry in\nthose days and would have eaten anything. And -- and then we were taken back by them again,\nto the -- to the orangery where we all stayed. But I mean, there were also, still, less pleasant\nincidents and robberies and so on. So a day or two later, I decided that we need really, some\nmore firm protection, that by now, since the city, there was no more fighting, even nearby, there\nmust be a city commander. And so I-I-I got up -- out, and said that I will try to find where the\ncommander is and see whether we can get some protection. And of course I had no idea wh -- th-\nthe city picture was totally changed. You know, a few days before, the last time I walked in the\ncity, it was full with Nazi party uniforms, SS, Vairmarkt uniforms. All of that has vanished as if\nswallowed up by the earth and all one saw was Russian uniforms. And the traffic was -- the\ntraffic police, they were all women, usually very hefty looking women. Their most prominent\nfeature, they were all unbelievably heavily bosomed and they carried two sort of colored sticks, I\nremember. I think one red, one yellow, which they waved in some prescribed form, with the left\nhand and with the right hand, indicating which direction could move and which had to halt. And\nactually they did it in a very snappy, military fashion. I enjoyed actually looking on, just seeing\nthem perform these duties. Now, in the meantime, in order to f-find the -- where the commandant\n-- the commandature was. Commandature is a Russian word actually, meaning the command\noffice for the -- for the city commander. And I was always pointed in some direction, so I just\nkept going in the direction that I was pointed at, until I arrived in front of a huge villa and that\nvilla was beleaguered by a huge -- by, actually by two huge throngs. As I found out in a minute,\none were Germans and the other one were foreigners. Practically all of them false laborers who\nhad been deported to Germany and who obviously went there for help in trying to get back to\ntheir home countries. There were Frenchmen, Belgians, Poles, e-e-everyone. And -- and the other\nthrong were Germans. The one person I remember was a German medical officer, who was in\ncharge of the local military hospital where -- I mean the Russians left him in charge -- these were\nall soldiers with fairly heavy wounds. He came to complain that his nurses were being constantly\nraped and therefore could not fulfill their duties to the patients. And I decided immediately not to\nidentify myself with the Germans, so I stood with the foreign laborers. Oh yeah, and I forgot to\nmention also, we had -- when we left that village overnight, we had taken along also, all our real\nidentifications, so that -- because obviously we knew the war would end within days or weeks,\nthat we could then establish our true identities. And, among other things I also had saved my\nJewish star, which I then put on. And as I said -- and I -- I waited there together with all the\nforeigners. And so it was of course a slow process. So finally 1t was my turn, I was ushered in\nand was in some sort of a front room, entry room or waiting room, whatever and was told to wait\nand then one, from -- behind it, apparently, was a real office and then one officer came and took\na look at me with that star and sort of shouted something in Russian to the back and then an\nofficer with sort of more stars and so on, who seemed to be the commander, came out. He was\nsort of a short, stocky, heavy-set guy. Took one look at me and -- and then asked me in fairly\ngood German, \u201cYou are a Jew?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes.\u201d And then he -- he ran toward me, embraced\nme and -- and told, sorry -- told me that I was the first Jew whom he -- whom he saw in -- in\nweeks or months. There was n-no Jew left anywhere... Okay, then he -- he asked me in his office\nand sit down and told me that, to tell him how come that I wasn't killed. So I briefly told him\nwhat had happened to me and -- and also that I was actually together with a family of friends and\nthat we needed some personal protection and then he -- he told me I should, as soon as possible,\nbring the whole family, he wants to meet them. Oh, and -- and of course, I forgot, his name was\nMajor Shike and of course, he was a Jew himself... So yeah, the only thing then at there, before I\nleft, he asked me, he said he -- he wants to keep my yellow star as a souvenir. So I gladly gave\nthat to him. And then I went back and I forgot, either the same day or the next day, all four of us\nwent there and met Major Shike again and he award us a piece of paper in Russian. That one was\nnot thrown away by anyone, in fact I still have it among my souvenirs and in fact I never knew\nwhat it really said and of course, with the Russian immigration to this country here during the\nlast decade or so, we also -- we made some Russian friends in Ann Arbor and I had that guy\ntranslate it to me, for the first time -- what, 40 years after Major Shike gave it to me. And it -- it\nsimply said that every possible protection is give -- to be given to the Jackass -- fact he ordered\nin one word, I guess he didn't realize that it was a first and a last name, family and -- and also\nthat we are supposed to be supplied generously with food. Oh, yeah, he told us also that the\nSoviet army was soon going to start handing out food to the population and they will be very\nsmall, restricted rations, you know, like so many crumbs of bread and this and that. And so there\nwill also be long lines. But with that piece of paper, first of all, we did not have to stand in line,\nbut we could right away go to the counter and also, we -- we should buy whatever we thought or\nneeded to buy. And regardless of what the official rations are. And you can imagine the pride we\n-- after years of being always kicked to the back, now we could go to the front and the Germans\nhad to stay behind and wait. And so that went on for -- I mean then our -- our life go-got much\nbetter and we were not molested any more. But the next thing was of course, we wanted to get\nback to Berlin. And so I guess we had to find out whether there is a suburban railroad line going\nfrom Pottsdam to Berlin. And so I suggested, I-I wrote to the railroad station, which was also\nseveral miles -- that castle was somewhat out of town, of Pottsdam. And to check the railroad\nstation and where the trains are going. And when I got to the railroad station, 1t was an incredible\npicture of destruction. Somebody should have painted or at least photographed it, but of course\nin those days we didn't have a camera and I don't have a talent for a painter. But the -- the -- the\nrailroad, there was hardly any railroad car that was standing on its wheels, they were lying on\ntheir sides, there were bomb craters all over and one locomotive apparently, must have been --\ndue to some force of some explosion, was standing on its heads wi -- on -- on the front end, with\nthe wheels o-on the side, a totally grotesque picture. And -- and wires were hanging and signal I-\nlights were dangling down or overturned. I mean you had to take one look and know not only\nthat nothing is running now, but that nothing would be running for weeks probably or months or\nlonger. So I walked back to give that report and on the way back, along one of the streets, I saw a\nsizable group of Germans, coming under guard by -- by two Russians, one Russian in front with\na gun over the shoulder and one Russian behind. And they were wearing not the usual army\nuniform. I mean it looked similar to the army uniform, except that their military hats were green.\nAnd these were actually the NK VD troops, which -- they were the forerunner of what later\nbecame KGB. And so I walked -- I mean I walked along and they came toward me and as they\nwere -- as they were passed me, the soldier in front asked me for my papers. And I-I had my\nJewish ID and naively I thought, you know, the guy knows immediately that -- you know, it\ndidn't say Jew, it just has a J printed on top of it. And furthermore, of course it was in the Roman\nletters, which are used 1-1n German and not in Cyrillic, which the Russians use. Anyway, he\ndidn't even look at the -- at the ID, he took the ID, put it in his uniform pocket and -- and told me\n-- I guess there were only a few words he knew in German, one of them was com. That means\ncome. And then I tried to tell him that Y-Yvrai and he just waved me off. So -- so then I\nsuddenly found myself a prisoner of the NK VD. And we walked for several blocks and I noticed,\nit seemed totally random. There were some Germans whom we let pass by and then again one he\nwould take along. I-I couldn't figure out what, if any -- principle governed his a -- and by now,\nhaving seen the Russians operate, I'm sure it was random, that there was no principle involved.\nSo anyway, we finally stopped at a large villa, which was -- had been confiscated by the\nRussians. And on the side of the -- w-we walked over to the side. On the side of the villa, a table\nwas set -- oh I'm sorry -- a table was set up and behind that table, there was a -- an officer, also\nwith a green hat, n-next to a civilian. And -- and we were sort of lined up in -- in -- in front, on\nthe other side of the table at a certain distance. And then we were called up, one by one, to sit\ndown -- there was one chair across from them, to sit down and being asked questions. When it\ncame to my turn -- and by the way, the officer, the interrogating officer looked exactly like a\nbrutal SS man, except the uniform was different. When it came to my turn, he asked -- the\nquestions were asked by him in Russian, by the way and the civilian next to him was an\ninterpreter, then he gave it to me in German. And they were all very standard, harmless question.\nMy name, my address, my father's name, that sort of thing, date of birth. And after the last\nquestion, then he turned that thing that he had filled out, that sheet of paper, over to me and --\nand asked me to sign at the bottom. Now, not only was everything that he filled out and so on, in\nCyrillic, but then there was a long paragraph below the filled out part, of text. So I pushed that\nthing over to the interpreter and asked him politely to inter -- I wanted to know what I'm signing,\nyou know. Interpret it to me. But instead of translating it in -- into German, he told the officer\nthat I wanted it translated. And then the officer barked something that didn't sound very\nappealing to me and then the interpreter said, \u201cHe says,\u201d you know, \u201cmy boss says, if you don't\nsign it right away, he beat you to death right here on the spot.\u201d So I signed it and was convinced\nat that time and somewhat even today still, that I probably signed that I volunteer to go to\nSiberia. And so then, an-and actually, a few of the people after that interrogation ended were sent\nhome. Others were not and of course I was in the latter group. Then we were, after we were\nthrough with all of them, we were led around to the back and in the back yard there was an air\nraid shelter ditch, which the Germans had dug during the war, to protect, I mean, against air\nraids. And what it was is, it's a ditch, you know, about I would say, about three yards wide and\nabout five feet -- five feet deep at most, maybe a little bit less. And then over it was a sort of pre-\ncast concrete sort of arch that extended the length of the ditch. So an-and that pre-cast concrete\narch then, would be covered, or was covered with earth and something planted on it, so that it\nwas camouflaged, but you could go in for protection of that against bombs or artillery and so on.\nAnd they used it now as a prison. Of course it was totally damp -- yeah and the-there were\nbenches in there, but it was very damp and unpleasant. And -- and then there was a guard with a\ngun at the exit. And the only reason to -- for anyone to go out is, if somebody had to do some\nbusiness and the guard who stood there knew only one German word, we were told and -- and\nthat is shisin, which is the German slang word, actually the total equivalent of, in English, means\nshitting. So -- what did -- if -- if somebody had to go, then they was taken out and what they had\nrigged up there is, between two trees, they had fastened a horizontal broom, at about sitting\nheight or chair height. And you just had to sort of sit over that broom, holding on with your\nhands and do whatever you had to do and then go back again in-into that ditch. And after a few\nhours, we were even brought some food. It was in -- in a bucket, which is used in Germany, or I\nguess here too, for say, washing floors and th-they had in there some nondescript soup, with a\nfew pieces of meat sort of floating around in it... Yeah, then later that day, I mean that was all\nstill in the morning and then we get something at noon, that -- that food and then the afternoon,\nsomebody shouted down, \u201cAll Germans out.\u201d Again, there were Germans and non-Germans that\nthey had collected them and the non-Germans were al-always the forced laborers that the\nGermans had deported into Germany. But anyway, all Germans were called out and I\nimmediately decided, you know, I'm not a German and so I stayed in there. And they were\nactually taken out to peel potatoes for the Russians, you know it was a fairly large group of\npolicemen and investigators and so on. And after they were finished, they were told, okay now\nthey can go home. Then I thought I could hit myself over the head. If I would have gone out with\nthe Germans, I would be out and free now. Well, it was a wrong guess. And then, the night came\nand we had to sort of seat -- sleep sitting up on that -- that bench, in -- in that damp atmosphere\nthere, as well as one could and the next day, the next day the various people were called up for\nmore interrogation. Yeah and then I had sort of started up some sort of a talking\nacquaintanceship with a Czech engineer, who had been taken by the Germans to work on some\nwar plant. And so he was called up and he -- he was brought down by the guard after whatever,\nmaybe a half an hour and he was hardly down and had sat down and he looked already very\ndisturbed, when another officer, who looked also extremely brutal, appeared with a -- he had sort\nof a baton and -- and a sort of wooden stick in front, 1-in his hand, waved it in front of that Czech\nguy and shouted at him in Russian, something that didn't sound very pleasant. And when he was\ngone, the Czech guy told me that the Russians, during the interrogation, told him that they have\nevidence that he was not forcibly deported, but that he volunteered to work for the Germans. And\nof course he denied that and it wasn't true, he said. And that guy who came down, shouted at\nhim, \u201cIf you don't admit the truth, that you volunteer t-to work for the Germans, you'll stay down\nhere until you starve of -- of -- of hunger.\u201d And -- and th-then he told me yeah, I mean he -- he --\nby the way, he knew Russian also, that Czech guy. He told me -- you know I had told him a little\nbit about my story, that, \u201cthey probably won't believe that you are a Jew, either.\u201d Anyway, later\nthat day, be -- before I was even interrogated, we were all called out and marched off. And I\nthought now actually, that we are headed toward someplace where we were being shipped off\ninto the Soviet Union. And I was sort of looking around, whether there would be a way, quick --\nmake a quick escape. There was just -- there were two soldiers, one in front and one bringing up\nthe rear, each one with a gun who -- and it would have had to be somewhere where, you know,\nthey couldn't immedia -- anyway, it never came to that, we only walked about two or three\nblocks and then we were asked to sit down on the street in front of an even bigger villa, which\nwas also occupied by these same green-hated soldiers. And then we were called up one by one\ninto the building for interrogation and some people actually, after they came out, left. Apparently\nthey were told to be free and others came back and joined us. And when -- when I was called in,\nthere were two interrogators and they struck me immediately, sort of totally different. But see the\nRussians which I had come across so far, all were s-sort of looked pretty uncivilized and -- and --\nand brutal in a sort of a raw way. These two guys, they also looked brutal, but they were well\nshaved. They looked brutal, maybe sounds funny to say, in the SS way. They had elegant\nuniforms, they talked fluent German, they seemed to be very educated, but -- made a ruthless\nimpression that way. But -- anyway they --they wanted to know, you know, who I am, which I\ntold them and then exactly as that Czech had predicted, they told me that they won't believe that I\nam Jewish and in fact that they have some evidence that I had -- was working under orders to\nblow up bridges to delay the Russian advance and how I could prove that I'm Jewish. And then I\ns -- I told them, well you have my papers, you know th-they confiscated. Then they both\nlaughed, indicating, you know, these days, anyone has forged papers, so. And then I was sent\ndown into the basement of that villa. The basement was of course, concrete floor, covered with a\nthin layer of straw and I was greeted there by a chorus of other Germans, \u201cAh, a-a new one\ncoming in.\u201d And of course, in lying there with those guys I found out one of them was th-the\nlocal Nazi party district leader, had sort of the same position as that guy that we had then. And I-\nI said, sort of to myself, you know, what an irony, you know. Here I am in prison now, with guys\nlike those, like that. And -- and then we were also again fed some nondescript food and people\nwere constantly being called up for interrogation upstairs. And then night fell and then the guard\nwould periodically come into the cellar and shine a flashlight into people's faces, looking for a\nparticular individual and then gave in up and the next morning I was called up again and -- and\nthe same two guys were there and they immediately took me und-under sharp questioning and\nsaid whether I had changed my mind and I'm willing to tell the truth now. And I told them that I\n-- that I -- that is the truth and then one guy sort of walked up to me and said, \u201cYou know, I tell\nyou one thing, we have more -- too many of your types of Jews in the Soviet Union, and they're -\n- you are all the same. You don't want to work, but you want others to work. You want other\npeople to work for you. If one thing, we'll teach you guys to -- how to work.\u201d And then, with that\nhe lifted his jack-booted foot and gave me a -- a powerful kick into my rear end, \u201cNow get\ndown.\u201d And the guard took me down again. And then other people were called up and I forgot\nwhether there was a third night or not, but anyway, the next time I was called up, the guard who\ndid the bringing up, came into the basement, pulled his pistol a-and shouted into the room.\nUsually he called by name, now he shouted, \u201cWhere is the Jew?\u201d So I got up and he pulled his\npistol and said, \u201cYou are going to be shot now.\u201d An-And that d-didn't sound real to me, because\nthey weren't shooting people there, you know? And anyway, as I-I walked ahead of him, he sort\nof pressed the muzzle of his gun into my back, but somehow at that point I wasn't afraid, I-I-I-I\nsort of felt that was just a ruse. And when I came up, there were these same two guys and they\nagain asked me whether I had a change in mind and whether I'm ready to tell them the truth. And\nI -- I said, \u201cThat is the truth.\u201d And then -- then they asked, \u201cWell, how could you prove that you\nare a Jew?\u201d So I-I said, \u201cWell, I know some Hebrew.\u201d So upon which one of them rattled\nsomething in -- in Yiddish. Then -- then I said, \u201cBut that wasn't Hebrew, that was Yiddish.\u201d Then\nhe said, \u201cOh? What's the difference?\u201d So I explained the difference to him and then he smiled\nand then he said, \u201cWell what -- what -- what do you -- what Hebrew do you know?\u201d You know,\nin -- in -- in that moment, the only thing I could think of was a Shema, which I recited. And then\nthey both laughed and then it suddenly struck me, these guys are Jews. And -- and then they were\njust instantaneously switched, they were extremely polite, told me to sit down and I must be\nhungry after that ordeal and they -- they barked some orders at some guy outside. And it was in\nfive minutes he came with delicious rolls with s -- sausage and salami and -- and then we had a\nconversation, then he asked me what I want to do and I told him werwidden. And then he said\nwell okay, I-I should get out of there an-and -- and go home. Now the thing is this, on the day --\nthat all started when I was looking for the -- when I was looking for the railroad station and I had\na light coat on and that coat, of course I had left downstairs in the -- in the cellar, in the\nbasement. But during the days that I was down there, you know, you hear all kinds of stories,\nthey were telling of -- of somebody who was released by the guys upstairs, who also had\nforgotten some personal belongings in -- in the basement and said he wants to retrieve it, but the\nguard had a change in mind, you know and -- and just told the guy he's not letting him out again,\neven though the officer upstairs there. So I figured, to hell with my coat, I am free and that's\nmore important. But of course, in those days, even a coat, a simple coat was a -- somewhat of a\nfortune, but my freedom was even more valuable. I-I forgot to mention, by the way, that when,\non the first day, when those Germans were asked to peel potatoes and then released, I managed\nto tell one of them the address where the Haas family were living there in the orangery and to\nnotify them where I am, because you know, they had no idea. So when I came back, you know,\nthey knew over there, that guy had actually notified them and they had gone to Major Shike, you\nknow, hoping that all that needs to be done, that he has to pull some strings to get me out. And\nwhen they told him where I was, he immediately backed off and said, \u201cWell, there's nothing that\n-- these guys knows wh -- know what they are doing,\u201d and he cannot interfere. So, that's an\ninteresting sidelight on the system, was exactly the way with the Gestapo in -- in -- 1n -- in -- in\nNazi Germany of course. Okay, so anyway, after all of that, we knew that no trains were running\nto Berlin, but that's where we wanted to get to. And then -- in the meantime, our bicycle of\ncourse, had been stolen by the Russians. It was th -- after the watch, was the next thing. So I\ncouldn't even bicycle to Berlin, but I suggested that I walk to Berlin, was about, I forgot, must be\n25 miles or so. And -- and go to the Templehoff district, where I had that room and sort of see\nwhat's going on. So I walked there and right when I got there, I-I found out first of all, that the\nRussians had already instituted a German civilian administration and in the borough, sort of city\nor each -- yeah, Berlin has 20 boroughs, you know, th-that borough of Templehoff where that\napartment was in, then had its own city hall and so I went up there and I found out that they have\nlists o-0-of -- of Nazis, particularly Nazis who had more prominent positions. And their\napartments are available for people who are returning from concentration camps, that were\npersecuted. So the guy told me that all I have to do 1s ask for a list and I can pick the apartment I\nwant to have. And of course I didn't want to make a decision so I just stayed one night and then\nwalked back again and then there's another one or two days and then I -- I walked with\nMargaret's father, Mr. Haas, to Berlin. There we had a -- another incident, while we were\nwalking on the -- this major highway, I mean that also goes through suburban city streets toward\nBerlin. We saw already at a distance -- there was a big hospital there and -- and the Russians,\nyou could see were busy there, carrying equipment out. And -- but as we come closer, we could\nsee that they were basically Russian guards and German civilians carrying equipment. And so, as\n-- as we got there, the Russian guard immediately enlisted us to also help carry out equipment\nfrom the -- they were dismantling the entire hospital and we had to go in and carry out whatever\nmedical supplies and -- and so on.\nEnd of Tape Seven, Side B\nBeginning of Tape Eight, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape three, side A, of an interview with Ernest Fontheim, on June fourth, 1997. The\ninterviewer is Randy Goldman.",
        "A: Yeah, so -- I mean, we were not exactly excited by this prospect, particularly since we figured\nif they need us here to load that truck, somewhere they must have a railroad sighting, where the\ntruck then has to be unloaded into railroad cars and we didn't want to be taken there. Now again I\nhad really a unbelievable stroke of luck. It turns out that one of the nurses in that hospital, was a\nnurse who at one time, my grandmother had -- I forgot for what reason my grandmother was\nparalyzed toward the last years of her life. Anyway, she knew me and she knew our family. And\nso I-I told -- we had a chance to chat and then she told us to -- when we ca -- to bring down now\nwhatever we were taking dow -- told to take down and when we come up, to see her in a certain\nroom number. So that's where we went and then she conducted us to some rear staircase, in the\nrear of the building, that the Russians apparently hadn't been aware of, and which let out some\nrear door to a side street, away from that main highway. And then she told us to walk down that\nstreet, several blocks and then turn right and to come back again to the main highway, but sort of\nout of sight of those g-guards there. So that's what we did, so. And -- okay, then we continued\nand then when we came to Berlin, I went with my -- with Margaret's father to the -- to the city\noffice, where I had been a few days before and we were give -- given the list and then we started\nto look at one or two apartments and actually liked one. There -- there was a mother, who was, I\nguess she must have been probably around late 30's, maybe around 40, with two relatively small\nchildren, maybe sort of around, maybe, a young teenager, I think a boy around 13 and a girla\nfew years younger. And, you know, we identified ourselves as -- that we are Jews and that the\nNazis had taken everything we -- away. Oh yeah, by the way, I'm sorry, I have to back up. The\nofficial in the city hall also told us that the people, I mean, who -- apartments are vacated, are not\npermitted to take anything with them, unless we give special permission. And t -- Margaret's\nfather sort of conducted the conversation and he told her that we are, of course, not like the Nazis\nand any personal, I mean we don't want her clothing or -- or that of other family members and --\nor personal items, but all furnishings, all kitchen utensils and those things, have to stay in the\napartment. And -- and to do it sort of on an honor code and we'll be back the next morning to\nclaim the apartment. So that's what we did, we came back the next morning, got a set of keys and\n-- and then took possession of the apartment. And then I-I think through Major Shike or\nsomehow, we got a Russian military truck to take us along, who was going to Berlin anyway,\nalso with all our luggage. I mean you couldn't have -- yeah, I-I mean I-I-I skipped several things,\nyou know, when -- when I say I discussed, when we suddenly had to leave that village there\novernight and we hid all our suitcases in the shed of this elderly couple, Dwuzul. I don't -- I don't\nknow whether I mentioned their name, but their name is Dwuzul anyway. And I picked those up\nby meeting them at a certain railroad station. So we had all our things with us by that time. And\nof course there was no way how we could have gotten to Berlin, you know, with all that stuff if\nwe -- so anyway, that's how we got to Berlin. And then one sort of interesting after development,\nI-I had discussed, quite a bit earlier, the former client of my father, who was also a furrier and\nwhere I went to work once a week on his estate, so long, as a gardener in the fields. And I\nmentioned that he had three Polish forced laborers there. A Polish couple and then a single\nwoman, Maria, who always, every time I came, invited me to her room and fed me and gave me\nfood along. And -- and who I sort of suspected that she might have a crush on me. Well, when I\nvisited the furrier [indecipherable] after the war, he told me an amazing story, he said when the\nRussians came, you know and he lived, of course in an area of big mansions and they were going\neverywhere just emptying places out -- Maria went and sort of got a hold of the first Russian\nofficer and had a long conversation in Russian with him. As a result of which, the officer ordered\nall his -- his troops away from this house and -- and on and he was, nothing happened to his\nplace. And then he -- he asked Maria, \u201cWhat -- what did you tell him?\u201d And, \u201cI-I told him that\nyou are one of the few decent Germans, that you helped enemies of the regime and Jews.\u201d And\nthen he said, \u201cWhat -- what Jews did I help?\u201d Well, you know, I went -- I think I mentioned I\nwent there also under an assumed name. And the name I used there, by the way, was Tsarin1.\nThere was some reason for that, but doesn't make a difference here. And -- and she said, \u201c\u201cWasn -\n- Wasn't Tsarini Jewish?\u201d And he laughed and said, \u201cOf course he was, but how did you know?\u201d\nThen she said, \u201cI know because I am Jewish. My name is not Maria at all. I -- I got Polish\npapers. It was better to be deported to Germany for forced labor than to some concentration\ncamp and I-I immediately recognize a Jew.\u201d And -- and when he told me the story, I felt really\ndumb. That is -- that never occurred to me. And I often wondered what became of Maria, or\nwhatever her real name is. Well, it's an interesting sidelight.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a question. At what point did you start hearing about all of the atrocities?",
        "A: Oh yeah, okay. In a -- we heard from British broadcasting, BBC, that we occasionally -- yeah,\nthe -- the -- we -- we had a chance to listen to BBC at the house of this elderly couple, the\nDwuzuls, you know, who -- later were insulted that we hadn't informed them earlier who we\nwere, because they -- we had even before that, when we still pretended to be good German\nAryans, we had often been at their house listening to foreign broadcasts, mainly BBC, actually,\nwith them. And in fact I have to say that -- that was a big morale booster, just to listen to the\nBBC. They did a lot for us just by having these broadcasts and -- and they -- their signal was\nalways -- it started out with the Morse Code signal for the letter V, for victory and -- and by\ncoincidence, these are also the first tacts of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. And -- and just\nlistening to -- to this signal was already a big morale booster. And of course we heard all kinds of\nstories, that the Nazis kept from the population. And of course, as I had also said before, that was\npunishable by execution if they found out someone was listening to foreign radio broadcasts. So\nin a way, the Dwuzuls had a point, you know, they were totally in our hand, you know, we -- we\nlistened to these broadcasts there with them at their radio and --",
        "Q: No, my question was --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: After you -- you were with the Russians, did people start streaming back?",
        "A: Oh, no.",
        "Q: Did you start hearing stories?",
        "A: No, not -- I mean, all I was going to say -- that come from -- from Brit -- from BBC we heard\nfor the first time, I think maybe I said that before already, that hundreds of thousands of Jews are\nbeing killed. Then -- no, 1-it -- it took quite awhile. Actually, people slowly dribbled in. There\nwas a central registration place for Jews right after the war. In fact, that was at the Jewish\nhospital, which was the last, sort of collection center for Jews for deportation. Then it was turned\nover and -- and then was the first place where Jews could -- free Jews could collect again. And --\nbut since there was no public transport, that was at the opposite end of Berlin. Templehoff was in\nthe southern part of Berlin and that hospital in the northern part. It was a long walk of many\nmiles. I went there once a week, hoping to see a -- a well known name, but -- but didn't discover\nanyone. The -- the first person who returned, whom I knew, from Auschwitz, was a high school\nfriend of mine, who in fact later also came to this country and was then, before his retirement, a\nprofessor of mathematics at Ohio State University in Columbus, and -- where he is living now.\nBut he -- he was in Auschwitz and he came back and he told me basically, a lot of the things\nalso, a lot of the things that Elie Wiesel discussed in his book, \u201cNight.\u201d An-and -- I mean sort of,\nI mean the -- the fact that millions of Jews had been systematically killed, I mean it -- because\nthen also other Jews came back, not just German Jews, also east European Jews who were\nchased out then, from their own countries, mainly from Poland. As you may know, there were\npogroms in Poland against the returning Jews. And so, I don't know how soon we found out, but\nwithin maybe weeks or months, we found out, although I mean, the total extent of 1t probably\nmight have taken longer, I-I don't know.",
        "Q: But the stories --",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: How bad it was?",
        "A: Yeah, right -- that -- that came out. I-I-I would like to make a few sort of post-script\ncomments concerning the period of time before the start of World War Two. Because I-I\nremember you had also asked me a question, you know, how that time affected me, at that time I\nwas just a teenager and of course the Nazis were then in power, since 1933. And what I would\nlike to say 1s, that there was an increasing atmosphere, sort of -- of -- of hostility against the Jews\nin -- in all -- in the media, in p -- in -- in newspapers, in -- in the radio and so on. And -- and we\nwere, I mean, th-that I know I discussed also -- pictured as the worst criminals and as a --a sort of\ntr-trying to undermine the German nation. Yeah. For example, one incident in -- in the apartment\nbuilding where we lived, the -- the beautiful one where we had that large apartment, there were\nonly two parties on each floor. And on the same floor there was another couple, the husband was\nalso a lawyer, but they were Aryans, I mean Germans and they had a daughter, just one, single\nchild, a daughter my sister's age. And the grandmother, one of the grandmother also lived with\nthem. And my sister and that girl were very close friends, they played together, and of course\nthey went to school together then, when they came to school and so on. And one day the girl told\nmy sister that her grandmother had forbade her from now on, to have a Jewish friend. So she is\nsorry, but she can't come over any more and can't have her over. You know, things like that.\nThen, each apartment building was assigned a Nazi party, sort of representative for that building\nand the man who was the representative in our building, for example, made it a point, whenever\nwe crossed paths, see, in the house entrance, in the elevator or wherever, to ostensibly sort of\nlook in a very hostile way and ignoring us, not greeting us. And a few other tenant, not all of\nthem, but a few other tenants followed suit. Then, as the 30's wore on and the Nazis really started\nopenly to prepare for war, they also started an extensive air raid protection system, with building\nair raid shelters in basements and so on. And one of the early orders was that Jews are not\npermitted to join the other tenants in an air raid shelter. So we had to go -- ea-each tenant also\nhad a little lockable area, sort of separated by -- by wooden planks, to store things, for storage.\nAnd we had to sit in there like pariahs, while the rest of the tenants walked by there into their air\nraid shelter, which was, you know with benches and so on. And there was -- I mean there were\nconstant speeches, of course, which were insulting and hostile to us and -- and people, even\npeople who were not ill-meaning, felt that it was dangerous even, to be seen -- to associate with\nJews. And then there were, they had frequent Nazi holidays or other holidays. They u -- every\nopportunity they -- then there were the Olympic games and so on. And o-of each time they made\na big fuss about marches. That -- that was sort of one of their favorite activities. SS units, SA\nunits, Hitler youth units, would march, you know, looking really snappy and snifty, with flags\nflying and with bands playing and singing their songs. And it was sort of, in retrospect, almost\nlike a -- almost continuous holiday atmosphere and by that time of course, as the 30's went on,\neverybody was employed. You know, Germany had a tremendous unemployment rate before, as\npart of the world wide great depres-depression. And of course they were all employed, basically\nre-arming Germany, but we didn't know it at that time. But, I mean, that was the thi -- that's --\nthat's how they solved the unemployment problem and also their own military, what they\nconceived as inferiorit-inferiority, and --",
        "Q: You mentioned the Olympics.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you go to any of that?",
        "A: Yeah, well actually, I went to two events. I went -- one was the final for the gold medal of\nsoccer. I went with my mother, she -- my mother was very interested in sports, my father\ncouldn't have cared less. So she went with me and the final game was between Italy and Austria\nand it was a very exciting game, they were, at that time, the power houses in -- 1n -- 1n soccer.\nAnd actually Germany also had a pretty good team, but was already out of the running by that\ntime. And what happened 1s the -- at that time of course, Austria was still an independent\ncountry, otherwise they wouldn't have had a team. And -- but the Germans of course, felt kinship\nwith the Austrians, so the -- the stadium sort of rooted for the -- for the Austrians. The Italians\nhad bought, sort of blocks, large blocks of seats, where they were sitting in their black Fascist\nuniforms and were waving Italian flags and they must have had some sort of a cheerleader. They\nwould -- at -- at some particular moment, maybe when Italy was on a drive, they would jump up,\nlike on a command and shout, I mean in Italian, \u201cItalia, Italia, Italia,\u201d and waving their flags.\nAnd then the rest of the stadium would thunder back, \u201c\u201cUstarashe, Ustarashe,\u201d is the German\nword for Austria. \u201c\u201cUstarashe, Ustarashe.\u201d So it was that constant back and forth between these\nblocks of Italians who shouted Italia and most of the rest of the stadium shouting Ustarashe. And",
        "Q: Was that alarming at all or was it exciting?",
        "A: No, th-that was an excite -- that was an excite -- excite, I mean of course there were political\nundertones, but I mean, Italy was, by that time already, an ally of Germany, so there was no, it\nwasn't as if say Britain had been, you know then the --",
        "Q: There was a certain energy --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: At the '36 Olympics --",
        "A: Oh, yeah, I mean --",
        "Q: Maybe you can talk about --",
        "A: Yeah I-I mean that was, I mean, incredible. First of all, they -- they toned down somewhat,\ntheir antisemitism. That was probably on pressure from the west, although there wasn't much of\nthat pressure as far as I can see. But the whole city was sort of -- was first of all renovated. The --\nthe -- the elevated lines got totally new trains. You know, it's that line that ran by that synagogue\nalso, that was burned down a few years later. And -- and in fact those -- those cars are still 1n use\nnow, that is now 60 years later. Unbelievable. I mean now they -- they look worn and so on. And\n-- and several stations, like the -- in -- in central Berlin and -- and -- and western Berlin, the\ncentral station is -- 1s a zoo station, because it's near the zoo. And that was totally rebuilt and --\nand lots of other things, I mean were done to the city. I mean -- I mean the Nazis used that --\nwent all out of their way and -- and the interesting -- when I came to this country, and went to\ncollege here, in the year 1949, so that was only 13 years after the Olympics. I was at a small\ncollege in Missouri, where I had a scholarship. Southwest Missouri State College, in Springfield,\nMissouri. And my German t -- not my German, she was a German professor there, a woman and\nI-I was actual -- at her request, I was active in the German club. Ther-There was a club for\nstudents who wanted to major in German and practice German and -- and she had asked me to go\nthere too, so they can sort of converse with me in German. And then I often talked with her also,\nand she said she was in Germany in '36 to the Olympics. At that time she was a young, I don't\nknow, whatever, assistant professor or something and -- and she said she was impressed -- the --\nthe courtesy, the -- the -- we -- how well everything was planned, the efficiency and also the\nparty, the party hogans were also enlisted. They were all very nice, you know, the-they -- it -- it's\nfairly hard for people to understand. I mean y -- you can -- you could, even SS officers and\nsometimes the most brutal types, could be very charming and courteous and polite and they were\nall double faced and -- so the Olympic games, from that point of view, were a huge success, I\nmean. And of course, also, Germany did very well, I mean the Nazis had a tremendous system of\nphysical training and -- and sports facilities and so on and I think in medals they won that game,\nfar -- at least they claimed to, I forgot the details. But anyway, coming back to that soccer game,\nthey -- the way soccer was played at that time at least, it was a draw at the official end of the\ngame and I think it was one to one. And then the rule was that the game is extended until sudden\ndeath. In other words, one party shoots a goal and that ends the game and that party of course\nthen wins. And -- And it was Italy that shot that additional goal, so it was two to one for Italy,\nand they got the gold medal and the Austrians got the silver then. But my father was -- my -- my\nmother was very interested in -- in sports, though not just spectator sports, but she did a lot also\nto entice me to -- I was originally totally averse to any sports, I didn't like it and often was afraid\nof things and she had a tremendous energy and -- and sort of practically forced me how -- to\nlearn how to swim, to ski and to skate, I mean ice skate and bicycle. And I do most of these\nthings -- for swimming I don't care too much anymore. I find it too boring just to swim bac-back\nand forth in a lap, but -- but I mean, I-I'm able to swim and -- but I-I still love skiing and --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]. Why don't you continue?",
        "A: Yeah. Incidentally, the Olympics was the first occasion when I saw Hitler in person. We -- we\nlived -- the street we lived on in that ap-apartment was the major east - west sort of boulevard,\nthat cut through, it started at the center of Berlin, actually near the Rice chancellery and then\nwent for several miles, to the western outskirts where we lived. And the Olympic stadium was\nalso near where we lived, so Hitler passed by there on -- on opening day to open the games. And\nof course, his trip out to the Olympic stadium itself, was planned as a big theater. They had the\nstreets lined with enthusiastic crowds and SS, sort of in -- information, holding them back. And\nthen Hitler would ride in an open Mercedes-Benz, in uniform, standing stiffly upright and\nperiodically raising his right arm to the Hitler salute, greeting the masses. And as I stood on the\nbalcony, just looking straight down at Hitler, the thought occurred to me how easy it would be\njust to assassinate him from here. The next time I saw him, was exact -- about a year later, when\nMussolini played his state visit to Berlin in 1937. And in fact, during that state visit, the Berlin-\nRome axis was sort of cemented. And Mussolini, the arrangement was also for them to ride into\ntown, so in the opposite direction now, from the -- from a suburban railroad station, which was in\nfact just half a mile away from where our house was. And then they rode into town, again\ngreeting the masses that were lined up behind rows of SS. And there was an interesting contrast.\nHitler, the unsmiling, stiff despot and Mussolini, the typical, jovial Italian. He also raised his\nhand, but he raised it in a much more informal way. He -- his mouth was widely open and -- and\nlaughing and smiling and his body would sort of -- in body language, wave back and forth from\none side to the other, acknowledging crowds on both sides. Was a tremendous difference in the\nappearance of these two dictators. I'm not trying to make Mussolini appear any -- like a nice\nuncle, but there was a tremendous difference between these two men, both were equally brutal.\nIn -- in summary, I mean, I-I must say that I -- th-the years in the 30's, leading up to World War\nTwo and the Holocaust, I felt, I mean basically like an outsider, like b-being, I mean pushed\naway from the main body and from all the festivities that the Germans enjoyed, from which I\nwas excluded. But on the other hand, I had found my inner Jewish belonging, mainly as a result\nof the school that I went to and which gave me inner strength and to some extent compensated\nfor that. One final remark I would like to make concerning the question of the deportations. The\ndeportations of course, were ordered by the Gestapo and go back directly to an order by\nHeidrish, who was ordered by Hitler, was given by Hitler the -- the order to carry this out. But\nthe -- at the local level, the deportations were organized by the Jewish community organizations.\nAnd of course that has been a big problem ever since it happened. For -- for me personally, I felt\n-- first of all, totally abandoned, I must say, by the -- knowing that the Jewish organizations were\norganizing the transports. Infer it got to the point where I actually considered the leadership of\nthe Ricefinegunk -- that was the sort of umbrella organization of Jews in Germany -- I\nconsidered them as part of the enemy and they had to be considered that way. On the other hand,\nof course, we know now much more, there were very difficult moral decisions and there were\nvery difficult also, options available. I certainly would never want to be in a position to make\nthose choices. But it -- but th-th-th-the fact remains that for me at the time, I -- I felt really as\nbeing abandoned by my own leadership and -- and -- and it -- it probably needs to be considered\nmore deeply now, where we have some distance, what the options were that these people had and\nwhat they could have done, other than what they actually did.",
        "Q: I'm wondering how long you remained in Berlin, what your plans were and how easy or\ndifficult it was to realize those plans.",
        "A: Yeah, briefly, my first priority was to get on with my education and I immediately enrolled in\nthe technical university in Berlin and then later took courses also in the main university, or\nHumboldt University, as that was then renamed, li -- taking lectures in mathematics, physics and\nso on. There were many famous professors who had still survived the war. And of course there --\nthere were then also a number of Jews who had returned, or some of them actually had survived\nin Berlin as -- as mixed -- children of mixed marriages. You know, where one parent was Gentile\nand the other one was Jewish. And of course there was a large number of German army veterans.\nAnd that in fact, was a very sore point. Many of them were still very nationalistic, in spite of that\nhu-huge defeat. So I-I-I enrolled in those courses and actually Margaret's mother immediately\nopened a sort of office, on her own, for social help for Jews returning from concentration camps.\nAnd she worked closely together with the American official who was in charge of that borough,\nTemplehoff. A -- I think a captain or major Davidhoff, or Davidhoff. It turns out supposedly, that\nthat man was a Communist and was then later rotated out and sent home. And when -- when the\nfirst possibility arose for emigrating to the United States, that was in '46 and we registered, it\nturned out that Margaret's mother somehow was on the black list, because she had closely\ncollaborated, and that Major Davidho-Davidhoff also for example, was helpful in providing\napartments for returning Jews and etcetera, etcetera. And so we were, for about a year, subjected\nto a lot of chicanery by the American consulate. I remember th-the consul himself was a Mr.\nHaney and -- who was a very unpleasant character and I was once, I'm sure on -- on his orders,\nalthough I can't prove it, interrogated by an officer of the CIC. The CIC is the army's criminal\ninvestigation commission or some -- and -- and that interrogation took place in the following\nway, that the interrogating officer sat behind a desk and next to him was a growling German\nShepherd, who was there just to intimidate me and they wanted to know, you know, about I --\nwanted me to incriminate Margaret's parents, basically, as -- as Communists. And -- you know\nand when I -- when I couldn't say anything incriminating, you know he -- he let me go, finally.\nBut he -- it was a very unpleasant interview, or interrogation is the better word. I did receive,\nfinally, my visa, but the Haas family did not and at that point, since we had lived through thick\nand thin through the war, I decided to let my visa lapse, even though I was told by the -- and I\ntold the consul I will go when the others will go. The consul said that there's no guarantee that I\nwill ever get my visa renewed if I let 1t lapse once. And -- and I had an uncle here in the United\nStates who also implored me to -- to come -- to come and let -- wait here for them. Anyway -- by\nthe way, that's a interesting thing, my -- my first connection to -- to friends, you know there was\nno postal connection, of course, between Germany and any country outside. So we went to --\nthere was a huge barracks of American soldiers near where we lived and I remember I went to\nthe guard soldier outside and asked whether he could tell me whether there was a Jewish soldier\nsomewhere. It's such an outlandish idea. So -- so he directed me, pointed to some particular room\nand there was a Sergeant Roth, R-o-t-h. So I went to that Roth and told him who I was and that I\nsurvived and -- and I had a-an address of a school friend in Connecticut and my uncle. And --\nand -- and actually I didn't -- he was in New York, but I didn't have his exact address, but I had\nsome connecting address in London, who could then forward it. And -- and so he also conversed\nwith me, that Roth and he -- he asked me where -- he -- no, he didn't ask me, he warned me not\nto try to emigrate to the United States because there are -- were already too many Jews there and\n-- and was rising antisemitism and now that the Nazis were gone and the war was over, 1t would\nbe much better for me also if I stayed in Germany. And I found that so unbelievably\npreposterous, he was an American Jew, telling me not to come here. But anyway, I didn't follow\nhis advice, but what he did do, is he di -- he did forward my mail and the letter that I read to my\nschool friend, wound up as an article, he submitted it -- there's a German-Jewish weekly called\n\u201cOufbow.\u201d By now it's a biweekly. And it was published in there and -- and my -- my uncle then\nalso f -- supported me. Finally we did get visas. Th-The joint was extremely helpful there, they --\nthe joint opened offices in Berlin and with their help, the three of us finally got visas and we\narrived here on the 22nd of June, 1947. And -- and then my -- my first priority again here, was to\nstudy.\nEnd of Tape Eight, Side A\nBeginning of Tape Eight, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape three, side B, of an interview with Ernest Fontheim, on June fourth, 1997.",
        "A: Yeah. After my arrival, my first priority, as I said, was to continue my studies. My uncle\nprovided the financial support in the beginning, for a-a few months. And then -- I lived in New\nYork then. He had rented for me a furnished room in the upper West Side. And then I took a job\nas a messenger boy on 48th -- West 48th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, for an outfit\ncalled Action Messenger Service. We were a whole bunch of young guys who were lined up and\nthe boss would always call one after the other to run certain errands. For me that was great, that's\nhow I got to know New York. I -- he sent me to one address to pick up a package to be delivered\nto a second address and I got to know New York from downtown Wall Street to midtown and\neven further uptown and I really fell in love with the city at that time. In the evening -- and by --\nincidentally, I earned 50 cents an hour. And in the evening, I took two or three courses, I forgot,\nin City College. And -- and I took some elementary physics, which I already had in Germany,\njust in order to get up to speed also with the English language and with the technical expressions.\nAnd I also had a course in calculus, which I -- also mostly was just review of what I had already\nlearned in Germany. And I -- my goal, of course, was to become a full-time student and\nfinancially that wouldn't have been possible for me. So through a friend of mine, I was referred\nto a committee with the interesting name, American Committee for Emigr\u00e9 Writers, Scholars and\nArtists. And was sort of an interesting outfit. Basically what they did is this, they did not have\nany money themselves, they served as a clearing house for available grants, fellowships and so\non. So I registered with them and after, I forgot what it was, a few months -- I should say also, I\nhad only A's from my first two semesters in City College, so that obviously helped along. And\nthey told me that they had a Rotary international scholarship for Southwest Missouri State\nCollege, in Springfield, Missouri. I never heard of the place before and of course I didn't know at\nthat time that there were such huge disparities between different academic institutions. But\nanyway, I went there and I credit my two years in Springfield, Missouri and at that college,\nmainly with my Americanization. And one thing that bothered me in New York is that the only\nsocial contact I had was not just with other German Jews, but mainly only with Berlin Jews.\nFormer Berlin Jews I should say, I should say. But -- and I realized that if I want to become\nacculturated in my new country, I can't just have as -- a social life only with people from the old\ncountry. And -- but it was very difficult in City College, leadto -- I tried several times\nunsuccessfully. It's a commuter college, people come, take classes and rush away. Go back into\nthe subway and go to Brooklyn or God knows where. And so it's not really a campus\natmosphere. So when I got that scholarship, I took a train off to Springfield, Missouri and yeah --\nand I should say that my friends, the Haas family, they --after some initial difficulty, settled in --\nin New York and Margaret's father got several jobs, improving as time went on, in the garment\nindustry as designer, pattern maker and so on, in ladies garments. Of course we stayed in contact\nas I went to Springfield. And there I was received by the dean, who felt that 1t would be a good\nidea if I would be put -- housed in the barracks, which had been built on campus for GI's. That\nwas the time of the GI Bill of Rights, after World War Two and there was such an influx of\nstudents that they needed to do something to -- to house them. And so th-these barracks were\nbuilt. They were relatively primitive, but as far as I was concerned, totally sufficient. And of\ncourse, there I learned all the slang that I hadn't learned in all my years of English in the German\nhigh school, including all the four letter words, which I hadn't known before. And -- and in\ngeneral got sort of acculturated to life in a small, Midwestern town. As the -- coincidence would\nhave it, also the -- the dean, right away set me in touch with the local rabbi. And it turned out that\nrabbi also was a form-former German Jew. He was -- he wa -- had been rabbi in the Bavarian\ncity of Oxbourg before the war and now he was rabbi in Springfield, Missouri and he and his\nfamily took me somewhat under their wings. I -- I was often invited to Shabbat evening dinners\nat their house and obviously each time for the Seder. And so I lived with them -- but -- not lived\nwith, I mean I socialized with them and on the other hand, I also had American contacts and I\neven made dates with American girls. And so -- and -- and my school performance turned out to\nbe very well. I did very well in all classes, so when I graduated then in -- in 1950, with a\nBachelor's Degree, I got an offer, actually several offers, but the one that I accepted for graduate\nschool was from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Admission to graduate school,\nplus a guaranteed sort of teaching assistantship in the physics department. And so, in the summer\nof 1950 isa, I got my Bachelor's Degree. That was in July, but I remained a bachelor then for less\nthan a month. But o-on the sixth of August, Margaret and I finally got married. And that was in\nNew York and -- and then we moved together to -- to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where I started\nmy graduate studies. That graduate studies turned out, unfortunately extended for more years\nthan I had originally anticipated, and is customary, for a number of reasons. I had some bad luck\nwith my first thesis subject and so on, but I don't want to go into that here now, but I -- 0-of\ngeneral interest is maybe that in the s -- in the -- in my first summer there, 1t was the summer of\n'51, I had a summer job at Bethlehem Steel Company, which is in the same city as Lehigh\nUniversity. And the company -- 1n fact the steel plant, I think the company still exists, but the\nsteel plant doesn't exist anymore. But I saw a steel plant from the inside and I found all of that\nvery interesting. How steel is being made and so on. And then two years later, in '53, I had a\nsummer job at White Sands proving ground. That was a rocket proving ground before anyone\neven knew that the United States was deeply involved in rocketry. At that time, they just shot --\nshot captured German V2 rockets. And some clever physicist had gotten the idea to -- while\nthese rockets are being shot with harmless warheads, just to test their flight characteristics, why\nnot put some instruments on the -- in -- in the warhead, to measure properties in the upper\natmosphere, ionosphere. And actually I was hired partly to write a sort of research paper on\ncertain aspects on how to detect cosmic rays. And so that filled my summer and I didn't realize at\nthat time, that in fact space physics would at one time become my life's profession. In 1954, the\nfollowing summer, I spent -- I had a special fellowship for -- to Brookhaven, the national\nlaboratory, which at that time was the foremost laboratory for -- 1n the world, not only this\ncountry, for high energy physics. And th-there was a machine that could accelerate particles to\nunheard of -- at that time -- energies, and cause all kinds of interesting effects and collisions.\nAnd I worked with some famous physicists there, I -- I met, among others there, Enrico Fermi,\nwho -- the famous Italian physicist and Nobel prize winner and several others. And -- and then I-\nI wrote a f -- a thesis, back at Lehigh University in a fairly esoteric, purely mathematical subject\nin theoretical physics, involving fundamental particles and -- and field theory. I graduated in\n1960 and by that time already, we had two children. I-I-I should have mentioned that after we\nmarried, in August 1950 and moved to Bethlehem, Margot worked for a number of years in an\noffice and in 1955, she was pregnant with our son, Claude, who was born in August, '55 and --\nand then in -- in O-October '59, our daughter Eva was born. And in '60, she was less than a year\nold, we moved from Bethlehem to Ann Arbor, Michigan. And in Ann Arbor, I have worked --\nactually I was for two years in the radiation laboratory and the radiation laboratory sort of started\nto fold and go downhill. And then I obtained an offer from the space physics research laboratory\nin 1962, where I -- I stayed until my retirement in 1992. I -- during that time I had a also varied,\ninteresting career. I attended many international meetings, including one in 1971, in Moscow,\nwhich interested me very much. I-I should add, incidentally, that I taught myself the Cyrillic\nalphabet during my two years -- postwar years in Berlin, from '45 to '47. Because the Russians\nimmediately after their arrival, one of the first things -- they put under the German street names,\nthe -- the name in R-Russian -- in Cyrillic letters, so that their soldiers could orient themselves in\nthe city. And simply by comparison and also by -- by knowing the Greek alphabet, which I knew\nfrom the gymnasium, I -- I could figure out the entire alphabet, so going to Moscow in -- in'71,\nat least I wasn't lost. I could read street names and so on. In '72 I attended an international\nconference in Warsaw, which -- an-and just shortly before that time, I had read several diaries\nand reports about Warsaw ghetto, including the uprising. And the visit to Warsaw was a\nemotionally very shattering experience for me. I -- I spent every free minute that I was not at the\nmeeting, walking around the streets of the ghetto and -- which I all knew, from the books and --\nthat I'd read. And -- and observed and of course -- this is well known, the ghetto was totally\ndestroyed by the Germans after they captured it and -- and then the Poles completely leveled\neverything that was left and then built sort of a worker's apartment in a style which I call\nSocialist Modern. Which means modern lines, but shoddy construction. And -- and I-I just\nwalked through the streets and in my mental eye, saw in front of me, the Jews who lived there,\nonly a few years before. It was there 30 years later that I was there, which is nothing, in history.\nIn -- in '70, let me see, in '78 I spent a year, I'm sorry, I spent a summer in Paris. I -- a --a former\nstudent of mine actually, w-who got his PhD u-under my supervision in the late '60's. Was a\nFrench fellow, with whom I had an also personal friendship and we stayed in touch and he was\nprobably one of my most successful students. He -- by now he 1s director of a big laboratory in\nToulouse, but at that time he was already head of a group and he invited me to spend the summer\nof '78 there and I went there with Margot and our daughter Eva, who at that time -- '78, what was\nshe doing then? She must have been a college freshman. And -- and that was marv -- we lived\nreally like -- like French people. We rented a furnished apartment and Margaret and Eva, during\nthe day, went of course to visit museums and sights around the streets and -- and on weekends\nwe did things together. It was a -- one of m -- the best summers we had. And in '76, by the way, I\nhad a summer position at the space physics laboratory of the University of California and\nBerkeley. That was where we -- we made a cross country trip by car, which is the only way to\nsee this country, 1s really by driving through it. It's fascinating how the landscape changes, the\narchitecture changes and so on. And on the fourth of July, actually -- we -- we first visited\nfriends in San Diego and Los Angeles and on the fourth of July we drove up from L.A. to -- to\nSan Francisco. And of course the fourth of July is Independence Day, obviously and in '76 it was\nthe 200th anniversary of the United States. But in addition to that, 1t was also the day where\nIsraeli commandos liberated the prisoners in Entebbe. And we were driving along and listening\nto the radio, you know, just for diversion, when suddenly a newsflash came on that Israeli\ncommandos had liberated the passengers of a -- I think it was an Air France plane with Israeli\nand also other citizens on it. And so that was a perfect way for us to celebrate Independence Day.\nAnd -- and then in the evening, after we arrived in Berkeley, we were told that already ahead of\ntime, that there's always a big firework over San Francisco Bay and the best way to view it is\nfrom the -- from the eastern side of the bay, from Berkeley, in other words, th-the space physics\nlab is on -- on -- on a -- on a mountain where also the radiation lab is located. And it was a\ntremendous experience to see the fireworks over San Francisco Bay on the fourth of July, 1976.\nWell --",
        "Q: Let me ask you a few questions.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: Okay? What -- what -- when you look back, I mean you've now had a lot of time and you --\nyou're rela -- you're fairly reflective. What sort of long term impact did these early experiences\nhave on you, on the -- on the way you've lived your life, on your general outlook or the way\nyou've raised your kids? Could you talk about that?",
        "A: Yes. I mean, it had a tremendous impact and in fact the impact increased as the years went by.\nI -- I mean the fact that my parents, my sister and my first girlfriend, plus innumerable other\npeople I knew or I didn't know, just vanished and were brutally murdered because of some\nunbelievable ideology which somebody cooked up, is so unna -- it -- it -- it's even for me today\nnot understandable, how that could have happened. And I have been sort of totally more and\nmore absorbed by it as the year went by. I -- I read -- I have, I mean innumerable books, some of\nthem I haven't even read yet, on the Holocaust. I mean starting with the standard works by -- by\nHillburg and what's her name? Yahyah Hill, the Israeli Estroyen and also Lucy Davidovitch and\nso on. But in addition to that, all kinds of -- of special works by authors on special subjects like\nthe Warsaw ghetto. I own a number of diaries, including Rhea Blumes, notes and -- and on -- on\n-- also on -- on -- on German Jews and I -- of course fascinated particularly by the fate of -- of\nGerman Jews, because that's what I am and I was totally raised in Germany and -- and how that\ncould have happened, of all countries, in that country, is something that I -- I have wrestled with\nall the -- for years and years and have not really come to a conclusion. What it really was that\ngave rise to this unbelievable crime and you know that was com -- also it was committed by\npeople who were mostly highly educated and although there were some uneducated at the lower\nlevels, but at the higher levels they were of -- Goebbels was a PhD and -- and -- and many other\npeople and -- who -- who are not that well known, but were in high positions, were highly\neducated. And to plan a mass murder on that scale and carry it out is -- 1s totally mind boggling\nand so -- and -- and then another thing is that the fate of my immediate family 1s -- I'm -- I'm\ntrying to picture my father, even on the -- on the de -- on the deportation train. I mean how -- I-I-\nI mean going into such de-detail as y-you know that each -- each railroad car where people were\ntransported and they were basically freight or cattle cars, had just -- somewhere -- big bucket\nwhere people could relieve themselves. I couldn't -- I can't even believe how -- how anyone\nwould even be able to relieve themself in public, with everybody standing around, in a bucket in\nthe middle. The -- the idea, to humiliate Jews to such an unbelievable extent and how my father\neven -- an-and then, on the day that they left, the temperatures were -- I mean Berlin in winter\nwas anyway cold, I think now it's not as cold any more, but at that time 1t was much colder, but\nthat was an unusually cold day, even for that time. I-I checked the meteorological records again,\nto -- and have that at home, actually. And to -- to -- to reconfirm, that was just my memory, but it\n-- were extremely cold days j -- and of course the cars were unheated and -- and how my family\nwas treated after they arrived in Auschwitz, or that they went to Auschwitz, that is a matter of\nrecord. And my friend Ruth, I think, was deported to Riga and from -- but I -- from what little I\nknow, it may have happened that they were immediately transported by truck into some forest\nand shot. And s-so I-I have been -- as the years went by I have more and more occupied myself\nwith that. For example, I was instrumental in Ann Arbor, to start a annual sort of observance of\nYom HaShoah, which has been now going on for over 10 years. And I was also involved -- Ann\nArbor has a statue now, commemorating the Holocaust, where I was involved in -- both in\nraising the money and in getting the idea through, it's a -- the -- the artist who made the statue is\nLeonard Baskin, who, by the way, also made one of the statues of the new FDR memorial here.\nAnd so I'm -- J-I must say that I am -- m-my -- yeah then -- did you ask me how I raised m --\nwhat affect of raising my children and -- and in two ways. First of all, I have always talked to\nthem about that period and -- and in -- in 1981 in fact, that was when our son graduated from --\nfrom law school in Michigan and our daughter was actually still a year away from -- from\ngraduation, but we proposed sort of for them, a joint graduation gift, that's a trip to Europe, sort\nof as students like to do it, sort of to bum around. They could select where they wanted to go,\nsort of and you know, hos -- youth hostels and so on, with one proviso. In'81, I was at an\ninternational meeting, I think in June or so, in Edinburgh, Scotland. And I-I suggested that we\nmeet in Berlin on -- on a certain week, so that Margot and I could show them where we grew up,\nrespectively and also where we went to school and other places of relevance to -- in our lives.\nAnd so that's what we did, we actually -- after -- from Edinburgh, you know, we flew to Berlin.\nThe kids had already left earlier. They had decided first to make a brief swing through parts of\nScandinavia, they were in Copenhagen, then southern Sweden, okay and then they went into\nBerlin. We met there and spent a week there and we -- we sh -- went also to the cemetery where\nsome of our forebears, gros grandparents and so on, are buried. And some famous German Jews.\nIn Germany the gravestones are also more, sort of descriptive, I mean you can really see who\nsomebody was. I mean it explains -- somebody may have been professor of this or that at this\nuniversity or -- or may have been an architect or whatever. Anyway -- and -- and then -- the rest\nof the time they continued then, on their own. So, coming back to your question, I mean I -- I\nsaw to it, but I also w-we wanted to make them also very conscious of their Jewish heritage and\nMargot and I often feel, that in that respect maybe we didn't do too great a job. We had -- we sort\nof totally relied -- we are members of a conservative synagogue and of course, you know, money\nconstraints being what they are, they can't really hire first rate teachers, so they usually use\ncollege students who come from more or less religious homes, to teach sort of the standard\nthings in elementary Hebrew and Biblical history and so on. But they still, they are -- our\ndaughter now even, is taking now here a course in basics of Judaism, I think, at the DCJCC.",
        "Q: Wh-what what I'm asking is maybe a little bit more subtle. It's, do you think that you acted\ndifferently than you might have? Do you think that you have certain values or you instilled\ncertain values --",
        "A: Oh, okay.",
        "Q: As a result of your experiences?",
        "A: Yes. Okay, that -- thank you for raising that question. I was -- I-I was never only concerned\nexclusively with the Jewish faith, although this is obviously the one that's closest to me, but I\nwas always appalled, I mean for example, also, with the treatment of blacks here in this country,\nor Afro-Americans. And I-I have been always quite active in -- in -- in Ann Arbor there. I mean\ntoday\u2019s -- seems long ago, but there was at one time strict housing segregation and there was a\nlarge group in which I was involved, for passage of city ordinances, to make such segregation\nillegal, particularly by real estate agents, loan practices by banks and so on. And I took the\nchildren sometimes along to demonstrations, I mean just to -- and they are both -- both of our\nchildren -- E-Eva, our daughter, is involved now in the Hunger Coalition here, which\nincidentally my wife is also very much involved, in Ann Arbor. And our son 1s involved with the\nAnti-defamation League and such organizations. So we always instilled in them that it is\nimportant for everybody to work for equality, not just for yourself or your own group, but for all\ngroups.",
        "Q: Were there certain, or are there certain fears that have stuck with you as a result of your\nexperiences?",
        "A: Very, very seldom, I have some dreams or some thoughts. I mean I -- I just recently, when I\nwoke up earlier in the morning than I-I should have probably, I thought of that incident with that\ncivilian police guy who stopped me on the subway and where I ask myself the question, what if\nmy assessment was wrong and my lingering around there would have caused him -- he could\nhave, any time while I was at that newspaper kiosk, pretending to look at newspapers, he could\nhave tapped on my shoulder and said, \u201cWhy don't you come along, I want to ask you some more\nquestions.\u201d And then, that would have been the end of me. And -- and sort of I elaborated on that\nin my fantasies. I w --",
        "Q: I mean there are people who probably wouldn't have gotten -- wouldn't ride a subway today,\ndo you know what I mean?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I'm trying to --",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Oh, no.",
        "Q: If there are certain -- certain images, certain sounds that really trigger memories for you?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: In a very powerful way?",
        "A: Well actually, it's not a memory, it's sirens -- for two reasons. First of all, they signaled air\nraids, but they also, you know my father was basically abducted, that's what the correct word for\nthat would have been. And normally, you would call the police and -- and they would come with\ntheir sirens blaring and whenever I hear sirens, particularly in a police car, sometimes I've\nactually -- tears are welling, thinking of it. They should have come and rescued my parents, they\nwere being abducted in broad daylight. And -- and I visited -- I visited by now, Auschwitz four\ntimes and that is also a -- something I still have not come to -- to grips with. But in general, I --\nin my day to day life, fortunately, I have not had any, I mean to my knowledge at least, any sort\nof real strong emotional effects of, I mean like you say, not wanting to ride subways or things.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you want to add, because I think we've covered a lot and --",
        "A: Yeah. I mean actually, o-one thing that I wanted to say and forgot, that in one of the earlier\ntapes, I think I made some mistakes in two dates. One is that highacoo -- high school friend of\nmine, at one point I said -- left Berlin to emigrate to England on January 18, 1938. Now, in\ncontext that of course could not have been in -- in -- as I explained at the time. His parents were\nAustrians and in January '38, Austria still was an independent country. Ex-Excuse me. Austria\nwas occupied in March '38 and so then they lost their protection. And he left Ger -- actually\nBerlin on January 18, '39. In other words, about three quarters of a year after Austria lost its\nindependent. The second date correction, the arrest of my girlfriend Ruth. I said at one time, it's\nNovember 9, '41. That -- also th -- in November -- I-I'm sorry, September 9, '41, I said. The first\ndeportation left Berlin only at the end of September '41 and she was deported on September 9,\n'42, not '41. I mean that's just -- it doesn't change anything, but to correct the misstatement.",
        "Q: Any overall thought or statement you'd like to make?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: Doesn't have to be specific, but just any --",
        "A: Yeah. I would think really two or three things. One of them is that there 1s a lot of basic value\nin Judaism and that it's sort of incumbent on us to really familiarize ourselves with it. I mean\nthere -- for many Jews in this country, there has been sort of -- the Holocaust has been treated\nalmost like a substitute religion, particularly in recent years and I think that is almost sick. I think\nthe Holocaust must be remembered, of course, but not as a -- in the sense of a religion, but in the\nsense that we, first of all should remember always, just like we remember other events in our\nhistory, going back to Masada, to the destruction of the two temples and so on and also to learn\nfrom it. Learn what to do and also what not to do. The other thing is, that aside from Judaism, I --\nI also don't believe that one should be focused 100 percent on one's Judaism. Like I know there\nare such Jews, but that since we are living in a -- in a broader world, that it 1s also the duty of\neveryone to involve him or herself in the daily politics. To fight for what is right and to fight for\n-- ag-against injustice, also against other groups. I think that is -- that is one thing th-th-that is\nimportant, I mean the -- there is a famous, by now it's a clich\u00e9, quote -- I think it is from the\nGerman, \u201cPustor Nimala.\u201d At -- at first they came after the Communists -- I mean the Nazis, I\ndidn't particularly care because I wasn't a Communist. Then they went after the Jews and didn't\nb-bother me either, I'm not a Jew. Then they went after homosexuals and didn't bother me, I'm\nnot a homosexual. Then they went after Catholics, that didn't bother me and when they came\nafter me, there was nobody left.",

    "answers": [
        "Answer: ...was Eva Irene. She was born in 1927. My family background was that I\nam, my parents were completely assimilated in German culture and in the German way of\nlife and there were very few of Jewish observances. My mother went with us to the\nsynagogue on the high holidays, that is the only thing I remember. I remember much\nmore distinctly, however, that we celebrated Christmas, we had a Christmas tree every\nyear, Santa Claus came and distributed gifts and I grew up really knowing very little\nabout being Jewish except I knew that I was Jewish. My, also my father had a very\nextensive library, he was actually generally very widely read and widely educated. I do\nnot remember any Jewish books, the books that we had were just general literature,\nGerman writers, Shakespeare, of course. The particular pride of my father was a 54\nvolume edition of the collected works of Goethe, the German playwright and philosopher\nof the early 19th Century. We were, as far as I can tell, relatively well off. We went on\nsummer vacations every year and I particularly was sent during the summer vacations,\nfrom maybe the age of 10 on or so, to acamp. These camps were usually all Jewish\ncamps. They were headed usually by a Jewish sports teacher and were located, they were\ndifferent from American camps in that they didn't have a specific camp location, but\ninstead the head of the camp, the sports teacher, would contract with some vacation\nowner of a building, of a vacation house, in the mountains or near the sea to rent that\nhouse for a period of about four weeks, I guess, or six weeks, and then he would take the\nkids to that place and, of course, with a number of assistants and so on. I personally\nwould have liked much better to be going on vacations with my parents, but my father\nworked very hard and I was always told that my father needed complete rest and\nrelaxation and that it was just too much of a commotion if we kids would also come\nalong. And usually what happened was, after a few days of being home sick then I got\nsort of sucked into the activities of the camp, made some friends and, in some of the\ncases, actually some school friends of mine from the school in Berlin were at the same\ncamp, so I had already ready-made friends there. From then on, I usually enjoyed these\nvacations. My contacts with Judaism really became stronger basically out of two events.\nThe first one was Hitler's assumption of power in, generally, 1933, where in the school\nwhere I was I was made to feel that I was different. The first year there was very little\nNazi activity in the school. The school I went to, incidentally, was the Mommsen\nGymnasium named after the German historian of the Roman Empire, Theodor\nMommsen, who actually personally was a very liberal minded historian. And\nGymnasium, in German means really classical high school. That school received, got a\nnew principal in the year 1934, he was a retired Army colonel who had fought in the First\nWorld War and also was a through and through convinced Nazi ideologue. And right\nafter his assumption of the principal-ship, he announced in a school assembly that it is his\ngoal to make the school a sort of example for Nazi ideological indoctrination. At that\npoint, many Jewish kids were taken out of that school by their parents and sent to other\nschools. I stayed in and after one year of that principal, only two kids, Jewish kids, were\nleft, another boy and I. The principal introduced all kinds of new activities like, for\nexample, before the beginning of the school day, the entire school had to assemble for\nsort of like a military roll call. Behind the school building there was a big sports field\nand we assembled there and had to stand at military attention and while the principal read\na particular paragraph that he had selected for that day out of Hitler's book, Mein Kampf,\nas sort of motto for the day. And during lunch hour, after we had eaten our food, we\nusually marched, the entire school in military formation, through the streets of the\nneighborhood, singing Nazi songs. After one year of his principal-ship, as I said there\nwere two kids left, and he asked us to come into his office and that, in Germany, where\nthe principal in general is a much more fearsome authority than you see now. In addition\nto that, of course, we knew where he stood, for us 1t was a somewhat intimidating\nexperience. When we were in his office he told us that he could not really see having\nJewish children in his school, which he wanted to make as a purely Germanic or Aryan\nschool serving as an example for all other schools in Germany. But, he also had no legal\nway to expel us from the school, so he thought about it and came to the following\nconclusion, that there were basically two options. Either our parents withdrew us\nvoluntarily or he would simply resign the principalship because he would not be able,\nunder those conditions, to carry out his goals, and with that message we were sent home.\nOur fathers got together on the telephone and discussed that this was obviously a veiled\nthreat and we were never sent back to that school.",
        "A: Yeah, well, after 1933, there was increasing pressure really for, to keep Jews and\nnon-Jews apart. I think maybe in '33 or '34, I may still have been in a mixed camp, but\nafter that, such camps simply didn't exist anymore. Actually, there was an additional\nreason, that all youth activities for Germans were progressively taken over by the Hitler\nYouth Organization. They went on summer excursions, on hikes and so on, and German\nchildren initially were just sort of socially pressured to participate, but I think in the\nmid-'30's, I don't remember the year, maybe '36 or so, it was actually made compulsory,\nthat every German kid, as a boy, had to be in the Hitler Youth and it had a parallel girls\norganization which was called, it was a German word, Bund Deutscher Madel , it means\nAssociation of German Girls, and girls were compulsorily in that organization. And if\nthere were any organizations outside of the Hitler Youth, they definitely would not be\npermitted to have any Jewish children in them, so that was not a religious thing, these\ncamps. Actually, I remember one camp where I was where the head was actually a\nwoman sports teacher and she was a very strong Zionist and she would have Friday\nevening Shabbat ceremonies and carry on other Jewish activities. And in all the other\ncamps, they were Jewish only to the extent that both the head and teachers, as well as all\nthe kids, were Jews, but otherwise, there were no Jewish related activities.",
        "A: Yes. No, I mean, I don't remember such instances. I always got along, the strange\nthing is that practically all, with one exception, all of my friends were always Jewish\nkids. That happened somehow naturally, I don't know. There was truly no, I wasn't told\nby my parents to have Jewish friends exclusively, but that's the way it turned out. But\neven after Hitler came to power, I had, I mean I had no, I do not remember any incidents\nwhere I was either attacked or had any violence on the part of my German school\nchildren. In fact, initially, my reaction to the Nazi seizure of power was that I felt sorry\nfor myself for not being an Aryan, I mean, a German kid, and that I couldn't participate in\nall the what I considered fun things that they were doing, games and so on, and it was\nreally only after I was expelled from the German school, actually, let me back up. I said\nearlier that my relationship to Judaism changed drastically for two reasons. I mean, one\nwas Hitler's accession to power and, which basically forced me to confront my\nJewishness, the other was my bar mitzvah, which came up in 1935 and which required\nme to take, several times a week, preparatory lessons, both for my, for the parshah which\nI was going to read from the Torah on the Shabbat during services on my bar mitzvah, as\nwell as additional sort of Jewish history and some Hebrew. And that, and then on top of\nit also, in 1935 was my expulsion from the Mommsen Gymnasium by this antisemitic\nprincipal, and my parents then transferred me to a very orthodox Jewish school. That has\nalways been a puzzle in my mind, my parents never explained it. There were other\nJewish schools which were much less orthodox, but they transferred me to the most\northodox of Jewish schools in Berlin. In fact, it was a school associated with a sort of\nseparatist congregation, the, all of the, the rest of the Jewish community was in one large\nsort of super congregation, I think that is in most European cities like that, where Jewish\ncommunal life, is handled by one big congregation and that congregation also is\nresponsible for building synagogues according to different needs. I mean, there were one\nor two reform synagogues in Berlin and many what was called liberal synagogues, that\nwas the sort of predominant denomination. In spite of the name, the liberal synagogues\nwere about very close to what is called conservative here in this country. The service\nwas almost entirely in Hebrew with only one or two prayers in German, however, in most\nliberal synagogues, organs were also present and otherwise, the service, also the selection\nof prayers, was basically the same as that in the conservative synagogues and much more\nextensive than in the reform synagogues 1n this country, but all of the synagogues were\nessentially the responsibility of this central congregation and also there were a number of\northodox synagogues. But the school into which I was transferred to was from a\nseparatist, very orthodox congregation affiliated with the Agudas Yisrael which is a\nworldwide sort of umbrella organization of orthodox congregations. I think the reason\nwas that school had an excellent reputation, while it obviously taught a lot of Judaism,\nHebrew and Jewish history and so on, but they, of course, they still were governed by the\nGerman education law and had to provide, therefore, all of the curriculum that regular\nGerman schools had to offer in mathematics and science and literature and so on. But,\nobviously, that was a tremendous change for me, a change of cultures. Coming from the\nmilitaristic Nazi school, now to a very orthodox Jewish school which, at the beginning\nwhen I came there, seemed to be without any semblance of discipline. I, myself, have\nalways been somewhat of a rebel in the sense that I resented authority, and even in the\nMommsen Gymnasium, which was governed by this Prussian ex-officer, there were a\nnumber of boys to whom I also belonged to, sort of tried to get away with things. Now\nwhen I came to that Jewish school, I really reveled in the fact that there seemed to be no\ndiscipline at all and people even talked back to their teachers and I must say, I enjoyed\nthat very much and in spite of that, the funny thing is I learned. The thing is that the\nexcuse for extreme discipline is always that it is needed in order for the kids to learn, I\nmean I realize there has to be a certain amount of discipline, but in the German schools,\nat least at the Nazi time, that was an ideology by itself, in its own right, discipline, of\ncourse, as a preparation for later military.",
        "A: I don't, no I didn't. In fact, one, I remember that one of my non-Jewish, we weren't\nreally friends, but we sort of spent some time together frequently in school during\nintermissions and so on, recess is the word, recess, he was, he had joined the Hitler Youth\nand he had given me a small Hitler Youth pennant with a swastika which I proudly\ndisplayed. And, unfortunately, it turned out that on that day we had, at home a party, I\nforgot what the cause was, there were relatives there and, of course, all the people who\ncame were Jews, and in the middle of it, I burst with my swastika flag and holding it\nproudly and marched in there. And I remember that my mother took me very forcefully\nby my arm, took me out to my room and gave me a horrific beating and told me that I\nshould never dare to bring that flag home and she tore it up and I felt terribly sorry for\nmyself and felt as a victim of, but as I said, that was in the beginning when I felt that\nbeing Jewish was basically a punishment and it took a number of jolts for me to realize\nreally what was behind that and also what my Judaism really meant to me. The\nantisemitism that I encountered was mainly from the teachers. That principal, maybe I\nforgot to mention that he also taught, that was I think common in German schools, and he\nwas our math teacher and he made frequent antisemitic remarks and derogatory remarks\nabout Jews in his mathematics class. And then we had a German teacher who was, if\nanything, even worse and, on the other hand, some of the older teachers were very\ndemocratic. Our Latin teacher was an elderly gentleman, in fact was the only teacher\nwith whom, to whom my mother took me after I left school, very, from one day to the\nnext, to say goodbye. And he lived only a few blocks away from us and we went there\nand he was, I still remember, very nice to me and shook my hand and wished me all the\nbest of luck for my future. So, I think some of the older teachers were definitely not\nNazis and most of the younger ones were. In addition, of course, the principal who was\nan elderly gentleman, he must have been already in his late 50's at that time.",
        "A: I felt hurt, basically. I felt that, I mean, it was really like a physical slap in the face,\nexcept this was not physical but emotional. I mean, I felt, even at that time, that the men\nhad no reason to attack me that way.",
        "A: I don't remember it, but it's possible that I did. I don't, I mean there are many things\nthat I don't really understand about my parents and I feel in a way terrible about it. Of\ncourse, in the beginning I was too little, but later on I was a teenager and then finally an\nupper teenager and even 20 years old by the time they were arrested. And, but I don't\nreally understand many of the actions they took and their motivations. That is one of the\nthings I have been trying for years and years sort of to reconstruct, no understanding now\nhow they thought and what their mental sort of outlook was to explain why they acted the\nway they did. It's very difficult, for example, my father's decision during the first years\nof Hitler not to emigrate was based, that is one thing, one of the few things I can\nunderstand, as strange as it may sound. But the thing was that Jewish lawyers, a large\ngroup of, the majority Jewish lawyers were disbarred within a few weeks after the Nazis\ntook power. There were two groups of lawyers which were exempted, one were the front\nline soldiers from World War I, which my father was not, the other one were lawyers\nwho had already been admitted to the bar under the Kaiser, that means before the\noutbreak of World War I and that's the category my father fell in. And many of the\nlawyers who were then disbarred lost their livelihood over night and the only thing they\ncould do, unless they wanted to dig ditches in Germany, was to emigrate, and most of\nthem did. On the other hand, my father always considered himself lucky that he was\nexempted because at each stage of the Nazi development of their antisemitic policies, the\nJews always were under the illusion that this is the way, okay, the Nazis want to do\nbusiness and that's, but we can live with it and that's the way it's going to remain. In\nretrospect, the fact that my father was in one of the exempted groups, was not his luck,\nbut it was his death sentence because otherwise he would have left Germany. In fact, one\nremark I still remember vividly, when the others urged him to emigrate, he would say,\nhere I am a lawyer, if I go to New York, all I can become is a dishwasher, and what shall\nI do with German law in New York? You know, logically, that made total sense, in '35,\nwho would have ever thought of gas chambers? Plus, the thought also was that since\nHitler was constantly breaking agreements with the Allies, and particularly with Britain\nand France, that one of these days they would have enough and just take care of him. At\nthat time, their military force was still much bigger than that of Germany and my father\nthought if I stay here, then I'll just pick up where I left off in '33 and all of that, you\nknow, if I think back, really made sense. In the framework, I mean putting myself into\nthe framework of my parents at that time and, of course, ignoring the history that\noccurred later which you know ts just hindsight. I mean, obviously, my parents also\nwere, and that may have been in general in those days, very sort of withdrawn in terms of\nsay financial things and so on. I mean, they never discussed any of these things with us\neven as I got older, but I am now certain, looking back that the income of my father from\nhis law practice, must have plummeted. Because, first of all, many of his clients were\ngentiles and there was, if a German gentile, so called Aryan, appeared in court with a\nJewish lawyer, that already was not one strike, but 10 strikes against him. And most of\nthe judges were fierce Nazis. So, who would want a Jewish lawyer? And so I'm sure that\nmost of the non-Jewish clients must have left him. Of course, he may have picked up\nsome Jewish clients because from those Jewish lawyers who were disbarred, I don't know\nhow that evened out, but I'm fairly certain that his income must have declined after '33.\nHe had actually a very well going practice, he had, I remember he used to talk about one\nof the most famous German movie actresses he represented in her divorce and then he\nhad some members of the Hohenzollern family, that was the family of the last German\nKaiser. In fact, the nephew of the Kaiser and his mother who was a sister-in-law of the\nKaiser, were his clients. And, in fact, they stuck with him until the end, that's very\ninteresting. But his, their cases did never involve court appearances, he drew up personal\nwills for them and made property arrangements and advice and things like that, where he\ndidn't really appear in public for them.",
        "A: In the beginning, I must say also one thing, is my parents, in retrospect, must have\nmade heroic efforts to insulate us children from all of these events. Initially, we didn't\nnotice anything, in fact, that is a little story that I didn't really plan to tell you, but I was,\nin January of '33, I was 10 years old then and I had scarlet fever, it's a childhood disease\nwhich doesn't exist anymore, but in those days kids had it. And our pediatrician who was\nalso a distant relative, it was still in the days of house calls, came every day and looked\nme over, looked into my throat and so on, and he came at a certain time, in the morning at\nsome point. And it was sort of a regular routine, the bell would ring, my mother would\ncome into my room with him and then he would examine me. On one day, and now I\nknow it was the 30th of January, 1933, instead of coming in, my mother and he were\noutside the door of my room, but with the door closed, and sort of in a low voice which I\ncouldn't understand, kept talking and talking and talking. And finally they came in and I\nwas very sort of disappointed, not only because of the change in routine, but somehow I\nwasn't that important and they talked and then I asked them what's the matter, and my\nmother said in a grave voice, Hitler has just been appointed Chancellor. And at that time,\nit sort of went 1n here, out there, it didn't mean anything. I knew I was 10 years old, so I,\nthe German, there had been several elections before so the house walls and public places\nwere plastered with election placards and so I remember having seen, vote for Hitler and\nvote for Tahlmann who was the Communist party leader, and vote for this man, and\nGermany also had many parties. And, so vaguely the name Hitler rang a bell, but I had\nno idea basically who he was, what he stood for and so on. Now, coming specifically to\nyour question, the first real change was that eviction from the Mommsen Gymnasium.\nBefore that, the laws, there were laws of course, as I said, about disbarring lawyers, didn't\naffect me and, unfortunately, it did not affect my father either. Then there were many\nother, there weren't too many laws, until '35, in '35 the so called Nuremberg laws were\npassed which actually defined Jews as second class citizens, but that also had no\nimmediate effect, the main effect was also that Jews not only could not marry gentiles, I\nmean, Aryan gentiles, but even the act of intercourse without being married was a\npunishable offense, but obviously, I was 12, 13 years old then, that was the last thing on\nmy mind. And second class citizenship had, of course, trickled through and had many\nother effects which at that point did not affect me. But, as I said, the eviction from the\nschool did and but also, our lifestyle never changed, I mean we went, my parents went on\ntheir summer vacations and my sister and I went to our camps and we had, I mean we\nwere clothed, we had food to eat and, in fact, oh yeah, one big change also was that the\nNazis were totally obsessed with the idea that the Jews were sort of spoiling the German\nrace and most Jewish families, at least middle and upper middle classes, had maids and in\nthose days maids were usually live-in maids, and one of the outgrowths of the Nuremberg\nlaws was that any Jewish household which has a male, a Jewish male in the household,\nwas forbidden to have a German maid who is below 45 years of age. So, we had, I think\nwe had one at that time so we had to dismiss her and took an older woman. You could\ntake an older one, I mean it was all that obsession with that maybe a Jew would then\nfather an illegitimate child with such a maid. I don't know, maybe there were such cases,\nbut they were, it was almost a sickness with the Nazis. Anyway, I then started at the\nJewish school and I remember there were several kids besides myself in my grade who\nstarted new there. Now, we were up to grade level in all the general subjects like math,\nGerman and so on, but in the Jewish subjects, and particularly in Hebrew, our classmates\nwere already freely translating the Torah, the Tenach, the entire bible, from English, from\nHebrew into German, and I could barely sort of read stammeringly and so did the others.\nSo they instituted a sort of second track Hebrew for us assimilated kids; and for the first\nclass the principal, a Dr. Schlesinger came in to give us a little pep talk about the\nimportance of knowing Hebrew for Jewish children. And after he was finished, he said,\nokay, tomorrow will be the first, now he dismissed us, tomorrow will be the first real\nclass and we are supposed to bring, he wrote on the board a certain grammar by so and so\nwhich you could buy at some book store that he named, and a copy of the Chumash. And\nas soon as he said that, my arm shot up and he pointed at me and I asked, what is a\nChumash. And that question completely floored that principal. He couldn't imagine a\nJewish boy asking, being so unbelievably ignorant that he wouldn't know what a\nChumash is. And so all he could, yeah and also, he was a short, very thin, wiry man with\na reddish goatee, bald head but a fringe of red hair around the back of his head and his\nentire head, as I remember it, turned red just as his beard, he walked toward me and\nfinally, I guess he took some time to think about what to say, and then he said, you are a\nJew and you don't know what a Chumash is? And, of course, that question totally\ndemolished me and I sat down and felt as if I had said something. . .\nEnd of side one of tape one.",
        "A: Yeah, my immediate reaction was that I was totally embarrassed by the principal's\nremark and, but soon, as a result of the very strong Jewish education which was part of\nthe curriculum in that school, I started to become more and more interested in that. The\nname of the school, actually that is very important, was Adass Jisroel, it means Jewish\nCongregation, a Jewish Community. And we came to the point even where I decided that\nI wanted to become a rabbi when I grew up, which very much upset my father,\nparticularly. I started to go regularly to Shabbat services in. * * * Berlin had many\nsynagogues and, as I said before, there was only one congregation which ran all of the\nsynagogues in Berlin and also the rabbis, therefore, were not confined to one synagogue,\nso one didn't have to put up with the same rabbi Shabbat after Shabbat the way it is here,\nfor example, in this country, where each congregation has its own rabbi, but instead, the\nrabbis circulated. But, obviously, Berlin is a big city and it was taken for granted that\nthey would take public transport to go to the various synagogues which were widely\nscattered in different parts of the city. So, I particularly became very fond of two rabbis\nwho were both very dynamic and also gave me a lot of moral support in their sermons.\nOne was Dr. Max Nussbaum who later emigrated to this country and became rabbi in\nHollywood, California. And the other one was Dr. Manfred Swarsenski who came to this\ncountry and actually founded a synagogue in Madison, Wisconsin. I never saw\nNussbaum again, but Swarsenski I visited in the mid-'60's when I went to a scientific\nconference in Madison. I knew he was there so I contacted him before and we set up a\nluncheon, we spent several hours together just talking and reminiscing. I, yeah, in that,\nso the years went by from '35 to '38 and by 1938, I must have been about in 10th grade\nand in October, 1938, the German police arrested all Jews who had Polish passports,\novernight, without any prior warning, in fact, they came in the early morning hours. And\nput them on, into railroad cars which were all ready prepared beforehand and they were\nshipped off to Poland and the only thing the German saw to it was that they had their\nPolish passports with them because by International law, the Poles had to admit anyone\nwho had a valid Polish passport. And there were quite a number of kids from my class\naffected by that and even a few teachers who didn't appear the next day.",
        "A: It was terrible, I mean, I still remember, I mean these kids, that was actually the first\nfore taste of the later deportations. I mean, people just vanished overnight, the day before\nnobody knew anything, they didn't know, we didn't know and on the next day, they just\ndidn't appear in school. Our Hebrew teacher was one of them and then several kids, one\nof them, but that's beside the point here, I met again 30 years later in Israel where he is,\nby now he must be retired, he was a professor of classical languages at Hebrew\nUniversity.",
        "A: That's true. I mean, that was my, I mean first of all, it's 50, 60 years later, what I\nremember, but I think my memory is pretty good as far as that is concerned, that doesn't\nmean that these regulations didn't exist, but they didn't really touch me personally and, as\nI said, after I've read a lot of what happened in those days, and I see now that my parents\nmust have made a monumental effort to keep things away from us, that's the only\nexplanation I have. One thing that I noticed also maybe in my life, and that was that\nearlier, I think in either late '37 or early '38, all Jewish stores were required to put the\nnames of their owners in letters of a prescribed size on the store window in, and not in an\nartistic way, so in a way that identified the store as a Jewish store because no other store,\nin white paint of a prescribed size, but again, we didn't have a store, I just noticed it, that\nthis is what was happening. Another thing that happened also, was that all Jews were\nforced to adopt an additional middle name, males the name Israel and females the name\nSara. In this country there are many non-Jews, Jewish women, who are called Sarah, but\nin Germany, the name Sarah is totally unknown, it was purely a Jewish name and Israel,\nanyway, so, and also the law stipulated not only that we had to take those names, but that\nwe had to use it, particularly in all communications with government agencies or also\nwith commercial enterprises and so on. Like, I had to call myself Ernest Israel Fontheim,\nwritten out. And my father had to do the same thing. It was, of course, also a\nhumiliation and in addition to that, it was a sort of signal for the recipient, this is a Jew\nwho is writing to me.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right, at that time there were no restrictions of any sort to our life, we could go to\nmovies, theaters, I could go to, now there were places which on their own initiative, had\nposted signs, Jews, \"Juden unerwinscht\", that means Jews are not desired here, actually\nto translate it literally, but what it means really, Jews forbidden. That was already, there\nwere, for example, many benches on parks, because again the Nazis with their obsession\nwith sex, had that idea that maybe a German woman might sit on a park bench and then\nsome Jewish man might sit next to her and start to, some dirty business with her and so a\nGerman woman cannot be expected to sit next to a Jew on a park bench. But whatever,\nthat started up and then, as I said, certain, maybe some restaurants, but we didn't go much\nto restaurants anyway, SO...",
        "A: At that time, I don't remember it, I remember it, obviously having read about it, but\nthat happened I think in '33 or '34 and I was 10 or 11 years old and so...",
        "A: That's correct, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, I mean that I should mention. They were, there was a stream of people\nwho emigrated, you know, some uncle, some cousin, you know, and there was always\nfarewells and friends of mine, their parents emigrated and, of course, the kid then went\nalong. I should say I had a best friend in this Adass Jisroel school, he was a boy, a very\ninteresting boy, in fact, we became best friends initially because we both were new in that\nclass, but from totally different backgrounds. He came, his parents had moved from\nVienna to Berlin, they were Austrian Jews, but the parents were, of course, born before\nWorld War I like all of our parents and before World War I, the Austro-Hungarian\nEmpire included southern Poland and particularly, most of Galicia, the province, and his\nparents actually were orthodox Jews from Galicia who had, however, left there I think\nbefore the war already and settled in Vienna and so they were then, by citizenship, they\nwere Austrian Jews and they came to Berlin, it might sound strange since Austria at that\ntime was still a democracy, but his father had some business, I think he sort of\nadministered buildings and as an Austrian, he was not subject, he was a foreigner, foreign\nJews were not subject to all these antisemitic laws. So we, and in fact, this friend also\ninfluenced me in that, and I took him also to services to a liberal synagogue with the\norgan and he found that very impressive and so we influenced each other. And we stuck\ntogether, he was a very bright boy and on the 13th of March, 1938, that was the day\nHitler marched into Austria, I'll never forget that. I visited him, I saw his father sit in the\ndining room with his head in his hands like that and crying because he knew that his\ngame was up now, now he was also a German and subject to all the laws. And to see a\nfather cry is an incredibly powerful experience for and also a devastating experience for a\nboy. Totally devastating. And then the parents finally decided to send their boy out to\nEngland, you may know, England had relatively liberal immigration for Jewish children\nand they, they were of course orthodox, and they enrolled him in a Yeshiva in Scotland\nand ostensibly for him to become a rabbi which he never did, but that was the rules under\nwhich he could get out and into England. And that was actually the first personal blow in\nmy life. And also for that reason, I never forgot the date, 1t was January 18, 1938. And I\nwas at the railroad station together with his parents, of course, to say goodbye and he was\nmy best friend and I lost him. But, of course, the year 1938 then had many other, all of\nthose things happening, I mentioned the arrest and deportation of the Polish Jews and\nthen just a few weeks later, two or three weeks later, came the infamous Kristallnacht\nPogrom. Of course, the two events were not unrelated. Among the people who were\narbitrarily arrested and shipped to Poland was an elderly couple, Grynszpan, who, and the\nPoles, of course, claimed they didn't know what to do with all those Jews, so they put\nthem into camps 1n inhuman conditions and they had lived in Germany, I'm not sure\nwhether in Berlin or some other city, anyway, they had a son, Herschel, whom they had\nsent to Paris to relatives because it became, Berlin became too oppressive, and he lived\nwith an uncle in Paris. And when the parents wrote to him a letter of desperation and he\nbecame so furious he obtained a gun and decided to assassinate the German ambassador\nto Paris, but you know, if a 16 year old boy enters an embassy and says he wants to talk\nto the ambassador, that's not whom he's going to see, obviously, and so they ushered him\ninto some underling from, a consular secretary or something, his name was Ernst vom\nRath, and history probably would never know him if it hadn't been for Grynszpan to pull\nhis pistol and assassinate him there. And the German government, on the other hand,\nused that as a pretext to stage these pogroms and that was starting the night, from\nNovember 9th to 10th, for several days. I mean, synagogues were burned, Jewish shops\nand now, of course, you see, since the Jewish shops all had to be labeled with the names\nof the owner, it never said Jewish shop, but it was known that the stores which had the\nname of the owner in this particular prescribed way, these were the Jewish stores so it\nwas clear for the mob which windows to smash and loot.",
        "A: Yeah, on that day in the morning, where we lived there were, at least on my way to\nthe station, I had to take a commuter train to the city, to that school, I didn't pass any\nshops, they were all just apartment houses, so I knew nothing. That was the morning of\nthe 10th, now, it was a Thursday. So I took the train and I went to school and as soon as I\nwas in the school, I realized what was on, first of all, many kids weren't there and those\nwho were there told horror stories of passing shops that had been smashed and looted.\nAnd then the next thing that was unusual is, as you know, the school day starts at eight\nsharp, the bell is ringing and then the normal thing would be that the teacher would\nappear at the crack of the bell, no teacher not just in our class, but in the neighboring, in\nno class any teacher was to be seen. And after some time, I don't remember it was a half\nan hour, whatever, all the teachers came from the teacher's conference room with the\nfollowing instructions, that there was unrest all over Berlin and the safety of the school\ncannot be guaranteed and furthermore, we should go home but we should go home alone,\nif we go in groups that might attract mobs and just a single boy, you know, can sort of\nslip under, unrecognized and also we should not go to friends because our parents might\nget worried, we should only go the shortest way and fastest way home so the parents\nknow we are safe, and there won't be any school for the time being, we will be notified\nwhen the school will start up again.",
        "A: Yes. The commuter train was an elevated train and it passed by the synagogue where\nI had my bar mitzvah and what I saw there was really one of the worst horror shocks in\nmy life. It was a beautiful building with huge, three huge domes, sort of in Moorish style\nand from the center dome came a huge thick column of smoke. When I saw that I\nbecame so obsessed that I forgot the warning that was given to us to go straight home. At\nthe next train stop I left the train and I raced back to the building, to the synagogue and\nwhat I saw there is there was a mob of people across the street, held back by a police line\nand the fire department was there hosing down adjacent buildings so to prevent the\nflames from doing damage to German property and no hose was directed at the\nsynagogue and that, I just stood there, I was totally sort of hypnotized. That was\nsomething; I couldn't even imagine that something like that could happen. And then,\nthere were many antisemitic sort of shouts from the mob, I mean like, I don't know, throw\nout the Jews or kill the Jews and it never occurred to me that I was one in the middle of\nthat mob. And then suddenly somebody said that in the house where, against which the\nmob was sort of standing looking at the synagogue, on the ground floor somebody knew\nthere was a Jew living. So there were immediate shouts, let's get them. And then the\nmob turned its back to the synagogue and burst into the house itself and then I heard sort\nof heavy blows against the apartment door and I was way outside, I couldn't see what was\nhappening there. And all I could think was, I hope that the door is going to hold and I\nremember that was sort of as if I was trying to influence the door to hold, but of course, it\ndidn't and I could hear sort of splintering wood and then after that there was total silence,\nit lasted for minutes, not a sound. And then I heard again shouts like, get them, get them,\nand then there was an elderly man, all I remember seeing, he had a huge bald head, he\nwas probably sixty, or I don't know how old he was, and then from all sides there were\nblows and his face soon was completely bloodied. And suddenly there was a young man\nwho shouted, you cowards, so many all fighting against one single guy. And then some\nothers tried to attack that man and sort of pushed him away. And then once he was\npushed through the crowd, there was police already waiting in a car as if this was all\nstaged, I have no idea and he was pushed off into the car and the police drove him off.\nAnd after I saw that, I turned around and went back to the train and went home. So the\nyear 1938 was really for me, it was a big turning point. It started out with the emigration\nof my best friend which was a tremendous personal loss for me, then the arrest of the\nPolish Jews, who I also knew quite a number including some of my teachers and then the\nKristallnacht. So I stayed home as we were told on Friday. And on Saturday one of my\nfriends had a birthday party that already was long planned and so I went to it, and we had\nhardly come there when somebody, I think one of the boys came in saying that his father\nhad just been arrested by the Gestapo and that the Gestapo is arresting the Jewish men.\nSo the party never took place, we all immediately raced, in those days, Saturday was a\nweekday, so my father was in his office and actually it was not too far, it was several\nblocks from where the birthday party was supposed to take place. So I raced to his office\nand just when I came in, he said he had just received an urgent telephone call from a\ncolleague, a German, an Aryan colleague to see him immediately on an important matter\nand he asked me to come along. I was at that time 16 years old and so we went, that\ncolleague was two blocks from my father's office and was a certain Dr. Kiilz. He was a\nfew years somewhat younger than my father and his father, Dr. Kiilz's father, had also\nhimself been a lawyer, but more importantly, he had been Minister of the Interior in one\nof the pre-Hitler governments of the Weimar Republic and in Germany, like I think in\nmany European countries, the police is within the Interior Ministry sort of an agency, I\nmean like somewhat comparable to the FBI here, which is in the Justice Department. But\nthere the police, the entire police organization, is national, it's not local like 1n this\ncountry. And anyway, the father still had close contacts to high police officials and had\nlearned, therefore, of this action against, for the arrest of Jewish men and in those days,\nalso, everybody was paranoiac, partly with justification, that the Gestapo was listening on\ntelephone calls, so therefore, the son who my father actually knew the son better than the\nfather, who had, I think, done legal cases together with him, and the son did not say\nanything over the phone, just told my father to see him in his office on an important\nmatter. And my father then was ushered in and asked me to stay outside in the waiting\nroom and they were quite a time together there and then they came out again and my\nfather told me that that lawyer had warned him not to go back to his office or, of course,\nnot to his own apartment and to, it is safe, however, to stay at places where there are no\nJewish males. Fortunately, my father's sister, who was a widow and she had three\nchildren, two daughters and a son. One daughter had already emigrated to Argentina, and\nthe son had just left a few months or so before Kristallnacht also for Argentina. So it was\njust his sister and the remaining daughter. So in other words, there were no males in that\nhousehold. So my father immediately went there, and the Gestapo came both to our\napartment and also to the office to inquire and, of course, we told them he left and didn't\ntell us where he was going, and in those days the Gestapo still took these relatively stupid\nexcuses and just reappeared a few random times maybe hoping to catch him, but didn't,\nand that was the second great stroke of luck that my father had after having been\npermitted to practice law. The thing was that the Gestapo immediately let 1t be known\nthat those Jews who were arrested were put into concentration camps, with the Berlin\nJews mainly in the camp Sachsenhausen which is north of Berlin. And the treatment, of\ncourse, was horrible, full of sadism and physical brutality. However, in those days at\nleast there was no killing, no mass killings, I think a few Jews actually did die due to just\nmistreatment, but I mean which 1s horrible enough in its own right, but at least most\nsurvived and the Gestapo let it be known that anyone whose family can produce an\nemigration visa to another country will be immediately released and will have to leave\nthe country within one month, giving him one month's time to wind up affairs and so on.\nSo, but as I said, my father was lucky, he was warned, he was never arrested and, of\ncourse, the Jewish relief organizations from the Joint here in America to the local ones in\nGermany, now put high pressure on and the first priority to get those Jews immigration\nvisas to somewhere, anywhere in the world, just to get them out, I mean those who were\nin concentration camps, to save their lives, to get them out.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, I mean that is, no Gestapo, by its very nature is a secret police, they\nwere in civilian and they were, I mean not conspicuous, even though they themselves\nwere everywhere and they had a whole army of informers who were not actually Gestapo\nbut reported to them. And that was a network, throughout Germany, maybe I neglected\nto say that, that belongs much earlier. As soon as Hitler assumed power, there were\nfrequent marches by the SA on, they had a fascination with marches, as I said, this\nMommsen Gymnasium, after that Nazi officer took over, one of the things he introduced,\nas I explained, was during the lunch hour, after eating lunch, we always marched around\nthe street singing songs. But the SA, at every, whatever occasion or even no occasion,\nthey would march around and one of their favorite songs, incidentally, was\n\"Und wenn das Judenblut vom Messer spritzt, dann geht's nochmal so gut.\"\nwhich translated means, if Jewish blood squirts from the knives then things will go quite\nas well. I mean, to sing a song like that, I mean I listened to it even at that time, but the\nolder I get, the more incredible it seems to me that somebody, I mean even who hates\nsome group, to make that into a song is so unbelievable that it defies description.\nAnother song which was a favorite was, I'll say it in German first,\n\"Wir werden weiter marschieren,\nauch wenn alles in Scherben fallt,\ndenn heute gehort uns Deutschland\nund morgen die ganze Welt.\"\nthat means, we will continue to march and even if everything breaks down and falls into\npieces, because today Germany belongs to us and tomorrow the entire world. And so,\nand they had all kinds of other songs, obviously, I mean these are the things that I never\nforgot.",
        "A: Yeah, I mean I found it, I mean there were other things that were alarming also.\nThere was a weekly newspaper called Der Stiirmer, the storm trooper, maybe you've\nheard of it. It was published by the Nazi governor of the province of Franconia, a man\nnamed Julius Streicher, and which was full of antisemitic articles and also totally fixated\non the sexual aspect of antisemitism. The paper, I mean apparently calling to that Jews\nhad infinite sexual appetites and particularly for little innocent blond German girls to\nseduce them, that was somehow a Jewish command to do that, I mean it was just\nincredible, I mean the man must have been sick himself, or whoever wrote these stories.\nAnd, of course, sometimes they were true. They would intermix it with some true stories,\nwhere sometimes a Jew was convicted of some crime. Usually the crimes Jews were\nconvicted of were such things as smuggling money out. In Germany foreign exchange\nwas strictly controlled, because the whole economy was managed and controlled, but you\nknow Jews, rather than letting the Nazis take it all away from them, sometimes tried to\nsmuggle some money out and in some cases they succeeded and in other cases they were\ncaught, and that was always touted as a big crime against the German nation. And of\ncourse, the story always was that the Jew, they came with nothing and now they are rich,\nso that is all just taken away from the Germans. And stories like that, and then of course,\nthere were also true stories of where a Jew somehow was caught having had a\nrelationship with a non-Jewish girl and if that happened, then the Jew usually came to a\nconcentration camp and those Jews who were there for, there was actually a term, a\nGerman term for that, which translated means sort of defilement of the race. And they\nwere mercilessly tortured and punished and usually, if they weren't shot outright, just\ndied of torture. So that newspaper was not just sold at newsstands, but they had sort of\ndisplay cases on various strategic points, like in busy railroad stations and so on. And\nusually I ignored it, but sometimes I sort of went there and read it and somehow I did not\nrelate it to me, it's a funny thing.\nEnd of tape one\nTape 2",
        "A: What I, what affected me actually more than these vicious articles in the Sturmer,\nwere antisemitic articles in the general press and I also felt at that time and still feel\ntoday, that they probably were much more effective in influencing people than the\nSttirmer articles because the articles in the Sttirmer, most of them at least, were so\noutlandish that, and also they were always accompanied by horrible caricatures where a\nJew looked like a, maybe a mixture of a gorilla and a human being and totally distorted,\nthat I am sure many people just couldn't take it seriously, on the other hand, that\nantisemitic articles in the general press, which were more sort of subdued and not as\noutwardly ridiculous, and therefore, also probably appeared more reasonable, probably\ninfluenced many more people toward increased antisemitism. And they were, for\nexample, I have to admit that to some extent, even I was influenced by the constant\nrefrain of the German press was that the Jews were in charge of all the countries that\nwere fighting against Germany, particularly of course, the United States, and there was a\nwhole succession of names that always appeared, one was that, of course, of Felix\nFrankfurter, the supreme court justice, another one was Herbert Lehman, the governor of\nthe state of New York, I remember, and there were one or two others. Oh, yeah, of\ncourse, Bernard Baruch, the financier and they made it appear as if they are, these people\nwere sort of behind the scenes manipulating and, of course, Roosevelt himself, whose\nname was often distorted as Rosenfeld, implying that if he wasn't a Jew at least he was of\nJewish descent. And after the war, particularly after meeting American soldiers, and\nmany of them Jewish, I was surprised actually to hear that there was large scale\nantisemitism in this country and that the influence of these Jews was a relatively minimal.\nOh, I forgot one name, of course, that was Henry Morgenthau, the Secretary of the\nTreasury at that time. He was probably, I would say, from what I can judge reading\nhistory, the most influential, in the government at least, of the United States and I think\nhe was fairly close to President Roosevelt. But it was nothing like that and as the Nazis,\nand I was, I have to admit now, disappointed because somehow that part of the Nazi\npropaganda I had started to believe somewhat. And then, by the way, the same thing in\nthe Soviet Union, you know, there were lots of Jewish names, many of these were\nactually exterminated by Stalin himself, and particularly, many of the original\nrevolutionaries, and starting with Trotsky, of course. And there too, actually, the fact that\nthere was wide spread antisemitism in the Soviet Union, never made it into the German\npapers, 1t wouldn't have fit their purposes. Okay, now, the Kristallnacht was not only a,\njust devastating horrible event in my personal life as well as the lives of all Jews in\nGermany, but it represented a watershed because that was followed by a avalanche of\nnew laws and regulations totally restricting Jews. What affected us first of all was that\nthe remaining Jewish lawyers were now disbarred. So suddenly my father was not only\nliving in an antisemitic hotbed like Germany, but on top of it, he was unemployed here\nand my parents made, then from then on really, desperate efforts to get out of the country.\nAnd, but it was, by that time everybody had woken up and I remember once standing in\nfront of the British Consulate in Berlin which was in the embassy compound, arriving\nthere at six in the morning, just to get some form to fill out and I think by eleven or\ntwelve or so, finally it was my turn to receive those forms. I don't know what ever\nhappened, but I don't think, but obviously they didn't go to England and neither did I, so I\nstood there for nothing. And then, also, that was followed by laws making it illegal for a\nJew to visit any place of amusement or entertainment or general culture, that included the\nwhole spectrum, I mean from theater, symphony, opera to circuses, county fairs kind of\nthing, you name it. Also, public beaches, swimming, public swimming pools, movie\ntheaters, public parks even. Parks were much more popular in Germany than they are\nhere because most people in this country, or at least a high proportion, live in their own\nhomes and have their own gardens, in Germany the vast majority, at least at that time,\nlived in apartments and so parks were visited by people just regularly, just for recreation,\njust like people here might just sit in their back yard. Anyway, they were now outlawed\nfor Jews. I, from the beginning, I and all of my friends, totally ignored the, that law and\nwe just kept going. I remember one rather humorous incident, in the summer of 1940,\nthe Rome State Opera from Rome, Italy, gave a one week guest appearance at the Berlin\nState Opera and I had been an opera fan and on the day when the ticket sales started for\nthe Rome Opera, obviously everybody knew you had to be there early, so I was there, I\nthink, at five in the morning or so, and there was already a long line, and while you stand\nin line, of course, for hours, sort of trotting from left leg to right leg and vice versa, you\nstart also with people around you to get acquainted and talk and so on and the advantage\nof that was that you could then ask somebody to hold your place while you, it's just easier\nto take a little walk than to stand at the same spot, so I did that also. And while I then\ntook my walk, I walked along the line and I saw three other boys from my Jewish high\nschool classroom and it was sort of an unwritten law, you know, one Jew might get away,\ntwo Jews is already like a synagogue, so we just waved at each other with a grin, without\nreally getting together. And most people I knew did that, but there was a danger. I\nmean, if the Gestapo caught somebody, I mean the least thing was a concentration camp,\nbut as a young person, first of all, I was always sort of defying authority and plus, a\nyoung person is always more reckless than an older one. Yeah, let me, actually, in my\npersonal life, what happened then, finally the schools were permitted to operate again\nand, but then, shortly, that was probably late '38, that date I don't quite remember any\nmore precisely, but then in early '39, most Jewish schools were closed by the Gestapo,\nincluding the Adass Jisroel school, to which I was going. And there was only one Jewish\nhigh school left operating and that was the official high school of the Jewish community\nof Berlin, but by that time, my parents were really in high gear trying to emigrate and\nthey had the idea that it would be good for me to go to the American School in Berlin.\nThe American School in Berlin, also it was very close to where we lived, it was run by an\nAmerican principal and it mainly served children of diplomats, I mean not just\nAmericans, obviously, but also British and others who would know English, and also\nchildren of businessmen who were stationed in Berlin. And therefore, the tuition was, of\ncourse, very high and I remember that was the first time sort of I heard about that this\nwas a sort of a big sacrifice for my parents to put me in that school, and actually, I was\nscared because I would be thrown suddenly into a totally English environment, I mean,\nthe teachers were all Americans, some maybe British, actually, and English was the\nlanguage. Most kids had English as their native tongue and I had had three years of\nEnglish at the Adass school. But fortunately, things turned out to be not quite as bad. It\nturned out the school followed the curriculum of sort of the basic American school\nsystem and the German gymnasium was really a much more rigorous and elitist school\nand was at least a year if not more ahead of it, so many of the things, for example, in\nLatin and biology, I remember, we had had already much earlier, so the material itself\nwas often, just for me, a review of things I had learned earlier and, therefore, that made it\neasier for me to concentrate on the language. I think I made quite a bit of progress there,\nI don't know exactly how long I was, I wasn't there very long, probably from about\nFebruary, March '39, until the start of the summer term, which was, I think, May or June\n'39. In '39 also, was a lot, the first summer in my life where my parents didn't send me to\na summer camp. And on the first of September, 1939, of course the German Wehrmacht\nentered Poland, attacked Poland, and I still, I listened to Hitler's speech to the Reichstag\nin which he explained his rationale and I never forget the words which he said, \"since\nfive o'clock this morning, we are shooting back\", I mean the fairy tale that the Nazis told\nthe world was that Poland had attacked Germany and that had been going on already for\ndays and weeks, and while he patiently sort of tried to look the other way and tried to\ncome to a peaceful solution and finally he is not taking it anymore and they are shooting\nback. I mean, it's unbelievable. Okay, anyway, that was a Friday, September 1, and I\nshould say actually two days before, on August 30, that was my father's birthday, 1939,\nmust have been his 57th birthday, and at that time already everything was much more\nsubdued and we didn't have a party at home. We just went out to some nice restaurant\ndowntown. And while we were sitting there, suddenly a newsboy came in with stacks of\nnews, extra editions, shouting extra, extra, you know, and every table bought a paper and\nthe big fat headline was, general mobilization in Poland. And so, everybody knew\nalready, see and in Germany, general mobilization was never officially announced\nbecause the Nazis had already quietly mobilized and then on the first, as I said, Germany\nattacked Poland, it was a Friday. On Sunday the 3rd, we took our customary Sunday\nexcursion, we walked through the forest near where we lived to one of the cafes at the\nriverbank of the Havel River and at that time also, most if not all of the restaurants in\nGermany were sort of wired for public address systems. And while we were sitting there,\nit was early afternoon I think, the public address system went on with an important\nannouncement from the German government, and it said that the British Ambassador had,\nat 11:00, I still remember the time, submitted a diplomatic note saying that, requesting\nthat German troops be taken back to the original German-Polish border within a certain\nnumber of hours. If Germany refused to do that, then Britain in line with its treaty\nobligations to Poland, will consider itself at war with Germany. And the French\nAmbassador had submitted a similar note also. As we were sitting there, I remember that\nmy father broke out into tears and that was the first time that I saw him cry. And he said,\nthis is the Second World War in his lifetime and that he was not going to survive it.\nWhat prompted that remark, I never, it was the Holocaust was still so far away as to be\nunbelievable, but obviously, he must have sensed something. And then we went home.\nAnd then the outbreak of the war was followed then by many more restrictions. One was\nwe had to turn in our telephones, we had to turn in all appliances, of course in those days,\npeople had much fewer than today, but still I mean that included such things as vacuum\ncleaners, phonograph players, I don't know what else one had in those days, it was before\nwashing machines and dishwashers, but whatever one had, it had to be turned in. And in\naddition to. . .",
        "A: Oh, yeah, radio, yeah, I think radios, too, yeah, right. And then some, up to that time\nI think Jews religiously obeyed all these things, and that was the first time where people\nstarted to sort of balk and not everything was turned in. I knew of many cases where\npeople didn't turn in everything. Also, jewelry, valuables, you know, gold, silver,\ndiamonds, things like that, had to be all turned in. And it was just turned in for a receipt,\nin other words, there was not thought of even to, for the government to buy it, it was just\nstolen. And of course, one victim of the outbreak of the war was the American School in\nBerlin which did not reopen because even though America itself at that time was not yet\nin the war, but Germany was in the war and Germany was considered a war zone, there\nwas the possibility of air raids and so on, so anyway, the school didn't reopen. And then\nat that point, I wanted to go back and do my high school graduation so I went back to the\nhigh school of the Jewish community and graduated there in March, 1940. There's a big\ndifference between a high school graduation in Germany, or I think in any European\ncountry, and also England, and that in America. In America, it is simply sort of an\nautomatic thing, after completing 12 years, 12th grade of school you graduate. They had\na rigorous examination, I still remember it was a fearful thing and I studied day and night\nand, I mean, passed it of course, but it was, it ranks in my memory together with my\nPh.D. prelims, I mean each one at their own level. Also, it's a state administered exam,\nso they, from the state education authority, a sort of high official appeared there. Yeah,\nand the way the graduation sort of examination goes, was the following. There was first\na set of written examinations, each three hours long, one was a German composition,\nwhich incidentally, we had several essay topics to choose from. And the topic I chose\nwas the discussion and evaluation of the work of a leading personality of modern times,\nand I chose Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism. And later on my father\nchided me for it and said, since that will be read by a German examination commission\nthat was a mistake that I did that, it might harm me and I said, well, the people know who\nI am, I am a Jew and they know that, that's a Jewish school, so anyway, my father was\nalways very concerned with such things. And actually, I got a very good grade for that.\nAnd mathematics and so on and that takes place over a period of about a month, these\nvarious exams, spaced. And then after that, about I think, after the last exam, maybe two\nor three weeks, comes the oral. And the German examiners, I mean, they get all the\nwritten tests and then one of them appears for the final oral examination. And the oral\nexamination was handled in such a way that the examination commission which\nconsisted of all the teachers that we had in 12th grade, the school principal and the\nGerman official were sitting in the examination room and we were called in one by one,\nwe were 14, 13 or 14, I forgot, I think 13, we were called in. And before that started, we\nwere all called in together and the German official made a little speech and he was a tall\ngood-looking guy, with a white thick mane of hair, and such a huge swastika party\nmember button here. And, which didn't particular make us, or at least me, feel easy. And\nhe, I don't know, he said a few things, but then he went on to say that he has read so far\nour written examinations and he wanted to make us a compliment, he said they are far\nabove the average of what he has seen and he wanted to particularly compliment us\nbecause he is aware of the difficult circumstances under which we are living. And then\nhe dismissed us and that man was obviously, you know, he must have been a holdover\nfrom the Weimar Republic, he was old enough anyway for that, and many of these guys\nwere pressured into joining the party or losing their job, and so they all, not all I guess,\nbut many, compromised and joined the party, but that man obviously, to have said that,\ntook already courage. So, anyway, that was the examination and then after that, I was,\nanyway very Zionist inclined, so I volunteered for one of the preparatory camps for\nemigration to Israel, or Palestine in those days. And there was, they were named by the\nHebrew name Hachsharah means preparation. And, but I discovered that I was totally\nunsuited for communal living, I felt totally unhappy. I mean, the living there was sort of\nto simulate kibbutz style living, you know, and I was constantly homesick and didn't like\nit at all. And then for me, fortunately actually, that camp was dissolved for some reason\nand people were distributed partly to other camps and partly to a work camp in a suburb\nof Berlin and that's where I was put and that was in a southern suburb of Berlin and we\nwere just a small group of boys, there wasn't more than 10, detailed to work in a forest\nwhich was managed by a forestry official to cut down certain trees that were diseased.\nAnd I still remember that must have been the healthiest time of my life. It was by that\ntime, midsummer of 1940, and we were working all bare-chested, just some shorts on and\nsawing down, that was in the days before chain saws and all that, I mean it was really\nhand sawing, these long band saws where one man grabs the handle at one end and the\nother on the other and you go back and forth. And then after the tree has been felled,\nthen with an ax all the branches had to be cut, apparently they were diseased, but still\ncould be used for some purpose, because we had to hack off with axes all of the branches\nand then with a special peeler, peel the bark off so that just the bare trunk remained. And\nthe local forester was sort of a fairly decent guy, I mean he got us as Jews, oh yeah, I\nshould have said that with the outbreak of World War I, of course, immediately food\nwas rationed. And not only food, also clothing, everything, shoes, everything you can\nthink of, all consumer goods were rationed. And Jews from the beginning, got less than\nthe, the ration system was a three tiered system, the lowest was called the general\nconsumer and then a higher, the next step up was workers cards, these are for like factory\nworkers, they got certain items more like I think fat, milk, maybe meat, I don't know.\nAnd then the highest category was heavy labor, these were people like construction,\nminers, you know, in the coal mines, this sort of thing. But, first of all, Jews were not\nentitled to any worker's cards even if they did do some work where Germans would have\nreceived them. And then our rations were actually shortened even compared to the\ngeneral consumer. But the forester there, since he wanted also to get work out of us and\nhe knew you know hungry people are not as strong, so he got actually through the local\nNazi \"Bauern\" or farmer leader, peasant leader, whatever, extra rations for us of farmers\nbread and sausages which were actually delicious. And we were sort of a really nice little\ncommunity there and I spent the summer there and occasionally we had furloughs where\nI could go into the city to visit my parents and so that was over, I think, in the fall of\n1940. And then my parents still hoping that maybe something will come of the\nemigration attempts, my parents did all kinds of things that I never really was aware of\nfully. And there was, in Berlin, a mechanics school from ORT, O-R-T, you know that\nexists still today in many countries, and they had a school sort of for mechanics and\nmachine working and so I started there sometime in the fall of 1940, and by that time,\nhowever, already the Germans started to draft Jews into factories, namely to replace\nGerman workers who had been drafted into the Army, to the Wermacht. But, my parents\nwere lucky, they somehow they were able to produce doctor's certificates so to exempt\nthem from the \"Arbeitseinsatz\", that means forced labor, basically. And I was exempted\nbecause I worked in that mechanics school.",
        "A: No, yeah, actually, it must have been telepathy, I just thought of my sister. She went,\nfirst of all, when she went to school, initially she started in the German public school, but\nwas then transferred by my parents to a Jewish school, but a much less religious Jewish\nprivate school and when all of these schools were dissolved in early '39, just like the\nschool I was in, she was transferred to another school, a Jewish school of the Jewish\ncommunity. And then there she was until, but that came later, I think in '41, all schooling\nfor Jewish children was simply outlawed by the Gestapo. But until then, she went to\nschool and had her friends, in fact, she had already a little boy friend.",
        "A: When schooling was forbidden, no I think first of all, she was sent also to the country\nfor, there was, some young Jewish kids were sent to help in harvesting, you know, things\nin the country. And then when she came back from there, the deportations were already\ngoing strong.",
        "A: Yeah. They were supportive, but that time they wanted to get me out, in fact, we\nalready applied for a passport and, in fact, that is one also incident I remember where we\nwent, the passport office was actually part of the Jewish emigration office, which was\nheaded by Adolf Eichmann, and we applied there for a passport for me and for someone\nhere to come along, probably because I was a minor or something. And while we were\nstanding in line, I mean you went sort of from one position to the next filling out forms\nand answering questions or whatever, while we were standing in line two very tall and\nvery good looking SS officers sort of walked across the waiting room where people are\nstanding in line, and for some reason, one of them just got pulled to my father for some\nreason, and walked towards him and asked him why we were waiting there and my father\nanswered that this is my son and he is preparing to emigrate to Palestine and then he said,\noh, and then he answered, he asked my father, is he going with the Hechalutz? And sort\nof in perfect Hebrew, and my father said, yes and then he just turned around and walked\naway. And I don't, my father didn't seem nervous and so on, but I'm sure he must have\nbeen extremely, you know, that guy was, he looked very aggressive and I mean like the\nimage of an SS officer. Anyway, so in fact, that passport I still have, part of my\ncherished memories, with a big J which after the war I found out, we actually owe the\nSwiss more than the Germans. Did you ever read about that? That the Swiss pressured\nthe Germans to put the J because Germany and Switzerland had a treaty for tourist visas,\nnot to need visas for tourism, but that apparently Jews discovered and went there as\ntourists with their German passports, but then didn't leave. And the Swiss didn't like that\nand so they told the Germans to do something, put a J in or whatever so that they can\nimmediately recognize the passport of a Jew and then they can refuse them. These nice,\nneutral Swiss. Yeah, anyway, coming back, where was I? Oh, yeah, I went to ORT to\nlearn mechanics. And actually that turned out to be one of the more useful things I\nlearned in my life, probably more useful than Latin or, I don't know, but anyway, I\nlearned how to operate a lathe, although that I have never done later, and operate various\ntools. And, as I said, at that time also they started to draft Jews, and on April 30, 1941,\nalso, oh no, I'm sorry, I have to back up there. I want to say that in February of 1941, we\nreceived a notice that we have to vacate the huge apartment that we still occupied on the\nKaiserdamm. That was one of the major boulevards of Berlin, within a few days. That\nwas an action that was actually originated by Albert Speer who was a German armaments\nminister and also in charge of construction in Berlin and he always tried after the war to\nsort of pretend that he was just a professional and did his thing for the armaments, but\nhad nothing to do whatsoever with persecution of Jews or other minorities. Which is a\nbig lie, I mean that was one of the things which he did, to kick Jews out of their\napartments and Jews who were kicked out in this way, had to move in then, were\nrestricted to move into so called Jew houses. These were apartment buildings where at\nleast 50% of the tenants were already Jews and then also, you couldn't by any means, of\ncourse, displace a German family in such a house. But you had to move into sort of a\nsublet, into an apartment already inhabited by another Jewish family. And that was a big\nblow, that was a huge, we had a huge apartment, of course, I never had mentioned that so\nfar. But it was an eight room apartment and there were many art pieces in there that my\nparents had collected, of course, in better times, many oriental rugs and I did mention the\nbig library that my father had. And so, I mean just to, and of course, if I think today for\nexample, if we had to move out of our house, which I think in square footage may be\nsmaller than that apartment, that would be a nightmare within a few days. You know,\nyou accumulate so many things, personal things, documents, whatever, pictures, and but\nin addition to that, a new apartment had to be found, a new room or rooms in another\napartment. Anyway, to make a long story short, we thought we had an ideal solution,\nmoving into the apartment of an uncle of my mother. Now, he was, the man was the\nbrother of my maternal grandfather and his wife and it was a much smaller apartment,\nand they were living there and they had a son in the mid or late 30's and then two single\nwomen were already living there also who had been kicked out somewhere else.\nEnd of side one of tape two.",
        "A: Of course, we were not the only family living under such circumstances, it was\nthroughout the Jewish community that Jews were cramped together. That, I guess, was\nthe equivalent of a ghetto, in Berlin it would have been impossible for the Nazis to sort of\ninstitute a real ghetto in an area where only Jews lived because Jews never were\nconcentrated in one area to such an extent, so they would have had basically to clear\nsome area of non-Jewish Germans and anyway that would have been too disruptive. So,\ninstead, they crammed then the remaining Jews at that time simply into a much smaller\nnumber of apartment buildings. That immediately led to innumerable conflicts. First of\nall, I think I indicated before, that food was rationed and so it was very important for each\nfamily to keep its food supply identified and separate and there were frequent suspicions\nand some even, sometimes even accusations that somebody else ate somebody else's\nsausage or at least part of it or that something was missing that should have not been\nmissing. And, in fact, the kitchen became known throughout the community as the\nbattlefield of the apartment. Because it wasn't just the problem of keeping the food\nsupplies separate, then there was a problem even of preparing dinner for example.\nUsually people eat more or less at the same time and they don't eat dinner at four when\nnobody needed the kitchen. And so there was a source of friction in that respect. And of\ncourse, with clean up and this was particularly, these things all might seem to be petty,\nbut at that time, the nerves of all or most Jews at least, were so frayed already by years of\noppression and innumerable Nazi anti-Jewish measures, that it never took much for\npeople to fly into a rage and to, that was really actually a very tragic outcome of that, but\nthat's what happened in many families, it happened in ours. The fact that we lived with\nrelatives had absolutely nothing to do with it and I think my mother and her aunt became\nfierce enemies while we lived there. I would like just to back up briefly to a somewhat\nearlier time when we were still in the apartment, in the big apartment on the Kaiserdamm\nBoulevard. When I mentioned that after the outbreak of the war, the telephones were\ntaken away from Jews, a few days after that measure was instituted, our doorbell rang\nand when we opened the door, the man who lived in the apartment upstairs above us was\nat the door, he was a wealthy bachelor, middle aged, I have no idea, but the way I\nremember him, he was probably then around 50, and he asked to talk to my father in\nprivate under four eyes. So my father and he went into my father's study, and they spent\nsome time there, and we were all puzzled because there had never been really any social\nor any other contact with him. And then after, I don't know, some minutes he\nre-emerged, and they were both, both gentlemen were chatting sort of pleasantly, and our\nupstairs neighbor said goodbye and left. And my father then turned to us with total\nsurprise on his face, saying that Mr. Kopf, that was his name, just offered that we could\nuse his telephone, he just heard that our phone was taken away and he felt that was\nterrible, and if we had the need to call somebody, we should feel free and not only that,\nbut he even gave us permission to pass his number on to a few, but absolutely reliable,\npeople who may have a need to call us, in that case he would send his maid down and\nsomeone could come up and answer the call. And that was, in those days and under those\ncircumstances, was extraordinary because the man surely risked, particularly in the\nsecond part of the offer. So there were sometimes such cases also. Another thing that I\nwanted to mention is that in the same building, on the first floor, the Ambassador of a\nsmall Central American country was living. I'm not 100% certain any more, but I'm\nfairly sure that it was Costa Rica, I can't swear it, anyway, my parents when the situation\nbecame worse and worse, particularly after Kristallnacht, my parents decided maybe an\napproach to that man might be helpful in opening some doors, and although we barely\nknew him except you know when we crossed paths on the stairs or so on, my father made\nan appointment and went to see him and all I know is that nothing ever came of it. Okay,\nback now to February, 1941, after our eviction from the big apartment and our move into\nthat much smaller apartment. That, yeah, that was in February of 1941. Two months\nlater, in April, precisely on April 30, 1941, the apprentice workshop of ORT, where I was\napprenticing for sort of mechanic and machine shop work, was ordered closed by the\nGestapo, and all students in there were supposed to report to the labor office. The Nazis,\nincidentally, had instituted a special labor office for Jews shortly after the outbreak of the\nwar, whose task it was to deal with Jews exclusively and to give them, give Jews jobs\nmainly in the defense industry or also in other sort of generally considered unpleasant\nwork, like for example, the city garbage department, garbage pickup and similar things,\nand also they ride the railroads, certain unpleasant jobs in connection with the railroads\non tracks and so on. Many Jews had already been drafted to work, my parents succeeded\nin getting exemptions by doctors, by getting certificates from doctors, I mean neither one\nof them really was very healthy by that time any more. And, now for our advantage was,\nI mean our, meaning the students, the apprentices at the ORT school, that we were\nconsidered to be sort of already trained mechanics and, therefore, could get some better\njobs and all of us wound up at one of the Siemens factories. Now before the war, the\ncentral Siemens factory was in Berlin, although they did have factories 1n other parts of\nGermany, but in Berlin was the central factory, and also the central administration\nbuilding of Siemens was in Berlin, and it was a huge complex, it took, it was many\nsquare miles large, fenced in of course, many, many buildings manufacturing all kinds of\nthings. In general, Siemens is an electrical equipment manufacturer along the same lines\nas General Electric maybe, at least used to be, before they started building such things as\njet engines. Of course, they were entirely into war production at that time and one day\nafter our, after the ORT school was dismissed, we already, we had to report to this labor\noffice and there we were given, you know, pieces of paper telling us where to report the\nnext day and at what time and so on and so that's how I wound up at Siemens.",
        "A: None whatsoever. In fact, the labor office also was run strictly along Nazi lines, I\nmean we were treated very badly there, I mean with words, nobody was beaten there, but\njust sort of insulted and we were just told where to work. Some others who were there,\nby the way, were told to work also, were sent to other factories, but I happened to wind\nup at Siemens.",
        "A: At that time, the deportations hadn't started yet, so actually I felt, for two reasons, I\nmean to put it mildly, disappointed. I mean one was that I had just been about, I don't\nknow, seven or eight months at the ORT school and was just sort of getting into it\nlearning all kinds of aspects of the trade, of being a mechanic, and that would be\ninterrupted now. And the second thing, of course, that I knew I would be working for the\nGerman war production which didn't really make me obviously happy. At Siemens, the\nJews who worked there, and I think that 1s true of all other defense plants also, did not\nwork sort of scattered around throughout the factory here, maybe one machine operated\nby a Jew and next to him by a German worker. Instead, the Jews were all in one\nparticular department where all workers were Jews except for the foreman, of course.\nAnd in this way we also could be easier controlled. Number two, we were not permitted\nto walk through the factory area unescorted. Now, that meant the shift started at 6:00\na.m. and it was already quite a walk from the factory gate to the building where we were\nworking. So we had to be at the gate at 5:45 to be picked up by a guard which then led us\nto our department where we then punched in, we had to punch in before 6:00. If\nsomebody missed that guarded walk from the gate to the department, then a separate\nguard had to be sent and the foreman made a point of waiting after 6:00 and the person\nhad no way to get to the department and then he would send somebody down, the person\nthen would come and, of course, punch in after 6:00 and there was a rule that every late\nappearance has to be reported to the Gestapo and so that was a very powerful incentive to\nbe on time. Even at that time, at which deportations hadn't started yet, because nobody\nwanted to get entangled with the Gestapo. Furthermore, since we were not permitted to\nwalk through the factory alone, that also meant that there was no way how we could walk\nto the toilets or restrooms whenever the individual need arose for a person. Instead, twice\na day, we were also under guard, conducted to the toilets. One was at 9:00 and the\nsecond time after the lunch hour, around 1:00 or between 1:00 and 2:00. That meant if\nsomebody, for example, needed to go in between, that person had to report to the foreman\nand depending on the foreman's mood at that particular instant, he could either tell the\nperson, well, you just have to wait, sorry, until the group goes, or he could give him a\ndressing down and say, well, okay, I will detail somebody to take you down there. At\nthis point, by the way, all the workers, or the Jewish workers were men. Later on I will\nmention that we also had many Jewish women and, of course, that was particularly\nhumiliating in that case if a woman had to go to that male foreman and tell him that she\nhas to go to the restroom and then for him possibly to sneer and to detail somebody to\ntake her down to the ladies room.",
        "A: We built a part of electric motors called commutators. We didn't know what they\nwere used for, there was a rumor these were motors which were built into submarines,\nyou know, for their electrical supply, but that whether that was true or not, we didn't\nknow. Anyway, these commutators present an essential part of an electric motor.",
        "A: To my knowledge not, I gave it a brief thought and rejected it outright because while\nbeing there, of course, I also acquainted myself with the system, they had a very thorough\nand sophisticated quality control system whereby any part that was produced before it left\nthe factory, went to a controller, somebody who checked it out electrically and so on, that\nwould have been, anything that I would have done to, you know, sort of make it\nmisfunction, would have been discovered by that person. So, first of all, 1t wouldn't have\nachieved anything because it would have never gone to a place where it could have done\ndamage and secondly, as far as I remember they could trace who made it. So I would\nhave wound up in some horrible way without even achieving any purpose in doing so.\nYeah, I mean, the atmosphere, there were still a few German workers in that Jewish\ndepartment, actually, some even women, they had started to use women in factories,\nwhich used to be also unheard of in Germany, but simply because of the labor shortage\nafter the war broke out, since you know most of the able bodied males, of course, served\nin the Wehrmacht, in the army. And also, German workers, some actually were quite\nnice, I have to say, and some others were very hostile, so it varied from person to person.\nIn the, as I said before, that happened on the 30th of April, 1941, and in the summer of\n1941, there was rumor running around, we are going to get Jewish women. So,\nobviously, there was big excitement, notwithstanding the fact that for these women it\nprobably was not so much of a pleasure, but at least we looked forward to some positive\ndiversions. And the rumor turned out to be true and so later on that day, I think in the\nafternoon, a whole group of girls and women led again by a guard, of course, came in.\nOne of them particularly caught my eye immediately, she was in appearance exactly what\nI had always looked for sort of in a woman as far as appearance is concerned, sort of dark\nbrown, close to black hair, and brown eyes, curls and looking in general, a very pleasant\nfacial expression and sort of a very Semitic expression in her face, which I always\nenjoyed in a woman and still do, in fact. And it turned out, so I sort of concentrated my\nattentions the first few days on her, I found out that her first name was Margot and I also\nfound out that she had a steady boyfriend, which didn't surprise me. So this immediately\ncooled my interest, as least for the time being. We worked then together, I mean, we\nwere usually interspersed, there may have been a woman here and a male here and so on,\nseveral males and so on, and among ourselves a real camaraderie developed, the chief\nforeman was a man, his name was, I'll never forget, Alexander Siegel, and this, he was\nabout in his, retrospectively guessing, in his late 30's, I would say, possibly 40, and sort\nof a real rough neck, extremely nice to all females, who also after the war really didn't\nfind much reason to complain about him. And very gruff to males, and myself, I again\nstarted to rub him the wrong way and me the wrong way, so I was sort of on his list to\nbark at whenever he found a pretext for doing that. Yeah, I also met, that is very\nimportant, a male, in fact that was already on the first day that I started to work there, a\nmale, I mean a man a few years older than I, his name was Hans Fabisch and we became\nreally extremely close friends, it was my first close friend since I lost the one whom I had\nin high school, who emigrated to England. And we really went through thick and thin,\nwe were, we became close personal confidants, we shared our recreational hours and did\na lot together and talked a lot and he was probably one of two or three best friends that I\never had. He was, as I said, a few years older than I and he had decided to study\nmedicine and was already, he had all kinds of medical books at home and had started to\nsort of self-educate himself in anatomy and other similar medical subjects. Oh yeah, that\nreminds me of something else. Since we graduated from high school, there was really no\neducational outlet for us. Universities, of course, we were prohibited from enrolling in or\neven attending classes, and there was really nothing else except, you know, my\napprenticeship to become a mechanic. So, with a group of other friends and also\nparticularly former classmates from my high school graduating class, we developed sort\nof a set of informal talks which were held in different apartments of us sort of moving\naround. At that time I didn't use that word, but later on it occurred to me it was almost\nlike an underground university. First of all, our German teacher, who was actually a very\nhighly educated man and also in philosophy, he taught us sort of a course in philosophy\nand it was partly that he talked and partly it was done already in seminar style, where he\nwould assign certain topics to one of us and that person had to report back at the next\ntime and give a little talk on that. And this Hans Fabisch, whom I just mentioned, he had\nconnections to various medical doctors and we got talks from, I don't know, various\nmedical subjects, you know, of general interest and so on and then somebody else, I\nforgot who that was, knew an architect, a Jewish architect, these were all of course Jews\nwho talked and they were also happy because they were thrown out of their professions\nand had nothing to do, particularly this former German teacher whose name, incidentally,\nwas Kurt Levinstein, he, the others sort of rotated, but he consistently, week after week,\nhe never took a penny and he taught with extreme enthusiasm, which sort of was\ninfectious even. And that was a tremendous sort of intellectual outlet for us which\notherwise we had really no outlet for. Another person that I would like to mention is a\ngirl who was a few years older than I, I think about four years, her name was Ruth Perl,\nand she was part of that circle that also went to classes and she sort of became somewhat\nclose to my friend, Hans Fabisch and myself. And as time went on, I think closer to\nmyself, and we sort of started to strike up a friendship and we occasionally went to\nmovies together and it sort of developed that we became quite close and she was my first\ngirlfriend and we shared a lot of both personal thoughts, general thoughts and everything,\nalso entertainment and so on. Oh, yeah, an important factor by the way, also, was music.\nAll of us in that circle and in various other circles were lovers of classical music and that\nwent also for Ruth, and it was in wartime, practically impossible to buy records. So\npeople in private apartments, I mean also many non-Jews, sort of started business\nswapping, used records that is, and so I enriched my collection by, and by the way not\njust swapping, but also selling, so I bought quite a number of records in those days that I\ndidn't have before. It should be remembered, of course, that the quality and the kind of\nphonograph was a totally different world from what we have today. I mean, there was\nobviously no high-fi, there was obviously, there was only one speaker out of an inferior\nphonograph, and the phonograph was sometimes even hand driven by winding it up, and\nif it was electric, then it was kept illegally by the way, because it should have been turned\nin. But we managed to have sort of house concerts, also periodically, where we actually\nmade up a program like for a philharmonic concert, say some Beethoven symphony and\nmaybe a piano concerto by somebody else and different people would then bring those\nrecords and then we would all assemble in somebody's living room and listen to it just the\nway one would have gone to a philharmonic concert, which of course, was also forbidden\nfor Jews to go to. A drastic change in the situation of the Jews occurred with the\nintroduction of the yellow Star of David as of September 19, 1941. The law was very\nspecific that every Jew as defined by the Nuremberg laws has to wear such a yellow star\non his outer clothing whenever the person is in public, and it specified even exactly\nwhere it had to be worn, on the left hand side at about the level of the heart and also it\ncouldn't be tagged on by pins or safety pins, but had to be firmly sewn on, and this way\nthey wanted to avoid that people might put on a star and then later on take it off again and\nthe Gestapo was known to walk up to Jews with a star and sort of try it with their hand,\nwith their fingers to get under it to see whether there is a space between the star and the\ngarment to make sure that it was firmly sewn on.",
        "A: No, not to me, but they have done it to people. That made it finally impossible to, or\nalmost impossible I should say, for Jews to go to all the entertainments and cultural\nofferings that were forbidden after Kristallnacht three years earlier. My friend Hans\nFabisch and I devised, actually it was his original idea, a method even to get around that.\nAnd it was based on the following, that in those days double breasted suits and coats\nwere fashionable and if you had, if you buttoned it the way, I mean men buttoned their\nsuit jackets then the left side where the star was on was, of course, on the outside and\nvisible, but if you changed the buttoning, and most were also sewn in such a way that\nthere were button holes and buttons, you could button it either way, and the way say\nwomen usually button them with the right part over the left, then the star would be\nautomatically covered up. That, it was important to have it that way because upon\nleaving one's apartment and also walking in one's own neighborhood, it would have been\nmuch too dangerous to walk around without a star because people know you and you\nwould have been immediately reported to the Gestapo, so what we did is we left our\nneighborhood as good Jews with our yellow stars, walked many blocks, maybe 10, to an\narea where nobody knew us, then ducked into an entrance of some apartment building\nand quickly changed the buttoning of our jacket or coat and reappeared as Aryan\nGermans and then we could go to a movie or anything without detection.",
        "A: No, in fact, it sort of actually got me excited, like getting my adrenalin flowing that I\nwas doing something like that. My father, I should say, was horrified and forbade me\nstrictly to do that because not only did I endanger myself, very often the Gestapo would\nthen also arrest the rest of the family, but I just didn't want to listen to any advice of\ncaution and also I couldn't stand being so cooped up. I should make a reference,\nincidentally, in connection with culture and movies. There existed a Jewish Kulturbund,\nor culture society, that actually existed already since long before the Kristallnacht,\nnamely since the time when Jewish artists were summarily thrown out from all German\ntheaters and movie production companies, etcetera. And it was founded originally, of\ncourse, to give Jewish musicians, actors, etcetera, a way of earning a living in their craft.\nAnd it was always fairly well visited, I remember in the summer of 1939, I saw an\nexcellent performance of a Kalman operetta (Kalman was a Hungarian operetta\ncomposer) Grafin Mariza, Countess Mariza, which was staged by the Kulturbund very\nprofessionally and I enjoyed it very much. I have seen other things, too, but of course,\nand then after Jews were prohibited from going to other general cultural events and\nentertainment etcetera, then, of course, the Kulturbund became, in addition to providing\nan outlet for fired Jewish artists, became also the only legal way at least, for the Jewish\npopulation at large even to see a movie or a play or symphony. They had a very nice\nsymphony orchestra, by the way, all consisting of Jews. But anyway, I considered it\nsimply a challenge to do something that I was prohibited from doing by the government.\nAnd so, we did that and my girlfriend, Ruth, went one day to a beauty parlor. Even\nbeauty parlors were forbidden for Jews, so of course, she didn't wear a Jewish star and\nalong the way she was stopped by a policeman, it was a regular policeman in uniform,\nand asked for her ID and when he saw that she was Jewish, he, the way she told it to me,\nwas evidently embarrassed and told her in an apologizing way that unfortunately, he is\nforced by law to report that to the Gestapo, any transgression by a Jew had to be reported\nto the Gestapo and he had no way to avoid that. And so we were terribly scared, and then\nfor weeks we didn't hear anything and so our scare sort of slowly subsided, although I\ntold her that if they really get after her, that she should simply go underground and then\nshe told me she will definitely not do that because she has no way to sustain herself and\ndoesn't know anyone where to go to, so anyway. On one day, in fact, on the 9th of\nSeptember, 1941, the 9th of September or the 9th of October, doesn't make a difference\nanyway, she, we always met in the morning on the way to the factory, my train actually, I\nhad to change trains at a certain station and she, and join another train where she already\nwas sitting in and she always sat in the same car so from there on, we always rode\ntogether. And on that morning, when I came into the railroad car where she was sitting\nin, I took one look and knew what had happened. Her eyes were totally red from both\nprobably having cried and having been sleepless, and she pulled, without saying a word,\na letter from the, from her pocketbook and which had the dreaded head Geheime\nStaatspolizei, the complete word for Gestapo, which is just an abbreviation. And it asked\nher to appear on that morning at 9:00 in the offices, room such and such, with, that's all,\njust to appear for an interrogation. But everybody knew what that meant. And she, now I\nhaven't really talked about the deportations, but the deportations had started a month\nearlier and Jews working in defense plants were understood to be exempted from\ndeportations, so she had come to work mainly to show our foreman, Alexander Siegel,\nthe summons to see what he could do for her. But he coldly told her that there was\nnothing that he could do for her because the Gestapo does have the complete lists of all\nJews employed by Siemens, and they know also of the agreement that Jews working in\ndefense plants are to be deferred, however, they can do what they want and there 1s\nnothing more that he can do. And then we talked a little bit, the atmosphere was so\nunbelievably stifling that I almost felt like somebody choked my throat, and then she said\ngoodbye to our mutual friend Hans Fabisch and to me and just walked out. It was the last\ntime I saw her. And, yeah, back up briefly, in September, just about a month before the\n7th, the first deportation train left for the East and it was characteristic, it was\ncharacteristic of all transports to the East, nobody knew where these people went to, it\nwas just said that it goes to the East.",
        "A: I don't think it was any particular category with the exception that those working in\ndefense plants were exempted, but otherwise, they just, I don't even know, I think the\nJewish community was enlisted in putting together lists for deportation. . .\nEnd of side tape two.\nTape 3",
        "A: The deportations, the mechanisms of the deportation was handled, of course, by the\nGestapo at the command level, but it was carried out under order of the Gestapo by the\nJewish community organizations. And they put together the lists of Jews to be deported.\nSometimes the Gestapo would make particular demands, for example, at one time the\nGestapo was afraid that Jews who lived along the elevated train tracks might give\nflashlight signals to Allied bombers and thus directing them to bomb the tracks, which on\nits face was ludicrous because they would have then also directed the bombs to\nthemselves living right next to the tracks. But anyway, be that as it may, the Gestapo\nordered the Jewish community to provide such a list and get these people on the\ndeportation trains. But in general, that was one exception, the community picked the\npeople, that was initially a process where people were notified sometime ahead of time\nby a letter which only said that their apartment has been designated to be cleared. It was\nsort of as if that was all there was to it, that the apartment was to be cleared. But\neverybody knew what it meant, of course. And with a set of detailed questionnaires\nwhere all the assets had to be filled in and so on and then another questionnaire where all\nthe contents of the luggage, there were detailed instructions how much luggage in terms\nof size and weight could be taken along, which items should be taken along and which\ncould not be taken along. Among those not to be taken along, for example, were\nnegotiable, anything negotiable value, securities, money, cash, jewelry and it had to be\nfilled out exactly what the contents of the luggage was that was to be taken along. Now\nthe result of that was that there was a wave of suicides. Many people who were too\nscared to go through the deportations since nobody knew what really happened to these\npeople and so after awhile the Gestapo discontinued that and then went over to assist\nthem, where people were just being picked up without any prior notification. And\nanyway, they had to be kept in a transit camp before being shipped out because the cattle\ncars and freight cars that were used for deporting Jews, such a train was holding upward\nof six, seven hundred people, even up to a thousand and eleven hundred. And it took\nmore than a day or two to pick up that many people, so they were housed in a transit\ncamp. At first the transit camp, in fact, was one of the synagogues until the military,\nyeah, that synagogue, by the way, had been only lightly damaged during Kristallnacht\nand had been repaired afterwards. So that was first used for a transit camp and then the\nmilitary sort of made a demand to have that synagogue for, I think, storage of some sort\nor other. And then it was shifted to an old age home of the Jewish community and Jews\nwere collected there until they had enough people in there to fill a transport, then they\nwere taken away.",
        "A: Yeah, at that point, yes. And in fact, this group of people that I mentioned who were\nalso having various lectures and so on, we, at that point, we decided that we have to\nsomehow do something, at least, first of all, to find out what is happening because people\nwere being picked up and then never heard from again. Now, that in itself has a\ntremendously terrorizing effect, somebody, your neighbor or maybe even your brother or\nsomebody close to you whom you still saw yesterday, today he was gone, or she. And\nnot only was that person gone, but I mean except for the fact that you knew they were\ntransported East, otherwise you had no inkling. There was never a letter or postcard\ncoming back, there was never any sign of life even, so that in itself had a terrorizing\neffect, so but we were all very, very naive about the whole process. We sat down and\nhad a big sort of session where we threw out all kinds of ideas then we came away with a\ngreat idea that whoever of the group is the first one to be deported, then has to see\nsomehow after getting to the East, to contact maybe German soldiers or somebody who\ncan get a message back to one of us describing what was happening. In the light of how\nthe deportations were handled, that was just unbelievably naive and, of course, the first\none of our group, there was a girl, I still remember her, and of course, she vanished\nexactly like everybody else and nothing was ever heard from her. She obviously had no\nchance to contact anyone. I mean, Jews who were deported were immediately, of course,\nthat was not really known at that time, but they were immediately put into either ghettos\nor extermination camps. And in extermination camps, many were immediately on the\nspot gassed and that who were not gassed were kept in that camp for hard labor and had\nno way to communicate with anybody outside of that camp. It was just totally\nimpossible.",
        "A: Yeah. Of course, again, the thing was that my father considered himself lucky\noriginally because he was exempted from the forced labor because of a doctor certificate,\nbut now that labor was the only thing that exempted you from deportation, that turned out\nto be not so lucky. He went through several stages of such real ironies. Now, of course,\nhe would not have been in a position really to do factory work, however, he, now he\nknew one of the personalities at the central, at the congregation offices and, in fact, it was\na woman who was in charge of the sort of deportation decisions and so on. And she gave\nhim an unpaid job there for the community, what he did he never really talked about and\nhe was, I mean like in all other things, very close mouthed, but I know he had some work\nat the Jewish community that may have exempted him for some time. Now, in April of\n'42, oh, I have to back up, actually. Now I remember I made a mistake when I talked\nabout the arrest of my girlfriend, Ruth. I know that I said it was in either September or\nOctober of '41. It was actually '42. In '41 the deportations had barely started and it was\nin October of '42, or September, I don't know, that her arrest took place. Okay, coming\nback, my parents were actually arrested in April of '42 and by the Gestapo.",
        "A: Yeah, well I'm coming to that.",
        "A: And they were taken to the collection point, to that synagogue that I referred to, but\nthe Gestapo officers who arrested them said, oh yeah, what happened was that my father\nhad agreed with his personal physician that he would either commit suicide or take some\nstrong sedative which would totally knock him out and the physician prescribed to him\nsomething called Veronal. I don't think it exists here now, at least not under this name, so\nI don't know what it would be here. But, he immediately took that and was sort of like in\na coma, so he was, obviously they couldn't take him along, so they put in a phone call and\nhad the Jewish hospital pick him up and then my mother and sister were taken and they\ntold me to come along because they said it's likely if the father is not capable of being\ntransported, that my mother and sister would be sent home again. So that is also one of\nthe weird examples where occasionally they had something that might almost sound like\nhumane in all this murderous brutality. At any rate, I spent several hours in that transit\ncamp and it was a horrible sight. The Jews there, it was a synagogue, and the people who\nwere to be sort of awaited their deportation, they were all at the balcony. I mean,\nEuropean synagogues at that time, and I think still today in fact, separate the sexes, men\npray downstairs and women in the balcony, so they had all of the people for deportation\nin the balcony and you could see sort of people up wandering around absentmindedly and\nso on, and in a daze. And then on the ground floor, which was the area where men used\nto pray, that's where the Gestapo, they had their offices and they would periodically call\nsomebody down to fill out forms and for interrogation and so on. So anyway, after\nseveral hours my mother and sister were told they could go home again and so that's what\nwe did. And they handed me our luggage back, their luggage, and then we went back.",
        "A: No, I didn't. It didn't occur to me. But maybe that was just my habitual optimism, I\ndon't know. Now as time went on, the situation became more and more unbearable. I\nremember one co-worker in the factory, from the Jews he was probably about five years\nolder than I. He appeared one morning with a totally lost expression. The night before\nwhen he came home from work, he found the apartment empty. He had a wife and a little\nbaby girl, I think, and they were gone. I mean, he couldn't even say goodbye to them.\nThey were gone, and he was supposed to continue working. And there were many\nsimilar horror stories, and they were constantly, of course, circulating and, in fact, since\nall Jews were also no longer permitted to buy newspapers, by the way, and as we\ndiscussed before, also had to turn in their radios, so there was a new way to sort of spread\nthe news, and that was called sort of radio by mouth or mouth radio. And I mean the\npsychological situation became just unbearable, it was sort of a combination of a fear of\nthe worst to come and being trapped into something where one has no control and mixed\nwith a desire to do something about it. I mean, many of my friends, also my friend Hans\nand I and so on, we talked about going underground, but to go underground that means\ngoing into hiding with forged papers, seemed like such an enormous undertaking, I mean\nfirst of all to get forged ID's and it would cost a lot of money and then food would have\nto be procured on the black market and, of course, none of us had any money to speak of,\nso it was mainly a lot of talk. Now some people, mainly those who were politically\nengaged, they were able to go underground and be protected by politically like-minded\npeople. That was true, especially of communists. Oh yeah, and talking about\ncommunists, there was a Jewish communist cell actually centered in one of the other\nJewish departments at Siemens and headed by a man named Herbert Baum and his wife,\nMarianne Baum, B-A-U-M. And they had been, apparently, an underground cell for\nyears only of Jews and basically just meeting and sort of like holding seminars about\nMarxism and the dangers of capitalism and fascism and so on and then at some point they\ndecided that wasn't really enough and something had to be done to fight back against the\nNazis. And in the, it was also sort of the summer, I think, of 1942, in the center of Berlin\nthe Nazis staged a vast exhibit under the name the Soviet Paradise and, of course, they\nmeant it sarcastically and the exhibit was devoted to materials which they had, you know,\nuncovered in their process of conquering large parts of the western Soviet Union and\nmuch of it may have been true, much of it was lies, whatever, and the exhibit was\napparently quite successful, there was throngs visiting it, so they decided to burn it down.\nBut, of course, they were not experts at anything, I mean they were not experts in\nsabotage and in technical things and so on, so it was a big tragedy, they succeeded in\nputting in a small fire somehow, the damage was so minimal that the Germans even could\nkeep it out of the newspapers. If it had been a major fire, they would have had no choice\nbut to at least report it, but 1t wasn't even reported in the press. And not only that, but\nimmediately they didn't catch anybody, they sort of, they scattered certain delayed\nincendiaries which you put somewhere and then it takes five minutes or so for the flame\nto break out, so they were gone by the time, so nobody was caught. But the Gestapo had\nfound a network of undercover agents in the underground communist movement, anyway\nthe details I don't know. The fact is, that they got on their trail, they were arrested all of\nthem and the first thing that the Gestapo did is tell the Jewish community that they want\n500 Jewish men immediately, 250 of them will be shot on the spot and another 250 will\nbe immediately deported to concentration camps. And if any sabotage by where Jews are\ninvolved happens again, they will take 10 times as many people. And that was a horror\nthat immediately spread through this mouth radio, of course, and I knew some of the\npeople involved, incidentally, because it was centered at Siemens, and the Baums were at\nSiemens. And so that contributed to the demoralizing effect. As a sideline, I want to say\nthat they became great heroes in the now defunct German Democratic Republic, formerly\nEast Germany, and there was a street named after them and books were written and so on.\nBut, of course, they are all dead. Actually, one of the members of the group was a girl\nwho graduated with me from that high school, she was in my class, and in fact, I\nremember that after graduation, I once had a long discussion. She was then already a\ncommunist, and she tried to convert me. All I remember is that we had a very lively hard\nhitting discussion and I didn't convince her and she didn't convince me. But it never\noccurred to me that she would belong to the, if she would have convinced me, who\nknows, maybe I would have been in that group also. Anyway, yeah, they were all tried\nby the so-called People's Court, that's the same court that also convicted those, you know,\nplotters who tried to assassinate Hitler two years later in July, '44. And of course, most\nof them were executed, a few got some jail sentences. Alright, this is basically the\natmosphere, now also I should say about Siemens, coming back to that, I said already that\nwe got no worker food ration stamps and even less than the general consumer, we got\npaid less than the German workers who did similar work and I said we couldn't go to the\ntoilets, also we couldn't use their cafeteria, we had to bring our own lunch and sort of eat\nit at our work desk and of course, we had no right to vacation time. And, but through my\nfriend Hans Fabisch, whom I mentioned earlier and who was training to become a\nphysician, he sort of advised me on certain back symptoms which cannot be traced by a\ndoctor which are purely subjective, but make you incapable of working, it has to sort of\nhurt at a certain point and when the doctor pushes this way it hurts more and that way it\nhurts less, and so I feigned that and so I received an official sort of a statement, yeah, as a\nJew I couldn't just call in, I'm sick today, you had to have a physician certified written\nstatement, you know, that Ernest Fontheim, you know, has blah, blah, such and such a\nsickness or disease and is not capable to come to work. So anyway, I got that following\nhis instructions, that was in the latter part of December. So on December 24th, then I was\nat home. I want to come back, I said earlier in this interview, that Christmas played a\nspecial role in our family and I meant that in many ways, it played a role as I grew up\nbecause we always had a Christmas tree and we, and Santa Claus came and we had gifts.\nWell, on the 24th of December, 1942, my parents were arrested and my sister. And it\nhappened this way. I was actually that was when I was on that fake sick leave and I had\nleft the apartment to make a phone call from a public phone, as I said we didn't have a\nphone. Public phones were also prohibited to Jews but by walking a few blocks and\nhiding my star I could then go into a booth and I was making a call to the parents of\nMargot, whom I had met sometime earlier. And they had a phone because they were\nsubletting an apartment that was in the name of a Hungarian Jewish woman and since she\nwas not a German citizen, all these German laws, these antisemitic laws, did not apply to\nher, even though she was a Jew, but so anyway, so they had that phone and I called them\nup, I don't even know why anymore, it doesn't make a difference, but when I went back,\nwe lived now in that apartment with these relatives of ours that I described earlier, which\nwas a second floor apartment and as I approached the apartment, I noticed my sister, Eva,\nleaning out the window and waving me away. And I knew immediately, in those days\nyou knew always what was happening on a signal. And so I walked away, I knew the\npeople were there to pick my family up. So I walked just maybe 50 yards or so back so\nthat I was still in view and watched what was going on. And then after a while the janitor\ncame, the janitor actually happened to be also a Jew, but lived in a mixed marriage and\nwas protected therefore by, through the Nazi laws. And he came and said I should come\nup, the people who came for the pickup were actually Jewish orderlies and they go\nstrictly by lists and my name, there were just the names of both parents and my sister. So\nI went up and there was total frenzy at home, of course, and my father was again out, he\nhad done the same thing, and one of the orderlies had already gone down to call the\nGestapo to say that he was not, could not be transported. And he came back after, I don't\nknow, 10, 15 minutes saying he was told that my father has to be brought under whatever\ncircumstances, even if they have to carry him down the stairs in a chair. And then my\nparents were frantically packing, I mean most people had already most of the things\npacked and so did they, but there are some last minute things. My father was not\ncompletely out in a coma, but in a very weakened state and he took my hands and said we\nwill never see each other again. And then my sister suddenly out of the blue, threw her\narms around my neck and had an incredible crying spell. Her whole body shook and I\nkept her close and I frequently thought to myself why I simply did not take her and walk\nout with her. That is a question which I have asked myself ever since. Then when the\npreparations were done, my father was actually really carried down the steps in a chair;\nand the picking up of Jews was done by a moving van from a company that I'll never\nforget, the name was Scheffler. Of course, the Gestapo presumably leased those vans,\nand inside the vans they had long benches where the Jews that were picked up were sort\nof lined up and then sitting until it was full and then the van would go to the transit camp.\nBy that time the transit camp had shifted from the synagogue where it used to be still in\nApril, to a former old age home of the Jewish community.",
        "A: Yeah, and actually, I decided to ride along in that van for some blocks to be together\nwith them some more. And then at the corner of Guntzelstrasse and Trautenaustrasse I\nsaid goodbye and jumped out the back and that was the last time I saw my parents and\nmy sister on December 24, 1942, Christmas Eve. On the next day our doorbell rang and\nwhen I opened, I was surprised to see my former mathematics teacher, Dr. Baer, from the\nJewish school. He told me that he was serving as an orderly in the transit camp and had a\nmessage from my mother, and he added that it was strictly forbidden for orderlies to\nmake any communication between people in the transit camp and people outside, but\nsince I had been his student for quite a number of years and he knew me already as a\nsmaller boy, he did it out of a gesture of friendship. He told me first of all that my\nmother had forgotten certain things that he offered to bring in and they would also be\nglad if I could pack some additional food and then he added that my mother also told him\nthat she was interrogated the day they arrived there by the Gestapo, and the Gestapo\nshowed particular interest in me. They wanted to know what hours I work, when I come\nhome from work, etcetera. And I knew immediately that that was a message and\nobviously the message was never to go back. So that's what I did. At that point I had no\nplace to stay. But as I just mentioned earlier, the parents of my co-worker, Margot, in\nwhom I had been interested at first, lived, sublet an apartment that was actually registered\nin the name of a Hungarian Jewish woman and, therefore, was not on the Gestapo list.\nAnd they had a small sort of a maid's room, aside of the apartment but it belonged to it,\nwhich they used for storage, but they said that I could stay there and sleep there also. So\nthat's what I did. On New Year's Eve, December 31, first of all I knew at that time that\nno transport had left Berlin, so I knew that my parents were still there and I was there\nwith Margot and her parents and also with a friend of theirs, I forgot his name, he was\nsort of an elderly man, about 60, in his 60's, and his entire family had been arrested, but\nhe had some contact to the Gestapo and was negotiating with them to bribe them to get\nhis family out. And he was supposed to meet his Gestapo contact the next day, but he\nalso knew the Gestapo had power to do anything; they could just take whatever he had to\noffer, arrest him too and laugh in his face. And that New Year's Eve was the most\nhorrible New Year's Eve that I ever had in my life. My parents and sister were in the\ntransit camp, my girlfriend Ruth was already long gone and I didn't know what would\nbecome of me and that man was there with his horror story. The atmosphere was so\nunbelievably gloomy that it is even hard to describe. I kept in touch with my friend Hans\nFarbisch, of course, and he actually had met a physician, a Jewish physician whom he\nwas going to marry. She was a few years older than he and she was Austrian so that's\nwhy, otherwise a person of that age wouldn't have had a medical degree in Germany\nbecause in Germany a Jew couldn't study any more since 1933, but coming from Vienna,\nshe could study until '38. Anyway, she had her medical degree and her name was Valli\nand they got married in the first week of January, wait a minute, yeah. And Hans and I\ndiscussed the possibility maybe of going underground together. But a basic difference of\nopinion developed between Hans and myself. He, his philosophy was that as long as we\nwere employed at Siemens, we were protected and deferred from deportation. On the\nother hand, if we went underground and were caught in some ID check on the street\nwithout a star, that meant immediate deportation. Therefore, he felt at this point 1t was\nmuch safer if we stayed legal, quote, worked at Siemens and were protected that way and\nthen go underground whenever the, you know, the deferment would no longer be valid or\nSiemens might lay us off or whatever. I, on the other hand, argued that the Gestapo was\nnot going to send us printed invitations or announcements saying now you are no longer\nprotected and deferred. That is going to come overnight without that anybody knows it\nand then it's going to be too late. It is true right now it is safer to be walking around with\na star and working at Siemens because that is protection, but because of the uncertainty of\nhow long that is going to last, there is no, that risk we have to take. And there was\nanother point, in fact, which leads me to briefly flash back to our time at Siemens. I had\nforgotten to mention that already since the fall of 1942, we received in our department\nforced laborers from occupied, German occupied territories. It started out with a group of\nFrench women and after a while, we also got Polish women to work in our department.\nThese were all people who were deported, obviously, against all international law and\nwithout their consent, into Germany to work for war production. And I also referred to\nthat in talking to Hans, that it's very obvious, first of all the Germans have millions and\nmillions of people in the occupied territories and a few tens of thousands of Jews, so I,\nwhy do they need a few tens of thousands of Jews if they can be replaced from a pool that\nhas millions of people. And they have already started to introduce these people in our\ndepartment and they know already how to do the things that we are doing, so I think that\nprobably the time is imminent even that these deferments for work in defense plants are\ngoing to lapse. But we did not, obviously, resolve that difference of opinion. Hans\nhimself felt that for the time being he was safer that way. He did, however, do one thing\nand that is to order forged ID's. A forged ID at least for himself to go, it was practically\nimpossible to live in Germany without some sort of an ID because there were frequent\nchecks for identification on the streets, there was a whole spectrum of agencies who\ncould do that in addition to just the ordinary police, there was the Gestapo, of course,\nwhich was essentially a political police, there was the so-called criminal police, these\nwere detectives looking for common criminals, there was the military police, there was a\nso-called labor police and probably other agencies that I wasn't even aware of. So,\nbasically, it was definitely necessary to have forged identification papers because if you\nwere asked for an identification on the, by any one of these agencies, and you were not\nable to identify yourself to their satisfaction, that meant immediate arrest. Margot's father\nhad a contact that could provide a forged identification as an employee for the, an\norganization called Deutsche Arbeitsfront, which means in English, German Labor Front.\nEnd of side one of tape three.",
        "A: This organization, the German Labor Front, was the Nazi answer, basically, to labor\nunions. They had smashed, of course, the labor unions and declared them illegal and also\nthey declared that their ideology, this whole idea of class warfare and of a sort of\nadversarial relationship between management and labor is not in the sense of Germanic\nnationalism. Instead they formed this German Labor Front which contained members\nboth of the employed laborers and employees and of management and owners and the\nsupposed idea was that in this forum, before conflicts arise, all issues will be discussed in\na cooperative way because both sides are obviously interested in the flourishing of the\ncompany. This whole idea might have sounded good on paper, but it was, of course,\ndone mainly in order to smash the voice of the workers and to enable German industry to\nincrease production and mainly war production, without any disruptions. So, Margot's\nfather had some contact and for roughly the sum of fifteen hundred German Reichsmark,\nwhich was the currency at that time, the opportunity, fifteen hundred apiece, of course, to\nobtain ID's as an employee with the German Labor Front. This was, of course, a very\nprestigious organization and so, and the ID also contained a passport picture of the\nperson, the obviously name, birthdate, address and so on and then a rubber stamp\nnumbered one, two, three, four, five, to be stamped, I think, semiannually, so that it also\nhad the impression of being updated on a semiannual basis. The rubber stamp came, was\njust a number, came with the ID itself so we could sort of revalidate it every six months\nfor ourselves. Hans also agreed to buy this ID and sort of put it away in case when the\nsituation is what he considers ripe to go underground. In the meantime, as I had\nmentioned earlier, I was already no longer living in our apartment because of the hidden\nwarning that my mother had conveyed to me and I lived in a small maid's room of the\napartment of Margot's parents, but during the day commuted to our apartment because I\nhad decided to save as much as possible. And, incidentally, I should also add that at that\ntime, my parents and sister were still in the transit camp in that former Jewish old age\nhome. Only after the war, in fact fairly recently with publications of the history and so\non, did I learn of the brutal conditions in that camp. I mean, I never thought that there\nwould be nice conditions, but at least I thought, since it was an old age home, there would\nbe beds in there and they would at least have some form of amenities. I learned now that\na, some so-called specialists in Jewish emigration from the Vienna SS had been gotten to\nBerlin on the orders of Adolf Eichmann and also to speed up the deportation of Jews, and\nthe first thing they, that the man in charge was a man named Alois Brunner incidentally,\nhis rank was SS Hauptsturmfthrer. The fact that he was in Berlin, in fact, was known at\nthat time, but what was not known 1s that his first act after arriving and looking at the\ntransit camp in that former old age home, that he ordered that all furniture be thrown out\nthe windows and that was literally done, they were thrown out of the windows, even\nthough there was a shortage of furniture for Germans. And there were just bare floors so\nhe could pack more Jews into the building. And so even in that transit camp already,\nthey must have lived under very miserable circumstances.",
        "A: That comes to, their transport left on the 12th of January, it was a Tuesday and an\nunbelievably unusually cold day, even for Berlin. And the departure of a transport\nbecame known within hours always in Berlin because that couldn't, you know, there were\nwhat, a thousand people were marched from the transit camp to the nearest, they didn't go\nto a regular railroad station, but to a freight yard where they were loaded on like cattle.\nThe, as I had said earlier, the arrest of my parents took place on December 24th and I\nguess 1n order to allow the SS some Christmas vacation from their strenuous activities, no\ntransport went away from Berlin between December 24th and January 12th, so they were\nthere almost three weeks, two and a half weeks.",
        "A: No, I, as I explained earlier, I was on that faked sick leave and I simply never went\nback. The sick leave, of course, was limited to, I forgot what it was, a certain number of\ndays, maybe a week, but by never going back then I was hoping that my absence\nwouldn't be immediately noticed because obviously, if somebody was just absent, they\nwould immediately send orders for the arrest of that person.",
        "A: No, no, no. I didn't see, I just heard that also through the mouth radio that I had\nmentioned also at some point, that when, actually considering how primitive it was and\nthat we didn't even have telephones, was incredibly efficient how it went from, these\nthings went from mouth to mouth. Yeah, let me see. During that time, as I said, we, I\nlived at the, in that maid's room at the apartment of Margot's parents which was really\nvery far away in distance from our apartment where we lived, so every day I went there\nto pack things, yeah, and my plan was to have as much of personal effects and so on\npicked up by a moving company. That moving company had been a client of my father's\nwhen he was still practicing law, I still remember the name was Gebriider Zimmermann,\nwhich means Brothers Zimmermann. The owner actually was a Mr. Schiitt and who was\nvery, I must say, was a fantastic man and he knew of course that we are Jews and he\nstuck with us, he had already from our nice apartment where we were thrown out, a lot of\nfurniture stored in his storage place under a different name, and so that it couldn't be\ntraced. And I went to him and told him that my parents had been arrested and would be\ndeported and I wanted to save more things and he immediately agreed and the pickup\nthen was supposed to come on January 19th and I was supposed to designate all the\npieces that were supposed to be picked up and there were certain pieces of furniture that I\nthought maybe at one time I might want to sell. And also, a trunk full of all kinds of\npersonal articles, it also contained the diary of my sister, she had kept a diary for a long\ntime and also particularly, the letter that my sister had written to me when she was, as a\nharvest helper away from Berlin and I had written to her of the arrest of my girlfriend,\nRuth. And so I was busy then every day for a few hours in the apartment and always left\nconsiderably earlier than I would have come back had I worked, so that I wouldn't be\nrunning into some trap by the Gestapo. On the 18th of January, it was one day before I\nhad ordered the van, the moving van, to come. I was again doing some last packing to\nfinish up for the pickup on the next day, when one of the women I had mentioned earlier\nthat there were quite a number of people living, had been living in that apartment, one of\nthe women came and reported that the infamous pickup, moving van, was in the\nBrandenburgische Strasse, that is the street where my friend Hans was living. I think I\nhad mentioned that the pickup of Jews for deportation was done by a furniture van, a\nfurniture moving van, of the firm Scheffler and Brandenburgische Strasse, as I said, was\nthe street where my friend Hans was living, although that was in midmorning and I knew\nthat Hans was at work at Siemens, but his wife, Valli, did not work and might be at home.\nSo I immediately grabbed my coat and raced, it was several blocks away from where our\napartment was, and then I turned the corner into Brandenburgische Strasse and saw that\nvan parked right in front of their house. And it struck me like lightening, I stopped for a\nfew seconds, considering how that house also like all houses where Jews lived, of course,\nwas a so-called Jew house which meant that there was a large number of Jewish parties,\nand I figured that the probability that they were just in their apartment is probably small,\nand at any rate, I would never be able to face my friend if I didn't do anything I could to\nget his wife out. So, and they lived, it was a walk-up on the fifth floor, I raced up the\nsteps, rang the bell and they had sublet one room, just in an apartment which was rented\nby a Mrs. Striem, and the door, Mrs. Striem opened the door, her face looked horrible, as\nwhite as even more white than this wall here, like this cuff, I've never seen her like that.\nAnd she looked completely dejected and all she said, \"what are you doing here? Get\naway quickly!\" And then instead of turning and running, I asked, \"1s Valli, I want to talk\nto Valli\". Then she repeated, \"get away!\" And upon that, I saw behind her a man in an\nSS uniform appearing and at that point I turned around and raced down and was on the\nlanding below when I heard a thunderous voice in a Viennese dialect saying, halt\nimmediately. And I turned around, I saw an SS officer leaning over the balustrade and\nwith a drawn pistol pointing at me. And I got such a shock of scare that almost my knees\nbuckled under me and I walked back up and he got me in, closed the door and the first\nthing, your papers. And then I pulled out my forged ID from the German Labor Front\nwhich he looked at carefully and compared my face with the picture on the ID and then\nhe barked at me what I was doing there. You know, because there was supposed to be no\ncontact between so-called Aryans and Jews. And, of course, the question totally caught\nme by surprise and I was so devastated and fearful anyway that I couldn't think straight\nso all I could blurt out was that the Jew who lives here still owes me some money which\nin that respect was stupid and the guy didn't even catch it because if he owed me money,\nthat meant that I must have loaned it to him and if I loaned him money, what business did\nI have loaning money to a Jew, but he didn't pursue it. But instead, he took my ID put it\nin his uniform pocket and said, I want to ask you some more questions tomorrow, I want\nyou to come to my office at Gestapo headquarters, such and such street address, room\nnumber so and so, I forgot that, but I do remember at 9:00 tomorrow morning I want to\nsee you there and then you will get your ID back. And then I left and I felt as if I had sort\nof escaped from hell, that was one of the two or three scariest episodes in my entire life.\nI went down, but I had at least one thing, while we were standing, that little conversation\ntook place inside their door, in a little sort of like a vestibule, and the various rooms went\noff it, and in Hans' room I didn't see a person. So it seemed to me that Valli wasn't there.\nSo as I raced down as quickly as possible because I thought maybe the guy changes his\nmind, I decided, then I walked out of the house to the street and to the next corner was\nseveral houses. So I walked to the next corner and around the corner, but then I\npositioned myself there on the corner so I could see who approached the house and I was\nhoping that if Valli would come, that I could signal or shout at her and get her away. It\nwas also a cold winter day, the 18th of January, and I stood there. In the meantime, that\nvan had already left, but it was known that sometimes if a person that they were looking\nfor wasn't there, they left somebody behind so that's why I stuck there until my legs were\nreally like just columns of ice and I couldn't stand it anymore, and at 4:00 also was shift\nchange, I felt I had to notify Hans. And, of course, that was a tricky thing because I was\nby that time, away without, from work without permission, so I couldn't be seen there.\nSo I went to the elevated station that we went to when we went to work at Siemens and\nthen walked toward the factory, but didn't walk all the way, but sort of hid in the entrance\nof an apartment building which was still a block or two away from the factory, but where\npeople at the shift change would sort of stream past. And of course, by that time it was\nwinter, it was already fairly dark. So I stood there and then when Hans came by, I\nwhistled to him and he stopped and was surprised to see me and I told him the events of\nthe morning and of course, he got very depressed and agitated by that. Anyway, we went\nthen together back, and then when we arrived in front of his house and looked up, there\nwas the. In wartime windows had to be darkened in order not to give away locations to\nenemy airplanes, but often, I mean not often but always, there was sort of a small slit of\nlight coming just from the edge where the curtain just quite didn't hit the wall. And we\nsaw some light coming out of his apartment so we both felt somebody must be home at\nleast. So we rushed up and on the floor below, Hans turned to me and said, you know,\nwhy don't you wait here. I'll go up and if everything 1s clear, I'll call you. So I stood one\nfloor below and watched him and he put the key into the lock but hadn't turned it yet,\nwhen the door opened from the inside. And I saw a tall grey haired civilian opening the\ndoor who didn't belong there, never seen before in my life, and he immediately looked\ndown and shouted to me, who are you? And then I turned around and ran as fast as I\ncould. I never ran as fast in my life, I think, and that was the last time I saw Hans. And\nas sort of a sideline, that was the 18th of January, 1943, exactly to the day five years later\nthat my high school friend from that orthodox high school, on the 18th of January, '39, no\nfour years later I guess, left Berlin to emigrate to England. So I left I guess the two best\nfriends that I had in my life, I lost on the same day, on the 18th of January, the only thing\nis the one who left for England, left for life and he 1s still alive, he's in Jerusalem now.\nSo then I went back again to Margot's parents and there was a terrible argument. Her\nfather accused me that I was reckless, that I should have never, by having that ID\nconfiscated that means now that ID may even be useless now because the Gestapo\nknows, they obviously are going to find out that this is a forged ID and I was endangering\neverybody else and so we had a big argument about that. And then, not only that, but I\nprobably overreacted and overestimated the efficiency of the Gestapo, but at that time I\nthought they could probably lift my fingerprints from that ID, and all Jews had been\nfingerprinted already, years before, so they had a fingerprint file of all Jews and\nexperienced criminologists can match fingerprints, so it occurred to me that, what if they\nmatch my fingerprint, find out who I really, who the owner of that ID really was and then\ncome to the apartment and if the moving van is just there, they will immediately find out\nthat this is being picked up, you know, by that firm of Zimmermann and that will lead\nthem to me somehow. So I called up the firm and cancelled the pickup and that was one\nof the most horrible mistakes of my life. It wasn't the furniture, but it was the personal\nthings that were contained in the trunk. The trunk contained my sister's diary, her letters,\nincluding the letter that she had written to me after the arrest of Ruth and I never went\nback to that building simply because I was afraid that it might be staked out. While the\nGestapo, as far as I know, never looked just for Jews who were in hiding in particular, but\nin a case where there was a forged ID from an important Nazi agency, they would surely\nbe interested in finding out how that ID was obtained, from whom, etcetera, etcetera, so\nthat would have been worthwhile to stake that address out. I just, in retrospect, don't\nbelieve that they were that efficient that they would have had all of that figured out within\nless than a day, but at that time, I felt strongly that it was too unsafe to go back and also\ntoo unsafe to have the moving company come because that would have led them to me.\nThe result of this is that I have no personal belongings of my sister whatsoever. I have\npictures, of course, but that's all. We intensified now the search for a place to hide.\nMargot's parents, and incidentally, and of course I immediately had to practically move\nmountains to get another ID. Margot's parents were also planning to go underground, but\ndidn't, had one or two possible sort of options, none of which was ideal. Then I came up\nwith an idea and that was the former office supervisor of my father's law office. It was a\nMrs. Frieda Kunze. She was actually a marvelous person. She had been in his office as\nfar back as Ican remember. I don't know whether she was there since before I was born\nor since I was a little boy, but as long as remember. As a little boy whenever I was\ntaken to the office, she was already working for my father and in the last years, she was\nhis office supervisor. And she held to us even after my father lost his license to practice\nand, of course, then she lost that job. She visited us frequently and I remember often she\nbrought us food even, that she had taken from her own not very generous rations. And\nshe owned a primitive weekend cottage in a village about roughly 35 miles southeast of\nBerlin. And I didn't, all I knew is that she owned that place, I didn't know, I had never\nbeen there, what it was like or so, but I went to her and, of course, I told her also that my\nparents and sister had been arrested and I told her that whether we could make some\narrangement that I and also a family of friends, that's a couple and a daughter, could live\nin that cottage. And she said that, you know, because my father was such a marvelous\nboss for decades for her and she also considered herself as a friend of the family, that she\nwould do anything to save my life. On the other hand, she wasn't so sure whether that\ncottage really was the right place, she repeated again that it was very primitive and maybe\nwe ought to look at it. So first of all, of course, I introduced her to Margot's parents, I\nthink 1t was even the next day, we all went to her apartment and sort of got acquainted\nand then we agreed on a day when we would together travel out and look at the place.\nShe said she hadn't been there even for a year or two and that it may be in a very\nrundown state. So we went out there and it was sort of a settlement, this is a sort of\nGerman custom actually, that there were settlements of colonies, sort of colonies of\ncottages with very small pieces of land like gardens around them, which sort of say lower\nmiddle class Germans would own to have a place to go to on weekends. And so we went\nthere and looked at the place. It was again a cold winter day and the first thing we\nnoticed was that the roof was leaking and the cottage was really very primitive, there was\nof course, no inside running water, there was a pump in front of the house in the garden\nand, of course, there was no electricity, there was an oil lamp there, but for that one had\nto buy sort of a particular kind of petroleum which was almost impossible to get. Also\none could use candles, which also were hard to get. And then for heating, basically, there\nwas a kitchen stove which served both as a stove for heating and as a stove for cooking, it\nwas sort of a cast iron sort of a rectangular body on cast iron legs and on top there were\nsort of concentric rings of iron which could be taken out and pots of different sizes put in\nthere to heat things and cook things. And that was all there was and the furniture,\nobviously, was very primitive, there were two rooms and a sort of a veranda. And we\nwere desperate and so anyway, we said we would have to make do and she agreed to let\nus have the place and, of course, she impressed on us the need to be extremely careful\nand, but I mean, we were aware of that ourselves. Our punishment would have been\nAuschwitz if we would have been not careful and would have been discovered and she\nwould have probably also wound up in a concentration camp.",
        "A: Yeah, I'm coming to that. I mean that was just a visit there. So she let it, and she\ndidn't take, she took a small rent, I forgot what it was any more, it may have been on the\norder of 40 to 50 mark per month, which at that time was nothing. And the garden,\nincidentally, contained a number of marvelous fruit trees, some cherry and also plum\ntrees and even the, and she told us we could use the harvest and the harvest was so rich\nthat in terms of black market money, that was almost more than the 40 or 50 mark that\nwe paid her for the rent. And yeah, okay, so then we, that was agreed upon and then we\ndecided we would move out there as soon as possible, having, you know, we had to settle\ncertain affairs, but I didn't, I was out of our apartment and that was it and everything in\nthere was gone as far as I was concerned. But I had, the only things I had taken, of\ncourse, personal items like clothing along already to the maid's room at Margot's parent's\nhouse so I was all set up to move there. But they had to pack their things yet and that\ntook a few days and then actually on the 30th of January, 1943, we moved out to that, the\nname of the village, incidentally, was Senzig, S-E-N-Z-I-G. And now a completely\ndifferent life started for us. I considered it at the time a real adventure, first of all, I was\nfinally off that continuous pressure that was increasing by the month of whether to be\npicked up and to be deported and I felt for the first time in years, like a free person and I\nalso felt that I somehow I am in control of my life now, which I wasn't before. And\nfurthermore, I mean the threat was lifted and I could do what I wanted to do, not exactly\nactually, but at least in a limited way. Yeah, there were obviously many, many things\nnow to consider. The first item was money. I have to, again, sort of back track a little\nbit. My father had stored away some, what was called black money, in the years before\nhis arrest, because all Jewish assets, even if they were not confiscated, were blocked by\nthe German authority, by basically the German equivalent of the IRS, the Treasury\nDepartment. That meant that these assets still belonged to the particular Jewish owner,\nbut he could not, he or she could not freely dispose of them. Each family had, was given\nby the Gestapo, a maximum amount of money it could spend per month and withdraw\nfrom the bank account. Obviously, that was all in preparation for confiscation. They\nwanted to prevent that Jews stash away money. So and that was based entirely on the\nsize of the family. Like we were four people. So I don't know what the amount was, but\nmy father had a certain amount of money, maximum amount that he could spend. And\nanything that he sold or so on, had to be paid into that blocked account also. But my\nfather did particularly at the time when our big apartment was given up, he sold many\nitems under the hand and established black accounts with a number of friends, basically\nthree. Two of them were former, no, one of them was a former client, that was a very\ninteresting man whom I'll talk about a little bit later. He was a furrier and, in fact, he had\nthe largest, probably the most prominent fur business in Berlin. One of his customers, in\nfact, was none other than Hermann Goring, one of the top Nazis and commander in chief\nof the air force in addition to many other offices that he held. And his name was Walter\nLange and, in fact, he had a Jewish wife and he told us that Goring called him up in the\nsummer of 1939 telling him, if you want to, your wife to be safe, get her out now and I'll\nsee to it that anything that she wants to take out, she can. At that time, an ordinary Jew\nwho emigrated, could take out only very limited amounts of valuables and so on. And he\nshipped his wife out with I know oriental rugs and other valuables to England and they\nhad a son, by the way, and the son also, so they were now in safety in England, safety\nexcept for German air raids, maybe. But, of course, he conducted, kept conducting his\nbusiness. And he, I forgot what the exact amounts of money were, but it was a fairly\nsizeable amount that he kept in a separate account for my father. And my father had told\nhim and also the others that 1f anything happened to him, then I should have access to\nthese assets. The second person was actually the father of the German lawyer whom I\nhad mentioned earlier who had warned my father of his imminent arrest after\nKristallnacht and I think I mentioned at the time, that the father of this lawyer had been a\nMinister of the Interior in one of the pre-Hitler governments of the Weimar Republic.\nThe son, the lawyer himself, who had warned my father, was by that time, of course,\ndrafted and was an officer in the Wehrmacht, but the father was an elderly gentleman and\nhe kept also a sizeable amount of money for my father and also was informed that I\nshould have access to these assets. The third person was my father's former accountant\nand tax advisor. He actually had the smallest amount, but also I think 1t was somewhere\nbetween five and ten thousand Deutsche Reichsmark, which was at that time fairly\nsizeable. The interesting thing is that he was the only one who cheated me of the money.\nObviously, because of the danger for them and for us, no receipts were ever exchanged, I\nmean it was all just by word of honor. And when I came to claim part of the money, he\ntold me with a straight face, and in fact, that was at the time that my father was still in the\ntransit camp, and he told me with a straight face that unfortunately my father did not\nfollow his advice to let him keep the money, but he picked the money up about three or\nfour months ago and he advised my father that was not a good idea, that he should, it\nwould be better for the safety of the money if he would keep the money.\nEnd of side tape three.\nTape 4",
        "A: Yeah, I, then had my father asked about that, as I explained earlier, my former\nmathematics teacher, Dr. Baer, was an orderly employed in that transit camp and he\nbrought messages back and forth between my father and myself and also every day I\nmade sandwiches for them and he would take them in. And I sent a sort of, obviously,\ncloaked message just saying that the accountant said that he had picked everything up and\nmy father sent a message back, that is definitely not so and he has everything. So I went\nback to the accountant for a second time and told him the message of my father and he\nbecame then at first just unfriendly, but when I kept persisting, he pointed to the\ntelephone and said if I don't leave him alone, you know, he has one phone call to make to\nthe police and then I can explain to them that he owes me money. Well at that point, I\nturned around and left and I guess that's one of these unfortunate experiences. So money\nwas a problem. Another problem was, of course, how to arrange our lives there. We,\nthese plots in these settlements are very close together, you cannot live there literally in\nhiding and avoid people, in fact, that would have aroused suspicion. Neighbors are\ntraditionally, in these settlements, very close, talk to each other and so on, so we decided\nwe, first of all, we have to have a believable story, you know, who we are and so on. So\nwe concocted a whole sort of curriculum vitae for ourselves and the story was, our papers\nincidentally were all made in the last name of Hesse, mine, too, H-E-S-S-E. And the\nstory was that this was a couple with their daughter, Margot, and I was a nephew, in other\nwords, the son of Mr. Hesse's brother. And my parents had been killed in an accident\nwhile I was still a baby and I had been raised by my aunt and uncle and so. They were\nalmost total strangers to me, I just met them a few months before, but I had to train\nmyself to address them in the sort of familiar German Du form and also, instead of\ncalling them Mr. or Mrs. Hesse, I had to call them Uncle Hermann and Aunt Lucy. And\nincidentally, the name Hermann Hesse also was chosen because from the telephone book,\nthat actually Mr. Hesse found that out, there existed a real Hermann Hesse at a Berlin\naddress and that was the address that we gave. So if somebody just made a cursory\ncheck, say with our ID, there existed such a person at the address that we gave. Okay, we\nalso had to have credible stories of what our lives were like. For example in my case, a\nGerman, which I pretended to be, would normally be inducted into the army and, of\ncourse, I was a civilian. Now I, after my ID was taken away by the SS, from the German\nLabor Front, I acquired after a few months another ID as a technician in one of the major\nGerman defense plants in Berlin. And that, of course, was in itself an excellent alibi\nbecause a person of such technical expertise would be deferred from military service.\nHowever, I should also add that the ID requirements were much more rigorous. For\nexample, every male of military age, and I don't remember any more up to what age that\nwas, but surely much more than my age at that time which was 20. Every such person\nhad to have military papers. If the person was actually a member of the Wehrmacht, it\nmeans of any one of the three branches, army, navy or air force, the person had to have a\nMilitarpass, military pass, with picture, identifying the unit, etcetera, etcetera. If the\nperson was exempt from military service for whatever reason, then also a military paper\nwith picture and other personal information, stating that reason, be it deferment for job\nreasons or maybe for health reasons, somebody may have had only one leg, for example,\nthe paper would have to state what the reason was and that also had to be carried on the\nperson and shown on request. In the case of job deferment, in fact that paper was only\nissued for a limited time, I forgot exactly but I believe it was six months. So after, it had\nto be revalidated every six months. That made it very difficult to obtain forgeries. First\nof all, forgeries of military papers were very rare and hard to get in the first place, and\nthen it was only valid for six months; then it had to be revalidated. And as I said, I had\nnow obtained an ID as a technician for a defense plant in Berlin and I, and with that I\nlived for the rest of the war, showing it the many times that I was asked for an ID and in\nfact, it was convincing enough so that there was never a follow-up question, but I was\naware of the fact that each time the official asking me to identify myself could have asked\nwhere is your Wehrmacht ID? And then I had already prepared one fall back and that\nwas that I would pretend to go through the, I would actually go through the pockets of my\njacket and pretend to look for the paper and then with surprise on my face say, ah, I must\nhave left it in the coat that I wore yesterday. And at that point, the official could have\nsaid, well, I believe you this time, but be sure don't forget it again. He could, however\nalso, have told me, in that case I have to take you along to check you out, in which case I\nwould have been done. And in fact, that never occurred and in all of my cases where I\nwas controlled for ID, that ID that I had and the one that I obtained later that I will\ndiscuss then, was sufficient. I think that also had to do with the fact that I had learned by\nliving in Nazi Germany since '33 and by being in that Nazi gymnasium or high school for\ntwo years from '33 to '35, I had learned exactly the correct Nazi demeanor. They were in\nmany ways sort of very naive almost bordering on the childish. For example, whenever I\nwas asked for an ID, before I did anything like showing my ID, I would in this military\ndemeanor click my heels, I had special heels for that with sort of iron or steel plates to\nprovide the impressive military click that German soldiers had, I would stretch out my\nright arm, say a snappy Heil Hitler, and then I would show my, and such silly little things\nwould make just the right impression and would dispel any, in most cases at least, any\nsuspicion that I could be anything but a convinced and truthful Nazi. Yeah, that was my\ncase. Then the case of Mr. Hesse, Margot's father, he was actually by profession a tailor\nand pattern maker and had owned a women's coat factory in earlier years, in the '30's, and\nthen when forced labor came, he was actually drafted into a uniform, military uniform\nfactory and had also, even though he was a Jew, a position of sort of a supervisory\nposition there because of his background and knowledge. So he carried that, continued\nthat and also said that he was in such a factory. In addition to that of course, he had the\nID for the Deutsche Arbeitsfront, which was sort of like a secondary position he\npretended. Margot's mother had an undefined office job in Berlin and Margot herself\nactually was by training a baby nurse and she worked in sort of a German nursery. These\nstarted to spring up now, today they would be called day care centers, because many\nGerman women were not exactly forcibly drafted to work in factories, but they were\nstrongly coerced and urged because there was a tremendous need, obviously, for factory\nworkers because German males were in the army. And because of the fact that many of\nthese women worked, there was a need for day care centers. So Margot pretended to\nwork in one of those. But that alone, to have a job, a credible job wasn't really enough. I\nmean, the thing is that village where we lived was about three to four miles away from\nthe nearest commuter station to Berlin and people either bicycled from the village and\nparked their bicycles then at the railroad station, there were bicycle racks, or they took a\npostal bus that sort of went down the country road which the village was at certain\nschedules, I forgot what it was, but not very frequently, I think once an hour or so. And\nnow I went into Berlin actually twice a week to maintain contact with black market\nsources to obtain food and so I made it a point then always to take the bus and people saw\nme at the bus stop and, of course, I pretended to go to work to my factory. On other days\nwhen I did not go there, since it was also known that I had a bicycle and I would bicycle\naround the neighborhood, I simply sort of spread the word that whenever I had a chance,\nI liked to bicycle, I would take the bicycle to that commuter line station and park it there\nso that people wouldn't wonder why I wasn't there regularly. I forgot what Margot's\nfather's alibi was, he and his wife also went into Berlin twice a week to catch up with\ntheir and keep contact with their black market sources. Margot herself was, number one,\nthe most Jewish looking of the four of us and on top of it, she was at that time always\nextremely nervous and afraid, and so she stayed out there and never went into the city\nand that created somewhat of a problem, but what she had to do was to stay inside the\nhouse, I mean people didn't check up really literally, and she just stayed inside the house\nall day and only appeared outside after, I don't know, five or six when people normally\nwould be home from their jobs. Another very important issue was that of police\nregistration. In Germany at that time, and I believe even today still, every person has to\nbe registered with the police at his or her place of residence and a person can only have\none place of residence. Now, all the people out there who lived in these houses, in these\ncottages, some were as primitive as ours, others may have been a little bit more fancy,\nthey actually had apartments in Berlin where they were registered with the police and\nthey moved out there because just about the time when we went underground, air raids\nincreased tremendously, particularly the American air force which was stationed at air\nfields in, on the British Islands and would regularly attack Berlin. Later on, actually, on a\ndaily basis, in early '43 it wasn't that frequent, but still frequent enough for people to be\nscared. So, therefore, people preferred the safety of some village which surely wouldn't\nbe bombed, to being in Berlin and being trapped in an apartment building. But that, of\ncourse, posed a problem for them because, as I said, by law everybody has to be\nregistered and a person can only be registered at one place with the police. So if these\npeople would have to, so if you, if a person moved there was actually also a\nde-registration form. The person had to de-register at his or her old residence and then\nthe person actually received a copy of the de-registration form to present at the new place\nwhere the person would then register. Well, if the people would have done that, would\nhave de-registered in Berlin, they would immediately have lost their apartments since as a\nresult of the air raids many people lost their apartments and there was practically no new\nbuilding going on because of wartime conditions and all of the raw material and labor\nwere really put into the war effort to build tanks, planes and whatever else was needed.\nSo there was an acute and increasing shortage of apartments, so if somebody moved out\nof his apartment, the first thing was that it would be snapped away by the housing\nauthority and the apartment would be given over to some bombed out family. And of\ncourse, people wanted to maintain their apartments. To make a long story short, the\nresult was that all of these good Germans who lived out there, lived there essentially,\nquote, illegally. They did not register there because they couldn't because they didn't\nwant to de-register and give up their Berlin apartments. The local police which was in\ncharge of that, of course, knew about it and simply looked the other way because it was\nunderstandable, you know, people didn't want to lose their city apartments. And that was\na perfect argument for us because we couldn't register for different reasons, we were\nunderground Jews. But we had that perfect argument, of course we had our apartment in\nBerlin and as I mentioned earlier, the address that we gave, the fictitious, there was\nactually a Hermann Hesse living there, so somebody could check us out in the telephone\nbook and we were there only for fear of the air raids. So actually I always felt that was\nthe first time in my life that the Americans came and helped me. So, alright, that was,\nyeah, and then what we did in the beginning was, we had several sessions in that little\ncottage where we interrogated ourselves on all of these issues, you know, I mean who I\nwas, I was a nephew and that my parents had died while I was still a baby and I was\nraised by my aunt and uncle and where I worked and where they worked and so that\nbecame part of our nature, we constantly asked ourselves these questions so that nobody\nwould ever make a slip-up or give some wrong answer or even an answer contradicting\nsomebody or somebody else who said something. And, alright, I should say also by the\nway, the date that we moved out there, I mentioned earlier was the 30th of January, 1943,\nwas an extremely interesting date. First of all, it was the 10th anniversary of Hitler's\nassumption of power, that he was named Reich Chancellor, and secondly and more\nimportant for us, it was the day on which Field Marshall Paulus, commander of German\nSixth Army in the Ukraine, surrendered his army in the city of Stalingrad. The huge\nbattle of Stalingrad which had raged from October through January, that means four\nmonths, the Germans had lost and it was the first major military loss for the Germans.\nAnd that made us unbelievably ecstatic. In fact, we decided that after that loss the war\ncan't last longer than next summer, meaning the summer of '43. I think it was that\noptimism that made us keep going. We would have, if we would have known it would\nlast another over two years, I don't know whether, what we would have, I guess we had\nno other choice anyway, but it kept our spirits up. Yeah, then the food situation. As I\nhad mentioned earlier also, food was rationed, the ration coupons were given out to\npeople who were registered with the police, see, the food rationing offices had actually a\nduplicate of the police registration file. So obviously, since we were not registered with\nthe police, we couldn't get food ration cards and therefore, we had to buy all of our food\non the black market. The black market does not mean that there was actually a market\nsomewhere where people traded. I mean that would have been immediately, been\nexploded by the Gestapo. Black market simply means that people were trading in\nrationed food, but without ration coupons. Who were these people? Well, they were all\nkinds of people. First of all, fellow underground Jews, you know for example, somebody\nmight have had a terrific source for baked goods and breads but nothing else, but that\nperson would then trade in breads and sell them at a profit for him and use that maybe to\nbuy a sausage from somebody else who had that source. And so there was, we knew of\nquite a circle of underground Jews and so that was also a source for black market food.\nThen various sympathetic gentiles, I had for example, a house maid of my maternal\ngrandparents, in fact my maternal grandmother died, fortunately a natural death, only a\nfew months before the deportations started. And her last maid, she had been with my\ngrandmother for many years and she was a very faithful family friend and she was the\nlast one who could afford even to buy black market food, but she was a very modest and\nsimple person and she claimed she didn't even need all the food that she was getting on\nher ration cards. So I went there, one of the stops that I did on my Berlin visits was her\nlittle apartment and she always had some food, first of all she always fed me a warm meal\nand then she also gave me something that she had saved from her rations. Then there was\nthe butcher of the Hesse family, near where they lived. Now, they were very decent\npeople, very strongly anti-Nazi and when they told them that they were going\nunderground, they immediately promised to supply them as much as they could with\nmeats. But the problem was they couldn't really go there because they were known in the\nneighborhood, they lived around the corner there from that butcher and everybody knew\nthem. If they would appear there without a star, somebody would surely denounce them.\nSo before we actually went underground, I was introduced to them and as I had\nmentioned earlier, we had lived, our family lived in a totally different part of Berlin. So\nnot a soul knew me there. So I was introduced, and there was also a ruse agreed upon\nhow I would go about getting food from her. But people were very jealous in those days\nand so I would come into the store and say to her that my mother was in here this\nmorning and left an order for sausage and meat and gave you already the food stamps and\nshe would say yes, that's right, I have your order ready. Then she would go in the back\nand pack us whatever she felt like up and charged me just the regular amount of money\nfor these items, which were all under price control. She could have, I should have said\nearlier, on the black market roughly the price of food was 10 times the regular price\ncontrol price, it varied a little bit, 1t also depend on what kind of food, but that was a good\naverage. And she could have made a lot of money with that, instead she sold it to me\nexactly at the price that was under price control and that was also purely, I mean, out of\nsupport. And then another important item, incidentally, which people never think about,\nis shoe repair. Not only were shoes rationed, but shoe repair was rationed. In other\nwords, if you needed a new sole, there was a ration coupon that you had to hand in for a\nsole for a shoe and we didn't have that. Well, here our old shoemaker from our area had\nagreed to support us and the thing was, he was actually a secret communist and, of\ncourse, he was not active in the underground communist party, but he had been a\ncommunist earlier and maintained his sympathies. And his shoe shop was not as close to\nour old apartment as that butcher was to the Hesse's apartment, so I could go there\nwithout fearing to run into anybody. So we had all our shoe repairs and that was, in the\nlong run, that was as much a life saver as food. What are you going to do if your shoes\nfall apart, you can't get new shoes, you can't repair them, that basically condemns you to\nstay at home, so we solved that problem with him. And then we had various other, I\nmean there was a whole bunch of people who we relied on to obtain food and for the\nmoney, as I said, we paid, I used the money gradually that I obtained from the assets of\nmy father that I talked about earlier.",
        "A: No, I mean the difficulty might have been in somebody whom [ ran across sort of\nunexpectedly somewhere, but the people that we had sort of contact with, we knew we\ncould trust.",
        "A: Yeah, I mean, Berlin was a city at that time still close to five million people, in a\nsense even though New York is much bigger, it 1s also similar in the sense that you don't\nrun into people. Yeah, and of course, one thing, we had to be very careful where we\nwent. I mean, I never went into our old neighborhood and they never went into theirs.\nAnd also then there were certain areas, I'll discuss that a little bit later, where sort of Jews\nwere sort of quote, known to be often and we tried to avoid these areas also. But there is\na possibility, I mean there was a possibility and you didn't trust anyone at all.",
        "A: Yeah, okay, in the village, okay, that was a, I sort of said already how we concocted\nour story there and we decided from the beginning then to just act like normal neighbors\nand anything else would have been impossible anyway. So we actually started a whole\nsocial life there, we met people and, you know, invited each other, we were invited, we\ninvited people for, I don't know, a game of cards or whatever. The most interesting\nperson actually we met, was the local Nazi party chieftain for that village. He, I mean\nMargot's father, was a very good accordion player and he played often and I guess in\nthose cottages the walls are thin anyway, somehow that became known that he plays the\naccordion and that Nazi, his name was Harry Gladenik, a very nice charming fellow, you\nknow. In spite of the fact that he was a rabid Nazi. He came over and said he heard that\nhere someone plays the accordion and he loves accordion music and they have actually\nevery Saturday evening, a party at his house with dancing and so on and why don't we\ncome over sort of sometime and participate in that. So we were frequent guests then at\nthe home of that Nazi, dancing with some of the women there and what was for me most\nimportant, more important than the dancing at least, was the food. They had what\nseemed to me limitless supplies of food there, I don't know what their sources were, but\npart of the source, in fact, was the sister of Harry Gladenik, that Nazi. She lived with\nthem, but her husband who was also a real professional Nazi ideologue, was an official in\nthe German occupation of the Soviet Union and had his ways of obtaining meat and\nsausages and all kinds of other goodies that were, even for good Germans, hard to get in\nGermany. And he sent regular packages and so that was all served there and we always\nenjoyed going there and had a wonderful time with these people.",
        "A: Yeah, totally, I totally sort of divorced myself from my real self and chatted with\nthem and later on I think I felt sort of elation that, you know, that I was able to put up\nsuch a front and, I mean this whole, in the beginning I changed, in the later part of the\nwar. In the beginning this whole life of deception sort of had some tremendous attraction\nfor me, now it sounds almost childish, but I felt somewhat like a secret agent in enemy\nterritory, trying to pretend something that wasn't the case and fooling all of the enemies.",
        "A: What element of risk was there anyway? I mean, but I mean after having lived by\nthat time, a year and a half before we went underground with the threat of deportation,\nwhich was a constant risk and something that was out of my control even. I felt like a\nfree person there.",
        "A: No. Yeah, and she wasn't really known too well. She had just bought it a year before\nand was a few times, so yeah, she obviously knew us, but no, nobody else knew us.",
        "A: Yeah, right. There was one fellow actually, he was an interesting fellow,\nunfortunately I lost contact with him after the war, his name was Heinz Jacobius. He was\nthe most versatile person, underground Jew, that I encountered. He lived in the middle of\nthe city with an Aryan girlfriend and of course, he also was not registered and in the city\nit was even more complicated than in the country where we were because the janitors of\nbuildings sort of had, they were legally obligated to see to it that every tenant was\nregistered with the police. In fact, he had to countersign the registration form that one\nhad to fill out. And if somebody, you know, regularly comes by, the janitor is supposed\nto watch out so they were somewhat like spies also, they're supposed to notice that and\nreport that person. But that Heinz Jacobius, he was a tremendous black market artist and\nhe just fed that janitor so well that he surely had no interest in killing the goose that laid\nhis golden eggs. Yeah, and actually he was, and then his house was hit by incendiary\nbombs during an air raid. And, of course, that scared him because if that house would\nhave burned down, then you know, that would have sort of destroyed the whole\narrangement. And during wartime, incidentally, the fire department, and that was made\nknown also, did never, never did anything to protect or put out fires in ordinary apartment\nhouses because they were needed for more important objects, you know, either\ngovernment or military installations and so on and so the whole population had been\ntrained in extinguishing fires. And he apparently distinguished himself, went out of his\nway in I don't know, whatever he did, that anyway, the local party organization gave him\na special sort of order of merit that people got for going out of their way and beyond the\ncall of duty in putting out the fire, which they did.",
        "A: No. I mean, there was what you might call an informal network. I knew some and\nthen others knew some others, but it had nothing to do, in other words, with any attempt\neven at sabotage. We were totally devoted to only surviving and not being caught. I\nmean sabotage would have endangered us even more.",
        "A: Yeah, well that's what that served, but on the other hand, you had to be very careful if\nyou, I'm coming to something that I haven't mentioned yet, but the Gestapo employed a\nnumber of Jewish spies and if you met a Jew whom you had not seen sort of on a more or\nless continuous basis, you didn't know whether that person was legitimately underground,\nlike I was, or whether that was a spy working for the Gestapo and ready to hand me over.\nSo, for that reason, one, the unwritten law was, first of all you did not disclose to anyone\nwhere you lived. And secondly, if you met somebody, say just on the street, from earlier\ntimes, you would try to avoid that person.\nEnd of side one of tape four.",
        "A: Another important aspect of our stay there was the total change in lifestyle. I mean, I\nwas even in the apartment where we were forced into in the Jewish house. It was still,\nyou know, we had running water, we had running toilet, water toilets, even running hot\nwater, central heating and all these amenities. And suddenly from one day to the next,\ntransformed, transferred into that primitive cottage, was a tremendous, I don't know if\nculture shock as far as the wrong word, sort of a living style shock would be probably\nbetter. We had to, as I said, get our water from a pump outside and we learned that if it\nfreezes, then the pump freezes and you had to do all kinds of shenanigans to unfreeze the\npump, like pouring hot water through a priming hole. We had, of course obviously, no\nwater toilet, but an outhouse which was very primitive and in winter very cold. And, as I\nalso said, there was of course no electricity. We had, for a lot of money we had to buy\npetroleum on the black market to run the one petroleum lamp and also had candles for\nwhich we had to pay a lot of money. And so it was a total change in lifestyle and I found\nthat at the time, very romantic and felt that living in a big city apartment house with\nrunning water and central heating made us only degenerate and now at least these\nhorrible times had one advantage, they make us sort of return to nature and so that we\nreally appreciate what is heat. Heat 1s not just some pipes that radiate heat, but in our\ncase, wood had to be cut with an ax and was hard work and that's how you create your\nheat. And water had to be obtained from a pump and sometimes you had to unfreeze it\nand I remember at that time I was very romantic about all of this and thought that was a\ngreat thing that was happening to me that I was returning to nature in some form. Okay,\nyeah, I had mentioned earlier also, these so-called black accounts that my father had with\nvarious people. Now it turned out that the black market prices were continuously\nincreasing, there was an inflation even in the black market and so I was aware of the fact,\nyou know, a fixed sum of money sort of would shrink in purchasing power over the years\nand I wanted to avoid that. So, the money which I had with that former client furrier,\nclient of my father, I decided to invest in something that would keep its value at least for,\nor would increase with inflation, thereby keeping its purchasing power. And through a\nfriend I had the opportunity to buy a women's sort of evening handbag made out of sort\nof high carat gold and platinum, little elements sort of like in a chain. And for that\nhandbag I paid twelve thousand Reichsmark and then I gave it back to the furrier because\nI didn't want to have it for fear, you know, something happens and so he kept it. But he\nalso offered me to do some work on his estate. He had a fantastic estate outside of\nBerlin, east of Berlin in a very fancy area with big mansions and he said he needed\nanyway some workers and if I came, he would feed me for that day and pay me also and\nin addition, he also dealt on a large scale in black market, there would be always some\nthings that he could give me along. So once a week, I went out to his estate. Now on that\nestate, he had actually three workers already. One was a Polish couple, they were real\npeasants and in fact he detailed me sort of to that Polish guy and he told me what to do.\nAnd his wife was I think sort of a cleaning woman in his house. And then he had a single\nPolish girl, a young woman, her name was Maria and she was the cook and also sort of\nhomemaker. And incidentally, I have to add that he had all these workers was only a\nresult of his connections. As I said earlier, he supplied Goring with furs, because\naccording to the law at that time, forced foreign laborers could be used only in either\nagriculture or defense plants. And agriculture meant not for the people, you know,\npeople for their own back yards as he did, but agriculture in the sense these were\nsuppliers of food for the population. So he was legally not entitled to them but had them\nanyway. But I mean the German, the system under the Nazis was shot through with\ncorruption and anyone could get anything he wanted. I mean, incidentally, the film\nSchindler's List 1s an excellent example how Schindler, even in Auschwitz with a number\nof diamonds, gets his workers out of the concentration camp again. So I went, as I said, I\nwent there once a week and worked under the supervision of that Polish peasant and that\npeasant, he talked German haltingly but fairly well, and he was obsessed because he was\na great Polish patriot and he was obsessed with, I mean with the terrible fate of Poland.\nAnd in his theory, the cause for the terrible fate of Poland, it had two causes. One was\nthe communists or the Soviets and the other one was the Jews. The Germans, for some\nreason, never occurred to him, even though they were the ones to attack Poland. And so I\nhad to listen to his antisemitic tirades and sort of appear to agree with him. And another\naspect, there was that Maria, the maid, every time when I was ready to leave, she called\nme to her room to give me some food and also something to eat right there and something\nto take along. And I was convinced that she must sort of be secretly in love with me, but\nI didn't want to have anything to do with her, I mean for many reasons. First of all, I\nwasn't attracted to her and secondly, I felt any involvement of that kind can only be\ndangerous. - One of the other underground friends, we had a whole circle of people who\nwere underground, not a circle in the sense that we actually lived together, but we kept in\ntouch with each other, and one of them was a fellow from my high school graduating\nclass. His name was Gerd Cohn. He lived also with a non-Jewish girlfriend and he had\nall kinds of contacts also for black market foods and necessities. And one day he told me\nthat he met a group of foreign forced laborers who were a tremendous source of black\nmarket food. And in fact, there was a plan somewhere to illegally slaughter a pig and sell\nit off right away. And he asked me, he had to, he was going there, he had to commit\nhimself, however, to a given amount of pounds of meat and I discussed it at home and I\ngave him a certain order, I forgot what it was, X number of pounds and, incidentally, the\nlistener will from that, I guess, gather that I don't eat kosher which is true. I never did eat\nkosher and actually I always enjoyed ham, but at that point we didn't even have the\nluxury of being very choosy. Anyway to make a long story short, on the day, on the\nappointed day when I was supposed to come to pick up the meat, his girlfriend was in\nhysterics. He didn't come back, and the next day he didn't come back either. And of\ncourse, there was no way, where do you go to find out? Now, this under, other\nunderground Jewish friend of mine whom I had mentioned earlier, Heinz Jacobius, who\nyou know also did all kinds of things in the underground, he even, he had some sort of a\nline, I didn't know what it was, to the Gestapo where he could find out things and I asked\nhim to make some inquiries whether this Gerd Cohn ever appeared. The thing is here, all\nJews who were arrested for deportation ultimately wound up in the transit camp. And he\nmade those inquiries and there was no Gerd Cohn ever appeared there. So it was clear\nthat he must have been the victim of a crime and there was actually a German newspaper\narticle that, about two weeks later or so, that a torso with the head missing and the hands\nmissing and these would be the identifiers, the hands, because of fingerprints and\nobviously the head because of the facial features, was found floating in the river. Oh\nyeah, and it was, the article mentioned a certain scar, I forgot from some operation, and\nfriends of his knew that he had such a scar. So apparently, he must have had some\nhorrible fate and the suspicion was that these foreign laborers, apparently you know, he\nhad first of all, a large amount of money with him to purchase that large amount of meat\nthat he had ordered, and in addition to that, he had some excellent forged ID which could\nalways be re-forged into a different name or a different picture, and maybe other things\nthat were of value to those guys, so the opinion among people who knew him and the\ncircumstances was that he was, that this was a trap, there never was a pig and that he was\nmurdered. That he was lured into that trap and lost his life that way, a horrible fate.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, actually, no that's a good question. The Germans somehow abhor sort of random\nviolence. In fact the Kristallnacht even, which was a case of random violence, was\ncriticized within the Nazi circles very much and in fact actually, at a ministerial meeting,\na cabinet meeting two days afterwards, Goring severely criticized, I think Goebbels was\nmainly behind that, because of all the destruction. It turned out that the kind of glass that\nis used for shop windows was, at that time was a glass that was not even made in\nGermany, they had to buy it in Belgium, that means they had to use foreign exchange and\nthen Goring turned to Goebbels and said, you could have, it would have been better if\nyou would have killed a few more hundred Jews rather than cause all of that destruction\nwhich now we have to, you know, so they are, anyway to come back specifically to your\nquestion, that process was very orderly. The Jew was arrested, he was put into that camp\nuntil enough people were together to put together a transport and then they were shipped\noff. I mean, they may have been beaten up maybe in some sadistic urge by some SS\nmen, but...",
        "A: No. I mean, if you did something wrong, yeah, I mean, they had a bunker there\nwhich was a sort of a nickname for a part of the basement, I think it was only four feet\nhigh and only a few square feet, people were put in as punishment. Particularly if there\nwere escape attempts, that sort of thing. But they were not shot sort of randomly like you\nsaw in the film Schindler's List, that was not, they were always shipped for orderly\nkilling. Let me see, yeah, I had mentioned already that if one met some Jewish person in\nthe underground whom one hadn't seen for a long time, the initial reaction was always to\nbe suspicious. I'm coming now probably to the saddest chapter of the underground, and\nthese are the Jewish catchers or spies. The Gestapo kept a sort of a small herd of them\nand they operated also out of the transit camp. Incidentally, the transit camp had shifted\nin the meantime. It was no longer in the old age home, I think the old age home was then\nused for other governmental purposes. The transit camp was shifted to the Jewish\nhospital of Berlin, which was then the last place, I mean sort of Jewish owned building in\nthe city. And a part of, one wing of the hospital was turned over to the Gestapo to\nmaintain the transit camp. And the spies also had their rooms in that transit camp and\nthey lived there, but they could come and go as they wanted, of course, and more\nimportantly, they obviously didn't wear the yellow star as they normally would have had\nto. And their task was to track down Jews, other Jews who were underground. And the\nsad story 1s that first of all, they were incredibly more effective than the Gestapo because\nthe Gestapo basically in tracking down a Jew, was sort of like a blind person trying to\nfind something, they had really nothing to go by. While the spies, all of them had\nthemselves been underground and had then been caught and they knew many of the tricks\nand trades of underground Jews. They knew where to go to and so on and they had a\nmuch better nose, plus many of them, of course, knew other underground Jews anyway\nand would just give those names to the Gestapo. Now the most notorious of these was a\nwoman, her maiden name was Stella Goldschlag, and unfortunately, I knew her fairly\nwell. She worked part of the time that I was at Siemens, she also worked for Siemens.\nAt that time, she was married to a man whose last name was Kubler, so then her name\nwas Stella Kiibler. Stella was a strikingly beautiful woman, she was tall, slender, had\nlong golden blond locks, wavy hair and blue eyes and a very pretty face. She, at Siemens\nalso, she was sort of the center of attention. I came to know her, even though she was not\nin my department but in a different one, in fact she was in the same department where\nsome members of the Baum group, this underground Jewish communist group, were\nworking that I had mentioned earlier. But, in my class in the orthodox school that I went\nto in the '30's was a boy named Klaus Goldschlag, in fact I remembered him very well, he\nwas the top student in our class. And I know he left and emigrated to Canada. And\nGoldschlag is not exactly a common name, so when I met her first, I asked her whether\nshe is related to him and then she said, yeah, that's her cousin, and so we talked several\ntimes about him and then also sometimes about other things. But otherwise, I had not\nmuch in common with her, I don't think she had any, to my knowledge, any intellectual\ninterests or music interests and the circles that I sort of circulated in, she surely did not\nbelong to. But, through the mouth radio, sometime in the, maybe mid-'43, I heard that\nshe is working for the Gestapo as a catcher and that really scared me. And in fact, I know\nthat at one point, I almost encountered her. What happened was the following thing.\nEven in walking around in Berlin, I developed various strategies to avoid being\nrecognized and one was, in a big city of course, there 1s a lot of pedestrian traffic, you\nknow, people walking this way, people walking that way, and when I walked down a\nstreet, I would look at the faces of the people, not who would just be in front of me, but\nthree or four people down behind them, so that I would, could possibly recognize others\nbefore I was recognized by them. That was one, the other strategy was that I always had\na handkerchief at hand and if some real emergency arose, I would pretend to have to\nblow my nose, but in such a way that I covered most of my face with my handkerchief\nand wouldn't be recognizable that way. So one day I was walking down a street, I even\nremember the name, Pfalzburger Strasse, and I saw, again looking back several people\nbeyond the one that immediately faced me and I saw what seemed to be Stella. I couldn't\n100% identify her, but I, obviously I didn't want to take a chance, you know, to get closer\nto her. I immediately decided turning around and running away would be the worst thing\nto do and I was lucky, just at that point where I recognized her, I passed a store, so I just\nwent into the store pretending, I remember it was a green grocer, so he had potatoes,\nvegetables, things like that. And I turned my back to the window and pretending to look\nat various items in the store. For awhile the saleswoman or probably the owner, already\nasked me what I wanted and I said, well, I just want to see what you have and so on and\nthen after quite a while, after she must have long passed, I sort of excused myself and\nlooked out and she was gone. I mean, there has been a book written about her and she\nhas really caused the death of many people. Now, she was after the war then tried in a\nGerman court, well first she was tried by the Russians who everybody hoped would just\nfinish her off, instead they gave her just a 10-year sentence from '46 to '56. Then she\nreappeared and then there was an unbelievable clamor that for her to be put away. And\nthen the Germans meticulously said, well, a person cannot be tried for the same crime\ntwice, but there were in the meantime, many other arrests that she made which had not\nbeen covered by the Soviet trial and so she was then tried for those cases and then she\nwas found guilty and the judge gave her another 10 years, but applying the 10 years that\nshe already served under the Soviets, she was immediately set free. And it is known that\nshe lives now under an assumed name somewhere in West Germany. That is something,\nthat is some of the worst, she should have been done away with, preferably hanged\nimmediately after the war. Supposedly after some research that other people did, she is\nguilty of hundreds of lives that she gave over to the Gestapo.",
        "A: No, not at all.",
        "A: It was later, yeah.",
        "A: Well, I mean, what she was doing was to walk around Berlin and she knew where\nJews were likely to go and, for example, it became known that a very safe place was, of\nall places, the Berlin State Opera. And the Gestapo would never bother with that and\nmost Jews, they were music lovers, so you could have a pleasant evening even, listening\nto good music and be safe. The problem was that Stella knew that, too. So she appeared\nthere one day and arrested a whole family of, a sort of middle aged couple and a teenage\nson or something. You know, that was exactly the, and she would pull, she had a small\nrevolver that she would pull on people if they didn't exactly, and then one person tried to\nrun away and she shouted, stop him, it's a Jew, and there were some men that grabbed\nthat person.",
        "A: What was about her was self preservation, I mean that's how she survived the war, I\nmean by having others killed. Now, she claimed after the war also that she did it mainly\nto protect her parents. Yeah, well, she had a bargain initially with the Gestapo and SS\nofficial who commanded that transit camp. And the bargain was that her parents could\nstay also, they got a room there and they could stay there with her, she was an only child.\nAnd then at some point, I forgot when that was, I think late '43 or maybe early '44, the\nGestapo told her that they can't protect the parents any longer and then she managed to\nhave them transported to Theresienstadt, that was the only, instead of to Auschwitz, but\nthey were then transferred later to Auschwitz. I mean, the parents are sort of a tragic\nthing, they can't be blamed for what the daughter did, but she maintained her own life\nthat way by killing others. Now, there were many other people, a good friend of mine,\nIsmar Reich, who was underground and was caught. And he was immediately offered\nfreedom if he could name some others and he simply refused. And he said he wasn't\neven beaten, I mean he refused, fine, you don't want to, fine, you go to Auschwitz. Now,\nhe was a very clever resourceful guy. He was with some friends there and somehow they\nsucceeded in smuggling some tools with them and then while the train rolled, they started\nto saw, you know, they, these freight trains are basically wooden siding, they sawed some\nplanks off and when the train slowed down somewhere they jumped out and saved\nthemselves that way.",
        "A: I mean, too many probably. I don't know how many, but maybe 10, 15 or so.",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah, there were others, too. Maybe this is a point where I might indicate\nan incident that we had. We decided that in the long run it may not be safe if we stay just\nat that one point all the time. So we decided we ought to look for a sort of substitute\nplace in case we have to leave. So I contacted, I'm not sure whether I mentioned that, or\nmaybe I did, my father's, one of his clients were members of the Hohenzollern family, it\nwas actually the sister-in-law of the last German Kaiser and her son and they had an\nestate sort of half way Berlin, between Berlin and Potsdam, a suburb which used to be the\nsummer residence of Prussian kings. And she was, they were very good friends of our\nfamily and we made an appointment and Margot, her mother and I went there and\ndiscussed and I knew, apparently, something that she had separate servants quarters\nsomewhere and I discussed with her, you know, the possibility whether there might be\nsome place for us to spend maybe not long periods, but maybe a week or so at a time.\nAnd it was somewhat inconclusive and so on, I mean she also had to be careful,\nobviously, so on the way back from there, that estate was off a sort of a country road\nconnecting Berlin and Potsdam and where a bus only came, I don't know, once every\nhour, if that much. And we decided, we knew when the bus was coming and that maybe\nthere was another half hour left or so and there was a little country inn and we did have\nalso illegally obtained ration coupons, so why don't we go in and maybe have a piece of\ncake and a cup of coffee and talk there. So we went in and Margot's mother immediately,\nthere was a revolving door I remember, you know you go through the revolving door and\nthen you walk in. She instead of walking in, right away revolved back out and, you\nknow, that immediately rang a bell. So I didn't ask any questions and Margot not either.\nWe immediately revolved out and then the mother said that there was a couple sitting that\nshe knew, they are Jews, she don't know, she doesn't know, you know, what their\nbackground, who they are, but one has to be careful. So we walked out and then walked\nalong and decided maybe to walk to the next bus stop in order not to wait right in front\nthere. And as we walked, and we walked fairly briskly, we heard sort of footsteps\ncoming from behind, closing in, and it was the man. And he said, he saw us come in and\nhe had the impression maybe we were afraid of him, but there was no reason, we\nshouldn't be afraid, he is himself in hiding and we should just feel free to come in. That\nof course, was a giveaway already. No Jew at that time would have told somebody else\nwhom he hadn't known, like he didn't even know me, you know, that he was in hiding.\nHe should have been mistrustful of me as I would have been of him. Anyway, he sort of\nimplored us to come back and we just refused and as an excuse we gave that we\ndiscovered that we are actually late, we have to get back to Berlin to meet somebody or\nsome excuse like that and we were walking to the next bus stop. Yeah, and the man then\ngave up and returned to the restaurant where there was actually the previous bus stop was\nthere and we were hurrying up because it was already getting the time for the bus to come\nand we were still some distance away from the next bus stop when we saw the bus\ncoming and so we sort of speeded up but never made it. But as the bus passed us, in\nthose days busses were not closed, where you entered it was sort of open and there was\nan open platform at the back. And as the bus passed us, we saw that man standing in that\nbus. So then it was obvious that he was trying to follow us and was trying to take the\nsame bus with us. So we were glad we didn't make it to the next stop, instead after the\nbus had cleared there, we walked off the, this country road and there was a forest. Now, I\nhad the basic map of Berlin fairly well in my head, we didn't have a map along because it\ndidn't occur to us that we needed one. But I knew that in the direction if we walked, that\nwas walking east from there, just through forests, I mean it may have been several miles,\nwe would come to a suburban sort of commuter line where we could catch a train because\nwe were sure that if we would take the next bus, he would have alerted police at the next\nsuburban station for that line which was actually Wannsee. And so that's what we did.\nWe walked for hours through the forest roughly sort of keeping in the direction until we\ncame to that suburban line which was a totally different line and there we boarded the\ntrain and got back. But such incidents, I mean of that kind, happened fairly frequently.\nAnother incident that just occurred to me now, was, for heating our stove of course, we\nbought firewood which was expensive and even some coal and in addition to that, I went\nand collected sort of dead wood branches from the forest around that village there. And\nfor that, even for that one needed a official permission of the Forestry Department. I still\nhave that, it's sort of almost like a joke, it permits the bearer, Gunther Hesse, that was my\nname then, to collect dead branches that are lying on the floor. But of course, I didn't\nconfine myself to dead branches, I often just broke off live branches and even small trees\nand we would then sort of hack them into pieces and let them dry out before using them\nin our oven. The problem was that I was once observed by the forester and but he didn't\nstop me, I never saw him even and he didn't stop me and so I didn't know that I was\nobserved. But one of the settlers in our settlement was a good friend of his and he, and\nthe forester told him that he noticed that I was violating the law and taking live branches\nand he would have to report me. Now basically, that was probably a, you know, a kind of\noffense was a little fine, but the problem was if it was reported, I didn't exist legally and\nthat would have immediately endangered our existence there. So, but we had a\ntremendous source for cigarettes. Cigarettes were of course rationed. Margot's father was\na chain smoker and so he spent a lot of his money on cigarettes and he went to that other\nsettler and told him again a lie story, I mean the story was that if I got fined for that, then\nmy military exemption will immediately be taken away from me and I will be shipped to\nthe eastern front and by that time the eastern front was by everyone considered sort of\nlike a death sentence and people had sort of understanding for that. And if he can do\nsomething about it, you know, we will supply the necessary cartons of cigarettes and the\nforester had a certain price, I forgot what it was, several cartons, and of course, the guy\nhad to get his cut, too. And in this way we avoided that I was, you know, cited for that\noffense of taking live branches. Then another incident occurred once in splitting wood\nwith our ax. We didn't really have a proper base for splitting wood, but just sort of a\nrelatively soft wood stump and once when I sort of apparently hit the wood that I wanted\nto split particularly hard, I split not only the wood but also the stump and the ax went\nright into my foot at my ankle. And there was a really big open wound which obviously,\nfirst of all, needed to be sewn up and secondly also, probably my bone would have to be\nx-rayed in case the bone was damaged. So one of the neighbors who had a car drove me\nto the nearest hospital and then there was, of course, first we are afraid if they say I have\nto stay overnight then again, there was a need for identification and so on, so I was\nx-rayed and fortunately, they discovered that the bone wasn't damaged.\nEnd of tape four.\nTape 5",
        "A: So all that needed to be done was to sew up the wound and send me home, I thought.\nBut Margot's father was with me, we were in a sort of a holding area and a nurse\napproached with a needle and he knew something, I mean Margot's father, that I wasn't\naware of, namely that after such an injury one needs a tetanus shot. And the tetanus shot\nis given into a person's rear end and so he knew immediately they would ask me to lower\nmy pants and that would surely have been a 100% give-away to anyone in Germany who\nI really was, once they would have discovered my circumcision. So he had a quick\npresence of mind and I was lying on a stretcher and he turned me around on my belly and\nthen pulled my pants off before the nurse could get to me so I got the shot into my rear\nend and nobody saw anything else of me. And then I was sewn up and since hospitals\nanyway were short of beds, obviously because of the large demands for wounded\nsoldiers, they were glad that I didn't have to stay and we were glad that I didn't have to\nstay for different reasons. I also want to mention a cousin of mine, he was actually the\nson of the couple where we stayed in that apartment in the Jew house. He was several\nyears older than I, he was by that time, I would guess, in his mid or late 30's, I was just 20\nor 21 then, and he lived with his girlfriend, Bella Ritter. His name was Albert Marck.\nAnd Bella Ritter's husband had already been arrested and had been for years in a\nconcentration camp and she lived now with my cousin and they decided to go\nunderground in Bavaria and he told me that before they left, that he considered Berlin too\ndangerous. Of course he had lived there much longer also as an adult, and they had\nfigured out a way, apparently, that they thought was foolproof. And that was that he had\nsome medical sort of statements from doctors that he was suffering from some lung\ndisease which required his recuperation in the country. And then he had some ID, I\nguess, on the name that matched it and so did his woman friend. And we decided we\nwanted to keep in touch, of course, and that was a big problem because he was planning\nsort of to move around from different sanatoriums, and I didn't want to give anyone my\naddress. So the solution was that is something that can be done in Germany, I don't know\nwhether that exists here, you can address a letter to somebody under a code name at\ngeneral delivery at a given post office. I still remember my code was the letter F like in\nFontheim, 58, F58 and at a particular post office in Berlin. I mean that was also a risky\nthing because if somehow he had been found by the Gestapo with such a letter, they\ncould have waited for me there, but I guess one did all kinds of stupid things. So\nanyway, we corresponded in that way and then one day the correspondence stopped and\nthen I got a letter from Bella, his friend, that something happened to him and he is very\nsick and she is returning to Berlin alone. So that immediately told me that he was\narrested. It was a big tragedy actually because what happened she told, we met in Berlin\nand she told me that he, apparently there were some questions raised at the place where\nthey were staying, but they were still able to get away, but they left all of their assets, I\nmean that they had to carry with them always, certain valuables, I don't know what they\nwere, but what they needed to sustain their life. And he said he had to go back quickly to\nretrieve these things and she had warned him and tried to keep him from doing it. His\npoint was that without the assets, how can they even continue living and she felt\nsomehow they will make it. Anyway, the result was that he went back and never\nreturned. So obviously he walked into a trap there. So she was now alone in Berlin. We\nkept in touch. We saw each other periodically and when the time came that, she\nmentioned to me several times that she had a very good friend who is a jeweler and I\nneeded some money from that furrier where I had converted all of the money into that\nladies evening handbag and so I wanted to sell it. And she said that man gives very good\nprices and so on. Anyway my first intent was not even to sell it immediately, but just to\nget it appraised. So I gave the handbag to her and we were then agreed to meet the next\nday and she would bring the handbag back and the appraisal price from her jeweler\nfriend. Well, guess what, she never appeared there. I couldn't believe that she would\ncheat me out of that handbag, I mean that was just incredible. And as I found out shortly\nthereafter, she didn't. The problem was Stella Goldschlag. It turned out that Stella\nactually transferred from Siemens where she worked and where I had met her to a\ndifferent factory for some reason and at that factory Bella had worked, so they knew each\nother. And apparently, Bella must have run into Stella and got snatched away and she\nwas arrested, transported to Auschwitz and never came back.",
        "A: Totally. I mean, as absurd as it may sound, but that's what I expected from the\nGestapo to do, if they arrest me that they would deport me. But for a Jew to do that, to\nturn on other Jews that was such an unbelievable act of betrayal that, I mean it just, I\nmean if you ask any Jew who lived underground in Berlin, whether they knew her or not,\nshe was, everybody knew her by name at least, there is not one that I can think of who\nwould excuse her or even say that she should have gotten anything less than execution\nafter the war. I mean, she just didn't deserve to live, her life is based on the lives of\nhundreds of people who are not alive anymore because of her. I mean, to think of 1t even\nnow still drives me crazy that she is alive and she has apparently a pleasant life and has\nsome sort of a government pension. Yeah, one thing, I have to back up a little bit, on the\n27th of February, 1943, that was just about a little bit less than a month after we went\nunderground, remember we went underground on the 30th of January, '43. On the 27th\nof February, the SS made a general sweep of all factories which employed Jews under\nextremely brutal conditions. The 27th of February, of course, was a winter day and it\nwas a cold day, the Gestapo simply collected the Jews without giving them the\nopportunity to go back to their dressing rooms to pick up their outerwear, coats or\nwhatever they had, they were just like that taken to various transit camps that had been\nreadied for that because the regular transit camp, obviously, wouldn't have taken the\nthousands and thousands of people. And then they were shipped out in a series of\ntransports in the first week of March, 1943. After that, Berlin was essentially\n\"judenrein\". It's a tragedy because, I mean it's a tragedy for everyone, but I also have to\nthink back again at my good friend, Hans Fabisch, who had hoped that he was safe\nworking in a factory. Well, he himself wasn't safe anyway, but even if he would not have\nbeen arrested on that day, it was the 18th of January, '43, he would have been arrested a\nlittle bit later and without announcement. None of these people knew it and, incidentally,\nStella Goldschlag, in that factory, she was smart enough when the Jews were herded\ndown, apparently nobody thought of sort of bringing up the rear and she stayed back, she\nworked there, by the way, with her mother, she and her mother stayed back and walked\nslower and then ducked into one of the ladies restrooms and then left at the end of the\nshift, at the end of the day when thousands of workers sort of streamed out of the factory\ngate and that way they escaped being deported on that day. And then they went\nunderground and then sometime later, she was caught, actually by another catcher for the\nGestapo.",
        "A: That is all explained, a book was written about her. I mean, she wasn't caught, I mean\nshe voluntarily went to the Jewish community to get papers as a victim of fascism and to\ntake advantage of, you know, many of the sort of restitution measures that were then\ntaken or given to the Jews. And she, I mean that was an unbelievable act of naivet\u00e9, how\nshe could have thought to get away with it. I ought to say one other thing, you know\nthere were Jews also during the years when Jews were deported and picked up, there\nwere Jews who picked up other Jews, like my parents were picked up by Jews, that can't\nbe compared to what Stella did. Because these Jews picked up Jews who were not in\nhiding, who were basically, you might say, at the disposal of the Gestapo, I mean the\nGestapo knew where they were and they could have picked them up. It is true those Jews\nmade life easier for the Gestapo, but nobody believes that the Gestapo would have given\nup the Holocaust or the murdering of the German Jews even, if these Jewish orderlies\nwould have refused the pickup. I know that quite a number of authors, even Raul Hilberg\nand particularly Hannah Arendt, have criticized very strongly the collaboration by Jews\nin the deportation process, and not only in Berlin, but in the Eastern ghettos and in other\nplaces. However, I think each case has to be judged individually and many of these\norderlies were simply not given any choice. They had a tragic task to fulfill. Similar, in\nfact, you can compare it to the so-called \"Sonderkommandos\", or special commandos, in\nthe concentration camp. These were the Jews who serviced the gas chambers and the\ncrematoria and extracted gold teeth from the corpses and so on. They could have refused\nand would have been shot probably, and the Gestapo still would have, or the SS over\nthere, would have obtained everything they wanted to obtain. In the case of Stella, these\nwere people who otherwise in all likelihood, would have survived the war. So it is a\ntotally different thing and I want in the strongest terms, in moral terms, to make a strong\ndifference between her actions and the actions of the orderlies who had that tragic task to\npick up Jews for deportation.\nBeginning Tape Six, Side A",
        "Answer: Well, my name is, my full name is Ernest Gundolf Fontheim. I was born on October 23,\n1922, in Berlin, Germany. I might add that my father was a lawyer, he was born in 1881, so he\nwas already over 40 years old when I was born and he was one of the best known lawyers in\nBerlin. And I grew up in a -- very comfortably and in a very assimilated home, assimilated to\nGerman culture and with very little awareness of my Judaism.",
        "A: Yeah. I would -- I would like to say that the transition from -- to the life underground,\nunderground meaning simply with forged papers and under a different identity, meant of course\nfor me also, a radical transition in family. My parents had just been arrested and deported and\nnow I am living -- I was living with a completely different family and the family atmosphere was\ntotally different. While my parents were both actually highly educated and very intellectual, the\nfamily of Margaret and her parents, family Haas, were on the other hand -- I mean Mr. Haas was\na -- a tailor and designer of women's clothes and -- and actually had owned a factory be -- until\nthe Nazis took it away from him. He was a man who was much more folksy than my parents, had\na tremendous sense of humor and was a very warm person. And of course there were frictions\nnow and then. I guess that is always unavoidable, but in -- in general, I felt comfortable and of\ncourse also grateful that I was accepted, practically as a family member by this new family. Also,\nanother big difference was the age difference. As I said, my father was actually quite old and for\na boy of my age -- I mean, my mother was 10 years younger than he, but Margaret's parents\nwere, they were both of the same age, 20 years younger than my father and 10 years younger\nthan my mother and I think that also made a difference in -- in the relationship.",
        "A: In -- in, to some extent, in terms of rapport and then also in -- in terms of how they took life. I\nmean also, I have to say that my fa -- my parents had gone through unbelievable agony, I mean\nstarting in 1933. Probably to some extent, they took it much harder. They surely lost much more,\nbecause they had more to lose. They were, in those 10 years, starting in 1933, they were robbed\nof all of their possessions, everything that my father had worked for and also their social\nstanding and everything had been taken away from them. And by the time that the deportation\nstarted, they were totally devastated and -- and the atmosphere therefore at home, also was\nalways -- ho-how can I describe it? I mean morbid, maybe and -- and -- and just extremely ne-\nnegative. While, in -- in spite of all the hardships, Margaret's parents, first of all because they\nwere younger and secondly because, I guess, they didn't go quite through the same amount of\ntremendous radical turmoil and change, had retained their sense of humor and also their, sort of\nsome sense of ad-adventurism and -- and so on. And I-I-I think to that extent, I-I felt comfortable\nthere, in spite of the fact that the lot of my parents and my sister continued to be a -- a\ntremendous weight, I mean I-I -- by that time of course, I always hoped that they'll be in some\ncamp and -- which will be liberated at some point in the future.",
        "A: Well, funner -- well yeah, I mean to some extent that is also true, we -- for example, we -- we\nhad brought along a -- a phonograph player, we played records, both classical as well as dance\nmusic. I didn't know how to dance and so Margaret, who was an excellent or is still -- is an\nexcellent dancer, taught me how to dance and -- and -- and yeah, as I said, ther-there was a\ncertain amount of -- of -- of -- of humor and -- and -- and also light-heartedness. And of course,\nthat went together with the fact that I and none of us, in fact, was wearing the yellow star any\nmore, which made us outcasts. We felt sort of, at least I felt liberated by that and I mean all of\nthat contributed to a -- to a -- a more positive mental outlook. In addition, I want to say that we\ntried to keep as much as possible, the Jewish holidays. I don't remember any more, how we even\nknew the dates, we surely didn't have any Jewish calendars, there were none printed in Germany.\nBut we did know, for example, when Yom Kippur was and we fasted on it. We did know when\nPesach, the date was and we even kept the ornamental Seder. Margaret's father, who was in\ngeneral an excellent cook and -- and baker, baked some approximation of a matzo, which we ate\nand of course we didn't even have a Haggadah, but we talked about the exodus from Egypt, just\nfrom out of our memory. I did have a handwritten copy of the Kiddush and so every Friday\nevening, we lit candles and made Kiddush. If we didn't have wine, we used some other liquid,\nwhatever came handy, even if it had to be water. And -- and if we didn't have two candles, we\ncu-cut one candle into two. And I derived a lot of strength, I think from the -- the fact, I mean, of\nthe Jewish religion and that was actually one important pillar of -- of strength I had. Looking\nback, there were three pillars of strength. One was my Judaism, the second was my unshakable\ntrust in the future. I had almost certainty that Germany would lose the war, even at a time when\nGermany was -- still seemed to be winning. And in fact I had taken along some books. I had\nalready decided to study physics later. I took a book for self teaching of calculus along, which I\nworked through from cover to cover in those years. And I had a physics book, which I studied.\nEvery week I located some time to do that. And -- and in addition to that, by the way, we -- there\nwas in -- in a local, bigger town, there was a public library, which we joined, of course, under\nour assumed names and so we checked books out, novels and other things and -- and I already\nsaid that we played music, so we -- we tried to maintain as normal an atmosphere a-as possible.\nSo -- and -- and incidentally, I -- and in fact, none of the four of us ever had the intention, after\nthe end of the war, to stay one day longer in Germany than absolutely necessary and we had, at\nthat time already, always dreamt about coming to America. That was sort of a dream, like --\nalmost like a castle in the sky. And so it -- it was the Judaism and my trust in the future are the\ntwo. The third pillar of strength was actually Margaret, as I had indicated earlier, I had at one\ntime, in -- in the -- during -- while we -- while we were still working at the factory at Zeemens,\nstarted to fall in love with Margot, only to hear that she had a -- a -- a steady boyfriend, but by\nthat time, I-I-I forgot what happened to the boyfriend, I think he also went underground, actually\nand anyway, he -- he was not available and there was no contact and so my interest in Margot\nwas of course rekindled and at that time, finally, 1t was reciprocated. And -- and actually she was\nthe person really closest to me and -- who gave me much of the inner strength also. She was sort\nof the third leg in that -- what -- what kept me going, emotionally I mean, mentally going. I\nshould also say that, one thing that I was not aware of at that time, but that -- was the arrest of\nmy friend Huntz, which I had mentioned earlier. All people that I had known in my earlier life,\nwere gone. Some of them of course had emigrated, the rest had been deported. There was\nnobody from my immediate family, my first girlfriend, school friends, factory friends, you name\nit. Relatives, there was nobody. I-I was totally alone in the world and the funny thing is, or the\nstrange thing is that I was totally unaware of it at that time. It occurred only years after the end of\nthe war, when I sort of went through my memory, it occurred to me that's what actually was the\ncase. And -- and she was the only one who was close to me and who -- who, as I said, who\nsustained me. Then I-I had talked about the primitive nature of the house we lived in, that --\nhouse is probably a -- a euphemism, maybe a cottage or a hut. I had mentioned the pump in the\ngarden, what I didn't say is, people might assume it was an electric pump, it wasn't, 1t was a\nhand pump and you had to work very hard to get water up, pumping it and as I also mentioned,\nin -- in winter sometimes it froze. The hut itself was built of wooden boards with -- with fairly\nwide slits of what I would say an eighth of an inch or so and that made it, obviously, very\nuncomfortable in winter. Through our Nazi friend, whom I had also mentioned before, we had --\nwe made contact to people where one could get building material. Building material of course,\nwere severely rationed and practically impossible to get and we got sort of insulation plates and\neve-even nails were hard to get and so we co-completely insulated the house from the inside with\nsort of, some plastic type material. I don't know what it is any more. And -- and we got all that\nmaterial really, through his connections. Then one day during our stay there, suddenly the local\nvillage policeman came and fortunately while I was out of the house. I was probably in Berlin\nand he said he wanted to find out who was living there and asked Margaret's father all kinds of\nquestions, where he worked and he wanted to see the ID, which he showed him and -- and where\neverybody else worked and whatever other questions. And then -- and he was fairly -- he wasn't\noutright unfriendly, but -- but very business-like, which is in -- in -- in a rural setting in that\nvillage is really unusual. People were sort of more like a family there. And at the end he said,\n\u201cWell, I hear there's a young man living here also.\u201d And then Mr. Haas said, \u201cYes, that's my\nnephew and his name so and so, Gunther Hessem,\u201d that was my assumed false name. And the\npoliceman then said, \u201cWell, I want to ask him some questions. When --\u201d Yeah, and he was also\ntold that I'm working in a factory and then he asked when I am home and he was told I'll be back\non -- on the weekend and he said then, \u201cWell, tell him I'll be here next Saturday,\u201d I forgot,\nprobably 10 or whatever in the morning, \u201cand I want to ask him some questions.\u201d And -- and\nthen he left and -- and we felt very threatened by that and -- and of course I was the most\nvulnerable because I was of military age and I did not have, as I explained earlier, the complete\nset of required papers, so Margaret's father went immediately to our Nazi district leader friend\nand complained bitterly about it, said that the village policeman, I remember his name, even. His\nname was Mueller, good German name, had come and -- and interrogated him, almost like a\ncriminal and he felt very indignant. After all, he is an honest, honorable citizen and so on. And\nHarry, the -- the Nazi's name, said, \u201cOh, don't worry about it Herman, he is a good friend of\nmine, I'll take care of it.\u201d And a few days later, Harry came, paid us a visit and said, \u201cMueller\nisn't going to come any more here. I had a beer with him yesterday at the village pub and I told\nhim that you guys are good friends of mine and I've known you for years and you're honest,\nhonorable people and there was no reason to.\u201d And we never saw Mueller again. So, unwittingly,\nthe guy po-possibly might have saved our lives. I had once a close brush with arrest in Berlin. As\nI mentioned, also earlier, the trips to Berlin were necessary to keep up with our black market\ncontacts and -- and to get food. And I should say also, by the way, that most of the food was\nobtained by Margaret's father and his wife, they had of course many more contacts. They had\nlived longer, they knew more people and -- but I had a number of people also, that I visited\nusually once a week, sometimes twice a week. So, and I was always extremely careful. I think I\nmentioned some of the strategies already that I used to avoid detection. And when I was riding in\nthe subway, I always rode -- sat on -- on the bench, sort of midway between the doors, which are\n-- were on either end. So -- and -- and watching the people who would enter and if somebody\nwould enter whom I suspected or even knew, on the door to the right, I would get up and leave to\nthe left. Not that 1t ever came, but at least that was my strategy. Well, on -- on that particular day,\nit was rush hour and I entered the train at the Wittenburg Platz station, in Witten, in the part of --\nthe busiest part of the western Berlin business district and since it was rush hour, the train was\npacked with people, of course and I never got to the center, I just was sort of next to the entrance\ndoor where I entered, sort of squeezed in between people. And as I stood there, as the train\nrumbled and rumbled along -- and incidentally, after Wittenburg Platz, the train emerged from a\ntunnel and became then an elevator train. I saw a chubby, short man next to me, say thank you to\na soldier who was also standing next to him, handing back his ID, and I immediately knew that\nwas a -- some sort of a secret policeman. And by that time it was obviously first of all, I couldn't\nget out of the train and if I would have made one move, that would have even arranged --\naroused suspicion. So I just looked into the air, trying to look as harmless and innocent as I\ncould, but the guy sort of swung around and fixated me with his eyes and said, \u201cYour papers,\nplease.\u201d And he made me very ma -- nervous. I had been controlled, I must say, several times\nbefore and usually it went very -- people looked at my ID and I greeted them with a snappy Heil\nHitler and that -- that's the job. Well, he looked at my ID and I -- the more he looked, the more I\nnoticed he must have been a real professional. He -- he looked back between me and the picture,\nand it was of course my picture. Then he tried to lift the picture up to see how it was fastened to\nthe material of the ID and asked me one or two questions and I got so unbelievably nervous that I\nnoticed that my artery in my neck started really to pump very hard and that was something that I\ncouldn't control, but he must have noticed that. And -- and because he -- he constantly gave me\nsharp looks and then I was already expected to be arrested or at least taken along for further\ninterrogation. Instead he handed me the paper back and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d And I had the distinct\nfeeling that guy wasn't satisfied and the reason why he didn't arrest me is he had decided it might\nbe smarter to follow me, because I might lead him somewhere, where he could get maybe a\nbigger catch, or something. So -- a-and at the next stop, which then, as I said was an elevated\nstop, Nolendorf Platz, he left the tra -- he left the car. And I decided immediately, that guy didn't\nleave. There are two possibilities. Either he had another man with him, whom I didn't know who\nit was, whom he might give him -- have given some wink to follow me, or he would just have\ngone to the next car and wait where I would leave. So I quickly, in my mind, made a plan of how\nto shake off either him, or somebody whom I may not even know. And the next stop was\nBuellerstrasser, was one of the busiest intersections in -- in Berlin. Buellerstrasser, corner\nPutstamastrasser. And I-I left the car then and walked down and the stairs from the elevated\nended in a median strip between the two lanes of traffic, you know, going one way and one side\nand the opposite way in the other side. And at the bottom of the stairs, I-I knew the area like my\nown pockets. At the bottom of the stairs was a newspaper kiosk. So my plan was, and that's what\nI did, I stopped at the newspaper kiosk and pretended t-to read newspapers and headlines and so\non, while out of my -- the corner of my right eye, I peered up, who was coming down the stairs\nand I figured that if so -- if somebody whom I didn't know was going to follow me, that person\nwould sort of linger around and I could sort of make out who it was. Was the guy himself, of\ncourse I would know and lo and behold, I had hardly stopped and started looking at the\nnewspaper, when I saw that guy come down. So he obviously did what I had suspected. He was\nin another car and waited for me to leave. So I ignored him and just kept reading the newspapers\nand that was probably not part of his plan. Because he had to follow me surreptitiously and if he\nhad lingered around there, I would have been aware of it. So he didn't He stayed, I don't know,\nmaybe 10, 20 seconds or so and then he crossed over to one side and that was exactly what I had\nanticipated. I should say also, there was a traffic light at that corner of Buellerstrasser and\nPutstamastrasser. So, once he crossed over to one side, I waited for the light to be such that\ntraffic was going and then I made my way, sprinted between cars, to the opposite side, so that\nthere were now two lanes of moving traffic between him and me. And then I walked along, not\nto -- to the busy street, which was Putstamastrasser, but to the next block, which was a -- sort of\na residential street, with very few people only walking there. And -- but I-I -- in order not to\narouse suspicion, I didn't run, I just walked briskly, the way one walks purposefully in a city, if\none goes after some appointment or so. And as soon as I had turned the corner, I raced as fast as\nI could and it was about 100 meter dash to the next corner and there I looked around and I saw\nthat guy come around also, following me. Then I-I walked, I-I turned again the corner and came\nback at a different block of Putstamastrasser, see that busy street, jumped on a moving trolley\ncar. In those days, trolley cars had rear platforms, without a door, so you could, just by grabbing\nthe handlebars and jumping on, you could even jump o-on a -- a car, while it was -- they -- they -\n- they didn't go very fast. While it was in the middle of -- of riding, driving. And -- in this way I\nshook that guy off. I am still convinced that -- that he had some suspicion, that he was not -- my\npaper was not that perfect. I should also say that, over the -- by that time, though, we are into\n1944 and many of my friends and acquaintances, who had gone underground, or had -- one after\nanother had been caught by the Gestapo. I mentioned that cousin of mine, who had gone to\nBavaria and -- and his girlfriend. There were various schoolmates from my high school class\nwho got caught. Then that other friend, Galcoun, who wasn't caught, but who was murdered.\nAnd -- and of course that -- that had an effect on -- on our, you know, mental outlook obviously\nand -- but I guess there's a -- there's a German saying which sounds very cruel, but it was really\nthe case in our case, it's veba graba forwards, it means, \u201cYou walk forward over graves.\u201d And\nthat's -- that was all the time what happened to us. We -- we lost a tremendous number of friends.\nSome of them came back, but most did not. During that period of time, of course, also the\nmilitary situation changed more and more against Germany and that gave us a tremendous\nmorale boost. I mean, by that time, in the 1943, Italy had already capitulated and -- and then in\nearly '44, there were continuous rumors of a landing of the Allied Forces, somewhere in France.\nAnd that happened finally, on June 6, 1944. I still remember the -- the day distinctly. Of course\nwe didn't have any radio in our hut, so we didn't know anything, but Margaret's parents were in\nthe city, in Berlin on that day, on -- on their various errands to contact black market sources. And\nthey had bought extra editions of newspapers, so when they arrived out, 1n -- in -- in -- 1n our\nhouse, in our cottage in -- in the evening, they came with the news that the Allied had landed in\nthe Normandy and for Margaret, that was such a shock of joy that she broke out into tears. I-I-I\nnever forget that. And -- and we were just unbelievably happy. Of course, a-as the Allies then\ncontinued to make progress, and yeah, I should say also, incidentally, on the eastern front, the\nsuccesses were tremendous. Even before that, in -- in 1943, I think the biggest attack battle of all\ntime took place in the area of Koosk and Orwell, in the western Soviet Union and where\nGermany suffered a decisive defeat. And by that time, by 1944, when the allies landed in the --\nthe western allies landed in the Normandy, the Russians had already taken Warsaw and from\nboth sides, the allies were approaching finally, German territory. And, so one response of the\nNazi's was to create a new unit called folkshdum, best translated as \u201cmilitia.\u201d And all Germans\nwho were not -- all German males, I should say, between 16 and 60, who were not in the armed\nforces, were immediately conscripted into that folkshdum. And the conscription, since they didn't\nwant to create a new bureaucracy, was -- the task of conscription was given to the Nazi party\norganization, which was already an existing organization with offices and so on. And -- but now\nit became necessary to have ideas, because if you're not in the Vairmarkt, in the armed forces or\nany of its branches, you had to be in the folkshdum. It's was either one or the other. So\nfortunately, Margaret's father had a -- a colleague from earlier days, also a Jewish colleague, I\nmean, from the garment line, who was underground and he had access to blank ID's f-for the\nfolkshdum. And -- but what he couldn't supply was the -- the -- the rubber stamp, it -- 1t was\nstamped by the Nazi party district, in which one was mustered in-into the folkshdum. And then I\nremembered that I knew a stamp maker. So I went to -- and -- and he knew me only, also under\nmy forged, I mean assumed name, not who I really was. And of course for stamp makers it was\nstrictly forbidden to make official stamps because they can be used then for all kinds of purposes\n-- illegal purposes. So I went to him and told him a long story, the story basically was that my\nuncle was working in a local party district, registering folkshdum members and that in the -- in\nthe crush and the busy work there, somehow the stamp got lost. He thinks it may have fallen off\nthe table into a wastebasket and then empty out, but -- but he simply didn't know what happened\nto it and he reported it immediately to the local -- to his boss, the district leader and the district\nleader was very unhappy about that and said if that got into the wrong hands, you know,\nanything can be done with forgeries and he holds him personally responsible, he better look\nwithin two days, if he doesn't -- if he has not found the stamp, then he has to face consequences.\nSo -- a-and of course the consequences in those days usually were that the party would fire him\nand then he would be immediately subject to military induction and be shipped to the eastern\nfront. And so I told that stamp maker, then finally said I would like to have that stamp within a\nday. I -- I can give him, first of all, the actual cost, whatever it is. In addition to that, 300\ncigarettes, 100 immediately and 200 when I get the stamp. And in those days, cigarettes were --\nwere almost worth their weight in gold. And so the guy agreed. I had the stamp within -- less\nthan two -- two days. And then Margaret's father went back to his friend and they made a deal\nthat he would give us, free of charge, two of folkshdum membership blanks and we in turn\nwould stamp his own with the party stamp that we had, also free of charge for itwasa. And so --\nso that's what happened and of course, women didn't need a -- an ID as I said, because only\nmales were inducted into the folkshdum militia. So -- so we had, in fact I still have my\nfolkshdum ID. And -- and to have that ID was actually terrific because that obviated the need for\nany military papers, because only people who were not in the armed forces were inducted into\nthe folkshdum. And since -- and the party, of course, had all of that background material. So, by\nbeing in the folkshdum, that automatically implied that the military status of that person was\nokay, whatever it was. And -- and also, of course, as the situation became more desperate for the\nNazis, there were more and more ID checks on the streets, I mean they were looking first of all\nfor German deserters. They were looking for allied spies, they were looking for -- you know they\nhad millions of foreign workers in Germany also, they had been forcibly deported to work in the\narmaments industry. And many of those were on the loose, they just ran away. So, anyway, the\nthing was that having that paper, I'm sure saved my life, because I was then frequently\ncontrolled, particularly by military police. Now, on the other hand, as the situation worsened, it\nalso became more and more difficult to get food. I-I-I should say where -- what with black\nmarket food prices, I believe I mistakenly said in an earlier interview here, that the black market\nprices were 10 times regular prices. That -- I have to take that back, it-it's closer to 100 times. In\nother words, any, say pound of meat or whatever, was -- which whose price may have been one\nmark regularly bought in a store with food ration stamps, would be 100 mark on the black\nmarket. But, because of increasing shortages, because Germany of course, used to get a lot of its\nfood from the occupied areas and they were no longer occupying them, obviously the scarcity\ngrew higher and as the supply dwindled and the demand either stayed the same or increased,\nobviously the price increased. So, just at that point, that problem was solved for us. What\nhappened was -- was that on a d -- on one day, I was also in Berlin, using the -- the subway and\nas I sat there, a girl -- I mean young woman actually, a year or two older than I, whom I had\nknown from before, in fact she was a counselor in a vacation camp that I went to 1n the 1930's, in\nthe mid '30's and then later I met her again at Zeemans, where she was also a forced laborer. And\nshe approached me and said, \u201cOh hi, how are you,\u201d and that, \u201cI'm so happy to see you.\u201d But\nsince one didn't trust anyone whom one hadn't seen continuously, I said, \u201cWell, my name isn't\nFontheim.\u201d And -- and then she said, \u201cWell, don't you have a smaller sister?\u201d I said, \u201cNo,\u201d and I\ngave her some fictitious name, say like my name 1s Irige Billow and I only have an older brother.\nAnd she sort of left the train puzzled. And -- and at that point I decided she 1s obviously not\nworking for the Gestapo because she wouldn't be put off by such a rude, crude lie. Okay, but\nanyway, about a week or two later, I ran into her again on the same sort of line of the subway\nwhere I met her the first time and then I admitted that -- that her memory was really correct and\nthen she said, \u201cOh, that's marvelous,\u201d and \u201clet's sit down at a cafe and -- and then have a little\ntalk.\u201d And I said, \u201cThat's a great idea, but I don't have any food ration coupons\u201d And in\nrestaurants and cafes, you also had to pay, obviously, the price in mark, but in addition, which\nwas much more important, give the food coupons, equivalent for whatever you were ordering,\nwhat -- even if it was just a piece of cake. And she said, \u201cOch, d-d-don't bother, I invite you.\u201d So\nokay, so since I was always hungry, I fo -- I accepted the invitation, so we sat down in a cafe and\ntalked. Of course I have to say that I didn't tell her a thing, where I was actually living, we were\njust talking sort of in general terms and -- and then she said -- yeah, I mean I-I asked her whether\nI couldn't pay for the stamps, coupons that she used on me, she said no, she didn't pay for hers\neither and in fact she'll show me how to get them free of charge and all one had to do is find out\nwhere the last air raid -- there were daily air raids now. Where the last air raid was centered at.\nAnd that was easy, that spread through Berlin like fire, the news, you know, last night this\ndistrict was hit or that district. So we went to where last night --",
        "A: Oh, where last night the -- the allies had bombed, and looked up a house that was destroyed.\nEnd of Tape Six, Side A\nBeginning Tape Six, Side B",
        "A: So we arrived at the part of town where last night's air raid had done the most of the damage\nand then my friend -- her name by the way is Ursula, she said, \u201c\u201cWhat we need to do 1s first of all,\nwrite down the address of a house that's completely destroyed, or at least remember and note it\ndown.\u201d So, that's what we did. And then the German, sort of air raid support system was, by\nyears of experience, of course very well organized. Each house had -- I mean the -- the -- the\npeople who lived in -- in each house knew exactly where to go if that house became destroyed. It\nwas usually a public -- usually a school nearby, sometimes a church or some such public\nbuilding. So -- and that was posted also in the -- near the building. So we -- after noting the\naddress of the place, of the house that was destroyed -- of course that was just one of many\nhouses, and also discovering where to go for further support, we went there and of course that\nwas a school, I remember and it was in the main auditorium and the place was mobbed with\npeople who had been bombed out the previous night. Some with some of their belongings still\nsaved and others with nothing. And there were -- and the place was run again by a subsidiary of\nthe Nazi party organization. And -- and then I-I stuck with her and we -- first of all registered at a\ndesk where a man in full Nazi party regalia was sitting. And she would give some fictitious name\nand that address and saying that she lost all of her belongings, including even her papers. And so\nthey immediately did two things. They gave a person a temporary ID, identifying that person as a\nbombed out person and also asking then all agencies of the government to sort of give any\nsupport possible. And for people who had lost their food ration cards, they -- oh no, wait a\nminute. I-I'm sorry, I take that back. They did not hand out any food ration. They simply noted\ndown the -- listed the person as totally bombed out and then they supplied people with\nsandwiches and cigarettes and if they needed, also an overnight, a simple cot, although people\nwere urged, if possible, to move in with friends or relatives, but those who didn't have either,\ncould also stay overnight there. So, of course I followed her example, gave a differ -- I did not\ngive my name that I had adopted on my papers, I didn't want that to appear there. So I chose just\nsome arbitrary name that came to my mind, but the same address and I also got an ID,\nidentifying me as bombed out. Now the point was, with that ID, one could go then to any food\nrationing office and get a set of food ration cards. And the idea of course was, you couldn't do it\nin the same district where the building was located because they had, of course, a complete card\ncatalog of people who were living in that district and -- and of course neither one of these people\neven existed. But with the bombed out ID, one -- any other food ration office -- suppose one\nmoved to a different part of Berlin than was required to hand out a -- a set of food ration cards.\nAnd of course, in another district, they wouldn't have the set of -- of you know, registered people\nliving in that district. Comes to my mind, I'm glad that the tech -- to -- that today's technology\ndidn't exist in those days, because today all they would have to do is, on a computer, access a\ndatabase and look up anyone from any other di-district. But fortunately the Nazis didn't have that\ncapability yet, otherwise they would have used it. So what we did is we took them -- the subway\nto a different part of Berlin. Went there, got our set of food ration cards and then took off. And\nthat was now the first set and I enjoyed that game so much, I-I should add also, by the way, that\nthe sandwiches they handed out were terrific. I had not had such good sa-salami sandwiches in --\nin years, in fact. And that alone was even worth it. So I start practically every time when I was in\nBerlin, since there were daily air raids, there was -- there were every -- every day there were\nhouses destroyed the preceding night, so all one had to do was sort of ask and find out in what\npart of the city, to go there, look up an address of a destroyed, I mean house from the -- from last\nnight and then go to the local sort of air raid support facility, where people were helped with\ntheir fi-first needs and so on, get another ID. And -- and so I kept doing that and finally at the\nheight of the thing, I got -- I-- I got food ration stamps for 16 people, without paying a penny for\nit. So we could just go into stores and -- and buy food at the regular price-controlled prices,\nwhich was peanuts. And -- and that obviously was a tremendous help also in our -- our, you\nknow, for our budget.",
        "A: Yeah, I mean -- I-I am sure that these card officers, foo-food coupon officers where I went\nunder an assumed name then would forward my name and -- and this address that I gave to the\nfood office in that district and then within days they would find out that person never existed\nthere, and -- but by that time I was gone and when you -- the food ration coupons themselves\ndidn't have a name of a person on it. So you could -- you didn't have to be afraid that they knew\nalready that this was, the whole thing was a fake. I mean, I-I could use the stamps without being\nafraid to be identified. It was a marvelous thing. And yeah, also of course, the continuous air\nraids -- by the way, the air raids started I should say, really to become severe and shortly after we\nmoved there, I think I discussed that even, that helped us in -- in -- in our fictitious story that we\ntold people. And of course it got worse as the war went on and usually it was the British bomber\nfleet coming at night and the Americans during daytime. And it was sometimes an awful --\nawesome, not awful -- an awesome sight during daytime. The Americans were flying in like on a\nsort of military exercise, in -- in close formation. And the roar of the bombers -- there were\nhundreds usually, filled the heavens. It was for us almost a shout of liberation. And -- and they\nwere just coming an-and you -- we could see the anti-aircraft guns, the German flock firing at\nthem without much effect. And -- and then when they start dropping their bombs, the bombs sort\nof had made a whistle sound as they fell down on the -- with tremendous speed. And -- and the\nwhistle sound then was followed by seconds of silence and then a tremendous explosion. And of\n-- of course there were hundreds of them. It -- it -- it was a -- an unbelievable experience and --\nand at night of course one couldn't see the bombers any more, but the noise was the same and --\nand then of course the flames that engulfed large parts of the city would almost be a -- a --\npresent a ghostly scene of -- of fire and destruction. And obviously that had also a tremendous\neffect on the population and people reacted differently, but by that time, it was obvious I think to\nmost sane people at least, that the war was lost. And if the war was lost, then all that destruction\nand all of the German soldiers who were still falling on all fronts, were just a total waste or a\nwasted loss, which wouldn't really do anything for Germany. And so many -- there was a lot of\ndissatisfaction ex-expressed with the government. But it was all sort of below the surface and the\nreason was, there was a tremendous government terror that increased. There wasn't just the\nGestapo, but I mean, the employed agents of the Gestapo, but there was a much larger army of\neither paid or unpaid informers, or people who are sometimes just out of spite, were informing\non others. And obviously that kept people in line and they would often grumble only between\ntheir four walls or to -- only to people whom they definitely knew to be okay and safe. But there\nwas increasing dissatisfaction as the war came closer to the German borders and the -- the\nGerman government -- and particularly the propaganda machine of Goebbels, had another\nweapon given to them and -- and that was actually by the Russians. The -- while it is\nunderstandable that the Russians, who had suffered unbelievably under German occupation were\nnot very kindly disposed towards the Germans, but the -- the atrocities committed by the\nRussians and the -- the totally wanton destruction in the wake of the Soviet army, was such that\nGoebbels was able to whip up enthusiasm for continuing the fight by basically threatening the\nGermans with the Russians. And of course the worst part of the terror probably were the\nunbelievable rapes. I-I must admit that I did not believe the stories at first and thought they were\njust an outgrowth of Goebbels propaganda, I mean in the same way how the antisemitic press,\nfor years had smeared the Jews with all kinds of sexual innuendoes and so on, which were just\ninventions. But it turns out, I mean the Russians -- incidentally, the Russians did not only do that\nin Germany, I mean, even in areas that they liberated, countries that were supposed to be allies,\nlike Czechoslovakia, Poland, there were unbelievable rapes in those countries. And so it can't be\njust explained by the fact that there was an accumulated hatred against the Germans. But of\ncourse that contributed to it. But, be that as it may, they handed the Germans a tremendous\npropaganda weapon and -- and occasionally it would happen that the -- the German army would\nmake a counter-offensive and sort of re-occupy some locality which the Russians had already\ntaken before. And then they would immediately send in the entire press corps and -- and\ninterview people and they would get some sort of first hand horror stories of how the Russians\nbehaved. And I'm sure that was part of why th-the Germans put up resistance t-to the very end\nBut the -- the -- the fact is that resistance didn't give them any better results anyway and I would\nsay that any building that was destroyed and any German that was killed fighting in the latter\npart of '44 and '45 was just a waste. Of course not to forget that during that time also, hundreds\nof thousands, if not millions of Russians, still were killed and -- and also Jews were killed in the\nHolocaust, which continued unabated. I should say on that subject, incidentally, the fact that a\nholocaust was going on was totally unknown to us. We did occasionally -- we had opportunity to\nlisten to foreign broadcasts and incidentally, that was strictly forbidden and it was under death\npenalty that if anyone listened to a foreign radio broadcast. But sometimes we had the chance to\nand -- and -- and there were reports finally, mainly from BBC, the British radio, that the Nazis\nwere killing, at that time it was said, hundreds of thousands of Jews, and that -- while it filled us\nwith fear, it -- the number, hundreds of thousands, was so huge that it staggered our imagination.\nAnd that was not even 10 percent of the truth, but we didn't know it in -- at that time.",
        "A: Well, we definitely had heard of Auschwitz and -- because that was the -- that was the camp\nthat most Jews from Berlin were deported to. And -- at least in the later stages. In the beginning\nthere were also deportations to Riga and then other ghettos. But starting, I think about in the\nmiddle of 1942, maybe early fall of 1942, all deportations went to Auschwitz. Even that was not\nreally officially announced, but it somehow became known. So Auschwitz became known as a\ndestination for the deportations, but the term extermination camp was not known. I mean, what\nwas believed in general, that Jews were worked extremely hard under inhuman conditions and of\ncourse people die under such conditions also. But that they were sort of murdered in a mass\nproduction style, the way it was actually done, was not known to us. It may have now -- that -- I\nhave to add that German soldiers, hundreds of sol -- if not millions of them were in one way or\nanother witnesses of all of these exterminations. And -- and of course they, in -- in most cases\nwere too fearful to even report or -- or tell the -- or even told to keep that silent. But we were, I\nmean in -- in a certain amount of isolation there and -- and to some extent I have to say that it\nmay also have been simply that we, or at least I myself, I can really only talk of mys -- about\nmyself, simply refused to believe that, that it was so horrible and -- and all the people who were\nclose to me were involved in -- in these deportations. And -- and maybe to some extent I -- it was\nwishful thinking, that I did not believe in what really happened in those camps. But all I can say\nis that I hoped, til the victory and even after that, to see my family again.",
        "A: No, I mean, even in earlier times, it was -- somewhere I-I mentioned for example that after\nthe costan of Jewish males were arrested. They were all told that unless they wanted to come\nback there, to keep their mouth shut. And so people only whispered about it. Some didn't talk at\nall about it and some only to the closest friends or family members, what -- what really happened\nand these were not extermination camps, they were just sort of quote everyday brutalities\ncommitted by the SS.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, it was terrib -- the -- the horror was only at the impending loss of the war and what might\nbecome of Germany and of them personally. I-I didn't -- of course, as I said, people had to be\ncareful, but -- but the people that we associated with, and we had a certain social life there and --\nand as I had or said earlier, they -- the -- the cruelties against the Jews never even came up. Now\nthat's -- actually there's one exception. There was one family, an -- an elderly couple with a son\nwho Is -- was about six, seven years older than I and was an officer in the Vairmarkt. They were\npolitically 100 percent -- they often even talked to us and that surprised us because you know,\nthey -- they should have been somewhat mistrustful, but they ex -- op-openly expressed their\nopposition and their hatred of the Nazis and Hitler. They were -- one thing they were a very\ndevout Catholic family. And in northern Germany, where Berlin is located, the vast majority of\npeople of course, are Protestant. But I don't know whether that was the -- bu-but they were --\nthese people actually then, played a role in -- in our final survival. And that's a story I'm coming\nto now. In -- in March -- in March 1945, about six weeks before the end of the war, we heard\nthrough one of our friends that we sort of were socializing with, a very strange story. He -- he\nmet Mr. Haas, Margaret's father, and said he has to tell him something very funny. A -- a\npensioner, who lived in our area, and who earned himself some additional money by working on\npeople's property and he worked also often on a property of our neighbor and he was known as a\nfanatical Nazi. And that pensioner had told him to be careful with us and stay away from us\nbecause there's something not okay. We -- he 1s convinced that we are either foreign spies or\nJews. And -- and then when that man said, you know, \u201cW-W-What makes you think so?\u201d The\nman said, \u201cWell, they have -- they have a -- a Berlin address, where Herman Hesser lives.\u201d And\nthere is actually a Herman Hesser living, he checked the phone book. But he decided to really\nlook into it himself. And so, he -- and being a pensioner, you know he had nothing better to do,\nhe took the subway and went to that address and actually rang the bell and there's indeed a\nHerman Hesser living at that place, but it's a completely different person. And we simply used\nthat person's name to legitimize ourselves. And he told that fellow to -- to be careful and not to\nsay anything to us of stay -- and that guy again -- he was also, by the way, secretly very much\nagainst the Nazis and made commensur. And he interpreted it as saying that now that the war is\nobviously lost, that fanatical Nazi is sort of becoming -- going out of his mind, losing his mind.\nAnd didn't take it seriously, in fact found it really funny. And well, Margaret's father came back\nto us, he didn't find it funny at all, nor did we. And we were thinking about what to do now. Now\nwe knew that that guy probably would, within a day or two, notify the police, if he hadn't already\ndone so. And that we had to get out of there. And in fact we -- we had to get out sort of\nseemingly just as if we go into the city. In other words, without luggage, in order not to arouse\nsuspicion. But we had all of our per-personal belongings there and many of them were also\nnecessary for survival. I mean we, in those days it was practically impossible to buy anything,\ncloth -- gloves, clothing, anything you need. Shoes and so on. So we -- and of course also we\ndidn't really know where to go. So our first reaction was to talk to that elderly couple that I just\nmentioned, and their son -- he was a first lieutenant in the German army, was actually home\nduring that week, on furlough. I think he -- he had some sort of a sick leave, he had a slight\ninjury. And -- and we knew that all of them are totally okay, so the plan was that I -- but we\nwanted to talk to the son alone first. So I went over and asked the son, we would like to have a\ncard game with him, he sometimes played cards. And -- and he said, \u201cYeah, gladly,\u201d he'll be\nover in a few minutes. So in a few minutes he came and we both decided, among the four of us,\nthat the two women would stay in -- in the back room and Margaret's father and I and he would\nsort of play the game. So Margaret's father started out, I still feared -- to mix the -- the cards, to\ndistribute then -- the cards, to -- to play the game, when he suddenly put down the cards on the\ntable and said -- actually, we -- we invited him not to play cards but to discuss some serious\nbusiness with him. And then he told him right of the events -- that our name isn't actually\nHessem. We are Jews who live here in hiding and our name js so and so and we -- and then he\ntold him what happened with that pensioner and that we have to get out immediately or within a\nday at least. And also possibly save some of our belongings. And the -- the officer was in full\nuniform. His name, incidentally, his first name is Heinz. He listened in stony silence, then he got\nup and said he'll discuss everything with his parents and will be back as soon as possible. After\nsome time that to us seemed like an eternity, it was probably not more than 15, 20 minutes, I\ndon't know -- they lived just one block over from us, he came back not alone, but with his\nmother. His mother was a gray haired -- sort of gray haired, dignified lady, came with a huge\nbasket of food, which she plunked on the table with a thump and an angry face and said, \u201cListen,\nyou have known our politics for -- for years now. We have known each other closely enough, we\ncould have helped you all that time. How come you didn't have confidence in us to tell us that\nbefore?\u201d And the food basket contained things which were worth a fortune on the black market.\nSausage, eggs and all kinds of things. And their -- their behavior was just incredible. So -- so\nthen they, right th-they said okay, what -- what they would -- they would like to, first of all,\nsupport us in -- in hiding some of our belongings. And after some discussion, we made the\nfollowing decision. As I had mentioned earlier, every night the British Air Force, the Royal Air\nForce bombarded Berlin, and of course all surrounding areas and had airplane alert, and so\npeople would be up and then after the all clear siren, people obviously would go immediately to\nsleep, because they had to get up early in the morning to go to work. So the decision was to wait\nabout half an hour after the all clear, hoping by that time everybody will be sound asleep and in\nthe meantime have suitcases with certain necessities packed and Heinz said he would help us\ncarry them over to their place and they have a shed behind their house where they could lock\nthem up and they would be safe there. And -- and then Heinz said he had a room in -- in the\nsouthern borough of Berlin, Templehoff. It became known later under -- during the air lift of '48,\n'50, because there was also an airport that played an important role in the air lift. But anyway, in\nTemplehoff he had a room where he could, we c -- all four of us could at least temporarily stay,\nbut or -- some of us. And Margaret's mother knew -- had a -- a girlfriend, I mean a woman friend\nwho was also underground. Now she had succeeded 1n totally legalizing herself with police\nregistration and so on. And she said that the next day, she and Margaret would try to go there and\n-- and -- and Ma-Margaret's father and I would go to the room that Heinz had. And then, before\nleaving, Heinz turned around, pulled out his revol -- service revolver, gave it to Margaret's father\nand said, \u201cHere is my service revolver. If they should come tonight, just finish them off in self\ndefense. The war is over soon, anyway.\u201d And -- and then they left. That was an incredible thing\nthat he did. And -- and then the next day -- I mean then, at night, right, everything worked out the\nway it was planned. We carried the luggage over and I don't know whether we got any sleep\ndone or not, we probably didn't feel like it. The next morning we left, you know, as if going to\nwork, with no particular luggage on us. And -- and never came back and I just want to say that\nafter -- the few weeks after the Battle of Berlin, I came back to visit the place and neighbors told\nus that the following day, the Gestapo came looking for us. So that -- that really saved our lives.\nSo I-I, yeah -- then in that room where we stayed, incidentally, Heinz knew that the\nsuperintendent of the house, a janitor, was a secret Communist. I don -- I never knew how -- how\nhe actually knew that because that was itself subject to execution, but anyway he knew and --\nand he said he will talk to him about us, because he would -- he -- in -- in -- in the city, apartment\nhouse janitors were responsible to have every new person who appears, registered with the\npolice, I discussed that earlier. So -- but he said, if -- he -- he would not tell him that we are Jews,\nthat doesn't fly well with Communists, we -- he'll just tell him -- tell him that we are some\nSocialist activists and have to hide out. And so that's what he did and we were intoruss -- in fact I\nremember the janitor's name, Kuchinski, sort of a Polish name, huh? And -- but I mean, he was a\nGerman. And -- but Kuchinski himself had access to black market pistols. And so I bought a\npistol from him and -- for my own self protection and I had never had a gun in my hand in my\nlife and I decided if I, you know, ever have to use it in an emergency, I don't even -- I-I barely\nknew where to pull the trigger, but not how to aim and so on. So I bought additional ammunition,\nand that was also expensive. Each bullet costs -- I forgot, substantial amount of money. And\nfrom a piece of paper, I made myself a -- sort of a goal to aim at, with concentric circles and then\nI-I traveled out into a forest near Berlin and nailed it to a tree, of course in a solitary place where\nno people were around and then I sort of practiced shot. And I -- and you know, in those days\nthese more old fashioned guns, I think today -- they had a tremendous sort of a backlash. And all\nI remember is I never even hit the outer circle, not to speak of the inner circle. But at least I knew\na little bit of how to handle the thing. And actually I never had to use it, but at least it gave me\nalso some self confidence just to carry it with me. In the meantime, as I said, Margaret's mother\nand she herself were with that woman friend of Mrs. Haas. And -- and in the meantime they --\nthey knew some other people, through whom they finally found a place in Pottsdam. Now\nPottsdam is a suburb. It used to be the summer residence of Prussian kings. And there's\nparticularly one famous castle, the one of Frederick the Great, called Soswasee, which is French\nof course, means without worries or no worries. And that summer -- he was actually a great\nFrancophile and basically even talked mainly French and had his castle and also his garden\nsurrounding the castle designed in imitation of Versailles, on a much smaller scale, of course.\nAnd it also contained an orangery, just like the park in Versailles does. The orangery basically\nserved to keep plants in winter, which were -- which were not durable during winter. And also a\nservant's quarters for the gardeners. And that orangery had been turned into a huge sort of camp\nfor people who were out, bom-bombed out and also for refugees. I-I forgot to say that, actually.\nAs the Soviet army moved westward and came into areas which were inhabited by Germans, the\nGermans were systematically evicted from everywhere. And even that was, it started already\nbefore, I am now talking about March and early April, '45. Even in -- in midwinter, the -- the\nGermans were evicted and day and night you could hear, on the country road that passed by near\nthat cottage where we lived, horse drawn carriages with ref -- German refugees, hundred them.\nAnd, although that obviously was tremendous personal misery for these people, it filled me with\na tremendous joy to see, finally, the hardships of the war hitting back at those who had caused all\nthe misery to us, but also to other peoples. And -- and so there were millions and millions of\nGerman refugees, who were streaming westward, into the still unoccupied areas of Germany,\nincluding Berlin. And so, that orangery, as I said, was a huge camp for such people and so people\nwhom the Haas's knew, who -- who were themselves out bombed and lived there, they were\nintroduced simply as a family that was bombed out, but they said also they knew of my\nexistence, that it is too unsafe to have me there, because why would a youn-young 20, 22 year\nold or so man be living there? I mean he would be normally in the Vairmarkt, fighting. So I\nstayed then, alone in that room of Heinz in -- 1n the city, in the district of Templehoff and they\nwere out there. Of course I had a bicycle and I commuted -- I forgot what, once or twice a week\nout there. One reason also 1s I had all these food coupons that I collected and kept collecting and\nso I also brought food out there. And -- and -- and as -- as the war slowly sort of wound down to\nan end. Now, the Battle of Berlin, 1-1t -- yeah ona, I-I-I-I should say one other thing before the\nbattle. Th-th-the Germans made --",
        "A: No, but th-that's a totally new subject.\nBeginning of Tape Seven, Side A",
        "A: Yeah, as the war finally came home to Germany, we were delighted to see in the official\nvairmarkten, armed forces report, that was issued at the end of each day, finally German place\nnames. Names like Argen, Kern and so on, instead of names like Zabororja, Minsk, Halokoff,\nKiev and so on. That al-already felt like a liberation and there were more and more German place\nnames now in the official army reports. And all -- while all that happened, the government\nmaintained the official line that the war will be won, that there will be a final victory. As the\nfronts on all sides collapsed, of course preparations were made for the defense of Berlin. I have\nto say, that of all the insanities, that may have been probably the biggest one. There was n-no\nreason really, to defend Berlin and the Germans should have done what the French did in 1940,\ndeclared an open city and surrendered. But of course that was not to be. Instead, throughout\nBerlin, tank traps were built, ditches were dug. And the folkshdum was called up, finally, for\nparticipating in the defense of the city. And often they would even grab civilians from the street\nand just incorporate them in some unit. The battle itself began in earnest on April the 16th, 1945.\nI never forget that day, because even though the -- the Russian front was on the east side of the\nOda river, which runs north-south and about 50 to 60 miles east of Berlin, so it was pretty far\naway, but the artillery barrage was such that the ground under Berlin, under the city, was\nrumbling and slightly shaking. And of course, in battle reports, which I read long after the end of\nthe war, I can see the reason why. That was the biggest concentration of artillery ever. The\nRussians spent about two months getting ready for that assault on the city and they had\nassembled a density of artillery which was unheard of. And they raked the entire German front\nfor hours and hours. As I said, that -- at that time I was living in the Berlin borough of\nTemplehoff and through the Communist, I mean secretly Communist janitor of the house that I\nlived in, I also got some information of how the folkshdum members were called up and in fact\nhe showed me such a call up order that a friend of his got. So I-I kept a copy of that and then\ntyped on a typewriter that I had available, my own call up order, every day. So that if I had to -- I\nhad an errand to a certain part of the city, I would write myself a call up order that I had to report\nthere for duty. The reason was that there were -- I mean groups of folkshdum people either\ngrabbing civilians from the street, or also sometimes they are confiscating their bicycle, yeah. I-I\ndid all of my -- or almost all of my commuting by bicycle. Public transport had all but ceased to\nexist. There were still a few subway lines that were -- would run intermittently between a few\nstops until they came to a place where there was an artillery or a bomb crater, shutting down the -\n- the rest of the line. So that was surely not reliable transport. But the folkshdum did have the\npower to confiscate bicycle for service, so I always -- I wrote my marching order always in such\na way that it -- 1t would say I have to appear with my b-bicycle, which for purposes of my\nservice, is confi-confiscated by the folkshdum, the -- the militia. I kept visiting a number of\nfriends and there was a peculiar atmosphere then. By -- by that time the Russians were still far\naway from Berlin, but nobody knew how the Russians would take the city, what would happen\nafterwards. After all, the city was still totally dominated by the Nazis, not just the military, also\npropaganda-wise. Goebbels's voice was everywhere, in -- in newspapers, on the radio. And it -- it\nseemed as if a deep chasm sort of separated us -- our today, from what would happen tomorrow\nafter the Nazis are gone and nobody could really imagine how it would be like. From day to day\nof course, the Russians worked their way closer to the city and in fact, the way they planned their\nattack, instead of entering the city from the east, they passed -- their units passed by Berlin to the\nnorth and south, and then closed the pincer west of Berlin and -- and then entered the city from\nthe west. After -- and then the joy of hearing German city names in the official army report was\nplaced by the -- replaced by the even greater joy of hearing su-subdivisions and districts of\nBerlin mentioned in the -- in the army report. Like parts of Shallotenburg, which is a well known\nborough of the city, had fallen into Russian hands. Or the suburban railroad station of Eichner\nhas been taken by the Russians. It simply seemed unbelievable that these names, these place\nnames, where I had been sometimes only days before, were already in Russian hands. In fact,\nthere was a curious situation developing. People could make telephone calls into parts of the city\nwhich were already occupied by the Russians, which were behind the Russian lines. That was the\nweirdest thing, really. And visiting people, one usually parted never knowing whether one would\nsee each other again and instead of the German Auf Weidersain, which means really, \u201cSee you\nagain.\u201d One would greet each other, I mean say good-bye with a formaller Ubalips -- that means,\n\u201cSurvive it.\u201d And as I said, nobody could even imagine how life would be once the Nazis were\ngone. Berlin was, of course under constant bombardment and in the beginning, when the first\nartillery shells fell on the city in the -- in -- in the inner parts of the city, Goebbels distributed a\nnews release saying that these are not enemy artillery bombardment, but trial runs of a new\nGerman sort of miracle weapon, which is going to be used any day now, to throw the Russians\nback again. And there were people who believed this nonsense. Yeah, let me -- so the -- the -- the\ncity and of course also electricity slowly stopped being supplied and water stopped being\nsupplied in Berlin, even it -- it had already been drained by evacuation of ma -- children and\ninfirm people. There were still, I think, between three and four million people in the city and to\nimagine, that city was sort of headed into chaos, without -- without running water, without at\nleast reliable electricity and the gas lines on many places were -- had been, of course, hit. And so\nthere was no gas supply any more for cooking. The -- for me the crucial day was Sunday and I\nremember distinctly, Sunday, April 22nd, 1945. On -- by orders of Goebbels, who, besides all his\nother offices, was also in charge of the defense of Berlin, on his orders, all food st-stores were\nordered to be open. Now anyone who knows Germany and German mentality, must be aware\nthat the closing of stores on Sunday, of all stores, was something absolutely holy. There was\nnothing -- there was always one day, one Sunday -- that was the Sunday before Christmas, where\nstores were open, that was a tradition, but on all other Sundays, nothing -- the world had to go\nunder for -- for an order to be issued for stores to be open. And that of course, exactly was what\nwas happening. I mean their world was going under. And it was obvious then, that what\nGoebbels wanted to avoid is that the food stores and the shops might be maybe taken by Russian\ntroops. And rather than have that happen, had to distribute it to the population. And in fact, there\nwas enough food there that he also announced the distribution of all kinds of special rations. See\nhow the -- the ration coupons had -- of course most coupons were dedicated, like 1t would say for\n100 gram of butter or 100 gram of meat or whatever, this and that. But there were certain\ncoupons always which were unassigned. They were just labeled with a letter, like A, B, C or\nsomething, for special occasions. And so, he -- he announced that on coupon A, everybody\nwould get so much of this food and on coupon B, so much of that food. There was a -- a -- a\ntremendous amount of these special rations amounts. Now here I was with my 16 food ration\ncards for 16 people. So I basically went wild. I went -- found -- of course that was in the days\nbefore the supermarket, so in other words, you had to go to the butcher separately and to the\nbaker and to the dairy, for each particular type of food. And so I was busy for a long time, you\nknow, buying all that and coll -- and bringing it into the room which I occupied in -- in\nTemplehoff and thinking how I can get most of it out to Pottsdam, to my friends. And -- and then\n-- but even more overpowering was, that on that day, finally, beaten German army units started\nto stream into Berlin. And that is a sight which I will never forget, I think that made -- that day I\ncan say without equivo-vocation may be the happiest day in my life. Anyone who has seen\nGerman soldiers in -- in an ordinary life or in -- du-during the war or on -- on parades, they\nalways looked spic and span, there was not a button missing, there was not a spot. An-and -- and\nthey all -- an-and they looked well-shaved, clean and -- and with a certain aggressive stride and\ndemeanor. These guys who came back, they were dirty, unshaved. Their uniforms had buttons\nmissing. Many had bloody bandages around their head or their arms in a sling. None of them\nbore any weapons and -- and they had that dull look of defeat in their eyes. Wh-wh-when I saw\nthose guys, I finally -- even though I knew the war was lost for Germany of course, somehow\nintellectually and mentally, but now I saw it with my own eyes and I almost lost my mind. I-I got\non my bike, I remember and bicycled along and felt almost like thanking each of these soldiers\nfor the way they looked. I-I'm somewhat of a history buff and I had read reports of Napoleon's\narmy streaming back from Russia after their defeat in 1812 and -- and these guys looked exactly\nlike those descriptions of Napoleon's defeated army. And -- and then the -- the eerie thing was\nthat now and then truckloads of newly outfitted soldiers, who looked clean and fresh and with\nweapons, drove into the opposite direction, towards the -- towards the front, which was probably\njust, I don't know, 10 or 20 miles or so away, if that much. So -- but then I -- I finally sort of\ngrabbed a hold of myself and -- and went back to the house and this German apartment houses\nare always sort of built with a courtyard in the back and the rumor spread that -- there was one\nperson apparently, who for some reason owned a horse and he couldn't feed that horse anymore\nand so he decided to have it slaughtered by a professional butcher. But of course there was no\nrefrigeration either, so he couldn't say, keep the -- the meat for-forever. So he invited just anyone\nfrom the house to serve himself. So it was incredible, I-I got myself a long, sharp knife and went\ndownstairs and cut a sort of a big chunk out of the upper thigh, or the rear end of -- of the horse,\nof the dead horse that was lying there. And a-as -- as -- as another sort of trophy. And -- and then\nanother rumor spread that was -- th- there -- there was a huge freight yards of the German\nrailroads, about -- less than a mile away from that apartment building and the rumor spread that\nthe Vairmarkt, the German army had just abandoned and withdrawn from the freight yards and\nthat there were many freight cars loaded with food. And then I got on my bike with a knapsack\nand -- and bicycled to the -- to the freight yard and I saw already people streaming there from all\nover and -- and then the -- the freight yard was periodically raked with machine gun fire from\ndeep diving Russian fighter planes. And you know, to avoid being shot, I-I sort of threw the\nbicycle away and -- and I had to -- anyway I wasn't on my bike, it was across tracks, so I-I-I\nwalked, pushed it. And then I-I threw myself down, pressed myself against the -- sort of the --\nwh-what are these, these wooden ties, I guess, the railroad ties and -- until the planes had gone\nand then I would get up. So then I-I came to a -- to a railroad car, which had, was loaded with big\nvats full of butter, so ea-each one, maybe 50 pounds or so. And -- so how do you -- an-and that\nwas sort of solid butter, so how do you grab solid butter? Well, I had a -- I had a huge\nscrewdriver in a tool kit on my bike, so I got that screwdriver out and sort of staked out a huge\nsort of a cube of butter and took 1t with my hands and threw it in my, into my knapsack, which at\nother times, I had taken potatoes in, with dirty peels and -- and -- and coal and so on. So what I\ndecided, if the outer layer of the butter is covered with dirt, I'll just cut off a layer and then inside\nit should be clean. So, anyway -- so then I-I-I took that back and -- and my room that I had in\nthat house was like a veritable sort of food storage place. Incidentally, as a side light, when I\ncame back after the war, I-I was told that maybe half an hour or so after I left that place, the\nfolkshdum turned up there, collected all males, put them on trucks and drove them out to the\nfront. So I was spared having to fight the Russians. And -- and then I decided I-I better get al --\no-o-on the one hand I didn't want to get out of Berlin, because I felt a tremendous inner\nexcitement, to see the fall of a major capital, which had a sort of world dominating role played,\nwas to me like -- see, witnessing the fall of Rome to the Germanic tribes, whatever, 2000 years\nor so earlier and that filled me with excitement. But on the other hand, I -- I really felt that I\nwanted to spend these hours with Margaret and so I-I finally -- what I did is I wrote myself a\nmarching order for the folkshdum, which said that my battalion that I belonged to, had to report\nfor duty in Pottsdam, which I h-had earlier mentioned, the suburb where Margaret and her\nparents had found a place. And I put as much into the knapsack as I could, I mean the more s --\nvulnerable things of course, were the butter and also the -- the chunk of horsemeat. And -- and\nthen a few other things, I don -- I-I forgot what it was, anyway, was a knapsack just full with\nfood and -- and by that time also, the army had taken over traffic control and at each major\nintersection, there were transportation officers directing traffic of course, what there was was the\ntraffic was all military by that time. Military trucks and -- and jeeps and this sort of thing. And\nthere was a major intersection near the house where I lived and I-I went up to the officer in\ncharge and told him that I had been ordered to report into Pottsdam and whether he knew\nwhether the highway to Pottsdam was still open or whether the Russians had cut it. By the way,\nthe Russians then were always referred to by their nickname, Ivan. So -- Ivan in English. So -- I -\n- that's how you talked about them, with a Ivan, because no -- nobody really knew it and -- and\nthe officers answer was that he knows only what goes on within a radius as far as he can see in\neach direction. And he -- he didn't under -- it was just total chaos. And -- and -- and those idiots\nwere still fighting and -- and defending the city. And by the way, at each of these intersections,\nlike that also, there were heavy guns and -- put into place, that -- so that in case Russian tanks\nwould appear, they would immediately be subject to heavy artillery fire. So anyway, I decided, I\nmean to see whether I can get through to Pottsdam, there were rumors that the Russians had\nalready cut that highway. And I got on my bike and with my marching orders and everything and\n-- and set out. And that trip to Pottsdam was a -- a -- a major experience. Th-the -- the -- the\nhighway was mobbed, Pottsdam was in the direction sort of southwest of Berlin. In other words,\nsort of away from the eastern front and it was full with people. And -- and all kinds. There were\ngroups of allied soldiers, I mean British and French, who were obviously prisoners of war and\nwhich you had seen throughout the war, always in groups, but under heavy German military\nguard. These guys, they were simply walking down there, no-nobody even, they were part of the\npopulation, nobody even gave a damn that they were supposed to be under German military\nguard. I suppose they were trying to get home or something. There were foreign laborers. There\nwere people who pushed, sort of some belongings they wanted to save, in -- in baby carriages or\nin little wagons that they pulled. And then -- now and then a -- a fancy, big Mercedes, with the\ndriver leaning on the horn to make way, was slowly making its way, getting some big shot out of\nthe city before the Russians would take it. And then, in the midst of all of that, periodically,\nRussian fighter planes would st-swoop down and rake the street with machine gun fire and then\neverybody, like on a -- a -- as even blown away by the wind, would vanish to the sides of the\nroad. And there are sort of rainwater ditches on each side, and lie down there until that danger\nwas over, then get back up and walk. It was the most incredible, it was a -- a -- the -- part of it I\nbicycled, part I pushed. Yeah, there were some areas where there was a b -- one area, I think,\nwhere a water main was broken and the -- the water was almost knee high. So you had to wade\nthrough that and -- anyway -- and -- and then finally I arrived at the bridge which connected\nBerlin to Pottsdam, the -- there was actually, at the western outskirts of Berlin is a -- there was a\nhavel, spelled exactly by the way, the same way as the name of the president of the Czech\nRepublic, H-a-v-e-l. That river also separates Berlin and Pottsdam, there's a bridge leading over\nit and that's how you get then, from Berlin into Pottsdam. The name of the bridge is Gleenic\narburger and -- which became famous several decades later, which I couldn't have known at that\ntime, of course. It's famous because that's where, often, spies were exchanged. Yeah, that was, of\ncourse, West Berlin, then. What -- what became later West Berlin and among others for example,\nthe Jewish refusnik Anatoly Sharunski, now an Israeli minister, Nathan Sharunski was\nexchanged there and given freedom on that bridge. Well, anyway, at that bridge, I saw already, at\nthe distance, was completely, there was a -- like a chain across the bridge, of SS, checking\ncarefully everybody's papers. So -- but I had my folkshdum ID and my marching orders to report\nto Pottsdam, so I figured nothing can happen. I-I had in my breast pocket also, the gun which I\nhad bought on the black market, through that janitor, but I was hoping not to have to use it. And\nof course there was such a sea of humanity, they obviously didn't really have the time anyway to\ndo very thorough checks, but they found my papers to be in order and -- and then I-I passed\nthrough and I had to still bicycle through a major part of Pottsdam, because the park of\nSoswasee, where that orangery building was located, was on the other side of Pottsdam and --\nand then I appeared there and they had already almost given up hope that I would be able to get\nout of Berlin. So that was the 22nd. But I had still a lot of food left in the -- in the apartment, so I\ndecided the next day, I ought to go back and -- and pick up some more food. And when I arrived\nat the Gleenic Arburger to bicycle across, the commanding officer told not just me, but\neverybody else, that Russians were reported nearby -- oh yeah, and -- and of course all bridges\nhad been -- had been supplied with explosive charges, so that at the approach of Russian troops,\nthey would be blown up so that they couldn't use the bridges. That was another part of the\ninsanity, because while the Russians could have used the bridge, these bridges also were part of\nthe German infrastructure, which at that time was already almost totally destroyed and -- and\nunder those conditions, with a -- a lack of raw materials and so on, wasn't easily re-buildable in -\n- in those days. But -- but the Germans and -- and particular the Nazi party fa -- we-were so\nfanatic, that they completely disregarded the needs of their own population, even. But I mean,\nthey had it coming. The -- with all of that, I -- my thoughts always go back again to the period of\nthe deportations. And how brutally the Jews were treated and nobody gave a damn about them\neither at that time. And -- and furthermore, I didn't even know yet, what had become of my\nparents and everybody else who had been close to me or whom I had known and I was still\nhoping to see them back once that whole thing was over. And I decided t-to go across the bridge\nanyway, hoping that they wouldn't dynamite it soon.",
        "A: Oh. And -- but then I was finally stopped, as I said, when I came to Pottsdam the day before,\nthere was a place where a water main had broken and the water was almost knee high. Where by\nth-the next day I came back, it was even higher and it was under a bridge. And I mean that, it\nwas practically impossible to -- you'd have to swim across and of course I would have been\ncompletely wet then and -- anyway, I didn't have the stomach to do it, so -- and how would I\nhave taken the bike through it? So I just returned without having been able to get into the city\nagain. Th-There was constant artillery bombardment of course. The 22nd, by that time, was over.\nThat was the day when I went out. Now the day where I made the unsuccessful attempt to return,\nwas the 23rd. So that is over now, then there were several days -- there were several days of -- of\nfighting and -- and finally on the twent -- yeah -- and final -- yeah -- wh-what we had to do also\nis, we finally decided -- we meaning all of the people who lived there as refugees, to transfer to\nthe basement. There was a huge basement with s-sort of simple benches and actually no\nelectricity, only some candles we had occasionally. And we just sort of hoped to wait out the\nworst danger. On the 27th of April, there was still no change, there was still artillery rumble and\n-- but we didn't know what was going on. So I decided I ought to go out and look and see what\nthe situation is. I went out and didn't see a soul until I finally saw a man in what looked to me\nlike the uniform of the -- an engineering battal -- the German army had engineering battalions\nwhich had sort of brownish type uniforms, which were used in support of the troops. I mean, to -\n- to build more quickly, bridges over rivers and things like that. And so I-I shouted at the guy and\nwanted to -- to know where -- wh-whether he knew where Ivan is. His response was to point his\ngun at me and shout back at me in a language that I had never heard before. And run toward me\nas I stood there with my raised arms and then he grabbed my left arm, saw the watch, gave it a\nstrong jerk, pulled the watch off and vanished again. So from that I knew that the Russians had\narrived, which I related downstairs. And from then on we frequently were visited by Russians\nwho came down there. They were interested only in two things. One was the women and the\nother one was possessions of any value. They took everybody's watches of course and other\nvaluables and -- and many women were taken, not just once, but innumerable times. And -- and\nso that went on for a day or two and -- and of course caused everyone to be totally demoralized\nand -- and then I think on -- on the second day or so, I -- there -- there was an artillery unit\nactually stationed in front of the orangery building, fighting was still going on in the\nneighborhood. And that artillery unit was under the command of a colonel who made a more\neducated impression than the run of the mill Russian soldiers. And in particular, he spoke fairly\nfluent German. And -- so Margaret's father went up to him and introduced himself and told him\nthat -- that we are Jews, whether -- that's the first Russian word that I learned, Jew means Yvrai\nin -- in Russian. And -- and we were treated just like the Germans, even though we had suffered\nunder them, just the same way the Russians. So the colonel pulled out a piece of paper and wrote\nsomething down in Russian and said whenever in the future, Russians sort of try to attack us or\nmolest us, to show that paper. And okay -- and then he -- he got orders to move on, which he did.\nAnd then -- now unbeknownst to me also, by the way, the -- the Russian commander in the area,\nhad ca-called on all German forces to surrender and furthermore had, i-in that order also, had\ndeclared that any German who tries to eva -- any German soldier who tries to evade captivity by\nputting on civilian clothes, will be treated by the Soviet armed forces exactly the same way as he\nwould have been treated by the German forces. And the German force -- the German forces, I\nmean that was already going on for months. Any deserter was, after a brief re -- cursory so called\nmilitary tribunal, was immediately hung from a tree and with a sign around his neck, I am too\nmuch of a coward to fight for my country and -- and for our women and children. And -- or\nsomething of that nature. In other words, what it meant is that if a German civilian was found, he\ncould be immediately executed by the Russians, because they would interpreted that as the guy\nbeing a deserter, trying to evade captivity. So I was out, on -- on that day and that was about, I\nthink a day after that colonel came, either the same day, later or the next day. And a-again, a\nRussian soldier was in the neighborhood, whereas -- as soon as he saw me, he pointed his gun at\nme and -- and pointed me toward a tree. As I said, it was in a park there. And I saw immediately\nthat he was going to execute me. So I shouted down into the basement for Margaret's father to\ncome up, because he had that paper that that Russian colonel had -- had given him, in Russian.\nAnd he came running up and handed the paper to that Russian soldier. He looked at it and made\na motion with it, as if he was wiping his rear end with it, sort of put it in his fist and crumpled it\nup and threw it away and told him to wait there too. Then I stood at the tree while he aimed at\nme. And at that moment, the only thing I could think of is, I survived the Nazis and now I end up\nlike this. And I could hear the click of the trigger, but nothing came out and he did that two or\nthree times and then he got mad and sort of threw his gun on the floor and shouted to me at\nRussian -- in -- in Russian, which I didn't understand and pointing at the tree, what it obviously\nmeant, that I should wait for him there at the tree, to be shot when he comes back with a different\ngun. And of course then Margaret's father and I, we immediately ran -- there was some bushes\nnot too far away and hid sort of right at the bottom there. And it wasn't long, I don't know, maybe\nfive minutes, maybe less, I don't -- when he came back and -- and we heard him shout and I was\njust sweating with fear. And we know that wouldn't be long until he found us and all we heard is\nhe kept shouting and then new voices appeared, more voices and -- which -- wa -- since we didn't\nknow Russian, I don't know what all these voices were saying, but apparently they had to move\non because the voices became more and more distant and -- and then finally ceased. And -- but\nwe decided that maybe the guy is just lying in wait for us, so we -- we waited there for at least an\nhour, if not more. And -- co -- wa-was completely silent, until we were sure that he really had\nleft the area.\nEnd of Tape Seven, Side A\nBeginning of Tape Seven, Side B",
        "A: So we finally emerged from there and there was not a soul around. Then we went back into\nthe basement and there was a tremendous shout of relief. Apparently, downstairs, somebody\nmust have seen the Russian soldier pointing his gun at me, so the rumor had spread that both of\nus had been shot. And -- so when we appeared alive, obviously the joy was great. So then, finally\ncame the first of May, 1945. And the first of May, of course, is a big Russian holiday, a Soviet\nholiday and -- and it was for the soldiers. By that time, things had sort of quieted down a little\nbit, although not too much and a large group of soldiers visited us. It somehow spread around\nthat Margaret's father, who was in general very handy, was also very good in some simple sort\nof dressing up wounds and things like that. And we had, of course for our own purposes, all\nkinds of medical supplies. And there were some soldiers who had, I don't know what it was any\nmore, some open flesh wounds flumow and anyway, he treated them. And then there was also a\npiano around for some reason and he played the piano and to celebrate them, he played the s-\nsong, \u201cThe Internationale,\u201d which is the sort of international Communist party song. And that\nmade them all very happy and -- and they became sort of somewhat friendly and then one -- I\nremember one soldier, he was a -- a giant of a guy, pulling out of a -- a dirty pocket, some\nequally dirty photographs of -- were obviously family pictures. Wife, children or something. And\nwith -- with tears streaming down his face, he said they were all killed by the Germans. And --\nand then after awhile, they said they needed all of the women to co-come along. And then so\nobviously we were very uneasy about that and then we said, you know, what they wanted -- I\nmean there was very difficult communication, obviously. None of us spoke Russian and they\nonly knew sort of a s-smattering of some German words. Anyway, it turned out they had nearby,\nsort of a -- some battalion or regiment camped and to prepare for their meal, they needed people\nto peel potatoes. And so we immediately, all of u -- males, volunteered to go and so they took the\nwomen and the men along to about, I don't know, it wasn't far away, a quarter of a mile or so,\nwhere they were camped and put us down and they had piles and piles of potatoes. And so we --\nwe peeled potatoes for them. And in fact they had discovered apparently somewhere, a storage\nshed that was full with potatoes. And one d -- and they needed more from there. One of the\nRussian soldiers took Margaret's father along to help him carry them in a-- 1n a sack or\nsomething. And when they opened the door of the shed, the first thing, before they even saw the\npotatoes, there was a dead German woman lying. So the soldiers just -- soldier kicked her away\nwith his foot and said something like \u201cKaput,\u201d which is a German word for broken. And then\nthey gathered the potatoes and -- and -- and brought them back. And -- and then we peeled\npotatoes and then we were actually taken back by them. Oh, while we -- while we -- while we\npeeled the potatoes, they had accordion players there, they -- they played the accordion and sang\nsongs, so for awhile it became even somewhat romantic and they also gave us some meat dishes\nto eat, which was hearty and -- even if not exactly gourmet style, but we were always hungry in\nthose days and would have eaten anything. And -- and then we were taken back by them again,\nto the -- to the orangery where we all stayed. But I mean, there were also, still, less pleasant\nincidents and robberies and so on. So a day or two later, I decided that we need really, some\nmore firm protection, that by now, since the city, there was no more fighting, even nearby, there\nmust be a city commander. And so I-I-I got up -- out, and said that I will try to find where the\ncommander is and see whether we can get some protection. And of course I had no idea wh -- th-\nthe city picture was totally changed. You know, a few days before, the last time I walked in the\ncity, it was full with Nazi party uniforms, SS, Vairmarkt uniforms. All of that has vanished as if\nswallowed up by the earth and all one saw was Russian uniforms. And the traffic was -- the\ntraffic police, they were all women, usually very hefty looking women. Their most prominent\nfeature, they were all unbelievably heavily bosomed and they carried two sort of colored sticks, I\nremember. I think one red, one yellow, which they waved in some prescribed form, with the left\nhand and with the right hand, indicating which direction could move and which had to halt. And\nactually they did it in a very snappy, military fashion. I enjoyed actually looking on, just seeing\nthem perform these duties. Now, in the meantime, in order to f-find the -- where the commandant\n-- the commandature was. Commandature is a Russian word actually, meaning the command\noffice for the -- for the city commander. And I was always pointed in some direction, so I just\nkept going in the direction that I was pointed at, until I arrived in front of a huge villa and that\nvilla was beleaguered by a huge -- by, actually by two huge throngs. As I found out in a minute,\none were Germans and the other one were foreigners. Practically all of them false laborers who\nhad been deported to Germany and who obviously went there for help in trying to get back to\ntheir home countries. There were Frenchmen, Belgians, Poles, e-e-everyone. And -- and the other\nthrong were Germans. The one person I remember was a German medical officer, who was in\ncharge of the local military hospital where -- I mean the Russians left him in charge -- these were\nall soldiers with fairly heavy wounds. He came to complain that his nurses were being constantly\nraped and therefore could not fulfill their duties to the patients. And I decided immediately not to\nidentify myself with the Germans, so I stood with the foreign laborers. Oh yeah, and I forgot to\nmention also, we had -- when we left that village overnight, we had taken along also, all our real\nidentifications, so that -- because obviously we knew the war would end within days or weeks,\nthat we could then establish our true identities. And, among other things I also had saved my\nJewish star, which I then put on. And as I said -- and I -- I waited there together with all the\nforeigners. And so it was of course a slow process. So finally 1t was my turn, I was ushered in\nand was in some sort of a front room, entry room or waiting room, whatever and was told to wait\nand then one, from -- behind it, apparently, was a real office and then one officer came and took\na look at me with that star and sort of shouted something in Russian to the back and then an\nofficer with sort of more stars and so on, who seemed to be the commander, came out. He was\nsort of a short, stocky, heavy-set guy. Took one look at me and -- and then asked me in fairly\ngood German, \u201cYou are a Jew?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes.\u201d And then he -- he ran toward me, embraced\nme and -- and told, sorry -- told me that I was the first Jew whom he -- whom he saw in -- in\nweeks or months. There was n-no Jew left anywhere... Okay, then he -- he asked me in his office\nand sit down and told me that, to tell him how come that I wasn't killed. So I briefly told him\nwhat had happened to me and -- and also that I was actually together with a family of friends and\nthat we needed some personal protection and then he -- he told me I should, as soon as possible,\nbring the whole family, he wants to meet them. Oh, and -- and of course, I forgot, his name was\nMajor Shike and of course, he was a Jew himself... So yeah, the only thing then at there, before I\nleft, he asked me, he said he -- he wants to keep my yellow star as a souvenir. So I gladly gave\nthat to him. And then I went back and I forgot, either the same day or the next day, all four of us\nwent there and met Major Shike again and he award us a piece of paper in Russian. That one was\nnot thrown away by anyone, in fact I still have it among my souvenirs and in fact I never knew\nwhat it really said and of course, with the Russian immigration to this country here during the\nlast decade or so, we also -- we made some Russian friends in Ann Arbor and I had that guy\ntranslate it to me, for the first time -- what, 40 years after Major Shike gave it to me. And it -- it\nsimply said that every possible protection is give -- to be given to the Jackass -- fact he ordered\nin one word, I guess he didn't realize that it was a first and a last name, family and -- and also\nthat we are supposed to be supplied generously with food. Oh, yeah, he told us also that the\nSoviet army was soon going to start handing out food to the population and they will be very\nsmall, restricted rations, you know, like so many crumbs of bread and this and that. And so there\nwill also be long lines. But with that piece of paper, first of all, we did not have to stand in line,\nbut we could right away go to the counter and also, we -- we should buy whatever we thought or\nneeded to buy. And regardless of what the official rations are. And you can imagine the pride we\n-- after years of being always kicked to the back, now we could go to the front and the Germans\nhad to stay behind and wait. And so that went on for -- I mean then our -- our life go-got much\nbetter and we were not molested any more. But the next thing was of course, we wanted to get\nback to Berlin. And so I guess we had to find out whether there is a suburban railroad line going\nfrom Pottsdam to Berlin. And so I suggested, I-I wrote to the railroad station, which was also\nseveral miles -- that castle was somewhat out of town, of Pottsdam. And to check the railroad\nstation and where the trains are going. And when I got to the railroad station, 1t was an incredible\npicture of destruction. Somebody should have painted or at least photographed it, but of course\nin those days we didn't have a camera and I don't have a talent for a painter. But the -- the -- the\nrailroad, there was hardly any railroad car that was standing on its wheels, they were lying on\ntheir sides, there were bomb craters all over and one locomotive apparently, must have been --\ndue to some force of some explosion, was standing on its heads wi -- on -- on the front end, with\nthe wheels o-on the side, a totally grotesque picture. And -- and wires were hanging and signal I-\nlights were dangling down or overturned. I mean you had to take one look and know not only\nthat nothing is running now, but that nothing would be running for weeks probably or months or\nlonger. So I walked back to give that report and on the way back, along one of the streets, I saw a\nsizable group of Germans, coming under guard by -- by two Russians, one Russian in front with\na gun over the shoulder and one Russian behind. And they were wearing not the usual army\nuniform. I mean it looked similar to the army uniform, except that their military hats were green.\nAnd these were actually the NK VD troops, which -- they were the forerunner of what later\nbecame KGB. And so I walked -- I mean I walked along and they came toward me and as they\nwere -- as they were passed me, the soldier in front asked me for my papers. And I-I had my\nJewish ID and naively I thought, you know, the guy knows immediately that -- you know, it\ndidn't say Jew, it just has a J printed on top of it. And furthermore, of course it was in the Roman\nletters, which are used 1-1n German and not in Cyrillic, which the Russians use. Anyway, he\ndidn't even look at the -- at the ID, he took the ID, put it in his uniform pocket and -- and told me\n-- I guess there were only a few words he knew in German, one of them was com. That means\ncome. And then I tried to tell him that Y-Yvrai and he just waved me off. So -- so then I\nsuddenly found myself a prisoner of the NK VD. And we walked for several blocks and I noticed,\nit seemed totally random. There were some Germans whom we let pass by and then again one he\nwould take along. I-I couldn't figure out what, if any -- principle governed his a -- and by now,\nhaving seen the Russians operate, I'm sure it was random, that there was no principle involved.\nSo anyway, we finally stopped at a large villa, which was -- had been confiscated by the\nRussians. And on the side of the -- w-we walked over to the side. On the side of the villa, a table\nwas set -- oh I'm sorry -- a table was set up and behind that table, there was a -- an officer, also\nwith a green hat, n-next to a civilian. And -- and we were sort of lined up in -- in -- in front, on\nthe other side of the table at a certain distance. And then we were called up, one by one, to sit\ndown -- there was one chair across from them, to sit down and being asked questions. When it\ncame to my turn -- and by the way, the officer, the interrogating officer looked exactly like a\nbrutal SS man, except the uniform was different. When it came to my turn, he asked -- the\nquestions were asked by him in Russian, by the way and the civilian next to him was an\ninterpreter, then he gave it to me in German. And they were all very standard, harmless question.\nMy name, my address, my father's name, that sort of thing, date of birth. And after the last\nquestion, then he turned that thing that he had filled out, that sheet of paper, over to me and --\nand asked me to sign at the bottom. Now, not only was everything that he filled out and so on, in\nCyrillic, but then there was a long paragraph below the filled out part, of text. So I pushed that\nthing over to the interpreter and asked him politely to inter -- I wanted to know what I'm signing,\nyou know. Interpret it to me. But instead of translating it in -- into German, he told the officer\nthat I wanted it translated. And then the officer barked something that didn't sound very\nappealing to me and then the interpreter said, \u201cHe says,\u201d you know, \u201cmy boss says, if you don't\nsign it right away, he beat you to death right here on the spot.\u201d So I signed it and was convinced\nat that time and somewhat even today still, that I probably signed that I volunteer to go to\nSiberia. And so then, an-and actually, a few of the people after that interrogation ended were sent\nhome. Others were not and of course I was in the latter group. Then we were, after we were\nthrough with all of them, we were led around to the back and in the back yard there was an air\nraid shelter ditch, which the Germans had dug during the war, to protect, I mean, against air\nraids. And what it was is, it's a ditch, you know, about I would say, about three yards wide and\nabout five feet -- five feet deep at most, maybe a little bit less. And then over it was a sort of pre-\ncast concrete sort of arch that extended the length of the ditch. So an-and that pre-cast concrete\narch then, would be covered, or was covered with earth and something planted on it, so that it\nwas camouflaged, but you could go in for protection of that against bombs or artillery and so on.\nAnd they used it now as a prison. Of course it was totally damp -- yeah and the-there were\nbenches in there, but it was very damp and unpleasant. And -- and then there was a guard with a\ngun at the exit. And the only reason to -- for anyone to go out is, if somebody had to do some\nbusiness and the guard who stood there knew only one German word, we were told and -- and\nthat is shisin, which is the German slang word, actually the total equivalent of, in English, means\nshitting. So -- what did -- if -- if somebody had to go, then they was taken out and what they had\nrigged up there is, between two trees, they had fastened a horizontal broom, at about sitting\nheight or chair height. And you just had to sort of sit over that broom, holding on with your\nhands and do whatever you had to do and then go back again in-into that ditch. And after a few\nhours, we were even brought some food. It was in -- in a bucket, which is used in Germany, or I\nguess here too, for say, washing floors and th-they had in there some nondescript soup, with a\nfew pieces of meat sort of floating around in it... Yeah, then later that day, I mean that was all\nstill in the morning and then we get something at noon, that -- that food and then the afternoon,\nsomebody shouted down, \u201cAll Germans out.\u201d Again, there were Germans and non-Germans that\nthey had collected them and the non-Germans were al-always the forced laborers that the\nGermans had deported into Germany. But anyway, all Germans were called out and I\nimmediately decided, you know, I'm not a German and so I stayed in there. And they were\nactually taken out to peel potatoes for the Russians, you know it was a fairly large group of\npolicemen and investigators and so on. And after they were finished, they were told, okay now\nthey can go home. Then I thought I could hit myself over the head. If I would have gone out with\nthe Germans, I would be out and free now. Well, it was a wrong guess. And then, the night came\nand we had to sort of seat -- sleep sitting up on that -- that bench, in -- in that damp atmosphere\nthere, as well as one could and the next day, the next day the various people were called up for\nmore interrogation. Yeah and then I had sort of started up some sort of a talking\nacquaintanceship with a Czech engineer, who had been taken by the Germans to work on some\nwar plant. And so he was called up and he -- he was brought down by the guard after whatever,\nmaybe a half an hour and he was hardly down and had sat down and he looked already very\ndisturbed, when another officer, who looked also extremely brutal, appeared with a -- he had sort\nof a baton and -- and a sort of wooden stick in front, 1-in his hand, waved it in front of that Czech\nguy and shouted at him in Russian, something that didn't sound very pleasant. And when he was\ngone, the Czech guy told me that the Russians, during the interrogation, told him that they have\nevidence that he was not forcibly deported, but that he volunteered to work for the Germans. And\nof course he denied that and it wasn't true, he said. And that guy who came down, shouted at\nhim, \u201cIf you don't admit the truth, that you volunteer t-to work for the Germans, you'll stay down\nhere until you starve of -- of -- of hunger.\u201d And -- and th-then he told me yeah, I mean he -- he --\nby the way, he knew Russian also, that Czech guy. He told me -- you know I had told him a little\nbit about my story, that, \u201cthey probably won't believe that you are a Jew, either.\u201d Anyway, later\nthat day, be -- before I was even interrogated, we were all called out and marched off. And I\nthought now actually, that we are headed toward someplace where we were being shipped off\ninto the Soviet Union. And I was sort of looking around, whether there would be a way, quick --\nmake a quick escape. There was just -- there were two soldiers, one in front and one bringing up\nthe rear, each one with a gun who -- and it would have had to be somewhere where, you know,\nthey couldn't immedia -- anyway, it never came to that, we only walked about two or three\nblocks and then we were asked to sit down on the street in front of an even bigger villa, which\nwas also occupied by these same green-hated soldiers. And then we were called up one by one\ninto the building for interrogation and some people actually, after they came out, left. Apparently\nthey were told to be free and others came back and joined us. And when -- when I was called in,\nthere were two interrogators and they struck me immediately, sort of totally different. But see the\nRussians which I had come across so far, all were s-sort of looked pretty uncivilized and -- and --\nand brutal in a sort of a raw way. These two guys, they also looked brutal, but they were well\nshaved. They looked brutal, maybe sounds funny to say, in the SS way. They had elegant\nuniforms, they talked fluent German, they seemed to be very educated, but -- made a ruthless\nimpression that way. But -- anyway they --they wanted to know, you know, who I am, which I\ntold them and then exactly as that Czech had predicted, they told me that they won't believe that I\nam Jewish and in fact that they have some evidence that I had -- was working under orders to\nblow up bridges to delay the Russian advance and how I could prove that I'm Jewish. And then I\ns -- I told them, well you have my papers, you know th-they confiscated. Then they both\nlaughed, indicating, you know, these days, anyone has forged papers, so. And then I was sent\ndown into the basement of that villa. The basement was of course, concrete floor, covered with a\nthin layer of straw and I was greeted there by a chorus of other Germans, \u201cAh, a-a new one\ncoming in.\u201d And of course, in lying there with those guys I found out one of them was th-the\nlocal Nazi party district leader, had sort of the same position as that guy that we had then. And I-\nI said, sort of to myself, you know, what an irony, you know. Here I am in prison now, with guys\nlike those, like that. And -- and then we were also again fed some nondescript food and people\nwere constantly being called up for interrogation upstairs. And then night fell and then the guard\nwould periodically come into the cellar and shine a flashlight into people's faces, looking for a\nparticular individual and then gave in up and the next morning I was called up again and -- and\nthe same two guys were there and they immediately took me und-under sharp questioning and\nsaid whether I had changed my mind and I'm willing to tell the truth now. And I told them that I\n-- that I -- that is the truth and then one guy sort of walked up to me and said, \u201cYou know, I tell\nyou one thing, we have more -- too many of your types of Jews in the Soviet Union, and they're -\n- you are all the same. You don't want to work, but you want others to work. You want other\npeople to work for you. If one thing, we'll teach you guys to -- how to work.\u201d And then, with that\nhe lifted his jack-booted foot and gave me a -- a powerful kick into my rear end, \u201cNow get\ndown.\u201d And the guard took me down again. And then other people were called up and I forgot\nwhether there was a third night or not, but anyway, the next time I was called up, the guard who\ndid the bringing up, came into the basement, pulled his pistol a-and shouted into the room.\nUsually he called by name, now he shouted, \u201cWhere is the Jew?\u201d So I got up and he pulled his\npistol and said, \u201cYou are going to be shot now.\u201d An-And that d-didn't sound real to me, because\nthey weren't shooting people there, you know? And anyway, as I-I walked ahead of him, he sort\nof pressed the muzzle of his gun into my back, but somehow at that point I wasn't afraid, I-I-I-I\nsort of felt that was just a ruse. And when I came up, there were these same two guys and they\nagain asked me whether I had a change in mind and whether I'm ready to tell them the truth. And\nI -- I said, \u201cThat is the truth.\u201d And then -- then they asked, \u201cWell, how could you prove that you\nare a Jew?\u201d So I-I said, \u201cWell, I know some Hebrew.\u201d So upon which one of them rattled\nsomething in -- in Yiddish. Then -- then I said, \u201cBut that wasn't Hebrew, that was Yiddish.\u201d Then\nhe said, \u201cOh? What's the difference?\u201d So I explained the difference to him and then he smiled\nand then he said, \u201cWell what -- what -- what do you -- what Hebrew do you know?\u201d You know,\nin -- in -- in that moment, the only thing I could think of was a Shema, which I recited. And then\nthey both laughed and then it suddenly struck me, these guys are Jews. And -- and then they were\njust instantaneously switched, they were extremely polite, told me to sit down and I must be\nhungry after that ordeal and they -- they barked some orders at some guy outside. And it was in\nfive minutes he came with delicious rolls with s -- sausage and salami and -- and then we had a\nconversation, then he asked me what I want to do and I told him werwidden. And then he said\nwell okay, I-I should get out of there an-and -- and go home. Now the thing is this, on the day --\nthat all started when I was looking for the -- when I was looking for the railroad station and I had\na light coat on and that coat, of course I had left downstairs in the -- in the cellar, in the\nbasement. But during the days that I was down there, you know, you hear all kinds of stories,\nthey were telling of -- of somebody who was released by the guys upstairs, who also had\nforgotten some personal belongings in -- in the basement and said he wants to retrieve it, but the\nguard had a change in mind, you know and -- and just told the guy he's not letting him out again,\neven though the officer upstairs there. So I figured, to hell with my coat, I am free and that's\nmore important. But of course, in those days, even a coat, a simple coat was a -- somewhat of a\nfortune, but my freedom was even more valuable. I-I forgot to mention, by the way, that when,\non the first day, when those Germans were asked to peel potatoes and then released, I managed\nto tell one of them the address where the Haas family were living there in the orangery and to\nnotify them where I am, because you know, they had no idea. So when I came back, you know,\nthey knew over there, that guy had actually notified them and they had gone to Major Shike, you\nknow, hoping that all that needs to be done, that he has to pull some strings to get me out. And\nwhen they told him where I was, he immediately backed off and said, \u201cWell, there's nothing that\n-- these guys knows wh -- know what they are doing,\u201d and he cannot interfere. So, that's an\ninteresting sidelight on the system, was exactly the way with the Gestapo in -- in -- 1n -- in -- in\nNazi Germany of course. Okay, so anyway, after all of that, we knew that no trains were running\nto Berlin, but that's where we wanted to get to. And then -- in the meantime, our bicycle of\ncourse, had been stolen by the Russians. It was th -- after the watch, was the next thing. So I\ncouldn't even bicycle to Berlin, but I suggested that I walk to Berlin, was about, I forgot, must be\n25 miles or so. And -- and go to the Templehoff district, where I had that room and sort of see\nwhat's going on. So I walked there and right when I got there, I-I found out first of all, that the\nRussians had already instituted a German civilian administration and in the borough, sort of city\nor each -- yeah, Berlin has 20 boroughs, you know, th-that borough of Templehoff where that\napartment was in, then had its own city hall and so I went up there and I found out that they have\nlists o-0-of -- of Nazis, particularly Nazis who had more prominent positions. And their\napartments are available for people who are returning from concentration camps, that were\npersecuted. So the guy told me that all I have to do 1s ask for a list and I can pick the apartment I\nwant to have. And of course I didn't want to make a decision so I just stayed one night and then\nwalked back again and then there's another one or two days and then I -- I walked with\nMargaret's father, Mr. Haas, to Berlin. There we had a -- another incident, while we were\nwalking on the -- this major highway, I mean that also goes through suburban city streets toward\nBerlin. We saw already at a distance -- there was a big hospital there and -- and the Russians,\nyou could see were busy there, carrying equipment out. And -- but as we come closer, we could\nsee that they were basically Russian guards and German civilians carrying equipment. And so, as\n-- as we got there, the Russian guard immediately enlisted us to also help carry out equipment\nfrom the -- they were dismantling the entire hospital and we had to go in and carry out whatever\nmedical supplies and -- and so on.\nEnd of Tape Seven, Side B\nBeginning of Tape Eight, Side A",
        "A: Yeah, so -- I mean, we were not exactly excited by this prospect, particularly since we figured\nif they need us here to load that truck, somewhere they must have a railroad sighting, where the\ntruck then has to be unloaded into railroad cars and we didn't want to be taken there. Now again I\nhad really a unbelievable stroke of luck. It turns out that one of the nurses in that hospital, was a\nnurse who at one time, my grandmother had -- I forgot for what reason my grandmother was\nparalyzed toward the last years of her life. Anyway, she knew me and she knew our family. And\nso I-I told -- we had a chance to chat and then she told us to -- when we ca -- to bring down now\nwhatever we were taking dow -- told to take down and when we come up, to see her in a certain\nroom number. So that's where we went and then she conducted us to some rear staircase, in the\nrear of the building, that the Russians apparently hadn't been aware of, and which let out some\nrear door to a side street, away from that main highway. And then she told us to walk down that\nstreet, several blocks and then turn right and to come back again to the main highway, but sort of\nout of sight of those g-guards there. So that's what we did, so. And -- okay, then we continued\nand then when we came to Berlin, I went with my -- with Margaret's father to the -- to the city\noffice, where I had been a few days before and we were give -- given the list and then we started\nto look at one or two apartments and actually liked one. There -- there was a mother, who was, I\nguess she must have been probably around late 30's, maybe around 40, with two relatively small\nchildren, maybe sort of around, maybe, a young teenager, I think a boy around 13 and a girla\nfew years younger. And, you know, we identified ourselves as -- that we are Jews and that the\nNazis had taken everything we -- away. Oh yeah, by the way, I'm sorry, I have to back up. The\nofficial in the city hall also told us that the people, I mean, who -- apartments are vacated, are not\npermitted to take anything with them, unless we give special permission. And t -- Margaret's\nfather sort of conducted the conversation and he told her that we are, of course, not like the Nazis\nand any personal, I mean we don't want her clothing or -- or that of other family members and --\nor personal items, but all furnishings, all kitchen utensils and those things, have to stay in the\napartment. And -- and to do it sort of on an honor code and we'll be back the next morning to\nclaim the apartment. So that's what we did, we came back the next morning, got a set of keys and\n-- and then took possession of the apartment. And then I-I think through Major Shike or\nsomehow, we got a Russian military truck to take us along, who was going to Berlin anyway,\nalso with all our luggage. I mean you couldn't have -- yeah, I-I mean I-I-I skipped several things,\nyou know, when -- when I say I discussed, when we suddenly had to leave that village there\novernight and we hid all our suitcases in the shed of this elderly couple, Dwuzul. I don't -- I don't\nknow whether I mentioned their name, but their name is Dwuzul anyway. And I picked those up\nby meeting them at a certain railroad station. So we had all our things with us by that time. And\nof course there was no way how we could have gotten to Berlin, you know, with all that stuff if\nwe -- so anyway, that's how we got to Berlin. And then one sort of interesting after development,\nI-I had discussed, quite a bit earlier, the former client of my father, who was also a furrier and\nwhere I went to work once a week on his estate, so long, as a gardener in the fields. And I\nmentioned that he had three Polish forced laborers there. A Polish couple and then a single\nwoman, Maria, who always, every time I came, invited me to her room and fed me and gave me\nfood along. And -- and who I sort of suspected that she might have a crush on me. Well, when I\nvisited the furrier [indecipherable] after the war, he told me an amazing story, he said when the\nRussians came, you know and he lived, of course in an area of big mansions and they were going\neverywhere just emptying places out -- Maria went and sort of got a hold of the first Russian\nofficer and had a long conversation in Russian with him. As a result of which, the officer ordered\nall his -- his troops away from this house and -- and on and he was, nothing happened to his\nplace. And then he -- he asked Maria, \u201cWhat -- what did you tell him?\u201d And, \u201cI-I told him that\nyou are one of the few decent Germans, that you helped enemies of the regime and Jews.\u201d And\nthen he said, \u201cWhat -- what Jews did I help?\u201d Well, you know, I went -- I think I mentioned I\nwent there also under an assumed name. And the name I used there, by the way, was Tsarin1.\nThere was some reason for that, but doesn't make a difference here. And -- and she said, \u201c\u201cWasn -\n- Wasn't Tsarini Jewish?\u201d And he laughed and said, \u201cOf course he was, but how did you know?\u201d\nThen she said, \u201cI know because I am Jewish. My name is not Maria at all. I -- I got Polish\npapers. It was better to be deported to Germany for forced labor than to some concentration\ncamp and I-I immediately recognize a Jew.\u201d And -- and when he told me the story, I felt really\ndumb. That is -- that never occurred to me. And I often wondered what became of Maria, or\nwhatever her real name is. Well, it's an interesting sidelight.",
        "A: Oh yeah, okay. In a -- we heard from British broadcasting, BBC, that we occasionally -- yeah,\nthe -- the -- we -- we had a chance to listen to BBC at the house of this elderly couple, the\nDwuzuls, you know, who -- later were insulted that we hadn't informed them earlier who we\nwere, because they -- we had even before that, when we still pretended to be good German\nAryans, we had often been at their house listening to foreign broadcasts, mainly BBC, actually,\nwith them. And in fact I have to say that -- that was a big morale booster, just to listen to the\nBBC. They did a lot for us just by having these broadcasts and -- and they -- their signal was\nalways -- it started out with the Morse Code signal for the letter V, for victory and -- and by\ncoincidence, these are also the first tacts of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. And -- and just\nlistening to -- to this signal was already a big morale booster. And of course we heard all kinds of\nstories, that the Nazis kept from the population. And of course, as I had also said before, that was\npunishable by execution if they found out someone was listening to foreign radio broadcasts. So\nin a way, the Dwuzuls had a point, you know, they were totally in our hand, you know, we -- we\nlistened to these broadcasts there with them at their radio and --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Oh, no.",
        "A: No, not -- I mean, all I was going to say -- that come from -- from Brit -- from BBC we heard\nfor the first time, I think maybe I said that before already, that hundreds of thousands of Jews are\nbeing killed. Then -- no, 1-it -- it took quite awhile. Actually, people slowly dribbled in. There\nwas a central registration place for Jews right after the war. In fact, that was at the Jewish\nhospital, which was the last, sort of collection center for Jews for deportation. Then it was turned\nover and -- and then was the first place where Jews could -- free Jews could collect again. And --\nbut since there was no public transport, that was at the opposite end of Berlin. Templehoff was in\nthe southern part of Berlin and that hospital in the northern part. It was a long walk of many\nmiles. I went there once a week, hoping to see a -- a well known name, but -- but didn't discover\nanyone. The -- the first person who returned, whom I knew, from Auschwitz, was a high school\nfriend of mine, who in fact later also came to this country and was then, before his retirement, a\nprofessor of mathematics at Ohio State University in Columbus, and -- where he is living now.\nBut he -- he was in Auschwitz and he came back and he told me basically, a lot of the things\nalso, a lot of the things that Elie Wiesel discussed in his book, \u201cNight.\u201d An-and -- I mean sort of,\nI mean the -- the fact that millions of Jews had been systematically killed, I mean it -- because\nthen also other Jews came back, not just German Jews, also east European Jews who were\nchased out then, from their own countries, mainly from Poland. As you may know, there were\npogroms in Poland against the returning Jews. And so, I don't know how soon we found out, but\nwithin maybe weeks or months, we found out, although I mean, the total extent of 1t probably\nmight have taken longer, I-I don't know.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "A: Yeah, right -- that -- that came out. I-I-I would like to make a few sort of post-script\ncomments concerning the period of time before the start of World War Two. Because I-I\nremember you had also asked me a question, you know, how that time affected me, at that time I\nwas just a teenager and of course the Nazis were then in power, since 1933. And what I would\nlike to say 1s, that there was an increasing atmosphere, sort of -- of -- of hostility against the Jews\nin -- in all -- in the media, in p -- in -- in newspapers, in -- in the radio and so on. And -- and we\nwere, I mean, th-that I know I discussed also -- pictured as the worst criminals and as a --a sort of\ntr-trying to undermine the German nation. Yeah. For example, one incident in -- in the apartment\nbuilding where we lived, the -- the beautiful one where we had that large apartment, there were\nonly two parties on each floor. And on the same floor there was another couple, the husband was\nalso a lawyer, but they were Aryans, I mean Germans and they had a daughter, just one, single\nchild, a daughter my sister's age. And the grandmother, one of the grandmother also lived with\nthem. And my sister and that girl were very close friends, they played together, and of course\nthey went to school together then, when they came to school and so on. And one day the girl told\nmy sister that her grandmother had forbade her from now on, to have a Jewish friend. So she is\nsorry, but she can't come over any more and can't have her over. You know, things like that.\nThen, each apartment building was assigned a Nazi party, sort of representative for that building\nand the man who was the representative in our building, for example, made it a point, whenever\nwe crossed paths, see, in the house entrance, in the elevator or wherever, to ostensibly sort of\nlook in a very hostile way and ignoring us, not greeting us. And a few other tenant, not all of\nthem, but a few other tenants followed suit. Then, as the 30's wore on and the Nazis really started\nopenly to prepare for war, they also started an extensive air raid protection system, with building\nair raid shelters in basements and so on. And one of the early orders was that Jews are not\npermitted to join the other tenants in an air raid shelter. So we had to go -- ea-each tenant also\nhad a little lockable area, sort of separated by -- by wooden planks, to store things, for storage.\nAnd we had to sit in there like pariahs, while the rest of the tenants walked by there into their air\nraid shelter, which was, you know with benches and so on. And there was -- I mean there were\nconstant speeches, of course, which were insulting and hostile to us and -- and people, even\npeople who were not ill-meaning, felt that it was dangerous even, to be seen -- to associate with\nJews. And then there were, they had frequent Nazi holidays or other holidays. They u -- every\nopportunity they -- then there were the Olympic games and so on. And o-of each time they made\na big fuss about marches. That -- that was sort of one of their favorite activities. SS units, SA\nunits, Hitler youth units, would march, you know, looking really snappy and snifty, with flags\nflying and with bands playing and singing their songs. And it was sort of, in retrospect, almost\nlike a -- almost continuous holiday atmosphere and by that time of course, as the 30's went on,\neverybody was employed. You know, Germany had a tremendous unemployment rate before, as\npart of the world wide great depres-depression. And of course they were all employed, basically\nre-arming Germany, but we didn't know it at that time. But, I mean, that was the thi -- that's --\nthat's how they solved the unemployment problem and also their own military, what they\nconceived as inferiorit-inferiority, and --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, well actually, I went to two events. I went -- one was the final for the gold medal of\nsoccer. I went with my mother, she -- my mother was very interested in sports, my father\ncouldn't have cared less. So she went with me and the final game was between Italy and Austria\nand it was a very exciting game, they were, at that time, the power houses in -- 1n -- 1n soccer.\nAnd actually Germany also had a pretty good team, but was already out of the running by that\ntime. And what happened 1s the -- at that time of course, Austria was still an independent\ncountry, otherwise they wouldn't have had a team. And -- but the Germans of course, felt kinship\nwith the Austrians, so the -- the stadium sort of rooted for the -- for the Austrians. The Italians\nhad bought, sort of blocks, large blocks of seats, where they were sitting in their black Fascist\nuniforms and were waving Italian flags and they must have had some sort of a cheerleader. They\nwould -- at -- at some particular moment, maybe when Italy was on a drive, they would jump up,\nlike on a command and shout, I mean in Italian, \u201cItalia, Italia, Italia,\u201d and waving their flags.\nAnd then the rest of the stadium would thunder back, \u201c\u201cUstarashe, Ustarashe,\u201d is the German\nword for Austria. \u201c\u201cUstarashe, Ustarashe.\u201d So it was that constant back and forth between these\nblocks of Italians who shouted Italia and most of the rest of the stadium shouting Ustarashe. And",
        "A: No, th-that was an excite -- that was an excite -- excite, I mean of course there were political\nundertones, but I mean, Italy was, by that time already, an ally of Germany, so there was no, it\nwasn't as if say Britain had been, you know then the --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, I mean --",
        "A: Yeah I-I mean that was, I mean, incredible. First of all, they -- they toned down somewhat,\ntheir antisemitism. That was probably on pressure from the west, although there wasn't much of\nthat pressure as far as I can see. But the whole city was sort of -- was first of all renovated. The --\nthe -- the elevated lines got totally new trains. You know, it's that line that ran by that synagogue\nalso, that was burned down a few years later. And -- and in fact those -- those cars are still 1n use\nnow, that is now 60 years later. Unbelievable. I mean now they -- they look worn and so on. And\n-- and several stations, like the -- in -- in central Berlin and -- and -- and western Berlin, the\ncentral station is -- 1s a zoo station, because it's near the zoo. And that was totally rebuilt and --\nand lots of other things, I mean were done to the city. I mean -- I mean the Nazis used that --\nwent all out of their way and -- and the interesting -- when I came to this country, and went to\ncollege here, in the year 1949, so that was only 13 years after the Olympics. I was at a small\ncollege in Missouri, where I had a scholarship. Southwest Missouri State College, in Springfield,\nMissouri. And my German t -- not my German, she was a German professor there, a woman and\nI-I was actual -- at her request, I was active in the German club. Ther-There was a club for\nstudents who wanted to major in German and practice German and -- and she had asked me to go\nthere too, so they can sort of converse with me in German. And then I often talked with her also,\nand she said she was in Germany in '36 to the Olympics. At that time she was a young, I don't\nknow, whatever, assistant professor or something and -- and she said she was impressed -- the --\nthe courtesy, the -- the -- we -- how well everything was planned, the efficiency and also the\nparty, the party hogans were also enlisted. They were all very nice, you know, the-they -- it -- it's\nfairly hard for people to understand. I mean y -- you can -- you could, even SS officers and\nsometimes the most brutal types, could be very charming and courteous and polite and they were\nall double faced and -- so the Olympic games, from that point of view, were a huge success, I\nmean. And of course, also, Germany did very well, I mean the Nazis had a tremendous system of\nphysical training and -- and sports facilities and so on and I think in medals they won that game,\nfar -- at least they claimed to, I forgot the details. But anyway, coming back to that soccer game,\nthey -- the way soccer was played at that time at least, it was a draw at the official end of the\ngame and I think it was one to one. And then the rule was that the game is extended until sudden\ndeath. In other words, one party shoots a goal and that ends the game and that party of course\nthen wins. And -- And it was Italy that shot that additional goal, so it was two to one for Italy,\nand they got the gold medal and the Austrians got the silver then. But my father was -- my -- my\nmother was very interested in -- in sports, though not just spectator sports, but she did a lot also\nto entice me to -- I was originally totally averse to any sports, I didn't like it and often was afraid\nof things and she had a tremendous energy and -- and sort of practically forced me how -- to\nlearn how to swim, to ski and to skate, I mean ice skate and bicycle. And I do most of these\nthings -- for swimming I don't care too much anymore. I find it too boring just to swim bac-back\nand forth in a lap, but -- but I mean, I-I'm able to swim and -- but I-I still love skiing and --",
        "A: Yeah. Incidentally, the Olympics was the first occasion when I saw Hitler in person. We -- we\nlived -- the street we lived on in that ap-apartment was the major east - west sort of boulevard,\nthat cut through, it started at the center of Berlin, actually near the Rice chancellery and then\nwent for several miles, to the western outskirts where we lived. And the Olympic stadium was\nalso near where we lived, so Hitler passed by there on -- on opening day to open the games. And\nof course, his trip out to the Olympic stadium itself, was planned as a big theater. They had the\nstreets lined with enthusiastic crowds and SS, sort of in -- information, holding them back. And\nthen Hitler would ride in an open Mercedes-Benz, in uniform, standing stiffly upright and\nperiodically raising his right arm to the Hitler salute, greeting the masses. And as I stood on the\nbalcony, just looking straight down at Hitler, the thought occurred to me how easy it would be\njust to assassinate him from here. The next time I saw him, was exact -- about a year later, when\nMussolini played his state visit to Berlin in 1937. And in fact, during that state visit, the Berlin-\nRome axis was sort of cemented. And Mussolini, the arrangement was also for them to ride into\ntown, so in the opposite direction now, from the -- from a suburban railroad station, which was in\nfact just half a mile away from where our house was. And then they rode into town, again\ngreeting the masses that were lined up behind rows of SS. And there was an interesting contrast.\nHitler, the unsmiling, stiff despot and Mussolini, the typical, jovial Italian. He also raised his\nhand, but he raised it in a much more informal way. He -- his mouth was widely open and -- and\nlaughing and smiling and his body would sort of -- in body language, wave back and forth from\none side to the other, acknowledging crowds on both sides. Was a tremendous difference in the\nappearance of these two dictators. I'm not trying to make Mussolini appear any -- like a nice\nuncle, but there was a tremendous difference between these two men, both were equally brutal.\nIn -- in summary, I mean, I-I must say that I -- th-the years in the 30's, leading up to World War\nTwo and the Holocaust, I felt, I mean basically like an outsider, like b-being, I mean pushed\naway from the main body and from all the festivities that the Germans enjoyed, from which I\nwas excluded. But on the other hand, I had found my inner Jewish belonging, mainly as a result\nof the school that I went to and which gave me inner strength and to some extent compensated\nfor that. One final remark I would like to make concerning the question of the deportations. The\ndeportations of course, were ordered by the Gestapo and go back directly to an order by\nHeidrish, who was ordered by Hitler, was given by Hitler the -- the order to carry this out. But\nthe -- at the local level, the deportations were organized by the Jewish community organizations.\nAnd of course that has been a big problem ever since it happened. For -- for me personally, I felt\n-- first of all, totally abandoned, I must say, by the -- knowing that the Jewish organizations were\norganizing the transports. Infer it got to the point where I actually considered the leadership of\nthe Ricefinegunk -- that was the sort of umbrella organization of Jews in Germany -- I\nconsidered them as part of the enemy and they had to be considered that way. On the other hand,\nof course, we know now much more, there were very difficult moral decisions and there were\nvery difficult also, options available. I certainly would never want to be in a position to make\nthose choices. But it -- but th-th-th-the fact remains that for me at the time, I -- I felt really as\nbeing abandoned by my own leadership and -- and -- and it -- it probably needs to be considered\nmore deeply now, where we have some distance, what the options were that these people had and\nwhat they could have done, other than what they actually did.",
        "A: Yeah, briefly, my first priority was to get on with my education and I immediately enrolled in\nthe technical university in Berlin and then later took courses also in the main university, or\nHumboldt University, as that was then renamed, li -- taking lectures in mathematics, physics and\nso on. There were many famous professors who had still survived the war. And of course there --\nthere were then also a number of Jews who had returned, or some of them actually had survived\nin Berlin as -- as mixed -- children of mixed marriages. You know, where one parent was Gentile\nand the other one was Jewish. And of course there was a large number of German army veterans.\nAnd that in fact, was a very sore point. Many of them were still very nationalistic, in spite of that\nhu-huge defeat. So I-I-I enrolled in those courses and actually Margaret's mother immediately\nopened a sort of office, on her own, for social help for Jews returning from concentration camps.\nAnd she worked closely together with the American official who was in charge of that borough,\nTemplehoff. A -- I think a captain or major Davidhoff, or Davidhoff. It turns out supposedly, that\nthat man was a Communist and was then later rotated out and sent home. And when -- when the\nfirst possibility arose for emigrating to the United States, that was in '46 and we registered, it\nturned out that Margaret's mother somehow was on the black list, because she had closely\ncollaborated, and that Major Davidho-Davidhoff also for example, was helpful in providing\napartments for returning Jews and etcetera, etcetera. And so we were, for about a year, subjected\nto a lot of chicanery by the American consulate. I remember th-the consul himself was a Mr.\nHaney and -- who was a very unpleasant character and I was once, I'm sure on -- on his orders,\nalthough I can't prove it, interrogated by an officer of the CIC. The CIC is the army's criminal\ninvestigation commission or some -- and -- and that interrogation took place in the following\nway, that the interrogating officer sat behind a desk and next to him was a growling German\nShepherd, who was there just to intimidate me and they wanted to know, you know, about I --\nwanted me to incriminate Margaret's parents, basically, as -- as Communists. And -- you know\nand when I -- when I couldn't say anything incriminating, you know he -- he let me go, finally.\nBut he -- it was a very unpleasant interview, or interrogation is the better word. I did receive,\nfinally, my visa, but the Haas family did not and at that point, since we had lived through thick\nand thin through the war, I decided to let my visa lapse, even though I was told by the -- and I\ntold the consul I will go when the others will go. The consul said that there's no guarantee that I\nwill ever get my visa renewed if I let 1t lapse once. And -- and I had an uncle here in the United\nStates who also implored me to -- to come -- to come and let -- wait here for them. Anyway -- by\nthe way, that's a interesting thing, my -- my first connection to -- to friends, you know there was\nno postal connection, of course, between Germany and any country outside. So we went to --\nthere was a huge barracks of American soldiers near where we lived and I remember I went to\nthe guard soldier outside and asked whether he could tell me whether there was a Jewish soldier\nsomewhere. It's such an outlandish idea. So -- so he directed me, pointed to some particular room\nand there was a Sergeant Roth, R-o-t-h. So I went to that Roth and told him who I was and that I\nsurvived and -- and I had a-an address of a school friend in Connecticut and my uncle. And --\nand -- and actually I didn't -- he was in New York, but I didn't have his exact address, but I had\nsome connecting address in London, who could then forward it. And -- and so he also conversed\nwith me, that Roth and he -- he asked me where -- he -- no, he didn't ask me, he warned me not\nto try to emigrate to the United States because there are -- were already too many Jews there and\n-- and was rising antisemitism and now that the Nazis were gone and the war was over, 1t would\nbe much better for me also if I stayed in Germany. And I found that so unbelievably\npreposterous, he was an American Jew, telling me not to come here. But anyway, I didn't follow\nhis advice, but what he did do, is he di -- he did forward my mail and the letter that I read to my\nschool friend, wound up as an article, he submitted it -- there's a German-Jewish weekly called\n\u201cOufbow.\u201d By now it's a biweekly. And it was published in there and -- and my -- my uncle then\nalso f -- supported me. Finally we did get visas. Th-The joint was extremely helpful there, they --\nthe joint opened offices in Berlin and with their help, the three of us finally got visas and we\narrived here on the 22nd of June, 1947. And -- and then my -- my first priority again here, was to\nstudy.\nEnd of Tape Eight, Side A\nBeginning of Tape Eight, Side B",
        "A: Yeah. After my arrival, my first priority, as I said, was to continue my studies. My uncle\nprovided the financial support in the beginning, for a-a few months. And then -- I lived in New\nYork then. He had rented for me a furnished room in the upper West Side. And then I took a job\nas a messenger boy on 48th -- West 48th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, for an outfit\ncalled Action Messenger Service. We were a whole bunch of young guys who were lined up and\nthe boss would always call one after the other to run certain errands. For me that was great, that's\nhow I got to know New York. I -- he sent me to one address to pick up a package to be delivered\nto a second address and I got to know New York from downtown Wall Street to midtown and\neven further uptown and I really fell in love with the city at that time. In the evening -- and by --\nincidentally, I earned 50 cents an hour. And in the evening, I took two or three courses, I forgot,\nin City College. And -- and I took some elementary physics, which I already had in Germany,\njust in order to get up to speed also with the English language and with the technical expressions.\nAnd I also had a course in calculus, which I -- also mostly was just review of what I had already\nlearned in Germany. And I -- my goal, of course, was to become a full-time student and\nfinancially that wouldn't have been possible for me. So through a friend of mine, I was referred\nto a committee with the interesting name, American Committee for Emigr\u00e9 Writers, Scholars and\nArtists. And was sort of an interesting outfit. Basically what they did is this, they did not have\nany money themselves, they served as a clearing house for available grants, fellowships and so\non. So I registered with them and after, I forgot what it was, a few months -- I should say also, I\nhad only A's from my first two semesters in City College, so that obviously helped along. And\nthey told me that they had a Rotary international scholarship for Southwest Missouri State\nCollege, in Springfield, Missouri. I never heard of the place before and of course I didn't know at\nthat time that there were such huge disparities between different academic institutions. But\nanyway, I went there and I credit my two years in Springfield, Missouri and at that college,\nmainly with my Americanization. And one thing that bothered me in New York is that the only\nsocial contact I had was not just with other German Jews, but mainly only with Berlin Jews.\nFormer Berlin Jews I should say, I should say. But -- and I realized that if I want to become\nacculturated in my new country, I can't just have as -- a social life only with people from the old\ncountry. And -- but it was very difficult in City College, leadto -- I tried several times\nunsuccessfully. It's a commuter college, people come, take classes and rush away. Go back into\nthe subway and go to Brooklyn or God knows where. And so it's not really a campus\natmosphere. So when I got that scholarship, I took a train off to Springfield, Missouri and yeah --\nand I should say that my friends, the Haas family, they --after some initial difficulty, settled in --\nin New York and Margaret's father got several jobs, improving as time went on, in the garment\nindustry as designer, pattern maker and so on, in ladies garments. Of course we stayed in contact\nas I went to Springfield. And there I was received by the dean, who felt that 1t would be a good\nidea if I would be put -- housed in the barracks, which had been built on campus for GI's. That\nwas the time of the GI Bill of Rights, after World War Two and there was such an influx of\nstudents that they needed to do something to -- to house them. And so th-these barracks were\nbuilt. They were relatively primitive, but as far as I was concerned, totally sufficient. And of\ncourse, there I learned all the slang that I hadn't learned in all my years of English in the German\nhigh school, including all the four letter words, which I hadn't known before. And -- and in\ngeneral got sort of acculturated to life in a small, Midwestern town. As the -- coincidence would\nhave it, also the -- the dean, right away set me in touch with the local rabbi. And it turned out that\nrabbi also was a form-former German Jew. He was -- he wa -- had been rabbi in the Bavarian\ncity of Oxbourg before the war and now he was rabbi in Springfield, Missouri and he and his\nfamily took me somewhat under their wings. I -- I was often invited to Shabbat evening dinners\nat their house and obviously each time for the Seder. And so I lived with them -- but -- not lived\nwith, I mean I socialized with them and on the other hand, I also had American contacts and I\neven made dates with American girls. And so -- and -- and my school performance turned out to\nbe very well. I did very well in all classes, so when I graduated then in -- in 1950, with a\nBachelor's Degree, I got an offer, actually several offers, but the one that I accepted for graduate\nschool was from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Admission to graduate school,\nplus a guaranteed sort of teaching assistantship in the physics department. And so, in the summer\nof 1950 isa, I got my Bachelor's Degree. That was in July, but I remained a bachelor then for less\nthan a month. But o-on the sixth of August, Margaret and I finally got married. And that was in\nNew York and -- and then we moved together to -- to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where I started\nmy graduate studies. That graduate studies turned out, unfortunately extended for more years\nthan I had originally anticipated, and is customary, for a number of reasons. I had some bad luck\nwith my first thesis subject and so on, but I don't want to go into that here now, but I -- 0-of\ngeneral interest is maybe that in the s -- in the -- in my first summer there, 1t was the summer of\n'51, I had a summer job at Bethlehem Steel Company, which is in the same city as Lehigh\nUniversity. And the company -- 1n fact the steel plant, I think the company still exists, but the\nsteel plant doesn't exist anymore. But I saw a steel plant from the inside and I found all of that\nvery interesting. How steel is being made and so on. And then two years later, in '53, I had a\nsummer job at White Sands proving ground. That was a rocket proving ground before anyone\neven knew that the United States was deeply involved in rocketry. At that time, they just shot --\nshot captured German V2 rockets. And some clever physicist had gotten the idea to -- while\nthese rockets are being shot with harmless warheads, just to test their flight characteristics, why\nnot put some instruments on the -- in -- in the warhead, to measure properties in the upper\natmosphere, ionosphere. And actually I was hired partly to write a sort of research paper on\ncertain aspects on how to detect cosmic rays. And so that filled my summer and I didn't realize at\nthat time, that in fact space physics would at one time become my life's profession. In 1954, the\nfollowing summer, I spent -- I had a special fellowship for -- to Brookhaven, the national\nlaboratory, which at that time was the foremost laboratory for -- 1n the world, not only this\ncountry, for high energy physics. And th-there was a machine that could accelerate particles to\nunheard of -- at that time -- energies, and cause all kinds of interesting effects and collisions.\nAnd I worked with some famous physicists there, I -- I met, among others there, Enrico Fermi,\nwho -- the famous Italian physicist and Nobel prize winner and several others. And -- and then I-\nI wrote a f -- a thesis, back at Lehigh University in a fairly esoteric, purely mathematical subject\nin theoretical physics, involving fundamental particles and -- and field theory. I graduated in\n1960 and by that time already, we had two children. I-I-I should have mentioned that after we\nmarried, in August 1950 and moved to Bethlehem, Margot worked for a number of years in an\noffice and in 1955, she was pregnant with our son, Claude, who was born in August, '55 and --\nand then in -- in O-October '59, our daughter Eva was born. And in '60, she was less than a year\nold, we moved from Bethlehem to Ann Arbor, Michigan. And in Ann Arbor, I have worked --\nactually I was for two years in the radiation laboratory and the radiation laboratory sort of started\nto fold and go downhill. And then I obtained an offer from the space physics research laboratory\nin 1962, where I -- I stayed until my retirement in 1992. I -- during that time I had a also varied,\ninteresting career. I attended many international meetings, including one in 1971, in Moscow,\nwhich interested me very much. I-I should add, incidentally, that I taught myself the Cyrillic\nalphabet during my two years -- postwar years in Berlin, from '45 to '47. Because the Russians\nimmediately after their arrival, one of the first things -- they put under the German street names,\nthe -- the name in R-Russian -- in Cyrillic letters, so that their soldiers could orient themselves in\nthe city. And simply by comparison and also by -- by knowing the Greek alphabet, which I knew\nfrom the gymnasium, I -- I could figure out the entire alphabet, so going to Moscow in -- in'71,\nat least I wasn't lost. I could read street names and so on. In '72 I attended an international\nconference in Warsaw, which -- an-and just shortly before that time, I had read several diaries\nand reports about Warsaw ghetto, including the uprising. And the visit to Warsaw was a\nemotionally very shattering experience for me. I -- I spent every free minute that I was not at the\nmeeting, walking around the streets of the ghetto and -- which I all knew, from the books and --\nthat I'd read. And -- and observed and of course -- this is well known, the ghetto was totally\ndestroyed by the Germans after they captured it and -- and then the Poles completely leveled\neverything that was left and then built sort of a worker's apartment in a style which I call\nSocialist Modern. Which means modern lines, but shoddy construction. And -- and I-I just\nwalked through the streets and in my mental eye, saw in front of me, the Jews who lived there,\nonly a few years before. It was there 30 years later that I was there, which is nothing, in history.\nIn -- in '70, let me see, in '78 I spent a year, I'm sorry, I spent a summer in Paris. I -- a --a former\nstudent of mine actually, w-who got his PhD u-under my supervision in the late '60's. Was a\nFrench fellow, with whom I had an also personal friendship and we stayed in touch and he was\nprobably one of my most successful students. He -- by now he 1s director of a big laboratory in\nToulouse, but at that time he was already head of a group and he invited me to spend the summer\nof '78 there and I went there with Margot and our daughter Eva, who at that time -- '78, what was\nshe doing then? She must have been a college freshman. And -- and that was marv -- we lived\nreally like -- like French people. We rented a furnished apartment and Margaret and Eva, during\nthe day, went of course to visit museums and sights around the streets and -- and on weekends\nwe did things together. It was a -- one of m -- the best summers we had. And in '76, by the way, I\nhad a summer position at the space physics laboratory of the University of California and\nBerkeley. That was where we -- we made a cross country trip by car, which is the only way to\nsee this country, 1s really by driving through it. It's fascinating how the landscape changes, the\narchitecture changes and so on. And on the fourth of July, actually -- we -- we first visited\nfriends in San Diego and Los Angeles and on the fourth of July we drove up from L.A. to -- to\nSan Francisco. And of course the fourth of July is Independence Day, obviously and in '76 it was\nthe 200th anniversary of the United States. But in addition to that, 1t was also the day where\nIsraeli commandos liberated the prisoners in Entebbe. And we were driving along and listening\nto the radio, you know, just for diversion, when suddenly a newsflash came on that Israeli\ncommandos had liberated the passengers of a -- I think it was an Air France plane with Israeli\nand also other citizens on it. And so that was a perfect way for us to celebrate Independence Day.\nAnd -- and then in the evening, after we arrived in Berkeley, we were told that already ahead of\ntime, that there's always a big firework over San Francisco Bay and the best way to view it is\nfrom the -- from the eastern side of the bay, from Berkeley, in other words, th-the space physics\nlab is on -- on -- on a -- on a mountain where also the radiation lab is located. And it was a\ntremendous experience to see the fireworks over San Francisco Bay on the fourth of July, 1976.\nWell --",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: Yes. I mean, it had a tremendous impact and in fact the impact increased as the years went by.\nI -- I mean the fact that my parents, my sister and my first girlfriend, plus innumerable other\npeople I knew or I didn't know, just vanished and were brutally murdered because of some\nunbelievable ideology which somebody cooked up, is so unna -- it -- it -- it's even for me today\nnot understandable, how that could have happened. And I have been sort of totally more and\nmore absorbed by it as the year went by. I -- I read -- I have, I mean innumerable books, some of\nthem I haven't even read yet, on the Holocaust. I mean starting with the standard works by -- by\nHillburg and what's her name? Yahyah Hill, the Israeli Estroyen and also Lucy Davidovitch and\nso on. But in addition to that, all kinds of -- of special works by authors on special subjects like\nthe Warsaw ghetto. I own a number of diaries, including Rhea Blumes, notes and -- and on -- on\n-- also on -- on -- on German Jews and I -- of course fascinated particularly by the fate of -- of\nGerman Jews, because that's what I am and I was totally raised in Germany and -- and how that\ncould have happened, of all countries, in that country, is something that I -- I have wrestled with\nall the -- for years and years and have not really come to a conclusion. What it really was that\ngave rise to this unbelievable crime and you know that was com -- also it was committed by\npeople who were mostly highly educated and although there were some uneducated at the lower\nlevels, but at the higher levels they were of -- Goebbels was a PhD and -- and -- and many other\npeople and -- who -- who are not that well known, but were in high positions, were highly\neducated. And to plan a mass murder on that scale and carry it out is -- 1s totally mind boggling\nand so -- and -- and then another thing is that the fate of my immediate family 1s -- I'm -- I'm\ntrying to picture my father, even on the -- on the de -- on the deportation train. I mean how -- I-I-\nI mean going into such de-detail as y-you know that each -- each railroad car where people were\ntransported and they were basically freight or cattle cars, had just -- somewhere -- big bucket\nwhere people could relieve themselves. I couldn't -- I can't even believe how -- how anyone\nwould even be able to relieve themself in public, with everybody standing around, in a bucket in\nthe middle. The -- the idea, to humiliate Jews to such an unbelievable extent and how my father\neven -- an-and then, on the day that they left, the temperatures were -- I mean Berlin in winter\nwas anyway cold, I think now it's not as cold any more, but at that time 1t was much colder, but\nthat was an unusually cold day, even for that time. I-I checked the meteorological records again,\nto -- and have that at home, actually. And to -- to -- to reconfirm, that was just my memory, but it\n-- were extremely cold days j -- and of course the cars were unheated and -- and how my family\nwas treated after they arrived in Auschwitz, or that they went to Auschwitz, that is a matter of\nrecord. And my friend Ruth, I think, was deported to Riga and from -- but I -- from what little I\nknow, it may have happened that they were immediately transported by truck into some forest\nand shot. And s-so I-I have been -- as the years went by I have more and more occupied myself\nwith that. For example, I was instrumental in Ann Arbor, to start a annual sort of observance of\nYom HaShoah, which has been now going on for over 10 years. And I was also involved -- Ann\nArbor has a statue now, commemorating the Holocaust, where I was involved in -- both in\nraising the money and in getting the idea through, it's a -- the -- the artist who made the statue is\nLeonard Baskin, who, by the way, also made one of the statues of the new FDR memorial here.\nAnd so I'm -- J-I must say that I am -- m-my -- yeah then -- did you ask me how I raised m --\nwhat affect of raising my children and -- and in two ways. First of all, I have always talked to\nthem about that period and -- and in -- in 1981 in fact, that was when our son graduated from --\nfrom law school in Michigan and our daughter was actually still a year away from -- from\ngraduation, but we proposed sort of for them, a joint graduation gift, that's a trip to Europe, sort\nof as students like to do it, sort of to bum around. They could select where they wanted to go,\nsort of and you know, hos -- youth hostels and so on, with one proviso. In'81, I was at an\ninternational meeting, I think in June or so, in Edinburgh, Scotland. And I-I suggested that we\nmeet in Berlin on -- on a certain week, so that Margot and I could show them where we grew up,\nrespectively and also where we went to school and other places of relevance to -- in our lives.\nAnd so that's what we did, we actually -- after -- from Edinburgh, you know, we flew to Berlin.\nThe kids had already left earlier. They had decided first to make a brief swing through parts of\nScandinavia, they were in Copenhagen, then southern Sweden, okay and then they went into\nBerlin. We met there and spent a week there and we -- we sh -- went also to the cemetery where\nsome of our forebears, gros grandparents and so on, are buried. And some famous German Jews.\nIn Germany the gravestones are also more, sort of descriptive, I mean you can really see who\nsomebody was. I mean it explains -- somebody may have been professor of this or that at this\nuniversity or -- or may have been an architect or whatever. Anyway -- and -- and then -- the rest\nof the time they continued then, on their own. So, coming back to your question, I mean I -- I\nsaw to it, but I also w-we wanted to make them also very conscious of their Jewish heritage and\nMargot and I often feel, that in that respect maybe we didn't do too great a job. We had -- we sort\nof totally relied -- we are members of a conservative synagogue and of course, you know, money\nconstraints being what they are, they can't really hire first rate teachers, so they usually use\ncollege students who come from more or less religious homes, to teach sort of the standard\nthings in elementary Hebrew and Biblical history and so on. But they still, they are -- our\ndaughter now even, is taking now here a course in basics of Judaism, I think, at the DCJCC.",
        "A: Oh, okay.",
        "A: Yes. Okay, that -- thank you for raising that question. I was -- I-I was never only concerned\nexclusively with the Jewish faith, although this is obviously the one that's closest to me, but I\nwas always appalled, I mean for example, also, with the treatment of blacks here in this country,\nor Afro-Americans. And I-I have been always quite active in -- in -- in Ann Arbor there. I mean\ntoday\u2019s -- seems long ago, but there was at one time strict housing segregation and there was a\nlarge group in which I was involved, for passage of city ordinances, to make such segregation\nillegal, particularly by real estate agents, loan practices by banks and so on. And I took the\nchildren sometimes along to demonstrations, I mean just to -- and they are both -- both of our\nchildren -- E-Eva, our daughter, is involved now in the Hunger Coalition here, which\nincidentally my wife is also very much involved, in Ann Arbor. And our son 1s involved with the\nAnti-defamation League and such organizations. So we always instilled in them that it is\nimportant for everybody to work for equality, not just for yourself or your own group, but for all\ngroups.",
        "A: Very, very seldom, I have some dreams or some thoughts. I mean I -- I just recently, when I\nwoke up earlier in the morning than I-I should have probably, I thought of that incident with that\ncivilian police guy who stopped me on the subway and where I ask myself the question, what if\nmy assessment was wrong and my lingering around there would have caused him -- he could\nhave, any time while I was at that newspaper kiosk, pretending to look at newspapers, he could\nhave tapped on my shoulder and said, \u201cWhy don't you come along, I want to ask you some more\nquestions.\u201d And then, that would have been the end of me. And -- and sort of I elaborated on that\nin my fantasies. I w --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Oh, no.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well actually, it's not a memory, it's sirens -- for two reasons. First of all, they signaled air\nraids, but they also, you know my father was basically abducted, that's what the correct word for\nthat would have been. And normally, you would call the police and -- and they would come with\ntheir sirens blaring and whenever I hear sirens, particularly in a police car, sometimes I've\nactually -- tears are welling, thinking of it. They should have come and rescued my parents, they\nwere being abducted in broad daylight. And -- and I visited -- I visited by now, Auschwitz four\ntimes and that is also a -- something I still have not come to -- to grips with. But in general, I --\nin my day to day life, fortunately, I have not had any, I mean to my knowledge at least, any sort\nof real strong emotional effects of, I mean like you say, not wanting to ride subways or things.",
        "A: Yeah. I mean actually, o-one thing that I wanted to say and forgot, that in one of the earlier\ntapes, I think I made some mistakes in two dates. One is that highacoo -- high school friend of\nmine, at one point I said -- left Berlin to emigrate to England on January 18, 1938. Now, in\ncontext that of course could not have been in -- in -- as I explained at the time. His parents were\nAustrians and in January '38, Austria still was an independent country. Ex-Excuse me. Austria\nwas occupied in March '38 and so then they lost their protection. And he left Ger -- actually\nBerlin on January 18, '39. In other words, about three quarters of a year after Austria lost its\nindependent. The second date correction, the arrest of my girlfriend Ruth. I said at one time, it's\nNovember 9, '41. That -- also th -- in November -- I-I'm sorry, September 9, '41, I said. The first\ndeportation left Berlin only at the end of September '41 and she was deported on September 9,\n'42, not '41. I mean that's just -- it doesn't change anything, but to correct the misstatement.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: Yeah. I would think really two or three things. One of them is that there 1s a lot of basic value\nin Judaism and that it's sort of incumbent on us to really familiarize ourselves with it. I mean\nthere -- for many Jews in this country, there has been sort of -- the Holocaust has been treated\nalmost like a substitute religion, particularly in recent years and I think that is almost sick. I think\nthe Holocaust must be remembered, of course, but not as a -- in the sense of a religion, but in the\nsense that we, first of all should remember always, just like we remember other events in our\nhistory, going back to Masada, to the destruction of the two temples and so on and also to learn\nfrom it. Learn what to do and also what not to do. The other thing is, that aside from Judaism, I --\nI also don't believe that one should be focused 100 percent on one's Judaism. Like I know there\nare such Jews, but that since we are living in a -- in a broader world, that it 1s also the duty of\neveryone to involve him or herself in the daily politics. To fight for what is right and to fight for\n-- ag-against injustice, also against other groups. I think that is -- that is one thing th-th-that is\nimportant, I mean the -- there is a famous, by now it's a clich\u00e9, quote -- I think it is from the\nGerman, \u201cPustor Nimala.\u201d At -- at first they came after the Communists -- I mean the Nazis, I\ndidn't particularly care because I wasn't a Communist. Then they went after the Jews and didn't\nb-bother me either, I'm not a Jew. Then they went after homosexuals and didn't bother me, I'm\nnot a homosexual. Then they went after Catholics, that didn't bother me and when they came\nafter me, there was nobody left.",
