        "Q: Did you hear anything, or were your parents talking?",
        "A: Yes, we knew everything in Greece. As a matter of fact, most of the Greeks were against it --\nagainst Germany, and against the dic-dictatorship, especially my city, that even in 1933, as far as\nI can remember, had a Communist mayor.",
        "Q: So what do you remember? What were some of your earliest impressions, what you heard at\nthat time?",
        "A: Everything that was happening to the Jews in Germany, and we were very much worried\nabout it.",
        "Q: And did you hear a few years later, in 1938, did you hear anything about Kristallnacht?",
        "A: Yes, we knew about everything, and more or less we were ready, because we knew that\nGreek\u2019s turn was coming, that one way or the other, we\u2019ll be invaded.",
        "Q: How did you get the information? Was it through radio, or how were you learning things?",
        "A: Through radio, through free newspapers, through contacts with the outside. We were free to\nvo -- to -- to travel, where there were no restrictions at all. We were free people, and we\u2019re very\nhappy people. We had also a ki -- a king who is so pro-Jewish. And the -- the government nek --\nnever took any measures against the Jews or made any discrimination. As a matter of fact, we\nhad at the Greek congress, a Jewish representative, and also a Jewish senator.",
        "Q: But you did feel some concern that maybe some of these anti-Jewish measures might\neventually come to Greece. Did your family ever talk about wanting to leave Greece?",
        "A: No, we never thought of leaving Greece, except 1938, when we decided to come to the United\nStates. But as I told you before, we were aware what\u2019s happening all around the world, we were\nvery much worried about the problems in Palestine where the Arabs has revolted against England\nand against the Jews. We knew what was happening the Jews of -- of Germany, and we had\ndecided at the time maybe it was time to come to the States. What did happen is that we got our\nquota for our -- or our visa to come to the United States 1939, and at that time the war had started\nalready, so we couldn\u2019t move any more.",

        "A: I went to Athens in October 1939.",
        "Q: So this is after the war began?",
        "A: No, it was before the war. The war in Greece started in 1940.",
        "Q: I-I\u2019m sorry, I wanted to just talk about for a moment, just the beginning of World War II with\nPoland.",
        "A: They just -- the war had started in Poland already.",
        "Q: And what did you hear and what did you know about that?",
        "A: Now we were always talking and were always very, very enthusiastic and hopeful that the\nFrench and the British would take good care of the Germans.",
        "Q: So then it\u2019s October, you said, of \u201939 when you left for Athens?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And tell me what you were going off to Athens to do?",

        "Q: Did you know what kind of doctor you wanted to be?",
        "A: No. The first year the main thing that we learned was anatomy and chemistry. It was a\npreliminary for the medical profession.",
        "Q: And did you ha -- were there other Jewish students with you at medical school?",
        "A: There was only one Jewish student with me at medical stool -- school. The name was\nMittrani, and she was killed during the German occupation up in the Greek mountains, as a\npartisan.",
        "Q: And while you were in Athens did you -- was there any anti-Semitism there?",
        "A: Nothing at all. Nothing at all. What it was was a fear of the Greek -- of the war that was\ncoming very close to Greece. As a matter of fact, the year after, 1940, October 28\"\", 1940, the\nItalians attacked Greece. Greek defended -- Greece defended itself, and to a certain extent we\nwere able to win against the Italians. That prompted Germany, in April of 1941 to conquer the\nwhole of the [indecipherable]. And how you call -- and occupy Greece.",
        "Q: So what was -- what were you seeing and experiencing directly about all of this in Athens?",
        "A: In Athens, nothing. We were very happy, and we thought it\u2019Il never happen. As a matter of\nfact, it\u2019s well known historically that the night before the Italians attacked Greece, there was a\nbig party given by the Greek government where the ge -- the Italian ambassador was part of the\ncrowd.",
        "Q: But you were still in Athens, I believe, when -- did the Germans come into Athens, or --",
        "A: No. I left Athens in 1940 with -- when the war started against the Italians. The Germans came\nto Greece in 1941, six months later. The university was closed, there was no reason for me to\nstay in Athens.",
        "Q: I actually thought that you had stayed in Athens until the Germans came, but you didn\u2019t.",
        "A: No, I did not.",
        "Q: So you -- you had chosen -- the school had not yet closed, but you chose to leave?",
        "A: No, the school closed as soon as the Italians attacked, because almost everybody went to the\narmy, were drafted.",
        "Q: And you were not?",
        "A: No, I was not drafted, I was too young. To be drafted in Greece you have to be 21 years old,\nand at that time I was hardly 20.",
        "Q: So tell me what it was like when you returned. At that time did you return to Kavala?",
        "A: Yes. Everybody was afraid, everybody was making plans, and everybody was trying more or\nless, to save his family, to stay together.",
        "Q: So what happened next? You returned to Kavala and then what happened after that?",
        "A: After that the Germans came in, and we figure that Kavala was a very small city, we might as\nwell go to Salonika and we went to Salonika.",
        "Q: You made that decision after the Germans came in?",
        "A: My father made the decision, yes, after the Germans came. In 19 -- in April 1941 we went to\nSalonika. Salonika was occupied by the Germans already.",
        "Q: And what about -- had Kavala been occupied by the Germans?",
        "A: Well, the Germans divided Greece in three parts. Part of gre -- of Greece, the southern part\nwas given to the Italians. The northern part of was kept for the Germans and the part of the north\nof Greece that was an exit to medi -- t-to the Mediterranean was given to the Bulgarians, who at\nthe times were allied with the Germans. That was one of the reasons that everybug -- bu -- one\nwho could leave Kavala, left, because we were afraid to stay under the bulger -- Bulgarian\ngovernment.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Because there was an experience from World War I that the Bulgarians had occupied the city,\nand th-the -- 1-it was only torture and -- and -- and fear, and [indecipherable] killing people. So\neveryone who had an experience from before -- not us, before, in \u201921 we were not in Kavala, was\ntelling us what it means to be under the Bulgars. So we decided to go to Salonika.",
        "Q: So at that time you actually thought it may have been better to be under the Germans?",
        "A: We figured at the time we\u2019d much better to be in the Greeks -- in the big city so we\u2019d be more\nprotected.",
        "Q: And that was not just a fear of what the Bulgarians might do to the Jews, that was the general\npopulation\u2019s fear?",
        "A: No, no that was the fear that the Bulgarians insisted that this part of Macedonia belonged to\nthem, and we shoul -- we shouldn\u2019t be Greeks, we shouldn\u2019t speak Greek, we shouldn\u2019t have our\nown associations. We should turn around and more or less be like a -- like a secret police, and\ndenounce our fr -- our Greek friends. That we were not ready to do.",
        "Q: So describe to me what it was like when you arrived to Salonika and where did you live?",
        "A: We rented an apartment next to my uncle, and my father started from scratch all over again,\ndoing his business with the tobacco people.",
        "Q: And when was this that you made the move?",
        "A: We made the move in the end of April 1941.",
        "Q: And it was possible at that time for you to move around and do these things on your own?",
        "A: Yes, it was just the beginning of the occupation, moving was still free. I think the restrictions\ncame sometime in June of \u201941, but don\u2019t quote me, I\u2019m not sure about the date.",
        "Q: So in Salonika, tell me a little bit about the neighborhood there, was it a mostly Jewish\nneighborhood?",
        "A: Was mostly Jewish.",
        "Q: And can you give me a sense of the size of the Jewish community in Salonika?",
        "A: Well, I think at the time were about 70,000 Jews. It was a big community and more or less we\nhad our own neighborhoods without being a ghetto. We were free to move, we had Greek\nOrthodox living with us, but mostly were Jewish.",
        "Q: And do you remember the street where you lived?",
        "A: Yes, the name of the street was, street Saron de Poru 18, was exactly 1-1n front of the Salonika\nJewish community.",
        "Q: Yes. And what part of the -- is there a name to this district or part of Salonika that you lived\nin?",
        "A: Right now, I wouldn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: At that time?",
        "A: At that time nobody touched it til the deportations started.",
        "Q: So, what were the very first things that you were aware of that the Germans were doing in\nSalonika and specifically, you know, anti-Jewish meas -- measures.",
        "A: Re-Restriction of traveling. Taxes that we couldn\u2019t afford, restrictions in business, and the\nmost important, something that even today I cannot explain, there were about 150 German Jews\nthat\u2019s came to Salonika at the expense of the Jewish community that took over the functioning of\nthe community, where the community council was jailed.",
        "Q: Sorry, what was the last thing you said?",
        "A: Was the elected Jewish community council was jailed the t -- by the Germans, including the\nchief rabbi.",
        "Q: You\u2019re saying these were German Jews who already were living in Salonika?",
        "A: No, these were German Jews that came in Salonika after the German occupation and I still in\nmy mind say they were not Jewish, or they were part of a -- I don\u2019t know what, because we were\nforced to maintain them, to feed them, and when the deportations started, they were the shupos,\nthe -- the Jewish --",
        "Q: Jewish police?",
        "A: Jewish police that the German imposed.",
        "Q: Wa --",
        "A: They -- they didn\u2019t tou -- they did not touch them.",
        "Q: What was the name? Was there one?\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Nick\nLevi. This 1s tape number one, side B. Just want to continue to find out a little bit more from you\nabout your family\u2019s financial situation. How -- were you well off as a family?",
        "A: We was well off in [indecipherable]. My father had two associates who were Greek\nOrthodox, and one of them was very, very influential in the local government. As a matter of\nfact, in 1941, when the Germans were ready to attack Greece, my father was able, with his\nassociates, to rent a ship and transfer all our assets to Athens because we were sure that if\nsomething happens there, Athens will not be touched, will not be bombed. So our luck was that\nwhen the boat arrived in Piraeus -- the name of the boat Stiliani -- Piraeus was bombed, the boat\nwas sunk. All our asset were destroyed. We had insurance with Lloyd of London, however the\ninsurance was in Greek dol -- mon -- drachmas. So after the war, one billion Greek drachma\nwasn\u2019t even worth an dollar. So we lost everything.",
        "Q: When was this that this ship was taken with all your assets?",
        "A: In April 1941, when the gi -- Germans attacked Greece, they bombed the port of Piraeus,\nbecause it was an expeditionary force of British, who had come to help -- to help the Greeks. As\na matter of fact their stand was in Thermopylae and then they did [indecipherable] into Crete,\nand from Crete, when they lost Crete, they went back to [indecipherable]. So the Germans were\nbombing all the ports of Greece at the time, and our luck, which ship had to be sunk there.",
        "Q: Is this a very unusual story? Do you know other families who did anything like this?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s very, very unusual, because at that time to get a ship was more than [indecipherable],\nit was influence, and you know, having people help you.",
        "Q: So this was actually a ship full of money, your money?",
        "A: This was a ship with all our assets. In other words, all the merchandise that we had in Kavala,\nwe transferred to Athens and we were left without anything. That\u2019s why it\u2019s said when we went\nto Salonika, my father had to start from scratch because we were penniless.",
        "Q: Do you remember this being a very difficult time?",
        "A: Very. Very difficult because at that time is -- the only business in Greece was the black\nmarket. There was no food, there were no utilities, and everybody had to fend itself, and we used\nto live on coupons. But my father had many acquaintances from the past and he was able to start\nhis business all over again.",
        "Q: And he was doing the same kind of business in Salonika?",
        "A: Exactly the same business.",
        "Q: So, I asked you this a little bit before, but I was wondering if you remember more details\nabout the very earliest measures that the Germans took. You said there were restrictions on\nbusiness. If you remember any details --",
        "A: As soon as they came, there were restrictions on business, and restrictions 1n traveling, about\ntwo months after they came. In 1942, they started giving -- imposing taxes to the Jewish\ncommunity that was very hard to be kept -- to be. And then, on, as I told you, in July or August\n1942, we had the concentration at the Liberty Place, where people were cheated -- were t -- was,\nyou know, t -- tortured, and most of the yonkers -- youngsters were taken for hard works in the\nsouth of -- of Greece, and were separated from their families.",
        "Q: Can you -- can you walk me through a little bit more of the details of that incident, because it\nis a -- a Well known incident, and I want to know your memories. What do you first remember?\nWere you told that you had to go to this -- this place?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have to go personally. The people that I knew, my cousins, my parents, my friends,\nhad to go on a Saturday morning in this particular place, called Liberty Place, stand in the sun in\nAugust, for a whole day, beaten and humiliated, segregated, and then sent back home.",
        "Q: And how -- why was it that you did not have to go that day?",
        "A: Number one because of my age, and number two because as a Spanish citizen, I was neutral,\nand supposedly the Germans expected our neutrality.",
        "Q: Well, first of all, can you tell me what your age was at that time?",
        "A: 1941, I was 20 years o -- no, that was 1942, I was 21 years old.",
        "Q: And what were the -- so you said that the ages of the men who were brought there, what was\nthe ages?",
        "A: The ages was from 21 to 50.",
        "Q: I just want to back up a moment, because you referred to being a Spanish citizen.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you tell me, in whatever details you remember, when exactly did you get this citizenship?",
        "A: Well, we left Spain in 1492. We kept our citizenship since then. One of my relatives -- and I\ndon\u2019t want to brag about it, happened to be Don Isaac Abravanel. He kept his citizenship, he left\nSpain, he kept on being representative of the Spanish government, even during the Inquisition.\nAnd through him we kept our citizenship til we came to the United States. I came to the United\nStates with a Spanish passport, and I changed my citizenship when I became an American\ncitizen.",
        "Q: So does that mean that both of your parents, as well as you, were always Spanish citizens in\nGreece?",
        "A: My parents wer -- yes, both my parents, by marriage, were Spanish citizen. My father was\nSpanish citizen, my mother was -- Ashkenazi was one of the part of Jews that came 600 early --\n600 years earlier to Salonika from Poland, and they kept the name Ashkenazi to distinguish\nthemselves from Sephardi.",
        "Q: So -- so your mother was not Sephardic?",
        "A: No, wa -- my mother was Sephardic, after 600 years.",
        "Q: S -- and -- and so your -- your citizenship, you were never Greek citizens, is that right?",
        "A: Sure. No, I was always a Spanish citizen. I had the right to choose a citizenship when I\nbecame 21, but at that time, Greek was o -- Greece was occupied already by the Germans.",
        "Q: So you were born with Spanish citizenship?",
        "A: I was born Spanish citizen, and I be -- it was always Spanish citizen all my life, til I change\nmy citizenship when I came to the United States and became a u -- a USS. citizen.",
        "Q: I was just wondering if you can explain, since it\u2019s hard for me to understand, was there a\nreason that your parents knew all along that they wanted to keep Spanish citizenship?",
        "A: No, a family tradition. Just a family tradition.",
        "Q: Even though they felt very Greek, I would imagine.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. They knew nothing about Spain, except the language.",
        "Q: And can you tell me, and anyone else who might listen to this, a little bit more about this\nfamous Abranel?",
        "A: The Spanish what?",
        "Q: Abra -- Abravanel? I\u2019m sorry, I may not pronounce it correctly.",
        "A: Okay, a little bit of history. When Isabella and Ferdinand conquered Spain, they had two\ncouncilors that were Jewish. One was Hasdai ben Shiprut and one was Don Isaac Abravanel.\nThey were very high on the ca -- ca -- in the Spanish government and they were very appreciated\nby the kings. From this too, isibi -- Isaac -- Hasdai ben Shiprut decided to convert and stay with\nSpain. Isaac Abravanel decided to leave the country. He didn't want to convert, he didn\u2019t want to\nlive under the Inquisition. So Isaac Abravanel up til today is being honored by the whole Jewish\ncommunity, where the name of Hasdai Shiprut almost disappeared.",
        "Q: And your -- was it on your father\u2019s side or mother\u2019s side?",
        "A: My father\u2019s side.",
        "Q: And this is something that was long established, so nobody needed to prove the relations?",
        "A: No, not at all. Was never questioned. As a matter of fact [indecipherable] documents from the\nCortez, the Spanish congress, signed by the king of Spains, testify the citizenship of my father.",
        "Q: So now we go back to 1942, Liberty Square, I believe you were telling me about this, and was\nyour -- was it obvious -- when did it become obvious that your Spanish citizenship might help\nyou?",
        "A: From the beginning, that is, the Germans entered Greece, they always made a difference\nbetween the Italian citizens, and the Spanish citizen and the Turkish citizens because the\n[indecipherable] neutral and the Italians were allies. So the Italian citizens, the Spanish citizen\nand the Turkish citizens were not touched at all. But --",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: -- but we still couldn\u2019t travel, and we still couldn\u2019t choose our own profession or our own\nStatus.",
        "Q: Was your father\u2019s business interrupted by the German\u2019s measures at that time?",
        "A: Well, my father\u2019s si -- business started all over again after the occupation. We had lost\neverything with the sinking of the boat.",
        "Q: But was he still able to work when the Germans were there?",
        "A: Well, his bi -- his business was privilege for the Germans because they were stealing all the\ntobacco from Greece, and sending them to gr -- to Germany for -- for free, and my father was the\nbusiness that provided the materials to [indecipherable] and export the tobacco.",
        "Q: So he was able to continue his business?",
        "A: Yeah, he continued til 1943, that we were deported.",
        "Q: What were some of the things you saw about other Jewish families who could not continue\nworking? What did you see happening around you?",
        "A: Their hardships, that they have what to eat, they couldn't move, they couldn\u2019t congregate.\nThey were slaves that were in -- th-that were occupied, they were not free.",
        "Q: And they had to give up their jobs?",
        "A: Most of them had to give their jobs, yes. Have to give their jobs, and the Germans took all\ntheir proceed -- all their merchandise and everything they had. It was a terrible situation.",
        "Q: Did you -- so tell me, since you did not have to go to the Liberty Square, tell me what you\nlearned from -- you said -- did your father go, and what about your uncle?",
        "A: My father didn\u2019t go, my uncle was too old, my cousins went.",
        "Q: And what did they tell you about their experience?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t have to tell it because we were in the middle of a city, we saw it happening.",
        "Q: You saw the gather -- the round-up?",
        "A: Yes. We saw everything that happened.",
        "Q: So that day you were somewhere close by, but you didn\u2019t have to be part of it. Was that --",
        "A: Well, I was not part of it, and I was part of it, because personally I was not, but family-wise,\nmy whole family was part of it. There was no distinction. The citizenship was, how you call that?\n[indecipherable] something happen. We didn\u2019t choose it.",
        "Q: And what happened to your cousins? Were they taken away?",
        "A: Well, they all re -- perished in Auschwitz, from the first to the last one, and my uncle.",
        "Q: Now, I read about -- when this roundup occurred, I read about the fact that the Germans\nrequested a large sum of money as ransom. Can you explain this?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remem -- I don\u2019t remember how many billions of marks they requested at the time.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit from the start what -- what that was about?",
        "A: Well, what was about, it\u2019s one way you oppress the Jewish population, because they thought\nthey wouldn\u2019t be able to make their demands.",
        "Q: Well, what was the ransom for? What were they saying to the Jewish community?",
        "A: No explanation. No explanation at all. They needed the money, they should raise the money\nfor them, period.",
        "Q: Was this supposed to, in return, save some of the men from being sent to labor battalions?",
        "A: That was 1n a way thought, but right away they started with the -- the extreme measures, with\nputting the[indecipherable] on the Jews. By moving the whole population into ghettos, and a few\nmonths later, in March, the deportations started.",
        "Q: Well, before we get to that stage, about the ransom, I also read something about the Jewish\ncemetery in Salonika. Do you remember what happened with the cemetery?",
        "A: That was completely different. The Germans said that they needed materials to fortify the\ncity. And being that the German -- the Jewish cemetery was full of marble, and good materials --\nwas a cemetery that was six or 700 years old, they decided that they needed the materials. They\ncontacted the Greek government that was -- at the time was at quixli -- a quisling government.\nAnd the government said that the f -- you destroy the cemetery, will be a good favor for us\nbecause we can expand our university. And this is what happened. Today, where the Jewish\ncemetery was, is the University of Salonika.",
        "Q: Did you see the destruction of the cemetery at that time?",
        "A: I saw the destruction of the cemetery and I was part of it in a way, because they gave the\nJewish community a small place for a cemetery outside the city, and the people that could afford\nto do it, had to move the remains of their relatives to the new cemetery. Part of my family\ncontributed into removing the remains of my grandmother from this cemetery to the new one,\nand the graves at the time was meant to have six people, six remain of people in one grave. My\ngrandmother is still buried on the new cemetery in Salonika.",
        "Q: And I had read, but it sounds like you\u2019re saying it was not connected, I had read that the\ndestruction of that cemetery was related to the ransom that the Germans wanted.",
        "A: It happened way after the ransom. The loot that they took from the cemetery was not part of\nthe money that we told to -- to raise and pay the Germans. Com-completely different. It was not\neven at the same time, was later.",
        "Q: Now, I also read and was wondering if you were aware of this at the time, the Jewish archives\nand libraries in Salonika were confiscated, were taken.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that. [indecipherable] it\u2019s true, but I don\u2019t know when was it.",
        "Q: And I also heard about the threat of starvation and many people were -- were suffering a great\ndeal.",
        "A: The -- the starvation was general. Was not just the Jewish. As I told you, we had coupons in\norder to get certain amount of food every week and quite a few families, Jewish and Orthodox,\nno distinction there, chose many times not to report a death, to go to the cemetery and drop there\nthe corpse, in order to save the coupon, so they can have some extra measure of food. To tell the\ntruth, I mean, you cannot describe what was happen, but this was not just the Jews, was general.\nWas the whole population.",
        "Q: And -- and why had these conditions come about? How did they come about?",
        "A: Lack of imports, lack of commerce, lack of cultivation, bef -- por -- people were afraid to go\nto the -- to the fields. Lack of fear. The -- the partisans [indecipherable] if you left the city you\nexpose yourself, because they were there to -- to hit and kill as many Jews as they could -- that\u2019s\nmany Germans as they could. There were many, many, many reasons for it. I could keep on\nenumerating to you an awful lot of reasons why the population was starving.",
        "Q: Now, you mentioned partisans, were you contact with, or did you know any partisans?",
        "A: Was in contact with parti -- no. We knew about them, but personally I didn\u2019t know any. I\nknew my friend that I told you were in medical school, who went to the mountains as a partisan\nand was killed there.",
        "Q: And the ransom that was required fro -- by the Germans, did your family have to pay\nanything personally?",
        "A: We participated, but we did not have to. After all, we were not Spaniards, we were Jewish.",
        "Q: What was your -- at -- at this stage, before you are taken and moved, as I understand, to the\nghetto, which we\u2019ll come to, but at this stage, what was your daily life like?",
        "A: As Spanish citizens, we did not have to move to the ghetto. What happened is that where we\nlived became part of the ghetto, but we did not have to move. We kept our apartment, we did not\nmove at all.",
        "Q: Well, before that happened, what were you doing? You were a young man, but you were\nalready over 20, what were you doing on a daily basis?",
        "A: I had a business with a friend of mine who was also a Spanish citizen, name is Zaga Tenyo,\nwho used to produce --",
        "Q: Some drinks, tea?",
        "A: Dri -- drinks. And the name of the factory we had was called Olympic. There was drinks in\nenvelopes that we used to sell.",
        "Q: And this is something --",
        "A: Soft drinks.",
        "Q: And this is something that was going pretty well, considering the circumstances, or --",
        "A: Considering the circumstances, it was doing very well.",
        "Q: And had you already -- were you hoping someday to go back to medical school? What was\nyour state of mind like?",
        "A: Yes, definitely, definitely. I was thinking to continue my studies, but 1t couldn\u2019t happen,\nbecause when it ca -- when I was ready to go to school, I was already 30 years old. I had lost 10\nyears, between the concentration camp, going to Morocco, going to [indecipherable], going to\nthe Israeli army. 1939 became automatically 1949.",
        "Q: Now, before the ghetto was established, what -- what do you remember? Were there\nincreasing measures, you know, th -- against the Jews, and when -- when 1s this now, what year\nand approximately what month?",
        "A: We\u2019re talking about ninet -- beginning of \u201942, and beginning of 1943. The Jews could not\nmove into their own city, could not travel, could not work. At night they had to go back, they\ncouldn\u2019t go out at night. They couldn\u2019t even go from one borough to the other because they were\nprohibited to take the tramways.",
        "Q: Did this apply to you or not?",
        "A: No, this did not apply to me, I never wore a [indecipherable]. I was never told to live in a\nghetto. I happened to live in a ghetto because that\u2019s where I lived when they established the\nghetto.",
        "Q: So -- so you were saying you never had to wear the yellow star?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And then neither did your parents, right?",
        "A: Neither my parents. That\u2019s why we were able to take the bus and to take the tra -- the\ntramway, because nobody could distinguish us as Jews unless they knew us from before.",
        "Q: So tell me about what you remember in any sort of details when the ghetto was created.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. What I remember is that they created the ghetto, they were the conquerors, and\nthey created the Jewish police to more or less supervise any [indecipherable] that the Germans\nhad imposed and also in a way, take care of -- so there\u2019d be no crime. Actually, we were a\npopulation very pacific. We never rioted, we never stole from our -- from one to the other. We\nlive pacifically there, waiting to see what\u2019s going to happen.",
        "Q: Did you have interactions with the Jewish police?",
        "A: Yeah, we were all Jewish.",
        "Q: No, I mean did you personally have any, you know, communication or interactions with\nJewish police?",
        "A: Yes. My cousins were Jewish police.",
        "Q: Well, they probably treated you well because they were your cousins.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t have to treat me, I was free, as a Spaniard. I was not treated as a Jew.",
        "Q: So was there anything throughout this period of time --",
        "A: And -- let me explain something more. The reason that many people paid money and tried to\nbecome Jewish police, because there was a rumor flooded by the Germans that the Jewish police\nwill not be touched, will remain where they were, and will not be deported. So people were\n[indecipherable] were fighting to became Jewish police.",
        "Q: How did your cousins become th -- Jewish police?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And what were their names?",
        "A: My great cousin was David, my second one was Solomon, the third one was Henry, and I\ndon\u2019t remember the name of the fourth one. This was on my uncle\u2019s side. On my aunt\u2019s side,\nthere was only one that was her -- his name was Maurice -- Maurice Seedis.",
        "Q: So none of the -- none of the restrictions applied to you at -- at this stage.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And yet, just by virtue of where you were already living, you were included in the ghetto.",
        "A: Was include in the ghetto because we happened to be there, and we were there\n[indecipherable] Jewish because all the [indecipherable] family was part of our life. We were\nliving with them.",
        "Q: So did your -- did anything change about your living conditions once this became a ghetto?",
        "A: Well, the salvation was there, as I though it was part of the Jewish life and the Christian life.\nThe traveling from one city to the other was not permitted. Traveling at night we were afraid. We\ntried to help as much we could our Jewish families and the whole Jewish community, and --",
        "Q: Was there --",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] period.",
        "Q: -- was there anything -- so you were able to help others who -- you know, did not have the\nSpanish citizenship?",
        "A: We were able to help them money-wise because both my friend and myself continued in our\nbusiness of the so -- of the soft git -- drinks.",
        "Q: So what did you see -- what was changing around this time, if anything, for the other Jewish\nfamilies, once they were in the ghetto?",
        "A: [indecipherable] what can I say -- tell you. What was changing was the fear, period.",
        "Q: And were you also fearful, or were you feeling that, with your citizenship you would be\nokay?",
        "A: No, there was no guarantee, as a matter of fact, even with the citizenship, finally we were\ndeported.",
        "Q: Was that something you were worried about at that time?",
        "A: Yes, everybody worried about it.",
        "Q: When did you first hear about -- the -- the first deportations, when -- do you remember\nhearing about those?",
        "A: First deportation was in March 1943, I think it was the 23\" of March.",
        "Q: And you knew about it right away?",
        "A: We knew about it because we saw people pi -- taken from the ghetto and sent to the railroad\nstation in order to be deported. It was not a secret.",
        "Q: The -- if you can explain to me -- cause I looked at a map and it looked like it\u2019s not just one\narea that was a ghetto, that was in a few different sections.",
        "A: There -- there were five ghettos and each ghetto went to the railroad station one at a time and\nsometimes half of the time because there were 23 deportations.",
        "Q: Is there a name to the section, the district you were in?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And were you close by to --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Nick\nLevi. This is tape number two, side A. You were just telling me about this situation with the\npartisans and the Germans. Can you tell me again?",
        "A: Well, the situation in Greece, like every occupied country, people were against the Germans\nand most of them became partisans in the mountains. When the Germans had to travel by\nrailroad, they used to brought -- put in front of the locomotive, a wagon with Greek hostages, just\nin case there was a bomb in the railroad tracks, so the wagon of the Jewish -- of the hostages will\nbe blown up, and not the Germans. Also, when they had any skirmishes with the partisans, and\none of two Germans were killed, in the morning of the [indecipherable] they used to have lorries,\nand [indecipherable] the city, and pick up for every German that was killed, six people that\npeacefully will go into work in the morning, and execute them. So, it\u2019s impossible to describe the\nfear we lived in, regardless of citizenship. When they picked up cit -- when picked up hostages,\nthey didn't ask you what citizenship, they didn\u2019t ask if you were Jewish, you\u2019re just one of the\nhostages, period.",
        "Q: Did this happen to anyone you knew?",
        "A: Yes, quite a few of my friends were killed this way, were executed this way.",
        "Q: And were any of the non-Jewish Greek population able to help Jews at this time?",
        "A: It was impossible. The only h-help they could give to us, it\u2019s either to hide a Jew, or to take\ntheir belongings and hide them, hopefully to give them back to them when they come back, after\nthe war. That\u2019s the only thing they could do for us.",
        "Q: And did you know of situations like that?",
        "A: Yes, I know a situation like that, where quite [indecipherable] precious things were given\naway to Greek friends, who unfortunately, after the war, they didn\u2019t -- not all of them gave them\nback to the Jews. Most of them had a famous saying; I\u2019m sorry they didn\u2019t kill you too. So they\nwere [indecipherable] not anti-Semitics, but they were humans. Whatever they could loot and\nkeep, they kept. Maybe we\u2019re Jews who would have done the same thing. Who knows?",
        "Q: Did you ever i -- did you ever experience anti-Semitism from the Greek population?",
        "A: No, not even today. As I told you, I still correspond with Greek friends that, as in Athens, or\nin Salonika were very good friends, and we keep in touch with their families and with our\nfamily.",
        "Q: Now, while you were still living in your home, were you able to continue observing, you\nknow, holidays and did -- wer -- were you able to go to synagogue any more?",
        "A: No. The synagogues were closed and occupied. Most of them became stables of the German\narmy. We could not, of course, bake matzohs or things like that for Passover. We kept it quiet in\nthe house, we used to do our prayers, and that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit more about, and did you ever have any interaction at all with this --\nwith this Rabbi Koretz?",
        "A: No, I never did.",
        "Q: Did you have strong feelings about his role?",
        "A: Yes, I do, but I keep them for myself.",
        "Q: And what about the Germans, did you have any interactions with the Germans occupying at\nthat time?",
        "A: I had interaction with the Germans that were sent to us from Germany, the 150 people I told\nyou before, because they were part of the shupos, and they used to interfere with our lives.",
        "Q: In what ways?",
        "A: In all ways. We were not free. We had to do what they told us to do.",
        "Q: So -- and that was usually coming from the German Jews, not from the -- the Germans in\ncharge?",
        "A: From the German Jews. You know, it\u2019s a funny thing. The Germans sent to Salonika six\npeople, only six people. And these six people recruited the Jewish police, and the 150 people that\ncome th -- came there before, and did the whole job of deporting close to 100,000 people, just\nwith six of them. It\u2019s fantastic, the way they were organized.",
        "Q: Did you ever see the six who were in charge?",
        "A: Yes, we saw them, they circulate. As a matter of fact, was a fat one named Vincent -- Vincent\nCheni, who after the war was executed.",
        "Q: Did you know the names of the others at the time?",
        "A: No, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t. If I knew them, I don\u2019t remember them.",
        "Q: So now, back to the deportations. When -- when these began, what else were you seeing?\nWhat -- what -- were the people immediately around you being taken, or was it different groups\nof people?",
        "A: They were taken 1n groups of people, and when the time came for the people around me, they\nwere taken like all the others. There were no exception.",
        "Q: So, at that time that the people around you were taken, you were taken with them, as well?",
        "A: No. We were not touched, because we didn\u2019t wear the [indecipherable] and we were Spanish.\nWe were left in our apartment without being touched at all.",
        "Q: So do you remember when the people in your section were deported?",
        "A: That must have been sometime before Passover, between April and May, 1943.",
        "Q: What were you hearing and what were -- what was everybody being told as to where these\ndeportations were going?",
        "A: They were told to bring the money with them, to exchange the money to zlotys because they\nwere going to Poland, where Germany had decided to establish a Jewish state and were\nconcentrating all the Jews of Europe there. And people believed in that because the Chief Rabbi\nwas the first one to disseminate the -- the rumor, and they were going like sheep to the new\nplace, where they go -- were going to have a Jewish state.",
        "Q: Were they told where in Poland?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t say the location. I th -- I think they mentioned the word Krakow, I\u2019m not sure\nabout it. And that\u2019s it. They gave all their money, they came happy back with zlotys and then\nthey were put into -- into wagons, animal wagons, locked there and transported.",
        "Q: What was your impression of -- of this idea? Did you believe this?",
        "A: I had a good friend who was the secretary of the Greek governor of Macedonia, who kept on\ntelling me all the time, don\u2019t believe what they\u2019re telling you, try to escape. Go away. Don\u2019t stay\nhere. I didn\u2019t listen to him.",
        "Q: You -- you --",
        "A: The -- the Greeks knew what was going to happen, but they couldn\u2019t tell us. They were afraid\nof their own lives.",
        "Q: So did -- was there some part of you that did believe what the Germans were saying?",
        "A: I believed what the Greeks were saying. I didn\u2019t believe what the Germans were saying, but\nby Jewish tradition, I couldn\u2019t leave my father and mother, so I had to stay with them.",
        "Q: Did you at all discuss with them the idea of escaping?",
        "A: Yes. We didn\u2019t know about the crematoria. Don\u2019t misunderstand me. We didn\u2019t know about\nthe concentration camps. But we knew that where they\u2019re sending them was nothing good.",
        "Q: So you had not yet heard of the name Auschwitz?",
        "A: We heard the name Auschwitz when we arrived at Bergen-Belsen. When we arrived at the\ncamp, there was a group of Polish Jews that are concentrated there because they were\nArgentinean citizens. They told us what happen. They told us the extermination, we never\nbelieved them. It was impossible to believe.",
        "Q: So when you saw others around you being deported, and you were not being deported, did\nyou think for awhile that you would never face the deportations?",
        "A: Well, we were told by the Spanish consul that they were making arrangements to take them to\nSpain. So we were looking for them, we were given passports. We -- part of our money we gave\nto the Spanish embassy to keep for us, and we were waiting the day that we\u2019ll be sent to Spain.\nThen it came in July 1943 that we were called -- actually our parents, the heads of families were\ncalled to a -- a synagogue named Beth Saul in Salonika with instructions, and instead of\ninstructions, they were taken to the railroad station and we were told to follow them and join\nthem there. So I took my mother and myself and we went to this place, called Baron Hirsch, to\njoin my father.",
        "Q: He had already been taken there earlier?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: So you knew that he was going to be there at some point?",
        "A: We knew he was going to be there because we were told from the embassy to be there. But\nthe thinking was that we\u2019ll be given our passports back and we\u2019Il travel to Spain.",
        "Q: You -- you gave your passports to the Spanish embassy?",
        "A: Yes, we gave the passport to the Spanish embassy. We were deported, we were put in cattle\nwagons like all the other Jews. And at the end of July --",
        "Q: Do you want to take a break? You want to take -- you want some water?",
        "A: If I knew this will be the -- the interview, I would never agreed.",
        "Q: I think you were starting to tell me about the time when you were taken from Salonika.",
        "A: Yes, we\u2019re --",
        "Q: Oh -- sorry. Something happened to the recording. I think it\u2019s okay.",
        "A: We were put in cattle wagons like all the other Jews that went with us, and we were\ntransferred from there to Bergen-Belsen. It took about three weeks from Salonika to arrive to\nBergen-Belsen, and of all the hardships that I remember and the -- and the hungers that we went\nthrough, one date remains in my mind, and this is the 13\" of August, 1943. Our convoy had\nstopped in Nuremberg, and at that time Nuremberg had a raid from the British and American af -\n- air force. What I remember is a miracle. The Germans locked the wagons, went to shelters, and\nthe bombs kept on falling on the railroad station all around us, and miraculously our wagon was\nnot touched. August 13, 1943, and three days later we arrived in Bergen-Belsen.",
        "Q: And you had told me earlier that you believe you were something like the 22\" deportation\nfrom Salonika?",
        "A: I think it was the 23\" deportation from Salonika. The very last one.",
        "Q: How many other Greek Jews -- I guess they all -- everybody had Spanish citizenship with\nyou? How many were there?",
        "A: We were about 300 all together.",
        "Q: And this was a group you already know -- knew many of these individuals?",
        "A: Yeah, we were acquainted during the -- the German occupation. This happened \u00b043, and we\nknew each other from 1941, when we arrived Salonika.",
        "Q: And the three weeks journey you were in -- you were always in the -- the train, the cattle car.",
        "A: [indecipherable] the train, locked in, yes.",
        "Q: What kind of food were you eating?",
        "A: Don\u2019t ask. The best ans-answer is, don\u2019t ask.",
        "Q: I also wanted to ask 1f you knew anything -- I -- I was reading about in the s -- back in the\nSalonika ghetto, there was a doctor who escaped. Was that something that you knew about? His\nname --",
        "A: You talking about Dr. Matarasso?",
        "Q: This -- I don\u2019t know if -- this name is spelled C-u-e-n-c-a.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, I -- for God\u2019s sake, of course. He came to the United States, he wrote a book, the\nname of the book is Birkenau. His name was Dr. Manashay.",
        "Q: Is this -- is this the same one? I -- I read about somebody -- I read about this, on March 18\",\nthat Dr. Cuenca -- C-u-e --",
        "A: Doct -- Dr. Cuenca was one of the doctors of Salonika, yes.",
        "Q: Did you know about his escape in March of \u201943, from the ghetto, apparently?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I know about Dr. Manashay.",
        "Q: And -- and what happened with him?",
        "A: Dr. Manashay wa -- survived, came to the United States and died in New York. But he wrote\na book, the book is named Birkenau, that unfa -- unfortunately, I gave it to somebody, never\nreturned it to me.",
        "Q: Now, when you -- when you were taken from Salonika, you didn't know where they were\ntaking you?",
        "A: No, no. We knew -- we knew that we\u2019re going to Poland. We didn\u2019t know we\u2019re going --\nwe\u2019re being taken to Germany.",
        "Q: And you no longer thought you were being taken to Spain?",
        "A: No, that was finish because we didn\u2019t have passports, we had nothing.",
        "Q: And did you have the ability to take anything at all with you?",
        "A: Only what we had with us, period, nothing else.",
        "Q: You just had to walk away from your home and just leave everything there?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And you never saw any of those items again?",
        "A: Not any more because I didn\u2019t go back to Greece after the war.",
        "Q: So, were you -- were you familiar with the negotiations that I guess were going on a great\ndeal, about the Jews like yourself with Spanish citizenship.",
        "A: We heard about the negotiations after we were liberated from the camp. We were told that j --\nthe Joint Distribution Committee was trying through the Spanish government, to liberate as many\nJews as possible. Being that our names were known, because of our passports and our ci --\ncitizenship and everything, we were selected as the ones to be taken out of the camp. When we\nwent to the -- to germ -- to Spain, we learned that the whole thing was done through the\nPortuguese Red Cross, through a gentleman who was in charge at the time, a representative of\nthe Red Cross in Spain. His name, I think was Sakura, who took good care of us when we arrived\nin Spain and was responsible for taking us from Spain to Morocco, because the agreement with\nthe Spanish government was that only a certain amount of Jews will be allowed to stay in Spain,\nand in order to accept new Jews, they had to leave. And the funny part of it is that out of Spain\nwe were Spanish citizens. In Spain itself, we were [indecipherable]. We didn\u2019t s -- have a -- have\na citizenship. We were not recognized as Spanish.",
        "Q: Now, to go back to Bergen-Belsen, what was it like when you -- what are your first\nimpressions when you arrived?",
        "A: No impressions at all. Confused.",
        "Q: Well, let me just phrase it differently, then. If you could just tell me what you saw when you\nfirst arrived.",
        "A: When we arrived to Celle, the city of Celle, Bergen-Belsen\u2019s full name is Bergen-Belsen by\nCelle-Hannover. When we arrived in Celle, they took us out of the wagons and they marched us\nfor about two or three kilometers to the concentration camp. We did not know where we were\ngoing, we did not know the name of the place. All we saw is barbed wire, barracks and towers\nwith people with machine guns, and do -- and fiercely dogs. When we got there, we was\nseparated from the families. The women went to different barracks, the men went to different\nbarracks and that\u2019s it, period.",
        "Q: Were you able to stay with your father?",
        "A: No -- with my father, yes, but not in the same barrack.",
        "Q: Do you remember any name or section that you were in in Bergen-Belsen?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Do you thi -- I have a map, do you think you\u2019d recognize?",
        "A: Yes, I would.",
        "Q: Let me see. I don\u2019t know, this is from \u00b045, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same layout.",
        "A: No, we lived in 1943 -- 1944 actually.",
        "Q: Did it look this way?",
        "A: No, we were not at the crematory. The camp commander was here. I\u2019m trying my best, maybe\nI\u2019m wrong.",
        "Q: That\u2019s fine, whatever you remember.",
        "A: No -- oh, no, no, no, no, no, now I remember. When I see the latrines, I remember where we\nwere. The latrines were here, our barracks were here. Yeah. I remember the cellar, where they\nused to bring the vegetables that were feeding us. I remember the latrines, yes, yes. Our barracks\nwere here.",
        "Q: And was there a -- a name to the section --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- that you remember?",
        "A: No, that I can\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Cause I -- I read about the group of -- of Jews with Spanish citizenship, that they were in the\nneutrals camp. Does that make sense to you?",
        "A: Neutrals camp?",
        "Q: That you were considered neutral.",
        "A: Probably, because there, as I told you were the ger -- the Argentineans also. So maybe that\nwas called neutral camp, but nobody ever told us.",
        "Q: Who else was immediately around you in your barracks?",
        "A: People that we came together, the 300 from Salonika. About 50 people from Argentina, or\nArgentineans, but actually from Poland, who unfortunately they must have gotten that citizenship\nthrough paying money or whatever, they -- and very few of them survived. They were not\nrecognized as Argentineans by the Germans, whereas we, from Salonika, were s -- survived from\nthe first to the last one. There was no doubt about our citizenship.",
        "Q: How were you treated?",
        "A: We were not treated, period.",
        "Q: I mean, how -- did your -- did the treatment of -- of --",
        "A: They used -- they used to bring food once a day through the other Jews that was prisoners 1n\nthe camp. The food, I don\u2019t want to mention it. We had to eat it one way or the other. One day a\nweek, usually every Friday, we used to go to the showers to be cleaned and to have our -- our cl-\nclothing been disinfected. We went to the showers, we took our clothing, men and women\ntogether in the same place, naked. We had about five minutes of shower, and 75 minutes naked\nwaiting for our -- our -- our clothing to come back from the -- I don\u2019t know how they used to\ncall, the place where they disinfected them, and then take him back to the camp.",
        "Q: And besides Fridays, what else do you remember about the daily routines?",
        "A: What I remember, twice a day we used to have what they call the appel, or the appelle. That\u2019s\nfive o\u2019clock in the morning and the evening, where the German commandant would come with\nhis shi -- with his ga -- dog, and ask from the [indecipherable] -- from the [indecipherable] out of\nthe camp, how many died tonight, how many died today? Count them, make sure that nobody\nwas missing and taken back to the barracks.",
        "Q: Were people dying right around you, where you were?",
        "A: People were dying, but not in our section, because 1n our section we didn\u2019t have to work.\nPeople that had to work, with the -- with the food they were given, couldn\u2019t rest too much.",
        "Q: What were you doing -- you weren\u2019t working during the rest of the day, were you staying in\nthe barracks? Where were you?",
        "A: Abso -- absolutely not, I think, staying in the barracks, period. And I was lucky enough to\nhave a book with me, and I read this book maybe 10 times. 10 or 20 times.",
        "Q: Do you remember -- do you remember what the book was?",
        "A: Oh yeah, it was a Bible. The Bible in Greek. I\u2019m an expert on the Bible now, you can ask me\nanything you want, and I\u2019Il give it to you. I memorize it.",
        "Q: Did that help you in any way in terms of praying, or in terms of religion?",
        "A: Not in praying, it helped me very much in making sure I don\u2019t go crazy. It helping -- it helped\nme in spending my time sane instead of, you know, depressed and -- and whatever you call it.\nYes, it helped me a lot.",
        "Q: Was that unusual? Did you know anybody else who had a Bible with them?",
        "A: Not that I remember. Not that I remember.",
        "Q: And was that one of the only things you brought with you, then?",
        "A: That was the only thing I happened to have with me by -- by coincidence or mistake. How\nvery surprised [indecipherable] today, that they didn\u2019t take it away from me.",
        "Q: And did you pray while you were there?",
        "A: Everybody prayed without hope.",
        "Q: Did you have a sense that you were being treated differently than some of the other prisoners\nat Bergen-Belsen?",
        "A: That we knew because we saw the other prisoners going to work every morning and coming\nback every evening. And we knew that we were not working. And that\u2019s help us a lot, except that\nwe were living with the fear that we\u2019ll never get out of it, because from the amount of food that\nthey give us, we couldn\u2019t last forever.",
        "Q: Are you able to tell me what you did have to eat?",
        "A: What we did where?",
        "Q: Wh-What you ate. What -- what they gave to you.",
        "A: Stuffed cabbage. Every week, half a potato. Five grams of bread, and a little bit of butter and\nmilk that we did not eat ourselves or drink ourselves, they gave it to the young children that\u2019s\nhappened to be with us, because among the 300 of us, there were infants. And we tried to\npreserve them as much as we could.",
        "Q: Now when did you -- were you able to see your parents at times?",
        "A: Oh, we saw each other every day. We did not live together the same barrack, whether we saw\neach other every day.",
        "Q: They were close by and you were able to go over and see them?",
        "A: They\u2019re close by and also my father in a way, was privileged at the camp because my father\nwas a German schoolteacher in his -- when he was young, World War I, and the German help\nhim a lot. This is part of [indecipherable] like to say about the Jews of Greece. As long as you\nwant to know what happened to them, it\u2019s a disaster. The Jews from Greece were deported to\nPoland exactly when the crematoria were established in 1943. Before that the Germans used to\nexecute the Jews. They didn\u2019t have the crematoria ready yet. When they arrived in ger -- in\nAuschwitz, they had three things against them. Number one, that the Germans wanted to feed\nand drive the crematorium. Number two, that because there was Ladino, they didn\u2019t know it --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Nick\nLevi. This is tape number two, side B. Okay, please -- please continue.",
        "A: So the third part of it was that -- not being able to communicate. The people that were on top\nof them took the bread away to serve the -- to forced labors. Was slow -- steady but steadily they\nwere exterminated. That\u2019s why part of them, they became Sonderkommando, because the\nmoment they arrived there, the Germans were looking for people to use in the crematory. Of the\npopulation of Europe, or Jewish population of Europe that perished during the Holocaust, the\npercentage of Greek Jews that perished is the most elevated, the maximum one. I think about 86\npercent of the Jews from Greece perished in the Holocaust.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you know any German, and did that help you in Bergen-Belsen?",
        "A: Not at all. I didn\u2019t know one word of German.",
        "Q: But your father did?",
        "A: Yeah, my father used to communicate with them, not that it help him, but --",
        "Q: So, did you ever communicate with the Germans at Bergen-Belsen?",
        "A: Absolutely no contacts at all.",
        "Q: And so do you even have memories of particular commanders there at -- at the time, or SS?",
        "A: [indecipherable] I remember the commander with his dog. I don\u2019t remember the name.\nHauptman Spherer or something like that.",
        "Q: What would have been -- so the language you were speaking most of the time while you were\nthere was Ladino, or what was the language?",
        "A: I used to speak most of the time Greek. Ah -- my language was Greek. Forget that we were\nSpanish citizens, we were Greeks after all. We were born in Greece, and we deported from\nGreek. We knew Ladino among our families, but outside our homes we used to speak Greek.",
        "Q: What\u2019s the language you speak today the most, at home?",
        "A: Here at home? Five languages at the same time. Ladino, Spanish, Hebrew, Greek, French, and\nwho knows what else?",
        "Q: And probably English.",
        "A: Hebrew -- and Hebrew. English I\u2019m not gonna mention. [off camera remarks]. We\u2019ve been\nhere more than 50 years.",
        "Q: You were telling me about the crematoria at Auschwitz, but what did you -- did you learn\nabout at Bergen-Belsen --",
        "A: Pm not going to answer to that. I know about the crematory in Bergen-Belsen, but most of the\npeople -- the crematoria there were -- were Russian citizen -- occu -- pri -- prisoners of war.\nThey executed an awful lot of Russians there.",
        "Q: So in your -- in your barracks, as far as communicating with others, were they -- were they all\nGreek in your barracks?",
        "A: Yes. Our barrack was only Greeks. Spanish Greeks. The whole barrack of ours was isolated.\nWe never -- we did not get in touch with the other Greeks in Bergen-Belsen and we did not go to\nwork. The only way we had a contact with them is when they used to come and bring us the food\nin the morning and we were forbidden to talk to each. The Germans didn\u2019t want them to know\nwhat was happening in the other camps, because maybe they knew that sooner or later they had\nto send them to Greece, to send us to Spain.",
        "Q: So you weren\u2019t hearing that much, or did you hear from other places about what else was\nhappening?",
        "A: We heard from other places what was happening through the Argentineans that came from\nPoland, and we never believed it.",
        "Q: How -- how was your health during the time you were at Bergen-Belsen?",
        "A: Except for colds, very good.",
        "Q: And were your parents healthy, relatively speaking?",
        "A: Same thing, same thing. Same thing.",
        "Q: And were you required to wear the uniforms?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you continue any religious observances while you were there?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: What were you thinking about at this stage for the future? Were you at all hopeful in any way,\nor -- or -- or not? Did you somehow remain hopeful?",
        "A: I gave you the answer before. We were positive we\u2019ll never get alive from the camp, so we\nnever gave it any other thought, what\u2019s going to be our future.",
        "Q: So, tell me then how it came about when you learned that you were going to leave the camp.",
        "A: Well, one day a Spanish consul came to Bergen-Belsen, and told us that they made\narrangements to take us back to Spain. He gave us our passports and he said because\ntransportation was very limited, he was going to be in two -- two convoys. So I happened to be\non the second one. First about 150 people went ahead of us to Spain, and then the remaining of\nus went to Spain about two weeks later.",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "A: That was 1944 already. I don\u2019t remember exactly the month.",
        "Q: You were in Bergen-Belsen approximately for how long, do you know?",
        "A: About eight to nine months.",
        "Q: And do you know -- did you later learn why you were there for that period of time? Do you\nknow --",
        "A: Yes, we were told from the Spanish government, that they had no choice. The Germans\nwanted us to be isolated for a certain amount of time so we couldn\u2019t communicate with the allies\nand tell them what was happening in Salonika [indecipherable] fortifications and other strategic\nthings. We didn\u2019t swallow it, but that\u2019s the answer we were given.",
        "Q: So when you were --",
        "A: In other words, we were told after the fact, that we were not in a concentration camp, we were\nin a transient camp.",
        "Q: But at the time it didn\u2019t feel that way.",
        "A: Of course not. Of course not. Who knew what was happening in the outside? We were\ncompletely isolated.",
        "Q: And were there times where you were worried that you might be sent specifically to\nAuschwitz? You had heard about Auschwitz at this point.",
        "A: Yes. We were always worried about what was going to happen to us. We knew about\nAuschwitz, and you knew out -- about the crematories in Bergen-Belsen. So what was there to\nthink about?",
        "Q: So when you then heard that you were going to Spain, did that give you a certain amount of\nhope?",
        "A: Not til after we transferred from there and we were in Spain. We couldn\u2019t believe it and we\ndidn\u2019t believe it til we actually passed Port Bo into the Pyrenees and arrived in Barcelona.",
        "Q: What was the journey like? How long did it take?",
        "A: Very long. I think it took about two and a half weeks. And then we waited for about two days\nat the Pyrenees in the frontier because two our people had died, and the Germans wanted to make\nsure that we sign affidavits that they didn't kill them, that they were natural deaths.",
        "Q: Who was transporting you then, at that time?",
        "A: The Germans. Everything was done by the Germans. We -- we sp -- went through the whole\nof France, from Hannover all the way down to Port Bo in the Pyrenees with Germans. And we\nsigned affidavits before we entered Spain to the Germans.",
        "Q: So each one of you, you had to sign personally?",
        "A: I think the -- the man in charge is the one who signed, who, being a Jew -- his name was\nIzrhazi -- being a Jew was also before the war, and during the war, the consul of Spain in\nSalonika. He was traveling with us and he is the one who certified that they were not killed.",
        "Q: I -- I just remembered reading that -- that also this Rabbi Koretz was at Bergen-Belsen, were\nyou aware of him being there?",
        "A: Yes. We were of it. We were very aware of it and that\u2019s why we hate him much today. I\u2019m\npositive he was a collaborator, that\u2019s why he survived. His family survived, all of them. He is the\nonly one who died. And he died from typhoid and maybe from old age.",
        "Q: So, during the transport, were you with your parents the whole time?",
        "A: Yes. We were with our parents, we were well fed. We had no complaints, except what as I\ntold you before, to the last minute, we didn\u2019t know where we were going. The fear was there.",
        "Q: So, if you could tell me now, what happened next? You got to this point where somebody had\nto sign these affidavits and then you actually entered Spain?",
        "A: When we entered Spain, we were under the auspices of joice distri -- Joint Distribution\nCommittee, under the [indecipherable] or whatever it 1s, of Samuel Sakura, who happened to be\nalso the representative of the Portuguese Red Cross in Spain. We were distributed into hotels.\nWe were taken bi -- care of it. We were, all of us examined to find out if health-wise we were bis\n-- perfect, that nothing was wrong with us, and we were given as a matter of fact, pocket money,\nso we won\u2019t suffer. We stayed in Barcelona about six months, and if it wasn\u2019t for Barcelona we\nwouldn\u2019t be alive today. We were treated royalty. No complaints at all. Now, the reason that we\nleft Barcelona is because, as we found out later on, there was an agreement that General Franco\nwill not accept too many Jews in Spain, there had to be a certain amount. So they organized a\nconvoy, they took us from Barcelona through Spain to Cadiz, and from Cadiz with a convoy, we\nwere took into Casablanca, that other time we was liberated from the Germans, and the\nAmericans were occupying Morocco.",
        "Q: Who -- who\u2019s they? Who is taking you?",
        "A: What do you mean, who\u2019s they?",
        "Q: Well, you were saying they took you from Barcelona to Casablanca --",
        "A: Joint Distribution Committee, the f -- Samuel Sakura. Everything was happen in Spain,\nhappened through the Portuguese Red Cross, as far as I know.",
        "Q: A-And the Joint, you\u2019re saying, both --",
        "A: The Germans were not there any more.",
        "Q: No, no, no, but the Joint.",
        "A: The Joint was financing the whole thing, yes.",
        "Q: How large a group were you at this point?",
        "A: We were 300.",
        "Q: So you were all together again.",
        "A: The same group. Always the same group. We\u2019re 300 there, we\u2019re 300 in Morocco.",
        "Q: And where did you stay in Morocco, what was the situation there?",
        "A: In Morocco we was taken to a beach outside Casablanca called Fidella, where there was a\nrefugee camp of the United Nations. We stayed in this camp, in the tents, I believe for about\nseven or eight months, and then from this camp, we were taken with a convoy through Argeus,\nfrom Argeus to Italy, from Italy to Gaza in order to be repatriated to Greece. By that time it was\nalready 1945.",
        "Q: Do you know the month when that was?",
        "A: No, the only thing I remember is that when we got to the concen -- to the refugee camp in\nGaza, the name of the camp was Lucerite, Greece was not liberated yet. The Greek army in exile\nwith a -- with the King George was still in Palestine, they were not in Greece yet. The exact\nmonth, I cannot remember.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s why you were sent to Palestine, or --",
        "A: Were sent there in order to be repatriated to Greece, yes. We went to a Greek refugee camp,\nbut was under the -- not the command -- under the auspices of the United Nations. The camp was\ncalled Lucerite, and the name of the camp -- the name of the people that were running the camp\nfor the United Nations was URRA, United Nations Rehabilitation and Refugee Administration.\nOne thing I have to say that being that I knew English, I was [indecipherable] and hired by the\nUnited Nations to help the administration [indecipherable] living constantly in the camp.",
        "Q: Well, the first -- the first U.N. camp that you were at in -- in Casablanca, near Casablanca,\nwhat were the conditions like there? Who else was living there as well?",
        "Q: The conditions were excellent except that we lived in camps, and we lived in tents. Our\nguards were Italian prisoners of war. They were the -- the best people you can ever see in your\nlife. They were human, they were good, they helped us in everything. We had no choice at -- but\nto say thanks to them.",
        "Q: And you were there for a long time, it sounds like.",
        "A: Oh, we were there at least six months, I don\u2019t remember exactly how long.",
        "Q: And -- and who else was part of this camp?",
        "A: I try to forget that. There were some people that we did not associate with them, who were\nliberated from Spain and came with us to the camp that were part of the Lincoln brigade that\nfought Franco during the chi -- during the Spanish Civil War, and they were imprisoned from\n1936 til ninet -- til 1936 yes, til 1943 or \u201945, that they were sent with us to the camp.",
        "Q: Was this a large group?",
        "A: Yes, there was a large group, and I\u2019m not going to say a word about them. They were good\npeople, good people.",
        "Q: And there were others already at this camp in clasa -- Casablanca?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: It was created basically for your group, you think, or --",
        "A: Maybe there was a group before us, I don\u2019t know. But the maximum were there, we must\nhave been about a thousand people, no more, no less. I doubt it very much.",
        "Q: What was your state of mind when you were at that place? Did you have a good deal of hope\nat this stage?",
        "A: We were liberated, we were hopeful, we were told we are going back to Greece. What will be\nmy state of mind? We were very happy.",
        "Q: The war wasn\u2019t over yet, right?",
        "A: No. I\u2019m talking 1944. There where wa -- the war was not over yet. We left Casablanca -- we\nleave Morocco in 1945, where at that time the -- the [indecipherable] has taken -- had taken place\nand the Germans were no place to be seen.",
        "Q: So you think it was approximately -- you\u2019re not sure exactly when in \u201945 you would have left\nMorocco?",
        "A: No, we left the camp -- no -- May, June of \u201945, something, I don\u2019t -- it was before the end of\nthe war, that\u2019s -- I\u2019m sure it was it.",
        "Q: And what about -- so then tell me about the next journey that you went on.",
        "A: The next journey was by train all the way from Morocco to Algiers. In Algiers we stayed for a\nfew days, and with the convoy we were -- that\u2019s why I said the war was not over yet, and with\nthe convoy would take you to Taranto in Italy at the military camp of the British.",
        "Q: You mean Torino in Italy?",
        "A: Taranto.",
        "Q: Taranto.",
        "A: Taranto, not Torinto -- Torino. It\u2019s the end of the -- of the boot. It\u2019s -- one side it\u2019s Taranto\nand the other side I think is Bari, something. Taranto, where we were. In Taranto we stayed a\nfew weeks, and when they had a convoy for the Middle East, we were part of this convoy. I\nremember it was a convoy of Australia -- Australian soldiers who went to Port-Siad. From Port-\nSiad we are taken with trucks to can -- el Cantara. From el Cantara we cross the Suez Canal, and\nwe were taken to Gaza.",
        "Q: Did you know where you were going at that point?",
        "A: Yes. We knew we were going to Gaza, bepo -- because we thought we\u2019ll be repatriated to\nGreece. We knew we were going to a refugee camp of the United Nations, to be assembled and\nsent back to Greece as soon as Greece was liberated.",
        "Q: How large was that camp? Who else was there?",
        "A: The camp in [indecipherable] was a large camp. Quite a few thousand of people. Quite a few\nGreeks had escaped from Greece, and I do think there were quite a few from Cyprus and Libya,\nbut I\u2019m not sure about it.",
        "Q: These were all Jewish refugees?",
        "A: No. No, no, no, no, no. We were the only Jewish refugees there.",
        "Q: So, it\u2019s while you\u2019re at this camp that you begin working as a translator?",
        "A: Not as a translator, I was working -- working at the b -- at the administration of the camp, and\noccasionally because they were all Greeks, I used to translate for them, but my main function\nwas in the office. Actually, it was bookkeeping to a certain extent.",
        "Q: How long did you stay at that camp?",
        "A: The camp was dismantled at the end of 1945, I think 1t was November, where Greece was\ncomplete liberated. And they started sending refugees back to Greece. I did not leave the camp. I\nstayed there for only one reason. At the time there was a civil war going 1n Greece, the\nCommunists and the Royalists, and I did not go -- or want to go and get involved in a civil war.\nSo when my tame -- time came to be repatriated to Greece, I decided to stay in Palestine.",
        "Q: Is that -- did your parents stay with you at that time?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And just to back up, do you remember where you were when the war actually ended?",
        "A: I was in the camp.",
        "Q: Wa --",
        "A: I was in Gaza.",
        "Q: And was that a -- a big moment. Do you remember hearing the news? Was that --",
        "A: There were no big moments for us, we suffered so much, we didn\u2019t have the strength for\nnothing. We were -- we were not there to celebrate. We were thinking of constantly, what\nhappened to our people? Who is alive, who is gonna come back? How could you celebrate? How\ncould you think differently? For God\u2019s sake.",
        "Q: Well, I wasn\u2019t suggesting celebrating. I was just wondering if it was sort of a turning point --",
        "A: No, our thoughts were always with the Jews that we knew went to Bergen-Belsen and we\nwere always thinking, who is going to come back. That was our only thought. There were no\nfuture for us.",
        "Q: So what happened next? You stayed at this camp?",
        "A: Nothing except I stayed in Palestine. I didn\u2019t go back to Greece.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve never been back to Greece to this day?",
        "A: Once I was as a tourist in 1972. But I never went back to Greece to stay there.",
        "Q: Did you find anything in Greece of your --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t go looking for anything in Greece. In 1972 it was too late to find something. There\nwas nobody left, there was nothing left.",
        "Q: So, can you tell me about your time in Palestine?",
        "A: What\u2019s there the time in Palestine? I left the camp when the camp moved from Gaza to a\ndifferent place. They used to call them [indecipherable] the twe. [indecipherable] Mo-Moisis\nriver, in the Suez Canal. We were given the choice to go to Palestine or to go with them, with the\ncamp, with the United Nations. I decided to stay in Palestine, I didn\u2019t want any more part of\nrefugee\u2019s camp, and I parted from the United Nations, went to Tel Aviv and with my parents\nstarted to make a living and find a job.",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: What did I do?",
        "Q: What kind of work, that is.",
        "A: I was a worker on a company that used to make perambulators, they used to call them in\nEnglish, babies carriages. I used to work there.",
        "Q: And how long did you do that work?",
        "A: Til I was drafted into the Israeli army.",
        "Q: And when was that?",
        "A: That was in 1947, the end of \u201947, when the United Nations established the petition of\nPalestine and the State of Israel.",
        "Q: So, can you tell me about your army experience?",
        "A: I was in the army before [indecipherable] in Israel. I was helping other organizations save\npeople from Europe. I smuggle refugees into the land because be -- the British would not allow --\ndid not allow any more Jews to come into Palestine. I helped as much as I could. When the\npetition was made, like everybody else, I was draft in the ar -- drafted in the army, and I was in\nthe army from the beginning of 1948 til July 1949, a year and a half. In 1949, when we -- truce\nwas proclaimed and the legitimate state -- government of Israel was established, when the\nelections took place, I was released from the army. I was married in the army, because my wife\nhappened to be also a soldier. And in 1949 I left Israel and went back to cu -- went to Cuba to a\ncousin of mine, hoping that from there I would be able to join my parents in the United States,\nbecause my parents were given a visa for the United States, where I did not get one myself.",
        "Q: How come? Was there a reason why you didn't get one?",
        "A: Yes. There was a quota for it in every country in Europe. My father was born in Yugoslavia,\nthe quota was free. The Greek quota was filled for the next 30 years. I was born in Greece, so I\ndidn\u2019t qualify for a visa.",
        "Q: At this point what was your citizenship?",
        "A: Spanish. But the quota for the United States was not based on citizenship, it was based on the\ncountry where you were born. It\u2019s a funny thing, at the time there were about 30,000 Greeks\nasking for a visa, and the quota for the -- for Greece was 308 a year. In other words, there was a\nquota for about a hundred years.",
        "Q: And when did your parents leave Palestine?",
        "A: They left the beginning of 1946, and they came here in th-the beginning of 1946, after the\nwar.",
        "Q: And were you usually living with and around other Jews from Salonika while you\u2019re in\nPalestine?",
        "A: No, I rented a place, and I was living on my own.",
        "Q: And -- and how did you meet your wife?",
        "A: We met in the army, we were both soldiers. We happened to g -- were both from Greece, and\nwe worked together from the end of 1947 til 19 -- til 1949 where a law came that every woman\nthat was married would get a discharge from the army. So in April of 1949, we were married and\nshe was able to start her civil life, where I continued to the army --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Nick\nLevi. This is tape number three, side A. I just wanted to correct one thing, if you can tell me\nabout your time, I believe, in Torino in Italy, and then just explain -- I think you went to the\nMiddle East by ship.",
        "A: [indecipherable] a few weeks, maybe two weeks tops. There\u2019s nothing to say. We used to\nhave the same rations as the Spanish -- as the British soldiers, very good treat. We were was --\nwere taken care. We had medical facilities and we were waiting, we were told, to go back to\nGreece. So our stay there d-doesn\u2019t leave an -- an impression on me, it was a very short one.",
        "Q: And where were you staying while you were there?",
        "A: Well, there were -- there were tents, like the soldiers. We\u2019re there in tents.",
        "Q: What you were saying before was a British army camp, 1s that right?",
        "A: In the British army camp, yes. All the time in Torino was the British army camps.",
        "Q: And you -- sorry. And I just wanted to make sure, since earlier we -- you were talking about\nTaranto, but this was Torino.",
        "A: Torino.",
        "Q: Okay. And from there you were taken by ship, is that correct?",
        "A: Today with a convoy were taken by ship to Egypt, to ca -- to Port-Siad. And we -- Port-Siad\nby trucks. We crossed the Suez, we went to el Cantara, and by railroad from el Cantara to Gaza.\nWe went the whole -- the whole Sinai peninsula to Gaza.",
        "Q: And can you tell me -- I know you were telling me how you met your wife, can you tell me\nher name?",
        "A: Her name is Flora. Her Hebrew name is Shoshanna.",
        "Q: And what was her maiden name before marriage?",
        "A: Cohen. C-o-h-e-n.",
        "Q: And where -- can you tell me where she was from?",
        "A: She also was born, I think in Greece or Yugoslavia. Now -- now it\u2019s -- now it\u2019s Macedonia.\nShe was born in Macedonia, and lived all her life in Salonika.",
        "Q: Okay, now did you -- so now if you could tell me how you wound up going to Cuba.",
        "A: Very simple. As I explained to you, my quota to come to United States will take about a\nhundred years. We had a good cousin in Cuba who lived there -- went there after the first World\nWar. And we had a cousin there who was able to obtain for us a residency in Cuba. So we left\nPalestine in November of 1949. We spent one month with a cousin of ours 1n barce -- in geno --\nGenoa in Italy. And from Genoa we went to Columbia and by plane from Columbia -- from\nBarankia, we went to Cuba.",
        "Q: How long were you in Cuba and what was it like living there?",
        "A: We were in Cuba 1950 to 1953, three and a half years.",
        "Q: And can you tell me what it was like to live there?",
        "A: Was a paradise. I\u2019m talking to you before Castro. We had a good business, we used to do\nbusiness. We used to import textiles from the United States and sell them in Cuba. We had no\ncomplaints, we made very good friends. We had our family, our cousins and uncles there.\nUnfortunately, in 1952 there was go -- they were going to have elections in Cuba, and the next\ndictator decided that he wanted to be the president. His name was Fulgencio Batista. He made\nthe coup in March of 1952, took over the government, insta -- installed a dictatorship. From the\nexperience we had with dictators, our only way -- the only thing left for us was to leave Cuba.",
        "Q: Before that it was -- you didn\u2019t experience any -- any anti-Semitism?",
        "A: Are you kidding, no, nobody ever asked us if we were Jewish or where we | -- where we were\nliving, where we came from. Absolutely nothing. I can tell you off the record, you can take it --\nno, you can take it off later on, that the situation was so good in Cuba that the man who wanted\nto be [indecipherable] senator offered us money -- we were there only six months -- offered us\nmoney to give us -- no, no -- yeah, to give us a Cuban citizenship so we can vote for him.",
        "Q: But you did not become Cuban citizens?",
        "A: No, no. We were not crazy.",
        "Q: Okay. And so tell me -- tell me what happened next.",
        "A: What happened next is that we were lucky, for once in our life. Presidents Tru-Truman passed\na law in Congress admitting 50,000 deported people from the war to the United States on top of\nthe [indecipherable] the -- the quota. Being as I was one of the deportees, I qualified, and in May\nof 1953, I came to the United States.",
        "Q: And that was to New York?",
        "A: And that\u2019s my life, that\u2019s was to New York where my father and mother were living. They\nwere still alive.",
        "Q: What kind of work did you do in the U.S.?",
        "A: Insurance. I was selling insurance because I knew Spanish. I was selling insurance to the\nPuerto geetans -- portag -- port -- to the Puerto Ricans, to the Dominicans, but I didn\u2019t stay too\nlong because a friend of my father had a furniture store and he needed somebody to speak spa --\nSpanish so he ca-can attract the Spanish clientele. So I went to work for him as a -- as a -- not\nbookkeeper, how you call that? The people they give mortgages, and things like that there.",
        "Q: Broker, or something?",
        "A: No, no, no, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- the people they approve the pr -- they approve the mortgages, how\nyou call them?",
        "Q: Not a lender? No? I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Anyway, we went there to took over the store and I work for him til -- til -- was 1950 -- 54\nand -- til 1955. In 1955 he sold the store and the company that financed -- oh, financed, financed\n-- the company that financed the store saw the quality of approval I was given, asked me to work\nfor them. So I went to work for them, and I stayed with them til 1956 - \u201957, something like that.\nThen I decided that I wanted something better than that. I went to another furniture company for\nabout six months that decided to -- the man in charge decided to make his own company, so I\nwent with him, always in the same kind of business, as a finance manager, and I stayed with\nthem til -- and I\u2019m confused.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry.",
        "A: 1950 something -- no, no, ti -- 1964 -- ti -- 1964, when we built Town Craft, the company that\nwas -- that was the partners. Yeah, we establish a company that used to sell furniture and all\nkinds of equipment on -- on monthly installments. So, with a little bit of a capital that I had at the\ntime, I became again, the finance manager of the new company, being also a partner. I stayed\nwith this company from 1965 to 1976. In 1976 through a friend of mine who used to work on gr\n-- eyeglasses frames, representing a Fr-French factory in the United States, I was given the\nopportunity to go with him, and to represent this French company from 1976 til 1991, where at\nthe age of 70, I decided to retire.",
        "Q: Well, thank you, that\u2019s very detailed. Y-You have a good memory. I know some of the dates\nare a little rough.",
        "A: I hope it di -- I hope it didn\u2019t confuse you because I\u2019m so emotional now, maybe --",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay, that\u2019s okay.",
        "A: -- s-something as far as the dates only is concerned, might be confusing.",
        "Q: No, it\u2019s fine. I just have a few more questions and -- and -- and if you could not -- I have to\nkeep it quiet, sorry.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: No, I\u2019m -- [tape break]. So, can you just tell me about your parents, how long did they live\nand they were always in New York?",
        "A: Oh, my parents came in 1946 to the States. My father died in November of 1959 and my\nmother died in October 1968.",
        "Q: And tell me -- I believe you have children, is that right?",
        "A: I have two children. One is a dentist, he 1s 53 years old, and one is an architect, he just turned\n50.",
        "Q: Can you tell me their names?",
        "A: The first name is from the Hebrew Menachem, his name is Meny. And the second name -- the\nsecond one is the Hebrew name for her father, who was Moshe, and his name is Murray. Meny is\nthe dentist, married to a wonderful girl, has two children, lives in Jersey. One of a gr -- my\ngrandchildren 1s in third year in Union College, and the other one 1s just finishing high school.\nThey live in West Caldwell. They are very, very active in orga -- Jewish organizations. They\u2019re\nvery, very active in their synagogue. That\u2019s why their -- my daughter-in-law asked my wife if\nshe wanted to be the guest speaker for the Shoah this year. Now, my second son is not married.\nHe lives very happily in Manhattan, but we are not happy that he 1s all alone in his life.",
        "Q: And tell me about your own involvement, I believe, with -- with the organization, I believe in\nthe 80\u2019s you were president, can you tell me a little bit?",
        "A: Yeah, we went -- we came here 1953. At that time survivors from the Holocaust were also\ncoming from Greece on the base of this law that I told you, 50,000 the pre -- the displaced\npeople. Most of them did not speak English, did not know any professions. They quin -- they\ncame here with the HIAS. Some of them were sent to Flint, Michigan, others were sent here. So\nthere was an organization that in a way was trying to help them, with the language, with the daily\nlife, with the profession, with health, that was called [indecipherable] brotherhood of America.\nMy father was a member of this organization and we became members immediately. We became\nactive. While the old people that build the organization in 1917, after the first war passed away,\nslowly but steadily, we took care of it. And in the elections in the 80\u2019s, I was elected president. I\nserved two terms, because elections were two years, I served fer -- four years as president, and is\nstill today very active in this organization. I\u2019m a member of the central board of [indecipherable]\nand I participate in everything that I can help them.",
        "Q: Are there other ways that you have been involved with either groups of Greek survivors, and -\n- and those sorts of organizations?",
        "A: First we -- I helped quite a few of them that decided to relocate from Greece to -- to United\nStates. Most of them did not stay here, they went to San Francisco. I helped them as much as I\ncould because at that time I needed help myself. And I participate in every fundraising from\nIsrael. I have certificates of Israeli bonds for what I did for the bonds. I sh -- was member of\nB\u2019nai Zion. I was -- I was helping, and I still help UJA, and as much as I can I try to keep our\nSephardic tradition because unfortunately we are not as many as Ashkenazi. Our language, our\nLadino is disappearing, it\u2019s not like the Yiddish. And I have a feeling that after our generation\nthere\u2019ll be nothing left of the Jewish tradition.",
        "Q: Were you able to teach Ladino to your children?",
        "A: My children do not speak Ladino, I\u2019m sorry to say that. They do not speak Spain -- French.\nThey speak -- they speak Spanish, they learned Hebrew. They\u2019re involved with their crowd, and\neverything that\u2019s Jewish, thank God for it. They are more or less observant. They participate in\ntheir synagogue, and that\u2019s the best I can hope.",
        "Q: Do you think that your -- your faith helped you through all of your experiences?",
        "A: Ah, I'll be honest with you, no. I\u2019ve kept my fa -- my faith because it was part of my life from\nthe day I was born, but did not help me in any way, on the contrary, in quite a few instances, I\nsuffered because I was Jewish. And I don\u2019t mean just the Holocaust, I mean here in the United\nStates.",
        "Q: You did experience anti-Semitism here?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I w -- I was also thinking maybe -- sort of larger faith in God, did that help you to get\nthrough?",
        "A: No, the faith I had in God, I still have. I don\u2019t think it was too much, I hope it was more, but\nas far as I am concerned, He helps me, He exists, and [indecipherable] all the commandments I\ntried to follow, the si -- the rich words of our religion.",
        "Q: And you -- you have a Sephardic temple you go to in this area?",
        "A: Yes, we have a Sephardic temple in Forest Hills, where I belong, and where I a member of the\nboard.",
        "Q: Did you speak ch --",
        "A: And by the way, on this Sephardic temple, I was in the executive for at least seven years. I\u2019ve\nbeen on the Board of Directors of the temple from 1972 til today.",
        "Q: What\u2019s the name of the synagogue?",
        "A: Sephardic Jewish Brotherhood of Forest Hills. No, I\u2019m sorry, Sephardic Jewish Center of\nForest -- \u2019'm confusing with the brotherhood.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you ever talk to your sons about your experiences?",
        "A: Always. Always. As much as I tried to spare them the tales, they know the whole thing.",
        "Q: So you were willing to share with them your experiences?",
        "A: Oh yes. I\u2019m always willing to share my experiences. I was willing to make sure that the\nHolocaust doesn\u2019t disappear after I disappear.",
        "Q: I -- I know a lot of survivors for many decades did not talk about their experiences. Was that\nsimilar for you, for awhile you didn\u2019t talk?",
        "A: No, I always tried not to talk about it with strangers, not with my family. Many people\ncomplain, why didn\u2019t you say what\u2019s happened to you? I don\u2019t want any part of it. I try not -- I\ncannot forget, but I\u2019m trying not to remember. I [indecipherable] all right to give other people the\nsuffering, to a certain extent, of what I went. It doesn\u2019t help. The only thing I try to do is m -- to\nmake sure that they know -- they know the Holocaust existed, and to perpetuate the memory of\nthe Holocaust.",
        "Q: I hope you realize that by doing this interview that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ve done. I know it\nhasn\u2019t been diff -- it hasn\u2019t been easy for you to do this interview.",
        "A: Darling, that\u2019s why I decided to give you the interview.",
        "Q: I\u2019m -- I\u2019m very grateful and -- and so is the museum. I -- I realize that it\u2019s been difficult for\nyou to re -- remember.",
        "A: It\u2019s done.",
        "Q: Is there -- a couple other small questions, one 1s did you -- or do you still receive restitution,\nreparations from Germany\u2019?",
        "A: Yes, I do. From conference number two.",
        "Q: And tell me how -- you told me this before we started the interview, tell me how you came to\nchange your name from your birth name to Nick.",
        "A: During Greek wa -- during the German occupation, I couldn\u2019t use the name Haim, so I\nbecame Nick. When the whole thing finished, and all my family disappeared, the few friends that\nwere left, they were Orthodox, and they called me Nick. So when the time came to become a\nUSS. citizen, I deti -- decided that it was foolish for my friends to call me Nick and my name to\nbe Haim. So I changed officially my name, the day -- the day I became a citizen, to Nick. And all\nmy documents in the United States, from the Social Security, from my work, from my taxes,\nfrom everything are under the name of Nick.",
        "Q: Okay, well, is there -- is there anything else that you would like to --",
        "A: By the way, something more that is trivia, but maybe this will help explain why I use the\nname Nick. In the old country they used to give the name Nick -- used to give the name Haim to\nbabies so they survive. I had a brother who died at the age of four. So, his name was David. My\nparents decided to put me the name Haim. When the emancipation came, the Jews of Salonika,\nwho were very much involved in French culture, decided that Haim is not such a good Jewish\nname. Instead of giving the name Haim, let\u2019s give the guy a name of survivor. And the name\nthey choose for all the Haims was Victor. Most of the Victors are Haim.",
        "Q: That\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: So Victor become Nicky -- became Nick.",
        "Q: Huh. Well, thi -- but this name you ch --",
        "A: This you can keep off the record, I mean, I don\u2019t want --",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting, but this name -- but you chose Nick even much earlier.",
        "A: Be chose -- no, no, no, no. I chose Nick [indecipherable]. I chose Victor, and from Victor,\nNick.",
        "Q: I-I thought Nick was from Nicholas, a Greek sort of name.",
        "A: Ni -- Nick -- Nicholas. Nicholas in Greek means the winner of the pa -- of the people. Nicos\nLaus. Laus means people.",
        "Q: And -- and the brother you had, was he older? It\u2019s before you were born?",
        "A: No, he was younger than me, and he died before I was born.",
        "Q: So he was older -- he -- he was older -- he was born --",
        "A: He died four years old, before I was born.",
        "Q: And do you know how he died?",
        "A: No. I know it was a sickness, I don\u2019t know if it -- 1t was an epidemic or what. My parents\nnever spoke about it.",
        "Q: Well, I want to thank you for taking the time today. Is there -- is there anything at else -- at all\nyou would like to say to conclude?",
        "A: No, not -- I haven\u2019t got, unless you need something else. I\u2019m always available.",
        "Q: Well, you\u2019ve -- you\u2019ve been wonderful, I really appreciate. Thank you very much, and --",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome. You\u2019re always welcome, do you feel like coming again, and we\u2019re here.",

        "Q: Did this apply to you or not?",
        "Q: So -- so you were saying you never had to wear the yellow star?",

        "Q: How did your cousins become th -- Jewish police?",

        "A: Yes. As I told you, we lived in the more or less Greek neighborhood, Orthodox neighborhood\nand all my friends, up to today, most of them were Greeks.",
        "A: Yes. It\u2019s a very funny thing, as I told you, our city was 10 kilometers from Philippi, and the\nstreet name wher-where we had our home was Bucephalus Street, the name of Alexander the\nGreat\u2019s horse.",
        "A: No, no, no, this was after we moved in our own home. Originally I was born in a -- we were\nin a -- in an apartment, and as I told you, then we went to k -- Salonika, and after the few years\nwe moved to Kavala, and we had our home in Bucephalus, or Bucephalus Street.",
        "A: I think it was number 10, I\u2019m not sure.",
        "A: There\u2019s only -- there was only one synagogue in the city.",
        "A: Beth El, as far as I can remember.",
        "A: In 1935 or 1933, I\u2019m not sure about it, there was a revolution in Greece, where part of them\nand their -- the Prime Minister Venizelos was democratic and part of them was Royalist. Kavala\nchoose part of the democratic part of it, and the Royalists won the civil war, they bombed the\ncity and they destroyed our synagogue. What I remember is that after 1935 or \u201936, when there\nwas a dictatorship in Greece and this Metaxas, my uncle kiv -- came from Salonika and rebuilt\nthe synagogue.",
        "A: My uncle\u2019s name was Maurice Ashkenazi. He -- he was my mother\u2019s first cousin.",
        "A: No, no it -- Kavala was bombed, and part of the bombs destroyed the synagogue. Was not\nintentional.",
        "A: Not Greek political organizations. They were involved very much in Zionist organizations.",
        "A: Not exactly. I just remember [speaks Greek here] because my father represented them in\nKavala and used to raise money, funds for them. I don\u2019t remember another organization.",
        "A: Well, not til after the war. At the age of 18 I went to Athens at the university and then the war\ncame, th-the German occupation came and everything was --",
        "A: Entirely Sephardic.",
        "A: Yes, we did.",
        "A: Are you talking about 1933? I was 12 years old.",
        "A: Yes, we knew everything in Greece. As a matter of fact, most of the Greeks were against it --\nagainst Germany, and against the dic-dictatorship, especially my city, that even in 1933, as far as\nI can remember, had a Communist mayor.",
        "A: Everything that was happening to the Jews in Germany, and we were very much worried\nabout it.",
        "A: Yes, we knew about everything, and more or less we were ready, because we knew that\nGreek\u2019s turn was coming, that one way or the other, we\u2019ll be invaded.",
        "A: Through radio, through free newspapers, through contacts with the outside. We were free to\nvo -- to -- to travel, where there were no restrictions at all. We were free people, and we\u2019re very\nhappy people. We had also a ki -- a king who is so pro-Jewish. And the -- the government nek --\nnever took any measures against the Jews or made any discrimination. As a matter of fact, we\nhad at the Greek congress, a Jewish representative, and also a Jewish senator.",
        "A: No, we never thought of leaving Greece, except 1938, when we decided to come to the United\nStates. But as I told you before, we were aware what\u2019s happening all around the world, we were\nvery much worried about the problems in Palestine where the Arabs has revolted against England\nand against the Jews. We knew what was happening the Jews of -- of Germany, and we had\ndecided at the time maybe it was time to come to the States. What did happen is that we got our\nquota for our -- or our visa to come to the United States 1939, and at that time the war had started\nalready, so we couldn\u2019t move any more.",
        "A: I went to Athens in October 1939.",
        "A: No, it was before the war. The war in Greece started in 1940.",
        "A: They just -- the war had started in Poland already.",
        "A: Now we were always talking and were always very, very enthusiastic and hopeful that the\nFrench and the British would take good care of the Germans.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I was studying medicine. I was in the first year of medicine, at the ye -- University of Athens.",
        "A: Like everybody else, I was very happy about it. I was grateful that my parents could afford\nthe e -- the expense to send me there. I had no qualms about my future.",
        "A: No. The first year the main thing that we learned was anatomy and chemistry. It was a\npreliminary for the medical profession.",
        "A: There was only one Jewish student with me at medical stool -- school. The name was\nMittrani, and she was killed during the German occupation up in the Greek mountains, as a\npartisan.",
        "A: Nothing at all. Nothing at all. What it was was a fear of the Greek -- of the war that was\ncoming very close to Greece. As a matter of fact, the year after, 1940, October 28\"\", 1940, the\nItalians attacked Greece. Greek defended -- Greece defended itself, and to a certain extent we\nwere able to win against the Italians. That prompted Germany, in April of 1941 to conquer the\nwhole of the [indecipherable]. And how you call -- and occupy Greece.",
        "A: In Athens, nothing. We were very happy, and we thought it\u2019Il never happen. As a matter of\nfact, it\u2019s well known historically that the night before the Italians attacked Greece, there was a\nbig party given by the Greek government where the ge -- the Italian ambassador was part of the\ncrowd.",
        "A: No. I left Athens in 1940 with -- when the war started against the Italians. The Germans came\nto Greece in 1941, six months later. The university was closed, there was no reason for me to\nstay in Athens.",
        "A: No, I did not.",
        "A: No, the school closed as soon as the Italians attacked, because almost everybody went to the\narmy, were drafted.",
        "A: No, I was not drafted, I was too young. To be drafted in Greece you have to be 21 years old,\nand at that time I was hardly 20.",
        "A: Yes. Everybody was afraid, everybody was making plans, and everybody was trying more or\nless, to save his family, to stay together.",
        "A: After that the Germans came in, and we figure that Kavala was a very small city, we might as\nwell go to Salonika and we went to Salonika.",
        "A: My father made the decision, yes, after the Germans came. In 19 -- in April 1941 we went to\nSalonika. Salonika was occupied by the Germans already.",
        "A: Well, the Germans divided Greece in three parts. Part of gre -- of Greece, the southern part\nwas given to the Italians. The northern part of was kept for the Germans and the part of the north\nof Greece that was an exit to medi -- t-to the Mediterranean was given to the Bulgarians, who at\nthe times were allied with the Germans. That was one of the reasons that everybug -- bu -- one\nwho could leave Kavala, left, because we were afraid to stay under the bulger -- Bulgarian\ngovernment.",
        "A: Because there was an experience from World War I that the Bulgarians had occupied the city,\nand th-the -- 1-it was only torture and -- and -- and fear, and [indecipherable] killing people. So\neveryone who had an experience from before -- not us, before, in \u201921 we were not in Kavala, was\ntelling us what it means to be under the Bulgars. So we decided to go to Salonika.",
        "A: We figured at the time we\u2019d much better to be in the Greeks -- in the big city so we\u2019d be more\nprotected.",
        "A: No, no that was the fear that the Bulgarians insisted that this part of Macedonia belonged to\nthem, and we shoul -- we shouldn\u2019t be Greeks, we shouldn\u2019t speak Greek, we shouldn\u2019t have our\nown associations. We should turn around and more or less be like a -- like a secret police, and\ndenounce our fr -- our Greek friends. That we were not ready to do.",
        "A: We rented an apartment next to my uncle, and my father started from scratch all over again,\ndoing his business with the tobacco people.",
        "A: We made the move in the end of April 1941.",
        "A: Yes, it was just the beginning of the occupation, moving was still free. I think the restrictions\ncame sometime in June of \u201941, but don\u2019t quote me, I\u2019m not sure about the date.",
        "A: Was mostly Jewish.",
        "A: Well, I think at the time were about 70,000 Jews. It was a big community and more or less we\nhad our own neighborhoods without being a ghetto. We were free to move, we had Greek\nOrthodox living with us, but mostly were Jewish.",
        "A: Yes, the name of the street was, street Saron de Poru 18, was exactly 1-1n front of the Salonika\nJewish community.",
        "A: Right now, I wouldn\u2019t know.",
        "A: At that time nobody touched it til the deportations started.",
        "A: Re-Restriction of traveling. Taxes that we couldn\u2019t afford, restrictions in business, and the\nmost important, something that even today I cannot explain, there were about 150 German Jews\nthat\u2019s came to Salonika at the expense of the Jewish community that took over the functioning of\nthe community, where the community council was jailed.",
        "A: Was the elected Jewish community council was jailed the t -- by the Germans, including the\nchief rabbi.",
        "A: No, these were German Jews that came in Salonika after the German occupation and I still in\nmy mind say they were not Jewish, or they were part of a -- I don\u2019t know what, because we were\nforced to maintain them, to feed them, and when the deportations started, they were the shupos,\nthe -- the Jewish --",
        "A: Jewish police that the German imposed.",
        "A: They -- they didn\u2019t tou -- they did not touch them.\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: We was well off in [indecipherable]. My father had two associates who were Greek\nOrthodox, and one of them was very, very influential in the local government. As a matter of\nfact, in 1941, when the Germans were ready to attack Greece, my father was able, with his\nassociates, to rent a ship and transfer all our assets to Athens because we were sure that if\nsomething happens there, Athens will not be touched, will not be bombed. So our luck was that\nwhen the boat arrived in Piraeus -- the name of the boat Stiliani -- Piraeus was bombed, the boat\nwas sunk. All our asset were destroyed. We had insurance with Lloyd of London, however the\ninsurance was in Greek dol -- mon -- drachmas. So after the war, one billion Greek drachma\nwasn\u2019t even worth an dollar. So we lost everything.",
        "A: In April 1941, when the gi -- Germans attacked Greece, they bombed the port of Piraeus,\nbecause it was an expeditionary force of British, who had come to help -- to help the Greeks. As\na matter of fact their stand was in Thermopylae and then they did [indecipherable] into Crete,\nand from Crete, when they lost Crete, they went back to [indecipherable]. So the Germans were\nbombing all the ports of Greece at the time, and our luck, which ship had to be sunk there.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s very, very unusual, because at that time to get a ship was more than [indecipherable],\nit was influence, and you know, having people help you.",
        "A: This was a ship with all our assets. In other words, all the merchandise that we had in Kavala,\nwe transferred to Athens and we were left without anything. That\u2019s why it\u2019s said when we went\nto Salonika, my father had to start from scratch because we were penniless.",
        "A: Very. Very difficult because at that time is -- the only business in Greece was the black\nmarket. There was no food, there were no utilities, and everybody had to fend itself, and we used\nto live on coupons. But my father had many acquaintances from the past and he was able to start\nhis business all over again.",
        "A: Exactly the same business.",
        "A: As soon as they came, there were restrictions on business, and restrictions 1n traveling, about\ntwo months after they came. In 1942, they started giving -- imposing taxes to the Jewish\ncommunity that was very hard to be kept -- to be. And then, on, as I told you, in July or August\n1942, we had the concentration at the Liberty Place, where people were cheated -- were t -- was,\nyou know, t -- tortured, and most of the yonkers -- youngsters were taken for hard works in the\nsouth of -- of Greece, and were separated from their families.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have to go personally. The people that I knew, my cousins, my parents, my friends,\nhad to go on a Saturday morning in this particular place, called Liberty Place, stand in the sun in\nAugust, for a whole day, beaten and humiliated, segregated, and then sent back home.",
        "A: Number one because of my age, and number two because as a Spanish citizen, I was neutral,\nand supposedly the Germans expected our neutrality.",
        "A: 1941, I was 20 years o -- no, that was 1942, I was 21 years old.",
        "A: The ages was from 21 to 50.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, we left Spain in 1492. We kept our citizenship since then. One of my relatives -- and I\ndon\u2019t want to brag about it, happened to be Don Isaac Abravanel. He kept his citizenship, he left\nSpain, he kept on being representative of the Spanish government, even during the Inquisition.\nAnd through him we kept our citizenship til we came to the United States. I came to the United\nStates with a Spanish passport, and I changed my citizenship when I became an American\ncitizen.",
        "A: My parents wer -- yes, both my parents, by marriage, were Spanish citizen. My father was\nSpanish citizen, my mother was -- Ashkenazi was one of the part of Jews that came 600 early --\n600 years earlier to Salonika from Poland, and they kept the name Ashkenazi to distinguish\nthemselves from Sephardi.",
        "A: No, wa -- my mother was Sephardic, after 600 years.",
        "A: Sure. No, I was always a Spanish citizen. I had the right to choose a citizenship when I\nbecame 21, but at that time, Greek was o -- Greece was occupied already by the Germans.",
        "A: I was born Spanish citizen, and I be -- it was always Spanish citizen all my life, til I change\nmy citizenship when I came to the United States and became a u -- a USS. citizen.",
        "A: No, a family tradition. Just a family tradition.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. They knew nothing about Spain, except the language.",
        "A: The Spanish what?",
        "A: Okay, a little bit of history. When Isabella and Ferdinand conquered Spain, they had two\ncouncilors that were Jewish. One was Hasdai ben Shiprut and one was Don Isaac Abravanel.\nThey were very high on the ca -- ca -- in the Spanish government and they were very appreciated\nby the kings. From this too, isibi -- Isaac -- Hasdai ben Shiprut decided to convert and stay with\nSpain. Isaac Abravanel decided to leave the country. He didn't want to convert, he didn\u2019t want to\nlive under the Inquisition. So Isaac Abravanel up til today is being honored by the whole Jewish\ncommunity, where the name of Hasdai Shiprut almost disappeared.",
        "A: My father\u2019s side.",
        "A: No, not at all. Was never questioned. As a matter of fact [indecipherable] documents from the\nCortez, the Spanish congress, signed by the king of Spains, testify the citizenship of my father.",
        "A: From the beginning, that is, the Germans entered Greece, they always made a difference\nbetween the Italian citizens, and the Spanish citizen and the Turkish citizens because the\n[indecipherable] neutral and the Italians were allies. So the Italian citizens, the Spanish citizen\nand the Turkish citizens were not touched at all. But --",
        "A: -- but we still couldn\u2019t travel, and we still couldn\u2019t choose our own profession or our own\nStatus.",
        "A: Well, my father\u2019s si -- business started all over again after the occupation. We had lost\neverything with the sinking of the boat.",
        "A: Well, his bi -- his business was privilege for the Germans because they were stealing all the\ntobacco from Greece, and sending them to gr -- to Germany for -- for free, and my father was the\nbusiness that provided the materials to [indecipherable] and export the tobacco.",
        "A: Yeah, he continued til 1943, that we were deported.",
        "A: Their hardships, that they have what to eat, they couldn't move, they couldn\u2019t congregate.\nThey were slaves that were in -- th-that were occupied, they were not free.",
        "A: Most of them had to give their jobs, yes. Have to give their jobs, and the Germans took all\ntheir proceed -- all their merchandise and everything they had. It was a terrible situation.",
        "A: My father didn\u2019t go, my uncle was too old, my cousins went.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t have to tell it because we were in the middle of a city, we saw it happening.",
        "A: Yes. We saw everything that happened.",
        "A: Well, I was not part of it, and I was part of it, because personally I was not, but family-wise,\nmy whole family was part of it. There was no distinction. The citizenship was, how you call that?\n[indecipherable] something happen. We didn\u2019t choose it.",
        "A: Well, they all re -- perished in Auschwitz, from the first to the last one, and my uncle.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remem -- I don\u2019t remember how many billions of marks they requested at the time.",
        "A: Well, what was about, it\u2019s one way you oppress the Jewish population, because they thought\nthey wouldn\u2019t be able to make their demands.",
        "A: No explanation. No explanation at all. They needed the money, they should raise the money\nfor them, period.",
        "A: That was 1n a way thought, but right away they started with the -- the extreme measures, with\nputting the[indecipherable] on the Jews. By moving the whole population into ghettos, and a few\nmonths later, in March, the deportations started.",
        "A: That was completely different. The Germans said that they needed materials to fortify the\ncity. And being that the German -- the Jewish cemetery was full of marble, and good materials --\nwas a cemetery that was six or 700 years old, they decided that they needed the materials. They\ncontacted the Greek government that was -- at the time was at quixli -- a quisling government.\nAnd the government said that the f -- you destroy the cemetery, will be a good favor for us\nbecause we can expand our university. And this is what happened. Today, where the Jewish\ncemetery was, is the University of Salonika.",
        "A: I saw the destruction of the cemetery and I was part of it in a way, because they gave the\nJewish community a small place for a cemetery outside the city, and the people that could afford\nto do it, had to move the remains of their relatives to the new cemetery. Part of my family\ncontributed into removing the remains of my grandmother from this cemetery to the new one,\nand the graves at the time was meant to have six people, six remain of people in one grave. My\ngrandmother is still buried on the new cemetery in Salonika.",
        "A: It happened way after the ransom. The loot that they took from the cemetery was not part of\nthe money that we told to -- to raise and pay the Germans. Com-completely different. It was not\neven at the same time, was later.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that. [indecipherable] it\u2019s true, but I don\u2019t know when was it.",
        "A: The -- the starvation was general. Was not just the Jewish. As I told you, we had coupons in\norder to get certain amount of food every week and quite a few families, Jewish and Orthodox,\nno distinction there, chose many times not to report a death, to go to the cemetery and drop there\nthe corpse, in order to save the coupon, so they can have some extra measure of food. To tell the\ntruth, I mean, you cannot describe what was happen, but this was not just the Jews, was general.\nWas the whole population.",
        "A: Lack of imports, lack of commerce, lack of cultivation, bef -- por -- people were afraid to go\nto the -- to the fields. Lack of fear. The -- the partisans [indecipherable] if you left the city you\nexpose yourself, because they were there to -- to hit and kill as many Jews as they could -- that\u2019s\nmany Germans as they could. There were many, many, many reasons for it. I could keep on\nenumerating to you an awful lot of reasons why the population was starving.",
        "A: Was in contact with parti -- no. We knew about them, but personally I didn\u2019t know any. I\nknew my friend that I told you were in medical school, who went to the mountains as a partisan\nand was killed there.",
        "A: We participated, but we did not have to. After all, we were not Spaniards, we were Jewish.",
        "A: As Spanish citizens, we did not have to move to the ghetto. What happened is that where we\nlived became part of the ghetto, but we did not have to move. We kept our apartment, we did not\nmove at all.",
        "A: I had a business with a friend of mine who was also a Spanish citizen, name is Zaga Tenyo,\nwho used to produce --",
        "A: Dri -- drinks. And the name of the factory we had was called Olympic. There was drinks in\nenvelopes that we used to sell.",
        "A: Soft drinks.",
        "A: Considering the circumstances, it was doing very well.",
        "A: Yes, definitely, definitely. I was thinking to continue my studies, but 1t couldn\u2019t happen,\nbecause when it ca -- when I was ready to go to school, I was already 30 years old. I had lost 10\nyears, between the concentration camp, going to Morocco, going to [indecipherable], going to\nthe Israeli army. 1939 became automatically 1949.",
        "A: We\u2019re talking about ninet -- beginning of \u201942, and beginning of 1943. The Jews could not\nmove into their own city, could not travel, could not work. At night they had to go back, they\ncouldn\u2019t go out at night. They couldn\u2019t even go from one borough to the other because they were\nprohibited to take the tramways.",
        "A: No, this did not apply to me, I never wore a [indecipherable]. I was never told to live in a\nghetto. I happened to live in a ghetto because that\u2019s where I lived when they established the\nghetto.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Neither my parents. That\u2019s why we were able to take the bus and to take the tra -- the\ntramway, because nobody could distinguish us as Jews unless they knew us from before.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. What I remember is that they created the ghetto, they were the conquerors, and\nthey created the Jewish police to more or less supervise any [indecipherable] that the Germans\nhad imposed and also in a way, take care of -- so there\u2019d be no crime. Actually, we were a\npopulation very pacific. We never rioted, we never stole from our -- from one to the other. We\nlive pacifically there, waiting to see what\u2019s going to happen.",
        "A: Yeah, we were all Jewish.",
        "A: Yes. My cousins were Jewish police.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t have to treat me, I was free, as a Spaniard. I was not treated as a Jew.",
        "A: And -- let me explain something more. The reason that many people paid money and tried to\nbecome Jewish police, because there was a rumor flooded by the Germans that the Jewish police\nwill not be touched, will remain where they were, and will not be deported. So people were\n[indecipherable] were fighting to became Jewish police.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: My great cousin was David, my second one was Solomon, the third one was Henry, and I\ndon\u2019t remember the name of the fourth one. This was on my uncle\u2019s side. On my aunt\u2019s side,\nthere was only one that was her -- his name was Maurice -- Maurice Seedis.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Was include in the ghetto because we happened to be there, and we were there\n[indecipherable] Jewish because all the [indecipherable] family was part of our life. We were\nliving with them.",
        "A: Well, the salvation was there, as I though it was part of the Jewish life and the Christian life.\nThe traveling from one city to the other was not permitted. Traveling at night we were afraid. We\ntried to help as much we could our Jewish families and the whole Jewish community, and --",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] period.",
        "A: We were able to help them money-wise because both my friend and myself continued in our\nbusiness of the so -- of the soft git -- drinks.",
        "A: [indecipherable] what can I say -- tell you. What was changing was the fear, period.",
        "A: No, there was no guarantee, as a matter of fact, even with the citizenship, finally we were\ndeported.",
        "A: Yes, everybody worried about it.",
        "A: First deportation was in March 1943, I think it was the 23\" of March.",
        "A: We knew about it because we saw people pi -- taken from the ghetto and sent to the railroad\nstation in order to be deported. It was not a secret.",
        "A: There -- there were five ghettos and each ghetto went to the railroad station one at a time and\nsometimes half of the time because there were 23 deportations.",
        "A: No.\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Well, the situation in Greece, like every occupied country, people were against the Germans\nand most of them became partisans in the mountains. When the Germans had to travel by\nrailroad, they used to brought -- put in front of the locomotive, a wagon with Greek hostages, just\nin case there was a bomb in the railroad tracks, so the wagon of the Jewish -- of the hostages will\nbe blown up, and not the Germans. Also, when they had any skirmishes with the partisans, and\none of two Germans were killed, in the morning of the [indecipherable] they used to have lorries,\nand [indecipherable] the city, and pick up for every German that was killed, six people that\npeacefully will go into work in the morning, and execute them. So, it\u2019s impossible to describe the\nfear we lived in, regardless of citizenship. When they picked up cit -- when picked up hostages,\nthey didn't ask you what citizenship, they didn\u2019t ask if you were Jewish, you\u2019re just one of the\nhostages, period.",
        "A: Yes, quite a few of my friends were killed this way, were executed this way.",
        "A: It was impossible. The only h-help they could give to us, it\u2019s either to hide a Jew, or to take\ntheir belongings and hide them, hopefully to give them back to them when they come back, after\nthe war. That\u2019s the only thing they could do for us.",
        "A: Yes, I know a situation like that, where quite [indecipherable] precious things were given\naway to Greek friends, who unfortunately, after the war, they didn\u2019t -- not all of them gave them\nback to the Jews. Most of them had a famous saying; I\u2019m sorry they didn\u2019t kill you too. So they\nwere [indecipherable] not anti-Semitics, but they were humans. Whatever they could loot and\nkeep, they kept. Maybe we\u2019re Jews who would have done the same thing. Who knows?",
        "A: No, not even today. As I told you, I still correspond with Greek friends that, as in Athens, or\nin Salonika were very good friends, and we keep in touch with their families and with our\nfamily.",
        "A: No. The synagogues were closed and occupied. Most of them became stables of the German\narmy. We could not, of course, bake matzohs or things like that for Passover. We kept it quiet in\nthe house, we used to do our prayers, and that\u2019s it.",
        "A: No, I never did.",
        "A: Yes, I do, but I keep them for myself.",
        "A: I had interaction with the Germans that were sent to us from Germany, the 150 people I told\nyou before, because they were part of the shupos, and they used to interfere with our lives.",
        "A: In all ways. We were not free. We had to do what they told us to do.",
        "A: From the German Jews. You know, it\u2019s a funny thing. The Germans sent to Salonika six\npeople, only six people. And these six people recruited the Jewish police, and the 150 people that\ncome th -- came there before, and did the whole job of deporting close to 100,000 people, just\nwith six of them. It\u2019s fantastic, the way they were organized.",
        "A: Yes, we saw them, they circulate. As a matter of fact, was a fat one named Vincent -- Vincent\nCheni, who after the war was executed.",
        "A: No, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t. If I knew them, I don\u2019t remember them.",
        "A: They were taken 1n groups of people, and when the time came for the people around me, they\nwere taken like all the others. There were no exception.",
        "A: No. We were not touched, because we didn\u2019t wear the [indecipherable] and we were Spanish.\nWe were left in our apartment without being touched at all.",
        "A: That must have been sometime before Passover, between April and May, 1943.",
        "A: They were told to bring the money with them, to exchange the money to zlotys because they\nwere going to Poland, where Germany had decided to establish a Jewish state and were\nconcentrating all the Jews of Europe there. And people believed in that because the Chief Rabbi\nwas the first one to disseminate the -- the rumor, and they were going like sheep to the new\nplace, where they go -- were going to have a Jewish state.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t say the location. I th -- I think they mentioned the word Krakow, I\u2019m not sure\nabout it. And that\u2019s it. They gave all their money, they came happy back with zlotys and then\nthey were put into -- into wagons, animal wagons, locked there and transported.",
        "A: I had a good friend who was the secretary of the Greek governor of Macedonia, who kept on\ntelling me all the time, don\u2019t believe what they\u2019re telling you, try to escape. Go away. Don\u2019t stay\nhere. I didn\u2019t listen to him.",
        "A: The -- the Greeks knew what was going to happen, but they couldn\u2019t tell us. They were afraid\nof their own lives.",
        "A: I believed what the Greeks were saying. I didn\u2019t believe what the Germans were saying, but\nby Jewish tradition, I couldn\u2019t leave my father and mother, so I had to stay with them.",
        "A: Yes. We didn\u2019t know about the crematoria. Don\u2019t misunderstand me. We didn\u2019t know about\nthe concentration camps. But we knew that where they\u2019re sending them was nothing good.",
        "A: We heard the name Auschwitz when we arrived at Bergen-Belsen. When we arrived at the\ncamp, there was a group of Polish Jews that are concentrated there because they were\nArgentinean citizens. They told us what happen. They told us the extermination, we never\nbelieved them. It was impossible to believe.",
        "A: Well, we were told by the Spanish consul that they were making arrangements to take them to\nSpain. So we were looking for them, we were given passports. We -- part of our money we gave\nto the Spanish embassy to keep for us, and we were waiting the day that we\u2019ll be sent to Spain.\nThen it came in July 1943 that we were called -- actually our parents, the heads of families were\ncalled to a -- a synagogue named Beth Saul in Salonika with instructions, and instead of\ninstructions, they were taken to the railroad station and we were told to follow them and join\nthem there. So I took my mother and myself and we went to this place, called Baron Hirsch, to\njoin my father.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: We knew he was going to be there because we were told from the embassy to be there. But\nthe thinking was that we\u2019ll be given our passports back and we\u2019Il travel to Spain.",
        "A: Yes, we gave the passport to the Spanish embassy. We were deported, we were put in cattle\nwagons like all the other Jews. And at the end of July --",
        "A: If I knew this will be the -- the interview, I would never agreed.",
        "A: Yes, we\u2019re --",
        "A: We were put in cattle wagons like all the other Jews that went with us, and we were\ntransferred from there to Bergen-Belsen. It took about three weeks from Salonika to arrive to\nBergen-Belsen, and of all the hardships that I remember and the -- and the hungers that we went\nthrough, one date remains in my mind, and this is the 13\" of August, 1943. Our convoy had\nstopped in Nuremberg, and at that time Nuremberg had a raid from the British and American af -\n- air force. What I remember is a miracle. The Germans locked the wagons, went to shelters, and\nthe bombs kept on falling on the railroad station all around us, and miraculously our wagon was\nnot touched. August 13, 1943, and three days later we arrived in Bergen-Belsen.",
        "A: I think it was the 23\" deportation from Salonika. The very last one.",
        "A: We were about 300 all together.",
        "A: Yeah, we were acquainted during the -- the German occupation. This happened \u00b043, and we\nknew each other from 1941, when we arrived Salonika.",
        "A: [indecipherable] the train, locked in, yes.",
        "A: Don\u2019t ask. The best ans-answer is, don\u2019t ask.",
        "A: You talking about Dr. Matarasso?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, I -- for God\u2019s sake, of course. He came to the United States, he wrote a book, the\nname of the book is Birkenau. His name was Dr. Manashay.",
        "A: Doct -- Dr. Cuenca was one of the doctors of Salonika, yes.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t.",
        "A: I know about Dr. Manashay.",
        "A: Dr. Manashay wa -- survived, came to the United States and died in New York. But he wrote\na book, the book is named Birkenau, that unfa -- unfortunately, I gave it to somebody, never\nreturned it to me.",
        "A: No, no. We knew -- we knew that we\u2019re going to Poland. We didn\u2019t know we\u2019re going --\nwe\u2019re being taken to Germany.",
        "A: No, that was finish because we didn\u2019t have passports, we had nothing.",
        "A: Only what we had with us, period, nothing else.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Not any more because I didn\u2019t go back to Greece after the war.",
        "A: We heard about the negotiations after we were liberated from the camp. We were told that j --\nthe Joint Distribution Committee was trying through the Spanish government, to liberate as many\nJews as possible. Being that our names were known, because of our passports and our ci --\ncitizenship and everything, we were selected as the ones to be taken out of the camp. When we\nwent to the -- to germ -- to Spain, we learned that the whole thing was done through the\nPortuguese Red Cross, through a gentleman who was in charge at the time, a representative of\nthe Red Cross in Spain. His name, I think was Sakura, who took good care of us when we arrived\nin Spain and was responsible for taking us from Spain to Morocco, because the agreement with\nthe Spanish government was that only a certain amount of Jews will be allowed to stay in Spain,\nand in order to accept new Jews, they had to leave. And the funny part of it is that out of Spain\nwe were Spanish citizens. In Spain itself, we were [indecipherable]. We didn\u2019t s -- have a -- have\na citizenship. We were not recognized as Spanish.",
        "A: No impressions at all. Confused.",
        "A: When we arrived to Celle, the city of Celle, Bergen-Belsen\u2019s full name is Bergen-Belsen by\nCelle-Hannover. When we arrived in Celle, they took us out of the wagons and they marched us\nfor about two or three kilometers to the concentration camp. We did not know where we were\ngoing, we did not know the name of the place. All we saw is barbed wire, barracks and towers\nwith people with machine guns, and do -- and fiercely dogs. When we got there, we was\nseparated from the families. The women went to different barracks, the men went to different\nbarracks and that\u2019s it, period.",
        "A: No -- with my father, yes, but not in the same barrack.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes, I would.",
        "A: No, we lived in 1943 -- 1944 actually.",
        "A: No, we were not at the crematory. The camp commander was here. I\u2019m trying my best, maybe\nI\u2019m wrong.",
        "A: No -- oh, no, no, no, no, no, now I remember. When I see the latrines, I remember where we\nwere. The latrines were here, our barracks were here. Yeah. I remember the cellar, where they\nused to bring the vegetables that were feeding us. I remember the latrines, yes, yes. Our barracks\nwere here.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, that I can\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Neutrals camp?",
        "A: Probably, because there, as I told you were the ger -- the Argentineans also. So maybe that\nwas called neutral camp, but nobody ever told us.",
        "A: People that we came together, the 300 from Salonika. About 50 people from Argentina, or\nArgentineans, but actually from Poland, who unfortunately they must have gotten that citizenship\nthrough paying money or whatever, they -- and very few of them survived. They were not\nrecognized as Argentineans by the Germans, whereas we, from Salonika, were s -- survived from\nthe first to the last one. There was no doubt about our citizenship.",
        "A: We were not treated, period.",
        "A: They used -- they used to bring food once a day through the other Jews that was prisoners 1n\nthe camp. The food, I don\u2019t want to mention it. We had to eat it one way or the other. One day a\nweek, usually every Friday, we used to go to the showers to be cleaned and to have our -- our cl-\nclothing been disinfected. We went to the showers, we took our clothing, men and women\ntogether in the same place, naked. We had about five minutes of shower, and 75 minutes naked\nwaiting for our -- our -- our clothing to come back from the -- I don\u2019t know how they used to\ncall, the place where they disinfected them, and then take him back to the camp.",
        "A: What I remember, twice a day we used to have what they call the appel, or the appelle. That\u2019s\nfive o\u2019clock in the morning and the evening, where the German commandant would come with\nhis shi -- with his ga -- dog, and ask from the [indecipherable] -- from the [indecipherable] out of\nthe camp, how many died tonight, how many died today? Count them, make sure that nobody\nwas missing and taken back to the barracks.",
        "A: People were dying, but not in our section, because 1n our section we didn\u2019t have to work.\nPeople that had to work, with the -- with the food they were given, couldn\u2019t rest too much.",
        "A: Abso -- absolutely not, I think, staying in the barracks, period. And I was lucky enough to\nhave a book with me, and I read this book maybe 10 times. 10 or 20 times.",
        "A: Oh yeah, it was a Bible. The Bible in Greek. I\u2019m an expert on the Bible now, you can ask me\nanything you want, and I\u2019Il give it to you. I memorize it.",
        "A: Not in praying, it helped me very much in making sure I don\u2019t go crazy. It helping -- it helped\nme in spending my time sane instead of, you know, depressed and -- and whatever you call it.\nYes, it helped me a lot.",
        "A: Not that I remember. Not that I remember.",
        "A: That was the only thing I happened to have with me by -- by coincidence or mistake. How\nvery surprised [indecipherable] today, that they didn\u2019t take it away from me.",
        "A: Everybody prayed without hope.",
        "A: That we knew because we saw the other prisoners going to work every morning and coming\nback every evening. And we knew that we were not working. And that\u2019s help us a lot, except that\nwe were living with the fear that we\u2019ll never get out of it, because from the amount of food that\nthey give us, we couldn\u2019t last forever.",
        "A: What we did where?",
        "A: Stuffed cabbage. Every week, half a potato. Five grams of bread, and a little bit of butter and\nmilk that we did not eat ourselves or drink ourselves, they gave it to the young children that\u2019s\nhappened to be with us, because among the 300 of us, there were infants. And we tried to\npreserve them as much as we could.",
        "A: Oh, we saw each other every day. We did not live together the same barrack, whether we saw\neach other every day.",
        "A: They\u2019re close by and also my father in a way, was privileged at the camp because my father\nwas a German schoolteacher in his -- when he was young, World War I, and the German help\nhim a lot. This is part of [indecipherable] like to say about the Jews of Greece. As long as you\nwant to know what happened to them, it\u2019s a disaster. The Jews from Greece were deported to\nPoland exactly when the crematoria were established in 1943. Before that the Germans used to\nexecute the Jews. They didn\u2019t have the crematoria ready yet. When they arrived in ger -- in\nAuschwitz, they had three things against them. Number one, that the Germans wanted to feed\nand drive the crematorium. Number two, that because there was Ladino, they didn\u2019t know it --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: So the third part of it was that -- not being able to communicate. The people that were on top\nof them took the bread away to serve the -- to forced labors. Was slow -- steady but steadily they\nwere exterminated. That\u2019s why part of them, they became Sonderkommando, because the\nmoment they arrived there, the Germans were looking for people to use in the crematory. Of the\npopulation of Europe, or Jewish population of Europe that perished during the Holocaust, the\npercentage of Greek Jews that perished is the most elevated, the maximum one. I think about 86\npercent of the Jews from Greece perished in the Holocaust.",
        "A: Not at all. I didn\u2019t know one word of German.",
        "A: Yeah, my father used to communicate with them, not that it help him, but --",
        "A: Absolutely no contacts at all.",
        "A: [indecipherable] I remember the commander with his dog. I don\u2019t remember the name.\nHauptman Spherer or something like that.",
        "A: I used to speak most of the time Greek. Ah -- my language was Greek. Forget that we were\nSpanish citizens, we were Greeks after all. We were born in Greece, and we deported from\nGreek. We knew Ladino among our families, but outside our homes we used to speak Greek.",
        "A: Here at home? Five languages at the same time. Ladino, Spanish, Hebrew, Greek, French, and\nwho knows what else?",
        "A: Hebrew -- and Hebrew. English I\u2019m not gonna mention. [off camera remarks]. We\u2019ve been\nhere more than 50 years.",
        "A: Pm not going to answer to that. I know about the crematory in Bergen-Belsen, but most of the\npeople -- the crematoria there were -- were Russian citizen -- occu -- pri -- prisoners of war.\nThey executed an awful lot of Russians there.",
        "A: Yes. Our barrack was only Greeks. Spanish Greeks. The whole barrack of ours was isolated.\nWe never -- we did not get in touch with the other Greeks in Bergen-Belsen and we did not go to\nwork. The only way we had a contact with them is when they used to come and bring us the food\nin the morning and we were forbidden to talk to each. The Germans didn\u2019t want them to know\nwhat was happening in the other camps, because maybe they knew that sooner or later they had\nto send them to Greece, to send us to Spain.",
        "A: We heard from other places what was happening through the Argentineans that came from\nPoland, and we never believed it.",
        "A: Except for colds, very good.",
        "A: Same thing, same thing. Same thing.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I gave you the answer before. We were positive we\u2019ll never get alive from the camp, so we\nnever gave it any other thought, what\u2019s going to be our future.",
        "A: Well, one day a Spanish consul came to Bergen-Belsen, and told us that they made\narrangements to take us back to Spain. He gave us our passports and he said because\ntransportation was very limited, he was going to be in two -- two convoys. So I happened to be\non the second one. First about 150 people went ahead of us to Spain, and then the remaining of\nus went to Spain about two weeks later.",
        "A: That was 1944 already. I don\u2019t remember exactly the month.",
        "A: About eight to nine months.",
        "A: Yes, we were told from the Spanish government, that they had no choice. The Germans\nwanted us to be isolated for a certain amount of time so we couldn\u2019t communicate with the allies\nand tell them what was happening in Salonika [indecipherable] fortifications and other strategic\nthings. We didn\u2019t swallow it, but that\u2019s the answer we were given.",
        "A: In other words, we were told after the fact, that we were not in a concentration camp, we were\nin a transient camp.",
        "A: Of course not. Of course not. Who knew what was happening in the outside? We were\ncompletely isolated.",
        "A: Yes. We were always worried about what was going to happen to us. We knew about\nAuschwitz, and you knew out -- about the crematories in Bergen-Belsen. So what was there to\nthink about?",
        "A: Not til after we transferred from there and we were in Spain. We couldn\u2019t believe it and we\ndidn\u2019t believe it til we actually passed Port Bo into the Pyrenees and arrived in Barcelona.",
        "A: Very long. I think it took about two and a half weeks. And then we waited for about two days\nat the Pyrenees in the frontier because two our people had died, and the Germans wanted to make\nsure that we sign affidavits that they didn't kill them, that they were natural deaths.",
        "A: The Germans. Everything was done by the Germans. We -- we sp -- went through the whole\nof France, from Hannover all the way down to Port Bo in the Pyrenees with Germans. And we\nsigned affidavits before we entered Spain to the Germans.",
        "A: I think the -- the man in charge is the one who signed, who, being a Jew -- his name was\nIzrhazi -- being a Jew was also before the war, and during the war, the consul of Spain in\nSalonika. He was traveling with us and he is the one who certified that they were not killed.",
        "A: Yes. We were of it. We were very aware of it and that\u2019s why we hate him much today. I\u2019m\npositive he was a collaborator, that\u2019s why he survived. His family survived, all of them. He is the\nonly one who died. And he died from typhoid and maybe from old age.",
        "A: Yes. We were with our parents, we were well fed. We had no complaints, except what as I\ntold you before, to the last minute, we didn\u2019t know where we were going. The fear was there.",
        "A: When we entered Spain, we were under the auspices of joice distri -- Joint Distribution\nCommittee, under the [indecipherable] or whatever it 1s, of Samuel Sakura, who happened to be\nalso the representative of the Portuguese Red Cross in Spain. We were distributed into hotels.\nWe were taken bi -- care of it. We were, all of us examined to find out if health-wise we were bis\n-- perfect, that nothing was wrong with us, and we were given as a matter of fact, pocket money,\nso we won\u2019t suffer. We stayed in Barcelona about six months, and if it wasn\u2019t for Barcelona we\nwouldn\u2019t be alive today. We were treated royalty. No complaints at all. Now, the reason that we\nleft Barcelona is because, as we found out later on, there was an agreement that General Franco\nwill not accept too many Jews in Spain, there had to be a certain amount. So they organized a\nconvoy, they took us from Barcelona through Spain to Cadiz, and from Cadiz with a convoy, we\nwere took into Casablanca, that other time we was liberated from the Germans, and the\nAmericans were occupying Morocco.",
        "A: What do you mean, who\u2019s they?",
        "A: Joint Distribution Committee, the f -- Samuel Sakura. Everything was happen in Spain,\nhappened through the Portuguese Red Cross, as far as I know.",
        "A: The Germans were not there any more.",
        "A: The Joint was financing the whole thing, yes.",
        "A: We were 300.",
        "A: The same group. Always the same group. We\u2019re 300 there, we\u2019re 300 in Morocco.",
        "A: In Morocco we was taken to a beach outside Casablanca called Fidella, where there was a\nrefugee camp of the United Nations. We stayed in this camp, in the tents, I believe for about\nseven or eight months, and then from this camp, we were taken with a convoy through Argeus,\nfrom Argeus to Italy, from Italy to Gaza in order to be repatriated to Greece. By that time it was\nalready 1945.",
        "A: No, the only thing I remember is that when we got to the concen -- to the refugee camp in\nGaza, the name of the camp was Lucerite, Greece was not liberated yet. The Greek army in exile\nwith a -- with the King George was still in Palestine, they were not in Greece yet. The exact\nmonth, I cannot remember.",
        "A: Were sent there in order to be repatriated to Greece, yes. We went to a Greek refugee camp,\nbut was under the -- not the command -- under the auspices of the United Nations. The camp was\ncalled Lucerite, and the name of the camp -- the name of the people that were running the camp\nfor the United Nations was URRA, United Nations Rehabilitation and Refugee Administration.\nOne thing I have to say that being that I knew English, I was [indecipherable] and hired by the\nUnited Nations to help the administration [indecipherable] living constantly in the camp.",
        "A: Oh, we were there at least six months, I don\u2019t remember exactly how long.",
        "A: I try to forget that. There were some people that we did not associate with them, who were\nliberated from Spain and came with us to the camp that were part of the Lincoln brigade that\nfought Franco during the chi -- during the Spanish Civil War, and they were imprisoned from\n1936 til ninet -- til 1936 yes, til 1943 or \u201945, that they were sent with us to the camp.",
        "A: Yes, there was a large group, and I\u2019m not going to say a word about them. They were good\npeople, good people.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Maybe there was a group before us, I don\u2019t know. But the maximum were there, we must\nhave been about a thousand people, no more, no less. I doubt it very much.",
        "A: We were liberated, we were hopeful, we were told we are going back to Greece. What will be\nmy state of mind? We were very happy.",
        "A: No. I\u2019m talking 1944. There where wa -- the war was not over yet. We left Casablanca -- we\nleave Morocco in 1945, where at that time the -- the [indecipherable] has taken -- had taken place\nand the Germans were no place to be seen.",
        "A: No, we left the camp -- no -- May, June of \u201945, something, I don\u2019t -- it was before the end of\nthe war, that\u2019s -- I\u2019m sure it was it.",
        "A: The next journey was by train all the way from Morocco to Algiers. In Algiers we stayed for a\nfew days, and with the convoy we were -- that\u2019s why I said the war was not over yet, and with\nthe convoy would take you to Taranto in Italy at the military camp of the British.",
        "A: Taranto.",
        "A: Taranto, not Torinto -- Torino. It\u2019s the end of the -- of the boot. It\u2019s -- one side it\u2019s Taranto\nand the other side I think is Bari, something. Taranto, where we were. In Taranto we stayed a\nfew weeks, and when they had a convoy for the Middle East, we were part of this convoy. I\nremember it was a convoy of Australia -- Australian soldiers who went to Port-Siad. From Port-\nSiad we are taken with trucks to can -- el Cantara. From el Cantara we cross the Suez Canal, and\nwe were taken to Gaza.",
        "A: Yes. We knew we were going to Gaza, bepo -- because we thought we\u2019ll be repatriated to\nGreece. We knew we were going to a refugee camp of the United Nations, to be assembled and\nsent back to Greece as soon as Greece was liberated.",
        "A: The camp in [indecipherable] was a large camp. Quite a few thousand of people. Quite a few\nGreeks had escaped from Greece, and I do think there were quite a few from Cyprus and Libya,\nbut I\u2019m not sure about it.",
        "A: No. No, no, no, no, no. We were the only Jewish refugees there.",
        "A: Not as a translator, I was working -- working at the b -- at the administration of the camp, and\noccasionally because they were all Greeks, I used to translate for them, but my main function\nwas in the office. Actually, it was bookkeeping to a certain extent.",
        "A: The camp was dismantled at the end of 1945, I think 1t was November, where Greece was\ncomplete liberated. And they started sending refugees back to Greece. I did not leave the camp. I\nstayed there for only one reason. At the time there was a civil war going 1n Greece, the\nCommunists and the Royalists, and I did not go -- or want to go and get involved in a civil war.\nSo when my tame -- time came to be repatriated to Greece, I decided to stay in Palestine.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I was in the camp.",
        "A: I was in Gaza.",
        "A: There were no big moments for us, we suffered so much, we didn\u2019t have the strength for\nnothing. We were -- we were not there to celebrate. We were thinking of constantly, what\nhappened to our people? Who is alive, who is gonna come back? How could you celebrate? How\ncould you think differently? For God\u2019s sake.",
        "A: No, our thoughts were always with the Jews that we knew went to Bergen-Belsen and we\nwere always thinking, who is going to come back. That was our only thought. There were no\nfuture for us.",
        "A: Nothing except I stayed in Palestine. I didn\u2019t go back to Greece.",
        "A: Once I was as a tourist in 1972. But I never went back to Greece to stay there.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t go looking for anything in Greece. In 1972 it was too late to find something. There\nwas nobody left, there was nothing left.",
        "A: What\u2019s there the time in Palestine? I left the camp when the camp moved from Gaza to a\ndifferent place. They used to call them [indecipherable] the twe. [indecipherable] Mo-Moisis\nriver, in the Suez Canal. We were given the choice to go to Palestine or to go with them, with the\ncamp, with the United Nations. I decided to stay in Palestine, I didn\u2019t want any more part of\nrefugee\u2019s camp, and I parted from the United Nations, went to Tel Aviv and with my parents\nstarted to make a living and find a job.",
        "A: What did I do?",
        "A: I was a worker on a company that used to make perambulators, they used to call them in\nEnglish, babies carriages. I used to work there.",
        "A: Til I was drafted into the Israeli army.",
        "A: That was in 1947, the end of \u201947, when the United Nations established the petition of\nPalestine and the State of Israel.",
        "A: I was in the army before [indecipherable] in Israel. I was helping other organizations save\npeople from Europe. I smuggle refugees into the land because be -- the British would not allow --\ndid not allow any more Jews to come into Palestine. I helped as much as I could. When the\npetition was made, like everybody else, I was draft in the ar -- drafted in the army, and I was in\nthe army from the beginning of 1948 til July 1949, a year and a half. In 1949, when we -- truce\nwas proclaimed and the legitimate state -- government of Israel was established, when the\nelections took place, I was released from the army. I was married in the army, because my wife\nhappened to be also a soldier. And in 1949 I left Israel and went back to cu -- went to Cuba to a\ncousin of mine, hoping that from there I would be able to join my parents in the United States,\nbecause my parents were given a visa for the United States, where I did not get one myself.",
        "A: Yes. There was a quota for it in every country in Europe. My father was born in Yugoslavia,\nthe quota was free. The Greek quota was filled for the next 30 years. I was born in Greece, so I\ndidn\u2019t qualify for a visa.",
        "A: Spanish. But the quota for the United States was not based on citizenship, it was based on the\ncountry where you were born. It\u2019s a funny thing, at the time there were about 30,000 Greeks\nasking for a visa, and the quota for the -- for Greece was 308 a year. In other words, there was a\nquota for about a hundred years.",
        "A: They left the beginning of 1946, and they came here in th-the beginning of 1946, after the\nwar.",
        "A: No, I rented a place, and I was living on my own.",
        "A: We met in the army, we were both soldiers. We happened to g -- were both from Greece, and\nwe worked together from the end of 1947 til 19 -- til 1949 where a law came that every woman\nthat was married would get a discharge from the army. So in April of 1949, we were married and\nshe was able to start her civil life, where I continued to the army --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: [indecipherable] a few weeks, maybe two weeks tops. There\u2019s nothing to say. We used to\nhave the same rations as the Spanish -- as the British soldiers, very good treat. We were was --\nwere taken care. We had medical facilities and we were waiting, we were told, to go back to\nGreece. So our stay there d-doesn\u2019t leave an -- an impression on me, it was a very short one.",
        "A: Well, there were -- there were tents, like the soldiers. We\u2019re there in tents.",
        "A: In the British army camp, yes. All the time in Torino was the British army camps.",
        "A: Torino.",
        "A: Today with a convoy were taken by ship to Egypt, to ca -- to Port-Siad. And we -- Port-Siad\nby trucks. We crossed the Suez, we went to el Cantara, and by railroad from el Cantara to Gaza.\nWe went the whole -- the whole Sinai peninsula to Gaza.",
        "A: Her name is Flora. Her Hebrew name is Shoshanna.",
        "A: Cohen. C-o-h-e-n.",
        "A: She also was born, I think in Greece or Yugoslavia. Now -- now it\u2019s -- now it\u2019s Macedonia.\nShe was born in Macedonia, and lived all her life in Salonika.",
        "A: Very simple. As I explained to you, my quota to come to United States will take about a\nhundred years. We had a good cousin in Cuba who lived there -- went there after the first World\nWar. And we had a cousin there who was able to obtain for us a residency in Cuba. So we left\nPalestine in November of 1949. We spent one month with a cousin of ours 1n barce -- in geno --\nGenoa in Italy. And from Genoa we went to Columbia and by plane from Columbia -- from\nBarankia, we went to Cuba.",
        "A: We were in Cuba 1950 to 1953, three and a half years.",
        "A: Was a paradise. I\u2019m talking to you before Castro. We had a good business, we used to do\nbusiness. We used to import textiles from the United States and sell them in Cuba. We had no\ncomplaints, we made very good friends. We had our family, our cousins and uncles there.\nUnfortunately, in 1952 there was go -- they were going to have elections in Cuba, and the next\ndictator decided that he wanted to be the president. His name was Fulgencio Batista. He made\nthe coup in March of 1952, took over the government, insta -- installed a dictatorship. From the\nexperience we had with dictators, our only way -- the only thing left for us was to leave Cuba.",
        "A: Are you kidding, no, nobody ever asked us if we were Jewish or where we | -- where we were\nliving, where we came from. Absolutely nothing. I can tell you off the record, you can take it --\nno, you can take it off later on, that the situation was so good in Cuba that the man who wanted\nto be [indecipherable] senator offered us money -- we were there only six months -- offered us\nmoney to give us -- no, no -- yeah, to give us a Cuban citizenship so we can vote for him.",
        "A: No, no. We were not crazy.",
        "A: What happened next is that we were lucky, for once in our life. Presidents Tru-Truman passed\na law in Congress admitting 50,000 deported people from the war to the United States on top of\nthe [indecipherable] the -- the quota. Being as I was one of the deportees, I qualified, and in May\nof 1953, I came to the United States.",
        "A: And that\u2019s my life, that\u2019s was to New York where my father and mother were living. They\nwere still alive.",
        "A: Insurance. I was selling insurance because I knew Spanish. I was selling insurance to the\nPuerto geetans -- portag -- port -- to the Puerto Ricans, to the Dominicans, but I didn\u2019t stay too\nlong because a friend of my father had a furniture store and he needed somebody to speak spa --\nSpanish so he ca-can attract the Spanish clientele. So I went to work for him as a -- as a -- not\nbookkeeper, how you call that? The people they give mortgages, and things like that there.",
        "A: No, no, no, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- the people they approve the pr -- they approve the mortgages, how\nyou call them?",
        "A: Anyway, we went there to took over the store and I work for him til -- til -- was 1950 -- 54\nand -- til 1955. In 1955 he sold the store and the company that financed -- oh, financed, financed\n-- the company that financed the store saw the quality of approval I was given, asked me to work\nfor them. So I went to work for them, and I stayed with them til 1956 - \u201957, something like that.\nThen I decided that I wanted something better than that. I went to another furniture company for\nabout six months that decided to -- the man in charge decided to make his own company, so I\nwent with him, always in the same kind of business, as a finance manager, and I stayed with\nthem til -- and I\u2019m confused.",
        "A: 1950 something -- no, no, ti -- 1964 -- ti -- 1964, when we built Town Craft, the company that\nwas -- that was the partners. Yeah, we establish a company that used to sell furniture and all\nkinds of equipment on -- on monthly installments. So, with a little bit of a capital that I had at the\ntime, I became again, the finance manager of the new company, being also a partner. I stayed\nwith this company from 1965 to 1976. In 1976 through a friend of mine who used to work on gr\n-- eyeglasses frames, representing a Fr-French factory in the United States, I was given the\nopportunity to go with him, and to represent this French company from 1976 til 1991, where at\nthe age of 70, I decided to retire.",
        "A: I hope it di -- I hope it didn\u2019t confuse you because I\u2019m so emotional now, maybe --",
        "A: -- s-something as far as the dates only is concerned, might be confusing.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Oh, my parents came in 1946 to the States. My father died in November of 1959 and my\nmother died in October 1968.",
        "A: I have two children. One is a dentist, he 1s 53 years old, and one is an architect, he just turned\n50.",
        "A: The first name is from the Hebrew Menachem, his name is Meny. And the second name -- the\nsecond one is the Hebrew name for her father, who was Moshe, and his name is Murray. Meny is\nthe dentist, married to a wonderful girl, has two children, lives in Jersey. One of a gr -- my\ngrandchildren 1s in third year in Union College, and the other one 1s just finishing high school.\nThey live in West Caldwell. They are very, very active in orga -- Jewish organizations. They\u2019re\nvery, very active in their synagogue. That\u2019s why their -- my daughter-in-law asked my wife if\nshe wanted to be the guest speaker for the Shoah this year. Now, my second son is not married.\nHe lives very happily in Manhattan, but we are not happy that he 1s all alone in his life.",
        "A: Yeah, we went -- we came here 1953. At that time survivors from the Holocaust were also\ncoming from Greece on the base of this law that I told you, 50,000 the pre -- the displaced\npeople. Most of them did not speak English, did not know any professions. They quin -- they\ncame here with the HIAS. Some of them were sent to Flint, Michigan, others were sent here. So\nthere was an organization that in a way was trying to help them, with the language, with the daily\nlife, with the profession, with health, that was called [indecipherable] brotherhood of America.\nMy father was a member of this organization and we became members immediately. We became\nactive. While the old people that build the organization in 1917, after the first war passed away,\nslowly but steadily, we took care of it. And in the elections in the 80\u2019s, I was elected president. I\nserved two terms, because elections were two years, I served fer -- four years as president, and is\nstill today very active in this organization. I\u2019m a member of the central board of [indecipherable]\nand I participate in everything that I can help them.",
        "A: First we -- I helped quite a few of them that decided to relocate from Greece to -- to United\nStates. Most of them did not stay here, they went to San Francisco. I helped them as much as I\ncould because at that time I needed help myself. And I participate in every fundraising from\nIsrael. I have certificates of Israeli bonds for what I did for the bonds. I sh -- was member of\nB\u2019nai Zion. I was -- I was helping, and I still help UJA, and as much as I can I try to keep our\nSephardic tradition because unfortunately we are not as many as Ashkenazi. Our language, our\nLadino is disappearing, it\u2019s not like the Yiddish. And I have a feeling that after our generation\nthere\u2019ll be nothing left of the Jewish tradition.",
        "A: My children do not speak Ladino, I\u2019m sorry to say that. They do not speak Spain -- French.\nThey speak -- they speak Spanish, they learned Hebrew. They\u2019re involved with their crowd, and\neverything that\u2019s Jewish, thank God for it. They are more or less observant. They participate in\ntheir synagogue, and that\u2019s the best I can hope.",
        "A: Ah, I'll be honest with you, no. I\u2019ve kept my fa -- my faith because it was part of my life from\nthe day I was born, but did not help me in any way, on the contrary, in quite a few instances, I\nsuffered because I was Jewish. And I don\u2019t mean just the Holocaust, I mean here in the United\nStates.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, the faith I had in God, I still have. I don\u2019t think it was too much, I hope it was more, but\nas far as I am concerned, He helps me, He exists, and [indecipherable] all the commandments I\ntried to follow, the si -- the rich words of our religion.",
        "A: Yes, we have a Sephardic temple in Forest Hills, where I belong, and where I a member of the\nboard.",
        "A: And by the way, on this Sephardic temple, I was in the executive for at least seven years. I\u2019ve\nbeen on the Board of Directors of the temple from 1972 til today.",
        "A: Sephardic Jewish Brotherhood of Forest Hills. No, I\u2019m sorry, Sephardic Jewish Center of\nForest -- \u2019'm confusing with the brotherhood.",
        "A: Always. Always. As much as I tried to spare them the tales, they know the whole thing.",
        "A: Oh yes. I\u2019m always willing to share my experiences. I was willing to make sure that the\nHolocaust doesn\u2019t disappear after I disappear.",
        "A: No, I always tried not to talk about it with strangers, not with my family. Many people\ncomplain, why didn\u2019t you say what\u2019s happened to you? I don\u2019t want any part of it. I try not -- I\ncannot forget, but I\u2019m trying not to remember. I [indecipherable] all right to give other people the\nsuffering, to a certain extent, of what I went. It doesn\u2019t help. The only thing I try to do is m -- to\nmake sure that they know -- they know the Holocaust existed, and to perpetuate the memory of\nthe Holocaust.",
        "A: Darling, that\u2019s why I decided to give you the interview.",
        "A: It\u2019s done.",
        "A: Yes, I do. From conference number two.",
        "A: During Greek wa -- during the German occupation, I couldn\u2019t use the name Haim, so I\nbecame Nick. When the whole thing finished, and all my family disappeared, the few friends that\nwere left, they were Orthodox, and they called me Nick. So when the time came to become a\nUSS. citizen, I deti -- decided that it was foolish for my friends to call me Nick and my name to\nbe Haim. So I changed officially my name, the day -- the day I became a citizen, to Nick. And all\nmy documents in the United States, from the Social Security, from my work, from my taxes,\nfrom everything are under the name of Nick.",
        "A: By the way, something more that is trivia, but maybe this will help explain why I use the\nname Nick. In the old country they used to give the name Nick -- used to give the name Haim to\nbabies so they survive. I had a brother who died at the age of four. So, his name was David. My\nparents decided to put me the name Haim. When the emancipation came, the Jews of Salonika,\nwho were very much involved in French culture, decided that Haim is not such a good Jewish\nname. Instead of giving the name Haim, let\u2019s give the guy a name of survivor. And the name\nthey choose for all the Haims was Victor. Most of the Victors are Haim.",
        "A: So Victor become Nicky -- became Nick.",
        "A: This you can keep off the record, I mean, I don\u2019t want --",
        "A: Be chose -- no, no, no, no. I chose Nick [indecipherable]. I chose Victor, and from Victor,\nNick.",
        "A: Ni -- Nick -- Nicholas. Nicholas in Greek means the winner of the pa -- of the people. Nicos\nLaus. Laus means people.",
        "A: No, he was younger than me, and he died before I was born.",
        "A: He died four years old, before I was born.",
        "A: No. I know it was a sickness, I don\u2019t know if it -- 1t was an epidemic or what. My parents\nnever spoke about it.",
        "A: No, not -- I haven\u2019t got, unless you need something else. I\u2019m always available.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome. You\u2019re always welcome, do you feel like coming again, and we\u2019re here.",
        "A: We\u2019re here, we feel that what we did today is to our own benefit.\n"
