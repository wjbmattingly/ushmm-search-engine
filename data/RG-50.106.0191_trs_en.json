        "Q: Where were you born and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Stuttgart, Germany on September 20, 1924.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about your family. Your parents\u2019 names.",
        "A: My father was named Arnold Arnstein. My mother Elizabeth maiden name Weil, W-E-I-L\nand they married in 1922, 23. I have the exact date written down of course. In Stuttgart. Both\nfrom solid, middle class comfortable middle class families.",
        "Q: How far back does your family go in generations in Stuttgart?",
        "A: In Stuttgart only as far as my grandparents. But in that corner of southwest Germany I have\ndocumented it because I do family history, back to 1660, 1670.",
        "Q: What kind of work did your father do?",
        "A: He was leather wholesaler jobber. The name of the business was Weil and Arnstein and it\nwas established by my grandfather. I have finally found out who Mr. Weil was but I have\nnegligible data on him. He died quite early and then my father took over the business.",
        "Q: Did you or do you have any siblings?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: I have one sister who died two years ago in California. She had both Alzheimer\u2019s and\nParkinson\u2019s and guriet [ph]",
        "Q: Was she older or younger than --",
        "A: Three years younger.",
        "Q: And her name?",
        "A: Her birth name was Suzanna Carola Arnstein. About, when she first came to this country in\njunior high school, she changed it to Carol because she didn\u2019t want to be called Suzy.",
        "Q: You said before that you came from a middle class family. Did you live right in the center of\nStuttgart?",
        "A: In the heart of the city, not downtown but in, my father bought a four story building before he\ngot married and we lived on the second floor and there were tenants on the other three floors.",
        "Q: Did your mother work?",
        "A: No, she did not. That\u2019s not quite true. She went to an arts and crafts school and when she was\nsingle she worked in a porcelain painting factory. Factory is an exaggeration. And after she got\nmarried, I owned two pieces with her initials LA Lisa Arnstein. And I owned one piece signed\nLW, Lisa Weil. That she did work but not after she was married.",
        "Q: Did your mother have any help in the house?",
        "A: Yes.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "Q: Any housekeeper?",
        "A: Yes, we had a full time live in maid until the Nuremberg laws of 1935 and then we had part\ntime help.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll get to 1935. Let\u2019s talk a little bit about you. What language did you speak at home?\nDid you speak German at home?",
        "A: German and I even spoke the local dialect when I played soccer with the kids or the boys but\nat the dinner table we were expected to speak reasonably correct German. My parents cautiously\nspoke French when they didn\u2019t want the children to understand whatever it is they were talking\nabout. Later they switched to English. My father spoke both languages better than my mother,\nnot terribly well but better.",
        "Q: How would you describe yourself? Were you an independent child when you were young or\nwere you more dependent on your parents?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how to answer that. Yes, I liked to think I was independent but on the other hand\nup to the age of 13 or 14 you are necessarily dependent and in our home, my father made the\ndecisions. That does not mean he disregarded my mother, but he clearly was in charge. He is the\none who decided that I would attend a secondary school known as a gymnasium where one of\nthe foreign languages was Latin. And as he said, in my day we had to take Latin and Greek.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about your education. You first started at what kind of a school?",
        "A: Within walking distance there was an elementary school with two wings. One wing, the larger\nwas Protestant. The other wing, smaller, was Catholic. I attended the Protestant wing. I could\nhave been excused from religious instruction which was part of the curriculum. I was not and I\nattended and to this day I remember some Protestant catechism.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nIt was within walking distance. It was a public school, strangely enough, co-educational. There\nwere 20 boys and ten girls. And I have a photograph taken in third grade or second grade. And I\nused to say I can still recall the names. Not true.",
        "Q: Speaking of being in the Protestant section, was your family religiously Jewish?",
        "A: Ethnically Jewish, religiously no.",
        "Q: How would you describe them. Were they very assimilated?",
        "A: My father had a slightly younger brother named Ernest, which is why I\u2019m named George\nErnest who apparently was quite enterprising. He broke his neck skiing in the Italian Alps at age\n17, 18, something like that which meant that my grandfather had to decide on a burial plot to\nbury Uncle Ernest whom I never knew of course. And he picked a plot in the Protestant section\nof the cemetery. Not the Jewish section. I cite that as an example.\nAnd that, of course, it\u2019s then where my grandfather was buried in the family plot. So was my\nmaternal grandfather. That it\u2019s an indirect answer to your question.",
        "Q: Did your parents do anything Jewishly in the home when you were very young?",
        "A: Absolutely not. I did not know where the synagogue was. There were three words which I\nassumed to be German and in fact they mostly are. One was schlemiel, and the other one was\nplite [ph] which means bankrupt but it 1s so part of the German language. Anyway I did not\nknow those were Jewish words. Oy, well there was once in the edition, there was instant Yiddish.",
        "Q: Did you know you were Jewish when you were little?",
        "A: No, not until the Nazis came to power.",
        "Q: For nine years.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: Well, yes. It didn\u2019t matter.",
        "Q: Did you go to any family occasions like a Seder or anything like that?",
        "A: No but I do remember after the Nazis came to power, about 1935 my sister and I went to\nGelingen [ph] which 1s a village not far from Stuttgart where there was a Jewish training center,\npresumably preparing people for Palestine. And all I remember from that 1s that I did not like the\ntaste of horseradish and that is all I remember.",
        "Q: So you went to this public school and you were in the Protestant wing or section. What were\nyour other interests? Did you like to read at all?",
        "A: Oh we played soccer, we went bicycling. I was one of the boys and \u2014",
        "Q: Did you like to read books?",
        "A: Oh I remember the first two books I owned. One was in German of course, Classical\nmythology. In a version which 1s kind of poetic. It 1s so good that it has, that version has been\ntranslated into English and published in the United States. By an author named Schwab, S-C-H-\nW-A-B. Ihave fond memories of that. And the other book was in German, Ein Come from\nRome [ph] , a battle for Rome. It deals basically with the invasion of the Goths, the, and of\ncourse, I identified with the Goths, the victorious Goths. I still remember those two books were\na present from a cousin from Nuremberg.",
        "Q: When you were young, did you have any Jewish, any friends that whom you knew were\nJewish. You didn\u2019t know you were but did you know \u2014",
        "A: It was not a question that arose. So they may have been but I didn\u2019t know. That changed of\ncourse after the noose tightened. But no, there was a cousin named Uncle Emil who owned the\nfactory and he arrived with a black chauffeur driven limousine but it was an Opel. It wasn\u2019t even\na Mercedes. I mean it, he was, he existed but didn\u2019t particularly think about it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "Q: Let\u2019s get to 1933. You were an old man of eight and a half, nine years old when Hitler comes\ninto power. What are your first memories of any change from your very happy assimilated\nchildhood?",
        "A: First of all nothing changed in, among the boys in my neighborhood. We continued to play\nsoccer and we continued, this was before bicycles. We had scooters but then gradually. Nothing\nhappened in any significant way until the Nuremberg laws which meant that we could no longer\nhave a full time housekeeper and that probably led to an explanation by my parents that we were\ndifferent.",
        "Q: Do you remember your reaction?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t.",
        "A: The other significant thing is there was a cousin in Munich. This must have been a couple of\nyears later. Her name was Marianne. She was engaged to a gentile Bavarian who was terrific.\nHe, they took me skiing. They owned a small Fiat. At the age of 12 on country roads, I was\nallowed to drive. So no wonder I think well of him. And they of course, she converted to\nCatholicism. She became a Catholic, a convert. It didn\u2019t do any good and moved to Stuttgart and\nbecame kind of an older sister to us, or she was appreciably older but she became part of our\nhousehold and most significantly she owned a car and we were mechanized for the first time. I\ncite this only as a reasonably vivid recollection of the influence of the Nuremberg laws and the\nrealization that we were different and Marianne was different.\nThe other significant difference is that swimming pools started to have signs saying no Jews\nallowed. And \u2014",
        "Q: Not only were you different. You knew you were Jewish.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: Yes. Exactly when and how that happened, I don\u2019t recall but I was different and the\ndifference was Jewish ethnicity.",
        "Q: Do you remember being frightened about hearing that, that you were different than your\nfriends?",
        "A: Not particularly. The, my fellow soccer players didn\u2019t treat me any differently. My fellow\nbicyclists who were the same thing, the same group.",
        "Q: What about the teachers in school?",
        "A: That is a precipitated cause. Easter 1938 I had not done my homework or I was late for class\nor some minor offense like that and the home room teacher took me to task and said George, or\nGeorg of course, you who are a guest in this country. And that, that scored. I remember it today.\nMy father had offered me earlier, had raised the question didn\u2019t I want to transfer and go to\nschool in Geneva, 1n Switzerland. Where there were family friends with a son my age who were\ngoing to look after me. Easter 38 I went home and I told my father I\u2019m ready to go to Geneva.\nAnd that was the precipitating trivial incident. There are a couple of others.\nWe played soccer as part of the gym class at school, secondary school. And typically you were \u2014",
        "Q: Secondary school you went to, did it \u2014",
        "A: Gymnasium.",
        "Q: Were you still in a Protestant section of the school or was everybody together?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall. Yes, it was Protestant. The Catholics may have been excused. I can only\nremember one other Jewish boy at that point and I still know his name. He was the son of a \u2014 and\nto my knowledge he\u2019s a, an emeritus professor at the University of Michigan or Michigan state.",
        "Q: What is his name?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: Ted Hecht, H-E-C-H-T. Theodore. And I haven\u2019t been in touch with him for years.",
        "Q: But he was the only other Jewish child \u2014",
        "A: And he left before me.",
        "Q: He left before you.",
        "A: I was literally the last one. What I was getting at 1s the soccer teams were chosen either by\nheight or in turn. And I was number 11 or number 12 1n size and when the teams were chosen, I\nwas also chosen, something like 11\" or 12\". That\u2019s significant. There are 11 soccer players to a\nside. But the point I\u2019m getting at is there were two guys who basically deliberately followed me.\nAnd the teacher, alias umpire, didn\u2019t see it. Again, trivial but you were asking for examples and\nthose are the only --",
        "Q: Did you really see it or \u2014",
        "A: Oh, no, no ignored it.",
        "Q: Ignored it.",
        "A: So chose not to see it.",
        "Q: Chose not to see it.",
        "A: Those are about the only incidents I can remember.",
        "Q: What about symbols in the streets or any of the soldiers, German soldiers. Do you remember\u2019?\nSymbols in the streets, did you see any swastikas or \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: Oh yes, of course. You know for example, my father being the owner of the building, was\nexpected to fly a flag prominently on patriotic occasions and he chose the local colors, provincial\ncolors which were red and black, the city colors were black and yellow. But not the swastika and\nnot black, white and red which were the alternate national colors. And we got away with it.",
        "Q: What was on his flag, your father\u2019s flag?",
        "A: On his flag? Black and red. The provincial colors.",
        "Q: The stripes, just.",
        "A: Two stripes, yes. No, no not remotely black white and red. Parenthetically my father had\nserved in World War I the full four years. He was promoted from approximately corporal and\nmade lieutenant. He was wounded twice. I don\u2019t know how badly. He had impaired, what 1s it\ncalled, taste buds but no other evidence of permanent damage. He had medals. He wore them\nonce and put them away in the drawer. I saw them once. In fact I still own them. But he was not\nterribly patriotic. And there are two explanations for that. His mother, my grandmother was born\nin San Francisco. So he had -- she came to Stuttgart at age 12 more or less. Her English was\nthere but not fluent. Nevertheless that made a difference. He, she was one of six sisters, three of\nthem married Germans. But one married a Frenchman, one married an Englishman. So my\nfather had first cousins in London. He had first, a first cousin in Paris which is how he spent a\nyear there learning English and learning French, which also probably explains why he was less\npatriotic than one would think of a German lieutenant.\nWhile we\u2019re on that theme let\u2019s finish it. After Kristallnacht the night of broken glass, I was in\nGeneva. I only read about it. He was arrested the following morning. He was sent to the local\npolice station, our part of town, told to empty his pockets and what came out among other things\nwas orders for reserve lieutenant Arnstein to report for either a physical exam or I don\u2019t\nremember those detail. It didn\u2019t do any good. He still wound up at Dachau. But as long as we\nwere on the military theme I thought I\u2019d include that. Kind of confusing. Enemy of the state and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "Q: Being asked to report. Let\u2019s talk again, your experience from 34, 35 on before you left. You\nsaw these symbols in the street. Did you see soldiers marching, uniforms.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: What did you as a young boy, you weren\u2019t that young, 12, 13, what was your reaction to that,\ndo you remember?",
        "A: I was one of the boys. I went along with it. I vaguely remember that Hitler came through town\nand there was a parade of \u2014 it was within walking distance of home and I think I stood in the\naudience and watched it. That doesn\u2019t mean I approved or even saluted with \u2014",
        "Q: What did Hitler mean to you as a young teen?",
        "A: Well. First of all you have to realize the newspapers and everything else were now\ncoordinated and spoke with a single voice of enthusiasm. I knew my father listened to radio\nStrasbourg which broadcast in French and in German. Deliberately. I also knew that this was\neither illegal but anyway one didn\u2019t talk about it. So in that sense I became politically aware.\nBut what did Hitler mean to me. Oh he was going to build the autobahn and good heavens that\nwas three years away. Didn\u2019t mean all that much.",
        "Q: So at that point he wasn\u2019t somebody who was fearsome to you?",
        "A: No, except well yes. Going back to the building and symbols. The socialists also had a\nsymbol, not the swastika of course but three parallel arrows and I remember three arrows were\npainted on our sidewalk. Which meant the following morning somebody had to scrub and\nremove them. There was an annual winter relief drive where they collected nowadays we\u2019d\ncollect canned goods, but in those days it was clothing and things like that. That used to be done\nby the army. It was now being done by brown shirted storm troopers. So there were changes and\nthere is that terrible word which I don\u2019t know how to translate and I don\u2019t think anybody else\ndoes either. Gleich Schaltung.[ph] which kind of means coordination, coordination,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\npenetration, where everything was made over and the example of the winter relief drive is an\nexample. It used to be the army and theoretically neutral and now it became storm troopers.\nGleich Schaltung spelled G-L-E-I-C-H one word. S-C-H-A-L-T-U-N-G. I do not know how to\ntranslate it. So these are \u2014",
        "Q: What I\u2019m trying to get at, you weren\u2019t especially fearful, frightened.",
        "A: No I was not particularly fearful, mostly because my playmates, my fellow bicyclists et\ncetera, one, he died only eight years ago and I\u2019d been in touch with him for 70 years. His name\nwas Herman. His father was a minor government official. He joined the junior version of the\nHitler Youth. He then join -- well I wasn\u2019t there when he joined the senior version and he\nbecame a lieutenant in the German army. And I looked him up at the end of the war when I was a\nGI. And he had just been discharged from an American POW cage. So we explored our old\nneighborhood together. (Laughs) He had been gone and I had been gone.",
        "Q: Did you want to be a member of the Hitler Youth?",
        "A: That is what I\u2019m getting at. He, I think offered to have me join his troop or something like\nthat. And of course I wasn\u2019t eligible, but sure, they had uniforms and they did all kinds of\nexciting things. The school year had changed from five and a half days of school Saturday\nmorning, to five days of school. No more school on Saturdays, but the Hitler Youth people above\nall organized by the school there were excursions, hikes and things like that. And of course the\nHitler Youth boys showed up in uniform and we did not. We didn\u2019t have a uniform.",
        "Q: We being, you and the other Jewish boy?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember but there were some non-members of the Hitler Youth who were also in my\nschool or in my class. So there were some of us were different, not necessarily Jewish. As I say,\nI was the only one in my class. Ted was, I think, a year behind me.\nI also remember one incident where Herman and I were going a block or two away, possibly on\nour scooters and ran into a couple of other boys who started making anti-Semitic remarks like oh\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nyou can smell a Jew a mile away and this and that. And Herman would knowing full well that I\nwas Jewish which I realize contradicts some of my earlier comments, kind of goaded them on\ninto saying oh we can smell one. We can see one. They\u2019re different and all that, knowing all the\ntime that this was obviously preposterous. That\u2019s as close as I could come to incidents.",
        "Q: But you were never physically approached in an anti-Semitic way?",
        "A: Except for the following of, during the soccer game and oh there was one other guy in my\nclass, big not very bright, who I think kind of wrestled with me once and but I ascribe that to\nstupidity rather than, than ordinary malice.",
        "Q: Did you talk over these changes with your parents about Hitler and about the fact that now\nyou know you\u2019re Jewish. Was this the kind of topics that you talked about?",
        "A: I do not recall. So I\u2019m tempted to say no we didn\u2019t. Well they were not willing to face up to\nthe fact that the noose was tightening. They felt this was a temporary difficulty but my father did\ngo to the \u2014 Oh two things.\nMy American born grandmother lost her citizenship when she married my grandfather who was\na Bavarian local well established.",
        "Q: She lost her US citizenship?",
        "A: US citizenship. Then she was widowed. And in 1933 my father said to her, why don\u2019t you\ngo to New York and reclaim your citizenship. Her sister in Nuremberg similarly widowed and\nsituated went with her. And the two ladies spent six weeks in New York. I have a report from a\ndistant relative who claims he invoked the help of Senator Wagner. That\u2019s senior. I don\u2019t know\nhow true that is, but maybe he, anyway they reclaimed their citizenship. And thus my\ngrandmother and her sister are both natural born and naturalized American citizens, which\nhelped certainly. Well it tells you something about my father\u2019s attitude.",
        "Q: His awareness.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: It also meant because I had relatives in the San Francisco Bay area who had not returned to\nGermany when the time came to get an affidavit of support, and assume you know that we would\nnot become public charges, my grandmother got in touch with her genuine first cousin. In other\nwords they had common grandparents and who supplied the affidavit which was rejected by the\nAmerican counsel in Stuttgart, on the grounds that the cousin in San Francisco was too old.\nThereupon the cousin\u2019s daughter co-signed and that made it legitimate. So all of this shows that\nmy parents, or my father who certainly were aware of the tightening noose but didn\u2019t want to\nface up to the fact that it was more than a temporary condition.",
        "Q: You had mentioned previously that you had help in the house, German help and then that\nchanged. How much of a change was it? When the laws came in.",
        "A: No, no change whatsoever. They were treated well.",
        "Q: So your mother was able to keep the housekeeper?",
        "A: She then had temporary not live in help after the Nuremberg laws forbade because all Jewish\nmen lusted after gentile girls or young women. So that was the assumption so you couldn\u2019t have\na full time live in help but you could have part time.",
        "Q: You are going through school and you said the teacher made that comment to you and you\ncame home to your father and talked about leaving.",
        "A: I said I\u2019m ready to go to Geneva which of course represented some financial problems\nbecause there were financial controls. German Jews could not dispose of their money freely.\nThey had to petition for not for internal household expenses, but for foreign expenses. Or\nunusual expenses, like buying real estate or that kind of stuff. I\u2019m not quite up to date, up to date.\nI don\u2019t remember that clearly because after all money was not discussed with the children. But so\nwithin two weeks, I transferred, as I recall. Very quickly I transferred to Geneva. Where my\nfriend Roget the son of these family friends, introduced me to the Coloure Saint Antoine [ph]\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nwhere I was in the seisieme and they were ahead of us in Latin. Also scenes of Gallic wars but\nthey were further along than we were and in some other area like arithmetic or geometry, they\nwere, that was hard. I don\u2019t remember those details either. But above all I flunked the seisieme.\nAnd of all things to flunk, I flunked German because I couldn\u2019t translate it into French and vice\nversa. So when I repeated seisieme in the fall, I did much better. And by early December I left.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s get back to Germany for just a moment. There are a few other questions I wanted to ask\nyou. Was your father\u2019s business affected at all?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: In what way?",
        "A: That may have been the depression rather than \u2014 he gave up his business in 1929 or\nthereabouts and went to work for a leather and shoe factory in the suburbs. I have since\nrecovered some of this information because the grandson of the owner of the shoe factory\npublished the memoirs of his grandfather. All of this was in the past year. And I have some of\nthe details wrong. But he had a good job with this shoe factory, probably as the, the leather\nbuyer or I don\u2019t know that. What I do remember is it was still dark and a winter night at 7:30 in\nthe morning when he joined a car pool. A car pool, probably he, the brother of the owner who\nhad a car and they drove out to the suburbs to go to work. But that somehow or other sticks in\nmy memory.\nBut by the time the Nazis came to power, maybe the factory ran into problems. I don\u2019t know. He\nreestablished his business on a minor scale. Instead of having a separate office and storage\nfacility he operated out of his mother\u2019s, my grandmother\u2019s apartment where he had an office. My\naunt, his sister, unmarried was kind of secretary. And I don\u2019t know those details because money\nbusiness was not discussed in front of the children. Our life style as far as I can tell did not\nchange appreciably.",
        "Q: Why do you think that that one remark bothered you so much that you wanted to leave? You\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nsaid that you really didn\u2019t experience, aside from the soccer game and so forth, much anti-\nSemitism.",
        "A: It must have been a maturation, a realization of gradually increasing obnoxiousness, it was, I\nobviously it is a trivial incident to \u2014 that did it.",
        "Q: What was it like to leave your parents? I mean you were young. You were what, 14.",
        "A: 13. It was quite difficult which is why I turned it down in 1937 when my father first offered it.\nOn the other hand, I did know the family friends in Geneva who did a very nice competent job of\nkind of looking after me. I lived in a boarding house.",
        "Q: Just to get back to Germany. I wanted to finish Germany. Did you have any ID cards,\nidentification cards?",
        "A: The answer is no but for the purposes of, of emigration, I had a imitation password, passport\nwhich I still have. It basically is an identification sheet which says this serves in lieu of a\npassport for purposes \u2014",
        "Q: Because you were a minor.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What about your parents?",
        "A: They had passports and when the law went into effect that all Jews had to take middle names.\nNamely my father did not become Arnold Israel because he had a passport which did not expire\nfor another two years. My mother had to renew her passport and she became Elizabeth Sara. I\nstill have both passports. So and I still have the imitation identification paper for purposes. I\nguess I had to have it in order to go to Switzerland.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "Q: But again when your mother had to put that additional name. She didn\u2019t talk about it to you\nor do you know how it affected her? What was her state, as a mother.",
        "A: I was gone by then. And not only that. In 19, well this is probably also pertinent. Every\nsummer we went away for a nearby summer vacation. Black Forest or that kind of thing. In\n1933 we went to Fronten [ph] which is in the Bavarian, in Bavaria close to the Austrian border.\nIn 1934 Hitler had imposed a thousand mark duty if you wanted to cross over from Germany into\nAustria. In an attempt to of course choke it off. And that was our last summer in Bavaria. Then\nwe Started going to Switzerland for summer vacations. But I remember that very vividly, how the\nchange was from one year to the next. We could go into Austria one year. And then no longer.\nAustria being a piddling distance away.\nSo the change of going to Switzerland was fairly significant in the sense my father wanted to\nread different newspapers. He wanted to but there were financial controls which made it possible\nbut difficult to go abroad for vacations.",
        "Q: Did your sister not leave with you because she was too young?",
        "A: Yes, also when I think back on it. This is speculation. I\u2019m the first born. My father may have\nbeen, wanted to save his first born. This is speculation. She was three years younger, blond, blue\neyed. To the point where my mother went to her school once and the principal asked her are you\nsure that he that he is the father. Actually my sister looks enough like other family members that\nthere\u2019s no doubt but \u2014 Blond blue eyed and had, well I can\u2019t say I had difficulties because I was\nbrown and had brown eyes and brown hair.",
        "Q: Do you remember saying goodbye to your parents?",
        "A: No because there is an odd variation. Our appointment at the American consulate to be\ninterviewed for the visa was December second 1938. I was in Geneva. I came home for that,\nhome, returned to Stuttgart, for that weekend so I could go to the American consulate and be\ninterviewed and then I went back to Geneva. And I knew that was the final visit to Stuttgart. But\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nI knew I was going to see my parents in another month because we met in Paris and, and\nembarked on Christmas eve 1938.",
        "Q: Tell me about your recollections of Kristallnacht. You said you were in Geneva at the time\nand you read about it?",
        "A: I read about it. I knew about it. Somehow or other I never made the connection that my father\nwould be one of those arrested.",
        "Q: How did you find out he was?",
        "A: The friends who looked, kind of looked after me in Geneva, were told by my mother and\nwere told not to tell me. So I didn\u2019t find out til I reported to Stuttgart for the interview at the\nconsulate where I encountered my father who was a mess. He was, I mean he was a broken man\npsychologically, possibly more than physically.",
        "Q: How long was he incarcerated?",
        "A: Three weeks. They had far more inmates than they had planned on so and the only thing that\nI remember his ever talking about was he survived better because he had been 1n the German\narmy and the guards of course were also veterans or, so he knew how to behave. Maybe and this\nis speculation, he got a little bit more respect because the Germans are very fussy in making\ndistinctions between civilian life, military service, combat service. They make the distinction.\nIt\u2019s very important to have been a front line combatant rather than in the supply corps. And he\nhad been a combatant so that got him brownie points.",
        "Q: In what way. He said he was a broken man after this. In what way and how did you know that\nas a 14 year old?",
        "A: Well\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "Q: Just by his appearance, his look?",
        "A: After all I lived with him for two years in San Francisco where he was, where he felt terribly\nd\u00e9class\u00e9 and poor, dependent. And irritable. And in bad health. I do not know to this day\nwhether he died of stomach cancer or stomach --",
        "Q: Ulcers?",
        "A: Ulcers. I don\u2019t know. Possibly both.",
        "Q: When you came back to Stuttgart to get the American visa did you see a lot of damage\nfrom Kristallnacht or had it been cleaned up?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: You did not see, synagogues \u2014",
        "A: Well I spent 48 hours, maybe 72 hours there. And visited my grandmothers, two\ngrandmothers and the family and maybe childhood friends, but those were \u2014",
        "Q: I was wondering if you saw any destroyed synagogues or things like that?",
        "A: The synagogue was on the other side of town. I mean there, that was not part of my ambit. I\nmay have seen some broken windows in the department store, but that may be a retroactive\nimagination. I do not know.",
        "Q: So you get the visa. You go back to Switzerland.",
        "A: For three weeks.",
        "Q: For three weeks, and then.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: Met my parents in Paris on \u2014",
        "Q: You got yourself from Switzerland to Paris.",
        "A: Oh yes. In some ways I was quite independent in terms of \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s why, when I was asking that question how you would describe yourself. You were\nonly 14.",
        "A: When I returned from Geneva to Stuttgart in order to go to the consulate, I bought the ticket,\nor maybe they bought it for me and I was supposed to go from Geneva to Zurich to Calzoo [ph]\nand change there to an express to Stuttgart. Well wise guy George when he got through Calzoo\nfigured out that there was a semi express which left earlier and would get to Stuttgart half an\nhour earlier. So I took it of course. My mother traveled to Calzoo in order to meet me and\nintercept me so that was a disaster but it\u2019s evidence or example of my independence. So yes,\ntraveling from Geneva to Paris on my own at age \u2014",
        "Q: 14.",
        "A: Barely 14 yes. And by that time I spoke reasonably fluent French so nothing to it.",
        "Q: So now you\u2019re in France.",
        "A: We only spent three days in Paris, where we had relatives.",
        "Q: Your parents and your sister, right?",
        "A: I think my Aunt Nellie was part of the package too. Single, sister of my father, unmarried.\nAnd we, Paris was quite meaningful because the cousin who had given me my first two books\nfrom Nuremberg, and they had emigrated in 1933 to Paris and were completely assimilated, at\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nleast to my outsider\u2019s view. And that was quite an interesting experience. We had probably\nChristmas dinner with them, although they all were converts to Catholicism. And all of the\ndescendants are Catholic. I have them in my family tree but we, they do not wish to maintain\ncontact. I\u2019m not being critical. I\u2019m merely noting. So those were three days in Paris, interesting.\nBecause I spoke French, I was probably more important to my parents than \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah. Do you remember your little sister\u2019s state of mind about leaving Germany?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Friends?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure she did well. She certainly adjusted in San Francisco faster than any of us. She went\nto elementary school and junior high but then she also is a much more sensitive or was in terms\nof inter personal relations than I am so she adjusted better.",
        "Q: Did you notice anything in Paris related to the war at that point? Did you notice people\ntalking about Hitler, the French people when you were there?",
        "A: Three days in Paris 1s not enough to notice or remember. And in Switzerland of course I\ntended to associate with people who were anti-Fascist to use a__ term.",
        "Q: When you were in Germany, did you ever listen to the speeches on the radio, Hitler\u2019s\nspeeches on the radio?",
        "A: Probably but I can\u2019t answer for sure.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember any reaction you had or your parents\u2019 reaction?",
        "A: The very fact that my father listened to radio Strasbourg tells you something about, oh and he\nhad a one close friend, maybe even two and they went to the Salon of then, and they talked\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\npolitics and smoked cigars. And I wasn\u2019t supposed to know about that and but I certainly did\nknow that it was subversive if you wish.",
        "Q: This is in Stuttgart?",
        "A: Oh yes. And the two friends in particular that I remember. One was an artist, a painter. In fact\nI have two of his paintings in my living room. He went to Buenos Aires where he died. My wife\nand I visited him 20 years ago. And the other one was a newspaper reporter and I don\u2019t know\nwhat happened to him.",
        "Q: Did you see any evidences of anti-Semitism not to yourself, on the streets of Stuttgart?",
        "A: Yes, I mentioned that the swimming pools had signs saying no Jews allowed. The public\ncomfort stations had signs and our parents would come to stand guard if we had to go. And the,\nacross the street there was a baker. A bakery with a cafe, two entrances. I think both posted the\nsign no Jews wanted or allowed, but the delivery boy continued to deliver the rolls in the\nmorning.",
        "Q: To you all?",
        "A: To us. In other words, business was more important than ideology. We never felt, in the\nneighborhood, we never felt it.",
        "Q: So you never felt threatened?",
        "A: Any threats or anti-Semitism that I can recall.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t see other people getting beaten or anything like that?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know of any other Jews in the neighborhood. Well there was a, around the corner\nthere was a tobacco store, a tobacconist and the owners were Jewish, which I didn\u2019t know. Not\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nonly that. I think they were Polish Jews. And it embarrasses me to say this today but Polish Jews\nwere different. You know Hans Hirsch. Hans and I got in a discussion, disagreement when I told\nhim, yes I have since found out there was a Stuttgart chapter of B\u2019Nai Brith and it had a clause\nsaying no Polish Jews admitted or wanted. And he said oh no you\u2019re wrong. So we pulled down\nthe book that, I was right. It\u2019s probably the only time in my life that Hans was wrong.",
        "Q: Did you feel bad about leaving Germany? This was where you were born. This was your\nhome and you were leaving your country. What was that?",
        "A: Yes there probably was some nostalgia but I cannot answer the question for sure. I\u2019ve been\nback several times since then and yes, this was home and it feels quite comfortable and homey in\nsome ways. Because all of the traces of the nastiness have been erased. How I felt at the time of\nleaving I can\u2019t answer that question either, how I felt.",
        "Q: Did you, besides those two books that you loved, did you take anything else special with you?",
        "A: My parents arranged for a so called lift which is a massive container to store the furniture to\nbe shipped, furniture, linens et cetera. It never arrived in San Francisco, even though it was\nprepaid and insured. My mother established photo albums when I was born and a separate\nalbum when my sister was born. She had the wit to shove those in the suitcase and they, I own\nmine to this day. My sister owned, well her kids own it to this day. And I had occasion to use it\njust a couple of days ago but yes.",
        "Q: Anything personal besides that that you took as a 14 year old boy, besides your books?",
        "A: That is again difficult to answer because my grandmother\u2019s lift, household container, was also\nlost. Also prepaid. My Aunt Nellie, single unmarried sister of my father, her lift came. Well\nbecause she\u2019s unmarried, she lived with her mother, my grandmother. To this day I have\ninherited a few things that go back to my grandmother and I sometimes fail to make the\ndistinction whether it was my home or hers. There is a certain continuity. And that is how I own\ntwo pictures, two paintings by this artist who was a friend of my father\u2019s.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "Q: Where and what boat, where did you sail from and what boat did you go on?",
        "A: Can we stop at this point?",
        "Q: Sure.\nGail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with George Arnstein. This is track number two. And we\u2019re talking about your leaving\nfor the United States. And what boat did you go on and where did you go from?\nGeorge Arnstein: It was the port of embarkation was Cherbourg. The name of the ship was\nFranconia, of the Cunard line. And it was very, well it was, my first look at the Atlantic and it\nwas a winter, not very smooth passage. I think we got sea sick but not terribly so \u2014",
        "Q: What was your date of \u2014",
        "A: Christmas Eve, 24\" of December, 1938. And we landed in New York on the second of\nJanuary 1939. The crossing was, there was one thing worth mentioning, in my opinion. There\nwere lots of other German and Austrian refugees. And I think at age 14, I mightily flirted with a\ngirl and I remember my parents\u2019 displeasure because she was not of the proper class. It\u2019s trivial\nand I don\u2019t mean to suggest that they in any way said oh you may not speak to her or anything\nlike that. I just felt a slight \u2014",
        "Q: Were these Jewish refugees?",
        "A: Yes.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "Q: These were Jewish refugees",
        "A: But Austrian. I mean there were both German and Austrian but this particular girl \u2014",
        "Q: Did you feel Jewish at that point?",
        "A: No. Or marginally. But following on that question, we were hung up in New York for six\nweeks, because of an idiosyncrasy of the German currency regulations. You could prepay your\nvoyage to San Francisco in German marks, provided it was by ship. You could not go by rail.\nWe were prepaid to San Francisco and then the American company would not recognize the\nticket. And so we spent six weeks in New York and then they relented on a winter luxury cruise\nthat was not sold out, from New York to Havana. To Panama, to Acapulco, to Los Angeles, to\nSan Francisco. We were in a third class cabin but these cruises give you the run of the ship and it\nwas an unlikely beginning. And I remember it did not have an outdoor pool. It had an indoor\npool. They built an outdoor pool by throwing together some wooden frame and lining it with a\ncanvas.\nAnd to this day I remember crossing the Panama Canal, floating in this outdoor pool and saying\nif I ever amount to something, I would like to do this again, which my wife and I did some 25\nyears ago. Not in a canvas covered pool. Sorry that\u2019s a detour but hung up in New York, I\nactually enrolled in public school number 12345, in the eighth grade which I flunked because I\ndidn\u2019t know enough English. I was farmed out to some relatives who had emigrated earlier than\nwe did. And lived in Jack, not in Jackson Heights. In the part of Manhattan that there \u2014",
        "Q: Washington Heights?",
        "A: Washington Heights, thank you. Also known as Frankfurt on the Hudson. Where first of all I\nlearned some English and they were very helpful and they had been my parents\u2019 bridge partners\nin Stuttgart. I mean this was a close relationship. The thing I remember more vividly than\nanything else, my first exposure to the A&P and self-service. At the end of six weeks we left,\nsailed.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "Q: What did America mean to you at that point? As a young German immigrant?",
        "A: A place of refuge. A place where my great grandfather had migrated to during the gold rush,\nand where my grandmother was born in San Francisco, which is why we were headed to San\nFrancisco, which thus in a way was part of my memory. I identified with it easily and readily,\nmore than with America in general. That was an abstraction. San Francisco was something\nspecific.",
        "Q: Were your parents very emotional when you arrived in the United States do you think?",
        "A: Ihave no idea. But speaking of emotions. I do remember, I wasn\u2019t there but my mother told\nme this story. When they traveled from Stuttgart to Paris by train on or about the 21\u201c of\nDecember, on the Orient Express. As they crossed the Rhine from Kale [ph] to Strasbourg, my\nfather got up and spit in the Rhine or did something symbolic that I don\u2019t remember the details.\nBut my mother proudly told the story that, of that symbolic crossing.\nAnd parenthetically in their passports, the exit from Germany is on the 20\" of December. The\nentry stamp for France is on the 21\u201c. It was that close to midnight. I may have the dates off by a\nday or so but the one day difference I do know.",
        "Q: Now you\u2019re a student in New York for six weeks and then.",
        "A: That was sobering. The discipline, you had to line up to walk from one classroom to the other\nand that\u2019s about all I remember and of course I flunked. By the time we arrived in San Francisco\nand that\u2019s a story worth telling. We still thought our furniture would come so we stayed in a\nhotel for three or four days and then cousin Fanny, an American, third generation American.\nCame by and found us a furnished apartment. Whereupon my father went to see the manager\nand said where is the nearest high school. I want my son to start in the morning. Where 1s the\nnearest elementary school. And when cousin Fanny and Manny, her husband. Fanny wore the\npants in the family. Came by. My father proudly announced, oh George is going to start Galileo\nHigh School in the morning. Whereupon cousin Fanny said no member of our family has ever\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\ngone to Galileo. I will take George to Lowell high school and introduce him to the principal,\nwhich she did. And that is how I wound up in a very much academically kind of elitist public\nhigh school in San Francisco, which had a college graduation. I mean college \u2014",
        "Q: Curriculum.",
        "A: College prep curriculum. It had no shop. It did have shorthand and typing for the girls. I took\ntyping. Good thing I did. But it was completely academically oriented. And even before the war\nit graduated something like 92 percent who went on to college.",
        "Q: Did the other students ask you about your background and experience?",
        "A: No. Because I had begun Lowell in late January I guess and the change of semester occurred\nlet\u2019s say on the tenth of February. There were quite a few junior high school students who\ntransferred into Lowell as sophomores and I became a sophomore. But I was already established\nas a Lowell student, by virtue of two weeks or whatever it was. And I was almost elected room\nrepresentative. And I didn\u2019t know what a room representative was.",
        "Q: Obviously you weren\u2019t a Californian so you were different than the other students. Did they\nnot question or ask you?",
        "A: What I now know and did not know then is that Lowell high school was disproportionately\nJewish. To what extent I don\u2019t know because I didn\u2019t think in those terms but I will cite as an\nexample that Supreme Court Justice Breyer is a Lowell alumnus.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t ask you about life in Germany or Hitler or anything like that. You didn\u2019t talk.",
        "A: Not that I recall. Well no, there is an exception.",
        "Q: Or the teachers?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: There was a classmate named Sidney Brown who clearly was fascinated by the idea of having\na friend who had escaped from the jaws of \u2014 and introduced me to his parents. I was not\nsufficiently with it to realize what was going on. And Sidney died I think before graduation of\nnatural causes. And I didn\u2019t have enough sense to visit the parents or, I mean, whatever I was\nsupposed to do. Which would have been to my advantage with hindsight because they would\nhave quasi adopted me. He was an only child. I don\u2019t want to sound mercenary but, so there is\nan exception. I know for sure that Sidney, with hindsight, almost certainly of Eastern Jewish\norigin. Sorry to make these distinctions but they do matter.",
        "Q: Did the teachers ask you about your experience?",
        "A: Not that I recall. Now I took French, where of course I was a stellar student and skipped four,\nfive, six until I got to French eight, but which time my French had declined. I still did well but,\nand of course in French, it was predominantly girls, where again I was. I don\u2019t want to say I was\ntreated as a pet. But I was a little bit different because I knew so much more than they did, with\nthe exception of Lucille who had a French mother.",
        "Q: But you picked up English quickly?",
        "A: I must have. I probably lost all accent by the time I went in the army. And of course,\nreacquired an accent by virtue of having served in the European theater where I had to speak\nGerman. I can\u2019t be certain of that but \u2014",
        "Q: Tell me about your parents\u2019 adjustment. Your mother.",
        "A: My mother did a lot better than my father. My father never adjusted. He couldn\u2019t find a\ndecent job. He died on the 25\"\" of November, two weeks before Pearl Harbor, which meant of\ncourse, full employment came right after that. The relatives in San Francisco were\nconscientious, helpful, but they were all retired and they had warned him we\u2019re not going to be\nvery helpful in getting you settled in a job or occupation.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "Q: Financially how did your family manage?",
        "A: There my father was reasonably provident. Reasonably. Within the limits of the restrictions.\nOn one of my trips to Switzerland. Maybe it was the final one. I don\u2019t remember. They handed\nme a box, cigar box size. Wrapped as a gift. Told me to put it under the seat, not tell anybody\nand retrieve it afterwards. And that is how a good deal of jewelry was smuggled out. I don\u2019t\nknow all those details because children are not initiated into financial affairs. But he used various\ndevices to accumulate some money. There was another fortunate thing. The provider of the\naffidavit, a first cousin of my grandmother\u2019s, obviously an old lady because she was turned\ndown, being too old for the affidavit, died within half a year after we got there. And my father\nwas in her will to the tune of one half of one percent or some ridiculous sum like that. Which\nturned out to be $4000. I mean it, I use the word ridiculous. Obviously I \u2014\nThere were things like that. And another cousin helped my mother invest the money or he\nborrowed some money from my mother at a high rate of interest. They did various things to help.\nThere was another fallout which I consider very fortunate. Not only did I go to a good high\nschool. A cousin lived within four blocks of home in a very elegant district. We didn\u2019t. They\nhad season tickets to the San Francisco Symphony. When they couldn\u2019t go, we got the tickets.\nSo I kind of grew up with Pierre Monteux and the San Francisco symphony. And I swear by\nPierre Monteux to this day. These are the kinds of things that I think you were looking for.\nOne other thing that fits in with your questions. In New York a cousin on my mother\u2019s side who\nI have since found out was born in Switzerland, but I thought he was native born American,\nbecause he was genuine American and had married a genuine American. Told my mother oh of\ncourse you\u2019re coming on either Saturday or Sunday to Temple Emanuel. Literally the first time\nin my life that I had been to a synagogue, of which I remember essentially nothing except that it\nwas not that different from the Protestant services I had gone to occasionally with one of the\nmaids or\u2014\nThere was organ music and there was a I think a choir but significant in terms of this interview, I\nthink is literally the first time in my life that I set foot in a synagogue.",
        "Q: How Jewish did you feel in San Francisco?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: Not at all. We lived in within five blocks of Temple Emanuel to which some relatives\nbelonged and it was there and oh I got a gift membership in the Jewish community center which\nhad a pool and a library of comic books which helped my Americanization. That\u2019s about it. Oh,\nno. One other significant thing. After Pearl Harbor you may recall there were enacted a series of\nlaws or regulations, the evacuation of the Japanese, which meant that native born Americans of\nJapanese descent, including my classmate Torsho [ph] were evacuated. We technically enemy\naliens, were merely subject to a curfew. We could not travel more than five miles from home\nunless we were going directly to or from school or work. And we had to be home by eight PM,\nwhich means that I could not attend my own high school graduation in the San Francisco opera\nhouse, which was held at eight PM. And because Drummond law observing tradition, my\nmother said, my father was dead by then. You can\u2019t go and I didn\u2019t go. There are 27 people who\nhave told me since then but you could have passed. It was no great deprivation for me but it\nanswers your question of did I feel Jewish. Well this also meant that we couldn\u2019t go out Saturday\nnight like other adolescents. So there were three or four of us who got together on Sunday\nafternoon because that\u2019s the best we could do on weekends.",
        "Q: But this is because you were German?",

        "A: Let me continue with enemy alien because that has -- When I was inducted in the US Army in\nMay or June of 1943, I was sent to the Presidio of Monterrey and I said where do I go to get\nnaturalized, because I knew that as soon as you were in the military you were eligible. You\ndidn\u2019t have to wait the full five years. Oh, no, no that will happen when you take your basic\ntraining. So I was sent to Fort Riley Kansas, the cavalry school. And took my basic training and\nthe mounted cavalry, horse cavalry. Where I asked where do I go to get naturalized. Oh you\u2019re\njust trying to get out of the obstacle course. Not now, not here.\nAt the end of 16 weeks of basic training horse cavalry, mounted radio operator. I got my orders,\na week delayed en route as it was called which means basically annual leave. And then you have\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nto report to the port of embarkation. I made it as far as the change station in Junction City, alias\nJunk Town. My name was not called. Why? Nobody knew. Go, go back to Fort Riley. So I did\nwhere I found out the following morning I could not be shipped overseas because I was not yet a\ncitizen. That shipment wound up on the Anzio beach head. So they didn\u2019t know what to do with\nme, still not naturalized, so they sent me to advanced communication school. I was trained as a\nradio operator where the instructors were delighted that there were three of us who were\ninterested in cryptography, crypto analysis. Nobody thought the fact that here an enemy alien\nwas inducted and a crypto analysis which I never used. And in due time I was shipped out to\ncamp McCoy, 76\" cavalry, reconnaissance troop mechanized. And then I was naturalized at\nLacrosse Wisconsin and was ready for, we were then sent overseas anyway.\nBut and didn\u2019t wind up all that well. We were committed during the Battle of the Bulge.

        "Q: Did you think a lot about Germany while you were in the army?",
        "A: Only in the hostile sense. Yes. I thought about Germany, that we knew we were going to be\nshipped to the European theater which meant that I would probably be useful. I turned out to be\nuseful in the reconnaissance outfit where if we took prisoners we had to ship them back to\ndivision headquarters where there was a IPW team, interrogation of prisoners of war who had\nbeen properly trained. And four days later we might find out whatever wanted to know. We\nwanted to know being a reconnaissance outfit what was over the next hill or in those woods\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nahead of us. And that is where I turned out to be very useful. I could go unskilled interrogation\non the spot. So did I think a lot about Germany\u2019? Good heavens, we confronted it daily.\nOne of the incidents worth mentioning. We would occupy a new village or a new site. It\noccurred to me, maybe the phones are still working but who would I call. And I was also careful\nenough what would my fellow troopers think. Would they clearly realize that I so two reasons\nnot to use the phone.

        "A: I was part of a reconnaissance troop which disembarked in Le Havre. And we crossed\nFrance, Belgium and Luxembourg fairly fast and of course in France I spoke French. In Belgium\nI spoke French. Very shortly. In Luxembourg, they weren\u2019t at all surprised that I could talk to\nthe natives in what Sergeant White described as slop bucket Dutch, which I didn\u2019t speak but they\neither spoke French or German. We crossed the what we call the Siegfried line and the Germans\ncalled the Westwall and basically crossed all of Germany and advanced clear into what later\nbecame the Soviet zone of the German Democratic Republic because we were over achievers.\nWe advanced too far. We were for six weeks part of the very short lived American occupation\nof Saxony. Because as reconnaissance, we were hit and run. Our job was not to fight. Our job\nwas to reconnoiter and report back, which made for a very uneven life. But it was like the\ninfantry which \u2014",

        "A: I didn\u2019t talk to them very much except, oh I remember when we crossed over in Germany the\nexec, choke commander said oh from now on we\u2019re going to be billeted whenever possible in\nhomes. No more slip trenches, no more camping out. And you corporal George, I don\u2019t know.\nYou are going to tell them they have 30 minutes to clear out. I said, who me. Tell them. Well you\nget used to it very quickly. And that is what we did whenever we needed billets and I amended\nthe orders and said don\u2019t lock anything up because American, we had trench knives, not\nbayonets, variations of. We\u2019ll only be doubly tempted by whatever is locked and you will lose.",
        "Q: More.",
        "A: Other than that I didn\u2019t amend the orders. I also told my fellow troopers who we very quickly\ndiscovered ham and chimneys and eggs in the chicken houses. Yes, by all means. But why don\u2019t\nyou leave the K ration, chocolate and a few cigarettes by way of paying them back which as far\nas I know they did.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nBut we had no compunction about raiding chicken coops or hauling ham out of the chimneys.\nDid I talk to Germans? Well obviously to, to tell them to get out. There wasn\u2019t much\nconversation, no. They stayed away from us. They wanted to know could they come back and\nmilk the cows or could they come. And occasionally they would say I never even was no Nazi no\nhow. There was essentially no interaction other than necessary interaction.",
        "Q: Did you ever let any of them know you were from Germany?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall that the question came up but I certainly didn\u2019t mention it. On the other hand,\nthey drew, some of them probably drew their own conclusions when somebody spoke \u2014",
        "Q: Fluent.",
        "A: At that point I spoke fluent, but not adult German. I acquired an adult vocabulary of course,\nduring those months, but not only that, I spoke with a southern dialect. No, they did not\ninterrogate me.",
        "Q: Did you try to go back to Stuttgart?",
        "A: Much later. Ok. The end of hostilities was the ninth of May when we were deep in the heart\nof Saxony. We held a victory parade in Saxony. We were invited to the Russian parade which\nwas across the river. Which I don\u2019t remember very clearly but it happened. There, during those\nsix weeks, quasi-peace time in the sense that no hostilities. There I was exposed to a lot of\nGerman conversation and probably sought it out because I was curious to learn what they were\nlike and what they were feeling. We lived in German housing that we had taken over. Long\ndetour. This was in Limbach in Saxony. Well we had taken a corner house. And we hung an\nAmerican flag from the balcony. I still have a picture of two Gls standing and the flag, not me\nbut two fellow troopers. Four years ago I went to Berlin to meet a German historian who was\nalso interested in this six week occupation of the later German Democratic Republic. And we\nhad exchanged e-mails and he was fascinated. Some of the photo \u2014 oh he doesn\u2019t know much\nEnglish so he found a correspondent who could correspond in German. And had photographs. He\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nchecked up on me. He asked me did I remember where we were billeted in Limbach. I said well\nit was across from a park and I vaguely remember. Maybe it was called Allee esse Strasse [ph]\nnumber 15. Here is a photograph of the house. He went. It was number 13, not number 15. But\nbecause he had a photograph. He interviewed the residents and he found a woman who said oh I\nwas a seven year old girl and there was a German who spoke with a southern accent. It was this\nAmerican who \u2014 He didn\u2019t\u2019 check up on me. He kind of wanted to authenticate. That\u2019s a lengthy\ndetour of your question, did I interact with the Germans. Yes, after the end of hostilities a whole\nlot. I found a photo shop in Limbach which still had chemicals and paper and by that time a lot\nof Americans had acquired cameras. Liberated cameras. And asked me could I arrange to have\nthe film developed. And I had duplicates made for my own collection. Thus I have probably the\nlargest collection of photographs.\nIn a different small town, I arranged for laundry service. We had to provide the soap of course\nbut the underwear came back ironed and all of this is by way of answering your question, did I\nhave much interaction with the Germans. Not during the combat period. Except when necessary.\nAnd of course eternally they said oh I never was a Nazi or I was this, I tended to cut them up s,\ncut them off short. Got to be a litany.",
        "Q: And Jewish refugees you said \u2014",
        "A: Well we encountered all kinds of displaced persons. A name not, then not known. They were\ncalled slave laborers, even though some we found out had volunteered. I remember a Belgian\ngirl, young woman who admitted clearly that she had volunteered. There was nothing to eat at\nhome. And by working she was reasonably well taken care of, along with half a dozen others.\nThose were non-Jewish volunteers. The displaced persons, Jewish, that\u2019s where I discovered\nthat I didn\u2019t speak Yiddish but if they spoke slowly and if I repeated everything twice in German\nwe could communicate. I didn\u2019t know there was such a language. Well I guess I did know that\nthere were Americans who spoke Yiddish but whoever they were. I have since learned from\nHans Hirsch that there is a variation called western Yiddish which my German ancestors\nprobably spoke. Hans knows far more about that than I do. But he has educated me.",
        "Q: Did you feel any connection to these Jewish DPs?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: No. I should but I didn\u2019t. Now I do remember clearly in Yayna, [ph] for example, a town in\neast Germany, former East Germany. We had advanced without military government personnel.\nThere were no, we had advanced too far. There was no provision for military government. And I\nwas asked to improvise. And facetiously and in quotation marks, I became the chief of police of\nYayna. Nobody had issued orders for all arms to be turned in for example. So I issued the order\nand sent out the town crier. That is how the order got amended by various Americans or all\ncameras had to be turned in. I did not issue that order but in fact I never acquired a camera. But\nwe at that point I, your question was dealing with the DPs or Jews. I very clearly remember that\nwe took over a former German garrison just explicitly as quarters for the Jewish liberated\nrefugees, whatever you want to call them. Displaced persons today. That we tried to provide food\nfor them because they didn\u2019t have ration stamps and things like that. But I was chief of police for\nsix days so there\u2019s a limit to what you can accomplish.\nWe had to improvise because while there was quite good American preparation for military\ngovernment it had not extended that far east. I have actually written an essay about that particular\nepisode because it is that unusual. And I have since read a German historian and I don\u2019t quite\nagree with his description of that six week occupation. I\u2019ve probably gone too far afield.",
        "Q: it wasn\u2019t a particular DP camp. You just met \u2014",
        "A: No, this was not a camp. This was \u2014",
        "Q: Individual DPs",
        "A: These were refugees liberated and they needed to be taken care of. And I certainly took the\ninitiative. I\u2019m not patting myself on the back. That because I spoke German, I was expected to\ndo all kinds of things.",
        "Q: How long did you stay in Europe?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: In Europe. Do you know about the point system? Ok Ill explain it briefly. To be repatriated\nto the US you had to have a certain number of points because they were this enormous number of\nAmericans who were ready to go home. In August of course the war with Japan ended, against\nJapan ended. You had to have \u2014",
        "Q: Let\u2019s back up a little bit. What was your reaction when you heard Hitler died? Do you\nremember that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember any reaction. The point is we were winning and the war was almost over or\ncompletely over. There, that was irrelevant.",
        "Q: All right, so now it\u2019s August of 45.",
        "A: I was sent to camp San Francisco near Chateau Thierry for reassignment because I was not\nready to go home. This was the so called repo depot, replacement depot. I managed to get to\nParis twice. Illegal passes. And I knew I was going to be sent back to Germany because to be\nrepatriated you had to have points. You earned one point for every month of active service. You\ngot a second point for every month of overseas service. And you get five points for every medal\nor Purple Heart. Well I didn\u2019t have enough points. I had to wait my turn. So I was sent back.\nAnd assigned to Eisenhower\u2019s headquarters. US Forces, European theater. US FET. Where I\nwas a clerk working under WAC Captain which I did not resent. Interesting now. Some of my\ncolleagues resented it. And one of my duties was to drive a colonel to the airport or something\nlike that. And I remember the colonel said and how do you like your job corporal. And I said\nfrankly sir, I don\u2019t. I am bored. I have skills. I am bilingual and I am not being utilized.\nIncredibly enough within a week I was transferred to a suburb of Frankfurt. It was called the UT,\nU S Information service. It later became the US Information Service. And it was then called the\nInformation Service Control Command. Where I wound up in a fascinating assignment. A daily,\nbecause I had a minimum of journalism exposure. A daily digest of all anti-American activities\nin the American sector. The werewolves, I don\u2019t know if you have ever heard of them. There\nwere some Nazi fanatics up in the Alps who were doing terrible things to, I mean never\namounted to anything but there was much talk about the werewolves.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nAnd the other thing I remember is any number of Germans came home and found that their\ngirlfriends or wives had been seduced by Americans or by American chocolate or cigarettes and\nthereupon they either cussed out the Americans or did actually something anti-American. That\nwas the daily confirmation. But what impressed me, it was for circulation only to colonels and\nup. And here I was a corporal. That lasted a while. I have since tried to go to the archives and\nfind my immortal prose. I haven\u2019t been able to find it and it\u2019s not worth the effort. I have not\nbeen able to find comparable compilations either.",
        "Q: You mentioned the werewolves. Did they come down hunting for Jews again?",
        "A: Oh no, no. there that was a continuation of the fight against the allies. It was, it does not, or\nI\u2019m sure they would have. No it was not explicitly anti-Semitic. It was anti Allied. It didn\u2019t\namount to anything. It was trivial. And it was probably reported more thoroughly than it was in\nfact. After a few weeks in Bad Hamburg editing this daily digest I asked to be transferred to the\nprovinces and I was assigned to Regensburg which is on the Danube in Bavaria. The district\ninformation command which was doing de-Nazification work. In those days to work on a newly\nreconstituted newspaper or radio or no television. Or even appear on the stage. You had to go\nthrough a de-Nazification which was a questionnaire with 101 questions. And there were three\nof us, three Americans. In Regensburg who did this kind of de-Nazification. We also did what\nwas no longer called censorship of the newspaper. But post publication scrutiny. Which means\nwe read the damn thing and if we found anything objectionable we were supposed to object.\nNever happened.\nI remember with a colleague named Bill Clark who knew German but his German was\natrocious. And my German of course improved daily and became much more adult. We went to\nthe nearby town of Straubing [ph] because there were rumors that the local theater had put on an\nanti-American play. I don\u2019t remember the author, I think it was Kleist and it dealt with the\nFrench revolution or something like that. We enjoyed the performance, went back to Regensburg\nand said nothing. Straubing sticks in my memory because I ran into a German Jew and his\ndaughter who had survived the war. I think he was married to a gentile, who alleged that he\nremembered my ancestral factory, 80 kilometers to the north. I did not pursue it in any\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nmeaningful way. It was one of the few cases where I actually encountered some vague link with\nmy patrilineal ancestry.\nWell in due time at the end of Regensburg I had enough points to be repatriated. And --",

And I accepted jobs with an English language newspaper in of all places Stuttgart.\nIt went bankrupt at the end of eight weeks but, and that was my year in Europe. I was at loose\nends.

I never taught arts and\ncrafts. I taught at San Francisco State College for a semester. It\u2019s now called San Francisco,\nCalifornia State University, San Francisco. These are inflationary times. I came east because I\nhad a job offer from the National Education Association to become assistant editor of the\nmonthly journal which was quite a professional production. Circulation 600,000. I mean \u2014\nI had a lot to learn. On the other hand I had enough, oh I left out something. Somewhere along\nthe line I became a contributing book reviewer for the San Francisco Chronicle, which meant I\ngot to keep the books which we traded 1n at the Berkeley book store where we had a positive\nbalance. I mean they bought them second hand but sold them. I\u2019m sure they \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nMy wife was so impressed that she said oh I could try my hand at that. And I brought home a\ncouple of books. She was at that point a deputy juvenile probation officer and there was a book\non juvenile delinquency and I brought it home and she did a glorious review, which her bosses\nliked because she wove in their names and the Oakland probation department. That led to the\nCalifornia Teachers\u2019 Association Journal asking me would I do an occasional review for them\nwhich wound up doing a couple of articles for them. And that led to a referral to the National\nEducation Association where I became an assistant editor and we moved to Washington, have\nbeen here ever since.\nI taught at Penn State for one summer session while working for the NEA. In the history of\neducation. Recycled my old lecture notes. But basically decided that the academic life was not\nfor me. I have since had several research jobs and other policy jobs in education. But it\u2019s a\nmixed bag and I don\u2019t know if you want to go into my whole career which is erratic or\nopportunistic.",

        "A: Almost certainly not. No. Not pertinent.",
        "Q: You talked about what your education was?",
        "A: By way of reinforcing that. While still working for the NEA, I was invited to give a lecture in\nGerman. I was then working for the NEA for the so called automation project which dealt with\nthe impact of automation on education. I was invited to give a lecture on automation at the Ost\nCollege in Cologne, in German. Ok. Sounds like fun. I wrote a lecture very carefully in English,\ntranslated it into German. Sent it to a former German classmate for editing. And he cleaned it\nup. He said it didn\u2019t need much fixing. Gave the lecture in Cologne. At the end of which there\nwas a question and answer period which I handled reasonably well. And when it was all over\nsomebody asked me, did your parents come from southern Germany. I said yes, why do you ask?\nWell you speak with a southern accent, but did never even entertain the idea that I had was an\nimmigrant or I cite the incident only by, as an elaborate answer to your question.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nGail Schwartz: This is the continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with George Arnstein. This is track number 3. And let\u2019s talk now a little bit about your\nthoughts and your perspectives, considering where you were born and what you went through.\nWhat are your thoughts about Germany today? You said you\u2019d gone back obviously on visits\nand lectures. Just generally what --\nGeorge Arnstein: Let me detour. My wife was a powerful influence on my life, which I\u2019m sure\nhappens in other marriages too but unusually so. She was smart, competent, sensitive, et cetera.\nOn our first trip to Europe which she was eager to do, we also stopped off in Stuttgart, ostensibly\nto liquidate a wicker basket which had been deposited by my great aunt Clare with a bank in\nStuttgart when Clare, American born, great aunt, and the bank had charged annually a modest\ndeposit fee, rent. And my wife said we\u2019ve got to liquidate that. Fine, we \u2014 among other things.\nShe also said and this is typical of my wife. I want to know where you came from. So we looked\nat the house we lived in. And things like that. We also went to the bank. It took half an hour to\nproduce the wicker basket. And it contained linens, towels, 12 pieces of silverware which\nhowever is not sterling because the German standard is only 875 and sterling is 92% or\nsomething like that. And there also were a couple of arm bands and I said oh these. She said oh I\nthink there was something. They turned out to be gold and one went to my sister and one went\nto Sherry. She spotted them. The linens we gave to former maids whom we also looked up. The\npieces of silver, we took to a local silversmith, jewelry store. We would like to buy, we had\nGerman restitution funds. We would like to buy 12 place settings and they said we can\u2019t do that\nbecause we don\u2019t have enough silver and we can\u2019t import any. You have to have old silver to\ntrade in. And I said well we just happen to have this pile. And literally that\u2019s how it happened\nand that is how today I own place settings for 12 1n almost sterling silver.\nYou ask about my feelings about Stuttgart. This is an example of my wife\u2019s influence in, to some\nextent, reconciling me and on that same trip. Oh.",
        "Q: What year was that? When did you go?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: 57, 58.",
        "Q: The 1950s, ok.",
        "A: I also engaged in a long correspondence, dealing with restitution. My mother doesn\u2019t type.\nMy sister doesn\u2019t know German. She does, but badly. And so it befell to me and I inherited all\nthese documents, from my aunt Nellie, from my mother, from my grandmother. I still have an\nenormous collection of them. And I successfully pursued any number of restitution claims.\nSuccessfully has its limits. They were put into blocked mark accounts because Germany in those\ndays had no foreign currency. They were essentially bankrupt. So you could use the money\nwithin Germany but you could not, oh you could sell it in Switzerland at a terrific discount which\nwe did a couple of times. And of course I shared everything with my mother and sister. The\nresult is that we were wealthy when we were in Stuttgart. And in the process I engaged a lawyer\nin Stuttgart and got a letter from one of his interns for lack of a better name who identified\nhimself as a former classmate who is now an apprentice lawyer. And he would fully understand\nif I did not want to correspond, continue the correspondence. The point is I did, and we\u2019re still\nfriends today. His kids have visited here and et cetera.\nPS, his father was a printer with the pre-war Social Democratic newspaper. In other words, left-\nleaning.\nSo that is another, shall we say point of reference where we had access to a, oh they weren\u2019t\nliving in Stuttgart. They had been evacuated during the war. Where my wife got a feeling for\nhow Germans lived and was most curious to learn about my previous life. Is this the kind of\nstuff?",
        "Q: Yeah, I just want to go into your, what your thoughts about Germany, whether you\u2019re\ncomfortable there.",
        "A: At the Ost College, the lecture I gave in German, very significant. I faced a decision. If I\naccepted that invitation, for which there was a trivial honorarium, I had to accept the Germans. I\nhad to make my peace. So I was confronted with a decision and I made it.

Every once in a while I run into somebody who of course is of my generation. And there I\ntend to have problems. Nothing hostile. They all behave very properly. And I behave I hope\nproperly, but I simply don\u2019t relate to them the way I relate to younger people. There 1s an\nAmerican foundation, the Obermeyer Foundation. Arthur Obermeyer is a third generation\nAmerican of German Jewish descent from southwest Germany. And he has established an annual\naward, honoring those Germans who are doing something to keep alive the German Jewish\nmemory. It\u2019s mostly restoration of cemeteries and that kind of stuff. And four years ago, Hans\nHirsch and I and a couple of others nominated somebody successfully. And I thought ok, I\u2019ve\ndone my thing. So Hans asked me, you\u2019re going of course. I said it hadn\u2019t occurred to me but I\nwent. Found it very interesting and [Il spare you the details. I\u2019ve since done it three more times,\nmostly because we have identified various people and we\u2019re currently waiting to see whether this\nyear\u2019s nominees were elected or not. The trip to Berlin was interesting to me also because I\nwanted to meet this German historian who is also interested in the six week occupation. It turns\nout he was conceived during that occupation of an American and a German mother. That\u2019s his\nmotivation. And he doesn\u2019t speak much English. He has since discovered his American father\nand has been accepted by the family in Ohio or wherever. Still doesn\u2019t speak much English.\nBut he has been very helpful in taking me sightseeing to pieces of Berlin that I would not have\nseen otherwise and obviously is of a different generation.",
        "Q: Do you think you would be a different person today if you hadn\u2019t gone through the childhood\nthat you had living through Nazi, the beginnings of Nazi Germany, having to leave your home\ncountry?",
        "A: Yes. I can, I can tell because my sister being three years younger and married to an American\nwith three American, California born kids, knows about American childhood, rhymes, stories,\nanecdotes. I, not having kids, and being just a bit older. Oh I vaguely know who Old Mother\nHubbard was but not really. In that sense I am not fully assimilated. You asked me, would I be\ndifferent. Yes. I would be different but I didn\u2019t have that kind of childhood or experiences.",
        "Q: I also meant psychological, in background knowledge, right. But psychologically do you\nthink \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: Yes, I still have certain German habits, customs that, the way I was brought up is, emphasizes\ndeferred gratification. Maybe fewer white lies, maybe too much adherence to telling the truth,\neven when it\u2019s, when it shouldn\u2019t be told. Now my wife taught me an awful lot and certainly has\nAmericanized me. I think that\u2019s as far as I can go.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about being Jewish? Did you, you didn\u2019t realize it until you were\nolder. Have you become more Jewish or \u2014",
        "A: I have for the past dozen years or so longer than that. My wife. Been very active in doing\nfamily history, genealogy. My wife teased me. Until I started compiling her family history which\nis quite limited of course because eastern resources are. But I discovered a cousin of hers who\nhad fled the Soviet Union, lived in Germany. I corresponded with that cousin who said oh, you\nSherry have an uncle in Leningrad, whereupon we took a Baltic cruise. First lined up a local\nrecent immigrant who made a phone call to the uncle in Leningrad. And basically arranged that\nwe would meet in Leningrad when our ship stopped there. The uncle imported a cousin of\nSherry\u2019s who lived in Moscow. A retired teacher of English who had never been in an English\nspeaking country to serve as interpreter. In short my wife has forgiven me my interest in\nfamilies. I\u2019m being glib of course.\nWhy did I engage in what is clearly unequivocally Jewish family history. I learned a whole lot\nabout my ancestors, who spoke probably western Yiddish who are clearly were observant. I had\na great grandfather who was a either a parnas [ph] or but it\u2019s all historical interest. It doesn\u2019t do\nanything for me. In the emotional Jewish sense. I am ethnically Jewish as non-observant as can\nbe. The only time I go to a synagogue 1s for weddings or funerals. Hans has forgiven me but\nclearly that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about Israel? Do you feel a connection?",
        "A: That\u2019s an awkward question or an awkward answer. I keep thinking the Jewish claim to\nPalestine, to Israel, is a little bit like are we ready to give America back to the Indians. They did,\nI\u2019m conflicted obviously. I am not a Zionist. I am vaguely pro-Israel but it\u2019s a tenuous\nconnection.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "Q: Have you been there?",
        "A: We have been there twice but not, but superficially. We took Mediterranean cruises and the\nship docked in Haifa and we had 36 hours. I walked the stations of the cross in Jerusalem\nbecause the fellow passengers were Protestants. My wife had a non-cousin in Haifa I think and\nvisited him. My wife had a much more traditional Jewish upbringing. She belonged to B\u2019Nai\nBrith youth and no Hillel youth, but I don\u2019t want to put words in her mouth but I think she kind\nof saw marrying me as a liberating experience. Part of it may of course have been simply loyalty\nto a marriage and I don't know. But she certainly adjusted more to my way of life and thinking\nthan I adjusted to hers.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial?",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure I had any. But he\u2019s an SOB and he had it coming. I mean, that simple.",
        "Q: When the news came out after the war and the liberation of the camps and the terrible\nphotographs and films, did that \u2014",
        "A: There but for the grace of God go I. Of course, of course. I certainly internalized that. I am\nvery conscious of the fact that thanks to an American great grandfather and thus an American\ngrandmother and thus extended family in California, my life became a whole lot better, in part\nalso because I didn\u2019t get hung up on the east coast in New York. There is nothing with New\nYork and there is nothing wrong with, but I\u2019m glad I grew up in San Francisco where in a\nmoment of weakness of course, I can claim to be a fourth generation Californian.",
        "Q: Do you still get restitution, reparations I meant?",
        "A: My mother was unhappy because she never collected the monthly \u2014",
        "Q: She never did.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: No, she somehow or other fell between the cracks. No, we collected on the house and its\nforced sale. And on things like that. And I got a very modest restitution for my sister and for\nmyself for interrupted education. Parenthetically, she collected more than I did because I was\nhell bent to get a PhD and she took her own sweet time to get a master\u2019s. But those are the\naberrations or idiosyncrasies of laws enacted.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t get monthly reparations?",
        "A: Oh it didn\u2019t amount to all that much. But we were poor struggling graduate students and every\nlittle bit was welcomed. I have uncovered a couple of dormant Swiss accounts. Because I\npursue that kind of stuff. And I tipped off a cousin in Connecticut who collected far more than I\ndid but she had wealthier relatives. And tipped off a cousin in Florida who failed to follow\nthrough. It has been ongoing but nobody in my immediate family ever collected monthly\npayment. No these were always rather small lump sums.",
        "Q: Do you feel lessons have been learned from the Holocaust? That the world has --",
        "A: Who is the learner? I mean we\u2019re supposed to have learned. As far as the Germans are\nconcerned, I am persuaded that they are trying to do the right thing and are doing the right thing.\nSometimes I even worry that the, maybe going too far in outgoing any kind of a protest but that\u2019s\ntheir problem, not mine. Yes, the Germans have learned their lesson I think. Who else is\nsupposed to have learned? The Austrians certainly not. They\u2019re opportunists. I happen to have\nAustrian Jewish neighbors. He was much younger than I was when they came here. He\u2019s fully,\nfar more Americanized than Iam. And we sometimes make our unkind remarks about Austrian\nopportunism. I assume you\u2019re familiar with the story. Who else is supposed to have learned\nfrom the Holocaust?",
        "Q: The world in general.",
        "A: Sorry I draw a blank.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC? Being built in\nWashington?",
        "A: Im glad it\u2019s there. I\u2019m glad it includes the Roma. I have been there. I have enjoyed is not\nthe right word, the exhibits. In fact the last time I was there, I was reminded, it is my life d\u00e9ja vu\nall over again. The exhibits are awe inspiring. In a way I\u2019m glad that it\u2019s just off the Mall.\nPeriod.",
        "Q: Because, why do you say that?",
        "A: The Mall should be American patriotic. Just like Martin Luther King is just a little bit off in\npart because the Mall is more or less full. But. (pause) It\u2019s only in a limited sense the American\nexperience. Therefore it\u2019s entirely suitable but maybe off the Mall.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you would want to say before we close, anything else you want to add?",
        "A: I should add something about my military experience which obviously is a major event in my\nlife. Iam glad I went was sent to the European theater. It was a very meaningful experience. I\ndon\u2019t want to call it an emotional experience but it and I don\u2019t want to call it vengeance either.\nBut I was clear what the war was about and I was glad to be doing it. Something towards it. I am\namazed with hindsight and I was in a small outfit, 160 men. How fully accepted I was. That\nthey never to my knowledge had any doubts. They weren\u2019t that conscious of the difference\nbetween Jewish and non-Jewish. The, I was fully accepted.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about the men in your outfit?",
        "A: Oh yes, my fellow troopers. And of course I was more pivotal than most others because I\nspoke French and I spoke German. And I knew all kinds of local things that turned out to be\nuseful. I could translate the sign that said Achtung Menin [ph] So I just want to add that was a\nmeaningful experience and I\u2019m glad I was in it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nThe experience in military government after the end of the war was also meaningful. First of all\nit certainly enhanced my vocabulary to do de-Nazification questionnaires you had to enlarge\nyour vocabulary and your view of the world. I also, it also refreshed my memories. One reason\nwhy I am probably better able to remember things during an interview like this than others 1s\nbecause I had a refresher course at age 20, 21 which living in an environment that evoked all\nkinds of things that \u2019d forgotten or would have forgotten. And once again the influence of my\nwife is massive. Period. Positive, obviously.",
        "Q: Do you feel German in any way?",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure I understand the question probably because I can\u2019t answer it. Part of me says\nhell no. And part of me says well of course. That\u2019s where I was born. That\u2019s how I spent the first\n13 years of my life or 12 years. I had my father certainly wasn\u2019t Americanized. My mother\nbecame quite thoroughly Americanized and learned to speak excellent English. Well she lived\nwithin walking distance of her grandchildren and she became a surrogate mother to the\ngrandchildren who to this day think very highly of her. Well she had a house with a pool in Los\nAngeles. The, but my mother was German. And expected me to, I was expected to write home\nin the army, after the war, regularly, often. And I would get a letter back, punctually. That simple\nwas a given.",
        "Q: Were those letters always in German? To her and back to you?",
        "A: Ohno. No, no. In English. Well mine had to be in English because they were subject to\ncensorship.",
        "Q: Oh, to censorship.",
        "A: Well not after the end of hostilities of course. But I\u2019d have to look. My mother\u2019s letters\nalmost certainly were in English by then.",
        "Q: Did you talk to your mother in English or in German?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: We spoke English almost from day one in this country. Obviously not. We had to speak\nGerman because we didn\u2019t know enough English but we were hell bent to become Americans\nand assimilate and learn English which in the case of my sister and me was happened not\novernight, but very quickly. And in the case of my mother we increasingly spoke to her in\nEnglish. We had no intention of going back. This was in the day when it took a week on a\nsteamer and no, we didn\u2019t want to go back. Of course I went back within five years but \u2014",
        "Q: Did your mother ever go back to visit?",
        "A: Oh my mother went back at least twice. My aunt Nellie died too soon. She didn\u2019t go back.\nMarianne didn\u2019t go back and my grandmother also, she died in 49, much too soon to go back.",
        "Q: Did you lose any extended members of your family in the Holocaust?",
        "A: Extended, yes but not immediate family. Well because I do family history I have of course I\nmean I have several thousand names and there are lots and lots of victims. But in terms of people\nthat I knew personally, there was a classmate of my father\u2019s who\u2019s also a distant relative who\ncommitted suicide in Los Angeles because he found out that his nieces and nephews had been\ndeported. There was a cousin who of all things was the equivalent of a county judge, not I mean\nhe was a judge but not, who was killed or his wife was killed. I don\u2019t remember now. One of\nthem died of natural causes about that time. I think 1t was his wife and she\u2019s the relative as\nopposed to the judge. But this is extended family. Of all the people that I knew I literally can\u2019t\nthink of one.",
        "Q: When you meet someone from Germany, a Jew of your generation or, do you ever talk about\nyour childhoods or do you not dwell on that?",
        "A: Well as I told you, Herman came out of a PW cage. This was September 1945. The war\nended in May. We explored the neighborhood together and we did it amicably, successfully and\nnostalgically. He told me that his, he was a lieutenant. His company commander who was a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\ncaptain was a guy who lived across the street, and he was four years older than we were. And he\nwas killed. He, period, paragraph. My wife and I went back and visited Herman and his wife.\nThis must have been my wife died 14 years ago so I tend to time everything before and after.\nThis must have been 18, 20 years ago. And it was a very good visit. He and his wife and my\nwife and I took a trip out in the country and we visited a ruined castle on a mountaintop because\nHerman and I had bicycled there in a one day trip. And we were all staggered that we had\nmanaged to do that at the age of 12, 13. But these are selective. When I visited, oh the city of\nStuttgart had a program to invite its former citizens. My wife was by then too ill to travel and so\nmy sister and I and her husband went whenever. And I was interviewed and there was a story in\nthe newspaper with my picture, whereupon there promptly was a phone call from a former\nclassmate in the hotel who\u2019d like to get together with me. Well he was one of those I did not\nwish to get reacquainted with. He was the cousin of one of the guys who had followed me during\nthe soccer game. Now blood 1s thicker than water. He was a cousin so maybe he was less\nenthusiastic and less nasty but I chose not to tell him off, not to do anything. I just not to get\nreacquainted. Does that illustrate. In 1945 probably during that same visit with Herman, I\nremember walking past the house where the teacher lived who had made that precipitating\nremark and there was the doorbell and there was his name. Should I break his goddamn\nwindows. No. I chose to ignore him. So I don\u2019t remember exactly what your question was but\nmy feelings are very clearly no, I do not want to exact revenge. I merely want to take advantage\nof whatever present memories I have.",
        "Q: Well that\u2019s a good note to end on.",
        "A: I thank you. I hope I have contributed something.",

        "A: He was leather wholesaler jobber. The name of the business was Weil and Arnstein and it\nwas established by my grandfather.

        "A: In the heart of the city, not downtown but in, my father bought a four story building before he\ngot married and we lived on the second floor and there were tenants on the other three floors.",
        "A: No, she did not. That\u2019s not quite true. She went to an arts and crafts school and when she was\nsingle she worked in a porcelain painting factory. Factory is an exaggeration. And after she got\nmarried, I owned two pieces with her initials LA Lisa Arnstein. And I owned one piece signed\nLW, Lisa Weil. That she did work but not after she was married.",
        "A: Yes.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: Yes, we had a full time live in maid until the Nuremberg laws of 1935 and then we had part\ntime help.",
        "A: German and I even spoke the local dialect when I played soccer with the kids or the boys but\nat the dinner table we were expected to speak reasonably correct German. My parents cautiously\nspoke French when they didn\u2019t want the children to understand whatever it is they were talking\nabout. Later they switched to English. My father spoke both languages better than my mother,\nnot terribly well but better.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how to answer that. Yes, I liked to think I was independent but on the other hand\nup to the age of 13 or 14 you are necessarily dependent and in our home, my father made the\ndecisions. That does not mean he disregarded my mother, but he clearly was in charge. He is the\none who decided that I would attend a secondary school known as a gymnasium where one of\nthe foreign languages was Latin. And as he said, in my day we had to take Latin and Greek.",
        "A: Within walking distance there was an elementary school with two wings. One wing, the larger\nwas Protestant. The other wing, smaller, was Catholic. I attended the Protestant wing. I could\nhave been excused from religious instruction which was part of the curriculum. I was not and I\nattended and to this day I remember some Protestant catechism.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nIt was within walking distance. It was a public school, strangely enough, co-educational. There\nwere 20 boys and ten girls. And I have a photograph taken in third grade or second grade. And I\nused to say I can still recall the names. Not true.",
        "A: Ethnically Jewish, religiously no.",
        "A: My father had a slightly younger brother named Ernest, which is why I\u2019m named George\nErnest who apparently was quite enterprising. He broke his neck skiing in the Italian Alps at age\n17, 18, something like that which meant that my grandfather had to decide on a burial plot to\nbury Uncle Ernest whom I never knew of course. And he picked a plot in the Protestant section\nof the cemetery. Not the Jewish section. I cite that as an example.\nAnd that, of course, it\u2019s then where my grandfather was buried in the family plot. So was my\nmaternal grandfather. That it\u2019s an indirect answer to your question.",
        "A: Absolutely not. I did not know where the synagogue was. There were three words which I\nassumed to be German and in fact they mostly are. One was schlemiel, and the other one was\nplite [ph] which means bankrupt but it 1s so part of the German language. Anyway I did not\nknow those were Jewish words. Oy, well there was once in the edition, there was instant Yiddish.",
        "A: No, not until the Nazis came to power.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: Well, yes. It didn\u2019t matter.",
        "A: No but I do remember after the Nazis came to power, about 1935 my sister and I went to\nGelingen [ph] which 1s a village not far from Stuttgart where there was a Jewish training center,\npresumably preparing people for Palestine. And all I remember from that 1s that I did not like the\ntaste of horseradish and that is all I remember.",
        "A: Oh we played soccer, we went bicycling. I was one of the boys and \u2014",
        "A: Oh I remember the first two books I owned. One was in German of course, Classical\nmythology. In a version which 1s kind of poetic. It 1s so good that it has, that version has been\ntranslated into English and published in the United States. By an author named Schwab, S-C-H-\nW-A-B. Ihave fond memories of that. And the other book was in German, Ein Come from\nRome [ph] , a battle for Rome. It deals basically with the invasion of the Goths, the, and of\ncourse, I identified with the Goths, the victorious Goths. I still remember those two books were\na present from a cousin from Nuremberg.",
        "A: It was not a question that arose. So they may have been but I didn\u2019t know. That changed of\ncourse after the noose tightened. But no, there was a cousin named Uncle Emil who owned the\nfactory and he arrived with a black chauffeur driven limousine but it was an Opel. It wasn\u2019t even\na Mercedes. I mean it, he was, he existed but didn\u2019t particularly think about it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: First of all nothing changed in, among the boys in my neighborhood. We continued to play\nsoccer and we continued, this was before bicycles. We had scooters but then gradually. Nothing\nhappened in any significant way until the Nuremberg laws which meant that we could no longer\nhave a full time housekeeper and that probably led to an explanation by my parents that we were\ndifferent.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: The other significant thing is there was a cousin in Munich. This must have been a couple of\nyears later. Her name was Marianne. She was engaged to a gentile Bavarian who was terrific.\nHe, they took me skiing. They owned a small Fiat. At the age of 12 on country roads, I was\nallowed to drive. So no wonder I think well of him. And they of course, she converted to\nCatholicism. She became a Catholic, a convert. It didn\u2019t do any good and moved to Stuttgart and\nbecame kind of an older sister to us, or she was appreciably older but she became part of our\nhousehold and most significantly she owned a car and we were mechanized for the first time. I\ncite this only as a reasonably vivid recollection of the influence of the Nuremberg laws and the\nrealization that we were different and Marianne was different.\nThe other significant difference is that swimming pools started to have signs saying no Jews\nallowed. And \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: Yes. Exactly when and how that happened, I don\u2019t recall but I was different and the\ndifference was Jewish ethnicity.",
        "A: Not particularly. The, my fellow soccer players didn\u2019t treat me any differently. My fellow\nbicyclists who were the same thing, the same group.",
        "A: That is a precipitated cause. Easter 1938 I had not done my homework or I was late for class\nor some minor offense like that and the home room teacher took me to task and said George, or\nGeorg of course, you who are a guest in this country. And that, that scored. I remember it today.\nMy father had offered me earlier, had raised the question didn\u2019t I want to transfer and go to\nschool in Geneva, 1n Switzerland. Where there were family friends with a son my age who were\ngoing to look after me. Easter 38 I went home and I told my father I\u2019m ready to go to Geneva.\nAnd that was the precipitating trivial incident. There are a couple of others.\nWe played soccer as part of the gym class at school, secondary school. And typically you were \u2014",
        "A: Gymnasium.",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall. Yes, it was Protestant. The Catholics may have been excused. I can only\nremember one other Jewish boy at that point and I still know his name. He was the son of a \u2014 and\nto my knowledge he\u2019s a, an emeritus professor at the University of Michigan or Michigan state.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",

        "A: And he left before me.",
        "A: I was literally the last one. What I was getting at 1s the soccer teams were chosen either by\nheight or in turn. And I was number 11 or number 12 1n size and when the teams were chosen, I\nwas also chosen, something like 11\" or 12\". That\u2019s significant. There are 11 soccer players to a\nside. But the point I\u2019m getting at is there were two guys who basically deliberately followed me.\nAnd the teacher, alias umpire, didn\u2019t see it. Again, trivial but you were asking for examples and\nthose are the only --",
        "A: Oh, no, no ignored it.",

        "A: Those are about the only incidents I can remember.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: Oh yes, of course. You know for example, my father being the owner of the building, was\nexpected to fly a flag prominently on patriotic occasions and he chose the local colors, provincial\ncolors which were red and black, the city colors were black and yellow. But not the swastika and\nnot black, white and red which were the alternate national colors. And we got away with it.",
        "A: On his flag? Black and red. The provincial colors.",
        "A: Two stripes, yes. No, no not remotely black white and red. Parenthetically my father had\nserved in World War I the full four years. He was promoted from approximately corporal and\nmade lieutenant. He was wounded twice. I don\u2019t know how badly. He had impaired, what 1s it\ncalled, taste buds but no other evidence of permanent damage. He had medals. He wore them\nonce and put them away in the drawer. I saw them once. In fact I still own them. But he was not\nterribly patriotic. And there are two explanations for that. His mother, my grandmother was born\nin San Francisco. So he had -- she came to Stuttgart at age 12 more or less. Her English was\nthere but not fluent. Nevertheless that made a difference. He, she was one of six sisters, three of\nthem married Germans. But one married a Frenchman, one married an Englishman. So my\nfather had first cousins in London. He had first, a first cousin in Paris which is how he spent a\nyear there learning English and learning French, which also probably explains why he was less\npatriotic than one would think of a German lieutenant.\nWhile we\u2019re on that theme let\u2019s finish it. After Kristallnacht the night of broken glass, I was in\nGeneva. I only read about it. He was arrested the following morning. He was sent to the local\npolice station, our part of town, told to empty his pockets and what came out among other things\nwas orders for reserve lieutenant Arnstein to report for either a physical exam or I don\u2019t\nremember those detail. It didn\u2019t do any good. He still wound up at Dachau. But as long as we\nwere on the military theme I thought I\u2019d include that. Kind of confusing. Enemy of the state and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: I was one of the boys. I went along with it. I vaguely remember that Hitler came through town\nand there was a parade of \u2014 it was within walking distance of home and I think I stood in the\naudience and watched it. That doesn\u2019t mean I approved or even saluted with \u2014",
        "A: Well. First of all you have to realize the newspapers and everything else were now\ncoordinated and spoke with a single voice of enthusiasm. I knew my father listened to radio\nStrasbourg which broadcast in French and in German. Deliberately. I also knew that this was\neither illegal but anyway one didn\u2019t talk about it. So in that sense I became politically aware.\nBut what did Hitler mean to me. Oh he was going to build the autobahn and good heavens that\nwas three years away. Didn\u2019t mean all that much.",
        "A: No, except well yes. Going back to the building and symbols. The socialists also had a\nsymbol, not the swastika of course but three parallel arrows and I remember three arrows were\npainted on our sidewalk. Which meant the following morning somebody had to scrub and\nremove them. There was an annual winter relief drive where they collected nowadays we\u2019d\ncollect canned goods, but in those days it was clothing and things like that. That used to be done\nby the army. It was now being done by brown shirted storm troopers. So there were changes and\nthere is that terrible word which I don\u2019t know how to translate and I don\u2019t think anybody else\ndoes either. Gleich Schaltung.[ph] which kind of means coordination, coordination,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\npenetration, where everything was made over and the example of the winter relief drive is an\nexample. It used to be the army and theoretically neutral and now it became storm troopers.\nGleich Schaltung spelled G-L-E-I-C-H one word. S-C-H-A-L-T-U-N-G. I do not know how to\ntranslate it. So these are \u2014",
        "A: No I was not particularly fearful, mostly because my playmates, my fellow bicyclists et\ncetera, one, he died only eight years ago and I\u2019d been in touch with him for 70 years. His name\nwas Herman. His father was a minor government official. He joined the junior version of the\nHitler Youth. He then join -- well I wasn\u2019t there when he joined the senior version and he\nbecame a lieutenant in the German army. And I looked him up at the end of the war when I was a\nGI. And he had just been discharged from an American POW cage. So we explored our old\nneighborhood together. (Laughs) He had been gone and I had been gone.",
        "A: That is what I\u2019m getting at. He, I think offered to have me join his troop or something like\nthat. And of course I wasn\u2019t eligible, but sure, they had uniforms and they did all kinds of\nexciting things. The school year had changed from five and a half days of school Saturday\nmorning, to five days of school. No more school on Saturdays, but the Hitler Youth people above\nall organized by the school there were excursions, hikes and things like that. And of course the\nHitler Youth boys showed up in uniform and we did not. We didn\u2019t have a uniform.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember but there were some non-members of the Hitler Youth who were also in my\nschool or in my class. So there were some of us were different, not necessarily Jewish. As I say,\nI was the only one in my class. Ted was, I think, a year behind me.\nI also remember one incident where Herman and I were going a block or two away, possibly on\nour scooters and ran into a couple of other boys who started making anti-Semitic remarks like oh\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nyou can smell a Jew a mile away and this and that. And Herman would knowing full well that I\nwas Jewish which I realize contradicts some of my earlier comments, kind of goaded them on\ninto saying oh we can smell one. We can see one. They\u2019re different and all that, knowing all the\ntime that this was obviously preposterous. That\u2019s as close as I could come to incidents.",
        "A: Except for the following of, during the soccer game and oh there was one other guy in my\nclass, big not very bright, who I think kind of wrestled with me once and but I ascribe that to\nstupidity rather than, than ordinary malice.",
        "A: I do not recall. So I\u2019m tempted to say no we didn\u2019t. Well they were not willing to face up to\nthe fact that the noose was tightening. They felt this was a temporary difficulty but my father did\ngo to the \u2014 Oh two things.\nMy American born grandmother lost her citizenship when she married my grandfather who was\na Bavarian local well established.",
        "A: US citizenship. Then she was widowed. And in 1933 my father said to her, why don\u2019t you\ngo to New York and reclaim your citizenship. Her sister in Nuremberg similarly widowed and\nsituated went with her. And the two ladies spent six weeks in New York. I have a report from a\ndistant relative who claims he invoked the help of Senator Wagner. That\u2019s senior. I don\u2019t know\nhow true that is, but maybe he, anyway they reclaimed their citizenship. And thus my\ngrandmother and her sister are both natural born and naturalized American citizens, which\nhelped certainly. Well it tells you something about my father\u2019s attitude.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: It also meant because I had relatives in the San Francisco Bay area who had not returned to\nGermany when the time came to get an affidavit of support, and assume you know that we would\nnot become public charges, my grandmother got in touch with her genuine first cousin. In other\nwords they had common grandparents and who supplied the affidavit which was rejected by the\nAmerican counsel in Stuttgart, on the grounds that the cousin in San Francisco was too old.\nThereupon the cousin\u2019s daughter co-signed and that made it legitimate. So all of this shows that\nmy parents, or my father who certainly were aware of the tightening noose but didn\u2019t want to\nface up to the fact that it was more than a temporary condition.",
        "A: No, no change whatsoever. They were treated well.",
        "A: She then had temporary not live in help after the Nuremberg laws forbade because all Jewish\nmen lusted after gentile girls or young women. So that was the assumption so you couldn\u2019t have\na full time live in help but you could have part time.",
        "A: I said I\u2019m ready to go to Geneva which of course represented some financial problems\nbecause there were financial controls. German Jews could not dispose of their money freely.\nThey had to petition for not for internal household expenses, but for foreign expenses. Or\nunusual expenses, like buying real estate or that kind of stuff. I\u2019m not quite up to date, up to date.\nI don\u2019t remember that clearly because after all money was not discussed with the children. But so\nwithin two weeks, I transferred, as I recall. Very quickly I transferred to Geneva. Where my\nfriend Roget the son of these family friends, introduced me to the Coloure Saint Antoine [ph]\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nwhere I was in the seisieme and they were ahead of us in Latin. Also scenes of Gallic wars but\nthey were further along than we were and in some other area like arithmetic or geometry, they\nwere, that was hard. I don\u2019t remember those details either. But above all I flunked the seisieme.\nAnd of all things to flunk, I flunked German because I couldn\u2019t translate it into French and vice\nversa. So when I repeated seisieme in the fall, I did much better. And by early December I left.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: That may have been the depression rather than \u2014 he gave up his business in 1929 or\nthereabouts and went to work for a leather and shoe factory in the suburbs. I have since\nrecovered some of this information because the grandson of the owner of the shoe factory\npublished the memoirs of his grandfather. All of this was in the past year. And I have some of\nthe details wrong. But he had a good job with this shoe factory, probably as the, the leather\nbuyer or I don\u2019t know that. What I do remember is it was still dark and a winter night at 7:30 in\nthe morning when he joined a car pool. A car pool, probably he, the brother of the owner who\nhad a car and they drove out to the suburbs to go to work. But that somehow or other sticks in\nmy memory.\nBut by the time the Nazis came to power, maybe the factory ran into problems. I don\u2019t know. He\nreestablished his business on a minor scale. Instead of having a separate office and storage\nfacility he operated out of his mother\u2019s, my grandmother\u2019s apartment where he had an office. My\naunt, his sister, unmarried was kind of secretary. And I don\u2019t know those details because money\nbusiness was not discussed in front of the children. Our life style as far as I can tell did not\nchange appreciably.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nsaid that you really didn\u2019t experience, aside from the soccer game and so forth, much anti-\nSemitism.",
        "A: It must have been a maturation, a realization of gradually increasing obnoxiousness, it was, I\nobviously it is a trivial incident to \u2014 that did it.",
        "A: 13. It was quite difficult which is why I turned it down in 1937 when my father first offered it.\nOn the other hand, I did know the family friends in Geneva who did a very nice competent job of\nkind of looking after me. I lived in a boarding house.",
        "A: The answer is no but for the purposes of, of emigration, I had a imitation password, passport\nwhich I still have. It basically is an identification sheet which says this serves in lieu of a\npassport for purposes \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They had passports and when the law went into effect that all Jews had to take middle names.\nNamely my father did not become Arnold Israel because he had a passport which did not expire\nfor another two years. My mother had to renew her passport and she became Elizabeth Sara. I\nstill have both passports. So and I still have the imitation identification paper for purposes. I\nguess I had to have it in order to go to Switzerland.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: I was gone by then. And not only that. In 19, well this is probably also pertinent. Every\nsummer we went away for a nearby summer vacation. Black Forest or that kind of thing. In\n1933 we went to Fronten [ph] which is in the Bavarian, in Bavaria close to the Austrian border.\nIn 1934 Hitler had imposed a thousand mark duty if you wanted to cross over from Germany into\nAustria. In an attempt to of course choke it off. And that was our last summer in Bavaria. Then\nwe Started going to Switzerland for summer vacations. But I remember that very vividly, how the\nchange was from one year to the next. We could go into Austria one year. And then no longer.\nAustria being a piddling distance away.\nSo the change of going to Switzerland was fairly significant in the sense my father wanted to\nread different newspapers. He wanted to but there were financial controls which made it possible\nbut difficult to go abroad for vacations.",
        "A: Yes, also when I think back on it. This is speculation. I\u2019m the first born. My father may have\nbeen, wanted to save his first born. This is speculation. She was three years younger, blond, blue\neyed. To the point where my mother went to her school once and the principal asked her are you\nsure that he that he is the father. Actually my sister looks enough like other family members that\nthere\u2019s no doubt but \u2014 Blond blue eyed and had, well I can\u2019t say I had difficulties because I was\nbrown and had brown eyes and brown hair.",
        "A: No because there is an odd variation. Our appointment at the American consulate to be\ninterviewed for the visa was December second 1938. I was in Geneva. I came home for that,\nhome, returned to Stuttgart, for that weekend so I could go to the American consulate and be\ninterviewed and then I went back to Geneva. And I knew that was the final visit to Stuttgart. But\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nI knew I was going to see my parents in another month because we met in Paris and, and\nembarked on Christmas eve 1938.",
        "A: I read about it. I knew about it. Somehow or other I never made the connection that my father\nwould be one of those arrested.",
        "A: The friends who looked, kind of looked after me in Geneva, were told by my mother and\nwere told not to tell me. So I didn\u2019t find out til I reported to Stuttgart for the interview at the\nconsulate where I encountered my father who was a mess. He was, I mean he was a broken man\npsychologically, possibly more than physically.",
        "A: Three weeks. They had far more inmates than they had planned on so and the only thing that\nI remember his ever talking about was he survived better because he had been 1n the German\narmy and the guards of course were also veterans or, so he knew how to behave. Maybe and this\nis speculation, he got a little bit more respect because the Germans are very fussy in making\ndistinctions between civilian life, military service, combat service. They make the distinction.\nIt\u2019s very important to have been a front line combatant rather than in the supply corps. And he\nhad been a combatant so that got him brownie points.",
        "A: Well\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: After all I lived with him for two years in San Francisco where he was, where he felt terribly\nd\u00e9class\u00e9 and poor, dependent. And irritable. And in bad health. I do not know to this day\nwhether he died of stomach cancer or stomach --",
        "A: Ulcers. I don\u2019t know. Possibly both.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Well I spent 48 hours, maybe 72 hours there. And visited my grandmothers, two\ngrandmothers and the family and maybe childhood friends, but those were \u2014",
        "A: The synagogue was on the other side of town. I mean there, that was not part of my ambit. I\nmay have seen some broken windows in the department store, but that may be a retroactive\nimagination. I do not know.",
        "A: For three weeks.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: Met my parents in Paris on \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes. In some ways I was quite independent in terms of \u2014",
        "A: When I returned from Geneva to Stuttgart in order to go to the consulate, I bought the ticket,\nor maybe they bought it for me and I was supposed to go from Geneva to Zurich to Calzoo [ph]\nand change there to an express to Stuttgart. Well wise guy George when he got through Calzoo\nfigured out that there was a semi express which left earlier and would get to Stuttgart half an\nhour earlier. So I took it of course. My mother traveled to Calzoo in order to meet me and\nintercept me so that was a disaster but it\u2019s evidence or example of my independence. So yes,\ntraveling from Geneva to Paris on my own at age \u2014",
        "A: Barely 14 yes. And by that time I spoke reasonably fluent French so nothing to it.",
        "A: We only spent three days in Paris, where we had relatives.",
        "A: I think my Aunt Nellie was part of the package too. Single, sister of my father, unmarried.\nAnd we, Paris was quite meaningful because the cousin who had given me my first two books\nfrom Nuremberg, and they had emigrated in 1933 to Paris and were completely assimilated, at\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nleast to my outsider\u2019s view. And that was quite an interesting experience. We had probably\nChristmas dinner with them, although they all were converts to Catholicism. And all of the\ndescendants are Catholic. I have them in my family tree but we, they do not wish to maintain\ncontact. I\u2019m not being critical. I\u2019m merely noting. So those were three days in Paris, interesting.\nBecause I spoke French, I was probably more important to my parents than \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure she did well. She certainly adjusted in San Francisco faster than any of us. She went\nto elementary school and junior high but then she also is a much more sensitive or was in terms\nof inter personal relations than I am so she adjusted better.",
        "A: Three days in Paris 1s not enough to notice or remember. And in Switzerland of course I\ntended to associate with people who were anti-Fascist to use a__ term.",
        "A: Probably but I can\u2019t answer for sure.",
        "A: The very fact that my father listened to radio Strasbourg tells you something about, oh and he\nhad a one close friend, maybe even two and they went to the Salon of then, and they talked\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\npolitics and smoked cigars. And I wasn\u2019t supposed to know about that and but I certainly did\nknow that it was subversive if you wish.",
        "A: Oh yes. And the two friends in particular that I remember. One was an artist, a painter. In fact\nI have two of his paintings in my living room. He went to Buenos Aires where he died. My wife\nand I visited him 20 years ago. And the other one was a newspaper reporter and I don\u2019t know\nwhat happened to him.",
        "A: Yes, I mentioned that the swimming pools had signs saying no Jews allowed. The public\ncomfort stations had signs and our parents would come to stand guard if we had to go. And the,\nacross the street there was a baker. A bakery with a cafe, two entrances. I think both posted the\nsign no Jews wanted or allowed, but the delivery boy continued to deliver the rolls in the\nmorning.",
        "A: To us. In other words, business was more important than ideology. We never felt, in the\nneighborhood, we never felt it.",
        "A: Any threats or anti-Semitism that I can recall.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know of any other Jews in the neighborhood. Well there was a, around the corner\nthere was a tobacco store, a tobacconist and the owners were Jewish, which I didn\u2019t know. Not\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nonly that. I think they were Polish Jews. And it embarrasses me to say this today but Polish Jews\nwere different. You know Hans Hirsch. Hans and I got in a discussion, disagreement when I told\nhim, yes I have since found out there was a Stuttgart chapter of B\u2019Nai Brith and it had a clause\nsaying no Polish Jews admitted or wanted. And he said oh no you\u2019re wrong. So we pulled down\nthe book that, I was right. It\u2019s probably the only time in my life that Hans was wrong.",
        "A: Yes there probably was some nostalgia but I cannot answer the question for sure. I\u2019ve been\nback several times since then and yes, this was home and it feels quite comfortable and homey in\nsome ways. Because all of the traces of the nastiness have been erased. How I felt at the time of\nleaving I can\u2019t answer that question either, how I felt.",
        "A: My parents arranged for a so called lift which is a massive container to store the furniture to\nbe shipped, furniture, linens et cetera. It never arrived in San Francisco, even though it was\nprepaid and insured. My mother established photo albums when I was born and a separate\nalbum when my sister was born. She had the wit to shove those in the suitcase and they, I own\nmine to this day. My sister owned, well her kids own it to this day. And I had occasion to use it\njust a couple of days ago but yes.",
        "A: That is again difficult to answer because my grandmother\u2019s lift, household container, was also\nlost. Also prepaid. My Aunt Nellie, single unmarried sister of my father, her lift came. Well\nbecause she\u2019s unmarried, she lived with her mother, my grandmother. To this day I have\ninherited a few things that go back to my grandmother and I sometimes fail to make the\ndistinction whether it was my home or hers. There is a certain continuity. And that is how I own\ntwo pictures, two paintings by this artist who was a friend of my father\u2019s.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: Can we stop at this point?",
        "A: Christmas Eve, 24\" of December, 1938. And we landed in New York on the second of\nJanuary 1939. The crossing was, there was one thing worth mentioning, in my opinion. There\nwere lots of other German and Austrian refugees. And I think at age 14, I mightily flirted with a\ngirl and I remember my parents\u2019 displeasure because she was not of the proper class. It\u2019s trivial\nand I don\u2019t mean to suggest that they in any way said oh you may not speak to her or anything\nlike that. I just felt a slight \u2014",
        "A: Yes.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: But Austrian. I mean there were both German and Austrian but this particular girl \u2014",
        "A: No. Or marginally. But following on that question, we were hung up in New York for six\nweeks, because of an idiosyncrasy of the German currency regulations. You could prepay your\nvoyage to San Francisco in German marks, provided it was by ship. You could not go by rail.\nWe were prepaid to San Francisco and then the American company would not recognize the\nticket. And so we spent six weeks in New York and then they relented on a winter luxury cruise\nthat was not sold out, from New York to Havana. To Panama, to Acapulco, to Los Angeles, to\nSan Francisco. We were in a third class cabin but these cruises give you the run of the ship and it\nwas an unlikely beginning. And I remember it did not have an outdoor pool. It had an indoor\npool. They built an outdoor pool by throwing together some wooden frame and lining it with a\ncanvas.\nAnd to this day I remember crossing the Panama Canal, floating in this outdoor pool and saying\nif I ever amount to something, I would like to do this again, which my wife and I did some 25\nyears ago. Not in a canvas covered pool. Sorry that\u2019s a detour but hung up in New York, I\nactually enrolled in public school number 12345, in the eighth grade which I flunked because I\ndidn\u2019t know enough English. I was farmed out to some relatives who had emigrated earlier than\nwe did. And lived in Jack, not in Jackson Heights. In the part of Manhattan that there \u2014",
        "A: Washington Heights, thank you. Also known as Frankfurt on the Hudson. Where first of all I\nlearned some English and they were very helpful and they had been my parents\u2019 bridge partners\nin Stuttgart. I mean this was a close relationship. The thing I remember more vividly than\nanything else, my first exposure to the A&P and self-service. At the end of six weeks we left,\nsailed.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: A place of refuge. A place where my great grandfather had migrated to during the gold rush,\nand where my grandmother was born in San Francisco, which is why we were headed to San\nFrancisco, which thus in a way was part of my memory. I identified with it easily and readily,\nmore than with America in general. That was an abstraction. San Francisco was something\nspecific.",
        "A: Ihave no idea. But speaking of emotions. I do remember, I wasn\u2019t there but my mother told\nme this story. When they traveled from Stuttgart to Paris by train on or about the 21\u201c of\nDecember, on the Orient Express. As they crossed the Rhine from Kale [ph] to Strasbourg, my\nfather got up and spit in the Rhine or did something symbolic that I don\u2019t remember the details.\nBut my mother proudly told the story that, of that symbolic crossing.\nAnd parenthetically in their passports, the exit from Germany is on the 20\" of December. The\nentry stamp for France is on the 21\u201c. It was that close to midnight. I may have the dates off by a\nday or so but the one day difference I do know.",
        "A: That was sobering. The discipline, you had to line up to walk from one classroom to the other\nand that\u2019s about all I remember and of course I flunked. By the time we arrived in San Francisco\nand that\u2019s a story worth telling. We still thought our furniture would come so we stayed in a\nhotel for three or four days and then cousin Fanny, an American, third generation American.\nCame by and found us a furnished apartment. Whereupon my father went to see the manager\nand said where is the nearest high school. I want my son to start in the morning. Where 1s the\nnearest elementary school. And when cousin Fanny and Manny, her husband. Fanny wore the\npants in the family. Came by. My father proudly announced, oh George is going to start Galileo\nHigh School in the morning. Whereupon cousin Fanny said no member of our family has ever\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\ngone to Galileo. I will take George to Lowell high school and introduce him to the principal,\nwhich she did. And that is how I wound up in a very much academically kind of elitist public\nhigh school in San Francisco, which had a college graduation. I mean college \u2014",
        "A: College prep curriculum. It had no shop. It did have shorthand and typing for the girls. I took\ntyping. Good thing I did. But it was completely academically oriented. And even before the war\nit graduated something like 92 percent who went on to college.",
        "A: No. Because I had begun Lowell in late January I guess and the change of semester occurred\nlet\u2019s say on the tenth of February. There were quite a few junior high school students who\ntransferred into Lowell as sophomores and I became a sophomore. But I was already established\nas a Lowell student, by virtue of two weeks or whatever it was. And I was almost elected room\nrepresentative. And I didn\u2019t know what a room representative was.",
        "A: What I now know and did not know then is that Lowell high school was disproportionately\nJewish. To what extent I don\u2019t know because I didn\u2019t think in those terms but I will cite as an\nexample that Supreme Court Justice Breyer is a Lowell alumnus.",
        "A: Not that I recall. Well no, there is an exception.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: There was a classmate named Sidney Brown who clearly was fascinated by the idea of having\na friend who had escaped from the jaws of \u2014 and introduced me to his parents. I was not\nsufficiently with it to realize what was going on. And Sidney died I think before graduation of\nnatural causes. And I didn\u2019t have enough sense to visit the parents or, I mean, whatever I was\nsupposed to do. Which would have been to my advantage with hindsight because they would\nhave quasi adopted me. He was an only child. I don\u2019t want to sound mercenary but, so there is\nan exception. I know for sure that Sidney, with hindsight, almost certainly of Eastern Jewish\norigin. Sorry to make these distinctions but they do matter.",
        "A: Not that I recall. Now I took French, where of course I was a stellar student and skipped four,\nfive, six until I got to French eight, but which time my French had declined. I still did well but,\nand of course in French, it was predominantly girls, where again I was. I don\u2019t want to say I was\ntreated as a pet. But I was a little bit different because I knew so much more than they did, with\nthe exception of Lucille who had a French mother.",
        "A: I must have. I probably lost all accent by the time I went in the army. And of course,\nreacquired an accent by virtue of having served in the European theater where I had to speak\nGerman. I can\u2019t be certain of that but \u2014",
        "A: My mother did a lot better than my father. My father never adjusted. He couldn\u2019t find a\ndecent job. He died on the 25\"\" of November, two weeks before Pearl Harbor, which meant of\ncourse, full employment came right after that. The relatives in San Francisco were\nconscientious, helpful, but they were all retired and they had warned him we\u2019re not going to be\nvery helpful in getting you settled in a job or occupation.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: There my father was reasonably provident. Reasonably. Within the limits of the restrictions.\nOn one of my trips to Switzerland. Maybe it was the final one. I don\u2019t remember. They handed\nme a box, cigar box size. Wrapped as a gift. Told me to put it under the seat, not tell anybody\nand retrieve it afterwards. And that is how a good deal of jewelry was smuggled out. I don\u2019t\nknow all those details because children are not initiated into financial affairs. But he used various\ndevices to accumulate some money. There was another fortunate thing. The provider of the\naffidavit, a first cousin of my grandmother\u2019s, obviously an old lady because she was turned\ndown, being too old for the affidavit, died within half a year after we got there. And my father\nwas in her will to the tune of one half of one percent or some ridiculous sum like that. Which\nturned out to be $4000. I mean it, I use the word ridiculous. Obviously I \u2014\nThere were things like that. And another cousin helped my mother invest the money or he\nborrowed some money from my mother at a high rate of interest. They did various things to help.\nThere was another fallout which I consider very fortunate. Not only did I go to a good high\nschool. A cousin lived within four blocks of home in a very elegant district. We didn\u2019t. They\nhad season tickets to the San Francisco Symphony. When they couldn\u2019t go, we got the tickets.\nSo I kind of grew up with Pierre Monteux and the San Francisco symphony. And I swear by\nPierre Monteux to this day. These are the kinds of things that I think you were looking for.\nOne other thing that fits in with your questions. In New York a cousin on my mother\u2019s side who\nI have since found out was born in Switzerland, but I thought he was native born American,\nbecause he was genuine American and had married a genuine American. Told my mother oh of\ncourse you\u2019re coming on either Saturday or Sunday to Temple Emanuel. Literally the first time\nin my life that I had been to a synagogue, of which I remember essentially nothing except that it\nwas not that different from the Protestant services I had gone to occasionally with one of the\nmaids or\u2014\nThere was organ music and there was a I think a choir but significant in terms of this interview, I\nthink is literally the first time in my life that I set foot in a synagogue.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: Not at all. We lived in within five blocks of Temple Emanuel to which some relatives\nbelonged and it was there and oh I got a gift membership in the Jewish community center which\nhad a pool and a library of comic books which helped my Americanization. That\u2019s about it. Oh,\nno. One other significant thing. After Pearl Harbor you may recall there were enacted a series of\nlaws or regulations, the evacuation of the Japanese, which meant that native born Americans of\nJapanese descent, including my classmate Torsho [ph] were evacuated. We technically enemy\naliens, were merely subject to a curfew. We could not travel more than five miles from home\nunless we were going directly to or from school or work. And we had to be home by eight PM,\nwhich means that I could not attend my own high school graduation in the San Francisco opera\nhouse, which was held at eight PM. And because Drummond law observing tradition, my\nmother said, my father was dead by then. You can\u2019t go and I didn\u2019t go. There are 27 people who\nhave told me since then but you could have passed. It was no great deprivation for me but it\nanswers your question of did I feel Jewish. Well this also meant that we couldn\u2019t go out Saturday\nnight like other adolescents. So there were three or four of us who got together on Sunday\nafternoon because that\u2019s the best we could do on weekends.",
        "A: Exactly, because we were enemy aliens.",
        "A: Let me continue with enemy alien because that has -- When I was inducted in the US Army in\nMay or June of 1943, I was sent to the Presidio of Monterrey and I said where do I go to get\nnaturalized, because I knew that as soon as you were in the military you were eligible. You\ndidn\u2019t have to wait the full five years. Oh, no, no that will happen when you take your basic\ntraining. So I was sent to Fort Riley Kansas, the cavalry school. And took my basic training and\nthe mounted cavalry, horse cavalry. Where I asked where do I go to get naturalized. Oh you\u2019re\njust trying to get out of the obstacle course. Not now, not here.\nAt the end of 16 weeks of basic training horse cavalry, mounted radio operator. I got my orders,\na week delayed en route as it was called which means basically annual leave. And then you have\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nto report to the port of embarkation. I made it as far as the change station in Junction City, alias\nJunk Town. My name was not called. Why? Nobody knew. Go, go back to Fort Riley. So I did\nwhere I found out the following morning I could not be shipped overseas because I was not yet a\ncitizen. That shipment wound up on the Anzio beach head. So they didn\u2019t know what to do with\nme, still not naturalized, so they sent me to advanced communication school. I was trained as a\nradio operator where the instructors were delighted that there were three of us who were\ninterested in cryptography, crypto analysis. Nobody thought the fact that here an enemy alien\nwas inducted and a crypto analysis which I never used. And in due time I was shipped out to\ncamp McCoy, 76\" cavalry, reconnaissance troop mechanized. And then I was naturalized at\nLacrosse Wisconsin and was ready for, we were then sent overseas anyway.\nBut and didn\u2019t wind up all that well. We were committed during the Battle of the Bulge. But still\nit was the tail end and we were not part of the initial \u2014",
        "A: Paperwork. Psychologically I had made the transition and was merely, really annoyed that I\nhad not yet been certified. So to speak.",
        "A: Oh absolutely.",
        "A: Only in the hostile sense. Yes. I thought about Germany, that we knew we were going to be\nshipped to the European theater which meant that I would probably be useful. I turned out to be\nuseful in the reconnaissance outfit where if we took prisoners we had to ship them back to\ndivision headquarters where there was a IPW team, interrogation of prisoners of war who had\nbeen properly trained. And four days later we might find out whatever wanted to know. We\nwanted to know being a reconnaissance outfit what was over the next hill or in those woods\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nahead of us. And that is where I turned out to be very useful. I could go unskilled interrogation\non the spot. So did I think a lot about Germany\u2019? Good heavens, we confronted it daily.\nOne of the incidents worth mentioning. We would occupy a new village or a new site. It\noccurred to me, maybe the phones are still working but who would I call. And I was also careful\nenough what would my fellow troopers think. Would they clearly realize that I so two reasons\nnot to use the phone. Which I never found out where it would work or not.\nBut it\u2019s by way of elucidating or answering your question. Did I think about Germany. Yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, a bit earlier. We did run into liberated what were later called displaced persons, slave\nlaborers. We, over at Buchenwald \u2014",
        "A: We went through it, passed it because we had to keep going eastward so that is not\nmeaningful. We did visit Buchenwald four weeks later when it was already somewhat cleaned\nup. But no we didn\u2019t know what was going on. At least not in any meaningful detail.",
        "A: No. I\u2018ve seen so many movies and so many documentaries and read so much about it that I\ncan\u2019t tell really from then.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: I was part of a reconnaissance troop which disembarked in Le Havre. And we crossed\nFrance, Belgium and Luxembourg fairly fast and of course in France I spoke French. In Belgium\nI spoke French. Very shortly. In Luxembourg, they weren\u2019t at all surprised that I could talk to\nthe natives in what Sergeant White described as slop bucket Dutch, which I didn\u2019t speak but they\neither spoke French or German. We crossed the what we call the Siegfried line and the Germans\ncalled the Westwall and basically crossed all of Germany and advanced clear into what later\nbecame the Soviet zone of the German Democratic Republic because we were over achievers.\nWe advanced too far. We were for six weeks part of the very short lived American occupation\nof Saxony. Because as reconnaissance, we were hit and run. Our job was not to fight. Our job\nwas to reconnoiter and report back, which made for a very uneven life. But it was like the\ninfantry which \u2014",
        "A: I didn\u2019t talk to them very much except, oh I remember when we crossed over in Germany the\nexec, choke commander said oh from now on we\u2019re going to be billeted whenever possible in\nhomes. No more slip trenches, no more camping out. And you corporal George, I don\u2019t know.\nYou are going to tell them they have 30 minutes to clear out. I said, who me. Tell them. Well you\nget used to it very quickly. And that is what we did whenever we needed billets and I amended\nthe orders and said don\u2019t lock anything up because American, we had trench knives, not\nbayonets, variations of. We\u2019ll only be doubly tempted by whatever is locked and you will lose.",
        "A: Other than that I didn\u2019t amend the orders. I also told my fellow troopers who we very quickly\ndiscovered ham and chimneys and eggs in the chicken houses. Yes, by all means. But why don\u2019t\nyou leave the K ration, chocolate and a few cigarettes by way of paying them back which as far\nas I know they did.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nBut we had no compunction about raiding chicken coops or hauling ham out of the chimneys.\nDid I talk to Germans? Well obviously to, to tell them to get out. There wasn\u2019t much\nconversation, no. They stayed away from us. They wanted to know could they come back and\nmilk the cows or could they come. And occasionally they would say I never even was no Nazi no\nhow. There was essentially no interaction other than necessary interaction.",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall that the question came up but I certainly didn\u2019t mention it. On the other hand,\nthey drew, some of them probably drew their own conclusions when somebody spoke \u2014",
        "A: At that point I spoke fluent, but not adult German. I acquired an adult vocabulary of course,\nduring those months, but not only that, I spoke with a southern dialect. No, they did not\ninterrogate me.",
        "A: Much later. Ok. The end of hostilities was the ninth of May when we were deep in the heart\nof Saxony. We held a victory parade in Saxony. We were invited to the Russian parade which\nwas across the river. Which I don\u2019t remember very clearly but it happened. There, during those\nsix weeks, quasi-peace time in the sense that no hostilities. There I was exposed to a lot of\nGerman conversation and probably sought it out because I was curious to learn what they were\nlike and what they were feeling. We lived in German housing that we had taken over. Long\ndetour. This was in Limbach in Saxony. Well we had taken a corner house. And we hung an\nAmerican flag from the balcony. I still have a picture of two Gls standing and the flag, not me\nbut two fellow troopers. Four years ago I went to Berlin to meet a German historian who was\nalso interested in this six week occupation of the later German Democratic Republic. And we\nhad exchanged e-mails and he was fascinated. Some of the photo \u2014 oh he doesn\u2019t know much\nEnglish so he found a correspondent who could correspond in German. And had photographs. He\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nchecked up on me. He asked me did I remember where we were billeted in Limbach. I said well\nit was across from a park and I vaguely remember. Maybe it was called Allee esse Strasse [ph]\nnumber 15. Here is a photograph of the house. He went. It was number 13, not number 15. But\nbecause he had a photograph. He interviewed the residents and he found a woman who said oh I\nwas a seven year old girl and there was a German who spoke with a southern accent. It was this\nAmerican who \u2014 He didn\u2019t\u2019 check up on me. He kind of wanted to authenticate. That\u2019s a lengthy\ndetour of your question, did I interact with the Germans. Yes, after the end of hostilities a whole\nlot. I found a photo shop in Limbach which still had chemicals and paper and by that time a lot\nof Americans had acquired cameras. Liberated cameras. And asked me could I arrange to have\nthe film developed. And I had duplicates made for my own collection. Thus I have probably the\nlargest collection of photographs.\nIn a different small town, I arranged for laundry service. We had to provide the soap of course\nbut the underwear came back ironed and all of this is by way of answering your question, did I\nhave much interaction with the Germans. Not during the combat period. Except when necessary.\nAnd of course eternally they said oh I never was a Nazi or I was this, I tended to cut them up s,\ncut them off short. Got to be a litany.",
        "A: Well we encountered all kinds of displaced persons. A name not, then not known. They were\ncalled slave laborers, even though some we found out had volunteered. I remember a Belgian\ngirl, young woman who admitted clearly that she had volunteered. There was nothing to eat at\nhome. And by working she was reasonably well taken care of, along with half a dozen others.\nThose were non-Jewish volunteers. The displaced persons, Jewish, that\u2019s where I discovered\nthat I didn\u2019t speak Yiddish but if they spoke slowly and if I repeated everything twice in German\nwe could communicate. I didn\u2019t know there was such a language. Well I guess I did know that\nthere were Americans who spoke Yiddish but whoever they were. I have since learned from\nHans Hirsch that there is a variation called western Yiddish which my German ancestors\nprobably spoke. Hans knows far more about that than I do. But he has educated me.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: No. I should but I didn\u2019t. Now I do remember clearly in Yayna, [ph] for example, a town in\neast Germany, former East Germany. We had advanced without military government personnel.\nThere were no, we had advanced too far. There was no provision for military government. And I\nwas asked to improvise. And facetiously and in quotation marks, I became the chief of police of\nYayna. Nobody had issued orders for all arms to be turned in for example. So I issued the order\nand sent out the town crier. That is how the order got amended by various Americans or all\ncameras had to be turned in. I did not issue that order but in fact I never acquired a camera. But\nwe at that point I, your question was dealing with the DPs or Jews. I very clearly remember that\nwe took over a former German garrison just explicitly as quarters for the Jewish liberated\nrefugees, whatever you want to call them. Displaced persons today. That we tried to provide food\nfor them because they didn\u2019t have ration stamps and things like that. But I was chief of police for\nsix days so there\u2019s a limit to what you can accomplish.\nWe had to improvise because while there was quite good American preparation for military\ngovernment it had not extended that far east. I have actually written an essay about that particular\nepisode because it is that unusual. And I have since read a German historian and I don\u2019t quite\nagree with his description of that six week occupation. I\u2019ve probably gone too far afield.",
        "A: No, this was not a camp. This was \u2014",
        "A: These were refugees liberated and they needed to be taken care of. And I certainly took the\ninitiative. I\u2019m not patting myself on the back. That because I spoke German, I was expected to\ndo all kinds of things.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: In Europe. Do you know about the point system? Ok Ill explain it briefly. To be repatriated\nto the US you had to have a certain number of points because they were this enormous number of\nAmericans who were ready to go home. In August of course the war with Japan ended, against\nJapan ended. You had to have \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember any reaction. The point is we were winning and the war was almost over or\ncompletely over. There, that was irrelevant.",
        "A: I was sent to camp San Francisco near Chateau Thierry for reassignment because I was not\nready to go home. This was the so called repo depot, replacement depot. I managed to get to\nParis twice. Illegal passes. And I knew I was going to be sent back to Germany because to be\nrepatriated you had to have points. You earned one point for every month of active service. You\ngot a second point for every month of overseas service. And you get five points for every medal\nor Purple Heart. Well I didn\u2019t have enough points. I had to wait my turn. So I was sent back.\nAnd assigned to Eisenhower\u2019s headquarters. US Forces, European theater. US FET. Where I\nwas a clerk working under WAC Captain which I did not resent. Interesting now. Some of my\ncolleagues resented it. And one of my duties was to drive a colonel to the airport or something\nlike that. And I remember the colonel said and how do you like your job corporal. And I said\nfrankly sir, I don\u2019t. I am bored. I have skills. I am bilingual and I am not being utilized.\nIncredibly enough within a week I was transferred to a suburb of Frankfurt. It was called the UT,\nU S Information service. It later became the US Information Service. And it was then called the\nInformation Service Control Command. Where I wound up in a fascinating assignment. A daily,\nbecause I had a minimum of journalism exposure. A daily digest of all anti-American activities\nin the American sector. The werewolves, I don\u2019t know if you have ever heard of them. There\nwere some Nazi fanatics up in the Alps who were doing terrible things to, I mean never\namounted to anything but there was much talk about the werewolves.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nAnd the other thing I remember is any number of Germans came home and found that their\ngirlfriends or wives had been seduced by Americans or by American chocolate or cigarettes and\nthereupon they either cussed out the Americans or did actually something anti-American. That\nwas the daily confirmation. But what impressed me, it was for circulation only to colonels and\nup. And here I was a corporal. That lasted a while. I have since tried to go to the archives and\nfind my immortal prose. I haven\u2019t been able to find it and it\u2019s not worth the effort. I have not\nbeen able to find comparable compilations either.",
        "A: Oh no, no. there that was a continuation of the fight against the allies. It was, it does not, or\nI\u2019m sure they would have. No it was not explicitly anti-Semitic. It was anti Allied. It didn\u2019t\namount to anything. It was trivial. And it was probably reported more thoroughly than it was in\nfact. After a few weeks in Bad Hamburg editing this daily digest I asked to be transferred to the\nprovinces and I was assigned to Regensburg which is on the Danube in Bavaria. The district\ninformation command which was doing de-Nazification work. In those days to work on a newly\nreconstituted newspaper or radio or no television. Or even appear on the stage. You had to go\nthrough a de-Nazification which was a questionnaire with 101 questions. And there were three\nof us, three Americans. In Regensburg who did this kind of de-Nazification. We also did what\nwas no longer called censorship of the newspaper. But post publication scrutiny. Which means\nwe read the damn thing and if we found anything objectionable we were supposed to object.\nNever happened.\nI remember with a colleague named Bill Clark who knew German but his German was\natrocious. And my German of course improved daily and became much more adult. We went to\nthe nearby town of Straubing [ph] because there were rumors that the local theater had put on an\nanti-American play. I don\u2019t remember the author, I think it was Kleist and it dealt with the\nFrench revolution or something like that. We enjoyed the performance, went back to Regensburg\nand said nothing. Straubing sticks in my memory because I ran into a German Jew and his\ndaughter who had survived the war. I think he was married to a gentile, who alleged that he\nremembered my ancestral factory, 80 kilometers to the north. I did not pursue it in any\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nmeaningful way. It was one of the few cases where I actually encountered some vague link with\nmy patrilineal ancestry.\nWell in due time at the end of Regensburg I had enough points to be repatriated. And --",

And then dropped out because a classmate from Berkeley and a friend to this day in\nWashington. And I accepted jobs with an English language newspaper in of all places Stuttgart.\nIt went bankrupt at the end of eight weeks but, and that was my year in Europe. I was at loose\nends. So I went home and enrolled in graduate school and got a teaching credential as a fallback\nposition and got a master\u2019s and got a PhD and the rest 1s history. At Berkeley.",

        "A: I taught \u2014",
        "A: No. I taught at the California College of Arts and Crafts where they needed somebody to\nteach future art teachers and I was half of the social science department. I never taught arts and\ncrafts. I taught at San Francisco State College for a semester. It\u2019s now called San Francisco,\nCalifornia State University, San Francisco. These are inflationary times. I came east because I\nhad a job offer from the National Education Association to become assistant editor of the\nmonthly journal which was quite a professional production. Circulation 600,000. I mean \u2014\nI had a lot to learn. On the other hand I had enough, oh I left out something. Somewhere along\nthe line I became a contributing book reviewer for the San Francisco Chronicle, which meant I\ngot to keep the books which we traded 1n at the Berkeley book store where we had a positive\nbalance. I mean they bought them second hand but sold them. I\u2019m sure they \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nMy wife was so impressed that she said oh I could try my hand at that. And I brought home a\ncouple of books. She was at that point a deputy juvenile probation officer and there was a book\non juvenile delinquency and I brought it home and she did a glorious review, which her bosses\nliked because she wove in their names and the Oakland probation department. That led to the\nCalifornia Teachers\u2019 Association Journal asking me would I do an occasional review for them\nwhich wound up doing a couple of articles for them. And that led to a referral to the National\nEducation Association where I became an assistant editor and we moved to Washington, have\nbeen here ever since.\nI taught at Penn State for one summer session while working for the NEA. In the history of\neducation. Recycled my old lecture notes. But basically decided that the academic life was not\nfor me. I have since had several research jobs and other policy jobs in education. But it\u2019s a\nmixed bag and I don\u2019t know if you want to go into my whole career which is erratic or\nopportunistic.",
        "A: Almost certainly not. No. Not pertinent.",
        "A: By way of reinforcing that. While still working for the NEA, I was invited to give a lecture in\nGerman. I was then working for the NEA for the so called automation project which dealt with\nthe impact of automation on education. I was invited to give a lecture on automation at the Ost\nCollege in Cologne, in German. Ok. Sounds like fun. I wrote a lecture very carefully in English,\ntranslated it into German. Sent it to a former German classmate for editing. And he cleaned it\nup. He said it didn\u2019t need much fixing. Gave the lecture in Cologne. At the end of which there\nwas a question and answer period which I handled reasonably well. And when it was all over\nsomebody asked me, did your parents come from southern Germany. I said yes, why do you ask?\nWell you speak with a southern accent, but did never even entertain the idea that I had was an\nimmigrant or I cite the incident only by, as an elaborate answer to your question.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nGail Schwartz: This is the continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with George Arnstein. This is track number 3. And let\u2019s talk now a little bit about your\nthoughts and your perspectives, considering where you were born and what you went through.\nWhat are your thoughts about Germany today? You said you\u2019d gone back obviously on visits\nand lectures. Just generally what --\nGeorge Arnstein: Let me detour. My wife was a powerful influence on my life, which I\u2019m sure\nhappens in other marriages too but unusually so. She was smart, competent, sensitive, et cetera.\nOn our first trip to Europe which she was eager to do, we also stopped off in Stuttgart, ostensibly\nto liquidate a wicker basket which had been deposited by my great aunt Clare with a bank in\nStuttgart when Clare, American born, great aunt, and the bank had charged annually a modest\ndeposit fee, rent. And my wife said we\u2019ve got to liquidate that. Fine, we \u2014 among other things.\nShe also said and this is typical of my wife. I want to know where you came from. So we looked\nat the house we lived in. And things like that. We also went to the bank. It took half an hour to\nproduce the wicker basket. And it contained linens, towels, 12 pieces of silverware which\nhowever is not sterling because the German standard is only 875 and sterling is 92% or\nsomething like that. And there also were a couple of arm bands and I said oh these. She said oh I\nthink there was something. They turned out to be gold and one went to my sister and one went\nto Sherry. She spotted them. The linens we gave to former maids whom we also looked up. The\npieces of silver, we took to a local silversmith, jewelry store. We would like to buy, we had\nGerman restitution funds. We would like to buy 12 place settings and they said we can\u2019t do that\nbecause we don\u2019t have enough silver and we can\u2019t import any. You have to have old silver to\ntrade in. And I said well we just happen to have this pile. And literally that\u2019s how it happened\nand that is how today I own place settings for 12 1n almost sterling silver.\nYou ask about my feelings about Stuttgart. This is an example of my wife\u2019s influence in, to some\nextent, reconciling me and on that same trip. Oh.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: 57, 58.",
        "A: I also engaged in a long correspondence, dealing with restitution. My mother doesn\u2019t type.\nMy sister doesn\u2019t know German. She does, but badly. And so it befell to me and I inherited all\nthese documents, from my aunt Nellie, from my mother, from my grandmother. I still have an\nenormous collection of them. And I successfully pursued any number of restitution claims.\nSuccessfully has its limits. They were put into blocked mark accounts because Germany in those\ndays had no foreign currency. They were essentially bankrupt. So you could use the money\nwithin Germany but you could not, oh you could sell it in Switzerland at a terrific discount which\nwe did a couple of times. And of course I shared everything with my mother and sister. The\nresult is that we were wealthy when we were in Stuttgart. And in the process I engaged a lawyer\nin Stuttgart and got a letter from one of his interns for lack of a better name who identified\nhimself as a former classmate who is now an apprentice lawyer. And he would fully understand\nif I did not want to correspond, continue the correspondence. The point is I did, and we\u2019re still\nfriends today. His kids have visited here and et cetera.\nPS, his father was a printer with the pre-war Social Democratic newspaper. In other words, left-\nleaning.\nSo that is another, shall we say point of reference where we had access to a, oh they weren\u2019t\nliving in Stuttgart. They had been evacuated during the war. Where my wife got a feeling for\nhow Germans lived and was most curious to learn about my previous life. Is this the kind of\nstuff?",
        "A: At the Ost College, the lecture I gave in German, very significant. I faced a decision. If I\naccepted that invitation, for which there was a trivial honorarium, I had to accept the Germans. I\nhad to make my peace. So I was confronted with a decision and I made it. And in the\naffirmative, if you want to put it that way. Germans today are two generations removed from\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nthen. Every once in a while I run into somebody who of course is of my generation. And there I\ntend to have problems. Nothing hostile. They all behave very properly. And I behave I hope\nproperly, but I simply don\u2019t relate to them the way I relate to younger people. There 1s an\nAmerican foundation, the Obermeyer Foundation. Arthur Obermeyer is a third generation\nAmerican of German Jewish descent from southwest Germany. And he has established an annual\naward, honoring those Germans who are doing something to keep alive the German Jewish\nmemory. It\u2019s mostly restoration of cemeteries and that kind of stuff. And four years ago, Hans\nHirsch and I and a couple of others nominated somebody successfully. And I thought ok, I\u2019ve\ndone my thing. So Hans asked me, you\u2019re going of course. I said it hadn\u2019t occurred to me but I\nwent. Found it very interesting and [Il spare you the details. I\u2019ve since done it three more times,\nmostly because we have identified various people and we\u2019re currently waiting to see whether this\nyear\u2019s nominees were elected or not. The trip to Berlin was interesting to me also because I\nwanted to meet this German historian who is also interested in the six week occupation. It turns\nout he was conceived during that occupation of an American and a German mother. That\u2019s his\nmotivation. And he doesn\u2019t speak much English. He has since discovered his American father\nand has been accepted by the family in Ohio or wherever. Still doesn\u2019t speak much English.\nBut he has been very helpful in taking me sightseeing to pieces of Berlin that I would not have\nseen otherwise and obviously is of a different generation.",
        "A: Yes. I can, I can tell because my sister being three years younger and married to an American\nwith three American, California born kids, knows about American childhood, rhymes, stories,\nanecdotes. I, not having kids, and being just a bit older. Oh I vaguely know who Old Mother\nHubbard was but not really. In that sense I am not fully assimilated. You asked me, would I be\ndifferent. Yes. I would be different but I didn\u2019t have that kind of childhood or experiences.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: Yes, I still have certain German habits, customs that, the way I was brought up is, emphasizes\ndeferred gratification. Maybe fewer white lies, maybe too much adherence to telling the truth,\neven when it\u2019s, when it shouldn\u2019t be told. Now my wife taught me an awful lot and certainly has\nAmericanized me. I think that\u2019s as far as I can go.",
        "A: I have for the past dozen years or so longer than that. My wife. Been very active in doing\nfamily history, genealogy. My wife teased me. Until I started compiling her family history which\nis quite limited of course because eastern resources are. But I discovered a cousin of hers who\nhad fled the Soviet Union, lived in Germany. I corresponded with that cousin who said oh, you\nSherry have an uncle in Leningrad, whereupon we took a Baltic cruise. First lined up a local\nrecent immigrant who made a phone call to the uncle in Leningrad. And basically arranged that\nwe would meet in Leningrad when our ship stopped there. The uncle imported a cousin of\nSherry\u2019s who lived in Moscow. A retired teacher of English who had never been in an English\nspeaking country to serve as interpreter. In short my wife has forgiven me my interest in\nfamilies. I\u2019m being glib of course.\nWhy did I engage in what is clearly unequivocally Jewish family history. I learned a whole lot\nabout my ancestors, who spoke probably western Yiddish who are clearly were observant. I had\na great grandfather who was a either a parnas [ph] or but it\u2019s all historical interest. It doesn\u2019t do\nanything for me. In the emotional Jewish sense. I am ethnically Jewish as non-observant as can\nbe. The only time I go to a synagogue 1s for weddings or funerals. Hans has forgiven me but\nclearly that\u2019s it.",
        "A: That\u2019s an awkward question or an awkward answer. I keep thinking the Jewish claim to\nPalestine, to Israel, is a little bit like are we ready to give America back to the Indians. They did,\nI\u2019m conflicted obviously. I am not a Zionist. I am vaguely pro-Israel but it\u2019s a tenuous\nconnection.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: We have been there twice but not, but superficially. We took Mediterranean cruises and the\nship docked in Haifa and we had 36 hours. I walked the stations of the cross in Jerusalem\nbecause the fellow passengers were Protestants. My wife had a non-cousin in Haifa I think and\nvisited him. My wife had a much more traditional Jewish upbringing. She belonged to B\u2019Nai\nBrith youth and no Hillel youth, but I don\u2019t want to put words in her mouth but I think she kind\nof saw marrying me as a liberating experience. Part of it may of course have been simply loyalty\nto a marriage and I don't know. But she certainly adjusted more to my way of life and thinking\nthan I adjusted to hers.",

I am\nvery conscious of the fact that thanks to an American great grandfather and thus an American\ngrandmother and thus extended family in California, my life became a whole lot better, in part\nalso because I didn\u2019t get hung up on the east coast in New York. There is nothing with New\nYork and there is nothing wrong with, but I\u2019m glad I grew up in San Francisco where in a\nmoment of weakness of course, I can claim to be a fourth generation Californian.",

And I got a very modest restitution for my sister and for\nmyself for interrupted education. Parenthetically, she collected more than I did because I was\nhell bent to get a PhD and she took her own sweet time to get a master\u2019s. But those are the\naberrations or idiosyncrasies of laws enacted.",
        "A: Oh it didn\u2019t amount to all that much. But we were poor struggling graduate students and every\nlittle bit was welcomed. I have uncovered a couple of dormant Swiss accounts. Because I\npursue that kind of stuff. And I tipped off a cousin in Connecticut who collected far more than I\ndid but she had wealthier relatives. And tipped off a cousin in Florida who failed to follow\nthrough. It has been ongoing but nobody in my immediate family ever collected monthly\npayment. No these were always rather small lump sums.",

Yes, the Germans have learned their lesson I think. Who else is\nsupposed to have learned? The Austrians certainly not. They\u2019re opportunists. I happen to have\nAustrian Jewish neighbors.

In fact the last time I was there, I was reminded, it is my life d\u00e9ja vu\nall over again. The exhibits are awe inspiring. In a way I\u2019m glad that it\u2019s just off the Mall.\nPeriod.",
        "A: The Mall should be American patriotic. Just like Martin Luther King is just a little bit off in\npart because the Mall is more or less full. But. (pause) It\u2019s only in a limited sense the American\nexperience. Therefore it\u2019s entirely suitable but maybe off the Mall.",
        "A: I should add something about my military experience which obviously is a major event in my\nlife. Iam glad I went was sent to the European theater. It was a very meaningful experience. I\ndon\u2019t want to call it an emotional experience but it and I don\u2019t want to call it vengeance either.\nBut I was clear what the war was about and I was glad to be doing it. Something towards it. I am\namazed with hindsight and I was in a small outfit, 160 men. How fully accepted I was. That\nthey never to my knowledge had any doubts. They weren\u2019t that conscious of the difference\nbetween Jewish and non-Jewish. The, I was fully accepted.",
        "A: Oh yes, my fellow troopers. And of course I was more pivotal than most others because I\nspoke French and I spoke German. And I knew all kinds of local things that turned out to be\nuseful. I could translate the sign that said Achtung Menin [ph] So I just want to add that was a\nmeaningful experience and I\u2019m glad I was in it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\nThe experience in military government after the end of the war was also meaningful. First of all\nit certainly enhanced my vocabulary to do de-Nazification questionnaires you had to enlarge\nyour vocabulary and your view of the world. I also, it also refreshed my memories. One reason\nwhy I am probably better able to remember things during an interview like this than others 1s\nbecause I had a refresher course at age 20, 21 which living in an environment that evoked all\nkinds of things that \u2019d forgotten or would have forgotten. And once again the influence of my\nwife is massive. Period. Positive, obviously.",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure I understand the question probably because I can\u2019t answer it. Part of me says\nhell no. And part of me says well of course. That\u2019s where I was born. That\u2019s how I spent the first\n13 years of my life or 12 years. I had my father certainly wasn\u2019t Americanized. My mother\nbecame quite thoroughly Americanized and learned to speak excellent English. Well she lived\nwithin walking distance of her grandchildren and she became a surrogate mother to the\ngrandchildren who to this day think very highly of her. Well she had a house with a pool in Los\nAngeles. The, but my mother was German. And expected me to, I was expected to write home\nin the army, after the war, regularly, often. And I would get a letter back, punctually. That simple\nwas a given.",
        "A: Ohno. No, no. In English. Well mine had to be in English because they were subject to\ncensorship.",
        "A: Well not after the end of hostilities of course. But I\u2019d have to look. My mother\u2019s letters\nalmost certainly were in English by then.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011",
        "A: We spoke English almost from day one in this country. Obviously not. We had to speak\nGerman because we didn\u2019t know enough English but we were hell bent to become Americans\nand assimilate and learn English which in the case of my sister and me was happened not\novernight, but very quickly. And in the case of my mother we increasingly spoke to her in\nEnglish. We had no intention of going back. This was in the day when it took a week on a\nsteamer and no, we didn\u2019t want to go back. Of course I went back within five years but \u2014",
        "A: Oh my mother went back at least twice. My aunt Nellie died too soon. She didn\u2019t go back.\nMarianne didn\u2019t go back and my grandmother also, she died in 49, much too soon to go back.",
        "A: Extended, yes but not immediate family. Well because I do family history I have of course I\nmean I have several thousand names and there are lots and lots of victims. But in terms of people\nthat I knew personally, there was a classmate of my father\u2019s who\u2019s also a distant relative who\ncommitted suicide in Los Angeles because he found out that his nieces and nephews had been\ndeported. There was a cousin who of all things was the equivalent of a county judge, not I mean\nhe was a judge but not, who was killed or his wife was killed. I don\u2019t remember now. One of\nthem died of natural causes about that time. I think 1t was his wife and she\u2019s the relative as\nopposed to the judge. But this is extended family. Of all the people that I knew I literally can\u2019t\nthink of one.",
        "A: Well as I told you, Herman came out of a PW cage. This was September 1945. The war\nended in May. We explored the neighborhood together and we did it amicably, successfully and\nnostalgically. He told me that his, he was a lieutenant. His company commander who was a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 23, 2011\ncaptain was a guy who lived across the street, and he was four years older than we were. And he\nwas killed. He, period, paragraph. My wife and I went back and visited Herman and his wife.\nThis must have been my wife died 14 years ago so I tend to time everything before and after.\nThis must have been 18, 20 years ago. And it was a very good visit. He and his wife and my\nwife and I took a trip out in the country and we visited a ruined castle on a mountaintop because\nHerman and I had bicycled there in a one day trip. And we were all staggered that we had\nmanaged to do that at the age of 12, 13. But these are selective. When I visited, oh the city of\nStuttgart had a program to invite its former citizens. My wife was by then too ill to travel and so\nmy sister and I and her husband went whenever. And I was interviewed and there was a story in\nthe newspaper with my picture, whereupon there promptly was a phone call from a former\nclassmate in the hotel who\u2019d like to get together with me. Well he was one of those I did not\nwish to get reacquainted with. He was the cousin of one of the guys who had followed me during\nthe soccer game. Now blood 1s thicker than water. He was a cousin so maybe he was less\nenthusiastic and less nasty but I chose not to tell him off, not to do anything. I just not to get\nreacquainted. Does that illustrate. In 1945 probably during that same visit with Herman, I\nremember walking past the house where the teacher lived who had made that precipitating\nremark and there was the doorbell and there was his name. Should I break his goddamn\nwindows. No. I chose to ignore him. So I don\u2019t remember exactly what your question was but\nmy feelings are very clearly no, I do not want to exact revenge. I merely want to take advantage\nof whatever present memories I have.",
