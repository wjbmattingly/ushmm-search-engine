        "Q: We're on camera.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Would you tell me your name please?",
        "A: My name 1s Lily ____ Margules, and I was born April 19, 1924, in Vilno, Poland. Before\nthe second world war, my name was Lily _____ and this how I was known by all my friends.",
        "Q: Would you tell me, Lily, about your parents and your family when you were a small child?",
        "A: Uh...I was...I had a very sheltered and pampered childhood. Both my parents were\nprofessionals. My father, David __, was a self-made man. He was a registered pharmacist...\nuh...despite the...that he came from a poor religious family, he became very successful after\nhe became a pharmacist. And he met my mother when he was in the University and\nboth...they were students. She studied dentistry and she belonged to the upper class, upper\nmiddle class and my grandfather was not too happy where...about this marriage, but when\nmy mother became a dentist and opened her own office, he consented and they got...they got\nmarried. My mother's name was ______. And she was really a very good professional, a\nvery gracious lady, and a very good mother and wife. My parents belonged to this...this\nstudents that actually lived very...very actively participated in the Russian revolution and\neven when they became successful, they still spoke Russian at home and all...all the ideals\nabout the equality and fraternity were very much imbedded in their minds and this...they\nembedded in us also. Despite that they worked very hard, there were always time for cultural\nevents and they used to go the theatre there, a very nice college and they had an excellent\nsocial life. I had a younger sister that was born 4 years after us. Actually I was born on the\nstreet called ____4 and my sister was born in the apartment and my mother's closet became\ntoo small and we moved to ___ 38, which was...which was the apartment and office that I\nlived til the second war world II. I have very fond memories of my childhood, and my\nparents really tried their best to...to make us, me and my sister very happy. As soon as I was\nborn I had a nanny and the nanny became a very big part of my life. And even my father\nwho was the real father ____ was afraid of my nanny because she became the boss. She\nadored my mother, but she actually was the only ones that stood up against my father and\n[...1t was sometimes when I used to go up and downstairs, it reminded me about her attitude,\nand her friends because every day she used to take me to the park. When I used to go to the\npark, I had to be dressed up...uh...like a little princess. I... had to wear a little hat, and I had\nto wear gloves and new shoes. And when she came there, she met all the other nannies and\nthey were talking and gossiping about their ladies and their bosses what they do there and\nwhat they...and what they were and how they spent their evening. And one...one wanted to\ntell the life of their ladies more interesting than the other. If my nanny decided that the dress\nI was wearing this day was not good enough, she didn't even consult my father or my\nmother, she just went to the store where we had credit. She bought me material. She went to\nthe dressmaker. She ordered a dress and this was it. And so my father got the bill and he\nasked what happened? How come you're spending so much money on little girls that will\ngrow up? She used to say, \"I cannot...I cannot allow my little girl look worse than any other\none. Do you want us to be poor? Do you want people to think that we are poor? We\nhave...we have to have appearances.\" And my father doesn't even say anything. When I\nhad...when I was 6 years old, and my parents send me to a private school. This was a school\nthat Jewish children used to go, but we were taught only Polish. And the name of the school\nwas the Private Coeducational. It was called gymnasium, and it was a private co-educational\nschool called ___. And it was located on the street on ___ ll. It was a very exclusive\nschool and I have very fond memories about it, because this teacher was a really dedicated\nand knowledgeable people. The atmosphere was very congenial and we had all the facility\nthat very often I wish my children would have when they were growing up. Because we had\nslides, we had clinical laboratories, physical laboratories and we had the ___, and we used\nto really...had very nice nature trips. And the only thing what I cannot forget how we used to\nadmire and respect our teacher who were really trying their best to make our life interesting\nand also the lessons that they teach were very exciting. When we studied about the French\nRevolution, they made like a mock judgment and we were discussing about___ SS\nhead rolled, and in no time we knew what was going on with...without worrying about the\nbook. And this...I had a little...uh...I had a very big interest in reading, and very soon...as\nsoon as I studied to...I knew how to read, my father on the suggestion of my mother took me\nto the library and then a new world opened before me because I started to read. I...there were\ndays that I had...I finished a book a day. Of course, in the beginning was just children's\nbooks, but a new world opened in front of me and my mother was very happy because she\nbelieved very strongly about culture. She used to drag me and my sister to all...to children\ntheatres to ballet. We didn't have an opera, but we had an operata. And she really used to\npump culture into us because she used to say...[ remember it well, \"that the person who\ndoesn't appreciate the music or poetry or finest things of life is really half...half blind and\nhalf...hard of feelings, because this everything is free, and you have to really appreciate it.\nComing back to...one second to my mother, I have to tell you that she was my best friend\nand I was very proud of her because not only was she a big beauty and a real lady, I never\nsaw her without a hat or a pair of gloves, but also she was a very compassionate person. She\nhad a very big clientele, and I remember rich landowners coming in front of our house and\nwith those little...uh...horse...horse and buggies, and...and those tall, strong, Polish men were\njust kissing my mother's hand because she was such a good dentist. And they used to bring\nall kinds of presents, but on the other hand the poor people around us knew if they have a\ntoothache or they have a any problem, they just come, ring the bell and come to the office\nand my mother would never ask them how much they can pay. They pay how much they\ncould, and if they couldn't pay it was alright also. So she always imbedded in our mind the\nconcept of charity. This idyllic life lasted through 1935, and this was the time when I started\nto feel the wind of anti-Semitism. My father...my father was working as a registered\npharmacist in a very big pharmacy that was a government pharmacy from the social services.\nEvery worker was involved in it. Only 3 Jewish pharmacists were working there. They were\nthe students that were on top of the class. In 1935, my father was told and also his two\ncolleagues that they have...in order to work there, they have to obtain a Masters Degree in\npharmacy. Of course, they had no other choice. They studied...they were studying. I was a\nlittle girl. My father used to close himself in...1n his bedroom and work and study. He used to\ngo on field trips because the old fashioned pharmacist didn't go and just and pick up the\nmedicine from the shelves. They have to prepare it. And finally when the tests\ncame...uh...there was an oral test and there was a written test. The man...the professor that\ngave him the test was a known anti-Semite and my father was very afraid that he won't pass\nthe test. But he passed the test with flying colors. The written test and the oral. And as he\nwas getting up from the chair...he was practically by the door, after he...telling him about so\nmany complicated chemicals formula and everything, all of sudden, the professor asked him,\n\"David ___, and what is the chemical...uh...formula for carbonated water with the C2 03,\nand my father was so nervous and so upset that he got a mental block and he couldn't answer\nhim. And he just didn't pass him. So, of course, he had to study enough and he went to\nWarsaw and after a short time we got the telegram he did pass it. But after a very short time,\na decree came and Jews were not allowed to work as pharmacist in a government institution,\nand my father lost his job. I didn't tell you that my...my father had a brother and two sisters.\nAnd my...my grandparents on my father's side were very religious, very religious people, and\nmy grandmother had 16 children but only four survived because...uh...the children\nwere...died in the infancy, and after 12 children died, she..there was...uh...folklore in our\nfamily telling us that she went to a very famous rabbi and the rabbi told her that he...that if\nyou wanted your children to live, you have to dress them only in white. Even...only in white,\neven if they grew...grow up and be able to go to school. And when the child will ask you,\n\"Mama, how come everybody dresses in all kinds of different colors and I'm wearing in\nwhite...I'm dressed in white,\" then you can take off and dress the child in any colors. And\nthis what happened. And she...the 13 and the 14 and 15 and the 16th child survived because\nshe kept them in white. And my...my father had a brother and two sisters. The...the...the...the\nyounger brother immigrated to Argentina with one of the sisters went to the United States,\nand one of the sisters lived with her parents in Poland and this...this...I just wanted to\nmention it because this was something happening and we were talking about this in the\nfamily. And so coming back to 1935 when my father lost his job, we...my mother had a very\nclose knit family. And, as I mentioned before, they were upper middle class, and they were\nsix children, two brothers and four sisters. One sister, as a young girl, got married and\nimmigrated to the United States. One sister got married to a very rich man that was a\nmanufacturer of papers and...uh...my oldest, my mother's oldest sister was a registered nurse.\nHer name was Sonia Lipquwich Perski, and she was actually my second mother and my...my\nmother, as I mentioned you, mentioned to you, was also a professional. And they were a very\nknit families. The two brothers, one the older brother was a publisher of a Jewish paper in\nKaunas, and the younger brother...his name was Soloman, was a dentist who didn't practice\ndentistry but opened a...a business...uh...dental supplies for dentists and mechanics....and\ndental mechanics. When it happened, the whole family got together. It was like a family\ncouncil and they decided that my father has to get to himself together and buy himself a\npharmacy. He couldn't buy a pharmacy in Vilno, but they found for him a pharmacy in a\nsmall town called Soley, but then a very tragic thing occurred. They didn't want to sell a\npharmacy to a Jewish pharmacist. So imagine a pharmacist, a Christian of Polish persuasion\nhad to be found, a sum of money collected by the family had to given to him and his name\nthe pharmacy was bought. This happened in 1938. And my...my...actually my family split\nbecause my mother and my sister had to go to Soley and find an apartment near the\npharmacy for my father and we stayed in Poland because my...we were going to school, and\nmy mother was practicing in Vilno. And this was the time that the very tragic event\noccurred. My mother got sick. My mother developed cancer, and when my father took her to\nthe doctor and she was operated on in one of the best hospitals in Vilno, she was...she was\nopened and closed and the professor told my father that she had 6 months to live. The cancer\nspread all over her body and you have two little girls. You have to live. But no...don't count\non your wife. It was a terrible tragedy for us. We were, as children, not told about it. And the\nonly thing that...that we knew that she was going for treatment. Then it was cobalt treatments\nand she used to feel really very bad but a little miracle happened because after 6 months she\nwent into remission and she even started to practice because her patients were so dedicated\nto her that they...we had to take off the bell from the door because everybody would come\nand just wanted to find out how she is doing. Now I have to tell a little story about our dog.\nWe had a dog called Rex, which 1s in...with the ____ in Latin. And we actually grew up with\nthe dog because when I was born, my parents bought this dog and she was our best friend.\nThe dog always when we used to eat at home, the dog was stay in the dining room under the\ntable we used to throw him the best morsels. The only thing if...when the dog was not\npresent when the guests came and my parents were entertaining their colleagues, it was a\nthing in our family that the...that the children had to be seen but not heard, and they had to\ndisappear together with the dog. My...when my mother got sick and she was lying in bed, the\ndog was sitting near here and there was no power that you should take away the dog from\nher bed. The only thing that he used to go...he used to go to the kitchen when he ...where he\nhad his dish to eat. And he would eat, drink a little water and lie on his little pillow near my\nmother. And the dog...when my mother didn't survive, this what...we felt actually the tragedy\nin my young life because on May the 22st, the 24th 1939, my mother passed away. And it\nwas something unbelievable because I was sleeping and all of a sudden I was wakened up by\nthe howling of the dog. When my mother passed away, the...the dog started to howl so\nstrong that they had to take him out from the house with the...with the force. And it was such\na big tragedy for me because I adored my mother. I was proud of her. The best day of the\nweek was for me Friday because she wasn't working, and she used to take us to all the\nfunctions and used to...she used to take us to the park. And I was so proud of her because she\nreally was so beautiful that strange men used to tip their hats for her...uh..say to her, call her\nlike princess or madonna or queen. And I was so proud of it all. My...this is my mother! So\nit was a terrible tragedy for me. We had a tremendous funeral. All the children from my class\nand from my mother's class...uh...from my sister's class came. And so many colleagues and\nsO many patients that we didn't even realize that she had...that she was known by so many\npeople. And the dog wanted to go in this...1n this cortege, but he was...the funeral cortege,\nbut he was taken. When I came home from the funeral, I was very broken up and I really was\nso desperate that I thought that the...that the world is finished for me. And I remember it was\nMay...May is a beautiful month in...in Vilno because all the lilacs are growing and the air is\njust perfumated with jasmine and lilacs. It is the most beautiful time of the year. So on a\nSaturday when ____ my little friends took me out and we were walking through the streets\nand the sun was shining and the birds were singing and I said to my God, \"The life is going\non and my mother is not any more with us.\" I couldn't find peace. My teachers came to visit\nme and I was a very good student. Have to remember I was a teacher's pet and studying was\nvery easy for me. And all of a sudden...uh...my grades fell down and my teachers when they\ncame to me, they said to me, \"You have to study. You have to take yourself together.\" And I\ntold them, \"I don't have nothing to...anymore studying. I having nothing to live anymore and\nthe writings, articles to the papers because each class had a class paper. Was a time even\nwhen I was a publisher, an editor actually of the paper and the best article from this paper\nused to go to a school paper. It was called The Student's Friend. And it was the only school\nin the whole city that had a printed paper from...from the students. It was a fascinating paper.\nOh...sometimes if I...when I remember myself about, I said, \"How come they were so serious\nabout the event? How come we understood so much?\" And I was really surprised.",
        "Q: Can you tell us. Let's...let's move forward a little bit if you could.\nA Yes.",
        "Q: Can you tell us what happened now? After your mother's death and the war broke out.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you tell us.",
        "A: Well, afterwards we...uh...we went...it was summer vacation, and we went to live with my\nfather and my Aunt Sonia came and she stayed with us a month. She kind of became our\nsurrogate mother because she felt...she felt that it was really a big tragedy for both of us.\nAnd...and we had a very sad summer, but actually did...uh...the whole world fall apart...fell\napart for us on September 1, 1939. I was sitting in my room and preparing actually myself to\ngo to school because I was supposed to go back to Vilno to continue study. And then my\nnanny came running into the room and said that my father wants to see us immediately in the\npharmacy. And me and my sister and my nanny were running, and my father said, \"Sit\ndown. The war broke out..broke...break...broke out. The Germans just invaded Poland, and\nwe don't know what to do...be, but don't think about going back.\" And then it started. It...1t\nstarted because the...the little town where I was belonged to Russia. I couldn't go back to\nVilno. I was sent..uh..to school in a...in a town called Oshmeyania where I was studying and\nmy sister stood with my father and this to...this was till 1940. 1940 during the vacation...\nuh...vacation time, I went back to Vilno and I stood in the house of my aunt. And I went to\nvisit my friends. This was really a very sad situation because the whole class fell apart when\nthe all 45 children, some went to one school that was teaching Pole...in Polish. The other\none... Vilno became a part of Lithuania. It was...uh...1t was very important for the Lithuanian\nto teach their children Lithuian...Lithuania so they had to teach Lithuanian and some of them\nwent to Russian school. And very...it was a big rumor and very, very soon on June 1941, we\nwere taken over by the Germans. When we were...we were taken over by the German, there\nwere...there were...we actually...the part that we were...were...at the Russian occupation, and\nthere was...uh...a truck standing 1n front of our pharmacy and there were Russian doctors that\nwere asking my father to join him and go back to Russia before the German occupied, but\nmy father said that in a war you have to have a roof under your head and he didn't want\nabandon it. And very soon the German came. I will never forget the...when the German came\nto the little town and right away, they segregated the Jews. They started to persecute Jews.\nThe Polish people were very belligerent, and they start a kind of pogrom, and one of the rich\nlandowners came to my father and said to him that you should, that he will be sent...some\npeople they would take our belongings and he will give us shelter...he will give us shelter in\nhis little...it was like not a big castle, but a small castle. And he said because he was very\ngood when the Communists persecuted him as a landowner in Russia. And my father and my\nsister went and I was sitting here with the other belongings. As it happened on the way, they\nwere attacked by Polish peasant who robbed my father, put him against a tree, shot him in\nfront of my sister, and my sister became hysterical. She was just a little, little girl there. They\nkind of let him go. And my father and my sister walked a long time and they came back and\nwe...we had to escape from there because the...the...not only...not only the German were after\nus, but the Polish peasants were after the Jews. And we..we took shelter in a Rabbi's house\nand my father arranged with a peasant, he took us to Vilno, as two little peasant girls to my\nAunt's house.",
        "Q: Tell us...tell us...can you describe that journey for us? Tell us...tell us what it was like for\nyou as a little girl escaping.",
        "A: Well, you know I will be Jewish so it was a very dangerous journey and we left very early.\nWe were put on a wagon and we were put ___. And we were told to sit quiet and he put\nsome hay over us. And nobody from the town knew that we were escaping. My father didn't\nwant to go with us. He wanted to stay yet because he didn't want to endanger our lives. So\nwe were...he left us on...just in the beginning of the town, and then in Vilno it was already a\ncurfew. The Jews...uh...were given all kinds of edicts. They couldn't walk. Uh...They had just\nto walk in the ___. They couldn't walk on the sidewalk. They had to have arm...arm bands\nwith the...uh...with the Jewish star, and they had arm bands in the front and in the back. They\nwere a certain time that they could home. All the jewelry and all the values the radio were\nconfiscated and every day, there were men taken to work and they never came back. So\nwhen I came to the outskirts from the Vilno, I...I knew where my aunt lived, but I didn't\nknow about all those things and to _ was very dangerous because I was walking on the\nsidewalk. But I didn't know how it happened, and when we...after a long, long journey, we\nfinally arrived to my aunt's house and she looked at us like we would come from the...from\nHell. She couldn't imagine that we came there. And then after a few days, my father came,\nalso came. And we stayed with...with my aunt til September 6th, 1941. This was the day it\nwas...the ghetto, Vilno ghetto was started. And I have to tell you the way the German\norganized the starting of Vilno ghetto. This was just amazing how much sadism and\norganization was involved in this. Vilno was a very cultural town and there were all kinds of\nlayers of society, but there were...there were _____. There were people that were\nassimilated. There were people that were very much pro-Israel. There were people that were\nvery much for...for Jewish culture. But there was one section that were poor Jewish people\nlived there. It was...the streets were.../ remember____\u2014\u2014_. It was in the ___ it was in the\ncenter of Vilno, and those Jews in the middle of the night were taken out from their homes\nand was taken in a place called Ponary. These are...Ponary is a big forest where mass graves\nstill are there. And they were shot right there, and they made...their poor dwellings were\nmade a place for the ghetto. So as I mentioned to you, 1t came a day when edict came and all\nthe Jews had to abandon their possessions, their apartments, their homes, and they were\ntaken to the ghetto. There were two ghettos. One...number 1 and number 2. The number 2\nghetto was liquidated in a very short time. When I say liquidated, all the people were taken\nagain to Ponary. Some of them were shot on the way, and some of them were shot in the\nmass graves. I happen to be in the second ghetto. When we came to the ghetto, it was a very\nterrible experience because we were carrying with us our meager possessions and the Poles\nlined up on the street and when they saw somebody of us wearing two coats, they used to\nsay, \"Aw, look at this Jew. She is...he is wearing two coats. Let's take one of them off.\" And\nthey would just grab and take it away, and there and nobody even interfered. The conditions\nin ghetto were terrible. One family was put on in...two or three families were put on one\nroom. The cold and the hunger and no sanitary conditions, and no facilities to cook. It was\njust...1t was just a very dark era in our lives. Uh... right away, the..the Germans put a wall and\nthere were gates and you could only go out from the ghetto if you had...1f you had a work\npermit. All you could only actually survive if you worked because the...the portions of\nthe...the Russians are very...very meager and people were very anxious to work. The...the...in\nthe ghetto inside, there were...Jews organized a Judenrat. This 1s...was a...this was actually\nlike...uh...uh...organization for Jews for social services, for...for helping each other, for\norganization and also they're the Jewish policeman that was standing by the ghetto. There\nwas a...uh...talking about me, I went one day to Judenrat because we had to survive and I\nwas lucky to get a job. There was a German asking young girls...put them...if they want to\nwork, put them into a column and we were...after a long walk, we find ourselves on the\nairport of Polobonic. And this airport of Polobonic our job was unload the wagons with big\nchunks of coal or potatoes or also wintertime we had to clean the airport. And we usually, we\nworked really very hard because the work was very long and the conditions for working was\nso bad there was always a German with..uh... how you call it? The one that who used the\nhorses. (laughing) standing behind you and you had to work and...and we really were\nmiserable. At night when we used to come to the gates...gates of ghetto, we were practically\nexhausted. But the only way we could help ourselves because we could steal a little potatoes\nfrom the wagons, and when we came we could cook them. And sometimes we had...we had\nthe chance to cook a little potato. We didn't have salt right there on the ___.\nThey...they...they used...they used to let us. My father got a job in the pharmacy of the\nJudenrat...of the Judenrat, was like a Jewish government because in the section of the ghetto\nthere was also a Jewish hospital and they had the pharmacy. My aunt worked in the hospital\nand my sister was just a little girl. And she...she doesn't even work and she was just very\nmiserable in...in the ghetto. She became actually smaller than she was, and when I used to\nbring a few potatoes it was a big treasure for her because the Russians were very meager.\nBut I have to tell you that there was a cultural life in Vilno ghetto. They were a lot of songs\nwritten, a lot of poems written. There was even a cafe. I never went there. There were...were\n____ theatres, and people really were trying to survive. Very soon, there was\nresistance...resistant organization formed. And those resistance young boys and girls became\nactive. It was a very friendly sign because you could get shot on a... but some how...some\nhow they functioned. And they were trying to get out as much as possible Jews from the\nghetto. But in order to get out from the ghetto and become a partisan and they were located\nin the Runigso and Narah forests. They...you had to have a gun and gun...a gun was very\nexpensive. When my family came to the...to the ghetto, we were very poor because\neverything was taken away from us. All of a sudden we found ourselves really without any\nfund...funds to survive. You could...for money, you could buy some food. You could buy\nsome clothes. We didn't...we didn't have it. So no matter how my father wanted us to escape\nto ...to the partisans, we had no means. I...after...uh... when...you want...there is a poem that\nwas written by one of the girls that used to walk everyday with me to the Polo barrack, and if\nyou wanted I can read it for you.",
        "Q: Read it.",
        "A: The poem is in Yiddish. And it...1t was written by...by a really...a little girl and she said like\nthis.",
        "Q: Tell us...1f you would, tell us what does the poem say in English. Can you translate it for us?",
        "A: Yes. The poem say it is enough. It is enough. Every day this...our shoes are walking on this\nhard cobblestone, and our...and our feet in the...in the shoes are getting very tired to...to go\nthose kind of distances, and we are walking and we are asking...we are asking, \"Has the\nworld forgotten about us?, and we are begging and saying, \"It is enough. It is enough. We\nhave no strength to walk in our shoes on those hard cobblestones.\"",
        "Q: Tell us about the girl who wrote this.",
        "A: This was...this was just a school girl that was very...uh...I don't...I am not sure if she wrote\nanything more, but she...I became very friendly with her and one morning when I came to\nwork she gave me a piece of paper and this here was the poem. I was very excited and I had\nall other little friends and ___ was the _____. And all of us when we had a chance, we\nwere sitting on this...on this tall, you know...uh...wagon full of stone...full of those big pieces\nof...uh...of...uh...big pieces of coal that we had to unload and we stopped and we were all\nreading this poem, and the German guard started to scream and yell at us, \"What are you\ndoing? What is kind of this?\" So right away we took this piece of paper and we put it inside\nyou know, and we were afraid because they were...they were just beating us up for no\nreason. But some how girls made copies of this poem and many times we used to walk, you\nknow, to work a bit and we used to recite it. And so in 1948, when I had a little...I came a\nlittle bit to myself, the first thing what I did I remembered the story...it was like written down\nin my heart. I wrote 1t down and I said, \"Let me remember this. How we used to walk to\nwork and we used to recite this poem because there 1s so much truth and so much pain and\nso much injustice asking, \"How come this injustice was done to us.\" I just like people to\nknow about it. Uh...I like to tell you about another very sad experience I had in ghetto. The\njob in ___ ended and I...one day I went again and they were asking people...the young girls,\nthe women...uh..for work. And I went there. And I was walking. I was very sad. And we\nwere walking a long time on this hard cobblestone. They were very narrow streets in my...in\nmy town. Everybody was just walking in a column in the middle. And then the column\nstopped and to my horror I saw that they stopped before the school that I used to spend and\nmy...that I used to study as a child. It was the gymnasium ____. It wasin___11.\nAnd this whole column was taken to a big...uh...a big...uh..cellar, full of old and rotten\npotatoes. And our job was to sort out the potatoes because this was...our school was taken\nover by the Nazis and they...actually 1t was the Gestapo and they...all the classrooms and all\nthe facilities were taken over, and they made offices. When I first came there, my first\ninstinct was to just...forget about everything, and just run up to the classroom when I spent\nmy...my childhood. And it was such a ___ experience I had an impulse and I ran out from\nthe column and the German right away took me back and gave me over my back, I came\nhome with a...a red sign all over and I was sitting right there and he told us to sort out the\npotatoes. As I was...uh..coming every day, I met the janitor from our school and the janitor\nhad two daughters. And would you believe that the first...the two daughters knew me as a\nchild because I sat at this school as a 6 years old and I went til 1939, so they knew me every\nday. They used to help me with my galoshes. In the bad weather I used to share with them\nmy lunch. And the first thing when they saw me, they said to me, \"My God. I heard that all\nof you were dead. How come you're still alive?\" They said their goodbye. This were their\nhello that I had from them. And we were working there, and also I met there one of my\nprofessors. My prof...his name was Professor Moderstain. He actually...he was working\nthere, tending to some chickens. He was my favorite teacher, and I don't think his mind\nworked alright. First of all, he didn't recognize me when I approached him. It was dangerous\nto approach a man because we were segregated. Women and men were segregated, but I\napproached him. And he was...and he was just talking to himself and then I was told that he\nsaw his wife, his daughter, and his son shot in front of his eyes. So this was the only time that\nI saw him there. And imagine seeing this professor just sitting there and actually dancing,\ntending to some chickens. I...uh...I developed...one day when I was working and I didn't have\nshoes, I developed an infections. And when I came to the ghetto door, it was already late at\nnight, I stepped on a...on a nail and the nail was rusted and the infection backed up, all the\nway up and I was...I got in my groin, I called a big boil and my father and my aunt saw it,\nthey took the right away to the hospital. I was operated on and I was... was in the hospital.\nIn the meantime, when I was in the hospital I saw my father taken out from the pharmacy\nbecause the situation in ghetto became very dangerous. There were three kinds of workings\npapers in the ghetto. There was blue, yellow, and pink. The yellow one was a permit to work.\nThe pink one was a permit for the children for the family of the working and the blue one\nwas a temporary working paper. And many times in the ghetto, the Germans used to come in\nthe middle of the night and they used to take out the people just for no reason and we never\nsaw them again. People used to develop secret rooms, and once I was sitting in a secret room\nin a attic and I heard Jews being...being taken to...uh...to Ponary and I heard with my own\nmusic, violins playing. Because the Germans didn't want the...the people to panic or they\ndidn't want them to...to escape or to resist them so they kind of put music...some musician in\nfront of the column and this way they sooth their nerves and I heard...I heard the music. I\nwas always thinking in case they will find me I...I and my sister we have to go by the side,\nand we have to escape. We have to escape. We have to somehow run to the partisan. I\ndon't... don't want to be taken to Ponary. Because we knew what this was going on. That\nthere were people were just shot and also we heard about the crematoria and we heard also\nabout people from other places being taken to concentration camp. It...1t was very strong\nrumor in the ghetto.",
        "Q: You talked about a secret room. How did you get into this secret room?",
        "A: As I told you, the dwellings in the ghetto were very old and there were mainly secret...many\npassages and many rooms that men used to put very heavy commodes or a big\ndressing...uh...piece of furniture and camouflage the door and behind the door there was a\nlittle room or a cellar or a attic and people used to just sit there all the time when the\nGermans, the Ukrainians, or the Lithuanians used to run to the ghetto and take anybody.\nAnybody! Able body! And they used to just take them quote unquote to work, but we no,\nnever saw them again. One of my uncles was taken this way. I forgot...I...just before, if I may\ncome back. I forgot something if I may come back. On the day that we were taken to the\nghetto...talking about my uncle. My Uncle Joseph Perski was a merchant who..who traded in\nfresh and dried mushrooms, and had the last connections with Polish peasants and he\ndoesn't...didn't look like a Jew. On the day that we were taken to the ghetto, he called my\nAunt Sonia, and he told her that he is not going to the ghetto. He has a lot of connections and\nhe will try to survive as an Aryan, and he asked her to join him. And she refused. She said to\nhim she cannot do it because she promised my mother on her death bed that she will take\ncare of me and my sister, and she cannot abandon them. So she asked him to take us. He\ncouldn't. Because it was just...my father was also...my father looked very Jewish. We looked\nJewish. He couldn't do it. So my mother...my mother...my second mother, my Aunt Sonia\nsacrificed her life for us because she refused to join him and she went to the ghetto with us.\nAnd she was like the pillar of strength for us. I would like to continue now about the last\ndays of the ghetto.",
        "Q: Hold it. This is a good place to pause, but before we do that we had been talking about the\nsecret room.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Uh...I'd like to know how you go into a secret room.",
        "A: I got in the secret room because a friend of my father that used...that lived in the same\napartment came...approached him one day and said that he and a few men found a place and\nthey would like...they would like us also to join there. When they will...when they will hear\nthere is a big commotion, and they are looking for men, my father should come right away\nfrom the hospital and we should all meet in the secret room. And the secret room was just\nbehind a very tall...tall dresser. And you couldn't find it because they ...they....they used to go\ninto the room, and the men used to put the dresser against the door and we would just sit\nthere very, very quiet and listen for all the noises and...and then when everything's quiet\ndown, a few hours later we would come out and then we will hearing crying. This mother\nwas taken away and this father was taken away and this...and this is how...you see, and this is\nhow the German was liquidating the ghetto. I have to tell you there is a very interesting story\nabout the man in charge of the Vilno ghetto. Her name...his name was Jacob Genz. Jacob\nGenz was an officer in the Lithuanian army, married to a Christian Lithuanian, and he had a\nson with her. And when he became a commandant of the Vilno ghetto, he surrounded\nhimself with a lot of policeman and officers that were Jews that escaped from Poland and\nwere officers in the Polish army. They were all dressed as officers and they kind of were\nkeeping peace and order inside the ghetto. Genz in my opinion did a lot of good for the\nJewish population because he developed a certain rapport with the Germans. I remember\nthere was...the commandant, the German commandant of the Vilno ghetto was called Weiss\nand he was an SS man, Gestapo and the...the commandant of the guard was Malver. When\nMalver was standing by the gates of ghetto, there was a massacre because he was just\nbeating up people that were coming from work. Some of the people that came from outside\ntried to smuggle in some food, some a piece of bread, a potatoes, something to...to help their\nfamilies in ghetto. They were starving. If he found somebody, he would just beat up. There\nwere shootings. He was a living horror. And somehow he developed a rapport with them,\nand when they used to come to him and each time ask for more people, more people, he used\nto pacify them and he used to help. Help to maintain the stability of the ghetto. Very...very\nsoon before the liquidation of the ghetto, the resistance started to send...to print all kinds of\nleaflets. Jews, the end is near. Don't go to the slaughter. You have to fight with what you can.\nIf you don't have a gun, fight with ever...with a stone, with a knife, with ever you can. We\nwill not survive anyhow, but we have to be resistant. But ...but people were brainwashed by\nthe Germans, and really everybody was so involved in days of this struggle and was so weak\nand was...was so embroiled in this one thing, to survive that unfortunately inside the ghetto,\nthere was not too much resistance when the time came. And I...",
        "Q: Excuse me. We're going to pause here and we're going to change tapes.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: One more question about the secret room and then we'll go on.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When you were in the secret room, you told us about...that you heard people being taken to\nPonary. Can you tell me what you actually saw?",
        "A: Well, I...me and my sister, we were lying on the floor and there was just a little...a little\nopening. It was an attic and between the old wood, there was a very small opening. You\nreally had to look with one eye because we were very afraid that we will be noticed. And\nwhen I heard this music, this fiddle playing, I...I got very excited. I didn't know what\nkind...what kind of fiddle playing, so I put my eye to it and I saw fiddler playing in the\nfront...1n the front of the column and man, women and children were taken in columns, taken\nout through the streets of the ghetto, going toward the gates. And I with my own eyes\nheard...saw the people taken there. Women were crying. The women were carrying little\nchildren, and they were just...and I head the music and many times in my nightmares, I hear\nthe music they were playing. And they were just walking very slowly toward the gate of\nghetto, and the only way to...where they were taken...this was just only one direction, was\nPonary. This was the only...the only place they were taken. And I heard...there was a woman\nthat escaped from there. When I was in the hospital, she escaped from there and she was in\nthe hospital, and she was telling us that they were told to...to make their own graves, and\nthey were shot indiscriminately. The only way she survived because there were so many\nbodies on top on her she wasn't shot, and then she crawled in the middle of the night and she\ngot...put...just went from one place to another and she...she didn't know what to do so she\ncame back to the ghetto. There were a lot of people that actually didn't believe her, but I with\nmy own ears I saw this woman. I heard that she lost her mind later on...uh...because when\nshe was talking about it, she was in tremendous shock. But I...this what I heard that she lost\nher mind and she was just babbling away later on. I don't know what happened to her. But\nthis was...I heard and saw her when I was in the hospital.",
        "Q: Okay. Thank you. Tell us about the liquidation of the Vilno ghetto. What happened to you?",
        "A: Uh...I was in the hospital and I...I had this big...b1g inflammation and I...since my physical\nconditions was very poor, I had this big opening that did...was full of pus and didn't...didn't\nheal. And so I was really...my prognosis were really very bad, but...uh...one day it was a few\ndays...must be before the liquidation to the Vilno Ghetto, my aunt who was a nurse came\ninto my room and she said that she heard rumors that the German gave against our\ncommandant, you know, to mark them that they need more Jews. So possibly for work. And\nhe decided instead of giving young, able bodies, he will take us all the sick people from the\nhospital and just to have the count. So she..she told me she'll help me to get dressed and in\nthe middle of the night, we left the hospital and it is just one of the things all of a sudden\n[...1.... walked and we went to our place where we...where she...where we were living, and\nshe started to take care of her...herself of me. And she was changing the bandages and in...in\na few days, it was September 23, 1943, in the middle of the night we were waken up by...by\na friend of ours that always took us to the secret place to the Malini, and he said that even\nour father is not with us, he will take care of us and he want us to go with him because he\nheard from a friend that is a policeman, a Jewish policeman that this...this is the..the morning\nthat they will take out all the Jews from Vilno Ghetto. I just wanted to point out that the\nVilno Ghetto had not only just from Vilno. There were...there were people from all over\nbecause in 1942, all the small ghettos around Vilno were liquidated. Means that the Jews\nwere taken out and a lot of people escaped and settled down, so there was...was a big\nconglomeration of people in the Vilno...in the Vilno ghetto. But this...uh...the morning\nwhen...when the liquidation came, there was a just such a eerie feeling in the air. You could\nsmell death. You could smell despair. You could smell helplessness. We were sitting 1n this\nroom and between me and my sister and my aunt, we just had one little head of green\ncabbage. This were our provisions. And the man said that if we will survive that he will take\nus out and we will go someplace you know...uh...to...to some peasants to look shelter, even\nthe Lithuanian were very anti-Semitic. And then all of a sudden, there was this banging in\nthe big door. The big piece of furniture, the commode, was pushed away and Ukrainian,\nLithuanian, Polish, and a few Gestapo ran to the room and told us all, \"Go out. Go out.\" And\nthe Russian, the actual the Ukrainian were yelling, \"Give us your...uh...give us your watches.\nGive us your jewelry.\" And in Russian, the watch...the watch is ___. So they were\nscreaming, \"Give us your __.\"\". And they were pushing us on the street. There is nothing\nwe could do. On the streets were pandemonium. The few...the families started to be\nseparated. The men were put in one column. The...the women were put in another column.\nThe children were...were separated from their parents and there was such a intimidation that\nyou just...you were...you were just had to look down. You couldn't even look up like a\nperson after. Of course, all of us had those...had those bands and very slowly, we started to\nmove out from the ghetto. I was walking my...with...my...my aunt was in the middle. My\nfather wasn't with...not with us. I was...my aunt was in the middle and my sister was from\none side and I was from the other side. As we were passing through the gates of ghetto, we\nturned around and this was the last time that I saw my town. And this was the last time that\n[...that I actually...this was the last time that I actually saw the streets and of my childhood,\nso this was the end of my childhood. From this time, I became an adult. As we were passing\nthe...the gates, my aunt had a beautiful voice. And I don't know...she walked like in a trance.\nAnd all of a sudden she started to sing this not loud, but sing, and we heard...what she was\nsinging this song Vilno. It...1 remembered always her singing us lullabies and all those happy\nsongs. She sang in Russian, in Polish, but she was just going there and the fist was coming\ndown and she was singing the song of Vilno. You want me to read it for you?\nIt...1t was written...1t was written in Vilno ghetto. And it...the music 1s by _____\u2014\u2014\u2014_ and it\ngoes like this.\nYou want me to translate it? It says, Dear Le Vilno. Our town that we are born. Our...our\ndreams and our desires all went...only have and say your name. When they only have your\nname on our lips, we...we have to cry. We remember the...the Vilno streets, the\nVilno...uh...uh...rivers. The River was Vilier. The Vilno forests and the Vil...and the\nVilno...uh...Mountains. And we are...we are dreaming about you and we are thinking about\nyou and we cannot forget the old times.\nAnd as we were walking, we...kept the ___ very tight and we actually didn't know where\nwe walked. And then after walking for a long time, we came to that ___ Cemetery. The\nfirst thing that we saw when we came to the ___ Cemetery, by the gate there were three\nyoung bodies hanging. There was a young girl and two boys. We found out there were\nmembers of the Vilno Resistance that would hang there. It was a windy day and the body\nwas just...just going back and forth in the wind. It was such a eerie, eerie feeling and I...I..I\ncould smell the death. I could smell...I...I could smell all them...the sorrow of the world. And\nwe were...the...the col...after the passage, the columns stopped and they were just a column\nof women and we heard rumors that there will be a selection. And the selection to the right to\nlive, and selection to the left to die. To the right, just young able bodies; and to the left are\nwomen with children, sick people and old people. My Aunt Sonia was only in her early 40s,\nbut she looked very old and my little sister was then just 11 years old, but she looked much,\nmuch young, so my Aunt took off her shoes from...that had a little heel and she put them on\nmy sister. She should look a little bit...uh...taller, and she kind of took her brow and put it\nin...she should look, she should look grownup. And I...I saw people there wondering around\nin a daze. It...it was...there was a child there crying and one of their sisters was holding her\nby the hand and he says he was looking for his mother. There were women just tearing their\nhair out, sitting right there. And the column started to move. Then it came to a stop. And we\nsaw SS men dressed in the...in the black uniforms, with that hat. They had the special hat\nwith the...with the insig...insignia. The insignia was like...uh...a school, a...a cross, with those\nred swastikas, with those big barking dogs. Those dogs were barking so loud and they were\nsuch a big police dogs. I...I see them before me. They are like grey and black, and they are\nalarming and they were...and the...the Germans, the Gestapo, they were armed. They were\narmed with real rifles. And then the selection begun. They were...they were just pushing\npeople left and right. And all of sudden...I don't know how it happened...I find myself, my\nsister on the right, and my aunt was not with us. So I ran back to the assistant and I spoke\nwith this SS man very good German. I started to plead with him. I want to go to my mother.\nSo he took out the other side of the carbine, you know, of the rifle and he beat on me and he\npushed me away to the right. I fell on the floor and he was yelling, \"You go and you have to\nwork for the fatherland.\"____\u2014\u2014\u2014sd[ waa devastated. I...I did...I couldn't imagine that\nwe were separated from my aunt. And all of a sudden I found my other aunt...my other Aunt\nEsther that was my mother's sister. She some...she was even eld...older...uh...older than my\naunt, but somehow they...she went through and she was there, right there...with my cousin.\nHer name was Lena. And also with her daughter-in-law. Her name was Malisha. She was\nfrom Lodz. And she embraced me and she took me in and they started to calm me down. I...I\nwas really hysterical, beside myself, and somehow very soon after this, they ...they started to\nload us into the cattle trains. And on this...those cattle trains were we...when we were loaded\nwe were pushed...we didn't even have a place where to sit down. There were a very big vat,\nyou know, beer... with water and some disinfectant in the center. And we just had to stay\naround there because we couldn't even squat. The...this..1n the center was supposed toilet, but\nthe...we didn't have water. We didn't have bread. We didn't have anything. And I really I was\nso desperate and so beside myself I don't recall now how long were we...we traveled. But all\nof a sudden, we heard the wagons stopped. The whole time they didn't let us out. We...we\nstopped and we were some kind of a railroad station. It was dark at night. It was full of SS\nmen, the same dress, the same dogs, and there were all kinds of guards. And they were\nvery...a lot of lights, reflectors. You know what is a reflector? That was just shining at us\nand we were pushed and we told to unload. And I realized with my sister and my cousin that\nwe were in a concentration camp. And it was the Kalstra concentration camp near Riga. And\nI don't know if it was imagination, but I smelled some burning. And in my imagination we\nwere... mean not my imagination...my mind, I felt that we are taking to the crematoria. I\ndon't know from where, women guards appeared. This woman guards were really\nsomething. They were very strong women, blonde, barrel chested and with long boots and all\nof them had to...what you had to the horses, how you call it?",
        "Q: Whips.",
        "A: Whips. All of them were whips. And they told us right away to line up and to get undressed.\nNaked! You know, one, you are only a person as soon...as long as you have your clothes on.\nYou can be a professor. You can be a doctor. You can be a scientist. You can be a\nshoemaker. But as long...as soon as your clothes come up and you stand naked, you are lost.\nYou are not a humanbeing anymore. This is what I cannot...what I cannot forgive the\nGermans that they...they took off our...systematically take...took away our dignity. But\nundressing us, many of the girls were young girls. They were virgins. They never saw their\nparents naked, never saw their mothers naked, but all of a sudden we...we have to go and get\nundressed. We were taken to...to the...to someplace. They said that they are taking out us to\nbath, to a general bath, a general bath. I remember holding my little sister by the hand and\nwe were sharing a shower and I was saying goodbye to her because I was sure that the gas\nwill come out any moment. And I...i1t was talking to her to sooth her out because she was\nvery afraid, and I was telling her, \"Don't worry. Mama...Mama is looking for us from\nHeaven.\" And we were standing there. I was just like saying goodbye and then all of\nsudden, the water appeared. And then we realized that we are not in the crematorium, but we\nare just...they are rooms where we washed. And then you know who went to a series\nexamination with the doctors. The doctors were so brutal. They were so...they were...they\nwere so sadistic, and half were...and undressed and all the...we found ourselves outside that\nwe had to line up. Line up again and there were all kinds of big piles of...of clothing and big\npile of shoe and big...so we had to go and choose our dresses or our shoes and...and they told\nus to get dressed and we were taken to barracks. I was in a way lucky because I didn't think\nI'll survive too long. There were some of my friends were taken to work in...they called it the\n_______. This is where they were sorting out the...the dresses I think, but I was taken to\ndinner worker. A German came, a few German and they were selecting women and me and\nmy sister were selected. And they take...took us to the labor camp. It was Dinnerwork. We\nwere unloaded. I think it was on trucks. And we were taking to Dinnerwork. Dinnerwork, it\nwas a labor camp ran by the Toad organization. This was a construction organization and all\nthe guards there were middle aged Germans that were not taken to the Russian, were not\ntaken to the army. In Dinnerwork, there was a big mixture all kind of people that were\nworked there as slaves. This was slave...slave labor. We met...uh...POWs from Holland that\nwere very nice. They were young boys that helped us a lot. And we were taken to some\nbarracks and as strange as it will sound to you, after the ghetto and in car survived, we found\nourselves quite comfortable in Dinnerworker because first of all, we had water. Each of us\nhad a bed to sleep, and we also...the...the Russians were much, much better and we kind of\nstraighten out ourselves because all...from the young girls became little old women. In\nthe...1n Dinnerworker I was in room number 4. There were maybe 40, 50 women in one\nroom. And they were....and we were separated by a very heavy door from the men. The\ncommandant from the...from the whole camp was a German obert...we called him\noberstrumfuhrer. And he was...he was a married German. Very tall, and with children, very\ntall and cute. I remember him walking with...with tall...tall boots and we were lucky. He\nbecame very friendly with one of the German...with our inmate, a Jewish girl. She was a\nJewish girl from Berlin, and she was a cabaret singer. She was a real beauty. You couldn't\nfind where her legs start and finish. She was all legs. She spoke half and half German. And\nhe fell in love with her. He took her out from the room. She was in my room, and he gave\nher a separate room and he gave her special clothes. She...she was wearing high boots and\nlike the...the uniforms...the coats when you wear when you ride, a riding habit. And she kind\nof...kind of had a very good influence on him. He was playing with fire because if a German\nwas not supposed to socialize with a Jewish girl, but this was a closed compound and he was\nin charge...in charge there, and he adjusted his life for it. But if there was any time any\nproblems, we could always support her and she was trying to sooth it. And she was\nexcellent...excellent barrier for us, between us and him. He became much more mellow. It\nwasn't...it was not a paradise. Every morning at dawn, it was still dark, 1t was bells so we had\nto get up and we had to...we had to line up. It was called the appell, in German the appell. I\ndidn't mention that every day that we were in Kalsea, we had to go to the appell also. And\nevery day we were counted. There was no possibility for us to escape, but every day we were\ncounted like sheep. Anyhow, there was...uh...uh...we... we...we would get up in the morning\nand we would work. We worked very hard in Dinnerworker. We were working on\nconstructions and we were...we were pushing very, very heavy wagons with sand. We\nwere...uh...passing....we had to line up and work with...uh...those...how you call those...but\nyou build...uh...build a house...uh...I'm a little nervous. I forgot. You know how you call it?\nWhen you build a house, the ____ pieces, how you call it? Uh...Anyhow, we worked with\nconstructions and when...by the end of the day we were exhausted. But the truth, by the end\nof the day when we came we had to place there to ourselves. And we...we...we had a place\nwhere to sleep. We had a special, distinct clothing. We had pants and a jacket and on...on the\nfront and on the back of the clothing, there were white, wide rings and on the sides of the\npants, there were white...white stripes. So it was a precaution we shouldn't escape, because\nthere were some workers that used to come, ___ used to come there and they used to go\nout. And my sister was told to...to work for the Gestapo commander...uh... that was in charge\nof the gate and she had to go there every morning and clean his house and also do his\nlaundry. And after a...a...awhile, she got very sick. She developed rheumatism, but 1t was a\nvery special rheumatism that affects your heart, and..",
        "Q: Rheumatic fever?",
        "A: Rheumatic fever. And she was...and she was kept in...in a small place. It was a...like if you\nhad a coat or whatever, you could stay there a day or two. But if you stayed 3 days, you were\ntaken out and this was goodbye. Shot! When she was taken there in charge of this...this was\ncalled in Germany ___ Revere. This...you know, it was a German doctor that had a\ndaughter the same age and she looked like my sister. The German doctor kind of felt sorry\nfor her, and he used to steal medicine from the SS man. He used to give her the medicine and\nhe let her stay there. She was for there may 3, 4 weeks, which was very...was just unusual.\nThis is just a human interest story that I am telling you. And he was just taking care of her.\nAnd he...he told her that she reminded him of his little daughter. Now, there was...there was\na cultural life in Dinnerwork. A very good friend of mine that working as...as a shoemaker\nfrom all the things they were told. He was a shoemaker and was fixing German boots. At\nnight, he used to write poetry, and she used to...we used to recite the poetry. And even she\nwrote a song. The song...the song is called Dinnerworker. Do you want me to...to sing it?\nThe words are...are by...by my friend.",
        "Q: What is her name?",
        "A: Her...her name was Tosha. She didn't survive. She was just a little girl, but she was a real,\nreal poet. For her to write a poem was just nothing. It was just bubbling out of her. She\nwould...wherever she was, she was going with scraps of paper and she was...she was just\nwriting. She was from Lodz, and she and her parents and sister escaped in 19...in 1940 from\nLodz and they escaped. There were a lot of people...Polish Jews that escaped from Vilno...to\nVilno. Some the Germans. We called them the ____, because they were running away from\nthe Germans and because the German came up and to us 3 years later in 41, a lot of them\nstarted a new life in Vilno. When, unfortunately, when the ghetto was organized, she...she\ncame to the ghetto and she was together with us. And the...the melody is from a Russian\nsong. And this 1s...this is a really...this is a really beautiful song that tells a lot about the\nconditions in Dinnerworker. But goes on and on, but I wanta just tell you, it tells...uh...it tells\nus that in Dinnerworker, were an island surrounded by waters and forests and there are Jews\nfrom all the world that work very hard and are constantly freezing in the cold weather. In the\nmorning, it is still dark, but the bell rings and we have to go out, stand up and go to work.\nAnd we are asking the world why are the Jews punished? For...for what things? For whose\nthings are Jews being punished? We used to....we used to sing this all the song that goes on\nand on, and there were...there is also another poem about the dress...the dress that we\nwear...wear, We were wearing. In each and every poem, there is also a poem that\ndescribes...this is called advertising and it describes how the young girls work very hard to\nearn their meager portion of...of the bread and water that they are getting. And they are...the\nonly thing that they hope that one day will come that they will walk with themselves in their\nown land. So they are very poignant and very...very sad, revealing poems. Also there is a\npoem called The Spring, where a young girls were sitting and waiting for the Spring to\ncome. Spring 1s such a nice...nice month, but not for us because our freedom is taken away.\nWe don't lose our hope that one day we will be free, but in the meantime, we feel that the\nwhole world around us forgot us. I Just wanted...to people to know that those people, those\ngirls, those young women that were there were living and breathing one thing. Freedom and\nsurvival. Their spirit was so strong. Their bodies were very weak. But there was something\nin them that just didn't let them die. I have to tell you now about something that happened in\nDinnerworker which is really remarkable. We had guards all over. One of the guards was a\nyounger German, and each and every room had...had a Jewish woman that was in charge.\nAnd in one of the rooms...this was room number 3....was...1n charge was a Mrs. Schwartz.\nShe was little older than us because she was married at this time already. She was not a\nbeauty, but a very clever woman. And somehow, I don't know how, this young German\nguard fell in love. And every night, they used to talk for hours and hours. And we couldn't\nunderstand this what he saw in her, but this was...and he used to bring her special food. She\nwas very good. She used to share it with other girls. Yes. And one day came and there were\ntrucks standing in front of our...the building that we were kept, and they said they...they need\nwomen to...uh...labor camp. It was called __, and they working something with\nelectric...electricity...electric lamps, something. And between those that were taken was also\nMrs. Schwartz. Mrs...of course, this guard was beside himself, and he went right with there,\nwith her. Not officially, but he went as a guard with them. When...we were told. I wasn't...I\ndidn't see it, but I was told that when they came there, there was a selection and since Mrs.\nSchwartz was a little older, she was taken in a truck and this man...this guard knew that she\nwas taken to be shot. When he saw her being taken away, he shot himself: So this was one\nthe remarkable story. We stayed in Dinnerworker til one day...one day I think it was already\nin 1944, they told...they all loaded us into a big boat, and they took us across the Baltic Sea.\nIt was near Danzig, in East Russia, and when we came to a place, this was some kind of a\nport. After a voyage of 3 or 4 days on the big boat, on the big...uh..boat, we were taken with\nbarrages to a different concentration camp. The concentration camp was Tutorial. It was in\n1944. When we were...to describe Stutthof, it take...1t can take a week. I tried to be\nvery...if...1f there is a misery there was Stutt...there was Stuffhof. The barracks were terrible.\nThe food in the morning they used to give us a slice of black bread and a little bit hot water,\nblack. Since we didn't have water to wash our head, we used this...this water to wash our\nhair. Uh...During they day they used...they used to bring a very big pot, tremendous pot like\nthe pot sometimes you used the pet. You used the pet and to wash to do their wash them in\nthe...and it was full with black water, many times cold with turnips half cooked. And\nthey...this was our...this was what they will give us to eat, and after they finished the...the\nwomen guards would finish to distribute this meager rations. Since we were so hungry, we\nused to crawl with the head to...to scrap some food on the bottom, and the German used to\nstand and laugh. We were surrounded with...uh...electric wire and with so many men and\nwomen just fall on the electric wires. I saw it. They committed suicide. Men they separated\nfrom you. We saw there Hungarian women. We saw there that were brought because it was\nalready 44, we saw the...we saw the...we saw all kinds of nationalities...Jewish nationalities.\nAnd those German guards were so bad, so sadistic, so cruel that I just don't have the words to\ndescribe. One day they called us out...they put us...1t was cold...1n appell. We had to stand up,\nand they said that young women will be taken to a labor camp. My sister then was...was in\nbig danger, and when she passed near the German, he asked her...I told her to stand with\nherself out and show that she had a big bust, and I put some...something into her breast. And\n\"How old you are?\" And she said, \"I am 18.\" Uh...He...he...she went through, but it was\nsuch a traumatic experience for me that I cannot...because my mind already said goodbye to\nher. And also the first time in Stutthof, I saw those stripes because those striped uniform and\nwe very anxious to get them because we were very cold. We didn't...we had very thin\ndresses. We didn't have shoes. My legs were frostbitten, and those uniforms were kind...but\nthey...they didn't give us at this time. And really at the strangest sound they would help us to\nfight the cold. Very shortly, after we left Stutthof, a big epidemic of typhus broke out there.\nMy aunt and my cousin died right there in the epidemic. My cousin-in-law survived\nthis...this epidemic, and I met her after the libera...liberation, but just the moment when I was\nseparated from my aunt from there, it was a...took so much of the spirits because\nthey...my...my...they didn't want to go because my aunt...then she was in her 40s looked\nolder. They knew that she will not accept it, and she didn't go. Finally, we were brought to\nStuttgart labor camp. Oh, it was...Stutthof labor camp was a camp...a camp that we really\nworked very, very hard because facilities were miserable. We didn't have the proper\nclothing. We were really freezing, and we worked very hard. We were working in the forest.\nAnd we also were building trenches. And every day, every day there were girls just dying.\nThey were falling like flies. Any...any little infraction, they were beaten. They get like 20\nlashes, 25 lashes and...on their behind, and since they were so malnourished, those slashes\njust were full of pus. They never healed and those girls never, never recovered. We was at a\nplace called ___ Revere. And it...and a Hungarian woman doctor was in charge with there.\nShe was helping whatever she could, but there was so little that she could do. Every day\nwhen we came from work, I was going to her and I developed very big...very big sores on\nmy legs, very bad circulation, and she would help me. Because if they would...the German\nwould see myself, they will shot me. And I was...I am soever grateful with her, and by\ncoincidence, I met her after the liberation and she was very instrumental to my survival. I\nwill tell you about this later. After we'd stayed 1n..in Stuttgart a long time, one day was the\nday that I will never forget it. It was a day before the Yom Kippur. I was not from a\nrelig...religious family, and I am not...was really not observant, but there were a lot of\nwomen that were very observant. And they kind of knew when...I don't know how because\nwe had no...no papers, no picture. We had nothing. No identification. And right there\nnext...next bed to us was a woman that was...was an aunt of a friend of mine, and she was a\npatient of my mother. She was from...she was one of those people that my mother helped,\nthat she was not of the wealthy ones. And she...when she saw us in Stuttgart, in the labor\ncamp, she kind of took care of us because she was very lucky. She worked...worked in the\nkitchen. And whatever scraps she was bring...she was bring at night. She would be shot if\nthey would find her because if a girl went out from the line and she picked up a frozen\nturnip, that was...that was sent to ____. She was shot right there. But she shot and my friend\nas we were walking in the dark because it was in end of September. It was already very dark\nin the morning, maybe 4, 5 o'clock in the morning, she told us...my aunt told me that you are\ninvited. You will fast tomorrow, and tonight you are invited. She's preparing a little\ncelebration, something to eat. So we were very...we were very excited because you know\nwhat this food, a piece of bread, black bread, this... And as we working, a rumor spread...the\nwomen that were religious, told our guard that they would like to finish work a little earlier\nbecause tomorrow is the day of atonement. It's a very big day. And do you know that the\nguards kept us this night longer than usual. They were harsher to us. They gave us more\nlashes and when we came home we were so tired that we couldn't even eat. We were just\nover exhausted. We were just happy that you could lie down and stretch out. I didn't go to\nthe ___. I didn't do nothing. The next day in Kippur, we went to work with nothing. I was\njust telling you how people treated people, and I don't want this to be forgotten, what the\nhumanbeing can do to a humanbeing. Very soon after this, a rumor started to spread that the\nGermans are in retreat, and a very big thing developed right there in Stuttgard between those\nguards. Those guards were real SS men with those black things. And they took us out and\nthey took...and they took us on...I...we call it the death march. They were taking us one side\nto another and sometimes, we were taken from one direction and we saw other people,\nprisoners, concentration camp, Polish people, Jews, taken from the other side. At...we used\nto walk endless, endless times, and we didn't have shoes. We...we matter of fact had those\nwooden shoes that...that really were...were...you couldn't walk on the snow with it, because\nthe snow was just going there and you used to walk like a circus performer, and used to\nform. And at night, they used to put us in a big barn without food. They used to occupy a big\nbarn of a Polish peasant, a German peasant. It does...wasn't a act in East Prussia. In the\nmorning we had to...to straighten ourselves, put ourselves in a column. They will count us.\nAnd we will go forwards. And one day when we came to a...to a place, one of these guards\ngot bezerk. He put us straight in a column and he just started to shoot discriminately. A\nwoman that was standing near me...she was standing here; I was standing here. My sister\nwas shot. I lost my sister. And I didn't know what happened. After they...he...he was\nsubdued, there were a lot of bodies just lying around, and I was besides myself looking for\nmy sister, and after awhile, we found ourselves. She...she escaped, and I...she was running\nand I was running, and we found ourselves and we started to smell death. We were really\nsmelled death. And this march...they called the death march, was something undescribable\nbecause we were walking and sleeping. The last night we walked the whole day and the\nwhole night and we closed our eyes and we were sleeping. The night before we were put in a\nbig barrack, and I practically gave up. Because I was so exhausted and was so tired that I\ntold my sister that...there was a lot of hay. We were sitting in the hay, that we were go into\nthe hay and wait...and wait for them that the Germans should come, they should walk away,\nand we will just die very peaceful lying in the hay. But when they came out and they\ncounted, they realized that a few women were missing, so the Polish peasant came with a\nGerman and he looked in the barn, and they were poking and as they poked...they poked and\nthey found us. And I was begging the German guard, the SS man, to shot me because I\ncouldn't go. And he pushed me and he says to me, \"You are too young to die and...and\nstraighten yourself out,\" and pushed me to the column. This...this...I was there. And I am\ntelling you and this...this I memory stick out, written in my soul even after so many years.\nWe started to walk, and we were a group of young girls that were very close..close together.\nWe...we actually supported ourselves. The girl that wrote the poem and my little friend, the\ngirl that her mother...her aunt was the cook, we kind...we...we had like a kind of coalition,\nand we knew the only way we can survive if we will stay in the front. Because if you were\nstaying in the back and you couldn't walk with the column, you were just shot. And then I\nsaw young girls walk and walk and all of a sudden they became like frozen. Straighten their\nlegs, and sit and they were just like frozen monuments, falling right with their face on the\nsnow. The German didn't have to shot them. This is how they fell. One of my friends started\nto feel bad, and we took her and I was from one side and another of my friend and we were\ndragging her, practically dragging her. She couldn't help. Legs were frozen. So the guard\nnoticed it. He...he...he told the column to stop. He took her to a certain field, and we heard\nthe shot. He shot her right there. (Crying) And then he send out another girl. She should take\noff...she had a little coat...a little warm coat on her which was very unusual. She should take\nit off and take it to herself. So this girl, she didn't know her, but the will was survival was so\nstrong, she took it...her off, and she put it and she couldn't stand it. But she didn't know. She\nwanted to survive. What can you do? Many times in the night when I...I get up...I wake\nmyself up screaming and I see those young girls, frozen, falling on the snow. This is\nsomething undescribable. The...here on the cheeks, they were red, and they were just sticks.\nThis is something that whoever wasn't there cannot believe it. And when I talk to you I think\nI'm telling you something that happened to somebody else because I cannot believe that I\nwent through it and then lived to tell. It was March 11, 1945. We came to a place called\nKruma. It was East Prussia. It was a small town. As we walked in there, there was a\ntremendous barn. I never saw anything like it, and all of us were put into this barn. In this\nbarn, we met people from all the nationalities. There were men also. And...and the barn was\nsurrounded by Gestapo, and as we were looking through the doors and actually the doors\nwere a little open...there were no windows, we saw the Gestapo putting out little...twigs,\naround the barn. They wanted to burn. It was decided that they didn't know what to do with\nus anymore, and they wanted to hold up...there were thousands of people there. All kinds of\nlanguages that spoke...spoken. And we were just sitting there, and all of a sudden, it was in\nthe morning, March 11, 1945, that we heard a big commotion, and somebody started to\nscream, \"The Russian are coming.\" And we didn't find one German. I don't know. They\ndisappeared. The German guard disappeared. I was afraid to run out. I was sitting. And\nthen...my friends started to scream and yell, 'The Russians are coming.\" And we saw the\nRussian soldiers. They occupied the city...this little town, and one of the Russian soldiers\ntook a rifle and shot a...a German guard, took off his shoes and gave me his boots because\nthe Germans had said if they were very well dressed, and without hesitation. I didn't think\ntwice. I took this...otherwise, I would never survive because I didn't have shoes to walk. You\nknow...we arrived in this little town, there was a dairy factory and they were making there\ncheese and cream and people were very hungry. They used...they ran to the factory, and they\nwere drinking the...the cream and the right there they were vomiting because the\nstomach...and...and typhoid epidemic started to spread. I was infected with typhus then\nalready. I didn't know about it. And there was...there was a very big house. It was like a\ncastle. It belonged to some kind of a Nazi, and the Russian to...to go there and to just to find\na place. They didn't know what to do with us. So we were lying there on the floor, and\npeople were dying like flies. You...you could see...you could just step over dead bodies. And\nin this big commotion,...oh, I met this Hungarian doctor that I was telling you about. This\nHungarian doctor that was in Stutthof,____, survived. And she...she put...she was...she put\nherself a Red Cross then, and she was collecting those few girls that she knew and I was...my\nsister was there, and I had a few friends and she said that there is a very good danger because\nthe Russian soldiers are raping the Jewish girls. And she said we have to take a horse and\nbuggy and I have to take you. I heard that if... don't know how many miles...10 miles, 20\nmiles from here, there is a Russian hospital and they will accept you there.",
        "Q: We have one minute. Can you tell us just very briefly where you were taken?",
        "A: We were...on our...we were traveling with this...with this buggy, and the Russian...the\nRussian took us on our horse, so we were actually walking and we stopped in a house. The\nhouse...I don't know how many miles it was, but it was close...but it was close to the hospital,\nand we just couldn't walk anymore. So I spoke a very good Russian, and we went into this\nhouse and I asked the Russian soldiers if we could sleep over. They said, \"Yes.\" They gave\nus permission to sleep, but in the middle of the night, they came to this house and it was a\nbig tragedy. A few girls were raped right there. I... escaped with my sister because a soldier\ncame to my bed, and I was separated. And I started to scream and yell in Russian. And I was\nbegging in his mother's name he shouldn't touch me and my sister I put under the bed. So he\ndidn't know, but I was. And the doctor ran out and...and she ran up, and she ran to the officer\nthat was in charge and brought him over to my bed and I explained to him that we all\ninfected with typhus and we would spread the typhus to the soldiers, they should leave us\nalone. So the...the officer in charge, there was nothing he could do with those girls that were\nthere already. He told the soldiers to come out and he put a guard and this left overnight.\nAnd next morning, we were taken to the Russian hospital where I stood and there I was 9th\nof May. 9th of May 45, when it was end of the war, I was there. I was sick a whole year. And\nin the Russian hospital, I was 99 percent near dead because I had typhoid, I had ___, and I\ndeveloped T.B. The misery that I saw there between the Jewish girl...some that were infected\nwith the.....\n"

        "A: Uh...I was...I had a very sheltered and pampered childhood. Both my parents were\nprofessionals. My father, David __, was a self-made man. He was a registered pharmacist...\nuh...despite the...that he came from a poor religious family, he became very successful after\nhe became a pharmacist. And he met my mother when he was in the University and\nboth...they were students. She studied dentistry and she belonged to the upper class, upper\nmiddle class and my grandfather was not too happy where...about this marriage, but when\nmy mother became a dentist and opened her own office, he consented and they got...they got\nmarried. My mother's name was ______. And she was really a very good professional, a\nvery gracious lady, and a very good mother and wife. My parents belonged to this...this\nstudents that actually lived very...very actively participated in the Russian revolution and\neven when they became successful, they still spoke Russian at home and all...all the ideals\nabout the equality and fraternity were very much imbedded in their minds and this...they\nembedded in us also. Despite that they worked very hard, there were always time for cultural\nevents and they used to go the theatre there, a very nice college and they had an excellent\nsocial life. I had a younger sister that was born 4 years after us. Actually I was born on the\nstreet called ____4 and my sister was born in the apartment and my mother's closet became\ntoo small and we moved to ___ 38, which was...which was the apartment and office that I\nlived til the second war world II. I have very fond memories of my childhood, and my\nparents really tried their best to...to make us, me and my sister very happy. As soon as I was\nborn I had a nanny and the nanny became a very big part of my life. And even my father\nwho was the real father ____ was afraid of my nanny because she became the boss. She\nadored my mother, but she actually was the only ones that stood up against my father and\n[...1t was sometimes when I used to go up and downstairs, it reminded me about her attitude,\nand her friends because every day she used to take me to the park. When I used to go to the\npark, I had to be dressed up...uh...like a little princess. I... had to wear a little hat, and I had\nto wear gloves and new shoes. And when she came there, she met all the other nannies and\nthey were talking and gossiping about their ladies and their bosses what they do there and\nwhat they...and what they were and how they spent their evening. And one...one wanted to\ntell the life of their ladies more interesting than the other. If my nanny decided that the dress\nI was wearing this day was not good enough, she didn't even consult my father or my\nmother, she just went to the store where we had credit. She bought me material. She went to\nthe dressmaker. She ordered a dress and this was it. And so my father got the bill and he\nasked what happened? How come you're spending so much money on little girls that will\ngrow up? She used to say, \"I cannot...I cannot allow my little girl look worse than any other\none. Do you want us to be poor? Do you want people to think that we are poor? We\nhave...we have to have appearances.\" And my father doesn't even say anything. When I\nhad...when I was 6 years old, and my parents send me to a private school. This was a school\nthat Jewish children used to go, but we were taught only Polish. And the name of the school\nwas the Private Coeducational. It was called gymnasium, and it was a private co-educational\nschool called ___. And it was located on the street on ___ ll. It was a very exclusive\nschool and I have very fond memories about it, because this teacher was a really dedicated\nand knowledgeable people. The atmosphere was very congenial and we had all the facility\nthat very often I wish my children would have when they were growing up. Because we had\nslides, we had clinical laboratories, physical laboratories and we had the ___, and we used\nto really...had very nice nature trips. And the only thing what I cannot forget how we used to\nadmire and respect our teacher who were really trying their best to make our life interesting\nand also the lessons that they teach were very exciting. When we studied about the French\nRevolution, they made like a mock judgment and we were discussing about___ SS\nhead rolled, and in no time we knew what was going on with...without worrying about the\nbook. And this...I had a little...uh...I had a very big interest in reading, and very soon...as\nsoon as I studied to...I knew how to read, my father on the suggestion of my mother took me\nto the library and then a new world opened before me because I started to read. I...there were\ndays that I had...I finished a book a day. Of course, in the beginning was just children's\nbooks, but a new world opened in front of me and my mother was very happy because she\nbelieved very strongly about culture. She used to drag me and my sister to all...to children\ntheatres to ballet. We didn't have an opera, but we had an operata. And she really used to\npump culture into us because she used to say...[ remember it well, \"that the person who\ndoesn't appreciate the music or poetry or finest things of life is really half...half blind and\nhalf...hard of feelings, because this everything is free, and you have to really appreciate it.\nComing back to...one second to my mother, I have to tell you that she was my best friend\nand I was very proud of her because not only was she a big beauty and a real lady, I never\nsaw her without a hat or a pair of gloves, but also she was a very compassionate person. She\nhad a very big clientele, and I remember rich landowners coming in front of our house and\nwith those little...uh...horse...horse and buggies, and...and those tall, strong, Polish men were\njust kissing my mother's hand because she was such a good dentist. And they used to bring\nall kinds of presents, but on the other hand the poor people around us knew if they have a\ntoothache or they have a any problem, they just come, ring the bell and come to the office\nand my mother would never ask them how much they can pay. They pay how much they\ncould, and if they couldn't pay it was alright also. So she always imbedded in our mind the\nconcept of charity. This idyllic life lasted through 1935, and this was the time when I started\nto feel the wind of anti-Semitism. My father...my father was working as a registered\npharmacist in a very big pharmacy that was a government pharmacy from the social services.\nEvery worker was involved in it. Only 3 Jewish pharmacists were working there. They were\nthe students that were on top of the class. In 1935, my father was told and also his two\ncolleagues that they have...in order to work there, they have to obtain a Masters Degree in\npharmacy. Of course, they had no other choice. They studied...they were studying. I was a\nlittle girl. My father used to close himself in...1n his bedroom and work and study. He used to\ngo on field trips because the old fashioned pharmacist didn't go and just and pick up the\nmedicine from the shelves. They have to prepare it. And finally when the tests\ncame...uh...there was an oral test and there was a written test. The man...the professor that\ngave him the test was a known anti-Semite and my father was very afraid that he won't pass\nthe test. But he passed the test with flying colors. The written test and the oral. And as he\nwas getting up from the chair...he was practically by the door, after he...telling him about so\nmany complicated chemicals formula and everything, all of sudden, the professor asked him,\n\"David ___, and what is the chemical...uh...formula for carbonated water with the C2 03,\nand my father was so nervous and so upset that he got a mental block and he couldn't answer\nhim. And he just didn't pass him. So, of course, he had to study enough and he went to\nWarsaw and after a short time we got the telegram he did pass it. But after a very short time,\na decree came and Jews were not allowed to work as pharmacist in a government institution,\nand my father lost his job. I didn't tell you that my...my father had a brother and two sisters.\nAnd my...my grandparents on my father's side were very religious, very religious people, and\nmy grandmother had 16 children but only four survived because...uh...the children\nwere...died in the infancy, and after 12 children died, she..there was...uh...folklore in our\nfamily telling us that she went to a very famous rabbi and the rabbi told her that he...that if\nyou wanted your children to live, you have to dress them only in white. Even...only in white,\neven if they grew...grow up and be able to go to school. And when the child will ask you,\n\"Mama, how come everybody dresses in all kinds of different colors and I'm wearing in\nwhite...I'm dressed in white,\" then you can take off and dress the child in any colors. And\nthis what happened. And she...the 13 and the 14 and 15 and the 16th child survived because\nshe kept them in white. And my...my father had a brother and two sisters. The...the...the...the\nyounger brother immigrated to Argentina with one of the sisters went to the United States,\nand one of the sisters lived with her parents in Poland and this...this...I just wanted to\nmention it because this was something happening and we were talking about this in the\nfamily. And so coming back to 1935 when my father lost his job, we...my mother had a very\nclose knit family. And, as I mentioned before, they were upper middle class, and they were\nsix children, two brothers and four sisters. One sister, as a young girl, got married and\nimmigrated to the United States. One sister got married to a very rich man that was a\nmanufacturer of papers and...uh...my oldest, my mother's oldest sister was a registered nurse.\nHer name was Sonia Lipquwich Perski, and she was actually my second mother and my...my\nmother, as I mentioned you, mentioned to you, was also a professional. And they were a very\nknit families. The two brothers, one the older brother was a publisher of a Jewish paper in\nKaunas, and the younger brother...his name was Soloman, was a dentist who didn't practice\ndentistry but opened a...a business...uh...dental supplies for dentists and mechanics....and\ndental mechanics. When it happened, the whole family got together. It was like a family\ncouncil and they decided that my father has to get to himself together and buy himself a\npharmacy. He couldn't buy a pharmacy in Vilno, but they found for him a pharmacy in a\nsmall town called Soley, but then a very tragic thing occurred. They didn't want to sell a\npharmacy to a Jewish pharmacist. So imagine a pharmacist, a Christian of Polish persuasion\nhad to be found, a sum of money collected by the family had to given to him and his name\nthe pharmacy was bought. This happened in 1938. And my...my...actually my family split\nbecause my mother and my sister had to go to Soley and find an apartment near the\npharmacy for my father and we stayed in Poland because my...we were going to school, and\nmy mother was practicing in Vilno. And this was the time that the very tragic event\noccurred. My mother got sick. My mother developed cancer, and when my father took her to\nthe doctor and she was operated on in one of the best hospitals in Vilno, she was...she was\nopened and closed and the professor told my father that she had 6 months to live. The cancer\nspread all over her body and you have two little girls. You have to live. But no...don't count\non your wife. It was a terrible tragedy for us. We were, as children, not told about it. And the\nonly thing that...that we knew that she was going for treatment. Then it was cobalt treatments\nand she used to feel really very bad but a little miracle happened because after 6 months she\nwent into remission and she even started to practice because her patients were so dedicated\nto her that they...we had to take off the bell from the door because everybody would come\nand just wanted to find out how she is doing. Now I have to tell a little story about our dog.\nWe had a dog called Rex, which 1s in...with the ____ in Latin. And we actually grew up with\nthe dog because when I was born, my parents bought this dog and she was our best friend.\nThe dog always when we used to eat at home, the dog was stay in the dining room under the\ntable we used to throw him the best morsels. The only thing if...when the dog was not\npresent when the guests came and my parents were entertaining their colleagues, it was a\nthing in our family that the...that the children had to be seen but not heard, and they had to\ndisappear together with the dog. My...when my mother got sick and she was lying in bed, the\ndog was sitting near here and there was no power that you should take away the dog from\nher bed. The only thing that he used to go...he used to go to the kitchen when he ...where he\nhad his dish to eat. And he would eat, drink a little water and lie on his little pillow near my\nmother. And the dog...when my mother didn't survive, this what...we felt actually the tragedy\nin my young life because on May the 22st, the 24th 1939, my mother passed away. And it\nwas something unbelievable because I was sleeping and all of a sudden I was wakened up by\nthe howling of the dog. When my mother passed away, the...the dog started to howl so\nstrong that they had to take him out from the house with the...with the force. And it was such\na big tragedy for me because I adored my mother. I was proud of her. The best day of the\nweek was for me Friday because she wasn't working, and she used to take us to all the\nfunctions and used to...she used to take us to the park. And I was so proud of her because she\nreally was so beautiful that strange men used to tip their hats for her...uh..say to her, call her\nlike princess or madonna or queen. And I was so proud of it all. My...this is my mother! So\nit was a terrible tragedy for me. We had a tremendous funeral. All the children from my class\nand from my mother's class...uh...from my sister's class came. And so many colleagues and\nsO many patients that we didn't even realize that she had...that she was known by so many\npeople. And the dog wanted to go in this...1n this cortege, but he was...the funeral cortege,\nbut he was taken. When I came home from the funeral, I was very broken up and I really was\nso desperate that I thought that the...that the world is finished for me. And I remember it was\nMay...May is a beautiful month in...in Vilno because all the lilacs are growing and the air is\njust perfumated with jasmine and lilacs. It is the most beautiful time of the year. So on a\nSaturday when ____ my little friends took me out and we were walking through the streets\nand the sun was shining and the birds were singing and I said to my God, \"The life is going\non and my mother is not any more with us.\" I couldn't find peace. My teachers came to visit\nme and I was a very good student. Have to remember I was a teacher's pet and studying was\nvery easy for me. And all of a sudden...uh...my grades fell down and my teachers when they\ncame to me, they said to me, \"You have to study. You have to take yourself together.\" And I\ntold them, \"I don't have nothing to...anymore studying. I having nothing to live anymore and\nthe writings, articles to the papers because each class had a class paper. Was a time even\nwhen I was a publisher, an editor actually of the paper and the best article from this paper\nused to go to a school paper. It was called The Student's Friend. And it was the only school\nin the whole city that had a printed paper from...from the students. It was a fascinating paper.\nOh...sometimes if I...when I remember myself about, I said, \"How come they were so serious\nabout the event? How come we understood so much?\" And I was really surprised.\nA Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, afterwards we...uh...we went...it was summer vacation, and we went to live with my\nfather and my Aunt Sonia came and she stayed with us a month. She kind of became our\nsurrogate mother because she felt...she felt that it was really a big tragedy for both of us.\nAnd...and we had a very sad summer, but actually did...uh...the whole world fall apart...fell\napart for us on September 1, 1939. I was sitting in my room and preparing actually myself to\ngo to school because I was supposed to go back to Vilno to continue study. And then my\nnanny came running into the room and said that my father wants to see us immediately in the\npharmacy. And me and my sister and my nanny were running, and my father said, \"Sit\ndown. The war broke out..broke...break...broke out. The Germans just invaded Poland, and\nwe don't know what to do...be, but don't think about going back.\" And then it started. It...1t\nstarted because the...the little town where I was belonged to Russia. I couldn't go back to\nVilno. I was sent..uh..to school in a...in a town called Oshmeyania where I was studying and\nmy sister stood with my father and this to...this was till 1940. 1940 during the vacation...\nuh...vacation time, I went back to Vilno and I stood in the house of my aunt. And I went to\nvisit my friends. This was really a very sad situation because the whole class fell apart when\nthe all 45 children, some went to one school that was teaching Pole...in Polish. The other\none... Vilno became a part of Lithuania. It was...uh...1t was very important for the Lithuanian\nto teach their children Lithuian...Lithuania so they had to teach Lithuanian and some of them\nwent to Russian school. And very...it was a big rumor and very, very soon on June 1941, we\nwere taken over by the Germans. When we were...we were taken over by the German, there\nwere...there were...we actually...the part that we were...were...at the Russian occupation, and\nthere was...uh...a truck standing 1n front of our pharmacy and there were Russian doctors that\nwere asking my father to join him and go back to Russia before the German occupied, but\nmy father said that in a war you have to have a roof under your head and he didn't want\nabandon it. And very soon the German came. I will never forget the...when the German came\nto the little town and right away, they segregated the Jews. They started to persecute Jews.\nThe Polish people were very belligerent, and they start a kind of pogrom, and one of the rich\nlandowners came to my father and said to him that you should, that he will be sent...some\npeople they would take our belongings and he will give us shelter...he will give us shelter in\nhis little...it was like not a big castle, but a small castle. And he said because he was very\ngood when the Communists persecuted him as a landowner in Russia. And my father and my\nsister went and I was sitting here with the other belongings. As it happened on the way, they\nwere attacked by Polish peasant who robbed my father, put him against a tree, shot him in\nfront of my sister, and my sister became hysterical. She was just a little, little girl there. They\nkind of let him go. And my father and my sister walked a long time and they came back and\nwe...we had to escape from there because the...the...not only...not only the German were after\nus, but the Polish peasants were after the Jews. And we..we took shelter in a Rabbi's house\nand my father arranged with a peasant, he took us to Vilno, as two little peasant girls to my\nAunt's house.",
        "A: Well, you know I will be Jewish so it was a very dangerous journey and we left very early.\nWe were put on a wagon and we were put ___. And we were told to sit quiet and he put\nsome hay over us. And nobody from the town knew that we were escaping. My father didn't\nwant to go with us. He wanted to stay yet because he didn't want to endanger our lives. So\nwe were...he left us on...just in the beginning of the town, and then in Vilno it was already a\ncurfew. The Jews...uh...were given all kinds of edicts. They couldn't walk. Uh...They had just\nto walk in the ___. They couldn't walk on the sidewalk. They had to have arm...arm bands\nwith the...uh...with the Jewish star, and they had arm bands in the front and in the back. They\nwere a certain time that they could home. All the jewelry and all the values the radio were\nconfiscated and every day, there were men taken to work and they never came back. So\nwhen I came to the outskirts from the Vilno, I...I knew where my aunt lived, but I didn't\nknow about all those things and to _ was very dangerous because I was walking on the\nsidewalk. But I didn't know how it happened, and when we...after a long, long journey, we\nfinally arrived to my aunt's house and she looked at us like we would come from the...from\nHell. She couldn't imagine that we came there. And then after a few days, my father came,\nalso came. And we stayed with...with my aunt til September 6th, 1941. This was the day it\nwas...the ghetto, Vilno ghetto was started. And I have to tell you the way the German\norganized the starting of Vilno ghetto. This was just amazing how much sadism and\norganization was involved in this. Vilno was a very cultural town and there were all kinds of\nlayers of society, but there were...there were _____. There were people that were\nassimilated. There were people that were very much pro-Israel. There were people that were\nvery much for...for Jewish culture. But there was one section that were poor Jewish people\nlived there. It was...the streets were.../ remember____\u2014\u2014_. It was in the ___ it was in the\ncenter of Vilno, and those Jews in the middle of the night were taken out from their homes\nand was taken in a place called Ponary. These are...Ponary is a big forest where mass graves\nstill are there. And they were shot right there, and they made...their poor dwellings were\nmade a place for the ghetto. So as I mentioned to you, 1t came a day when edict came and all\nthe Jews had to abandon their possessions, their apartments, their homes, and they were\ntaken to the ghetto. There were two ghettos. One...number 1 and number 2. The number 2\nghetto was liquidated in a very short time. When I say liquidated, all the people were taken\nagain to Ponary. Some of them were shot on the way, and some of them were shot in the\nmass graves. I happen to be in the second ghetto. When we came to the ghetto, it was a very\nterrible experience because we were carrying with us our meager possessions and the Poles\nlined up on the street and when they saw somebody of us wearing two coats, they used to\nsay, \"Aw, look at this Jew. She is...he is wearing two coats. Let's take one of them off.\" And\nthey would just grab and take it away, and there and nobody even interfered. The conditions\nin ghetto were terrible. One family was put on in...two or three families were put on one\nroom. The cold and the hunger and no sanitary conditions, and no facilities to cook. It was\njust...1t was just a very dark era in our lives. Uh... right away, the..the Germans put a wall and\nthere were gates and you could only go out from the ghetto if you had...1f you had a work\npermit. All you could only actually survive if you worked because the...the portions of\nthe...the Russians are very...very meager and people were very anxious to work. The...the...in\nthe ghetto inside, there were...Jews organized a Judenrat. This 1s...was a...this was actually\nlike...uh...uh...organization for Jews for social services, for...for helping each other, for\norganization and also they're the Jewish policeman that was standing by the ghetto. There\nwas a...uh...talking about me, I went one day to Judenrat because we had to survive and I\nwas lucky to get a job. There was a German asking young girls...put them...if they want to\nwork, put them into a column and we were...after a long walk, we find ourselves on the\nairport of Polobonic. And this airport of Polobonic our job was unload the wagons with big\nchunks of coal or potatoes or also wintertime we had to clean the airport. And we usually, we\nworked really very hard because the work was very long and the conditions for working was\nso bad there was always a German with..uh... how you call it? The one that who used the\nhorses. (laughing) standing behind you and you had to work and...and we really were\nmiserable. At night when we used to come to the gates...gates of ghetto, we were practically\nexhausted. But the only way we could help ourselves because we could steal a little potatoes\nfrom the wagons, and when we came we could cook them. And sometimes we had...we had\nthe chance to cook a little potato. We didn't have salt right there on the ___.\nThey...they...they used...they used to let us. My father got a job in the pharmacy of the\nJudenrat...of the Judenrat, was like a Jewish government because in the section of the ghetto\nthere was also a Jewish hospital and they had the pharmacy. My aunt worked in the hospital\nand my sister was just a little girl. And she...she doesn't even work and she was just very\nmiserable in...in the ghetto. She became actually smaller than she was, and when I used to\nbring a few potatoes it was a big treasure for her because the Russians were very meager.\nBut I have to tell you that there was a cultural life in Vilno ghetto. They were a lot of songs\nwritten, a lot of poems written. There was even a cafe. I never went there. There were...were\n____ theatres, and people really were trying to survive. Very soon, there was\nresistance...resistant organization formed. And those resistance young boys and girls became\nactive. It was a very friendly sign because you could get shot on a... but some how...some\nhow they functioned. And they were trying to get out as much as possible Jews from the\nghetto. But in order to get out from the ghetto and become a partisan and they were located\nin the Runigso and Narah forests. They...you had to have a gun and gun...a gun was very\nexpensive. When my family came to the...to the ghetto, we were very poor because\neverything was taken away from us. All of a sudden we found ourselves really without any\nfund...funds to survive. You could...for money, you could buy some food. You could buy\nsome clothes. We didn't...we didn't have it. So no matter how my father wanted us to escape\nto ...to the partisans, we had no means. I...after...uh... when...you want...there is a poem that\nwas written by one of the girls that used to walk everyday with me to the Polo barrack, and if\nyou wanted I can read it for you.",
        "A: The poem is in Yiddish. And it...1t was written by...by a really...a little girl and she said like\nthis.",
        "A: Yes. The poem say it is enough. It is enough. Every day this...our shoes are walking on this\nhard cobblestone, and our...and our feet in the...in the shoes are getting very tired to...to go\nthose kind of distances, and we are walking and we are asking...we are asking, \"Has the\nworld forgotten about us?, and we are begging and saying, \"It is enough. It is enough. We\nhave no strength to walk in our shoes on those hard cobblestones.\"",
        "A: This was...this was just a school girl that was very...uh...I don't...I am not sure if she wrote\nanything more, but she...I became very friendly with her and one morning when I came to\nwork she gave me a piece of paper and this here was the poem. I was very excited and I had\nall other little friends and ___ was the _____. And all of us when we had a chance, we\nwere sitting on this...on this tall, you know...uh...wagon full of stone...full of those big pieces\nof...uh...of...uh...big pieces of coal that we had to unload and we stopped and we were all\nreading this poem, and the German guard started to scream and yell at us, \"What are you\ndoing? What is kind of this?\" So right away we took this piece of paper and we put it inside\nyou know, and we were afraid because they were...they were just beating us up for no\nreason. But some how girls made copies of this poem and many times we used to walk, you\nknow, to work a bit and we used to recite it. And so in 1948, when I had a little...I came a\nlittle bit to myself, the first thing what I did I remembered the story...it was like written down\nin my heart. I wrote 1t down and I said, \"Let me remember this. How we used to walk to\nwork and we used to recite this poem because there 1s so much truth and so much pain and\nso much injustice asking, \"How come this injustice was done to us.\" I just like people to\nknow about it. Uh...I like to tell you about another very sad experience I had in ghetto. The\njob in ___ ended and I...one day I went again and they were asking people...the young girls,\nthe women...uh..for work. And I went there. And I was walking. I was very sad. And we\nwere walking a long time on this hard cobblestone. They were very narrow streets in my...in\nmy town. Everybody was just walking in a column in the middle. And then the column\nstopped and to my horror I saw that they stopped before the school that I used to spend and\nmy...that I used to study as a child. It was the gymnasium ____. It wasin___11.\nAnd this whole column was taken to a big...uh...a big...uh..cellar, full of old and rotten\npotatoes. And our job was to sort out the potatoes because this was...our school was taken\nover by the Nazis and they...actually 1t was the Gestapo and they...all the classrooms and all\nthe facilities were taken over, and they made offices. When I first came there, my first\ninstinct was to just...forget about everything, and just run up to the classroom when I spent\nmy...my childhood. And it was such a ___ experience I had an impulse and I ran out from\nthe column and the German right away took me back and gave me over my back, I came\nhome with a...a red sign all over and I was sitting right there and he told us to sort out the\npotatoes. As I was...uh..coming every day, I met the janitor from our school and the janitor\nhad two daughters. And would you believe that the first...the two daughters knew me as a\nchild because I sat at this school as a 6 years old and I went til 1939, so they knew me every\nday. They used to help me with my galoshes. In the bad weather I used to share with them\nmy lunch. And the first thing when they saw me, they said to me, \"My God. I heard that all\nof you were dead. How come you're still alive?\" They said their goodbye. This were their\nhello that I had from them. And we were working there, and also I met there one of my\nprofessors. My prof...his name was Professor Moderstain. He actually...he was working\nthere, tending to some chickens. He was my favorite teacher, and I don't think his mind\nworked alright. First of all, he didn't recognize me when I approached him. It was dangerous\nto approach a man because we were segregated. Women and men were segregated, but I\napproached him. And he was...and he was just talking to himself and then I was told that he\nsaw his wife, his daughter, and his son shot in front of his eyes. So this was the only time that\nI saw him there. And imagine seeing this professor just sitting there and actually dancing,\ntending to some chickens. I...uh...I developed...one day when I was working and I didn't have\nshoes, I developed an infections. And when I came to the ghetto door, it was already late at\nnight, I stepped on a...on a nail and the nail was rusted and the infection backed up, all the\nway up and I was...I got in my groin, I called a big boil and my father and my aunt saw it,\nthey took the right away to the hospital. I was operated on and I was... was in the hospital.\nIn the meantime, when I was in the hospital I saw my father taken out from the pharmacy\nbecause the situation in ghetto became very dangerous. There were three kinds of workings\npapers in the ghetto. There was blue, yellow, and pink. The yellow one was a permit to work.\nThe pink one was a permit for the children for the family of the working and the blue one\nwas a temporary working paper. And many times in the ghetto, the Germans used to come in\nthe middle of the night and they used to take out the people just for no reason and we never\nsaw them again. People used to develop secret rooms, and once I was sitting in a secret room\nin a attic and I heard Jews being...being taken to...uh...to Ponary and I heard with my own\nmusic, violins playing. Because the Germans didn't want the...the people to panic or they\ndidn't want them to...to escape or to resist them so they kind of put music...some musician in\nfront of the column and this way they sooth their nerves and I heard...I heard the music. I\nwas always thinking in case they will find me I...I and my sister we have to go by the side,\nand we have to escape. We have to escape. We have to somehow run to the partisan. I\ndon't... don't want to be taken to Ponary. Because we knew what this was going on. That\nthere were people were just shot and also we heard about the crematoria and we heard also\nabout people from other places being taken to concentration camp. It...1t was very strong\nrumor in the ghetto.",
        "A: As I told you, the dwellings in the ghetto were very old and there were mainly secret...many\npassages and many rooms that men used to put very heavy commodes or a big\ndressing...uh...piece of furniture and camouflage the door and behind the door there was a\nlittle room or a cellar or a attic and people used to just sit there all the time when the\nGermans, the Ukrainians, or the Lithuanians used to run to the ghetto and take anybody.\nAnybody! Able body! And they used to just take them quote unquote to work, but we no,\nnever saw them again. One of my uncles was taken this way. I forgot...I...just before, if I may\ncome back. I forgot something if I may come back. On the day that we were taken to the\nghetto...talking about my uncle. My Uncle Joseph Perski was a merchant who..who traded in\nfresh and dried mushrooms, and had the last connections with Polish peasants and he\ndoesn't...didn't look like a Jew. On the day that we were taken to the ghetto, he called my\nAunt Sonia, and he told her that he is not going to the ghetto. He has a lot of connections and\nhe will try to survive as an Aryan, and he asked her to join him. And she refused. She said to\nhim she cannot do it because she promised my mother on her death bed that she will take\ncare of me and my sister, and she cannot abandon them. So she asked him to take us. He\ncouldn't. Because it was just...my father was also...my father looked very Jewish. We looked\nJewish. He couldn't do it. So my mother...my mother...my second mother, my Aunt Sonia\nsacrificed her life for us because she refused to join him and she went to the ghetto with us.\nAnd she was like the pillar of strength for us. I would like to continue now about the last\ndays of the ghetto.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I got in the secret room because a friend of my father that used...that lived in the same\napartment came...approached him one day and said that he and a few men found a place and\nthey would like...they would like us also to join there. When they will...when they will hear\nthere is a big commotion, and they are looking for men, my father should come right away\nfrom the hospital and we should all meet in the secret room. And the secret room was just\nbehind a very tall...tall dresser. And you couldn't find it because they ...they....they used to go\ninto the room, and the men used to put the dresser against the door and we would just sit\nthere very, very quiet and listen for all the noises and...and then when everything's quiet\ndown, a few hours later we would come out and then we will hearing crying. This mother\nwas taken away and this father was taken away and this...and this is how...you see, and this is\nhow the German was liquidating the ghetto. I have to tell you there is a very interesting story\nabout the man in charge of the Vilno ghetto. Her name...his name was Jacob Genz. Jacob\nGenz was an officer in the Lithuanian army, married to a Christian Lithuanian, and he had a\nson with her. And when he became a commandant of the Vilno ghetto, he surrounded\nhimself with a lot of policeman and officers that were Jews that escaped from Poland and\nwere officers in the Polish army. They were all dressed as officers and they kind of were\nkeeping peace and order inside the ghetto. Genz in my opinion did a lot of good for the\nJewish population because he developed a certain rapport with the Germans. I remember\nthere was...the commandant, the German commandant of the Vilno ghetto was called Weiss\nand he was an SS man, Gestapo and the...the commandant of the guard was Malver. When\nMalver was standing by the gates of ghetto, there was a massacre because he was just\nbeating up people that were coming from work. Some of the people that came from outside\ntried to smuggle in some food, some a piece of bread, a potatoes, something to...to help their\nfamilies in ghetto. They were starving. If he found somebody, he would just beat up. There\nwere shootings. He was a living horror. And somehow he developed a rapport with them,\nand when they used to come to him and each time ask for more people, more people, he used\nto pacify them and he used to help. Help to maintain the stability of the ghetto. Very...very\nsoon before the liquidation of the ghetto, the resistance started to send...to print all kinds of\nleaflets. Jews, the end is near. Don't go to the slaughter. You have to fight with what you can.\nIf you don't have a gun, fight with ever...with a stone, with a knife, with ever you can. We\nwill not survive anyhow, but we have to be resistant. But ...but people were brainwashed by\nthe Germans, and really everybody was so involved in days of this struggle and was so weak\nand was...was so embroiled in this one thing, to survive that unfortunately inside the ghetto,\nthere was not too much resistance when the time came. And I...\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I...me and my sister, we were lying on the floor and there was just a little...a little\nopening. It was an attic and between the old wood, there was a very small opening. You\nreally had to look with one eye because we were very afraid that we will be noticed. And\nwhen I heard this music, this fiddle playing, I...I got very excited. I didn't know what\nkind...what kind of fiddle playing, so I put my eye to it and I saw fiddler playing in the\nfront...1n the front of the column and man, women and children were taken in columns, taken\nout through the streets of the ghetto, going toward the gates. And I with my own eyes\nheard...saw the people taken there. Women were crying. The women were carrying little\nchildren, and they were just...and I head the music and many times in my nightmares, I hear\nthe music they were playing. And they were just walking very slowly toward the gate of\nghetto, and the only way to...where they were taken...this was just only one direction, was\nPonary. This was the only...the only place they were taken. And I heard...there was a woman\nthat escaped from there. When I was in the hospital, she escaped from there and she was in\nthe hospital, and she was telling us that they were told to...to make their own graves, and\nthey were shot indiscriminately. The only way she survived because there were so many\nbodies on top on her she wasn't shot, and then she crawled in the middle of the night and she\ngot...put...just went from one place to another and she...she didn't know what to do so she\ncame back to the ghetto. There were a lot of people that actually didn't believe her, but I with\nmy own ears I saw this woman. I heard that she lost her mind later on...uh...because when\nshe was talking about it, she was in tremendous shock. But I...this what I heard that she lost\nher mind and she was just babbling away later on. I don't know what happened to her. But\nthis was...I heard and saw her when I was in the hospital.",
        "A: Uh...I was in the hospital and I...I had this big...b1g inflammation and I...since my physical\nconditions was very poor, I had this big opening that did...was full of pus and didn't...didn't\nheal. And so I was really...my prognosis were really very bad, but...uh...one day it was a few\ndays...must be before the liquidation to the Vilno Ghetto, my aunt who was a nurse came\ninto my room and she said that she heard rumors that the German gave against our\ncommandant, you know, to mark them that they need more Jews. So possibly for work. And\nhe decided instead of giving young, able bodies, he will take us all the sick people from the\nhospital and just to have the count. So she..she told me she'll help me to get dressed and in\nthe middle of the night, we left the hospital and it is just one of the things all of a sudden\n[...1.... walked and we went to our place where we...where she...where we were living, and\nshe started to take care of her...herself of me. And she was changing the bandages and in...in\na few days, it was September 23, 1943, in the middle of the night we were waken up by...by\na friend of ours that always took us to the secret place to the Malini, and he said that even\nour father is not with us, he will take care of us and he want us to go with him because he\nheard from a friend that is a policeman, a Jewish policeman that this...this is the..the morning\nthat they will take out all the Jews from Vilno Ghetto. I just wanted to point out that the\nVilno Ghetto had not only just from Vilno. There were...there were people from all over\nbecause in 1942, all the small ghettos around Vilno were liquidated. Means that the Jews\nwere taken out and a lot of people escaped and settled down, so there was...was a big\nconglomeration of people in the Vilno...in the Vilno ghetto. But this...uh...the morning\nwhen...when the liquidation came, there was a just such a eerie feeling in the air. You could\nsmell death. You could smell despair. You could smell helplessness. We were sitting 1n this\nroom and between me and my sister and my aunt, we just had one little head of green\ncabbage. This were our provisions. And the man said that if we will survive that he will take\nus out and we will go someplace you know...uh...to...to some peasants to look shelter, even\nthe Lithuanian were very anti-Semitic. And then all of a sudden, there was this banging in\nthe big door. The big piece of furniture, the commode, was pushed away and Ukrainian,\nLithuanian, Polish, and a few Gestapo ran to the room and told us all, \"Go out. Go out.\" And\nthe Russian, the actual the Ukrainian were yelling, \"Give us your...uh...give us your watches.\nGive us your jewelry.\" And in Russian, the watch...the watch is ___. So they were\nscreaming, \"Give us your __.\"\". And they were pushing us on the street. There is nothing\nwe could do. On the streets were pandemonium. The few...the families started to be\nseparated. The men were put in one column. The...the women were put in another column.\nThe children were...were separated from their parents and there was such a intimidation that\nyou just...you were...you were just had to look down. You couldn't even look up like a\nperson after. Of course, all of us had those...had those bands and very slowly, we started to\nmove out from the ghetto. I was walking my...with...my...my aunt was in the middle. My\nfather wasn't with...not with us. I was...my aunt was in the middle and my sister was from\none side and I was from the other side. As we were passing through the gates of ghetto, we\nturned around and this was the last time that I saw my town. And this was the last time that\n[...that I actually...this was the last time that I actually saw the streets and of my childhood,\nso this was the end of my childhood. From this time, I became an adult. As we were passing\nthe...the gates, my aunt had a beautiful voice. And I don't know...she walked like in a trance.\nAnd all of a sudden she started to sing this not loud, but sing, and we heard...what she was\nsinging this song Vilno. It...1 remembered always her singing us lullabies and all those happy\nsongs. She sang in Russian, in Polish, but she was just going there and the fist was coming\ndown and she was singing the song of Vilno. You want me to read it for you?\nIt...1t was written...1t was written in Vilno ghetto. And it...the music 1s by _____\u2014\u2014\u2014_ and it\ngoes like this.\nYou want me to translate it? It says, Dear Le Vilno. Our town that we are born. Our...our\ndreams and our desires all went...only have and say your name. When they only have your\nname on our lips, we...we have to cry. We remember the...the Vilno streets, the\nVilno...uh...uh...rivers. The River was Vilier. The Vilno forests and the Vil...and the\nVilno...uh...Mountains. And we are...we are dreaming about you and we are thinking about\nyou and we cannot forget the old times.\nAnd as we were walking, we...kept the ___ very tight and we actually didn't know where\nwe walked. And then after walking for a long time, we came to that ___ Cemetery. The\nfirst thing that we saw when we came to the ___ Cemetery, by the gate there were three\nyoung bodies hanging. There was a young girl and two boys. We found out there were\nmembers of the Vilno Resistance that would hang there. It was a windy day and the body\nwas just...just going back and forth in the wind. It was such a eerie, eerie feeling and I...I..I\ncould smell the death. I could smell...I...I could smell all them...the sorrow of the world. And\nwe were...the...the col...after the passage, the columns stopped and they were just a column\nof women and we heard rumors that there will be a selection. And the selection to the right to\nlive, and selection to the left to die. To the right, just young able bodies; and to the left are\nwomen with children, sick people and old people. My Aunt Sonia was only in her early 40s,\nbut she looked very old and my little sister was then just 11 years old, but she looked much,\nmuch young, so my Aunt took off her shoes from...that had a little heel and she put them on\nmy sister. She should look a little bit...uh...taller, and she kind of took her brow and put it\nin...she should look, she should look grownup. And I...I saw people there wondering around\nin a daze. It...it was...there was a child there crying and one of their sisters was holding her\nby the hand and he says he was looking for his mother. There were women just tearing their\nhair out, sitting right there. And the column started to move. Then it came to a stop. And we\nsaw SS men dressed in the...in the black uniforms, with that hat. They had the special hat\nwith the...with the insig...insignia. The insignia was like...uh...a school, a...a cross, with those\nred swastikas, with those big barking dogs. Those dogs were barking so loud and they were\nsuch a big police dogs. I...I see them before me. They are like grey and black, and they are\nalarming and they were...and the...the Germans, the Gestapo, they were armed. They were\narmed with real rifles. And then the selection begun. They were...they were just pushing\npeople left and right. And all of sudden...I don't know how it happened...I find myself, my\nsister on the right, and my aunt was not with us. So I ran back to the assistant and I spoke\nwith this SS man very good German. I started to plead with him. I want to go to my mother.\nSo he took out the other side of the carbine, you know, of the rifle and he beat on me and he\npushed me away to the right. I fell on the floor and he was yelling, \"You go and you have to\nwork for the fatherland.\"____\u2014\u2014\u2014sd[ waa devastated. I...I did...I couldn't imagine that\nwe were separated from my aunt. And all of a sudden I found my other aunt...my other Aunt\nEsther that was my mother's sister. She some...she was even eld...older...uh...older than my\naunt, but somehow they...she went through and she was there, right there...with my cousin.\nHer name was Lena. And also with her daughter-in-law. Her name was Malisha. She was\nfrom Lodz. And she embraced me and she took me in and they started to calm me down. I...I\nwas really hysterical, beside myself, and somehow very soon after this, they ...they started to\nload us into the cattle trains. And on this...those cattle trains were we...when we were loaded\nwe were pushed...we didn't even have a place where to sit down. There were a very big vat,\nyou know, beer... with water and some disinfectant in the center. And we just had to stay\naround there because we couldn't even squat. The...this..1n the center was supposed toilet, but\nthe...we didn't have water. We didn't have bread. We didn't have anything. And I really I was\nso desperate and so beside myself I don't recall now how long were we...we traveled. But all\nof a sudden, we heard the wagons stopped. The whole time they didn't let us out. We...we\nstopped and we were some kind of a railroad station. It was dark at night. It was full of SS\nmen, the same dress, the same dogs, and there were all kinds of guards. And they were\nvery...a lot of lights, reflectors. You know what is a reflector? That was just shining at us\nand we were pushed and we told to unload. And I realized with my sister and my cousin that\nwe were in a concentration camp. And it was the Kalstra concentration camp near Riga. And\nI don't know if it was imagination, but I smelled some burning. And in my imagination we\nwere... mean not my imagination...my mind, I felt that we are taking to the crematoria. I\ndon't know from where, women guards appeared. This woman guards were really\nsomething. They were very strong women, blonde, barrel chested and with long boots and all\nof them had to...what you had to the horses, how you call it?",
        "A: Whips. All of them were whips. And they told us right away to line up and to get undressed.\nNaked! You know, one, you are only a person as soon...as long as you have your clothes on.\nYou can be a professor. You can be a doctor. You can be a scientist. You can be a\nshoemaker. But as long...as soon as your clothes come up and you stand naked, you are lost.\nYou are not a humanbeing anymore. This is what I cannot...what I cannot forgive the\nGermans that they...they took off our...systematically take...took away our dignity. But\nundressing us, many of the girls were young girls. They were virgins. They never saw their\nparents naked, never saw their mothers naked, but all of a sudden we...we have to go and get\nundressed. We were taken to...to the...to someplace. They said that they are taking out us to\nbath, to a general bath, a general bath. I remember holding my little sister by the hand and\nwe were sharing a shower and I was saying goodbye to her because I was sure that the gas\nwill come out any moment. And I...i1t was talking to her to sooth her out because she was\nvery afraid, and I was telling her, \"Don't worry. Mama...Mama is looking for us from\nHeaven.\" And we were standing there. I was just like saying goodbye and then all of\nsudden, the water appeared. And then we realized that we are not in the crematorium, but we\nare just...they are rooms where we washed. And then you know who went to a series\nexamination with the doctors. The doctors were so brutal. They were so...they were...they\nwere so sadistic, and half were...and undressed and all the...we found ourselves outside that\nwe had to line up. Line up again and there were all kinds of big piles of...of clothing and big\npile of shoe and big...so we had to go and choose our dresses or our shoes and...and they told\nus to get dressed and we were taken to barracks. I was in a way lucky because I didn't think\nI'll survive too long. There were some of my friends were taken to work in...they called it the\n_______. This is where they were sorting out the...the dresses I think, but I was taken to\ndinner worker. A German came, a few German and they were selecting women and me and\nmy sister were selected. And they take...took us to the labor camp. It was Dinnerwork. We\nwere unloaded. I think it was on trucks. And we were taking to Dinnerwork. Dinnerwork, it\nwas a labor camp ran by the Toad organization. This was a construction organization and all\nthe guards there were middle aged Germans that were not taken to the Russian, were not\ntaken to the army. In Dinnerwork, there was a big mixture all kind of people that were\nworked there as slaves. This was slave...slave labor. We met...uh...POWs from Holland that\nwere very nice. They were young boys that helped us a lot. And we were taken to some\nbarracks and as strange as it will sound to you, after the ghetto and in car survived, we found\nourselves quite comfortable in Dinnerworker because first of all, we had water. Each of us\nhad a bed to sleep, and we also...the...the Russians were much, much better and we kind of\nstraighten out ourselves because all...from the young girls became little old women. In\nthe...1n Dinnerworker I was in room number 4. There were maybe 40, 50 women in one\nroom. And they were....and we were separated by a very heavy door from the men. The\ncommandant from the...from the whole camp was a German obert...we called him\noberstrumfuhrer. And he was...he was a married German. Very tall, and with children, very\ntall and cute. I remember him walking with...with tall...tall boots and we were lucky. He\nbecame very friendly with one of the German...with our inmate, a Jewish girl. She was a\nJewish girl from Berlin, and she was a cabaret singer. She was a real beauty. You couldn't\nfind where her legs start and finish. She was all legs. She spoke half and half German. And\nhe fell in love with her. He took her out from the room. She was in my room, and he gave\nher a separate room and he gave her special clothes. She...she was wearing high boots and\nlike the...the uniforms...the coats when you wear when you ride, a riding habit. And she kind\nof...kind of had a very good influence on him. He was playing with fire because if a German\nwas not supposed to socialize with a Jewish girl, but this was a closed compound and he was\nin charge...in charge there, and he adjusted his life for it. But if there was any time any\nproblems, we could always support her and she was trying to sooth it. And she was\nexcellent...excellent barrier for us, between us and him. He became much more mellow. It\nwasn't...it was not a paradise. Every morning at dawn, it was still dark, 1t was bells so we had\nto get up and we had to...we had to line up. It was called the appell, in German the appell. I\ndidn't mention that every day that we were in Kalsea, we had to go to the appell also. And\nevery day we were counted. There was no possibility for us to escape, but every day we were\ncounted like sheep. Anyhow, there was...uh...uh...we... we...we would get up in the morning\nand we would work. We worked very hard in Dinnerworker. We were working on\nconstructions and we were...we were pushing very, very heavy wagons with sand. We\nwere...uh...passing....we had to line up and work with...uh...those...how you call those...but\nyou build...uh...build a house...uh...I'm a little nervous. I forgot. You know how you call it?\nWhen you build a house, the ____ pieces, how you call it? Uh...Anyhow, we worked with\nconstructions and when...by the end of the day we were exhausted. But the truth, by the end\nof the day when we came we had to place there to ourselves. And we...we...we had a place\nwhere to sleep. We had a special, distinct clothing. We had pants and a jacket and on...on the\nfront and on the back of the clothing, there were white, wide rings and on the sides of the\npants, there were white...white stripes. So it was a precaution we shouldn't escape, because\nthere were some workers that used to come, ___ used to come there and they used to go\nout. And my sister was told to...to work for the Gestapo commander...uh... that was in charge\nof the gate and she had to go there every morning and clean his house and also do his\nlaundry. And after a...a...awhile, she got very sick. She developed rheumatism, but 1t was a\nvery special rheumatism that affects your heart, and..",
        "A: Rheumatic fever. And she was...and she was kept in...in a small place. It was a...like if you\nhad a coat or whatever, you could stay there a day or two. But if you stayed 3 days, you were\ntaken out and this was goodbye. Shot! When she was taken there in charge of this...this was\ncalled in Germany ___ Revere. This...you know, it was a German doctor that had a\ndaughter the same age and she looked like my sister. The German doctor kind of felt sorry\nfor her, and he used to steal medicine from the SS man. He used to give her the medicine and\nhe let her stay there. She was for there may 3, 4 weeks, which was very...was just unusual.\nThis is just a human interest story that I am telling you. And he was just taking care of her.\nAnd he...he told her that she reminded him of his little daughter. Now, there was...there was\na cultural life in Dinnerwork. A very good friend of mine that working as...as a shoemaker\nfrom all the things they were told. He was a shoemaker and was fixing German boots. At\nnight, he used to write poetry, and she used to...we used to recite the poetry. And even she\nwrote a song. The song...the song is called Dinnerworker. Do you want me to...to sing it?\nThe words are...are by...by my friend.",
        "A: Her...her name was Tosha. She didn't survive. She was just a little girl, but she was a real,\nreal poet. For her to write a poem was just nothing. It was just bubbling out of her. She\nwould...wherever she was, she was going with scraps of paper and she was...she was just\nwriting. She was from Lodz, and she and her parents and sister escaped in 19...in 1940 from\nLodz and they escaped. There were a lot of people...Polish Jews that escaped from Vilno...to\nVilno. Some the Germans. We called them the ____, because they were running away from\nthe Germans and because the German came up and to us 3 years later in 41, a lot of them\nstarted a new life in Vilno. When, unfortunately, when the ghetto was organized, she...she\ncame to the ghetto and she was together with us. And the...the melody is from a Russian\nsong. And this 1s...this is a really...this is a really beautiful song that tells a lot about the\nconditions in Dinnerworker. But goes on and on, but I wanta just tell you, it tells...uh...it tells\nus that in Dinnerworker, were an island surrounded by waters and forests and there are Jews\nfrom all the world that work very hard and are constantly freezing in the cold weather. In the\nmorning, it is still dark, but the bell rings and we have to go out, stand up and go to work.\nAnd we are asking the world why are the Jews punished? For...for what things? For whose\nthings are Jews being punished? We used to....we used to sing this all the song that goes on\nand on, and there were...there is also another poem about the dress...the dress that we\nwear...wear, We were wearing. In each and every poem, there is also a poem that\ndescribes...this is called advertising and it describes how the young girls work very hard to\nearn their meager portion of...of the bread and water that they are getting. And they are...the\nonly thing that they hope that one day will come that they will walk with themselves in their\nown land. So they are very poignant and very...very sad, revealing poems. Also there is a\npoem called The Spring, where a young girls were sitting and waiting for the Spring to\ncome. Spring 1s such a nice...nice month, but not for us because our freedom is taken away.\nWe don't lose our hope that one day we will be free, but in the meantime, we feel that the\nwhole world around us forgot us. I Just wanted...to people to know that those people, those\ngirls, those young women that were there were living and breathing one thing. Freedom and\nsurvival. Their spirit was so strong. Their bodies were very weak. But there was something\nin them that just didn't let them die. I have to tell you now about something that happened in\nDinnerworker which is really remarkable. We had guards all over. One of the guards was a\nyounger German, and each and every room had...had a Jewish woman that was in charge.\nAnd in one of the rooms...this was room number 3....was...1n charge was a Mrs. Schwartz.\nShe was little older than us because she was married at this time already. She was not a\nbeauty, but a very clever woman. And somehow, I don't know how, this young German\nguard fell in love. And every night, they used to talk for hours and hours. And we couldn't\nunderstand this what he saw in her, but this was...and he used to bring her special food. She\nwas very good. She used to share it with other girls. Yes. And one day came and there were\ntrucks standing in front of our...the building that we were kept, and they said they...they need\nwomen to...uh...labor camp. It was called __, and they working something with\nelectric...electricity...electric lamps, something. And between those that were taken was also\nMrs. Schwartz. Mrs...of course, this guard was beside himself, and he went right with there,\nwith her. Not officially, but he went as a guard with them. When...we were told. I wasn't...I\ndidn't see it, but I was told that when they came there, there was a selection and since Mrs.\nSchwartz was a little older, she was taken in a truck and this man...this guard knew that she\nwas taken to be shot. When he saw her being taken away, he shot himself: So this was one\nthe remarkable story. We stayed in Dinnerworker til one day...one day I think it was already\nin 1944, they told...they all loaded us into a big boat, and they took us across the Baltic Sea.\nIt was near Danzig, in East Russia, and when we came to a place, this was some kind of a\nport. After a voyage of 3 or 4 days on the big boat, on the big...uh..boat, we were taken with\nbarrages to a different concentration camp. The concentration camp was Tutorial. It was in\n1944. When we were...to describe Stutthof, it take...1t can take a week. I tried to be\nvery...if...1f there is a misery there was Stutt...there was Stuffhof. The barracks were terrible.\nThe food in the morning they used to give us a slice of black bread and a little bit hot water,\nblack. Since we didn't have water to wash our head, we used this...this water to wash our\nhair. Uh...During they day they used...they used to bring a very big pot, tremendous pot like\nthe pot sometimes you used the pet. You used the pet and to wash to do their wash them in\nthe...and it was full with black water, many times cold with turnips half cooked. And\nthey...this was our...this was what they will give us to eat, and after they finished the...the\nwomen guards would finish to distribute this meager rations. Since we were so hungry, we\nused to crawl with the head to...to scrap some food on the bottom, and the German used to\nstand and laugh. We were surrounded with...uh...electric wire and with so many men and\nwomen just fall on the electric wires. I saw it. They committed suicide. Men they separated\nfrom you. We saw there Hungarian women. We saw there that were brought because it was\nalready 44, we saw the...we saw the...we saw all kinds of nationalities...Jewish nationalities.\nAnd those German guards were so bad, so sadistic, so cruel that I just don't have the words to\ndescribe. One day they called us out...they put us...1t was cold...1n appell. We had to stand up,\nand they said that young women will be taken to a labor camp. My sister then was...was in\nbig danger, and when she passed near the German, he asked her...I told her to stand with\nherself out and show that she had a big bust, and I put some...something into her breast. And\n\"How old you are?\" And she said, \"I am 18.\" Uh...He...he...she went through, but it was\nsuch a traumatic experience for me that I cannot...because my mind already said goodbye to\nher. And also the first time in Stutthof, I saw those stripes because those striped uniform and\nwe very anxious to get them because we were very cold. We didn't...we had very thin\ndresses. We didn't have shoes. My legs were frostbitten, and those uniforms were kind...but\nthey...they didn't give us at this time. And really at the strangest sound they would help us to\nfight the cold. Very shortly, after we left Stutthof, a big epidemic of typhus broke out there.\nMy aunt and my cousin died right there in the epidemic. My cousin-in-law survived\nthis...this epidemic, and I met her after the libera...liberation, but just the moment when I was\nseparated from my aunt from there, it was a...took so much of the spirits because\nthey...my...my...they didn't want to go because my aunt...then she was in her 40s looked\nolder. They knew that she will not accept it, and she didn't go. Finally, we were brought to\nStuttgart labor camp. Oh, it was...Stutthof labor camp was a camp...a camp that we really\nworked very, very hard because facilities were miserable. We didn't have the proper\nclothing. We were really freezing, and we worked very hard. We were working in the forest.\nAnd we also were building trenches. And every day, every day there were girls just dying.\nThey were falling like flies. Any...any little infraction, they were beaten. They get like 20\nlashes, 25 lashes and...on their behind, and since they were so malnourished, those slashes\njust were full of pus. They never healed and those girls never, never recovered. We was at a\nplace called ___ Revere. And it...and a Hungarian woman doctor was in charge with there.\nShe was helping whatever she could, but there was so little that she could do. Every day\nwhen we came from work, I was going to her and I developed very big...very big sores on\nmy legs, very bad circulation, and she would help me. Because if they would...the German\nwould see myself, they will shot me. And I was...I am soever grateful with her, and by\ncoincidence, I met her after the liberation and she was very instrumental to my survival. I\nwill tell you about this later. After we'd stayed 1n..in Stuttgart a long time, one day was the\nday that I will never forget it. It was a day before the Yom Kippur. I was not from a\nrelig...religious family, and I am not...was really not observant, but there were a lot of\nwomen that were very observant. And they kind of knew when...I don't know how because\nwe had no...no papers, no picture. We had nothing. No identification. And right there\nnext...next bed to us was a woman that was...was an aunt of a friend of mine, and she was a\npatient of my mother. She was from...she was one of those people that my mother helped,\nthat she was not of the wealthy ones. And she...when she saw us in Stuttgart, in the labor\ncamp, she kind of took care of us because she was very lucky. She worked...worked in the\nkitchen. And whatever scraps she was bring...she was bring at night. She would be shot if\nthey would find her because if a girl went out from the line and she picked up a frozen\nturnip, that was...that was sent to ____. She was shot right there. But she shot and my friend\nas we were walking in the dark because it was in end of September. It was already very dark\nin the morning, maybe 4, 5 o'clock in the morning, she told us...my aunt told me that you are\ninvited. You will fast tomorrow, and tonight you are invited. She's preparing a little\ncelebration, something to eat. So we were very...we were very excited because you know\nwhat this food, a piece of bread, black bread, this... And as we working, a rumor spread...the\nwomen that were religious, told our guard that they would like to finish work a little earlier\nbecause tomorrow is the day of atonement. It's a very big day. And do you know that the\nguards kept us this night longer than usual. They were harsher to us. They gave us more\nlashes and when we came home we were so tired that we couldn't even eat. We were just\nover exhausted. We were just happy that you could lie down and stretch out. I didn't go to\nthe ___. I didn't do nothing. The next day in Kippur, we went to work with nothing. I was\njust telling you how people treated people, and I don't want this to be forgotten, what the\nhumanbeing can do to a humanbeing. Very soon after this, a rumor started to spread that the\nGermans are in retreat, and a very big thing developed right there in Stuttgard between those\nguards. Those guards were real SS men with those black things. And they took us out and\nthey took...and they took us on...I...we call it the death march. They were taking us one side\nto another and sometimes, we were taken from one direction and we saw other people,\nprisoners, concentration camp, Polish people, Jews, taken from the other side. At...we used\nto walk endless, endless times, and we didn't have shoes. We...we matter of fact had those\nwooden shoes that...that really were...were...you couldn't walk on the snow with it, because\nthe snow was just going there and you used to walk like a circus performer, and used to\nform. And at night, they used to put us in a big barn without food. They used to occupy a big\nbarn of a Polish peasant, a German peasant. It does...wasn't a act in East Prussia. In the\nmorning we had to...to straighten ourselves, put ourselves in a column. They will count us.\nAnd we will go forwards. And one day when we came to a...to a place, one of these guards\ngot bezerk. He put us straight in a column and he just started to shoot discriminately. A\nwoman that was standing near me...she was standing here; I was standing here. My sister\nwas shot. I lost my sister. And I didn't know what happened. After they...he...he was\nsubdued, there were a lot of bodies just lying around, and I was besides myself looking for\nmy sister, and after awhile, we found ourselves. She...she escaped, and I...she was running\nand I was running, and we found ourselves and we started to smell death. We were really\nsmelled death. And this march...they called the death march, was something undescribable\nbecause we were walking and sleeping. The last night we walked the whole day and the\nwhole night and we closed our eyes and we were sleeping. The night before we were put in a\nbig barrack, and I practically gave up. Because I was so exhausted and was so tired that I\ntold my sister that...there was a lot of hay. We were sitting in the hay, that we were go into\nthe hay and wait...and wait for them that the Germans should come, they should walk away,\nand we will just die very peaceful lying in the hay. But when they came out and they\ncounted, they realized that a few women were missing, so the Polish peasant came with a\nGerman and he looked in the barn, and they were poking and as they poked...they poked and\nthey found us. And I was begging the German guard, the SS man, to shot me because I\ncouldn't go. And he pushed me and he says to me, \"You are too young to die and...and\nstraighten yourself out,\" and pushed me to the column. This...this...I was there. And I am\ntelling you and this...this I memory stick out, written in my soul even after so many years.\nWe started to walk, and we were a group of young girls that were very close..close together.\nWe...we actually supported ourselves. The girl that wrote the poem and my little friend, the\ngirl that her mother...her aunt was the cook, we kind...we...we had like a kind of coalition,\nand we knew the only way we can survive if we will stay in the front. Because if you were\nstaying in the back and you couldn't walk with the column, you were just shot. And then I\nsaw young girls walk and walk and all of a sudden they became like frozen. Straighten their\nlegs, and sit and they were just like frozen monuments, falling right with their face on the\nsnow. The German didn't have to shot them. This is how they fell. One of my friends started\nto feel bad, and we took her and I was from one side and another of my friend and we were\ndragging her, practically dragging her. She couldn't help. Legs were frozen. So the guard\nnoticed it. He...he...he told the column to stop. He took her to a certain field, and we heard\nthe shot. He shot her right there. (Crying) And then he send out another girl. She should take\noff...she had a little coat...a little warm coat on her which was very unusual. She should take\nit off and take it to herself. So this girl, she didn't know her, but the will was survival was so\nstrong, she took it...her off, and she put it and she couldn't stand it. But she didn't know. She\nwanted to survive. What can you do? Many times in the night when I...I get up...I wake\nmyself up screaming and I see those young girls, frozen, falling on the snow. This is\nsomething undescribable. The...here on the cheeks, they were red, and they were just sticks.\nThis is something that whoever wasn't there cannot believe it. And when I talk to you I think\nI'm telling you something that happened to somebody else because I cannot believe that I\nwent through it and then lived to tell. It was March 11, 1945. We came to a place called\nKruma. It was East Prussia. It was a small town. As we walked in there, there was a\ntremendous barn. I never saw anything like it, and all of us were put into this barn. In this\nbarn, we met people from all the nationalities. There were men also. And...and the barn was\nsurrounded by Gestapo, and as we were looking through the doors and actually the doors\nwere a little open...there were no windows, we saw the Gestapo putting out little...twigs,\naround the barn. They wanted to burn. It was decided that they didn't know what to do with\nus anymore, and they wanted to hold up...there were thousands of people there. All kinds of\nlanguages that spoke...spoken. And we were just sitting there, and all of a sudden, it was in\nthe morning, March 11, 1945, that we heard a big commotion, and somebody started to\nscream, \"The Russian are coming.\" And we didn't find one German. I don't know. They\ndisappeared. The German guard disappeared. I was afraid to run out. I was sitting. And\nthen...my friends started to scream and yell, 'The Russians are coming.\" And we saw the\nRussian soldiers. They occupied the city...this little town, and one of the Russian soldiers\ntook a rifle and shot a...a German guard, took off his shoes and gave me his boots because\nthe Germans had said if they were very well dressed, and without hesitation. I didn't think\ntwice. I took this...otherwise, I would never survive because I didn't have shoes to walk. You\nknow...we arrived in this little town, there was a dairy factory and they were making there\ncheese and cream and people were very hungry. They used...they ran to the factory, and they\nwere drinking the...the cream and the right there they were vomiting because the\nstomach...and...and typhoid epidemic started to spread. I was infected with typhus then\nalready. I didn't know about it. And there was...there was a very big house. It was like a\ncastle. It belonged to some kind of a Nazi, and the Russian to...to go there and to just to find\na place. They didn't know what to do with us. So we were lying there on the floor, and\npeople were dying like flies. You...you could see...you could just step over dead bodies. And\nin this big commotion,...oh, I met this Hungarian doctor that I was telling you about. This\nHungarian doctor that was in Stutthof,____, survived. And she...she put...she was...she put\nherself a Red Cross then, and she was collecting those few girls that she knew and I was...my\nsister was there, and I had a few friends and she said that there is a very good danger because\nthe Russian soldiers are raping the Jewish girls. And she said we have to take a horse and\nbuggy and I have to take you. I heard that if... don't know how many miles...10 miles, 20\nmiles from here, there is a Russian hospital and they will accept you there.",
        "A: We were...on our...we were traveling with this...with this buggy, and the Russian...the\nRussian took us on our horse, so we were actually walking and we stopped in a house. The\nhouse...I don't know how many miles it was, but it was close...but it was close to the hospital,\nand we just couldn't walk anymore. So I spoke a very good Russian, and we went into this\nhouse and I asked the Russian soldiers if we could sleep over. They said, \"Yes.\" They gave\nus permission to sleep, but in the middle of the night, they came to this house and it was a\nbig tragedy. A few girls were raped right there. I... escaped with my sister because a soldier\ncame to my bed, and I was separated. And I started to scream and yell in Russian. And I was\nbegging in his mother's name he shouldn't touch me and my sister I put under the bed. So he\ndidn't know, but I was. And the doctor ran out and...and she ran up, and she ran to the officer\nthat was in charge and brought him over to my bed and I explained to him that we all\ninfected with typhus and we would spread the typhus to the soldiers, they should leave us\nalone. So the...the officer in charge, there was nothing he could do with those girls that were\nthere already. He told the soldiers to come out and he put a guard and this left overnight.\nAnd next morning, we were taken to the Russian hospital where I stood and there I was 9th\nof May. 9th of May 45, when it was end of the war, I was there. I was sick a whole year. And\nin the Russian hospital, I was 99 percent near dead because I had typhoid, I had ___, and I\ndeveloped T.B. The misery that I saw there between the Jewish girl...some that were infected\nwith the.....\n"
