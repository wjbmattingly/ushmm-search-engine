And then I went for two\nyears to German high school. And then there were restrictions and getting to \u2014 and\nthen my parents were 1n a position to send me to private boarding schools in Italy;\none on the Riviera, near Portofino, apart \u2014 over that area. And the second one was\nOctober 16, 2010\nnear Merano, in the Dolomites, in the mountain areas. So nice. Stayed there from\nabout April 37, til\u2014I can give you the exact date, September thirt \u2014 30\", 1938.\nThat\u2019s it. September has 30 days or 31?",

And that was \u2014 on the train I found\nevery town, every station had a lot flags out. Why? Because they saw me going \u2014 no,\nthere was somebody else who took the same train ride, the same day.\n[indecipherable] You\u2019re not a history major, are you?",

        "Q: Oh, mm-hm.",
        "A: That\u2019s when Daladier was there from France, Chamberlain from England,\nMussolini and Hitler. And they met, and that was, as far as I\u2019m concerned, the start,\nthe prelude to World War II, because that\u2019s when the \u2014 the British and the French\nsaid Hitler could annex Sudetenland, which 1s the ethnically German part of\nCzechoslovakia, which is the one that \u2014 and then a couple \u2014 not too long afterwards,\nHitler annexed all of Czechoslovakia, and renamed it Birman(ph), which is the\nclassy German name for that part of the country.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: Was it difficult to leave \u2014 leave your family? Were you \u2014",
        "A: No, at that time it was \u2014 it was lot of good discipline. Before \u2014 when you went to\nthe dining hall, they checked your fingernails, so make sure they\u2019re clean. They had\nsomebody \u2014 some teacher there [indecipherable]. And that was a very interesting\nOctober 16, 2010\nlife, we experienced people from all over the world. They were not only Germans,\nthey were also loyalists from Spain who were fleeing after the Spanish \u2014 during the\nSpanish Civil War, which was going on at that time. And the school was very good,\nnot too many students there. The student to t-teacher ratio \u2014 ratio was good, and we\ngot a lot of personal attention, and a lot of sports. We didn\u2019t have that much contact\nwith the Italians, except we played soccer against them. But then, I went swimming,\nI even \u2014 that\u2019s the first time I did diving. There was har \u2014 hard hat diving, which is\nhardly done any more. But in the bay, catching squids and stuff like that.",
        "Q: What language were \u2014 what language did you speak when you were at school in\nItaly? Was it German?",
        "A: There were different things. The primary language was German [indecipherable]\nbut everybody had to take Italian, and I was reasonably fluent, and later on I went for\na while to a German \u2014 to Italian public high school. And I had troubles with it, which\nI wasn\u2019t that good. Then my first language before I went to Italy was French. And\nmy mother was a expert in \u2014 1n the French language. In fact, she used to tutor PhD\nstudents in the States, who were preparing for their language exam. You know, they\nhad to pass a language exam if they took the thing. And the th \u2014 interesting thing 1s,\nthe school will send you right home twice a week, one postcard and one letter. And\nmy mother insisted that the postcard be written in French. So it\u2019s \u2014 and then at\ndinner, you were assigned to sit on different tables, and at different tables, there was\nOctober 16, 2010\nonly a certain language spoken. So if you went this week to the French table, that\u2019s \u2014\nthat was it.",
        "Q: The language you spoke.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, did you \u2014 was it a positive experience?",
        "A: Yes. Oh well, tha \u2014 I mean, this is \u2014 they were great in doing things like, we were\nharv \u2014 harvesting the seeds from luk \u2014 eucalyptus trees, and then we learned how to\ndistill and make eucalyptus oil from it. And we were \u2014 we \u2014 not only academically,\nalso had to work, we \u2014 1n the garden, we were harvesting figs and oranges and\nlemons and \u2014",
        "Q: So-",
        "A: My favorite thing was harvesting figs, because I liked them. Fresh ones.",
        "Q: Why did you leave?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: What was the situation, why did you have to leave Italy?",
        "A: That school?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, it was \u2014 these schools closed. First the school at the Mediterranean closed.\nI don\u2019t know what the reason 1s they closed, I don\u2019t \u2014 but then they moved some of\nthe kids into a neighboring town, and a few of the teachers created their own\nOctober 16, 2010\nboarding school. But we were actually staying in a pensionne. And what \u2014 they had\nlessons, and we were located next to the Mediterranean, we could go \u2014 the first\nkids to go swimming, and see the fisherman coming in, and see them eat little fish,\nbian \u2014 biachettis. They eat them all live. And \u2014 well, you also can cook them, but\nwhen you cook them, the fish turns white, except the eyes, and the tail stays silver.\nAnd for beginners, you eat that with tomato sauce, but it tastes better with lemon.\nBut then you see the eyes as you\u2019re putting it in your mouth.",
        "Q: That sounds gross.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve eaten \u2014 many years later I\u2019ve eaten something that was even more\ndifficult to eat, and that was called balut. I ate that in the Philippines. That is the\negg of a duck, soft boiled, about four days before the egg is hatched. And you eat\neverything except the beak, you use that to cl \u2014 to clean your teeth.",
        "Q: Gross.",
        "A: And when I was in the Philippines and working there, when \u2014 and we went out\none evening \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m going way back \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: \u2014 way 1n [indecipherable] we went out with a couple of the other engineers, we\nwent to places, and they \u2014 the last thing on the evening, they saved for me, is a\nbalut.",
        "Q: Were you surprised? Did you know what it was?\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t know what it was. I think I heard about it lately, but I had a lot of\nbeers with it, and just swallowed. But in the next day, when I went back to the plant,\nit\u2019s like having passed the initiation test. I was not \u2014 not just a gringo, or whatever\nthey call them there. I was initiated \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 in their food, and I got better response from the workers.",
        "Q: Good.",
        "A: They all knew about it.",
        "Q: So, when you left Italy in \u00b038 \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It was Sep-September first, you said?",
        "A: No, September 30\".",
        "Q: 30\". When \u2014",
        "A: The conference was October first.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: The Munich Conference.",
        "Q: Where did you go from there?",
        "A: Well, I went for a short time back to Mannheim, and then I went to a Jewish\nboarding school in Germany, in Halingen. That\u2019s near Ulm. And that was probably\nthe biggest Jewish boarding school that was still remaining in Germany. And that\nOctober 16, 2010\nwas closed, but [indecipherable] very long, except I think they tortured us there, but\nthat\u2019s the teachers. Because every morning, before anything else, we had to run for\nabout half an hour through the woods, hilly and through the woods. There was a\ncommand, wald lauf, which means wood \u2014 running through the wood. And none of\nthe guys, and there were \u2014 they always were may \u2014 everybody who went there\nremembered, that was the worst command that was given there. But then when that\nschool closed after Kristallnacht \u2014 we did not experience anything at Kristallnacht,\nat that school, but it was closed afterwards. And the different buildings were sold to\nvarious people. And the person who bought the boys\u2019 dormitory was Field Marshal\nRommel. So I lived \u2014 I lived in \u2014 slept in Rommel\u2019s house before he did.",
        "Q: My goodness. So, after the school closed, where did you go to then?",
        "A: Well, I went for a short time back to Mannheim, there was a Jewish school there,\nand I went there for a couple of weeks, and then I went to Kindertransport.",
        "Q: So, where were your sisters during this time?",
        "A: Friend of our \u2014 that friends of ours took my sisters to Holland, couple days after\nthe Kristallnacht.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And they put them into private families, and they were treated very well. The first\none was manufacturers of a cheese \u2014 of a cheese man \u2014 at a cheese factory in a town\ncalled Budehaven(ph), which is in the \u2014 one of the bra-branches of the Rhine,\nOctober 16, 2010\nbefore it gets into the North Sea. And \u2014 but then they couldn\u2019t stay there very long\nbecause it\u2019s \u2014 the wife got very ill and they couldn\u2019t \u2014 they couldn\u2019t do it any more.\nAnd then they went to another family, where the father was a diamond merchant.\nThey lived in a tremendously big house, and they sent their kids, including m-my\nsisters to the best school in Holland, which is the same school that the present queen\nattended. Not at the same time. She\u2019s younger. But it\u2019s the kind of a reputation of the\n\u2014 that time current princess was s-scheduled to go to that school and it\u2019s probably \u2014\nit\u2019s probably wa \u2014 the best high sc \u2014 high school or something like this in Holland.\nBecause of that it got that royal ey \u2014 interjection.",
        "Q: Right. So when you went from the boarding school in Germany, back home, was\n\u2014 did your parents discuss with you that you were going to be leaving on the\nKindertransport? Like did you know \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, when we became available, it was [indecipherable] short notice. It didn\u2019t\n\u2014 I think it was in about January \u201939, or something like that. No, and then my father\nwas arrested and until then he could practice because he was a wounded veteran of\nWorld War I. And then he was put in Dachau for a while. And then he was later\nreleased because he was able to get sponsorship by \u2014 by the Bishop of Litchfield in\nEngland. A funny thing, on one of our trips, when my parents were visiting me up\nin Italy, there was a lady staying in the same hotel as my parents were staying, and\nthey became friendly, and she was a secretary to the b \u2014 to the Bishop of Litchfield,\nOctober 16, 2010\nand somehow my mother contacted her and \u2014 which they could do and so there was\na way, people \u2014 some adults could go there, and he spent time til \u2014 he probably went\nthere in January or February \u00b039, and he stayed there til April \u201940.",
        "Q: Okay. So, how long was he in Dachau?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, about three or four weeks?",
        "Q: Okay. So, when he came back, you \u2014 were you in Mannheim? Or were you still\nat the school and \u2014",
        "A: No, I was \u2014 I was in Holland already.",
        "Q: Oh, okay. So what \u2014 what kind of things did you have to do to prepare to leave?\nLike what kind of things did you pack, do you remember?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s no different than going to a boarding school.",
        "Q: Right, I guess, yeah.",
        "A: I mean, I had my experience, having been in four boarding schools; three \u2014 three\nin Italy, and one in Germany, and so I \u2014I pretty well knew what was needed.",
        "Q: So you \u2014 did you feel \u2014 do you recall leaving your family? Was it different than\nthe other times you had left for boarding schools?",
        "A: No. So this was in the system.",
        "Q: Yeah. You took a train there, to Holland?\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: Yeah. We first \u2014 they took it from Mannheim, then they had us stay overnight,\neither in Frankfurt, or in Cologne, I forgot. And they collected people from other\nlocations, and they put them on a common train and took us into Rotterdam.",
        "Q: Where did you go from Rotterdam?",
        "A: Well, we first of all, I had \u2014 at Rotterdam we stayed for a while in the quarantine\nstation. That happened to \u2014 every port at that time had a quarantine station. And \u2014\ncause they didn\u2019t know whether the sailors came back with tropical illnesses or stuff\nlike that. But there was a facility, was guarded by Dutch military. We could not\nleave, but we could have visitors. For instance, my sisters and theirs \u2014 and their\nfoster parents, that cheese manufacturer, they came and visited me there. But we\nstayed in big barracks. There wasn\u2019t much to do, but then a short time afterwards, I\nwas able to go do what is mispronounced in the States as gouda, what should be\npronounced howda(ph). And there we were in a \u2014 in an old orphanage, and 1n that\norphanage we also had quite a few refugee teachers. And since the academic training\nsome of the kids had, was quite different between them. And if you were, let\u2019s say at\n\u2014 some more advanced training in languages and literature and math or science, and\nyou had the math teacher there, and you knew you were interested in that, he really\nspent a lot of time. But I must give credit for being able to graduate from a U.S. high\nschool on the week of my 16\" birthday, after having been in the country about 14\nmonths.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "Q: That\u2019s pretty impressive.",
        "A: And I still had language problems with it, but \u2014",
        "Q: What language did you speak when you were in Holland?",
        "A: I think \u2014 well, among the kids where we were staying, there was primarily\nGerman, and the teachers, these were all German speaking teachers.\n[indecipherable] it\u2019s a mass instruction, only you had literature, you had German\nliterature. Maybe a little \u2014 little English, or I don\u2019t know, we spo \u2014 we learned some\nDutch, we had some Dutch people coming in and \u2014",
        "Q: But you lived primarily with other German children?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. How long were you in Holland?",
        "A: Well, from about January \u201939 til April \u201940. And I was in \u2014 after about \u2014 I was for\na short time in Amsterdam, which was also a quarantine station, it was a holding\nplace. And they did a few things \u2014 for instance, I learned glass blowing there. But\nvery primitive, I mean, the very beginnings of it. But they kept \u2014 they had some\nvocational instructors. And then I went to Wieringen. Now that is a important place.\nIt is what used to be known as an aliyah ca \u2014 preparation camp. Familiar with it?",
        "Q: Mm-mm.",
        "A: For \u2014 the term?",
        "Q: Mm-mm, no.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: Aliyah. That is the mo \u2014 Zionist movement to go \u2014 preparing you to go to Israel.\nSo we had academic training, and we had agricultural training, and vocational\ntraining. And this is the first time I was involved with oil and gas, because we f \u2014\nthey found out the thing 1s, for the training, this \u2014 that was in the place of the\nZuiderzee, which had been reclaimed from the sea, that land. But you had swamp\ngas coming up through the water. And we collected the swamp gas and f \u2014 and had\nthe equipment, that it could be used productively for heating and agricultural and\ncooking things. And this is not in the area of \u2014 farther east in Groningen, where they\ndiscovered afterward were two \u2014 some very big gas fields. But this is probably not\nrelated. I never heard of this, what we found there, because it was only bubbling up.\nAnd we had a container that collected it, and so we \u2014 they had \u2014 we built, and then\nwe did agricultural things. For instance, it\u2019s interesting using that kind of a country\nplace to prepare people for Israel, where this was too much water, as compared to\nIsrael having lack of water. But they \u2014 they built that particular facility there, and it\nwas a productive fa-farm. I think they produced or \u2014 everything was consumed that\nwas produced. They raised all kind of big animals.",
        "Q: Were you in contact with your family at this \u2014 at this time?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were they in England?\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: No, my mother was in Germany. She did not go to England because her parents\nwere too old to go to England.",
        "Q: But your father was in England?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Wha-What was your \u2014 tell me about your mother.",
        "A: Well, my mother was born in Berlin, but her parents moved to Mannheim when\nthey retired, when they got old enough, they needed somebody, one of their children\nto \u2014 when the mother \u2014 my mother, taking care of the thing. And then she 1s \u2014 was\nacademically trained, she never got her full degree, but she couldn\u2019t make up her\nmind whether to study law or medicine. She did some of each, but never finished it \u2014\nit, and after \u2014 when the war had started, and after Paris had fallen, and the Vichy\ngovernment was established, they made that province, which was Baden, which 1s\nwhere Mannheim, Heidelberg ar-are located, they made it Judenfrei. Free of Jews,\nand they de-deported all of them to a concentration camp in the Pyrenees called\nconda \u2014 called Gurs, g-u-r-s. You heard about that one?",
        "Q: Yeah, I know that one.",
        "A: Okay. [indecipherable] Gurs. Actually the \u2014 the S 1s not pronounced in \u2014 in the\nFrench thing, and she stayed there for a while, together with her mother. Her father\ndid not survive the transport. And \u2014 yeah. They lived pretty well in the mud. These \u2014\nthis was built for Spanish loyalists who fled across from Spain to the French border,\nOctober 16, 2010\nwhen they were being defeated. And so it didn\u2019t have too many comfort, it was for\nyoung military people, but there was \u2014 food was somewhat limited. But since my\nmother was fluent in French, she was part of the delegation that went to local\nfarmers and try \u2014 tried to talk them out of more food, and stuff like that. And then\nshe and her mother were transferred to Marseilles, and my mother had a vi-visa to\ngo to the States also. Otherwi \u2014 in the meantime, lotsa thing; I had been \u2014 we had\nbeen in the States. I went from Holland, picked up \u2014 we picked up my f-\u2014 my sisters\nand I, we picked up my father in Southampton, and went to the States. And then we\nlived in New York for a while. But then my mother was in Marseilles, and she was\nable to catch a boat, a French boat that was going to Martinique, which 1s the \u2014 one\nof the French states or provinces. And \u2014 but since France, Vichy, France was at war\nwith England, a British warship captured that ship and brought it into Trinidad. So\nthey were interned as, I guess enemy aliens in Trinidad. But then from there we\nwere in contact with her in the States, we were able to get arrangements to get a boat\nto go from Trinidad to New York. And she just got there in time to see me graduate\nfrom high school.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s back up, back to you being in Holland. So y \u2014 how long \u2014 how long\nwere you in Holland, total?",
        "A: Let\u2019s see. \u201939 to \u2014 about 14 months.",
        "Q: So how did you get from Holland to America? Did you have to get a visa?\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah. That visa had been put in, and there was \u2014 when it came, you\nknow, number came up, and somebody was \u2014 from the committee there, took us to\nthe pier. We left from na \u2014 we didn\u2019t leave from Holland, we left from Belgium.\nThe ship left in Antwerp. And then by that time, Germany and England were\nalready at war. And we went to \u2014 on the way to Southampton we spotted floating\nmines near Southampton, but none of them were set up. I saw them later on when I\nwent from France to England \u2014 from England to France with the U.S. Army. And\nthe other G.I.s tried to shoot and set off the floating mines, but they never hit the\nright spot. You got a pl-place about this big, at a long distance, to \u2014 you know, this is\nto set it off [indecipherable] point. If you just hit the body, the body of the floating\nmine is heavy steel, and the machine guns did not penetrate that.",
        "Q: So \u2014",
        "A: But anyhow \u2014",
        "Q: Where did your sa \u2014 where did your family settle when you emigrated to\nAmerica?",
        "A: First we were staying with the family of my father\u2019s brother, who had been there\nfor a while. And \u2014 in Manhattan, on 91\" Street.",
        "Q: And you \u2014 you attended high school there?",
        "A: Yeah.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "Q: Was it difficult ler \u2014 did you have to learn the language? Had you spoken English\nbefore?",
        "A: Little bit.",
        "Q: So was \u2014",
        "A: But I learned it after a while, and they \u2014 I \u2014 the teachers were actually excellent.\nThat was a \u2014 not a particular prestigious high school. In fact, about half of them\ncame from Harlem, and one-third c-came from Hell\u2019s Kitchen. So the teachers\nwere very happy to have some kids who had more academic training. In fact, the\ninteresting situation, the kids who made the honor roll, two-thirds of them were\nforeign born. The ones who competed for valedictorian, nearly all of them spoke\nwith an accent. I don\u2019t \u2014 I was competing for it, but I had a big argument with my\nEnglish teacher, who was a reviewer of the thing, and an argument when we read\nJulius Caesar, and I argued with her when \u2014 either, I think, either Cassius or\n[indecipherable] says, I forgot, because he was ambitious, I killed him. And I wrote\nmy speech on the necessity for ambition. And the teacher recognized that argument I\nhad with her, so I was blackballed on that. I had made the honor roll when I\ngraduated, but I did not get the valedictorian speech. But then I did something else.\nSince I had such a mixed up previous education, I went to the different departments,\nand in some case I took a regent examination, and I passed it and then I got credit for\nthe course, that got me through that fast. And some of them I just talked my way, I\nOctober 16, 2010\nthink. I got some credits in art appreciation because I reviewed all the things I had\nseen in the \u2014 in the Italian and the Dutch and the German museums. And I could\ndistinguish different schools of painting and stuff like that, because my parents were\nvery insistent when we went to these museums that I could identify what it was, or\nwho the \u2014 and I convinced them that I knew enough about art appreciation, I could\nget credit for it.",
        "Q: Good for you.",
        "A: And I got all these language credits, and I did all right on math. So \u2014",
        "Q: You have a very diverse education.",
        "A: Yeah, then, the only thing is, I had to take fo \u2014 you had to take eight semesters of\nhigh school English, and I \u2014 I doubled up on them. They let me do that. And in fact,\nI don\u2019t know, I even got in one of the honor classes. I don\u2019t know how I ever did\nthat, but \u2014 and I think maybe I ever had done more reading, not only in English, but\nin things in the international literature.",
        "Q: So you graduated from high school when you were 16, and then did you join \u2014",
        "A: 16 and a day, I was very old.",
        "Q: Oh, right after your birthday. So \u2014",
        "A: I was very unhappy. Graduation \u2014 some gi \u2014 schools graduated on Tuesday, some\nWednesday, some Thursday. My school graduated on Thursday. They only had so\nOctober 16, 2010\nmany caps and gowns to go around. If I would have been on Tuesday school, I\nwould have made it with 15. Wednesday was my birthday.",
        "Q: What did you do after graduation?",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 I was a\u2014 that summer I was a junior con \u2014 a swimming counselor in a\ncamp, and then shortly thereafter, my parents moved to Ohio, and I couldn\u2019t get a\ndecent job because of my age. Even as a draftsman, they thought I might prick\nmyself with a pencil. But those days the labor laws were ridiculous for a 16 year old,\nand said, why don\u2019t you go back to high school? I said, I graduated from there. So I\ngot some helper jobs, not very much and I started to do some vocational training, I\nwent to a local high school and I took some evening courses in machine shop. I\nhadn\u2019t done much work in machine shop, but I was interested in those things. And\nthen, shortly before we got into war, we had defense preparatory courses offered by\ndifferent schools. And since I was in Columbus, Ohio, Ohio State provide that\ncourse, and I took some of these courses, which were non-credit courses. But when I\nbec \u2014 later on when I was able to afford to go to college, I talked to the prof who\ntaught me the courses I had on [indecipherable] and I convinced him I didn\u2019t have\nto take the course, he would give me academic credit for it. So that helped me. And I\nhad \u2014 in fact, one of the guys was, 1-in one of the fields, the number one man in the\ncountry, who happened to be the head of the department for engineering drawing at\nOhio State. So, and then I went full time, from the beginning of \u201942 until November\nOctober 16, 2010\nof \u00b043. In the meantime, I got a letter called greetings, your neighbors want you to\nrepresent them in the armed forces. So the day \u2014 the day before Thanksgiving \u00b043\nwas my first day active duty. And on Thanksgiving day was my first day of KP. And\nthat was a big job that time. Then I spent time in the army, I was being \u2014 with\nengineering back on \u2014 they put me into a signal corps, which, I mean, technical\nthings, and then I went to something called ASTP, are you familiar with that term?",
        "Q: N-No.",
        "A: It was Army Specialized Training Program. What they had there, they didn\u2019t\nknow how long the war would last, and since no new kids were graduating from\ncollege, or very few, they had programs to give academic training and provide\npeople for leadership and more responsibility later on. And they had it in two\ndifferent \u2014 in several fields, one of them was linguistically, and the other one was\nengineering. So I went to the University of Illinois, where they tested me, and I\nqualified both for language and for engineering. But I f\u2014 was looking long term, so I\nsigned up for the engineering type, and they sent me to Rutgers University for about\nsix months, to study engineering. And I got this \u2014 these were academic courses, so I\ngot credit later on at Ohio State for the work I did there. And then, as they figured\nthe war seems to have been coming to the end, this was after D-Day, and they\nlooked like this \u2014 this program was sending kids to college, was terminating, so I\napplied \u2014 I figured engineering and languages, I applied for military government\nOctober 16, 2010\ntransfer. But somehow they didn\u2019t \u2014 somehow they figured they needed me for\nmilitary intelligence. So they sent me to Camp Ritchie, if you ever heard of that.",
        "Q: Mm-mm.",
        "A: The so called Ritchie boys. This was \u2014 Camp Ritchie is in \u2014 near Hagerstown,\nMaryland, and this was the military intelligence training center. In fact, there\u2019s a\nvery good movie out, was made by a German company, called, \u201cThe Ritchie Boys,\u201d\nand what happened, 1-it was quite \u2014 it was very fair. They took people who had a\ncertain high I.Q. \u2014 I forgot what the army called the thing right now \u2014 and they were\nfluent in a language that was of interest; German or Italian or French. We were not\nthat much concerned with eastern European languages. And they had a similar thing\non the west coast, in br \u2014 in Monterey, for people who were \u2014 were interested in\nAsiatic languages, and getting involved there. So I got to that camp, which they cou\n\u2014on my orders I\u2019d even \u2014 couldn\u2019t even say where I\u2019m going to. And that movie\nthey made about it, I don\u2019t know whether Holocaust Museum has \u2014 hat that, it\u2019s \u2014\nbut it\u2019s \u2014 but it\u2019s a very interesting link. And these people did all kind of jobs,\ninterrogation of prisoners during wa \u2014 during the fighting. And the most famous\nattendee of that school was Henry Kissinger. But he graduated from there before I \u2014\nI went there. And what happened? We \u2014 when we were finished, we knew more\nabout the German military, the civil service, the reliability, things, when people were\n\u2014 were promoted on certain jobs, they had certain jobs, which ones were considered\nOctober 16, 2010\nhighly \u2014 higher the liability for the Nazi regime. Or some of them were just \u2014\nbecause the skill of somebody was, let\u2019s say, the county engineer. Well, that\u2019s\nbecause he si \u2014 knew how to put in sewer systems. But \u2014 and the \u2014 was \u2014 and I d\u2014I\ndidn\u2019t get finished with that til after V-E Day, so was lucky when I went overseas, I\ndidn\u2019t have to do any fighting. But I was involved in a lot of interesting episodes. I\nwas in, for instance, typically in my favorite stories, things that happened. There\nwere \u2014 for instance, when there was a security raid in the occupation, because U.S.\nArmy was invo \u2014 [indecipherable] was concerned that the Germans might pull\nOperation Werwolf. That was the same thing, the name \u2014 tag name they gave to\nwhat the French were doing with the Maquis. Resistance. So they tried to undermine\nit. I know \u2014 so they, sometimes they had raids and thing, looking for weapons, and\nlooking for people that were on the [indecipherable] list. And wa \u2014 they had guys\nlike me, assigned to battalion headquarter, and if they brought in something that was\nsuspicious, I had to give it for a screening. I know one time they brought in a guy\nwith a fancy uniform, brass buttons, and a red cap. And I looked at him and I looked\nhis I.D. and I looked at his brass button, and it said RB, which means Reichsbahn.\nAnd said, take that guy back to the railway station, he is the station master. But the\nnormal G.I. wouldn\u2019t know th-that guy from another guy with a German uniform.",
        "Q: That\u2019s funny.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: So this is a \u2014 this was some of the funny things, but I mean, I could \u2014 you could\nsee they had support. I mean, people like myself, and colleagues of mine, who could\nthought things out. Not that they think they gotta arrest a guy because he wears a\nuniform. But he just \u2014 the kind of thing that I think is a funny story.",
        "Q: How long were you in Germany with the army? Were you \u2014 you were stationed\nin Germany, right?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How long were you there?",
        "A: Oh, let\u2019s see. I got there, let\u2019s see, it was probably about from September or\nOctober \u201945, til \u2014 and the story gets complicated before it gets cleared up \u2014 and I\nstayed there until December \u201947. And then I was also involved in war crimes trials. I\nwas an investigator for one of the guys who got accused, got indicted for the\nNuremberg trials, but he was never tried, because we could not get good evidence\non him. Plus when we blew his safe and found all kind of thi \u2014 interesting things on\nthere, including a letter from the Kaiser, because the guy was very important in\nWorld War I. The biggest gun in World War I was named after his wife.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Big Bertha. Did you ever hear about that? That gun?",
        "Q: No.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: It was the \u2014 then \u2014 the guy was Alfred Krupp, from the Krupp factory,\nmunitions maker and steel factory. And situation, they were in the Nuremberg trials\nand I was at a briefing by Supreme Court Justice Jackson, who was the prosecutor\nfor Nuremberg. And I attended one of these meetings; they said, as you investigate,\nyou gotta look for two things. Cri \u2014 preparing for and conducting aggressive warfare.\nThat we found Krupp, because he was building tanks and stuff like that, and testing\nthem, and things of that nature \u2014 other war material. The other one was crimes\nagainst humanity; slave labor and that kind of stuff. And this ma \u2014 old man, Krupp\n\u2014and I have a lot of his personal history, to \u2014 was in \u2014 retired, I think because of\nhealth reasons, about the same t \u2014 about the time Paris fell. So that\u2019s before slave\nlabor because a problem. And his son took over. So \u2014 and he and his son didn\u2019t get\nalong at all. And so he had \u2014 the \u2014 the old man didn\u2019t have anything to do with the\noperation of the factory, or their personnel, or policies. He was there collecting his\nretirement pay, and that\u2019s about all. In fact, it\u2019s an interesting situation, that this guy\nis, when he was born, was not \u2014 his name was not Krupp, because old man Krupp,\nwho was very big before World War I, who built up the factory a lot, Alfred Krupp,\nand he ha \u2014 only had daughters, he had no sons. But he wanted to perpetuate the\nname and the family. So the Kaiser had an edict by which the boyfriend, who was\nGustav von Bohlen und Halbach, was going to marry the Krupp woman, one of\nthe Krupp daughters, could combine the name, Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach.\nOctober 16, 2010\nSo he maintained his nobility name, but he main \u2014 he kept his \u2014 kept the Krupp\nname in the family. So there was a special edict, I don\u2019t know what year that was\ndone, but it\u2019s an interesting situation.",
        "Q: Yeah, it is interesting.",
        "A: And I used to have si \u2014 copy of his \u2014 I used to have his passport for a while.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were there any other cases, like war crime trials that you worked on? The cr \u2014 the\nKrupp case and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, that was the only one for Nuremberg. But then I worked for \u2014 well, again\nby the pe \u2014 if I talk about things you know, I me \u2014 stop me. During the Yalta\nConference, where they decided the war crime trial concept, said there was people\nwho were involved on an international basis, who were supposed to be tried by the\ninternational court, which were then Nuremberg. But things had happened, like\nconcentration camp or slave labor, in the countries whose zone of occupation was \u2014\nwas war crimes against individuals of that nationality, were supposed to be tried by\ncourts of that ka \u2014 courts of that cor \u2014 of that nationality. For instance, again, there\u2019s\nan interesting history which is \u2014 don\u2019t know whether \u2014 how well known that was,\nwhen the \u2014 when the \u2014 when \u2014 during the fighting, U.S. troops got as far as the Elba\nriver. That meant they went past \u2014 through Thuringen where the ca \u2014 main town is\nOctober 16, 2010\nWeimar, and where also Buchenwald was located there, just nearby there. And\nthen, after the \u2014 they rearranged the zones and \u2014 and that area of Weimar became\nRussian zone. So, since we had the evidence, like lampshades made from human bl \u2014\nfrom human skin, and SS guards and oth \u2014 and all kind of stuff, including the wife of\nthe former commandant, Ilse Koch, and \u2014 more about her later. I said I have a long\nhistory of \u2014 [indecipherable] history. And so \u2014 so we moved before our troops\nwithdrew from that area, and the Russians moved in. We took all the stuff and put it\ninto a facility in Dachau. We could intern the prisoners and had enough storage\nfacilities to store the evidence. And there was a mission. Since \u2014 since Buchenwald\nwas supposed to be tried by Russia, and since this is the Russian zone, we \u2014 we had\na team of about two, three attorneys and about four linguists, who went through all\nthat stuff that had been collected, and they \u2014 the lawyers put it into a legal\ndocumentation, to turn over to the Russians, that they could use it as evidence. But\nthe wi \u2014 Russians refused to accept it. They did not want to annoy the Germans. It\u2019s\nin their zone, they wanted to say the communists are not doing things that Germany\nlook bad. So they refused to do this. And so about \u2014 that was before Churchill spoke\nabout the Iron Curtain. That was Russia did not live up to its commitment under\nthe Yalta Conference. So it\u2019s \u2014 for many years later \u2014 about two years later they\nwould \u2014 the Buchenwald people were tried in American war crimes trial, and I\nparticipated in that one. There were some interesting people [indecipherable] were\nOctober 16, 2010\nthere, and later on I got into the war crimes trials in Dachau \u2014 in Dachau. The U.S.\ntrials. And one of the most in \u2014 at times I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to do that. For a\nwhile I was either assistant to the prosecutor, assistant to the defense counselor, and\nwas [indecipherable] court interpreter. Was sometimes assistant to the judge,\nbecause they had terms, which different people translated different ways. And they\nwere \u2014 the judges were confused and they said, we heard this was said to them, to\nthem, what \u2014 how it happened? And then I had to figure out these were the same \u2014\ntranslating 1t back into German, these were the same organization. So, and \u2014 but\nthere was \u2014 there was some interesting people there. Probably the most famous \u2014 one\nof the most famous person who was tried there, but he was acquitted, that was Otto\nSkorzeny. Did you ever heard about that name\u2019? Otto Skorzeny was the commander\nof the German Ranger. In fact, he became famous. After the Italian partisans had ca-\ncaptured Mussolini and kept him on top of a mountain as a prisoner, his ranger unit,\nwith gliders and with mountain troops, stormed that place and rescued Mussolini.\nThe partisan got Mussolini couple months later on and they killed him, but \u2014 but that\nwas the guy. And this guy also became famous during the Battle of the Bulge,\nbecause he was commanding this ranger, German ranger battalion, and he put them\nall in German \u2014 in American uniforms, to go behind our lines \u2014 through our lines and\ndisturb things, maybe destroy signal equipment and put on markers, direction signs,\nturn them around and to ca \u2014 and they were trying to, during the Battle of the Bulge,\nOctober 16, 2010\nthe aim of the Rumsted(ph) offensive was to capture Antwerp. And he was an\nimportant part, but he was being tried \u2014 tried [indecipherable] for that. But there\nwas an interesting thing. The prosecutor was a famous lawyer from Atlanta, who\nhad \u2014 he was usually a defense counselor, and he lost most of the cases, as defense\ncounselor in war crimes trials. But he was a prosecutor, and he lost that one, because\nthere was a guy who was \u2014 I don\u2019t even know whether he was a lawyer or not, or he\nhad some lawyer assistance. And he found out that you cannot get anybody on\nespionage, or sabotage. These are ruses of war. As long as you are not \u2014 as long as\nyou are caught \u2014 not caught in the other country\u2019s uniform. There were some of his\nmen who were caught in American uniforms, and they were shot. But he was caught\nlater on, I forgot whether in German uniform, or in civilian clothes. Therefore that\nstopped it and he was acquitted. And then he became other things, he was \u2014 became\nthe chief of security for Egypt. He was sometimes \u2014 there was a \u2014 were some\narticles written, the most dangerous man in Europe, because he had that wartime\nexperience, and he was helping Egypt. But didn\u2019t do much good. Egyptians didn\u2019t\ndo so well in the Six Day War. But \u2014 so, and then there was also, during the\nBuchenwald trial, there was this wa \u2014 wa \u2014 fo \u2014 the widow of the commandant, and\nshe had been a widow for many years, but she was pregnant. And they tried to find\nout whether it was a Polish guard. There were \u2014 a lot of the guard people were Polish\nDPs. And they were all right. And the Americans pretty well liked them, the only per\nOctober 16, 2010\n\u2014 only one person didn\u2019t like the Polish guards. There was th \u2014 my dog. He always\nbarked at them. And he was a interesting dog.",
        "Q: What kind of dog was it?",
        "A: It was a German Shepherd, a relatively small one. But he was very good pedigree,\nbecause the couple \u2014 the dogs that bred him, used to belong to the German Field\nMarshal Mordell, who, when he lost the [indecipherable] in the \u2014 after U.S. troops\nhad moved east of the Rhine river, he committed suicide. Right before that, he gave\nhis matched pair of dogs to a local farmer. And I found out about those dogs. And he\nbred them, and I got one of his offsprings. But then, the kind of situations that people\ndo \u2014 in the thing, for instance, I was stationed in Dachau that time, and we had took\na barrack where we get some veterinarians who were prisoners, and we dro \u2014 got a\ncouple veterinarians and a couple farm boys, and we had a veterinary clinic, because\nsome of us had to go out of town for a couple of weeks, so we left the dogs there.\nBut they were too \u2014 even too dumb to make sure they had all the medicine, so they\ndied of distemper. Dist \u2014 the medicine was not easily available in Germany, but we\ncould have send it, call \u2014 contacted our parents and have it sent from the States. So\nthe dog did not \u2014 did not survive. But this 1s \u2014 but lot of the G.I.s had these thing.\nAnd by the way, if you keep pe \u2014 these people busy, I was working for a while, that\nwas before that, in an internment camp, where they had people who \u2014 who were not\naccused of anything, but they were considered security risks, because they had really\nOctober 16, 2010\nhigh positions in the party, or in civil service, or in the military. That\u2019s primary \u2014 not\nin the general army, but in the S.S. or something like that. And they were housed in\nGerman army barracks, and they lived better than the population because they had\nall the heat, the hot water, they had decent food, which was short at that time, but\nthey were bored. So we arranged with them, a craft shop. Some of them were very\nhandy. And I have \u2014 still have at home, four paintings which \u2014 watercolors, about\nthis size, which the guy did from memory, and they are very nice paintings, and I\nreally treasure them. And they were \u2014 didn\u2019t have much stuff, they were\n[indecipherable] canvas, they were the back of the ration boxes. So they\nimprovised, and I got them home, I got them framed. And they didn\u2019t want to get\npaid in money. They said, if you do \u2014 if it\u2019s \u2014 you know, we \u2014 well, it was good\nrelationship between these craftsmen and the G.L.s. They said no, I would appreciate\nit rather, if you would send a package with some chocolates or some other candy to\nmy wife or to my kids. And we got that at the PX. So it\u2019s, again, the people who had\n\u2014 we were sorting out who was a real security risk, who was \u2014 on the war crimes\nwanted list that was put down \u2014 put out by all the countries, sorting things out, and\nthese were primarily the guys, the Ritchie boys. And they were very young guys. I\nthink our detachment commander, he was old, he was 21 years old. He was a second\nlieutenant. But this \u2014 oh, sorry.",

So \u2014 interesting thing is while I was in \u2014\ninvestigating in that [indecipherable] team, I met a young lady who was the \u2014 a\ntelephone operator for the British organization, it was British zone of occupation.\nAnd she had been a telephone operator for the German post office, the post office\nwas running the telephone system in Germany at that time. And then she was\ndelegated to be the private telephone operator for the state adjutant general. I mean,\nshe was very good in it, to get that particular thing. And then when the British took\nover, she went \u2014 became telephone operator for one of the British headquarters.\nThere was a [indecipherable] commission, they \u2014 since this is the area where the \u2014\nwhich produced the most coal, and they rationed the coal allocations through all the\noccupation areas.

        "Q: Sorry to hear that.",
        "A: So when we got married in Dachau, by the mayor of Dachau. In fact, we were, I\nthink the second couple involving a G.I. and a war bride, that was married by that\nguy. But he gave an endlessly long speech, and we were then supposed to have a\nreception at the officers\u2019 club. And we were getting late and late, so when we finally\ngot through, we told the driver to step on it, and we got a speeding ticket from the\nMPs. But then we had a reception at the \u2014 or a din \u2014 a nice dinner at the\n[indecipherable] club. And \u2014 and a band and everything else.",
        "Q: What year was this?\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: F-For \u2014 \u201947. In fact, this is one reason when the \u2014 I stayed longer in Europe than\nI had to, because when I was supposed to come back for discharge, come back to the\nStates, I could not bring my \u2014 I could not get married, I was \u2014 as a G.I. you had to\nget permission by the military to marry, and I could not get that permission, and\nwithout that she couldn\u2019t come to the States. So, since there was a shortage of\npeople, they offered all kind of incentives for people to stay there if they had certain\nskills. And I stayed there as a civilian, where I made quite a bit more money, but I\nwas a -\u2014 they had a uniform for the civilians. So \u2014 and it was important that you wore\nsome service ribbons, that meant you were not a carpetbagger. Some guys, they just\nwent there and never in the service, but the fact that you were in the service, you\nwere accepted by them. And we could go to the R and R centers in the \u2014 near the\nAlps and used to have some good times over the weekends. And was on a lake, and\nearly morning there had to be a festival. And then you went on a sailboat. They\nrigged it for you, you didn\u2019t have to rig it yourself, and then we sailed until\nlunchtime. And then there was a \u2014 then there\u2019d be a party in the afternoon. So \u2014 and\nwith an oompah-pah bands and all this kind of stuff. No, this 1s the \u2014 G.Ls at that\nparticular time, if they could get to those places, the army took good care of them.\nExcept one thing is, there was one of the experiences my wife had. We went to a\nplace where we knew there was an R and R center, we went there, but we did not\nknow that was for blacks. But we asked them whether we could have lunch there.\nOctober 16, 2010\nSaid yes. But then we sat on a table, and there was some blacks sitting on the table,\nthey said, hey you, you can\u2019t sit there with them. That\u2019s \u2014 that was the U.S. military\nin \u00b046 - \u00b047, before Truman integrated the military in \u2014 forgot again the year that\nwas. Yeah, I think it was one of the first things he did. I think he did that after \u2014 after\nV-J Day. Well, okay, then we got married there, and we could go over \u2014 we went\nback to the States.",

        "Q: Oh, congratulations.",
        "A: Thank you. I got \u2014 had quite a bit of involvement with the \u2014 I was member of a\nindustry review board to advise profs what kind of things are strong, that industry\nneeds and they sho \u2014 should emph \u2014 things they should emphasize. For instance, one\nof my biggest complaint, I think that\u2019s not only with engineers, but with other\npeople, too \u2014 you went to college, did you?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Which one did you go to?\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "Q: Well, I bounced around, but I graduated from North Dakota State University.",

Whenever I had \u2014 I was in \u2014\nin Gillette, Wyoming. I was working in a coal mine there. And let\u2019s see \u2014 no, this is\n\u2014 no, this was quite interesting, to get the \u2014 to work with the profs and do things, and\nthis 1s \u2014 yeah, I mean, the things I said, which is something wa \u2014 most universities\nmake a big mistake. When you went to college, whatever you studied, when you\nwrote a term paper, or had to give a report, who was your target audience?",
        "Q: My professor.",
        "A: Yeah. Somebody who knew much more about it than you did. In real life, most of\nthe people deal with people that know less about it. For instance, when I learned\nabout computer, they told me to toggle over, and I looked for a toggle switch. I\nmean, the kind of terminology. Doctors are great for using terms which nobody\nunderstands unless you\u2019re a doctor yourself. Engineers do that too, accountants at\ntimes, and \u2014",
        "Q: Everybody does.",
        "A: Yeah. Th-That\u2019s where you were trained. And I was trying to get the school to\nmandate that the ki \u2014 that the students take a course in public speaking. True non-\nspecialists in \u2014 let\u2019s see, what is that organization that gives speeches?\nOctober 16, 2010",

        "A: Yeah, Toastmaster.",
        "Q: Oh, Toastmaster.",
        "A: Yeah. The kind of a thing that they do there by which you are asked to give, for\ninstance, this is something I either learned in the military, then when I get back, after\nI started working there, I also went back in the reserve. And I progressed quite a bit\nthere, and I commanded a unit, and I had some fun with something. It was\n[indecipherable] we had inspection from a guy from Washington coming, I don\u2019t\nknow, from headquarters. And I kn-knew about it, when that was, and I scheduled\ncommanders time. And one of my favorite things to schedule there 1s \u2014 1t was during\nthe Eisenhower administration, [indecipherable] for peace. And I was involved in\nbuilding the first commercial nuclear plant in this country. And so I| talked about\nhow they operate and I had the drawings all over the wall, and \u2014 til I found out the\ninspector hadn\u2019t heard about that, but I could put it in a way that this guy who was\nmaybe an accountant or something like that, or an auditor could fo \u2014 could follow it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so in fact, I had some fun. I had my senior non-com was a high school\nteacher, and I made a deal with him: whenever I gave a lecture \u2014 and I had to do that\nOctober 16, 2010\nonce a week, we met once a week and \u2014 for two hours \u2014 one hour I had to do the\nwork; he critiqued it. He took notes, what I did well, what I didn\u2019t do well: talking\ntoo fast, not getting things organized, talking to the blackboard, all that kind of\nmistake. Using terms that were not defined. So after the meetings, we went to the\nnearby legion post and we both had beer, and he gave me a critique. And I am very\nthankful for what he has done for me. And I have addressed, I think last year at Ohio\nState, I addressed a group of about 400 people.",
        "Q: Wow, that\u2019s incredible.",
        "A: Yeah, so it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2014I feel comfortable with doing that.",
        "Q: Yeah, you\u2019ve had lots of practice.",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: You\u2019re have lots of practice.",
        "A: Yeah, right, yeah. Doing that and then back in the engineering part, I had to\ntestify, or talk to governmental agencies. Like one time in Canada and one time in\nMalaysia. Kuala Lumpur.",
        "Q: Malaysia, wow.",
        "A: We were doing something that was non-standard, and I had to defend it. So there\nwere a lot of people, some of them were technically trained, some were not. Why\nwe\u2019re doing it, what we\u2019re doing, what the risk was, and what the training was for to\nbe done properly, and what the results are from the testing that had been done\n43October 16, 2010\nbefore. But I felt quite comfortable even talking to a foreign country like in Kuala\nLumpur.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to stop the \u2014 the track, and we\u2019re going to start a new one, cause it\u2019s\nalmost \u2014",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of File One\nOctober 16, 2010\nBeginning File Two",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Harry Ebert, conducted by Annie Erling, on the 16\" of October,\n2010, at the Kindertransport Association Conference at Arlington, Virginia. So,\ndo you have any children with Hanni?",
        "A: No, no, we decided we didn\u2019t want any. But I have nephews and nieces with\nwhom I\u2019m quite close, and \u2014",
        "Q: Did you s \u2014 did you stay in Columbus, Ohio?",
        "A: No, when I graduated, I went to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and then I went to\nMarietta, Ohio. In fact, there I worked for a company, and they had a Marietta\nCollege, and they had some night courses in business related things, but to be an\naccredited thing where you could get a degree, they had to take some science\ncourses. But the science faculty at Marietta College were so lazy, and they didn\u2019t\nhave a graduate school, so they didn\u2019t have the graduate students who could \u2014 would\nteach those. So the \u2014 the dean of the gradu \u2014 of the night school got people out of\nindustry. I was teaching physics, and engineering drawing, and they had some other\npeople were teaching accounting and chemistry and stuff like that. So the wa \u2014 it was\nquite, quite interesting. In fact, 1t was like teaching liberal arts because maybe I\ntalked about a different piece of equipment in a power plant, and some guy says, oh,\nI know all about it. This is depreciated over five years, because the guy was in\nOctober 16, 2010\naccounting. But he had no idea what in the world it was doing, why it was there. So I\ntried to clear that up. No, it\u2019s all right. So \u2014",
        "Q: Is there anything else that you\u2019d like to \u2014",
        "A: Well, yeah, that\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019ve stayed \u2014 stayed in the military, and I got \u2014 had a \u2014 had \u2014\nalso had a \u2014 what was known as a mobilization designation. That meant \u2014 familiar\nwith that term?",
        "Q: Mm-mm, no.",
        "A: That means you are training for a job that\u2019s held by somebody else, in case a\nballoon goes up, one of you guys \u2014 maybe we\u2019|l split the headquarter, and we need\ntwo people with that training, and I used \u2014 I did that, and I was in the intelligence\nbranch. And one of the things that I was really trying to push, and we were\nsuccessful \u2014 that was during the Cold War era, that we had linguistic training. People\ntraining in linguistic and it was all packed military items. We had several reserve\nunits. We were lucky; the Cold War never got hot. We di \u2014 they didn\u2019t have to be\ncalled up. Maybe some people got called up during the Berlin crisis, but well, there\nwas not \u2014 then we were prepared, as compared \u2014 and I may be talking politics now,\nduring the Gulf Wars, we had not \u2014 the government had not prepared linguists who\ncould speak Arabic. I\u2019m sure there are plenty guys around there who are maybe\npeople who immigrated from Jordan, or immigrated from Israel or Palestine, or\nsome of these \u2014 Egypt, or some of the other countries, who could handle these\nOctober 16, 2010\nlanguages. And so it \u2014 it was \u2014 no, then, that\u2019s interesting. When I \u2014 I was working\nfor Exxon for \u2014 as an engineering specialist for about 30 years, and I worked in 22\ncountries, often teaching courses there. And you learn some of the tricks of the trade\nof how teaching in a foreign country. For instance, I was giving a course in Japan,\nand I found a commercial book, or an advert \u2014 actually a catalog by a company that\nhad published the same thing in English and in Japanese. I had the English one, so I\ngot the Japanese one, and got one of those for each of my students from the supplier,\nand if I wanted a certain graph, maybe I had a slide, but then for the Japanese to read\nthings about it, I would have in there saying E page 42, J page 52, so they could\nlook up the reference material. Plus, the idea of simple sentences. Many p \u2014 and\nspeaking very slowly. If I would have a foreign speaking audience \u2014 foreign\nlanguage speaking audience, I would speak about this pace. And no k \u2014 no\ncomplicated sentences, which the French can do the conditionnel. I don\u2019t know\nwhether we use that in English, the conditional case.",
        "Q: I\u2019m bad at grammar.",
        "A: I mean, when you insert, the green house, which is located on the next street. You\nknow, by inserting that thing.",

        "A: Is for sale. I mean, if that\u2019s \u2014 that is loca \u2014 the next street. Make that a separate\nsentence. This is putting two thoughts together. So I had a lot of fun with that, and I\nOctober 16, 2010\nstayed in some countries where \u2014 which generally are not known as being Jewish\nfriendly, like Gaddafi\u2019s Libya. I worked there for a while. I was about four times in\nSaudi Arabia, and I worked there, and recently, since I retired, I\u2019m working for \u2014\npart time for a company, and I was in United Emirates.",

        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: That\u2019s incredible.",
        "A: Yeah, I said I worked in 22 countries, and I think I visited 52.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t \u2014 I always liked to go in the Far East. I used to \u2014 I used to enjoy\nThailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan. And I \u2014 I really enjoyed Pakistan. And\nPakistan was one of the most surprises. For instance, I was working there on a\nfertilizer plant, we were rebuilding things, and they \u2014 I had some young engineers.\nAnd about half the young engineers were indigenous females, and they were treated\njust as well, were given assignments equivalent to what the \u2014 the male engineers of\nthe same experience level were getting. So when you, in some, I guess, in the\nprimitive farm areas, this may be different, but in the industrial area, there 1s \u2014 you\nfind out the f \u2014 the female is treated better. And we were sitting all together, having\nlunch and stuff like that.",
        "Q: Oh.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: The only thing is, the guest house I was staying was next to a mosque, and they\nwoke me up every morning when they called for prayer. So, I had a lot of fun with\nthose things. I mean, this is the experiences. I said, I lived history, the same way.\nFirst time I was in Israel \u2014 in fact, to get there I was \u2014 had been in Pakistan, and I\ncou \u2014 they couldn\u2019t f \u2014 you couldn\u2019t fly from Pakistan to Israel, so I flew from\nPakistan to Teheran, Iran, from \u2014 at that time there was \u2014 the shah was still in\ncommand. I \u2014 they could fly from Teheran to Jerusalem. And I decided to do some\nsightseeing. But I figured, these old things, they have been around that long, fine.\nBut it was my military background, I got myself a guide who was fighting in the\nGolan Heights, and we we went up the Golan Heights the same way his unit went\nup. I\u2019m glad they cleared up all the mines. But it was very interesting. That\u2019s another\ninteresting experience dealing with that part of the world. We \u2014 this guy had \u2014 he\nwas Israeli, he had some Arabic friends at one place, and we went there and I got\nsome tea and some dates. Not dates with women, dates the food. And then there\nwere \u2014 near there there was a warehouse, and there were some trucks parked. And\nthese trucks had Israeli license plate, and he said \u2014 they had wing-nuts on them. He\nsaid, you loosen one of those wing-nuts. And they had Jordanese license plates.\nWhat happened? They were taking the famous Jaffa oranges \u2014 although it was not in\nJaffa, it was farther west, but the same type, and transporting them to the Jordanese\n\u2014 to the border between Israel and Jordan, then change the license plate, and then\nOctober 16, 2010\nmoved to \u2014 all the way to Saudi, because Saudi had the money and they \u2014 they\nwanted the \u2014 the better food. So this is a kind of cooperation that the Israeli were\naware what was going on and these Arabic farmers who were growing the oranges\nup there in [indecipherable] were making some money, and I guess the truck drivers\ngot paid. So it was \u2014 no, I\u2019ve been several times visiting Israel, but that was an\ninteresting experience. Also, from the military point of view, there is a place just east\nof \u2014 east of Tel Aviv on a mountain called Kenkillya(ph). From there you could fire\nsome of the bigger guns into Tel Aviv. And I think the Israelis made a big mistake of\nma \u2014 considering part of the West Bank, they should have annexed that, as a\nsecurity, to control the high ground. After they found out at the Golan Heights how\nimportant the high ground is. So I\u2019m sure they had enough people who were\nstudying this thing. And then with the military, I st \u2014 stayed with a co \u2014\n[indecipherable] command general staff college, and stuff like that, which is the\nsecond highest educational thing within the army. The only higher one is Army War\nCollege. I applied for that, but I didn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t get in that one. So I\u2014 I had an\ninteresting time there in involvements and stuff like that, and retired as a full\n[indecipherable] colonel. And in fact, night before last, I stayed in abot \u2014 on\nAberdeen Proving Ground, and I had a VIP suite for myself. I had one and a half\nbedrooms and one and a half baths.",

I figured I didn\u2019t\nwant to drive all the way from New Jersey to Washington and try to fight the\ntraffic, and to get to the hotel in the evening, so I stopped over in Aberdeen and\nworked my way through Baltimore, which is a mess.",

But we were actually staying in a pensionne. And what \u2014 they had\nlessons, and we were located next to the Mediterranean, we could go \u2014 the first\nkids to go swimming, and see the fisherman coming in, and see them eat little fish,\nbian \u2014 biachettis. They eat them all live. And \u2014 well, you also can cook them, but\nwhen you cook them, the fish turns white, except the eyes, and the tail stays silver.\nAnd for beginners, you eat that with tomato sauce, but it tastes better with lemon.\nBut then you see the eyes as you\u2019re putting it in your mouth.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve eaten \u2014 many years later I\u2019ve eaten something that was even more\ndifficult to eat, and that was called balut. I ate that in the Philippines. That is the\negg of a duck, soft boiled, about four days before the egg is hatched. And you eat\neverything except the beak, you use that to cl \u2014 to clean your teeth.",
        "A: And when I was in the Philippines and working there, when \u2014 and we went out\none evening \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m going way back \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 way 1n [indecipherable] we went out with a couple of the other engineers, we\nwent to places, and they \u2014 the last thing on the evening, they saved for me, is a\nbalut.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t know what it was. I think I heard about it lately, but I had a lot of\nbeers with it, and just swallowed. But in the next day, when I went back to the plant,\nit\u2019s like having passed the initiation test. I was not \u2014 not just a gringo, or whatever\nthey call them there. I was initiated \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in their food, and I got better response from the workers.",
        "A: They all knew about it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, September 30\".",
        "A: The conference was October first.",
        "A: The Munich Conference.",
        "A: Well, I went for a short time back to Mannheim, and then I went to a Jewish\nboarding school in Germany, in Halingen. That\u2019s near Ulm. And that was probably\nthe biggest Jewish boarding school that was still remaining in Germany. And that\nOctober 16, 2010\nwas closed, but [indecipherable] very long, except I think they tortured us there, but\nthat\u2019s the teachers. Because every morning, before anything else, we had to run for\nabout half an hour through the woods, hilly and through the woods. There was a\ncommand, wald lauf, which means wood \u2014 running through the wood. And none of\nthe guys, and there were \u2014 they always were may \u2014 everybody who went there\nremembered, that was the worst command that was given there. But then when that\nschool closed after Kristallnacht \u2014 we did not experience anything at Kristallnacht,\nat that school, but it was closed afterwards. And the different buildings were sold to\nvarious people. And the person who bought the boys\u2019 dormitory was Field Marshal\nRommel. So I lived \u2014 I lived in \u2014 slept in Rommel\u2019s house before he did.",
        "A: Well, I went for a short time back to Mannheim, there was a Jewish school there,\nand I went there for a couple of weeks, and then I went to Kindertransport.",
        "A: Friend of our \u2014 that friends of ours took my sisters to Holland, couple days after\nthe Kristallnacht.",
        "A: And they put them into private families, and they were treated very well. The first\none was manufacturers of a cheese \u2014 of a cheese man \u2014 at a cheese factory in a town\ncalled Budehaven(ph), which is in the \u2014 one of the bra-branches of the Rhine,\nOctober 16, 2010\nbefore it gets into the North Sea. And \u2014 but then they couldn\u2019t stay there very long\nbecause it\u2019s \u2014 the wife got very ill and they couldn\u2019t \u2014 they couldn\u2019t do it any more.\nAnd then they went to another family, where the father was a diamond merchant.\nThey lived in a tremendously big house, and they sent their kids, including m-my\nsisters to the best school in Holland, which is the same school that the present queen\nattended. Not at the same time. She\u2019s younger. But it\u2019s the kind of a reputation of the\n\u2014 that time current princess was s-scheduled to go to that school and it\u2019s probably \u2014\nit\u2019s probably wa \u2014 the best high sc \u2014 high school or something like this in Holland.\nBecause of that it got that royal ey \u2014 interjection.",
        "A: Yeah, when we became available, it was [indecipherable] short notice. It didn\u2019t\n\u2014 I think it was in about January \u201939, or something like that. No, and then my father\nwas arrested and until then he could practice because he was a wounded veteran of\nWorld War I. And then he was put in Dachau for a while. And then he was later\nreleased because he was able to get sponsorship by \u2014 by the Bishop of Litchfield in\nEngland. A funny thing, on one of our trips, when my parents were visiting me up\nin Italy, there was a lady staying in the same hotel as my parents were staying, and\nthey became friendly, and she was a secretary to the b \u2014 to the Bishop of Litchfield,\nOctober 16, 2010\nand somehow my mother contacted her and \u2014 which they could do and so there was\na way, people \u2014 some adults could go there, and he spent time til \u2014 he probably went\nthere in January or February \u00b039, and he stayed there til April \u201940.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, about three or four weeks?",
        "A: No, I was \u2014 I was in Holland already.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s no different than going to a boarding school.",
        "A: I mean, I had my experience, having been in four boarding schools; three \u2014 three\nin Italy, and one in Germany, and so I \u2014I pretty well knew what was needed.",
        "A: No. So this was in the system.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: Yeah. We first \u2014 they took it from Mannheim, then they had us stay overnight,\neither in Frankfurt, or in Cologne, I forgot. And they collected people from other\nlocations, and they put them on a common train and took us into Rotterdam.",
        "A: Well, we first of all, I had \u2014 at Rotterdam we stayed for a while in the quarantine\nstation. That happened to \u2014 every port at that time had a quarantine station. And \u2014\ncause they didn\u2019t know whether the sailors came back with tropical illnesses or stuff\nlike that. But there was a facility, was guarded by Dutch military. We could not\nleave, but we could have visitors. For instance, my sisters and theirs \u2014 and their\nfoster parents, that cheese manufacturer, they came and visited me there. But we\nstayed in big barracks. There wasn\u2019t much to do, but then a short time afterwards, I\nwas able to go do what is mispronounced in the States as gouda, what should be\npronounced howda(ph). And there we were in a \u2014 in an old orphanage, and 1n that\norphanage we also had quite a few refugee teachers. And since the academic training\nsome of the kids had, was quite different between them. And if you were, let\u2019s say at\n\u2014 some more advanced training in languages and literature and math or science, and\nyou had the math teacher there, and you knew you were interested in that, he really\nspent a lot of time. But I must give credit for being able to graduate from a U.S. high\nschool on the week of my 16\" birthday, after having been in the country about 14\nmonths.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: And I still had language problems with it, but \u2014",
        "A: I think \u2014 well, among the kids where we were staying, there was primarily\nGerman, and the teachers, these were all German speaking teachers.\n[indecipherable] it\u2019s a mass instruction, only you had literature, you had German\nliterature. Maybe a little \u2014 little English, or I don\u2019t know, we spo \u2014 we learned some\nDutch, we had some Dutch people coming in and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, from about January \u201939 til April \u201940. And I was in \u2014 after about \u2014 I was for\na short time in Amsterdam, which was also a quarantine station, it was a holding\nplace. And they did a few things \u2014 for instance, I learned glass blowing there. But\nvery primitive, I mean, the very beginnings of it. But they kept \u2014 they had some\nvocational instructors. And then I went to Wieringen. Now that is a important place.\nIt is what used to be known as an aliyah ca \u2014 preparation camp. Familiar with it?",
        "A: For \u2014 the term?\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: Aliyah. That is the mo \u2014 Zionist movement to go \u2014 preparing you to go to Israel.\nSo we had academic training, and we had agricultural training, and vocational\ntraining. And this is the first time I was involved with oil and gas, because we f \u2014\nthey found out the thing 1s, for the training, this \u2014 that was in the place of the\nZuiderzee, which had been reclaimed from the sea, that land. But you had swamp\ngas coming up through the water. And we collected the swamp gas and f \u2014 and had\nthe equipment, that it could be used productively for heating and agricultural and\ncooking things. And this is not in the area of \u2014 farther east in Groningen, where they\ndiscovered afterward were two \u2014 some very big gas fields. But this is probably not\nrelated. I never heard of this, what we found there, because it was only bubbling up.\nAnd we had a container that collected it, and so we \u2014 they had \u2014 we built, and then\nwe did agricultural things. For instance, it\u2019s interesting using that kind of a country\nplace to prepare people for Israel, where this was too much water, as compared to\nIsrael having lack of water. But they \u2014 they built that particular facility there, and it\nwas a productive fa-farm. I think they produced or \u2014 everything was consumed that\nwas produced. They raised all kind of big animals.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, my mother was in Germany. She did not go to England because her parents\nwere too old to go to England.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, my mother was born in Berlin, but her parents moved to Mannheim when\nthey retired, when they got old enough, they needed somebody, one of their children\nto \u2014 when the mother \u2014 my mother, taking care of the thing. And then she 1s \u2014 was\nacademically trained, she never got her full degree, but she couldn\u2019t make up her\nmind whether to study law or medicine. She did some of each, but never finished it \u2014\nit, and after \u2014 when the war had started, and after Paris had fallen, and the Vichy\ngovernment was established, they made that province, which was Baden, which 1s\nwhere Mannheim, Heidelberg ar-are located, they made it Judenfrei. Free of Jews,\nand they de-deported all of them to a concentration camp in the Pyrenees called\nconda \u2014 called Gurs, g-u-r-s. You heard about that one?",
        "A: Okay. [indecipherable] Gurs. Actually the \u2014 the S 1s not pronounced in \u2014 in the\nFrench thing, and she stayed there for a while, together with her mother. Her father\ndid not survive the transport. And \u2014 yeah. They lived pretty well in the mud. These \u2014\nthis was built for Spanish loyalists who fled across from Spain to the French border,\nOctober 16, 2010\nwhen they were being defeated. And so it didn\u2019t have too many comfort, it was for\nyoung military people, but there was \u2014 food was somewhat limited. But since my\nmother was fluent in French, she was part of the delegation that went to local\nfarmers and try \u2014 tried to talk them out of more food, and stuff like that. And then\nshe and her mother were transferred to Marseilles, and my mother had a vi-visa to\ngo to the States also. Otherwi \u2014 in the meantime, lotsa thing; I had been \u2014 we had\nbeen in the States. I went from Holland, picked up \u2014 we picked up my f-\u2014 my sisters\nand I, we picked up my father in Southampton, and went to the States. And then we\nlived in New York for a while. But then my mother was in Marseilles, and she was\nable to catch a boat, a French boat that was going to Martinique, which 1s the \u2014 one\nof the French states or provinces. And \u2014 but since France, Vichy, France was at war\nwith England, a British warship captured that ship and brought it into Trinidad. So\nthey were interned as, I guess enemy aliens in Trinidad. But then from there we\nwere in contact with her in the States, we were able to get arrangements to get a boat\nto go from Trinidad to New York. And she just got there in time to see me graduate\nfrom high school.",
        "A: Let\u2019s see. \u201939 to \u2014 about 14 months.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah. That visa had been put in, and there was \u2014 when it came, you\nknow, number came up, and somebody was \u2014 from the committee there, took us to\nthe pier. We left from na \u2014 we didn\u2019t leave from Holland, we left from Belgium.\nThe ship left in Antwerp. And then by that time, Germany and England were\nalready at war. And we went to \u2014 on the way to Southampton we spotted floating\nmines near Southampton, but none of them were set up. I saw them later on when I\nwent from France to England \u2014 from England to France with the U.S. Army. And\nthe other G.I.s tried to shoot and set off the floating mines, but they never hit the\nright spot. You got a pl-place about this big, at a long distance, to \u2014 you know, this is\nto set it off [indecipherable] point. If you just hit the body, the body of the floating\nmine is heavy steel, and the machine guns did not penetrate that.",
        "A: But anyhow \u2014",
        "A: First we were staying with the family of my father\u2019s brother, who had been there\nfor a while. And \u2014 in Manhattan, on 91\" Street.",
        "A: Yeah.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: Little bit.",
        "A: But I learned it after a while, and they \u2014 I \u2014 the teachers were actually excellent.\nThat was a \u2014 not a particular prestigious high school. In fact, about half of them\ncame from Harlem, and one-third c-came from Hell\u2019s Kitchen. So the teachers\nwere very happy to have some kids who had more academic training. In fact, the\ninteresting situation, the kids who made the honor roll, two-thirds of them were\nforeign born. The ones who competed for valedictorian, nearly all of them spoke\nwith an accent. I don\u2019t \u2014 I was competing for it, but I had a big argument with my\nEnglish teacher, who was a reviewer of the thing, and an argument when we read\nJulius Caesar, and I argued with her when \u2014 either, I think, either Cassius or\n[indecipherable] says, I forgot, because he was ambitious, I killed him. And I wrote\nmy speech on the necessity for ambition. And the teacher recognized that argument I\nhad with her, so I was blackballed on that. I had made the honor roll when I\ngraduated, but I did not get the valedictorian speech. But then I did something else.\nSince I had such a mixed up previous education, I went to the different departments,\nand in some case I took a regent examination, and I passed it and then I got credit for\nthe course, that got me through that fast. And some of them I just talked my way, I\nOctober 16, 2010\nthink. I got some credits in art appreciation because I reviewed all the things I had\nseen in the \u2014 in the Italian and the Dutch and the German museums. And I could\ndistinguish different schools of painting and stuff like that, because my parents were\nvery insistent when we went to these museums that I could identify what it was, or\nwho the \u2014 and I convinced them that I knew enough about art appreciation, I could\nget credit for it.",
        "A: And I got all these language credits, and I did all right on math. So \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, then, the only thing is, I had to take fo \u2014 you had to take eight semesters of\nhigh school English, and I \u2014 I doubled up on them. They let me do that. And in fact,\nI don\u2019t know, I even got in one of the honor classes. I don\u2019t know how I ever did\nthat, but \u2014 and I think maybe I ever had done more reading, not only in English, but\nin things in the international literature.",
        "A: 16 and a day, I was very old.",
        "A: I was very unhappy. Graduation \u2014 some gi \u2014 schools graduated on Tuesday, some\nWednesday, some Thursday. My school graduated on Thursday. They only had so\nOctober 16, 2010\nmany caps and gowns to go around. If I would have been on Tuesday school, I\nwould have made it with 15. Wednesday was my birthday.",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 I was a\u2014 that summer I was a junior con \u2014 a swimming counselor in a\ncamp, and then shortly thereafter, my parents moved to Ohio, and I couldn\u2019t get a\ndecent job because of my age. Even as a draftsman, they thought I might prick\nmyself with a pencil. But those days the labor laws were ridiculous for a 16 year old,\nand said, why don\u2019t you go back to high school? I said, I graduated from there. So I\ngot some helper jobs, not very much and I started to do some vocational training, I\nwent to a local high school and I took some evening courses in machine shop. I\nhadn\u2019t done much work in machine shop, but I was interested in those things. And\nthen, shortly before we got into war, we had defense preparatory courses offered by\ndifferent schools. And since I was in Columbus, Ohio, Ohio State provide that\ncourse, and I took some of these courses, which were non-credit courses. But when I\nbec \u2014 later on when I was able to afford to go to college, I talked to the prof who\ntaught me the courses I had on [indecipherable] and I convinced him I didn\u2019t have\nto take the course, he would give me academic credit for it. So that helped me. And I\nhad \u2014 in fact, one of the guys was, 1-in one of the fields, the number one man in the\ncountry, who happened to be the head of the department for engineering drawing at\nOhio State. So, and then I went full time, from the beginning of \u201942 until November\nOctober 16, 2010\nof \u00b043. In the meantime, I got a letter called greetings, your neighbors want you to\nrepresent them in the armed forces. So the day \u2014 the day before Thanksgiving \u00b043\nwas my first day active duty. And on Thanksgiving day was my first day of KP. And\nthat was a big job that time. Then I spent time in the army, I was being \u2014 with\nengineering back on \u2014 they put me into a signal corps, which, I mean, technical\nthings, and then I went to something called ASTP, are you familiar with that term?",
        "A: It was Army Specialized Training Program. What they had there, they didn\u2019t\nknow how long the war would last, and since no new kids were graduating from\ncollege, or very few, they had programs to give academic training and provide\npeople for leadership and more responsibility later on. And they had it in two\ndifferent \u2014 in several fields, one of them was linguistically, and the other one was\nengineering. So I went to the University of Illinois, where they tested me, and I\nqualified both for language and for engineering. But I f\u2014 was looking long term, so I\nsigned up for the engineering type, and they sent me to Rutgers University for about\nsix months, to study engineering. And I got this \u2014 these were academic courses, so I\ngot credit later on at Ohio State for the work I did there. And then, as they figured\nthe war seems to have been coming to the end, this was after D-Day, and they\nlooked like this \u2014 this program was sending kids to college, was terminating, so I\napplied \u2014 I figured engineering and languages, I applied for military government\nOctober 16, 2010\ntransfer. But somehow they didn\u2019t \u2014 somehow they figured they needed me for\nmilitary intelligence. So they sent me to Camp Ritchie, if you ever heard of that.",
        "A: The so called Ritchie boys. This was \u2014 Camp Ritchie is in \u2014 near Hagerstown,\nMaryland, and this was the military intelligence training center. In fact, there\u2019s a\nvery good movie out, was made by a German company, called, \u201cThe Ritchie Boys,\u201d\nand what happened, 1-it was quite \u2014 it was very fair. They took people who had a\ncertain high I.Q. \u2014 I forgot what the army called the thing right now \u2014 and they were\nfluent in a language that was of interest; German or Italian or French. We were not\nthat much concerned with eastern European languages. And they had a similar thing\non the west coast, in br \u2014 in Monterey, for people who were \u2014 were interested in\nAsiatic languages, and getting involved there. So I got to that camp, which they cou\n\u2014on my orders I\u2019d even \u2014 couldn\u2019t even say where I\u2019m going to. And that movie\nthey made about it, I don\u2019t know whether Holocaust Museum has \u2014 hat that, it\u2019s \u2014\nbut it\u2019s \u2014 but it\u2019s a very interesting link. And these people did all kind of jobs,\ninterrogation of prisoners during wa \u2014 during the fighting. And the most famous\nattendee of that school was Henry Kissinger. But he graduated from there before I \u2014\nI went there. And what happened? We \u2014 when we were finished, we knew more\nabout the German military, the civil service, the reliability, things, when people were\n\u2014 were promoted on certain jobs, they had certain jobs, which ones were considered\nOctober 16, 2010\nhighly \u2014 higher the liability for the Nazi regime. Or some of them were just \u2014\nbecause the skill of somebody was, let\u2019s say, the county engineer. Well, that\u2019s\nbecause he si \u2014 knew how to put in sewer systems. But \u2014 and the \u2014 was \u2014 and I d\u2014I\ndidn\u2019t get finished with that til after V-E Day, so was lucky when I went overseas, I\ndidn\u2019t have to do any fighting. But I was involved in a lot of interesting episodes. I\nwas in, for instance, typically in my favorite stories, things that happened. There\nwere \u2014 for instance, when there was a security raid in the occupation, because U.S.\nArmy was invo \u2014 [indecipherable] was concerned that the Germans might pull\nOperation Werwolf. That was the same thing, the name \u2014 tag name they gave to\nwhat the French were doing with the Maquis. Resistance. So they tried to undermine\nit. I know \u2014 so they, sometimes they had raids and thing, looking for weapons, and\nlooking for people that were on the [indecipherable] list. And wa \u2014 they had guys\nlike me, assigned to battalion headquarter, and if they brought in something that was\nsuspicious, I had to give it for a screening. I know one time they brought in a guy\nwith a fancy uniform, brass buttons, and a red cap. And I looked at him and I looked\nhis I.D. and I looked at his brass button, and it said RB, which means Reichsbahn.\nAnd said, take that guy back to the railway station, he is the station master. But the\nnormal G.I. wouldn\u2019t know th-that guy from another guy with a German uniform.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: So this is a \u2014 this was some of the funny things, but I mean, I could \u2014 you could\nsee they had support. I mean, people like myself, and colleagues of mine, who could\nthought things out. Not that they think they gotta arrest a guy because he wears a\nuniform. But he just \u2014 the kind of thing that I think is a funny story.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, let\u2019s see. I got there, let\u2019s see, it was probably about from September or\nOctober \u201945, til \u2014 and the story gets complicated before it gets cleared up \u2014 and I\nstayed there until December \u201947. And then I was also involved in war crimes trials. I\nwas an investigator for one of the guys who got accused, got indicted for the\nNuremberg trials, but he was never tried, because we could not get good evidence\non him. Plus when we blew his safe and found all kind of thi \u2014 interesting things on\nthere, including a letter from the Kaiser, because the guy was very important in\nWorld War I. The biggest gun in World War I was named after his wife.",
        "A: Big Bertha. Did you ever hear about that? That gun?\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: It was the \u2014 then \u2014 the guy was Alfred Krupp, from the Krupp factory,\nmunitions maker and steel factory. And situation, they were in the Nuremberg trials\nand I was at a briefing by Supreme Court Justice Jackson, who was the prosecutor\nfor Nuremberg. And I attended one of these meetings; they said, as you investigate,\nyou gotta look for two things. Cri \u2014 preparing for and conducting aggressive warfare.\nThat we found Krupp, because he was building tanks and stuff like that, and testing\nthem, and things of that nature \u2014 other war material. The other one was crimes\nagainst humanity; slave labor and that kind of stuff. And this ma \u2014 old man, Krupp\n\u2014and I have a lot of his personal history, to \u2014 was in \u2014 retired, I think because of\nhealth reasons, about the same t \u2014 about the time Paris fell. So that\u2019s before slave\nlabor because a problem. And his son took over. So \u2014 and he and his son didn\u2019t get\nalong at all. And so he had \u2014 the \u2014 the old man didn\u2019t have anything to do with the\noperation of the factory, or their personnel, or policies. He was there collecting his\nretirement pay, and that\u2019s about all. In fact, it\u2019s an interesting situation, that this guy\nis, when he was born, was not \u2014 his name was not Krupp, because old man Krupp,\nwho was very big before World War I, who built up the factory a lot, Alfred Krupp,\nand he ha \u2014 only had daughters, he had no sons. But he wanted to perpetuate the\nname and the family. So the Kaiser had an edict by which the boyfriend, who was\nGustav von Bohlen und Halbach, was going to marry the Krupp woman, one of\nthe Krupp daughters, could combine the name, Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach.\nOctober 16, 2010\nSo he maintained his nobility name, but he main \u2014 he kept his \u2014 kept the Krupp\nname in the family. So there was a special edict, I don\u2019t know what year that was\ndone, but it\u2019s an interesting situation.",
        "A: And I used to have si \u2014 copy of his \u2014 I used to have his passport for a while.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, that was the only one for Nuremberg. But then I worked for \u2014 well, again\nby the pe \u2014 if I talk about things you know, I me \u2014 stop me. During the Yalta\nConference, where they decided the war crime trial concept, said there was people\nwho were involved on an international basis, who were supposed to be tried by the\ninternational court, which were then Nuremberg. But things had happened, like\nconcentration camp or slave labor, in the countries whose zone of occupation was \u2014\nwas war crimes against individuals of that nationality, were supposed to be tried by\ncourts of that ka \u2014 courts of that cor \u2014 of that nationality. For instance, again, there\u2019s\nan interesting history which is \u2014 don\u2019t know whether \u2014 how well known that was,\nwhen the \u2014 when the \u2014 when \u2014 during the fighting, U.S. troops got as far as the Elba\nriver. That meant they went past \u2014 through Thuringen where the ca \u2014 main town is\nOctober 16, 2010\nWeimar, and where also Buchenwald was located there, just nearby there. And\nthen, after the \u2014 they rearranged the zones and \u2014 and that area of Weimar became\nRussian zone. So, since we had the evidence, like lampshades made from human bl \u2014\nfrom human skin, and SS guards and oth \u2014 and all kind of stuff, including the wife of\nthe former commandant, Ilse Koch, and \u2014 more about her later. I said I have a long\nhistory of \u2014 [indecipherable] history. And so \u2014 so we moved before our troops\nwithdrew from that area, and the Russians moved in. We took all the stuff and put it\ninto a facility in Dachau. We could intern the prisoners and had enough storage\nfacilities to store the evidence. And there was a mission. Since \u2014 since Buchenwald\nwas supposed to be tried by Russia, and since this is the Russian zone, we \u2014 we had\na team of about two, three attorneys and about four linguists, who went through all\nthat stuff that had been collected, and they \u2014 the lawyers put it into a legal\ndocumentation, to turn over to the Russians, that they could use it as evidence. But\nthe wi \u2014 Russians refused to accept it. They did not want to annoy the Germans. It\u2019s\nin their zone, they wanted to say the communists are not doing things that Germany\nlook bad. So they refused to do this. And so about \u2014 that was before Churchill spoke\nabout the Iron Curtain. That was Russia did not live up to its commitment under\nthe Yalta Conference. So it\u2019s \u2014 for many years later \u2014 about two years later they\nwould \u2014 the Buchenwald people were tried in American war crimes trial, and I\nparticipated in that one. There were some interesting people [indecipherable] were\nOctober 16, 2010\nthere, and later on I got into the war crimes trials in Dachau \u2014 in Dachau. The U.S.\ntrials. And one of the most in \u2014 at times I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to do that. For a\nwhile I was either assistant to the prosecutor, assistant to the defense counselor, and\nwas [indecipherable] court interpreter. Was sometimes assistant to the judge,\nbecause they had terms, which different people translated different ways. And they\nwere \u2014 the judges were confused and they said, we heard this was said to them, to\nthem, what \u2014 how it happened? And then I had to figure out these were the same \u2014\ntranslating 1t back into German, these were the same organization. So, and \u2014 but\nthere was \u2014 there was some interesting people there. Probably the most famous \u2014 one\nof the most famous person who was tried there, but he was acquitted, that was Otto\nSkorzeny. Did you ever heard about that name\u2019? Otto Skorzeny was the commander\nof the German Ranger. In fact, he became famous. After the Italian partisans had ca-\ncaptured Mussolini and kept him on top of a mountain as a prisoner, his ranger unit,\nwith gliders and with mountain troops, stormed that place and rescued Mussolini.\nThe partisan got Mussolini couple months later on and they killed him, but \u2014 but that\nwas the guy. And this guy also became famous during the Battle of the Bulge,\nbecause he was commanding this ranger, German ranger battalion, and he put them\nall in German \u2014 in American uniforms, to go behind our lines \u2014 through our lines and\ndisturb things, maybe destroy signal equipment and put on markers, direction signs,\nturn them around and to ca \u2014 and they were trying to, during the Battle of the Bulge,\nOctober 16, 2010\nthe aim of the Rumsted(ph) offensive was to capture Antwerp. And he was an\nimportant part, but he was being tried \u2014 tried [indecipherable] for that. But there\nwas an interesting thing. The prosecutor was a famous lawyer from Atlanta, who\nhad \u2014 he was usually a defense counselor, and he lost most of the cases, as defense\ncounselor in war crimes trials. But he was a prosecutor, and he lost that one, because\nthere was a guy who was \u2014 I don\u2019t even know whether he was a lawyer or not, or he\nhad some lawyer assistance. And he found out that you cannot get anybody on\nespionage, or sabotage. These are ruses of war. As long as you are not \u2014 as long as\nyou are caught \u2014 not caught in the other country\u2019s uniform. There were some of his\nmen who were caught in American uniforms, and they were shot. But he was caught\nlater on, I forgot whether in German uniform, or in civilian clothes. Therefore that\nstopped it and he was acquitted. And then he became other things, he was \u2014 became\nthe chief of security for Egypt. He was sometimes \u2014 there was a \u2014 were some\narticles written, the most dangerous man in Europe, because he had that wartime\nexperience, and he was helping Egypt. But didn\u2019t do much good. Egyptians didn\u2019t\ndo so well in the Six Day War. But \u2014 so, and then there was also, during the\nBuchenwald trial, there was this wa \u2014 wa \u2014 fo \u2014 the widow of the commandant, and\nshe had been a widow for many years, but she was pregnant. And they tried to find\nout whether it was a Polish guard. There were \u2014 a lot of the guard people were Polish\nDPs. And they were all right. And the Americans pretty well liked them, the only per\nOctober 16, 2010\n\u2014 only one person didn\u2019t like the Polish guards. There was th \u2014 my dog. He always\nbarked at them. And he was a interesting dog.",
        "A: It was a German Shepherd, a relatively small one. But he was very good pedigree,\nbecause the couple \u2014 the dogs that bred him, used to belong to the German Field\nMarshal Mordell, who, when he lost the [indecipherable] in the \u2014 after U.S. troops\nhad moved east of the Rhine river, he committed suicide. Right before that, he gave\nhis matched pair of dogs to a local farmer. And I found out about those dogs. And he\nbred them, and I got one of his offsprings. But then, the kind of situations that people\ndo \u2014 in the thing, for instance, I was stationed in Dachau that time, and we had took\na barrack where we get some veterinarians who were prisoners, and we dro \u2014 got a\ncouple veterinarians and a couple farm boys, and we had a veterinary clinic, because\nsome of us had to go out of town for a couple of weeks, so we left the dogs there.\nBut they were too \u2014 even too dumb to make sure they had all the medicine, so they\ndied of distemper. Dist \u2014 the medicine was not easily available in Germany, but we\ncould have send it, call \u2014 contacted our parents and have it sent from the States. So\nthe dog did not \u2014 did not survive. But this 1s \u2014 but lot of the G.I.s had these thing.\nAnd by the way, if you keep pe \u2014 these people busy, I was working for a while, that\nwas before that, in an internment camp, where they had people who \u2014 who were not\naccused of anything, but they were considered security risks, because they had really\nOctober 16, 2010\nhigh positions in the party, or in civil service, or in the military. That\u2019s primary \u2014 not\nin the general army, but in the S.S. or something like that. And they were housed in\nGerman army barracks, and they lived better than the population because they had\nall the heat, the hot water, they had decent food, which was short at that time, but\nthey were bored. So we arranged with them, a craft shop. Some of them were very\nhandy. And I have \u2014 still have at home, four paintings which \u2014 watercolors, about\nthis size, which the guy did from memory, and they are very nice paintings, and I\nreally treasure them. And they were \u2014 didn\u2019t have much stuff, they were\n[indecipherable] canvas, they were the back of the ration boxes. So they\nimprovised, and I got them home, I got them framed. And they didn\u2019t want to get\npaid in money. They said, if you do \u2014 if it\u2019s \u2014 you know, we \u2014 well, it was good\nrelationship between these craftsmen and the G.L.s. They said no, I would appreciate\nit rather, if you would send a package with some chocolates or some other candy to\nmy wife or to my kids. And we got that at the PX. So it\u2019s, again, the people who had\n\u2014 we were sorting out who was a real security risk, who was \u2014 on the war crimes\nwanted list that was put down \u2014 put out by all the countries, sorting things out, and\nthese were primarily the guys, the Ritchie boys. And they were very young guys. I\nthink our detachment commander, he was old, he was 21 years old. He was a second\nlieutenant. But this \u2014 oh, sorry.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay, nothing.",
        "A: No disconnects?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: All right, \u2019'm sti \u2014 we\u2019re still wired. So \u2014 interesting thing is while I was in \u2014\ninvestigating in that [indecipherable] team, I met a young lady who was the \u2014 a\ntelephone operator for the British organization, it was British zone of occupation.\nAnd she had been a telephone operator for the German post office, the post office\nwas running the telephone system in Germany at that time. And then she was\ndelegated to be the private telephone operator for the state adjutant general. I mean,\nshe was very good in it, to get that particular thing. And then when the British took\nover, she went \u2014 became telephone operator for one of the British headquarters.\nThere was a [indecipherable] commission, they \u2014 since this is the area where the \u2014\nwhich produced the most coal, and they rationed the coal allocations through all the\noccupation areas. And we got quite involved, to the extent that she was my wife,\nthrough the war part.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: Her name?",
        "A: Hanni, h-a-double n-i.",
        "A: Sessilman(ph). So, I mean, she was basically \u2014 she was Aryan and she was\ninvolved in the BDM and competing in the contests they have for different things.\nAnd no, we had a very good marriage of 62 years, and she died day after Christmas\nlast year.",
        "A: So when we got married in Dachau, by the mayor of Dachau. In fact, we were, I\nthink the second couple involving a G.I. and a war bride, that was married by that\nguy. But he gave an endlessly long speech, and we were then supposed to have a\nreception at the officers\u2019 club. And we were getting late and late, so when we finally\ngot through, we told the driver to step on it, and we got a speeding ticket from the\nMPs. But then we had a reception at the \u2014 or a din \u2014 a nice dinner at the\n[indecipherable] club. And \u2014 and a band and everything else.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: F-For \u2014 \u201947. In fact, this is one reason when the \u2014 I stayed longer in Europe than\nI had to, because when I was supposed to come back for discharge, come back to the\nStates, I could not bring my \u2014 I could not get married, I was \u2014 as a G.I. you had to\nget permission by the military to marry, and I could not get that permission, and\nwithout that she couldn\u2019t come to the States. So, since there was a shortage of\npeople, they offered all kind of incentives for people to stay there if they had certain\nskills. And I stayed there as a civilian, where I made quite a bit more money, but I\nwas a -\u2014 they had a uniform for the civilians. So \u2014 and it was important that you wore\nsome service ribbons, that meant you were not a carpetbagger. Some guys, they just\nwent there and never in the service, but the fact that you were in the service, you\nwere accepted by them. And we could go to the R and R centers in the \u2014 near the\nAlps and used to have some good times over the weekends. And was on a lake, and\nearly morning there had to be a festival. And then you went on a sailboat. They\nrigged it for you, you didn\u2019t have to rig it yourself, and then we sailed until\nlunchtime. And then there was a \u2014 then there\u2019d be a party in the afternoon. So \u2014 and\nwith an oompah-pah bands and all this kind of stuff. No, this 1s the \u2014 G.Ls at that\nparticular time, if they could get to those places, the army took good care of them.\nExcept one thing is, there was one of the experiences my wife had. We went to a\nplace where we knew there was an R and R center, we went there, but we did not\nknow that was for blacks. But we asked them whether we could have lunch there.\nOctober 16, 2010\nSaid yes. But then we sat on a table, and there was some blacks sitting on the table,\nthey said, hey you, you can\u2019t sit there with them. That\u2019s \u2014 that was the U.S. military\nin \u00b046 - \u00b047, before Truman integrated the military in \u2014 forgot again the year that\nwas. Yeah, I think it was one of the first things he did. I think he did that after \u2014 after\nV-J Day. Well, okay, then we got married there, and we could go over \u2014 we went\nback to the States.",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: I went back to Columbus, Ohio, where my parents were living. And I went back\nto Ohio State and got my degree. In fact, three weeks ago, I was elect \u2014 I was titled\ndistinguished alumnus from Ohio State, for engineering department.",
        "A: Thank you. I got \u2014 had quite a bit of involvement with the \u2014 I was member of a\nindustry review board to advise profs what kind of things are strong, that industry\nneeds and they sho \u2014 should emph \u2014 things they should emphasize. For instance, one\nof my biggest complaint, I think that\u2019s not only with engineers, but with other\npeople, too \u2014 you went to college, did you?",
        "A: Which one did you go to?\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: I see, okay. North Dakota. I\u2019ve not spent any \u2014 I spent quite a bit of time in\nWyoming, and I used to go to South Dakota to go skiing at the \u2014 was it Black\nHills, or \u2014 yeah, I used to go skiing in the Black Hills. Whenever I had \u2014 I was in \u2014\nin Gillette, Wyoming. I was working in a coal mine there. And let\u2019s see \u2014 no, this is\n\u2014 no, this was quite interesting, to get the \u2014 to work with the profs and do things, and\nthis 1s \u2014 yeah, I mean, the things I said, which is something wa \u2014 most universities\nmake a big mistake. When you went to college, whatever you studied, when you\nwrote a term paper, or had to give a report, who was your target audience?",
        "A: Yeah. Somebody who knew much more about it than you did. In real life, most of\nthe people deal with people that know less about it. For instance, when I learned\nabout computer, they told me to toggle over, and I looked for a toggle switch. I\nmean, the kind of terminology. Doctors are great for using terms which nobody\nunderstands unless you\u2019re a doctor yourself. Engineers do that too, accountants at\ntimes, and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. Th-That\u2019s where you were trained. And I was trying to get the school to\nmandate that the ki \u2014 that the students take a course in public speaking. True non-\nspecialists in \u2014 let\u2019s see, what is that organization that gives speeches?\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Yeah, Toastmaster.",
        "A: Yeah. The kind of a thing that they do there by which you are asked to give, for\ninstance, this is something I either learned in the military, then when I get back, after\nI started working there, I also went back in the reserve. And I progressed quite a bit\nthere, and I commanded a unit, and I had some fun with something. It was\n[indecipherable] we had inspection from a guy from Washington coming, I don\u2019t\nknow, from headquarters. And I kn-knew about it, when that was, and I scheduled\ncommanders time. And one of my favorite things to schedule there 1s \u2014 1t was during\nthe Eisenhower administration, [indecipherable] for peace. And I was involved in\nbuilding the first commercial nuclear plant in this country. And so I| talked about\nhow they operate and I had the drawings all over the wall, and \u2014 til I found out the\ninspector hadn\u2019t heard about that, but I could put it in a way that this guy who was\nmaybe an accountant or something like that, or an auditor could fo \u2014 could follow it.",
        "A: And so in fact, I had some fun. I had my senior non-com was a high school\nteacher, and I made a deal with him: whenever I gave a lecture \u2014 and I had to do that\nOctober 16, 2010\nonce a week, we met once a week and \u2014 for two hours \u2014 one hour I had to do the\nwork; he critiqued it. He took notes, what I did well, what I didn\u2019t do well: talking\ntoo fast, not getting things organized, talking to the blackboard, all that kind of\nmistake. Using terms that were not defined. So after the meetings, we went to the\nnearby legion post and we both had beer, and he gave me a critique. And I am very\nthankful for what he has done for me. And I have addressed, I think last year at Ohio\nState, I addressed a group of about 400 people.",
        "A: Yeah, so it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2014I feel comfortable with doing that.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Yeah, right, yeah. Doing that and then back in the engineering part, I had to\ntestify, or talk to governmental agencies. Like one time in Canada and one time in\nMalaysia. Kuala Lumpur.",
        "A: We were doing something that was non-standard, and I had to defend it. So there\nwere a lot of people, some of them were technically trained, some were not. Why\nwe\u2019re doing it, what we\u2019re doing, what the risk was, and what the training was for to\nbe done properly, and what the results are from the testing that had been done\n43October 16, 2010\nbefore. But I felt quite comfortable even talking to a foreign country like in Kuala\nLumpur.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of File One\nOctober 16, 2010\nBeginning File Two",
        "A: No, no, we decided we didn\u2019t want any. But I have nephews and nieces with\nwhom I\u2019m quite close, and \u2014",
        "A: No, when I graduated, I went to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and then I went to\nMarietta, Ohio. In fact, there I worked for a company, and they had a Marietta\nCollege, and they had some night courses in business related things, but to be an\naccredited thing where you could get a degree, they had to take some science\ncourses. But the science faculty at Marietta College were so lazy, and they didn\u2019t\nhave a graduate school, so they didn\u2019t have the graduate students who could \u2014 would\nteach those. So the \u2014 the dean of the gradu \u2014 of the night school got people out of\nindustry. I was teaching physics, and engineering drawing, and they had some other\npeople were teaching accounting and chemistry and stuff like that. So the wa \u2014 it was\nquite, quite interesting. In fact, 1t was like teaching liberal arts because maybe I\ntalked about a different piece of equipment in a power plant, and some guy says, oh,\nI know all about it. This is depreciated over five years, because the guy was in\nOctober 16, 2010\naccounting. But he had no idea what in the world it was doing, why it was there. So I\ntried to clear that up. No, it\u2019s all right. So \u2014",
        "A: Well, yeah, that\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019ve stayed \u2014 stayed in the military, and I got \u2014 had a \u2014 had \u2014\nalso had a \u2014 what was known as a mobilization designation. That meant \u2014 familiar\nwith that term?",
        "A: That means you are training for a job that\u2019s held by somebody else, in case a\nballoon goes up, one of you guys \u2014 maybe we\u2019|l split the headquarter, and we need\ntwo people with that training, and I used \u2014 I did that, and I was in the intelligence\nbranch. And one of the things that I was really trying to push, and we were\nsuccessful \u2014 that was during the Cold War era, that we had linguistic training. People\ntraining in linguistic and it was all packed military items. We had several reserve\nunits. We were lucky; the Cold War never got hot. We di \u2014 they didn\u2019t have to be\ncalled up. Maybe some people got called up during the Berlin crisis, but well, there\nwas not \u2014 then we were prepared, as compared \u2014 and I may be talking politics now,\nduring the Gulf Wars, we had not \u2014 the government had not prepared linguists who\ncould speak Arabic. I\u2019m sure there are plenty guys around there who are maybe\npeople who immigrated from Jordan, or immigrated from Israel or Palestine, or\nsome of these \u2014 Egypt, or some of the other countries, who could handle these\nOctober 16, 2010\nlanguages. And so it \u2014 it was \u2014 no, then, that\u2019s interesting. When I \u2014 I was working\nfor Exxon for \u2014 as an engineering specialist for about 30 years, and I worked in 22\ncountries, often teaching courses there. And you learn some of the tricks of the trade\nof how teaching in a foreign country. For instance, I was giving a course in Japan,\nand I found a commercial book, or an advert \u2014 actually a catalog by a company that\nhad published the same thing in English and in Japanese. I had the English one, so I\ngot the Japanese one, and got one of those for each of my students from the supplier,\nand if I wanted a certain graph, maybe I had a slide, but then for the Japanese to read\nthings about it, I would have in there saying E page 42, J page 52, so they could\nlook up the reference material. Plus, the idea of simple sentences. Many p \u2014 and\nspeaking very slowly. If I would have a foreign speaking audience \u2014 foreign\nlanguage speaking audience, I would speak about this pace. And no k \u2014 no\ncomplicated sentences, which the French can do the conditionnel. I don\u2019t know\nwhether we use that in English, the conditional case.",
        "A: I mean, when you insert, the green house, which is located on the next street. You\nknow, by inserting that thing.",
        "A: Is for sale. I mean, if that\u2019s \u2014 that is loca \u2014 the next street. Make that a separate\nsentence. This is putting two thoughts together. So I had a lot of fun with that, and I\nOctober 16, 2010\nstayed in some countries where \u2014 which generally are not known as being Jewish\nfriendly, like Gaddafi\u2019s Libya. I worked there for a while. I was about four times in\nSaudi Arabia, and I worked there, and recently, since I retired, I\u2019m working for \u2014\npart time for a company, and I was in United Emirates.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, I said I worked in 22 countries, and I think I visited 52.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t \u2014 I always liked to go in the Far East. I used to \u2014 I used to enjoy\nThailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan. And I \u2014 I really enjoyed Pakistan. And\nPakistan was one of the most surprises. For instance, I was working there on a\nfertilizer plant, we were rebuilding things, and they \u2014 I had some young engineers.\nAnd about half the young engineers were indigenous females, and they were treated\njust as well, were given assignments equivalent to what the \u2014 the male engineers of\nthe same experience level were getting. So when you, in some, I guess, in the\nprimitive farm areas, this may be different, but in the industrial area, there 1s \u2014 you\nfind out the f \u2014 the female is treated better. And we were sitting all together, having\nlunch and stuff like that.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: The only thing is, the guest house I was staying was next to a mosque, and they\nwoke me up every morning when they called for prayer. So, I had a lot of fun with\nthose things. I mean, this is the experiences. I said, I lived history, the same way.\nFirst time I was in Israel \u2014 in fact, to get there I was \u2014 had been in Pakistan, and I\ncou \u2014 they couldn\u2019t f \u2014 you couldn\u2019t fly from Pakistan to Israel, so I flew from\nPakistan to Teheran, Iran, from \u2014 at that time there was \u2014 the shah was still in\ncommand. I \u2014 they could fly from Teheran to Jerusalem. And I decided to do some\nsightseeing. But I figured, these old things, they have been around that long, fine.\nBut it was my military background, I got myself a guide who was fighting in the\nGolan Heights, and we we went up the Golan Heights the same way his unit went\nup. I\u2019m glad they cleared up all the mines. But it was very interesting. That\u2019s another\ninteresting experience dealing with that part of the world. We \u2014 this guy had \u2014 he\nwas Israeli, he had some Arabic friends at one place, and we went there and I got\nsome tea and some dates. Not dates with women, dates the food. And then there\nwere \u2014 near there there was a warehouse, and there were some trucks parked. And\nthese trucks had Israeli license plate, and he said \u2014 they had wing-nuts on them. He\nsaid, you loosen one of those wing-nuts. And they had Jordanese license plates.\nWhat happened? They were taking the famous Jaffa oranges \u2014 although it was not in\nJaffa, it was farther west, but the same type, and transporting them to the Jordanese\n\u2014 to the border between Israel and Jordan, then change the license plate, and then\nOctober 16, 2010\nmoved to \u2014 all the way to Saudi, because Saudi had the money and they \u2014 they\nwanted the \u2014 the better food. So this is a kind of cooperation that the Israeli were\naware what was going on and these Arabic farmers who were growing the oranges\nup there in [indecipherable] were making some money, and I guess the truck drivers\ngot paid. So it was \u2014 no, I\u2019ve been several times visiting Israel, but that was an\ninteresting experience. Also, from the military point of view, there is a place just east\nof \u2014 east of Tel Aviv on a mountain called Kenkillya(ph). From there you could fire\nsome of the bigger guns into Tel Aviv. And I think the Israelis made a big mistake of\nma \u2014 considering part of the West Bank, they should have annexed that, as a\nsecurity, to control the high ground. After they found out at the Golan Heights how\nimportant the high ground is. So I\u2019m sure they had enough people who were\nstudying this thing. And then with the military, I st \u2014 stayed with a co \u2014\n[indecipherable] command general staff college, and stuff like that, which is the\nsecond highest educational thing within the army. The only higher one is Army War\nCollege. I applied for that, but I didn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t get in that one. So I\u2014 I had an\ninteresting time there in involvements and stuff like that, and retired as a full\n[indecipherable] colonel. And in fact, night before last, I stayed in abot \u2014 on\nAberdeen Proving Ground, and I had a VIP suite for myself. I had one and a half\nbedrooms and one and a half baths.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: And a living room. So that was \u2014 that was a convenient way. I figured I didn\u2019t\nwant to drive all the way from New Jersey to Washington and try to fight the\ntraffic, and to get to the hotel in the evening, so I stopped over in Aberdeen and\nworked my way through Baltimore, which is a mess.",
        "A: Well, the fact I didn\u2019t know the roads, I said, this is detour, and I followed that\nthing. And then I \u2014 the detour sign disappeared, and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm. I used to spend a lot of time at Fort Meade.",
        "A: And we used to go to Baltimore, because we had a bunch of young guys, they\nnever had been at strip clubs on the East Baltimore Street, they had a lot of them. I\nguess that\u2019s pretty well known, that East Baltimore Street. And I \u2014 if I wanted to get\nall my tu \u2014 all my guys together, the best place to find them was at East Baltimore\nStreet.",
        "A: Right. That\u2019s \u2014 and these were boys from West Virginia, my \u2014 my army unit at\nthat time was based in West Virginia. So it\u2019s \u2014 since I was living just across the\nOctober 16, 2010\nriver from there. But that facility was there, and that unit was there and they had an\nopening. So that\u2019s about it, and \u2014 well then, after \u2014 went walking when I was\nworking. I went to mari \u2014 there\u2019s Marietta, Ohio, which \u2014 have you heard of\nMarietta, Ohio?",
        "A: There\u2019s Marietta, Georgia.",
        "A: There\u2019s also Marietta, Ohio, which is a very \u2014 historically a very famous town,\nbecause after the Revolutionary War, they handed out the G.I. Bill of the\nRevolutionary War, was 106 \u2014 160 acres, you know, in o \u2014 in Ohio\n[indecipherable] Illinois. And they were handed out in Marietta. People came by\nboat from Pittsburgh on the Ohio River, and went to Marietta. And that\u2019s where\nthere was General Putnam, who was from Massachusetts, but he was the dispenser\nof the G.I. Bill of the Revolutionary War. And the house where he did that in was\nstill in existence. In fact, it was that \u2014 in the top of that town has a little mountain,\nand there\u2019s a\u2014 was an Indian mound. So we lived on the road that le \u2014 went from the\nriver to the Indian mound. That was called Sacra Via. So \u2014 so it\u2019s interesting \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 things I \u2014I lived through and saw.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I got \u2014 I had a good time. I was elected fellow of an engineering society.",
        "A: And I published several technical papers, and so that\u2019s about it, unless you have\nsome other questions.",
        "A: Yeah, in fact, you\u2019 ll find in that article that\u2019s \u2014 you did not have before.",
        "A: Take a look at those two I got.",
        "A: A G.I. remembers?",
        "A: Yeah, I think that goes ba \u2014 that goes quite a bit at the end.",
        "A: I think I may have sent that. After the last Kindertransport Conference, they\nasked to send things to them. And I think I may have sent that already.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, ag-again, this is something you don\u2019t put in a recording.",
        "A: Yeah.\n"
