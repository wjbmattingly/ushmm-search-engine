And from the second grade on I was in a one room\nschoolhouse til later. Now, other things I remember when I was in that school. One\nday the door was kicked open, German storm trooper at the door, class dismissed.\nDidn\u2019t say anything, everybody go home. And I went home along the street. Half an\nhour after I was home we saw the troops going through the street for the anschluss\nin Austria. We were right near the border there. German troops just coming\nthrough the city, just truckload after truckload. And I guess they were going in the\nrailroad station too, the trains were heading all for Austria. And by the next day we\nsaw them coming back already, cause they had taken all of Austria so raptly. Then\nI remember another time, I was downtown in the \u2014 in Straubing and I saw a bunch\nof tanks coming, loads of \u2014 one tank after another, must have been hundreds of\nthem, and they were heading for the Sudetenland, for the anschluss there.",

        "A: Well, not so much they ev \u2014 when they were down there they looked rather\nscared, like going into battle, not knowing what\u2019s going to happen. The next day\nwhen they were coming back, or next few days, they were rather jubilant.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 do you \u2014 did you notice, or did your parents talk about neighbors or your\nfather\u2019s business being affected in \u2014 in all of \u2014 you know, in all of what was\nhappening at that time?",
        "A: Well, he was \u2014 with the Nuremburg laws, I guess it was, Jews weren\u2019t allowed\nto have businesses any more, so he just had to stop. That was it, he had to just get\nrid of all the cattle and horses he had.",
        "Q: So how did you live?\nSeptember 16, 2010",

        "Q: \u2014 to the outside?",
        "A: No, they \u2014 they just more or less indoctrinated me to be careful when I go in the\nstreet and not to mingle too much with \u2014 with the other kids.",
        "Q: Were there other incidents from other kids, aside from that one \u2014 one boy \u2014",

        "A: My parents had some German friends, but as times went on they \u2014 they didn\u2019t\nhave that much to do with them. More or less stayed with the Jewish people who\nwere in town.",
        "Q: What else can you tell us about what happened afterwards? After you were in the\nschool, how long did that school exist? Was that at some point also closed down or\nnot?",
        "A: Well, Crystal Night, that was the end of it. Crystal Night they broke into the\nsynagogue, and where \u2014 there was one room in there, schoolroom, which they used\nbefore for Hebrew school, was that got to be our classroom, and of course with the\n\u2014 everybody having been arrested and being sent to Dachau, there was no more\nschool, and that was it, they \u2014",
        "Q: Is that what happened afterwards is that not only was the building broken into,\nbut those who were involved were sent to Dachau?",
        "A: Yeah, all th \u2014 all the men and the ne \u2014 well, on Crystal Night they broke into the\nsynagogue, they tried to break into our house, but the door was so strong they\ncouldn\u2019t break in, and one of the neighbors across the street hollered out of his\nwindow, let those people alone, they haven\u2019t done anything to you, or something of\nthat nature, and they went away. And in the morning, they \u2014 the police came to\nSeptember 16, 2010\narrest my father, to put him under protective custody, and three days later he was in\nDachau.",

        "Q: That must have been terrifying for a child.",
        "A: It was terrifying. And my mother had nerve enough to go every day up to the\npolice station as long as he was there. They allowed her to visit \u2014 well, n-not to\nactually visit him, to bring him things like warm clothing and stuff like that, and\nthey passed that on to him.",
        "Q: And how long was he in Dachau?",
        "A: Three weeks. And that \u2014 he would have gotten out after four weeks anyhow,\nbecause all veterans from World War I were released from Dachau at that time. But\nmy mother had heard that somebody went to the Gestapo and asked for their\nhusband to be released, next day he came in. So Mother said, well, what can I lose?\nSo she took the train to Regensburg, asked for his release and couple of days later,\nhere he was at home.",
        "Q: Did he look changed?",
        "A: Well, he looked gaunt and they took the clothing and everything away from\nthem, put them in these uniforms like you s-see from the prisoners in Auschwitz\nSeptember 16, 2010\nand everywhere. And it was cold of winter and they had on something about the\nwarmth of a pajama.",

        "A: Well he di \u2014 said some of the things like when they \u2014 they taunted them when\nthey got off the buses there. They had hoses and stuff and they swung at them and\nthey made them run here and there and everything.",
        "Q: Your language at home I take it, was only German. Is that so?",

And we went to Stuttgart to the consulate and of course\nsomebody, on purpose I guess, instead of putting the date 1939 on one of the\npapers, \u201938, so that slowed everything down, my father had to go back and forth. So\nthey used to come by every other day just about to pick up your passport and take it\naway from you. So there would be no chance of them getting our passport, we\ndidn\u2019t come home from Stuttgart. We went from there to Augsburg, stayed with\nrelatives over the weekend, and first thing on Monday morning, my dad took the\ntrain to Straubing, went to get the date changed on that paper, went from there to\nStuttgart, got \u2014 saw the American consulate, got everything straight, picked us up\nlate at night in Augsburg, we took th \u2014 in the night, the train back to Straubing.\nAnd the next train that left for Holland, we were on it to get out of the country.",

        "Q: Of course not.",
        "A: You had to have paperwork, and the \u2014 the United States had a quota, how many\npeople from each country that they would accept. So it was like getting a number in\nthe delicatessen counter, you had to have a number, in the order of your number,\nyou were called to Stuttgart. And we knew that it was January sixth that we were\nto appear there.",
        "Q: And that wasn\u2019t yet certain that you would be able to go when you appeared\nthere, or was it? It was a more f\u2014 more or less a formality.",

From\nSwitzerland he went on to then Palestine, there was no Israel yet. And he\npracticed medicine in \u2014 in Israel. And he \u2014 he p \u2014 he lived through the war. In fact,\nafter his wife passed away, he went back to Germany, and he was an official in the\nGerman government in the medical section, with an office in Munich.",
        "Q: Oh my, how unusual. There was \u2014 I know of many people who \u2014 many \u2014 I knew\na few people who did go back, who \u2014",
        "A: Well, but this was quite a bit after the war. He didn't got back immediately, he\nwent back a long time after, in the 50s.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And his sisters, three of them who were still living, and they succumbed in the\nHolocaust.",
        "Q: I see, so they were still there.",
        "A: Mm-hm.\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "Q: They were still in Straubing.",
        "A: Straubi\u2014 well, one was in Regensburg and one was in Landshut and one was\nin Straubing.",
        "Q: Did you, bit by bit, learn of the fates of each single one?",
        "A: Well, th-they looked after the war, and it took time til we got them. Now, in the\narticles that I gave to \u2014",
        "Q: Suzy [indecipherable]",
        "A: \u2014 Suzy, there\u2019s a lot of paperwork in there from letters that were written, and\nwhere \u2014 where the people ended up. And we got notices through the Red Cross\nfrom the family in Holland where they were, and what happened to them.",
        "Q: So your uncle who was in Holland stayed there, he didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: No, he \u2014 he passed away before the war, he was sickly and after we left, he went\ndownhill real fast, and in fact we were in the United States only about two months\nwhen my mother got word that he passed away.",
        "Q: I see. And your si \u2014 her sister who was taking care of him \u2014",
        "A: She ended up in Auschwitz, she and her son.",
        "Q: Okay. So when you were leaving your grandmother and when you were leaving\nyour extended family, there had been nobody else in the family aside from this one\nSeptember 16, 2010\nuncle who had had plans or \u2014 or talk of also trying to get out, or they just didn\u2019t\nhave the way of doing it, or \u2014",
        "A: Well, the lot of them didn\u2019t, they had to have, first of all an affidavit, someone to\nsponsor them to come to United States. And a lot of people even if they didn\u2019t have\nthat yet, they got themselves a number, and a lot of them did have the affidavits, but\nthe war broke out \u2014",
        "Q: So they were caught.",
        "A: \u2014 before \u2014 they were caught in there before they had a chance \u2014 before the\nnumber came up.",
        "Q: So you left Germany when you were hold old then, nine years \u2014",
        "A: Eight.",
        "Q: Eight, eight. And what are the memories that you have when you cr \u2014 crossed\ninto Holland? Did you feel in \u2014 like you were \u2014 was it like from one world to\nanother world?",
        "A: Well, it was very unusual. As we were go \u2014 the train was going toward the\nborder, German SS men came through, they were inspecting people and hoping that\nthey wouldn\u2019t call you out. And we saw them passing by our compartment and they\nseemed to bypass us. All of sudden we heard the con \u2014 the conductors going\nthrough speaking Dutch. They\u2019d been at the border, the Germans were gone, the\nSeptember 16, 2010\nDutch were in, and we opened the window and we spit out the Swiss \u2014 the end of\nGermany.",
        "Q: Fitting. And tell me now about the Torah story that you were talking about.\nWhat was that, how does it \u2014 what was the beginning of it, how did it develop \u2014",
        "A: Okay. On Crystal Night they broke into the synagogue.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was a bunch of thugs. They came and ransacked the place. They couldn\u2019t burn\nit because it was in a residential area and they couldn\u2019t get permission from the fire\ndepartment to burn the synagogue down. So they ransacked everything and I did see\nthe results of it, and I\u2019ve never seen such a mess of total destruction, like a bomb\nhad hit the place. And when wi \u2014 they \u2014 they came in, just about destroyed\neverything. When my father came back from Dachau, he had \u2014 we had \u2014 we were\nready to leave Germany, we were ready to pack everything. And on the list of\nitems we were permitted to take out was the Torah. So he went to the Gestapo and\nhe showed them papers where he was, could he get his Torah back? The Torah \u2014",
        "Q: This was the synagogue\u2019s Torah?",
        "A: That was his Torah, it was af \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, it\u2019s his Torah.\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 1-1t was \u2014 1t was in \u2014 our family\u2019s Torah. That was written by my great-\ngrandfather, which is another story. And anyway \u2014",
        "Q: We'll hear that then, maybe.",
        "A: Anyway, he went there to get the Torahs, he was \u2014 there was jus \u2014 he was told.\nAnd when he got there, there was a room that had Torahs and prayer books, all kind\nof religious material just laying in a big heap. Well, he picked up his Torah and he\nsaw all these others there, being desecrated through \u2014 the Torah\u2019s supposed to be \u2014\nalways be standing up. So he took all the Torahs and stood them up. And he saw a\nbox there, so he took one Torah, he put it into this box, and he took the silverware\nthat was there, the breastplate, the \u2014 the silver hand and the crown and he put all\nthat into the box, and he closed the box up. Well, I am not sure, but the \u2014 when they\nfound this Torah after the war, there in the box with all that, it had to be the Torah\nmy father had put in there, cause what probably happened, I surmise that they came\n\u2014 the Gestapo came by to pick up all these items, and there\u2019s this box there, they\ndidn\u2019t look in it, and it was left. And somebody probably would say, oh my God,\nthere\u2019s Torahs here. If they catch me with this, they\u2019re going to cut my head off,\nsend me a concentration camp or do something. So they headed for the war, and\nafter the war was over, they discreetly brought it back and just left it there. And I\nhave a hunch that\u2019s what happened, but from what they said the Torah \u2014 th-the box\nSeptember 16, 2010\nlooked like \u2014 of what my father had \u2014 the story he\u2019d always told, I put the two \u2014 t-t-\ntwo together and it had to be that.",
        "Q: And when was it discovered? Was it like returned right after the war, or se \u2014",
        "A: After \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 or several years later or decades late \u2014",
        "A: Shortly after the war.",
        "Q: So cer \u2014 shortly after the war \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 it just appeared in the \u2014",
        "A: It appeared in the \u2014 in \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 where the synagogue was.",
        "A: \u2014 no, 1n the si \u2014 in the police station.",
        "Q: Oh, in the police station. It appeared there.",
        "A: That\u2019s where it disappeared from. That\u2019s where my father, when he went to pick\nup his Torah \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s where he found it, okay.",
        "A: And he put it into the box.",
        "Q: Okay.\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "A: And so I \u2014 I just put two and two together, but the fact that my dad mentioned it\nso often \u2014",
        "Q: Talked about it so much.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And yes, I mean, it \u2014 1t \u2014 it makes sense that \u2014 that \u2014 that\u2019s an educated\nhypothesis, that \u2014",
        "A: But in the film you don\u2019t get that, because they didn\u2019t ask me about it, I had no\nidea that\u2019s how the film was going to end up, cause they just asked me about our\nTorah, the story of it, and \u2014",
        "Q: And when you\u2019re talking now, you\u2019re talking about a film that was made by\nGerman television people.",
        "A: That was for German tel \u2014 this Wolfgang Bergman was the producer, and \u2014",
        "Q: And the point of his film was the story of this \u2014",
        "A: Of the missing Torah \u2014 well, the story \u2014 what had happened to this Torah,\nwhere\u2019d they find it from. [phone ringing]",
        "Q: Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s poi \u2014 [break] You can turn us back on. So, can you tell me a little\nbit about the point of the film? It was to find out what happened, this mystery of the\nhidden Torah.\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "A: Whe-Where did it come from. They had interviewed a lot of German people\nabout Crystal Night there, and it \u2014 they \u2014 they had \u2014 th-this film was made a-\nactually after the war, in 1989, so much later.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And you\u2019ve got the \u2014 the film there, so you can go through it and see it, it\u2019s all in\nGerman. And anyway, you want to know the story about the Torah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Well, my great-grandfather, Moses Firnbacher, was in the United States, and\nhe hit gold in the goldrush in ninet \u2014 1849.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And he took his belongings, his riches from the goldrush, brought it back to\nGermany, to Gossmannsdorf where the family lived, and like any other young\nman, he got married there, started a business, and he had children of his own, and\nthe oldest was my grandfather, Joseph Firnbacher. And for his Bar Mitzvah he\nwanted to have a Torah written. Since he\u2019d gotten all this gold, he had wealth. So he\nhad a Torah written, and they brought the Torah scribe, a sofer into the house, and\nhe lived with them for a whole year, and every week he wrote that week\u2019s portion\nfor the Torah, til it was finished, for my grandfather\u2019s Bar Mitzvah. And this, when\nSeptember 16, 2010\nthey moved to Straubing, my grandfather went there, I guess, for greener pastures\nor exactly what I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t around yet then.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And they went to Straubing, the Torah came with them and then my father was\nBar Mitzvahed from it and it belonged to the family and when we left Germany,\nwe \u2014 we brought it with us.",
        "Q: Wow. So it\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Then I was Bar Mitvahed out of it and our son was.",
        "Q: Wow. And where 1s it now?",
        "A: It\u2019s at Ohr Kodish in \u2014 in Chevy Chase.",
        "Q: In your synagogue there?",
        "A: Mm-hm",
        "Q: That\u2019s not just any old Torah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: That is \u2014 that 1s quite a special one. And did your father have difficulties in \u2014\nwhen he had to go through bureaucra \u2014 bureaucracy, pay for it, go through the\nGerman police and so on, but wer \u2014 did they know what they were giving up, or\nthey didn\u2019t care?",
        "A: Oh, they didn\u2019t care. [phone ringing]\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "Q: Okay, they can call again, okay? So let\u2019s go. So yes, I was asking about any\ncomplications in getting the Torah out of your fa \u2014 of your father dealing with the \u2014\nthe Nazi officials.",
        "A: No, he just \u2014 he just went there, he showed the paper, this is it, 1t\u2019s got the\napproval, bingo.",
        "Q: And they could \u2014 and they \u2014",
        "A: They made a phone call, the police station released the Torah to him.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: And then, the thing is this. Here he 1s, it\u2019s a snowy, wintry day, my father is\ncarrying a Torah through the streets of Nazi Germany to ki \u2014 bring it to our house,\nwhi \u2014 it was a brave thing. But I have a hunch that half the \u2014 not more than half, 90\npercent of the people wouldn\u2019t have even known what he was carrying.",
        "Q: Did your parents, since you \u2014 you were a child at the time, and it\u2019s real \u2014 a lot of\nthe questions that I\u2019d have would be the kind that a child wouldn\u2019t know the\nanswers to, but did your parents talk about neighbors who\u2019d changed their attitudes,\nor changed their behavior towards your family? Or were the Gentiles around pretty\nmuch the same they had always been?",
        "A: Some of them were the same. Some of them th-they\u2019re real Nazis.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "A: And more or less, watch out.",
        "Q: And yo \u2014 and your parents would let you \u2014 would let you know that this one you\nhave to be careful with \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 this one you have to be careful with.",
        "A: But they let me go freely, even a-as a seven and eight year old. I would wander\naround the city cause I \u2014 well, na \u2014 the section where we lived. I didn\u2019t go all over\ntown, but in section where we lived, I walked around freely.",
        "Q: Was it a pretty residential area where you lived?",
        "A: I won\u2019t say it was pretty, it was just typical houses there. In fact, our house, we \u2014\nwe weren\u2019t that far from the railroad lines. And when the allies bombed over there,\nour house was hit. And it \u2014 they took the same bricks that were get \u2014 from the\nhouse. It was three stories high, and they had enough bricks to rebuild it two stories.\nAnd when Betsy saw it when she was with me in Germany, it\u2019s not a pretty house.",
        "Q: Okay. But then that house that \u2014",
        "A: Th-That \u2014 that was in Buttenwiessen, that was \u2014 that\u2019s not the one \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s your grandfather\u2019s house.",
        "A: That\u2019s my grandfather\u2019s house.",
        "Q: I see.\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "A: That was confiscated by the Nazis, my grandmother had to sign it over, and after\nthe war, we did get some restitution for it.",
        "Q: Okay. When did you stop speaking German?",
        "A: I always spoke German in \u2014 I mean, when my parents passed away, I didn\u2019t have\nanybody to speak German to any more. But I went to s \u2014 American conversation\nschool in, I think it was Webster School, here in D.C., 10 and Eight Street,\nnorthwest.",
        "Q: So you moved to Washington when you came to the United States?",
        "A: Oh yeah. And I learned little bit there, and they got my father a job on a chicken\nfarm in Virginia, which that was a horror. Anyway, they put me into the public\nschool there in a little place called Midlothian.",
        "Q: I\u2019ve heard of Midlothian.",
        "A: It\u2019s outside of Richmond.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I went to school there. I didn\u2019t know what was coming up, but I was s-starting to\nlearn English, and \u2014 and then \u2014",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s where Holland American line had their pier at that time. But we saw the\nStatue of Liberty. And we always had heard how warm it gets in America in the\nsummertime. Of course, this was February, I didn\u2019t realize it snowed here in the\nwinter. And we arrived in a snowstorm.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And we were picked up by a nephew of my father, a first cousin of mine. And he\nand another relative, they picked us up, they took us into New York City, and they\nshowed me the wa \u2014 the Empire State Building, the biggest building in the world,\nI couldn\u2019t believe it. I kept looking up.",
        "Q: Well, I remember \u2014 I\u2019m from Boston, and I had been to New York a couple of\ntimes before, when I was, you know, growing up. But a friend of mine convinced\nme to move there when I was a young adult. And for the first three days I felt like,\noh, these are such statues, they\u2019re so big and I\u2019m so little, you know. And I never\nthought I could fee \u2014 have that feeling, cause I\u2019m a city kid, you know, and you\u2019re\nused to tall buildings. But New York has that, you know, effect on people.",
        "A: Well, they \u2014 they put us on the train that afternoon for Washington, because we\nhad an affidavit from people who lived in Washington. We stayed with them at\nfirst, then we lived in rooming houses and so on.\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "Q: So it was a little tough to begin with.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Had your father been able to get any of his capital out, any \u2014 any sa \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. So it was only the 250 marks.",
        "A: Per person, yeah.",
        "Q: Per person. That is tough. That is very tough. So you didn\u2019t forget German, in\nother words.",
        "A: No. Well, we spoke it at home, so \u2014",
        "Q: Even in the United States?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Cause some people \u2014 some people either refused to, or they were in an\nenvironment which didn\u2019t encourage it.",
        "A: Well, we spoke less and less when we went out, because when the war started,\nlot of people didn\u2019t like the Germans, so we tried to speak English when we went\nout.",
        "Q: During the war, what do you remember of your parents\u2019 demeanor?",
        "A: Well, they\u2019re \u2014",

        "A: Well, they\u2019re very concerned about the relative that are still over there, not\nhearing anything. At first we got mail from them, but it was all censored. You\u2019d see\nletters with something blacked out, or cut out. Every piece of mail we got was\ncensored, even before they\u2019re at war with the United States. Because you have the\nperiod from 1939 to \u201941 when the British and the Frenchman [indecipherable]",
        "Q: That\u2019s right. When was the first time that you learned of the fates of your \u2014 of\nyour family, of your larger extended fa \u2014",

        "Q: Was it only after the war?",
        "A: After the war. You couldn\u2019t find out anything during the war. We tried to send\nmail through the Red Cross, but wasn\u2019t much luck there.",
        "Q: When did you go back? Cause you mentioned before that you went back.",

        "A: I was over there from 1954 into \u201955.",
        "Q: That\u2019s pretty early, considering. You know, ma \u2014 considering that many people\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t go back, if at all, in the 70s or the 80s, or to see the places they had\nbeen to. Did you go back to Straubing when you were in the military?\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "A: Yeah. When a\u2014 when I was in the army, I didn\u2019t want to go to Korea, and it just\nso happens that I knew a few people in personnel at Fort Benning, Georgia, and I\nmentioned to them if they ever have a levy for somebody with my MOS, which is a\npharmacist\u2019s MOS, I would be very happy to go to Germany, yeah, I just did not\nwant to go to Korea. So before I knew it, here I had orders to go to Germany.",
        "Q: And where were you based?",
        "A: I was \u2014 first we arrived in Bremerhaven, and from there we were shipped down\nto Zweibrucken, where all the troops were disseminated all over Germany. Now,\nZweibrucken was very interesting. They had us take our patches off of our\nuniforms so they couldn\u2019t tell where we came from in the United States because it\n\u2014 it was still the height of the Cold War. So a\u2014I was hoping I would be sent to\nFrankfurt where the general hospital, I was hoping to be stationed there. I think it\nwas the 97\" general hospital, I\u2019m not sure any more the number. And lo and behold\nthe orders came down, 97\" general hospital, Frankfurt. I was so happy because\nFrankfurt was the center, I knew I could travel all over Germany once I got there.\nWe got to there, said we have no need for pharmacists here. If you want to stay\nhere, you \u2014 we can put you in the motor pool. Well, being a young pharmacist just\nout of school, I\u2019m not going to get my fingernails dirty in the motor pool. So I was \u2014\nwe were transferred to triple seven nine, which was a outfit of nothing but medical\nSeptember 16, 2010\nspecialists. And from there we were assigned, and I ended up in a place \u2014 I was sent\nto Wurzburg. And, funny thing, that\u2019s very close to where that Torah that my dad\nbrought over was written. Anyway, when we got to Wiirzburg we\u2019re told \u2014 we\nwere there cause that was just the headquarters, and I was sent to a place called\nWildflecken.",
        "Q: And is that in Bavaria too?",
        "A: It\u2019s in the Rhine valley. We were \u2014 I was stationed seven miles from east\nGermany.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: It was in the middle of nowhere. Nobody in Germany knew where Wildflecken\nwas.",

They had\ntaken all the tombstones out, they had plundered them, they were going to reuse\nthem. And they took the names [indecipherable]. When war ended, they brought\nthem back, the one they still had, just put them anywhere. So that was the story\nthere.

        "Q: Okay. So some of it was done at that time. Maybe it was a i\u2014 maybe it was a\nlittle more streamlined for people who came from Germany, than from those who\nwould have come from Poland or from the Czech Republic.",

        "A: Well, my father got \u2014 had the Iron Cross, and he had the Bavarian Service Cross.\nIn fact, I\u2014 they\u2019re at the Holocaust Museum, I \u2014 that was among the items I gave\nthem. And I put the \u2014 that together with the postcard he sent us from Dachau saying\nthat that was his thanks from the fatherland for his service in World War I.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s enough to make you bitter. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add,\nthat we haven\u2019t talked about, that you think is important for people to know in the\nfuture?",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 the important thing is to keep faith and do the best you can, and like\nsome things in Germany, I \u2014 y-you can\u2019t \u2014 just can\u2019t forgive, it\u2019s just something\nthat they did to you. And like when I went to Germany, all the other G.I.s, they\nwere going out with German girls, I wouldn\u2019t go out with any of them, I didn\u2019t want\nto have anything to do with anybody, for tho \u2014 for those reasons.",

        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s some people, but a \u2014 no, I\u2019m ver \u2014 very \u2014 Pm \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not\nOrthodox. We go to Conservative services. We \u2014 we don\u2019t eat pork products, things\nlike that. But \u2014 but we \u2014 we believe that we\u2019re Jewish, but we\u2019re not fanatically\nJewish.",
        "Q: My \u2014 my point of this 1s that a lot of people who have been through some of the\nHolocaust experiences lost their faith in God as a result.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No. That \u2014 well, those were two separate things for you.",

And I run \u2014 I\u2019ve run that, now this\u2019Il be my\neighth year that I\u2019m running \u2014 running it. I think it\u2019s ti \u2014 I should have taken my\nsabbatical this year. Then Passover I \u2014 they found somebody who knows how to\nlead a Seder, so I led the Seder for over 200 people this last year. That\u2019s the fourth\ntime I\u2019ve led it, but this year, the biggest crowd they ever had for their second\nSeder.\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "Q: Wow. Well, this is again, a question that I asked before, are Seders generally\ntraditionally celebrated within a circle, a small circle, a family circle, or a\ncommunity one?",
        "A: This is a community one. Most everybody goes with their family on the first\nnight, so on the second night \u2014",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: \u2014 we have \u2014 we have here what they call second Seder. I\u2019ve run the show for the\nlast four years. I\u2019ve done a lot of things to liven it up. P\u2019ve gone on the internet and\ngotten parodies for f-famous songs, which a \u2014 which are funny, like Clementine \u2014",
        "Q: Oh yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 songs like that. Like we started off the Seder, there\u2019s this tune, if There\u2019s No\nBusiness Like Show Business, and started off, there\u2019s no Seder like our Seder.\nWhen we go back after the meal to finish off the second half of the Seder, I started\noff, instead of Take Me Back to the Ballgame, take me back to the Seder. And\nI\u2019ve put in about a half a dozen or more songs, and they enjoy that. I have them\nprinted up, the song sheets, and they\u2019re at all the tables, and they sing along.",
        "Q: We \u2014 a person needs a master of ceremonies like that.",
        "A: So I-Pve \u2014 I\u2019ve livened it up quite a bit.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "A: And they enjoyed it. Th-The \u2014 and it\u2019s also a very fast Seder. Some people have\nSeders that run til 11 o\u2019clock, 12 o\u2019clock at night, they drag everything out. Mine\nis, they wouldn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t believe me, I said, I\u2019ll have you eating dinner within 30\nminutes. And we did.",
        "Q: And you did. What would you want the people of Straubing to know about your\nfamily?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t care. We were there, we sent them a few things and \u2014 for their\nsynagogue, they \u2014 like a little museum, whatever they wanted to build, I sent them\nsome things and I never heard much from them, so \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It\u20141t\u2019s changed. Straubing was originally, it was German Jews. After the war it\nwas Polish Jews, and now it\u2019s all Russian Jews.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, different people.",

There was a Rabbi Luchs in Davenport, Iowa, and he saw to it\nthat everybody in the family had to give some sort of affidavit to try to get the\npeople out. And that\u2019s how we got out, and what happened was, in Germany the\nAmerican consulate of course had a quota, so we got a number, just like you go to\nthe delicatessen \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 when you would go in, there\u2019s the number that we had to go to the consulate in\nStuttgart.\nSeptember 16, 2010",

I remember one thing, my parents were so worried that we wouldn\u2019t get\nout, cause I had a terrible cough, and it\u2019s \u2014 they thought maybe the doctors might\nreject me because I had this cough that the \u2014 I might have bronchitis or something.\nSo when we were there, everything was in order except for one thing. My father\ndoesn\u2019t know whether it was an accident or whether they did it on purpose, they put\nthe year, it was just after the first of the year, it was in January, instead of putting\nthe date 1939, they put 1938. And so they wouldn\u2019t give us our papers to come out.\nSeptember 16, 2010\nSo, we didn\u2019t want to get to stop, because they always would come by and pick up\nour passports, then we had a hard time getting the passports back.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So my dad left us with \u2014 my mother and me with relatives in Augsburg. We\nstayed there the int \u2014 this 1s on Friday, so we stayed there all weekend. When Dad\ntook the first train Monday morning to Straubing, never went to our house, went\nstraight to the authorities, wherever he had to go to get this corrected. Then he got\nthe next train to Stuttgart, went to the consulate, got the papers, came back and\npicked this up at \u2014 in Augsburg, we went back to Straubing that night, and we got\neverything in order, we th \u2014 all the packing, the \u2014 everything had been packed\nalready anyway, to get our luggage and everything, to leave Germany. And the ne\n\u2014 the very first train out that was \u2014 head for Holland, we were on.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 what they had done to it. They had plundered all that. In the morning \u2014 well, in\nthe middle of the night that night, they came and tried to break into our house.\nBeing small, I never heard a thing. I slept through the whole thing. In the morning\nwhen I woke up, I heard the doorbell ringing downstairs. They weren\u2019t able to break\ninto the house, the door was too strong. The police were there to arrest my dad, and\ntook him to the jailhouse in Straubing, and after a couple of days he was shipped\noff to Dachau.",
        "Q: And tell me about your mother, what happened with your mother?",

        "A: Well, of course she was frantic, and she didn\u2019t know what to do.

And she went up there every day, she brought something for him\nevery day, this is on \u2014 on \u2014 and on the third day \u2014",

        "A: No, it was a little bit different. He wou \u2014 he knew we\u2019re allowed to send\npostcards after e-every so often. And this is the thing that he sent. Now the \u2014 what I\nreme \u2014 would \u2014 thought would be an ironic thing 1s \u2014",

And I never\nthought I could fee \u2014 have that feeling, cause I\u2019m a city kid, you know, and you\u2019re\nused to tall buildings. But New York has that, you know, effect on people.",

        "A: No, they \u2014 they just more or less indoctrinated me to be careful when I go in the\nstreet and not to mingle too much with \u2014 with the other kids.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s the only one that I really know about.",
        "A: Mm-hm.\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "A: My parents had some German friends, but as times went on they \u2014 they didn\u2019t\nhave that much to do with them. More or less stayed with the Jewish people who\nwere in town.",
        "A: Well, Crystal Night, that was the end of it. Crystal Night they broke into the\nsynagogue, and where \u2014 there was one room in there, schoolroom, which they used\nbefore for Hebrew school, was that got to be our classroom, and of course with the\n\u2014 everybody having been arrested and being sent to Dachau, there was no more\nschool, and that was it, they \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, all th \u2014 all the men and the ne \u2014 well, on Crystal Night they broke into the\nsynagogue, they tried to break into our house, but the door was so strong they\ncouldn\u2019t break in, and one of the neighbors across the street hollered out of his\nwindow, let those people alone, they haven\u2019t done anything to you, or something of\nthat nature, and they went away. And in the morning, they \u2014 the police came to\nSeptember 16, 2010\narrest my father, to put him under protective custody, and three days later he was in\nDachau.",
        "A: I was upstairs and I just heard \u2014 heard them downstairs.",
        "A: It was terrifying. And my mother had nerve enough to go every day up to the\npolice station as long as he was there. They allowed her to visit \u2014 well, n-not to\nactually visit him, to bring him things like warm clothing and stuff like that, and\nthey passed that on to him.",
        "A: Three weeks. And that \u2014 he would have gotten out after four weeks anyhow,\nbecause all veterans from World War I were released from Dachau at that time. But\nmy mother had heard that somebody went to the Gestapo and asked for their\nhusband to be released, next day he came in. So Mother said, well, what can I lose?\nSo she took the train to Regensburg, asked for his release and couple of days later,\nhere he was at home.",
        "A: Well, he looked gaunt and they took the clothing and everything away from\nthem, put them in these uniforms like you s-see from the prisoners in Auschwitz\nSeptember 16, 2010\nand everywhere. And it was cold of winter and they had on something about the\nwarmth of a pajama.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And it was very cold in Europe.",
        "A: Well he di \u2014 said some of the things like when they \u2014 they taunted them when\nthey got off the buses there. They had hoses and stuff and they swung at them and\nthey made them run here and there and everything.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s all we could speak, because that \u2014 that was our native tongue.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, we already had our visas and everything to come to the United States, so\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 everything had been planned. He got home in early December of\n\u00b038, and we had our appointment with the American consulate in January, first\nweek in January. And we went to Stuttgart to the consulate and of course\nsomebody, on purpose I guess, instead of putting the date 1939 on one of the\npapers, \u201938, so that slowed everything down, my father had to go back and forth. So\nthey used to come by every other day just about to pick up your passport and take it\naway from you. So there would be no chance of them getting our passport, we\ndidn\u2019t come home from Stuttgart. We went from there to Augsburg, stayed with\nrelatives over the weekend, and first thing on Monday morning, my dad took the\ntrain to Straubing, went to get the date changed on that paper, went from there to\nStuttgart, got \u2014 saw the American consulate, got everything straight, picked us up\nlate at night in Augsburg, we took th \u2014 in the night, the train back to Straubing.\nAnd the next train that left for Holland, we were on it to get out of the country.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: My \u2014 my uncle, who had become ill and he was an invalid, and he couldn\u2019t get\naround any more, so my mother\u2019s sister lived with him, she was divorced. And she\nand her son lived in Holland and took care of my uncle so we had a place where to\nSeptember 16, 2010\nstay til they shipped \u2014 because ba \u2014 my dad already had tickets before even Crystal\nNight, for us to leave Germany on January 28\" of 1939.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Well, to get out of Germany, you just couldn\u2019t say we\u2019re gonna leave.",
        "A: You had to have paperwork, and the \u2014 the United States had a quota, how many\npeople from each country that they would accept. So it was like getting a number in\nthe delicatessen counter, you had to have a number, in the order of your number,\nyou were called to Stuttgart. And we knew that it was January sixth that we were\nto appear there.",
        "A: It was va \u2014 well, we had to pass phy \u2014 physical exam, they weren\u2019t going to take\njust anybody to come to United States.\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "A: We were allowed to take, I think it was 250 marks, German money. Or was it \u2014\nthen two fi \u2014 I think it was 250 marks per person, that\u2019s all the money we were\nallowed to take with us.",
        "A: Oh yeah, in \u2014 once we knew that we were leaving, in fact, before we even went\nto the consulate, we had a big van \u2014 it\u2019s like \u2014 like they were years ahead, it was\nlike the \u2014 today the containers that they \u2014 ships things, we were able to take all of\nour furniture and stuff with us. But, they had to be inspected by the German\ngovernment. They put a value on every item, and you had to pay a tax of that\namount to them.",
        "A: For your \u2014 for your own stuff.",
        "A: Well, my grandmother was still there. She \u2014 she wasn\u2019t with us, so she was there\nin the apartment. And as the different apartments vacated, my grandmother was able\nto go to Holland and then stay with her daughter, she was able to do that. In fact,\nshe was in Holland when the Germans invaded.",
        "A: Well, she died in Sobibor. I think it\u2019s Sobi \u2014 I\u2019m not sure whether Sobibor or\nMauthausen, one of those two.",
        "A: Well, his brother, who was younger than he was a physician. He didn\u2019t say a\nword to anybody, all of a sudden we got word he was in Switzerland. From\nSwitzerland he went on to then Palestine, there was no Israel yet. And he\npracticed medicine in \u2014 in Israel. And he \u2014 he p \u2014 he lived through the war. In fact,\nafter his wife passed away, he went back to Germany, and he was an official in the\nGerman government in the medical section, with an office in Munich.",
        "A: Well, but this was quite a bit after the war. He didn't got back immediately, he\nwent back a long time after, in the 50s.",
        "A: And his sisters, three of them who were still living, and they succumbed in the\nHolocaust.",
        "A: Mm-hm.\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "A: Straubi\u2014 well, one was in Regensburg and one was in Landshut and one was\nin Straubing.",
        "A: Well, th-they looked after the war, and it took time til we got them. Now, in the\narticles that I gave to \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Suzy, there\u2019s a lot of paperwork in there from letters that were written, and\nwhere \u2014 where the people ended up. And we got notices through the Red Cross\nfrom the family in Holland where they were, and what happened to them.",
        "A: No, he \u2014 he passed away before the war, he was sickly and after we left, he went\ndownhill real fast, and in fact we were in the United States only about two months\nwhen my mother got word that he passed away.",
        "A: She ended up in Auschwitz, she and her son.",
        "A: Well, the lot of them didn\u2019t, they had to have, first of all an affidavit, someone to\nsponsor them to come to United States. And a lot of people even if they didn\u2019t have\nthat yet, they got themselves a number, and a lot of them did have the affidavits, but\nthe war broke out \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 before \u2014 they were caught in there before they had a chance \u2014 before the\nnumber came up.",
        "A: Eight.",
        "A: Well, it was very unusual. As we were go \u2014 the train was going toward the\nborder, German SS men came through, they were inspecting people and hoping that\nthey wouldn\u2019t call you out. And we saw them passing by our compartment and they\nseemed to bypass us. All of sudden we heard the con \u2014 the conductors going\nthrough speaking Dutch. They\u2019d been at the border, the Germans were gone, the\nSeptember 16, 2010\nDutch were in, and we opened the window and we spit out the Swiss \u2014 the end of\nGermany.",
        "A: Okay. On Crystal Night they broke into the synagogue.",
        "A: It was a bunch of thugs. They came and ransacked the place. They couldn\u2019t burn\nit because it was in a residential area and they couldn\u2019t get permission from the fire\ndepartment to burn the synagogue down. So they ransacked everything and I did see\nthe results of it, and I\u2019ve never seen such a mess of total destruction, like a bomb\nhad hit the place. And when wi \u2014 they \u2014 they came in, just about destroyed\neverything. When my father came back from Dachau, he had \u2014 we had \u2014 we were\nready to leave Germany, we were ready to pack everything. And on the list of\nitems we were permitted to take out was the Torah. So he went to the Gestapo and\nhe showed them papers where he was, could he get his Torah back? The Torah \u2014",
        "A: That was his Torah, it was af \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 1-1t was \u2014 1t was in \u2014 our family\u2019s Torah. That was written by my great-\ngrandfather, which is another story. And anyway \u2014",
        "A: Anyway, he went there to get the Torahs, he was \u2014 there was jus \u2014 he was told.\nAnd when he got there, there was a room that had Torahs and prayer books, all kind\nof religious material just laying in a big heap. Well, he picked up his Torah and he\nsaw all these others there, being desecrated through \u2014 the Torah\u2019s supposed to be \u2014\nalways be standing up. So he took all the Torahs and stood them up. And he saw a\nbox there, so he took one Torah, he put it into this box, and he took the silverware\nthat was there, the breastplate, the \u2014 the silver hand and the crown and he put all\nthat into the box, and he closed the box up. Well, I am not sure, but the \u2014 when they\nfound this Torah after the war, there in the box with all that, it had to be the Torah\nmy father had put in there, cause what probably happened, I surmise that they came\n\u2014 the Gestapo came by to pick up all these items, and there\u2019s this box there, they\ndidn\u2019t look in it, and it was left. And somebody probably would say, oh my God,\nthere\u2019s Torahs here. If they catch me with this, they\u2019re going to cut my head off,\nsend me a concentration camp or do something. So they headed for the war, and\nafter the war was over, they discreetly brought it back and just left it there. And I\nhave a hunch that\u2019s what happened, but from what they said the Torah \u2014 th-the box\nSeptember 16, 2010\nlooked like \u2014 of what my father had \u2014 the story he\u2019d always told, I put the two \u2014 t-t-\ntwo together and it had to be that.",
        "A: After \u2014",
        "A: Shortly after the war.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It appeared in the \u2014 in \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 no, 1n the si \u2014 in the police station.",
        "A: That\u2019s where it disappeared from. That\u2019s where my father, when he went to pick\nup his Torah \u2014",
        "A: And he put it into the box.",
        "A: And so I \u2014 I just put two and two together, but the fact that my dad mentioned it\nso often \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: But in the film you don\u2019t get that, because they didn\u2019t ask me about it, I had no\nidea that\u2019s how the film was going to end up, cause they just asked me about our\nTorah, the story of it, and \u2014",
        "A: That was for German tel \u2014 this Wolfgang Bergman was the producer, and \u2014",
        "A: Of the missing Torah \u2014 well, the story \u2014 what had happened to this Torah,\nwhere\u2019d they find it from. [phone ringing]",
        "A: Whe-Where did it come from. They had interviewed a lot of German people\nabout Crystal Night there, and it \u2014 they \u2014 they had \u2014 th-this film was made a-\nactually after the war, in 1989, so much later.",
        "A: And you\u2019ve got the \u2014 the film there, so you can go through it and see it, it\u2019s all in\nGerman. And anyway, you want to know the story about the Torah.",
        "A: Well, my great-grandfather, Moses Firnbacher, was in the United States, and\nhe hit gold in the goldrush in ninet \u2014 1849.",
        "A: And he took his belongings, his riches from the goldrush, brought it back to\nGermany, to Gossmannsdorf where the family lived, and like any other young\nman, he got married there, started a business, and he had children of his own, and\nthe oldest was my grandfather, Joseph Firnbacher. And for his Bar Mitzvah he\nwanted to have a Torah written. Since he\u2019d gotten all this gold, he had wealth. So he\nhad a Torah written, and they brought the Torah scribe, a sofer into the house, and\nhe lived with them for a whole year, and every week he wrote that week\u2019s portion\nfor the Torah, til it was finished, for my grandfather\u2019s Bar Mitzvah. And this, when\nSeptember 16, 2010\nthey moved to Straubing, my grandfather went there, I guess, for greener pastures\nor exactly what I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t around yet then.",
        "A: And they went to Straubing, the Torah came with them and then my father was\nBar Mitzvahed from it and it belonged to the family and when we left Germany,\nwe \u2014 we brought it with us.",
        "A: Then I was Bar Mitvahed out of it and our son was.",
        "A: It\u2019s at Ohr Kodish in \u2014 in Chevy Chase.",
        "A: Mm-hm",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Oh, they didn\u2019t care. [phone ringing]\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "A: No, he just \u2014 he just went there, he showed the paper, this is it, 1t\u2019s got the\napproval, bingo.",
        "A: They made a phone call, the police station released the Torah to him.",
        "A: And then, the thing is this. Here he 1s, it\u2019s a snowy, wintry day, my father is\ncarrying a Torah through the streets of Nazi Germany to ki \u2014 bring it to our house,\nwhi \u2014 it was a brave thing. But I have a hunch that half the \u2014 not more than half, 90\npercent of the people wouldn\u2019t have even known what he was carrying.",
        "A: Some of them were the same. Some of them th-they\u2019re real Nazis.\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "A: And more or less, watch out.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: But they let me go freely, even a-as a seven and eight year old. I would wander\naround the city cause I \u2014 well, na \u2014 the section where we lived. I didn\u2019t go all over\ntown, but in section where we lived, I walked around freely.",
        "A: I won\u2019t say it was pretty, it was just typical houses there. In fact, our house, we \u2014\nwe weren\u2019t that far from the railroad lines. And when the allies bombed over there,\nour house was hit. And it \u2014 they took the same bricks that were get \u2014 from the\nhouse. It was three stories high, and they had enough bricks to rebuild it two stories.\nAnd when Betsy saw it when she was with me in Germany, it\u2019s not a pretty house.",
        "A: Th-That \u2014 that was in Buttenwiessen, that was \u2014 that\u2019s not the one \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s my grandfather\u2019s house.\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "A: That was confiscated by the Nazis, my grandmother had to sign it over, and after\nthe war, we did get some restitution for it.",
        "A: I always spoke German in \u2014 I mean, when my parents passed away, I didn\u2019t have\nanybody to speak German to any more. But I went to s \u2014 American conversation\nschool in, I think it was Webster School, here in D.C., 10 and Eight Street,\nnorthwest.",
        "A: Oh yeah. And I learned little bit there, and they got my father a job on a chicken\nfarm in Virginia, which that was a horror. Anyway, they put me into the public\nschool there in a little place called Midlothian.",
        "A: It\u2019s outside of Richmond.",
        "A: I went to school there. I didn\u2019t know what was coming up, but I was s-starting to\nlearn English, and \u2014 and then \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, we di \u2014 no, we sai \u2014 we \u2014 we landed in Hoboken, New Jersey.\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "A: That\u2019s where Holland American line had their pier at that time. But we saw the\nStatue of Liberty. And we always had heard how warm it gets in America in the\nsummertime. Of course, this was February, I didn\u2019t realize it snowed here in the\nwinter. And we arrived in a snowstorm.",
        "A: And we were picked up by a nephew of my father, a first cousin of mine. And he\nand another relative, they picked us up, they took us into New York City, and they\nshowed me the wa \u2014 the Empire State Building, the biggest building in the world,\nI couldn\u2019t believe it. I kept looking up.",
        "A: Well, they \u2014 they put us on the train that afternoon for Washington, because we\nhad an affidavit from people who lived in Washington. We stayed with them at\nfirst, then we lived in rooming houses and so on.\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Per person, yeah.",
        "A: No. Well, we spoke it at home, so \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, we spoke less and less when we went out, because when the war started,\nlot of people didn\u2019t like the Germans, so we tried to speak English when we went\nout.",
        "A: Well, they\u2019re \u2014\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "A: Well, they\u2019re very concerned about the relative that are still over there, not\nhearing anything. At first we got mail from them, but it was all censored. You\u2019d see\nletters with something blacked out, or cut out. Every piece of mail we got was\ncensored, even before they\u2019re at war with the United States. Because you have the\nperiod from 1939 to \u201941 when the British and the Frenchman [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, as \u2014 as word got through, it was difficult to find the \u2014 my parents would\nwrite to everywhere \u2014 to everybody everywhere, the \u2014",
        "A: After the war. You couldn\u2019t find out anything during the war. We tried to send\nmail through the Red Cross, but wasn\u2019t much luck there.",
        "A: I went back to Germany when I\u2019m in \u2014 in the military.",
        "A: I was over there from 1954 into \u201955.\nSeptember 16, 2010",
        "A: Yeah. When a\u2014 when I was in the army, I didn\u2019t want to go to Korea, and it just\nso happens that I knew a few people in personnel at Fort Benning, Georgia, and I\nmentioned to them if they ever have a levy for somebody with my MOS, which is a\npharmacist\u2019s MOS, I would be very happy to go to Germany, yeah, I just did not\nwant to go to Korea. So before I knew it, here I had orders to go to Germany.",
        "A: I was \u2014 first we arrived in Bremerhaven, and from there we were shipped down\nto Zweibrucken, where all the troops were disseminated all over Germany. Now,\nZweibrucken was very interesting. They had us take our patches off of our\nuniforms so they couldn\u2019t tell where we came from in the United States because it\n\u2014 it was still the height of the Cold War. So a\u2014I was hoping I would be sent to\nFrankfurt where the general hospital, I was hoping to be stationed there. I think it\nwas the 97\" general hospital, I\u2019m not sure any more the number. And lo and behold\nthe orders came down, 97\" general hospital, Frankfurt. I was so happy because\nFrankfurt was the center, I knew I could travel all over Germany once I got there.\nWe got to there, said we have no need for pharmacists here. If you want to stay\nhere, you \u2014 we can put you in the motor pool. Well, being a young pharmacist just\nout of school, I\u2019m not going to get my fingernails dirty in the motor pool. So I was \u2014\nwe were transferred to triple seven nine, which was a outfit of nothing but medical\nSeptember 16, 2010\nspecialists. And from there we were assigned, and I ended up in a place \u2014 I was sent\nto Wurzburg. And, funny thing, that\u2019s very close to where that Torah that my dad\nbrought over was written. Anyway, when we got to Wiirzburg we\u2019re told \u2014 we\nwere there cause that was just the headquarters, and I was sent to a place called\nWildflecken.",
        "A: It\u2019s in the Rhine valley. We were \u2014 I was stationed seven miles from east\nGermany.",
        "A: It was in the middle of nowhere. Nobody in Germany knew where Wildflecken\nwas.",
        "A: You\u2019ve been there?",
        "A: They took \u2014 after the war, they put up a lot of the displaced persons up there, and\nthe place was covered like a forest, because the Germans had secret installations\nthere, were testing, I believe there, buzz bombs that they were shooting over into\nEngland. They were testing them there, they had \u2014 there was a secret \u2014 it was a\nsecret base for the Germans, nobody had heard of Wildflecken. Where \u2014 where are\nSeptember 16, 2010\nyou stationed? Wildflecken. Never heard of it, where is it. And anyway, when they\ngot these displaced person there, they chopped all the trees down, they used them\nfor fire \u2014 firewood. And where we were stationed, we were in \u2014 I was in the\ndispensary, and w-we \u2014 it was like SS headquar \u2014 officers\u2019 quarters. So we w \u2014 as \u2014\nhere I was a PFC when I got there, that\u2019s private first class.",
        "A: Had a private room, not \u2014 not like military barracks, 1t - we \u2014 we \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 ba\u2014 we had \u2014 had German civilians who worked for us. I \u2014 I was training at \u2014 I\n\u2014I more or less re-did the entire pharmacy department there, because it hadn\u2019t had a\n\u2014 anybody who was a licensed pharmacist there, this \u2014 this German was a druggist,\nas the German call it, in other words, sells toothpaste and stuff like that.",
        "A: And I \u2014I taught him stuff, and as a result that \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: No? Cause there used to be a st \u2014 a real estate company here, Shannon and\nLuchs.",
        "A: And the Luchs family was a very large family, and about half of them came to\nthe United States way back, and a lot of them came at later dates, and the\noffsprings etcetera. There was a Rabbi Luchs in Davenport, Iowa, and he saw to it\nthat everybody in the family had to give some sort of affidavit to try to get the\npeople out. And that\u2019s how we got out, and what happened was, in Germany the\nAmerican consulate of course had a quota, so we got a number, just like you go to\nthe delicatessen \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 when you would go in, there\u2019s the number that we had to go to the consulate in\nStuttgart.\nSeptember 16, 2010",

        "A: So I thought that would be of interest.",
        "A: Yeah. I remember one thing, my parents were so worried that we wouldn\u2019t get\nout, cause I had a terrible cough, and it\u2019s \u2014 they thought maybe the doctors might\nreject me because I had this cough that the \u2014 I might have bronchitis or something.\nSo when we were there, everything was in order except for one thing. My father\ndoesn\u2019t know whether it was an accident or whether they did it on purpose, they put\nthe year, it was just after the first of the year, it was in January, instead of putting\nthe date 1939, they put 1938. And so they wouldn\u2019t give us our papers to come out.\nSeptember 16, 2010\nSo, we didn\u2019t want to get to stop, because they always would come by and pick up\nour passports, then we had a hard time getting the passports back.",
        "A: So my dad left us with \u2014 my mother and me with relatives in Augsburg. We\nstayed there the int \u2014 this 1s on Friday, so we stayed there all weekend. When Dad\ntook the first train Monday morning to Straubing, never went to our house, went\nstraight to the authorities, wherever he had to go to get this corrected. Then he got\nthe next train to Stuttgart, went to the consulate, got the papers, came back and\npicked this up at \u2014 in Augsburg, we went back to Straubing that night, and we got\neverything in order, we th \u2014 all the packing, the \u2014 everything had been packed\nalready anyway, to get our luggage and everything, to leave Germany. And the ne\n\u2014 the very first train out that was \u2014 head for Holland, we were on.",

        "A: What do I \u2014 well, I remember, cause I saw the synagogue afterwards \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 what they had done to it. They had plundered all that. In the morning \u2014 well, in\nthe middle of the night that night, they came and tried to break into our house.\nBeing small, I never heard a thing. I slept through the whole thing. In the morning\nwhen I woke up, I heard the doorbell ringing downstairs. They weren\u2019t able to break\ninto the house, the door was too strong. The police were there to arrest my dad, and\ntook him to the jailhouse in Straubing, and after a couple of days he was shipped\noff to Dachau.",

        "A: Well, of course she was frantic, and she didn\u2019t know what to do. She went to the\npolice station, and she found a very sympathetic policeman there, and she was able\nto give him warm clothe \u2014 underclothing and stuff, so that he could stay warm, it\nwas wintertime. And she went up there every day, she brought something for him\nevery day, this is on \u2014 on \u2014 and on the third day \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 on the third day he says, they\u2019re gone, he says. They asked where to, he says\nhe wasn\u2019t sure, but he thinks it\u2019s Dachau.",
        "A: No, it was a little bit different. He wou \u2014 he knew we\u2019re allowed to send\npostcards after e-every so often. And this is the thing that he sent. Now the \u2014 what I\nreme \u2014 would \u2014 thought would be an ironic thing 1s \u2014",
        "A: He\u2019s a world \u2014 World War I veteran. He had the Iron Cross. This 1s the Bavarian,\nsome sort of cross there fr \u2014 Bavarian. And in here are \u2014",
        "A: This 1s the fifth Bavarian, some kind of division, I guess, in the name of His\nMajesty, the German Kaiser, that my father got the Iron Cross, second class,\nSeptember 16, 2010\nwhatever that means, and so on. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the authentic papers that he got the\nIron Cross.",
        "A: Probably. But you know, the Iron Cross \u2014",

        "A: I\u2014this is a German script, which I can\u2019t read any more. That he got the \u2014 the\nmilitary fatinzkreuzter(ph). Some kind of a cross, that\u2019s the third class with\nhonors, or whatever. And that\u2019s for the other one, and then he can \u2014 received\nanother award, which I don\u2019t know anything about, and I don\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: No, he got this one 1916 \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and then this one 1917.\nSeptember 16, 2010",

        "A: That I don\u2019t know. Anyway \u2014 cause it\u2019s right \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it says right there. Yeah. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s ironic, that\u2019s why I said this will\nmake a nice exhibit, for he fought for this country, and this is his thanks that he\nreceived.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. What happened was, they had \u2014 my mother heard somebody had\ngone to the Gestapo and asked \u2014 this can go with that also \u2014",
        "A: They had \u2014 they had asked if their husband could be released. And because she\nhad nerve enough to go to the Gestapo, they released them. So my mother said,\nwell, I\u2019m going to go to the Gestapo, too. She took the train to Regensburg, went to\nthe Gestapo, and a couple days later, my dad walks in the door. And he said that\nwhen he left Dachau, cause he had \u2014 always had money with him, he \u2014 a lot of the\nSeptember 16, 2010\nothers who didn\u2019t have money couldn\u2019t buy things, he left money, almost all the\nmoney he had, he just kept enough so he could get home, he gave it to different\npeople, and he got letters later on thanking him for it. And as it turned out, a week\nafter he came home, they would have released him anyway cause they released all\nwar veterans the following week.",
        "A: This has to do with the \u2014 th-the \u2014 with the medals, also.",

        "A: So we just had to sit around and wait and they would come pick up his passport,\ngive it back to him. Have to go and pay a fine to get it back and what have you.\nAlso, on the first of January, everybody had to have a kennkarte.\nSeptember 16, 2010",

        "A: \u2014 little \u2014 little card, and I don\u2019t know what happened to that. And to be able to\ngo, everything you took with you, you had to pay a fine to the German, so this is\nSeptember 16, 2010\nJuden [speaks German] that\u2019s where you had to pay them the fine, or \u2014 they\nvalued everything, you had to pay them that much.",
        "A: Right.",

        "A: Well, their \u2014 they were very, very happy, of course, we were out of Germany.\nWell, in fact, when we crossed the border into Holland, wa \u2014 I opened up the\nwindow and I spit out. I remember that.",
        "A: Oh yeah. We were \u2014 I was harassed at school, and all along I knew \u2014 I\u2014I was\ntaught what \u2014 what I could do and what I couldn\u2019t do and how to behave myself.",
        "A: It was difficult.",
        "A: Right. Well, in fact, when we left Straubing, my grandmother was in\nStraubing, but she was back and forth. And my \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t let her go to the\nrailroad station to see us off because my mother knew that \u2014 and my father knew\nthat she would start howling and crying and everything, and they didn\u2019t want to\nhave any kind of a scene, so we said goodbye in the house before we left there.",

There was snow on the deck of the\nSeptember 16, 2010\nship. And everybody always said how hot it is in the United States \u2014 you know,\nyou couldn\u2019t believe it snowed over here. It was in February and we went off the\nship. We landed in Hoboken, went off the ship, through customs and one of my\nfather\u2019s nephews, my first cousin was there to meet us. And another cousin on my\nmother\u2019s side was there. And they took us \u2014 I guess it was the tubes, whatever they\ncalled the trains coming from New Jersey into New York, and showed me, I\nremember, the tallest building in the world, the Empire States building. They took\nus to lunch, and I don\u2019t remember where or what, and they put us on the train for\nWashington, somebody else was supposed to meet us here to pick us up. They\ndidn\u2019t show up for some reason or other, and we took a cab, because the people who\nsponsored us, who we were going to stay with, they were in their 70s already then.\nSo they didn\u2019t come out at night, and so this \u2014 I \u2014 he \u2014 missed connections or\nwhatever, and so we went by cab.",
