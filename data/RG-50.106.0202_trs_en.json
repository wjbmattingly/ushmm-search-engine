And we were actually astonished\nwhen we landed at Berlin, the capital of Germany and had to be there almost one half a year and\ndo the job. So this handles about the book and then it handles about actually the time when the\nGermans came to occupy the Czech area. And then it handles about even about the time that the\nCzech Republic changed to the communist republic. In both of these times were actually for us a\nvery hard time to survive this.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 21, 2012\nSo actually it had, it had the book handles about the surviving both of these times, the German\ntime and then the communist.",

When I went to Israel the first time in the 90s it wasn\u2019t built yet. And\nactually it is a pretty new museum. I was just astonished and I was very actually I was very glad\nthat I can see things which I actually wasn\u2019t aware of. I was very impressed about that.",
        "A: Yes, of course I learned some things and \u2014",
        "A: Well mostly about how people care about the times and how, how they are able to reproduce\nthings which are actually where I thought were forgotten because nobody actually right after the\nwar, actually nobody talked about this time. There were other sort of people and people got,\nactually tried to get their lives again and I think they hadn\u2019t time to talk about this. And when I\nsaw it after all this time, this museum I was very impressed by the way, how it handles things.\nAnd even there is another part of the museum which handles just children. And it is extremely\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDecember 21, 2012\ninteresting, this part of the children you know. Because how well the children survived and how\nthey actually got through these times.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah, because people are thinking in Germany all the people are, there is a part of the people\nwho are actually still having in mind the Nazi area. There are very few people and they do not\nhave any influence at the politics and I don\u2019t think that, and the people since that time is now 50\nor 55 years after the war. They just change in thinking and they are not any more racist I think.",
