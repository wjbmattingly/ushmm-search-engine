        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Eric\nBondy on Thursday, August 29th -- 1s it? Or 30th?",
        "Answer: If I can correct you, that -- Eric is my -- my real name is Heinz. Everybody calls\nme Heinz.",
        "Q: Aah.",
        "A: And we will get to that probably, but my name was changed when I went in the\nArmy, and from Heinz, Heinz Kristoff Erich (ph) it was changed to Eric H.",
        "Q: Aah.",
        "A: So that if captured or something it wouldn't be clear to the Germans that I was German\noriginally.",
        "Q: And was Bondy your original last name?",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. So you were born Heinz Kristoff Erich Bondy?",
        "A: That's correct.",
        "Q: But now today you are Eric H. Bondy?",
        "A: Right. And I'm called Heinz.",
        "Q: And you're called Heinz. Okay. Well, we're very grateful that you've agreed to speak\nwith us. I'll repeat once more that today is Thursday, August 30th, 2012. We are at\nyour home in Gaithersburg, Maryland. And I will start this interview like we do with all\nof them. We want to find out alittle bit about your earliest memories, your life, your\nparents, your family, the world that you were born into. So if you, if we can start with\na few factual details. The date you were born?",
        "A: June 2nd, 1924.",
        "Q: And did you have brothers and sisters?",
        "A: I had two sisters.",
        "Q: Are they older or younger?",
        "A: They were both older, and they're both dead now.",
        "Q: I see. What were their names?",
        "A: Anna Marie and Olla (ph).",
        "Q: Anna Marie and Olla?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And how much older were they from you?",
        "A: Three years. There were three years between each of us.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And where were you born?",
        "A: Where was I born? A place called Gunderstein in Germany.",
        "Q: Gunderstein. And what major city is that closest to?",
        "A: Oh, it's probably 60 miles from Hamburg.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Northern Germany?",
        "A: Northern Germany.",
        "Q: Northern Germany. And how would you describe your family? What was your father's\noccupation? What was your mother's? Did you have a large extended family? Tells us\nabout that.",
        "A: I will start with my grandfather, my father's father, who started out as a Jewish\npeddler with atray around his neck selling stuff from it, and he walked from what\nis now Czechoslovakia to Hamburg and established an export/import business and got\nvery rich and very successful. Fortunately, he died before the Nazis could take\naway all his money and his houses. And it was really his money that provided my\nparents with the money to -- they were school people. They always had boarding\nschools. And they got the money from my grandfather to do it. My mother was one of\nthe very early physicians and became a psychoanalyst. She studied with Dr. Freud, and\nhe became friends of the family. I remember that his daughter, Anna Freud, was also a\npsychoanalyst, used to come and visit frequently and was aclose friend of my\nmother -- of my mother's. So that that's how -- then my father had a PhD in Art\nHistory, and they decided to go into education. They believed in what was then a\nvery novel idea and progressive idea that they would have a co-educational boarding\nschool. And as the school grew, they moved from one place tothe other until they\nfinally ended up in aplace called Mariendahl (ph), which was a large school, became\na large school. I went to school there with about 200 students, and the school still exists\nin --",
        "Q: In Gunderstein?",
        "A: No, this is in -- it's also in Hamburg, but it's a different place. Gunderstein was the\nsecond school they had, and then Mariendahl was the third one. After that, of\ncourse, the Nazis came in 1933, and my parents were both Jewish, so it was clear\nthat this wasn't going to last very long, and for awhile the school continued\nbecause we had the Nazi minister of education's daughter in the school.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: So that --",
        "Q: What was her name? Do you remember?",
        "A: Her father's name was Kerrl, K-E-R-R-L. I don't remember her name. I was about\n10 or 12 at that time. And then my mother decided that the Nazis were going to be\nthere for along time. Well, my father thought they were just a passing problem. And\nwe prepared to go to Switzerland. And what is all this growling?",
        "Q: I know. I want to interrupt just for a second. No, no, no, it's okay. You can keep\nthe taping going. Just to say that if there's audio onthe tape it has some growling.\nWe have too lovely poodles who are guarding Mr. Bondy, and we have achoice of\nwhether or not they are inthe room and bark, or whether they're here and just have\na low-level growl. So for ambient audio noise, we have preferred the latter choice. So\njust to give future people who, you know, future listeners, an idea of why the\ngrowling is there; it's friendly growling.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: Okay. Can we back up just a little bit.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: I'd like to find out something. Do you have an earliest memory, of what you\nwould think would be one of your earliest memories?",
        "A: Iwas a passionate soccer player, and I remember playing soccer in Germany. And\nonce the Nazis came in, they decided that Jewish kids couldn't play soccer. So my\nearliest, earliest memory is not being allowed to play soccer anymore, which was a\ngreat blow to me.",
        "Q: Of course. For any boy, you know.",
        "A: {Laughter}",
        "Q: Tell usa little bit about your home life. If your mother was a psychoanalyst and\nyour father was, had a PhD in Art History you said?",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: -- and was involved in education, were they at home often? Did you have aclose\nrelationship? Were you brought up by nannies?",
        "A: We were pretty close, but they were running a boarding school, which means that\nwe all lived in one big dormitory. They had an apartment at one end, and my sisters\nand I lived atthe other end ofthe corridor.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And we had a pretty close relationship.",
        "Q: What was your father like?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: What kind ofa personality did your father have?",
        "A: It's hard to tell. He was avery pleasant person, had a lot of friends; very serious\nabout education. He was very much affected by his service in the first world war. He\nwas wounded in the first world war. I guess that's how he met my mother was\nstudying medicine in Vienna. And he was transferred, and at one point in order to be\nnear her joined what was called the Camel Corps, and I guess it was what is today\nPalestine. | Ofcourse, one of the problems that comes with being in a boarding\nschool is that you share your parents with alot of people. Of course, we didn't know\nany other -- any -- anything else. We had a Bavarian -- I guess she wasn't a nurse --\ncaretaker, who took care of us while they were busy. All I can remember about\nher is that she was extremely Catholic, while we were probably extremely\nnonreligious and, but she was very nice and stayed with us till we left.",
        "Q: About the first world war.",
        "A: Excuse me?",
        "Q: About the first world war, did your father tell you about how he came to be\nwounded?",
        "A: He was an artillery officer, but he very rarely talked about the war. He talked\nabout meeting my mother and things like that, but did not talk much about the war.",
        "Q: About his experience?",
        "A: One of his brothers was killed in the war.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And the two other brothers, who were very successful. One was called Cacord\n(ph) who -- I don't know if you're interested in this -- who started a school in\nGermany for Jewish immigrants, prepare them for emigration. He was probably wrong\nbecause he felt that they should learn carpentry and various other things.",
        "Q: I'm listening even as I am handing my colleague the writing.",
        "A: He was -- the school -- he was arrested and put in a concentration camp.",
        "Q: The uncle of yours?",
        "A: My uncle, yeah. And eventually, I don't know how he escaped or was released,\nand walked across Europe and came tothe United States and became a full\nprofessor at William and Mary, and then after the war went back to Germany and\nbecame the head of the Hamburg University.",
        "Q: Unusual on many counts.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: That's an unusual destiny on many counts.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You know, very few Jews went back to live in Germany after the war, and to\nhave such a prominent place in the life of a university and the city is --",
        "A: Iremember that he also when he went back he wrote a-- what you call those\ncolumns where you answer people's problems in the newspaper?",
        "Q: Oh, sort of an agony aunt. He would do that?",
        "A: Yeah, he did that for years.",
        "Q: Did he enjoy it?",
        "A: I guess so, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you ever read his columns?",
        "A: No.\n{Laughter from both}",
        "Q: I'm trying to get asense of how German your family was. You mentioned just\nbriefly your grandfather had come from Czechoslovakia, which wasn't Czechoslovakia",
        "A: No, it wasn't.",
        "Q: -- until 1918.",
        "A: Well, where he came from was what's called Bohemia then and was part of the\nAustrian Empire.",
        "Q: Was he German speaking?",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He was from an German area in Bohemia.",
        "Q: And your mother was from Austria?",
        "A: My mother was born in Austria. She took her medical training in Czechoslovakia\nand, but she was Jewish and she spoke perfect German.",
        "Q: And do they see themselves more German than Jewish?",
        "A: Never spoke Jewish. I never learned Jewish.",
        "Q: Never learned Yiddish?",
        "A: Yiddish, no. Never spoke anything but German, and later French, and that's it.",
        "Q: Did you -- when the Nazis came to power, you would have been nine years\nold.",
        "A: In 1933, Iwas 9 years old.",
        "Q: That's young, but would it -- young for the question I'm going to ask, but do\nyou remember your parents having discussions about the Nazis coming to power?",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes.",
        "Q: What was the tone of those discussions? Did they talk amongst themselves or did\nthey talk to you about them?",
        "A: Well, they explained antisemitism, which was a very strange concept to me, partly\nbecause I'd been brought up without any religion and didn't really realize that I was\nJewish until I was probably ten years old. They talked about the danger of the\nNazis and that they might have to do something about it, leave, or -- and they --\nmy mother was a psychoanalyst, so they believed in talking to children very openly,\nand so we pretty much knew by age 10 what was going on.",
        "Q: Do you remember how your sisters reacted? Did you talk amongst the siblings\nabout this?",
        "A: My oldest sister was six years older than I was.",
        "Q: So she was a teenager.",
        "A: And she was much more conscious when we left Germany of leaving her home\nand leaving her, and she had about the time she was 18, she was engaged toa\nyoung man who came with us to America later on, and she started a school\nalso, so --",
        "Q: What were the other kids in the school like when the Nazis came to power? Did\nyou feel that inthe classroom?",
        "A: The school, they were anti-Nazi and very protective of my parents. I don't think --\nat least that's along time ago --I don't think any of them turned out to be Nazis. I\nknow that one or two joined the SA in order to protect the school, but we didn't\nreally run into Nazis until probably 1935 when the State started appointing teachers\nto the school, and they were of course Nazis.",
        "Q: You said this was a private school?",
        "A: Yes, it was.",
        "Q: Okay. And it was largely funded by the money your grandfather had earned?",
        "A: Well, yeah, until the school started, and then it was funded by tuition.",
        "Q: Yeah. And you said he died before his --",
        "A: He died before -- I think he died in 1933, which was just the beginning of the\nNazi time in Germany, and they did not -- any Jewish push did not start until one\nor two years later.",
        "Q: Let's back up a little bit later. I didn't realize you knew him. What kind of\nrelationship did you have with your grandfather?",
        "A: Very little. He died when I was nine or 10. I knew he had a beautiful house in\nHamburg, as we visited occasionally, and my mother's mother -- my original\ngrandfather was blind and died early.",
        "Q: Your maternal grandfather?",
        "A: My maternal grandfather. She remarried and eventually died in Theresienstadt, both\nshe and her husband.",
        "Q: Your grandparents, Your step-grandfather and your grandmother?",
        "A: And my grandmother, yeah. I had -- it was amazing, I had two cousins. He was a\nchemist, and she was a social worker. They went to Theresienstadt for six years,\nand he survived because he was in charge of delousing, and she survived because she\ntook care of one of her children. But they told these stories; it always amazed me\nthat every morning she would knock on his window to let him know that she was\nstill alive. And they came to this country and had avery successful life here. He\ncame -- he worked for, I forgot what company in Pittsburg, a chemical company, and\ndid very well.",
        "Q: Was it Dupont?",
        "A: I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.",
        "Q: Was it Dupont? Was it Dupont?",
        "A: No. No. It was something, somebody else in Pittsburg, I don't remember the\ncompany.",
        "Q: Okay. Let's go back then to when your parents become increasingly concerned\nabout that the Nazis have come. Your father thinks it's passing. Your mother\nthinks, no, they're going to be here for a while. How did things evolve? How did\nthey develop at the school and in your parents' plans?",
        "A: Well, by that time, by 1935, Jews were not allowed to direct schools anymore,\nand my mother planned that we would go to Switzerland, and there were alot of\nJewish refugees in Switzerland. And my parents started a school. It was in a place\ncalled Gland, which was about halfway between Geneva and ?Lausanne?.",
        "Q: G-L-O-N?",
        "A: G-L-A:-N-D.",
        "Q: Gland. Okay.",
        "A: Gland. And inthe beginning the school was made up mostly of German refugee\nkids who had escaped to Switzerland, and the school was quite successful, but we\nstayed there onthe -- three years, and then in 1936 wecame tothe United States.",
        "Q: I'm alittle bit confused by the dates.",
        "A: 1938. I'm sorry.",
        "Q: All right. Do you remember anything about your leaving Gunderstein? Do you\nremember any details about when you left or how you left?",
        "A: I was two or three years old.",
        "Q: No, I meant when you left Germany to go --",
        "A: When I left Germany, yes, we were very worried about getting over the border\ninto Switzerland. I remember that.",
        "Q: Did you go by car?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Did you go by car?",
        "A: We went by three different cars. Had very little trouble at the border. We claimed\nthat we weren't Jewish because they were letting -- I can remember that I was very\nembarrassed because somebody asked me to take down my pants to prove that I\nwasn't Jewish, and I was only about 10 or 12, soit was very embarrassing, but\nprobably worth it.",
        "Q: {Laughter}",
        "A: And we started a school 1n Switzerland.",
        "Q: What I'm interested in is the detail of leaving Germany. Why would it have been\nthree cars?",
        "A: We took some other Jewish students with us, and we thought that the Swiss\nwould be more likely to let us inif there were small groups rather than one --",
        "Q: Larger group?",
        "A: -- larger group.",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t three cars in a row?",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t three cars in a row. We went at different times across the border. The\nSwiss were very anxious in those days about letting too many Jews into the country.",
        "Q: Were you and your parents and sisters in one car or were you split across the\nthree?",
        "A: Iwas inacar with my father and one sister, and my mother was inacar with\nanother sister.",
        "Q: And were you concerned? Do you remember if you were concerned about\nwhether they'll make it?",
        "A: Oh, absolutely. But that was atime of great concern anyway, all the way\naround.",
        "Q: Did your parents have assets?",
        "A: Assets?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: They had inherited a fair amount of money from my grandfather, but when you\nleft Germany in those days you were allowed to take a thousand dollars and -- a\nthousand marks, I guess it was -- and everything else was confiscated.",
        "Q: So they had inherited money, but did they have a house of their own? Did they\nhave a building?",
        "A: All that was lost. We had some friends in Switzerland who helped in the\nbeginning until the school got started, but we had almost no money at all.",
        "Q: Okay. And while you were in Switzerland was there discussion of what was\ngoing on in Germany?",
        "A: Oh, yes, of course, particularly since most of the students were from Germany and\nhad relatives in Germany and relatives in concentration camps, and it was always\ndiscussion of what was going on in Germany.",
        "Q: Had those students come from your school, your parents' schools, the ones --",
        "A: Some of them did. Some of them were children of people who had come to\nSwitzerland and --",
        "Q: And one question that kind of goes back a little bit: Your mother, as a\npsychoanalyst, did she have her own practice?",
        "A: She never practiced.",
        "Q: She never practiced?",
        "A: She practiced her trade in the school by seeing every child -- hey, stop growling\n-- she -- she -- the schools really were partly successful because she was there and\nworking with every child --",
        "Q: Individually?",
        "A: -- in the school.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. 1938, why would your parents decide to leave Switzerland? It was a\nsafe country.",
        "A: There was several reasons. One is that the Swiss were very dubious about having\nGermans, and they were sending people back to Germany at the time. Secondly,\nour visa had run out, and we were actually very lucky. In those days if you were\nJewish you had a\"J\" in your German passport, and American immigration laws in\nthose days meant that if you were Jewish it took three or four more years before\nyou could get, while they were perfectly happy to take non-Jewish Germans, and\nwe had a friend at the German Consulate in Geneva who made sure that we had\npassports without a \"J\" init, which gave us an early immigration visa to America.",
        "Q: I see. Isee. So for all those reasons -- so that when you left, do you remember\nleaving Switzerland?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did you leave?",
        "A: We went by car to France and took a ship -- I believe it was ?La Sauve? to the\nUnited States.",
        "Q: Did you speak French at the time?",
        "A: I spoke pretty good French then because I'd lived inthe French part of\nSwitzerland for two years.",
        "Q: And who was on this trip? Was it just your parents and sisters at this point?",
        "A: There were two other former students who came with us.",
        "Q: And your sister's fianc\u00e9?",
        "A: And my -- he had already -- he was non-Jewish, and he was able to get a visa for\nAmerica, so he was already in America by the time we got here.",
        "Q: Going back to when you were still in Germany and then also in Switzerland, your\nschool had non-Jewish kids in it?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: But was your social life confined to the people in the school? Did you have any\nother contact with Germans, non-Jewish Germans outside of the school?",
        "A: Yeah. Of course, I was very young, but, as I said, I played soccer alot, and we\nplayed other teams from other parts of Germany, and people came in from the area.\nThere was no prejudice against Jews atthe time. If there was, it was not apparent, and\nso we had alot of Germans who would --",
        "Q: By the time you leave Europe you're in France --",
        "A: Switzerland.",
        "Q: Switzerland. And then you go to France. And then --",
        "A: Well, we just drove through and sailed from France.",
        "Q: Did you feel German anymore?",
        "A: I didn't. I think was too young to really feel German. My sister, my oldest sister\nfelt very much that she had lost her home when she left. I didn't really. [never felt\nparticularly German, and having learned French in Switzerland, and so I actually all\nmy life I haven't felt particularly German?",
        "Q: Your language, you know, how you spoke with your parents.",
        "A: German.",
        "Q: German. Until the end?",
        "A: Until my sister's children would scream, \"English, please,\" when we were talking\nGerman, so that we eventually started talking German. My parents always had a very\nstrong accent because they'd left when they were already adults, and I guess I had a\nminimal accent so.",
        "Q: Well, Imean, the value of having another language in the house is the kids never\nunderstand what you're saying. And sometimes that's important. Where did you come\nto the United States? Where did you arrive, and where did you settle and why?",
        "A: We arrived at New York.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And at first all six of us lived in one hotel room.",
        "Q: Do you remember the name?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Do you remember where?",
        "A: I just remember that there were six of us inthe hotel room. {coughs) -- excuse me.",
        "Q: That's okay. Do you want some water?",
        "A: No. I'm all right. I'll get some ina minute. And I was --I was sent to an awful\nschool and didn't like it at all.",
        "Q: Was this in Manhattan?",
        "A: Iwas in-- it was a--I can't remember what kind of school it was. I was only\nthere for about six months.",
        "Q: Was this in Manhattan?",
        "A: It was in Manhattan.",
        "Q: It was Manhattan.",
        "A: But my parents very soon started a school in Windsor, Vermont.",
        "Q: Aah,",
        "A: The school was called the Windsor Mountain School. It was called the Windsor\nMountain School all the way through until it closed in 1987 or'86, or something like\nthat.",
        "Q: And how did they come to choose Vermont as the place to have the school?",
        "A: They had various friends, and one of them was a writer named Dorothy Canfield\nFisher, who was quite a famous writer at the time, and she lived in Arlington,\nVermont, and said there was this place that would be very good forthe school. So\nwe moved to -- the school then eventually moved to Manchester, Vermont, and then\nto Lenox, Massachusetts.",
        "Q: To Lenox, Massachusetts? That's quite a change. I mean, it's quite a change from\ncity life in New York to, I assume, town life in Vermont.",
        "A: We, I guess, were never really invested in New York, and plans were always to\nmove out back into the country, so --",
        "Q: So it didn't feel like much of a change?",
        "A: It didn't feel like much of a change, huh-uh.",
        "Q: What do you remember, and what can you tell and describe about those years\nright after you came, from 1938 through, through -- we'll come to the time when\nyou become a Ritchie Boy. But, you know, you're a teenager now, and you have\nAmerican society.",
        "A: Well, I went to a local high school because our school wasn't working yet. Then I\nwent to the Windsor Mountain School for my last two years of high school. Ihad a\nscholarship at a place called Wagner College in Staten Island, but after three months,\nbecause I was a German National, they asked me to leave, and through various\nfriends, and because I was a great soccer player, I got accepted at Swarthmore, and |\nstayed in Swarthmore for four years and graduated from Swarthmore.",
        "Q: I think much better than Wagner College.",
        "A: Much better than Wagner College, yes. And then I was the, I think, the first --\nthis was after the war of course, and they had to take the veterans. I got a master's\ndegree at ?Bridmall?, which I think I was the first man to get a degree in Bridmall.",
        "Q: What was your degree in?",
        "A: Modern European History.",
        "Q: Asa kid, well, sort of a young teenager adolescent coming to American, do you\nremember your first impressions of what this place was like, what the people were\nlike, what society was like?",
        "A: Very hard to remember. I think I was most worried about learning the language\nand learning to fit in. It wasn't that difficult because when the Windsor Mountain\nSchool started, there were only about eight students. It later became much larger, so\nthat we all had sort of a ready-made --",
        "Q: But before then you were inthis school which wasn't successful for you.",
        "A: I was only there for about six months. It was a Lutheran school, and it was\nterrible.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: I can't really remember why I hated it, but I think it was regimented it, and --",
        "Q: Was it strict?",
        "A: It was strict, and I didn't think we were learning anything in the classes. And, of\ncourse, by the time I was 15 or 16, I'd been through a fair amount of changes in my\nlife, so that I was probably more conscious of the world around me than the people\nmy age there, and that kind of bothered me.",
        "Q: Could be very lonely.",
        "A: I was lonely, because I didn't speak English very well.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: This was three months after we arrived in this country.",
        "Q: You mentioned that your parents had the friend in Vermont who was a well\nknown writer. Did they have acircle of people already in the United States that\nwere part of a social circle?",
        "A: They had, for instance?Tomus Mun? was a friend of theirs, and various other\nwriters. One of the first students was the daughter of Karl ?Sutmeyer? who was a\nGerman writer, and there was awhole group of German and American intellectuals\nwho supported the school and they helped us get going.",
        "Q: Well, it's unusual in many ways because most people who came inthe United\nStates didn't have such acircle, and it suggests that -- I don't mean the term in any\nnegative way -- but anelite kind of social circle thathad come from Europe.",
        "A: It certainly was easier for us than for many other German refugees. I don't -- you\nwere probably not alive in those days, but there was avery strong antisemetic strain\nin America at that time.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And coming from Germany, that was particularly --",
        "Q: You felt it?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. It was -- it wasn't clear at Swarthmore, which is a Quaker school, and\ntherefore obviously not -- but there was antisemitism in the area where we lived and\nyou could sort of sense it. Maybe we were overly sensitive about it. I don't know.",
        "Q: Well, the question I would have would be, did you remember instances where\nyou could see it? You know, things like that are very hard --",
        "A: Just remarks, but nothing physical or people would talk about kikes or something\nlike that.",
        "Q: They would say such things?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: They would say such things, using those words?",
        "A: That's how I learned that word. It was somebody -- and I can remember asking\nsomebody what does it mean, and they explained it to me.",
        "Q: Yeah, something that at that time was socially acceptable. No ostracism.",
        "A: And it really is a big change inthis country from the antisemitism that existed at\nthat time to the pretty much total acceptance that exists now.",
        "Q: Do you remember when you felt that change happen or was itreally gradual?",
        "A: No, it was gradual. And, to be honest with you, I never felt particularly Jewish.\nThe only reason that I would tell people that Iwas Jewish is that I felt to explain\nwhat the Germans did and that I wasn't ashamed of being Jewish. But most of my\nlife nobody asked, and I was always blond and not particularly looking of any kind\nof -- so that 1t never -- in many years it was never mentioned. I mean, and the fact\nthat we were not religious, of course, made abig difference.",
        "Q: Well, you anticipated one of my questions, which was did what you experience,\nyou know, being Jewish whether, whatever relationship you would have to it, the\noutside world in Germany certainly, you know, shaped your destiny.",
        "A: Absolutely, yeah.",
        "Q: And I wondered whether or not you felt more interested in Judaism as a result,\nwhere you may not have been.",
        "A: Not really.",
        "Q: Not really?",
        "A: My parents were, I guess what was called then free thinkers and had absolutely\nno religious -- I mean, I don't think I ever heard them talk about God or any kind of\nreligion. And it wasn't until the Nazis that the Jews became arace, you know. And\nso that when I grew up it was areligion. And since we weren't religious, then it didn't\nplay any part in my life really.",
        "Q: Are there other things that you think are important for someone to know about\nyour early years here inthe US as a young teenager going to the school, meeting\nAmerican kids, being exposed to this different environment?",
        "A: When you're young enough you adopt very quickly. I guess Iwas 13 or 14 when\nIcame here, and really adopted very fast to -- and of course we all wanted to adopt\nto the American. I remember that we made a point of speaking English and not\nsomehow standing out as immigrants.",
        "Q: What kind of contact did your parents have with the relatives who stayed behind\nin Germany?",
        "A: We had very few relatives that left behind in Germany. As I said, my mother's\nmother died at Theresienstadt. There were -- my mother's brother and his wife fled\nthe Nazis in Austria, and then in Czechoslovakia, and they went to Romania, and then\ndecided they weren't going torun anymore and killed themselves. They had two\nadolescent children, two boys, who somehow made their way. One of them came to\nthis country as a -- he was kind ofa language genius and became a professor at\n\u2019Broome? The other one had avery -- he went from -- he went to England during\nthe war, joined the Czech Air Force, got shot down over Italy, spent two years in\nacamp, went back to Czechoslovakia after the war, got caught by the\nCommunists.",
        "Q: Oh, my God.",
        "A: Who were suspicious of him because he had served in the Czech Air Force. With\nthe help of Eleanor Roosevelt, Sinclair Lewis, Dorothy Thompson, various other\npeople, we got him out of Czechoslovakia, and he taught at my school for the next\n15 years.",
        "Q: Amazing. And what was his name?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: ?Getivena?.",
        "Q: ?Getivena??",
        "A: Yeah. I think he wrote a book or somebody wrote a book about his very difficult\nlife.",
        "Q: It certainly sounds that way. When he was shot down in Italy, he was in an Italian\nprisoner of war camp?",
        "A: He was in an Italian prison of war camp.",
        "Q: Which is probably why he survived tt.",
        "A: That probably was alot better than a German prisoner of war camp.",
        "Q: What did you study at Swarthmore? What would you graduate in?",
        "A: European History.",
        "Q: Okay. So your bachelor's --",
        "A: Modern History.",
        "Q: So your bachelor's and your master's were in gold subjects?",
        "A: Yeah. I wrote a-- my master thesis was about the Yalta Conference.",
        "Q: Oh, really. How interesting. How interesting for lots of reasons. Why did you\nchoose that? Why did you choose modern European history?",
        "A: Well, I guess I was very interested in what was going on in the world. I had\nspent, oh, four years inthe Army, and that made it even more important for me to\nknow what was going on. Atone point I had wanted to teach modern history, but --",
        "Q: Okay. Now, I'm alittle bit confused by chronological. You arrive in 1938. Let's\nsay, between '38 and '39, you get settled from New York to Windsor, Vermont. At\nthat point it's 1939, World War II happens, Poland is invaded. Your parents set up\nthe school in Vermont. For two years to go to alocal school, and then you finish\nyour high school in, at your own parents' school.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: That would be what year?",
        "A: Probably '42 or'43 somewhere around there.",
        "Q: Okay. So your college life is post-war?",
        "A: Well, Ihad one year in college before I joined the Army.",
        "Q: And that was at the Wagner College?",
        "A: First, Iwas half a year at Wagner College and the other half at Swarthmore.",
        "Q: I see. That's was the bridge I wanted to come to. So you have that half year at\nWagner. You transfer to Swarthmore. Why don't you finish the college, the full four\nyears at Swarthmore?",
        "A: I did.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: At once? No, you interrupted it.",
        "A: I interrupted it. I had three and ahalf years, four years inthe Army, and then I\nwent back to Swarthmore.",
        "Q: Okay. Why did you interrupt it? Was it your choice?",
        "A: Iwas 18, and I loved skiing, and somebody told me if you join the mountain\ntroops you'll do alot of skiing. So I volunteered for the mountain troops, which were\nin a terrible place called Camphill, Colorado, and I spent about eight months there\nuntil I was transferred. I suddenly got orders to transfer to Camp Ritchie.",
        "Q: Tell me, tell mea little bit about those eight months in Colorado. Why was it\nterrible?",
        "A: It was cold. The Army had just started to train mountain troops and didn't really\nknow what they were doing. The camp itself had probably 100 wood stoves, which\ngave everybody which stayed -- the smoke stayed in\nthe camp, and we all got rheumatism and various bumps and bruises and --",
        "Q: So it was cold and not well heated, not efficiently heated?",
        "A: Each barrack had a stove atthe end that spewed out, was a wood stove, and was\nnot very warm inthe barracks, and we never did any skiing. We hiked a lot with\nbackpacks, and I was very glad to get out of there.",
        "Q: What I remember from my reading of the US military forces in World War II is\nthat before it had been much more ofa professional army, and World War II\nbrought in civilians, and in many ways was a great leveler, or people from totally\ndifferent backgrounds were thrown together.",
        "A: That's correct.",
        "Q: Did you experience that?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. When I first went to the mountain troops, for instance, most of the\npeople were college guys who, people who had started college, wood skiers, and\nvolunteers, and then they didn't get enough people. And they started send draftees,\nfor instance, from Georgia and various other southern states who were absolutely\ntotally miserable. I can remember that this one guy, he was a sharp shooter and\nwas very proud of it, but it was socold that you had to wear gloves, and he refused\nto wear gloves, and his hands kept freezing to the trigger, and we tried to explain it to\nhim. But eventually he went to the hospital because he had, was just one of those --",
        "Q: It's a detail, but it ends up being very crucial for somebody who was a sharp\nshooter.",
        "A: That's right. And he couldn't do it without gloves, and he didn't feel he could.",
        "Q: Were you the only one who came from Germany who was in that mountain\ncamp?",
        "A: I don't know.",
        "Q: Did you guys talk much about with one another? Did you get to know one\nanother very well?",
        "A: Oh, we got to know each other, but at that time I spoke perfect English. And in\nthose days the Army didn't want any noncitizens.",
        "Q: Were you a citizen by that time?",
        "A: No, I became a citizen of Leadville, Colorado, which was right near the camp.\nAnd I was -- I guess I was 18 or 19 when I became a citizen.",
        "Q: Did it mean something?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Did it mean something when that happened?",
        "A: I'd been living inthe United States for a while, and being inthe Army, it was\nnice to be acitizen, but it wasn't a terribly big thing.",
        "Q: And now you say Camp Ritchie happened. It sounds like that transfer sort of fell\nfrom the sky.",
        "A: Yes, it did.",
        "Q: So someone in the Army must have known your background.",
        "A: Somebody found out I'm sure, and there were -- when I talked to the people at\nRitchie, there were alot of people like that. SoIwas younger than most because\nmany of the German emigrees were older when they came to this country. They also\nwere suddenly called out. Somebody in their service records found that they spoke\nGerman or French, and so we got transferred to Ritchie.",
        "Q: So now where in Ritchie. Tell us what Ritchie was, where it was.",
        "A: Ritchie --",
        "Q: As much detail as you can.",
        "A: Ritchie was avery strange camp. It was near Baltimore. Actually, it was in the\nCatoctin Mountains, and almost everybody had a different mother tongue than\nEnglish. Many of the people were older than I was. And it was -- we learned how to\ninterrogate prisoners of war.",
        "Q: Well, if you could walk me through a few, some of the details. Do you remember\nwhat it was like when you got there? Who you first talked to, some of the\nofficials, how they put in one place rather than another place?",
        "A: All right. I don't really remember much of that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It's 50 years ago.",
        "Q: I know.",
        "A: Ritchie was more comfortable than the --",
        "Q: Colorado?",
        "A: Colorado. And it was strange because people either spoke French or German or\nJapanese, and there was relatively rigorous training in how to interrogate people, what\nnot todo, for instance. In the three years that I interrogated people, I never touched\na German prisoner, even when I interrogated a concentration camp guard that you\nwanted to rip apart with your hands, we never touched them, and I don't think any\nof the other interrogators ever touched German prisoners.",
        "Q: So that was something that you learned very early on? That was one of the\nrules?",
        "A: Absolute rules. Don't touch. You can play whatever intellectual trick you want\nto play on them to make them talk, but you can't touch them.",
        "Q: Can you remember anything else about that training, how to become an\ninterrogator, a prisoner of war interrogator?",
        "A: There are two things: You had to learn the makeup of the German army, what\ndivisions, who was commander, what division, and so on. And they were very strict\nabout not torturing anybody ever. Ican show you a picture of --",
        "Q: Sure. I'd love to see it.",
        "A: -- to prove that Iwas young once.",
        "Q: {Laughter}",
        "A: That's me.",
        "Q: Where? Which one?",
        "A: (Indicating)",
        "Q: Oh, my.",
        "A: These are German prisoners.",
        "Q: So this 1s when you're already over in Europe?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Yes.",
        "Q: Now, when you -- okay, so the training lasted how long?",
        "A: Eight weeks.",
        "Q: And what kind of -- do you remember what kind ofa feeling you got there?\nWere you -- were you enthusiastic about this assignment? Did you feel it had some\nparticular meaning?",
        "A: I thought that I was going to be able to do more --I felt very strongly, having\ncome from Germany, that it was all -- our views were passivists, that I couldn't let\nother people do it for me because it didn't, didn't seem right at the time. So, as I said,\nI volunteered. Once we were finished with Ritchey, we were assigned to various\ndivisions as a team. I was inthe 79th Division and stayed with the 79th Division all\nthe way through Europe. You can see where we went somewhere here.",
        "Q: Okay. Socan you tell mea little bit about --",
        "A: See.",
        "Q: Okay. You were -- it looks here on this map that youcome from the English\nChannel through France.",
        "A: We came through the English Channel. We landed in Normandy.",
        "Q: On D-Day?",
        "A: D plus 18 hours. So it was close.",
        "Q: So was it not even a full day after the first landing?",
        "A: No, that's right.",
        "Q: Can you tell me what you saw when you --",
        "A: A lot of dead people. And I'd never seen dead people before in my life, so --",
        "Q: I can't imagine what the feeling -- I would have been scared out of my wits.",
        "A: Iwas. Iwas. Two things. Two things that I remember very well is crossing the\nchannel. I was extremely seasick. It was small boats, a small flat-bottom boat, and I\ncan remember that somebody said there's an German plane that's going to attack us. I\nsaid, \"Okay. I hope it hits us.\" I was so seasick, so --\n{Laughter by both}",
        "Q: Did you know that you were part of this invasion of Europe?",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "Q: When did they tell you?",
        "A: We -- because I was an interrogator by that time, we were informed probably three\nweeks before the landing what day the landing would be and where we would be\nlanding. Of course, we weren't allowed to stick our nose out of the camp after that --",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: -- and it was heavily surrounded. It was in, I think it was in South Hampton. And\nso we knew. And actually the landing was supposed to be a day earlier than the 6th\nof June, and --",
        "Q: Hang on just a second.\n{interview interrupted}\nwe were talking about, about the landing at Normandy and when you learnt of it and\nhow the camp was closed afterwards, presumably to prevent news of this leaking out,\nand I interrupted you inthe middle of you telling me.",
        "A: What was I saying? Do you know?",
        "Q: I think it was something about the boat going over.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Iwas very sea sick onthe boat, and the landing itself was kind of\ntraumatic because I had never seen alot of dead people, and there were alot of dead\nAmericans, either in the water or on the beach, and that was the beginning of about\na year and ahalf of warfare.",
        "Q: What happened to you? What were your experiences?",
        "A: What were the experiences?",
        "Q: Yeah, after you landed. What happened next?",
        "A: Oh, we were very busy. The idea was that German prisoners would talk best if\nyou talked to them within ten minutes of their capture 'cause they were\npsychologically still traumatized. So we were very close to the front lines always, and\nwe started right away interrogating prisoners.",
        "Q: So you didn't face combat? Even though you were close to the front lines, you\nweren't involved in combat?",
        "A: Not actually. | Wealways carried guns and occasionally somebody was shooting\nat us, and we would shoot back, but we were not combat soldiers.",
        "Q: Do you remember the very first person you interrogated?",
        "A: No. I ended up interrogating probably, oh, two or three thousand people over the\nnext two years.",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness.",
        "A: Sol don't remember them too well. Ican remember that if somebody didn't want\nto tell me what I wanted to know, I would say, well, see that solider at the door.\nHe's from Poland. He just lost his parents in Poland. Would you rather talk to him\nor to me? And they usually would rather talk to me.",
        "Q: Do you have a memorable interrogation, you know, somebody who, you know,\nfrom those 2,000 that you would have interrogated?",
        "A:T have to admit that I had pretty strong feelings about the Germans, and\nparticularly ranking officers. I remember probably -- there was nobody who was really\nexciting. There was one general who knew the division commander of the division I\nwas in. They had somehow gotten together, and he was very upset by the fact that\nI treated him like everybody else. And the general came down to say hello to him,\nbut we didn't treat him any better than anybody else.",
        "Q: What can you tell us about those interrogations?",
        "A: About what?",
        "Q: About the interrogations, about -- you mentioned that your own feelings were\npretty strong.",
        "A: Well, where I was, the information we were looking for was usually pretty simple,\nlike, what division are you from, what orders did you have to attack, where were\nyou supposed to attack, how many people were there. I mean, they were all very\ndirect questions connected to the tactical situation.",
        "Q: Military questions?",
        "A: Military questions.",
        "Q: Do you remember the place where you had your first interrogation? Was it in\nFrance?",
        "A: It was in France, yeah.",
        "Q: Was it close to Normandy? Was it in Normandy?",
        "A: It was probably in Normandy, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, did you meet any soldiers your own age?",
        "A: German soldiers?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. The Germans by that time had lost alot of people onthe Russian\nfront, and they were drafting 17, 16, sometimes 15 year olds into the Army. So\nthere were alot of people younger than I was. One of the things that we did as an\ninterpreter -- as an interrogator, we were very conscious that the Germans were rank\nconscious. And I was allowed to wear any kind of button up to Major, which on an\n18-year-old was a little iffy, of course, and we finally settled in the end of wearing US\nbuttons that just said US on the shirt. It did allow me to go eat in the officers' mess\noccasionally.",
        "Q: But you say it was because the Germans were rank conscious that you were\nallowed to wear these buttons. Did that mean that -- did that mean that in the\ninterrogation situation somebody who would have been higher ranking than you sees\nthis button and then is more likely --",
        "A: More likely to talk. The US button sort of represented some kind of a special\ntroops to the Germans so that -- but there were Germans when I first started, and it\nwas acorporal who said they wouldn't talk to a corporal; get me a lieutenant; I will\ntalk to him.",
        "Q: Did they know that you were Jewish?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Was there any time inthe interrogation that you would reveal anything about\nyourself?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you, did you ever interrogate anybody who was close to where you had\ncome from, from Gunderstein or \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, not really. I once interrogated somebody who had been atthe school in\nGermany.",
        "Q: You're kidding?",
        "A: And -- but that was about as close asI got to --",
        "Q: And did they talk about your parents?",
        "A: They asked about my parents.",
        "Q: So they knew who you were?",
        "A: I explained to them who I was.",
        "Q: Were your feelings any different to the 15 and 16 year old than to the higher\nranking officers?",
        "A: Not really. They were all Germans to me.",
        "Q: When did the conversation or the interrogation ever touch on what the\nconcentration camps were about?",
        "A: Most of these people didn't know very much. They knew they existed, but I did,\nafter the war, spend ashort time at Dachau interrogating guards and people there,\nand it looked just like those pictures that you've seen.",
        "Q: Sois that what you were referring to earlier when you said you couldn't touch\nanybody, even if he had been a\ncamp guard and you would have wanted to tear him apart?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So this was from Dachau?",
        "A: That's right.",
        "Q: Do you remember the names of the persons THAT you interrogated?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Do you remember the name of any of these people?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. Do you remember what they were like, the kind of demeanor they had?",
        "A: Very different, you know. Hundreds of them. Some were arrogant Nazis; some\nwere country boys who didn't know any political consequences; some were old-time\nArmy guys who would follow orders no matter what. So it was a great deal of\ndifference. Towards the end of war, asI said, they were 16, 17 year olds.",
        "Q: Did this change you?",
        "A: The war?",
        "Q: The experience of having been an interrogator.",
        "A: I think that the war probably changed me, yes. Maybe I grew up a lot quicker\nthan I would have otherwise.",
        "Q: What do you mean by that?",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What did they think of it?",
        "A: They were mostly worried about whether I was going to get hurt or not.

        "Q: Oh, my.",
        "A: I thought [had one, but maybe I don't. These were e-mails.",

        "A: That was the original size, but it was sent this size, in that size.",
        "Q: And this is almost like a quarter of an 8 1/2 by 11 piece of paper. And this is an\nexample of that.",

        "A: I got a Purple Heart, which I didn't pick up until atthe end of the war. People\nwould -- you had to have acertain number of points to get discharged, and Purple\nHeart would get you five points, so I made sure that this is -- I made sure that I had\nthis letter to get my five points so that --",
        "Q: So you could get discharged?",
        "A: --I could get discharged. But I spent almost a year after the end of the war in\nmilitary government in Germany.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the only people we could find were people that had been in concentration\ncamps, and they were often notreally ready torun acity, or something like that, so\nit was difficult.",

        "A: We moved around. This was --",
        "Q: This was the route?",
        "A: This was after the war.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, that was after the war.",
        "A: And we moved around from place to place, and most of the time we went back\nhere and set up military governments in this area.",
        "Q: Okay. So that what were talking about is Recklinghausen, Mannheim, Winterberg --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: That's where the military governments were set up. That's after the war. And\nthen the 79th went from those places to Alsfeld, Eisenach, Meiningen, Eisfeld,\n\u2019Sonnebauch?, ?Holf?, Ash, and then Frankenberg. And it was inthis part of\nGermany that you did -- conducted those interrogations, is that correct?",
        "A: Well, the interrogation was conducted all the way along anytime there was a, the\ndivision took a prisoner, we would interrogate them.",
        "Q: Okay. So that's through France, through Northern France, Belguim, down towards\nStrasbourg, back up to Battle of the Bulge?",
        "A: Right, and then into Germany.",
        "Q: And the Battle of the Bulge, was that where you were wounded?",
        "A: No, actually, it was earlier. It was in July somewhere. I had a letter in here. What\ndid I do with it?",
        "Q: There's some letters in here, yes.",
        "A: That said where I was wounded. Maybe not. There it 1s.",
        "Q: Yeah. I certify that I was present when Tech IV, Eric H. Bondy, was wounded in\naction on July 11th, 1944, in Normandy. In Normandy. So it was very soon after\nlanding. That he was treated in an American evacuation hospital, and the medical\ndoctor in charge authorized the Purple Heart was to be issued to this solider. And it's\nsigned by Richard H --",
        "A: Pepi (ph).",
        "Q: Pepi. So this was very quickly. Do you remember anything from that incident?",
        "A: I remember that I went to the, to some kind of Army hospital, and they sewed it\nup and put a bandage on it and told me to go back.\n{Laughter}",
        "Q: You mentioned that you had come into contact with concentration camp\nsurvivors. | Do you remember the first time you saw any concentration camp\nsurvivors after liberation?",
        "A: It was at Dachau after the war.",
        "Q: How much after the war?",

        "Q: Do you have memories of that? Do you have --",
        "A: Of course, yes.",
        "Q: What can you tell us about it.",
        "A: AsI said, it looked just like the photographs you have seen, alot of dead people\naround, piles of clothing.",
        "Q: How did you get into Dachau?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: How did you -- tell us how you got there, what took to you to Dachau? Why\nwere you sent there?",
        "A: My division was stationed near Dachau, and they needed somebody to help\ninterrogate the guards.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Soland another interrogator was sent over there to interrogate the guards and\nmake some recommendation what to do with them.",
        "Q: And there was still survivors of the camp inthe camp?",
        "A: There was some still there, yes.",
        "Q: Did you speak with them?",
        "A: Yes. But --",
        "Q: Did they say anything about those guards?",
        "A: About what?",
        "Q: About the guards you were going to interrogate?",
        "A: Yeah, I asked them about the guards, and they said some were good; some were\nbad, so -- but they were in pretty bad shape. I mean, by the end of the war the\nGermans were running out of food, and of course they didn't give any food to the\ncamps, so that many of them were really very badly starved.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So that -- and then Ican remember that I went around and told all the soldiers\nthat were inthe camp don't give them too much food; it will kill them. It will kill\nthem. Don't give them. They used to hand them chocolate, which of course was\nterrible for them, and --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I remember that pretty vividly, trying to tell them. Most Americans soldiers\nwere very generous that way and wanted to feed them and give them whatever they\nhad. But it was just very bad for them since they had been starving and --",
        "Q: How long did you stay in Dachau?",
        "A: Six days, I think.",
        "Q: And do you remember approximately how many guards you interrogated. I know\nit's atough question.",
        "A: Oh, I'm not sure. Maybe 20, 25, 30 of them.",
        "Q: These people that you mentioned before --",
        "A: Well, they were usually SS guards at the -- there were some -- I guess by the\nend of the war they had some guards from Latvia and various other occupied\ncountries who swore up and down that they weren't SS, of course, but they were\nLatvian SS or Bastognian SS, but they were --",
        "Q: That's interesting?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: That's interesting. Was their demeanor any different than the German guards?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Nix SS Latvian.",
        "Q: And had any ofthe prisoners identified them --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- as being particularly cruel or particularly good or --",
        "A: Not particularly good. Nobody was ever particularly good. They did point out\nsome who were particularly cruel, but alot of them were just guards.",
        "Q: Oh, [had another question, and I just lost it. When you -- going back to the\nprocess of interrogation. After you completed an interrogation, what did you do? Did\nyou have to write it up and pass it in?",
        "A: We wrote it up and passed it to the, either the regimental or division commander,\ndepending on who we were working for at the time.",
        "Q: And the questions I would assume must have changed by the time you got to\nthose camps?",
        "A: Oh, during the war the questions were all tactical. After the war, we were\nlooking for war crimes and, of course, we had arrested, oh, alot of sort of Nazis\nwith arank around Mayia (ph). And then General Patton decided that the Nazis\nwere just like Republicans and Democrats, and we should let them all go.",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness. And did that happen?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That must have been galling.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: That must have been galling.",
        "A: Yes, it was. And I will admit that most of the people I was with cheered when\nthey heard that Patton was killed.",
        "Q: What else could you tell us about that experience of having interrogated so many\npeople?",
        "A: You know, it's like any other job, after a while --",
        "Q: It becomes routine.",
        "A: -- it becomes routine. And paid special attention to people who might have been\nwar criminals, but the general run-of-the-mill solider, it got to be routine, and you\npretty much asked the same thing over and over again.",
        "Q: Did you catch any people who were, you know, high-ranking who were war\ncriminals?",
        "A: Occasionally, there were some high ranking SS people who were trying to hide,\nbut usually when that happened we would turn them over to higher authorities.",
        "Q: The Ritchie Boys, how many -- when you were with the 79th Division, were\nthey scattered all over amongst various divisions?",
        "A: The Ritchie Boys were divided into teams -- one lieutenant, one sergeant, and one\ncorporal.",
        "Q: And you were part of such a team?",
        "A: And I was the corporal on one of the teams. And each division would be getting\none of these teams.",
        "Q: What was your -- what was your interaction with one another? Were you all --\ndid you have --",
        "A: We were always together for a whole year, so two years. Slept in the same place,\nand probably got on each others nerves, so --",
        "Q: Were they also, your team members were they also from Germany? Did they\nhave a similar background?",
        "A: The lieutenant was from Milwaukee. At the time the Army did not want\nGerman refugees or recent refugees from Germany being officers in the Army, so that\nthe lieutenants in the office were usually German speaking or poorly German\nspeaking from places like Milwaukee and the other German --",
        "Q: Midwest?",
        "A: -- or New York, 86th Street, wherever that 1s.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: But the enlisted men were usually the refugees. But they were all -- many of the\nrefugees would come from Germany were older than I was. They were 36, 35. I\nremember that the person I was with, the other sergeant was about 35 at the time.",
        "Q: Oh, yeah, I forgot for a minute as you were talking and as we were going\nthrough the military process, you were basically a kid?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: You're basically a kid still.",
        "A: Yes. I was\u2014I got in the Army when I was 18, and I guess I got out when I was 22.",
        "Q: When you leave Germany -- by the one way, one last question on this. Do you\nremember the name of your teammates, you know, the corporal and the lieutenant?",
        "A: I knew it about a month ago and then I've forgotten. I was at a Ritchie Boy\nreunion, and I guess both of those guys were dead because nobody knew anything\nabout them, but I can't remember it now.",
        "Q: Were you part of the film that was made about Ritchie Boys awhile ago?",
        "A: No.",

        "Q: Let me go then to the end of the war. You -- you leave in 1946?",
        "A: 1945, yeah.",
        "Q: Were you glad to get out of Germany\u201d?",
        "A: Yes. I was glad to get out of the Army. In fact, I made the mistake of throwing\neverything away.",
        "Q: In general had it been, aside from the war interrogation --",
        "A: Well, I didn't like and don't like the Army system of taking orders from -- you\nknow, you take an order from the next higher up, and very often the people who\ngave the orders didn't know as much as the people who took them.",
        "Q: {Laughter} That's a common frustration.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When you came back to the states, where did you go?",
        "A: By that time my parents had a school in Manchester, Vermont. I very quickly\nreturned to college and went to Swarthmore and spent the next three and a half\nyears there.",
        "Q: Did you tell them about what some of your experiences were?",
        "A: I probably didn't talk about the war for 30 years.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about that. Because in the questionnaire that was sent back it\nwas indicated that you had never been interviewed at all?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So that to me tells of a certain reticence.",
        "A: Well, I certainly didn't volunteer to be interviewed, and it was just something so\ndifferent from what anybody else had experienced, except an veteran, that I just didn't\nwant to talk about it, and then maybe after 30 years I started talking about it.",
        "Q: To whom?",
        "A: I guess my wife and my parents.",
        "Q: Is she -- does she also -- does she have a similar history to your own?",

        "Q: Did any of the younger generations then come to you and say tell us about what\nhappened?",
        "A: My youngest son got interested in what I did during the war, maybe ten years\nago. But you can't blame them. I never talked about it, and --",

        "Q: {Laughter}",
        "Q: Well, you know, one interview can never capture everything, and I still have a\nlot of questions about, about the whole experience, the details, the training at Camp\nRitchie and, you know, those experiences, but at the same time I realize I'm asking\nthese so many decades later, and it's hard to remember.",
        "A: It's very hard to remember, and particularly the war. Sometimes I don't know\nwhether I've seen it inthe movies or whether I've really experienced it because it's so\nlong ago.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, that's one of the -- that's one of the challenges that we face\nwhen we conduct these interviews --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- is that we know that so much time has passed, and so much more is known\nnow than was known atthe time. But this looks like avery interesting book, the\none of the 79th Division. Have you had many reunions that you've gone to?",

        "Q: That's young, but would it -- young for the question I'm going to ask, but do\nyou remember your parents having discussions about the Nazis coming to power?",
        "Q: What was the tone of those discussions? Did they talk amongst themselves or did\nthey talk to you about them?",
        "Q: Do you remember how your sisters reacted? Did you talk amongst the siblings\nabout this?",
        "Q: So she was a teenager.",
        "Q: What were the other kids in the school like when the Nazis came to power? Did\nyou feel that inthe classroom?",
        "Q: You said this was a private school?",
        "Q: Okay. And it was largely funded by the money your grandfather had earned?",
        "Q: Yeah. And you said he died before his --",
        "Q: Let's back up a little bit later. I didn't realize you knew him. What kind of\nrelationship did you have with your grandfather?",
        "Q: Your maternal grandfather?",
        "Q: Your grandparents, Your step-grandfather and your grandmother?",
        "Q: Was it Dupont?",
        "Q: Was it Dupont? Was it Dupont?",
        "Q: Okay. Let's go back then to when your parents become increasingly concerned\nabout that the Nazis have come. Your father thinks it's passing. Your mother\nthinks, no, they're going to be here for a while. How did things evolve? How did\nthey develop at the school and in your parents' plans?",
        "Q: G-L-O-N?",
        "Q: Gland. Okay.",
        "Q: I'm alittle bit confused by the dates.",
        "Q: All right. Do you remember anything about your leaving Gunderstein? Do you\nremember any details about when you left or how you left?",
        "Q: No, I meant when you left Germany to go --",
        "Q: Did you go by car?",
        "Q: Did you go by car?",
        "Q: {Laughter}",
        "Q: What I'm interested in is the detail of leaving Germany. Why would it have been\nthree cars?",
        "Q: Larger group?",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t three cars in a row?",
        "Q: Were you and your parents and sisters in one car or were you split across the\nthree?",
        "Q: And were you concerned? Do you remember if you were concerned about\nwhether they'll make it?",
        "Q: Did your parents have assets?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: So they had inherited money, but did they have a house of their own? Did they\nhave a building?",
        "Q: Okay. And while you were in Switzerland was there discussion of what was\ngoing on in Germany?",
        "Q: Had those students come from your school, your parents' schools, the ones --",
        "Q: And one question that kind of goes back a little bit: Your mother, as a\npsychoanalyst, did she have her own practice?",
        "Q: She never practiced?",
        "Q: Individually?",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. 1938, why would your parents decide to leave Switzerland? It was a\nsafe country.",
        "Q: I see. Isee. So for all those reasons -- so that when you left, do you remember\nleaving Switzerland?",
        "Q: How did you leave?",
        "Q: Did you speak French at the time?",
        "Q: And who was on this trip? Was it just your parents and sisters at this point?",
        "Q: And your sister's fianc\u00e9?",
        "Q: Going back to when you were still in Germany and then also in Switzerland, your\nschool had non-Jewish kids in it?",
        "Q: But was your social life confined to the people in the school? Did you have any\nother contact with Germans, non-Jewish Germans outside of the school?",
        "Q: By the time you leave Europe you're in France --",
        "Q: Switzerland. And then you go to France. And then --",
        "Q: Did you feel German anymore?",
        "Q: Your language, you know, how you spoke with your parents.",
        "Q: German. Until the end?",
        "Q: Well, Imean, the value of having another language in the house is the kids never\nunderstand what you're saying. And sometimes that's important. Where did you come\nto the United States? Where did you arrive, and where did you settle and why?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Do you remember the name?",
        "Q: Do you remember where?",
        "Q: That's okay. Do you want some water?",
        "Q: Was this in Manhattan?",
        "Q: Was this in Manhattan?",
        "Q: It was Manhattan.",
        "Q: Aah,",
        "Q: And how did they come to choose Vermont as the place to have the school?",
        "Q: To Lenox, Massachusetts? That's quite a change. I mean, it's quite a change from\ncity life in New York to, I assume, town life in Vermont.",
        "Q: So it didn't feel like much of a change?",
        "Q: What do you remember, and what can you tell and describe about those years\nright after you came, from 1938 through, through -- we'll come to the time when\nyou become a Ritchie Boy. But, you know, you're a teenager now, and you have\nAmerican society.",
        "Q: I think much better than Wagner College.",
        "Q: What was your degree in?",
        "Q: Asa kid, well, sort of a young teenager adolescent coming to American, do you\nremember your first impressions of what this place was like, what the people were\nlike, what society was like?",
        "Q: But before then you were inthis school which wasn't successful for you.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "Q: Was it strict?",
        "Q: Could be very lonely.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: You mentioned that your parents had the friend in Vermont who was a well\nknown writer. Did they have acircle of people already in the United States that\nwere part of a social circle?",
        "Q: Well, it's unusual in many ways because most people who came inthe United\nStates didn't have such acircle, and it suggests that -- I don't mean the term in any\nnegative way -- but anelite kind of social circle thathad come from Europe.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: You felt it?",
        "Q: Well, the question I would have would be, did you remember instances where\nyou could see it? You know, things like that are very hard --",
        "Q: They would say such things?",
        "Q: They would say such things, using those words?",
        "Q: Yeah, something that at that time was socially acceptable. No ostracism.",
        "Q: Do you remember when you felt that change happen or was itreally gradual?",
        "Q: Well, you anticipated one of my questions, which was did what you experience,\nyou know, being Jewish whether, whatever relationship you would have to it, the\noutside world in Germany certainly, you know, shaped your destiny.",
        "Q: And I wondered whether or not you felt more interested in Judaism as a result,\nwhere you may not have been.",
        "Q: Not really?",
        "Q: Are there other things that you think are important for someone to know about\nyour early years here inthe US as a young teenager going to the school, meeting\nAmerican kids, being exposed to this different environment?",
        "Q: What kind of contact did your parents have with the relatives who stayed behind\nin Germany?",
        "Q: Oh, my God.",
        "Q: Amazing. And what was his name?",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "Q: ?Getivena??",
        "Q: It certainly sounds that way. When he was shot down in Italy, he was in an Italian\nprisoner of war camp?",
        "Q: Which is probably why he survived tt.",
        "Q: What did you study at Swarthmore? What would you graduate in?",
        "Q: Okay. So your bachelor's --",
        "Q: So your bachelor's and your master's were in gold subjects?",
        "Q: Oh, really. How interesting. How interesting for lots of reasons. Why did you\nchoose that? Why did you choose modern European history?",
        "Q: Okay. Now, I'm alittle bit confused by chronological. You arrive in 1938. Let's\nsay, between '38 and '39, you get settled from New York to Windsor, Vermont. At\nthat point it's 1939, World War II happens, Poland is invaded. Your parents set up",
        "Q: That would be what year?",
        "Q: Okay. So your college life is post-war?",
        "Q: And that was at the Wagner College?",
        "Q: I see. That's was the bridge I wanted to come to. So you have that half year at\nWagner. You transfer to Swarthmore. Why don't you finish the college, the full four\nyears at Swarthmore?",
        "Q: You did?",
        "Q: At once? No, you interrupted it.",
        "Q: Okay. Why did you interrupt it? Was it your choice?",
        "Q: Tell me, tell mea little bit about those eight months in Colorado. Why was it\nterrible?",
        "Q: So it was cold and not well heated, not efficiently heated?",
        "Q: What I remember from my reading of the US military forces in World War II is\nthat before it had been much more ofa professional army, and World War II\nbrought in civilians, and in many ways was a great leveler, or people from totally\ndifferent backgrounds were thrown together.",
        "Q: Did you experience that?",
        "Q: It's a detail, but it ends up being very crucial for somebody who was a sharp\nshooter.",
        "Q: Were you the only one who came from Germany who was in that mountain\ncamp?",
        "Q: Did you guys talk much about with one another? Did you get to know one\nanother very well?",
        "Q: Were you a citizen by that time?",
        "Q: Did it mean something?",
        "Q: Did it mean something when that happened?",
        "Q: And now you say Camp Ritchie happened. It sounds like that transfer sort of fell\nfrom the sky.",
        "Q: So someone in the Army must have known your background.",
        "Q: So now where in Ritchie. Tell us what Ritchie was, where it was.",
        "Q: As much detail as you can.",
        "Q: Well, if you could walk me through a few, some of the details. Do you remember\nwhat it was like when you got there? Who you first talked to, some of the\nofficials, how they put in one place rather than another place?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: I know.",
        "Q: Colorado?",
        "Q: So that was something that you learned very early on? That was one of the\nrules?",
        "Q: Can you remember anything else about that training, how to become an\ninterrogator, a prisoner of war interrogator?",
        "Q: Sure. I'd love to see it.",
        "Q: {Laughter}",
        "Q: Where? Which one?",
        "Q: Oh, my.",
        "Q: So this 1s when you're already over in Europe?",
        "Q: Now, when you -- okay, so the training lasted how long?",
        "Q: And what kind of -- do you remember what kind ofa feeling you got there?\nWere you -- were you enthusiastic about this assignment? Did you feel it had some\nparticular meaning?",
        "Q: Okay. Socan you tell mea little bit about --",
        "Q: Okay. You were -- it looks here on this map that youcome from the English\nChannel through France.",
        "Q: On D-Day?",
        "Q: So was it not even a full day after the first landing?",
        "Q: Can you tell me what you saw when you --",
        "Q: I can't imagine what the feeling -- I would have been scared out of my wits.",
        "Q: Did you know that you were part of this invasion of Europe?",
        "Q: When did they tell you?",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "Q: Hang on just a second.",
        "Q: I think it was something about the boat going over.",
        "Q: What happened to you? What were your experiences?",
        "Q: Yeah, after you landed. What happened next?",
        "Q: So you didn't face combat? Even though you were close to the front lines, you\nweren't involved in combat?",
        "Q: Do you remember the very first person you interrogated?",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness.",
        "Q: Do you have a memorable interrogation, you know, somebody who, you know,\nfrom those 2,000 that you would have interrogated?",
        "Q: What can you tell us about those interrogations?",
        "Q: About the interrogations, about -- you mentioned that your own feelings were\npretty strong.",
        "Q: Military questions?",
        "Q: Do you remember the place where you had your first interrogation? Was it in\nFrance?",
        "Q: Was it close to Normandy? Was it in Normandy?",
        "Q: Yeah, did you meet any soldiers your own age?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: But you say it was because the Germans were rank conscious that you were\nallowed to wear these buttons. Did that mean that -- did that mean that in the\ninterrogation situation somebody who would have been higher ranking than you sees\nthis button and then is more likely --",
        "Q: Did they know that you were Jewish?",
        "Q: Was there any time inthe interrogation that you would reveal anything about\nyourself?",
        "Q: Did you, did you ever interrogate anybody who was close to where you had\ncome from, from Gunderstein or \u2014",
        "Q: You're kidding?",
        "Q: And did they talk about your parents?",
        "Q: So they knew who you were?",
        "Q: Were your feelings any different to the 15 and 16 year old than to the higher\nranking officers?",
        "Q: When did the conversation or the interrogation ever touch on what the\nconcentration camps were about?",
        "Q: Sois that what you were referring to earlier when you said you couldn't touch\nanybody, even if he had been a\ncamp guard and you would have wanted to tear him apart?",
        "Q: So this was from Dachau?",
        "Q: Do you remember the names of the persons THAT you interrogated?",
        "Q: Do you remember the name of any of these people?",
        "Q: No. Do you remember what they were like, the kind of demeanor they had?",
        "Q: Did this change you?",

        "Q: What do you mean by that?",
        "Q: Did your parents know that this was your job?",
        "Q: What did they think of it?",
        "Q: Oh, my.",

        "Q: V-mails?",
        "Q: It says a V-mail, like Victor.",
        "Q: I see. And it's in English. And was it this size?",
        "Q: That was the original size?",
        "Q: And this is almost like a quarter of an 8 1/2 by 11 piece of paper. And this is an\nexample of that.",
        "Q: I see. That's very interesting. And you have some original documents as well. I see\nthere are --",
        "Q: -- about the school?",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness. And you got a Purple Heart?",
        "Q: So you could get discharged?",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: So this route that is described on this map of --",
        "Q: Can Iread some of the names?",
        "Q: All right. So this is the route of the 79th Infantry Division, and it looks like that\nit went from France, down to France to Loutenburg (ph), Luxembourg, Strasbourg.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, in Belgium?",
        "Q: Oh, yes. And there, and you get into Germany through ?Kothen?, through Essen,\nRecklinhausen --",
        "Q: -- Mannheim, Winterberg, Alsfeld, Eisenach, which was already East Germany after\nthe war, and then through --",
        "Q: -- to the Czech border, Felesenburg, which 1s already in Czechoslovakia?",
        "Q: So when you set up the military government, the 79th Infantry Division, you\nwanted to set up -- where were you based for that year? Were you in\nCzechoslovakia?",
        "Q: This was the route?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, that was after the war.",
        "Q: Okay. So that what were talking about is Recklinghausen, Mannheim, Winterberg --",
        "Q: That's where the military governments were set up. That's after the war. And\nthen the 79th went from those places to Alsfeld, Eisenach, Meiningen, Eisfeld,\n\u2019Sonnebauch?, ?Holf?, Ash, and then Frankenberg. And it was inthis part of\nGermany that you did -- conducted those interrogations, is that correct?",
        "Q: Okay. So that's through France, through Northern France, Belguim, down towards\nStrasbourg, back up to Battle of the Bulge?",
        "Q: And the Battle of the Bulge, was that where you were wounded?",
        "Q: There's some letters in here, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. I certify that I was present when Tech IV, Eric H. Bondy, was wounded in\naction on July 11th, 1944, in Normandy. In Normandy. So it was very soon after\nlanding. That he was treated in an American evacuation hospital, and the medical\ndoctor in charge authorized the Purple Heart was to be issued to this solider. And it's\nsigned by Richard H --",
        "Q: Pepi. So this was very quickly. Do you remember anything from that incident?",

        "Q: How much after the war?",
        "Q: Okay. So that would have been end of May. That would have been end of May\n'45?",

        "Q: And had any ofthe prisoners identified them --",
        "Q: -- as being particularly cruel or particularly good or --",
        "Q: Oh, [had another question, and I just lost it. When you -- going back to the\nprocess of interrogation. After you completed an interrogation, what did you do? Did\nyou have to write it up and pass it in?",
        "Q: And the questions I would assume must have changed by the time you got to\nthose camps?",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness. And did that happen?",
        "Q: That must have been galling.",
        "Q: That must have been galling.",
        "Q: What else could you tell us about that experience of having interrogated so many\npeople?",
        "Q: It becomes routine.",

        "Q: You're basically a kid still.",

        "Q: {Laughter} That's a common frustration.",
        "Q: When you came back to the states, where did you go?",
        "Q: Did you tell them about what some of your experiences were?",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about that. Because in the questionnaire that was sent back it\nwas indicated that you had never been interviewed at all?",

        "A: Oh, it's probably 60 miles from Hamburg.",
        "A: Northern Germany.",
        "A: I will start with my grandfather, my father's father, who started out as a Jewish\npeddler with atray around his neck selling stuff from it, and he walked from what\nis now Czechoslovakia to Hamburg and established an export/import business and got\nvery rich and very successful. Fortunately, he died before the Nazis could take\naway all his money and his houses. And it was really his money that provided my\nparents with the money to -- they were school people. They always had boarding\nschools. And they got the money from my grandfather to do it. My mother was one of\nthe very early physicians and became a psychoanalyst. She studied with Dr. Freud, and\nhe became friends of the family. I remember that his daughter, Anna Freud, was also a\npsychoanalyst, used to come and visit frequently and was aclose friend of my\nmother -- of my mother's. So that that's how -- then my father had a PhD in Art\nHistory, and they decided to go into education. They believed in what was then a\nvery novel idea and progressive idea that they would have a co-educational boarding\nschool. And as the school grew, they moved from one place tothe other until they\nfinally ended up in aplace called Mariendahl (ph), which was a large school, became\na large school. I went to school there with about 200 students, and the school still exists\nin --",
        "A: No, this is in -- it's also in Hamburg, but it's a different place. Gunderstein was the\nsecond school they had, and then Mariendahl was the third one. After that, of\ncourse, the Nazis came in 1933, and my parents were both Jewish, so it was clear\nthat this wasn't going to last very long, and for awhile the school continued\nbecause we had the Nazi minister of education's daughter in the school.",
        "A: So that --",
        "A: Her father's name was Kerrl, K-E-R-R-L. I don't remember her name. I was about\n10 or 12 at that time. And then my mother decided that the Nazis were going to be\nthere for along time. Well, my father thought they were just a passing problem. And\nwe prepared to go to Switzerland. And what is all this growling?",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Iwas a passionate soccer player, and I remember playing soccer in Germany. And\nonce the Nazis came in, they decided that Jewish kids couldn't play soccer. So my\nearliest, earliest memory is not being allowed to play soccer anymore, which was a\ngreat blow to me.",
        "A: {Laughter}",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: We were pretty close, but they were running a boarding school, which means that\nwe all lived in one big dormitory. They had an apartment at one end, and my sisters\nand I lived atthe other end ofthe corridor.",
        "A: And we had a pretty close relationship.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: It's hard to tell. He was avery pleasant person, had a lot of friends; very serious\nabout education. He was very much affected by his service in the first world war. He\nwas wounded in the first world war. I guess that's how he met my mother was\nstudying medicine in Vienna. And he was transferred, and at one point in order to be\nnear her joined what was called the Camel Corps, and I guess it was what is today\nPalestine. | Ofcourse, one of the problems that comes with being in a boarding\nschool is that you share your parents with alot of people. Of course, we didn't know\nany other -- any -- anything else. We had a Bavarian -- I guess she wasn't a nurse --\ncaretaker, who took care of us while they were busy. All I can remember about\nher is that she was extremely Catholic, while we were probably extremely\nnonreligious and, but she was very nice and stayed with us till we left.",
        "A: Excuse me?",
        "A: He was an artillery officer, but he very rarely talked about the war. He talked\nabout meeting my mother and things like that, but did not talk much about the war.",
        "A: One of his brothers was killed in the war.",
        "A: And the two other brothers, who were very successful. One was called Cacord\n(ph) who -- I don't know if you're interested in this -- who started a school in\nGermany for Jewish immigrants, prepare them for emigration. He was probably wrong\nbecause he felt that they should learn carpentry and various other things.",
        "A: He was -- the school -- he was arrested and put in a concentration camp.",
        "A: My uncle, yeah. And eventually, I don't know how he escaped or was released,\nand walked across Europe and came tothe United States and became a full\nprofessor at William and Mary, and then after the war went back to Germany and\nbecame the head of the Hamburg University.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Iremember that he also when he went back he wrote a-- what you call those\ncolumns where you answer people's problems in the newspaper?",
        "A: Yeah, he did that for years.",
        "A: I guess so, yeah.",
        "A: No.\n{Laughter from both}",
        "A: No, it wasn't.",
        "A: Well, where he came from was what's called Bohemia then and was part of the\nAustrian Empire.",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes.",
        "A: He was from an German area in Bohemia.",
        "A: My mother was born in Austria. She took her medical training in Czechoslovakia\nand, but she was Jewish and she spoke perfect German.",
        "A: Never spoke Jewish. I never learned Jewish.",
        "A: Yiddish, no. Never spoke anything but German, and later French, and that's it.",
        "A: In 1933, Iwas 9 years old.",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes.",
        "A: Well, they explained antisemitism, which was a very strange concept to me, partly\nbecause I'd been brought up without any religion and didn't really realize that I was\nJewish until I was probably ten years old. They talked about the danger of the\nNazis and that they might have to do something about it, leave, or -- and they --\nmy mother was a psychoanalyst, so they believed in talking to children very openly,\nand so we pretty much knew by age 10 what was going on.",
        "A: My oldest sister was six years older than I was.",
        "A: And she was much more conscious when we left Germany of leaving her home\nand leaving her, and she had about the time she was 18, she was engaged toa\nyoung man who came with us to America later on, and she started a school\nalso, so --",
        "A: The school, they were anti-Nazi and very protective of my parents. I don't think --\nat least that's along time ago --I don't think any of them turned out to be Nazis. I\nknow that one or two joined the SA in order to protect the school, but we didn't\nreally run into Nazis until probably 1935 when the State started appointing teachers\nto the school, and they were of course Nazis.",
        "A: Yes, it was.",
        "A: Well, yeah, until the school started, and then it was funded by tuition.",
        "A: He died before -- I think he died in 1933, which was just the beginning of the\nNazi time in Germany, and they did not -- any Jewish push did not start until one\nor two years later.",
        "A: Very little. He died when I was nine or 10. I knew he had a beautiful house in\nHamburg, as we visited occasionally, and my mother's mother -- my original\ngrandfather was blind and died early.",
        "A: My maternal grandfather. She remarried and eventually died in Theresienstadt, both\nshe and her husband.",
        "A: And my grandmother, yeah. I had -- it was amazing, I had two cousins. He was a\nchemist, and she was a social worker. They went to Theresienstadt for six years,\nand he survived because he was in charge of delousing, and she survived because she\ntook care of one of her children. But they told these stories; it always amazed me\nthat every morning she would knock on his window to let him know that she was\nstill alive. And they came to this country and had avery successful life here. He\ncame -- he worked for, I forgot what company in Pittsburg, a chemical company, and\ndid very well.",
        "A: I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.",
        "A: No. No. It was something, somebody else in Pittsburg, I don't remember the\ncompany.",
        "A: Well, by that time, by 1935, Jews were not allowed to direct schools anymore,\nand my mother planned that we would go to Switzerland, and there were alot of\nJewish refugees in Switzerland. And my parents started a school. It was in a place\ncalled Gland, which was about halfway between Geneva and ?Lausanne?.",
        "A: G-L-A:-N-D.",
        "A: Gland. And inthe beginning the school was made up mostly of German refugee\nkids who had escaped to Switzerland, and the school was quite successful, but we\nstayed there onthe -- three years, and then in 1936 wecame tothe United States.",
        "A: 1938. I'm sorry.",
        "A: I was two or three years old.",
        "A: When I left Germany, yes, we were very worried about getting over the border\ninto Switzerland. I remember that.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: We went by three different cars. Had very little trouble at the border. We claimed\nthat we weren't Jewish because they were letting -- I can remember that I was very\nembarrassed because somebody asked me to take down my pants to prove that I\nwasn't Jewish, and I was only about 10 or 12, soit was very embarrassing, but\nprobably worth it.",
        "A: And we started a school 1n Switzerland.",
        "A: We took some other Jewish students with us, and we thought that the Swiss\nwould be more likely to let us inif there were small groups rather than one --",
        "A: -- larger group.",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t three cars in a row. We went at different times across the border. The\nSwiss were very anxious in those days about letting too many Jews into the country.",
        "A: Iwas inacar with my father and one sister, and my mother was inacar with\nanother sister.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely. But that was atime of great concern anyway, all the way\naround.",
        "A: Assets?",
        "A: They had inherited a fair amount of money from my grandfather, but when you\nleft Germany in those days you were allowed to take a thousand dollars and -- a\nthousand marks, I guess it was -- and everything else was confiscated.",
        "A: All that was lost. We had some friends in Switzerland who helped in the\nbeginning until the school got started, but we had almost no money at all.",
        "A: Oh, yes, of course, particularly since most of the students were from Germany and\nhad relatives in Germany and relatives in concentration camps, and it was always\ndiscussion of what was going on in Germany.",
        "A: Some of them did. Some of them were children of people who had come to\nSwitzerland and --",
        "A: She never practiced.",
        "A: She practiced her trade in the school by seeing every child -- hey, stop growling\n-- she -- she -- the schools really were partly successful because she was there and\nworking with every child --",
        "A: -- in the school.",
        "A: There was several reasons. One is that the Swiss were very dubious about having\nGermans, and they were sending people back to Germany at the time. Secondly,\nour visa had run out, and we were actually very lucky. In those days if you were\nJewish you had a\"J\" in your German passport, and American immigration laws in\nthose days meant that if you were Jewish it took three or four more years before\nyou could get, while they were perfectly happy to take non-Jewish Germans, and\nwe had a friend at the German Consulate in Geneva who made sure that we had\npassports without a \"J\" init, which gave us an early immigration visa to America.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We went by car to France and took a ship -- I believe it was ?La Sauve? to the\nUnited States.",
        "A: I spoke pretty good French then because I'd lived inthe French part of\nSwitzerland for two years.",
        "A: There were two other former students who came with us.",
        "A: And my -- he had already -- he was non-Jewish, and he was able to get a visa for\nAmerica, so he was already in America by the time we got here.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Yeah. Of course, I was very young, but, as I said, I played soccer alot, and we\nplayed other teams from other parts of Germany, and people came in from the area.\nThere was no prejudice against Jews atthe time. If there was, it was not apparent, and\nso we had alot of Germans who would --",
        "A: Switzerland.",
        "A: Well, we just drove through and sailed from France.",
        "A: I didn't. I think was too young to really feel German. My sister, my oldest sister\nfelt very much that she had lost her home when she left. I didn't really. [never felt\nparticularly German, and having learned French in Switzerland, and so I actually all\nmy life I haven't felt particularly German?",
        "A: German.",
        "A: Until my sister's children would scream, \"English, please,\" when we were talking\nGerman, so that we eventually started talking German. My parents always had a very\nstrong accent because they'd left when they were already adults, and I guess I had a\nminimal accent so.",
        "A: We arrived at New York.",
        "A: And at first all six of us lived in one hotel room.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I just remember that there were six of us inthe hotel room. {coughs) -- excuse me.",
        "A: No. I'm all right. I'll get some ina minute. And I was --I was sent to an awful\nschool and didn't like it at all.",
        "A: Iwas in-- it was a--I can't remember what kind of school it was. I was only\nthere for about six months.",
        "A: It was in Manhattan.",
        "A: But my parents very soon started a school in Windsor, Vermont.",
        "A: The school was called the Windsor Mountain School. It was called the Windsor\nMountain School all the way through until it closed in 1987 or'86, or something like\nthat.",
        "A: They had various friends, and one of them was a writer named Dorothy Canfield\nFisher, who was quite a famous writer at the time, and she lived in Arlington,\nVermont, and said there was this place that would be very good forthe school. So\nwe moved to -- the school then eventually moved to Manchester, Vermont, and then\nto Lenox, Massachusetts.",
        "A: We, I guess, were never really invested in New York, and plans were always to\nmove out back into the country, so --",
        "A: It didn't feel like much of a change, huh-uh.",
        "A: Well, I went to a local high school because our school wasn't working yet. Then I\nwent to the Windsor Mountain School for my last two years of high school. Ihad a\nscholarship at a place called Wagner College in Staten Island, but after three months,\nbecause I was a German National, they asked me to leave, and through various\nfriends, and because I was a great soccer player, I got accepted at Swarthmore, and |\nstayed in Swarthmore for four years and graduated from Swarthmore.",
        "A: Much better than Wagner College, yes. And then I was the, I think, the first --\nthis was after the war of course, and they had to take the veterans. I got a master's\ndegree at ?Bridmall?, which I think I was the first man to get a degree in Bridmall.",
        "A: Modern European History.",
        "A: Very hard to remember. I think I was most worried about learning the language\nand learning to fit in. It wasn't that difficult because when the Windsor Mountain\nSchool started, there were only about eight students. It later became much larger, so\nthat we all had sort of a ready-made --",
        "A: I was only there for about six months. It was a Lutheran school, and it was\nterrible.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: I can't really remember why I hated it, but I think it was regimented it, and --",
        "A: It was strict, and I didn't think we were learning anything in the classes. And, of\ncourse, by the time I was 15 or 16, I'd been through a fair amount of changes in my\nlife, so that I was probably more conscious of the world around me than the people\nmy age there, and that kind of bothered me.",
        "A: I was lonely, because I didn't speak English very well.",
        "A: This was three months after we arrived in this country.",
        "A: They had, for instance?Tomus Mun? was a friend of theirs, and various other\nwriters. One of the first students was the daughter of Karl ?Sutmeyer? who was a\nGerman writer, and there was awhole group of German and American intellectuals\nwho supported the school and they helped us get going.",
        "A: It certainly was easier for us than for many other German refugees. I don't -- you\nwere probably not alive in those days, but there was avery strong antisemetic strain\nin America at that time.",
        "A: And coming from Germany, that was particularly --",
        "A: Oh, yeah. It was -- it wasn't clear at Swarthmore, which is a Quaker school, and\ntherefore obviously not -- but there was antisemitism in the area where we lived and\nyou could sort of sense it. Maybe we were overly sensitive about it. I don't know.",
        "A: Just remarks, but nothing physical or people would talk about kikes or something\nlike that.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: That's how I learned that word. It was somebody -- and I can remember asking\nsomebody what does it mean, and they explained it to me.",
        "A: And it really is a big change inthis country from the antisemitism that existed at\nthat time to the pretty much total acceptance that exists now.",
        "A: No, it was gradual. And, to be honest with you, I never felt particularly Jewish.\nThe only reason that I would tell people that Iwas Jewish is that I felt to explain\nwhat the Germans did and that I wasn't ashamed of being Jewish. But most of my\nlife nobody asked, and I was always blond and not particularly looking of any kind\nof -- so that 1t never -- in many years it was never mentioned. I mean, and the fact\nthat we were not religious, of course, made abig difference.",
        "A: Absolutely, yeah.",
        "A: Not really.",
        "A: My parents were, I guess what was called then free thinkers and had absolutely\nno religious -- I mean, I don't think I ever heard them talk about God or any kind of\nreligion. And it wasn't until the Nazis that the Jews became arace, you know. And\nso that when I grew up it was areligion. And since we weren't religious, then it didn't\nplay any part in my life really.",
        "A: When you're young enough you adopt very quickly. I guess Iwas 13 or 14 when\nIcame here, and really adopted very fast to -- and of course we all wanted to adopt\nto the American. I remember that we made a point of speaking English and not\nsomehow standing out as immigrants.",
        "A: We had very few relatives that left behind in Germany. As I said, my mother's\nmother died at Theresienstadt. There were -- my mother's brother and his wife fled\nthe Nazis in Austria, and then in Czechoslovakia, and they went to Romania, and then\ndecided they weren't going torun anymore and killed themselves. They had two\nadolescent children, two boys, who somehow made their way. One of them came to\nthis country as a -- he was kind ofa language genius and became a professor at\n\u2019Broome? The other one had avery -- he went from -- he went to England during\nthe war, joined the Czech Air Force, got shot down over Italy, spent two years in\nacamp, went back to Czechoslovakia after the war, got caught by the\nCommunists.",
        "A: Who were suspicious of him because he had served in the Czech Air Force. With\nthe help of Eleanor Roosevelt, Sinclair Lewis, Dorothy Thompson, various other\npeople, we got him out of Czechoslovakia, and he taught at my school for the next\n15 years.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: ?Getivena?.",
        "A: Yeah. I think he wrote a book or somebody wrote a book about his very difficult\nlife.",
        "A: He was in an Italian prison of war camp.",
        "A: That probably was alot better than a German prisoner of war camp.",
        "A: European History.",
        "A: Modern History.",
        "A: Yeah. I wrote a-- my master thesis was about the Yalta Conference.",
        "A: Well, I guess I was very interested in what was going on in the world. I had\nspent, oh, four years inthe Army, and that made it even more important for me to\nknow what was going on. Atone point I had wanted to teach modern history, but --\nthe school in Vermont. For two years to go to alocal school, and then you finish\nyour high school in, at your own parents' school.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Probably '42 or'43 somewhere around there.",
        "A: Well, Ihad one year in college before I joined the Army.",
        "A: First, Iwas half a year at Wagner College and the other half at Swarthmore.",
        "A: I did.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I interrupted it. I had three and ahalf years, four years inthe Army, and then I\nwent back to Swarthmore.",
        "A: Iwas 18, and I loved skiing, and somebody told me if you join the mountain\ntroops you'll do alot of skiing. So I volunteered for the mountain troops, which were\nin a terrible place called Camphill, Colorado, and I spent about eight months there\nuntil I was transferred. I suddenly got orders to transfer to Camp Ritchie.",
        "A: It was cold. The Army had just started to train mountain troops and didn't really\nknow what they were doing. The camp itself had probably 100 wood stoves, which\ngave everybody which stayed -- the smoke stayed in\nthe camp, and we all got rheumatism and various bumps and bruises and --",
        "A: Each barrack had a stove atthe end that spewed out, was a wood stove, and was\nnot very warm inthe barracks, and we never did any skiing. We hiked a lot with\nbackpacks, and I was very glad to get out of there.",
        "A: That's correct.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. When I first went to the mountain troops, for instance, most of the\npeople were college guys who, people who had started college, wood skiers, and\nvolunteers, and then they didn't get enough people. And they started send draftees,\nfor instance, from Georgia and various other southern states who were absolutely\ntotally miserable. I can remember that this one guy, he was a sharp shooter and\nwas very proud of it, but it was socold that you had to wear gloves, and he refused\nto wear gloves, and his hands kept freezing to the trigger, and we tried to explain it to\nhim. But eventually he went to the hospital because he had, was just one of those --",
        "A: That's right. And he couldn't do it without gloves, and he didn't feel he could.",
        "A: I don't know.",
        "A: Oh, we got to know each other, but at that time I spoke perfect English. And in\nthose days the Army didn't want any noncitizens.",
        "A: No, I became a citizen of Leadville, Colorado, which was right near the camp.\nAnd I was -- I guess I was 18 or 19 when I became a citizen.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: I'd been living inthe United States for a while, and being inthe Army, it was\nnice to be acitizen, but it wasn't a terribly big thing.",
        "A: Yes, it did.",
        "A: Somebody found out I'm sure, and there were -- when I talked to the people at\nRitchie, there were alot of people like that. SoIwas younger than most because\nmany of the German emigrees were older when they came to this country. They also\nwere suddenly called out. Somebody in their service records found that they spoke\nGerman or French, and so we got transferred to Ritchie.",
        "A: Ritchie --",
        "A: Ritchie was avery strange camp. It was near Baltimore. Actually, it was in the\nCatoctin Mountains, and almost everybody had a different mother tongue than\nEnglish. Many of the people were older than I was. And it was -- we learned how to\ninterrogate prisoners of war.",
        "A: All right. I don't really remember much of that.",
        "A: It's 50 years ago.",
        "A: Ritchie was more comfortable than the --",
        "A: Colorado. And it was strange because people either spoke French or German or\nJapanese, and there was relatively rigorous training in how to interrogate people, what\nnot todo, for instance. In the three years that I interrogated people, I never touched\na German prisoner, even when I interrogated a concentration camp guard that you\nwanted to rip apart with your hands, we never touched them, and I don't think any\nof the other interrogators ever touched German prisoners.",
        "A: Absolute rules. Don't touch. You can play whatever intellectual trick you want\nto play on them to make them talk, but you can't touch them.",
        "A: There are two things: You had to learn the makeup of the German army, what\ndivisions, who was commander, what division, and so on. And they were very strict\nabout not torturing anybody ever. Ican show you a picture of --",
        "A: -- to prove that Iwas young once.",
        "A: That's me.",
        "A: (Indicating)",
        "A: These are German prisoners.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Yes.",
        "A: Eight weeks.",
        "A: I thought that I was going to be able to do more --I felt very strongly, having\ncome from Germany, that it was all -- our views were passivists, that I couldn't let\nother people do it for me because it didn't, didn't seem right at the time. So, as I said,\nI volunteered. Once we were finished with Ritchey, we were assigned to various\ndivisions as a team. I was inthe 79th Division and stayed with the 79th Division all\nthe way through Europe. You can see where we went somewhere here.",
        "A: See.",
        "A: We came through the English Channel. We landed in Normandy.",
        "A: D plus 18 hours. So it was close.",
        "A: No, that's right.",
        "A: A lot of dead people. And I'd never seen dead people before in my life, so --",
        "A: Iwas. Iwas. Two things. Two things that I remember very well is crossing the\nchannel. I was extremely seasick. It was small boats, a small flat-bottom boat, and I\ncan remember that somebody said there's an German plane that's going to attack us. I\nsaid, \"Okay. I hope it hits us.\" I was so seasick, so --\n{Laughter by both}",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "A: We -- because I was an interrogator by that time, we were informed probably three\nweeks before the landing what day the landing would be and where we would be\nlanding. Of course, we weren't allowed to stick our nose out of the camp after that --",
        "A: -- and it was heavily surrounded. It was in, I think it was in South Hampton. And\nso we knew. And actually the landing was supposed to be a day earlier than the 6th\nof June, and --\n{interview interrupted}\nwe were talking about, about the landing at Normandy and when you learnt of it and\nhow the camp was closed afterwards, presumably to prevent news of this leaking out,\nand I interrupted you inthe middle of you telling me.",
        "A: What was I saying? Do you know?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Iwas very sea sick onthe boat, and the landing itself was kind of\ntraumatic because I had never seen alot of dead people, and there were alot of dead\nAmericans, either in the water or on the beach, and that was the beginning of about\na year and ahalf of warfare.",
        "A: What were the experiences?",
        "A: Oh, we were very busy. The idea was that German prisoners would talk best if\nyou talked to them within ten minutes of their capture 'cause they were\npsychologically still traumatized. So we were very close to the front lines always, and\nwe started right away interrogating prisoners.",
        "A: Not actually. | Wealways carried guns and occasionally somebody was shooting\nat us, and we would shoot back, but we were not combat soldiers.",
        "A: No. I ended up interrogating probably, oh, two or three thousand people over the\nnext two years.",
        "A: Sol don't remember them too well. Ican remember that if somebody didn't want\nto tell me what I wanted to know, I would say, well, see that solider at the door.\nHe's from Poland. He just lost his parents in Poland. Would you rather talk to him\nor to me? And they usually would rather talk to me.",
        "A:T have to admit that I had pretty strong feelings about the Germans, and\nparticularly ranking officers. I remember probably -- there was nobody who was really\nexciting. There was one general who knew the division commander of the division I\nwas in. They had somehow gotten together, and he was very upset by the fact that\nI treated him like everybody else. And the general came down to say hello to him,\nbut we didn't treat him any better than anybody else.",
        "A: About what?",
        "A: Well, where I was, the information we were looking for was usually pretty simple,\nlike, what division are you from, what orders did you have to attack, where were\nyou supposed to attack, how many people were there. I mean, they were all very\ndirect questions connected to the tactical situation.",
        "A: Military questions.",
        "A: It was in France, yeah.",
        "A: It was probably in Normandy, yeah.",
        "A: German soldiers?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. The Germans by that time had lost alot of people onthe Russian\nfront, and they were drafting 17, 16, sometimes 15 year olds into the Army. So\nthere were alot of people younger than I was. One of the things that we did as an\ninterpreter -- as an interrogator, we were very conscious that the Germans were rank\nconscious. And I was allowed to wear any kind of button up to Major, which on an\n18-year-old was a little iffy, of course, and we finally settled in the end of wearing US\nbuttons that just said US on the shirt. It did allow me to go eat in the officers' mess\noccasionally.",
        "A: More likely to talk. The US button sort of represented some kind of a special\ntroops to the Germans so that -- but there were Germans when I first started, and it\nwas acorporal who said they wouldn't talk to a corporal; get me a lieutenant; I will\ntalk to him.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah, not really. I once interrogated somebody who had been atthe school in\nGermany.",
        "A: And -- but that was about as close asI got to --",
        "A: They asked about my parents.",
        "A: I explained to them who I was.",
        "A: Not really. They were all Germans to me.",
        "A: Most of these people didn't know very much. They knew they existed, but I did,\nafter the war, spend ashort time at Dachau interrogating guards and people there,\nand it looked just like those pictures that you've seen.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That's right.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Very different, you know. Hundreds of them. Some were arrogant Nazis; some\nwere country boys who didn't know any political consequences; some were old-time\nArmy guys who would follow orders no matter what. So it was a great deal of\ndifference. Towards the end of war, asI said, they were 16, 17 year olds.",
        "A: The war?",
        "A: I think that the war probably changed me, yes. Maybe I grew up a lot quicker\nthan I would have otherwise.",
        "A: That maybe I was more serious about the things I was doing than I would have\nbeen if I'd just been a21 ora 22 year old in college.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They were mostly worried about whether I was going to get hurt or not. I think\nthat was probably the most concern who had soldiers who were near the front lines.\nAnd one of the problems was that there were no telephones and you had to write e-\nmail letters. | had one, which was special.",
        "A: I thought [had one, but maybe I don't. These were e-mails.",
        "A: No, these are letters.",
        "A: Photographed and then sent by e-mail, or whatever the --",
        "A: That's what my parents would be getting.",
        "A: No, it was --",
        "A: That was the original size, but it was sent this size, in that size.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: That\u2019s something about the school. And that\u2019s a document says I was wounded in\naction.",
        "A: I didn't get inthe fox hole quickly enough, and I got hit in the foot.",
        "A: I got a Purple Heart, which I didn't pick up until atthe end of the war. People\nwould -- you had to have acertain number of points to get discharged, and Purple\nHeart would get you five points, so I made sure that this is -- I made sure that I had\nthis letter to get my five points so that --",
        "A: --I could get discharged. But I spent almost a year after the end of the war in\nmilitary government in Germany.",
        "A: Couldn't find anybody who wasn't a Nazi to put in charge of, the only people we\ncould find to -- you know, we was supposed to set up governments at various places.",
        "A: And the only people we could find were people that had been in concentration\ncamps, and they were often notreally ready torun acity, or something like that, so\nit was difficult.",
        "A: Various places in Germany. You can see on this line.",
        "A: That's the map that I went through --",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Well, this was the Battle of the Bulge up here.",
        "A: In Belgium was the Battle of the Bulge. Wewere called up there because there\nwere some American troops that were surrounded at the time.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: To the Czech border, yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: We moved around. This was --",
        "A: This was after the war.",
        "A: And we moved around from place to place, and most of the time we went back\nhere and set up military governments in this area.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, the interrogation was conducted all the way along anytime there was a, the\ndivision took a prisoner, we would interrogate them.",
        "A: Right, and then into Germany.",
        "A: No, actually, it was earlier. It was in July somewhere. I had a letter in here. What\ndid I do with it?",
        "A: That said where I was wounded. Maybe not. There it 1s.",
        "A: Pepi (ph).",
        "A: I remember that I went to the, to some kind of Army hospital, and they sewed it\nup and put a bandage on it and told me to go back.\n{Laughter}",
        "A: It was at Dachau after the war.",
        "A: Oh, probably two weeks, three weeks after the Armistice.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Of course, yes.",
        "A: AsI said, it looked just like the photographs you have seen, alot of dead people\naround, piles of clothing.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: My division was stationed near Dachau, and they needed somebody to help\ninterrogate the guards.",
        "A: Soland another interrogator was sent over there to interrogate the guards and\nmake some recommendation what to do with them.",
        "A: There was some still there, yes.",
        "A: Yes. But --",
        "A: About what?",
        "A: Yeah, I asked them about the guards, and they said some were good; some were\nbad, so -- but they were in pretty bad shape. I mean, by the end of the war the\nGermans were running out of food, and of course they didn't give any food to the\ncamps, so that many of them were really very badly starved.",
        "A: So that -- and then Ican remember that I went around and told all the soldiers\nthat were inthe camp don't give them too much food; it will kill them. It will kill\nthem. Don't give them. They used to hand them chocolate, which of course was\nterrible for them, and --",
        "A: And I remember that pretty vividly, trying to tell them. Most Americans soldiers\nwere very generous that way and wanted to feed them and give them whatever they\nhad. But it was just very bad for them since they had been starving and --",
        "A: Six days, I think.",
        "A: Oh, I'm not sure. Maybe 20, 25, 30 of them.",
        "A: Well, they were usually SS guards at the -- there were some -- I guess by the\nend of the war they had some guards from Latvia and various other occupied\ncountries who swore up and down that they weren't SS, of course, but they were\nLatvian SS or Bastognian SS, but they were --",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Nix SS Latvian.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Not particularly good. Nobody was ever particularly good. They did point out\nsome who were particularly cruel, but alot of them were just guards.",
        "A: We wrote it up and passed it to the, either the regimental or division commander,\ndepending on who we were working for at the time.",
        "A: Oh, during the war the questions were all tactical. After the war, we were\nlooking for war crimes and, of course, we had arrested, oh, alot of sort of Nazis\nwith arank around Mayia (ph). And then General Patton decided that the Nazis\nwere just like Republicans and Democrats, and we should let them all go.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yes, it was. And I will admit that most of the people I was with cheered when\nthey heard that Patton was killed.",
        "A: You know, it's like any other job, after a while --",
        "A: -- it becomes routine. And paid special attention to people who might have been\nwar criminals, but the general run-of-the-mill solider, it got to be routine, and you\npretty much asked the same thing over and over again.",
        "A: Occasionally, there were some high ranking SS people who were trying to hide,\nbut usually when that happened we would turn them over to higher authorities.",
        "A: The Ritchie Boys were divided into teams -- one lieutenant, one sergeant, and one\ncorporal.",
        "A: And I was the corporal on one of the teams. And each division would be getting\none of these teams.",
        "A: We were always together for a whole year, so two years. Slept in the same place,\nand probably got on each others nerves, so --",
        "A: The lieutenant was from Milwaukee. At the time the Army did not want\nGerman refugees or recent refugees from Germany being officers in the Army, so that\nthe lieutenants in the office were usually German speaking or poorly German\nspeaking from places like Milwaukee and the other German --",
        "A: -- or New York, 86th Street, wherever that 1s.",
        "A: But the enlisted men were usually the refugees. But they were all -- many of the\nrefugees would come from Germany were older than I was. They were 36, 35. I\nremember that the person I was with, the other sergeant was about 35 at the time.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yes. I was\u2014I got in the Army when I was 18, and I guess I got out when I was 22.",
        "A: I knew it about a month ago and then I've forgotten. I was at a Ritchie Boy\nreunion, and I guess both of those guys were dead because nobody knew anything\nabout them, but I can't remember it now.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No? Were you contacted about it?",
        "A: No, Isaw the movie.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, I actually saw the movie at a Ritchie reunion.",
        "A: 1945, yeah.",
        "A: Yes. I was glad to get out of the Army. In fact, I made the mistake of throwing\neverything away.",
        "A: Well, I didn't like and don't like the Army system of taking orders from -- you\nknow, you take an order from the next higher up, and very often the people who\ngave the orders didn't know as much as the people who took them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: By that time my parents had a school in Manchester, Vermont. I very quickly\nreturned to college and went to Swarthmore and spent the next three and a half\nyears there.",
        "A: I probably didn't talk about the war for 30 years.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, I certainly didn't volunteer to be interviewed, and it was just something so\ndifferent from what anybody else had experienced, except an veteran, that I just didn't\nwant to talk about it, and then maybe after 30 years I started talking about it.",
        "A: I guess my wife and my parents.",
        "A: No. I was married -- I'm married twice.",
        "A: My first wife was a student at Swarthmore, and her father was the head of the\nHarvard medical school, and she died of cirrhosis of the liver --",
        "A: -- after we were divorced. And I've been married to my current wife for 35,\nmaybe 38 years now. She was a teacher at Windsor.",
        "A: Two sons.",
        "A: One is the head of aschool in Pennsylvania, and the other one is a construction\ntype. And grandchildren.",
        "A: Four.",
        "A: Two are adult, and they're 19 and 20 from my oldest son. And my youngest son\nhas a-- the two older ones are girls, and the two younger ones are boys, 3 and 8.",
        "A: My youngest son got interested in what I did during the war, maybe ten years\nago. But you can't blame them. I never talked about it, and --",
        "A: I was the headmaster of a co-educational boarding school for 35 years, called the\nWindsor Mountain School.",
        "A: The school was founded by my parents, yes. And then after Icame to Washington\nIwas the head of anumber of small schools. Then I retired when I was 78, or\nsomething like that.",
        "A: Once. I had -- didn't want to go back to Germany and always avoided going back\nto Germany. They had aceremony to honor my parents, and I felt I should go to that,\nso I was back in Germany once.",
        "A: No, it was in -- yeah, it was atthe school too, but the ceremony was, I think, in\nHamburg.",
        "A: We talked so much I can't remember what I said.",
        "A: It's very hard to remember, and particularly the war. Sometimes I don't know\nwhether I've seen it inthe movies or whether I've really experienced it because it's so\nlong ago.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No. I just went to -- asI told you, Iwas not very pleased with the military so for\nabout 15, 20 years I had no contact with any -- you're free to look atthe book.",
        "A: You are very well behaved, guys.\n"
