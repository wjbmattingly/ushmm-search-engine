        "Answer: Good morning.",
        "Q: Welcome.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: Tell me what your name was at birth.",
        "A: St -- Steven Joseph Fenves -- Fenyves.",
        "Q: Fenyves --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- you say actually.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And wha -- how do you pronounce it now? Just Fenves?",
        "A: Yes, when I got my citizenship I -- I dropped it, th-the J, because the -- the Croatian spelling\nis with a J rather than the Y.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And nobody could pronounce it so I -- I just dropped it.",
        "Q: Right. And what was it -- what was your date of birth?",
        "A: June sixth, 1931.",
        "Q: And where?",
        "A: In Subotica, then part -- then Yugoslavia, now it\u2019s part of Serbia.",
        "Q: And then in the middle it became part of something else, right, yeah.",
        "A: Well, before World War I, it was Hungary; 12 years before my birth it became Yugoslavia\nand during the war it was re-occupied by Hungary.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s get a sense of your family a little bit. You have a mother, father and a sister, yes?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about your dad first.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: He was born Louis Friedman. He and his brother changed their name. That was the great\nvogue in Hungary that everybody was taking on Hungarian names, so they changed their name to\nFenyves.",
        "Q: Huh. And he was born in?",
        "A: He was born in Mako.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: In southern Hungary.",
        "Q: And what was he doing for a living?",
        "A: Well, let me say a little bit on my family history?",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: His older brother Ferenc, even in high school, became very much in-involved with literature\nand journalism. Went to the University of Budapest to get a degree in law, although there is\nsome claims that he never got his law degree, which doesn\u2019t surprise me because he -- his\ninterest was in -- in journalism. He came back to Subotica and at some very early age, still in his\n20\u2019s, became editor of a newspaper. My father, as soon as he finished high school went to work\nfor a lumber mill in what 1s now Croatia, to support his brother. My uncle married very well. He\nmarried a woman from Temesvar, now Timisoara. The daughter of a very well-to-do porcelain\nmanufacturer. And I suspect with hi -- with her dowry, my uncle bought the newspaper -- the\nprinting plant. And he was the editor, my father was the manager. My uncle died in 1935, and\nthen my father became the editor and my aunt became the manager.",
        "Q: And did your father actually have an interest in journalism too? He must have.",
        "A: He had an interest in journalism; he was not a journalist. I\u2019m sure th-there 1s a -- a booklet\nthat came out in 90 -- 1994, there was a commemoration of the 50\" anniversary of -- of the\ndeportation, and there was a booklet about Jews in Subotica, and it talks at length about my uncle\nand then a short paragraph that after his brother\u2019s death, Louis Fenyves became nominally the\neditor, but most of the editing was done by x and y.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So yeah, he was not a journalist, my dad.",
        "Q: So you think he was more of an administrator than --",
        "A: He was a -- yeah, right.",
        "Q: -- than he was.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And -- whereas your uncle was really a journalist?",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: I see. What kind of a person was your father in your memory of him as a kid? Were you\nclose?",
        "A: Yes, we were close. The printing plant was in the same building where y -- where th --",
        "Q: Where you lived?",
        "A: -- where we lived. We had a two story building. My uncle\u2019s apartment on -- on the first floor,\nours on the second floor editorial offices, business office and then a big plant. So we were\nalways very deeply involved with the plant, and I -- as a child I couldn\u2019t go to sleep unless I\nheard the presses rolling.",
        "Q: And why was that, it wa-was it --",
        "A: I mean, that -- that -- that was the --",
        "Q: -- it -- you don\u2019t -- that was just --",
        "A: -- that was -- uh-huh, the normal way of things. So I -- I would visit my father\u2019s office and\nyeah, we -- we spent time together, but -- we -- I -- my friends and I would -- did a lot of\nroaming around the plant -- plant, we liked to do that.",
        "Q: Was your father a serious guy, was he a -- a sort of a lighter person? Do you -- do you\nrecollect as a kid?",
        "A: Ah -- yeah, he was a serious guy, he -- he would -- enjoyed helping his workers. Several\npeople started small businesses. One of them started a small machine shop where during the\noccupation I actually worked. So he was very helpful to -- to -- who -- very involved in the lives\nof the -- his employees.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And his brother Ferenc, was he older?",
        "A: He was, yes, three or four years older.",
        "Q: Three or four years older, and did he -- wh-what did he die of, do you know?",
        "A: Heart attack.",
        "Q: He had a heart attack. Do you have any recollection? You would have been four years --",
        "A: Oh yes, I --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- yeah, my -- my cousin says it\u2019s impossible, but I -- but it -- coming home from nursery\nschool, had to get -- go up the stairs and in the landing was the door to their apartment and my\nuncle was there, waiting to be admitted. He never carried a key, he rapped on the frosted glass\nwindow to be let in by the maid. And I always timed that -- that I would get in there the same\ntime, and we all -- he always had jokes for me [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you liked him a lot, you can tell.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Was your father like him, or were they very -- quite different?",
        "A: I think my father was like him, he -- yeah, he -- yeah, enjoyed, yeah. He certainly enjoyed\nlife, I -- I remember after school -- after the paper was put -- put to bed, he would go to the\ncoffee house and -- and have coffee with his friends and I would go and -- and sit on his lap, and",
        "Q: Really, yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And tell me about your mother. Wa-was there -- they were similar in age, or was he consi --\nolder, or --",
        "A: My father was born in 1889, my mother was born in 1997. So there was eight years age\ndifference.",
        "Q: You me -- 1897.",
        "A: 1897.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And she was born in -- in 18 -- in --",
        "Q: Cause you said 1997.",
        "A: Oh. 18 -- I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: 1897.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And she was born in -- I\u2019m sorry. He was born in 1887, she was born in 19 -- in 1899.",
        "Q: 1899, uh-huh.",
        "A: She was a -- I think she was sort of a withdrawn person in a way. She -- she came from a -- a\nmuch more prominent family than my father. My fathers -- was -- my -- my grandfather started\nout as a tanner in -- in this small shtetl in Mako, then moved to Subotica and -- and a lumber\ndealership. And s -- I think both my uncle and my father married up.",
        "Q: Up.",
        "A: My -- my mother\u2019s family father was a lawyer. The first Jewish professor at the high school\nwas a relative, couple univers -- professors at the University of Budapest were relatives. My\ngrandmother\u2019s family was Taussig. He was one of the more -- her father was one of the more\nprominent merchants. And the -- so my mother was raised in a much more upper class family.\nShe finished high school in Subard -- in what was then Subard, to coin the Hungarian name.\nWent to Budapest, got her degree in -- in graphic -- graphic arts, and came back to Subotica. My\nunderstanding is that she did some artwork for my father\u2019s newspaper and that\u2019s how they met.\nMy understanding is that the family was opposed to the marriage and they sent her off on a grand\ntour, and the few pieces of -- of her work that we have is mostly \u201825 - \u201826 - \u201827, Vienna, Italy,\nFrance. But then they got married. She did not continue her art as -- work as seriously as my\nsister and I think she should have. Her studio was shared wi-wit-with -- our playroom was her\nstudio. She -- she, especially when my aunt became the manager of the printing plant, for all\npractical purposes, my mother was her social secretary.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Her coffee -- my aunt\u2019s coffee was at our house, hosted by my mother.",
        "Q: I see --",
        "A: SO --",
        "Q: So it changed --",
        "A: Yeah, so it -- it -- it was a -- strange relation -- I mean, all the important gifts, my first watch,\nmy first bicycle, etcetera, came from my aunt, not from my parents.",
        "Q: That\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: But my mother was a very, very warm person.",
        "Q: But you said she was withdrawn in some [indecipherable]",
        "A: She -- yeah, she -- she had a close set of friends, but -- but she wa -- I wouldn\u2019t call her\noutgoing at all.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. And what was her name?",
        "A: Claire Gered.",
        "Q: That\u2019s Gered -- g -- g-e-r --",
        "A: G-e-r-e-d.",
        "Q: -- e-d. Uh-huh. You know, I forgot to ask you, what was the name of the newspaper?",
        "A: The name of the newspaper is Naplo, which means daily.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The name of the -- of the plant was Minerva.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Now, what -- was it unusual for a woman -- and I know you wouldn\u2019t know this as a\nkid, but as you grew up an adult, to go and get as much edu -- education as your mother did?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. Several of the -- my aunts, several of the woman I knew",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- had -- had university degrees.",
        "Q: Do you think your mother felt bad because she was not continuing her art? Do you think --\nyou don\u2019t -- you have no idea.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: She certainly encouraged the two of us to -- to do art.",
        "Q: To do it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did she teach you?",
        "A: She coached, she -- yeah sh-she supervised and she didn\u2019t explicitly teach us.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But she certainly encouraged us.",
        "Q: That\u2019s interesting because you were in the same room with her, so I imagine imitation --",
        "A: Oh yes, definitely --",
        "Q: -- was something that you wanted to do.",
        "A: -- definitely, right, yeah.",
        "Q: Right?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And tell me about your sister.",
        "A: My sister is two years older than I.",
        "Q: And her name.",
        "A: Ear -- her name is Esther, and she still uses the Hungarian wording of Eszti rather then Esther,\nwith the Hungarian spelling of s-z. She was always a very outgoing, very precocious, very\nheadstrong girl. The few pictures that we have, always are red hair, and very long plaits. She -- a\n-- during the Hungarian occupation she didn\u2019t get into high school, so her education was sort of\nstopped at sixth grade, although in Paris she attended the Sorbonne. She\u2019s very knowledgeable,\nvery, very bright person. We -- we [indecipherable] reconnected after the war, we left\nYugoslavia together, were in France together, came to the States together. And for the last 20 -\nsome years she has been living in Washington.",
        "Q: She\u2019s been living in Washington?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So that must be very nice for you, living nearby.",
        "A: Oh yes, yeah, yes.",
        "Q: Yes. And as children, she was a couple of years older --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- were you close, or was this be --",
        "A: Oh yeah, we were quite close, we -- we had -- I mean our life was governed by our governess.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And so we were always together. We were both -- you can tell from our age, depression\nchildren. Most of -- most of our friends were single children, or one or two children, particularly\nmany of her -- her classmates were -- were s -- only children. And one of the things I didn\u2019t care\nfor is that I was dragged through all the birthday parties of her -- of her girlfriends. Which --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t like that?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t like that at all.",
        "Q: Was she dragged through the birthday parties of your --",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: -- your friends? No?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Only you?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: So tell me, you had a governess and -- throughout your childhood, until --",
        "A: Til the -- the -- the day of the occupation.",
        "Q: The day of the occupation. Was -- w-would you have considered your family middle class, or\nmore than that?",
        "A: Well, cook, maid, governess, chauffeur.",
        "Q: That seems like a lot.",
        "A: But you have to recognize that Yugoslavia was a det -- dirt poor country, and if you could\nafford to buy a car, you could certainly afford to build a second story on top of the garage and\nsupport one more fa -- one additional family.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: That\u2019s how it worked. Our -- the governess was an important thing. My parents generation\nwas totally saturated with German culture. And the town had a large number of -- of ethnic\nGermans, Swabians. So -- so as not to learn that ugly street dialect, you had to have a governess\nto teach you Volksdeutsche. And yeah, governess was a large part of -- of the life of most of my\n-- most of my friends.",
        "Q: It was?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was just typical in your [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, terrible woman.",
        "Q: Yeah, I was going to ask you what\u2019s she like? She was terrible?",
        "A: Aha, aha, cold, cold woman. Incredibly cold woman. Fanatically religious, Catholic. Dragged\nus to churches and services all the time. The day -- the day they occu -- a-army came in, she left\nin a big show, and I thought that was the greatest thing.",
        "Q: That was the best thing.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: Did you complain to your mother and father about this woman?",
        "A: Oh yeah, but that, I mean --",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t matter.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: But it seems like an odd choice, given your description of your parents, that they would\nchoose someone who was quite like this.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] you know.",
        "A: I mean -- I mean it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s di -- I\u2019m just trying to make a mental image.",
        "Q: So what did she --",
        "A: I can\u2019t think of any governess of any of my friends that was a pleasant person.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. Now, I mean, that thought was going on while you were asking a question. No, I can\u2019t.",
        "Q: You can\u2019t think of any one?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So what -- what did she do for you? I mean, what di -- what was the -- what -- what did a\ngoverness do? Cause I\u2019ve never had one, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Well, first of all, in her presence we only spoke German. You know, the fact that I spoke\nHungarian at home, Serbian in school, and German with my governess, that -- that never s-\nseemed to me strange un-until my children were all speaking one language. Well, after school --\nI think she would wait for us at sc-school, and we had to go on long wa -- take long walks. The --\none of the daily excitements of the city is that the Orient Express changed engines. Hungarian\nengine was uncoupled, and the Yugoslav engine was --",
        "Q: Really? Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- coupled in. So that was a big event to go to, to the railroad station to see the Orient Express.\nFirst time I saw a black person was -- was on that train. Then -- then we had another circuit for a\nlonger trip, longer walk.",
        "Q: Was that -- let me go back for a second, was that a big deal, that you saw a black person?",
        "A: Well no, no.",
        "Q: You just didn\u2019t -- you just wouldn\u2019t -- clearly you --",
        "A: I -- it -- it --",
        "Q: -- it\u2019s a long time memory for you.",
        "A: -- right, right, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Long walks. So, you know, we were just in her presence much more so than in our par --\nparents presence.",
        "Q: Did she smile? I mean, did she have any -- she had no ni -- she apparently had no nice\nqualities as far as you\u2019re concerned?",
        "A: No, she was not a nice person, no.",
        "Q: And Esther felt exactly the same way?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yeah. And we were much closer to the -- to the cook and the maids. Maids never\nlasted very long, I don\u2019t know why, but the cook wa-was the same one for -- for years, for all\nthat I remember.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And we were close to her.",
        "Q: And did the maid and the cook live in their own apartments and the governess lived with you?",
        "A: The governess lived with us. The apartment building had sort of an extension and past the\nkitchen was -- was a two room apartment that the -- the maid and the cook shared.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: The cook was married and would take off some nights. I think she had Wednesday afternoon\noff. But they had a -- a two bedroom apartment.",
        "Q: Right. And who cooked when she had time off? Did your mother?",
        "A: My mother prepared -- da -- did a lot of planning, I don\u2019t -- meal planning, I don\u2019t know --",
        "Q: Whether she cooked.",
        "A: -- whether she cooked. One of --",
        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "A: -- one of the -- one of the few things that our cooked saved for us was, in addition to -- to the\nsmall portion of my mother\u2019s artwork was my mother\u2019s very thick recipe book.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Huh. Did you ever go in the kitchen?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: So you were allowed to roam around the --",
        "A: Oh yeah, yes.",
        "Q: And did you like -- you liked the cook and you liked the maid?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did you have an animal? Any pets?",
        "A: My cousins downstairs had a -- had a cocker spaniel, I -- I didn\u2019t have one.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t have any? Did you like --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- did you like the cocker spaniel?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. And then in the late 30\u2019s, my oldest cousin, who was yu -- slated to take over the -- the\ncompany, decided that he didn\u2019t want that, that he wanted to be a gentleman farmer. And my\naunt, in her usual fashion, went out and bought a large farm, and converted it to sort of a model\nfarm. Brought -- mi -- sent her son to -- to Zurich, to [indecipherable] Federal Technical Institute\nto get a degree in agronomy. And she brought back Swiss cows and a -- prize cows, and -- and I\nspent a good part of my summers on the farm. So tha -- surrounded by animals.",
        "Q: Did the governess go with you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. She stayed home? She stayed in the house?",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t think my sister was there. I -- I liked to be on the farm, I enjoyed it.",
        "Q: You liked that?",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: You liked the cows?",
        "A: Yes, we were herding the cows.",
        "Q: And they were do -- they were milking the cows, or --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- it wasn\u2019t for slaughter?",
        "A: No, no. And there was a prize bull --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and I -- I exhibited him at -- at fairs.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Huh. It didn\u2019t -- it -- it was easy for you talking these three languages because you just --",
        "A: Oh yes, yeah.",
        "Q: And were you s -- were you speaking Serbian very well when you were in school?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: So you were fluent?",
        "A: Yeah. I remember after the war, after we returned from Auschwitz, a new -- a crop of teachers\ncame, and I presumed school in -- in Serbian. And there was this literature teacher who came\nstorming in the -- in the room and handed out papers with terrible grades on that. He said, \u201cNone\nof you think Serbian, you just all think Hungarian and then translate it into Serbian.\u201d And we\ntook that as a terrible affront, a terrible insult. I -- I felt that I was in good in Serbian as anything\nelse.",
        "Q: As in -- right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Now, why were you speaking Hungarian to your parents rather than Serbian or even German?\nDo you -- do you know why\u2019?",
        "A: They were part of the Hungarian Jewish culture.",
        "Q: I see. But still, German was very important to them.",
        "A: German was very important to them.",
        "Q: And th -- what -- they were fluent in German, I gather, as well.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes. Tell me about school, did you like school?",
        "A: At first I had -- I remember I had terrible sep -- separation anxieties in -- in kindergarten.\nThey delegated me to recite a poem about motherhood and I couldn\u2019t get through it, I broke into\ntears.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: But after that, it was -- it was great, yeah. Again, Yugoslavia was a dirt poor country. It had\ncompulsory education except it couldn\u2019t afford it. So any organization, religious community,\netcetera, that could put up a building and hire three teachers, the government supplied the fourth\nteacher and it became a government school. So they -- directly ac-cross the street from our\nhouse, in the -- in the courtyard of the -- of the synagogue was the Jewish grade school. I mean,\nit was a state school, but it was run by the Jewish community. Probably 80 percent of the\nstudents Jewish.",
        "Q: Jewish, mm-hm.",
        "A: And that\u2019s where I went for first four grades. I -- I liked it a lot.",
        "Q: You did.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: At -- so the neighborhood you lived in was primarily Jewish, or all Jewish?",
        "A: Jews -- well, again, Subotica had about 6000 Jews.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Divided, from what I understand, sort of equally between one large Reform congregation, and\nmult -- multiple, multiple small shuls. The -- the Jewish community was very divided. They --\nthose that immigrated -- that came from -- came in the middle of the -- of the 19\" century,\nmostly from Arabia and Bohemia, n-now Czechoslovakia, where German speaking touched by\nthe Mendelssohn [indecipherable] enlightment and belong to a Reform congregation in ha --\nhung -- Hungary had a three way split th -- Reform, which it was called neolog, and the\nOrthodox, and a third group that didn\u2019t last very long called sinaqua al -- as before, that didn\u2019t\naccept the separation. So there was this large Reform congregation, a huge temple designed by\nmy great uncle. I don\u2019t like the word assimilated, I -- I think acculturated 1s a better term. The\nother half came almost exclusively from across the mountains, from Galicia, touched by -- you\nknow, influenced by Baal Shem Tov and Hassidism and there was very little contact between the\ntwo communities.",
        "Q: So even though the community is very small, it\u2019s very divided.",
        "A: It\u2019s very divided. The -- now, to ans -- long answer to question, the Orthodox community was\nhighly concentrated. The Reform Jews lived all -- all over town, all over the better parts of the\ntown, so it wasn\u2019t a Jewish neighborhood at all.",
        "Q: I see. W -- so, you had a mixed bunch of friends, as did your sister?",
        "A: My school friends were largely Jewish. Yeah, I had so -- some neighborhood friends who\nwere not Jewish, but most -- most of my friends were -- were Jewish.",
        "Q: And -- and Jews make up a tiny, tiny portion of the Yugoslav population, let alone it the area\nwhere you lived --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- right through --",
        "A: Or the six percent in the town.",
        "Q: Right. So how were Jews treated within this context. Is -- di -- di -- were you raised feeling as\nif there were some anti-Semitism or not?",
        "A: Absolutely not, I didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: Absolutely not.",
        "A: -- that -- that existed.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I mean, that all started with the war in 1941.",
        "Q: Right. Now a-as you\u2019re growing up, I mean you\u2019re very young when the Nazis take over,\nyou\u2019re only two years old in 1933. But before the war, before \u201939 and before \u201941 when it really\naffects you strongly, do you hear about the Nazis? Do you hear your parents talking about it?",
        "A: Oh yes, I -- I -- ye -- well, my mother\u2019s brother emigrated to the States in the 1920\u2019s. She --\nshe had a -- the ticket for the maiden voyage of the Normandy in \u201939 to visit her brother, to go to\nthe World\u2019s Fair. And she decided not to go because the war made -- might break out and she\nmight not be able to get back.",
        "Q: I see. Huh.",
        "A: So, yeah, lot of things I remember. I me -- one -- one thing I clearly remember, the radio\nmaking the announcement that the -- the [indecipherable] the cardinal, whose name just escapes\nme was elected Pope Pius, and my father said, \u201cThat\u2019s bad for the Jews.\u201d I remember that.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. So we knew s --",
        "Q: You knew s -- you knew something.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to have to stop the tape.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Okay, Steven, I have a few sort of disparate questions to ask you. [tape break] Okay, Steven, I\nhave a few different questions to ask you --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- that don\u2019t necessarily all go together. But when you were talking about your governess, it\nwas interesting to me that she was a very Orthodox Catholic woman --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and here you are in a Jewish family. Did it bother you that you were going to the church?",
        "A: Mm, I -- I don\u2019t recall at that time that it did, but -- no, I -- I don\u2019t recall it.",
        "Q: No. And she wasn\u2019t trying to impose her belief on you --",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: -- she was just clearly Catholic?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Huh. Did you like going to the church?",
        "A: No, not particularly. Particularly not kneeling. Kneeling in the church with -- with bare knees.",
        "Q: Ah, cause you were wearing shorts.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay. And what about then, religion in your home? Were your parents religious, was",
        "A: My parents weren\u2019t particular religious. We observed all the holidays, we didn\u2019t keep kosher.\nWe didn\u2019t observe the Sabbath, except that my paternal grandmother always furnished a bowl of\n-- of cholent for the midday meal on Saturday.",
        "Q: And can you describe what cholent 1s?",
        "A: It\u2019s a bean dish. The -- the traditional thing because it can be -- be baked the day before and it\ndoesn\u2019t have -- require work to -- to make it. The synagogue was across the -- the street from us.\nMy maternal -- my mother\u2019s uncle was -- was one of the two architects, so my father inherited\nhis father-in-law\u2019s seat directly behind the cantors in the fr -- in the front row and all I needed to\nwas look up and my mother and grandmother and sister were sitting in the front row of the\nwomen\u2019s balcony.",
        "Q: So this was an Orthodox?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: Sort of.",
        "A: I was ultra-Reform, but still, men wore hats, women were on the second floor, service was\nentirely in Hebrew, except for one prayer for the king once a year.",
        "Q: And that was in Hungarian, or Serbian?",
        "A: Serbian.",
        "Q: Serbian.",
        "A: But -- but 1n comparison to -- to -- to the Orthodox, it was considered ultra-Reform. A main\nfactor is that the synagogue had a -- had an organ.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Which is what -- what really set apart the two communities.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But on Yom Kippur -- I\u2019m -- I mean Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, we went to the services\nthen for Yithzcore, the children were chased out and we were running around the courtyard. But\nwe participated in all the services. And af -- after regular school, three afternoons a week, we had\nJewish education. A -- a teacher who was a very strong Zionist, and we were taught not just\nHebrew for the services, but we were taught the language spoken in Eretz Israel. And since\nschool went on til noon on Saturday, after lunch on Saturday was a children\u2019s service in the\nsmall subsidiary chapel, which -- which was sort of a interesting event because a -- you know,\nthere was no Kaddish itha -- and -- and the [indecipherable] at which all hell broke loose,\nbecause at two o\u2019clock the matinee started in the three cinemas and everybody was running at\nfull speeds to get out of the service to get -- to get to the --",
        "Q: To the matinee.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have to run as fast -- fast as the others because I had passes to the -- to the paper\u2019s\npress box, so I didn\u2019t have to line up to get tickets.",
        "Q: Really --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- there was a press box?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Wow. So did you go every Saturday?",
        "A: Every Saturday.",
        "Q: No kidding?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And were these mainly movies that were made in Yugoslavia --",
        "A: No, no, no --",
        "Q: -- or you show a lot of American movies?",
        "A: -- \u2019'm -- lots of American movies.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And who did you like?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, I -- we liked the cowboy movies.",
        "Q: I was going to say, that\u2019s what I was --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, right, right, oh yeah, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: So did you see Hopalong Cassidy?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember --",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember who it was.",
        "A: -- individuals, no, no. But I do remember, you know, yeah -- subtitles, it wasn\u2019t dubbed -- I\ndon\u2019t remember if it was dubbed or not. But certainly the publicity material was in Serbian. And\nthere was a movie ap-apparently when Technicolor was use, cowboys in color. And that was\ntranslated in Serbian as Kovboji 1 koloru, 1n someplace called color.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So yeah, that was --",
        "Q: And were these double features, cause at that time wi -- did see two movies or what --",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Were adults with you, or you all went alone?",

        "A: We went alone, yeah.",
        "Q: And who sat with you? Did Esther go with you and sit in the press box?",
        "A: Ah -- well, well. Ah, yeah, and my older cousins, I mean, and e-each of us brought a friend or\ntwo.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Or we took turns, I remember.",
        "Q: Now, the fact that you were not kosher, although you celebrated the holidays, you went to\nsynagogue a lot, you got a lot of training, in a certain way.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. Yes, definitely.",
        "Q: So you would have considered your childhood a -- you were in some sense religious, clearly.",
        "A: Yeah, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: Definitely.",
        "Q: Another question. Did your mother\u2019s family every approve of this marriage?",
        "A: My father never set foot in my grandmother\u2019s house.",
        "Q: You\u2019re kidding me.",
        "A: Yup. We went -- my mother visited her mother, I don\u2019t know if 1t was once a week or twice a\nweek, we met her there. I liked to go there because her brother was sending his mother old issues\nof \u201cLife\u201d magazine. And I --",
        "Q: You liked to read them?",

        "A: -- just to my father.",
        "Q: Just to your father.",
        "A: Just my father.",
        "Q: So that must have been very tough on your mother in some ways.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Very much.",
        "Q: And do you think they refused to meet him? I mean, they -- I mean, to do that for such a --",
        "A: It -- 1t just -- two worlds. And whenever we went to Budapest, it was the same thing. We --\nmy time was shared between the opulent homes of my mother\u2019s family on the hills above Buda,\nand the rather modest apartments where two of my father\u2019s sisters lived with --",

        "A: Oh, I felt that tension.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: It came to a -- a head when my aunt took me -- took us to see \u201cWizard of Oz,\u201d and I suddenly\nstarted screaming when they -- the bats appear, I wanted to ar -- I wanted to see my mother.",
        "Q: It\u2019s scary, yes.",

        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- the cinema screaming, and they had to take me back there to -- to Buda to -- so I could see\nmy mother.",
        "Q: And how old were you then, five, six [indecipherable]",
        "A: Seven?",

        "Q: So everybody had to leave the theater who was with you --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I guess, to take you there. And vacations, you took at various times during the year, or mainly\nduring the summer?",
        "A: Some at various times, most of them in the summer. My parents liked to go up in the Alps in\nwhat is now Slovenia and nearby was a camp that provided facilities for -- for children with their\ngovernesses. Are we -- I didn\u2019t get to the shore -- to the Adriatic shore til after the war. We went\nto Belgrade a couple times.

And then\ntrips to Budapest, but exciting, 1t was a exciting place.",
        "Q: Now, you know what I was thinking, given the relationship of your mother\u2019s family to your\nfather, does this mean that when they got married there was no dowry, which would have been\ntraditional, because they didn\u2019t go to the wedding, I gather.",
        "A: Oh I presume they d -- I mu -- they must have, yeah, yeah --",

And we had this big radio console with lots of dials and he was fiddling with the\ndials, and a German attack was announced, and Hungary was -- was joining, and on the way to\nre-occupy the former Hungarian provinces. And to a lot of people it was sort of a holiday at first.",
        "Q: A holiday?",
        "A: Yes, my uncle owned a bank and he took down the -- the Serbian sign and behind it was the\noriginal Hungarian name of the bank. And lot of people did that. And so the Hungarian army\nmarched in. A small amount of resistance, a few pockets of -- of -- of gunfire. And on that day or\nthe following day, a officer appeared in my father\u2019s office and ordered him out at gunpoint, and\nthat --",
        "Q: Hungarian officer did this?",
        "A: Yeah, and that was that, they -- the plant was confiscated, newspaper taken over. A Aryan\nadministrator was appointed, who kept all the charges -- directed all the charges to my father and\nmy -- my aunt\u2019s personal accounts.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: And in weeks he -- he bleeded everything that the two families had in cash. A third of the\napartment was requisitioned for housing Hungarian officers. Cook, maid, governess left the same\nday, even before the ordinance came that Jews were not allowed to have --",
        "Q: So they -- they left on their own, as far as you know?",
        "A: Yup.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So, a very intense shock. We lucked out with the -- with -- with the quartering, because the\nthree officers who were -- who were quartered in the house were -- one was a -- one was a Count\nEsterhazy, one was a Count Karolyi, the son of the prime minister just before World War I. The\nthird one I don\u2019t remember, but also a count. Great gentlemen. Oh, we understand that\nMadame\u2019s cook has left, our servant man would -- whatever the -- the -- the orderly, is at\nMadame\u2019s disposal for whatever Madame wishes. So it was -- was very tense. I used to have a\nlarge stamp collection, that was one of the many things that went with the -- the china and silver\nand crystals and every --",

        "A: No, no, th -- that we had to sell.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: Ever -- everything we owned had to sell. My mother did handicrafts, knitting, weaving, to sell\n-- to produce things that could be sold. My father became quite ill. The big event that summer, as\ntha -- I had finished fourth grade so I was a-about to enter the fi -- first year of academic high\nschool.",
        "Q: Which is gymnasium?",
        "A: Gymnasium. And the Hungarian numerus clausus law was put into effect, the number of Jews\nadmitted equaled the number of -- the proportion of the Jews of the population. So eight -- it was\ndecreed that eight Jews would be admitted. And that summer, my father had nothing else to do,\nso he coached me all summer in Hungarian literature and history, which I knew nothing about,\nwhich I had no exposure to. And so I took the exam. Were rough, very hostile questioning. I\nremember one, wh -- where did the Hungarian renaissance king defeat the Turks, the only\nsuccessful battle against the Turks. And I knew the answer was Belgrade, but I knew that if I\ngave the Serbian pronunciation, that would be curtains. I didn\u2019t know the Hungarian prun --\npronunciation. Then I remembered that Belgrade means white castle and Feher Var is white\ncastle in Hungarian, that was the -- the Hungarian name. And then I knew -- I remember enough\nof my grammar that the declension o-of Var is irregular. And to say at Belgrade, you had to say\nFeher Var otage and not Feher Var ohn. And I said that, and the guy said fine. And --",
        "Q: And you passed.",
        "A: And eventually I was one of the eight that were -- were admitted. My sister was not -- I don\u2019t\nknow if she didn\u2019t take the exam or -- or wasn\u2019t admitted, I don\u2019t remember, but she went to a\nparochial school. The -- the -- this particular order of nuns and a order of -- of teaching priests\ncalled the en -- the Piarists, rel -- related to the Jesuits but not Jesuits. They refused to honor the\nnumerus clausus and they accepted Jewish students. So I went three years to the gymnasium.\nHostile teachers sitting in the back row.",
        "Q: Jew -- the Jewish students had to sit in the back row?",
        "A: Sit in the back row. If you raised your -- raised your hand they ignored you, most of the time.\nA fren -- a father of a friend was -- a few years ago was doing a history of -- of that gymnasium,\nand I asked him to -- to look up the names. And he gave me the names and he said, \u201cThere\u2019s this\nstrange notation. The tuition is -- tuition charge is listed.\u201d So in -- you know, in addition to\neverything else they -- they charged tuition to the Jews in -- in nominally free public school. So -\n- SO it was --",
        "Q: It was really tough for you, wasn\u2019t it?",
        "A: So it was a very tough life.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Tough on m -- very tough on my parents and to see that, it was very tough. I st -- in the\nafternoons after school and in summers, I started working in this machine shop of a former\nemployee that my father bankrolled into getting this shop.

        "Q: And who came? Germans came and took him?",
        "A: Hungarian.",
        "Q: Hungarians came.",
        "A: The entire -- even after the German occupation, up to and including of loading into the -- into\nthe railroad cars, I don\u2019t remember having seen a German.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. Was all done by Hungarian gendarmerie.",
        "Q: Hm. And there\u2019s no warning that your father and these other men are going to be taken?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: They just come and they grab them and take them.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: And he\u2019s not a well man as it ts.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay, so now you\u2019re alone with your mother and your sister.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And your mother\u2019s still working or she\u2019s not allowed to work any more.",
        "A: I -- it went so fast, I don\u2019t know. I honestly don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But anyhow, the order came to move with possessions that you could carry, into this row of\ndilapidated houses, along the trai -- trai -- railroad yard. One of the nastiest memories I have is\ngetting -- going on that journey, and people were lined up, up the stairs, up to the door of the\napartment, waiting to ransack whatever we left behind, cursing at us, yelling at us, spitting at us\nas we left.",
        "Q: Did you know any of these people?",
        "A: Not that I remember. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: But like vultures they were standing --",
        "A: Like vultures, right. Except among them was our cook. She went in, she grabbed the\ncookbook and she grabbed this folder of -- this binder, and shoved into it all the artwork that she\ncould shove into it.",
        "Q: And took it. That\u2019s quite an act.",
        "A: Yup. And she gave it back to us when -- when we came back. So we went into this one room.\nMy maternal grandmother was bithu -- was moved in with us. My paternal grandmother did\nsomething else.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, the maternal, okay.",
        "A: Yup.",
        "Q: The paternal grand --",
        "A: My -- my father\u2019s oldest sister Rose married a Christian, converted at such an early age that\nby Hungarian law she was not Jewish. By German law she would have been. Not only she was\nnot deported, but my grandmother moved in with her. All of us were going one way --",
        "Q: She was going --",
        "A: -- and everybody knew that old Mrs. Friedman was living there for a year with -- with her\ndaughter, and nothing happened to her.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Huh.",
        "A: She was there when we came back.",
        "Q: How interesting.",
        "A: Yup. So --",
        "Q: Did you see the cook?",
        "A: No, not -- no, I don\u2019t -- no.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting what she took, isn\u2019t it, Steve?",
        "A: Yup.",
        "Q: That she took your mother\u2019s things, and no -- nothing else. It\u2019s quite extraordinary, actually.",
        "A: It turns out, we discovered this just a few years ago, that within this thick cookbook,\nsomehow stuck into it, were two other things. One was a blueprint of the parlor furniture that my\nmother\u2019s uncle, the architect designed for her as his wedding gift. That\u2019s framed in my -- my\nsister\u2019s apartment. And the other a slim diary that my mother had kept, which is sobering,\nbecause it\u2019s two and a half years of my sister from her birth, and about four months of me after\nmy birth.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And then they --",
        "Q: And then it stops?",
        "A: And then it stops. So --",
        "Q: And it\u2019s about you as a [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh, yeah, yeah --",
        "Q: -- it\u2019s just every detail of what you --",
        "A: -- like every detail, measurements, not just height and weight, but the he -- circumference of\nthe head and --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- and -- and food, and how much food and how much weight, yup.",
        "Q: That must --",
        "A: And first words and -- and everything.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That\u2019s extraordinary to have, isn\u2019t it?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yup. So -- so that\u2019s where we wound up.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s this ghetto like?",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t a connected ghetto. It was several areas dissected by major roads that were\nopen. And, you know, broken down old houses that were requisitioned and we were squeezed\ninto them. Terrible sanitary conditions, terrible. Some communal food, but that was terrible. No\nmedical attention whatsoever. But you\u2019re still allowed to go from one to another. And I, working\nin a plant that was doing some military work, had a pass to get out of the -- the ghetto.",
        "Q: Is this in an -- it\u2019s not enclosed, is there a fence, or --",
        "A: There was some kind of a gate, guarded by --",
        "Q: There was?",
        "A: Yeah, it was enclosed at night. I -- but not -- not -- not as --",
        "Q: Not like a wall?",
        "A: -- not like the Warsaw. Yeah, not a wall, no.",
        "Q: Did you have toilet facilities in your apartment? No.",
        "A: A privy in the -- in the back.",
        "Q: In the back?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Water?",
        "A: Like everybody else, y-y-yeah. Artesian well in the back.",
        "Q: Was there a kitchen? No kitchen.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No, so it\u2019s all communal eating --",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: -- which is not eating.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So you -- do you start being hungry?",
        "A: No, I work outside. My boss\u2019s wife fed me lunch, and had a satchel for me to take back to the\nfamily. So I was probably better off than most people. But I was in the shop on my birthday,\nJune six, 1944, and I her -- when we heard about the -- when I heard about the -- about\nNormandy. And I must have been the first one to come into the ghetto to -- to tell people about it.\nI -- I don\u2019t know, I -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s -- when I recall I -- 1t was sort of a hothouse atmosphere. I mean,\nwe had, at age 13 we had this -- this horribly serious love affairs with 12 year old girls.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: You too?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. All -- I mean, everything was -- was very intense and very concentrated and very pres --\nprecocious for age, shall I say so.",
        "Q: So when you say affair, you mean there were -- there was a lot of sexual relations.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Was this shocking for the adults? Were they all like what\u2019s going on here, or did nobody care\nany more?",
        "A: Nobody cared any more.",
        "Q: Nobody cared. And did -- did it feel as if -- well, we may die, so -- or is --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely. And things can get only worse was -- I think that was\nthe [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "Q: Right. So did you have a steady girlfriend?",
        "A: Yes. I was more enamored of her than she was of me, but --",
        "Q: Well, it happens, doesn\u2019t it?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And did you bring her some of the food that you\u2019ve brought back?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. But that only was -- that was -- a-again, I can go back to the -- this thick book by\nthe gentleman from Columbia University.",
        "Q: Really? [indecipherable |",
        "A: No, no, no, no, they -- the gentleman who did the two volume on the genocide in Hungary.",
        "Q: Oh, Braham.",
        "A: Br -- br -- yeah, Braham.",
        "Q: Braham, yes.",
        "A: I mean, I can get all the dates out of it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I was one of the main plaintiffs in the -- in the slave labor suit, because I -- because I had\nbetter documentation than anybody else, because I just went to Braham\u2019s book and copied out all\nthe dates.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So mid-June were -- order came, leave the apartments with one piece of luggage. We\u2019re lined\nup facing the railroad yards. We were put into these railroad cars and that was just a very short\ntrip to Bacsalmas which was a -- a village that Hungarians took over and made it as the ghetto\nfor putting in people from Nowy Sad and the whole region.",
        "Q: And that became -- that\u2019s the ghetto that ends -- ends up being a weigh station to other places.",
        "A: To -- right, right --",
        "Q: Right. Cause you\u2019re not there for hugely long time, right?",
        "A: No, five, six days, I think, you know.",
        "Q: Is that all?",
        "A: I think so.",
        "Q: And who of your family goes? It\u2019s your sister and your mother and your maternal\ngrandmother?",
        "A: My -- my a -- maternal grandmother. My Uncle [indecipherable], my aunt and her mother,\nand her sister-in-law, German speaking Gerda. That\u2019s it. Now I\u2019m told, I don\u2019t remember that,\nbut I\u2019m told that the church bells were ringing and that te deum masses were held in the churches\nas the trains pulled out.",
        "Q: Like a celebration.",
        "A: Yup.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So Bacsalmas was -- was even more -- I mean -- I mean that -- housed in a chicken coop, I\nbelieve, terribly cramped. We kids were running around the camp, all -- that\u2019s all I remember is -\n- 1S We -- running around, all kinds of rumors about ways of getting out, some of which turned\nout true. There was one train -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not sure I can reconstruct the whole story, but\nit\u2019s in Braham\u2019s book. Eight --",
        "Q: Can -- I -- I hate to interrupt you --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- we have to take a break --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- we have to change the tape.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: Steve, you were talking about people saying there were ways to escape somehow.",
        "A: Well there was rumors flying everywhere. It turns out that two tr -- one train -- I don\u2019t know\nhow many cars, but one trainload, mostly of prominent people was diverted and sent to -- and\nwent to Switzerland, maybe 100 - 150 people. A much smaller group which may have been just\none car, was diverted and taken to Budapest and opened up there. And one of -- one of my\nclassmates from grade school who now lives in Israel was in that group, and it was a relative of\nhers who was in the Hungarian equivalent of the ghetto leadership, whatever it was called,\narranged for that carload to be brought to Budapest, which at that time was still quite free. See ha\n-- the Hungarians -- yo -- as -- as eager as the individual gendarmes were to do the job, the horti -\n- Admiral Horthy and -- and his government was not that e-eager. So they started on the\nperiphery of the -- re-occupied provinces from slova -- Slovakia, Transylvania and -- and Backa\nin the south. And delayed deportation from Budapest as we -- as long as they could. And so my\nfriend Lilly survived in Budapest.",
        "Q: This was your girlfriend?",
        "A: No, this is a fre --",
        "Q: Oh, this is ano -- other friend.",
        "A: -- a classmate.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And she survived in Budapest?",
        "A: Yeah, she and her mother survived in Budapest and walked back -- walked back and got back\nto Subotica. Subotica was liberated in October, \u201944. We w -- we were deported in -- in June, and\nby f -- by October, the partisans were there.",
        "Q: Huh. So these trains were diverted by the Jewish Council? I mean, they were sa -- some --",
        "A: I tha -- that one -- one carload --",
        "Q: That one car?",
        "A: -- was -- was -- my understanding 1s that it was diverted by the Jewish Council.",
        "Q: Huh. So did -- when you heard this did you believe it and did you try to get on these trains, or\nwhat?",
        "A: Well, we tried, but I mean -- one of my classmates, whom my wife met once, whom all the\nother, the few survivors left bitterly hate -- bitterly dislike. He was a [indecipherable] from day\none. He was on that group. He went -- a-after the war he came back, he went to Israel, he -- he\nwas appointment secretary for s -- for some minister, but he assured everybody that he was\nrunning the country. You know, I -- total -- impossible character, but he was telling us about all\nof these things, so -- so it was -- it wasn\u2019t easy to believe him. I mean, none of us believed him.\nBut anyhow, it was just a few days before the real train ride took place.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: 60 some people per car. No food, no water, no sanitation. People dying. And then the doors\nopened and we were in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Now, go back for a moment.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you get a notice, or they just say, out, the -- just -- th-the same way they did with the\nother?",
        "A: Yeah, right, yes, just out, yeah. Line up, and --",

        "Q: Bacsalmas. Is that right, Bacsalmas?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That you were just running around like crazy.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What was that? I mean, why were you running around? What -- and --",
        "A: Well, chasing rumors, trying to find food, trying -- seeing if possible we could get out. Just --\njust busy-ness, but I -- that\u2019s what I remember 1s -- is this relentless restlessness of trying to do\nsomething.",
        "Q: Right. Were the adults as restless as you were?",
        "A: No, no, the a-adults were very passive.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: My grandmother had had mental problems before. She\u2019s not a Freda Kahlo, but like Kahlo\nshe -- she lost a leg in a streetcar accident, I don\u2019t know when. And she had -- she had mental\ntrauma. She was going crazy, there\u2019s just no question about that. And it -- my mother was -- was\nvery, very upset. And so getting out of there was just -- you know, just -- we just had to get out\nof there, and that\u2019s why I was never in that place.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t stay with them, if you --",
        "A: I crawled in at night, I guess, but I don\u2019t remember that.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: At dawn I was out of there.",
        "Q: But it clearly is very chaotic for you there.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And did you have an idea where they were sending people?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No idea?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And you had never heard of Auschwitz?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And what had you been hearing about the killing of Jews? Cause here you have two years\nbetween \u00b042 and \u201944, and so many Jews are killed in \u201941 and \u201942. Do you hear anything?",
        "A: Yeah, we heard some. There were -- there were a couple people who had escaped from -- I\ndon\u2019t know whether it\u2019s from the camp, but certainly from the -- from Galicia, from the --\noccupied Poland. And we were warning, but nobody listened to that.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] didn\u2019t believe it.",
        "A: No. No.",
        "Q: Do you remember this train ride?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you see it?",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Are you sitting, standing?",
        "A: Mostly standing, sometimes pushing thr -- my way to the crack at the door. Certainly I wasn\u2019t\ntall enough to push myself to the -- to the barred window.",
        "Q: How tall are you? Cause you\u2019re now 14 -- or 13, you\u2019re 13.",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t know how tall I was, I was -- I was sort of reasonable ral -- height for my age. Not\n-- not necessarily very tall. Tall enough to survive the -- the -- the selection. Yeah, I remember\nthat -- that train ride quite well. And I remember that chaos that greeted us. Yells, shouts, dogs\nbarking, people shoved out of the cars. My grandmother sitting on a pile of -- of suitcases and\nstuff in her gown, with her prosthesis lacking, waving to us and saying -- saying, \u201cI\u2019m healthy,\nI\u2019m healthy.\u201d [indecipherable] I forget now what she said, but she cheerfully waved to us. And\nwe were lined up. First I was with my mother and sister and then they -- women to one side, men\nto the other side. And that\u2019s the last time I saw my mother. And eventually five of us, we were\nmarched past this SS officer in white gloves, whether it\u2019s Mengele or not I don\u2019t know, I -- I\ncouldn\u2019t tell, couldn\u2019t remember. But I guess I was tall enough and healthy looking enough that I\nwas waved this way and not that way. So I --",

Eventually rushed, always rushed from barrack to barrack, tha -- at --\nat -- at double time with guards barking and hitting. Thrown some mis -- ill -- ill-fitting prison\nuniforms and broken down shoes, and marched into the compound in a barrack across from the\nGypsy barracks, where there were about 10,000 -- abi -- about a thousand kids my age.",

        "A: That was a barrack only for kids.",
        "Q: Now, are you tattooed at this time?",

Appel started, and the entire\ncompound was on block -- on lockdown because one number was out of order. And I remember\nvery clearly this very large SS officer, and this small, owlish, Polish kapo came to get me and\nmarched me in front of all of the assembled people back to my barracks and I remember clearly\nthe Polish kapo whispering to me in Polish, \u201cIf you were not this young, you would be long\ndead.\u201d Yup, I -- for a day I upset the entire accounting system. How they knew that, I don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "Q: Wait a minute.",
        "A: How they knew that --",
        "Q: How -- how are you upsetting the counting system? You don\u2019t --",
        "A: The barrack was short one and the revier was -- was one more than was supposed to be.",
        "Q: Supposed to have. And were -- were they identifying you by name?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I have no --",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know. You have no idea.",
        "A: -- th -- the -- no, they found me and --",
        "Q: Now you said this guy, the Polish kapo spoke to you in Polish.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did you understand Polish?",
        "A: Serbian and Polish are --",
        "Q: Are so close?",
        "A: -- Si -- six weeks later I -- I was fluent in Polish because I was working for the Polish kapos.",
        "Q: Really? Huh.",
        "A: So okay. So you know enough about Auschwitz, you know that camps C and D were largely\nwarehouses of labor personnel. German civilians came in, selection was set up, usually in the --\nnaked, not always. They selected the workers and those people were marched out ta -- a -- first\ninto compound A and then registered, tattooed and sent out. Digression. A number of years ago\nat Pittsburgh, we hosted a small exhibit from the Auschwitz museum. There was an opening\nnight for the survivors. Was a big map of Auschwitz. And seven or eight people there asked me\nto take them over to the map and show them where they had been, because most of them were\nthere three, four days.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I was there four months. And I have a reasonably good graphic memory and so I showed\nthem anyway. So that was camp life. At that time wa --",
        "Q: Wa -- when -- when you\u2019re showing them the map, they\u2019re looking at the outside\ncommandoes that they were on, they didn\u2019t know that they were all --",
        "A: No, they were not on there, they were all in one of the --",
        "Q: So they were -- but they didn\u2019t know where they were?",
        "A: The people who were there only three days were there in one --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- in either C or D.",
        "Q: Right, and they didn\u2019t know that.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know that.",
        "Q: Of course, right.",
        "A: So the boys barrack was treated like every other, you know, once a day allowed to run to the\nra -- latrine. You know, you learn things on the way, like a elder -- older inmate telling you to --\nto pick up a pebble on the way to the latrine, so you have something to wipe yourself with.",
        "Q: A pebble?",
        "A: Yes. Food, ladled out from these big cauldrons. Somehow you had -- an -- and the slice of\nbread, somehow you had to save enough to have enough on -- on the black market to get yourself\na broken down tin cup, otherwise the soup was ladled in your hand.",
        "Q: So you were not given a cup at all?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Nothing.",
        "A: No. And we could see people coming and going in the barracks, in the barrack that we were\nin, nobody was coming, and the only going was -- was to the selection and to the -- to the\ncrematoria. My -- all my classmates, one by one, becoming walking corpses, musselmanner, and\ndying. I rem -- I mean, I still remember the sequence of the last three or four, until I was alone.",
        "Q: Until you were alone?",
        "A: Out of the group from Subotica.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And how do you account for your being able to [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, one thing my gra -- my governess did me a great service. The kapos were all red fr --\nwere all green triangles, German political prisoner -- German criminals, and they needed an\ninterpreter and one of them came around asking for an interpreter and I volunteered. I spoke\nmuch better German than he did, much purer Volksdeutsche than he did. And so I became an\ninterpreter, and one of the privileges that came with it at -- after the soup was ladled out, you\nwere allowed to scrape out the bottom of the -- of the pot. And that was the --",
        "Q: That was the [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- increment that kept me alive.",
        "Q: Were you losing weight?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: You was -- you lost a lot of weight?",
        "A: Yes. So, as I say, one by one, there were about seven or eight of us that were together, that\nknew each other, were together, and then --",
        "Q: And they died from starvation, or they were killed?",
        "A: Yup. They was -- died from starvation.",
        "Q: They died of starvation. When you say the word musselmanner now --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Is that a word that you knew then?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: This is what the terminology was?",
        "A: Yes, this shuffling corpses, glazed eyes, yeah. That was the definitely the -- the term. So then\ncame August, this night in August we were locked down. I remember very clearly yelling,\nshouting, firing of weapons. And we didn\u2019t know what was going on. We started singing, just to\ngive ourselves strength or something. And the following morning, as an interpreter, I could be\nout in front when the soup arrived. And I looked around, the row of barracks was empty. There\nwere inmates clearing and later whitewashing the barracks. And what was most startling is that\nthe kapos that supervised them had red triangles. So one o -- one of them, man by name Tadek,\ncame over and said that he needed an interpreter who spoke Polish, German and Hungarian. And\nI said Serbian and Polish are close enough, I volunteered. And so that day I moved across to the\nbarrack that he supervised.",
        "Q: Which was E, into E. Or is that not --",
        "A: I -- if you give -- show me a ma -- if you give me a map, I\u2019 Il -- [Il --",
        "Q: Okay [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- Pll locate the number.",
        "Q: But le-let me ask you something. Why was it so shocking to you that those who were\nsupervising that barrack, where they had ex -- grabbed the Gypsies --",
        "A: No, supervising the new -- new inmates, so it [indecipherable] the barracks.",
        "Q: Wa -- why -- oh, and why was it surprising that they were political prisoners?",
        "A: Because -- because up til then we were surrounded by the --",
        "Q: By the greens?",
        "A: By the greens.",
        "Q: By the criminals.",
        "A: Yes, except a coup -- one or two in the higher administration of the camp.",
        "Q: Right, right. And having the political prisoners meant it would be better in some way, was\nthat true?",
        "A: Well, it meant it would be different. The political prisoners at -- in Auschwitz as well as in --\nlater in Niederorschel, in front of the Germans were as loud and cussing. They were as adroit\nwith their batons in hitting you as the criminals. But when the Germans were gone, then -- then\nthings were different.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Which wasn\u2019t true with the criminals.",
        "A: Which was not true with the criminals.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so I --",
        "Q: So you joined them.",
        "A: So I joined them, and --",
        "Q: What was Tadek like?",
        "A: He was a university student, communist. Caught up in the -- the big catching up ca -- round\nup of Polish intellectuals. Not a terribly bright guy, but eventu -- I mean, he promised he would\ntake care of me. There were others. There was a somewhat older guy, a kapo of one of the other\nbarracks, who had been a c-communist organizer in Yugoslavia, so he -- he helped me\noccasionally with things I couldn\u2019t translate. And there was a third one by name of Piotr, who\nwas a Russian studying in Poland, who was caught up and was deported with the Poles. And he\nwas by far the most entrepreneurial and enterprising of all of them.",
        "Q: Can you explain what you mean, why -- ho --",
        "A: Well, black market was -- was the staff of life in Auschwitz. Everything could be had. We\n[indecipherable] work with Tadek and Piotr. They -- the compound backed onto the railroad side\n[indecipherable]. We would -- when a train arrived, we would be there sweeping the gravel\nbetween the last barrack and the -- and the electrified fence. Guard towers at either end.\nOccasionally whis -- whistle would sound, you would look up and tins of sardines, other thing\nliberatable. You know, liberating was the -- the codeword to stealing, or flying over the fence,\nfrom the inmates who were cleaning the trains. So that\u2019s how you started accumulating black\nmarket goods. Piotr -- well, I had my -- my duties, I was an interpreter. Very often German\npeople were lined up, German foreman will -- would come. I would walk behind them and do\nwhatever translating, if -- if they had questions for the inmates. And most inmates always\npretended that they didn\u2019t know German, whether they knew it or not. So I would translate.\nOccasionally I actually esc -- was ordered to go up to the front, to the SS barracks at the top of\nthe compound and escort the German to the -- to the site, to whatever barrack they were selecting\nfrom, and then escort them back.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: Past the -- passing the gallows every day twice, it was not -- not pleasant. But in addition to\nthat, eventually Piotr organized a roof repair detail. And we went from compound to compound\npretending to patch roofs.",
        "Q: Pretending?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I have a -- a -- I don\u2019t have a full sense of equilibrium, I have a fear of heights. I would have\nremembered if I had been on a roof, I\u2019ve never been to -- on a roof.",
        "Q: Did he go up on a roof?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: He went up?",
        "A: Yeah, we -- we had this -- this cart with rolls of felt paper, barrel of pitch, both of them very\ngood for hiding things as you go from -- as you\u2019re frisked from compound to compound. And\nthey -- you know, they pretended to be patching roofs and -- and most of -- I mean it was spent\ntrading black market goods, trading lists of prisoners to be smuggled out to the outside. Typical\nday to day work of resistance.",
        "Q: So you were the ground crew --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- for the roofer.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: I guess, huh?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And unfortunately we have to stop the tape again.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: Steve.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: When we last were taping, you were talking about not being a roofer, but walking around\nwith -- was it Tadek who was --",
        "A: No, that\u2019s -- that was Piotr.",
        "Q: Piotr, who was going on the roof.",
        "A: A-Actually, I -- I will correct myself. I was on the roof of our old barracks, number 12, with\ncouple others, there was an opening in the roof. And we tried to pull out my last classmate.\nLowered a rope and tried to pull him up, and he didn\u2019t have the strength in his arms to -- to hold\non. That\u2019s -- that time I remember being in the roof, and I remember this incident because a\nnumber of years ago, when I was at the tekneon, this -- the guy\u2019s sister came to see me because\nshe understood that I had -- had seen him in Auschwitz, and she wanted the story of her brother.\nBut that\u2019s the only thing -- only time I remember being on the roof.",
        "Q: And why were you trying to pull him out?",
        "A: Trying to save him.",
        "Q: Uh-huh --",
        "A: Trying to get --",
        "Q: -- so you were -- you were going to put him someplace else.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: And you were able to be on the roof in spite of your problems with --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But that must have been a horrible day then, not being able to pull him out.",
        "A: Yeah, right, yeah.",
        "Q: And wa -- going around fixing roofs, did he -- did Piotr actually fix roofs or was it mainly --",
        "A: Oh, I think, yeah. I mean this -- the barracks were shoddily built and shod -- and totally u --\nnot maintained and so there were roof leaks and we had pitch and felt paper and we did -- the\ncrew did some repairs, but -- but that was really a cover for -- for black market operations. He\nhad a girlfriend, a female kapo in -- in one of the compounds in -- in Mexico, the -- the new --\nthe new women\u2019s compounds in the other side of the main road. And we were -- often went\nthere. I met my sister there. I found out that she wa -- she was there and we met. Sh -- this was\nlate in the fall, and she was in a short sleeve dress, reddish hair, maybe centimeter long, no -- no\nlonger than that. Face and arms red raw from the wind. She remembers that I was this fat, that\u2019s\nhow she described me. Well, probably in -- in Auschwitz comparisons, I was fatter than -- than\nwhat her image was. So I -- I found out that she was being shipped out on a transport and\nwhatever black market goods I had, I cashed in and managed to get her a -- a sweater and scarf\nand gloves before she was shipped out. Managed to get somebody to get it to her, after the -- the\n-- 0-on exit. But we went everywhere.",
        "Q: So he had the right to go everywhere, whether it was [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, we -- well [indecipherable] right -- yeah. Frisking at ev -- every entrance and every exit\nfrom a compound. In Auschwitz the -- the common black market currency was a gold watch.\nEverything was counted in -- in terms of gold watches. And I was thin enough, I usually had\ndozen or more gold watches strapped to my thigh, so we went through frisking and I was never\ncaught.",
        "Q: How could that be?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: But you had them on your thigh and they didn\u2019t --",
        "A: Yeah, under my pants, and they didn\u2019t frisk that far down. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. So\nKanada was a great place to go because lots of -- lots of good could be interchanged. They were\nke -- contact with the under -- with the Polish underground, they were -- you could pass\ninformation to the outside commandoes and they -- they were working outside the fence, and\nthey -- the Polish underground was never more than a couple kilometers from the perimeter. So\nwe knew about the -- the Sonderkommando uprising.",
        "Q: Did you hear it?",
        "A: We her -- I don\u2019t remember hearing, but I do remember the -- the extreme anxiety and the\nextreme unusual severity of the -- the controls in the watchtowers and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s all I\nremember about it.",
        "Q: We -- were you anywhere near when the women were hung because of the stealing of powder\nfrom [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, no, n-n-no, no.",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t?",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t remember. I mean I\u2019m just not [indecipherable]",
        "Q: You just don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: When you went to see your sister, wasn\u2019t she on the same transport with you when she came\ninto Auschwitz?",
        "A: Yes, but then we were separated, and she was separated from our mother right -- almost right\naway. She had the information that our mother was -- my mother had asthma and she thought\nthat -- that she had an asthma attack and -- and that she was not yet dead she wa -- when she was\ncarted away with the -- the day\u2019s corpses to the crematorium. It\u2019s the best she could determine.\nSo -- so you know, th -- I last saw her in June, and this must have been September, thereabouts.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I remember it was beginning to get cold.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t know until then that she was alive.",
        "A: [knew -- right, right, right,",
        "Q: You thought she might have been --",
        "A: Right. Well, either shipped out or s --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- killed, I don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And her condition, was she okay?",
        "A: She was emaciated, and as I said there, you know, totally unprotected from the weather.",
        "Q: Yeah. So what did it mean for you to be in this group? Were they really doing resistance,\nwere they doing it --",
        "A: Well, it was something to do. It was a will to live. I mean, seemed to be some purpose to life\nrather than just waiting to be carted away to the crematorium. And you know, I think back, I -- I\n-- the chance of surviving, the expectation to survive was very low, and you just did whatever\nyou could to keep yourself busy. And -- and quite frankly, on occasions they -- they certainly --\nthe kapos certainly used me for being much smaller to get into places where they couldn\u2019t get\ninto, to do hand-offs that -- that they felt they were too exposed, so yeah, I -- I made myself\nuseful any -- any way I could.",
        "Q: So what -- what would it be for you to hand off? Is this a bartering system?",
        "A: No, ma -- it was mostly issues of -- of handing off lists of prisoners to the -- to the outside\ncommandoes, to be sent out to the -- to the -- to the out -- Polish underground on the outside.",
        "Q: So people would have names, so they would know --",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: -- what was going on.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And where do the lists come from? They weren\u2019t -- w-were they paying for [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, all the orderlies in the -- in the -- in the offices were also political prisoners.",
        "Q: So there\u2019s a very extensive underground system --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- that\u2019s going on.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And are you involved with people who are mainly doing informational resistance, or are they\nalso connected with the people who are going to do an uprising?",
        "A: There was no -- I -- I -- I -- not in Auschwitz, there was no -- I don\u2019t recall any talk of any\nphysical resistance because it was just -- just not possible. [indecipherable] was different.",
        "Q: But there was an uprising, so that there was physical resistance because the crematoria was\nblown up, right?",
        "A: Yeah, well -- well, yeah, but the Sonderkommando had privileges that even the --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- the kapos in the regular compounds didn\u2019t have. They [indecipherable] access to food, to --\nto alcohol, to bribe the -- the guard and all kinds of other things that -- I mean, they were\nprivileged prisoners [indecipherable]",
        "Q: But when you -- when one says privileged, they\u2019re still in a horrible situation.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, of course, yeah.",
        "Q: Right, so it\u2019s privileged in a very --",
        "A: Right, right, and very relevant, very relevant --",
        "Q: -- specific [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- yes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Would you have considered yourself a privileged prisoner?",
        "A: Oh definitely, definitely.",
        "Q: But were you actually protected from selections?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You were?",
        "A: Especially in the fall when things got severe, th-they hid me. One time I was hiding in a\nlatrine, up to my mouth in excrement. Then I had to find a -- the lavatory barracks and sneak in\nand get a -- take a sh -- cold shower with clothes on to get some of the smell off. Yeah, they\nprotected me, yes.",
        "Q: So they protected you, it\u2019s not like as if you were in a protected kommando so that the SS\nwouldn\u2019t get you. It\u2019s that the -- that these men themselves were protecting you.",
        "A: Yes, right, right, yes.",
        "Q: But going into latrine doesn\u2019t sound --",
        "A: Well, that --",
        "Q: -- to a normal perso --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- regular person, like it\u2019s terribly much protection.",
        "A: Well, if that was the place to hide, then that was the place to hide.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yup.",
        "Q: When you think about this now, thinking about yourself as you\u2019re close to 14, or thirt -- you\nwere really 13 actually --",
        "A: Yup, right.",
        "Q: -- right?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Doing this, can you conceive of yourself in this, or just this seems like, well it\u2019s my history,\nit\u2019s just the way it was.",
        "A: Oh, I th -- yeah, I can conceive myself doing it, I -- I did what I could, I -- I -- I -- I\u2019m grateful\nto have had the opportunity to -- to do something, not to just sit.",
        "Q: Now these -- these -- when you say that these are Polish kapos, or --",
        "A: Yeah, yes.",
        "Q: -- you -- you mean that they\u2019re Polish Gentiles --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- these are not Jews.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Right. But they know you\u2019re Jewish.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And there\u2019s not a problem in terms of [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, they were violent anti-Semite, all of them, without exception.",
        "Q: They were?",
        "A: Oh yes. Without exception.",
        "Q: So what was that like for you? On the one hand they\u2019re protecting you, on the other hand --",
        "A: Well -- well, now, for the duration of the hostilities, they suspended their -- their animosity, or\nhatred, or whatever you want to call it. But you -- you know, the ordinary talk, ex -- especially\nafter a few vodka, the cuss terms for Jews was -- was as sharp as -- as the terms that the SS\nguards used. No -- no distinction.",
        "Q: Did it make you feel f -- strange, as a Jewish person, or not want to be Jewish, or that didn\u2019t\noccur to you?",
        "A: That didn\u2019t occur to me, no. Just was part of the surroundings.",
        "Q: So those years of living under the Hungarian occupation, while there\u2019s not violence so much -",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- there\u2019s still a lot of anti-Semitism. So do you think you start getting used to it, you just\nexpect this to be the case for a lot of people?",
        "A: Yeah, yes, definitely.",
        "Q: Cause certainly it doesn\u2019t seem to be easy to accept it.",
        "A: It definitely was something to accept, yeah.",
        "Q: Now, do you kno -- are -- are you still involved at -- where are you living? Are you living in\nB2 bi -- D, or are you living 1n the same place that you began?",
        "A: In the same co -- in -- in -- in compound D, but in one of the barracks on the opposite side and\nfurther down.",
        "Q: Than when you started.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes. And are you with any Jews?",

        "Q: No.",
        "A: I mean, the front office in the barracks 1s -- is -- you know, maybe eight or 10 orderlies, and\nby that time they were all Lodz Jews. And then in the back, or -- eight - 900, thousand inmates\nwho rotate out on -- on very short time basis. That was the life.",
        "Q: And what do you understand what the Nazis are doing? I -- you -- you know that they\u2019re\nkilling Jews in Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Yes, yup.",
        "Q: And are you hearing things about the progress of the war also? Are the rumors going around -",
        "A: Ah yes, some of the smuggling was the other way, from the underground on the outside, so\nyes, we knew something about the -- well, in -- in that location we knew a lot more about the --\nthe eastern front than the -- than the western front.",
        "Q: So is some of your -- not desire to live, but ability to keep going, also a function of thinking\nwell maybe the war will end, maybe they\u2019 Il be ri --",
        "A: Oh yes, de -- yes, by that time it was beginning to -- to look like that, yeah.",

        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: Are there many kids around your age, or are they mostly gone?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember if the kid\u2019s barrack continued. Now, among the later transport -- among the\nBudapest Jews that came later, July or -- or August, there were quite a few father son groups --\npairs. And I think among the Lodz Jews also. So you\u2019d did doos -- did see some kids teen -- in\ntheir teens.",
        "Q: But they don\u2019t necessarily stay very long in Auschwitz?",

        "A: Oh, it\u2019s ha -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s Just baggage, it -- it -- very ha-hard to carry around. Lot of ri --\nwriters have -- have said that. Kids had an easier time surviving than adults, that you were not\nconditioned by civilization, and I -- that\u2019s definitely the case that I remembered. That I dare to do\nthings that adults would -- would not do.",
        "Q: Do you think that you became more primitive in some way?",

And you either\ngot out of it, or you didn\u2019t get out of it. And I don\u2019t know what in my make-up helped me to -- to\nget out of it, other than the -- my governess\u2019s effort to teach me German.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] terrible governess. You saw a lot of hangings.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was that the first time you saw a dead person?",
        "A: No, in -- no, in 1941, at -- when the Hungarians came in, 13 young people were hung in the\npublic square, including the -- the rabbi\u2019s son, and I remember seeing that hanging. So I -- I --\nyes, I\u2019d seen a hanging before.",

        "Q: And did you ever say to them, how can you --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. Were you ever afraid that they would ask you to do that kind of thing?",
        "A: No.",

        "A: No. They would --",
        "Q: They wouldn\u2019t have done it?",
        "A: No, they wouldn\u2019t have asked me, no. But, I mean, I have some recollections which I\u2019m not\nvery proud of. I remember one day very clearly having a snack before di-di-distribution of dinner\n-- in -- in -- a Slice of bread, and three slices of cheese on it, and going outside for a\n[indecipherable] standing for the appel, and one of them said, \u201cWhat is the ration tonight?\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cOne of these slices of cheese.\u201d And I was eating three or four as a snack. And another time\n-- shoes were always an issue, and mine were -- were again, very beaten up and Tadek saw a pair\non a man, a pair of ski boots that he thought would be good for me and made him take them off\nand take my broken down shoes, and he gave him a loaf of bread. And I didn\u2019t feel good about\nthat.",
        "Q: But you now have ski boots?",
        "A: Yes. Yeah. So that was -- that was life in Auschwitz. I became very callous.",
        "Q: Yeah, makes perfect sense though.",
        "A: Clawing t -- clawing through life.",
        "Q: Was there a canteen in Auschwitz that you knew about where you could go and get, I don\u2019t\nknow, juice or cigarettes or something. Was there a place that people could exchange?",
        "A: Yeah, there was a canteen in th -- I-I mean, I understand Auschwitz itself there were several\ncanteen --",
        "Q: You mean Auschwitz one?",
        "A: -- in -- in -- in Birkenau, Auschwitz two, I think there was a canteen. I don\u2019t know who had\naccess to it, but we -- we got things with black market things.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t go to the canteen?",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019d -- I'd been to the canteen many times.",
        "Q: You were?",
        "A: Yeah,",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But bartering.",
        "Q: As opposed to --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- purch -- I don\u2019t know what they purchased.",
        "A: There -- yeah, there was some -- there was some scrip. Yeah, everything was bartered\n[indecipherable], passes to the women\u2019s b -- to the -- to the prisoner\u2019s brothel was so many gold\nwatches. And then you got --",
        "Q: So many gold watches.",
        "A: -- and then you got a pass.",
        "Q: And did you know people who went?",
        "A: Yup.",
        "Q: Did you go?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. Could you have gone?",

        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.",
        "A: The kapos around me all had girlfriends in a -- in -- kapos in the -- in the women\u2019s barracks,\nthey didn\u2019t have to go to the brothel.",
        "Q: And were they ab -- they were able to go in and out of the women\u2019s barracks?",
        "A: Well, one time I -- I remember -- I remember one times very clearly Piotr was in bed with this\nwoman and an SS came in and I was in the out -- outer room, and all I -- and all of these women\norderlies had these beautifully elaborate ta -- beds -- beds with silk bedcovers and silk pillows,\neverything pilfered or bar -- bartered from Kanada. And all I could think of is slide under bed\n[indecipherable] bed with the bedcover to the floor, and then it was over and they started asking\neach other whether they had seen me or whether the SS woman had taken me, and then I climbed\nout from under the bed. I remember that.",
        "Q: You just went under because you wanted the feel of the --",
        "A: Ah no, I just slid --",
        "Q: Oh, slid on top?",
        "A: -- I slid on the floor, I slid on the floor.",
        "Q: I see, I see.",
        "A: Under the -- and the bedcover came all the way down to the floor.",
        "Q: Oh, oh, I see.",
        "A: Yeah. So --",
        "Q: Did you know -- di -- did people talk about who were the women in the brothels?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember ever -- but when I got to Niederorschel which will sooner -- come\nsooner or later, one of the questions I was asked, is it true that women were selected on their\nlooks to go to work in brothels? And I said no, I don\u2019t know if anything that -- that -- ?ve seen\nmany women\u2019s selections, I\u2019ve never seen women being selected on the basis of looks. I lied, but\nI --",
        "Q: You lied?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Because I\u2019d seen that.",
        "Q: That they were selected and you knew they were going to be prostitutes?",
        "A: Right. But to these men --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t want them to know.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Steve, how did you know that they were selecting women to go to the brothels?",
        "A: Because kapos were talking about it.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And comparing the -- particularly the women kapos were comparing the -- the condition -- the\nrelative conditions of the various brothels, that\u2019s why, you know.",
        "Q: Comparing --",
        "A: Some -- some were better than others. You know, don\u2019t ask me why, but that\u2019s --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- that\u2019s what they were talking about, so I knew what this meant.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So you were in Auschwitz for how long? Six months?",
        "A: From mid -- end of June til mid-October, July, August, September, four months.",
        "Q: Four months. So you leave after the uprising?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Now what are the conditions? How -- how come you get out of Auschwitz and go to\nNiederorschel?",
        "A: Well, the conditions were getting harsher and harsher, and the kapos decided to smuggle me\nout. And they were looking for a safe transport because the word was that sometimes people\nwere turned around at the railroad siding and taken to the gas chambers. So this one transport\nappeared safe, they pushed me in the line. I -- I got tattooed -- no, everything gets counted. One\nof the kapos, I don\u2019t know if it was Tadek, I don\u2019t remember any more, went up, who -- who will\ntrade places with this boy, we\u2019ll give you food and we\u2019|l make sure that you get out on another\ntransport. And this man volunteered and I was pushed in. Piotr slipped me a gold watch in my\nhand, he -- for the doctor. So we were stripped, examined. Had a Jewish inmate doctor\nexamining. I passed him the watch, he said, \u201cThank you, I would have passed you anyhow.\u201d",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. Next station is tattooing and this inmate working, these huge, crude numbers and he\nlooks up at me and he gives the tiniest number that I\u2019ve ever seen.",
        "Q: Do you still have it?",
        "A: Yup. But you know, that 1s -- it\u2019s almost illegible now because it\u2019s so small.",
        "Q: Right. And your number is?",
        "A: B13174. Shower, cold shower in October. At the next station Piotr appears and shoves a\nbundle of clothes in my hand, including the -- the ski boots, which I left with him and he -- and\nso I was quite well dressed. I have -- I\u2019m sure it was a woman -- woman \u2019s tight fitting ski jacket,\nbecause it buttoned like a woman\u2019s jacket, and my boots and an overcoat, which just had a stripe\npainted in the back, not the cut in.",
        "Q: Not the what?",
        "A: Not the piece of striped clothe cut in, which is what all the other clothes were.",
        "Q: Right, this is one stripe?",
        "A: Just a piece of, maybe two inches wide and few inches long.",
        "Q: And what was the color?",
        "A: Blue and -- and gray stripes.",
        "Q: I thought you said there was a paint stripe.",
        "A: This one was just a red paint stripe.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The patch on my pants and on my jacket were not cut in, were just sewed on.",
        "Q: I think -- can you hold that?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I think we have to stop the tape before we --\nEnd of Tape Five\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "Q: Steven, we were talking about your leaving. Do you have a sense of who this group of people\nwere? Were these Hungarians that were going to Niederorschel, or this --",
        "A: I can show you the -- the bill of lading that I got in Buchenwald. I\u2019m listed as a Slovakian\nJew, because this was a group from -- from Slovakia, and I was pushed in between them.",
        "Q: And you were pushed in between those.",
        "A: Yup. Yeah.",
        "Q: When -- why was there a Jewish doctor standing there? It\u2019s a little hard t --",
        "A: Well, th-the -- the -- the processing line involves a absolutely cursory medical examination,\nand that was a inmate doctor who was doing it.",
        "Q: Were these people -- had they come from outside of Auschwitz, and they were passing\nthrough after a --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- day or two? Do you have any idea who --",
        "A: No, no, no, these were --",
        "Q: These were Slovakian Jews who were in the camp?",
        "A: Oh, oh, oh, the ones who were going out?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, they -- they had just been there days.",
        "Q: Now, were they all tattooed?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: On the way out?",
        "A: On the way out. But the doctor, you asked, I\u2019m sure he was a -- a standard inmate wa -- of\nsome standing, I -- I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And Tadek gave you the gold watch?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And did he assume that there wou -- there could be a problem --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- that the doctor would not pass you --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- and you would be sent to the gas?",
        "A: I -- I wou -- I wou -- what happens if they s -- I -- I mean it was unclear what would have\nhappened if the doctor found reason for me not to be put on the outgoing transport, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And do you have any idea why they allowed you to be showered, because you were leaving? I\nmean, what was --",
        "A: Well amid this -- this incredible barbarity and filth, there was also the German fascination\nwith cleanliness. And all these slogans in the barracks, where you had to use pebbles to wipe\nyourself, there were big slogans on the wall about healthy body keeps you alive and God knows\nwhat else. So ever -- every process involved a shower in cold water and -- and disinfection of\nsome -- walking through some disinfectant like [indecipherable] and I mean, that\u2019s was just part\nof the routine.",
        "Q: Was there soap?",
        "A: Aaartrgh.",
        "Q: No soap, okay.",
        "A: No soap.",
        "Q: No towel, I\u2019m sure --",
        "A: No towel --",
        "Q: -- to wipe yourself. So -- this is cold weather, cause it\u2019s --",
        "A: It\u2019s cold weather.",
        "Q: -- Poland in October.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: Right?",
        "A: Right. And there were -- I was naked and shivering, running from one barrack to the next with\nmy bundle of clothes, and a guard stops me and he said, \u201cWhere are you going? How old are\nyou? What is your birth date?\u201d And I said, \u201cApril 16, 1929,\u201d because the -- the kapos drilled me\nto use my sister\u2019s birthday so I -- that I would appear older. And he say -- said okay, and he\npassed me. So -- so we got dressed, marched to the trains, and I remember very long wait on the\nsiding. Eventually the train started. Three days on the train.",
        "Q: Three?",
        "A: Three days. Wa -- once a day we were let out.",
        "Q: And this is a cattle car similar to what you --",
        "A: Right, right, yes.",
        "Q: -- had in coming to Auschwitz.",
        "A: Right. I remember looking in the window. I remember seeing kids my age romping in the\nsnow and building snowmen and thinking about that.",
        "Q: But now you\u2019re tall enough so you can see out.",
        "A: I guess so.",
        "Q: You guess so, huh?",
        "A: I guess so. And so eventually we arrive, railroad siding. We get out, station sign says\nNiederorschel, and barking orders from an SS. A few words from German foreman, translation\nby Hungarian interpreter. And then to my horror, the German foreman comes up to me and says,\n\u201cWhy are you here, I did not select you.\u201d I was the one who escorted him in Auschwitz through\nthe sel -- through the selection.",
        "Q: So he knew who you were.",
        "A: Yeah. So this was one thing that the kapos didn\u2019t train me for, and so I thought very fast and I\nsaid, \u201cWell sir, with this many new m -- inmates, they decided that you need another interpreter\nand I was sent as an interpreter.\u201d And he shrugged his shoulders and said okay. And we were left\n-- let into this --",
        "Q: Now is th -- is this a German pri -- this is not a German prison. This 1s --",
        "A: No, German civilian --",
        "Q: -- civilian.",
        "A: -- foreman.",
        "Q: I see, okay.",
        "A: So Niederorschel was these two [indecipherable] but now I know is a textile factory right next\nto a railroad siding and a plywood factory further up, were enclosed as a camp, with a narrow\nwalkway between them with barb wire fence. And we were marched into this dining room and\nsat at tables and there was warm meal, which was quite a shock. And we were all eating and the\nHungarian interpreter and another guy who I was very close to later, came in, sat down, really\ncrowding me on both sides. Who are you, where are you from, how come your clothes are\ndifferent, how come the foreman knew you?",
        "Q: You must have been scared out of your mind.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yes. I was very s -- I was very scared. So I tried to explain myself. That evening I\nwas taken into this little side room of where the two kapos lived, both German -- German\npolitical prisoners, both of them communists and in prison since 1933.",
        "Q: Oh my God, wow.",
        "A: Oh -- it -- in -- next month, in April, the 60\" anniversary of the liberation of Niederorschel,\nthere\u2019s a ceremony, including the Israeli ambassador to Germany. The kapo is -- kapo\u2019s family 1s\nreceiving a posthumous award as a Righteous Gentile, because only -- only 19 people died there.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yup. And that was due entirely -- entirely to him. So the quest --",
        "Q: What -- what was his name?",
        "A: Otto -- P'Il think of it in a minute. I have the invitation from the ambassador on -- on my desk.\nOtto -- no.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: So, the questioning. The two kapos in German, a Gypsy who -- who was the camp orderly, I-I\nforget what language we -- we usually sp -- spoke. Polish, a couple of the -- the labor orderly\nwho was Czech, all crowding around me and questioning me. And, so at -- at the end of that\nnight, I convinced them. And I was only 13 years old, but I was accepted as -- as a full member\nof their resistance organization.",
        "Q: What -- what were they trying to fi -- what -- why were they so suspicious of you?",
        "A: Once a plant, a plant, a -- a -- a --",
        "Q: A German plant?",
        "A: A German plant, a -- a [indecipherable] I mean, I did stick out like a sore thumb.",
        "Q: Because your uniform was so different.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, so --",
        "Q: But Tadek got this uniform in Auschwitz for you, I mean he just gave it to you.",
        "A: I mean, a collection of clothes, yeah.",
        "Q: So there\u2019s a collection of clothes.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: So it can\u2019t have been so unique.",
        "A: No, but it was bet -- better fitting, warmer.",
        "Q: I see. So you were better prepared [indecipherable |",
        "A: I was better -- yup, right, right.",
        "Q: It\u2019s also funny that they would suspect a 13 year old as being a plant.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know, it seems like an odd plant to me.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I mean, yeah right.",
        "Q: So how did -- I mean wi -- wa -- how did you convince them? Just by being honest with\nthem?",
        "A: Yeah. I told the Gypsy -- orderly wanted to know about the Gypsies, I said -- that was one of\nthe very difficult things I remember. I told him a -- what I had witnessed. This young Slovak Jew\nwanted to know about the women. I lied to him, but I -- I thought I had to, and I answered all of\ntheir questions and I convinced them.",
        "Q: Okay, so now you\u2019re one of them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What does that mean?",
        "A: Well, all right, let me tell you a little bit about Niederorschel. There is the story -- okay,\nNiederorschel was a factory producing wings for Messershit -- schmitt fighter planes.",
        "Q: And Niederorschel is really a sub-camp of Buchenwald, right?",
        "A: It\u2019s sub -- yeah, in Buchenwald, right, right.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s in that area.",
        "A: Yup. About 700 inmates, about 50 or 60 German civilian workers. 12 hour work shifts, six\nand a half days a week. Every 30 minutes the bell rings and the wing moves up on the assembly\nline from one station to the next station. That was the life. Food somewhat better than Auschwitz\n-- it\u2019s better than Auschwitz. Fortunately there was this absolutely first rate Czech cook. He was\nfat, he was really fat, who, I don\u2019t know how he did it. Kitchen scraps from the guard\u2019s food, \u2019'm\nsure table scraps from the guard\u2019s food. Vegetables that the si -- the town crew managed to steal\nor whatever. He provided some taste and some variety to the -- to the daily soup. So it was -- life\nwas on the edge of being bearable, not quite. I still, after all of these years I think back with\namazement at what people in this circumstance still managed to do. Obviously there were\nshoemakers who could prepare your shoes with sole from discarded tires that the grounds crew\nfound and shoe nails that were cut from scrap lumber. Obviously there were tailors who -- who\nwith needle and thread gotten on the black market from the -- from the civilians could fix your\nclothes. Those kinds of things you expect. You don\u2019t expect to see these two brothers, Hungarian\nJews deported from Holland, diamond grinders by trade, who ground prescription glasses out of\nbottoms of discarded milk bottles. Jewelers who took scraps of aluminum from the plant and\ncreated these carved boxes that could be traded. Beautifully carved, elaborately carved boxes.\nSome others made these very elaborate boxes out of pleated s-straw that could be bartered with\nthe -- with the German civilians for ne -- needle, thread, soap, tobacco, few things. There were\nabout five or six -- maybe five to eight kids my age, mostly, as I said, Budapest with their\nfathers. One -- one kid I remember from Transylvania with his father. These gentlemen decided\nthat our education could not be interrupted, so after 12 hours workday, they sat us down, classes\nin algebra and French. Oh, everything, of course, was punishable by death, particularly\nsmuggling o-out of the plant. Everybody who had a opportunity smuggled out scrap aluminum,\nscrap tools, sharpening them into weapons at night. The lights went out about half an hour after\nmeals were served. You could hear for hours stone bowl -- pebbles being scraped against metal\nto create wa -- knives. I was very proud of a knife I made for myself out of a -- a -- a hacksaw\nblade. There were -- of the 700, probably a hundred were Soviet POWs. The Germans did not\nhonor the Geneva convention, and the Soviet POWs were in the same boat as we were. And\nsome of them were the strongest, in terms of trying to make weapons. Training for a uprising.\nThrowing knives. Many of them had fashioned these heavy knives with very heavy handles and\npracticed.",
        "Q: So there was real intention to have an uprising?",
        "A: Yes. You asked about my role. First few weeks I was on -- on the detail with the -- under the\nGypsy orderly that went to town to -- for collect -- for getting goods that -- bread and vegetables\nand that was brought in from the local market. I was well enough dressed, if the other inmates\ndetracted the guards attention, I could sn-sneak in the apothecary and with Reichsmarks from the\nblack market, get aspirin and medication that the medic wanted; to get ethyl alcohol for Molotov\nbombs.",
        "Q: Ethyl alcohol for --",
        "A: For Molotov cocktails.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Then the SS lieutenant decided I was not strong enough to carry these loaves of bread, and so\nthey put me from that detail to the factory, and next to the Hungarian interpreter, the next to the\nlast line on the assembly line, the inspection line. I was given a dentist mirror, and it was my job\nto look at every single rivet to see that it was properly driven. Badly -- 0-occasionally -- I mean,\nsabotage was going all the time. Occasionally I would see a rivet that -- that wasn\u2019t right. I could\npass it, occasionally I could stop. Our station was the only one that could stop the assembly line\nto drill out a rivet and insert the explosive driven rivet, that you apply heat on the top and the\nbottom explodes and that tightens the -- the connection. Whatever sabotage we could do, we --\nwe did. It didn\u2019t really matter because it turns out -- well, eventually, by January, the railroad\nline was bombed. We were getting fewer and fewer parts, and the wing -- the partial wings that\nwe produced were piled in the snow outside, was no place to put them. The story I heard -- it\u2019s th\n-- it\u2019s known that no single wing produced here ever flew.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, the Germans made this a known -- the camp was only started in the spring of \u201944. The\nGermans made this enormous effort to disperse war production because of the bombings. And\nnone o -- not all of it worked. In fact, I\u2019ve heard a rumor that this was a ruse by a small group of\npeople to -- to found this factory and escape from being drafted to the eastern front. How true it\nis, I don\u2019t know. So -- so life was little bit more bearable, much more to do. Looking forward to\nthat half day on Sunday afternoon where we had a little rest. Then as spring -- as weather became\n-- came to war -- warm up in -- in March, we would -- especially the Russians would set along\nthe fence, which was the promenade to the townspeople, and -- and sing Soviet songs loudly,\nwhich upset the promenade -- naders. That was the life. As I said, only 19 people died. Two were\nSoviet POWs that escaped, were brought back -- were captured by German civilians, brought\nback and they were ha -- hanged. I have the list of the others, got it last November. But mortality\nwas -- was quite low -- were -- I mean, remarkably low.",
        "Q: These classes that you talked about that they said they were --",
        "A: Yup.",
        "Q: When did -- when did they give you these classes, after work?",
        "A: After work.",
        "Q: After you eat?",
        "A: After you eat, yeah.",
        "Q: So how long would they last? I mean, you must have --",
        "A: Half an hour.",
        "Q: Half an hour.",
        "A: I mean, we were all asleep, but --",
        "Q: I was --",
        "A: -- we were all asleep by halfway through, but I guess [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And you did the classes in the barracks?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And obviously these are all verbal things you --",
        "A: Right, oh yes, sure, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you learn anything?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I -- I -- I was -- again, there was a fairly -- especially if you have red -- yellow\nstar, there was a fairly sharp dividing line between the religious Jews and the secular Jews. I was\na -- in the -- the room -- there was some self selection, who went to what room. I was certainly in\none of the rooms that was very secular, but they -- the -- the religious ferwer was -- was equally\nimpressive. I mean, to know the entire daily and Sabbath prayer book by heart, I mean that\u2019s for\n-- taken for granted. To know the parsha, the -- the week\u2019s Torah portion and Aftorah portion by\nheart, well, there was always room for debate, th-the great Talmudic debates on -- on what was\nthe correct memory. All of the festivals are observed, every -- I mean, yeah they -- they -- the\nOrthodox inmates were totally immersed in -- in their religion. So we knew there -- most of the\nworkers just sort of came and went as if we were invisible. You know, very little contact. One of\nthem ev -- every day, would eat his lunch and read his paper and then make sure that he got my\neye and he made -- and signal on where he was hiding the paper, so that later, just before we\nwere herded back to the -- the barracks, I could retrieve the paper and bring it in the barracks. So\nwhatever the German newspaper said, we knew that. So, April first, we had just finished -- I -- I\nfinished work is no longer ap-appropriate. We just finished our 12 hours and went back in the\nbarracks, the whistle sounded and they were moving -- moving us out. There was a big debate in\nthe kapos rooms. Lot of people would -- lot of people wanted to stage an uprising. We had\ncounterfeit keys to all of the guards\u2019 rooms. That\u2019s not eas -- not hard to do. The inmates were --\nwere taking the -- the food across several locked doors. With the key you just chew some -- some\nbread dough in your mouth, make an impression in the key and there were locksmith who could\nduplicate that. The SS, the officers were living upstairs, we didn\u2019t think we could get to them. So\nthere was a big debate and the kapo decided that -- that we didn\u2019t know where the American\nfront was. It seemed to have slowed down after the -- after the Battle of the Bulge, that we would\nmarch out. The kapo gave orders to the leaders of the brigades that everybody was free to escape\nif they could. The cook had some emergency rations. Chicory grounds, molasses, something that\nyou could carry, and we were marched out.",
        "Q: Were you disappointed that there was no uprising?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: You were?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You wanted to do it?",
        "A: Oh, I was -- well, yes, but when it came to the vote in the room, the Czech work orderly and I\nvoting no swung the -- sw-swung the balance. I could have voted for --",
        "Q: And so why didn\u2019t you?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t think we had the -- the troops to do it.",
        "Q: Ah, so you\u2019re distinguishing between wanting to do it --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- but realizing that you were --",
        "A: Yeah. I didn\u2019t think we could do it.",
        "Q: How many people do you think could have been involved? How wa -- wa -- or were creating\nthese weapons, of some kind?",
        "A: 150 out of 700, something like that.",
        "Q: And do you know about how many guards you had?",
        "A: 40 - 50.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a lot.",
        "A: Yeah. They were -- the officers were SS. The guards were Wehrmacht, regular army\nreservists in their 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s. I mean, tottering old men, but still, they had automatic\nrifles.",
        "Q: So that was the problem, of course.",
        "A: Yes, yeah. So that\u2019s when -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s how we got --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- going on the march.",
        "Q: Right. Well let\u2019s -- we have to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "Q: Okay, Steven, did you bring your knife that you had fashioned, with you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t?",
        "A: I -- I -- I traded it with -- with the -- the Gypsy orderly during the march, and he gave me\nanother knife, and I -- I lo -- I -- I -- no, I haven\u2019t -- I haven\u2019t got any -- anything from -- I don\u2019t\nhave any artifact from --",
        "Q: No, but when you left --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You did take it.",

        "A: Oh, of course.",
        "Q: -- they -- th -- everybody took them?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: And the intent was in case something happens they\u2019 Il use it.",
        "A: Yeah, we almost ca -- we almost came to that on the -- on the ninth day. I'll tell you -- I --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Do you wa -- do you want sa --",
        "Q: So -- well --",

        "A: -- 10 day -- 10 days --",
        "Q: 10 days of marching?",
        "A: -- of march -- let\u2019s see, la -- in October we covered the same route by car, probably two hours\nat 50 kilomet -- say it\u2019s about 120 - 150 kilometers, less than a hundred miles.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re marching towards --",
        "A: Towards Buchenwald, yes, towards Weimar --",
        "Q: -- towards Buchenwald.",
        "A: -- right, right. Escapes almost every night, shootings I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- most every night. People\nfalling behind shot and left to die in the -- left dead in the -- in the gutter. Farmers watching us,\nstanding in their fields, clutching their pitchforks. Walking through these -- marching through\nthese villages. People peering out behind lace curs -- curtains. We went through Sonderheim,\nwhich was an only large city on the way, broken up cobblestone streets, and that city had been\nbombed. So it was very long march, very arduous. The follo -- we were being marched with the\nguards on the side, following the train -- following the marchers was a very old army truck, with\na platform in the back, on which the relief guards slept, and it also carried couple rows of a barb\nwire fence which they used to enclose every night. And pulled this, which was obviously World\nWar I vintage field kitchen, which sometimes worked and most of the time didn\u2019t work, so\nsometimes we had ersatz coffee or some -- something resembling soup. Most of the time we\ndidn\u2019t.",
        "Q: So then, but there was an attempt?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t just --",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So after eight days we arrived at another satellite ca-camp called Berlsteed, which some of the\nold time prisoners recognized. That had been a brick factory which produced the -- the bricks for\nBuchenwald and for the other camps. So we had a little bit more freedom cause we\u2019re inside the\nfence, inside the barb wire fence, and not the enclosure of rolls. And we had some food. We also\nfound some -- some frozen potatoes on the ground and everybody started making fires and -- and\ngrilling these potatoes and usually get -- taking them out barehanded before they were cooked.\nAnd suddenly we were called to a -- a second appel. A contingent of SS guards came in a truck\nfrom -- from Buchenwald, replaced our Wehrmacht guards, and these officers took count. In the\nofficer\u2019s staff car was an inmate, and even it was dusk I could recognize first the red triangle on\nhis chest, and the red beret on his head. So as dusk was falling and the officers were chatting, I\ninched up to him. The guar -- the -- the -- the kapo was sitting on the running board of the SS\nstaff car and I inched up to him and sort of crouched without looking at him, as -- as if there was\nno contact. And he said, \u201cDo you speak Polish?\u201d Yes. \u201cYou have a resistance group?\u201d Yes.\n\u201cSend me one of them.\u201d All I could say is, \u201cI\u2019m one of them, you can talk.\u201d And he said,\n\u201cWhatever you do, stall. Buchenwald is being emptied, trainloads of Jewish prisoners are -- are\nbeing taken -- taken in open cars. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, we don\u2019t have control.\u201d The\nre-resistance organization in Buchenwald was always very strong. \u201cWe don\u2019t have control, stall.\u201d\nSo I shuffled back to the -- actually I ran back because a SS sergeant was kicking at me, ran back\nand when we were bedded down, I reported that to the kapo and the -- the others. How do we\nstall? And this Czech government bureaucrat who was a high level -- I think he was deputy\nsecretary of something in Czech Republic, he realized what we had to do, that the SS took e --\nthat up to that point the local SS were in charge, they could do whatever they wanted. Now a\ncount had been taken up to Buchenwald, our SS had to deliver that many bodies, dead or alive\nwhen they arrive in Buchenwald. There\u2019s no -- no question. So if some people would hide, the\ncount would come short. Well the -- the Gypsy orderly had been in -- in bel -- Berlsteed, he\nknew where the brick ovens were, and it was decided that three of -- he and two others would\nhide in the brick ovens at night. We woke up, our kapo -- our -- SS took a head count, it was\nthree short. So they were thr -- dispatching people all -- all -- guards all over to search, we just\nstood at attention for a good part of the day. They he -- the SS lieutenant singled out the\norganization, he knew everybody. Others were allowed to -- to sit, to lie down, we were\nstanding. He threatened to start killing us. Nothing happened. He s -- that\u2019s when he sent all but\nfour to six guards for another search. And that was when I thought that they -- he -- that Vladya,\nRussian off-officer would yell one word and the breakout would start. I knew that. Facing the\nguards were all the -- the sharpshooters with their heavy knives. And I expected that those people\nwould -- would kill the guards and get their guns and s -- and face the other guards coming back.\nAnd then, for the first time that I recall, we heard the sound of -- of gunfire from the west. I -- I\ndon\u2019t recall having it er -- having heard it earlier. I don\u2019t know how -- how far the front was, I --\nI never checked. I could check by date on where the front was. But anyhow, the SS chickened\nout, and decided to march us out. Long, torturous, very difficult walk up the steep slope.\nBuchenwald means beech forest, and the camp 1s at the tip of this somewhat sizable hill. The SS\nmade the resistance group march in front and SS officer behind us and then rest of them. The\ninmates -- and it was definitely silence, and everybody was shuffling, and I decided I had\nsomething to -- I had to do something, and I stopped as if to tie my shoe, and turned around and\nyelled pasnia in Russian, a song. And the Russians heard me and pretty soon the entire column\nwas singing. And that was a tremendous relief. Me -- I mean, we all we -- on Sundays, the\nSunday afternoons we were singing Russian songs, Polish partisan songs, Yiddish songs. Never\nHungarian songs. Nobo -- nobody Hungarian wanted anything Hungarian. We were singing\nelements of -- of the choral movement of the Ninth Symphony, because that was a -- one of the\nmusicians from the Budapest orchestra taught it to us. So that singing started and that somehow\ngot people the -- the strength to march the last couple of kilometers up -- uphill, and we arrived\nat the gate in Buchenwald.",
        "Q: You remember the song that you sang -- that you started to sing, this Russian song?",
        "A: [speaks Russian here] A Russian folk song, the -- the Volga -- the Volga boatman song, some\npartisan songs.",
        "Q: So that gave everybody a --",
        "A: That -- that was a -- a big lift. So we arrive at the gate of Buchenwald, which was described to\nme by the people who had been there, and we marched in. First thing I noticed that the\ncrematorium, the chimney was -- was cold, there was no smoke coming out of the chimney,\nwhich I thought was a good sign. We were marched through the sanitation delousing area right at\nthe top, and that was a good sign. And we were faced by a group of -- of political prisoners in the\nred beret coming to meet us. On that day there were no more transports out, there were no more\nSS inside the camp, and the resistance organization controlled the camp. So -- so we were\nmarched in one of the barracks and told to go to sleep, and I fell asleep. And I don\u2019t have a very\nheroic closing because next thing I remember is in following day at mid-afternoon, somebody\nshook my shoulder to say that the Americans were there.",
        "Q: Did it feel like the end of this hell?",
        "A: Yeah, in many ways it did. We all raced up to the -- to the barb wire fence, we yelled, and I\ntried to catch somebody\u2019s attention and report on the -- on the crimes of the SS lieutenant that I\nknew of, and then I collapsed against the fence. Spent six weeks in a field hospital run by the\nAmerican army.",
        "Q: And the field hospital was on the site? On the --",
        "A: Ah -- buchenw -- you\u2019ve not been to Buchenwald.",
        "Q: Yeah, on top.",
        "A: On top. The camp is that side, on the other side is the crescent of these large buildings which\nwere SS barracks, which now house the museum, library, etcetera. In 24 hours, Americans\nconverted that to one field hospital, recruiting nurses and doctors from [indecipherable] I don\u2019t\nknow how many thousand of people were there. So I was there for --",
        "Q: Six weeks.",
        "A: -- Six weeks.",
        "Q: Were you awake a lot of this time, or were you [indecipherable]",
        "A: I was awake [indecipherable] uh-huh, yup.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Where\u2019d that come from?",
        "A: Oh, that came from one of the guards. I spoke back to him and he swung his rifle at me and I -\n- | -- the only time I lost my -- my cool, spoke back to the armed guard.",
        "Q: When did this happen?",
        "A: On the march.",
        "Q: Oh, on the march. So you\u2019re marching with a broken arm?",
        "A: Yeah, with a -- with a -- yeah. The medic -- the Russian officer cut some -- cut some tree\nlimbs and made a s -- they made a splint, medic made a splint and I was walking with a ar --\nmarching with a broken arm.",
        "Q: He could have shot you.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Do you have any idea why he didn\u2019t?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: No, you don\u2019t know. He just broke your arm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: He smashed you with it -- with a baton?",
        "A: With -- swung his rifle and -- and I just put my arm up.",
        "Q: Oh. Well, I\u2019m glad you told me.",
        "A: Yeah. So I don\u2019t know how far beyond you want to go.",
        "Q: I want to go a ways down. So you\u2019re in the hospital for six weeks.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you know that your mother 1s not alive?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know that -- I mean, yes, I knew that from my sister. I knew what -- I didn\u2019t know\nabout my sister, I didn\u2019t know about my father.",
        "Q: Your father, right.",
        "A: While I was there in the hospital, a rabbi from the Backa area came by. He -- he was taking\nnames of liberated inmates from the Backa area, and came to interview me. I said ah sa --\nSubotica. Date of birth -- 16 -- April 1929 and s -- s -- wait a minute. He goes through notebooks\nand says, you have a twin. So he had met -- seen my sister in Bergen-Belsen, and so that\u2019s how I\nknew that she was there. She was alive. So yeah, the Iron Curtain was down in \u201945. Not -- didn\u2019t\nwait for Truman -- for Churchill\u2019s speech. The French, Norwegians, Danes, Dutch, Belgians\nwere out of there in 48 hours. The people who wanted to go to the Soviet side were there for\nweeks and weeks and weeks. I was informed when I registered with the American -- that there\nwas a provision for DP orphans to be sent directly to the States. And they notified my uncle who\nwas a doctor in -- in New York, that they found me. And my ga -- my uncle would take me --\nand I said no, I can\u2019t do that.",
        "Q: This is the brother of your mother?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Right? Okay.",
        "A: I said, \u201cI have to go back. If anybody 1s alive, they will do -- will do the same thing, I have to\ngo back.\u201d So it wasn\u2019t til July or August that we were taken by American trucks to Pilsen in\nCzechoslovakia and then by train, Pilsen, Prague, Budapest. And I arrived in Subotica.",
        "Q: And had you all said this to each other, as a family, that we\u2019ll go back --",
        "A: Never said it, never said it.",
        "Q: You never said where you would go?",
        "A: No. We just knew that.",
        "Q: So did you go back to your house?",
        "A: At the railroad station, my two surviving cousins were waiting for me. They were in the\nYugoslav army, and they were coming out daily, whenever a returning train was coming, they\ndid that regularly. So we went to our -- my Gentile aunt\u2019s house. Going back to my house made\nno sense. So I stayed there. Couple weeks later my sister came back omai -- on a train from\nBergen-Belsen. And then in late August, maybe early September, my father came back on a\nRussian hospital train. I still have the admission diagnosis from the Russian mi -- military\nhospital. Angina, kidney failure, 15 serious maladies, from a coal mine in Silesia. But he came\nhome. He tried to start a new life. He was told that if he asked for the plant they\u2019re going to try\nhim for collaboration with the enemy because he didn\u2019t put up armed resistance when the plant\nwas taken away. He eked out a miserable living, and he died sixth of February, 1946. Three\nmonths after he came back. Totally broken, physically, emotionally.",
        "Q: So he wasn\u2019t the same man that you knew?",
        "A: Uh-uh. One picture that I don\u2019t have in my album -- most of the pictures I have in my album -\n- my sister it was bet -- had better connections, got more pictures back, and mo -- large majority\nof what I have is -- is photocopies from her album. There is this small passport size picture of our\nfather, I don\u2019t want a copy of that in my album. It\u2019s so horrible that I don\u2019t want it. But at least\nwe could bury him in this big, elaborate tomb that was put up for his brother. My wife, Norma 1s\nn -- November, this October was the first time that she wa -- she had seen somebody\n[indecipherable] and of course we went to the cemetery. And she said, \u201cYou had sow -- shown\nme this picture before,\u201d it\u2019s a big, white marble thing with [indecipherable] and projecting\nletters. But on a photograph it\u2019s -- they\u2019re almost invisible. And then underneath, carved in very\ncrudely are the names of my father and all the relatives who died in the Shoah. Then my wife\nsaid, \u201cThis solves one mystery. I could never bring up myself to ask you, but I could never\nunderstand how, in those circumstances you could afford to have such a fancy grave for your\nfather.\u201d She never realized that that was a -- the tomb f -- for my uncle. So after he died --",
        "Q: Is your mother\u2019s name up there, too?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So all the family members who died --",
        "A: All the family mem -- yeah --",
        "Q: -- whether they\u2019re there or not.",
        "A: -- a-- a -- through the entire cemetery, everywhere, there are the -- the names of the -- of the -\n- you know, one engraved name on the name and 20 chiseled in names of sur -- of people who\ndidn\u2019t survi -- of people who died. So, went back to school, I\u2019d lost a year.",
        "Q: And where are you living?",
        "A: We got this apartment, which was a terrib --",
        "Q: You and your sister?",
        "A: Well, first my father --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- and I and sister. We had a terrific maid, a Volksdeutscher, a [indecipherable] woman who\nwas let out of the camps to be our servant until they were booted out to Germany. All -- all they -\n- all the Volksdeutscher were -- from mo -- all of these countries were booted out. You know, the\n-- the German -- the German foreign minister\u2019s name is the same as my nickname, Joschka.",
        "Q: Really? Oh that\u2019s right, yes it was.",
        "A: Yeah. I mean ob -- obviously his family came from -- fr -- came from -- was expelled in the --\nat the end of the war. So we had this miserable apartment, cold, with my father, and until she was\ndeported, this -- this woman, who was quite, quite nice. And then my -- my younger aunt -- my\nthree younger so -- aunts -- my father\u2019s three younger dau -- sisters survived, two of them in\nBudapest and one in -- in Subotica and she moved in with us. And that was it, we -- I mean,\ngoing to school in communist Yugoslavia was no fun at all. You know, obligatory membership\nin the communist youth party and I was there -- I -- I\u2019m very grateful. I still correspond with two\nof my classmates who sort of pick me up and provide a lot of support. So I did two years there.\nAnd my sister came back on a train with many Yugoslav army officers coming from POW\ncamps, and she was corresponding with one of them, who wrote back -- wrote her that he had a\nposition in the foreign ministry. I went to Belgrade, we saw him and he issued us passports and\nexit visas. I\u2019m not quite sure it was legal for him to do so. But of all of us, two of us, my two\ncousins, and my two cousins fianc\u00e9s, of the six of us who found ourself together in Paris, we\nwere the only two that had legal ways of getting there.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. Did anybody, when you came back and you\u2019re going to school,\nyou\u2019re there for a couple of years --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- before you leave for Paris, yes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Does anybody ask you what happened? Do you talk to your sister, is there -- or do you just\nsimply go on?",
        "A: No, there was a lot of talk, there -- there was a -- a friend of my aunt\u2019s who invited me to talk,\nwho 1m -- who told me that I have to sit down and write all of this down. Yeah, some people\nwere interested. The majority -- I mean, all of us -- most of us just wanted to get on and let --",
        "Q: Did you -- so you didn\u2019t want to talk? This was not something --",
        "A: Oh, I -- I talked to them. I me -- when people asked, I talked.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t want to dwell too much on it.",
        "Q: Right. And your sister the same?",
        "A: Yeah, me -- much more so than I.",
        "Q: More so than you?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, I mean she -- she had ter -- totally divorced herself, she -- she said she didn\u2019t\nwant to have anything to do with it. I mean, she --",
        "Q: Did you talk together so she knew what happened to you and you knew what happened to\nher?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. I --",
        "Q: But that was it?",
        "A: That was it. So --",
        "Q: So you went to --",
        "A: -- SO -- So we escaped. I mean, in -- with all -- in -- with all respects, we escaped. If --",
        "Q: Were there any questions at the border with these papers?",
        "A: Well, we were very careful. On the basis of Yugoslav passport, French -- Americans were not\nvery helpful. \u201cOh, you missed your chance as a DP. There is a Yugoslav quota, but it\u2019s kept in\nthe west. If you manage to get the west and register, we\u2019ll register you.\u201d Period. French were\nvery nice, \u201cWe'll give you a three day transit visa, if [indecipherable] you get to France, the\npolice will extend it indefinitely if you renounce your citizenship.\u201d On the basis of that we go to\nItalians, 24 hour transit visa. You wait, th -- Trieste was being run by [indecipherable]\narrangements. You certainly don\u2019t go the month when the Russians control it. You don\u2019t go the\nmonth when the British control it, because they read stuff. You wait til the Americans control it,\nthey put a stamp on it --",
        "Q: Then you just go.",
        "A: Then you just go. The train -- in Ljubljana the train was locked. The train was unlocked when\nwe got to Milan. And from there we went to Paris. I usually break down when I talk about that. I\ncame back maybe a dozen time to the Milan train station, going to Florence, going conferences\nin northern Italy. But that\u2019s really the place where I feel my freedom began.",
        "Q: In Milan?",
        "A: Just a railroad station, hour of waiting for the train to Paris. But that was --",
        "Q: That\u2019s the place.",
        "A: That\u2019s the place.",
        "Q: We have to stop the tape.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Seven\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "Q: I know it\u2019s hard to remember feelings. Did you actually feel when you were in Milan that this\nwas the break --",
        "A: Oh yes. Very strongly.",
        "Q: You did feel --",
        "A: Very strongly.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And when you go back there, you feel [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh yeah, right.",
        "Q: And did es --",
        "A: And my sister\u2019s comment is, \u201cYou were a good little boy until then, you haven\u2019t been one\nsince.\u201d",
        "Q: And you\u2019re still a little boy to her?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So from Milan, you go into Paris.",
        "A: We get to Paris, we registered with the Joint, American Joint Distribution Committee, they\nprovided housing and -- and meal tickets at a cafeteria. Went to the Yugoslav consulate, asked\nfor a interview with the consul, we walked in, handed him the passport -- two passports, and\nwalked out, went to the Yugoslav royal military mission. They gave us a -- a certificate.",
        "Q: That said what, you\u2019re no longer citizens?",
        "A: That -- that we are recognized by them, whatever that was.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Went to the French police prefecture, got our three month visitor -- a three months permit.\nWent to the arrondissement headquarters, got our ni -- our rations, it was still rationed. And the\nfren -- I mean, the stay was extended for two years. Every three months we had to go to police\nfor an extension. Visited England the following year, and then c-coming to the States I had -- we\nboth had [indecipherable] stateless passports issued by the French.",
        "Q: And you went to school in France, did you not? Both of you?",
        "A: Well, at first -- at first al -- Joint had thousands of us, so they contracted out to French social\nservice agencies to take care of groups of people, and we were -- we were at a outfit called\nService sociale des jeunes. Youth social services. And that\u2019s where we went monthly for money,\nsome clothing, I mean, really subsistence money, clothing, meal tickets, etcetera. There was\nnothing else to do. There\u2019s this great institution called Alliance Francaise, which gives free\nFrench lessons -- free lessons in French three days a week, morning sessions, afternoon session,\nevening session. Allowed to progress as fast as you\u2019re ready. I went through three sessions a day,\nhad nothing else to do. And so I -- the next year, I\u2019m now a proud owner of a certificate that\nallows me to teach French as a second language al -- any-anywhere outside of France.",
        "Q: So that was your fourth language?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: At least.",
        "A: That\u2019s my fourth language. There was this great urge that we all should learn a trade. I ne -- I\nknow social workers who -- handling DP persons in this country, and always that same urge. So\nthey put us into this school, e-electrician school, majorly make-shift sort of thing. The directress\n-- the -- Madame le Directeur of the social service agency thought I could do better. She used her\npersonal contacts, and I got accepted in a private high school. Of course [indecipherable] you\nknow, one of the government lyc\u00e9es never take somebody like that. She got me into a private\nschool. She got her octogenarian former teacher to coach me. And in \u201949 I passed the first part of\nthe French baccalauret and in \u201950 I passed the second part. How did I do it? My French teacher\nsaid -- the -- the nice thing about the French baccalauret is that 1t\u2019s administered by the\nuniversities, not by the high schools, so nobody knows you. He said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to establish\nright away that French is not your native language. Make a atrocious colloquial error in the first\nsentence. And after that, do the best that you can.\u201d So --",
        "Q: And it was -- was that because they would be sympathetic?",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, they would understand that it\u2019s not my native language. So that\u2019s what I did in\nthe first year in French, second year math -- I mean, math I was okay. And physics, chemistry,\netcetera. Se -- yeah, first year there\u2019s a written -- written foreign language and a second oral only.\nThat year I took English because I had a little bit more sc-schooling in English than I had had in\nFrench -- in German. Second year it\u2019s only an oral exam, so I took German. Exam was running\nlate, I was the last one and I -- I was totally exhausted, I just propped myself in there, in front of\nthe examiner, and in German I said, \u201cWass soll ich ubersetzen?\u201d What is it that you want me to\ntranslate? He said, \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d He closed the books, and I passed.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. I was beginning t -- m-my s-sister and I were both beginning to think about staying\nthere --",
        "Q: Staying?",
        "A: -- staying in France, yeah. She was start -- she started with the Sorbonne, I was thinking about\nwhich preparatory school I would take in the fall to -- to get into one of the architecture schools.\nAnd then the American visa arrived in August of 1950.",
        "Q: And you had applied for a visa?",
        "A: Yeah, yes, we registered with a -- but yugos -- Yugoslav quota and then there was the\nMcCarran Act --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- which said let\u2019s start from scratch, throw away all the accumulated quotas that were not\nexercised during the war. Yugoslav quota is 400 year or something like that, but it wasn\u2019t\nexercised since \u201941. I would ha -- you know, if Truman hadn\u2019t vetoed that I would never have\nbeen here. In between we tried various places where we could go, with our two cousins and that\ndidn\u2019t work out, because we had affidavits from my uncle on the maternal side. They eventually\nwound up in Venezuela and we came to the States. So we went to Chicago because that\u2019s where\nour uncle lived.",
        "Q: Wait, let me -- hold it for a second.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you like being in Paris, in France?",
        "A: Oh, tremendously.",
        "Q: It was --",
        "A: I mean, we lived -- I mean, miserably. You know, I -- when I went -- on weekend you decide\nwhether to use your money to eat or to go to the -- the weekly visit to the se -- to the public baths\nto -- to take a shower. You know, it\u2019s a different level of living than -- than what you normally is\n-- are accustomed to. But -- but it was great, I mean, yeah, I mean every other -- in most respects\nit was great.",
        "Q: Did you feel like orphans?",
        "A: I was the token refugee in this high school which was very upper class French high school. I\nmean, several of my classmate\u2019s fathers were still in prison for -- for their role in the Vichy\ngovernment. I felt very well accepted.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But the two of you are still children, 1n a way. Your sister is what, 16 - 17?",
        "A: Seven -- yeah.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re 15?",
        "A: Right. Well, it didn\u2019t matter.",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t matter?",
        "A: No, no. We were quite self-sufficient. My -- I no longer keep conta -- I kept contact for a\ncouple decades with my classmates from high school. You know, the -- the number of people\nwho passed the baccalauret is exactly equal to the number of openings in the university at the\nfollowing fall. So they consider me as a traitor to France for having dropped out of that. And I\u2019ve\noften thought what it would have been. I mean, there\u2019s no question in my mind if I\u2019d become a\nprofessor at the Ecole Superieure des Ponts et Chaussee, in relative terms that would be\nsomething higher than being a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. But the -- the odds of a\nforeigner getting that far in France, it\u2019s sort of near zero. So I -- I -- I don\u2019t -- never regretted it.",
        "Q: So you came to the United States.",
        "A: Came to the United States.",
        "Q: And was your uncle, your mother\u2019s brother in Chicago?",
        "A: He was a -- well, he had a practice in -- in New York, he contacted Multiple Sclerosis, and\ndecided that the best way to heal himself is to heal others, and gave up his practice, moved to a\nveteran\u2019s hospital in Chicago as a -- as a physical therapist.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. But he was not in a position to support us. He died -- yeah, I think I introduced Norma\nto him once, he met my wife-to-be once. There were some other friends of my parents, who were\nterrific. Took us over and sort of nurtured us and I got -- I was disin -- by that time I was\nabsolutely disenchanted with architecture but I decided I would study civil engineering. I started\nna --",
        "Q: So your original intent was architecture?",
        "A: Yeah, there\u2019s a expectation of my parents, because of --",
        "Q: Because of your --",
        "A: -- of my uncle\u2019s prominence. But at Beaux Arts -- I -- I\u2019m still -- I\u2019m sure that if I\u2019d started at\na decent, modern architecture school I would have stayed. But in the Beaux Arts, the first year\nthere\u2019s only one subject, free hand sketching, nothing else. And I passed the mathematics option\nof the baccalaureate. I wanted to do some other things beside free hand sketching. So that was\nout. So a friend of -- our friend in Chicago suggested that I was not qualified to work as a\ndraftsman. I didn\u2019t know the English units, among other things, but at that time engineering\ndrawings still had to be traced in ink on -- on vellum. So I got a ma -- job as a -- as a tracer.\nEventfully they promoted me to draftsman, that\u2019s -- was fine. I started night school at IIT\n[indecipherable] technology in Chicago. And I had a path laid out and in seven and a half years I\nwould have my bachelor\u2019s degree.",
        "Q: Working at night?",
        "A: Working at night. Except that in January \u201952, 15 months after I came to the States, I got\ndrafted in the United States Army, because I came as a -- with my intention of becoming a\ncitizen, so I was qualified for the draft.",
        "Q: But you weren\u2019t a citizen yet.",
        "A: No, but -- but my --",
        "Q: But they can still draft you?",
        "A: The intent -- the green ca -- the -- the cert -- the certificate of intent, or whatever you sign,\nqualify --",
        "Q: Qualifies you to be drafted.",
        "A: -- makes you subject to the draft, yes. Korea -- not to citizenship because the Korean war was\nnot a declared war, so peace time rules applied. And peace times rules are, after three years in the\ncontinental -- three years of service in the continental United States, you qualify for citizenship.\nWell, people were drafted for two years, not three, and they were sent overseas. That\u2019s why they\nwere drafted. And then, in Korea, the Chinese captured a few kids in my situation. At least one\nof them was -- was taken back to -- to Warsaw and paraded on the streets of Warsaw as a traitor.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. At which point congress passed the wartime regulations, after 180 days without --\nwithout a dishonorable discharge you qualify. And so everybody in Korea in one weekend -- a\nfederal judge was flown to Tokyo, all of these kids were pulled out and sworn in in one weekend.",
        "Q: As citizens.",
        "A: As citizens. In -- in the European sector we were just told that we qualify as soon as we get\nout. So anyhow, I had basic training, I had orders to Korea, blanket orders to Korea, which made\nme wonder what it will be like to have a weapon to shoot back. Last minute I was -- a few of us\nwere pulled out and sent to Europe -- sent to Germany as interpreters. So I arrived in\nBremerhaven, arrive in Stuttgart, intel -- intelligence battalion attached to the seventh army\nheadquarters, after four or five weeks of doing nothing, the executive officer calls me in and\nsays, \u201cSoldier, we can\u2019t get you clearance.\u201d Obviously they couldn\u2019t check in Yugoslavia\n[indecipherable]. Security status -- \u201cwithout a clearance, you -- we can\u2019t use you in this battalion.\nThe normal procedure under these circumstances is to send you back to infantry. You look a\nlittle bit more intelligent than that, what else can you do?\u201d And I -- I said, \u201cWell, sir, in attempt\nto be a civil engineer I also passed the draftsman test, not just the language test.\u201d He called\nacross seventh army headquarters, engineer section, oh yeah, they need draftsmen. And so for a\nyear and a half I was a --",
        "Q: A draftsman.",
        "A: A draftsman. In a few weeks I got promoted and I was chief draftsman. So that was a very\ninteresting lesson because the first time I was responsible for other people\u2019s work, which was\ninteresting. Being stationed in Stuttgart was interesting. I met two or three -- two other guys that\nsim -- situation very similar to a -- to mine. One of the very inexpensive entertainments was the\nopera. One -- four marks, one dollar, running 10 months a year, and so you know, twice a week,\nthree times a week we would go to the opera. There were a lot of young German men and\nwomen working in various positions at army headquarters. I s-sort of became part of the group.\nMit -- at that time it was still an army of occupation, you couldn\u2019t wea -- wear civilian clothes. It\ndidn\u2019t matter, I -- I met this girl, I kept my clothes at her -- her house. I would change, we would\ngo out to dinner, and get changed and get back on the last bus at midnight going up to army\nheadquarters. If I was -- whenever I was challenged by the MPs in restaurants, I spoke better\nGerman -- better German than they did, I -- I was ne -- I was never caught. I never -- never --",
        "Q: So they thought you were a German?",
        "A: Yes, I had this -- there was a Hungarian laborer in the kitchen at the -- at the -- at the army\nheadquarters and he would lend me his -- his I.D. [indecipherable] car -- I.D. card and\n[indecipherable] MPs didn\u2019t faze me.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t faze you, no?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: You figured they can\u2019t be worse than what you already went through, huh?",
        "A: Right, right. So it was a very interesting experience because several of these kids wanted to\ntalk about what happened and what they -- what their parents role was, and what happened to\ntheir parents, and I was very much interested in what their parents role was, and what happened\nto their parents. So we had very long conversations with -- weekend long conversations.",
        "Q: Were you honest about yourself?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You were?",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: And they were very interested to know --",
        "A: Absolutely, yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- how this connection was?",
        "A: Yes, I was -- absolutely. Yup. Certainly that was a very -- intellectually very interesting part.\nThe other part is that with the leave I had -- and -- and money, I had opportunity to travel. One\nthing I forgot to mention about my childhood is that this room that was my mother\u2019s studio and\nour play space, on four walls, three rows of black and white reproductions of -- of artwork, most\n-- mostly renaissance, mostly classical, very few modern ones. I was raised with that. So over the\nyears, but certainly starting with the period, I must have seen all the originals by now. My sister\nand I couple times have started to make a list and we always stop, because the list gets aha --\nlonger, and longer, and longer of things we think should -- that should have been there, which\nweren\u2019t there. But, you know, going to Berlin, to the Dali museum to see the [indecipherable]\nwhich with the -- the owl [indecipherable], yup, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s part of my -- my traveling\nschedule anywh -- anywhere I go. So I got out of the army. I got early discharge so I could start\nat the University of Illinois. I started February 54, got my Bachelors in February \u201957. In the\nmeantime I met Norma, we got married. 50\u201c anniversary is coming up in three months.",
        "Q: Where did you meet?",
        "A: In Chicago. My sister and her sister-in-law met through a common friend and they had both\nhad children of the same age. Her sister-in-law was born in Vienna, sent on a kindertransport\nfirst to England, and from there to -- family went to Latin America before they came to the\nStates. And so we got married in \u201955.",
        "Q: And she\u2019s American?",
        "A: She\u2019s American. First son was born in \u201957. I was valedictorian of the *57 class.",
        "Q: That\u2019s quite an accomplishment. Same year, huh?",
        "A: Yup. Commencement speaker was the junior senator from Massachusetts, John Kennedy. I\ndidn\u2019t -- I wanted to design suspension bridges, I didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: You wanted to design suspension bridges --",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s -- I mean --",
        "Q: -- that was the thing.",
        "A: -- that was the thing. I didn\u2019t think about s-staying in academia, but I -- I got it -- I had very\ngood record, I got a fellowship for the first year of graduate study, department [indecipherable]\noffered me a instructorship for the sec -- for the succeeding years. So in seven and a half years, I\nhad my Ph.D.. Never paid a penny for it, because I was on the G.I. bill, and then the Illinois\nVeterans scholarship [indecipherable] so I never had -- I never had to pay tuition. And so I -- I\nstayed in academia all my life. One -- one serious consideration for one -- to work in company in\nNew York, but other than that, I stayed in academia.",
        "Q: Now, did Norma work while you were getting your Ph.D.?",
        "A: Norma worked until Gregory was born in 57.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And we were never as well off as when I -- I was a graduate student, and I had a -- the -- the\nsmall amount from G.I. bill, and the stipend. I mean, we never lived as well within our means as\nwe did then.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, I mean -- campus time -- you could go to concerts for a pittance, and -- and I\nmean, we had a -- a great life. So I became an instructor. I did be -- then things slowed down\nbecause I was working full time, I didn\u2019t get my Ph.D. til 61, when I was 30. But I was full\nprofessor by \u201965, in four years.",
        "Q: That\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: And so I -- I had a very, very satisfactory career. I got into computing very early. Took my\nfirst -- my one and only programming course in \u201957. Machine language programming. But I\naffected personally -- had a great affect on how structural engineers earn their living by taking\npart of the dull hand tracking computations off their -- off their hands and putting -- and\nsubstituting computer programs for that. So I --",
        "Q: Did you ever build a suspension bridge?",
        "A: No, I never -- no --",
        "Q: Does that make you unhappy?",
        "A: -- I -- I -- I worked -- I worked part time before -- a-as a first year graduate student, and I\ndesigned a little -- tiny little county bridge, 20 foot span and that -- I was very proud of that and -\n- and a few times when we wer -- went back to Illinois, I actually drove out to look and see how\nit was faring.",
        "Q: 20 foot.",
        "A: 20 foot span, very --",
        "Q: That\u2019s pretty nice.",
        "A: Yeah, tha-that\u2019s --",
        "Q: It\u2019s sweet.",
        "A: Yeah, but not -- my colleagues were -- two of my good friends were on the -- working on the\nMessina Strait crossing, you know, I did -- never did anything like that. But -- but I dare to say\nthat very few structures built that have not been designed with the tools that I started.",
        "Q: And prior to what you were doing, people were doing everything by hand --",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- trying to figure out everything.",
        "A: I mean, as an undergraduate this was drilled into it, that our chance of -- our livelihood\ndepended on how efficiently we could do this hand cranking procedure.",
        "Q: And you just said [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, I wa -- I was very fortunate, I -- as a young instructor, I -- no, young assistant professor,\nI had a chance to work one summer at IBM, and I got introduced to some very useful theory and\nthen I had a year\u2019s leave of absence at MIT and I had some good colleagues to work with and I\nhad a chance to -- to do something in very short order. My -- my claim to fame was finished in\n\u00b063, have been downhill ever since.",
        "Q: I doubt it.",
        "A: But -- but 38 Ph.D. students --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- first in \u201972 we moved to Carnegie-Mellon. I went there as department head. I thought, you\nknow, no big deal. Year and a half later I had a horrible, totally debilitating nervous breakdown.\nI couldn\u2019t handle promotion cases, tenure cases, lab technician firing cases. A psych -- psych -- a\npsychic-cologist -- psychiatrist and -- kept me on pills, which made me function okay, but he\ndidn\u2019t help, he was a pure Freudian. He said, \u201cHow old were you?\u201d I said 13. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s\nimpossible that something that old -- at that age could have ever affected you.\u201d So one day it\nbecame so severe that Norma didn\u2019t trust me to go by myself and she came with me to -- to the\nshrink. The way -- the reason I connected with him because I went to th -- asked the rabbi and\nthe rabbi recommended him, the guy\u2019s practice was marital conflict, and s -- 1 -- many times I\nwould say something, what does Norma think? She\u2019s -- the same thing that I do, sh -- sh -- call\nNorma and -- and were always surprised that she said the same thing I did. We walk in, we\nbarely sat down, he turns to her and says, \u201cNorma, what do you think is wrong with Steve?\u201d And\nNorma, clear out, says, \u201cSteve can\u2019t be responsible for the life and death of people.\u201d And so by\nthe time he explained to her that these were n -- not really life and death decisions, yeah, I was --\nI was done. Next -- next day I went to see the dean and resign my position. And both -- the dean\nsaid, \u201cIll let you resign if you promise to stay and to see the vice-president.\u201d He said, \u201c\u201cWhat do -\n- what are you going to do?\u201d \u201cWell, Ill go on back to te -- to what I know how to do, teaching\nand research.\u201d He said, \u201cThat\u2019s not good enough. We come to depend on you, and on your\nopinions. If you can\u2019t provide that, then there\u2019s no point your staying here.\u201d And so from -- from\n74 til -- til \u00b099, that\u2019s how I functioned at Carnegie Mellon.",
        "Q: So you stayed?",
        "A: I stayed in my -- my --",
        "Q: Asa--",
        "A: As a professor. I just gave up my administrative function.",
        "Q: Right. Did the psychiatrist ever understand the metaphor?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It didn\u2019t make any sense to him?",
        "A: Nah. No. I mean, the gu -- one day I walk in his office, he says, I\u2019m just looking at this new\nscale of trauma by the [indecipherable] the big dictionary. He says, \u201cIt scales trauma on a scale\nof one to 10, and 10 is surviving concentration camp. Tell me, was it really that bad?\u201d",
        "Q: Did you walk out?",
        "A: That [indecipherable]",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: We have to change the tape.",
        "A: Yeah, okay.\nEnd of Tape Eight\nBeginning Tape Nine",
        "Q: So Norma made the correct evaluation of your problem, and we have to stop for a second.\nOkay, so Norma made the correct evaluation and this idiot psychiatrist had no idea.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And he didn\u2019t have an idea later, either?",
        "A: Right, no.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So you remained as a professor and your symptoms went away, you did not have a --",
        "A: Ah, the de-department has been -- was always very supportive, the symptoms went away. At\npromotion and tenure proceedings, yowe -- you were expected to be a spokesperson for your\ndepartment\u2019s candidates. In very important cases the department head asked me to -- would ask\nme to represent the department, but the rules of the game were understood. If I started feeling\nqueasy, no question asked, I was off and somebody else was in my place. And that has worked.\nOccasionally -- sometimes I could go through, sometimes I could not. There\u2019s no point in\nspeculating which one -- which was which.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But yeah, my symptoms went away.",
        "Q: And how many more children did you two have?",
        "A: Yeah, we have four children. Gregory was born in \u201957, Carol in \u201959, Peter in \u201960 and then\n[indecipherable] Laura was born in \u201966. So in their childhood we used to refer to them as the kids\nand Laura because they\u2019re -- they\u2019re --",
        "Q: The kids [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But I -- I always felt that -- that she was a civilizing influence on the other three. That they --\nthey were quite wild, and -- but then when she came around they were vying for the privilege of\nbabysitting her, etcetera. Some -- so the kids, we were proud of them. I must say I was not the\nbest prepared parent during their teenage years. I couldn\u2019t quite emphasize with their concerns\nand their worries. But certainly after they left home and went through college, we\u2019ve had a\nmarvelous adult interaction with all of them, a relationship with all of them. Gregory went into\ncivil engineering. He\u2019s department chair at University of California, Berkeley. Carol went -- got\na Master\u2019s in public administration from Columbia. And from her student days on she has\nworked for the city of New York. She now works for the Department of Environmental\nResources, and we joke that she\u2019s a more serious civil engineer than either Greg or I, because she\nmanages about a billion dollars worth of construction money a year, for the sewers and s -- and\nwater se -- tre -- tre -- water supply and sewerage for New York City. Peter went off to get a\ndegree in -- in physics and math at Wesleyan, came out with a degree in English and classics.\nWent to Hopkins in their Center for the Humanities. And now has four appointments at\nNorthwestern. German, comparative literature, philosophy and social sciences, I believe.",
        "Q: Four?",
        "A: Four -- is member four departments. He has written extensively on Karnt. He was a early\nfollower of derridar and he specializes in German and Jewish philosophers and -- and writers.\nLaura has a Master\u2019s in -- Master\u2019s degree in higher education administration. She works -- she\u2019s\nhuman re -- HR director for a -- for a software firm in Silver Spring. They\u2019re all married. Four --\nfour marriages under chuppah, which we are very proud of. Greg\u2019s wife Carmel converted when\nthey wer -- got married, and she -- she\u2019s marvelous, she\u2019s the -- the [indecipherable] of the\ntemple in their -- you know, leading -- leader of all the women\u2019s activities at their temple. Carol,\nbetween her Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s spent a year in -- and they -- they have two -- two\ndaughters, Hannah and Emily. Carol, after her Bachelor\u2019s went to Israel for [indecipherable] for\na year, and met a Israeli guy and he came -- they married -- and he came and they got married,\nIthzak. He now works for the same agency as a -- as a instrument tech -- instrument supervisor\nand they have two daughters, Molly and Ilanna. Peter met Susannah at the University of\nChicago, she got her Ph.D. in English, she teaches in -- in the English department at\nNorthwestern, which makes it difficult for them to move because it\u2019s a two [indecipherable]\nwhich is hard. And they have one so -- one son, whose named Daniel Imbo, but only goes by\nImbo. She\u2019s -- she was born in Korea, she was adopted and converted when she was year and a\nhalf. And Laura is married to Steve Herberman, who grew up in -- in Potomac. He\u2019s a Jazz\nmusician, teacher at Townsend University, and probably will be teaching some -- some private\ncourses at -- at the new music center in -- at -- at Strathmore.",
        "Q: Strathmore. That\u2019s quite a family.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did it take you a long time to talk about your experiences when you were a kid? I mean, your\nHolocaust experiences?",
        "A: Yes. As I was going through -- yeah, I barely talked about it. The k-kids barely knew it,\noutlines normally, a little bit more, but barely outlines. In this depression control process in -- in\nthe early -- in early 70\u2019s, I was chair of the adult education committee at our local temple. People\nwanted a course on the Holocaust, and this lady came to give some -- some talks about the\nHolocaust and then she had to be absent for one of the lectures. And I suspected the connection, I\nknew the connection right away, I couldn\u2019t verbalize it. I volunteered to substitute for her. I\nthought that 1t might be beneficial. Norma sat in the audience, cringing and hiding behind the\nback of a large man, and that\u2019s when she heard the story from beginning to end.",
        "Q: Which she hadn\u2019t before?",
        "A: Not as a full story. A week later the rabbi called, he heard about my talk, would I repeat it to\nthe temple youth group? And I said sure, and that\u2019s when Gregory, Carol and Peter heard it the\nfirst time. Not to them, but to the youth group. And then six, seven years later, Carol was taking\na Holocaust course at the University of Michigan and her teacher invited me to come and give a\nguest lecture, and so Laura came along for the drive, just on a weekend outing with her sister,\nand she sat in the classroom.",
        "Q: And heard for the first time.",
        "A: And heard it for first time. It\u2019s largely that I didn\u2019t want to burden them, and it\u2019s largely that\nNorma wanted to shield me and shield the children. More shielding me than shielding the\nchildren.",
        "Q: Was that right? Do you think that was the right thing to do, that you -- you needed your own\ntime?",
        "A: I think yes, yeah.",
        "Q: And the kid\u2019s response? Were -- were they unhappy that they didn\u2019t know before, or they --",
        "A: No, they were very -- ver -- appreciative that they -- no, they were -- never any unhappiness\nabout that.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I think they appreciated that they were adults, that they could understand, internalize the story\nand they all -- they -- they, ever since then been very protective of me, and you know --",
        "Q: Did it bring you closer together in some ways?",
        "A: Not -- not necessarily. But, there\u2019s a closeness. And the kids are always available when --\nwhen I need it. In \u201994, there was this 60\u2122 anniversary commemoration in Subotica, very poorly\nadvertised, because they didn\u2019t know whether the government would allow it, this was height of\nMilosevic. My sister and I decided that we had to go. The women in the family were against it, it\nwas the fighting in -- in Bosnia. What if this is on CNN? What image will it project. So I decided\nI had to go. It turned out that Peter had a -- had a philosophy conference in Holland the following\nweek, so he came along for that. \u201995 I was asked to give the keynote address at the International\nConference on Computing and Civil Engineering in Berlin. The family again worried about my\ngoing, decided to delegate Greg to come with me, which was very useful. I mean, you know, he\nknew some of the people, they were short of a chair for one the sessions, so he sat -- he was a\nchair for the session. We went two days early and we drove down to Niederorschel and\nBuchenwald. And that -- that was very -- very satisfying. The night before Gregory wanted --\ntreated me to a nice dinner and at the dinner he said, \u201cDad, what is it that we are going to look\nfor?\u201d And I took a napkin and I drew a map of the pla -- of the camp. And the next noon we were\nthere, and except that somehow I tried to visualize the orientation with respect to the sun, I was\noff 180 degrees orientation, but other than that, that -- that was -- that -- the plan. So the kids\nhave always been involved that way.",
        "Q: And do you talk a lot? Since -- since you first opened up, do you -- do yo -- have you talked at\nvarious schools, or not so much?",
        "A: Oh, I -- yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Ever s -- yup. We started the -- the survivor\u2019s organization in Pittsburgh has a very, very\nactive speaker\u2019s bureau. They usually were reserving me for college talks. High school talks,\nother members of the organization would handle, so I had Washington Jefferson College in --in\nWashington, PA, Allegheny College, north of Pittsburgh. State University northeast of\nPittsburgh. I\u2019ve been repeatedly invited for -- to speak as the speaker for Holocaust week.",
        "Q: Is there anything that surprises you when you talk to these students?",
        "A: Surprises me?",
        "Q: About how -- what they question you about, or what their response is? No?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You like doing it, though?",
        "A: I did, but then I -- then I got tired be the -- the last couple years before we left Pittsburgh I\nwas doing less and less, I feel slightly burned out. But a friend who since then has become chair\nof the Holocaust Commission, runs a course at -- at Carnegie Mellon and she al -- she invited me\nregularly. There, I get essentially zero reaction from the students.",
        "Q: Zero?",
        "A: Yes. The intimate -- I think they\u2019re terribly intimidated by the fact that a professor whose\noffice is -- 1s three doors down from the classroom is talking about something --",
        "Q: Right, so personal.",
        "A: That\u2019s so personal and so far from his academic field.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I ver -- a-at student talks I usually start out by saying I\u2019m in this odd position with academics,\njealous of their scholarship, and with very few exceptions, don\u2019t want to go outside of their field\nof -- of --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- of expertise, and here I am talking about something I have no expertise whatsoever.",
        "Q: Right. Well, is there anything that you would like to talk about that I haven\u2019t asked you?",
        "A: No, I think you were very thorough and I appreciate it very much.",
        "Q: Well, I want to thank you very much, cause it\u2019s been really wonderful to spend the day with\nyou.",
        "A: I appreciate that.",
        "Q: Thank you.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: And I\u2019m very grateful for your being willing to tell us your story.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: Okay. ... And who is this, Steve?",
        "A: This is my mother. I suspect it\u2019s a -- either her high school graduation picture or one taken\neven earlier than that. I don\u2019t know anything more about it.",
        "Q: And how did you happen to ca -- to have it?",
        "A: Friends, acquaintances over the years have even gi -- either given us photographs or allowed\nus to copy from theirs. My sister has a much better collection than I have. I\u2019ve just -- most of\nthese are copies from -- from her collection.",
        "Q: And this photo?",
        "A: This is my father during World War I. He was in -- a officer in the Austro-Hungarian army,\nbecause he had spent several years in Croatia before the war, he speak -- spoke Croatian, so he\nwas assigned to a -- to a Bosnian regiment.",
        "Q: And this group?",
        "A: These are the employees of the printing plant, Minerva in Subotica, with my father and my\nuncle sitting in front. The -- my uncle was the edit -- was the owner and editor, my father was the\nmanager. And behind it is the -- the plant where the -- the printing presses were.",
        "Q: And this group?",
        "A: This is the editorial staff, again my uncle in the middle in front, and my father next to him.\nSeveral of these people became quite prominent journalists. Some of them on -- under Fascist\nHungary, a number of them in post-war Hungary. Not shown in this picture are several people\nwho had worked for my father who later came to the States. When I came to the States there was\nstill a Hungarian daily paper in New York, Detroit and Toronto, and a Hungarian literary journal\nin New York, all four of the editors had worked for my father.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Something like that.",
        "Q: This picture?",
        "A: Well this is my family at the local resort outside Subotica. I\u2019m sitting on my mother\u2019s lap and\nmy sister is in front of my father with two of my mother\u2019s friends in -- in the group.",
        "Q: What year would this have been?",
        "A: \u00b033.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s this group?",
        "A: This is my grade school, I think it must be second grade class picture. I sit next to the teacher\nand my best friend sits on the other side of the teacher an -- we were sort of the leaders of the\nboys and the two girls nex -- sitting next to me were the unquestioned leaders of the girls. The\nsecond one, in the dark dress, lives in Israel. We visit her every time we go to Israel. We once\ncoun -- counted heads. I -- I believe four people in that -- in that picture survived the Holocaust.",
        "Q: And this picture?",
        "A: This must be s -- well, no question, this is summer of th -- of 1940, one year before the\noccupation. My parents and my sister and I looking at -- I don\u2019t remember any more whether it\u2019s\na chicken coop or -- or a rabbit hutch. My father bought this fo -- small vineyard, and he tried to\n-- to grow wine and -- and make schnapps out of the -- the fruit, but 1t wasn\u2019t very successful.",
        "Q: And this shot?",
        "A: My -- th -- my sister and I. She\u2019s wearing the uniform of second year of the academic high\nschool, gymnasium, so this must be \u201940 - \u201941 academic year.",
        "Q: In Yugoslavia?",
        "A: In Yugoslavia. I obviously didn\u2019t know how to tie a tie.",
        "Q: And who\u2019s this?",
        "A: That\u2019s my sister and I in Paris, \u201947 - \u201948 - \u201949, I can\u2019t tell, but that\u2019s after we -- we got out of\nYugoslavia and -- and lived in Paris. In fact, it must be close to \u201947, because I remember that\u2019s\nthe suit in which I traveled.",
        "Q: And what does this represent?",
        "A: This is the -- a photocopy of the Buchenwald index card. On the left I\u2019m listed as a Slovakian\nJewish political prisoner, because I was -- I was pushed into a Slovakian transport. Why political\nI don\u2019t know. And my birth date I obviously intended to give 16\" -- April 16, 1929, somehow it -\n- two of the numbers got mangled, but clearly I -- I was use -- always using my sister\u2019s birth date\nwhen I -- whenever I needed a birth date in Buchenwald and throughout the concentration camp.",
        "Q: And this?",
        "A: This is my provisional identification card, issued by the American army, after the liberation in\nBuchenwald. I still use Josef -- Josef for my name, but I think I went back to June six, 1931 as\nmy birth date. And I never -- I didn\u2019t make the comparison. I see the Buchenwald number is on\nit, which I -- I -- I didn\u2019t know I had a Buchenwald number until this -- this past fall.",
        "Q: And this?",
        "A: This 1s an artist\u2019s rendering of the synagogue in Subotica, the Reform synagogues, completed\nin 1902, designed by my mother\u2019s uncle, a very well known architect of the Hungarian art\nnoveau movement. The temple now is in very bad condition. We are trying to find a way to have\nit restored. The -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s on the -- on the UNESCO register of threatened historical\nmonuments, it\u2019s on the list of Jewish threatened historical monuments, but I -- I don\u2019t know\nwhether we\u2019ll be able to save it.",
        "Q: And this to you?",
        "A: This is a copy of my father\u2019s newspaper. I guess the date is -- is 1933, December 22\u2122. So at\nthat time my uncle was still living, and so my uncle was still the editor. 36 pages, one dinar. And\nthe headlines are, \u201cThe King -- King\u2019s Visit to Zargrev. A rapprochement Between -- Friendship\nTreaty Between France and Germany Proposed by the French par -- Perfume King, and A Strike\nof the Postal Workers in Greece.\u201d In case you needed to know what the news were in 1933.",
        "Q: And this, Steve?",
        "A: This is my mother. The date is 1918, so she probably was an art student in Budapest. I\u2019m told\nthat the sketch was done by one of her classmates, whose signature appears below, Fusti Molnar\nKatalina. But I\u2019ve tried pouring over Hungarian art -- artistic -- artist\u2019s directories and artist\u2019\ndictionaries and I have never located that name. So I -- I don\u2019t know who the artist was. But this\n-- this has always hung in our house. This -- this is one of the -- the things that were in the folder\nthat our -- our cook saved for us.",
        "Q: And this?",
        "A: My mother traveled extensively, 1924 - \u201925 - \u201926 in Austria, France and Italy, and this is one\nof the etchings she made in Florence. I don\u2019t -- for li -- for lithographs I -- I know that she did\npencil drawings first and did the etchings at -- at home. I -- I -- and did the lithographs at home. I\ndon\u2019t know whether she did the same thing for the etchings, but I presume she did, that she\ndidn\u2019t have all of her -- her copper, and -- and acid and everything else that goes into etching\nwith her. So this is n -- nice view of the -- of Florence that I\u2019ve always liked.",
        "Q: And this?",
        "A: This is one of her lithographs, it\u2019s also Florence. Think a little bit more Impressionistic than\nthe etching. The -- my father\u2019s printing plant had a large, flat -- flatbed press with a large stone\nnormally used for making maps, and I\u2019m sure that that\u2019s what my mother used to -- to pull the\nlithographs.",
        "Q: And who is this good looking group?",
        "A: This is my family at my granddaughter\u2019s Bat Mitzvah, two years a -- three years ago. My wife\nand I in front and our four children, Gregory, Peter, Carol and Laura and their spouses, and my\nson-in-law Ithzak\u2019s family in the back row. And the grandchildren, six grandchildren, including\nthe one on the side, that -- that\u2019s in bo -- that 1s in Chicago, and the other boy 1s here in Silver\nSpring and we have mo -- much more actively than any of the others, we have been involved in\nhis -- in his growth, which has been very satisfying.\nEnd of Tape Nine\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "Q: No. And she wasn\u2019t trying to impose her belief on you --",
        "Q: -- she was just clearly Catholic?",
        "Q: Huh. Did you like going to the church?",
        "Q: Ah, cause you were wearing shorts.",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: So everybody had to leave the theater who was with you --",
        "Q: I guess, to take you there. And vacations, you took at various times during the year, or mainly\nduring the summer?",
        "Q: Now, you know what I was thinking, given the relationship of your mother\u2019s family to your\nfather, does this mean that when they got married there was no dowry, which would have been\ntraditional, because they didn\u2019t go to the wedding, I gather.",
        "Q: You think they must have?",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: Wa -- why -- oh, and why was it surprising that they were political prisoners?",
        "Q: By the greens?",

        "Q: You thought she might have been --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: And her condition, was she okay?",
        "Q: Yeah. So what did it mean for you to be in this group? Were they really doing resistance,\nwere they doing it --",
        "Q: So what -- what would it be for you to hand off? Is this a bartering system?",
        "Q: So people would have names, so they would know --",

        "Q: And where do the lists come from? They weren\u2019t -- w-were they paying for [indecipherable]",

        "Q: And are you involved with people who are mainly doing informational resistance, or are they\nalso connected with the people who are going to do an uprising?",
        "Q: But there was an uprising, so that there was physical resistance because the crematoria was\nblown up, right?",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: So they protected you, it\u2019s not like as if you were in a protected kommando so that the SS\nwouldn\u2019t get you. It\u2019s that the -- that these men themselves were protecting you.",

        "Q: -- right?",
        "Q: Doing this, can you conceive of yourself in this, or just this seems like, well it\u2019s my history,\nit\u2019s just the way it was.",

        "Q: So what was that like for you? On the one hand they\u2019re protecting you, on the other hand --",
        "Q: Did it make you feel f -- strange, as a Jewish person, or not want to be Jewish, or that didn\u2019t\noccur to you?",
        "Q: So those years of living under the Hungarian occupation, while there\u2019s not violence so much -",
        "Q: -- there\u2019s still a lot of anti-Semitism. So do you think you start getting used to it, you just\nexpect this to be the case for a lot of people?",
        "Q: Cause certainly it doesn\u2019t seem to be easy to accept it.",
        "Q: Now, do you kno -- are -- are you still involved at -- where are you living? Are you living in\nB2 bi -- D, or are you living 1n the same place that you began?",

        "Q: You know this?",
        "Q: So you -- you don\u2019t have much of an expectation of surviving this?",

        "A: Ah -- yeah, he was a serious guy, he -- he would -- enjoyed helping his workers. Several\npeople started small businesses.

My\nunderstanding is that she did some artwork for my father\u2019s newspaper and that\u2019s how they met.\nMy understanding is that the family was opposed to the marriage and they sent her off on a grand\ntour, and the few pieces of -- of her work that we have is mostly \u201825 - \u201826 - \u201827, Vienna, Italy,\nFrance.

        "A: Yeah. I remember after the war, after we returned from Auschwitz, a new -- a crop of teachers\ncame, and I presumed school in -- in Serbian. And there was this literature teacher who came\nstorming in the -- in the room and handed out papers with terrible grades on that. He said, \u201cNone\nof you think Serbian, you just all think Hungarian and then translate it into Serbian.\u201d And we\ntook that as a terrible affront, a terrible insult.

        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: German was very important to them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: At first I had -- I remember I had terrible sep -- separation anxieties in -- in kindergarten.\nThey delegated me to recite a poem about motherhood and I couldn\u2019t get through it, I broke into\ntears.",
        "A: But after that, it was -- it was great, yeah. Again, Yugoslavia was a dirt poor country. It had\ncompulsory education except it couldn\u2019t afford it. So any organization, religious community,\netcetera, that could put up a building and hire three teachers, the government supplied the fourth\nteacher and it became a government school. So they -- directly ac-cross the street from our\nhouse, in the -- in the courtyard of the -- of the synagogue was the Jewish grade school. I mean,\nit was a state school, but it was run by the Jewish community. Probably 80 percent of the\nstudents Jewish.",
        "A: And that\u2019s where I went for first four grades. I -- I liked it a lot.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Jews -- well, again, Subotica had about 6000 Jews.",
        "A: Divided, from what I understand, sort of equally between one large Reform congregation, and\nmult -- multiple, multiple small shuls. The -- the Jewish community was very divided. They --\nthose that immigrated -- that came from -- came in the middle of the -- of the 19\" century,\nmostly from Arabia and Bohemia, n-now Czechoslovakia, where German speaking touched by\nthe Mendelssohn [indecipherable] enlightment and belong to a Reform congregation in ha --\nhung -- Hungary had a three way split th -- Reform, which it was called neolog, and the\nOrthodox, and a third group that didn\u2019t last very long called sinaqua al -- as before, that didn\u2019t\naccept the separation. So there was this large Reform congregation, a huge temple designed by\nmy great uncle. I don\u2019t like the word assimilated, I -- I think acculturated 1s a better term. The\nother half came almost exclusively from across the mountains, from Galicia, touched by -- you\nknow, influenced by Baal Shem Tov and Hassidism and there was very little contact between the\ntwo communities.",
        "A: It\u2019s very divided. The -- now, to ans -- long answer to question, the Orthodox community was\nhighly concentrated. The Reform Jews lived all -- all over town, all over the better parts of the\ntown, so it wasn\u2019t a Jewish neighborhood at all.",
        "A: My school friends were largely Jewish. Yeah, I had so -- some neighborhood friends who\nwere not Jewish, but most -- most of my friends were -- were Jewish.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Or the six percent in the town.",
        "A: Absolutely not, I didn\u2019t --",
        "A: -- that -- that existed.",
        "A: I mean, that all started with the war in 1941.",
        "A: Oh yes, I -- I -- ye -- well, my mother\u2019s brother emigrated to the States in the 1920\u2019s. She --\nshe had a -- the ticket for the maiden voyage of the Normandy in \u201939 to visit her brother, to go to\nthe World\u2019s Fair. And she decided not to go because the war made -- might break out and she\nmight not be able to get back.",
        "A: So, yeah, lot of things I remember. I me -- one -- one thing I clearly remember, the radio\nmaking the announcement that the -- the [indecipherable] the cardinal, whose name just escapes\nme was elected Pope Pius, and my father said, \u201cThat\u2019s bad for the Jews.\u201d I remember that.",

        "A: Well --",
        "A: I was ultra-Reform, but still, men wore hats, women were on the second floor, service was\nentirely in Hebrew, except for one prayer for the king once a year.",
        "A: Serbian.",
        "A: But -- but 1n comparison to -- to -- to the Orthodox, it was considered ultra-Reform. A main\nfactor is that the synagogue had a -- had an organ.",
        "A: Which is what -- what really set apart the two communities.",
        "A: But on Yom Kippur -- I\u2019m -- I mean Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, we went to the services\nthen for Yithzcore, the children were chased out and we were running around the courtyard.

A -- a teacher who was a very strong Zionist, and we were taught not just\nHebrew for the services, but we were taught the language spoken in Eretz Israel. And since\nschool went on til noon on Saturday, after lunch on Saturday was a children\u2019s service in the\nsmall subsidiary chapel, which -- which was sort of a interesting event because a -- you know,\nthere was no Kaddish itha -- and -- and the [indecipherable] at which all hell broke loose,\nbecause at two o\u2019clock the matinee started in the three cinemas and everybody was running at\nfull speeds to get out of the service to get -- to get to the --",

And to a lot of people it was sort of a holiday at first.",
        "A: Yes, my uncle owned a bank and he took down the -- the Serbian sign and behind it was the\noriginal Hungarian name of the bank. And lot of people did that. And so the Hungarian army\nmarched in. A small amount of resistance, a few pockets of -- of -- of gunfire. And on that day or\nthe following day, a officer appeared in my father\u2019s office and ordered him out at gunpoint, and\nthat --",
        "A: Yeah, and that was that, they -- the plant was confiscated, newspaper taken over. A Aryan\nadministrator was appointed, who kept all the charges -- directed all the charges to my father and\nmy -- my aunt\u2019s personal accounts.",
        "A: And in weeks he -- he bleeded everything that the two families had in cash. A third of the\napartment was requisitioned for housing Hungarian officers. Cook, maid, governess left the same\nday, even before the ordinance came that Jews were not allowed to have --",
        "A: Yup.",
        "A: So, a very intense shock. We lucked out with the -- with -- with the quartering, because the\nthree officers who were -- who were quartered in the house were -- one was a -- one was a Count\nEsterhazy, one was a Count Karolyi, the son of the prime minister just before World War I. The\nthird one I don\u2019t remember, but also a count. Great gentlemen. Oh, we understand that\nMadame\u2019s cook has left, our servant man would -- whatever the -- the -- the orderly, is at\nMadame\u2019s disposal for whatever Madame wishes.

        "A: Gymnasium. And the Hungarian numerus clausus law was put into effect, the number of Jews\nadmitted equaled the number of -- the proportion of the Jews of the population. So eight -- it was\ndecreed that eight Jews would be admitted. And that summer, my father had nothing else to do,\nso he coached me all summer in Hungarian literature and history, which I knew nothing about,\nwhich I had no exposure to. And so I took the exam. Were rough, very hostile questioning. I\nremember one, wh -- where did the Hungarian renaissance king defeat the Turks, the only\nsuccessful battle against the Turks. And I knew the answer was Belgrade, but I knew that if I\ngave the Serbian pronunciation, that would be curtains. I didn\u2019t know the Hungarian prun --\npronunciation. Then I remembered that Belgrade means white castle and Feher Var is white\ncastle in Hungarian, that was the -- the Hungarian name. And then I knew -- I remember enough\nof my grammar that the declension o-of Var is irregular. And to say at Belgrade, you had to say\nFeher Var otage and not Feher Var ohn. And I said that, and the guy said fine. And --",

My sister was not -- I don\u2019t\nknow if she didn\u2019t take the exam or -- or wasn\u2019t admitted, I don\u2019t remember, but she went to a\nparochial school. The -- the -- this particular order of nuns and a order of -- of teaching priests\ncalled the en -- the Piarists, rel -- related to the Jesuits but not Jesuits.

And the following morning, as an interpreter, I could be\nout in front when the soup arrived. And I looked around, the row of barracks was empty. There\nwere inmates clearing and later whitewashing the barracks. And what was most startling is that\nthe kapos that supervised them had red triangles. So one o -- one of them, man by name Tadek,\ncame over and said that he needed an interpreter who spoke Polish, German and Hungarian. And\nI said Serbian and Polish are close enough, I volunteered.

And there was a third one by name of Piotr, who\nwas a Russian studying in Poland, who was caught up and was deported with the Poles. And he\nwas by far the most entrepreneurial and enterprising of all of them.",

They -- the compound backed onto the railroad side\n[indecipherable]. We would -- when a train arrived, we would be there sweeping the gravel\nbetween the last barrack and the -- and the electrified fence. Guard towers at either end.\nOccasionally whis -- whistle would sound, you would look up and tins of sardines, other thing\nliberatable. You know, liberating was the -- the codeword to stealing, or flying over the fence,\nfrom the inmates who were cleaning the trains. So that\u2019s how you started accumulating black\nmarket goods. Piotr -- well, I had my -- my duties, I was an interpreter. Very often German\npeople were lined up, German foreman will -- would come. I would walk behind them and do\nwhatever translating, if -- if they had questions for the inmates. And most inmates always\npretended that they didn\u2019t know German, whether they knew it or not. So I would translate.\nOccasionally I actually esc -- was ordered to go up to the front, to the SS barracks at the top of\nthe compound and escort the German to the -- to the site, to whatever barrack they were selecting\nfrom, and then escort them back.",
        "A: Past the -- passing the gallows every day twice, it was not -- not pleasant. But in addition to\nthat, eventually Piotr organized a roof repair detail. And we went from compound to compound\npretending to patch roofs.",

And another time\n-- shoes were always an issue, and mine were -- were again, very beaten up and Tadek saw a pair\non a man, a pair of ski boots that he thought would be good for me and made him take them off\nand take my broken down shoes, and he gave him a loaf of bread.

And all I could think of is slide under bed\n[indecipherable] bed with the bedcover to the floor, and then it was over and they started asking\neach other whether they had seen me or whether the SS woman had taken me, and then I climbed\nout from under the bed.

And I said no, I don\u2019t know if anything that -- that -- ?ve seen\nmany women\u2019s selections, I\u2019ve never seen women being selected on the basis of looks. I lied, but\nI --",

        "A: Some -- some were better than others. You know, don\u2019t ask me why, but that\u2019s --",
        "A: -- that\u2019s what they were talking about, so I knew what this meant.",
        "A: From mid -- end of June til mid-October, July, August, September, four months.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, the conditions were getting harsher and harsher, and the kapos decided to smuggle me\nout. And they were looking for a safe transport because the word was that sometimes people\nwere turned around at the railroad siding and taken to the gas chambers. So this one transport\nappeared safe, they pushed me in the line. I -- I got tattooed -- no, everything gets counted. One\nof the kapos, I don\u2019t know if it was Tadek, I don\u2019t remember any more, went up, who -- who will\ntrade places with this boy, we\u2019ll give you food and we\u2019|l make sure that you get out on another\ntransport. And this man volunteered and I was pushed in. Piotr slipped me a gold watch in my\nhand, he -- for the doctor. So we were stripped, examined. Had a Jewish inmate doctor\nexamining. I passed him the watch, he said, \u201cThank you, I would have passed you anyhow.\u201d",

        "A: B13174. Shower, cold shower in October. At the next station Piotr appears and shoves a\nbundle of clothes in my hand, including the -- the ski boots, which I left with him and he -- and\nso I was quite well dressed. I have -- I\u2019m sure it was a woman -- woman \u2019s tight fitting ski jacket,\nbecause it buttoned like a woman\u2019s jacket, and my boots and an overcoat, which just had a stripe\npainted in the back, not the cut in.",
        "A: Not the piece of striped clothe cut in, which is what all the other clothes were.",

        "A: Blue and -- and gray stripes.",

        "A: Yup. Yeah.",
        "A: Well, th-the -- the -- the processing line involves a absolutely cursory medical examination,\nand that was a inmate doctor who was doing it.",

        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Well amid this -- this incredible barbarity and filth, there was also the German fascination\nwith cleanliness. And all these slogans in the barracks, where you had to use pebbles to wipe\nyourself, there were big slogans on the wall about healthy body keeps you alive and God knows\nwhat else. So ever -- every process involved a shower in cold water and -- and disinfection of\nsome -- walking through some disinfectant like [indecipherable] and I mean, that\u2019s was just part\nof the routine.",
        "A: Aaartrgh.",
        "A: No soap.",

        "A: It\u2019s cold weather.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Right. And there were -- I was naked and shivering, running from one barrack to the next with\nmy bundle of clothes, and a guard stops me and he said, \u201cWhere are you going? How old are\nyou? What is your birth date?\u201d And I said, \u201cApril 16, 1929,\u201d because the -- the kapos drilled me\nto use my sister\u2019s birthday so I -- that I would appear older. And he say -- said okay, and he\npassed me. So -- so we got dressed, marched to the trains, and I remember very long wait on the\nsiding. Eventually the train started. Three days on the train.",
        "A: Three days. Wa -- once a day we were let out.",
        "A: Right, right, yes.",
        "A: Right. I remember looking in the window. I remember seeing kids my age romping in the\nsnow and building snowmen and thinking about that.",
        "A: I guess so.",
        "A: I guess so. And so eventually we arrive, railroad siding. We get out, station sign says\nNiederorschel, and barking orders from an SS. A few words from German foreman, translation\nby Hungarian interpreter. And then to my horror, the German foreman comes up to me and says,\n\u201cWhy are you here, I did not select you.\u201d I was the one who escorted him in Auschwitz through\nthe sel -- through the selection.",
        "A: Yeah. So this was one thing that the kapos didn\u2019t train me for, and so I thought very fast and I\nsaid, \u201cWell sir, with this many new m -- inmates, they decided that you need another interpreter\nand I was sent as an interpreter.\u201d And he shrugged his shoulders and said okay. And we were left\n-- let into this --",
        "A: No, German civilian --",
        "A: -- foreman.",
        "A: So Niederorschel was these two [indecipherable] but now I know is a textile factory right next\nto a railroad siding and a plywood factory further up, were enclosed as a camp, with a narrow\nwalkway between them with barb wire fence. And we were marched into this dining room and\nsat at tables and there was warm meal, which was quite a shock. And we were all eating and the\nHungarian interpreter and another guy who I was very close to later, came in, sat down, really\ncrowding me on both sides. Who are you, where are you from, how come your clothes are\ndifferent, how come the foreman knew you?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yes. I was very s -- I was very scared. So I tried to explain myself. That evening I\nwas taken into this little side room of where the two kapos lived, both German -- German\npolitical prisoners, both of them communists and in prison since 1933.",
        "A: Oh -- it -- in -- next month, in April, the 60\" anniversary of the liberation of Niederorschel,\nthere\u2019s a ceremony, including the Israeli ambassador to Germany. The kapo is -- kapo\u2019s family 1s\nreceiving a posthumous award as a Righteous Gentile, because only -- only 19 people died there.",
        "A: Yup. And that was due entirely -- entirely to him. So the quest --",
        "A: Otto -- P'Il think of it in a minute. I have the invitation from the ambassador on -- on my desk.\nOtto -- no.",
        "A: So, the questioning. The two kapos in German, a Gypsy who -- who was the camp orderly, I-I\nforget what language we -- we usually sp -- spoke. Polish, a couple of the -- the labor orderly\nwho was Czech, all crowding around me and questioning me. And, so at -- at the end of that\nnight, I convinced them. And I was only 13 years old, but I was accepted as -- as a full member\nof their resistance organization.",
        "A: Once a plant, a plant, a -- a -- a --",
        "A: A German plant, a -- a [indecipherable] I mean, I did stick out like a sore thumb.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, so --",
        "A: I mean, a collection of clothes, yeah.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: No, but it was bet -- better fitting, warmer.",
        "A: I was better -- yup, right, right.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I mean, yeah right.",
        "A: Yeah. I told the Gypsy -- orderly wanted to know about the Gypsies, I said -- that was one of\nthe very difficult things I remember. I told him a -- what I had witnessed. This young Slovak Jew\nwanted to know about the women. I lied to him, but I -- I thought I had to, and I answered all of\ntheir questions and I convinced them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, all right, let me tell you a little bit about Niederorschel. There is the story -- okay,\nNiederorschel was a factory producing wings for Messershit -- schmitt fighter planes.",
        "A: It\u2019s sub -- yeah, in Buchenwald, right, right.",
        "A: Yup. About 700 inmates, about 50 or 60 German civilian workers. 12 hour work shifts, six\nand a half days a week. Every 30 minutes the bell rings and the wing moves up on the assembly\nline from one station to the next station. That was the life. Food somewhat better than Auschwitz\n-- it\u2019s better than Auschwitz. Fortunately there was this absolutely first rate Czech cook. He was\nfat, he was really fat, who, I don\u2019t know how he did it. Kitchen scraps from the guard\u2019s food, \u2019'm\nsure table scraps from the guard\u2019s food. Vegetables that the si -- the town crew managed to steal\nor whatever. He provided some taste and some variety to the -- to the daily soup. So it was -- life\nwas on the edge of being bearable, not quite. I still, after all of these years I think back with\namazement at what people in this circumstance still managed to do. Obviously there were\nshoemakers who could prepare your shoes with sole from discarded tires that the grounds crew\nfound and shoe nails that were cut from scrap lumber. Obviously there were tailors who -- who\nwith needle and thread gotten on the black market from the -- from the civilians could fix your\nclothes. Those kinds of things you expect. You don\u2019t expect to see these two brothers, Hungarian\nJews deported from Holland, diamond grinders by trade, who ground prescription glasses out of\nbottoms of discarded milk bottles. Jewelers who took scraps of aluminum from the plant and\ncreated these carved boxes that could be traded. Beautifully carved, elaborately carved boxes.\nSome others made these very elaborate boxes out of pleated s-straw that could be bartered with\nthe -- with the German civilians for ne -- needle, thread, soap, tobacco, few things. There were\nabout five or six -- maybe five to eight kids my age, mostly, as I said, Budapest with their\nfathers. One -- one kid I remember from Transylvania with his father. These gentlemen decided\nthat our education could not be interrupted, so after 12 hours workday, they sat us down, classes\nin algebra and French. Oh, everything, of course, was punishable by death, particularly\nsmuggling o-out of the plant. Everybody who had a opportunity smuggled out scrap aluminum,\nscrap tools, sharpening them into weapons at night. The lights went out about half an hour after\nmeals were served. You could hear for hours stone bowl -- pebbles being scraped against metal\nto create wa -- knives. I was very proud of a knife I made for myself out of a -- a -- a hacksaw\nblade. There were -- of the 700, probably a hundred were Soviet POWs. The Germans did not\nhonor the Geneva convention, and the Soviet POWs were in the same boat as we were. And\nsome of them were the strongest, in terms of trying to make weapons. Training for a uprising.\nThrowing knives. Many of them had fashioned these heavy knives with very heavy handles and\npracticed.",
        "A: Yes. You asked about my role. First few weeks I was on -- on the detail with the -- under the\nGypsy orderly that went to town to -- for collect -- for getting goods that -- bread and vegetables\nand that was brought in from the local market. I was well enough dressed, if the other inmates\ndetracted the guards attention, I could sn-sneak in the apothecary and with Reichsmarks from the\nblack market, get aspirin and medication that the medic wanted; to get ethyl alcohol for Molotov\nbombs.",
        "A: For Molotov cocktails.",
        "A: Then the SS lieutenant decided I was not strong enough to carry these loaves of bread, and so\nthey put me from that detail to the factory, and next to the Hungarian interpreter, the next to the\nlast line on the assembly line, the inspection line. I was given a dentist mirror, and it was my job\nto look at every single rivet to see that it was properly driven. Badly -- 0-occasionally -- I mean,\nsabotage was going all the time. Occasionally I would see a rivet that -- that wasn\u2019t right. I could\npass it, occasionally I could stop. Our station was the only one that could stop the assembly line\nto drill out a rivet and insert the explosive driven rivet, that you apply heat on the top and the\nbottom explodes and that tightens the -- the connection. Whatever sabotage we could do, we --\nwe did. It didn\u2019t really matter because it turns out -- well, eventually, by January, the railroad\nline was bombed. We were getting fewer and fewer parts, and the wing -- the partial wings that\nwe produced were piled in the snow outside, was no place to put them. The story I heard -- it\u2019s th\n-- it\u2019s known that no single wing produced here ever flew.",
        "A: Yeah, the Germans made this a known -- the camp was only started in the spring of \u201944. The\nGermans made this enormous effort to disperse war production because of the bombings. And\nnone o -- not all of it worked. In fact, I\u2019ve heard a rumor that this was a ruse by a small group of\npeople to -- to found this factory and escape from being drafted to the eastern front. How true it\nis, I don\u2019t know. So -- so life was little bit more bearable, much more to do. Looking forward to\nthat half day on Sunday afternoon where we had a little rest. Then as spring -- as weather became\n-- came to war -- warm up in -- in March, we would -- especially the Russians would set along\nthe fence, which was the promenade to the townspeople, and -- and sing Soviet songs loudly,\nwhich upset the promenade -- naders. That was the life. As I said, only 19 people died. Two were\nSoviet POWs that escaped, were brought back -- were captured by German civilians, brought\nback and they were ha -- hanged. I have the list of the others, got it last November. But mortality\nwas -- was quite low -- were -- I mean, remarkably low.",
        "A: Yup.",
        "A: After work.",
        "A: After you eat, yeah.",
        "A: Half an hour.",
        "A: I mean, we were all asleep, but --",
        "A: -- we were all asleep by halfway through, but I guess [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right, oh yes, sure, yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I -- I -- I was -- again, there was a fairly -- especially if you have red -- yellow\nstar, there was a fairly sharp dividing line between the religious Jews and the secular Jews. I was\na -- in the -- the room -- there was some self selection, who went to what room. I was certainly in\none of the rooms that was very secular, but they -- the -- the religious ferwer was -- was equally\nimpressive. I mean, to know the entire daily and Sabbath prayer book by heart, I mean that\u2019s for\n-- taken for granted. To know the parsha, the -- the week\u2019s Torah portion and Aftorah portion by\nheart, well, there was always room for debate, th-the great Talmudic debates on -- on what was\nthe correct memory. All of the festivals are observed, every -- I mean, yeah they -- they -- the\nOrthodox inmates were totally immersed in -- in their religion. So we knew there -- most of the\nworkers just sort of came and went as if we were invisible. You know, very little contact. One of\nthem ev -- every day, would eat his lunch and read his paper and then make sure that he got my\neye and he made -- and signal on where he was hiding the paper, so that later, just before we\nwere herded back to the -- the barracks, I could retrieve the paper and bring it in the barracks. So\nwhatever the German newspaper said, we knew that. So, April first, we had just finished -- I -- I\nfinished work is no longer ap-appropriate. We just finished our 12 hours and went back in the\nbarracks, the whistle sounded and they were moving -- moving us out. There was a big debate in\nthe kapos rooms. Lot of people would -- lot of people wanted to stage an uprising. We had\ncounterfeit keys to all of the guards\u2019 rooms. That\u2019s not eas -- not hard to do. The inmates were --\nwere taking the -- the food across several locked doors. With the key you just chew some -- some\nbread dough in your mouth, make an impression in the key and there were locksmith who could\nduplicate that. The SS, the officers were living upstairs, we didn\u2019t think we could get to them. So\nthere was a big debate and the kapo decided that -- that we didn\u2019t know where the American\nfront was. It seemed to have slowed down after the -- after the Battle of the Bulge, that we would\nmarch out. The kapo gave orders to the leaders of the brigades that everybody was free to escape\nif they could. The cook had some emergency rations. Chicory grounds, molasses, something that\nyou could carry, and we were marched out.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, I was -- well, yes, but when it came to the vote in the room, the Czech work orderly and I\nvoting no swung the -- sw-swung the balance. I could have voted for --",

        "A: Yeah. They were -- the officers were SS. The guards were Wehrmacht, regular army\nreservists in their 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s. I mean, tottering old men, but still, they had automatic\nrifles.",

        "A: Towards Buchenwald, yes, towards Weimar --",
        "A: -- right, right. Escapes almost every night, shootings I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- most every night. People\nfalling behind shot and left to die in the -- left dead in the -- in the gutter. Farmers watching us,\nstanding in their fields, clutching their pitchforks. Walking through these -- marching through\nthese villages. People peering out behind lace curs -- curtains. We went through Sonderheim,\nwhich was an only large city on the way, broken up cobblestone streets, and that city had been\nbombed. So it was very long march, very arduous. The follo -- we were being marched with the\nguards on the side, following the train -- following the marchers was a very old army truck, with\na platform in the back, on which the relief guards slept, and it also carried couple rows of a barb\nwire fence which they used to enclose every night. And pulled this, which was obviously World\nWar I vintage field kitchen, which sometimes worked and most of the time didn\u2019t work, so\nsometimes we had ersatz coffee or some -- something resembling soup. Most of the time we\ndidn\u2019t.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: So after eight days we arrived at another satellite ca-camp called Berlsteed, which some of the\nold time prisoners recognized. That had been a brick factory which produced the -- the bricks for\nBuchenwald and for the other camps. So we had a little bit more freedom cause we\u2019re inside the\nfence, inside the barb wire fence, and not the enclosure of rolls. And we had some food. We also\nfound some -- some frozen potatoes on the ground and everybody started making fires and -- and\ngrilling these potatoes and usually get -- taking them out barehanded before they were cooked.\nAnd suddenly we were called to a -- a second appel. A contingent of SS guards came in a truck\nfrom -- from Buchenwald, replaced our Wehrmacht guards, and these officers took count. In the\nofficer\u2019s staff car was an inmate, and even it was dusk I could recognize first the red triangle on\nhis chest, and the red beret on his head. So as dusk was falling and the officers were chatting, I\ninched up to him. The guar -- the -- the -- the kapo was sitting on the running board of the SS\nstaff car and I inched up to him and sort of crouched without looking at him, as -- as if there was\nno contact. And he said, \u201cDo you speak Polish?\u201d Yes. \u201cYou have a resistance group?\u201d Yes.\n\u201cSend me one of them.\u201d All I could say is, \u201cI\u2019m one of them, you can talk.\u201d And he said,\n\u201cWhatever you do, stall. Buchenwald is being emptied, trainloads of Jewish prisoners are -- are\nbeing taken -- taken in open cars. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, we don\u2019t have control.\u201d The\nre-resistance organization in Buchenwald was always very strong. \u201cWe don\u2019t have control, stall.\u201d\nSo I shuffled back to the -- actually I ran back because a SS sergeant was kicking at me, ran back\nand when we were bedded down, I reported that to the kapo and the -- the others. How do we\nstall? And this Czech government bureaucrat who was a high level -- I think he was deputy\nsecretary of something in Czech Republic, he realized what we had to do, that the SS took e --\nthat up to that point the local SS were in charge, they could do whatever they wanted. Now a\ncount had been taken up to Buchenwald, our SS had to deliver that many bodies, dead or alive\nwhen they arrive in Buchenwald. There\u2019s no -- no question. So if some people would hide, the\ncount would come short. Well the -- the Gypsy orderly had been in -- in bel -- Berlsteed, he\nknew where the brick ovens were, and it was decided that three of -- he and two others would\nhide in the brick ovens at night. We woke up, our kapo -- our -- SS took a head count, it was\nthree short. So they were thr -- dispatching people all -- all -- guards all over to search, we just\nstood at attention for a good part of the day. They he -- the SS lieutenant singled out the\norganization, he knew everybody. Others were allowed to -- to sit, to lie down, we were\nstanding. He threatened to start killing us. Nothing happened. He s -- that\u2019s when he sent all but\nfour to six guards for another search. And that was when I thought that they -- he -- that Vladya,\nRussian off-officer would yell one word and the breakout would start. I knew that. Facing the\nguards were all the -- the sharpshooters with their heavy knives. And I expected that those people\nwould -- would kill the guards and get their guns and s -- and face the other guards coming back.\nAnd then, for the first time that I recall, we heard the sound of -- of gunfire from the west. I -- I\ndon\u2019t recall having it er -- having heard it earlier. I don\u2019t know how -- how far the front was, I --\nI never checked. I could check by date on where the front was. But anyhow, the SS chickened\nout, and decided to march us out. Long, torturous, very difficult walk up the steep slope.\nBuchenwald means beech forest, and the camp 1s at the tip of this somewhat sizable hill. The SS\nmade the resistance group march in front and SS officer behind us and then rest of them. The\ninmates -- and it was definitely silence, and everybody was shuffling, and I decided I had\nsomething to -- I had to do something, and I stopped as if to tie my shoe, and turned around and\nyelled pasnia in Russian, a song. And the Russians heard me and pretty soon the entire column\nwas singing. And that was a tremendous relief. Me -- I mean, we all we -- on Sundays, the\nSunday afternoons we were singing Russian songs, Polish partisan songs, Yiddish songs. Never\nHungarian songs. Nobo -- nobody Hungarian wanted anything Hungarian. We were singing\nelements of -- of the choral movement of the Ninth Symphony, because that was a -- one of the\nmusicians from the Budapest orchestra taught it to us. So that singing started and that somehow\ngot people the -- the strength to march the last couple of kilometers up -- uphill, and we arrived\nat the gate in Buchenwald.",
        "A: [speaks Russian here] A Russian folk song, the -- the Volga -- the Volga boatman song, some\npartisan songs.",
        "A: That -- that was a -- a big lift. So we arrive at the gate of Buchenwald, which was described to\nme by the people who had been there, and we marched in. First thing I noticed that the\ncrematorium, the chimney was -- was cold, there was no smoke coming out of the chimney,\nwhich I thought was a good sign. We were marched through the sanitation delousing area right at\nthe top, and that was a good sign. And we were faced by a group of -- of political prisoners in the\nred beret coming to meet us. On that day there were no more transports out, there were no more\nSS inside the camp, and the resistance organization controlled the camp. So -- so we were\nmarched in one of the barracks and told to go to sleep, and I fell asleep. And I don\u2019t have a very\nheroic closing because next thing I remember is in following day at mid-afternoon, somebody\nshook my shoulder to say that the Americans were there.",
        "A: Yeah, in many ways it did. We all raced up to the -- to the barb wire fence, we yelled, and I\ntried to catch somebody\u2019s attention and report on the -- on the crimes of the SS lieutenant that I\nknew of, and then I collapsed against the fence. Spent six weeks in a field hospital run by the\nAmerican army.",
        "A: Ah -- buchenw -- you\u2019ve not been to Buchenwald.",
        "A: On top. The camp is that side, on the other side is the crescent of these large buildings which\nwere SS barracks, which now house the museum, library, etcetera. In 24 hours, Americans\nconverted that to one field hospital, recruiting nurses and doctors from [indecipherable] I don\u2019t\nknow how many thousand of people were there. So I was there for --",

        "A: While I was there in the hospital, a rabbi from the Backa area came by. He -- he was taking\nnames of liberated inmates from the Backa area, and came to interview me. I said ah sa --\nSubotica. Date of birth -- 16 -- April 1929 and s -- s -- wait a minute. He goes through notebooks\nand says, you have a twin. So he had met -- seen my sister in Bergen-Belsen, and so that\u2019s how I\nknew that she was there. She was alive. So yeah, the Iron Curtain was down in \u201945. Not -- didn\u2019t\nwait for Truman -- for Churchill\u2019s speech. The French, Norwegians, Danes, Dutch, Belgians\nwere out of there in 48 hours. The people who wanted to go to the Soviet side were there for\nweeks and weeks and weeks. I was informed when I registered with the American -- that there\nwas a provision for DP orphans to be sent directly to the States. And they notified my uncle who\nwas a doctor in -- in New York, that they found me. And my ga -- my uncle would take me --\nand I said no, I can\u2019t do that.",

They were in the\nYugoslav army, and they were coming out daily, whenever a returning train was coming, they\ndid that regularly. So we went to our -- my Gentile aunt\u2019s house. Going back to my house made\nno sense. So I stayed there. Couple weeks later my sister came back omai -- on a train from\nBergen-Belsen. And then in late August, maybe early September, my father came back on a\nRussian hospital train. I still have the admission diagnosis from the Russian mi -- military\nhospital. Angina, kidney failure, 15 serious maladies, from a coal mine in Silesia. But he came\nhome. He tried to start a new life. He was told that if he asked for the plant they\u2019re going to try\nhim for collaboration with the enemy because he didn\u2019t put up armed resistance when the plant\nwas taken away. He eked out a miserable living, and he died sixth of February, 1946. Three\nmonths after he came back. Totally broken, physically, emotionally.",

        "A: -- which said let\u2019s start from scratch, throw away all the accumulated quotas that were not\nexercised during the war. Yugoslav quota is 400 year or something like that, but it wasn\u2019t\nexercised since \u201941. I would ha -- you know, if Truman hadn\u2019t vetoed that I would never have\nbeen here. In between we tried various places where we could go, with our two cousins and that\ndidn\u2019t work out, because we had affidavits from my uncle on the maternal side. They eventually\nwound up in Venezuela and we came to the States. So we went to Chicago because that\u2019s where\nour uncle lived.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, tremendously.",
        "A: I mean, we lived -- I mean, miserably. You know, I -- when I went -- on weekend you decide\nwhether to use your money to eat or to go to the -- the weekly visit to the se -- to the public baths\nto -- to take a shower. You know, it\u2019s a different level of living than -- than what you normally is\n-- are accustomed to. But -- but it was great, I mean, yeah, I mean every other -- in most respects\nit was great.",
        "A: I was the token refugee in this high school which was very upper class French high school. I\nmean, several of my classmate\u2019s fathers were still in prison for -- for their role in the Vichy\ngovernment. I felt very well accepted.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Seven -- yeah.",
        "A: Right. Well, it didn\u2019t matter.",
        "A: No, no. We were quite self-sufficient. My -- I no longer keep conta -- I kept contact for a\ncouple decades with my classmates from high school. You know, the -- the number of people\nwho passed the baccalauret is exactly equal to the number of openings in the university at the\nfollowing fall. So they consider me as a traitor to France for having dropped out of that. And I\u2019ve\noften thought what it would have been. I mean, there\u2019s no question in my mind if I\u2019d become a\nprofessor at the Ecole Superieure des Ponts et Chaussee, in relative terms that would be\nsomething higher than being a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. But the -- the odds of a\nforeigner getting that far in France, it\u2019s sort of near zero. So I -- I -- I don\u2019t -- never regretted it.",
        "A: Came to the United States.",
        "A: He was a -- well, he had a practice in -- in New York, he contacted Multiple Sclerosis, and\ndecided that the best way to heal himself is to heal others, and gave up his practice, moved to a\nveteran\u2019s hospital in Chicago as a -- as a physical therapist.",
        "A: Yeah. But he was not in a position to support us. He died -- yeah, I think I introduced Norma\nto him once, he met my wife-to-be once. There were some other friends of my parents, who were\nterrific. Took us over and sort of nurtured us and I got -- I was disin -- by that time I was\nabsolutely disenchanted with architecture but I decided I would study civil engineering. I started\nna --",
        "A: Yeah, there\u2019s a expectation of my parents, because of --",
        "A: -- of my uncle\u2019s prominence. But at Beaux Arts -- I -- I\u2019m still -- I\u2019m sure that if I\u2019d started at\na decent, modern architecture school I would have stayed. But in the Beaux Arts, the first year\nthere\u2019s only one subject, free hand sketching, nothing else. And I passed the mathematics option\nof the baccalaureate. I wanted to do some other things beside free hand sketching. So that was\nout. So a friend of -- our friend in Chicago suggested that I was not qualified to work as a\ndraftsman. I didn\u2019t know the English units, among other things, but at that time engineering\ndrawings still had to be traced in ink on -- on vellum. So I got a ma -- job as a -- as a tracer.\nEventfully they promoted me to draftsman, that\u2019s -- was fine. I started night school at IIT\n[indecipherable] technology in Chicago. And I had a path laid out and in seven and a half years I\nwould have my bachelor\u2019s degree.",
        "A: Working at night. Except that in January \u201952, 15 months after I came to the States, I got\ndrafted in the United States Army, because I came as a -- with my intention of becoming a\ncitizen, so I was qualified for the draft.",
        "A: No, but -- but my --",
        "A: The intent -- the green ca -- the -- the cert -- the certificate of intent, or whatever you sign,\nqualify --",
        "A: -- makes you subject to the draft, yes. Korea -- not to citizenship because the Korean war was\nnot a declared war, so peace time rules applied. And peace times rules are, after three years in the\ncontinental -- three years of service in the continental United States, you qualify for citizenship.\nWell, people were drafted for two years, not three, and they were sent overseas. That\u2019s why they\nwere drafted. And then, in Korea, the Chinese captured a few kids in my situation. At least one\nof them was -- was taken back to -- to Warsaw and paraded on the streets of Warsaw as a traitor.",
        "A: Yes. At which point congress passed the wartime regulations, after 180 days without --\nwithout a dishonorable discharge you qualify. And so everybody in Korea in one weekend -- a\nfederal judge was flown to Tokyo, all of these kids were pulled out and sworn in in one weekend.",
        "A: As citizens. In -- in the European sector we were just told that we qualify as soon as we get\nout. So anyhow, I had basic training, I had orders to Korea, blanket orders to Korea, which made\nme wonder what it will be like to have a weapon to shoot back. Last minute I was -- a few of us\nwere pulled out and sent to Europe -- sent to Germany as interpreters. So I arrived in\nBremerhaven, arrive in Stuttgart, intel -- intelligence battalion attached to the seventh army\nheadquarters, after four or five weeks of doing nothing, the executive officer calls me in and\nsays, \u201cSoldier, we can\u2019t get you clearance.\u201d Obviously they couldn\u2019t check in Yugoslavia\n[indecipherable]. Security status -- \u201cwithout a clearance, you -- we can\u2019t use you in this battalion.\nThe normal procedure under these circumstances is to send you back to infantry. You look a\nlittle bit more intelligent than that, what else can you do?\u201d And I -- I said, \u201cWell, sir, in attempt\nto be a civil engineer I also passed the draftsman test, not just the language test.\u201d He called\nacross seventh army headquarters, engineer section, oh yeah, they need draftsmen. And so for a\nyear and a half I was a --",
        "A: A draftsman. In a few weeks I got promoted and I was chief draftsman. So that was a very\ninteresting lesson because the first time I was responsible for other people\u2019s work, which was\ninteresting. Being stationed in Stuttgart was interesting. I met two or three -- two other guys that\nsim -- situation very similar to a -- to mine. One of the very inexpensive entertainments was the\nopera. One -- four marks, one dollar, running 10 months a year, and so you know, twice a week,\nthree times a week we would go to the opera. There were a lot of young German men and\nwomen working in various positions at army headquarters. I s-sort of became part of the group.\nMit -- at that time it was still an army of occupation, you couldn\u2019t wea -- wear civilian clothes. It\ndidn\u2019t matter, I -- I met this girl, I kept my clothes at her -- her house. I would change, we would\ngo out to dinner, and get changed and get back on the last bus at midnight going up to army\nheadquarters. If I was -- whenever I was challenged by the MPs in restaurants, I spoke better\nGerman -- better German than they did, I -- I was ne -- I was never caught. I never -- never --",
        "A: Yes, I had this -- there was a Hungarian laborer in the kitchen at the -- at the -- at the army\nheadquarters and he would lend me his -- his I.D. [indecipherable] car -- I.D. card and\n[indecipherable] MPs didn\u2019t faze me.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Right, right. So it was a very interesting experience because several of these kids wanted to\ntalk about what happened and what they -- what their parents role was, and what happened to\ntheir parents, and I was very much interested in what their parents role was, and what happened\nto their parents. So we had very long conversations with -- weekend long conversations.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: Absolutely, yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes, I was -- absolutely. Yup. Certainly that was a very -- intellectually very interesting part.\nThe other part is that with the leave I had -- and -- and money, I had opportunity to travel. One\nthing I forgot to mention about my childhood is that this room that was my mother\u2019s studio and\nour play space, on four walls, three rows of black and white reproductions of -- of artwork, most\n-- mostly renaissance, mostly classical, very few modern ones. I was raised with that. So over the\nyears, but certainly starting with the period, I must have seen all the originals by now. My sister\nand I couple times have started to make a list and we always stop, because the list gets aha --\nlonger, and longer, and longer of things we think should -- that should have been there, which\nweren\u2019t there. But, you know, going to Berlin, to the Dali museum to see the [indecipherable]\nwhich with the -- the owl [indecipherable], yup, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s part of my -- my traveling\nschedule anywh -- anywhere I go. So I got out of the army. I got early discharge so I could start\nat the University of Illinois. I started February 54, got my Bachelors in February \u201957. In the\nmeantime I met Norma, we got married. 50\u201c anniversary is coming up in three months.",
        "A: In Chicago. My sister and her sister-in-law met through a common friend and they had both\nhad children of the same age. Her sister-in-law was born in Vienna, sent on a kindertransport\nfirst to England, and from there to -- family went to Latin America before they came to the\nStates. And so we got married in \u201955.",
        "A: She\u2019s American. First son was born in \u201957. I was valedictorian of the *57 class.",

        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s -- I mean --",
        "A: -- that was the thing. I didn\u2019t think about s-staying in academia, but I -- I got it -- I had very\ngood record, I got a fellowship for the first year of graduate study, department [indecipherable]\noffered me a instructorship for the sec -- for the succeeding years. So in seven and a half years, I\nhad my Ph.D.. Never paid a penny for it, because I was on the G.I. bill, and then the Illinois\nVeterans scholarship [indecipherable] so I never had -- I never had to pay tuition. And so I -- I\nstayed in academia all my life. One -- one serious consideration for one -- to work in company in\nNew York, but other than that, I stayed in academia.",
        "A: Norma worked until Gregory was born in 57.",
        "A: And we were never as well off as when I -- I was a graduate student, and I had a -- the -- the\nsmall amount from G.I. bill, and the stipend. I mean, we never lived as well within our means as\nwe did then.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, I mean -- campus time -- you could go to concerts for a pittance, and -- and I\nmean, we had a -- a great life. So I became an instructor. I did be -- then things slowed down\nbecause I was working full time, I didn\u2019t get my Ph.D. til 61, when I was 30. But I was full\nprofessor by \u201965, in four years.",
        "A: And so I -- I had a very, very satisfactory career. I got into computing very early. Took my\nfirst -- my one and only programming course in \u201957. Machine language programming. But I\naffected personally -- had a great affect on how structural engineers earn their living by taking\npart of the dull hand tracking computations off their -- off their hands and putting -- and\nsubstituting computer programs for that. So I --",

        "A: Yeah, but not -- my colleagues were -- two of my good friends were on the -- working on the\nMessina Strait crossing, you know, I did -- never did anything like that. But -- but I dare to say\nthat very few structures built that have not been designed with the tools that I started.",

My -- my claim to fame was finished in\n\u00b063, have been downhill ever since.",

        "A: -- first in \u201972 we moved to Carnegie-Mellon. I went there as department head. I thought, you\nknow, no big deal. Year and a half later I had a horrible, totally debilitating nervous breakdown.\nI couldn\u2019t handle promotion cases, tenure cases, lab technician firing cases. A psych -- psych -- a\npsychic-cologist -- psychiatrist and -- kept me on pills, which made me function okay, but he\ndidn\u2019t help, he was a pure Freudian. He said, \u201cHow old were you?\u201d I said 13. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s\nimpossible that something that old -- at that age could have ever affected you.\u201d So one day it\nbecame so severe that Norma didn\u2019t trust me to go by myself and she came with me to -- to the\nshrink. The way -- the reason I connected with him because I went to th -- asked the rabbi and\nthe rabbi recommended him, the guy\u2019s practice was marital conflict, and s -- 1 -- many times I\nwould say something, what does Norma think? She\u2019s -- the same thing that I do, sh -- sh -- call\nNorma and -- and were always surprised that she said the same thing I did. We walk in, we\nbarely sat down, he turns to her and says, \u201cNorma, what do you think is wrong with Steve?\u201d And\nNorma, clear out, says, \u201cSteve can\u2019t be responsible for the life and death of people.\u201d And so by\nthe time he explained to her that these were n -- not really life and death decisions, yeah, I was --\nI was done. Next -- next day I went to see the dean and resign my position. And both -- the dean\nsaid, \u201cIll let you resign if you promise to stay and to see the vice-president.\u201d He said, \u201c\u201cWhat do -\n- what are you going to do?\u201d \u201cWell, Ill go on back to te -- to what I know how to do, teaching\nand research.\u201d He said, \u201cThat\u2019s not good enough. We come to depend on you, and on your\nopinions. If you can\u2019t provide that, then there\u2019s no point your staying here.\u201d And so from -- from\n74 til -- til \u00b099, that\u2019s how I functioned at Carnegie Mellon.",

        "A: No.",

In very important cases the department head asked me to -- would ask\nme to represent the department, but the rules of the game were understood. If I started feeling\nqueasy, no question asked, I was off and somebody else was in my place. And that has worked.\nOccasionally -- sometimes I could go through, sometimes I could not. There\u2019s no point in\nspeculating which one -- which was which.",
        "A: But yeah, my symptoms went away.",

        "A: Right.",
        "A: But I -- I always felt that -- that she was a civilizing influence on the other three. That they --\nthey were quite wild, and -- but then when she came around they were vying for the privilege of\nbabysitting her, etcetera. Some -- so the kids, we were proud of them. I must say I was not the\nbest prepared parent during their teenage years. I couldn\u2019t quite emphasize with their concerns\nand their worries. But certainly after they left home and went through college, we\u2019ve had a\nmarvelous adult interaction with all of them, a relationship with all of them. Gregory went into\ncivil engineering. He\u2019s department chair at University of California, Berkeley. Carol went -- got\na Master\u2019s in public administration from Columbia. And from her student days on she has\nworked for the city of New York. She now works for the Department of Environmental\nResources, and we joke that she\u2019s a more serious civil engineer than either Greg or I, because she\nmanages about a billion dollars worth of construction money a year, for the sewers and s -- and\nwater se -- tre -- tre -- water supply and sewerage for New York City. Peter went off to get a\ndegree in -- in physics and math at Wesleyan, came out with a degree in English and classics.\nWent to Hopkins in their Center for the Humanities. And now has four appointments at\nNorthwestern. German, comparative literature, philosophy and social sciences, I believe.",

He was a early\nfollower of derridar and he specializes in German and Jewish philosophers and -- and writers.\nLaura has a Master\u2019s in -- Master\u2019s degree in higher education administration. She works -- she\u2019s\nhuman re -- HR director for a -- for a software firm in Silver Spring. They\u2019re all married. Four --\nfour marriages under chuppah, which we are very proud of.

Carol,\nbetween her Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s spent a year in -- and they -- they have two -- two\ndaughters, Hannah and Emily.

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. As I was going through -- yeah, I barely talked about it. The k-kids barely knew it,\noutlines normally, a little bit more, but barely outlines. In this depression control process in -- in\nthe early -- in early 70\u2019s, I was chair of the adult education committee at our local temple. People\nwanted a course on the Holocaust, and this lady came to give some -- some talks about the\nHolocaust and then she had to be absent for one of the lectures. And I suspected the connection, I\nknew the connection right away, I couldn\u2019t verbalize it. I volunteered to substitute for her. I\nthought that 1t might be beneficial. Norma sat in the audience, cringing and hiding behind the\nback of a large man, and that\u2019s when she heard the story from beginning to end.",
        "A: Not as a full story. A week later the rabbi called, he heard about my talk, would I repeat it to\nthe temple youth group? And I said sure, and that\u2019s when Gregory, Carol and Peter heard it the\nfirst time. Not to them, but to the youth group. And then six, seven years later, Carol was taking\na Holocaust course at the University of Michigan and her teacher invited me to come and give a\nguest lecture, and so Laura came along for the drive, just on a weekend outing with her sister,\nand she sat in the classroom.",
        "A: And heard it for first time. It\u2019s largely that I didn\u2019t want to burden them, and it\u2019s largely that\nNorma wanted to shield me and shield the children. More shielding me than shielding the\nchildren.",

        "A: Not -- not necessarily. But, there\u2019s a closeness. And the kids are always available when --\nwhen I need it. In \u201994, there was this 60\u2122 anniversary commemoration in Subotica, very poorly\nadvertised, because they didn\u2019t know whether the government would allow it, this was height of\nMilosevic. My sister and I decided that we had to go. The women in the family were against it, it\nwas the fighting in -- in Bosnia. What if this is on CNN? What image will it project. So I decided\nI had to go. It turned out that Peter had a -- had a philosophy conference in Holland the following\nweek, so he came along for that. \u201995 I was asked to give the keynote address at the International\nConference on Computing and Civil Engineering in Berlin. The family again worried about my\ngoing, decided to delegate Greg to come with me, which was very useful. I mean, you know, he\nknew some of the people, they were short of a chair for one the sessions, so he sat -- he was a\nchair for the session. We went two days early and we drove down to Niederorschel and\nBuchenwald. And that -- that was very -- very satisfying. The night before Gregory wanted --\ntreated me to a nice dinner and at the dinner he said, \u201cDad, what is it that we are going to look\nfor?\u201d And I took a napkin and I drew a map of the pla -- of the camp. And the next noon we were\nthere, and except that somehow I tried to visualize the orientation with respect to the sun, I was\noff 180 degrees orientation, but other than that, that -- that was -- that -- the plan.

        "A: These are the employees of the printing plant, Minerva in Subotica, with my father and my\nuncle sitting in front. The -- my uncle was the edit -- was the owner and editor, my father was the\nmanager. And behind it is the -- the plant where the -- the printing presses were.",
        "A: This is the editorial staff, again my uncle in the middle in front, and my father next to him.\nSeveral of these people became quite prominent journalists. Some of them on -- under Fascist\nHungary, a number of them in post-war Hungary. Not shown in this picture are several people\nwho had worked for my father who later came to the States. When I came to the States there was\nstill a Hungarian daily paper in New York, Detroit and Toronto, and a Hungarian literary journal\nin New York, all four of the editors had worked for my father.",
        "A: Something like that.",
        "A: Well this is my family at the local resort outside Subotica. I\u2019m sitting on my mother\u2019s lap and\nmy sister is in front of my father with two of my mother\u2019s friends in -- in the group.",
        "A: \u00b033.",
        "A: This is my grade school, I think it must be second grade class picture. I sit next to the teacher\nand my best friend sits on the other side of the teacher an -- we were sort of the leaders of the\nboys and the two girls nex -- sitting next to me were the unquestioned leaders of the girls. The\nsecond one, in the dark dress, lives in Israel. We visit her every time we go to Israel. We once\ncoun -- counted heads. I -- I believe four people in that -- in that picture survived the Holocaust.",
        "A: This must be s -- well, no question, this is summer of th -- of 1940, one year before the\noccupation. My parents and my sister and I looking at -- I don\u2019t remember any more whether it\u2019s\na chicken coop or -- or a rabbit hutch. My father bought this fo -- small vineyard, and he tried to\n-- to grow wine and -- and make schnapps out of the -- the fruit, but 1t wasn\u2019t very successful.",
        "A: My -- th -- my sister and I. She\u2019s wearing the uniform of second year of the academic high\nschool, gymnasium, so this must be \u201940 - \u201941 academic year.",
        "A: In Yugoslavia. I obviously didn\u2019t know how to tie a tie.",
        "A: That\u2019s my sister and I in Paris, \u201947 - \u201948 - \u201949, I can\u2019t tell, but that\u2019s after we -- we got out of\nYugoslavia and -- and lived in Paris. In fact, it must be close to \u201947, because I remember that\u2019s\nthe suit in which I traveled.",
        "A: This is the -- a photocopy of the Buchenwald index card. On the left I\u2019m listed as a Slovakian\nJewish political prisoner, because I was -- I was pushed into a Slovakian transport. Why political\nI don\u2019t know. And my birth date I obviously intended to give 16\" -- April 16, 1929, somehow it -\n- two of the numbers got mangled, but clearly I -- I was use -- always using my sister\u2019s birth date\nwhen I -- whenever I needed a birth date in Buchenwald and throughout the concentration camp.",
        "A: This is my provisional identification card, issued by the American army, after the liberation in\nBuchenwald. I still use Josef -- Josef for my name, but I think I went back to June six, 1931 as\nmy birth date. And I never -- I didn\u2019t make the comparison. I see the Buchenwald number is on\nit, which I -- I -- I didn\u2019t know I had a Buchenwald number until this -- this past fall.",
        "A: This 1s an artist\u2019s rendering of the synagogue in Subotica, the Reform synagogues, completed\nin 1902, designed by my mother\u2019s uncle, a very well known architect of the Hungarian art\nnoveau movement. The temple now is in very bad condition. We are trying to find a way to have\nit restored. The -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s on the -- on the UNESCO register of threatened historical\nmonuments, it\u2019s on the list of Jewish threatened historical monuments, but I -- I don\u2019t know\nwhether we\u2019ll be able to save it.",
        "A: This is a copy of my father\u2019s newspaper. I guess the date is -- is 1933, December 22\u2122. So at\nthat time my uncle was still living, and so my uncle was still the editor. 36 pages, one dinar. And\nthe headlines are, \u201cThe King -- King\u2019s Visit to Zargrev. A rapprochement Between -- Friendship\nTreaty Between France and Germany Proposed by the French par -- Perfume King, and A Strike\nof the Postal Workers in Greece.\u201d In case you needed to know what the news were in 1933.",
        "A: This is my mother. The date is 1918, so she probably was an art student in Budapest. I\u2019m told\nthat the sketch was done by one of her classmates, whose signature appears below, Fusti Molnar\nKatalina. But I\u2019ve tried pouring over Hungarian art -- artistic -- artist\u2019s directories and artist\u2019\ndictionaries and I have never located that name. So I -- I don\u2019t know who the artist was. But this\n-- this has always hung in our house. This -- this is one of the -- the things that were in the folder\nthat our -- our cook saved for us.",
        "A: My mother traveled extensively, 1924 - \u201925 - \u201926 in Austria, France and Italy, and this is one\nof the etchings she made in Florence. I don\u2019t -- for li -- for lithographs I -- I know that she did\npencil drawings first and did the etchings at -- at home. I -- I -- and did the lithographs at home. I\ndon\u2019t know whether she did the same thing for the etchings, but I presume she did, that she\ndidn\u2019t have all of her -- her copper, and -- and acid and everything else that goes into etching\nwith her. So this is n -- nice view of the -- of Florence that I\u2019ve always liked.",
        "A: This is one of her lithographs, it\u2019s also Florence. Think a little bit more Impressionistic than\nthe etching. The -- my father\u2019s printing plant had a large, flat -- flatbed press with a large stone\nnormally used for making maps, and I\u2019m sure that that\u2019s what my mother used to -- to pull the\nlithographs.",
        "A: This is my family at my granddaughter\u2019s Bat Mitzvah, two years a -- three years ago. My wife\nand I in front and our four children, Gregory, Peter, Carol and Laura and their spouses, and my\nson-in-law Ithzak\u2019s family in the back row. And the grandchildren, six grandchildren, including\nthe one on the side, that -- that\u2019s in bo -- that 1s in Chicago, and the other boy 1s here in Silver\nSpring and we have mo -- much more actively than any of the others, we have been involved in\nhis -- in his growth, which has been very satisfying.\nEnd of Tape Nine\nConclusion of Interview\n"
