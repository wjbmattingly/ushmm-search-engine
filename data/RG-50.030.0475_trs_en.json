        "Question: -- States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. This is an\ninterview with Paulette Nehama, conducted by Margaret West, on June the 24\", 2003, in\nBethesda, Maryland. This interview is part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\u2019s\npost Holocaust interview project. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully\nacknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape number one,\nside A.",
        "Answer: My name is Paulette Moudzoukos Nehama. I was born in Volos, Greece, on September\n12, 1933.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk first about your family. So, tell me first about your parents.",
        "A: My parents was -- my father was Anselmos Moudzoukos, and he was born in Volos. And my\nmother was Thalia, Levi was her maiden name, Moudzoukos, and she was also born in Volos.\nMy parents were first cousins, which makes the whole family thing very interesting. They got\nmarried in 1921, and they had two children, my sister, who was born in 1923, and myself 10\nyears later, who was born in 1933, as I said.",
        "Q: How unusual would it be for cousins to marry first cousins?",
        "A: I haven\u2019t heard of anybody else, but it\u2019s certainly something permitted in the Jewish religion.\nThis was the first time I heard of first cousins getting married.",
        "Q: And did your parents come from some other region, or had they -- did they come from\nfamilies settled in Volos?",
        "A: Well, their -- their parents were from Halkeela, which is in Emvia. When exactly did they\ncome to Volos, I\u2019m not sure, but they -- all their children were born in Volos.",
        "Q: And were they Sephardic Jews?",
        "A: No, they were Romaniot, which means they were Jews from very, very old time, who settled\nin Greece. They didn\u2019t come from Spain.",
        "Q: And tell me about what you know of their -- they -- they obviously knew each other all their\nlives.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: But what you know of their -- of their marriage, how old were they, how they settled. I mean,\nwhere they first lived, and so on.",
        "A: They got married when -- when mother was 22, and my father was 23. They settled in Volos,\nso that\u2019s where they lived all their lives. They had a small house. They were very close to the\nfamily, and those there 1s still in Greece. Families have houses very close to each other,\nsometimes a three level home, and each family has one level. So they -- they lived there. My\ngrandparents had built a factory, and this was a textile factory. It was finished in 1906, and about\n1920, I think the factory, the grandparents retired, and my father and his brother took over the\nfactory in Volos, which was called Leviathan Moudzoukos, and company.",
        "Q: Now, were there other similar companies in Volos?",
        "A: There were three other factories in Volos. One was also a textile factory, and one was a\nhardware thing. My father\u2019s factory was by -- there was the largest. It had -- it produced material,\nthey called it cashmere, which was material for men\u2019s suits, and women\u2019s clothes -- means\nwomen\u2019s suits. And they imported the yarn from England. And it was nationally known, and\ninternationally known.",
        "Q: Now that could not have happened were it not for Volos being a port.",
        "A: That is true, yes.",
        "Q: Now I had assumed that it would be a factory, I knew it was a textile factory, assuming that it\nwas using yarns from the plain of Thessaly, but really relied on imported good.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did the other factory -- textile factory use imported basic materials?",
        "A: \u2019'm not sure.",
        "Q: And was there competition between the two?",
        "A: Yes, but I think my father\u2019s factory was much, much higher both in production, and in\nexports.",
        "Q: How many people would be employed in the factory?",
        "A: Between 900 and 1200. And they were running three shifts, the factory never stopped. And\nthe legend has it that there is a big chimney, which is every morning at five o\u2019clock he would go\noff to wake up the workers, to come to work. This was nice alarm clock.",
        "Q: Oh, a --",
        "A: So the whole wallas knew, and it\u2019s said that the chim -- the Moudzoukos chimney 1-is ringing,\nmust be five o\u2019clock.",
        "Q: Yeah. So it would be a -- a chime from a tower?",
        "A: No, it was like a big, huge -- like a chimney -- huge, and it will go on, like woo, woo, woo.",
        "Q: Well, does that mean that your name would be -- your family name, Moudzoukos would be\nwidely known in that region, or in Greece generally?",
        "A: In that region, definitely, and in Greece. Not all over Greece, but it\u2019s well known.",
        "Q: What about the tailors that would make up the -- I mean, we-were you manufacturing the fab\n-- the cashmere, but also tailoring it?",
        "A: No. No, the tailoring was done elsewhere. People will buy yards of material, and will have\nother seamstress, or a tailor, who would make suits.",
        "Q: And does the company continue?",
        "A: No. Unfortunately, there\u2019ve been many mishaps after the war. First of all production stopped\nbecause we couldn\u2019t get the material from England. There were no -- there was no way to do\nthat. Then we had to go into hiding, and the factory closed because also the Germans took over.\nAnd they destroyed some of the machinery, and some of it became barracks for the troops. So\nthere was no way the factory could operate. After the war it was in very bad shape, and there was\nno money to start it over, but somehow the bank gave us a loan, and we started, but with half or a\nquarter of the people, and the production was very limited. So it was kind of limping for a war --\na while. Then, for several years it was a real, real struggle to -- to make it go. Material was\ndifficult to get, and general the economic conditions were too bad. So finally the bank\nrepossessed it, and that was the end of that factory. It became a warehouse for grain for the\nwhole region, and now they have made it into technical schools. There\u2019s a gimna -- gimnasium,\nwhich is like a high school, and also technical schools for the rich. But the interesting thing 1s,\nthey kept the facade, which was in -- 1t was, I mean architecturally it was a very -- it was the\nthing of the time. The roof was kind of slanted, and that they kept, but they also kept the name,\nand they call it Moudzoukos Technical Schools. There\u2019s also a bus stop called Moudzoukos stop.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to the beginning, we jumped -- we jumped ahead to follow the history of the\ncompany, but --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- let\u2019s go back to your parents time of their marriage, and then your sister\u2019s birth.",
        "A: Okay, my father was working with his father in the factory. My mother was a homemaker,\nand a socialite. Her role was to have teas for the ladies, she did a tremendous amount of\nvolunteer work in Volos. She worked in the orphanage, and another kind of -- of -- what call this,\nand I always remember that she had teas in the house, and all these ladies will come, and there\nwere beautiful things like cakes and cookies, and that we have to dress up, and come and say\nhello to the ladies, and curtsy, which I didn\u2019t like. And so she was a busy lady.",
        "Q: Y-You mentioned -- you sa -- you said socialite, but in fact she was involved in lots of good\nworks.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: So there was --",
        "A: Yes, it was a social life that she had, very social. And that was expected more or less of the\nwomen of her stature, because we were quite wealthy. We had a maid, and a cook, and we had sa\n-- | had a nanny, and later a governess. So -- but my mother always supervised them, everything\nwas absolutely perfect.",
        "Q: Would she be -- when -- when you were a child, would she be fairly constantly in the home,\nor part of your life?",
        "A: She was there most of the time, yes. When I would come home, I would go with my nanny to\nthe park, or swim in the summertime, but she was home at lunchtime. And when I would to go\nbed, she would be there. My parents took trips to Austria. They often traveled to Switzerland and\nAustria. So there were extended periods of time that they were not there. But my grandmother\nwas there, and of course, the household staff, and my sister, who was older, and I was relying on\nher.",
        "Q: Well, both sets of grandparents would be close by, is that right?",
        "A: Well, I never met my father\u2019s mother, she died before I was born, but my mother\u2019s mother\nlived with us.",
        "Q: So it really was a home with a great deal of stability and so on.",
        "A: Oh yeah, there was plenty of stability, absolutely.",
        "Q: Now, what do you remember of your early childhood, and of your relationship with your\nolder sister?",
        "A: Well, my older sister was like a mother to me, because she always took the role of discipline\nme. And I always wanted to be where she was. If she had friends over, I wanted to be in that\ngroup. And she didn\u2019t want me to be there. Her friends were marvelous, they would ask me to\ncome and stay, and talk to them, but she didn\u2019t want me in there. She -- she was caring, very\ncaring for me. But she was an older person to me at the time. You know, she was 21, I was 10, so\nthat makes a big difference.",
        "Q: What -- who were the people that you were named after, you and your sister?",
        "A: My Hebrew name is Esther, which is my maternal grandmother\u2019s name. My maternal\u2019s --\nyeah, grandmother\u2019s name. The name Paulette, I think, comes from Paulette Goddard, my\nmother loved her. She is the actress, and she just adored that woman. So I think that\u2019s why she\nnamed me Paulette.",
        "Q: And would you be known by Paulette all your life?",
        "A: I was -- my name was Pauletta in Greek. Sometimes they would call me Paulettiki, which\nmeans little Paulette, and sometimes they still do, when I go to Greece. They call me Paulettik:.\nBut mostly Paulette.",
        "Q: And your sister\u2019s full name, and where that would come from.",
        "A: My sister\u2019s name is Yolanda, and we call her Yola. Her Hebrew name -- I mean, she 1s named\nafter my paternal grandmother, her name was Santhi. Well, the English translation will be\nblondie, which is kind of funny. But -- but she was called Yola.",
        "Q: And naming you after grandparents, was that a -- a tradition --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- among Romaniots?",
        "A: Right, it\u2019s a tradition. And you name children even when the grandparents are not dead. In the\nAshkenazis you don\u2019t do that. In the Sephardic and Romaniots tradition, you can name children\nafter living grandparents, or living uncles or aunts, yeah.",
        "Q: Now tell me of what you remember of the -- of your earliest childhood.",
        "A: Well, I remember it was wonderful. I -- I loved the house we lived, we had a beautiful house,\nand a wonderful garden that smelled wonderful because we had such nice trees, like lemon trees\nand orange trees and beautiful roses. So it was always very pleasant to be outside, and be there. I\nhad friends, lots of other children. My governess, who spoke French, and I had to speak French\nwith her, would take me to the park, and there would be other children there, and we would play\nall sorts of things. In the summer I would go swimming every day. We would take little train\nfrom Volos, which would go up to the mountain of Pilion, but it would stop at the beach called\nAnaboros, and we would get off. There were -- the wagons were regular wagons [indecipherable |\nthere were two of them that were opened, so it was like a coach, and that\u2019s where I sat. And I\nloved it, because I could se -- see, and I could see everything.",
        "Q: And would you be swimming in the sea?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, it was gorgeous. I never wanted to get out.",
        "Q: And you mentioned your governess speaking French with you, but what languages -- what\nwould be your mother tongue, and what languages did you -- do you know?",
        "A: Greek was what we spoke at home, but also we spoke French, because my mother has been\neducated in Switzerland, in Lausanne, and she wanted us to learn French. So we spoke French at\nhome with my mother, and with the governess. So at the age of five I was very fluent in French.\nThese were the only two languages I spoke. Of course, now I know English.",
        "Q: Would your mother\u2019s education in Lausanne be the reason that your parents would go to\nSwitzerland and Austria on vacations and on trips?",
        "A: I think there was business going there, one of the reasons they went. They had business with\nI\u2019m -- I\u2019m not sure with whom, but there wa -- they were business trips combined with -- with\npleasure.",
        "Q: What do you remember of your family\u2019s religious practices? Did you go regularly to the\nsynagogue, was it -- did you keep kosher in your home?",
        "A: No, we did not keep kosher. I don\u2019t think we ate pork, but otherwise we ate everything. I went\nto the synagogue with my mother on special occasions to take oil to the synagogue. This was a\npractice that is a good deed. You would take oil to the synagogue for the lamps, because there\nwere no candles. And I would go with my mother. But I did not go to services. My father would\ngo.",
        "Q: Wo -- would your mother go also? Was it just the children who would not go, or would --\nwould it be only your father?",
        "A: My mother would go to the high holidays with my father.",
        "Q: And then would you have special observances of the holidays in your home?",
        "A: I remember Passover. But we also celebrated Greek Easter, as well. We were always invited\nto someplace where they were roasting a ham, which is a very traditional kind of thing for Greek\nEaster. So we were very much part of the whole community.",
        "Q: Do you remember in these -- I know that you were really a very young child then, but what\nare your earliest memories of whether you felt you were primarily Greek, or Jewish?",
        "A: I think I felt Greek all along. I started feeling Jewish when I joined the Brownies, and ma -- I\nmust have been like six years old, probably, or maybe younger. And the meetings were on\nSaturday, and I remember my grandmother said, \u201cThat\u2019s bad. You don\u2019t go to meetings on\nSaturdays, because you are Jewish.\u201d But I insisted, and my mother didn\u2019t think it was terrible, so\nI did go. But when we were asked to bring a needle and a thread, because we had to learn how to\nsew a button, and I actually had forgotten to bring it, and the -- the leader said to me, \u201cWhere is\nyour thread and button?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t sew on Saturdays.\u201d So I claimed my Jewishness,\nand of course, she couldn\u2019t say anything.",
        "Q: Yeah. Would there be other Brownies who were also Jewish?",
        "A: No, I was the only one.",
        "Q: And do you remember whether your early childhood friends would be -- would be Jewish\nfriends, or would there be a real mixture?",
        "A: Actually, they -- I don\u2019t remember any other Jewish friend. No, maybe one, I remember one.\nIt was mostly Greek Orthodox.",
        "Q: So your life was thoroughly integrated into the society?",
        "A: Absolutely, yes. My father was also president of the Jewish community, so -- I mean, we did\nhave very strong Jewish component in the family, we just not very religious, let\u2019s put it this way.",
        "Q: And the employees in the Moudzoukos family, they would cover the local spectrum, they\nwouldn\u2019t be more Jews employed than -- than the Greek Orthodox?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. Yeah. A lot of them were immigrants from Asia man -- minor. They had\nemigrated in Volos, in fact my father was instrumental in building homes for them. And he\nemployed a lot of these people in the factory.",
        "Q: What countries would they have come from?",
        "A: Asia minor, Turkey.",
        "Q: Turkey?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And they would have moved west for economic reasons? For je -- to improve their -- their\nlives?",
        "A: Well, yeah, I\u2019m sure they moved west, but also I think their -- their lives were threatened, so\nthat\u2019s why they left.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I -- I -- I was just wanting you to fill me in on what was happening historically that\nwould have meant they moved to Greece.",
        "A: Well, I think Yamala the Turk came, and of course, a lot of people had to -- to leave the area.\nAlthough he did make many changes in the region, but one of the changes was that he has --\nforeigners had to -- to leave. And there was a massacre also, at the time. So people hoo -- ran for\ntheir lives.",
        "Q: Your home life really would have been, I\u2019m guessing, very comfortable, if not lavish in these\n-- in the years of your early childhood.",
        "A: That is right. It was very comfortable, it was very steady and predictable. And it was lavish.\nMy parents would give big parties, there was -- there were always a lot of people around. They\nwere very well known, and it was like, you know, a constant stream of people coming through\nour house, or going places. I was a child, and of course, children were not to mingle with adults,\nso I didn\u2019t participate in all these kind of things, but I remember the excitement. What I\nremember was that my parents bought a summer home tn -- in Calanilla, which 1s part of the\nPilion mountain, but it\u2019s down by the sea. And we would go there for weekends, and I remember\nthat we packed the food in big baskets, and then went -- we would get on the train, and then the -\n- the man who was taking care of the estate would come on his buggy and horse, and pick us up\nfrom the train station, and take us back to the -- we used to call it villa, to the villa. And that was\none of my favorite times. I just loved it there.",
        "Q: And you -- you\u2019d go there through the summer months, an -- and for how long? You\u2019d stay\non a Saturday night?",
        "A: Yes. In -- in the summer we stayed for a month, or two, or maybe more. Maybe we went in\nthe winter, I don\u2019t remember, but it was short period of time.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Now, you mentioned that you would not go to the synagogue except to take oil. Would your\nsister, who was older than you have had a Bat Mitzvah, or any kind of formal training in her\nJewish faith?",
        "A: No. First of all, girls were not Bat Mitzvahed until much, much, much later in Greece, so this\nwas unheard of. So there was no particular training, there was no Sunday school as we call it, or\nHebrew school. The training was at home, basically.",
        "Q: And what would that training be, and who would it come from? You mentioned your -- your\ngrandmother before, complaining of you going to Brownies on Saturday. But would she be the --\nthe person who would sort of teach you what you knew about the Jewish faith?",
        "A: Well, it was -- I think a combination of things with my grandmother, it was my parents. But I\nremember my grandmother was quite s -- had very strong opinions about things, and she would\nalways say that you know, this is not Jewish, this is not the Jewish way. But she had no formal\neducation either. Actually, she went up to fourth or fifth grade, and -- but she had a very strong\nfeeling of who she was.",
        "Q: But that would be normal at the time, I suppose, even for privileged women, not to have a\ngreat deal of education, is that nght?",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s true, but she was also a sickly child, so -- in her younger years. She -- I guess if\nyou were sick you didn\u2019t go to school, it was as simple as that. So that was it. Her mother died\nwhen she was very young, she was like three or four, and she was raised by her brothers, and her\nsister, who was my other grandmother, and a bit spoiled.",
        "Q: She might have been a great reader, and have educated herself, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Ah --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nPaulette Nehama. This is tape number one, side B. We\u2019 ll continue talking about your\ngrandmother. I assume that you had a very close and loving relationship with her.",
        "A: She used to say I was her favorite grandchild, of course she had three. But I wasn\u2019t very\nhappy with her, because she always mingled a lot in my life. And I slept in the same room she\ndid, we had one room, and we shared it, and of course I wanted to have all my toys out, and\nevery night I had to put them back. And this will interfere with the story I had in my mind. I\nwould take my dolls and everything else, and set them outside -- and there was a story\n[indecipherable] I had imagined. And she would make me put them back, and I didn\u2019t like that.",
        "Q: Now ya -- and your sister did not have to share a room.",
        "A: No. She had all the privileges of the firstborn.",
        "Q: \u2019'm wondering if any -- if you have any special -- you must -- memories of these early years.\nYou mentioned it as a very happy time, but are there particular things that evoke wonderful\nmemories, and I\u2019m thinking of foods, or smells, people, pieces of music.",
        "A: Yes. Food was a very important part of our lives, and there was -- there were season things, I\nremember. You could not go to the grocery store and buy tomatoes in the wintertime. First of all,\nyou -- you had to go to the grocery store, or to the produce store and buy things, so there were\nseveral stops to buy all these things. What I remember, we had women who worked in that\nhousehold from the mountain of Pilion. And their parents will come to visit, and they would\nbring these wonderful baskets of cherries, or fresh strawberries, or figs. And they smelled so\ngood, they were just wonderful, and I always loved it when they came to visit with their\ndaughters, and they would bring all these fresh fruit.",
        "Q: Can you get the same quality of fruit from the same mountains today?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know. Probably yes, but I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t been there for a long time, so I\ncan\u2019t -- but I also remember the -- the way they came, they came in little white baskets, or\nbamboo baskets. And they were covered with fig leaves, so the fruit will stay moist. And it was\nvery, very attractive to look at this.",
        "Q: And you\u2019d have special foods for high holidays, but I suppose there\u2019d be other Greek\nholidays you\u2019d also celebrate.",
        "A: Yeah, I think -- I don\u2019t remember particularly celebrating Christmas, but it was like a\ngathering, like a family gathering, all people will come, and we\u2019ll have a nice meal. I don\u2019t know\nwhether we had turkey, I don\u2019t remember that. New Year\u2019s Eve, or New Year\u2019s Day was always\nspecial. It still is in Greece. You exchange presents on New Year\u2019s Day, so that was fun. Easter\nwas one thing. Tha -- that was basically -- yeah, there were special foods. There was always\nsome wonderful kind of desserts, and other things that my mother -- my mother was an excellent\ncook. I mean, she was terrific, and I loved everything she ate -- everything she made, I mean.\nWhat I remember also, there was a hierarchy, you know, in my house, so when we sat around the\ntable, the food was passed by the maids, first to my grandmother, then to my mother, then to my\nfather, then to my sister, and I was always the last one to be served. So I remember I always\nliked chicken livers, so -- you know, there was -- the chicken liver was gone, or -- by then. Or I\nwanted something -- I always wanted something that I didn\u2019t have, because I was the youngest. I\nate more slowly, so sometimes, you know, the table would be cleared, and I would still be eating.\nThings like that. So I had a very s -- a very good sense that I was the youngest, and I had to\ncompete with everybody.",
        "Q: Would there have been, though, responsibilities that fell on your older sister, that you were\nperhaps freed from?",
        "A: Well, she -- she was, I guess, older, and they were expecting more from her, you know. They\ndidn\u2019t expect much from me, other than to be a very polite, very well-behaved child.",
        "Q: Yeah. Now, what about school? How old would be -- you be when you started attending any\nkind of school?",
        "A: I was six years old, and I went straight to first grade. There were no pre-schools those days.\nAnd loo -- when I went to first grade, a month later the Italian war broke out. And school was\ndismissed for awhile. The male teachers were all gone to war, and from then on it\u2019s a whole\ndifferent story, because we had to leave Volos. Our house was taken by the navy, because it was\njust facing the sea, just about a block from the sea, and it was a good observation point. So we\nhad to leave, pack our things within 24 hours, we had just finished arranging the whole -- whole\nhousehold, we had just moved to this apartment. And I still remember the wax, and the clean and\nshiny place. And we had to leave, and put our things in storage, because the Italians were\ncoming.",
        "Q: And how -- how old exactly were you then?",
        "A: I was six years old.",
        "Q: Do you have memories of your parents attitudes or moods at the time? Did you -- I mean,\nthey would probably shield you from some concerns, but do you have any memories that suggest\nthe wonderfully happy times were over?",
        "A: Yes, they did shield me, they were very protective of me. I was very anxious about this war. I\nremember when I went in school the day the war -- we heard the -- about the war, all the children\n-- the older children anyway, were telling us that people get killed in the war, that men leave\ntheir homes, and go to battle, they get injured. And I was very worried about my father. So when\nthe principal told us that there would be no school that day, and they didn\u2019t know if there was\ngoing to be school the next day, I ran home crying, asking my mother if my father was going to\nbe the -- in the war, if he was going to be in the army. Well, my father was 40 -- 42 I think then.\nSo my mother calmed me down and reassures me that this wasn\u2019t going to happen, and that I\ndidn\u2019t have anything to worry about, we\u2019ll all be together, we\u2019ll be fine. There may be a war, but\nwe'll be safe. And that was something that I remember very vividly.",
        "Q: And what -- what month and year was that?",
        "A: That was in October of \u201940, 1940. School had started September, 1940, so it was almost a\nmonth later.",
        "Q: And what happened in the next years?",
        "A: The next years -- I remember we -- we stayed -- we moved to Agria, which is a suburb, or it\u2019s\none little village by the sea, not far from Volos. It\u2019s one of the first villages of the Pilion\nmountain, but it\u2019s down very low, by the sea. We moved there. It was also my grandmother, my\naunt, who had come from Salonika with her sons, and her husband. So, it was all of us. Now\nthat\u2019s --",
        "Q: Now, this would be your --",
        "A: My --",
        "Q: -- oh, the aunt?",
        "A: My sisters -- my mother\u2019s sister. Her son Raymond was 11 months older than me, so he was a\ngood companion, great. I made him played with dolls. He -- he was very accommodating. He\nwas a great guy. So anyway, so we moved to Agria, we rented a place, and we stayed there for, I\ndon\u2019t know, the whole summer. Then we returned to Volos, but shortly after, they started\nbombarding Volos, being a port, this was a prime target. And I remember the bombs falling, and\nhaving to run into the shelter. I was quite scared at time. Then we would come out of the shelter,\nand we will see all sorts of disasters.",
        "Q: Who was doing the bombing, and tell me then about the s -- the shelters.",
        "A: Okay, the -- the bombing was by the British. The shelter was at the basement of the building,\nand I have a feeling if the building collapsed, you know, we wouldn\u2019t be that safe there, but\neverybody thought they were. So everybody who lived in that apartment building would go\nthere, and also people from the outside, if they happened to hear the siren, that people had to go\nhiding, and they would come, although they didn\u2019t live there. And would stay as long as -- as\nlong as we heard the siren again, which meant that the danger is over, and out you go. Inspect the\ndamage.",
        "Q: Yeah. So y-you would go and take food and bedding with you? What do you remember, or\nwould you go there so fast that you would simply head there with your family as fast as you\ncould?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember taking nothing. Maybe a blanket, possibly. You had to run fast, there was\nnothing to take, because these things don\u2019t last a tremendous amount of time, as far as I\nremember. I think maybe an hour, maybe two. So that was it.",
        "Q: Let me go back to the -- to place what was happening in the context of the second World War.\nWhy would the British have been bombing the port of Volos, the third largest port?",
        "A: Well, I think it was -- 1t was a protection from -- from -- na --",
        "Q: So at this time your life was beginning to change. And then what happened?",
        "A: Well then, it was a worry. There were curfews. There were precautions taken, you could not\nhave lights at night. We had to put panels with black -- dark paper -- with black paper at the\nwindows so no light would fall through. You couldn\u2019t go out past six o\u2019clock or seven o\u2019clock.\nSo things started changing, people were more anxious. When the Italians came, I was fully aware\nthat they were the enemy, and although they were not particularly terrible to Jews, they were still\nan occupying force, and I was very patriotic, those days. But I also remem -- remember, that was\nin \u00b041, when there was a famine, and I remember it very clear. We did not particularly suffer\nfrom lack of food, although we didn\u2019t have the kind of food we used to have before the war. But\nwhen we got food, my mother will hide it, because Italians wi -- would raid the house and look\nfor food. And she would hide things in -- I remember in a great, big pot of gardenias. She would\nput potatoes, or something, I forget in a pot, or sacks of flour in a big pot, and then put soil, and\ngardenias on top. Or other things. But I remember they would come and lift the mattresses, and\nlook under -- under the mattress to see if there was anything hiding in there.",
        "Q: And they\u2019d be assuming that you were a well to do family, and might be the very place to\nhave food.",
        "A: Yes. People were really hungry those days. I would see people fall in the streets from hunger.\nChildren. I sti -- I still remember children looking anorectic, you know, this pale, yellow, a green\ncolor almost. And just walking and collapsing. It was terrible, absolutely terrible. As I said, I\ndon\u2019t think we -- we were hungry, that -- as to not having food, but we certainly didn\u2019t have\nmeat. We didn\u2019t have eggs, which was a constant supply in the household. We had a lot of beans\nand chick peas, vegetables, whatever vegetables we can get.",
        "Q: Would you still be sitting down rather formally, with the maid serving all of you according to\nyour hierarchy, even with simpler foods?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: So the -- the staff with your family would in fact be fortunate -- perhaps more fortunate than\ntheir families in the -- in the mountains, in perhaps having more food.",
        "A: Well, I think the people in the mountain didn\u2019t suffer that much because the earth produced,\nand many of them had also animals they could slaughter. They had chickens, lamb, whatever.\nBut it was the people in the city that couldn\u2019t find food.",
        "Q: And the cause of this famine in Greece, was that because ships could not get through to the\nport?",
        "A: I think 1t was mostly because the Italians were taking all the food, but I\u2019m sure that also, you\nknow, supplies couldn\u2019t come, yes.",
        "Q: So suffering was really quite considerable?",
        "A: It was considerable, not only in Volos, but also in Athens and other parts of Greece, yes.",
        "Q: Now are there any other things you remember during that period of Italian occupation that be\n-- the famine, but were the Italians taking any measures against the Jews?",
        "A: No, the Italians did not take any measures against the je -- Jews. First of all, in 1940 through\n\u201943, it was just the Italians. It was in \u00b043 that Italy capitulated, and then the Germans took over.\nNo, there was absolutely nothing. I remember there was a big, sort of a club that my father used\nto go there, and my mother, and occasionally sh -- I would go, which wasn\u2019t far from my house,\ncalled Exorise thekey, they had the restaurant there, there was a movie theater. And the Italians\nhave taken this, and I guess they lived there, but there were also Italians outside guarding the\nplace, and every time I would pass by, the Italian will say to me, bambina, bambina, and would\ntake candy to give me. Will reach in his pocket, and show me the candy, and I would just walk\npast him, you know, I just didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with him. And so, you know, me --\nI mean -- but I -- but I remember some things. I remember a man being beaten with a gun, with\nthe back of the gun. I don\u2019t know what he did, but I remember that an Italian was really beating\nhim up. This was --",
        "Q: And that would have -- you -- that was something you observed in the street, or --",
        "A: Yeah, it was in the street, yeah.",
        "Q: And I\u2019m assuming in your attitude, you\u2019d have taken your cue from your parents, but the --\nthe Italians would be hated as the occupiers?",
        "A: Yeah, of course, yes.",
        "Q: And then everything changed when the Germans occupied -- moved into Greece in 1943.",
        "A: Right. Volos was under Italian re -- you see, Greece was occu -- was divided in three parts. It\nwas the German sector, which was mostly Salonika, and in the north Athens, Volos, were under\nItalian occupation, and then Macedonia, and Face were under Bulgarian occupation. The Italians\nwere by far the mildest occu -- you know, occupying force. But I -- we left Volos in 19 -- in the\nspring of 1943, before the Germans arrived, and we went to Athens. So I never saw Germans in\nVolos.",
        "Q: And why did your family move to Athens?",
        "A: Well, I think because -- you see, in \u201943, nothing much was happening yet, but there were\nrumors about Salonika. My father was a very well informed person, and saw that probably\nsomething was going to happen. So he wanted us to be safe. We could not hide in Volos,\neverybody knew us. Although people were wonderful to us, and very friendly, and very willing\nto put us up for as long as we needed to. We still were -- everybody knew us, so there was no\nway of -- of hiding. Of course, there were the mountains, the mountain Pilion that a lot of Jewish\npeople from Volos went to. But that wasn\u2019t safe either for us, because as I said, we were quite\nwell known, so Pilion wasn\u2019t that terribly far. That\u2019s why we left and went to Athens, where we\ncould be somewhat anonymous in there.",
        "Q: Do you remember your parents ever talking about the -- the Jews in Salonika, and I wondered\nwhat they knew, and I wondered what they shared.",
        "A: Well, they didn\u2019t share anything with me. I was quite young at the time. But I was told that\nwe had to move almost like two or three days before to move, that we were going to Athens. And\nthis was a place I always wanted to go. I always thought of Athens as the magnificent city. So --\nbut then when I realized that we were not coming back to Volos, it wasn\u2019t just a trip, I started\nthinking differently, and getting a little anxious. Not much was explained to me, and as a result\nof that, my imagination was wild. I would think all sorts of things, and of course, I couldn\u2019t\ndiscuss them, because it was like this is for the good of us, or this kind of thing. There kind of\nanswers were -- actually didn\u2019t give me much to go with. I think --",
        "Q: Did that -- did that make it worse?",
        "A: For me it did, to a certain extent, because I could never get a straight answer of what was\ngoing on, and I knew a lot was going on.",
        "Q: And were you noticing -- do you have memories of noticing a changed mood? Fear on the\npart of your parents?",
        "A: Yes, yes. I can see the change of mood, I can see the worry. I mean, I could sense it, but I\ncouldn\u2019t discuss it, yes.",
        "Q: And you were -- you were 10 then?",
        "A: Right. When we left Volos on that sleek, little cargo boat, with forged papers, actually, to -- to\ngo to Athens, I was 10.",
        "Q: False papers. Now, who would have supplied them, and would you have had Greek Orthodox\nnames, and so on?",
        "A: That\u2019s true. We had different names, Greek Orthodox names. And my name was Paulik\nSanny. And they used to call me Polly, and sometimes I would forget and somebody would call\nme Polly, I wouldn\u2019t respond. I guess the -- the police would issue false identity card, because\nwhen we went -- we left Volos on this little, tiny boat full of sacks of flour and many rats, we --\nthe boat broke down, and we had to stop for a couple of nights in -- in the cape. There is -- you\nsee, Volos is like a gulf. The very tip of the -- of the gulf is called Trikery, which is a lovely little\nplace, but we had to stay there for about two or three nights until another boat will come and pick\nus up, and take us to Evian, and from there we went by car to Athens. So the whole trip took\nabout 10 days, maybe a week, but I think it was more like 10 days, because boats were\nunreliable.",
        "Q: And which members of the family would be on this boat with you, and did any of your\nhousehold staff leave with you?",
        "A: Yes, my parents, and my sister, and I. My grandmother -- maternal grandmother, my Aunt\nJulia, who is my mother\u2019s sister, with her husband and son, and one of our household persons\nwas with us.",
        "Q: And who -- who was that?",
        "A: I think her name was Penny.",
        "Q: And would she be a -- a maid, or a cook, or a governess?",
        "A: Well, I guess she was everything. A little bit of everything, but she was very devoted to the\nfamily, and she said if the family was going to leave Volos, she was coming with us.",
        "Q: And was she Jewish?",
        "A: No, no. She was one of the girls from the mountains. She probably wanted to go to Athens.",
        "Q: And whatever discussions went on be -- prior to this plan being made, you were not -- you\nwere protected, and you were not privy as a -- as a young child, or a 10 year old.",
        "A: No, I certainly wasn\u2019t privy, but I could see, I mean, the house is being dismantled, things are\nbeing moved to storage spaces, or some things are being shipped, and other things were given to\nfriends or neighbors for safekeeping. We didn\u2019t recover any of that, like paintings, or carpets. So\nI knew that we were moving. To me it was a little bit of an adventure, to be -- being on a boat,\nand the boat breaking down, and all that kind of stuff. I didn\u2019t particularly like to sleep on sacks\nof flour, and I was afraid of the rats. There were a lot of rats there.",
        "Q: What do you remember of your -- of your sister\u2019s attitude?",
        "A: I think my sister was taking care of me. She would always make sure I was fine, and I wasn\u2019t\ntoo close to the edge of the -- of the boat, or I was -- I was -- well, she would talk to me, but --",
        "Q: Did she seem -- do you -- well, wonder if you even know if she was troubled.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure she was troubled. Now, how much troubled, I don\u2019t know. I think she was protective\nof my parents, so I think she tried not to show her anxiety much.",
        "Q: The -- this was -- I mean, it was a plan that obviously -- I would think obviously, talking to\naccount that your father was full of concern about what was likely to happen. Do you -- do you\nremember if he ever thought of -- of leaving Europe, or -- or going somewhere much farther\naway, leaving Greece? He would be a man with contacts, and so on, in other European nations.",
        "A: I never discussed this with him, but I have a feeling he would never go anywhere other than\nGreece. I think --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nPaulette Nehama. This is tape number two, side A. You\u2019re telling me that your father never\nconsidered going anywhere beyond Greece.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. Although he never discussed it with me. I think --",
        "Q: Anybody -- was there anyone you knew who considered fleeing to the United States?",
        "A: I never knew of anybody who came to the United States at the time. Some people went to\nPalestine, or Turkey.",
        "Q: And who were they?",
        "A: There was a friend of mine who was a little younger, and her family. And they went on a\nsmall boat, and unfortunately they left them -- there were other people with them, but they were\nleft on a -- on a rock. Supposedly the boat had trouble, and the man went up to -- went to fix the\nboat and never came back. And they were picked up much, much later, by another boat. But they\nstayed on that rock for maybe a week or so. So there were incidents like this, you would hear all\nover the place.",
        "Q: And did they return to Greece, or did they continue on their way?",
        "A: They returned to Greece, and they went into hiding in Greece, yes.",
        "Q: And let\u2019s go back to the move to Athens, and tell me about your life there, prior to going into\nhiding.",
        "A: Okay, so we moved, as I said, we came on these two different boats that took about 10 days to\nget to Athens, and normally the trip is like two days at the most. In Athens my uncle, who was\nmy father\u2019s younger brother who lived there, had found a place for us. It was an apartment at --\nwe had one floor, my aunt and grandmother had another in the same building. And we went\nthere. It was spring, so I didn\u2019t go to school, because school would have been over pretty soon.\nAnd I guess we were trying to -- to get acquainted to -- to the city, and to -- to find our way\naround. There wasn\u2019t much we were doing as far as I was concerned. My only playmate was my\ncousin, who was I|1 years old -- I mean, 11 months older than me, and we were constant\ncompanions. I don\u2019t remember having friends, or being encouraged to -- to make friends. Since I\ndidn\u2019t go to school, of course I couldn\u2019t meet other children. Then, in September of 1943, we\nwent into hiding. And the events prior to this, I remember them very clearly. I had the mumps,\nand I was in bed, and the dining room was adjacent to the bedroom. So my -- all my aunts, and\nuncles came and they were having meetings with my parents in this dining room, and I could\nhear them whispering. I could not make out any words, but I knew something very serious was\ngoing on. And obviously they were planning where each one was going to go, what they were\ngoing to do, and it was like a big family meeting. My sister was in that -- in that meeting.\nOccasionally she would come out and check on me, to make sure I was all right, or put some hot\npads on my cheeks, which was the normal treatment. And then she would go back in the room.\nAnd when I would ask what is it that -- why are you all in there, and she would say, \u201cWell, we --\nwe just need to discuss some adult things. Don\u2019t worry, everything is fine.\u201d And but of course I\nworried, because I knew everything wasn\u2019t fine. So I remember that very, very clearly.",
        "Q: What had triggered this -- what had triggered the plan, and the crisis, if you like?",
        "A: I think the fact that they were hearing more and more things about the Germans coming to\nAthens, and I think it was about the time that Italy capitulated, and they probably knew that if\nGermans come, they would probably treat the Jews the same way they treated them in Salonika.\nSo some advance thinking, at least to have the plan, and if you need to use it, you use it. It was\nnecessary to do that time.",
        "Q: Was there any leadership coming through the synagogue, or the Jewish community, do you\nthink, to help people deal with this? I mean, did all families begin to make plans at the same\ntime?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know for sure, but I have a feeling they probably did. Some decided the very last\nmoment to go somewhere, because this is something you don\u2019t want to believe that this going to\nhappen. It\u2019s pretty unbelievable. So most people denied as wildly exaggerating, or this isn\u2019t\ngoing to happen to us. But people with advanced thinking, and people who know about the\nworld, I guess, don\u2019t leave things to chances. And my father was one of these people.",
        "Q: Meanwhile, you were living under false names in Athens, but would your -- would neighbors\nknow your real identity, or would you keep very much to family, and not be mixing much with\npeople who were not close to you?",
        "A: That is true. I don\u2019t remember mixing much with other people. We didn\u2019t have neighbors --\nactually, there was a lady but 1 -- who lived in the same building, but I think she was also Jewish.\nAnd we pretty much stayed with the family. I don\u2019t remember venturing out much -- I mean, not\n-- we were free to come and go, but I would always go out with someone, I would never go out\nalone. But there was no -- no particular friends that I remember at that time.",
        "Q: Now, from the time of these whispered meetings, when you had the mumps, to the time when\nyou left the apartment and went into hiding, how much time went by?",
        "A: Probably a month. Because we went into hiding in September of \u201943, and the meetings must\nhave been like a few -- a month, or maybe two at the most, before.",
        "Q: And what preparation -- obviously the planning was going on, but as a child, do you have any\nmemory of the activities going on in the apartment? I mean, was there packing of valuables, or\nanything that you remember observing?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think we have any valuables, because I think a lot of the furniture was in there, in the\napartment when we arrived. It wa -- I don\u2019t think it was our furniture, I don\u2019t recall. So this\nprobably was a -- a furnished place when we arrived. As far as clothing, I think we took\nwhatever we needed, which wasn\u2019t much at the time. Maybe some books. I took my favorite\ndoll. I was a big doll person. And I guess that was it, but no utensils, or anything else, because\nwhen we were into hiding, we lived with other families, not Jewish families, Greek Orthodox\nfamilies, so they had their own household.",
        "Q: And when you left Volos, and came to Greece, you\u2019d already taken a huge -- or made a huge\nchange in your standard of living. I assume that the apartment in Greece would be much more\nsparse, you\u2019d left all your possessions and so on behind.",
        "A: Right, yeah. They all went into storage. As I said, some things went to friends or neighbors\nfor safekeeping. A lot of stuff we did not recover.",
        "Q: How -- they would simply not -- they\u2019d have disappeared, or they wouldn\u2019t -- friends and\nneighbors would not honor the --",
        "A: Either they would move away, or some people even denied of -- I remember there was a\npainting that was the favorite painting of my mother\u2019s, and this woman denied that she ever had\nit. And it was an outright lie. So, things like that. I don\u2019t remember if we sold things. I can\u2019t\nrecall that. But I remember when we arrived in Athens we didn\u2019t have much. It was a big change,\ndefinitely.",
        "Q: Let me go back to the woman and the painting. It\u2019s a -- m-m-maybe -- maybe it sheds light on\nsomething. Obviously to have left a cherished possession with her, she would have been a trusted\nfriend. I -- I wondered was that -- her not honoring that trust later, what did that mean?",
        "A: Well, I think it was a devastating thing to find that you cannot trust people, on top of\neverything else that\u2019s happening. At least there were people you could count on, and you cannot\ncount on them. And you really don\u2019t know to whom you can turn when things are bad. I think\nthat was the story in the -- the experience. How can she be so blatant, and say, we didn\u2019t get it,\nthey didn\u2019t give it to us.",
        "Q: And then wa -- when it comes to going into hiding, you had to know that you could trust the\npeople that you were going to be with. What do you know about the -- how the family split up,\nwho you stayed with.",
        "A: Okay, first of all, my father had found this place through a friend, a very good friend of his.\nHe had baptized the oldest child, by the name of Many Babella, and he knew the family well. So\nhe had talked to them, and they had agreed to take us. Of course, families could not -- families\ncould not be together if there were more than two, three people, because they could be easily\nspotted, and they had to disperse. My father went to some other family, and my mother and I,\nand sister, went to Calivare, which is a suburb of Athens, to this wonderful family of a couple,\nthe name was Pavella. And they had three children, a 15 year old, and one girl who was Kate,\nshe was 10, as I was, and a younger boy about six or seven, called Dimitris. My mother, sister,\nand I shared one room. So the three of us shared one room, my father was elsewhere, and we had\nour meals with the family, I was playing with the children, who were about the same age as I\nwas. I wasn\u2019t going to school, and my excuse was that I had appendicitis. And I wasn\u2019t supposed\nto go to school. This was what I was telling the children. Of course, they all wanted to see my\nincision, and there was no incision. Basically, I liked these kids, and they were just great, they\nwere warm, and would play all sorts of games, and we had a great connection. My mother would\ncommunicate with my father once a week by telephone, and this was like a coded message.\nWhen the news were bad, the message was, the patient is very sick. When the news was better, it\nwas that, well, the patient is doing better. So, this was a pre-arranged kind of code for them to\ncommunicate. My sister became good friends with the sister of the woman who hid us, the\nfamily there. She had a bakery right across from where we were. And my sister would go there\nsometimes, and also Adhero will come to -- to the house. She was very warm, and caring, and\noften will bring cookies from the bakery.",
        "Q: I -- I wanted to clarify your not going to school was really because your -- you were more\neffectively hidden if you didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Right, yeah.",
        "Q: And then -- well, loo -- let\u2019s go ahead.",
        "A: Yeah, I couldn\u2019t go to school, because that involves being outside, and being in public. The --\nthe fear was that somebody may recognize us. Same thing for my mother and sister, we couldn\u2019t\nventure very far other than across the street to the bakery, because although we had left Volos,\nwhere we were very well known, and in Athens we were more -- more unknown people, it still\nthe possibility that somebody would recognize us, and mention our names, and then everybody\nwill be in great peril. Of course, the family that hid us was in danger by hiding us. These were\nwonderful people. He worked for -- the man of the family worked for a Greek newspaper, so he\ncould bring home news of what was going on. His wife was also a very good housekeeper,\ncaring for the children, and very nice, and my mother and Dasseia became friends. And even\nafter the war they would see each other. And there was great respect for each other. So there was\n-- there were good feelings there, and a good connection. As I said, we couldn\u2019t go out, we\ncouldn\u2019t do things that we normally used to do. But maybe for my mother this was a big loss, but\nfor me it was fun because there were children to play with. At some point, I think 1t was probably\naround December, which was like three months after we went into hiding to the Pavella family,\nmy father joined us. I guess he had become very lonely in the family he was with in Athens, and\nhe decided to come to be with us. Of course, this was with the agreement of the family we lived\nin. But shortly after, I remember it very clearly, one evening, Adhero, the -- the wife\u2019s sister,\nwho had the bakery, came running to the house, and saying, \u201cYou must leave immediately. I\nheard from somebody that they know you are Jewish, and you are hiding.\u201d We used to tell, or the\nfamily used to tell that we were relatives, because sometimes we would be out in the yard, and\npeople would ask, who are these people? They say they were relatives. And this man, who\nhappened to be drunk, and he was in a tavern, in a Greek tavern, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t get fooled, these\npeople are not relatives of the Pavella family, they are Jews, and they are hiding.\u201d So it was\nheard by everybody who was in that tavern, and Adhero happened to be there. And she ran and\ntold us to leave immediately. Well, the first one who left was my father, because he was in\ngreater danger. And he walked from Calivare to Athens with the man of the family, Milanos\nPavella. He wouldn\u2019t let him go by himself. He took him on foot. And the next night, all three of\nus, my mother, my sister, and I, when it became dark, we also left with him. He came back, of\ncourse, after taking my father to a friend\u2019s house in Athens. He came back and took us to -- to\nAthens. Now this is about, I don\u2019t know, probably -- I remember walking for a long, long, long\ntime in the night. I don\u2019t know exactly how far it is, but I\u2019m sure it must be like six miles, 10\nmiles from Athens. So it\u2019s a long walk for a 10 year old. And we had put scarfs on our heads,\nand tied them so people wouldn\u2019t recognize us immediately. So when we go to Athens, we\nimmediately went where my father was, at the friend\u2019s house. Now these were very good friends,\nwho were notified, apparently, when this incident of somebody saying that we were Jews\noccurred. And they were looking for a place for us to go. But until they found a place, we\ncouldn\u2019t stay together, because they were in danger. So my sister went to a friend\u2019s house, one of\nher friends from Volos, that family lived in Athens, and they took her. And I went -- they took\nme to somebody\u2019s house in Athens, and all I remember, it was like a mansion, a huge place. And\nthere lived a man in a wheelchair. I think he was an old man, but here again [indecipherable]\nwrong, being 10 years old -- and a woman who was taking care of him. I don\u2019t think she was a\nrelative, I think she was a caretaker. And I was left there for 10 days by myself, not having\ncommunication with my family, not knowing what was going on, not knowing these people. I\nthink this man didn\u2019t talk to me, or if he did, it must have been one or two words, or maybe he\ncouldn\u2019t talk. I remember the woman feeding him, spoonfeeding him, so obviously he was pretty\nsick. And I was desperate. I was totally lost. I didn\u2019t know what happened to my parents, I didn\u2019t\nknow if they would ever pick me up. But the woman, the caretaker of this man was a very kind\nwoman, so when I would cry, she would try to comfort me, or tell me stories, or all sorts of\nthings, just to make me feel good about it. Well, in about 10 days, my sister came, and she said,\n\u201cWe have a place now. I\u2019m ga -- I\u2019m here to pick you up, to take you.\u201d I don\u2019t know if she had\ncalled before or not, I don\u2019t recall. But I took my little satchel of things, a couple of changes of\nclothe -- clothes, and my doll, and said good-bye and left. And we went -- we met again at this\nfriend\u2019s house, and we went, I think in installments again, my father went first, or we went first,\nto the second house, where we spent about seven months. This was in Kipserly. It was the family\nof Andonis Vayas, who was an officer in the navy. And they had -- he and his wife had the little\ngirl about three years old. And I think there was a grandmother who was deaf, and also lived in\nthe house, but we hardly saw her. She stayed in her room for the most time. Anyway, so it was a\nnew adjustment. We had a very large room for the four of us, so there was like a -- a screen put\nin the middle, so on one side where my parents were sleeping, and on the other side was my\nsister and I. We were sharing the other side of the room. And we were closer to the street, it was\non a street level, and closer to the street. I slept on a cot. And I remember at night I would hear\nthe Germans patrolling, and I could hear their boots going by my window. And I would stop\nbreathing. I was so petrified, because I thought they were coming for us. And I would pull the\nblanket over my head, and stop breathing, I -- until I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t do it any more, and I\nhad to breathe. So then slowly I will pull the blanket off my head, and I would listen very\ncarefully, and by then the steps with the boots -- because I knew -- I knew they were boots,\nwould disa -- have disappeared, or they would have gone away, or they were far, so I knew we\nwere safe. This was my biggest fear, that they would come and get us. Here again, I didn\u2019t go to\nschool. My father tried to teach me some arithmetic, and I think I had two books, \u201cRobinson\nCrusoe,\u201d and another one, which was a rather gloomy book called, \u201cThe Orphans of Scotland.\u201d\nAnd it was nothing but -- you know, five orphans, or maybe more, whose father was in prison,\nand how they got him out of prison in a basket, and things like that. But it was a rather sad book,\nif I remember correctly. Then I got hold of a children\u2019s magazine heyou -- I think it was a\nweekly magazine. I don\u2019t know who gave it to us, or how I got hold of it, and it had wonderful\nstories, and this was very nice for me too, to read. Other than that, think my imagination went\nwild, because I used to play in the backyard, and all I would do 1s pick up bamboo stick, and\npretend it was a gun, and was shooting all the Germans. And we were free, I thought, by me\ndoing that. Games like this. Occasional I will play with a three year old little girl. But that was\nabout it. The backyard had a fence, and the next house was also a two story house, I think, and in\nthe balcony there was a little girl who would be out practically every day, and playing with dolls,\nand other toys. And I would go next to the fence, and we started talking. And she would always\ninvite me to go to her house to play. But of course, I knew I couldn\u2019t, so I would find all sorts of\nexcuses that I couldn\u2019t go. But one time I couldn\u2019t bear it any more, so I jumped the fence. On\nour side of the yard, the fence was reasonably manageable, I could go over it. But when I\njumped, it was very high on her side. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t break a leg. So I jumped the fence, and\nwent to her apartment and played there for awhile. Of course, nobody in my family knew that I\nleft the house. But when it was time for me to go back, I just couldn\u2019t climb the fence, it was too\nmuch. So finally I decided I had to go around the corner, because this house was around the\ncorner. So I came, and rang the doorbell, and of course the woman opened the door, and she was\nSO surprised to see me. And my mother came, and she was absolutely pale when she saw me. I\ngot a good spanking for that, I remember. I wasn\u2019t supposed to -- to leave the house, especially\nnot telling anybody. But it was that urge to be with other children, to be able to play, to be -- to\nhave a normal life like any other child that made me do that.",
        "Q: Now, at first when you were rescued by your sister from the elderly man, that must have been\nsimply wonderful, to be reunited again.",
        "A: Oh sure, that was.",
        "Q: And I am guessing that was the hardest experience, is that right?",
        "A: Yes, it was a very hard experience. It was a hard experience because I\u2019ve never been alone\nwith strangers. I was -- I didn\u2019t know -- I had the feeling that -- oh, I was afraid that maybe my\nparents were taken by the Germans, and I couldn\u2019t see them again, or they wouldn\u2019t come back\nfor me, or they would leave me there forever. That was the feeling. It was a sense of\nabandonment, but I\u2019m sure they had no other choice to -- to send me any place else, I mean, I\ndon\u2019t know what went on, and how it was decided for me to go to this man\u2019s house. Obviously\nnot everybody is willing to take a 10 year old under such circumstances. You know, 10 year olds\ntalk, and jump fences. So they are dangerous. But it was -- it was a very sad time for me.",
        "Q: Do you think that that\u2019s stayed with you, any of those feelings?",
        "A: Well, I think the fear of abandonment has stayed. And at different times I have felt it quite\nstrongly. Also, I think at times when I think a child being left alone, although there were people -\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number two, side B. The -- I want to go back a moment and ask for more\ninformation about the two families that you stayed with --",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: -- or three, in fact, 1f you count the elderly man.",
        "A: Well, after the second one, yeah, we went to a third one because the -- my father was taken by\nthe Greek Nazis -- Greek SS, as they used to call them. They were watching the house in -- the\nthird house, and -- no, actually, the second house in Kipserly. And one day they burst in,\npretending they were people from the power company, and they wanted to read the meter, but\nthey came in with guns, and they were asking for Moudzoukos. And they took him, and\nfortunately he had money on him. He had British pounds that were all sewn around his west --\nwaistband, and he paid them. And they told him that he and his family had to leave within five\nhours, and they didn\u2019t guarantee his safety, or anybody else\u2019s safety. So when they came to get\nmy father -- panic-stricken my mother, and my sister, and me -- my sister went next door -- here\nagain, she jumped from a terrace to the next terrace, where there were people that had help us\nfind this house as well. And this was in -- somebody in the -- I think in the Supreme Court, or --\nhe was in charge, anyway, and we knew them. So she notify them, and they notified another\nfriend, who immediately came -- nearby there was a market, and he was watching the house to\nsee the activity and what was going on. And as soon as they brought my father back, he came in\nthe house and took us to his house. And from there he found another place for us. So I think we\nstayed overnight, or maybe a couple of days, until a second hou -- a third house was found. And\nthat\u2019s when we moved again.",
        "Q: And all these families that were taking you in were Greek Orthodox families?",
        "A: Yes, they were Greek Orthodox families, they were also compensated financially. Because\nthere were expenses, you know. We had to eat, and they had to eat. And of course, there was\nsome danger in there. So they were being compensated.",
        "Q: I mean, were they richly rewarded, or was it -- or do you feel it was simply that you were\nallowed to make a contribution for real costs?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the answer. I have a feeling that at the time, it was just for expenses, but I know\nthat after the war, they were very much helped by my father when things started going much\nbetter. Because I remember this navy officer who would come often, and ask for a loan, or things\nlike that. And then my father would forgive the loan. So probably it was after the war, but I -- I\ndon\u2019t know for sure.",
        "Q: I also assume that they were taking very great risks. What would -- if they had been found to\nhave been sheltering Jews, would their lives be in danger, as we -- as well as the other side of\nthat is that your lives were in their hands.",
        "A: Absolutely. They were very courageous people to do that, and they were great human beings\nto be able to -- to help somebody else at such a risk, yes, because if anybody was found to be\nsheltering Jews, could be shot, he and his family. So, it was a great danger to have Jews in the\nfamily.",
        "Q: What did they give as their reasons?",
        "A: Their reasons for what?",
        "Q: For -- for sheltering you, would they say this -- you would do it for us, or this is just common\nhuman decency?",
        "A: Yeah, I think that that was the main thing, that this was common decency. I remember\nPavellas, the first house we went, when he learned that this guy said something about us being\nJewish, and hiding, and you know, he came to notify us. She said, \u201cYou know, the -- the Nazi\nmay come and take them.\u201d And Milanos said, \u201cOver my dead body.\u201d So he had a very sense -- a\nvery good sense of protecting us, of not letting anything happen to us. That\u2019s why he dro -- he --\nhe walk with my father from Calivare to Athens, and the next day he walk back again with my\nsister -- my mother, and my sister, and myself. So, I mean, he was a man who would take it very\nseriously that this was the lives of people that were under his care, and he wouldn\u2019t let anything\nhappen, I mean, as far as he could control that.",
        "Q: I-It does seem very na -- I mean, he was doing the right thing, but it also seems to me\nadmirable, because his own children were placed at risk in -- in acting morally, and so on.",
        "A: Right. That\u2019s right, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Now --",
        "A: Also -- also, the children did not know we were Jewish. Only the eldest daughter, Many, who\nwas 15, knew. She knew. But the children also -- the family had to sacrifice, they had to give up\na room. You know, I mean this was a very small house, it wasn\u2019t a huge place, it wasn\u2019t a\nmansion. So they had to give up a room for us to stay. They had to share the bathroom, they had\nto -- to share the kitchen, or whatever. So they made sacrifices as well.",
        "Q: Tell me what day to day life would be like with the Pavellas. I mean, would you -- would you\nall eat meals together, and would you do chores in the house? Like who would clean the\nbathroom, and what do you remember about the daily life at that time?",
        "A: For me, it was a good time, because I had company. I mean, it was great to have the children,\nwho were fun children to be with. The chores were like sitting -- setting the table, or things like\nthat. We all had dinner together, we all ate together. I think the cooking was done by my mother,\nand by Desseia. Desseia would do the shopping, or sometimes Milanos, the father, would do the\nshopping. And they would take turns cooking. And as far as cleaning, I think we were\nresponsible for cleaning our room, making our beds, doing the laundry, or setting it out, I don\u2019t\nremember, in those days you were just washing, you know, by hand. So I think things were\ndivided that way. For me, I remember I would wait impatiently until the children will come\nhome from school, because that was the fun time I could play with. During the day my mother\ntried to engage me in teaching me how to embroider, or how to sew, and I had no interest\nwhatsoever in any of these sedentary activities. Plus my eyes were not very good, so I couldn\u2019t\nconcentrate on a little hole there for hours. I -- I -- I may have had one or two books, but\nbasically I think I had a vivid imagination and I would make up stories. And when the children\nwill come, I will tell them stories, or they will tell me jokes, and this kind of thing. We didn\u2019t go\nout, but yet had a huge yard, and that was nice, because we could play outside.",
        "Q: What about clothes?",
        "A: Oh, you had just not too many clothes. You just wore the same things over and over. I mean,\nyou washed them, but I didn\u2019t wash them, my mother washed them. But there were no new\nclothes, I mean, probably she would take the here -- sometimes I would get my sister\u2019s things,\nand she would hem them. But there was a 10 -- 10 year difference, so you can imagine that her\nclothes didn\u2019t quite fit me right, even if the hem was put up. So my biggest -- my happiest thing\nwhen she got engaged, was that I would have a new dress. That was a big thing.",
        "Q: What do you remember of your -- of your sister and your mother\u2019s state of mind at this time?\nI mean, it sounds as if for you, when you were at the Pavellas, it was not a difficult time, perhaps\nbecause you -- I mean, it was difficult in the sense that 1t was -- you couldn\u2019t go to school, but\nthat -- maybe I\u2019m wrong in saying it was not difficult, but not painfully difficult like the time\nwhen you were abandoned and alone.",
        "A: Right. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m sure it was very difficult for my mother, first of all because my father\nwas elsewhere, and for my sister, because she was older, and she could understand the dangers,\nand whatever was going on. So, since I didn\u2019t know that much about what was going on in the\nworld, you know, I wasn\u2019t particularly worried. I was worried about my father, and I wanted my\nfather to be with us, and I was told he eventually will be with us, but that was about it. I -- I\ndidn\u2019t feel deprived, although, you know, food was not really -- it was difficult to get food. So I\nremember some of the dishes, it was like cabbage with rice, and carrots. And to this day I make\nit, and I think exactly of -- of that time. I loved it, it was great dish. You know, I mean, meat,\neggs, fish probably were not available that much, and they were expensive. So, you know, when\nyou have a large family to feed, it\u2019s considerable. But yes, it wasn\u2019t a painful time for me. It was\nmore of a -- of an interesting time, or a fun time, I would think. But the other two places we\nwent, it was a more painful time, because number one, I lost the children, you know, I -- I didn\u2019t\nhave my friends any more. So that was a big loss when we left. And they -- I was asking Many\nwhen I saw her a couple of years ago, how was it for them when we left? And what did their\nparents tell them? And she said they missed us terribly, because we had become very connected.\nThe second house, the Vaia house, I was -- I was upset most of the time because -- a little bit of it\nwas boredom, a little bit of 1t was inability to go out and do things. Just -- I felt stagnated, there\nwasn\u2019t much to do. But I knew that everybody else was trying very hard to -- to put a good face\nfor the other person, so I was trying to be cheerful, so my parents won\u2019t get upset.",
        "Q: When you spoke of the code language between your parents, first of all, would there be a\nphone in the home at that time, or would your mother have to go somewhere to make that call?",
        "A: She would have to go to the bakery across the street, at a time where the bakery wasn\u2019t\ncrowded, like two or three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, which 1s siesta time in Greece, to call around\nthat time. Occasionally, I was allowed to talk to my father, but here again it was very brief, and it\nwas like -- I was told never to mention names, like his name -- well, his name was Daddy, but\nnever to mention my sister\u2019s name is Yola, or things like that. And he would ask me how are\nyou, are you a good girl, or you know, things, very brief kind of things. And that was about it.",
        "Q: What did -- what did you know about the treatment of the Jews by the Germans then?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know anything. My parents probably knew what happened in Salonika, but I had no\nidea. I was kept very safe from information of that sort. And since my parents were not together,\nand they couldn\u2019t discuss it openly, I couldn\u2019t hear anything.",
        "Q: Would you see mistreatment of Jews in the streets, or do you know of family members\nobserving beatings, or killings?",
        "A: No, most of it is what I heard. I actually saw a German kicking a man outside my window in\nthe second house where we were. I could hear the screams, and the shutters were always halfway\nclosed, and I could see this -- hear this scream, so I looked outside, and there was a German\nsoldier kicking a man -- to me it seemed like an old man -- many times. I don\u2019t know if he was a\nJewish man or not, but I remember feeling very angry that he was doing that. And then my\nmother came and pulled me away from the window, so I don\u2019t know what happened. But I kept\non thinking about this man for a long time, and I still do.",
        "Q: Do you attribute your survival to these families? I assume that you do.",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely.",
        "Q: And how many -- how widespread was this? Do you -- do you have any sense of the numbers\nof families who would be sheltering Jews? Was it extremely rare, or was it very common?",
        "A: No, I think it was common. People -- you see, Greek people are very kind, and very\nhospitalble -- hop -- hospitable. So to them, hiding somebody in need was not extraordinary,\nalthough it is extraordinary, it was you\u2019re a human being, I\u2019m a human being, we have to help\neach other, because if I were on your side, I would expect that you would do something like this.\nSo it was -- they were very generous people to do that, I mean, and very kind. Very kind.",
        "Q: I wondered if -- if 1t\u2019s known, of -- later, do -- do you know of any families that -- where the -\n- the Jews that they were hiding were discovered, and what actions were taken against these\nsheltering families?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know of any. I don\u2019t know of any.",
        "Q: And at this time, how would you get news? You were -- you -- with the Pavellas you were\ngetting it through Mr. Pavella\u2019s newspaper, but would there be a radio in the home? Would you\nlisten to -- to news programs, or would your mother get the news in code from your father?",
        "A: My mother would get the news about the Jews in code from my father only for a short period\nof time when my father was separate. But then he -- he came to live with us, and then the second\nhouse, and the third house he was with us, so we were all together. It was primarily the men of\nthe family that would go out and hear things, they would bring newspaper. I think there was a\nradio. I think radios were not allowed, certain stations were not allowed, and you had to take\nyour radio so it would be sealed, as they used to call it. But I remember hearing some news.\nThere was a small radio, and I remember my father putting his ear practically on the radio to -- to\nlisten. I don\u2019t know if it was BBC or whatever, but he would listen.",
        "Q: What -- what do you mean sealed, when --",
        "A: Well, they used to block certain stations, so you couldn\u2019t listen to all those stations. And these\nwere the stations that would give you news, propaganda, and all sorts of things. You know, just\nkind of controlled the -- the stations you could use.",
        "Q: Now, at this time do you remember knowing anything about resistance fighters?",
        "A: Yes, that I knew, and quite often my imaginary games including me being a resistance fighter,\nbecause that bamboo stick that I carried on my shoulder was primarily killing Germans, and\noften it was being a resistance fighter, just fighting for freedom.",
        "Q: So th -- th -- those were the heroes, rather than the sheltering families?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Well, how did this period of hiding come to an end? What happened, and also how old were\nyou when you no longer needed to be in hiding?",
        "A: Okay, the -- the liberation came in 1944, October \u201944. So I was 11 years old. We were hiding\nfor four -- 13 months, or a little over 13 months. The news came, I think from the radio that we\nwere free, October 12\", in Athens, later in other places, going north, as the Germans started\nretreating. It was -- I think it was the radio, but I also think that the man of the house, of the third\nhouse, came and said, \u201cThe Germans are leaving, we are free.\u201d And I remember my sister and\nthe -- the daughter of the household, her name was Maria, she was older than me, but she was\ncloser to my sister age, and they were dancing. So we listened to the radio, and I think some\npeople also came to announce the freedom, that we were free now. They didn\u2019t know we were\nJewish, but they came to say the Germans have left, or are leaving. And it was going to be a big\ncelebration downtown in Athens. So my sister and Maria were going to go, and I wanted to go\nwith them. I was crying to go with them. They wouldn\u2019t let me because I was too young. And\napparently a lot of crowds were there, you know, so they could have let me go get a sense of\nwhat was going on, but anyway, they -- I couldn\u2019t go. So I stayed home with my parents, but\nYola, my sister, and Maria went, and they came home about 12 o\u2019clock, and they was telling us\nit was such a frenzy, 1t was wonderful, everybody was jumping and laughing, and it was -- it was\ngreat.",
        "Q: And did things change very quickly? I mean, what -- what happened next? Would it take\nawhile to pick up the pieces of your old life?",
        "A: Yes. For one thing we were free, but we had no place to go. We didn\u2019t have -- we couldn\u2019t go\nback to Volos because we didn\u2019t have a house there. The factory was not working. Here again,\ngood friends came to the rescue. We -- I think in about a week my parents were able to rent an\napartment in Athens, and friends lent us furniture, like folding cots, and folding tables, and\nfolding chairs, and mattresses. I slept on a mattress. I remember there was only one bed where\nmy grandmother, when she came from her hiding place, slept. Everybody else slept in cots, or on\na mattress on the floor. And we were reunited with my grandmother, my Aunt Julia, and\nRaymond my -- my cousin. But his father was taken to Bergen-Belsen, so he wasn\u2019t with them.\nHe eventually returned to Greece.",
        "Q: Now where -- where was he take -- I mean, where was he when he was captured?",
        "A: He was hiding someplace in Athens, I\u2019m not quite sure where. But he was a Spanish citizen,\nso he had a sort of better treatment, as they called -- you know, the Spanish citizens were treated\ndifferently, the Jewish Spanish -- he was Sephardic -- were treated in a -- a little lenier way, let\u2019s\nsay, were taken to Bergen-Belsen.",
        "Q: Now, that\u2019s interesting to me, so w -- you mean, the Sephardic Jews who were rounded up,\ngenerally were treated differently?",
        "A: Only the ones who were Spanish citizens. If they were Greek citizens, no. Because Spain was\ntrying to negotiate with the Germans to get the citizens back, or to have a better treatment, and\nsomehow they were able to, up to a certain extent, not really, but they were a little more lenient.",
        "Q: So he was taken to Bergen-Belsen, wa -- wa -- what -- what did you ultimate -- ultimately\nlearn? Ha -- was it -- it -- of his experiences?",
        "A: Well, he didn\u2019t talk much about his experiences there, other than he\u2019d say it was a horrible\ntime. I actually don\u2019t know his experiences there, but I thought he was a much sadder man than I\nknew him. He was quite a happy man before, and he wasn\u2019t -- he was very subdued, I thought,\nwhen he came back.",
        "Q: Would he have been working in -- as a -- doing sort of slave labor, or --",
        "A: Yeah, I think they did slave labor, right. But they were not cremated. I mean, they didn\u2019t go to\nthe crematorium.",
        "Q: And do you -- do you know what his relationship with his family was like afterwards? I mean,\nwas he a --",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: -- was he a man whose spirit was broken, when he returned, really?",
        "A: I think he was okay. I think he was all right with the family, yeah.",
        "Q: You would -- you were 11 when you came out of hiding. What are your memories of what it\nwas like in those next years, when you\u2019d be 11 - 12 - 13, and then tell me how you think,\nsubsequently, this period in hiding has changed you.",
        "A: Okay. We came out of hiding, and I was kind of lost. They tried to enroll me in public\nschool, which was not far from where we lived, and I think it was almost -- it must have been\nlike maybe fifth grade at the time. I should have been in fifth grade, but I skipped so much\nschool that I really didn\u2019t have the skills any more. I remember the class being huge. There must\nhave been like 70 children in that class, and I was taught a little obs -- I had no idea what they\nwere talking about, I didn\u2019t get any particular attention to -- to something. So I was very\nunhappy, and eventually, I don\u2019t know how much later, my parents put me in a private school\nwith a much smaller, you know, smaller classes, more attention from the teachers, and things like\nthat. At the time we didn\u2019t have money for private schools, and I know that my father\u2019s sister\nhelped for me to go to private school, I know that. So it was something very generous of her to\ndo. And I did like the school, it was -- the co-owners of that school were both British women,\nvery regimented, very disciplined, but basically it was a very, very good school, and it still exists\nin Greece. So once I were -- I was there then, I was able to -- to feel my way a little better.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What\u2019s the name of the school?",
        "A: Hill, H-i-I-1.",
        "Q: And I wonder if looking back, you think that you were -- in the period in hiding, living in a\nfantasy world as a protective measure? I mean, you spoke about your imagination and your\ngames. I mean it -- have you thought about this, whether -- whether the rich imaginative fantasies\nwere in fact helping to shield your -- your spirit, or your psyche from what was going on?",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sure about that. I think there was a lot of anxiety I felt, because I would pick up, you\nknow, what the adults, and the other people around me felt. And although I didn\u2019t show it, I was\nalways a very private person as a child, and some of it was encouraged because I wasn\u2019t\nsupposed to be saying things to others. I mean, to my family I was supposed to say, but --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nPaulette Nehama. This is tape number three, side A. You were talking about the concern that you\nwould give the game away, blurting something out as a child.",
        "A: Yes, I think that was the fear. And I think that\u2019s why my parents weren\u2019t telling me too many\nthings, let alone that they felt I was too young to -- to be burdened, and worry about things like\nthat. But I did worry. I mean, I was a very sensitive child, so I could feel the moods of\neverybody. I mean, I could see my father -- I would enter that part of the room that he -- my\nparents had in the second house, where it was divided by a screen, and he would smoke\nconstantly. I mean, the room was so cloudy, it was hard to see him, because it was one cigarette\nafter the other. And that worried me. Not that I knew that cigarettes were not good for you, but\nhis -- his mood, his pensive mood, the heaviness was there.",
        "Q: What do you think that the impact of -- of that was on you, developmental -- I -- I ask this\nquestion just because I\u2019ve heard discussion of it. Sometimes childhood is robbed. You were\nforced to be adult too soon. Or sometimes I think other survivors have said that it\u2019s -- that\nthey\u2019ve remained a child longer, and been slowed in their normal maturation, because they were\nbearing these burdens.",
        "A: I think that was more of the case with me. I think even after we were liberated, we were very\nburdened because we had no money, we had lost the factory at the time. We had no furniture. So\nwe had to start life from the beginning, to pick up the pieces. And I think my parents were very\nconcerned that they were -- they didn\u2019t want -- I don\u2019t know about my sister, but they didn\u2019t\nwant me to be unhappy, and to have a bad childhood. Here we had everything, and they had\nplanned for everything, and here comes Hitler, and you know, he turns your life upside down. So\nI think they tried to shelter me, maybe a little too much, but I think I didn\u2019t grow up as fast as I\nthought I would have liked to.",
        "Q: And you spoke about schooling, but as -- as you -- as your teens went on, what would be --\nhow did schooling progress, and other things? Would there be -- would there be any extra\ncurricular things, or were times too hard to have piano lessons, and art lessons and so on?",
        "A: Okay. Schools progress normally except I had a great difficulty in school. Part of it was I\ndidn\u2019t have the skills to study, or I couldn\u2019t even do arithmetic. Things that you learn in third\ngrade, I had skipped second, third, and fourth grade, basically. Because also, during the Italian\nwar, school was a [indecipherable] you know, whenever. It was -- so it was very hard for me. I\ndidn\u2019t know the basics, let\u2019s put it this way. But I got up. But I always had this feeling that I was\nlagging, I was behind. And this was a very uncomfortable feeling for me. I was ashamed of it,\nthat I didn\u2019t know as much as the other children knew. My greatest extra-curricular activity was\njoining the Girl Scouts. You see, I always loved the Brownies when we were in Volos, as I said\nbefore, but as soon as Metaxess, who was a dictator, Fascist, decided that the Girl Scout\nmovement, and the Boy Scout movement had to cease and all children should joined Apon,\nwhich was the youth organization. But Jews were not included, so I could not participate. So I\nalways felt so hurt, because of that. And after the -- after the liberation, and when things started\nfalling into place slowly, my goal was to become a Girl Scout. I was dying to. We didn\u2019t know\nany troops, any Girl Scout troops, how do you go about it. But I made sure I found out where the\nheadquarters were, and I wrote a letter to the region officers there, a wonderful woman, by the\nname of Mrs. Sareefee, and I told her that I was a Brownie when I was little, and now I\u2019m out of\nhiding, and I want to become a Girl Scout. And she wrote back and -- a very warm letter that I\nread, and read, and knew by heart, because that was the letter I had under my pillow. Every night\nI read it. And she told me that troop number 21 is not far from where I live, and my mother could\nget me there, and they used to meet on Saturdays again. And sure enough my mother took me,\nand she met the leaders, wonderful women. And it was from then on I was -- my life was nothing\nbut the Girl Scouts. It was the most wonderful experience for me to be with this group.",
        "Q: Now why do you think that is? I mean, did it, perhaps, address your strengths?",
        "A: Well, it addressed my strengths, it also addressed my need to -- to be included, to be with\nchildren, to be with other people, to be doing interesting things. To be going on outings, like\nexcursions, to do service work. And I was very, very welcome. To this day, I go to Greece, and I\nsee friends that I made in my Girl Scout years. I meet them there. They write to me. In fact, they\nsend me a yearbook lately. Every February -- 22\u2122 of February, it\u2019s considered the day of\nthinking, they call it Thinking Day. It was the day that the re -- the Baden Powell, and his wife\nOlivia, when they formed Girl Scouts, they would correspond with other people, and they had set\nthis day as the Girl Scout day, thinking of each other. So it somehow kept it, and many of these\nfriends gather in somebody\u2019s house, and they always send me a card, and they sign their name\nthat they remember me. And I think it\u2019s a wonderful feeling, to -- to know that these years were\nso important. I later became a -- a Girl Scout leader. I was pretty good at it. I was leader taking\nGirl Scouts camping in service areas that we called -- Greece had earthquakes, and the senior\nGirl Scouts, above -- above age sic -- 17, I think, or 18, would go and help the village, and the\npeople after the earthquakes, and I was the leader there. So they were wonderful years. I just love\nthem.",
        "Q: So the Girl Scouts was really a saving --",
        "A: It was a [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- thing in your life. What about your sister, and when you came out of hiding, how would she\nresume her education? Or -- or did she feel she\u2019d finished it at that time, cause she was --",
        "A: Well, she had finished high school before that, so she didn\u2019t go to -- to higher education. She\nmay have helped my hu -- my father at times with secretarial work, or something like this, but\nno, she didn\u2019t go any higher education.",
        "Q: Was she a good student in school?",
        "A: My sister? She -- yeah, I think she was, but except she -- she had too many interests, so\nsometimes she would be very naughty, as the principal said. You know, she -- she likes boys,\nand she liked other things to do. You know. But basically I think she graduated all right.\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: Yeah, so she got into -- into trouble?",
        "A: Yeah, at times, yeah. But then I left the Hill School, and I went to the American college,\nwhich 1s a high school in Greece. It\u2019s a very good school, extremely good school, and it was -- it\nwas very hard for me, because I entered in the seventh grade. I had to pass exams, and -- to be\nadmitted. And it has been an extremely wonderful experience being in that school. Very strict\nschool. Academically very high standards. That\u2019s where I learned English. I had wonderful\nteachers, that they were not only teachers, but very caring for the children. And I still see them\nwhen I go to Greece. They\u2019re in their 90\u2019s. One of them died last year, and she was 103, and I\nused to go and visit her. And this gives me also a routine of what was I like then, because I left,\nand I came to a country that nobody knew me, other than my husband, who didn\u2019t even know me\nthat well, after a week\u2019s flir -- you know, courtship. So it gives me such a good feeling to be\nrooted again, talking to my teachers, talking to my old friends, the people who knew me. They\nknew who I was, and what I was, and how I was. It\u2019s a very good feeling.",
        "Q: Now, how old were you when you met Isaac, your husband?",
        "A: 24.",
        "Q: So a lot of time went by from the period we\u2019re speaking about until the time --",
        "A: I met him.",
        "Q: -- when you met him. But so tell me what went on in those years. You continued with your\neducation, were you then working?",
        "A: No, what I did, I finished high school, and then I went to a school of social work in -- which\nwas part of the American college, it\u2019s called Pierce College. And it was what they used to call\napple division. So there were three schools, school -- school of commerce, social work, and\nliterature, so -- so I chose the school of social work. Before that I had become a volunteer Red\nCross nurse, and I used to -- I mean, I had six months training, and then I had to be at the\nhospital for two months every year, taking different shifts, and I enjoyed being a nurse, volunteer\nnurse, but it was great. So -- I keep on jumping -- so after I became a social worker, I worked --\nat the time I was doing academic work, I also had field placements in different places. One was\nin a community place with refugees, the other was in a -- in an adoption center. It was a place\ncalled Mittera, and there were primarily children from unwed mothers, and many of their\nchildren were being adopted [indecipherable] with American families, or other families. So I was\nthe social worker trainee. And that -- that was a great place, I liked that place a lot. I tried to\nconvince my parents to adopt a baby from there, but it didn\u2019t work. And after that, you had to\npass exams again, because all social workers were employed basically by the ministry of social\nwelfare. So there were a lot of people who were welfare workers, and were going to villages,\ndistributing welfare checks, and taking care of these type of things. There were social workers\nwho were working in a hospital, sort -- other kind of agencies, there were no private agencies\nthat would hire social workers. So I worked in a -- in a hospital at the beginning at the children\u2019s\nhospital, and later in a public hospital as a discharge social worker, discharging people, and\nmaking arrangements for them. And then I met Isaac. Oh, before I met Isaac I also belonged to a\nlittle Jewish club. It was a Jewish youth club where I met Sam. Sam is Isaac\u2019s brother. And we\nbecame very good friends, both with Sam and his then fianc\u00e9e, Evelyn. And we were a group of\nabout, you know, we were groups, several groups. We used to go on excursions, or places,\ndifferent -- to the movies together, but we moved in the group. So I was dating at the time a\nyoung man, who was part of that Jewish club, and this was a nice time. I think the adults were\nvery pleased that we had this club, and I think partially they financed it, because they wanted all\nthe young people to meet other Jewish people. And in some cases it worked very well, because\nquite a few of these people married, you know, other women, men, that belonged to this club,\nand that\u2019s how they met.",
        "Q: Now, who did Sam marry?",
        "A: Sam married Evelyn Maraka.",
        "Q: Who he met in this group?",
        "A: Yeah. Actually, I knew Evelyn from my school. She went to the same school I did, to\nAmerican college, but she was in one or two classes younger than I was. So I knew who she was,\nyeah.",
        "Q: And then when they married, that was when you met Isaac?",
        "A: Right. Isaac -- Isaac had come to -- from the united -- he lived in the United States, and he\nhad come to Greece for Sam\u2019s wedding. And that\u2019s where I met him, the first time actually I lay\neyes -- eyes on him, it was at the wedding, and I didn\u2019t particularly think he was attractive, or -- I\ndidn\u2019t particularly was impressed with him, just by looking at him. But then I think a couple of\ndays later, my sister had some friends over, and this friend of hers said, \u201cWe cannot come,\nbecause we have a guest, my cousin from the United States is here, so I cannot come to dinner.\u201d\nAnd Yola said, \u201cBring him over,\u201d you know, \u201cit will be fine.\u201d So I was invited, and my parents\nwere invited also, to Yola\u2019s, but my parents were not feeling well, so they didn\u2019t go, so I went.\nAnd that\u2019s where I met him, and I said, \u201cWell, he is kind of interesting guy.\u201d\u201d You know. And\nthings moved very fast from there.",
        "Q: Well tell -- tell me the story, a -- a -- actually, in interviewing your husband, I -- I know it\nfrom --",
        "A: Ah, okay.",
        "Q: -- one perspective in the museum tape, but --",
        "A: Uh-huh. Ill be interested in hearing his version. Well, I had broken up with my boyfriend like\na week before. And I had bought two tickets for Isaac Stern, there was a recital in Athens. And I\nwas still kind of lamenting the fact that I would have to either sell the ticket or go by myself. So\nafter I met Isaac at my sister\u2019s house, and we talked about all sorts of things, and he was telling\nme about his interest in music, I thought about asking him to come, but girls didn\u2019t ask boys out\nthose days. And I wasn\u2019t sure whether I should do it or not. Anyway, I thought about it, I went to\nwork in the hospital, and I thought about it, and thought about it, and I said, \u201cWell, what\ndifference does it make?\u201d I want him to come. So I called him, and I said, \u201cListen, I have an\nextra ticket for Isaac Stern, are you interested?\u201d And he said, \u201cI -- am I interested. I would love\nto go.\u201d So that\u2019s how it happened, I met him, and we went to the theater, we listened to Isaac\nStern. During intermission Isaac tells me that he knows Isaac Stern from his college years, where\nhe was directing the concerts at the University of Illinois, and he would like to go and talk to\nhim. So he left me there, and he went backstage. And of course, when he came back, I asked him\nif he remembered him. Yes, he remembered him, I think. Anyway, we went out after the concert,\nwe had coffee, we had ice cream, whatever. And then the next day, either he called me, or I\ncalled him, and I think it was very shortly after, I think I saw him for the whole week. He said to\nme, \u201cDo you know, in English, when somebody says I want to talk to you, do you know what it\nmeans?\u201d And I said, \u201cYeah, it means that somebody wants to talk to you.\u201d Well, he said -- so he\nwas trying to explain to me what it meant, but all of a sudden he says, \u201cI would like to ask you to\nmarry me.\u201d And I was ah, what? You know, I just couldn\u2019t believe it. But he -- he asked me, and\nI said, \u201cYes, yes, I will.\u201d Right away. I didn\u2019t even think about it. I was very attracted to him,\nand I thought he was extremely bright, he was very knowledgeable. He had a great knowledge of\nmusic, which impressed me very much. He was very handsome, and he was an interesting guy.",
        "Q: So it was a whirlwind week.",
        "A: Yes, kind of. And I -- I remember [indecipherable] a teacher that I met in the street, and she\nsaid, \u201cHow are you, what are you doing?\u201d I said, \u201cI just got engaged.\u201d She says, \u201cReally? Tell\nme about it. How long did you know the man?\u201d I said, \u201cA week.\u201d And she looked at me and said,\n\u201cYou, Paulette, this conservative person, got engaged in a week? That can be possible?\u201d It was.\nBut somehow I knew that this was the guy. But I think in retrospect, you know, if any of my\ndaughters would come and tell me they know somebody for a week, and they want to marry this\nperson and go to Australia, let\u2019s say, or someplace far away, I would think they would have to\nhave their heads examined.",
        "Q: But you were right?",
        "A: I mean, it -- 1t didn\u2019t fit my pattern, I would always think things through. I was -- in a sense\nmy teacher was right, I was conservative. I was never -- it wasn\u2019t I wasn\u2019t spontaneous, I was\nspontaneous, but I wasn\u2019t -- I wouldn\u2019t do things at the spur of the moment. And this one was\nvery incongruous with -- with my way of doing things.",
        "Q: Well, I think in affairs of the heart, perhaps one -- you know, at once.",
        "A: Yeah, I think I knew. I think I knew.",
        "Q: And when I said you were right, I didn\u2019t mean that you were right to think your daughter\u2019s\ncrazy, it -- it was just that time showed that your -- you were judging wisely your feelings.",
        "A: Yeah, I trust my feelings. I think I -- I have a good sense of what I need, and what my feelings\nare, and I think I have intuition, in a way, or maybe a feeling of what\u2019s right for me, and what\u2019s\nnot right for me. Not always, but most of the times.",
        "Q: And you had -- you had a lot in common. Looking back, do you think that was why you could\nmake a decision so quickly? Just that your -- you both had had -- had suffered in different ways\nduring the war. You had the same -- you both were Jewish.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t answer that, because I n -- first I said yes, then I heard about all the war\nstories. Although I did know some from Sam, his brother, and -- but I don\u2019t know if this was a\ndetermining factor or not at the time, because I didn\u2019t think it through. So I can\u2019t tell. But also\nthe fact that he was Sam\u2019s brother kind of gave me a feeling that, well, you know, I make this\ndecision -- this decision, but he can\u2019t be that bad, I mean, I know his brother. And maybe my\nparents felt that way, too, because they knew Sam. Sam worked with my father at the Jewish\nCentral Committee. And he had high respect for Sam, and Sam for my father. So, I mean, he\nprobably thought, who is this guy who is gonna take my daughter to America, you know, to the\nUnited States? But I think there was some kind of a feeling that he is a solid guy, and I think that\nhelped.",
        "Q: What was the reaction of Sam and Evelyn, and your parents?",
        "A: When we got engaged, Sam and Evelyn were on their honeymoon, so they didn\u2019t know about\nit until they came back. They had just been married. And they were thrilled. They were very\nhappy, very happy.",
        "Q: And you -- in a sense you\u2019ve already explained that your parents knew Sam, and therefore --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- blessed your plans.",
        "A: Oh yes. I think they were -- they were happy. And you know, after talking to him, my mother\nfound him very charming. My father found him extremely knowledgeable. It was the time of the\nSputnik, and my father was so interested about that Sputnik, but knew nothing about what was\ngoing on. And, I mean, the fact that somebody could explain it to him in such wonderful ways,\nwas very impressive. So I think he was very taken with that.",
        "Q: And then, how did you make plans?",
        "A: Okay. A-Also let me tell you that since we got engaged, I would receive huge bouquets of\nflower every single day, to the point that we had no place to put them, because you know -- and\nthere was always a note from Isaac, you know, with every delivery of flowers. And that was very\nnice. So to get back to your question, when did we make plans. I think it was understood that I\nwould come to United States. At that time, I was applying for a scholarship to come to the\nUnited States to study. And I had applied to Barnard College, and I forget what else. But I had a\ncouple of colleges. And Isaac told me that if I come as a student, I cannot stay in the United\nStates. So we went to the American consulate to get some advice, and they told us that indeed, I\ncould not -- I could get the scholarship, but I -- even -- I couldn\u2019t get married in the United States\nand remain in the United States. The Greek visa was oversubscribed. So I think 1t was something\nlike 10 years of waiting, or something like that, which didn\u2019t thrill me. And one of the\nsuggestions was that maybe I can go to Canada, and get married in Canada, and then for Isaac to\napply for me to come from Canada to the United States as a spouse. Because Canada had no --\nno quota. So we thought about it, and thought about it, a-and we thought it might be a good idea.\nMy -- there was a family that we knew who had gone to Montreal. This was my brother-in-law\u2019s\n-- Yola\u2019s husband\u2019s cousin. And they had moved from Athens to Montreal like maybe two years\nbefore that. So Freddie, my brother-in-law, wrote to them and told them the situation, and asked\nthem if I could stay with them while all the paperwork was being done. And they said they\nwould be very glad to have me there. So that\u2019s what happened. A friend my sister\u2019s, who was\nworking for HIAS, the Hebrew Immigration Society, said to me, \u201cYou know we are going to\nspeed things up for you. Why don\u2019t you get your police report, your health records, and\neverything else you need, and we\u2019|l send them to the consulate in Montreal. So after you marry,\nthe -- all your -- all that your husband has to do,\u201d-- [indecipherable], \u201call that your husband has\nto do is to -- to apply for you to come to United States, and this will save you a lot of paperwork\nover there.\u201d I said fine. So I did all this preliminary work, and Linda sent everything to Montreal.\nSo I left in April of \u201958 for Montreal. It was -- didn\u2019t hit me until I was on the plane, and I said to\nmyself, where am I going, all by myself, to somebody I don\u2019t really know. I just wanted the\nplane to come back. But the plane kept going. And eventually I re -- I reached Montreal, my\nfriends were there to greet me at the airport. And this was a family that they had two children, a\nsix year old, and a baby. And I shared a room with the six year old, and also the mother -- his\nmother lived with them, in a small apartment in Montreal. So Isaac came I think the next\nweekend, or two weekends later to see me.",
        "Q: How long was it since you\u2019d seen Isaac in Athens?",
        "A: Oh, it was -- let\u2019s see, we got engaged in September 57 --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: -- a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette\nNehama. This is tape number three, side B. You were telling me about being reunited with Isaac.",
        "A: Yeah, so we went to the airport to pick him up, the family and I. And I couldn\u2019t wait in the\nwaiting room, I was so anxious to see the -- see him. So I went outside, you know. Apparently\nwhen the plane landed, you had to walk outside into the -- into the terminal. So I see him\ncoming, and I was freezing there, it was so windy, and so cold, but I was waiting there to see\nhim. And he was wonderful. It was really wonderful.",
        "Q: Removed all your doubts.",
        "A: Yes, yes, it was -- it was nice.",
        "Q: And then you planned to marry in Canada, shortly after that?",
        "A: Yes. Isaac was married before, for a short period of time. And we had to -- to go to Toronto\nfor him to sign some papers for the final decree, which we did. And I think shortly after that he\ndis -- his divorce papers came through. And we went again to Toronto, and we got married by a\nJustice of Peace. I was all dressed up, not in a wedding gown, but in a very fancy, elegant dress\nthat\u2019s -- my parents made me at a very great attag -- couturier, as we used to call it, in Athens.\nAnd the question was, do I wear a hat, or do I not wear a hat. And Isaac said, \u201cIf you wear a hat,\nI\u2019m not going to marry you.\u201d So he doesn\u2019t like hats, or he didn\u2019t like me wearing a hat. So I\nthought well, okay. So we were just the two of us, there was nobody, and you had to have\nwitnesses for the wedding. So we -- they told us that we can go out 1n the waiting room and ask\ntwo people to come inside and become our witnesses, or go to Eton, we -- which the department\nstore across the street, and [indecipherable] everybody will come, you\u2019re two young people in\nlove, you know, people love stories like this. Anyway, at the waiting room there was another\ncouple. It was an older couple -- I mean, older, I would think probably in their 50\u2019s. And they\nwere going to get married also. So we made an agreement, we would sign -- we would be\nwitnesses at their wedding, and they would be the witnesses in our wedding. And that\u2019s what\nhappened. I had to repeat in English, and my English wasn\u2019t that good at the time, you know,\nthat\u2019s -- I do marry him, and take care of him, for better or worse. And that was it. At the time --\nthe more I think about that now, the more I think how I missed my family not being there, and\nnot having anybody. And many times I go to weddings, and I cry my heart out. And I wanted my\ndaughters to have nice weddings, with lots of people, and friends, and family. Because I feel that\nI just -- was a big loss for me not to have anybody. But on the other hand, at the time, I -- all I\nwanted was to get married to Isaac. And to me, that was because there were a few obstacles, as I\nsaid, to -- to bypass the immigration laws, to -- to come -- I mean to -- for him to get the divorce\npapers, and all this kind of stuff. So these were like little setbacks that kept me wondering would\nI ever be able to marry this man. And that\u2019s all I wanted at the time, but there was some feeling\nof not having the people that mattered most in something so important in my life.",
        "Q: And the waiting in Toronto with the family would not be easy, I assume.",
        "A: Well, okay -- well, so we got married, then we went to Niagara Falls, this was our\nhoneymoon. And -- okay, so we went for our honeymoon to Niagara Falls, we stayed about a\nweek, and then Isaac returned to the United States, and I returned to Montreal. I wasn\u2019t happy at\nall. The family I lived with, as I told you, had two children, so in order for me to be busy and\nthink less of Isaac, Sonia gave me full care of the baby. He was about six or seven months old,\nlittle Eddie. So she would say to me, \u201cYou need to practice, you take care of him.\u201d And I would\nsay, \u201cWell, P\u2019ve never take care of a baby, what do I do?\u201d She said, \u201cYou\u2019ll find out. Just don\u2019t\nlet him fall.\u201d And I was taking care of him completely. I would take him for walks, I would take\nhim out. We\u2019d play together. It was wonderful to -- to have a little baby there. Anyway,\nmeantime -- it takes a long time -- Isaac applied for me to come to the United States as a spouse.\nAnd at some point he said to me, \u201cYou know, you have to go to the consulate and tell them that -\n- find out why is it taking so long.\u201d Well, it was taking longer than we thought, and eventually I\nwent to the HIAS office, to the Hebrew Immigration Society, and saw a social worker there, who\ngot interested in the whole thing, and she made several attempts to find out what was going on,\nand I think eventually what happened is Isaac had applied for me to come to the United States by\nthe name of Nehama, as his spouse. The papers that were sent from Greece, by HIAS were under\nthe name Moudzoukos. So the two things were never put together, Moudzoukos and Nehama\nwere two different persons for them. So they never figured it out. It was only after desperation\nthat Isaac went to his congressman in New Jersey where he lived, and talked to him, and the next\nday I get a phone call from this social worker, and she said, \u201cGuess what? You\u2019re going\ntomorrow. We have everything ready for you, the visa is ready, come to the office.\u201d And of\ncourse, it was wonderful, because it had become to be a big, big problem, you know, six months\n-- it was six months it took for me being by myself there -- I mean, it wasn\u2019t by myself, but still,\nI was very anxious to start my life, and for Isaac to be in the United States. So, in November,\nfirst day 1t snowed in Canada when I was there, I said good-bye to my friends, and boarded a\nplane, and came here, in New York, and of course, Isaac was a -- waiting, and he already had\nrented a house in Lake Hiawatha, which at this time I couldn\u2019t even say the word Hiawatha. And\nI would think, my God, if I get lost, how am I gonna say where I live? I mean, this is not the\nplace to take me. You should take me someplace where I can pronounce, or I can even say it. So\nit was -- the house was all taken care of. I mean, he had arranged it, and fixed it, and he had a lot\nof his furniture there, but decorated very nicely, painted it, just took good care of things. And\nthen it was, how do I live here, and what do I do, and it was a bit hard. It was lonely, because I\ndidn\u2019t know anybody, although I met two good friends of his, and their wives were marvelous.\nThey would come and pick me up and take me to lunch, or take me places, and they tried very\nhard to -- to make me feel comfortable. But a couple of months later, I -- oh no, I started going to\nNew York, I would take the bus from New Jersey and go to New York in the day time, and\nstarted going to the museums, and just getting a feel of the city, and I loved it. And one day, I\nthink Isaac had gone to San Francisco on business, I was looking in the newspaper, and I saw\nthat there was a position open for a social worker that -- to deal with adoptions. So I called, and\nmade an appointment, and took the bus, and went to -- and indeed, it was the International Social\nService in New York, that was looking for a social worker, take care of Greek adoptions. I knew\nall the social workers in the International Social Service in Greece -- I no -- in Athens. I knew\nthem very well. And to me this was like a glove that fitted perfectly well. So I told them I was\ninterested in the job, they said they thought I would be perfect for the job, but they have to\ncommunicate with the people in Athens, and get references from there, and everything else,\nwhich they did, and then they called me, and they said, \u201cMy goodness, I mean we never heard\nanything as good as this. When can you start?\u201d So I got the job, and I had to commute, of course,\nevery day from New Jersey. It would take me like an hour almost, on the bus. And it was very\nexciting, I was very excite -- I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, but it was very exciting. And I\nliked the people work there, very well, very much. Then I got pregnant with Sarah, and\ncommuting wasn\u2019t the best thing for me. I had the threatening miscarriage, and the doctor said to\nme, \u201cWell, all I can tell you is, what you want, the baby or the wor -- the job?\u201d So I decided I\nwanted the baby, and that meant I had to stop working. There was no other way to get to New\nYork early in the morning, so I stopped working. And I was sad about that, because I just felt I\nhad reached the point where now I\u2019m able to -- to live in the United States, to work, to become\npart of it. So it was a bit sad. But of course, having a baby was wonderful.",
        "Q: You had done your training.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, I have done my training with Eddie, and I went to his 25\" birthday, in Canada.",
        "Q: Oh, and when was that?",
        "A: In the 70\u2019s, I forget. Well, \u00b057 or \u201958 plus -- \u201878 -- about \u201978, I think? Something like that.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah. We had gone for a visit to Canada with the childr -- two of the children, Sarah was in\ncollege, and it was Maya and Nicole that came, and Isaac and I, we drove all the way up there, it\nwas his 25\" birthday. It was nice.",
        "Q: By the way, would you have had any photos of you in that couturier wedding gown?",
        "A: No, because the most horrible thing happened. I had my camera, and I asked people to take\npictures of us because we were going to send them to Greece, you know, here are the\nnewlyweds. And something happened to the film, and no picture came out. Absolutely no\npicture. It was devastating not only to me, but also to my parents, who were saying, \u201cSend us\nwedding pictures, where are the wedding pictures?\u201d So I don\u2019t have a single photo of that.",
        "Q: So you have lots of photos of Sarah as a baby.",
        "A: I have photos of all the kids, yes. Sarah as a baby, I used to send them to my parents. When\nSarah was six months old, I took her to Greece, and that was great. It was -- because I can now\nunderstand how my parents felt, of me being so far away, and not being able to see me, help me.\nHere I go through pregnancy, a baby -- a brand new baby. If you were -- if I were to live in\nGreece, you know, they would be with me, or helping me in every step. And here I was totally,\ntotally, totally alone. And it must have been extremely difficult for my mother, especially. My\nfather too, I\u2019m sure. You know, the United States wasn\u2019t just available that much those days,\ntickets were extremely expensive, telephone calls were extremely expensive. So this is not like\nthe kind of thing you do now, like I call my sister every week. But st -- you know, he -- it\u2019s not a\nmajor expense, but those days it was.",
        "Q: What was happening in your sister\u2019s life, at the time when you came to the United States?",
        "A: Well, my sister was married and had a son, he was -- Maurice was about 10 at the time. Then\nin \u201973, her husband died. And she hasn\u2019t remarried since.",
        "Q: So your parents, just at the time when you had left, they would be seeing a lot of your sister?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, they saw a lot of my sister. And they lived nearby -- near each other, so you\nknow, they would see each other, yes. Then there were financial difficulties, the factory wasn\u2019t\ngoing well. My father started another factory in Athens, which was in -- in yarn. Factory\nproduced yarn, not material -- not cashmere any more, in order to supply Volos, the Volos\nfactory. But that didn\u2019t go very well, and there were really financial problems, and constant\nproblems with the bank, and the creditors, and this and that. So eventually -- his health was bad,\nhe was diabetic. His health became bad, and financial conditions had changed, and so he lost the\nfactory again. So that was very hard for them.",
        "Q: They needed -- they needed you with Sarah in your arms.",
        "A: Right. And I think the fact that, you know, we had to leave again -- we stayed a couple of\nmonths in Athens with Sarah -- was probably harder for them, because now they had experienced\ntheir grandchild, and was taken away from them again, you know.",
        "Q: Now how did you choose Sarah\u2019s names -- is that how you pronounce it?",
        "A: Sarah. I used to say Sarah, and when Sarah went to the fir -- to first grade, she came home and\nshe -- I -- I said to her, \u201cSarah, wash your hands, we\u2019re going to have lunch.\u201d And she said, \u201cMy\nname is not Sarah, it\u2019s Sarah.\u201d So she had become Americanized. And -- so Sarah is named after\nIsaac\u2019s mother, who perished in Auschwitz. Maya, her second name is Thalia, which is my\nmother\u2019s name, who also died, not in the Holocaust. And Nicole middle name is Julie, after\nJulius Hoffman, Dr. Julius Hoffman, who is the psychiatrist who delivered her at home, in my\nhome, because she came too fast. So everybody has meaningful name.",
        "Q: I guess -- w-we haven\u2019t even -- we haven\u2019t even talked about Maya and her birth. Perhaps\nyou should give the full names and dates of birth of all three of your daughters.",
        "A: Sure. Sarah was born in New Jersey, on January 28\", 1960. When she was almost a year old,\nwe moved to California, to Santa Monica. And then in \u201962, the end of \u201962, we moved back to\nWashington. Actually, we moved to Washington, and remained in Washington since then. Maya\nwas born in Washington in -- on September 17\", 1963. And Nicole was born on May 14\", 1966,\nat home, before I had time to go to the hospital. And that was a big commotion.",
        "Q: Yeah, you should -- you should tell the story.",
        "A: Tell the story. Well, it was a Saturday, thank God, so Isaac was home. Now, my neighbors\nhad told me that if I go to labor, I would call them, and they would take care of the older girls. So\nwhen I woke up in the morning, the water broke, and I found out I -- I had contractions, so I-I\ntimed them, and they were about 10 minutes apart. So I woke Isaac up, and said to him, you\nknow, \u201cTake care of the kids. Just give them breakfast or whatever, and I\u2019ll go take a shower.\u201d\nActually, I did call my doctor, and told him that I was in labor. And he said, \u201cOh, 10 minutes,\nokay. When the contractions are,\u201d -- this was like early in the morning, like eight o\u2019clock, or\nmaybe earlier. \u201cWhen the contractions are about five minutes apart, come to the hospital.\u201d And I\nthought, five minutes apart, that\u2019s a little too -- too close, but I didn\u2019t say anything, he was the\ndoctor. So I went to the bathroom to take a shower, and I had some very strong contractions, so I\nsaid, I better lie down. I don\u2019t think I should take a shower. So I lay down, and then things\nstarted happening very, very fast. I mean, there were no five minute contractions between the 10\nminutes. And I\u2019m feeling the baby is coming, and you know, what can I do? I can\u2019t make it to\nthe bathroom, I can\u2019t -- so I called Isaac, and I said to him, \u201cThrow me a towel, I\u2019m having a\nbaby.\u201d So Isaac took the towel -- I had taken a shower at ni -- the night before, and threw me the\ntowel -- gave me the towel, and he was in a total panic. So he looks out of the window, and he\nsees my neighbor and good friend, and psychiatrist, Dr. Julius Hoffman walking his dog, and\nreading his paper. So he opens the door, and he calls Dr. Hoffman, and he said, \u201cJules, Jules,\nPaulette is having a baby, what do I do?\u201d So he run to his house, which was next door, left the\ndog, came in -- I don\u2019t know if he washed his hands, but came in and the moment he came in, the\nbaby was halfway out. So he delivered the baby, and he told me it was a girl. I heard her cry\nonce. And Isaac called an ambulance -- oh no, he called the doctor, the doctor said, \u201cMy\ngoodness,\u201d you know, \u201cwhen did that happen? Bring her to the hospital. Call an -- an ambulance\nand bring to the hospital immediately, I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d So meantime, when Dr. Hoffman\ntook his dog back, he told his wife, \u201cPaulette is having a baby.\u201d So she was alerted, and she\ncame. And I had called another neighbor, who had told me she would take care of the girls, and\nwhen I said to her, you know, \u201cI-I\u2019m in labor, and I\u2019Il go to the hospital, do you think you can\ntake care of Sarah and Maya?\u201d She said, \u201cSure, but how close are you, because I can hear you\nbreathing very hard.\u201d I said, \u201cOh, I -- you have plenty of time.\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019m giving my\nchildren breakfast, do I have time?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, you do, come afterwards.\u201d Well, she was here\nvery fast, because she said she had a feeling she couldn\u2019t wait for the children to have breakfast.\nSo the two women are here, and Dr. Hoffman, and the ambulance came. The -- of course, you\nknow, they check the baby, and me. They put me on the ambulance. And as we are going out the\ndoor, all of a sudden I said, \u201cWhat happened to Sarah and Maya? Tell them to come here and see\ntheir new sister.\u201d Isaac had forgotten about them. He shoved them in her room, and she -- he said\nto him, \u201cStay there, and don\u2019t move.\u201d So when he opened the door to see the two, to tell them to\ncome out, both of them were huddled one next to the other, sucking their thumbs, poor things. I\nmean, they were -- so m -- I asked to see them, so they came as I was going out the door on the\nstretcher. I told them I was fine, and they looked at the baby. And I told them that my neighbors,\nMrs. Hoffman, and Mrs. Grossman\u2019s going to take care of them. Daddy would be back, I\u2019d be\nback in a couple of days, and I'll talk to them on the phone. So off we go, an -- in the ambulance,\nand I don\u2019t hear the baby crying, so I think she\u2019s dead. I was very worried. So I kept telling Dr.\nHoffman, \u201cI can\u2019t hear the baby cry.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou want me to pinch her? She will cry.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cNo, don\u2019t do that, but is she alive, or is she not?\u201d \u201cYes, she\u2019s alive, she\u2019s breathing all\nright.\u201d So I go to the hospital, the doctor meets me right there at the entrance, he takes me down\n[indecipherable] emergency room. He checks me out, he says, \u201cMrs. Nehama, you are 1n perfect\nhealth. It\u2019s Mr. Nehama who needs to be hospitalized.\u201d Isaac was in the ambulance with Dr.\nHoffman, and he was holding the baby, wrapped in a yellow sha -- the yellow towel. We have\nthat towel, I gave it to Nicole. But then I couldn\u2019t see the baby, because they put her in isolation,\nin the intensive care, just to check her out. And I thought she was dead. So I keep asking,\n\u201cWhere 1s my baby, where is the baby?\u201d They said, \u201cShe is fine, she is fine.\u201d I said, \u201cI want to\nsee the baby. I want to get up to see the baby.\u201d They wouldn\u2019t let me get up, although I was fine.\nWell, finally in the afternoon they let me get up, and I went by the nursery and there\u2019s a woman\nwho is sitting there -- standing there in front of the big window, and she said to me, \u201cDid you\nhave a baby today?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, how about you?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cI had it at home.\u201d I said, \u201cI\ndid, too. Have you seen your baby?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I think my baby\u2019s over there.\u201d And\nthen I looked, and the nurse brought Nicole, or I pointed, and she brought her, you know, from\nthe window, and somebod -- then in the evening I had her, and she came to the room, they\nbrought her. But it was a little worrisome, not being able to see her. So those days you stayed in\nthe hospital about five days. So everything went well, thank God she was fine. Last day of\ndischarge the doctor got us, all the women, all his patients were about to be discharged, and he\ngives them instructions what to do, and what not to do. So he introduces every single woman\naround this -- around the room, and he said, \u201cAnd this is Mrs. Nehama, who sneezed and had her\nbaby on Saturday.\u201d He used to call me the do-it-yourself girl. He was funny. But then I heard all\nsorts of stories. I was at the grocery store one day, and I wrote a check, and the cashier said to\nme, \u201cThank you, Mrs. Nehama.\u201d And the woman behind me, she said, \u201cAre you Mrs. Nehama?\u201d\u2019\nI looked at her, I didn\u2019t know her. I said yes. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re the woman who scared my\nhusband to death.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know your husband, who is he?\u201d Well, she says, \u201cYou don\u2019t\nknow him, but you scared him to death.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d She said, \u201cDi -- didn\u2019t you\nhave your baby at home?\u201d I said yeah. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen you had the baby, I was seven\nmonths pregnant, and my husband wouldn\u2019t let me get out of the house for two months. He\nwould call me every half hour. He was so scared I would have the baby in the house. You\nchanged my life.\u201d So, there were funny things.",
        "Q: It sounds like a -- it\u2019s a great story, and it\u2019s just a wonderfully happy time.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Because it really shows the story that by then you had built a life here, and a community, and\na family.",
        "A: That\u2019s true, that\u2019s true. I mean, life wasn\u2019t easy. It was lonely, for the most part. It was hard. I\nhad missed my folks, you know, a family, although there was continuous communication, letters,\nand gifts, and all sorts of things sent back and forth. It was still not here, so everything I had to\ndo as a person, and as a wife, and as a mother, I had to figure it out, and do it myself.",
        "Q: In -- in sort of creating -- composing a life for yourself, what do you think was the hardest?",
        "A: Loneliness. Just having to do everything by myself. But also, knowing that I could manage it,\nI could struggle, but I could do it, and that\u2019s rewarding to know, that I have succeeded in doing\nthat. I mean, I went to school here, I went -- I got my Master\u2019s degree, I got a job. I got a job in\nNew York, as I was starting in International Social Service, when I was barely here, in the\nUnited States, so I -- you know, nobody shown me what to do, or how to do it, I -- I just had the\nmotivation to -- to do it. I was very lucky, because I think many times things fell on my lap, like\nthis job at the International Social Service, it fitted me like a glove. It was very familiar territory\nfor me, working with adoptive cases from Greece.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nPaulette Nehama. This is tape number four, side A. We\u2019re talking about the challenges you\novercame.",
        "A: Right. There were many, many challenges. But I wanted to have a full life, and I wanted my\nchildren to have a full life. And I was constantly trying to fi -- find ways to -- to learn. I\u2019m also in\na great profession, that I can go into seminars -- I\u2019m a social worker, I have a Master\u2019s degree,\nand, you know, go into seminars and talking about different issues, it was great -- great for me,\nbecause I could s -- find out, and work on things that were concerning me in many ways. So --",
        "Q: Now, Isaac would have been very engrossed in his work, which was fascinating work, but it\nwould mean he\u2019d have less time to be supportive.",
        "A: That is true. He also traveled a lot during the years he worked for the Apollo project. He was\ntraveling practically three days out of the five. So that was fine, it was a very intense program for\nhim, very exciting problem for him, but there wasn\u2019t -- and there wasn\u2019t that much time available\nfor -- for doing things, although he did try to help. Later on he would drive Nicole to piano\nlessons, or things like that. But I think I was doing most of -- of the work in the house, and the\nresponsibility with children.",
        "Q: Did you set out with clear ideas of how you wanted the children, the girls to be brought up?",
        "A: You never have a clear ideas when you are not a mother. So you go with the flow. I wanted\nmy children to be whole people, not to be one sided, just geniuses, and educated, and scholars,\nbut lacking in human -- human affairs, let\u2019s say, and compassion, and things like that. So I\nwanted them to be capable, responsible for themselves, autonomous. At the time they were\nsupposed to be autonomous. And to have connections, not to be alone, because I was so alone, I\nthink.",
        "Q: What about wanting to give them some religious upbringing? Was that important to you,\ngoing to synagogue, and teaching them about their faith?",
        "A: I was conflicted at the time. You see, when I came out of the Holocaust, I was sort of afraid to\nbe identified as Jewish, and to -- for people to think that I was Jewish, I wasn\u2019t sure how it would\nplay, so out of my own anxiety, I didn\u2019t really pursue for them to go -- for us to be members of a\nsynagogue, or to be identified with Jewish causes at the time. Now I regret that. I hoped -- o-or I\nwished that things were different, and my attitude would have been different. And -- but it\u2019s a\nlittle too late, I mean, for me anyway, to teach them. But certainly they did get some religious\nthings from -- celebrating the holidays here, the high holidays, and things like that. On high\nholidays we would go to the synagogue. But I don\u2019t think 1t was enough, I really don\u2019t. But I had\nareal fear at the time, of being identified a Jew, although I knew it was almost like being a\nkryptal Jew, because I would never deny that I was Jewish, or -- or I was married to a Jew, but\nthere was a lot of anxiety about that, until I finally realized the Nazis are gone, you know, you\nhave nothing to be afraid of at this point.",
        "Q: Can you think of any anecdote that explains that? Th-That illustrates your concern?",
        "A: Yeah, my daughter Maya was a swimmer, and she used to belong to the swimming team --\nswim team of the Jewish social -- I\u2019m sorry, Jewish Community Center in Rockville, in\nMaryland. So she used to practice on a regular basis, and also they had races, like they had\nevents, they would go to other Jewish centers for -- to compete. So every time there was a race,\nthe -- they would get a badge, and it was be sewn in the back of their jacket, or their sleeves, or t\n-- Maya had quite a few things on her jacket, and she was very proud of it, and I was very proud\nof her, because she was a good swimmer. And I remember once, after I had sewn a badge on her\n-- most of these badges would say Jewish Federation, or Jewish this, or Jewish that. They had the\nStar of David. So they were definitely very Jewish badges. She was going to go out with a friend\nto the mall to buy a present for another friend who had a birthday. So the mother of the other\nfriend was going to drive them there, and pick them up. And it was a cool day, and Maya is\nready to go, the car is waiting in my driveway, and she\u2019s wearing this jacket. And I said to her,\n\u201cMaya, you cannot wear this jacket.\u201d It was full of badges. And she said, \u201cWhy? It\u2019s cold out.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cNo, Maya, you have to put a different jacket.\u201d And I literally sta -- stood in front of the\ndoor, because I wanted her to go change her jacket. My feeling was that how can she go to a\npublic place, and be seen as being a Jew? I had this feeling that she would be lynched, that\npeople will say horrible things, that people will do harm to her. And that was unbearable to me,\nthat my child will be hurt because she was Jewish. But basically, what that was saying 1s, I was\nJewish, and I was hurt because of that, when I was a kid. So that was very difficult. Of course,\nonce I realized what I was doing, I let her go. But she could not understand it at the time. I\nexplained to her later, when she came back. But I remember s -- having this fear. I actually saw\nher being hurt. And that was unbearable.",
        "Q: Had you experienced any anti-Semitism that led up to that? Or -- I -- I understand that may --\nessentially it was a scar from your wartime experience, but I wondered if you\u2019d experienced any\nanti-Semitism in the United States?",
        "A: In the United States, no. I have not. In Greece, when I was in school, sometimes kids would\ntell me I crucified Christ, and I didn\u2019t have a recollection of doing that. So, I -- I would tell my\nmother that that\u2019s what they told me, and she -- she would say, \u201cWell, don\u2019t listen to people like\nthat,\u201d you know, \u201cpeople will say bad things about Jewish people, but it\u2019s not true.\u201d No,\nbasically I didn\u2019t, but it was primarily of what I\u2019ve heard, what I\u2019ve read, that had caused me to -\n- to think in those terms.",
        "Q: And when you were responsible for bringing your daughters up, did you talk a lot about your\nown wartime experiences, going in hiding and so on, or did you feel it was hard to discuss such\nthings?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t talk much about it. I -- it was hard for me. It was much, much later that became\ncomfortable talking about it. It was something I -- I knew had to happen, but I had to move on.\nAnd there were so many painful situations that I didn\u2019t think I wanted to tell my children when\nthey were young. Course, now they are older, so it\u2019s a different story. But when I think about my\ngrandchildren, I think, you know, how at the age of six or seven or eight, they can hear these\nstories. Of course, you have to modify -- fy them a little bit. I was talking with my grandson\nMax, who 1s six, and he was coming here because Isaac was being honored by the Holocaust\nMuseum to light a candle. One of the six candles for Day of Remembrance at the rotunda at the\nU.S. capital, on je -- what was it? April 30\", 2003. So Max and his mother came. The others\nwere too young, the other little boys. And Ian and Maya came. And I was asking Max why is he\nhere, what -- what he\u2019s going to see or hear, or why did he come. And he said to me, \u201cWell,\nbecause I know that Grandpa was with the partisans, and he had a gun, and he fought the Nazis,\nand I know that you were hiding in an attic.\u201d Now how did he get the attic I\u2019m not sure, but --\nbecause I was never in an attic. I was in small rooms, but not in an attic. \u201cAnd -- and some\npeople really hid you, and you couldn\u2019t go out, you couldn\u2019t go to school, and that must have\nbeen real nice.\u201d He really liked the fact I didn\u2019t go to school. So, I mean he 1s six, so -- I mean,\nhe could absorb some of it.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Now, I\u2019m guessing that you\u2019re much more sensitive than -- than many others to any kind of\nprejudice or injustice. D -- when you came, do you re -- do you have memories of thinking about\nthe racial situation in this country?",
        "A: [indecipherable] even when I was in Greece, I would read things, and I like poems that were\nwritten by ba -- black people. One of the poems was, but I am black, but oh my heart 1s white.\nAnd a -- I was always fascinated by -- by that, how people put such values on people they don\u2019t\nknow, or put such -- they\u2019re so prejudiced about things they don\u2019t know. And people are people,\nyou know. They\u2019re just good people, and bad people, and not so good people. But it has nothing\nto do with color, or religion, or the shape of your eyes, or your skin color, or your hair color, or\nanything else.",
        "Q: Did you become an American?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And did you have a naturalization --",
        "A: Yes, yes. I became an American because I wanted to vote in the elections of -- when was it.\nHe was Goldberg -- who was it? Humphrey, I think.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Right?",
        "Q: Hubert Humphrey.",
        "A: Hubert Humphrey, I wanted to vote for Hubert Humphrey. Yes, I did. And Sarah came to the\nceremony.",
        "Q: Was that very moving? What were your feelings?",
        "A: I had mixed feelings, I must say, because part of the oath is that it tells you you have to\nabandon your country, and I still felt very Greek. So I wasn\u2019t quite ready to abandon my country,\nbut I did not -- I did want to become an American. So, for awhile I struggled with that, and s --\nonce, Isaac -- somebody -- we were at the gathering, and somebody said to me, \u201cPaulette, where\nis home?\u201d And I said -- without even thinking, I said Greece. And Isaac looked at me, and he\nsaid, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you. Greece is home? You live here. You\u2019ve been living here for 20 odd\nyears.\u201d And it was -- it was strange for me that he would get angry with me for feeling that way.\nBut I think it was the fact that, you know, I had lived there, I had made connections there. I spent\nmy childhood there. Now that I have grandchildren however, and I have roots here, I feel\ndifferently. I feel now I belong here. And it\u2019s strange, but I still love Greece.",
        "Q: Do y -- it\u2019s not possible to be a dual national?",
        "A: I suppose it is, 1f you don\u2019t serve in the army, or something like this. But I don\u2019t see, you\nknow, what\u2019s the purpose.",
        "Q: Besides, my question was cause I wondered if you found it deeply moving to become an\nAmerican, and in fact, tell me what that means to you now, now that you have grandsons, and\nroots.",
        "A: Oh, I think it\u2019s wonderful. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s a wonderful country. I think the freedoms you find in\nthis country, you don\u2019t find them anywhere in the world. The fact that the place is so diverse also\nis -- to me, it\u2019s very interesting, and very nice. But it\u2019s mostly the personal freedom, of being\nable to say you\u2019re Jewish for instance, you know, which sometimes I couldn\u2019t say it in Greece,\nalthough there were no people to hurt me, you know, this kind of thing. Or to do things.\nSometimes we take this freedom a little too far, I think, but there\u2019s no other country, I think,\nthat\u2019s -- freedom is the most wonderful thing to have, and you can find it here. Also there\u2019s\nanother thing. You have opportunities in this country, and if you are willing to work hard, you\ncan do things. Like for instance, I went to get my Master\u2019s degree when I was 49 years old. And\nI remember discussing this with a friend, and I said, \u201cWell, you know, I have grown-up children,\nthey\u2019Il be going to college pretty soon. I\u2019m 49. I don\u2019t know if I can manage to -- to go get a\nMaster\u2019s degree, and he said -- she said to me, \u201cPaulette, if you want to get a Master\u2019s degree, go\nget a Master\u2019s degree. You\u2019re going to be 49 whether you get it or not.\u201d And I never forgot that.\nAnd I thought, if I lived in Greece, and I was 49, there wouldn\u2019t have been a place for me to go\nand get a degree, even if I wanted to. Even when I was talking to my friends in Greece, and I\nwould tell them I\u2019m going to college to get a Master\u2019s degree, they would think I was sort of\nwell, maybe she\u2019s a little cuckoo at this late age, you know. And to me this was wonderful.",
        "Q: Where did you go to get it?",
        "A: I went to Catholic University in Washington.",
        "Q: Now, when it was the time of your daughters to decide on careers, and pursue sort of\nadvanced education, what do you think they gained from you? You -- you know, even in going\nback to school at 49, you were something of a role model, I would think.",
        "A: Yeah, I\u2019m sure that that was important in their lives, you know. Actually, Maya and I\ngraduated the same year. It was funny to have graduations within a couple of weeks apart. You\nknow, I\u2019m going to school, my mother is -- is studying for exams, I can\u2019t talk to you now. Yeah,\nI think it was a role model, but I think they were -- they would have gone to school anyway,\nbecause they were motivated, all of them, and they wanted to go to college, and have a career. So\nI don\u2019t think it was the only model they had.",
        "Q: Were you ever affected by the feminist movement?",
        "A: Yes. I was affected by the feminist movement, but this is a traditional household, so a lot of\nthe things that were going on were not totally, totally accepted. I wanted my daughters to be\nwomen who could decide for themselves, who would have a voice, whether it was in a job, in a\nmarriage, or in wherever. I wanted them to be treated equally with men, not to be discriminated\nupon. I wanted more for them than I wanted for me from the women\u2019s movement. And I think\nthey are pretty much with it.",
        "Q: Do you think they see themselves as children of survivors?",
        "A: I know Nicole thinks so, and probably the others do too. There were times that this was\ndifficult for them, because I remember when there were occasions that -- for instance, holidays\nwere difficult in this family, because holidays is something that you have everybody around, and\nnot everybody was around. So it was always a feeling of loss, not necessarily, you know, a\njoyous holiday. Things are mixed bags, often. So I remember once, one of my daughters said,\nbecause I was trying to explain that, you know, both Isaac and I had difficult life, and she said,\n\u201cOh Mom, I\u2019m so tired of -- of that. Let\u2019s have the holiday and enjoy it,\u201d or whatever, you know,\nlike okay, you had it, but why about us? So I think she was -- I -- I forget which daughter it was,\nbut I think, you know, to a certain degree they tolerated the difficulties, because they were part of\nthe [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t know that they\u2019re -- I think Nicole is more closer to that than the\nothers. Sarah is too. Well yeah, I think she is. She knows the difficulties up to a certain point, but\nthen she chooses not to linger on those things.",
        "Q: Why do you think Nicole is more affected?",
        "A: Well, I think she stayed in this house longer, probably. She is married to a Jewish person. She\nhas children, and -- boys, and she wants them to be Bar Mitzvahed, and for them to know about\nour lives, a lot. And maybe the fact that she went to a Jewish camp, day camp, may have had\nsomething to do. So, who knows?",
        "Q: When you spoke of that holidays being difficult, not everyone was here, course your family\nwas not here because of the -- you separated fro-from -- by, you know, vast distances.",
        "A: Ocean.",
        "Q: And of course, Isaac lost his -- his mother, so their -- a grandmother had died at Auschwitz,\nand their uncle Nehama. Is that what you\u2019re thinking of, the -- the actual, you know, family\nmembers lost?",
        "A: Yes. Mostly family members. But you see, in the past, when there was a holiday, all the\nfamily members will gather around, s-some relatives would come. So it was a Bible kind of\nthing. This time, I mean, you go through the motions sometimes, but you feel the lack of these\npeople. And Passover is a difficult time. Isaac often reads the Haggadah from his father\u2019s\nHaggadah, which is in Ladeeno. Has both Hebrew, Ladeeno, and Greek. So he reads passages\nthat he remembers his father read on Passover. And every time he reads them, you know, I get a\nchill in my back. It just -- just, you know, brings tears to my eyes. And I remember my father\nreading -- not Ladeeno, but you know, presiding over the Seder, and I know the last time I saw\nhim it was Passover, because he was sick, and I had gone to Greece, I had taken Nicole with me,\nwho was about three. Sh -- he had not seen her -- grandchild. So I took her with me. And he was\nquite sick, but he sat at the Seder. And I knew it was the last time I would see him. He died\nshortly after. He died in October of 1970. And -- but his [indecipherable] he -- he was dress up,\nhe put his clean, nice, press shirt. You know, he was very presentable. And [indecipherable] and\nmy sister was there, her husband, and Maurice, my nephew. So you miss these people, who were\nmuch a part of your life.",
        "Q: And the essence of those holidays, I guess your daughters are right, is the -- the family\ngathering.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: And your -- and it\u2019s not there. I interviewed someone called Susie Schwartz, and she spoke of\nthe -- her wish that there\u2019d -- were another grou -- term for survivor, just because she -- she felt\nthat she had been in hiding in a farm building in Holland, and her problem was simply with the\nfact that the -- the common stereotype, or presumption is that survivors survived Auschwitz,\nwhen in fact there are many different --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- shades and grades of suffering, and so on.",
        "A: That is true. I mean, for a long time, I did not consider myself a survivor. I consider myself\nthat I lived through the war. And the Holocaust, and the hiding was part of the war. I remember I\nattended a workshop once in one of the conferences. It was the American [indecipherable]\nPsychiatric Association to which I belonged. And there was something on -- about survivors of\nthe Holocaust, and I attended that, and the first thing I said is, can we make a distinction, who is\na survivor? Because they were talking -- I mean, it was very blurred to me, who 1s a survivor,\nand who is not? So they said everybody who survived both the camps, and the war, and the\nhidden children, everybody was -- they lumped them all together. And to that day, I never\nthought I was a survivor.",
        "Q: But you think differently now?",
        "A: Yes Ido. Yes, I do.",
        "Q: And it may be that with -- I don\u2019t know whether you have any thoughts about how -- when\nyou have reflected more. You may feel differently.",
        "A: Well, you see, the word survivor implies to a certain degree that you were a victim. And I\ndon\u2019t like to feel victimized, but I was victimized, and so was my family, and Isaac\u2019s family, and\na lot of other people. So it\u2019s not an approp -- an inappropriate word to use. But I don\u2019t like the\nlabel of being victimized, because that kind of sets you in a mold, and in a pattern, that\nsometimes you can\u2019t come out of it, and I don\u2019t want that to happen. In other words, I survived, I\nmade it, I\u2019m healthy, both physically and mentally. And here I am. Ill be 70 years old in\nSeptember. It\u2019s not a small achievement, I think.",
        "Q: And you have a wonderful family.",
        "A: Yeah, got a great family.",
        "Q: But -- but what are the special -- out of your experiences, what would you have other\nAmericans learn from what you have seen and experienced?",
        "A: Well, I like people to -- to know that things like that can happen if we let governments,\ndictators, crazy people, do all sorts of things, and we do not do something about it. That\u2019s -- we -\n- the world belongs to everybody, and people are responsible for the world, and I think that we\nhave a responsibility to -- to speak out, and not to let things happen, and to do our part. I don\u2019t\nknow, maybe that\u2019s a little -- but I do feel that, you know, I mean I want my friends to know that\nmy life was different from theirs in many ways, and I think the ones who do know, respect it\nvery much.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "Q: -- of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama. This is\ntape number four, side B. I\u2019m jumping to a new question, do you think that you were much more\nprotective of your daughters because of your own experiences? I mean, you mentioned that one\nincident with -- with the jacket, but I wondered if you were more fearful in -- in other ways, and\nin general?",
        "A: I probably was, and I was aware of it. So I tried not to inflict this on my daughters, because I\ndidn\u2019t want them to become fearful people. And -- but I did have a lot of anxiety about it, their\nsafety, a lot of it. I just wanted to make sure that they were just okay. Well, more than okay,\nactually. So, I remember Maya had got a new job, a summer job in one of the ice cream stores. I\nthink it was called Swensen. It was in Bethesda, an ice cream parlor, so she was a waitress there.\nAnd she would come -- I mean, the -- the job -- the store closed at 12, they had to clean up, and I\nguess she would come home one or 1:30. And I remember saying that I didn\u2019t feel this was time\nfor a young girl, driving by herself. And Isaac, who is very reasonable at times, tries to put\nreason to everything, tried to convince me that, you know, it didn\u2019t make any difference whether\nshe came home at 12 or at 10, or at nine, because, he said, \u201cShe\u2019s going to be in the car. What\ndifference does it make what time she comes home?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, what if she has a flat\ntire? Where is she gonna find help at 12 o\u2019clock at night? You don\u2019t know what can happen.\u201d\nBut he said, \u201cThat can happen at nine o\u2019clock as well.\u201d You know, this kind of thing.",
        "Q: Now, were you -- were you mostly in agreement about disciplining the girls, and other child\nrearing practices, or did you have strong disagreements?",
        "A: We had some disagreements. Isaac was very strict, I was more lenient. And that created some\ndifficulty there. But it all turned out good, finally.",
        "Q: It takes awhile before you -- you can see, I\u2019m sure.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Now, one thing we didn\u2019t talk about was the family in Greece that sheltered you, provided a\nhaven, and your maintaining ties with them, the Pavellas.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: How closely have you kept in touch, and did that go on constantly, or has there been a -- a\nreunion and a visit in recent times?",
        "A: Well, for awhile after the war, we saw them periodically, like a couple of times a year, maybe\nmore. Then we saw them less often, I think, because they moved. And then I came to the United\nStates, so I had no idea where they were, and there was no other contact. But I did find out\nthrough a friend with whom I was talking about the Holocaust one day when I was first in\nGreece, and I -- I gave her the -- I told her -- she asked me where did I hide, and with whom, so I\ntold her the family was Pavella. And that was about it. Then the next day I get a call from this\nfriend. She said to me, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you yesterday, but you\u2019re going to receive a\ntelephone call from Many Pavella.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d She said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you\nyesterday, because I wasn\u2019t sure it was her, but I know the woman. We work together.\u201d And she\napparently called her, and ask her if they were hiding a family by the name of Moudzoukos. And\nshe said, \u201cYes, we were hiding them.\u201d And she said, \u201cDo you remember Paulette?\u201d And she said,\n\u201cPaulette, Paulette? No, that was Paulexani.\u201d That was my name, my false name. And anyway,\nshe was very excited that I was in Greece, and wanted to talk to me, and see me. But my friend,\nyou see, didn\u2019t want to disappoint me if this didn\u2019t pan out, if -- you know, it wasn\u2019t the same\nperson. And so the next day I got a call from Many, who was just ecstatic, she was very happy.\nShe wanted to see me, and she wants me to go to the house. Unfortunately she was leaving for --\nshe was going to be out of the country, and by the time she would have returned, I was leaving\nfor the United States. But we kept in touch by corresponding, I sent her pictures. And then the\nnext year I went to Greece, my sister and I went to visit her. We got in touch with them, and we\nvisited them. And then in \u201997, I believe, or \u201998, Many came to the United States. She apparently\nstudied in the United States, and I had no idea she was in this country, she went to Purdue\nUniversity, and I had no idea where she was. And anyway, she was being honored by Purdue, so\nthen she decided to make a tour around the United States, and see some of her friends, and when\nshe found out we lived in Washington, of course I insisted that she comes and stays with us. So\nshe came and stayed for a few days. And it was wonderful. We remembered all the past stories,\nand you know, our parents and everything else.",
        "Q: Do they -- did you learn new stories from them?",
        "A: Actually, not too many new stories. What I wanted to know from her is what it was like for\nthem to hide us, and what it meant to them. And that\u2019s what I got mostly. But she was the only\none who knew we were Jewish. The children, the other two, Booly and Dimitris did not, because\nof their age. So she was worried, of course, about you know, when we left in such a hurry. And\nthey were told that we went with some relatives or something, not clear answers, you know. So\nthere were so many questions, because you wouldn\u2019t get straight answers from adults. I think at\nmy age anyway, and the younger a -- the younger children, Booly and -- and Dimitris\u2019s age.\nBecause I think people were afraid that, you know, children go to school, talk -- I mean they\nwent to school, I didn\u2019t. They talk to friends, if a friend repeats something like this to a parent,\nand the parent is suspicious, and then, you know how it goes. I mean, you had to be careful.",
        "Q: Well, children might place the families at risk in their sort of innocence of the dangers, but\nyou also suggest that for you as a child, not knowing may have heightened your anxiety.",
        "A: Yeah, absolutely. Even to this day, when I don\u2019t know something I get very anxious,\nextremely anxious. Knowing is power, you know. So I remember some years ago, I had cancer,\nand when I heard the diagnosis, it was devastating. And then when I pulled myself together, well\nthe doctor explained to me I wasn\u2019t going to die from it, I got all the information I could possibly\nget. And I couldn\u2019t stop reading books about cancer. That was all I read, because the more I got,\nthe better 1t was for me to ease my anxiety, although some of these books were telling you just\nhorror stories about all what can happen, and it may have not been my situation, but you know,\npredicting that if this is this, that\u2019s what happens. So Isaac said to me, \u201cI will forbid you reading\nanother book about cancer.\u201d He had it.",
        "Q: But in fact it was what empowered you.",
        "A: Yeah, it did. That\u2019s what helped.",
        "Q: You know, I\u2019m going back to your -- your role as a grandmother now, and your feeling that\nyou want grandchildren to know about your lives. But a -- have you thought also of what it\nseems they should know about your family\u2019s history in Volos, and the -- the contribution that\nJews made to the life of Greece over many centuries. I mean, will that be part of your -- I mean\nthere\u2019s -- would seem there\u2019s a proud heritage that was brought to a somewhat -- you know, a-\nabrupt and difficult stage.",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely. I think that children should know, because this is part of their\nheritage, as you said. And I think when people know their roots, and they know their own life,\nabout -- I mean, they know about their parents, their grandparents, and if they know further than\nthat, and about their communities, they are better -- they have roots. They have better rooting, I -\n- as they call it, which I think helps them as human beings, because they feel connected. You\nknow, they feel the connection there from way back.",
        "Q: You and Isaac had many commonalities in building a successful marriage. Did you have any\nreservations when one of your daughters married somebody who was not Jewish, and m-maybe\nhad -- you mentioned a British son-in-law. Di-did that give you cause for concern, or really -- or\nnot?",
        "A: A little bit. At the beginning I was a little concerned, but I liked the man so much, and I\nthought he was such a good s -- man for my daughter, that this should not be an obstacle, if, you\nknow, everybody was willing to cooperate in that factor. And I remember -- so they had a dual\nceremony. It was at sen -- what\u2019s it called? Saint Columbus Episcopal -- Episcopal church. But\nthere was a rabbi present, so the two, the rabbi, and the priest -- priest, right?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Both had a part of the ceremony, and I was reminding to my daughter that nobody trying to\noutdo the other. They were very equal in their thing, and it was really a wonderful thing to have\nthat, because it honored both families. And obviously David\u2019s family, you know, felt that there\nshould be an Episcopalian marriage, and we felt that 1t should be a Jewish wedding, but we\ndidn\u2019t want this thing to become a -- a problem for them. So they handled it very nicely, very\nnicely. But I remember passing that church often, and saying to myself, how would I feel when\nmy daughter gets married here? And then I decided that I had to visit the church. I had to go\ninside, and sit inside, and get the feel of it before the wedding. Because I didn\u2019t want to be\nbreaking down on the day of the wedding. And I did that a couple of times. I went and sat. And I\nbecame very comfortable. It was fine. And this is a very good marriage for them. He is a\nwonderful guy, great husband, wonderful father. So I have no reservations whatsoever. And I\nremember, 1-it was the first year they were married, and it was Christmas, and they were coming\nhere, and Maya said, \u201cCan we have a turkey?\u201d Because Christmas was always such a big thing\nfor David. You know, it was the first time he was away from his family, to a new country. I\nmean, things were difficult for him as well, and I 1mi -- immediately, you know, empathized with\nhim, because I came from a different country, and I was in a different place, no ma -- no matter\nhow much you love your spouse, it\u2019s still something you miss. And of course I made the turkey,\nand -- and he was so happy. He 1s a great guy. And my other fellow, my Mike, Nicole\u2019s husband.\nNicole\u2019s si -- Mike is Jewish. He is terrific. His parents had -- live in Evanston, in Illinois. He is\nfrom shi -- from there, too. He grew up there, went to the same school Nicole did in Wisconsin,\nUniversity of Wisconsin. He is terrific.",
        "Q: Well, we\u2019d be remiss now if we didn\u2019t mention Sarah\u2019s recent marriage.",
        "A: Sarah\u2019s, yeah. Sarah\u2019s also -- she is not married to a Jewish fellow. I\u2019m not quite sure yet\nabout this relationship. It\u2019s very recent.",
        "Q: Yes. Now, let me just finish up by asking about looking back, what do you feel are your\ngreatest sorrows, sadness?",
        "A: Now you make me cry. There was a time that was very hard for me here. Raising children,\nIsaac was working very hard, felt kind of isolated, although I did have friends. And I had missed\nGreece. I missed the blue skies, and the blue sea. And I missed my family. The great sorrow was\nmy mother\u2019s death, my father\u2019s death. And certainly, having gone through the Holocaust is a\ngreat loss, but it\u2019s also a strength that you gain as a child, or as an adult, because you went\nthrough horrible things, and you know that you can survive things. You can live through many\ndifficulties. And I\u2019m a very patient person, and persevere. But life is worth living. Life is\nwonderful. No matter what happens to you, there must be something in your life that is good\nabout your life. Life is precious.",
        "Q: And then the greatest joys?",
        "A: The greatest joys are my grandchildren. I mean, they\u2019re -- I can\u2019t tell you how wonderful it is\nto have them. And what an addition to my life and Isaac\u2019s life has been. I have to tell you about\nIan. When Maya announced that she -- Maya and David came here, and they told us they were\nexpecting a baby, I was sitting on this chair, and I jumped up to the ceiling from joy. I was so\nhappy. The next day, I was diagnosed with cancer. And it seemed to me like why now? Here I\nam in heaven. I\u2019m so happy, I\u2019m going to have a grandchild, my first one. Why am I gonna have\ncancer now? I mean, I could have had it last year, two years ago, five years ago. Why now? It\nwas just terrible. But then, after the shock, I decided that I had to lead beca -- to live because I\nwanted to see that -- that grandchild. And I wanted to see Maya go through her pregnancy and be\nthere for her. Nobody was there for me when I was pregnant, or when I had children. I wanted to\nbe there for her.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a good way to close. I want -- want to thank you.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome. I thank you, too.",
        "Q: So Ian helped you?",
        "A: So, I didn\u2019t know it was Ian. We didn\u2019t know it was going to be a boy, and it was going to be\na -- but, I was thinking of this grandchild constantly, and I wanted to be well, both for my\ndaughter, and my grandson. And I remember Isaac said something very nice. Shortly after the\ndiagnosis, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand, why is this happening now, that I\u2019m going to become a\ngrandmother? I want to live to see my grandchild.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou will live to see this\ngrandchild, and many more to come.\u201d And that was such a nice thing to say. I remember when I\nwas doing -- I was in radiation therapy, and it was very close to Maya\u2019s delivery, I would s --\nasked the rad -- the -- the doctor there, the radiologist, \u201cCan I take time off when my daughter\nhas her baby?\u201d And for the moment she thought it was an out of town daughter, so she would say\nto me, \u201cI can\u2019t let you stop radiation. It doesn\u2019t work that way. You have to be here every single\nday except the weekend. If your daughter has the baby the weekend, you\u2019re gonna be lucky.\u201d So\nfinally I told her that my daughter lived here, and I had to be there. And she said to me, \u201cWe will\nmake every effort. We will schedule you for six o\u2019clock in the morning. We will schedule you\nfor 10 o\u2019clock at night. Whatever suits you, to help you out, so you can go see your grandchild.\u201d\nBut he was born the day after I finished radiation. I think he timed it very well. I was free, I was\nhappy. I wasn\u2019t radiating anything. And it was just great, was the greatest day.",
        "Q: Your -- were telling me about returning to Greece.",
        "A: Yeah. Now I return to Greece every year. My sister lives there, and I have lots of friends, and\na nephew, and now he is a father, and about to become a second time father. So my friends date\nfrom the Girl Scout days, from high school. And I have two wonderful teachers that are probably\nin their late 80\u2019s or 90\u2019s that I see. And every time I see them, it\u2019s such a warm reception. Last\nyear I was in Greece, and they invited me to have coffee at a little coffee shop, two of them and a\n-- another good friend, who was also in the same school I was, but she was also in the Girl\nScouts with me. So actually she\u2019s the first one I call when I go to Greece. And we were talking\nabout all sorts of things, and then I said to them, \u201cHow do you remember me from my school\ndays?\u201d You know, I was 15 - 16. And it was such a warm feeling for them to talk about me, that\nthey thought I was a very sensitive child. I -- I had a lot of humanity, one of them said it. And\nthat this was very apparent. They both knew I had survived the Holocaust. Although I wasn\u2019t\nterribly good student, I was good student in some of the -- in their class I was a good student.\nOne taught -- taught history, and the other taught psychology. So I was very good in both classes.\nI wasn\u2019t good in math. So, I mean such encouragement that I was really a worthwhile person\nwhen I was there. And I kind of needed that, to hear it, that what was then, what is now. Because\nsometimes there\u2019s such a big gap between this ocean. And then the one who is a historian, she\nsent me a Christmas card, and she said how happy she was to see me in Greece, and that she\nalways remembers me with great affection. And that what she remembers is, here again, my\nhumanity, and she wishes my grandchildren have some of that, and that\u2019s the best wish she can\ngive me, which I think it\u2019s very nice.",
        "Q: This interview continues on tape number five, side A.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nPaulette Nehama, on July the eighth, 2003. This is tape number five, side A. We were talking\nabout your humanity, and I wondered to what extent do you think that was innate, or whether\nyou were -- you had a deeper understanding because of your suffering of difficulties when you\nwere in hiding.",
        "A: I think the sensitivity was there from the beginning, because I remember it was, even as a\nvery young child, I was sensitive to other people. My parents were very humane, both of them,\nso this is something I grew up with, and I saw it. But certainly, living through the Holocaust, and\nhiding, and seeing how people suffer, and deprivation that was going around, whether it was\nfood, or clothes, or lack of freedom, this thing certainly had a major role in my life.",
        "Q: Tell me the kind of -- we -- we talked about this to some extent before, but are there any\nstories or vignettes that you can share about that time after September 1943, when you went into\nhiding?",
        "A: Oh sure. One thing I remember very well is I think I told you about jumping the fence to go\nplay with the little girl next door. Another vignette at that house -- that was the second house we\nwere hiding, in Kipserly. My sister and I were sharing a room, it was actually a big room, and\nwas divided as I said, with a screen. My parents were on one side, and my sister and I on the\nother. My sister used to tell me about a boyfriend she had. She was 10 years older, so she had a\nboyfriend, and she loved him dearly, and of course, she couldn\u2019t see him. And she was telling me\nhow much she missed him, and these kind of things. So one day I saw the corner, there was a -- a\nflorist, somebody who was selling violets, actually, not a florist, he was selling violets. So I had a\nlittle bit of money my father had given me just to keep it, just to -- to make me happy. I couldn\u2019t\nuse it anyway, since I wasn\u2019t going out, but once again I went out to the corner, and bought her a\nlittle bouquet of violets and brought them to her. And to me this was something to tell her that\ndon\u2019t be so sad, you know, that here are some violets. And I remember she was very, very happy\nabout that. She wasn\u2019t happy I left the house to go and do these kind of things, but it was\nsomething I remember with great fondness. Unfortunate, she doesn\u2019t remember it now. And\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s a little sad for me. But I remember thinking, how can I -- what can I do to make\nher happy.",
        "Q: What happened to the boyfriend?",
        "A: Oh I think they got together after the -- after the war was over, but then it didn\u2019t last very\nlong. I think he had another girl or something like that. I don\u2019t know the details, I don\u2019t\nremember the details, but I don\u2019t think it lasted very long.",
        "Q: So flowers would be one of those things that -- one of the pleasures that you would not\nnormally have, but what about food during those -- that time in hiding?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t remember particularly being hungry, but I don\u2019t remember having a variety of\nfoods. Vegetables were usually the main thing, once a week maybe meats, or maybe not. Eggs\noccasionally. Lots of legumes, lots of beans and chick peas, and things like that, which were\nbasically the staple. Now after the war was over, we had coupons, and we could only buy food\nwith these coupons. We had to go to the grocery store, and depending who -- the number of\npeople in the family, they would give us a certain amount of food. Among them, a powdered\nsoup which we used to call American soup. It was powdered soup that had dry -- I mean, dry\nvegetables in there, and I remember there was barley, because I liked these little things that\nlooked like rice, but they were not rice. And you would simply add water, and boil it, and cook\nit. And this was basically her main thing for quite awhile. Then other things we ate was Spam,\nalso we could get it with a coupon, and what else? Oh, we ate potatoes instead of bread, because\nwe didn\u2019t have bread. So it was like a small potato per person, and the soup, and that was a meal.",
        "Q: And did the soup come from the United States?",
        "A: Yes, I think it did, that\u2019s why we called it American soup, yeah.",
        "Q: And were potatoes part of the Greek diet, normally?",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure. Greeks eat potatoes, lots of potatoes. But the sizes of the potatoes were small.\nYou couldn\u2019t have two potatoes if you wanted to, because there was a ration, so [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And how long did that, the coupons, the rationing last after the war?",
        "A: Well, almost immediately after the war, in December of \u201944 was the civil war started. So it\nwent on for two, three months, at least in Athens, near the villages, and up north it certainly\nlasted much longer. So for that period of time, it was -- I mean, food was scarce.",
        "Q: If we go back to hiding, are there any other stories that come to mind? Any other memories?",
        "A: The other memory which came actually a few days ago when I was driving. It was something\nin the street, something like a trash bag, or something, which I couldn\u2019t determine from -- from\nfar what it was, but there was definitely something there, I was thinking I must avoid this. I\nthought for a moment it may be an animal. It -- it reminded me that when a German was shot by\nGreeks, there would be a roundup of the neighborhood, and they would take all the men above\n60. And I remember one day we her -- heard the shots, and we couldn\u2019t determine what it was.\nBut we looked from the window, and at the intersection -- the -- the house was almost in the\nmiddle of the block, there was something in the middle of that intersection. We couldn\u2019t tell\nwhether it was a person that had been shot, and it was there, or anything else. And my sister\noffered to go and look. And I remember my terror of having her go to look, and what if she were\ncaught? If the Germans were around there, and would catch her? And to this day when I see\nsomething in the middle of the street that looks bigger than a little something, I always have this\nimage in front of me.",
        "Q: Do you remember whether it was the body of a person?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t a body, no. It was some kind of trash, I think, that has been kicked in the middle of\nthe street, of the intersection. But I mean, the agony, because we knew what was coming next.",
        "Q: And did -- did those -- w-were there often roundups of that kind because the Greeks retaliated\nagainst the Germans?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: And what -- what did you know of the behavior of the German troops in Athens towards the\nGreeks. I mean were they -- did they -- did they behave well, or were there all sorts of horrors\ncommitted by them?",
        "A: Towards the Greeks?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t see the horrors, except occasionally when I saw a German kicking an old man\noutside my window. But I knew that there were things going on. At times my parents will talk,\nand they will ti -- try to protect me, or talk somewhat in code, so I wouldn\u2019t understand, but I\ncould figure things out, and put things together, sometimes with great imagination, but\npersonally, I mean, I didn\u2019t see any other horrors, other than what I heard. But, I mean, the\nGermans, everybody was afraid of them, because they knew that from one moment to the other,\nthey would wrap things up and take people away, and off they go.",
        "Q: Were there stories that your sister would share with you, or did she protect you as your\nparents did?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I think they all protected me. I was an overprotected child. They all protected me,\nand in turn, I think I -- I was trying to -- to protect my parents and my sister by not complaining,\nnot whining, not -- not asking for things I knew I couldn\u2019t have. So I was trying to -- to be rather\nquiet about things, because I knew they were upset to begin with. I mean, I could tell.",
        "Q: What was the impact of that on you, do you think that -- in your relationship, wa-was there\nany, particularly?",
        "A: Well, I think my mother always was saying that I was -- I had a wonderful nature. But I was\nvery much -- I remember once there was the end of the war, it was right the days before that --\nthe end of the war. We were still in hiding, but the atmosphere w-was such, because everybody\nwas expecting something was going to happen. I think the news we had heard, and the man of\nthe house had come and was saying well, things are going to change in a day or two. There were\nrumors. All of a sudden we were sitting in the garden I remember, it was a -- a nice day, and Is -\n- | burst into tears, out of nothing. I mean, I started car -- crying and sobbing, and nobody could\nunderstand what happened. My mother thought a bee stung me, or you know, something\nhappened. And I just couldn\u2019t stop crying. So finally I remember the woman who was hiding us\nsaying to my mother, \u201cWhat happened to this child? I mean, she never cries.\u201d And my mother\nsaid, \u201cWell, maybe she has gone through a lot, and that\u2019s as much as she can take.\u201d So -- but I\nwas always keeping things inside, and not expressing too much. First of all, I was told not to talk\nmuch, because they didn\u2019t know to whom I was going to talk, and what I was going to say. So\nthis was instilled in me, and I understood it, that I shouldn\u2019t talk much. And this carried on, also,\npast my hiding years, because many times I remember I was always observant, but I wouldn\u2019t\ntalk much. And people would say, well is she here, is she participating, or what? So, it has\ncarried to many, many years, yeah, even now sometimes. I mean, I may be in a group of people,\nand I may have my own thoughts, but Ill be the last one to express them. If I\u2019m asked\nspecifically, I will. But I wouldn\u2019t jump in.",
        "Q: You\u2019d learned to be guarded?",
        "A: Yeah, yes I did. Yeah.",
        "Q: Now, when you were in hiding, would there be any visits from old friends, or members of the\nJewish community, or would it be very much an isolated time for your whole family?",
        "A: The only time I remember somebody coming was the second house -- in the second house.\nThe person who had found that house for us, he was a -- a former general, but he -- he was\nretired, or maybe he was not, but anyway, he used to come periodically to see us. And when the\nGermans came -- I mean, the Greek SS came to get my father, he was -- he who was -- it was my\nsister who notified him, and after they brought my father back, after he paid them handsomely,\nwe went to his house. He came and took us. Again, he didn\u2019t -- he took my father first, and then\nhe took -- I don\u2019t know if he came back for my mother, myself, and my sister, or 1f we went\nourselves, but we went and spent a couple of nights there, so he could find another house for us\nto stay. So he was the only one I remember visiting, nobody else.",
        "Q: I just wanted to make sure that we\u2019ve got the order correct here. So you -- you were -- these\nwere the moves you had, you were in one place, and then when there was a threat, and your\nidentities were at risk, you moved to the second place, and in between, you had the two weeks\nwith the elderly gentleman, and his housekeeper?",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: And it was really two main places of hiding, except --",
        "A: There was a third one.",
        "Q: Aha. Tell me about that.",
        "A: Yeah, well after the second house, when the Greek SS were watching the house, and they\nburst in one day, saying they want the people to -- to measure the -- the gas, or something like\nthat -- and got my father. They brought him back several hours later after he paid them. He had\nsome gold coins, gold pounds sewn around his waistband, and that\u2019s why they brought him back,\nbut they -- they warned us that we had to leave within an hour, or two hours at most, because\nthey couldn\u2019t guarantee anything. When my father was gone, my si -- mother and my sister\ndecided to notify this friend, this general, and my sister jumped over the terrace, to the next\nhouse, who was a -- also a family friend, a judge. He was a judge, I believe he was in the\nSupreme Court, but I\u2019m not sure. So he notified them, and from there they called this general,\nwho came to -- there was a market, a big market near the house we were staying in Kipserly, and\nhe went to that market, so he could see the house. So he was pretending to look at the eggs, and\nto make sure the eggs were okay, you know you usually look at them in the sun to see whether\nthey are rotten or not. And -- so he was pretending to look at eggs, and so he could see whether\nthere was anybody coming or going in the house. The moment he saw they brought my father 1n,\nand when he saw these guys leave, he came to the house, and he took my father to his house.\nAnd then, either he came back for us, or we went back, within -- it wasn\u2019t within walking\ndistance, but we definitely walked it. And then th -- this family found another place for us. We\nstayed with them I think two nights. There were two children there, and -- a boy and a girl, and\nthe parents.",
        "Q: Now who was it who took your father for questioning?",
        "A: The Greek SS. Greek SS.",
        "Q: And they were --",
        "A: They were working for the Germans. They were paid by the Germans. And of course, if they\nwould bring Jews, they would get paid more. So their job was to find Jews in hiding.",
        "Q: What do you know about the -- how many of them there were, and to what extent they\ncollaborated with the Germans? They obviously could be bribed.",
        "A: Yeah. They collaborated with the Germans. They -- they were not that many, but the ones that\nwere -- were -- certainly afterwards some of them were sent to prison for life. A couple of them\nwere executed. Others left the country. They couldn\u2019t survive in the country any more, having\ndone what they\u2019ve done. So --",
        "Q: Do you know what condition your father was in when he came back? Was he very shaken?",
        "A: Oh my God, he was shaken, absolutely shaken. Absolutely shaken. And of course, having\neven the money he had, you know, that left us with very little money. The -- the rest of the\nmoney was -- some other coins -- I mean, not coins, pounds, British pounds, gold, that my\nmother had sewn around her bra, and my sister had also sewn around the bra. I was too little to\nhave a bra, so they couldn\u2019t put any coins on me. Besides, they didn\u2019t trust me. So, you know.",
        "Q: So throughout that time in hiding, the whole time the other three members of the family\nalways had this money on them, hidden in their clothing.",
        "A: Right, right. Yeah, that\u2019s right. And I remember my mother sewing it so elaborate, and so\ncarefully, you know, so none of it will slip out. It was like individual little pockets for each -- for\neach pound. I still have one golden pound my father gave me years later because I was asking if\nhe could give me one I wanted for a souvenir, and I\u2019m never going to cash this. I -- I just wanted\nto keep it.",
        "Q: What about jewels? I mean, was there anything else that they sewed into their clothing, or\nindeed had with them? We talked about possessions --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- but I wonder what other valuable things --",
        "A: No. I think the jewels were either given away or put away. My mother had a diamond ring,\nwhich was her engagement ring, but she wasn\u2019t wearing it. So I don\u2019t know where she kept it.\nBut that one I know she -- she had, because she always thought she can sell it. She didn\u2019t sell it.\nThere were no other jewels.",
        "Q: Do you know what happened to these things we talked about? Some of the paintings, some of\nthe possessions like the painting that was not returned, but I mean, was jewelry or other\npossessions every reclaimed by the family?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I remember my mother had the pearl necklace which was short, but it was\nwhat women wore those days. And I have it now. And that I remember was one of her precious\nthings. My mother didn\u2019t wear an awful lot of jewelry. So maybe she gave a few things to friends\nfor safekeeping. I don\u2019t remember having safe deposit boxes those days, and things like that in\nbanks, you know. So, I -- \u2019'm not sure how much was saved.",
        "Q: Did your father talk about what had happened during that Greek SS questioning? Course, he\nmay not have shared it with -- with you.",
        "A: Yeah, I could hear again my sister and my mother talking, and also the man of the house,\nAndonis, but here again, I was sent out of the room, as usual. Story of my life. So, I could -- even\nthough -- I mean, I could hear a little bit, but I couldn\u2019t hear very clearly what happened.\nBasically they told him that they wanted money, and un -- unless they had money, they were\ngoing to bring in the -- the SS. Was as simple as that.",
        "Q: And luckily he had enough to pay them off.",
        "A: Luckily he had, yeah, he was a little hefty around the waist, so that took a few extra pounds. I\nmean golden pounds.",
        "Q: And then that day, he moved to the friends house.",
        "A: Yeah, we went to the Padzopoulus house. So -- and I\u2019m sure it was very dangerous for them.\nAnd I remember how shaken the lady, Mrs. Padzopoulus was, for us being there, for what\nhappened to us. She wasn\u2019t sure whether a -- anybody had follow us on the way. I remember the\ndinner. Obviously she hasn\u2019t planned for four more people. She had zucchini stuffed with rice,\nwhich is a common Greek dish. And she had put one zucchini per person for the two men, for\nmy father and her husband. Half a zucchini for herself and my mother, and a smaller zucchini for\nthe children, the three children and my sister. But I remember that half zucchini, with a lot of\ntomato sauce around it, in a large plate. And it was just about a bite, or maybe two bites, three\nbites at most. And that was it, there was nothing else. I mean, people didn\u2019t have a lot of stuff. So",
        "Q: And these people were all Greek Orthodox Christians --",
        "A: Greek Orth -- right.",
        "Q: This family and the judge you mentioned next door?",
        "A: Right. Yes, yes. And of course the family we were hiding with, the Viyas family, yes.",
        "Q: And then they found -- you were with them for a night or two, and then moved on to a new\nplace.",
        "A: To anew place in the -- the region of Gizzi. And there was a family, there were the parents\nand one -- one daughter. She was younger than my sister, so she must have been about 18. 17 -\n18, some like that. Very nice people, all of them. I remember the -- the mother, Mrs. Catina, she\nwas so good to me, you know, because I -- I was always the youngest, so they all thought -- were\ntreating me very nicely, all of them. So she would make something special, like maybe she\nwould make a little cookie, and give it to me, but nobody else will have it, or things like that.",
        "Q: Do you know how common it was for sheltering families to have been discovered, and their\nlives put on the line through what they were doing?",
        "A: I only heard of one family, that they had been taken to prison, but they had not been shot, or\nsomething. But I know it was something that everybody feared, because that was well known\nthat can happen. But I personally don\u2019t know of anybody other than this family.",
        "Q: What would -- what would a day be like at this stage in hiding? I mean, do you remember\nwhether anybody sort of tucked you in at night, or told you stories? How would you pass the\ndays?",
        "A: Tucked me in -- I think I would say good -- good-night to my parents. Well, by then I was\nlike 11, right? I would say good-night to my parents and give them a kiss. I always did, that was\na ritual, a good night ritual, and good morning ritual, too. It -- I think sometimes my sister will\ngive me a kiss and just make sure I was tucked in, but not always. But she would look after. Tell\nme stories, no, I don\u2019t think anybody told me stories, including my grandmother. When I was\nmuch younger, I wanted her to tell me stories, because everything I heard was that grandmothers\ntell stories to their grandchildren. And my grandmother -- my grandmother wasn\u2019t educated, she\nhad gone up to six -- to -- to fourth grade, but she was a very intelligent woman. She would say\nto me, \u201cWell in the summer you cannot tell stories, because your clothes smell. It\u2019s too hot.\u201d So\nthat didn\u2019t register very well with me, but anyway, she said it, I thought it must be true. Then in\nthe wintertime, you know, grandmothers tell stories by the fireplace. Well, 1t was too hot to be\nnear the fireplace, so she couldn\u2019t tell any stories. Things like that.",
        "Q: Would there be any observing of Jewish rituals? I just wondered if your parents at this time\nmight seek solace in rituals, or religious observances, or whether in fact they\u2019d be so frozen\nthrough anxiety, they may have been unable to do anything very much.",
        "A: Exactly. I think that was the case. They may have been praying privately, but you couldn\u2019t\nsay anything about being Jewish, anything that would just even give the slightest suspicion even\nto the people you were hiding, you know. The people that were hiding you, actually, although\nthey were kind people, and they knew you were Jewish, you couldn\u2019t do anything -- or at least\nwe. I can\u2019t say for everybody else. But the thing was that you don\u2019t do anything to -- to arise any\nsuspicion, or to make things different, so people will say oh, they are doing things differently.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nBeginning Tape Five, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nPaulette Nehama. This is tape number five, side B. Your parents also at this time, or most of this\ntime in hiding, could not speak in confidence. I mean, you were sharing quarters. They could not\neven whisper together, I assume, at night, and say how do you think Paulette is doing, or what --",
        "A: Well, I was asleep, so I couldn\u2019t hear if they did, other than the time that I could hear the\nGerman words out of my window when my head was covered with a blanket, I was -- I was\nasleep the rest of the time.",
        "Q: I was just thinking of the fact that they would really -- there\u2019d be little --",
        "A: Little privacy --",
        "Q: -- privacy for them to confide.",
        "A: Yeah, probably there was little privacy. But you know, I would go out in the yard, the\nbackyard was rather secluded, you know, there were trees around. So whether they talked then or\nnot, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Do -- have any other memories come to mind?",
        "A: Yeah, I remember the two of them, my father and mother were playing cards, they were\nplaying pinochle. I remember them both smoking so much, the room was so foggy because of all\nthat smoke. Was one cigarette after the other. Those days we didn\u2019t know much about cigarettes,\nyou know, but it certainly did something for them, because they were so anxious. My mother\ntook -- my father didn\u2019t have much to do, because the man of the house was -- you know, had\ngone to the base, he was in the Navy, as I said before. And my mother would help with the\ncooking, or she will do the cooking, the woman will do the shopping. So my mother was a little\nmore busy than my father. Now you asked me before how I would pass my day. I remember my\nmother tried to teach me how to embroid, and my mother was excellent in embroiding. She has\ndone beautiful pieces, and I have some of her pieces, which I treasure. But I just didn\u2019t have the\npatience to do that. I mean, I couldn\u2019t sit quiet, and just trying to put a little -- my needle in the\nlittle hole there, and get pleasure out of it. It was the most boring thing for me. So I wasn\u2019t\nparticularly interested. And a little bit of knitting was more to my liking. But I wasn\u2019t very good\nat that too. So these things didn\u2019t really attract me, or just, you know, give me any particular\npleasure in doing. So most of it, as I said, I had two books that I\u2019ve read, and then I got ahold of\nthis weekly mag -- I think it was either weekly or monthly children\u2019s magazine, which was\ncalled, The Development of Children. But they had some wonderful stories in there. So I read --\nsome of them were a continuation, you know, so you would wait for the next. I think, now that I\nthink about it, I think Mrs. Padzoupolus would send me this magazine -- the woman whose house\nwe went after they got my father, the general\u2019s house. Somehow her children had it, and then\nafter they would read it, they would -- I don\u2019t know how I got it, because I don\u2019t know whether\nthey mailed it, whether the man of the house would go to their house and get it, I have no idea.\nBut I know that I had it, and it was wonderful, because it was like a four page little newspaper,\nyou know, that I could read from the beginning to the bottom, and it was -- it was good. I knew\nsome of these things so much by heart.",
        "Q: You know, you would be 11, but you -- you spoke -- you have spoken often about your dolls,\nand were you still playing and fantasizing a lot with your doll or dolls?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I had a doll that her name was Ellie. It was one of these plastic dolls, but you know\nthe ones that they break, you know, lo -- those days we had these dolls, how did they call them?\nWe used to call them bone dolls, but often their legs will come off, and -- or their hands will\ncome off, and then there was a piece of elastic collecting the two. I had an uncle who used to fix\nthem beautifully for me. And this doll, she -- she didn\u2019t have hair -- I mean, her hair was like part\nof the -- of the material the doll was made, that she had like two braids on the side. And she was\nsmall, very small. And -- but my mother and my sister had made me clothes for this doll out of\nvery small pieces of things, or -- I remember a little blue jacket with a little white handkerchief,\nyou know, in the pocket. And I just loved that ra -- I loved dressing my doll, and playing with\nher. Yes, I -- my doll was -- probably saved me, it was my companion, my confidant.",
        "Q: Would this doll fit in your pocket? Was it really tiny, that small?",
        "A: No, it wouldn\u2019t fit in my pocket, maybe it was a little bigger than my pocket, but not tiny -\ntiny. However, I had this doll with me, somehow it survived. And I kept it, 1t was on my bed\nafter the -- the war was over, and I got married, I brought it to the United States, and I had it with\nme in California, and one day Sarah opened the drawer and got it, and she dropped it, and the\nhead broke, and that was the end of Ellie.",
        "Q: So th -- so that that doll was very important?",
        "A: Yes, that doll was very important. In fact, now I remember. After we left the first -- first\nhouse, and before we went to the second one, when I stayed with this older gentleman, they came\nto pick me up -- my sister came to pick me up, the couple that helped us find the second house\ngave me a doll, but I didn\u2019t like that doll at all. She was very ugly. And I remember saying thank\nyou, you know, and -- but I never played with that doll, never. I-It was -- it -- it wasn\u2019t a -- a\nbeautiful doll, you know, something that appealed to me at all.",
        "Q: Interesting.",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, here you think, you know, a child -- here I\u2019m giving a child a present, she\ndoesn\u2019t have anything, and I just didn\u2019t like that doll.",
        "Q: I wonder what was going on that you hadn\u2019t bonded with that doll.",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- she was a rag doll, and I didn\u2019t like her face. I didn\u2019t think she -- I didn\u2019t like her\nface. Who knows, I liked my little Ellie. But Sarah took care of that, my daughter Sarah.",
        "Q: Now tell me more about your sister. Maybe you should remind us of her full name, because\nwe haven\u2019t mentioned her by name for a while.",
        "A: Yola, her name was Yola.",
        "Q: What was her full name?",
        "A: Yolanda, but we call her Yola. Of course, during the occupation, she was Yanna, like Joanne.\nMy name was not Paulette, 1t was Paulexani, they used to call me Polly, or sometimes Sandy. So\neverybody had a different name, and different last name. So I got used to the Polly.",
        "Q: Would your -- your real names ever pop out, or -- or y --",
        "A: No, never, never. Once, actually, come to think of 1t, my sister and I had gone for a walk. It\nwas dusk, and as we were walking, we encountered a friend of mine with her mother, from\nVolos, who called, \u201cYola, Yola.\u201d And we -- Yola just pushed me, and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t answer,\nkeep walking.\u201d So we kept on walking as if we didn\u2019t know them, because if somebody else was\naround, you know, it would have been -- and her daughter who -- who was my friend,\nunfortunate she died, she remembers that, and 1 -- she told me, she said, \u201cAnd I told my mother,\ndon\u2019t call them, they don\u2019t want to be recognized.\u201d But it was, you know, such a -- a wonderful\nthing of seeing somebody you know, and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to these people, you\nimmediately say hey, you know?",
        "Q: And they would not be Jewish?",
        "A: No, they were not Jewish, no. But they were friends from Volos, yeah.",
        "Q: And other times it could have been such a wonderful meeting.",
        "A: Exactly. So even if you knew anybody, you didn\u2019t ne -- have these freedom to -- to greet\nthem, you know, to embrace them, to -- to recognize them, you know. You had to keep going, as\nif they were strangers. It was terrible.",
        "Q: What was life like for your sister after the end of the war, and have you talked about how\neach of you were -- I assume you do, about -- feel that your lives were affected by this\nexperience?",
        "A: Oh there\u2019s no doubt our lives have been a -- affected. Obviously they\u2019ve been affected\ndifferently. Yola was 20 at the time, I was 10. So you know, she had a better grasp of what was\ngoing on. And my parents included her, while they didn\u2019t include me, in all sorts of preparations,\nor you know, discussions, because of her age. I think when the war was over, I think Yola, who -\n- who got married in \u00b046, was -- that was shortly after the war. But still, you know, the remnants\nof the deprivation were still with us. So she -- she just wanted everything. She wanted the nice\nhouse, and lot of clothes, she -- she just felt that she didn\u2019t have those things, and she had to\nmake up al -- for all these things. So -- and I -- I yust didn\u2019t particularly care. I was a little bit of a\ntomboy. There were difference. I mean, we\u2019re different people. Our personalities are like day and\nnight. So --",
        "Q: And there -- there could be factors, and I wonder if you\u2019ve talked about the fact that you were\n-- you were younger, and you were protected, but you\u2019ve already talked earlier about your\nanxiety over what you didn\u2019t know, and your sister would have a slightly more active role,\nbecause she\u2019d be involved in the planning. And she\u2019d be protecting you, so --",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: -- she\u2019d be a caregiver to some extent.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Which, either role could be more damaging.",
        "A: That\u2019s true. I mean, she -- she definitely protected me and she treated me like her little sister,\nyou know. So I didn\u2019t have to know everything, but I think they probably thought the less I\nknow, the better off Iam. From my perspective now, if -- I mean, if any of my grandchildren\nwere involved in a situation, I would have the same concerns about telling them everything, you\nknow, I mean, at this age. Although they are much younger, they are six and seven, the older\nboys. So, you know, you\u2019re -- but I think they could have said a little more, at least from my\nperspective, to -- to calm me down. The fact that don\u2019t worry -- that you say don\u2019t worry,\neverything will be all right, will -- will be okay, wasn\u2019t enough to -- to make me stop worrying,\nbecause there was nothing concrete. The don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s a very vague kind of thing. Don\u2019t\nworry, but what if, you know, something happens, or what if that happened. The only thing,\nsurprisingly, that gave me a lot of comfort, was a plan we had to escape, particularly from the\nsecond house in -- in Kipserly. This was the house that had that fence, the one I jumped to go to\nthis little girl\u2019s house to play with. And I remember we had a plan in place that should the\nGermans come, they would certainly come from the front, or -- we could all go to the backyard\nand jump the fence, and by then we would be to the next block. So by then we could run or do\nsomething. How -- we never put that plan in effect, actually we never need it -- needed it. But it\ngave me comfort that there was something we could do, something concrete that I was involved\nin, because they -- they told me what to do, and in fact we had a little bundle of a few clothes,\nyou know, that we could take if we had time. But the thing was that we had to leave right away,\nand jump the fence, and that will take us through the yard of the next people, to the next block.\nSo --",
        "Q: Did you keep that bundle ready?",
        "A: Yeah, that bundle was ready. That bundle was ready always. Couple of changes of clothes,\nand that was it. Maybe my doll, I don\u2019t know. No, my doll wasn\u2019t in there, because I always had\nit with me, yeah.",
        "Q: And where did you keep the bundle? I mean, was it at the end of your bed?",
        "A: It was under the bed, yeah. It was under the bed.",
        "Q: Interesting.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And your sister s -- eagerly went on with life and --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: -- indulging her love of clothes as elegant as could be put together.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, she -- she 1s a beautiful woman. She always dressed very elegantly. I mean, her\nhusband was very willing, when he could, to get her the best things. So she became a very well-\ndressed lady, you know, and I think she got a lot of pleasure out of it, yeah.",
        "Q: And brought pleasure, to be fair.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: Now, when did she meet her husband, and tell me about their wedding, and I -- and -- and the\nimpact of that on family.",
        "A: I think she met him through -- through a friend. Freddy was the cousin of the friend who took\nme in when I went to Montreal. I remember when I got engaged to Isaac, I lived with a family in\nMontreal for six months, until my visa was ready for me to come to the United States. Well, Joe\nCalderone was the name. His mother and father were friends of my parents. Joe was a cousin to\nFreddy, okay? So Yola was very friendly with Joe and his wife, his current -- I mean his wife,\nand you know, they used to -- to be together in gatherings, and that\u2019s where she met Freddy. And\nthey made it in \u201946, which was still very shortly after the war, and you know, I mean, things were\nnot that well yet, you know? We were still -- had financial problems. The factory wasn\u2019t -- was\njust beginning to -- to work. But it wasn\u2019t producing what it did before the war, certainly not.\nAnd -- but yeah, everybody was very happy. When she got married she had a wedding gown, and\n-- and I was happy, and I told Freddy that I\u2019m glad that he is marrying my sister, because I can\nhave a -- a new dress for the wedding. So he always remembered that, he thought it was really\ncute.",
        "Q: The first new dress in how long, do you think?",
        "A: Oh, four years, five years, some like that. I used to get Yola\u2019s dresses, and my mother would\nhem them, but you know, there is a 10 year difference, so you can imagine the hem was like\nanother dress almost, plus she would take it in, and my dresses were always kind of loose, and\nhanging, and I never liked them.",
        "Q: That makes me think of the -- a question about how would your f -- parents dress in the time\nin hiding? Would they maintain very dignified style of dress, even though clothes would get\nshabby and well worn?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I mean, I remember my father always wearing a vest, a shirt and a vest, of course no\ntie in the house. And my mother always wore a -- a housedress, or a skirt and blouse, some like\nthat. We didn\u2019t have a lot of clothes with us, so when -- since we didn\u2019t go out, you know, we\ndidn\u2019t need to have anything. Now that we\u2019re talking about clothes, there\u2019s something else. After\nthe war was over, and I think it was after the civil war in \u201944, there was help that had come from\nthe United States, you know, in -- relief. And among them, there was what we used to call\nUNRRA, UN -- United Nations Relief Agency. And they were distributing clothes. So I needed a\ncoat, and my mother took me to get a coat. So we looked through the different bins, or thing, and\nshe came up with a brown coat that was down to my ankles, really long, and I didn\u2019t like it, but it\nwas wool, and it was warm, and she wanted me to have it, because it was winter. I cried, and\ncried and cried, because I just didn\u2019t like this coat. I wanted something else, but everything else\nwas either too small for me, or too big for me and [indecipherable]. So finally I ended up having\nthat coat, but here again, she had to hem it to make it approximately my size.",
        "Q: What -- what a contrast. I think of the -- the daughter of the head of the c-cashmere making\nfactory.",
        "A: [indecipherable] having -- having -- a friend of mine tells me a wonderful story which brings\ntears to my eyes. She was two years old when she and her parents went to a concentration camp.\nShe -- the parents were Spanish citizens, so they went to Bergen-Belsen. Now when the -- which\nwas supposedly a little better treatment than, you know, the other camps but still, was a\nconcentration camp. When the war was over, and they came out, they went to -- to France, or to\nItaly, I think, to -- to a center until they will be relocated. So -- no, to France, I think they went.\nAnd they had coupons to go buy clothes, to department stores. So her mother, and Lola\u2019s -- and\nmy friend Lola, went to a department store to get clothes. And as they were going up the stairs,\nthere was a mannequin of a child with a blue coat, and she fell in love with that little blue coat.\nSo they talked to the saleslady and they gave her the coupon, and she brought out a very dark\nlooking coat. And the little girl said, \u201cI don\u2019t like this coat, I like that blue one.\u201d And she said,\n\u201cNo, this is not for you.\u201d And she started crying. Then the manager came, and he said, \u201c\u201cWhy is\nshe crying?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause she wants that coat.\u201d \u201cNow that coat costs a lot of\nmoney. The ones we have set aside are these.\u201d\u2019 And they were the ugliest things you could think.\nI mean, dark colors for little kids, and things like that. So he said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, the little girl can\nhave the light blue coat.\u201d So he took it off the mannequin, and put it on my friend. And I thought\nit was such a moving story. And she was happy.",
        "Q: It is a wonderful story.",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, here comes humanity, you know? I mean, it\u2019s these tiny little things that make\nthe difference.",
        "Q: Now your sister -- I just wanted to get a sense of her subsequent life -- her husband died\nyoung.",
        "A: He died at the age of 60. He died in 1973, of colon cancer. He worked with my father. I think\nI told you that they tried to -- to start another factory in Athens that made yarn, because they had\nsuch difficulty bringing yarn from England, and they thought it would modify, I mean, what they\nproduced. So this factory -- I mean, he was able to -- to get some partners, and he did go for\nawhile, but then, here again, it was difficult, and hard to get materials and things like that, so the\nfactory wasn\u2019t going very well, and Freddy decided to -- to work elsewhere, which was a big\nshock for my father, because he was counting on having his help. So -- but they didn\u2019t quite\nagree on how to manage the factory, and Freddy went elsewhere. So -- but he worked with my\nfather until -- I think when I came to United States in \u201958, he was still working with my father.\nHe probably left about 1960 -- in the middle of 60\u2019s, something like that.",
        "Q: Did that remain a rift between them?",
        "A: A little bit, yeah, yeah. A little bit. It was very disappointing to my father because he thought\nthat with hard work -- you know, my father was always somebody who would come up under\nhorrible circumstances, and Freddy saw no -- no future to -- to this factory. So I don\u2019t know who\nwas right, or who was wrong. They probably both were right, from their own perspective, you\nknow? [indecipherable] cause a lot of pain.",
        "Q: How old would your mother be at the end of the war in 1945?",
        "A: She was 45 years old. She was born in 1900, yeah.",
        "Q: And tell me about -- let\u2019s talk about your mother.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: We haven\u2019t really talked about her since, except as she -- her life is sort of interwoven with --\nwith yours. We did talk about her activities and charitable involvement in Volos, before, but --",
        "A: [indecipherable] she was quite a lady, yeah.",
        "Q: -- but tell me more.",
        "A: Well, my mother was a very quiet person. She was the eldest of three daughters, Julia and\nAnna. And I think she was quiet, but she was also a little bit like me, or I was like her, you know.\nShe was very sensitive, but not very outgoing. But she had a tremendous warmth, that people\nremember her. And everybody says, even now, that she was a grand dame, like a lady, a real\nlady. There\u2019s another vignette that I have to tell you, because that describes her. Many years ago,\nYola and I went back to Volos. And we went around the place where our house was, which\ndoesn\u2019t exist any more, has become apartment buildings. And we were walking through the\nneighborhoods, it was the first time I went back to Volos since I left Volos, since I came to the\nUnited States. That was in the -- \u201974 - \u00b075 -- 1974 - \u201975, approximately then. Yola had been to\nVolos before. And I think there was a lecture also, that we wanted to go. So I was telling Yola\nthat I always remember my mother will take me to a pastry shop called the Swiss. And I always\nremember the owner there, you know, talking to me, and giving me a little piece of pastry, or a\ncookie, or something. So Yola says, \u201cWell, we\u2019re gonna go that way anyway, so let\u2019s stop.\u201d So\nwe went, the sign still says the Swiss. And we go in, and the store is the same, nothing has\nchanged, you know, it\u2019s a narrow store, you know, the -- you know, all the pastries, and all the\nbreads there, and it\u2019s a fairly young man, a young man who recognizes Yola and says, \u201cYes, I\nremember you, you were here before.\u201d He is the son of the owner. And he says, \u201cWell, my father\ncomes here every day. He is 90 years old, and he sits there.\u201d In -- in the corner is this old man,\nyou know, asleep on a chair, and with his cane. And he goes -- [indecipherable] \u201cHere is my\nsister who lives in the United States.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he says, \u201cI have to tell my father.\u201d So he goes over\nand he -- he wakes his father up, and he says, \u201cFather, you know who this is?\u201d And he says,\n\u201cThis is the Moudzoukos daughters. This is Yola, and this is Paulette.\u201d And the man -- for a\nmoment he was trying to wake up. He gets up from the chair, shaking, and he embraces me, and\nhe starts crying. He says, \u201cI remember you. I remember your mother, what a lady she was. I\nremember bringing you here.\u201d I mean, it was such a moving moment. And then in the evening\nwe went to the lecture, and this woman recognizes Yola, and then she tells me -- Yola says,\n\u201cThis 1s my sister, Paulette.\u201d Says, \u201cOh Paulette, I was thinking of you a few days before.\u201d She is\na photographer, a professional photographer. And my mother, once a year, or twice a year, she\nused to take me to the studio to take my picture. In Greece there is, before Easter there\u2019s a\ncarnival, it\u2019s the four weeks of carnival. So children have parties, and they get dressed up in all\nsorts of costumes. So every time I would have a costume, my mother would take me out to have\nmy picture. And this woman tells me that she is moving her studio from where she were, to a\nnew place, and she was going through old negatives, and she found some of the negatives of me,\nand she was wondering wha --\nEnd of Tape Five, Side B\nBeginning Tape Six, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nPaulette Nehama. This is tape number six, side A. We were talking about the photographer, and\nher photos, and -- that she\u2019d come across in Volos.",
        "A: Oh. Yeah, so she was wondering what happened to me. She knew I had gone to -- to the\nUnited States. So she said to me, \u201cI will send you the negatives, because there\u2019s -- some of them\nyou may want to have them, you know, I don\u2019t need them any more. These were from 1930-\nsomething. But I never got them because I was leaving the next day, and she didn\u2019t send them.\nSo I never got them.",
        "Q: To what extent -- I want to hear more about your mother, but to what extent have you kept in\ntouch as a family with Volos?",
        "A: We have a cousin in Volos, who 1s the president of the Jewish community there. His name is\nRaphael Freseese. And he is related -- he is third cousin, I think, or some like that. He is related\nbecause I think his grandmother was married to my grandmother\u2019s brother. I think that\u2019s the\nrelationship, and I remember his grandmother, a nice, wonderful old lady who would always\nbless me to become a bride, for her to see me a bride. Lovely woman. So, anyway, he has written\na book about the Jewish community of Volos, which he send me, and I correspond with him\noccasionally. Actually, the holidays I sent him a card, he sends me a card. I spoke to him on the\nphone a couple of times when I was in Greece. When I go to Volos I see him. I think it was in\n1975, or \u201974, there was a letter came from the Jewish community, they were going to have a 50\nyear reunion of the Jewish community of val -- of Volos, of the people who left Volos, because a\nlot went to the United States, a lot went to Israel, or other parts of Europe, or Athens. So they\nwere gathering everybody to go for this reunion, and I went with my sister. And it was -- it was\nsuch a nice thing. The first thing when you entered there, you know, they had pictures of all of\nVolos, the old Volos I remember. And there are pictures of my father, my grandfathers, the -- my\nfather and grandfather was the president, my gra -- yeah, my grandfather, his father, the president\nof the Jewish community. So there are prominent, big pictures of them, right on a panel. The\nfactory is very prominently displayed, since he was one of the biggest employers there. And then\nthe connections. You know, people remember me as a little kid. I mean, I left Volos when I was\n10. Here I\u2019m an old woman, I mean, grown up woman, you know, married with daughters of my\nown, and th-th -- there is that warmth, you know, of -- of the then, to the now. It comes through,\nit just comes through. So we had a wonderful two day affair, because then we -- the next -- they\nhad the Shabbat dinner. The women had cooked, and it was at the synagogue, it was service of\ncourse, and then the dinner. And the next day there were service Saturday morning, and then\nthey took us by bus to a place to swim, and then to have dinner, and then we went to one of the\nvillages up in Pilion. And at night there was a reception. So it was a very nice connection.",
        "Q: How diminished was that Jewish community? I mean, would it have -- would it be half the\nsize of what it was, or a third of the size?",
        "A: Oh yeah, right now there are about a hundred people all together. Yeah, hundred -- 110 at\nmost. It wasn\u2019t a very large community, but I think about 27 percent of that community perished.\nAnd then, after the war, the ones who returned, returned to practically nothing, and they -- they\nleft Volos because there was hardly anything for them left, or to do. There were not jobs, so a lot\nof them left to go to the United States, or to Israel, or to Athens. So -- but that Jewish community\nis so small, but so connected. It has excellent relationship with a larger Volos community, there\nis mutual respect. Recently there\u2019s been a memorial that has been done there, and I mean, people\nlive together very nicely.",
        "Q: More so than in Athens, do you think?",
        "A: I think so, because it\u2019s a smaller place, you know, and they know each other. There\u2019s great\nrespect for each other, yeah.",
        "Q: Did your parents -- they continued in Athens after the war?",
        "A: Yes, we continued living in Athens, but we would go to Volos in the summer, because the\nfactory was still there, and my father was, you know, working there. And in the wintertime he\nwould commute from Athens to Volos. Once when we were in Volos, one summer, he -- he got a\nheart attack, and then he wasn\u2019t able to work for awhile. And I remember Freddy came to -- to\nVolos -- my father started -- helped start a -- build a -- a small airport in Volos, because Volos\nhad no airport. So the first plane that landed was a tiny, little plane that had Freddy, and a\ncardiologist, and Yola. They came to look after my father. So it landed on -- the first plane that\nlanded in that airport, isn\u2019t that interesting? And it was tiny plane. Then a few days later, Freddy\nremained in Volos to take care of the factory, and everything, and Yola and I left to go to -- to\nAthens, because she had a child by then, she had Maurice. And I remember my first flight, you\nknow, in this tiny little plane, and the pilot is totally incompetent, and I thought he was going to\nland in a roof in Athens, or someplace, I mean, he is going that close. It was such a tiny little\nplace, I mean, I was really scared.",
        "Q: And that would have been what, 1949, or something like that?",
        "A: That was either \u201940 -- let\u2019s see, she was married \u00b046, it was probably \u201950, 1950 - \u00b051. Yeah,\nbecause her son was born 1950, yeah.",
        "Q: And your father tried to get the -- was it Leviathan-Moudzoukos factory going again --",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: But that didn\u2019t -- ultimately did not work out?",
        "A: It worked for a short period of time, but he -- the much more diminished -- wa -- first of all,\nthe machinery was all destroyed, you see, and they had to replace that, or part of that. The\nmachinery was German machinery, and it was brought from Germany before the war, so this was\nvery good machinery. It just didn\u2019t have the -- the means, the financial means, you know, to buy\nnew machinery, to get the whole thing started. It was very hard. But my father was a fighter, you\nknow, he wasn\u2019t -- a very kind man, very kind man. He couldn\u2019t stand people being hurt. He was\na very good employer, and I hear that now from people, that he was an excellent employer. He\nwas also involved in city affairs, I mean he was in the city council, he was in the Jewish\ncommunity, of course, he was -- he was a pillar of the society.",
        "Q: And now let\u2019s go back to your mother, and continue to tell me her story from the 1940\u2019s on.",
        "A: Okay, well the world was hard for her. Living in other people\u2019s houses was hard for her. My\nfather wa -- my mother was always very clean, her house was always very orderly. She had\nexcellent taste. So for her to be at somebody else\u2019s house, it was very difficult. She -- I mean, she\nhad no other choice, you know. And before we went into hiding, during the Italian occupation,\nwhen we had lived in the villages of the mountains of Pilion, here again we were renting a room,\nor two rooms from somebody else\u2019s house. So that was hard for her, too, you know, to be ina\nvillage, here is this lady who 1s -- she wasn\u2019t spoiled, I want you to know, I mean, she was -- she\nwas a woman who had a good life, but she wasn\u2019t spoiled. So, you know, these things did take\nsome toll, I think. But I think the hardest thing for her was when we lost the factory, a lot of her -\n- of friends, who at least appeared to be friends during the good times, just disappeared. And that\nshe never forgot, that was a trauma for her, that the friends that she had helped, and friends that\nshe was counting on, and has been to their house, they have been to her house, kind of discarded\nus because they were not -- they didn\u2019t have money any more, for awhile. So that really\ntraumatized her.",
        "Q: They weren\u2019t really friends.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I kept on telling her, because she used to say to me, \u201cDon\u2019t count so much on\nyour friends.\u201d And I would say, \u201cWhat? My friends are wonderful.\u201d You know, this kind of\nthing. She\u2019d say, \u201cWell, they are wonderful until things change.\u201d",
        "Q: So that she lost some of her faith in humanity?",
        "A: Exactly. I think she did. The war did that, her friends did that. And it was a constant struggle,\nyes.",
        "Q: How important was she to your father, and to his state of mind, did he count on her utterly?\nWas his mood dependent on her support? What was their relationship like?",
        "A: Yeah, I think my mother catered a lot to my father, because he -- he had diabetes, so she\nalways took good care of him. I mean, she would -- those days they used to weigh things,\nbecause you know, you have to eat a certain amount of carbohydrates, and a certain amount of\nprotein, I think. But this became her responsibility of taking care of him in this way. And she\nwould weigh everything. I remember he loved cherries, so the season of cherries would come,\nand they would count like eight cherries on the little plate, and he would say, \u201cWhat is this, eight\ncherries? Bring the bowl of cherries here.\u201d And she would freak out, say, \u201cBut these are\nweighted.\u201d You know, so it was like the joke, we weigh things and he -- he would sneak a few\nother cherries, you know, from the bowl. So yes, but he did count on her support. She was very\nsupportive of him, she was always there for him. I mean, they had a very close relationship. But\nshe begun to get depressed, and I think she had great difficulty overcoming this depression and\nslowly with every more d -- every difficulty that came along, it was harder for her to come on --\nto overcome this. So I guess she slowly started withdrawing, and withdrawing more and more.\nThen she had -- her appetite was diminished. She also had a problem with saliva, she couldn\u2019t\nproduce enough saliva to chew her food. And I don\u2019t know if this was the result of a dental\nprocedure that she had, or not, I -- I -- I\u2019m not quite clear, I don\u2019t remember, actually, at this\npoint. But she -- she had lost saliva, so she couldn\u2019t chew her food, and it was very painful. And\nshe started losing a tremendous amount of weight. Then she was put on medication and on some\nvitamins, and things like that.",
        "Q: And what ti -- at what -- what age would she be -- or what -- in what years was this taking\nplace?",
        "A: I think -- the depression, you know, was -- was -- it was there but not very prominent in the\n50\u2019s. I think towards the -- the end of the fift -- probab -- probably after I left, I think things got\nworse, because also the difficulties with the factory became much more. There were a couple of\nclients who had big orders, and they cancelled them because they had financial problems and\ncouldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t do it. So that, of course, affected our financial situation. So, I think she got\ntired, and she just didn\u2019t want to fight any more. And I left in *58, so I\u2019m sure that my leaving\nwas something, you know, difficult for her. She always hoped to be able to come and visit me,\nand see me in my new place. She wasn\u2019t able to do that, my father\u2019s heart condition and diabetes\nwere not doing too well, plus all the financial difficulties, you know, couldn\u2019t -- they couldn\u2019t\nafford the trip. It was that simple. So I think that certainly made her upset, and unhappy, in\naddition to everything else.",
        "Q: Did she see lots of -- of your sister, Yola?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. Yola was always there for her, and she used to take her to doctor, or take her\nplaces, you know, and things like that. So yeah, Yola was always there. And of course, Maurice,\nher -- her little grandson who was there, who was a great pleasure to her, yes, much.",
        "Q: I wish you\u2019d had wedding photos for her.",
        "A: I wish that too, I think she -- she was upset, and I was upset I didn\u2019t have any wedding photos.\nBut I took Sarah there when Sarah was six months old, and she just -- that was in 1960. Sarah\nwas born 1960. And she just loved her. Sarah was a very feisty baby, very, very light, very small\nbaby, but my goodness. A friend of mine who had her baby with Sarah, we put them both in a\nplaypen. She said to me, \u201cI thought my child was retarded compared to yours.\u201d Cause she was\nmoving, she was in constant move and action. And she was just great, and I think that did a lot of\ngood to her to -- to have her there. But then we left, we came back to United States, so here she\nwas left empty handed again. So that was hard for her. And she freaked out when I -- I said to\nmy mother, \u201cI\u2019m going to send a case of Gerber baby food for Sarah when I come.\u201d And she\nsaid, \u201cWhat? You\u2019re going to feed your child food from the can, or from a jar? Is that what you\ndo in the United States? We never did things like that.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, everybody here uses this\nkind of food for babies.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen you come here, we\u2019re gonna cook for the baby.\nWe\u2019re have -- I bought a meal, I\u2019m gonna mush everything.\u201d So she cooked for her, everything\nwas hand -- I me -- pur\u00e9ed, and prepared the way she knew how to do it, yeah. That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: The best.",
        "A: The best. She -- right, the best. She was a great caretaker, great caretaker. She was -- they had\nfun with Sarah. They borrowed a playpen, so we will put her in the middle of the living room,\nyou know, and we'll enjoy her just playing around. And that was great for them. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m so\nglad that she saw at least one gr-grandchild, because she died in 1962, so she had not seen Maya\nand Nicole. My father saw all three, because a year after my mother died, I went with Maya.\nMaya was a year old then. And also my grand -- my nephew was being Bar Mitzvahed, so we\nwent. So he saw them. And then when he was quite sick I took Nicole, who was about three. And\nhe saw Nicole, too. So he saw all three grandchildren. It\u2019s hard when you\u2019re that far away, yeah.\nMy mother died in 1962, and by then she was quite broken, quite depressed, quite desperate, I\nguess, so she committed suicide. Which was a terrible [indecipherable |",
        "Q: How did she -- how did she die?",
        "A: She committed suicide, she took an overdose of something called belladonna, which is -- it\u2019s\na stimulant, a heart stimulant. They don\u2019t use it any more, because it\u2019s so powerful. I was in the\nUnited States, so I learned it from the unites -- here. And I was not able to go to the funeral,\nbecause we lived in California at the time, Sarah was a baby, she was like two years old, I mean\nshe was -- I couldn\u2019t leave her with anybody. And so -- we didn\u2019t have the money also to -- you\nknow, to travel from California to Greece. So, it was -- you know, when I went back in \u201963 with\nMaya and Sarah, Sarah was three, three and a half, and Maya was one at the time, or before one.\nShe celebrated her first birthday in Greece. That was like a year and a half after my mother had\ndied. Everybody came to the airport, my sister, my father, and my aunts. Friends of mine came,\nand my friends told me later that they wanted to be there to greet me because they knew that\nsince my mother wasn\u2019t there, they didn\u2019t want me to feel the void, which I did feel the void. But\nyou see, I lived in her house -- actually it wasn\u2019t the same house that I left to come to United\nStates from, because after my mother died, and my father moved to -- to a smaller apartment\nnear my sister. So I\u2019ve never been to this apartment before, but I was still looking for her. So it\nwas like I was grieving for her, two and a half year -- one and a half years later, where everybody\nwas finally coming to terms a little bit with it. And it was a very awkward kind of situation\nbecause it -- although it wasn\u2019t the same house, this was the same furniture, the same pictures, all\nthese kinds of things. And she wasn\u2019t there, you know? It was -- it was a difficult visit, yeah.",
        "Q: Your -- your grief would be greatest and theirs was beginning to heal, I suppose, by then.",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t begin to heal like 20 years later.",
        "Q: No, I meant that the --",
        "A: Oh, the other people?",
        "Q: -- you\u2019d -- you\u2019d not been able -- such a pity you\u2019d not been able to be with them to grieve\ntogether.",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s right, yeah.",
        "Q: And then they would be coming to terms with losing your mother at that time when you went\nback and were confronting it perhaps most fully.",
        "A: Right. That\u2019s right, yeah.",
        "Q: What was going on in her life when she died? I mean, were there -- was it just a gradual\nsliding into greater depression, or was there something else that wer -- was happening that made\nher feel she didn\u2019t want to go on?",
        "A: Yeah, I think it was a gradual depression. I think -- I think that she saw no future to anything.\nYou know, I think depression -- and we are talking about clinical depression, we are not talking\nabout just having the blues, it -- if it\u2019s not addressed, that\u2019s how it -- it ends up. And those days,\nyou know, people didn\u2019t understand depression, I think they don\u2019t understand depression even\ntoday in many ways. Greece 1s not a -- a place where people, you know, understand these kind of\nthings. Certainly nobody in the family understood the enormity of it. I think she did see a doctor,\nwho maybe put her on antidepressants or something, but that was shortly before she died. So, it\nwas not a long therapy before that. You know, she just didn\u2019t have -- she had lost the -- the zest\nfor life. Everything seemed to be just enormous for her, even if I would say, well, can my friends\nstay for dinner, and this was a friend she knew, and somebody, you know, she didn\u2019t have to\nparticularly make something special, it seemed like it was too much for her. Or they had to move\nfrom one apartment to the other because the lease expired and this man was raising the price.\nAnd that was a tremendous thing for her, to -- to have to move again. To -- to pack, to organize. I\nmean, she had moved many times 1n her life, so things become enormous all of a sudden. I mean,\nthe slightest thing becomes enormous. And I think she just couldn\u2019t deal with any of that any\nmore.",
        "Q: Did she talk about her -- I mean, did she leave a note, ho -- I mean -- how do you know that\nshe committed suicide?",
        "A: She left a note -- well, first of all, you know, all these pills were missing from -- from the\nbottle, and the bottle was next to her bedside. Her -- she left a note, but it wasn\u2019t found until a\nmonth later, or something like this, which was a note left to my father and to my sister. And\nbasically she was telling my father that, you know, what are we waiting -- I mean, what does life\nhave to offer us any more? We -- our children are married, they are taken care of. You know,\nthere\u2019s nothing really to hold us here any more. And another thing she was telling Yola is to take\ncare of me, because I\u2019m her little sister, yeah.",
        "Q: So sad, depression, and --",
        "A: It is sad, yeah. I was reading her last letter to me a couple of days ago, which I received in\nCalifornia after she died. Because she died April 11\", and I think this was written like the eighth\nof April. And I was trying to di -- I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve read that letter many times, because I\u2019m trying to --\nto determine what is in this letter that I could have deciphered that she was suicidal. And there is\nnothing in that letter that -- all she says is that now she\u2019s eating a little better, she has a little\nmore appetite, that Yola takes her to the doctor, that she is glad I\u2019m not there to -- to -- to see all\nthe difficulties my father is going through -- she\u2019s still protecting me. And she talks a little bit\nabout the future, like, you know, send me a picture of Sarah or something like that, which is, you\nknow, like looking forward to something, right? Although she says in the note that there\u2019s\nnothing to look forward to. Maybe three days before she had not decided to end her life, who\nknows? But I\u2019ve read -- I\u2019ve read that letter over and over trying to -- I\u2019ve taken -- it took me a\nlong time to come to terms with this, I\u2019d say 20 years. It\u2019s a long time. And as I said, I\u2019m in a\nwonderful profession that I can have access to all sorts of material. I\u2019ve gone to s-seminars, to\nworkshops, I mean, conferences. And I always, for a long time, when I was trying to resolve this,\nI was getting into workshops that had to do with suicide, because there, you know, I mean there\nis a variety of workshops, and some of them had to do with suicide. Aftermaths of suicide,\nsurvivors of -- of people who have suicided. Professionals who survived the suicide of a client.\nYou know, all sorts of things. So, 1 -- I was almost like drunk when I was getting all this\nmaterial, which I have really read, and studied, and thought about, and worked at it. And you\nknow, 1-it\u2019s something that sticks with you. It doesn\u2019t -- it\u2019s -- because it\u2019s not a -- a natural\ndeath, it\u2019s not a death that, you know, like somebody gets old and dies. It\u2019s just horrible to deal\nwith. So --",
        "Q: How have you come to terms with it?",
        "A: I think by going to these workshops, and by -- by reading a lot. I didn\u2019t talk about it for\nalmost 20 years, so that was, I think -- then I decided that I needed to go to therapy and resolve\nit, so that\u2019s what I did. And this woman was extremely helpful. We talked a lot about my mother.\nShe asked me, because I was telling her I was --\nEnd of Tape Six, Side A\nBeginning Tape Six, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nPaulette Nehama. This is tape number six, side B. You were telling me how you found out.",
        "A: Okay. I had an aunt who lived in New York, and I think my brother-in-law called her to call\nIsaac, because they didn\u2019t know our telephone number in California. And she called Isaac at the\noffice to tell him. They didn\u2019t call me direct to tell me. So Isaac came home early, and then he\nasked me to sit down next to him, and he said, \u201cI have to tell you, Mother died.\u201d And when he\nsaid Mother died, I thought he was talking about his mother. And I\u2019m thinking, why 1s he telling\nme his mother died, she died, you know, in the Holocaust. Why now he tells me this? I know,\nand I said, \u201cI know.\u201d You know, like I was trying to figure it out. He said, \u201cNo, not my mother,\nyour mother died.\u201d But he -- he said nothing about suicide. He told me that she died, and you\nknow, it was something I just couldn\u2019t grasp, I just couldn\u2019t get in my head. So it took me a\ncouple of days to absorb it. Then I got a letter -- then I called home. And I think it was -- you\nknow, your mind gets kind of blocked in situations like this. Because I called, and it was after the\nfuneral, so I spoke to my father, and my father said, \u201cWe lost Thaliki,\u201d -- Thalia was my\nmother\u2019s name. Thaliki is like a diminutive. And he said, \u201cWe lost Thaliki,\u201d and here I\u2019m\nthinking, you lost her, why don\u2019t you look for her? You know, why don\u2019t you go find her, call\nthe police or something. I didn\u2019t tell him that, but that was the thought that went through my\nmind. So it was -- it was very differ -- difficult to be that very far away. And then my sister sent\nme a letter, I asked her to -- to tell me what happened, and she sent me her -- a long, long letter,\nwith all the details, which I brought it to therapy, and wrote it -- I mean, read it there. And that\nwas quite earthshaking and w -- and I was trying to avoid reading that in therapy, and -- because\nthe letter is in Greek, so I told my therapist I cannot do it, it\u2019s in Greece, you want -- Greek, you\ndon\u2019t understand anything. Said, \u201cThat\u2019s all right, you will translate.\u201d Which of course I did. It\nwas a very hard session, she cried, too. Yeah.",
        "Q: And the distance would be so -- so painful, I think.",
        "A: Oh, it was terrible. It was -- it was hard, because you know, I couldn\u2019t communicate other\nthan a letter that used to take 10 days to arrive. And phone was not so -- you know, nowadays\nyou can call, and it doesn\u2019t cost that much. Those days, I mean, phone calls to Greece were very\nexpensive, and I think we talked a couple of times on the phone, I spoke with my father, with\nYola. And everybody there were thinking how am I gonna cope with being alone here, and not\nhaving a support system. So that was -- then on top of that, two days later, Isaac came to\nWashington because he had an interview with Bellcom. And this was prearranged of course, and\nthat interview was important, so he left and he came here. And while he was gone, I got a call\nfrom a teacher of mine who happened to be in New York. She had no idea my mother died, but\nshe called me just to say hello, and to say how are you doing. And I\u2019m saying to her -- she\u2019s\ncalling from new -- from New York, and I\u2019m saying, you know, my mother died, and there are\ntears coming down [indecipherable] poor woman, I mean, she didn\u2019t know what to do over the\nphone. So -- but that\u2019s -- 1t was a point of connection with somebody I knew, that I could tell\nsome. Yeah.",
        "Q: Which you needed so desperately, I -- I think.",
        "A: Right, right, yeah, yeah. Right.",
        "Q: You must have thought about this a lot, but do you think there was any connection that we\ncan draw between the Holocaust and your mother\u2019s sufferings, hiding, losing almost everything,\nand her depression and death, or do you think that perhaps -- no, you tell me.",
        "A: Well, actually, I don\u2019t know, because there are a -- a lot of people who -- who went through\nthe Holocaust and did not commit suicide. So, you cannot pin it just on that. I think there are\nmany factors that go into something like this. It\u2019s not only one thing. You cannot say that it was\njust because of that, but certainly it has played -- I mean, the war and the Holocaust have played\na major part in her lowt -- outlook to life. So, you know, it\u2019s not one thing, but it definitely did\nhave something to do with it, yeah. But here again, there are lots of people who have gone\nthrough difficulties, or maybe even harder things, and still are alive. So, part of it is her make-up,\nI think. You know, there isn\u2019t a single answer. There is no single answer, and that\u2019s the hardest\nthing in dealing with that, that you can\u2019t find an answer to say, well, Pll pinpoint that this was it.\nThere isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a combination of things.",
        "Q: Now you told me about therapy when -- and -- and reading the letter from your sister telling\nyou of your mother\u2019s suicide, but what was it that helped you come to terms with it? Was it just\naccepting it?",
        "A: Yeah, sure. That it was her decision, although this is not a decision I would choose for myself,\nbecause I don\u2019t want to leave this kind of legacy to my children. But here again, I\u2019m a different\nperson, other factors go into my life, so who knows? I think time has also something to do with\nit. Education about the subject has a lot to do with it. And I really have researched the subject in\nany possible way. I once thought of running a group of people who survived the suicide of\nsomeone. And then I decided maybe I wasn\u2019t ready to do that, because 1 have to be a little more\ndetached from it, and I didn\u2019t feel I was that detached yet, when I wanted to do the group.",
        "Q: Tell me about the areas that you have focused on in your work. We really -- we\u2019ve really, in\nthese hours of interviewing, we talked about your early work in Athens, and we\u2019ve mentioned\nhere and there your social work, but we\u2019ve not addressed it in any detail. We talked about your\ninterview too, when you were -- before having your first baby, when you might have returned to\ndoing more work then, but so we -- le -- let\u2019s go back and have you pick up how you resumed\nyour career, as the girls were growing up.",
        "A: Okay. Okay, well, as I said, I worked for the International Social Service in New York for a\nshort period of time, a few months, which was a job I liked, and fitted me like a glove, it was\nperfect, because it was dealing with Greek adoptions, and people I knew from Greece I had to\ncommunicate with. Anyway, well after Sarah was born, I did not work any more. I -- and after\nthe other children were born I stayed home. I was involved in Brownies, and maybe school\nactivities and things like that. Actually I did work in the evenings, when I think Nicole was in\nkindergarten, for Garfinkels -- part time -- this was my part time job. And it was primarily\nbecause I needed to do something, and I needed to do something very part time. But I -- I could\nstart exploring other things. But I always wanted to go back to social work, because this was a\nfield that always interests me. I mean, I\u2019m interested in people, and their lives, and what makes\nthem tick, and what\u2019s -- how they conduct their lives, what\u2019s in their lives, what influence their\nlives. So, I had a Bachelor\u2019s degree from Greece, from Pierce College, which was an American\nschool. And I knew I couldn\u2019t do very much, but when Nicole went to first grade, I -- I thought\nseriously of getting a job in social work. And somebody told me about the Jewish Social Service\nin Rockville, that they were looking for a social worker at the department of aging, I think. And I\ncalled, and verified that indeed they did need somebody, asked me to send my resume, which I\ndid, and they called me back, they wanted me to go for an interview, which was terrific. Well, I\ndid go to the interview, but I went a day earlier than the interview was scheduled, like I was not\nanxious, I guess. And then I realized when I\u2019m there, because the receptionist looks at\n[indecipherable] says, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t have you down for today. I think your interview\u2019s\ntomorrow.\u201d I\u2019m protesting, I said, \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s today at 10 o\u2019clock.\u201d And then I realized I\u2019m\nwrong, but then I\u2019m thinking if I tell them I\u2019m wrong, they\u2019ll never hire me. So anyway, the\nassistant director who was to interview me, Marty Moss was his name, he -- he said to me, \u201cI\nthought this interview was tomorrow, but anyway since you\u2019re here, I have 10 minutes because I\nhave to go into a meeting. Let\u2019s just discuss a few minutes of what is available, and what you can\ndo [indecipherable]. And maybe we\u2019ll have to have a second interview at one time.\u201d Well, he\u2019s\ntelling me that the opening 1s at the Department of Aging in the Jewish Social Service. Now, I\nknow nothing about aging. I\u2019ve never worked with older people, I don\u2019t know what to do with\nthem. I want to work with children. Anyway, I said okay. And then I get a call from the\nchairperson of the Department of Aging to go for a second interview. And I\u2019m thinking, do I\nreally want to work with older people? I\u2019m not sure. But anyway, it was an entrance. So I think\nthe question that really, she asked me, was -- I had done some volunteer work for the Jewish\nCommunity Center, we were doing some kind of a woman\u2019s day, and I had chosen the older\nwomen, and I had done, you know, some -- a presentation about it, and gathered material, and we\nhad the show, a -- a fashion show for older women, you know, because we felt they were\nneglected in the fashion, things like that. Which went very well, actually. And I was telling her\nabout that, and she said, \u201cYou\u2019d be perfect for the department\u2019. And I\u2019m thinking, you don\u2019t\nknow -- I don\u2019t either, I don\u2019t know anything. But anyway, they hired me. And I was excited,\nand I thought well, Pll learn. If I don\u2019t like it, I can always leave. So that was how I started, and\nonce I started working with older people, I just loved it. I found it so rewarding. You know, here\nI was, always wanted to work with children, and now I\u2019m finding the other end of life more\ninteresting, actually, and very rewarding. So it was great, it was a great team to work with. It was\na good a -- very good agency, very good camaraderie and professionalism. And I enjoy every\nminute of it, and I stayed there. I think I started in \u201974, and stayed until 1990. That\u2019s a long time.\nAnd while I was working there -- I always wanted to do therapy, and I had taken some courses,\nand then while I was at the Jewish Social Service, the -- my department chair said, \u201cPaulette,\nyou've got to get your Master\u2019s degree. You are doing things that Master\u2019s degree social workers\nare doing, but we can\u2019t pay you as a Master\u2019s degree social worker.\u201d So finally I thought about\nit, and thought about it, and I\u2019ve never been to an American university, I was 49 years old. So\nwhen I told a friend, I said, \u201cI\u2019m 49, how am I gonna go to school?\u201d She said, \u201cYou'll be 49\nwhether you go or not, just go.\u201d So finally I talked it over with Isaac, I said I would need a lot of\nhelp. This was a time that Maya had started driving, and she said, \u201cI'll help, I'll help, I'll do all\nyour [indecipherable] driving for you.\u201d So everybody pitched in and I did go to school. They\naccepted me as an advanced standing student because of my experience with social work. They\nwaived ce -- certain courses the first semester, and they waived field placement the first\nsemester, because I was still working for the Jewish Social Service part time. So my first year\nwas much lighter than the other students here. Second year was harder, I had to -- to quit\nworking for the Jewish Social Service, because I couldn\u2019t handle everything, because I did have\na field placement, and I had an excellent supervisor. It was in a psychiatric clinic, a community\npsychiatric clinic in Witten. And I got excellent experience, I had a wonderful supervisor,\nMeedul Shore. And of course I had the classes, you know, I had to go to school, and plus the\nfamily. Sarah was already in college, Maya and Nicole were home. So it was hard writing\npapers, I\u2019ve never written a paper in this country. I mean, I\u2019ve written papers in Greece, but they\nwere different. It was a little hard, because as I said, this was a new experience for me. I didn\u2019t\neven know how to use the library. I had to ask how to use the library. It was a lot of work, an\nawful lot of work, but I loved every minute of it, because I felt I was doing it because I wanted to\ndo it. And I graduated with a Master\u2019s in 1991. And I went back to the Jewish Social Service,\nand -- but at the time they had a part time job only available, and they said, \u201cCome, it\u2019s part time,\nif something opens as full time, we\u2019ll get you as full time.\u201d",
        "Q: I was just going to ask your -- your Master\u2019s degree 1s in -- 1s it --",
        "A: Social work",
        "Q: -- social work at Catholic University?",
        "A: Uh-huh, right, yeah. 1991. And while I was working for the Jewish Social Service, my\nsupervisor at the community psychiatric clinic, called me one day, and he said, \u201cYou know, there\nis a psychiatrist who is looking for a social worker to work for him to do intakes. Are you\ninterested?\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019m interested, but I\u2019m not leaving Jewish Social Service.\u201d So he says,\n\u201cT\u2019ll have him call you.\u201d So he calls me, and he says he\u2019s looking for a social worker to do his\nintakes. Intakes are, you know, you -- you g -- see the person for the first time, you collect all the\ninformation, and then you give it to him, and then he determines the treatment and this kind of\nthing. But it\u2019s an elaborate process, I mean, the interviews have to be quite long, and to\nunderstand the problem, and this kind of thing. So when he called me, I was leaving for Arizona\nthe next day. It was one of Isaac\u2019s retreats. So I said to him, \u201cI\u2019m leaving for a week.\u201d He said,\n\u2018Send me your resume, and then we\u2019ll talk when you come back.\u201d I came back, he said, \u201cCome\nand see me.\u201d So I went to see him, we -- he decided to hire me. So I was working for him part\ntime, and I stayed with him 11 years. I was working both at the Jewish Social Service, and with\nhim. His name is Aaron Burger, he is in Silver Spring, very nice man. So that was a very good\nexperience, too, because he is a good supervisor also, and a very good -- good friend, also, he\nbecame.",
        "Q: Ho-How would you split your time, how many hours would you work at each place?",
        "A: Well, since I was working half time at the Jewish Social Service, actually I would go -- I\nwould work one evening for him, and I would see four or five people, once a week. Then I\nwould, on my days off from the Jewish Social Service, I would go to his office, and see people.\nBut he also gave me some people from -- for treatment, some cases that didn\u2019t require his skills,\nyou know. And then, when I quit Jewish Social Service in 1990, because Isaac was retiring, and I\n-- we were thinking a lot about traveling to Europe and all that kind of stuff, I left Jewish Social\nService, and continued working with him for -- until after Ian was born, and then I told him I\nwanted to spend time with my grandson. And that was it. Which he fully understood, and --\nbecause he has grandchildren of his own. And I\u2019m friends with his wife, and his daughter, we\nbecame quite good friends. So --",
        "Q: How did you feel about your career?",
        "A: I love my career. And now I\u2019m working -- for awhile I didn\u2019t work, after I left Dr. Burger, but\nthen I worked for -- also part time as a contract worker for a company called Aging Network\nServices, which is located in Bethesda. They\u2019ve been in business for 20 years. It\u2019s run by two\nsocial workers, and they needed a Master\u2019s degree social worker to supervise social workers who\ndo care managers, and do care management. Coordinating services, and seeing families, and this\nkind of thing. And I\u2019m still with them, very part time, but I love doing it. I mean, I -- I do enjoy\nmy career, my career is just the best career for me, anyway. It\u2019s great. Once I was thinking that I\nmay want to change careers at times, because sometimes people\u2019s problems become too big, and\nyou wonder how good you are at it or not, in helping. But I think this was a phase I had gone\nthrough, so I decided to take a catering course, cause I love to cook, and I thought well, maybe\nIll do that professionally. But I did take the course, I got the certificate, I enjoyed the course, but\nI haven\u2019t opened a catering thing. Isaac wasn\u2019t too happy for me to do that.",
        "Q: Maybe you\u2019 ll -- well, you must have thought about this, but 1t almost seems as if all these\ndifferent strands, or yarns, life experiences come together to make you -- or to equip you to do\none thing very well. And maybe you\u2019ve -- maybe you\u2019ve -- maybe you see that.",
        "A: Right. I think, you know, your past experiences, I mean your history, your past history\ninforms your present, right? And I think I am who I am because of my past experiences, and my\nmake-up, of course, but yes, ve learned through my experiences. And I think my work relates\nvery well to my experiences of other people. Because somebody was asking me what are the\nmajor things that you understand about a client. And I said, \u201cI understand culture, and different\nculture. I understand suffering. I understand hardships. I understand moving away from a\ncountry, and from family, and going to another country and starting to make a life there. I\nunderstand loneliness, lonesomeness. I understand raising children, I understand having a\nhusband and working with him, and you know, with his difficulties, and all that kind of stuff.\u201d\nSo I understand these things. Somehow I -- they come instinctively now.",
        "Q: You\u2019re still -- your -- you\u2019re not in regular employment at the moment, but you are still d --\ndoing what seems to be very important work, still arranging, and organizing, and making things\nhappen. I base that on you having mentioned getting performing artists t-to perform regularly for\nthe elderly.",
        "A: Seniors. Yeah, this is volunteer work. I mean, my work for the Aging Network Services is --\nis paid work. I\u2019m a member of WPAS, or Washington Performing Arts Society, the women\u2019s\ncommittee, and the women\u2019s committee has several subcommittees. And one of the committees I\nco-chair with another woman, is called Enriching Experiences for Seniors, that started about 10\nor 12 years ago. And what we do 1s we bring local artists to senior centers, nursing homes,\nassisted livings, recreation centers for senior adults. What we do is just we coordinate these\nthings. You have to coordinate the center, find the activities director, the date, coordinate the\nartist, and the days they are available to do this kind of things. And also provide the volunteers\nfrom the women\u2019s committee who go to audit the performance, because this way they give us\nfeedback on the artists and the interaction between the -- all the people and the artists, so we\u2019 ll\nknow whether to hire them for next year or not. This 1s a free program to the community -- I\nmean, the seniors don\u2019t pay anything for this. WPAS has a budget for the senior program. And\nthat\u2019s what I do in addition to working for the gala, which is a [indecipherable] event,\nfundraising event, or the auction, or the embassy adoption program, which 1s another women\u2019s\ncommittee program, where embassies adopt school, and the -- for the semester, or for the year,\nand the children study about that particular country. And I usually choose Greece. So the\nchildren -- the school that chooses Greece, and the embassy, I\u2019m the liaison between the two of\nthem. So we go -- the representative for the Greek embassy, or the other embassies go to the\nschool, talk to the children about it. The children study about Greece, and work with the teachers,\nwe work with the teachers, and then at the end of the semester, they put up a presentation, the\nembassy invites them for -- for cookies and juice, or whatever. And they give a presentation to\nthe ambassador, or the staff members of the embassy. And then we take the children to a Greek\nrestaurant, so they can taste a little food. These are sixth graders, they are 12 years old, and they\nare wonderful. This -- I mean, 50 embassies participate in this -- in this program, and it\u2019s a\nfantastic program for teachers and children. The teachers love this program because the children\nlearn so much through that program about the other countries. And it\u2019s very educational, it\u2019s a\nfun program, it\u2019s just great. So I love doing Greece, as you understand. Last year there were --\nthe Greek embassy was between ambassadors, so they didn\u2019t have time to participate in the\nprogram, so they were not there. So I did the embassy of the Bahamas, which was also a nice\nexperience, you know, and I went to a school pretty far away in someplace -- I think it was\nnortheast Washington. And the wife of the ambassador came to the school, they had -- they\ninvited the children to their embassy of the Bahamas. They had the presentation, they provided\nlunch at the embassy, from the whole class. It was a good experience. I mean, to -- to --\nsomehow I feel that, you know, just doing Greece every year kind of limits me to other countries,\nbecause people tell me wonderful things about the embassy of Israel, you know, and Thailand or\nother countries. But I love Greece, so Pll do anything to promote Greece, and to -- and teach\nchildren about it. There is so much. And next year it\u2019s going to be an important year because of\nthe Olympics, so --",

        "A: Oh sure. They\u2019re different things, but yes, the sense of community was very strong in my\nfamily, and giving to the community. My mother volunteered, there was a Jewish organization in\nVolos, a women\u2019s organization, she volunteered that -- there. She volunteered at the orphanage\nin Volos. There was an orphan -- not a Jewish orphanage, an orphanage in Volos, and sometimes\nshe would take me with her. And I loved going with her, and talking with the children there, but I\nwas also petrified that if my mother and father were to die, I would end up in that orphanage. I\nwas so scared of that, of them dying and me being in the orphanage. And I remember when I had\nthis visit in Volos, when it was like the 50 year reunion I was telling you, Yola and I had taken a\ntaxi to go to the Jewish cemetery, because our grandparents are buried there. So as we are\npassing, the driver -- the taxi driver says, \u201cAnd here 1s, on the left 1s the orphanage.\u201d And I said\nto him, \u201cStop!\u201d And he scratches on his brakes, and he stops the taxi. And he said, \u201cWhat\nhappened?\u201d I said, \u201cStop, I want to see this orphanage.\u201d It seemed so small to me. I said, \u201cIs this\nthe same orphanage that was here?\u201d \u201cOh yeah,\u201d he said, \u201cnothing has changed. They just painted\nit, but it\u2019s the same thing.\u201d It looked so tiny.

        "Q: -- what happened to the family?",

My\ngrandparents had seven children, two girls. First one, my paternal grandmother, last one my\nmaternal grandmother, and there were boys in between. So there were five children in my\nfather\u2019s family. Abusta was the eldest, my father was the second, there were two girls, and\nSaould, or Sauld was the youngest, who was born in 19 -- I think he was born 1909, or 1910. So\nhe was like an afterthought. He was much younger compared to the other siblings in the family.\nWell, none of them are alive. They all went to hiding in different places. My fourth aunt, the\nfourth child in the family was the only one who survived until 1976, I think. She came to the\nUnited States. She was adopted by an uncle, the brother of -- of her mother, who was married,\nand they couldn\u2019t have any children. So Connie used to go to their house, and they had her there,\nand they played with her, and they loved her, they absolutely were in love with her. And they\ndecided to come -- to go to Teriester first. So they asked if they could take her along. And they\ndid, and then they decided they wanted to come to the United States. I mean, the uncle, and his\nwife. So they went back to Greece, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an official adoption, whether there\nwere papers of adoption taken. But somehow it seems like the family, or the parents, anyway,\ndecided to -- to let her go with the uncle, because they felt she will have a wonderful life in the\nUnited States, and not in Volos. So she came to the United States, and she didn\u2019t know she was\nadopted until much, much later in life. She was an adult, I think, when she found out about that.\nShe got married, and had a son, whom I see, Bob Guburbon. My aunt died in, I think, \u201970 -- let\nme see, no, she must have died in \u201976 or \u201977, yeah, in Florida. And her husband died a few years\nlater. I see her grand -- h-her son, often. This aunt, Connie, send us care packages after the war\nwas over, with food, with clothes. She would send fancy party clothes for me, and they looked so\nfunny, because you know, I mean, here I didn\u2019t have any clothes, and I had a -- an organza dress,\nold dress. And she would send some cans, I mean, chocolates. And she once sent shoes for my\nfather. I remember they were so huge. I mean, my father was a tall and big man, and these shoes\nwere tremendous for him. I mean, he couldn\u2019t wear them. And she sended a teddy bear for me.\nSo I always remember her, you know, for doing these things. Of course, I met her when I came\nto the United States. But I mean, she had never met her siblings. She was in touch with them. I\ndon\u2019t know if she was in touch with them before the war, but after the war, I mean, she came\nthrough with sending care packages. And then, of course, they were corresponding with -- \u2018scuse\nme -- with my father, and he was the one who would tell the news, you know, t-to -- to his\nsisters. And my Aunt Julia corresponded with her, because Julia had come to the United States to\nvisit her son who was studying, and has seen Connie. Now, my father\u2019s younger brother, Saul\nwas hiding in somebody\u2019s house, I think the name was aseema -- Aseemomeetees. And there\nwere two daughters and a son, maybe two sons. And he fell in love with the oldest daughter, and\nshe with him. Saul was a handsome, beautiful man. And after the war was over, they kept on\nseeing each other, and dating each other, and they wanted to get married, but of course she was\nChristian Orthodox, and the rabbi wouldn\u2019t marry them, she had to convert. So she took all the\nlessons that she needed to do to convert. But then there was a little detail which I don\u2019t\nremember now, and they decided they were gonna go to France, and get married in Paris. So\nthey did go to Paris and got married, and came back to live in Athens. And she knew more about\nJewish holidays than any of us did. My mother didn\u2019t know them, and she would call -- Deena,\nwas her name. Deena would call my mother and say, \u201cDo you know that today is,\u201d such and such\na holiday. My mother would say, \u201cOh, really?\u201d I mean, we observed the big holidays, but not the\nlittle ones. And Deena knew everything. And -- but unfortunately, a few months later, in 1950 --\nI think they married \u00b049, or beginning of \u201950 -- or \u201951 I think it was, he got cancer, a brain tumor.\nAnd they went to Paris and he had surgery and died. It was terrible. It was devastating. He was\n40 or 41, very young. A life, you know, just got done so young. And of course Deena was\ntotally, totally devastated. Now, many years later she remarried, but she divorced, this marriage\ndidn\u2019t go that well. Then many years later she married somebody who was living in the United\nStates, in Florida, so -- a -- a -- a Greek, but I think he -- he was Greek American, or someth like\nthat, and he went -- they -- they lived in Florida. She couldn\u2019t stand it, she didn\u2019t like Florida, she\ndidn\u2019t like America. So she divorced him too, and she went back to Greece, and now she -- she\nlives alone. When I go to Greece she comes and sees me. She -- she is very warm, very lovely. I\nwent to -- to volunteer nursing school at the Red Cross in Greece with her sister, her younger\nsister. So we were both volunteer nurses at the Red Cross hospital, and we took the classes\ntogether. So I haven\u2019t seen her sister for a long time, but Deena, she was a lovely, lovely woman,\nyeah.",
        "Q: Sad story that she --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Well --",
        "A: It\u2019s sad. It\u2019s sad that they were -- sad for her. I mean, here it was the love of her life, and he\ndied almost -- less than a year after they were married. And for the family, you know -- I mean,\nfor my father it was devastating. Actually, Saul was a very rambunctious young man, and when\nhe was -- I think at the age of 13, he came to live with my mother and father, because he had\ndiabetes, and somehow wouldn\u2019t adhere to any program, and my grandmother had very hard\ntime controlling him, or managing him. So her blood pressure would go very high, and they were\nvery worried about my grandmother. So my father said, \u201cLet him stay with us.\u201d And somehow\nmy mother was much more able to -- to work with him, and he loved my mother, he absolutely\nadored her. And he stayed with them, he lived with them.",
        "Q: So you were -- he was very close to your family anyway.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: And do the -- your -- your father lived for many years after your mother\u2019s death --",
        "A: Eight years. Eight more years, but he was a broken man by then. I mean, he wa -- her death\nwas devastating to him. His health started -- well, his health was not so good before that, but it\nstarted deteriorating. He had the heart problems, he had diabetes, which was from a long time\nbefore that. He had arteriosclerosis, which started manifesting, you know, and some -- some\nbrain damage, you know. Forgetfulness, and stuff like that. So -- and he wa -- he was bitter. He\nwas bitter. Not too many friends came to see him. So he was again like he was a forgotten man,\nhe was somebody special and very much sought after in his younger years, because of his\nposition and his powerful connections and everything else. And then now that he needed to have\na lot of people around him, you know, they will come once in awhile to visit, and that was about\nit. So he -- he was lonely, very lonely.",
        "Q: And your sister would -- the -- the burden of caring for him would fall on Yola?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. This is something that I really regret, because I was so very far away, and you\nknow, I couldn\u2019t do much. She took very good care of him, and she was like the care manager,\nyou know, did everything for him. Took -- would visit him every day, will talk to the doctors,\nmake arrangements with doctors, and things like that, yeah. Yeah, she was -- she took excellent\ncare of my parents. And I think she resents it a little bit that I was so far away and could not help,\nthat she had to go through that by herself. And maybe my job of taking care of older people, has\nsomething to do at some point with my need to take care of my parents. You know, lots of\nunconscious things go around. Can\u2019t decipher every single thing, but I\u2019m sure my choice of work\nis not incidental, you know, it\u2019s medi -- meaningful, and it relates to my need to do something I\ndidn\u2019t do. You know, I mean, they needed care, and she was there for them, I wasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: I wonder to -- to what extent you see the period in hiding as a formative influence that in\nsome ways has shaped your life? I mean, what -- to what extent do you think that\u2019s -- that is so?",
        "A: Well, I think it\u2019s in balance with my life at this point. I think it\u2019s -- it\u2019s one experience that I\nwouldn\u2019t have had if the war had not happened. I think my life would have turned out to be\ntotally different. Carefree, you know, affluent. Totally different life. But I certainly don\u2019t regret\nmy life. I think it was a good life in many ways, because it brought me to the point I am now,\nclose to 70 years of age, where I think I have become a very strong person, a very compassionate\nperson, a person who cares about people. A person who -- who enjoys life. I mean, I remember a\nfriend of mine once, who has a house at the beach, had invited me, and then we decided at the\nspur of the moment to go to a -- to an orchard, or to -- to a farm nearby, and pick up peaches.\nAnd I remember giggling, and just laughing, and enjoying picking peaches. And she looked at\nme, and she said, \u201cPaulette, I never knew you would get such a thrill out of something so simple,\nyou know, such a very simple kind of thing.\u201d Incidentally, when we were, during the Italian\noccupation, I used to go and pick up fruit, you know, climb the trees and pick up peaches, or\ncherries. And of course I would eat the cherries, and I got sick, because I would love them, and\nyou know, then my stomach will hurt. So maybe that reminded me a little bit of that, but it was\nsuch a pleasure to do things, to do anything. I mean, I love being outdoors, looking at the blue\nsky, and -- or watching children, see them grow. That\u2019s the biggest joy for me.",
        "Q: I think we\u2019ve come to the end of our --",
        "A: Okay.",

        "Q: Now I had assumed that it would be a factory, I knew it was a textile factory, assuming that it\nwas using yarns from the plain of Thessaly, but really relied on imported good.",

        "Q: And was there competition between the two?",
        "Q: How many people would be employed in the factory?",
        "Q: Oh, a --",
        "Q: Yeah. So it would be a -- a chime from a tower?",
        "Q: Well, does that mean that your name would be -- your family name, Moudzoukos would be\nwidely known in that region, or in Greece generally?",
        "Q: What about the tailors that would make up the -- I mean, we-were you manufacturing the fab\n-- the cashmere, but also tailoring it?",

        "Q: So there was --",
        "Q: Would she be -- when -- when you were a child, would she be fairly constantly in the home,\nor part of your life?",
        "Q: Well, both sets of grandparents would be close by, is that right?",
        "Q: So it really was a home with a great deal of stability and so on.",
        "Q: Now, what do you remember of your early childhood, and of your relationship with your\nolder sister?",
        "Q: What -- who were the people that you were named after, you and your sister?",

        "Q: And then would you have special observances of the holidays in your home?",
        "Q: Do you remember in these -- I know that you were really a very young child then, but what\nare your earliest memories of whether you felt you were primarily Greek, or Jewish?",
        "Q: Yeah. Would there be other Brownies who were also Jewish?",
        "Q: And do you remember whether your early childhood friends would be -- would be Jewish\nfriends, or would there be a real mixture?",
        "Q: So your life was thoroughly integrated into the society?",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Now, you mentioned that you would not go to the synagogue except to take oil. Would your\nsister, who was older than you have had a Bat Mitzvah, or any kind of formal training in her\nJewish faith?",
        "Q: And what would that training be, and who would it come from? You mentioned your -- your\ngrandmother before, complaining of you going to Brownies on Saturday. But would she be the --\nthe person who would sort of teach you what you knew about the Jewish faith?",
        "Q: But that would be normal at the time, I suppose, even for privileged women, not to have a\ngreat deal of education, is that nght?",
        "Q: She might have been a great reader, and have educated herself, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nPaulette Nehama. This is tape number one, side B. We\u2019 ll continue talking about your\ngrandmother. I assume that you had a very close and loving relationship with her.",
        "Q: Now ya -- and your sister did not have to share a room.",
        "Q: \u2019'm wondering if any -- if you have any special -- you must -- memories of these early years.\nYou mentioned it as a very happy time, but are there particular things that evoke wonderful\nmemories, and I\u2019m thinking of foods, or smells, people, pieces of music.",
        "Q: Can you get the same quality of fruit from the same mountains today?",
        "Q: And you\u2019d have special foods for high holidays, but I suppose there\u2019d be other Greek\nholidays you\u2019d also celebrate.",
        "Q: Would there have been, though, responsibilities that fell on your older sister, that you were\nperhaps freed from?",
        "Q: Yeah. Now, what about school? How old would be -- you be when you started attending any\nkind of school?",
        "Q: And how -- how old exactly were you then?",
        "Q: Do you have memories of your parents attitudes or moods at the time? Did you -- I mean,\nthey would probably shield you from some concerns, but do you have any memories that suggest\nthe wonderfully happy times were over?",
        "Q: And what -- what month and year was that?",
        "Q: And what happened in the next years?",
        "Q: Now, this would be your --",
        "Q: -- oh, the aunt?",
        "Q: Who was doing the bombing, and tell me then about the s -- the shelters.",
        "Q: Yeah. So y-you would go and take food and bedding with you? What do you remember, or\nwould you go there so fast that you would simply head there with your family as fast as you\ncould?",
        "Q: Let me go back to the -- to place what was happening in the context of the second World War.\nWhy would the British have been bombing the port of Volos, the third largest port?",
        "Q: So at this time your life was beginning to change. And then what happened?",
        "Q: And they\u2019d be assuming that you were a well to do family, and might be the very place to\nhave food.",
        "Q: Would you still be sitting down rather formally, with the maid serving all of you according to\nyour hierarchy, even with simpler foods?",
        "Q: So the -- the staff with your family would in fact be fortunate -- perhaps more fortunate than\ntheir families in the -- in the mountains, in perhaps having more food.",
        "Q: And the cause of this famine in Greece, was that because ships could not get through to the\nport?",
        "Q: So suffering was really quite considerable?",
        "Q: Now are there any other things you remember during that period of Italian occupation that be\n-- the famine, but were the Italians taking any measures against the Jews?",
        "Q: And that would have -- you -- that was something you observed in the street, or --",
        "Q: And I\u2019m assuming in your attitude, you\u2019d have taken your cue from your parents, but the --\nthe Italians would be hated as the occupiers?",
        "Q: And then everything changed when the Germans occupied -- moved into Greece in 1943.",
        "Q: And why did your family move to Athens?",
        "Q: Do you remember your parents ever talking about the -- the Jews in Salonika, and I wondered\nwhat they knew, and I wondered what they shared.",
        "Q: Did that -- did that make it worse?",
        "Q: And were you noticing -- do you have memories of noticing a changed mood? Fear on the\npart of your parents?",
        "Q: And you were -- you were 10 then?",
        "Q: False papers. Now, who would have supplied them, and would you have had Greek Orthodox\nnames, and so on?",
        "Q: And which members of the family would be on this boat with you, and did any of your\nhousehold staff leave with you?",
        "Q: And who -- who was that?",
        "Q: And would she be a -- a maid, or a cook, or a governess?",
        "Q: And was she Jewish?",
        "Q: And whatever discussions went on be -- prior to this plan being made, you were not -- you\nwere protected, and you were not privy as a -- as a young child, or a 10 year old.",
        "Q: What do you remember of your -- of your sister\u2019s attitude?",
        "Q: Did she seem -- do you -- well, wonder if you even know if she was troubled.",
        "Q: The -- this was -- I mean, it was a plan that obviously -- I would think obviously, talking to\naccount that your father was full of concern about what was likely to happen. Do you -- do you\nremember if he ever thought of -- of leaving Europe, or -- or going somewhere much farther\naway, leaving Greece? He would be a man with contacts, and so on, in other European nations.",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nPaulette Nehama. This is tape number two, side A. You\u2019re telling me that your father never\nconsidered going anywhere beyond Greece.",
        "Q: Anybody -- was there anyone you knew who considered fleeing to the United States?",
        "Q: And who were they?",
        "Q: And did they return to Greece, or did they continue on their way?",
        "Q: And let\u2019s go back to the move to Athens, and tell me about your life there, prior to going into\nhiding.",
        "Q: What had triggered this -- what had triggered the plan, and the crisis, if you like?",
        "Q: Was there any leadership coming through the synagogue, or the Jewish community, do you\nthink, to help people deal with this? I mean, did all families begin to make plans at the same\ntime?",
        "Q: Meanwhile, you were living under false names in Athens, but would your -- would neighbors\nknow your real identity, or would you keep very much to family, and not be mixing much with\npeople who were not close to you?",
        "Q: Now, from the time of these whispered meetings, when you had the mumps, to the time when\nyou left the apartment and went into hiding, how much time went by?",
        "Q: And what preparation -- obviously the planning was going on, but as a child, do you have any\nmemory of the activities going on in the apartment? I mean, was there packing of valuables, or\nanything that you remember observing?",
        "Q: And when you left Volos, and came to Greece, you\u2019d already taken a huge -- or made a huge\nchange in your standard of living. I assume that the apartment in Greece would be much more\nsparse, you\u2019d left all your possessions and so on behind.",
        "Q: How -- they would simply not -- they\u2019d have disappeared, or they wouldn\u2019t -- friends and\nneighbors would not honor the --",
        "Q: Let me go back to the woman and the painting. It\u2019s a -- m-m-maybe -- maybe it sheds light on\nsomething. Obviously to have left a cherished possession with her, she would have been a trusted\nfriend. I -- I wondered was that -- her not honoring that trust later, what did that mean?",
        "Q: And then wa -- when it comes to going into hiding, you had to know that you could trust the\npeople that you were going to be with. What do you know about the -- how the family split up,\nwho you stayed with.",
        "Q: I -- I wanted to clarify your not going to school was really because your -- you were more\neffectively hidden if you didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: And then -- well, loo -- let\u2019s go ahead.",
        "Q: Now, at first when you were rescued by your sister from the elderly man, that must have been\nsimply wonderful, to be reunited again.",
        "Q: And I am guessing that was the hardest experience, is that right?",
        "Q: Do you think that that\u2019s stayed with you, any of those feelings?",
        "Q: This is tape number two, side B. The -- I want to go back a moment and ask for more\ninformation about the two families that you stayed with --",
        "Q: -- or three, in fact, 1f you count the elderly man.",
        "Q: And all these families that were taking you in were Greek Orthodox families?",
        "Q: I mean, were they richly rewarded, or was it -- or do you feel it was simply that you were\nallowed to make a contribution for real costs?",
        "Q: I also assume that they were taking very great risks. What would -- if they had been found to\nhave been sheltering Jews, would their lives be in danger, as we -- as well as the other side of\nthat is that your lives were in their hands.",
        "Q: What did they give as their reasons?",
        "Q: For -- for sheltering you, would they say this -- you would do it for us, or this is just common\nhuman decency?",
        "Q: I-It does seem very na -- I mean, he was doing the right thing, but it also seems to me\nadmirable, because his own children were placed at risk in -- in acting morally, and so on.",
        "Q: Now --",
        "Q: Tell me what day to day life would be like with the Pavellas. I mean, would you -- would you\nall eat meals together, and would you do chores in the house? Like who would clean the\nbathroom, and what do you remember about the daily life at that time?",
        "Q: What about clothes?",
        "Q: What do you remember of your -- of your sister and your mother\u2019s state of mind at this time?\nI mean, it sounds as if for you, when you were at the Pavellas, it was not a difficult time, perhaps\nbecause you -- I mean, it was difficult in the sense that 1t was -- you couldn\u2019t go to school, but\nthat -- maybe I\u2019m wrong in saying it was not difficult, but not painfully difficult like the time\nwhen you were abandoned and alone.",
        "Q: When you spoke of the code language between your parents, first of all, would there be a\nphone in the home at that time, or would your mother have to go somewhere to make that call?",
        "Q: What did -- what did you know about the treatment of the Jews by the Germans then?",
        "Q: Would you see mistreatment of Jews in the streets, or do you know of family members\nobserving beatings, or killings?",
        "Q: Do you attribute your survival to these families? I assume that you do.",
        "Q: And how many -- how widespread was this? Do you -- do you have any sense of the numbers\nof families who would be sheltering Jews? Was it extremely rare, or was it very common?",
        "Q: I wondered if -- if 1t\u2019s known, of -- later, do -- do you know of any families that -- where the -\n- the Jews that they were hiding were discovered, and what actions were taken against these\nsheltering families?",
        "Q: And at this time, how would you get news? You were -- you -- with the Pavellas you were\ngetting it through Mr. Pavella\u2019s newspaper, but would there be a radio in the home? Would you\nlisten to -- to news programs, or would your mother get the news in code from your father?",
        "Q: What -- what do you mean sealed, when --",
        "Q: Now, at this time do you remember knowing anything about resistance fighters?",
        "Q: So th -- th -- those were the heroes, rather than the sheltering families?",
        "Q: Well, how did this period of hiding come to an end? What happened, and also how old were\nyou when you no longer needed to be in hiding?",
        "Q: And did things change very quickly? I mean, what -- what happened next? Would it take\nawhile to pick up the pieces of your old life?",
        "Q: Now where -- where was he take -- I mean, where was he when he was captured?",
        "Q: Now, that\u2019s interesting to me, so w -- you mean, the Sephardic Jews who were rounded up,\ngenerally were treated differently?",
        "Q: So he was taken to Bergen-Belsen, wa -- wa -- what -- what did you ultimate -- ultimately\nlearn? Ha -- was it -- it -- of his experiences?",
        "Q: Would he have been working in -- as a -- doing sort of slave labor, or --",
        "Q: And do you -- do you know what his relationship with his family was like afterwards? I mean,\nwas he a --",
        "Q: -- was he a man whose spirit was broken, when he returned, really?",
        "Q: You would -- you were 11 when you came out of hiding. What are your memories of what it\nwas like in those next years, when you\u2019d be 11 - 12 - 13, and then tell me how you think,\nsubsequently, this period in hiding has changed you.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What\u2019s the name of the school?",
        "Q: And I wonder if looking back, you think that you were -- in the period in hiding, living in a\nfantasy world as a protective measure? I mean, you spoke about your imagination and your\ngames. I mean it -- have you thought about this, whether -- whether the rich imaginative fantasies\nwere in fact helping to shield your -- your spirit, or your psyche from what was going on?",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nPaulette Nehama. This is tape number three, side A. You were talking about the concern that you\nwould give the game away, blurting something out as a child.",
        "Q: What do you think that the impact of -- of that was on you, developmental -- I -- I ask this\nquestion just because I\u2019ve heard discussion of it. Sometimes childhood is robbed. You were\nforced to be adult too soon. Or sometimes I think other survivors have said that it\u2019s -- that\nthey\u2019ve remained a child longer, and been slowed in their normal maturation, because they were\nbearing these burdens.",
        "Q: And you spoke about schooling, but as -- as you -- as your teens went on, what would be --\nhow did schooling progress, and other things? Would there be -- would there be any extra\ncurricular things, or were times too hard to have piano lessons, and art lessons and so on?",
        "Q: Now why do you think that is? I mean, did it, perhaps, address your strengths?",
        "Q: So the Girl Scouts was really a saving --",
        "Q: -- thing in your life. What about your sister, and when you came out of hiding, how would she\nresume her education? Or -- or did she feel she\u2019d finished it at that time, cause she was --",
        "Q: Was she a good student in school?",
        "Q: Yeah, so she got into -- into trouble?",
        "Q: Now, how old were you when you met Isaac, your husband?",
        "Q: So a lot of time went by from the period we\u2019re speaking about until the time --",
        "Q: -- when you met him. But so tell me what went on in those years. You continued with your\neducation, were you then working?",
        "Q: Now, who did Sam marry?",
        "Q: Who he met in this group?",
        "Q: And then when they married, that was when you met Isaac?",
        "Q: Well tell -- tell me the story, a -- a -- actually, in interviewing your husband, I -- I know it\nfrom --",
        "Q: -- one perspective in the museum tape, but --",
        "Q: So it was a whirlwind week.",
        "Q: But you were right?",
        "Q: Well, I think in affairs of the heart, perhaps one -- you know, at once.",
        "Q: And when I said you were right, I didn\u2019t mean that you were right to think your daughter\u2019s\ncrazy, it -- it was just that time showed that your -- you were judging wisely your feelings.",
        "Q: And you had -- you had a lot in common. Looking back, do you think that was why you could\nmake a decision so quickly? Just that your -- you both had had -- had suffered in different ways\nduring the war. You had the same -- you both were Jewish.",
        "Q: What was the reaction of Sam and Evelyn, and your parents?",
        "Q: And you -- in a sense you\u2019ve already explained that your parents knew Sam, and therefore --",
        "Q: -- blessed your plans.",
        "Q: And then, how did you make plans?",
        "Q: How long was it since you\u2019d seen Isaac in Athens?",
        "Q: -- a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette\nNehama. This is tape number three, side B. You were telling me about being reunited with Isaac.",
        "Q: Removed all your doubts.",
        "Q: And then you planned to marry in Canada, shortly after that?",
        "Q: And the waiting in Toronto with the family would not be easy, I assume.",
        "Q: You had done your training.",
        "Q: Oh, and when was that?",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: By the way, would you have had any photos of you in that couturier wedding gown?",
        "Q: So you have lots of photos of Sarah as a baby.",
        "Q: What was happening in your sister\u2019s life, at the time when you came to the United States?",
        "Q: So your parents, just at the time when you had left, they would be seeing a lot of your sister?",
        "Q: They needed -- they needed you with Sarah in your arms.",
        "Q: Now how did you choose Sarah\u2019s names -- is that how you pronounce it?",
        "Q: I guess -- w-we haven\u2019t even -- we haven\u2019t even talked about Maya and her birth. Perhaps\nyou should give the full names and dates of birth of all three of your daughters.",
        "Q: Yeah, you should -- you should tell the story.",
        "Q: It sounds like a -- it\u2019s a great story, and it\u2019s just a wonderfully happy time.",
        "Q: Because it really shows the story that by then you had built a life here, and a community, and\na family.",
        "Q: In -- in sort of creating -- composing a life for yourself, what do you think was the hardest?",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nPaulette Nehama. This is tape number four, side A. We\u2019re talking about the challenges you\novercame.",
        "Q: Now, Isaac would have been very engrossed in his work, which was fascinating work, but it\nwould mean he\u2019d have less time to be supportive.",
        "Q: Did you set out with clear ideas of how you wanted the children, the girls to be brought up?",
        "Q: What about wanting to give them some religious upbringing? Was that important to you,\ngoing to synagogue, and teaching them about their faith?",
        "Q: Can you think of any anecdote that explains that? Th-That illustrates your concern?",
        "Q: Had you experienced any anti-Semitism that led up to that? Or -- I -- I understand that may --\nessentially it was a scar from your wartime experience, but I wondered if you\u2019d experienced any\nanti-Semitism in the United States?",
        "Q: And when you were responsible for bringing your daughters up, did you talk a lot about your\nown wartime experiences, going in hiding and so on, or did you feel it was hard to discuss such\nthings?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Now, I\u2019m guessing that you\u2019re much more sensitive than -- than many others to any kind of\nprejudice or injustice. D -- when you came, do you re -- do you have memories of thinking about\nthe racial situation in this country?",
        "Q: Did you become an American?",
        "Q: And did you have a naturalization --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Hubert Humphrey.",
        "Q: Was that very moving? What were your feelings?",
        "Q: Do y -- it\u2019s not possible to be a dual national?",
        "Q: Besides, my question was cause I wondered if you found it deeply moving to become an\nAmerican, and in fact, tell me what that means to you now, now that you have grandsons, and\nroots.",
        "Q: Where did you go to get it?",
        "Q: Now, when it was the time of your daughters to decide on careers, and pursue sort of\nadvanced education, what do you think they gained from you? You -- you know, even in going\nback to school at 49, you were something of a role model, I would think.",
        "Q: Were you ever affected by the feminist movement?",
        "Q: Do you think they see themselves as children of survivors?",
        "Q: Why do you think Nicole is more affected?",
        "Q: When you spoke of that holidays being difficult, not everyone was here, course your family\nwas not here because of the -- you separated fro-from -- by, you know, vast distances.",
        "Q: And of course, Isaac lost his -- his mother, so their -- a grandmother had died at Auschwitz,\nand their uncle Nehama. Is that what you\u2019re thinking of, the -- the actual, you know, family\nmembers lost?",
        "Q: And the essence of those holidays, I guess your daughters are right, is the -- the family\ngathering.",
        "Q: And your -- and it\u2019s not there. I interviewed someone called Susie Schwartz, and she spoke of\nthe -- her wish that there\u2019d -- were another grou -- term for survivor, just because she -- she felt\nthat she had been in hiding in a farm building in Holland, and her problem was simply with the\nfact that the -- the common stereotype, or presumption is that survivors survived Auschwitz,\nwhen in fact there are many different --",
        "Q: -- shades and grades of suffering, and so on.",
        "Q: But you think differently now?",
        "Q: And it may be that with -- I don\u2019t know whether you have any thoughts about how -- when\nyou have reflected more. You may feel differently.",
        "Q: And you have a wonderful family.",
        "Q: But -- but what are the special -- out of your experiences, what would you have other\nAmericans learn from what you have seen and experienced?",
        "Q: -- of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama. This is\ntape number four, side B. I\u2019m jumping to a new question, do you think that you were much more\nprotective of your daughters because of your own experiences? I mean, you mentioned that one",
        "Q: Now, were you -- were you mostly in agreement about disciplining the girls, and other child\nrearing practices, or did you have strong disagreements?",
        "Q: It takes awhile before you -- you can see, I\u2019m sure.",
        "Q: Now, one thing we didn\u2019t talk about was the family in Greece that sheltered you, provided a\nhaven, and your maintaining ties with them, the Pavellas.",
        "Q: How closely have you kept in touch, and did that go on constantly, or has there been a -- a\nreunion and a visit in recent times?",
        "Q: Do they -- did you learn new stories from them?",
        "Q: Well, children might place the families at risk in their sort of innocence of the dangers, but\nyou also suggest that for you as a child, not knowing may have heightened your anxiety.",
        "Q: But in fact it was what empowered you.",
        "Q: You know, I\u2019m going back to your -- your role as a grandmother now, and your feeling that\nyou want grandchildren to know about your lives. But a -- have you thought also of what it\nseems they should know about your family\u2019s history in Volos, and the -- the contribution that\nJews made to the life of Greece over many centuries. I mean, will that be part of your -- I mean\nthere\u2019s -- would seem there\u2019s a proud heritage that was brought to a somewhat -- you know, a-\nabrupt and difficult stage.",
        "Q: You and Isaac had many commonalities in building a successful marriage. Did you have any\nreservations when one of your daughters married somebody who was not Jewish, and m-maybe\nhad -- you mentioned a British son-in-law. Di-did that give you cause for concern, or really -- or\nnot?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Well, we\u2019d be remiss now if we didn\u2019t mention Sarah\u2019s recent marriage.",
        "Q: Yes. Now, let me just finish up by asking about looking back, what do you feel are your\ngreatest sorrows, sadness?",
        "Q: And then the greatest joys?",
        "Q: It\u2019s a good way to close. I want -- want to thank you.",
        "Q: So Ian helped you?",
        "Q: Your -- were telling me about returning to Greece.",
        "Q: This interview continues on tape number five, side A.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nPaulette Nehama, on July the eighth, 2003. This is tape number five, side A. We were talking\nabout your humanity, and I wondered to what extent do you think that was innate, or whether\nyou were -- you had a deeper understanding because of your suffering of difficulties when you\nwere in hiding.",
        "Q: Tell me the kind of -- we -- we talked about this to some extent before, but are there any\nstories or vignettes that you can share about that time after September 1943, when you went into\nhiding?",
        "Q: What happened to the boyfriend?",
        "Q: So flowers would be one of those things that -- one of the pleasures that you would not\nnormally have, but what about food during those -- that time in hiding?",
        "Q: And did the soup come from the United States?",
        "Q: And were potatoes part of the Greek diet, normally?",
        "Q: And how long did that, the coupons, the rationing last after the war?",
        "Q: If we go back to hiding, are there any other stories that come to mind? Any other memories?",
        "Q: Do you remember whether it was the body of a person?",
        "Q: And did -- did those -- w-were there often roundups of that kind because the Greeks retaliated\nagainst the Germans?",
        "Q: And what -- what did you know of the behavior of the German troops in Athens towards the\nGreeks. I mean were they -- did they -- did they behave well, or were there all sorts of horrors\ncommitted by them?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Were there stories that your sister would share with you, or did she protect you as your\nparents did?",
        "Q: What was the impact of that on you, do you think that -- in your relationship, wa-was there\nany, particularly?",
        "Q: You\u2019d learned to be guarded?",
        "Q: Now, when you were in hiding, would there be any visits from old friends, or members of the\nJewish community, or would it be very much an isolated time for your whole family?",
        "Q: I just wanted to make sure that we\u2019ve got the order correct here. So you -- you were -- these\nwere the moves you had, you were in one place, and then when there was a threat, and your\nidentities were at risk, you moved to the second place, and in between, you had the two weeks\nwith the elderly gentleman, and his housekeeper?",
        "Q: And it was really two main places of hiding, except --",
        "Q: Aha. Tell me about that.",
        "Q: Now who was it who took your father for questioning?",
        "Q: And they were --",
        "Q: What do you know about the -- how many of them there were, and to what extent they\ncollaborated with the Germans? They obviously could be bribed.",
        "Q: Do you know what condition your father was in when he came back? Was he very shaken?",
        "Q: So throughout that time in hiding, the whole time the other three members of the family\nalways had this money on them, hidden in their clothing.",
        "Q: What about jewels? I mean, was there anything else that they sewed into their clothing, or\nindeed had with them? We talked about possessions --",
        "Q: -- but I wonder what other valuable things --",
        "Q: Do you know what happened to these things we talked about? Some of the paintings, some of\nthe possessions like the painting that was not returned, but I mean, was jewelry or other\npossessions every reclaimed by the family?",
        "Q: Did your father talk about what had happened during that Greek SS questioning? Course, he\nmay not have shared it with -- with you.",
        "Q: And luckily he had enough to pay them off.",
        "Q: And then that day, he moved to the friends house.",
        "Q: And these people were all Greek Orthodox Christians --",
        "Q: This family and the judge you mentioned next door?",
        "Q: And then they found -- you were with them for a night or two, and then moved on to a new\nplace.",
        "Q: Do you know how common it was for sheltering families to have been discovered, and their\nlives put on the line through what they were doing?",
        "Q: What would -- what would a day be like at this stage in hiding? I mean, do you remember\nwhether anybody sort of tucked you in at night, or told you stories? How would you pass the\ndays?",
        "Q: Would there be any observing of Jewish rituals? I just wondered if your parents at this time\nmight seek solace in rituals, or religious observances, or whether in fact they\u2019d be so frozen\nthrough anxiety, they may have been unable to do anything very much.",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nPaulette Nehama. This is tape number five, side B. Your parents also at this time, or most of this\ntime in hiding, could not speak in confidence. I mean, you were sharing quarters. They could not\neven whisper together, I assume, at night, and say how do you think Paulette is doing, or what --",
        "Q: I was just thinking of the fact that they would really -- there\u2019d be little --",
        "Q: -- privacy for them to confide.",
        "Q: Do -- have any other memories come to mind?",
        "Q: You know, you would be 11, but you -- you spoke -- you have spoken often about your dolls,\nand were you still playing and fantasizing a lot with your doll or dolls?",
        "Q: Would this doll fit in your pocket? Was it really tiny, that small?",
        "Q: So th -- so that that doll was very important?",
        "Q: Interesting.",
        "Q: I wonder what was going on that you hadn\u2019t bonded with that doll.",
        "Q: Now tell me more about your sister. Maybe you should remind us of her full name, because\nwe haven\u2019t mentioned her by name for a while.",
        "Q: What was her full name?",
        "Q: Would your -- your real names ever pop out, or -- or y --",
        "Q: And they would not be Jewish?",
        "Q: And other times it could have been such a wonderful meeting.",
        "Q: What was life like for your sister after the end of the war, and have you talked about how\neach of you were -- I assume you do, about -- feel that your lives were affected by this\nexperience?",
        "Q: And there -- there could be factors, and I wonder if you\u2019ve talked about the fact that you were\n-- you were younger, and you were protected, but you\u2019ve already talked earlier about your\nanxiety over what you didn\u2019t know, and your sister would have a slightly more active role,\nbecause she\u2019d be involved in the planning. And she\u2019d be protecting you, so --",
        "Q: -- she\u2019d be a caregiver to some extent.",
        "Q: Which, either role could be more damaging.",
        "Q: Did you keep that bundle ready?",
        "Q: And where did you keep the bundle? I mean, was it at the end of your bed?",
        "Q: Interesting.",
        "Q: And your sister s -- eagerly went on with life and --",
        "Q: -- indulging her love of clothes as elegant as could be put together.",
        "Q: And brought pleasure, to be fair.",
        "Q: Now, when did she meet her husband, and tell me about their wedding, and I -- and -- and the\nimpact of that on family.",
        "Q: The first new dress in how long, do you think?",
        "Q: That makes me think of the -- a question about how would your f -- parents dress in the time\nin hiding? Would they maintain very dignified style of dress, even though clothes would get\nshabby and well worn?",
        "Q: What -- what a contrast. I think of the -- the daughter of the head of the c-cashmere making\nfactory.",
        "Q: It is a wonderful story.",
        "Q: Now your sister -- I just wanted to get a sense of her subsequent life -- her husband died\nyoung.",
        "Q: Did that remain a rift between them?",
        "Q: How old would your mother be at the end of the war in 1945?",
        "Q: And tell me about -- let\u2019s talk about your mother.",
        "Q: We haven\u2019t really talked about her since, except as she -- her life is sort of interwoven with --\nwith yours. We did talk about her activities and charitable involvement in Volos, before, but --",
        "Q: -- but tell me more.",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nPaulette Nehama. This is tape number six, side A. We were talking about the photographer, and\nher photos, and -- that she\u2019d come across in Volos.",
        "Q: To what extent -- I want to hear more about your mother, but to what extent have you kept in\ntouch as a family with Volos?",
        "Q: How diminished was that Jewish community? I mean, would it have -- would it be half the\nsize of what it was, or a third of the size?",
        "Q: More so than in Athens, do you think?",
        "Q: Did your parents -- they continued in Athens after the war?",
        "Q: And that would have been what, 1949, or something like that?",
        "Q: And your father tried to get the -- was it Leviathan-Moudzoukos factory going again --",
        "Q: But that didn\u2019t -- ultimately did not work out?",
        "Q: And now let\u2019s go back to your mother, and continue to tell me her story from the 1940\u2019s on.",
        "Q: They weren\u2019t really friends.",
        "Q: So that she lost some of her faith in humanity?",
        "Q: How important was she to your father, and to his state of mind, did he count on her utterly?\nWas his mood dependent on her support? What was their relationship like?",
        "Q: And what ti -- at what -- what age would she be -- or what -- in what years was this taking\nplace?",
        "Q: Did she see lots of -- of your sister, Yola?",
        "Q: I wish you\u2019d had wedding photos for her.",
        "Q: The best.",
        "Q: How did she -- how did she die?",
        "Q: Your -- your grief would be greatest and theirs was beginning to heal, I suppose, by then.",
        "Q: No, I meant that the --",

        "Answer: My name is Paulette Moudzoukos Nehama. I was born in Volos, Greece, on September\n12, 1933.",
        "A: My parents was -- my father was Anselmos Moudzoukos, and he was born in Volos. And my\nmother was Thalia, Levi was her maiden name, Moudzoukos, and she was also born in Volos.\nMy parents were first cousins, which makes the whole family thing very interesting. They got\nmarried in 1921, and they had two children, my sister, who was born in 1923, and myself 10\nyears later, who was born in 1933, as I said.",
        "A: I haven\u2019t heard of anybody else, but it\u2019s certainly something permitted in the Jewish religion.\nThis was the first time I heard of first cousins getting married.",
        "A: Well, their -- their parents were from Halkeela, which is in Emvia. When exactly did they\ncome to Volos, I\u2019m not sure, but they -- all their children were born in Volos.",
        "A: No, they were Romaniot, which means they were Jews from very, very old time, who settled\nin Greece. They didn\u2019t come from Spain.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: They got married when -- when mother was 22, and my father was 23. They settled in Volos,\nso that\u2019s where they lived all their lives. They had a small house. They were very close to the\nfamily, and those there 1s still in Greece. Families have houses very close to each other,\nsometimes a three level home, and each family has one level. So they -- they lived there. My\ngrandparents had built a factory, and this was a textile factory. It was finished in 1906, and about\n1920, I think the factory, the grandparents retired, and my father and his brother took over the\nfactory in Volos, which was called Leviathan Moudzoukos, and company.",
        "A: There were three other factories in Volos. One was also a textile factory, and one was a\nhardware thing. My father\u2019s factory was by -- there was the largest. It had -- it produced material,\nthey called it cashmere, which was material for men\u2019s suits, and women\u2019s clothes -- means\nwomen\u2019s suits. And they imported the yarn from England. And it was nationally known, and\ninternationally known.",
        "A: That is true, yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: \u2019'm not sure.",
        "A: Yes, but I think my father\u2019s factory was much, much higher both in production, and in\nexports.",
        "A: Between 900 and 1200. And they were running three shifts, the factory never stopped. And\nthe legend has it that there is a big chimney, which is every morning at five o\u2019clock he would go\noff to wake up the workers, to come to work. This was nice alarm clock.",
        "A: So the whole wallas knew, and it\u2019s said that the chim -- the Moudzoukos chimney 1-is ringing,\nmust be five o\u2019clock.",
        "A: No, it was like a big, huge -- like a chimney -- huge, and it will go on, like woo, woo, woo.",
        "A: In that region, definitely, and in Greece. Not all over Greece, but it\u2019s well known.",
        "A: No. No, the tailoring was done elsewhere. People will buy yards of material, and will have\nother seamstress, or a tailor, who would make suits.",
        "A: No. Unfortunately, there\u2019ve been many mishaps after the war. First of all production stopped\nbecause we couldn\u2019t get the material from England. There were no -- there was no way to do\nthat. Then we had to go into hiding, and the factory closed because also the Germans took over.\nAnd they destroyed some of the machinery, and some of it became barracks for the troops. So\nthere was no way the factory could operate. After the war it was in very bad shape, and there was\nno money to start it over, but somehow the bank gave us a loan, and we started, but with half or a\nquarter of the people, and the production was very limited. So it was kind of limping for a war --\na while. Then, for several years it was a real, real struggle to -- to make it go. Material was\ndifficult to get, and general the economic conditions were too bad. So finally the bank\nrepossessed it, and that was the end of that factory. It became a warehouse for grain for the\nwhole region, and now they have made it into technical schools. There\u2019s a gimna -- gimnasium,\nwhich is like a high school, and also technical schools for the rich. But the interesting thing 1s,\nthey kept the facade, which was in -- 1t was, I mean architecturally it was a very -- it was the\nthing of the time. The roof was kind of slanted, and that they kept, but they also kept the name,\nand they call it Moudzoukos Technical Schools. There\u2019s also a bus stop called Moudzoukos stop.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Okay, my father was working with his father in the factory. My mother was a homemaker,\nand a socialite. Her role was to have teas for the ladies, she did a tremendous amount of\nvolunteer work in Volos. She worked in the orphanage, and another kind of -- of -- what call this,\nand I always remember that she had teas in the house, and all these ladies will come, and there\nwere beautiful things like cakes and cookies, and that we have to dress up, and come and say\nhello to the ladies, and curtsy, which I didn\u2019t like. And so she was a busy lady.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Yes, it was a social life that she had, very social. And that was expected more or less of the\nwomen of her stature, because we were quite wealthy. We had a maid, and a cook, and we had sa\n-- | had a nanny, and later a governess. So -- but my mother always supervised them, everything\nwas absolutely perfect.",
        "A: She was there most of the time, yes. When I would come home, I would go with my nanny to\nthe park, or swim in the summertime, but she was home at lunchtime. And when I would to go\nbed, she would be there. My parents took trips to Austria. They often traveled to Switzerland and\nAustria. So there were extended periods of time that they were not there. But my grandmother\nwas there, and of course, the household staff, and my sister, who was older, and I was relying on\nher.",
        "A: Well, I never met my father\u2019s mother, she died before I was born, but my mother\u2019s mother\nlived with us.",
        "A: Oh yeah, there was plenty of stability, absolutely.",
        "A: Well, my older sister was like a mother to me, because she always took the role of discipline\nme. And I always wanted to be where she was. If she had friends over, I wanted to be in that\ngroup. And she didn\u2019t want me to be there. Her friends were marvelous, they would ask me to\ncome and stay, and talk to them, but she didn\u2019t want me in there. She -- she was caring, very\ncaring for me. But she was an older person to me at the time. You know, she was 21, I was 10, so\nthat makes a big difference.",
        "A: My Hebrew name is Esther, which is my maternal grandmother\u2019s name. My maternal\u2019s --\nyeah, grandmother\u2019s name. The name Paulette, I think, comes from Paulette Goddard, my\nmother loved her. She is the actress, and she just adored that woman. So I think that\u2019s why she\nnamed me Paulette.",
        "A: I was -- my name was Pauletta in Greek. Sometimes they would call me Paulettiki, which\nmeans little Paulette, and sometimes they still do, when I go to Greece. They call me Paulettik:.\nBut mostly Paulette.",
        "A: My sister\u2019s name is Yolanda, and we call her Yola. Her Hebrew name -- I mean, she 1s named\nafter my paternal grandmother, her name was Santhi. Well, the English translation will be\nblondie, which is kind of funny. But -- but she was called Yola.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right, it\u2019s a tradition. And you name children even when the grandparents are not dead. In the\nAshkenazis you don\u2019t do that. In the Sephardic and Romaniots tradition, you can name children\nafter living grandparents, or living uncles or aunts, yeah.",
        "A: Well, I remember it was wonderful. I -- I loved the house we lived, we had a beautiful house,\nand a wonderful garden that smelled wonderful because we had such nice trees, like lemon trees\nand orange trees and beautiful roses. So it was always very pleasant to be outside, and be there. I\nhad friends, lots of other children. My governess, who spoke French, and I had to speak French\nwith her, would take me to the park, and there would be other children there, and we would play\nall sorts of things. In the summer I would go swimming every day. We would take little train\nfrom Volos, which would go up to the mountain of Pilion, but it would stop at the beach called\nAnaboros, and we would get off. There were -- the wagons were regular wagons [indecipherable |\nthere were two of them that were opened, so it was like a coach, and that\u2019s where I sat. And I\nloved it, because I could se -- see, and I could see everything.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, it was gorgeous. I never wanted to get out.",
        "A: Greek was what we spoke at home, but also we spoke French, because my mother has been\neducated in Switzerland, in Lausanne, and she wanted us to learn French. So we spoke French at\nhome with my mother, and with the governess. So at the age of five I was very fluent in French.\nThese were the only two languages I spoke. Of course, now I know English.",
        "A: I think there was business going there, one of the reasons they went. They had business with\nI\u2019m -- I\u2019m not sure with whom, but there wa -- they were business trips combined with -- with\npleasure.",
        "A: No, we did not keep kosher. I don\u2019t think we ate pork, but otherwise we ate everything. I went\nto the synagogue with my mother on special occasions to take oil to the synagogue. This was a\npractice that is a good deed. You would take oil to the synagogue for the lamps, because there\nwere no candles. And I would go with my mother. But I did not go to services. My father would\ngo.",
        "A: My mother would go to the high holidays with my father.",
        "A: I remember Passover. But we also celebrated Greek Easter, as well. We were always invited\nto someplace where they were roasting a ham, which is a very traditional kind of thing for Greek\nEaster. So we were very much part of the whole community.",
        "A: I think I felt Greek all along. I started feeling Jewish when I joined the Brownies, and ma -- I\nmust have been like six years old, probably, or maybe younger. And the meetings were on\nSaturday, and I remember my grandmother said, \u201cThat\u2019s bad. You don\u2019t go to meetings on\nSaturdays, because you are Jewish.\u201d But I insisted, and my mother didn\u2019t think it was terrible, so\nI did go. But when we were asked to bring a needle and a thread, because we had to learn how to\nsew a button, and I actually had forgotten to bring it, and the -- the leader said to me, \u201cWhere is\nyour thread and button?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t sew on Saturdays.\u201d So I claimed my Jewishness,\nand of course, she couldn\u2019t say anything.",
        "A: No, I was the only one.",
        "A: Actually, they -- I don\u2019t remember any other Jewish friend. No, maybe one, I remember one.\nIt was mostly Greek Orthodox.",
        "A: Absolutely, yes. My father was also president of the Jewish community, so -- I mean, we did\nhave very strong Jewish component in the family, we just not very religious, let\u2019s put it this way.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. Yeah. A lot of them were immigrants from Asia man -- minor. They had\nemigrated in Volos, in fact my father was instrumental in building homes for them. And he\nemployed a lot of these people in the factory.",
        "A: Asia minor, Turkey.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, yeah, I\u2019m sure they moved west, but also I think their -- their lives were threatened, so\nthat\u2019s why they left.",
        "A: Well, I think Yamala the Turk came, and of course, a lot of people had to -- to leave the area.\nAlthough he did make many changes in the region, but one of the changes was that he has --\nforeigners had to -- to leave. And there was a massacre also, at the time. So people hoo -- ran for\ntheir lives.",
        "A: That is right. It was very comfortable, it was very steady and predictable. And it was lavish.\nMy parents would give big parties, there was -- there were always a lot of people around. They\nwere very well known, and it was like, you know, a constant stream of people coming through\nour house, or going places. I was a child, and of course, children were not to mingle with adults,\nso I didn\u2019t participate in all these kind of things, but I remember the excitement. What I\nremember was that my parents bought a summer home tn -- in Calanilla, which 1s part of the\nPilion mountain, but it\u2019s down by the sea. And we would go there for weekends, and I remember\nthat we packed the food in big baskets, and then went -- we would get on the train, and then the -\n- the man who was taking care of the estate would come on his buggy and horse, and pick us up\nfrom the train station, and take us back to the -- we used to call it villa, to the villa. And that was\none of my favorite times. I just loved it there.",
        "A: Yes. In -- in the summer we stayed for a month, or two, or maybe more. Maybe we went in\nthe winter, I don\u2019t remember, but it was short period of time.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No. First of all, girls were not Bat Mitzvahed until much, much, much later in Greece, so this\nwas unheard of. So there was no particular training, there was no Sunday school as we call it, or\nHebrew school. The training was at home, basically.",
        "A: Well, it was -- I think a combination of things with my grandmother, it was my parents. But I\nremember my grandmother was quite s -- had very strong opinions about things, and she would\nalways say that you know, this is not Jewish, this is not the Jewish way. But she had no formal\neducation either. Actually, she went up to fourth or fifth grade, and -- but she had a very strong\nfeeling of who she was.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s true, but she was also a sickly child, so -- in her younger years. She -- I guess if\nyou were sick you didn\u2019t go to school, it was as simple as that. So that was it. Her mother died\nwhen she was very young, she was like three or four, and she was raised by her brothers, and her\nsister, who was my other grandmother, and a bit spoiled.",
        "A: Ah --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: She used to say I was her favorite grandchild, of course she had three. But I wasn\u2019t very\nhappy with her, because she always mingled a lot in my life. And I slept in the same room she\ndid, we had one room, and we shared it, and of course I wanted to have all my toys out, and\nevery night I had to put them back. And this will interfere with the story I had in my mind. I\nwould take my dolls and everything else, and set them outside -- and there was a story\n[indecipherable] I had imagined. And she would make me put them back, and I didn\u2019t like that.",
        "A: No. She had all the privileges of the firstborn.",
        "A: Yes. Food was a very important part of our lives, and there was -- there were season things, I\nremember. You could not go to the grocery store and buy tomatoes in the wintertime. First of all,\nyou -- you had to go to the grocery store, or to the produce store and buy things, so there were\nseveral stops to buy all these things. What I remember, we had women who worked in that\nhousehold from the mountain of Pilion. And their parents will come to visit, and they would\nbring these wonderful baskets of cherries, or fresh strawberries, or figs. And they smelled so\ngood, they were just wonderful, and I always loved it when they came to visit with their\ndaughters, and they would bring all these fresh fruit.",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know. Probably yes, but I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t been there for a long time, so I\ncan\u2019t -- but I also remember the -- the way they came, they came in little white baskets, or\nbamboo baskets. And they were covered with fig leaves, so the fruit will stay moist. And it was\nvery, very attractive to look at this.",
        "A: Yeah, I think -- I don\u2019t remember particularly celebrating Christmas, but it was like a\ngathering, like a family gathering, all people will come, and we\u2019ll have a nice meal. I don\u2019t know\nwhether we had turkey, I don\u2019t remember that. New Year\u2019s Eve, or New Year\u2019s Day was always\nspecial. It still is in Greece. You exchange presents on New Year\u2019s Day, so that was fun. Easter\nwas one thing. Tha -- that was basically -- yeah, there were special foods. There was always\nsome wonderful kind of desserts, and other things that my mother -- my mother was an excellent\ncook. I mean, she was terrific, and I loved everything she ate -- everything she made, I mean.\nWhat I remember also, there was a hierarchy, you know, in my house, so when we sat around the\ntable, the food was passed by the maids, first to my grandmother, then to my mother, then to my\nfather, then to my sister, and I was always the last one to be served. So I remember I always\nliked chicken livers, so -- you know, there was -- the chicken liver was gone, or -- by then. Or I\nwanted something -- I always wanted something that I didn\u2019t have, because I was the youngest. I\nate more slowly, so sometimes, you know, the table would be cleared, and I would still be eating.\nThings like that. So I had a very s -- a very good sense that I was the youngest, and I had to\ncompete with everybody.",
        "A: Well, she -- she was, I guess, older, and they were expecting more from her, you know. They\ndidn\u2019t expect much from me, other than to be a very polite, very well-behaved child.",
        "A: I was six years old, and I went straight to first grade. There were no pre-schools those days.\nAnd loo -- when I went to first grade, a month later the Italian war broke out. And school was\ndismissed for awhile. The male teachers were all gone to war, and from then on it\u2019s a whole\ndifferent story, because we had to leave Volos. Our house was taken by the navy, because it was\njust facing the sea, just about a block from the sea, and it was a good observation point. So we\nhad to leave, pack our things within 24 hours, we had just finished arranging the whole -- whole\nhousehold, we had just moved to this apartment. And I still remember the wax, and the clean and\nshiny place. And we had to leave, and put our things in storage, because the Italians were\ncoming.",
        "A: I was six years old.",
        "A: Yes, they did shield me, they were very protective of me. I was very anxious about this war. I\nremember when I went in school the day the war -- we heard the -- about the war, all the children\n-- the older children anyway, were telling us that people get killed in the war, that men leave\ntheir homes, and go to battle, they get injured. And I was very worried about my father. So when\nthe principal told us that there would be no school that day, and they didn\u2019t know if there was\ngoing to be school the next day, I ran home crying, asking my mother if my father was going to\nbe the -- in the war, if he was going to be in the army. Well, my father was 40 -- 42 I think then.\nSo my mother calmed me down and reassures me that this wasn\u2019t going to happen, and that I\ndidn\u2019t have anything to worry about, we\u2019ll all be together, we\u2019ll be fine. There may be a war, but\nwe'll be safe. And that was something that I remember very vividly.",
        "A: That was in October of \u201940, 1940. School had started September, 1940, so it was almost a\nmonth later.",
        "A: The next years -- I remember we -- we stayed -- we moved to Agria, which is a suburb, or it\u2019s\none little village by the sea, not far from Volos. It\u2019s one of the first villages of the Pilion\nmountain, but it\u2019s down very low, by the sea. We moved there. It was also my grandmother, my\naunt, who had come from Salonika with her sons, and her husband. So, it was all of us. Now\nthat\u2019s --",
        "A: My --",
        "A: My sisters -- my mother\u2019s sister. Her son Raymond was 11 months older than me, so he was a\ngood companion, great. I made him played with dolls. He -- he was very accommodating. He\nwas a great guy. So anyway, so we moved to Agria, we rented a place, and we stayed there for, I\ndon\u2019t know, the whole summer. Then we returned to Volos, but shortly after, they started\nbombarding Volos, being a port, this was a prime target. And I remember the bombs falling, and\nhaving to run into the shelter. I was quite scared at time. Then we would come out of the shelter,\nand we will see all sorts of disasters.",
        "A: Okay, the -- the bombing was by the British. The shelter was at the basement of the building,\nand I have a feeling if the building collapsed, you know, we wouldn\u2019t be that safe there, but\neverybody thought they were. So everybody who lived in that apartment building would go\nthere, and also people from the outside, if they happened to hear the siren, that people had to go\nhiding, and they would come, although they didn\u2019t live there. And would stay as long as -- as\nlong as we heard the siren again, which meant that the danger is over, and out you go. Inspect the\ndamage.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember taking nothing. Maybe a blanket, possibly. You had to run fast, there was\nnothing to take, because these things don\u2019t last a tremendous amount of time, as far as I\nremember. I think maybe an hour, maybe two. So that was it.",
        "A: Well, I think it was -- 1t was a protection from -- from -- na --",
        "A: Well then, it was a worry. There were curfews. There were precautions taken, you could not\nhave lights at night. We had to put panels with black -- dark paper -- with black paper at the\nwindows so no light would fall through. You couldn\u2019t go out past six o\u2019clock or seven o\u2019clock.\nSo things started changing, people were more anxious. When the Italians came, I was fully aware\nthat they were the enemy, and although they were not particularly terrible to Jews, they were still\nan occupying force, and I was very patriotic, those days. But I also remem -- remember, that was\nin \u00b041, when there was a famine, and I remember it very clear. We did not particularly suffer\nfrom lack of food, although we didn\u2019t have the kind of food we used to have before the war. But\nwhen we got food, my mother will hide it, because Italians wi -- would raid the house and look\nfor food. And she would hide things in -- I remember in a great, big pot of gardenias. She would\nput potatoes, or something, I forget in a pot, or sacks of flour in a big pot, and then put soil, and\ngardenias on top. Or other things. But I remember they would come and lift the mattresses, and\nlook under -- under the mattress to see if there was anything hiding in there.",
        "A: Yes. People were really hungry those days. I would see people fall in the streets from hunger.\nChildren. I sti -- I still remember children looking anorectic, you know, this pale, yellow, a green\ncolor almost. And just walking and collapsing. It was terrible, absolutely terrible. As I said, I\ndon\u2019t think we -- we were hungry, that -- as to not having food, but we certainly didn\u2019t have\nmeat. We didn\u2019t have eggs, which was a constant supply in the household. We had a lot of beans\nand chick peas, vegetables, whatever vegetables we can get.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Well, I think the people in the mountain didn\u2019t suffer that much because the earth produced,\nand many of them had also animals they could slaughter. They had chickens, lamb, whatever.\nBut it was the people in the city that couldn\u2019t find food.",
        "A: I think 1t was mostly because the Italians were taking all the food, but I\u2019m sure that also, you\nknow, supplies couldn\u2019t come, yes.",
        "A: It was considerable, not only in Volos, but also in Athens and other parts of Greece, yes.",
        "A: No, the Italians did not take any measures against the je -- Jews. First of all, in 1940 through\n\u201943, it was just the Italians. It was in \u00b043 that Italy capitulated, and then the Germans took over.\nNo, there was absolutely nothing. I remember there was a big, sort of a club that my father used\nto go there, and my mother, and occasionally sh -- I would go, which wasn\u2019t far from my house,\ncalled Exorise thekey, they had the restaurant there, there was a movie theater. And the Italians\nhave taken this, and I guess they lived there, but there were also Italians outside guarding the\nplace, and every time I would pass by, the Italian will say to me, bambina, bambina, and would\ntake candy to give me. Will reach in his pocket, and show me the candy, and I would just walk\npast him, you know, I just didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with him. And so, you know, me --\nI mean -- but I -- but I remember some things. I remember a man being beaten with a gun, with\nthe back of the gun. I don\u2019t know what he did, but I remember that an Italian was really beating\nhim up. This was --",
        "A: Yeah, it was in the street, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, of course, yes.",
        "A: Right. Volos was under Italian re -- you see, Greece was occu -- was divided in three parts. It\nwas the German sector, which was mostly Salonika, and in the north Athens, Volos, were under\nItalian occupation, and then Macedonia, and Face were under Bulgarian occupation. The Italians\nwere by far the mildest occu -- you know, occupying force. But I -- we left Volos in 19 -- in the\nspring of 1943, before the Germans arrived, and we went to Athens. So I never saw Germans in\nVolos.",
        "A: Well, I think because -- you see, in \u201943, nothing much was happening yet, but there were\nrumors about Salonika. My father was a very well informed person, and saw that probably\nsomething was going to happen. So he wanted us to be safe. We could not hide in Volos,\neverybody knew us. Although people were wonderful to us, and very friendly, and very willing\nto put us up for as long as we needed to. We still were -- everybody knew us, so there was no\nway of -- of hiding. Of course, there were the mountains, the mountain Pilion that a lot of Jewish\npeople from Volos went to. But that wasn\u2019t safe either for us, because as I said, we were quite\nwell known, so Pilion wasn\u2019t that terribly far. That\u2019s why we left and went to Athens, where we\ncould be somewhat anonymous in there.",
        "A: Well, they didn\u2019t share anything with me. I was quite young at the time. But I was told that\nwe had to move almost like two or three days before to move, that we were going to Athens. And\nthis was a place I always wanted to go. I always thought of Athens as the magnificent city. So --\nbut then when I realized that we were not coming back to Volos, it wasn\u2019t just a trip, I started\nthinking differently, and getting a little anxious. Not much was explained to me, and as a result\nof that, my imagination was wild. I would think all sorts of things, and of course, I couldn\u2019t\ndiscuss them, because it was like this is for the good of us, or this kind of thing. There kind of\nanswers were -- actually didn\u2019t give me much to go with. I think --",
        "A: For me it did, to a certain extent, because I could never get a straight answer of what was\ngoing on, and I knew a lot was going on.",
        "A: Yes, yes. I can see the change of mood, I can see the worry. I mean, I could sense it, but I\ncouldn\u2019t discuss it, yes.",
        "A: Right. When we left Volos on that sleek, little cargo boat, with forged papers, actually, to -- to\ngo to Athens, I was 10.",
        "A: That\u2019s true. We had different names, Greek Orthodox names. And my name was Paulik\nSanny. And they used to call me Polly, and sometimes I would forget and somebody would call\nme Polly, I wouldn\u2019t respond. I guess the -- the police would issue false identity card, because\nwhen we went -- we left Volos on this little, tiny boat full of sacks of flour and many rats, we --\nthe boat broke down, and we had to stop for a couple of nights in -- in the cape. There is -- you\nsee, Volos is like a gulf. The very tip of the -- of the gulf is called Trikery, which is a lovely little\nplace, but we had to stay there for about two or three nights until another boat will come and pick\nus up, and take us to Evian, and from there we went by car to Athens. So the whole trip took\nabout 10 days, maybe a week, but I think it was more like 10 days, because boats were\nunreliable.",
        "A: Yes, my parents, and my sister, and I. My grandmother -- maternal grandmother, my Aunt\nJulia, who is my mother\u2019s sister, with her husband and son, and one of our household persons\nwas with us.",
        "A: I think her name was Penny.",
        "A: Well, I guess she was everything. A little bit of everything, but she was very devoted to the\nfamily, and she said if the family was going to leave Volos, she was coming with us.",
        "A: No, no. She was one of the girls from the mountains. She probably wanted to go to Athens.",
        "A: No, I certainly wasn\u2019t privy, but I could see, I mean, the house is being dismantled, things are\nbeing moved to storage spaces, or some things are being shipped, and other things were given to\nfriends or neighbors for safekeeping. We didn\u2019t recover any of that, like paintings, or carpets. So\nI knew that we were moving. To me it was a little bit of an adventure, to be -- being on a boat,\nand the boat breaking down, and all that kind of stuff. I didn\u2019t particularly like to sleep on sacks\nof flour, and I was afraid of the rats. There were a lot of rats there.",
        "A: I think my sister was taking care of me. She would always make sure I was fine, and I wasn\u2019t\ntoo close to the edge of the -- of the boat, or I was -- I was -- well, she would talk to me, but --",
        "A: I\u2019m sure she was troubled. Now, how much troubled, I don\u2019t know. I think she was protective\nof my parents, so I think she tried not to show her anxiety much.",
        "A: I never discussed this with him, but I have a feeling he would never go anywhere other than\nGreece. I think --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. Although he never discussed it with me. I think --",
        "A: I never knew of anybody who came to the United States at the time. Some people went to\nPalestine, or Turkey.",
        "A: There was a friend of mine who was a little younger, and her family. And they went on a\nsmall boat, and unfortunately they left them -- there were other people with them, but they were\nleft on a -- on a rock. Supposedly the boat had trouble, and the man went up to -- went to fix the\nboat and never came back. And they were picked up much, much later, by another boat. But they\nstayed on that rock for maybe a week or so. So there were incidents like this, you would hear all\nover the place.",
        "A: They returned to Greece, and they went into hiding in Greece, yes.",
        "A: Okay, so we moved, as I said, we came on these two different boats that took about 10 days to\nget to Athens, and normally the trip is like two days at the most. In Athens my uncle, who was\nmy father\u2019s younger brother who lived there, had found a place for us. It was an apartment at --\nwe had one floor, my aunt and grandmother had another in the same building. And we went\nthere. It was spring, so I didn\u2019t go to school, because school would have been over pretty soon.\nAnd I guess we were trying to -- to get acquainted to -- to the city, and to -- to find our way\naround. There wasn\u2019t much we were doing as far as I was concerned. My only playmate was my\ncousin, who was I|1 years old -- I mean, 11 months older than me, and we were constant\ncompanions. I don\u2019t remember having friends, or being encouraged to -- to make friends. Since I\ndidn\u2019t go to school, of course I couldn\u2019t meet other children. Then, in September of 1943, we\nwent into hiding. And the events prior to this, I remember them very clearly. I had the mumps,\nand I was in bed, and the dining room was adjacent to the bedroom. So my -- all my aunts, and\nuncles came and they were having meetings with my parents in this dining room, and I could\nhear them whispering. I could not make out any words, but I knew something very serious was\ngoing on. And obviously they were planning where each one was going to go, what they were\ngoing to do, and it was like a big family meeting. My sister was in that -- in that meeting.\nOccasionally she would come out and check on me, to make sure I was all right, or put some hot\npads on my cheeks, which was the normal treatment. And then she would go back in the room.\nAnd when I would ask what is it that -- why are you all in there, and she would say, \u201cWell, we --\nwe just need to discuss some adult things. Don\u2019t worry, everything is fine.\u201d And but of course I\nworried, because I knew everything wasn\u2019t fine. So I remember that very, very clearly.",
        "A: I think the fact that they were hearing more and more things about the Germans coming to\nAthens, and I think it was about the time that Italy capitulated, and they probably knew that if\nGermans come, they would probably treat the Jews the same way they treated them in Salonika.\nSo some advance thinking, at least to have the plan, and if you need to use it, you use it. It was\nnecessary to do that time.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know for sure, but I have a feeling they probably did. Some decided the very last\nmoment to go somewhere, because this is something you don\u2019t want to believe that this going to\nhappen. It\u2019s pretty unbelievable. So most people denied as wildly exaggerating, or this isn\u2019t\ngoing to happen to us. But people with advanced thinking, and people who know about the\nworld, I guess, don\u2019t leave things to chances. And my father was one of these people.",
        "A: That is true. I don\u2019t remember mixing much with other people. We didn\u2019t have neighbors --\nactually, there was a lady but 1 -- who lived in the same building, but I think she was also Jewish.\nAnd we pretty much stayed with the family. I don\u2019t remember venturing out much -- I mean, not\n-- we were free to come and go, but I would always go out with someone, I would never go out\nalone. But there was no -- no particular friends that I remember at that time.",
        "A: Probably a month. Because we went into hiding in September of \u201943, and the meetings must\nhave been like a few -- a month, or maybe two at the most, before.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think we have any valuables, because I think a lot of the furniture was in there, in the\napartment when we arrived. It wa -- I don\u2019t think it was our furniture, I don\u2019t recall. So this\nprobably was a -- a furnished place when we arrived. As far as clothing, I think we took\nwhatever we needed, which wasn\u2019t much at the time. Maybe some books. I took my favorite\ndoll. I was a big doll person. And I guess that was it, but no utensils, or anything else, because\nwhen we were into hiding, we lived with other families, not Jewish families, Greek Orthodox\nfamilies, so they had their own household.",
        "A: Right, yeah. They all went into storage. As I said, some things went to friends or neighbors\nfor safekeeping. A lot of stuff we did not recover.",
        "A: Either they would move away, or some people even denied of -- I remember there was a\npainting that was the favorite painting of my mother\u2019s, and this woman denied that she ever had\nit. And it was an outright lie. So, things like that. I don\u2019t remember if we sold things. I can\u2019t\nrecall that. But I remember when we arrived in Athens we didn\u2019t have much. It was a big change,\ndefinitely.",
        "A: Well, I think it was a devastating thing to find that you cannot trust people, on top of\neverything else that\u2019s happening. At least there were people you could count on, and you cannot\ncount on them. And you really don\u2019t know to whom you can turn when things are bad. I think\nthat was the story in the -- the experience. How can she be so blatant, and say, we didn\u2019t get it,\nthey didn\u2019t give it to us.",
        "A: Okay, first of all, my father had found this place through a friend, a very good friend of his.\nHe had baptized the oldest child, by the name of Many Babella, and he knew the family well. So\nhe had talked to them, and they had agreed to take us. Of course, families could not -- families\ncould not be together if there were more than two, three people, because they could be easily\nspotted, and they had to disperse. My father went to some other family, and my mother and I,\nand sister, went to Calivare, which is a suburb of Athens, to this wonderful family of a couple,\nthe name was Pavella. And they had three children, a 15 year old, and one girl who was Kate,\nshe was 10, as I was, and a younger boy about six or seven, called Dimitris. My mother, sister,\nand I shared one room. So the three of us shared one room, my father was elsewhere, and we had\nour meals with the family, I was playing with the children, who were about the same age as I\nwas. I wasn\u2019t going to school, and my excuse was that I had appendicitis. And I wasn\u2019t supposed\nto go to school. This was what I was telling the children. Of course, they all wanted to see my\nincision, and there was no incision. Basically, I liked these kids, and they were just great, they\nwere warm, and would play all sorts of games, and we had a great connection. My mother would\ncommunicate with my father once a week by telephone, and this was like a coded message.\nWhen the news were bad, the message was, the patient is very sick. When the news was better, it\nwas that, well, the patient is doing better. So, this was a pre-arranged kind of code for them to\ncommunicate. My sister became good friends with the sister of the woman who hid us, the\nfamily there. She had a bakery right across from where we were. And my sister would go there\nsometimes, and also Adhero will come to -- to the house. She was very warm, and caring, and\noften will bring cookies from the bakery.",
        "A: Right, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, I couldn\u2019t go to school, because that involves being outside, and being in public. The --\nthe fear was that somebody may recognize us. Same thing for my mother and sister, we couldn\u2019t\nventure very far other than across the street to the bakery, because although we had left Volos,\nwhere we were very well known, and in Athens we were more -- more unknown people, it still\nthe possibility that somebody would recognize us, and mention our names, and then everybody\nwill be in great peril. Of course, the family that hid us was in danger by hiding us. These were\nwonderful people. He worked for -- the man of the family worked for a Greek newspaper, so he\ncould bring home news of what was going on. His wife was also a very good housekeeper,\ncaring for the children, and very nice, and my mother and Dasseia became friends. And even\nafter the war they would see each other. And there was great respect for each other. So there was\n-- there were good feelings there, and a good connection. As I said, we couldn\u2019t go out, we\ncouldn\u2019t do things that we normally used to do. But maybe for my mother this was a big loss, but\nfor me it was fun because there were children to play with. At some point, I think 1t was probably\naround December, which was like three months after we went into hiding to the Pavella family,\nmy father joined us. I guess he had become very lonely in the family he was with in Athens, and\nhe decided to come to be with us. Of course, this was with the agreement of the family we lived\nin. But shortly after, I remember it very clearly, one evening, Adhero, the -- the wife\u2019s sister,\nwho had the bakery, came running to the house, and saying, \u201cYou must leave immediately. I\nheard from somebody that they know you are Jewish, and you are hiding.\u201d We used to tell, or the\nfamily used to tell that we were relatives, because sometimes we would be out in the yard, and\npeople would ask, who are these people? They say they were relatives. And this man, who\nhappened to be drunk, and he was in a tavern, in a Greek tavern, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t get fooled, these\npeople are not relatives of the Pavella family, they are Jews, and they are hiding.\u201d So it was\nheard by everybody who was in that tavern, and Adhero happened to be there. And she ran and\ntold us to leave immediately. Well, the first one who left was my father, because he was in\ngreater danger. And he walked from Calivare to Athens with the man of the family, Milanos\nPavella. He wouldn\u2019t let him go by himself. He took him on foot. And the next night, all three of\nus, my mother, my sister, and I, when it became dark, we also left with him. He came back, of\ncourse, after taking my father to a friend\u2019s house in Athens. He came back and took us to -- to\nAthens. Now this is about, I don\u2019t know, probably -- I remember walking for a long, long, long\ntime in the night. I don\u2019t know exactly how far it is, but I\u2019m sure it must be like six miles, 10\nmiles from Athens. So it\u2019s a long walk for a 10 year old. And we had put scarfs on our heads,\nand tied them so people wouldn\u2019t recognize us immediately. So when we go to Athens, we\nimmediately went where my father was, at the friend\u2019s house. Now these were very good friends,\nwho were notified, apparently, when this incident of somebody saying that we were Jews\noccurred. And they were looking for a place for us to go. But until they found a place, we\ncouldn\u2019t stay together, because they were in danger. So my sister went to a friend\u2019s house, one of\nher friends from Volos, that family lived in Athens, and they took her. And I went -- they took\nme to somebody\u2019s house in Athens, and all I remember, it was like a mansion, a huge place. And\nthere lived a man in a wheelchair. I think he was an old man, but here again [indecipherable]\nwrong, being 10 years old -- and a woman who was taking care of him. I don\u2019t think she was a\nrelative, I think she was a caretaker. And I was left there for 10 days by myself, not having\ncommunication with my family, not knowing what was going on, not knowing these people. I\nthink this man didn\u2019t talk to me, or if he did, it must have been one or two words, or maybe he\ncouldn\u2019t talk. I remember the woman feeding him, spoonfeeding him, so obviously he was pretty\nsick. And I was desperate. I was totally lost. I didn\u2019t know what happened to my parents, I didn\u2019t\nknow if they would ever pick me up. But the woman, the caretaker of this man was a very kind\nwoman, so when I would cry, she would try to comfort me, or tell me stories, or all sorts of\nthings, just to make me feel good about it. Well, in about 10 days, my sister came, and she said,\n\u201cWe have a place now. I\u2019m ga -- I\u2019m here to pick you up, to take you.\u201d I don\u2019t know if she had\ncalled before or not, I don\u2019t recall. But I took my little satchel of things, a couple of changes of\nclothe -- clothes, and my doll, and said good-bye and left. And we went -- we met again at this\nfriend\u2019s house, and we went, I think in installments again, my father went first, or we went first,\nto the second house, where we spent about seven months. This was in Kipserly. It was the family\nof Andonis Vayas, who was an officer in the navy. And they had -- he and his wife had the little\ngirl about three years old. And I think there was a grandmother who was deaf, and also lived in\nthe house, but we hardly saw her. She stayed in her room for the most time. Anyway, so it was a\nnew adjustment. We had a very large room for the four of us, so there was like a -- a screen put\nin the middle, so on one side where my parents were sleeping, and on the other side was my\nsister and I. We were sharing the other side of the room. And we were closer to the street, it was\non a street level, and closer to the street. I slept on a cot. And I remember at night I would hear\nthe Germans patrolling, and I could hear their boots going by my window. And I would stop\nbreathing. I was so petrified, because I thought they were coming for us. And I would pull the\nblanket over my head, and stop breathing, I -- until I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t do it any more, and I\nhad to breathe. So then slowly I will pull the blanket off my head, and I would listen very\ncarefully, and by then the steps with the boots -- because I knew -- I knew they were boots,\nwould disa -- have disappeared, or they would have gone away, or they were far, so I knew we\nwere safe. This was my biggest fear, that they would come and get us. Here again, I didn\u2019t go to\nschool. My father tried to teach me some arithmetic, and I think I had two books, \u201cRobinson\nCrusoe,\u201d and another one, which was a rather gloomy book called, \u201cThe Orphans of Scotland.\u201d\nAnd it was nothing but -- you know, five orphans, or maybe more, whose father was in prison,\nand how they got him out of prison in a basket, and things like that. But it was a rather sad book,\nif I remember correctly. Then I got hold of a children\u2019s magazine heyou -- I think it was a\nweekly magazine. I don\u2019t know who gave it to us, or how I got hold of it, and it had wonderful\nstories, and this was very nice for me too, to read. Other than that, think my imagination went\nwild, because I used to play in the backyard, and all I would do 1s pick up bamboo stick, and\npretend it was a gun, and was shooting all the Germans. And we were free, I thought, by me\ndoing that. Games like this. Occasional I will play with a three year old little girl. But that was\nabout it. The backyard had a fence, and the next house was also a two story house, I think, and in\nthe balcony there was a little girl who would be out practically every day, and playing with dolls,\nand other toys. And I would go next to the fence, and we started talking. And she would always\ninvite me to go to her house to play. But of course, I knew I couldn\u2019t, so I would find all sorts of\nexcuses that I couldn\u2019t go. But one time I couldn\u2019t bear it any more, so I jumped the fence. On\nour side of the yard, the fence was reasonably manageable, I could go over it. But when I\njumped, it was very high on her side. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t break a leg. So I jumped the fence, and\nwent to her apartment and played there for awhile. Of course, nobody in my family knew that I\nleft the house. But when it was time for me to go back, I just couldn\u2019t climb the fence, it was too\nmuch. So finally I decided I had to go around the corner, because this house was around the\ncorner. So I came, and rang the doorbell, and of course the woman opened the door, and she was\nSO surprised to see me. And my mother came, and she was absolutely pale when she saw me. I\ngot a good spanking for that, I remember. I wasn\u2019t supposed to -- to leave the house, especially\nnot telling anybody. But it was that urge to be with other children, to be able to play, to be -- to\nhave a normal life like any other child that made me do that.",
        "A: Oh sure, that was.",
        "A: Yes, it was a very hard experience. It was a hard experience because I\u2019ve never been alone\nwith strangers. I was -- I didn\u2019t know -- I had the feeling that -- oh, I was afraid that maybe my\nparents were taken by the Germans, and I couldn\u2019t see them again, or they wouldn\u2019t come back\nfor me, or they would leave me there forever. That was the feeling. It was a sense of\nabandonment, but I\u2019m sure they had no other choice to -- to send me any place else, I mean, I\ndon\u2019t know what went on, and how it was decided for me to go to this man\u2019s house. Obviously\nnot everybody is willing to take a 10 year old under such circumstances. You know, 10 year olds\ntalk, and jump fences. So they are dangerous. But it was -- it was a very sad time for me.",
        "A: Well, I think the fear of abandonment has stayed. And at different times I have felt it quite\nstrongly. Also, I think at times when I think a child being left alone, although there were people -\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Well, after the second one, yeah, we went to a third one because the -- my father was taken by\nthe Greek Nazis -- Greek SS, as they used to call them. They were watching the house in -- the\nthird house, and -- no, actually, the second house in Kipserly. And one day they burst in,\npretending they were people from the power company, and they wanted to read the meter, but\nthey came in with guns, and they were asking for Moudzoukos. And they took him, and\nfortunately he had money on him. He had British pounds that were all sewn around his west --\nwaistband, and he paid them. And they told him that he and his family had to leave within five\nhours, and they didn\u2019t guarantee his safety, or anybody else\u2019s safety. So when they came to get\nmy father -- panic-stricken my mother, and my sister, and me -- my sister went next door -- here\nagain, she jumped from a terrace to the next terrace, where there were people that had help us\nfind this house as well. And this was in -- somebody in the -- I think in the Supreme Court, or --\nhe was in charge, anyway, and we knew them. So she notify them, and they notified another\nfriend, who immediately came -- nearby there was a market, and he was watching the house to\nsee the activity and what was going on. And as soon as they brought my father back, he came in\nthe house and took us to his house. And from there he found another place for us. So I think we\nstayed overnight, or maybe a couple of days, until a second hou -- a third house was found. And\nthat\u2019s when we moved again.",
        "A: Yes, they were Greek Orthodox families, they were also compensated financially. Because\nthere were expenses, you know. We had to eat, and they had to eat. And of course, there was\nsome danger in there. So they were being compensated.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the answer. I have a feeling that at the time, it was just for expenses, but I know\nthat after the war, they were very much helped by my father when things started going much\nbetter. Because I remember this navy officer who would come often, and ask for a loan, or things\nlike that. And then my father would forgive the loan. So probably it was after the war, but I -- I\ndon\u2019t know for sure.",
        "A: Absolutely. They were very courageous people to do that, and they were great human beings\nto be able to -- to help somebody else at such a risk, yes, because if anybody was found to be\nsheltering Jews, could be shot, he and his family. So, it was a great danger to have Jews in the\nfamily.",
        "A: Their reasons for what?",
        "A: Yeah, I think that that was the main thing, that this was common decency. I remember\nPavellas, the first house we went, when he learned that this guy said something about us being\nJewish, and hiding, and you know, he came to notify us. She said, \u201cYou know, the -- the Nazi\nmay come and take them.\u201d And Milanos said, \u201cOver my dead body.\u201d So he had a very sense -- a\nvery good sense of protecting us, of not letting anything happen to us. That\u2019s why he dro -- he --\nhe walk with my father from Calivare to Athens, and the next day he walk back again with my\nsister -- my mother, and my sister, and myself. So, I mean, he was a man who would take it very\nseriously that this was the lives of people that were under his care, and he wouldn\u2019t let anything\nhappen, I mean, as far as he could control that.",
        "A: Right. That\u2019s right, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Also -- also, the children did not know we were Jewish. Only the eldest daughter, Many, who\nwas 15, knew. She knew. But the children also -- the family had to sacrifice, they had to give up\na room. You know, I mean this was a very small house, it wasn\u2019t a huge place, it wasn\u2019t a\nmansion. So they had to give up a room for us to stay. They had to share the bathroom, they had\nto -- to share the kitchen, or whatever. So they made sacrifices as well.",
        "A: For me, it was a good time, because I had company. I mean, it was great to have the children,\nwho were fun children to be with. The chores were like sitting -- setting the table, or things like\nthat. We all had dinner together, we all ate together. I think the cooking was done by my mother,\nand by Desseia. Desseia would do the shopping, or sometimes Milanos, the father, would do the\nshopping. And they would take turns cooking. And as far as cleaning, I think we were\nresponsible for cleaning our room, making our beds, doing the laundry, or setting it out, I don\u2019t\nremember, in those days you were just washing, you know, by hand. So I think things were\ndivided that way. For me, I remember I would wait impatiently until the children will come\nhome from school, because that was the fun time I could play with. During the day my mother\ntried to engage me in teaching me how to embroider, or how to sew, and I had no interest\nwhatsoever in any of these sedentary activities. Plus my eyes were not very good, so I couldn\u2019t\nconcentrate on a little hole there for hours. I -- I -- I may have had one or two books, but\nbasically I think I had a vivid imagination and I would make up stories. And when the children\nwill come, I will tell them stories, or they will tell me jokes, and this kind of thing. We didn\u2019t go\nout, but yet had a huge yard, and that was nice, because we could play outside.",
        "A: Oh, you had just not too many clothes. You just wore the same things over and over. I mean,\nyou washed them, but I didn\u2019t wash them, my mother washed them. But there were no new\nclothes, I mean, probably she would take the here -- sometimes I would get my sister\u2019s things,\nand she would hem them. But there was a 10 -- 10 year difference, so you can imagine that her\nclothes didn\u2019t quite fit me right, even if the hem was put up. So my biggest -- my happiest thing\nwhen she got engaged, was that I would have a new dress. That was a big thing.",
        "A: Right. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m sure it was very difficult for my mother, first of all because my father\nwas elsewhere, and for my sister, because she was older, and she could understand the dangers,\nand whatever was going on. So, since I didn\u2019t know that much about what was going on in the\nworld, you know, I wasn\u2019t particularly worried. I was worried about my father, and I wanted my\nfather to be with us, and I was told he eventually will be with us, but that was about it. I -- I\ndidn\u2019t feel deprived, although, you know, food was not really -- it was difficult to get food. So I\nremember some of the dishes, it was like cabbage with rice, and carrots. And to this day I make\nit, and I think exactly of -- of that time. I loved it, it was great dish. You know, I mean, meat,\neggs, fish probably were not available that much, and they were expensive. So, you know, when\nyou have a large family to feed, it\u2019s considerable. But yes, it wasn\u2019t a painful time for me. It was\nmore of a -- of an interesting time, or a fun time, I would think. But the other two places we\nwent, it was a more painful time, because number one, I lost the children, you know, I -- I didn\u2019t\nhave my friends any more. So that was a big loss when we left. And they -- I was asking Many\nwhen I saw her a couple of years ago, how was it for them when we left? And what did their\nparents tell them? And she said they missed us terribly, because we had become very connected.\nThe second house, the Vaia house, I was -- I was upset most of the time because -- a little bit of it\nwas boredom, a little bit of 1t was inability to go out and do things. Just -- I felt stagnated, there\nwasn\u2019t much to do. But I knew that everybody else was trying very hard to -- to put a good face\nfor the other person, so I was trying to be cheerful, so my parents won\u2019t get upset.",
        "A: She would have to go to the bakery across the street, at a time where the bakery wasn\u2019t\ncrowded, like two or three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, which 1s siesta time in Greece, to call around\nthat time. Occasionally, I was allowed to talk to my father, but here again it was very brief, and it\nwas like -- I was told never to mention names, like his name -- well, his name was Daddy, but\nnever to mention my sister\u2019s name is Yola, or things like that. And he would ask me how are\nyou, are you a good girl, or you know, things, very brief kind of things. And that was about it.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know anything. My parents probably knew what happened in Salonika, but I had no\nidea. I was kept very safe from information of that sort. And since my parents were not together,\nand they couldn\u2019t discuss it openly, I couldn\u2019t hear anything.",
        "A: No, most of it is what I heard. I actually saw a German kicking a man outside my window in\nthe second house where we were. I could hear the screams, and the shutters were always halfway\nclosed, and I could see this -- hear this scream, so I looked outside, and there was a German\nsoldier kicking a man -- to me it seemed like an old man -- many times. I don\u2019t know if he was a\nJewish man or not, but I remember feeling very angry that he was doing that. And then my\nmother came and pulled me away from the window, so I don\u2019t know what happened. But I kept\non thinking about this man for a long time, and I still do.",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely.",
        "A: No, I think it was common. People -- you see, Greek people are very kind, and very\nhospitalble -- hop -- hospitable. So to them, hiding somebody in need was not extraordinary,\nalthough it is extraordinary, it was you\u2019re a human being, I\u2019m a human being, we have to help\neach other, because if I were on your side, I would expect that you would do something like this.\nSo it was -- they were very generous people to do that, I mean, and very kind. Very kind.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know of any. I don\u2019t know of any.",
        "A: My mother would get the news about the Jews in code from my father only for a short period\nof time when my father was separate. But then he -- he came to live with us, and then the second\nhouse, and the third house he was with us, so we were all together. It was primarily the men of\nthe family that would go out and hear things, they would bring newspaper. I think there was a\nradio. I think radios were not allowed, certain stations were not allowed, and you had to take\nyour radio so it would be sealed, as they used to call it. But I remember hearing some news.\nThere was a small radio, and I remember my father putting his ear practically on the radio to -- to\nlisten. I don\u2019t know if it was BBC or whatever, but he would listen.",
        "A: Well, they used to block certain stations, so you couldn\u2019t listen to all those stations. And these\nwere the stations that would give you news, propaganda, and all sorts of things. You know, just\nkind of controlled the -- the stations you could use.",
        "A: Yes, that I knew, and quite often my imaginary games including me being a resistance fighter,\nbecause that bamboo stick that I carried on my shoulder was primarily killing Germans, and\noften it was being a resistance fighter, just fighting for freedom.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Okay, the -- the liberation came in 1944, October \u201944. So I was 11 years old. We were hiding\nfor four -- 13 months, or a little over 13 months. The news came, I think from the radio that we\nwere free, October 12\", in Athens, later in other places, going north, as the Germans started\nretreating. It was -- I think it was the radio, but I also think that the man of the house, of the third\nhouse, came and said, \u201cThe Germans are leaving, we are free.\u201d And I remember my sister and\nthe -- the daughter of the household, her name was Maria, she was older than me, but she was\ncloser to my sister age, and they were dancing. So we listened to the radio, and I think some\npeople also came to announce the freedom, that we were free now. They didn\u2019t know we were\nJewish, but they came to say the Germans have left, or are leaving. And it was going to be a big\ncelebration downtown in Athens. So my sister and Maria were going to go, and I wanted to go\nwith them. I was crying to go with them. They wouldn\u2019t let me because I was too young. And\napparently a lot of crowds were there, you know, so they could have let me go get a sense of\nwhat was going on, but anyway, they -- I couldn\u2019t go. So I stayed home with my parents, but\nYola, my sister, and Maria went, and they came home about 12 o\u2019clock, and they was telling us\nit was such a frenzy, 1t was wonderful, everybody was jumping and laughing, and it was -- it was\ngreat.",
        "A: Yes. For one thing we were free, but we had no place to go. We didn\u2019t have -- we couldn\u2019t go\nback to Volos because we didn\u2019t have a house there. The factory was not working. Here again,\ngood friends came to the rescue. We -- I think in about a week my parents were able to rent an\napartment in Athens, and friends lent us furniture, like folding cots, and folding tables, and\nfolding chairs, and mattresses. I slept on a mattress. I remember there was only one bed where\nmy grandmother, when she came from her hiding place, slept. Everybody else slept in cots, or on\na mattress on the floor. And we were reunited with my grandmother, my Aunt Julia, and\nRaymond my -- my cousin. But his father was taken to Bergen-Belsen, so he wasn\u2019t with them.\nHe eventually returned to Greece.",
        "A: He was hiding someplace in Athens, I\u2019m not quite sure where. But he was a Spanish citizen,\nso he had a sort of better treatment, as they called -- you know, the Spanish citizens were treated\ndifferently, the Jewish Spanish -- he was Sephardic -- were treated in a -- a little lenier way, let\u2019s\nsay, were taken to Bergen-Belsen.",
        "A: Only the ones who were Spanish citizens. If they were Greek citizens, no. Because Spain was\ntrying to negotiate with the Germans to get the citizens back, or to have a better treatment, and\nsomehow they were able to, up to a certain extent, not really, but they were a little more lenient.",
        "A: Well, he didn\u2019t talk much about his experiences there, other than he\u2019d say it was a horrible\ntime. I actually don\u2019t know his experiences there, but I thought he was a much sadder man than I\nknew him. He was quite a happy man before, and he wasn\u2019t -- he was very subdued, I thought,\nwhen he came back.",
        "A: Yeah, I think they did slave labor, right. But they were not cremated. I mean, they didn\u2019t go to\nthe crematorium.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: I think he was okay. I think he was all right with the family, yeah.",
        "A: Okay. We came out of hiding, and I was kind of lost. They tried to enroll me in public\nschool, which was not far from where we lived, and I think it was almost -- it must have been\nlike maybe fifth grade at the time. I should have been in fifth grade, but I skipped so much\nschool that I really didn\u2019t have the skills any more. I remember the class being huge. There must\nhave been like 70 children in that class, and I was taught a little obs -- I had no idea what they\nwere talking about, I didn\u2019t get any particular attention to -- to something. So I was very\nunhappy, and eventually, I don\u2019t know how much later, my parents put me in a private school\nwith a much smaller, you know, smaller classes, more attention from the teachers, and things like\nthat. At the time we didn\u2019t have money for private schools, and I know that my father\u2019s sister\nhelped for me to go to private school, I know that. So it was something very generous of her to\ndo. And I did like the school, it was -- the co-owners of that school were both British women,\nvery regimented, very disciplined, but basically it was a very, very good school, and it still exists\nin Greece. So once I were -- I was there then, I was able to -- to feel my way a little better.",
        "A: Hill, H-i-I-1.",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sure about that. I think there was a lot of anxiety I felt, because I would pick up, you\nknow, what the adults, and the other people around me felt. And although I didn\u2019t show it, I was\nalways a very private person as a child, and some of it was encouraged because I wasn\u2019t\nsupposed to be saying things to others. I mean, to my family I was supposed to say, but --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Yes, I think that was the fear. And I think that\u2019s why my parents weren\u2019t telling me too many\nthings, let alone that they felt I was too young to -- to be burdened, and worry about things like\nthat. But I did worry. I mean, I was a very sensitive child, so I could feel the moods of\neverybody. I mean, I could see my father -- I would enter that part of the room that he -- my\nparents had in the second house, where it was divided by a screen, and he would smoke\nconstantly. I mean, the room was so cloudy, it was hard to see him, because it was one cigarette\nafter the other. And that worried me. Not that I knew that cigarettes were not good for you, but\nhis -- his mood, his pensive mood, the heaviness was there.",
        "A: I think that was more of the case with me. I think even after we were liberated, we were very\nburdened because we had no money, we had lost the factory at the time. We had no furniture. So\nwe had to start life from the beginning, to pick up the pieces. And I think my parents were very\nconcerned that they were -- they didn\u2019t want -- I don\u2019t know about my sister, but they didn\u2019t\nwant me to be unhappy, and to have a bad childhood. Here we had everything, and they had\nplanned for everything, and here comes Hitler, and you know, he turns your life upside down. So\nI think they tried to shelter me, maybe a little too much, but I think I didn\u2019t grow up as fast as I\nthought I would have liked to.",
        "A: Okay. Schools progress normally except I had a great difficulty in school. Part of it was I\ndidn\u2019t have the skills to study, or I couldn\u2019t even do arithmetic. Things that you learn in third\ngrade, I had skipped second, third, and fourth grade, basically. Because also, during the Italian\nwar, school was a [indecipherable] you know, whenever. It was -- so it was very hard for me. I\ndidn\u2019t know the basics, let\u2019s put it this way. But I got up. But I always had this feeling that I was\nlagging, I was behind. And this was a very uncomfortable feeling for me. I was ashamed of it,\nthat I didn\u2019t know as much as the other children knew. My greatest extra-curricular activity was\njoining the Girl Scouts. You see, I always loved the Brownies when we were in Volos, as I said\nbefore, but as soon as Metaxess, who was a dictator, Fascist, decided that the Girl Scout\nmovement, and the Boy Scout movement had to cease and all children should joined Apon,\nwhich was the youth organization. But Jews were not included, so I could not participate. So I\nalways felt so hurt, because of that. And after the -- after the liberation, and when things started\nfalling into place slowly, my goal was to become a Girl Scout. I was dying to. We didn\u2019t know\nany troops, any Girl Scout troops, how do you go about it. But I made sure I found out where the\nheadquarters were, and I wrote a letter to the region officers there, a wonderful woman, by the\nname of Mrs. Sareefee, and I told her that I was a Brownie when I was little, and now I\u2019m out of\nhiding, and I want to become a Girl Scout. And she wrote back and -- a very warm letter that I\nread, and read, and knew by heart, because that was the letter I had under my pillow. Every night\nI read it. And she told me that troop number 21 is not far from where I live, and my mother could\nget me there, and they used to meet on Saturdays again. And sure enough my mother took me,\nand she met the leaders, wonderful women. And it was from then on I was -- my life was nothing\nbut the Girl Scouts. It was the most wonderful experience for me to be with this group.",
        "A: Well, it addressed my strengths, it also addressed my need to -- to be included, to be with\nchildren, to be with other people, to be doing interesting things. To be going on outings, like\nexcursions, to do service work. And I was very, very welcome. To this day, I go to Greece, and I\nsee friends that I made in my Girl Scout years. I meet them there. They write to me. In fact, they\nsend me a yearbook lately. Every February -- 22\u2122 of February, it\u2019s considered the day of\nthinking, they call it Thinking Day. It was the day that the re -- the Baden Powell, and his wife\nOlivia, when they formed Girl Scouts, they would correspond with other people, and they had set\nthis day as the Girl Scout day, thinking of each other. So it somehow kept it, and many of these\nfriends gather in somebody\u2019s house, and they always send me a card, and they sign their name\nthat they remember me. And I think it\u2019s a wonderful feeling, to -- to know that these years were\nso important. I later became a -- a Girl Scout leader. I was pretty good at it. I was leader taking\nGirl Scouts camping in service areas that we called -- Greece had earthquakes, and the senior\nGirl Scouts, above -- above age sic -- 17, I think, or 18, would go and help the village, and the\npeople after the earthquakes, and I was the leader there. So they were wonderful years. I just love\nthem.",

        "A: My sister? She -- yeah, I think she was, but except she -- she had too many interests, so\nsometimes she would be very naughty, as the principal said. You know, she -- she likes boys,\nand she liked other things to do. You know. But basically I think she graduated all right.\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Yeah, at times, yeah. But then I left the Hill School, and I went to the American college,\nwhich 1s a high school in Greece. It\u2019s a very good school, extremely good school, and it was -- it\nwas very hard for me, because I entered in the seventh grade. I had to pass exams, and -- to be\nadmitted. And it has been an extremely wonderful experience being in that school. Very strict\nschool. Academically very high standards. That\u2019s where I learned English. I had wonderful\nteachers, that they were not only teachers, but very caring for the children. And I still see them\nwhen I go to Greece. They\u2019re in their 90\u2019s. One of them died last year, and she was 103, and I\nused to go and visit her. And this gives me also a routine of what was I like then, because I left,\nand I came to a country that nobody knew me, other than my husband, who didn\u2019t even know me\nthat well, after a week\u2019s flir -- you know, courtship. So it gives me such a good feeling to be\nrooted again, talking to my teachers, talking to my old friends, the people who knew me. They\nknew who I was, and what I was, and how I was. It\u2019s a very good feeling.",
        "A: 24.",
        "A: I met him.",
        "A: No, what I did, I finished high school, and then I went to a school of social work in -- which\nwas part of the American college, it\u2019s called Pierce College. And it was what they used to call\napple division. So there were three schools, school -- school of commerce, social work, and\nliterature, so -- so I chose the school of social work. Before that I had become a volunteer Red\nCross nurse, and I used to -- I mean, I had six months training, and then I had to be at the\nhospital for two months every year, taking different shifts, and I enjoyed being a nurse, volunteer\nnurse, but it was great. So -- I keep on jumping -- so after I became a social worker, I worked --\nat the time I was doing academic work, I also had field placements in different places. One was\nin a community place with refugees, the other was in a -- in an adoption center. It was a place\ncalled Mittera, and there were primarily children from unwed mothers, and many of their\nchildren were being adopted [indecipherable] with American families, or other families. So I was\nthe social worker trainee. And that -- that was a great place, I liked that place a lot. I tried to\nconvince my parents to adopt a baby from there, but it didn\u2019t work. And after that, you had to\npass exams again, because all social workers were employed basically by the ministry of social\nwelfare. So there were a lot of people who were welfare workers, and were going to villages,\ndistributing welfare checks, and taking care of these type of things. There were social workers\nwho were working in a hospital, sort -- other kind of agencies, there were no private agencies\nthat would hire social workers. So I worked in a -- in a hospital at the beginning at the children\u2019s\nhospital, and later in a public hospital as a discharge social worker, discharging people, and\nmaking arrangements for them. And then I met Isaac. Oh, before I met Isaac I also belonged to a\nlittle Jewish club. It was a Jewish youth club where I met Sam. Sam is Isaac\u2019s brother. And we\nbecame very good friends, both with Sam and his then fianc\u00e9e, Evelyn. And we were a group of\nabout, you know, we were groups, several groups. We used to go on excursions, or places,\ndifferent -- to the movies together, but we moved in the group. So I was dating at the time a\nyoung man, who was part of that Jewish club, and this was a nice time. I think the adults were\nvery pleased that we had this club, and I think partially they financed it, because they wanted all\nthe young people to meet other Jewish people. And in some cases it worked very well, because\nquite a few of these people married, you know, other women, men, that belonged to this club,\nand that\u2019s how they met.",
        "A: Sam married Evelyn Maraka.",
        "A: Yeah. Actually, I knew Evelyn from my school. She went to the same school I did, to\nAmerican college, but she was in one or two classes younger than I was. So I knew who she was,\nyeah.",
        "A: Right. Isaac -- Isaac had come to -- from the united -- he lived in the United States, and he\nhad come to Greece for Sam\u2019s wedding. And that\u2019s where I met him, the first time actually I lay\neyes -- eyes on him, it was at the wedding, and I didn\u2019t particularly think he was attractive, or -- I\ndidn\u2019t particularly was impressed with him, just by looking at him. But then I think a couple of\ndays later, my sister had some friends over, and this friend of hers said, \u201cWe cannot come,\nbecause we have a guest, my cousin from the United States is here, so I cannot come to dinner.\u201d\nAnd Yola said, \u201cBring him over,\u201d you know, \u201cit will be fine.\u201d So I was invited, and my parents\nwere invited also, to Yola\u2019s, but my parents were not feeling well, so they didn\u2019t go, so I went.\nAnd that\u2019s where I met him, and I said, \u201cWell, he is kind of interesting guy.\u201d\u201d You know. And\nthings moved very fast from there.",
        "A: Ah, okay.",
        "A: Uh-huh. Ill be interested in hearing his version. Well, I had broken up with my boyfriend like\na week before. And I had bought two tickets for Isaac Stern, there was a recital in Athens. And I\nwas still kind of lamenting the fact that I would have to either sell the ticket or go by myself. So\nafter I met Isaac at my sister\u2019s house, and we talked about all sorts of things, and he was telling\nme about his interest in music, I thought about asking him to come, but girls didn\u2019t ask boys out\nthose days. And I wasn\u2019t sure whether I should do it or not. Anyway, I thought about it, I went to\nwork in the hospital, and I thought about it, and thought about it, and I said, \u201cWell, what\ndifference does it make?\u201d I want him to come. So I called him, and I said, \u201cListen, I have an\nextra ticket for Isaac Stern, are you interested?\u201d And he said, \u201cI -- am I interested. I would love\nto go.\u201d So that\u2019s how it happened, I met him, and we went to the theater, we listened to Isaac\nStern. During intermission Isaac tells me that he knows Isaac Stern from his college years, where\nhe was directing the concerts at the University of Illinois, and he would like to go and talk to\nhim. So he left me there, and he went backstage. And of course, when he came back, I asked him\nif he remembered him. Yes, he remembered him, I think. Anyway, we went out after the concert,\nwe had coffee, we had ice cream, whatever. And then the next day, either he called me, or I\ncalled him, and I think it was very shortly after, I think I saw him for the whole week. He said to\nme, \u201cDo you know, in English, when somebody says I want to talk to you, do you know what it\nmeans?\u201d And I said, \u201cYeah, it means that somebody wants to talk to you.\u201d Well, he said -- so he\nwas trying to explain to me what it meant, but all of a sudden he says, \u201cI would like to ask you to\nmarry me.\u201d And I was ah, what? You know, I just couldn\u2019t believe it. But he -- he asked me, and\nI said, \u201cYes, yes, I will.\u201d Right away. I didn\u2019t even think about it. I was very attracted to him,\nand I thought he was extremely bright, he was very knowledgeable. He had a great knowledge of\nmusic, which impressed me very much. He was very handsome, and he was an interesting guy.",
        "A: Yes, kind of. And I -- I remember [indecipherable] a teacher that I met in the street, and she\nsaid, \u201cHow are you, what are you doing?\u201d I said, \u201cI just got engaged.\u201d She says, \u201cReally? Tell\nme about it. How long did you know the man?\u201d I said, \u201cA week.\u201d And she looked at me and said,\n\u201cYou, Paulette, this conservative person, got engaged in a week? That can be possible?\u201d It was.\nBut somehow I knew that this was the guy. But I think in retrospect, you know, if any of my\ndaughters would come and tell me they know somebody for a week, and they want to marry this\nperson and go to Australia, let\u2019s say, or someplace far away, I would think they would have to\nhave their heads examined.",
        "A: I mean, it -- 1t didn\u2019t fit my pattern, I would always think things through. I was -- in a sense\nmy teacher was right, I was conservative. I was never -- it wasn\u2019t I wasn\u2019t spontaneous, I was\nspontaneous, but I wasn\u2019t -- I wouldn\u2019t do things at the spur of the moment. And this one was\nvery incongruous with -- with my way of doing things.",
        "A: Yeah, I think I knew. I think I knew.",
        "A: Yeah, I trust my feelings. I think I -- I have a good sense of what I need, and what my feelings\nare, and I think I have intuition, in a way, or maybe a feeling of what\u2019s right for me, and what\u2019s\nnot right for me. Not always, but most of the times.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t answer that, because I n -- first I said yes, then I heard about all the war\nstories. Although I did know some from Sam, his brother, and -- but I don\u2019t know if this was a\ndetermining factor or not at the time, because I didn\u2019t think it through. So I can\u2019t tell. But also\nthe fact that he was Sam\u2019s brother kind of gave me a feeling that, well, you know, I make this\ndecision -- this decision, but he can\u2019t be that bad, I mean, I know his brother. And maybe my\nparents felt that way, too, because they knew Sam. Sam worked with my father at the Jewish\nCentral Committee. And he had high respect for Sam, and Sam for my father. So, I mean, he\nprobably thought, who is this guy who is gonna take my daughter to America, you know, to the\nUnited States? But I think there was some kind of a feeling that he is a solid guy, and I think that\nhelped.",
        "A: When we got engaged, Sam and Evelyn were on their honeymoon, so they didn\u2019t know about\nit until they came back. They had just been married. And they were thrilled. They were very\nhappy, very happy.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yes. I think they were -- they were happy. And you know, after talking to him, my mother\nfound him very charming. My father found him extremely knowledgeable. It was the time of the\nSputnik, and my father was so interested about that Sputnik, but knew nothing about what was\ngoing on. And, I mean, the fact that somebody could explain it to him in such wonderful ways,\nwas very impressive. So I think he was very taken with that.",
        "A: Okay. A-Also let me tell you that since we got engaged, I would receive huge bouquets of\nflower every single day, to the point that we had no place to put them, because you know -- and\nthere was always a note from Isaac, you know, with every delivery of flowers. And that was very\nnice. So to get back to your question, when did we make plans. I think it was understood that I\nwould come to United States. At that time, I was applying for a scholarship to come to the\nUnited States to study. And I had applied to Barnard College, and I forget what else. But I had a\ncouple of colleges. And Isaac told me that if I come as a student, I cannot stay in the United\nStates. So we went to the American consulate to get some advice, and they told us that indeed, I\ncould not -- I could get the scholarship, but I -- even -- I couldn\u2019t get married in the United States\nand remain in the United States. The Greek visa was oversubscribed. So I think 1t was something\nlike 10 years of waiting, or something like that, which didn\u2019t thrill me. And one of the\nsuggestions was that maybe I can go to Canada, and get married in Canada, and then for Isaac to\napply for me to come from Canada to the United States as a spouse. Because Canada had no --\nno quota. So we thought about it, and thought about it, a-and we thought it might be a good idea.\nMy -- there was a family that we knew who had gone to Montreal. This was my brother-in-law\u2019s\n-- Yola\u2019s husband\u2019s cousin. And they had moved from Athens to Montreal like maybe two years\nbefore that. So Freddie, my brother-in-law, wrote to them and told them the situation, and asked\nthem if I could stay with them while all the paperwork was being done. And they said they\nwould be very glad to have me there. So that\u2019s what happened. A friend my sister\u2019s, who was\nworking for HIAS, the Hebrew Immigration Society, said to me, \u201cYou know we are going to\nspeed things up for you. Why don\u2019t you get your police report, your health records, and\neverything else you need, and we\u2019|l send them to the consulate in Montreal. So after you marry,\nthe -- all your -- all that your husband has to do,\u201d-- [indecipherable], \u201call that your husband has\nto do is to -- to apply for you to come to United States, and this will save you a lot of paperwork\nover there.\u201d I said fine. So I did all this preliminary work, and Linda sent everything to Montreal.\nSo I left in April of \u201958 for Montreal. It was -- didn\u2019t hit me until I was on the plane, and I said to\nmyself, where am I going, all by myself, to somebody I don\u2019t really know. I just wanted the\nplane to come back. But the plane kept going. And eventually I re -- I reached Montreal, my\nfriends were there to greet me at the airport. And this was a family that they had two children, a\nsix year old, and a baby. And I shared a room with the six year old, and also the mother -- his\nmother lived with them, in a small apartment in Montreal. So Isaac came I think the next\nweekend, or two weekends later to see me.",
        "A: Oh, it was -- let\u2019s see, we got engaged in September 57 --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: Yeah, so we went to the airport to pick him up, the family and I. And I couldn\u2019t wait in the\nwaiting room, I was so anxious to see the -- see him. So I went outside, you know. Apparently\nwhen the plane landed, you had to walk outside into the -- into the terminal. So I see him\ncoming, and I was freezing there, it was so windy, and so cold, but I was waiting there to see\nhim. And he was wonderful. It was really wonderful.",
        "A: Yes, yes, it was -- it was nice.",
        "A: Yes. Isaac was married before, for a short period of time. And we had to -- to go to Toronto\nfor him to sign some papers for the final decree, which we did. And I think shortly after that he\ndis -- his divorce papers came through. And we went again to Toronto, and we got married by a\nJustice of Peace. I was all dressed up, not in a wedding gown, but in a very fancy, elegant dress\nthat\u2019s -- my parents made me at a very great attag -- couturier, as we used to call it, in Athens.\nAnd the question was, do I wear a hat, or do I not wear a hat. And Isaac said, \u201cIf you wear a hat,\nI\u2019m not going to marry you.\u201d So he doesn\u2019t like hats, or he didn\u2019t like me wearing a hat. So I\nthought well, okay. So we were just the two of us, there was nobody, and you had to have\nwitnesses for the wedding. So we -- they told us that we can go out 1n the waiting room and ask\ntwo people to come inside and become our witnesses, or go to Eton, we -- which the department\nstore across the street, and [indecipherable] everybody will come, you\u2019re two young people in\nlove, you know, people love stories like this. Anyway, at the waiting room there was another\ncouple. It was an older couple -- I mean, older, I would think probably in their 50\u2019s. And they\nwere going to get married also. So we made an agreement, we would sign -- we would be\nwitnesses at their wedding, and they would be the witnesses in our wedding. And that\u2019s what\nhappened. I had to repeat in English, and my English wasn\u2019t that good at the time, you know,\nthat\u2019s -- I do marry him, and take care of him, for better or worse. And that was it. At the time --\nthe more I think about that now, the more I think how I missed my family not being there, and\nnot having anybody. And many times I go to weddings, and I cry my heart out. And I wanted my\ndaughters to have nice weddings, with lots of people, and friends, and family. Because I feel that\nI just -- was a big loss for me not to have anybody. But on the other hand, at the time, I -- all I\nwanted was to get married to Isaac. And to me, that was because there were a few obstacles, as I\nsaid, to -- to bypass the immigration laws, to -- to come -- I mean to -- for him to get the divorce\npapers, and all this kind of stuff. So these were like little setbacks that kept me wondering would\nI ever be able to marry this man. And that\u2019s all I wanted at the time, but there was some feeling\nof not having the people that mattered most in something so important in my life.",
        "A: Well, okay -- well, so we got married, then we went to Niagara Falls, this was our\nhoneymoon. And -- okay, so we went for our honeymoon to Niagara Falls, we stayed about a\nweek, and then Isaac returned to the United States, and I returned to Montreal. I wasn\u2019t happy at\nall. The family I lived with, as I told you, had two children, so in order for me to be busy and\nthink less of Isaac, Sonia gave me full care of the baby. He was about six or seven months old,\nlittle Eddie. So she would say to me, \u201cYou need to practice, you take care of him.\u201d And I would\nsay, \u201cWell, P\u2019ve never take care of a baby, what do I do?\u201d She said, \u201cYou\u2019ll find out. Just don\u2019t\nlet him fall.\u201d And I was taking care of him completely. I would take him for walks, I would take\nhim out. We\u2019d play together. It was wonderful to -- to have a little baby there. Anyway,\nmeantime -- it takes a long time -- Isaac applied for me to come to the United States as a spouse.\nAnd at some point he said to me, \u201cYou know, you have to go to the consulate and tell them that -\n- find out why is it taking so long.\u201d Well, it was taking longer than we thought, and eventually I\nwent to the HIAS office, to the Hebrew Immigration Society, and saw a social worker there, who\ngot interested in the whole thing, and she made several attempts to find out what was going on,\nand I think eventually what happened is Isaac had applied for me to come to the United States by\nthe name of Nehama, as his spouse. The papers that were sent from Greece, by HIAS were under\nthe name Moudzoukos. So the two things were never put together, Moudzoukos and Nehama\nwere two different persons for them. So they never figured it out. It was only after desperation\nthat Isaac went to his congressman in New Jersey where he lived, and talked to him, and the next\nday I get a phone call from this social worker, and she said, \u201cGuess what? You\u2019re going\ntomorrow. We have everything ready for you, the visa is ready, come to the office.\u201d And of\ncourse, it was wonderful, because it had become to be a big, big problem, you know, six months\n-- it was six months it took for me being by myself there -- I mean, it wasn\u2019t by myself, but still,\nI was very anxious to start my life, and for Isaac to be in the United States. So, in November,\nfirst day 1t snowed in Canada when I was there, I said good-bye to my friends, and boarded a\nplane, and came here, in New York, and of course, Isaac was a -- waiting, and he already had\nrented a house in Lake Hiawatha, which at this time I couldn\u2019t even say the word Hiawatha. And\nI would think, my God, if I get lost, how am I gonna say where I live? I mean, this is not the\nplace to take me. You should take me someplace where I can pronounce, or I can even say it. So\nit was -- the house was all taken care of. I mean, he had arranged it, and fixed it, and he had a lot\nof his furniture there, but decorated very nicely, painted it, just took good care of things. And\nthen it was, how do I live here, and what do I do, and it was a bit hard. It was lonely, because I\ndidn\u2019t know anybody, although I met two good friends of his, and their wives were marvelous.\nThey would come and pick me up and take me to lunch, or take me places, and they tried very\nhard to -- to make me feel comfortable. But a couple of months later, I -- oh no, I started going to\nNew York, I would take the bus from New Jersey and go to New York in the day time, and\nstarted going to the museums, and just getting a feel of the city, and I loved it. And one day, I\nthink Isaac had gone to San Francisco on business, I was looking in the newspaper, and I saw\nthat there was a position open for a social worker that -- to deal with adoptions. So I called, and\nmade an appointment, and took the bus, and went to -- and indeed, it was the International Social\nService in New York, that was looking for a social worker, take care of Greek adoptions. I knew\nall the social workers in the International Social Service in Greece -- I no -- in Athens. I knew\nthem very well. And to me this was like a glove that fitted perfectly well. So I told them I was\ninterested in the job, they said they thought I would be perfect for the job, but they have to\ncommunicate with the people in Athens, and get references from there, and everything else,\nwhich they did, and then they called me, and they said, \u201cMy goodness, I mean we never heard\nanything as good as this. When can you start?\u201d So I got the job, and I had to commute, of course,\nevery day from New Jersey. It would take me like an hour almost, on the bus. And it was very\nexciting, I was very excite -- I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, but it was very exciting. And I\nliked the people work there, very well, very much. Then I got pregnant with Sarah, and\ncommuting wasn\u2019t the best thing for me. I had the threatening miscarriage, and the doctor said to\nme, \u201cWell, all I can tell you is, what you want, the baby or the wor -- the job?\u201d So I decided I\nwanted the baby, and that meant I had to stop working. There was no other way to get to New\nYork early in the morning, so I stopped working. And I was sad about that, because I just felt I\nhad reached the point where now I\u2019m able to -- to live in the United States, to work, to become\npart of it. So it was a bit sad. But of course, having a baby was wonderful.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, I have done my training with Eddie, and I went to his 25\" birthday, in Canada.",
        "A: In the 70\u2019s, I forget. Well, \u00b057 or \u201958 plus -- \u201878 -- about \u201978, I think? Something like that.",
        "A: Yeah. We had gone for a visit to Canada with the childr -- two of the children, Sarah was in\ncollege, and it was Maya and Nicole that came, and Isaac and I, we drove all the way up there, it\nwas his 25\" birthday. It was nice.",
        "A: No, because the most horrible thing happened. I had my camera, and I asked people to take\npictures of us because we were going to send them to Greece, you know, here are the\nnewlyweds. And something happened to the film, and no picture came out. Absolutely no\npicture. It was devastating not only to me, but also to my parents, who were saying, \u201cSend us\nwedding pictures, where are the wedding pictures?\u201d So I don\u2019t have a single photo of that.",
        "A: I have photos of all the kids, yes. Sarah as a baby, I used to send them to my parents. When\nSarah was six months old, I took her to Greece, and that was great. It was -- because I can now\nunderstand how my parents felt, of me being so far away, and not being able to see me, help me.\nHere I go through pregnancy, a baby -- a brand new baby. If you were -- if I were to live in\nGreece, you know, they would be with me, or helping me in every step. And here I was totally,\ntotally, totally alone. And it must have been extremely difficult for my mother, especially. My\nfather too, I\u2019m sure. You know, the United States wasn\u2019t just available that much those days,\ntickets were extremely expensive, telephone calls were extremely expensive. So this is not like\nthe kind of thing you do now, like I call my sister every week. But st -- you know, he -- it\u2019s not a\nmajor expense, but those days it was.",
        "A: Well, my sister was married and had a son, he was -- Maurice was about 10 at the time. Then\nin \u201973, her husband died. And she hasn\u2019t remarried since.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, they saw a lot of my sister. And they lived nearby -- near each other, so you\nknow, they would see each other, yes. Then there were financial difficulties, the factory wasn\u2019t\ngoing well. My father started another factory in Athens, which was in -- in yarn. Factory\nproduced yarn, not material -- not cashmere any more, in order to supply Volos, the Volos\nfactory. But that didn\u2019t go very well, and there were really financial problems, and constant\nproblems with the bank, and the creditors, and this and that. So eventually -- his health was bad,\nhe was diabetic. His health became bad, and financial conditions had changed, and so he lost the\nfactory again. So that was very hard for them.",
        "A: Right. And I think the fact that, you know, we had to leave again -- we stayed a couple of\nmonths in Athens with Sarah -- was probably harder for them, because now they had experienced\ntheir grandchild, and was taken away from them again, you know.",
        "A: Sarah. I used to say Sarah, and when Sarah went to the fir -- to first grade, she came home and\nshe -- I -- I said to her, \u201cSarah, wash your hands, we\u2019re going to have lunch.\u201d And she said, \u201cMy\nname is not Sarah, it\u2019s Sarah.\u201d So she had become Americanized. And -- so Sarah is named after\nIsaac\u2019s mother, who perished in Auschwitz. Maya, her second name is Thalia, which is my\nmother\u2019s name, who also died, not in the Holocaust. And Nicole middle name is Julie, after\nJulius Hoffman, Dr. Julius Hoffman, who is the psychiatrist who delivered her at home, in my\nhome, because she came too fast. So everybody has meaningful name.",
        "A: Sure. Sarah was born in New Jersey, on January 28\", 1960. When she was almost a year old,\nwe moved to California, to Santa Monica. And then in \u201962, the end of \u201962, we moved back to\nWashington. Actually, we moved to Washington, and remained in Washington since then. Maya\nwas born in Washington in -- on September 17\", 1963. And Nicole was born on May 14\", 1966,\nat home, before I had time to go to the hospital. And that was a big commotion.",
        "A: Tell the story. Well, it was a Saturday, thank God, so Isaac was home. Now, my neighbors\nhad told me that if I go to labor, I would call them, and they would take care of the older girls. So\nwhen I woke up in the morning, the water broke, and I found out I -- I had contractions, so I-I\ntimed them, and they were about 10 minutes apart. So I woke Isaac up, and said to him, you\nknow, \u201cTake care of the kids. Just give them breakfast or whatever, and I\u2019ll go take a shower.\u201d\nActually, I did call my doctor, and told him that I was in labor. And he said, \u201cOh, 10 minutes,\nokay. When the contractions are,\u201d -- this was like early in the morning, like eight o\u2019clock, or\nmaybe earlier. \u201cWhen the contractions are about five minutes apart, come to the hospital.\u201d And I\nthought, five minutes apart, that\u2019s a little too -- too close, but I didn\u2019t say anything, he was the\ndoctor. So I went to the bathroom to take a shower, and I had some very strong contractions, so I\nsaid, I better lie down. I don\u2019t think I should take a shower. So I lay down, and then things\nstarted happening very, very fast. I mean, there were no five minute contractions between the 10\nminutes. And I\u2019m feeling the baby is coming, and you know, what can I do? I can\u2019t make it to\nthe bathroom, I can\u2019t -- so I called Isaac, and I said to him, \u201cThrow me a towel, I\u2019m having a\nbaby.\u201d So Isaac took the towel -- I had taken a shower at ni -- the night before, and threw me the\ntowel -- gave me the towel, and he was in a total panic. So he looks out of the window, and he\nsees my neighbor and good friend, and psychiatrist, Dr. Julius Hoffman walking his dog, and\nreading his paper. So he opens the door, and he calls Dr. Hoffman, and he said, \u201cJules, Jules,\nPaulette is having a baby, what do I do?\u201d So he run to his house, which was next door, left the\ndog, came in -- I don\u2019t know if he washed his hands, but came in and the moment he came in, the\nbaby was halfway out. So he delivered the baby, and he told me it was a girl. I heard her cry\nonce. And Isaac called an ambulance -- oh no, he called the doctor, the doctor said, \u201cMy\ngoodness,\u201d you know, \u201cwhen did that happen? Bring her to the hospital. Call an -- an ambulance\nand bring to the hospital immediately, I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d So meantime, when Dr. Hoffman\ntook his dog back, he told his wife, \u201cPaulette is having a baby.\u201d So she was alerted, and she\ncame. And I had called another neighbor, who had told me she would take care of the girls, and\nwhen I said to her, you know, \u201cI-I\u2019m in labor, and I\u2019Il go to the hospital, do you think you can\ntake care of Sarah and Maya?\u201d She said, \u201cSure, but how close are you, because I can hear you\nbreathing very hard.\u201d I said, \u201cOh, I -- you have plenty of time.\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019m giving my\nchildren breakfast, do I have time?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, you do, come afterwards.\u201d Well, she was here\nvery fast, because she said she had a feeling she couldn\u2019t wait for the children to have breakfast.\nSo the two women are here, and Dr. Hoffman, and the ambulance came. The -- of course, you\nknow, they check the baby, and me. They put me on the ambulance. And as we are going out the\ndoor, all of a sudden I said, \u201cWhat happened to Sarah and Maya? Tell them to come here and see\ntheir new sister.\u201d Isaac had forgotten about them. He shoved them in her room, and she -- he said\nto him, \u201cStay there, and don\u2019t move.\u201d So when he opened the door to see the two, to tell them to\ncome out, both of them were huddled one next to the other, sucking their thumbs, poor things. I\nmean, they were -- so m -- I asked to see them, so they came as I was going out the door on the\nstretcher. I told them I was fine, and they looked at the baby. And I told them that my neighbors,\nMrs. Hoffman, and Mrs. Grossman\u2019s going to take care of them. Daddy would be back, I\u2019d be\nback in a couple of days, and I'll talk to them on the phone. So off we go, an -- in the ambulance,\nand I don\u2019t hear the baby crying, so I think she\u2019s dead. I was very worried. So I kept telling Dr.\nHoffman, \u201cI can\u2019t hear the baby cry.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou want me to pinch her? She will cry.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cNo, don\u2019t do that, but is she alive, or is she not?\u201d \u201cYes, she\u2019s alive, she\u2019s breathing all\nright.\u201d So I go to the hospital, the doctor meets me right there at the entrance, he takes me down\n[indecipherable] emergency room. He checks me out, he says, \u201cMrs. Nehama, you are 1n perfect\nhealth. It\u2019s Mr. Nehama who needs to be hospitalized.\u201d Isaac was in the ambulance with Dr.\nHoffman, and he was holding the baby, wrapped in a yellow sha -- the yellow towel. We have\nthat towel, I gave it to Nicole. But then I couldn\u2019t see the baby, because they put her in isolation,\nin the intensive care, just to check her out. And I thought she was dead. So I keep asking,\n\u201cWhere 1s my baby, where is the baby?\u201d They said, \u201cShe is fine, she is fine.\u201d I said, \u201cI want to\nsee the baby. I want to get up to see the baby.\u201d They wouldn\u2019t let me get up, although I was fine.\nWell, finally in the afternoon they let me get up, and I went by the nursery and there\u2019s a woman\nwho is sitting there -- standing there in front of the big window, and she said to me, \u201cDid you\nhave a baby today?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, how about you?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cI had it at home.\u201d I said, \u201cI\ndid, too. Have you seen your baby?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I think my baby\u2019s over there.\u201d And\nthen I looked, and the nurse brought Nicole, or I pointed, and she brought her, you know, from\nthe window, and somebod -- then in the evening I had her, and she came to the room, they\nbrought her. But it was a little worrisome, not being able to see her. So those days you stayed in\nthe hospital about five days. So everything went well, thank God she was fine. Last day of\ndischarge the doctor got us, all the women, all his patients were about to be discharged, and he\ngives them instructions what to do, and what not to do. So he introduces every single woman\naround this -- around the room, and he said, \u201cAnd this is Mrs. Nehama, who sneezed and had her\nbaby on Saturday.\u201d He used to call me the do-it-yourself girl. He was funny. But then I heard all\nsorts of stories. I was at the grocery store one day, and I wrote a check, and the cashier said to\nme, \u201cThank you, Mrs. Nehama.\u201d And the woman behind me, she said, \u201cAre you Mrs. Nehama?\u201d\u2019\nI looked at her, I didn\u2019t know her. I said yes. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re the woman who scared my\nhusband to death.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know your husband, who is he?\u201d Well, she says, \u201cYou don\u2019t\nknow him, but you scared him to death.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d She said, \u201cDi -- didn\u2019t you\nhave your baby at home?\u201d I said yeah. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen you had the baby, I was seven\nmonths pregnant, and my husband wouldn\u2019t let me get out of the house for two months. He\nwould call me every half hour. He was so scared I would have the baby in the house. You\nchanged my life.\u201d So, there were funny things.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s true, that\u2019s true. I mean, life wasn\u2019t easy. It was lonely, for the most part. It was hard. I\nhad missed my folks, you know, a family, although there was continuous communication, letters,\nand gifts, and all sorts of things sent back and forth. It was still not here, so everything I had to\ndo as a person, and as a wife, and as a mother, I had to figure it out, and do it myself.",
        "A: Loneliness. Just having to do everything by myself. But also, knowing that I could manage it,\nI could struggle, but I could do it, and that\u2019s rewarding to know, that I have succeeded in doing\nthat. I mean, I went to school here, I went -- I got my Master\u2019s degree, I got a job. I got a job in\nNew York, as I was starting in International Social Service, when I was barely here, in the\nUnited States, so I -- you know, nobody shown me what to do, or how to do it, I -- I just had the\nmotivation to -- to do it. I was very lucky, because I think many times things fell on my lap, like\nthis job at the International Social Service, it fitted me like a glove. It was very familiar territory\nfor me, working with adoptive cases from Greece.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: Right. There were many, many challenges. But I wanted to have a full life, and I wanted my\nchildren to have a full life. And I was constantly trying to fi -- find ways to -- to learn. I\u2019m also in\na great profession, that I can go into seminars -- I\u2019m a social worker, I have a Master\u2019s degree,\nand, you know, go into seminars and talking about different issues, it was great -- great for me,\nbecause I could s -- find out, and work on things that were concerning me in many ways. So --",
        "A: That is true. He also traveled a lot during the years he worked for the Apollo project. He was\ntraveling practically three days out of the five. So that was fine, it was a very intense program for\nhim, very exciting problem for him, but there wasn\u2019t -- and there wasn\u2019t that much time available\nfor -- for doing things, although he did try to help. Later on he would drive Nicole to piano\nlessons, or things like that. But I think I was doing most of -- of the work in the house, and the\nresponsibility with children.",
        "A: You never have a clear ideas when you are not a mother. So you go with the flow. I wanted\nmy children to be whole people, not to be one sided, just geniuses, and educated, and scholars,\nbut lacking in human -- human affairs, let\u2019s say, and compassion, and things like that. So I\nwanted them to be capable, responsible for themselves, autonomous. At the time they were\nsupposed to be autonomous. And to have connections, not to be alone, because I was so alone, I\nthink.",
        "A: I was conflicted at the time. You see, when I came out of the Holocaust, I was sort of afraid to\nbe identified as Jewish, and to -- for people to think that I was Jewish, I wasn\u2019t sure how it would\nplay, so out of my own anxiety, I didn\u2019t really pursue for them to go -- for us to be members of a\nsynagogue, or to be identified with Jewish causes at the time. Now I regret that. I hoped -- o-or I\nwished that things were different, and my attitude would have been different. And -- but it\u2019s a\nlittle too late, I mean, for me anyway, to teach them. But certainly they did get some religious\nthings from -- celebrating the holidays here, the high holidays, and things like that. On high\nholidays we would go to the synagogue. But I don\u2019t think 1t was enough, I really don\u2019t. But I had\nareal fear at the time, of being identified a Jew, although I knew it was almost like being a\nkryptal Jew, because I would never deny that I was Jewish, or -- or I was married to a Jew, but\nthere was a lot of anxiety about that, until I finally realized the Nazis are gone, you know, you\nhave nothing to be afraid of at this point.",
        "A: Yeah, my daughter Maya was a swimmer, and she used to belong to the swimming team --\nswim team of the Jewish social -- I\u2019m sorry, Jewish Community Center in Rockville, in\nMaryland. So she used to practice on a regular basis, and also they had races, like they had\nevents, they would go to other Jewish centers for -- to compete. So every time there was a race,\nthe -- they would get a badge, and it was be sewn in the back of their jacket, or their sleeves, or t\n-- Maya had quite a few things on her jacket, and she was very proud of it, and I was very proud\nof her, because she was a good swimmer. And I remember once, after I had sewn a badge on her\n-- most of these badges would say Jewish Federation, or Jewish this, or Jewish that. They had the\nStar of David. So they were definitely very Jewish badges. She was going to go out with a friend\nto the mall to buy a present for another friend who had a birthday. So the mother of the other\nfriend was going to drive them there, and pick them up. And it was a cool day, and Maya is\nready to go, the car is waiting in my driveway, and she\u2019s wearing this jacket. And I said to her,\n\u201cMaya, you cannot wear this jacket.\u201d It was full of badges. And she said, \u201cWhy? It\u2019s cold out.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cNo, Maya, you have to put a different jacket.\u201d And I literally sta -- stood in front of the\ndoor, because I wanted her to go change her jacket. My feeling was that how can she go to a\npublic place, and be seen as being a Jew? I had this feeling that she would be lynched, that\npeople will say horrible things, that people will do harm to her. And that was unbearable to me,\nthat my child will be hurt because she was Jewish. But basically, what that was saying 1s, I was\nJewish, and I was hurt because of that, when I was a kid. So that was very difficult. Of course,\nonce I realized what I was doing, I let her go. But she could not understand it at the time. I\nexplained to her later, when she came back. But I remember s -- having this fear. I actually saw\nher being hurt. And that was unbearable.",
        "A: In the United States, no. I have not. In Greece, when I was in school, sometimes kids would\ntell me I crucified Christ, and I didn\u2019t have a recollection of doing that. So, I -- I would tell my\nmother that that\u2019s what they told me, and she -- she would say, \u201cWell, don\u2019t listen to people like\nthat,\u201d you know, \u201cpeople will say bad things about Jewish people, but it\u2019s not true.\u201d No,\nbasically I didn\u2019t, but it was primarily of what I\u2019ve heard, what I\u2019ve read, that had caused me to -\n- to think in those terms.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t talk much about it. I -- it was hard for me. It was much, much later that became\ncomfortable talking about it. It was something I -- I knew had to happen, but I had to move on.\nAnd there were so many painful situations that I didn\u2019t think I wanted to tell my children when\nthey were young. Course, now they are older, so it\u2019s a different story. But when I think about my\ngrandchildren, I think, you know, how at the age of six or seven or eight, they can hear these\nstories. Of course, you have to modify -- fy them a little bit. I was talking with my grandson\nMax, who 1s six, and he was coming here because Isaac was being honored by the Holocaust\nMuseum to light a candle. One of the six candles for Day of Remembrance at the rotunda at the\nU.S. capital, on je -- what was it? April 30\", 2003. So Max and his mother came. The others\nwere too young, the other little boys. And Ian and Maya came. And I was asking Max why is he\nhere, what -- what he\u2019s going to see or hear, or why did he come. And he said to me, \u201cWell,\nbecause I know that Grandpa was with the partisans, and he had a gun, and he fought the Nazis,\nand I know that you were hiding in an attic.\u201d Now how did he get the attic I\u2019m not sure, but --\nbecause I was never in an attic. I was in small rooms, but not in an attic. \u201cAnd -- and some\npeople really hid you, and you couldn\u2019t go out, you couldn\u2019t go to school, and that must have\nbeen real nice.\u201d He really liked the fact I didn\u2019t go to school. So, I mean he 1s six, so -- I mean,\nhe could absorb some of it.",
        "A: Yeah.",

One of the poems was, but I am black, but oh my heart 1s white.\nAnd a -- I was always fascinated by -- by that, how people put such values on people they don\u2019t\nknow, or put such -- they\u2019re so prejudiced about things they don\u2019t know. And people are people,\nyou know. They\u2019re just good people, and bad people, and not so good people.

        "A: I had mixed feelings, I must say, because part of the oath is that it tells you you have to\nabandon your country, and I still felt very Greek. So I wasn\u2019t quite ready to abandon my country,\nbut I did not -- I did want to become an American. So, for awhile I struggled with that, and s --\nonce, Isaac -- somebody -- we were at the gathering, and somebody said to me, \u201cPaulette, where\nis home?\u201d And I said -- without even thinking, I said Greece. And Isaac looked at me, and he\nsaid, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you. Greece is home? You live here. You\u2019ve been living here for 20 odd\nyears.\u201d And it was -- it was strange for me that he would get angry with me for feeling that way.\nBut I think it was the fact that, you know, I had lived there, I had made connections there. I spent\nmy childhood there. Now that I have grandchildren however, and I have roots here, I feel\ndifferently. I feel now I belong here. And it\u2019s strange, but I still love Greece.",

        "A: Oh, I think it\u2019s wonderful. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s a wonderful country. I think the freedoms you find in\nthis country, you don\u2019t find them anywhere in the world. The fact that the place is so diverse also\nis -- to me, it\u2019s very interesting, and very nice. But it\u2019s mostly the personal freedom, of being\nable to say you\u2019re Jewish for instance, you know, which sometimes I couldn\u2019t say it in Greece,\nalthough there were no people to hurt me, you know, this kind of thing. Or to do things.\nSometimes we take this freedom a little too far, I think, but there\u2019s no other country, I think,\nthat\u2019s -- freedom is the most wonderful thing to have, and you can find it here. Also there\u2019s\nanother thing. You have opportunities in this country, and if you are willing to work hard, you\ncan do things. Like for instance, I went to get my Master\u2019s degree when I was 49 years old. And\nI remember discussing this with a friend, and I said, \u201cWell, you know, I have grown-up children,\nthey\u2019Il be going to college pretty soon. I\u2019m 49. I don\u2019t know if I can manage to -- to go get a\nMaster\u2019s degree, and he said -- she said to me, \u201cPaulette, if you want to get a Master\u2019s degree, go\nget a Master\u2019s degree. You\u2019re going to be 49 whether you get it or not.\u201d And I never forgot that.\nAnd I thought, if I lived in Greece, and I was 49, there wouldn\u2019t have been a place for me to go\nand get a degree, even if I wanted to. Even when I was talking to my friends in Greece, and I\nwould tell them I\u2019m going to college to get a Master\u2019s degree, they would think I was sort of\nwell, maybe she\u2019s a little cuckoo at this late age, you know. And to me this was wonderful.",
        "A: I went to Catholic University in Washington.",
        "A: Yeah, I\u2019m sure that that was important in their lives, you know. Actually, Maya and I\ngraduated the same year. It was funny to have graduations within a couple of weeks apart. You\nknow, I\u2019m going to school, my mother is -- is studying for exams, I can\u2019t talk to you now. Yeah,\nI think it was a role model, but I think they were -- they would have gone to school anyway,\nbecause they were motivated, all of them, and they wanted to go to college, and have a career. So\nI don\u2019t think it was the only model they had.",
        "A: Yes. I was affected by the feminist movement, but this is a traditional household, so a lot of\nthe things that were going on were not totally, totally accepted. I wanted my daughters to be\nwomen who could decide for themselves, who would have a voice, whether it was in a job, in a\nmarriage, or in wherever. I wanted them to be treated equally with men, not to be discriminated\nupon. I wanted more for them than I wanted for me from the women\u2019s movement. And I think\nthey are pretty much with it.",
        "A: I know Nicole thinks so, and probably the others do too. There were times that this was\ndifficult for them, because I remember when there were occasions that -- for instance, holidays\nwere difficult in this family, because holidays is something that you have everybody around, and\nnot everybody was around. So it was always a feeling of loss, not necessarily, you know, a\njoyous holiday. Things are mixed bags, often. So I remember once, one of my daughters said,\nbecause I was trying to explain that, you know, both Isaac and I had difficult life, and she said,\n\u201cOh Mom, I\u2019m so tired of -- of that. Let\u2019s have the holiday and enjoy it,\u201d or whatever, you know,\nlike okay, you had it, but why about us? So I think she was -- I -- I forget which daughter it was,\nbut I think, you know, to a certain degree they tolerated the difficulties, because they were part of\nthe [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t know that they\u2019re -- I think Nicole is more closer to that than the\nothers. Sarah is too. Well yeah, I think she is.

        "A: Well, I think she stayed in this house longer, probably. She is married to a Jewish person. She\nhas children, and -- boys, and she wants them to be Bar Mitzvahed, and for them to know about\nour lives, a lot. And maybe the fact that she went to a Jewish camp, day camp, may have had\nsomething to do. So, who knows?",
        "A: Ocean.",
        "A: Yes. Mostly family members. But you see, in the past, when there was a holiday, all the\nfamily members will gather around, s-some relatives would come. So it was a Bible kind of\nthing. This time, I mean, you go through the motions sometimes, but you feel the lack of these\npeople. And Passover is a difficult time. Isaac often reads the Haggadah from his father\u2019s\nHaggadah, which is in Ladeeno. Has both Hebrew, Ladeeno, and Greek. So he reads passages\nthat he remembers his father read on Passover. And every time he reads them, you know, I get a\nchill in my back. It just -- just, you know, brings tears to my eyes. And I remember my father\nreading -- not Ladeeno, but you know, presiding over the Seder, and I know the last time I saw\nhim it was Passover, because he was sick, and I had gone to Greece, I had taken Nicole with me,\nwho was about three. Sh -- he had not seen her -- grandchild. So I took her with me. And he was\nquite sick, but he sat at the Seder. And I knew it was the last time I would see him. He died\nshortly after. He died in October of 1970. And -- but his [indecipherable] he -- he was dress up,\nhe put his clean, nice, press shirt. You know, he was very presentable.

        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That is true. I mean, for a long time, I did not consider myself a survivor. I consider myself\nthat I lived through the war. And the Holocaust, and the hiding was part of the war. I remember I\nattended a workshop once in one of the conferences. It was the American [indecipherable]\nPsychiatric Association to which I belonged. And there was something on -- about survivors of\nthe Holocaust, and I attended that, and the first thing I said is, can we make a distinction, who is\na survivor? Because they were talking -- I mean, it was very blurred to me, who 1s a survivor,\nand who is not? So they said everybody who survived both the camps, and the war, and the\nhidden children, everybody was -- they lumped them all together. And to that day, I never\nthought I was a survivor.",
        "A: Yes Ido. Yes, I do.",
        "A: Well, you see, the word survivor implies to a certain degree that you were a victim. And I\ndon\u2019t like to feel victimized, but I was victimized, and so was my family, and Isaac\u2019s family, and\na lot of other people. So it\u2019s not an approp -- an inappropriate word to use. But I don\u2019t like the\nlabel of being victimized, because that kind of sets you in a mold, and in a pattern, that\nsometimes you can\u2019t come out of it, and I don\u2019t want that to happen. In other words, I survived, I\nmade it, I\u2019m healthy, both physically and mentally. And here I am. Ill be 70 years old in\nSeptember. It\u2019s not a small achievement, I think.",

That\u2019s -- we -\n- the world belongs to everybody, and people are responsible for the world, and I think that we\nhave a responsibility to -- to speak out, and not to let things happen, and to do our part. I don\u2019t\nknow, maybe that\u2019s a little -- but I do feel that, you know, I mean I want my friends to know that\nmy life was different from theirs in many ways, and I think the ones who do know, respect it\nvery much.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B\nincident with -- with the jacket, but I wondered if you were more fearful in -- in other ways, and\nin general?",
        "A: I probably was, and I was aware of it. So I tried not to inflict this on my daughters, because I\ndidn\u2019t want them to become fearful people. And -- but I did have a lot of anxiety about it, their\nsafety, a lot of it. I just wanted to make sure that they were just okay. Well, more than okay,\nactually. So, I remember Maya had got a new job, a summer job in one of the ice cream stores. I\nthink it was called Swensen. It was in Bethesda, an ice cream parlor, so she was a waitress there.\nAnd she would come -- I mean, the -- the job -- the store closed at 12, they had to clean up, and I\nguess she would come home one or 1:30. And I remember saying that I didn\u2019t feel this was time\nfor a young girl, driving by herself. And Isaac, who is very reasonable at times, tries to put\nreason to everything, tried to convince me that, you know, it didn\u2019t make any difference whether\nshe came home at 12 or at 10, or at nine, because, he said, \u201cShe\u2019s going to be in the car. What\ndifference does it make what time she comes home?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, what if she has a flat\ntire? Where is she gonna find help at 12 o\u2019clock at night? You don\u2019t know what can happen.\u201d\nBut he said, \u201cThat can happen at nine o\u2019clock as well.\u201d You know, this kind of thing.",

        "A: Well, for awhile after the war, we saw them periodically, like a couple of times a year, maybe\nmore. Then we saw them less often, I think, because they moved. And then I came to the United\nStates, so I had no idea where they were, and there was no other contact. But I did find out\nthrough a friend with whom I was talking about the Holocaust one day when I was first in\nGreece, and I -- I gave her the -- I told her -- she asked me where did I hide, and with whom, so I\ntold her the family was Pavella. And that was about it. Then the next day I get a call from this\nfriend.

We work together.\u201d And she\napparently called her, and ask her if they were hiding a family by the name of Moudzoukos. And\nshe said, \u201cYes, we were hiding them.\u201d And she said, \u201cDo you remember Paulette?\u201d And she said,\n\u201cPaulette, Paulette? No, that was Paulexani.\u201d That was my name, my false name. And anyway,\nshe was very excited that I was in Greece, and wanted to talk to me, and see me. But my friend,\nyou see, didn\u2019t want to disappoint me if this didn\u2019t pan out, if -- you know, it wasn\u2019t the same\nperson. And so the next day I got a call from Many, who was just ecstatic, she was very happy.\nShe wanted to see me, and she wants me to go to the house. Unfortunately she was leaving for --\nshe was going to be out of the country, and by the time she would have returned, I was leaving\nfor the United States. But we kept in touch by corresponding, I sent her pictures. And then the\nnext year I went to Greece, my sister and I went to visit her. We got in touch with them, and we\nvisited them. And then in \u201997, I believe, or \u201998, Many came to the United States. She apparently\nstudied in the United States, and I had no idea she was in this country, she went to Purdue\nUniversity, and I had no idea where she was. And anyway, she was being honored by Purdue, so\nthen she decided to make a tour around the United States, and see some of her friends, and when\nshe found out we lived in Washington, of course I insisted that she comes and stays with us. So\nshe came and stayed for a few days. And it was wonderful. We remembered all the past stories,\nand you know, our parents and everything else.",
        "A: Actually, not too many new stories. What I wanted to know from her is what it was like for\nthem to hide us, and what it meant to them. And that\u2019s what I got mostly. But she was the only\none who knew we were Jewish. The children, the other two, Booly and Dimitris did not, because\nof their age. So she was worried, of course, about you know, when we left in such a hurry. And\nthey were told that we went with some relatives or something, not clear answers, you know. So\nthere were so many questions, because you wouldn\u2019t get straight answers from adults. I think at\nmy age anyway, and the younger a -- the younger children, Booly and -- and Dimitris\u2019s age.\nBecause I think people were afraid that, you know, children go to school, talk -- I mean they\nwent to school, I didn\u2019t. They talk to friends, if a friend repeats something like this to a parent,\nand the parent is suspicious, and then, you know how it goes. I mean, you had to be careful.",
        "A: Yeah, absolutely. Even to this day, when I don\u2019t know something I get very anxious,\nextremely anxious. Knowing is power, you know. So I remember some years ago, I had cancer,\nand when I heard the diagnosis, it was devastating. And then when I pulled myself together, well\nthe doctor explained to me I wasn\u2019t going to die from it, I got all the information I could possibly\nget. And I couldn\u2019t stop reading books about cancer. That was all I read, because the more I got,\nthe better 1t was for me to ease my anxiety, although some of these books were telling you just\nhorror stories about all what can happen, and it may have not been my situation, but you know,\npredicting that if this is this, that\u2019s what happens. So Isaac said to me, \u201cI will forbid you reading\nanother book about cancer.\u201d He had it.",
        "A: Yeah, it did. That\u2019s what helped.",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely. I think that children should know, because this is part of their\nheritage, as you said. And I think when people know their roots, and they know their own life,\nabout -- I mean, they know about their parents, their grandparents, and if they know further than\nthat, and about their communities, they are better -- they have roots. They have better rooting, I -\n- as they call it, which I think helps them as human beings, because they feel connected. You\nknow, they feel the connection there from way back.",
        "A: A little bit. At the beginning I was a little concerned, but I liked the man so much, and I\nthought he was such a good s -- man for my daughter, that this should not be an obstacle, if, you\nknow, everybody was willing to cooperate in that factor. And I remember -- so they had a dual\nceremony. It was at sen -- what\u2019s it called? Saint Columbus Episcopal -- Episcopal church. But\nthere was a rabbi present, so the two, the rabbi, and the priest -- priest, right?",
        "A: Both had a part of the ceremony, and I was reminding to my daughter that nobody trying to\noutdo the other. They were very equal in their thing, and it was really a wonderful thing to have\nthat, because it honored both families. And obviously David\u2019s family, you know, felt that there\nshould be an Episcopalian marriage, and we felt that 1t should be a Jewish wedding, but we\ndidn\u2019t want this thing to become a -- a problem for them. So they handled it very nicely, very\nnicely. But I remember passing that church often, and saying to myself, how would I feel when\nmy daughter gets married here? And then I decided that I had to visit the church. I had to go\ninside, and sit inside, and get the feel of it before the wedding. Because I didn\u2019t want to be\nbreaking down on the day of the wedding. And I did that a couple of times. I went and sat. And I\nbecame very comfortable. It was fine. And this is a very good marriage for them. He is a\nwonderful guy, great husband, wonderful father. So I have no reservations whatsoever. And I\nremember, 1-it was the first year they were married, and it was Christmas, and they were coming\nhere, and Maya said, \u201cCan we have a turkey?\u201d Because Christmas was always such a big thing\nfor David. You know, it was the first time he was away from his family, to a new country. I\nmean, things were difficult for him as well, and I 1mi -- immediately, you know, empathized with\nhim, because I came from a different country, and I was in a different place, no ma -- no matter\nhow much you love your spouse, it\u2019s still something you miss. And of course I made the turkey,\nand -- and he was so happy. He 1s a great guy. And my other fellow, my Mike, Nicole\u2019s husband.\nNicole\u2019s si -- Mike is Jewish. He is terrific. His parents had -- live in Evanston, in Illinois. He is\nfrom shi -- from there, too. He grew up there, went to the same school Nicole did in Wisconsin,\nUniversity of Wisconsin. He is terrific.",
        "A: Sarah\u2019s, yeah. Sarah\u2019s also -- she is not married to a Jewish fellow. I\u2019m not quite sure yet\nabout this relationship. It\u2019s very recent.",
        "A: Now you make me cry. There was a time that was very hard for me here. Raising children,\nIsaac was working very hard, felt kind of isolated, although I did have friends. And I had missed\nGreece. I missed the blue skies, and the blue sea. And I missed my family. The great sorrow was\nmy mother\u2019s death, my father\u2019s death. And certainly, having gone through the Holocaust is a\ngreat loss, but it\u2019s also a strength that you gain as a child, or as an adult, because you went\nthrough horrible things, and you know that you can survive things. You can live through many\ndifficulties. And I\u2019m a very patient person, and persevere. But life is worth living. Life is\nwonderful. No matter what happens to you, there must be something in your life that is good\nabout your life. Life is precious.",
        "A: The greatest joys are my grandchildren. I mean, they\u2019re -- I can\u2019t tell you how wonderful it is\nto have them. And what an addition to my life and Isaac\u2019s life has been. I have to tell you about\nIan. When Maya announced that she -- Maya and David came here, and they told us they were\nexpecting a baby, I was sitting on this chair, and I jumped up to the ceiling from joy. I was so\nhappy. The next day, I was diagnosed with cancer. And it seemed to me like why now? Here I\nam in heaven. I\u2019m so happy, I\u2019m going to have a grandchild, my first one. Why am I gonna have\ncancer now? I mean, I could have had it last year, two years ago, five years ago. Why now? It\nwas just terrible. But then, after the shock, I decided that I had to lead beca -- to live because I\nwanted to see that -- that grandchild. And I wanted to see Maya go through her pregnancy and be\nthere for her. Nobody was there for me when I was pregnant, or when I had children. I wanted to\nbe there for her.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome. I thank you, too.",
        "A: So, I didn\u2019t know it was Ian. We didn\u2019t know it was going to be a boy, and it was going to be\na -- but, I was thinking of this grandchild constantly, and I wanted to be well, both for my\ndaughter, and my grandson. And I remember Isaac said something very nice. Shortly after the\ndiagnosis, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand, why is this happening now, that I\u2019m going to become a\ngrandmother? I want to live to see my grandchild.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou will live to see this\ngrandchild, and many more to come.\u201d And that was such a nice thing to say. I remember when I\nwas doing -- I was in radiation therapy, and it was very close to Maya\u2019s delivery, I would s --\nasked the rad -- the -- the doctor there, the radiologist, \u201cCan I take time off when my daughter\nhas her baby?\u201d And for the moment she thought it was an out of town daughter, so she would say\nto me, \u201cI can\u2019t let you stop radiation. It doesn\u2019t work that way. You have to be here every single\nday except the weekend. If your daughter has the baby the weekend, you\u2019re gonna be lucky.\u201d So\nfinally I told her that my daughter lived here, and I had to be there. And she said to me, \u201cWe will\nmake every effort. We will schedule you for six o\u2019clock in the morning. We will schedule you\nfor 10 o\u2019clock at night. Whatever suits you, to help you out, so you can go see your grandchild.\u201d\nBut he was born the day after I finished radiation. I think he timed it very well. I was free, I was\nhappy. I wasn\u2019t radiating anything. And it was just great, was the greatest day.",
        "A: Yeah. Now I return to Greece every year. My sister lives there, and I have lots of friends, and\na nephew, and now he is a father, and about to become a second time father. So my friends date\nfrom the Girl Scout days, from high school. And I have two wonderful teachers that are probably\nin their late 80\u2019s or 90\u2019s that I see. And every time I see them, it\u2019s such a warm reception. Last\nyear I was in Greece, and they invited me to have coffee at a little coffee shop, two of them and a\n-- another good friend, who was also in the same school I was, but she was also in the Girl\nScouts with me. So actually she\u2019s the first one I call when I go to Greece. And we were talking\nabout all sorts of things, and then I said to them, \u201cHow do you remember me from my school\ndays?\u201d You know, I was 15 - 16. And it was such a warm feeling for them to talk about me, that\nthey thought I was a very sensitive child. I -- I had a lot of humanity, one of them said it. And\nthat this was very apparent. They both knew I had survived the Holocaust. Although I wasn\u2019t\nterribly good student, I was good student in some of the -- in their class I was a good student.\nOne taught -- taught history, and the other taught psychology. So I was very good in both classes.\nI wasn\u2019t good in math. So, I mean such encouragement that I was really a worthwhile person\nwhen I was there. And I kind of needed that, to hear it, that what was then, what is now. Because\nsometimes there\u2019s such a big gap between this ocean. And then the one who is a historian, she\nsent me a Christmas card, and she said how happy she was to see me in Greece, and that she\nalways remembers me with great affection. And that what she remembers is, here again, my\nhumanity, and she wishes my grandchildren have some of that, and that\u2019s the best wish she can\ngive me, which I think it\u2019s very nice.",
        "A: I think the sensitivity was there from the beginning, because I remember it was, even as a\nvery young child, I was sensitive to other people. My parents were very humane, both of them,\nso this is something I grew up with, and I saw it. But certainly, living through the Holocaust, and\nhiding, and seeing how people suffer, and deprivation that was going around, whether it was\nfood, or clothes, or lack of freedom, this thing certainly had a major role in my life.",
        "A: Oh sure. One thing I remember very well is I think I told you about jumping the fence to go\nplay with the little girl next door. Another vignette at that house -- that was the second house we\nwere hiding, in Kipserly. My sister and I were sharing a room, it was actually a big room, and\nwas divided as I said, with a screen. My parents were on one side, and my sister and I on the\nother. My sister used to tell me about a boyfriend she had. She was 10 years older, so she had a\nboyfriend, and she loved him dearly, and of course, she couldn\u2019t see him. And she was telling me\nhow much she missed him, and these kind of things. So one day I saw the corner, there was a -- a\nflorist, somebody who was selling violets, actually, not a florist, he was selling violets. So I had a\nlittle bit of money my father had given me just to keep it, just to -- to make me happy. I couldn\u2019t\nuse it anyway, since I wasn\u2019t going out, but once again I went out to the corner, and bought her a\nlittle bouquet of violets and brought them to her. And to me this was something to tell her that\ndon\u2019t be so sad, you know, that here are some violets. And I remember she was very, very happy\nabout that. She wasn\u2019t happy I left the house to go and do these kind of things, but it was\nsomething I remember with great fondness. Unfortunate, she doesn\u2019t remember it now. And\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s a little sad for me. But I remember thinking, how can I -- what can I do to make\nher happy.",
        "A: Oh I think they got together after the -- after the war was over, but then it didn\u2019t last very\nlong. I think he had another girl or something like that. I don\u2019t know the details, I don\u2019t\nremember the details, but I don\u2019t think it lasted very long.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t remember particularly being hungry, but I don\u2019t remember having a variety of\nfoods. Vegetables were usually the main thing, once a week maybe meats, or maybe not. Eggs\noccasionally. Lots of legumes, lots of beans and chick peas, and things like that, which were\nbasically the staple. Now after the war was over, we had coupons, and we could only buy food\nwith these coupons. We had to go to the grocery store, and depending who -- the number of\npeople in the family, they would give us a certain amount of food. Among them, a powdered\nsoup which we used to call American soup. It was powdered soup that had dry -- I mean, dry\nvegetables in there, and I remember there was barley, because I liked these little things that\nlooked like rice, but they were not rice. And you would simply add water, and boil it, and cook\nit. And this was basically her main thing for quite awhile. Then other things we ate was Spam,\nalso we could get it with a coupon, and what else? Oh, we ate potatoes instead of bread, because\nwe didn\u2019t have bread. So it was like a small potato per person, and the soup, and that was a meal.",
        "A: Yes, I think it did, that\u2019s why we called it American soup, yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure. Greeks eat potatoes, lots of potatoes. But the sizes of the potatoes were small.\nYou couldn\u2019t have two potatoes if you wanted to, because there was a ration, so [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, almost immediately after the war, in December of \u201944 was the civil war started. So it\nwent on for two, three months, at least in Athens, near the villages, and up north it certainly\nlasted much longer. So for that period of time, it was -- I mean, food was scarce.",
        "A: The other memory which came actually a few days ago when I was driving. It was something\nin the street, something like a trash bag, or something, which I couldn\u2019t determine from -- from\nfar what it was, but there was definitely something there, I was thinking I must avoid this. I\nthought for a moment it may be an animal. It -- it reminded me that when a German was shot by\nGreeks, there would be a roundup of the neighborhood, and they would take all the men above\n60. And I remember one day we her -- heard the shots, and we couldn\u2019t determine what it was.\nBut we looked from the window, and at the intersection -- the -- the house was almost in the\nmiddle of the block, there was something in the middle of that intersection. We couldn\u2019t tell\nwhether it was a person that had been shot, and it was there, or anything else. And my sister\noffered to go and look. And I remember my terror of having her go to look, and what if she were\ncaught? If the Germans were around there, and would catch her? And to this day when I see\nsomething in the middle of the street that looks bigger than a little something, I always have this\nimage in front of me.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t a body, no. It was some kind of trash, I think, that has been kicked in the middle of\nthe street, of the intersection. But I mean, the agony, because we knew what was coming next.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: Towards the Greeks?",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t see the horrors, except occasionally when I saw a German kicking an old man\noutside my window. But I knew that there were things going on. At times my parents will talk,\nand they will ti -- try to protect me, or talk somewhat in code, so I wouldn\u2019t understand, but I\ncould figure things out, and put things together, sometimes with great imagination, but\npersonally, I mean, I didn\u2019t see any other horrors, other than what I heard. But, I mean, the\nGermans, everybody was afraid of them, because they knew that from one moment to the other,\nthey would wrap things up and take people away, and off they go.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I think they all protected me. I was an overprotected child. They all protected me,\nand in turn, I think I -- I was trying to -- to protect my parents and my sister by not complaining,\nnot whining, not -- not asking for things I knew I couldn\u2019t have. So I was trying to -- to be rather\nquiet about things, because I knew they were upset to begin with. I mean, I could tell.",
        "A: Well, I think my mother always was saying that I was -- I had a wonderful nature. But I was\nvery much -- I remember once there was the end of the war, it was right the days before that --\nthe end of the war. We were still in hiding, but the atmosphere w-was such, because everybody\nwas expecting something was going to happen. I think the news we had heard, and the man of\nthe house had come and was saying well, things are going to change in a day or two. There were\nrumors. All of a sudden we were sitting in the garden I remember, it was a -- a nice day, and Is -\n- | burst into tears, out of nothing. I mean, I started car -- crying and sobbing, and nobody could\nunderstand what happened. My mother thought a bee stung me, or you know, something\nhappened. And I just couldn\u2019t stop crying. So finally I remember the woman who was hiding us\nsaying to my mother, \u201cWhat happened to this child? I mean, she never cries.\u201d And my mother\nsaid, \u201cWell, maybe she has gone through a lot, and that\u2019s as much as she can take.\u201d So -- but I\nwas always keeping things inside, and not expressing too much. First of all, I was told not to talk\nmuch, because they didn\u2019t know to whom I was going to talk, and what I was going to say. So\nthis was instilled in me, and I understood it, that I shouldn\u2019t talk much. And this carried on, also,\npast my hiding years, because many times I remember I was always observant, but I wouldn\u2019t\ntalk much. And people would say, well is she here, is she participating, or what? So, it has\ncarried to many, many years, yeah, even now sometimes. I mean, I may be in a group of people,\nand I may have my own thoughts, but Ill be the last one to express them. If I\u2019m asked\nspecifically, I will. But I wouldn\u2019t jump in.",
        "A: Yeah, yes I did. Yeah.",
        "A: The only time I remember somebody coming was the second house -- in the second house.\nThe person who had found that house for us, he was a -- a former general, but he -- he was\nretired, or maybe he was not, but anyway, he used to come periodically to see us. And when the\nGermans came -- I mean, the Greek SS came to get my father, he was -- he who was -- it was my\nsister who notified him, and after they brought my father back, after he paid them handsomely,\nwe went to his house. He came and took us. Again, he didn\u2019t -- he took my father first, and then\nhe took -- I don\u2019t know if he came back for my mother, myself, and my sister, or 1f we went\nourselves, but we went and spent a couple of nights there, so he could find another house for us\nto stay. So he was the only one I remember visiting, nobody else.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: There was a third one.",
        "A: Yeah, well after the second house, when the Greek SS were watching the house, and they\nburst in one day, saying they want the people to -- to measure the -- the gas, or something like\nthat -- and got my father. They brought him back several hours later after he paid them. He had\nsome gold coins, gold pounds sewn around his waistband, and that\u2019s why they brought him back,\nbut they -- they warned us that we had to leave within an hour, or two hours at most, because\nthey couldn\u2019t guarantee anything. When my father was gone, my si -- mother and my sister\ndecided to notify this friend, this general, and my sister jumped over the terrace, to the next\nhouse, who was a -- also a family friend, a judge. He was a judge, I believe he was in the\nSupreme Court, but I\u2019m not sure. So he notified them, and from there they called this general,\nwho came to -- there was a market, a big market near the house we were staying in Kipserly, and\nhe went to that market, so he could see the house. So he was pretending to look at the eggs, and\nto make sure the eggs were okay, you know you usually look at them in the sun to see whether\nthey are rotten or not. And -- so he was pretending to look at eggs, and so he could see whether\nthere was anybody coming or going in the house. The moment he saw they brought my father 1n,\nand when he saw these guys leave, he came to the house, and he took my father to his house.\nAnd then, either he came back for us, or we went back, within -- it wasn\u2019t within walking\ndistance, but we definitely walked it. And then th -- this family found another place for us. We\nstayed with them I think two nights. There were two children there, and -- a boy and a girl, and\nthe parents.",
        "A: The Greek SS. Greek SS.",
        "A: They were working for the Germans. They were paid by the Germans. And of course, if they\nwould bring Jews, they would get paid more. So their job was to find Jews in hiding.",
        "A: Yeah. They collaborated with the Germans. They -- they were not that many, but the ones that\nwere -- were -- certainly afterwards some of them were sent to prison for life. A couple of them\nwere executed. Others left the country. They couldn\u2019t survive in the country any more, having\ndone what they\u2019ve done. So --",
        "A: Oh my God, he was shaken, absolutely shaken. Absolutely shaken. And of course, having\neven the money he had, you know, that left us with very little money. The -- the rest of the\nmoney was -- some other coins -- I mean, not coins, pounds, British pounds, gold, that my\nmother had sewn around her bra, and my sister had also sewn around the bra. I was too little to\nhave a bra, so they couldn\u2019t put any coins on me. Besides, they didn\u2019t trust me. So, you know.",
        "A: Right, right. Yeah, that\u2019s right. And I remember my mother sewing it so elaborate, and so\ncarefully, you know, so none of it will slip out. It was like individual little pockets for each -- for\neach pound. I still have one golden pound my father gave me years later because I was asking if\nhe could give me one I wanted for a souvenir, and I\u2019m never going to cash this. I -- I just wanted\nto keep it.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No. I think the jewels were either given away or put away. My mother had a diamond ring,\nwhich was her engagement ring, but she wasn\u2019t wearing it. So I don\u2019t know where she kept it.\nBut that one I know she -- she had, because she always thought she can sell it. She didn\u2019t sell it.\nThere were no other jewels.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I remember my mother had the pearl necklace which was short, but it was\nwhat women wore those days. And I have it now. And that I remember was one of her precious\nthings. My mother didn\u2019t wear an awful lot of jewelry. So maybe she gave a few things to friends\nfor safekeeping. I don\u2019t remember having safe deposit boxes those days, and things like that in\nbanks, you know. So, I -- \u2019'm not sure how much was saved.",
        "A: Yeah, I could hear again my sister and my mother talking, and also the man of the house,\nAndonis, but here again, I was sent out of the room, as usual. Story of my life. So, I could -- even\nthough -- I mean, I could hear a little bit, but I couldn\u2019t hear very clearly what happened.\nBasically they told him that they wanted money, and un -- unless they had money, they were\ngoing to bring in the -- the SS. Was as simple as that.",
        "A: Luckily he had, yeah, he was a little hefty around the waist, so that took a few extra pounds. I\nmean golden pounds.",
        "A: Yeah, we went to the Padzopoulus house. So -- and I\u2019m sure it was very dangerous for them.\nAnd I remember how shaken the lady, Mrs. Padzopoulus was, for us being there, for what\nhappened to us. She wasn\u2019t sure whether a -- anybody had follow us on the way. I remember the\ndinner. Obviously she hasn\u2019t planned for four more people. She had zucchini stuffed with rice,\nwhich is a common Greek dish. And she had put one zucchini per person for the two men, for\nmy father and her husband. Half a zucchini for herself and my mother, and a smaller zucchini for\nthe children, the three children and my sister. But I remember that half zucchini, with a lot of\ntomato sauce around it, in a large plate. And it was just about a bite, or maybe two bites, three\nbites at most. And that was it, there was nothing else. I mean, people didn\u2019t have a lot of stuff. So",
        "A: Greek Orth -- right.",
        "A: Right. Yes, yes. And of course the family we were hiding with, the Viyas family, yes.",
        "A: To anew place in the -- the region of Gizzi. And there was a family, there were the parents\nand one -- one daughter. She was younger than my sister, so she must have been about 18. 17 -\n18, some like that. Very nice people, all of them. I remember the -- the mother, Mrs. Catina, she\nwas so good to me, you know, because I -- I was always the youngest, so they all thought -- were\ntreating me very nicely, all of them. So she would make something special, like maybe she\nwould make a little cookie, and give it to me, but nobody else will have it, or things like that.",
        "A: I only heard of one family, that they had been taken to prison, but they had not been shot, or\nsomething. But I know it was something that everybody feared, because that was well known\nthat can happen. But I personally don\u2019t know of anybody other than this family.",
        "A: Tucked me in -- I think I would say good -- good-night to my parents. Well, by then I was\nlike 11, right? I would say good-night to my parents and give them a kiss. I always did, that was\na ritual, a good night ritual, and good morning ritual, too. It -- I think sometimes my sister will\ngive me a kiss and just make sure I was tucked in, but not always. But she would look after. Tell\nme stories, no, I don\u2019t think anybody told me stories, including my grandmother. When I was\nmuch younger, I wanted her to tell me stories, because everything I heard was that grandmothers\ntell stories to their grandchildren. And my grandmother -- my grandmother wasn\u2019t educated, she\nhad gone up to six -- to -- to fourth grade, but she was a very intelligent woman. She would say\nto me, \u201cWell in the summer you cannot tell stories, because your clothes smell. It\u2019s too hot.\u201d So\nthat didn\u2019t register very well with me, but anyway, she said it, I thought it must be true. Then in\nthe wintertime, you know, grandmothers tell stories by the fireplace. Well, 1t was too hot to be\nnear the fireplace, so she couldn\u2019t tell any stories. Things like that.",
        "A: Exactly. I think that was the case. They may have been praying privately, but you couldn\u2019t\nsay anything about being Jewish, anything that would just even give the slightest suspicion even\nto the people you were hiding, you know. The people that were hiding you, actually, although\nthey were kind people, and they knew you were Jewish, you couldn\u2019t do anything -- or at least\nwe. I can\u2019t say for everybody else. But the thing was that you don\u2019t do anything to -- to arise any\nsuspicion, or to make things different, so people will say oh, they are doing things differently.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nBeginning Tape Five, Side B",
        "A: Well, I was asleep, so I couldn\u2019t hear if they did, other than the time that I could hear the\nGerman words out of my window when my head was covered with a blanket, I was -- I was\nasleep the rest of the time.",
        "A: Little privacy --",
        "A: Yeah, probably there was little privacy. But you know, I would go out in the yard, the\nbackyard was rather secluded, you know, there were trees around. So whether they talked then or\nnot, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yeah, I remember the two of them, my father and mother were playing cards, they were\nplaying pinochle. I remember them both smoking so much, the room was so foggy because of all\nthat smoke. Was one cigarette after the other. Those days we didn\u2019t know much about cigarettes,\nyou know, but it certainly did something for them, because they were so anxious. My mother\ntook -- my father didn\u2019t have much to do, because the man of the house was -- you know, had\ngone to the base, he was in the Navy, as I said before. And my mother would help with the\ncooking, or she will do the cooking, the woman will do the shopping. So my mother was a little\nmore busy than my father. Now you asked me before how I would pass my day. I remember my\nmother tried to teach me how to embroid, and my mother was excellent in embroiding. She has\ndone beautiful pieces, and I have some of her pieces, which I treasure. But I just didn\u2019t have the\npatience to do that. I mean, I couldn\u2019t sit quiet, and just trying to put a little -- my needle in the\nlittle hole there, and get pleasure out of it. It was the most boring thing for me. So I wasn\u2019t\nparticularly interested. And a little bit of knitting was more to my liking. But I wasn\u2019t very good\nat that too. So these things didn\u2019t really attract me, or just, you know, give me any particular\npleasure in doing. So most of it, as I said, I had two books that I\u2019ve read, and then I got ahold of\nthis weekly mag -- I think it was either weekly or monthly children\u2019s magazine, which was\ncalled, The Development of Children. But they had some wonderful stories in there. So I read --\nsome of them were a continuation, you know, so you would wait for the next. I think, now that I\nthink about it, I think Mrs. Padzoupolus would send me this magazine -- the woman whose house\nwe went after they got my father, the general\u2019s house. Somehow her children had it, and then\nafter they would read it, they would -- I don\u2019t know how I got it, because I don\u2019t know whether\nthey mailed it, whether the man of the house would go to their house and get it, I have no idea.\nBut I know that I had it, and it was wonderful, because it was like a four page little newspaper,\nyou know, that I could read from the beginning to the bottom, and it was -- it was good. I knew\nsome of these things so much by heart.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I had a doll that her name was Ellie. It was one of these plastic dolls, but you know\nthe ones that they break, you know, lo -- those days we had these dolls, how did they call them?\nWe used to call them bone dolls, but often their legs will come off, and -- or their hands will\ncome off, and then there was a piece of elastic collecting the two. I had an uncle who used to fix\nthem beautifully for me. And this doll, she -- she didn\u2019t have hair -- I mean, her hair was like part\nof the -- of the material the doll was made, that she had like two braids on the side. And she was\nsmall, very small. And -- but my mother and my sister had made me clothes for this doll out of\nvery small pieces of things, or -- I remember a little blue jacket with a little white handkerchief,\nyou know, in the pocket. And I just loved that ra -- I loved dressing my doll, and playing with\nher. Yes, I -- my doll was -- probably saved me, it was my companion, my confidant.",
        "A: No, it wouldn\u2019t fit in my pocket, maybe it was a little bigger than my pocket, but not tiny -\ntiny. However, I had this doll with me, somehow it survived. And I kept it, 1t was on my bed\nafter the -- the war was over, and I got married, I brought it to the United States, and I had it with\nme in California, and one day Sarah opened the drawer and got it, and she dropped it, and the\nhead broke, and that was the end of Ellie.",
        "A: Yes, that doll was very important. In fact, now I remember. After we left the first -- first\nhouse, and before we went to the second one, when I stayed with this older gentleman, they came\nto pick me up -- my sister came to pick me up, the couple that helped us find the second house\ngave me a doll, but I didn\u2019t like that doll at all. She was very ugly. And I remember saying thank\nyou, you know, and -- but I never played with that doll, never. I-It was -- it -- it wasn\u2019t a -- a\nbeautiful doll, you know, something that appealed to me at all.",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, here you think, you know, a child -- here I\u2019m giving a child a present, she\ndoesn\u2019t have anything, and I just didn\u2019t like that doll.",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- she was a rag doll, and I didn\u2019t like her face. I didn\u2019t think she -- I didn\u2019t like her\nface. Who knows, I liked my little Ellie. But Sarah took care of that, my daughter Sarah.",
        "A: Yola, her name was Yola.",
        "A: Yolanda, but we call her Yola. Of course, during the occupation, she was Yanna, like Joanne.\nMy name was not Paulette, 1t was Paulexani, they used to call me Polly, or sometimes Sandy. So\neverybody had a different name, and different last name. So I got used to the Polly.",
        "A: No, never, never. Once, actually, come to think of 1t, my sister and I had gone for a walk. It\nwas dusk, and as we were walking, we encountered a friend of mine with her mother, from\nVolos, who called, \u201cYola, Yola.\u201d And we -- Yola just pushed me, and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t answer,\nkeep walking.\u201d So we kept on walking as if we didn\u2019t know them, because if somebody else was\naround, you know, it would have been -- and her daughter who -- who was my friend,\nunfortunate she died, she remembers that, and 1 -- she told me, she said, \u201cAnd I told my mother,\ndon\u2019t call them, they don\u2019t want to be recognized.\u201d But it was, you know, such a -- a wonderful\nthing of seeing somebody you know, and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to these people, you\nimmediately say hey, you know?",
        "A: No, they were not Jewish, no. But they were friends from Volos, yeah.",
        "A: Exactly. So even if you knew anybody, you didn\u2019t ne -- have these freedom to -- to greet\nthem, you know, to embrace them, to -- to recognize them, you know. You had to keep going, as\nif they were strangers. It was terrible.",
        "A: Oh there\u2019s no doubt our lives have been a -- affected. Obviously they\u2019ve been affected\ndifferently. Yola was 20 at the time, I was 10. So you know, she had a better grasp of what was\ngoing on. And my parents included her, while they didn\u2019t include me, in all sorts of preparations,\nor you know, discussions, because of her age. I think when the war was over, I think Yola, who -\n- who got married in \u00b046, was -- that was shortly after the war. But still, you know, the remnants\nof the deprivation were still with us. So she -- she just wanted everything. She wanted the nice\nhouse, and lot of clothes, she -- she just felt that she didn\u2019t have those things, and she had to\nmake up al -- for all these things. So -- and I -- I yust didn\u2019t particularly care. I was a little bit of a\ntomboy. There were difference. I mean, we\u2019re different people. Our personalities are like day and\nnight. So --",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s true. I mean, she -- she definitely protected me and she treated me like her little sister,\nyou know. So I didn\u2019t have to know everything, but I think they probably thought the less I\nknow, the better off Iam. From my perspective now, if -- I mean, if any of my grandchildren\nwere involved in a situation, I would have the same concerns about telling them everything, you\nknow, I mean, at this age. Although they are much younger, they are six and seven, the older\nboys. So, you know, you\u2019re -- but I think they could have said a little more, at least from my\nperspective, to -- to calm me down. The fact that don\u2019t worry -- that you say don\u2019t worry,\neverything will be all right, will -- will be okay, wasn\u2019t enough to -- to make me stop worrying,\nbecause there was nothing concrete. The don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s a very vague kind of thing. Don\u2019t\nworry, but what if, you know, something happens, or what if that happened. The only thing,\nsurprisingly, that gave me a lot of comfort, was a plan we had to escape, particularly from the\nsecond house in -- in Kipserly. This was the house that had that fence, the one I jumped to go to\nthis little girl\u2019s house to play with. And I remember we had a plan in place that should the\nGermans come, they would certainly come from the front, or -- we could all go to the backyard\nand jump the fence, and by then we would be to the next block. So by then we could run or do\nsomething. How -- we never put that plan in effect, actually we never need it -- needed it. But it\ngave me comfort that there was something we could do, something concrete that I was involved\nin, because they -- they told me what to do, and in fact we had a little bundle of a few clothes,\nyou know, that we could take if we had time. But the thing was that we had to leave right away,\nand jump the fence, and that will take us through the yard of the next people, to the next block.\nSo --",
        "A: Yeah, that bundle was ready. That bundle was ready always. Couple of changes of clothes,\nand that was it. Maybe my doll, I don\u2019t know. No, my doll wasn\u2019t in there, because I always had\nit with me, yeah.",
        "A: It was under the bed, yeah. It was under the bed.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, she -- she 1s a beautiful woman. She always dressed very elegantly. I mean, her\nhusband was very willing, when he could, to get her the best things. So she became a very well-\ndressed lady, you know, and I think she got a lot of pleasure out of it, yeah.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: I think she met him through -- through a friend. Freddy was the cousin of the friend who took\nme in when I went to Montreal. I remember when I got engaged to Isaac, I lived with a family in\nMontreal for six months, until my visa was ready for me to come to the United States. Well, Joe\nCalderone was the name. His mother and father were friends of my parents. Joe was a cousin to\nFreddy, okay? So Yola was very friendly with Joe and his wife, his current -- I mean his wife,\nand you know, they used to -- to be together in gatherings, and that\u2019s where she met Freddy. And\nthey made it in \u201946, which was still very shortly after the war, and you know, I mean, things were\nnot that well yet, you know? We were still -- had financial problems. The factory wasn\u2019t -- was\njust beginning to -- to work. But it wasn\u2019t producing what it did before the war, certainly not.\nAnd -- but yeah, everybody was very happy. When she got married she had a wedding gown, and\n-- and I was happy, and I told Freddy that I\u2019m glad that he is marrying my sister, because I can\nhave a -- a new dress for the wedding. So he always remembered that, he thought it was really\ncute.",
        "A: Oh, four years, five years, some like that. I used to get Yola\u2019s dresses, and my mother would\nhem them, but you know, there is a 10 year difference, so you can imagine the hem was like\nanother dress almost, plus she would take it in, and my dresses were always kind of loose, and\nhanging, and I never liked them.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I mean, I remember my father always wearing a vest, a shirt and a vest, of course no\ntie in the house. And my mother always wore a -- a housedress, or a skirt and blouse, some like\nthat. We didn\u2019t have a lot of clothes with us, so when -- since we didn\u2019t go out, you know, we\ndidn\u2019t need to have anything. Now that we\u2019re talking about clothes, there\u2019s something else. After\nthe war was over, and I think it was after the civil war in \u201944, there was help that had come from\nthe United States, you know, in -- relief. And among them, there was what we used to call\nUNRRA, UN -- United Nations Relief Agency. And they were distributing clothes. So I needed a\ncoat, and my mother took me to get a coat. So we looked through the different bins, or thing, and\nshe came up with a brown coat that was down to my ankles, really long, and I didn\u2019t like it, but it\nwas wool, and it was warm, and she wanted me to have it, because it was winter. I cried, and\ncried and cried, because I just didn\u2019t like this coat. I wanted something else, but everything else\nwas either too small for me, or too big for me and [indecipherable]. So finally I ended up having\nthat coat, but here again, she had to hem it to make it approximately my size.",
        "A: [indecipherable] having -- having -- a friend of mine tells me a wonderful story which brings\ntears to my eyes. She was two years old when she and her parents went to a concentration camp.\nShe -- the parents were Spanish citizens, so they went to Bergen-Belsen. Now when the -- which\nwas supposedly a little better treatment than, you know, the other camps but still, was a\nconcentration camp. When the war was over, and they came out, they went to -- to France, or to\nItaly, I think, to -- to a center until they will be relocated. So -- no, to France, I think they went.\nAnd they had coupons to go buy clothes, to department stores. So her mother, and Lola\u2019s -- and\nmy friend Lola, went to a department store to get clothes. And as they were going up the stairs,\nthere was a mannequin of a child with a blue coat, and she fell in love with that little blue coat.\nSo they talked to the saleslady and they gave her the coupon, and she brought out a very dark\nlooking coat. And the little girl said, \u201cI don\u2019t like this coat, I like that blue one.\u201d And she said,\n\u201cNo, this is not for you.\u201d And she started crying. Then the manager came, and he said, \u201c\u201cWhy is\nshe crying?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause she wants that coat.\u201d \u201cNow that coat costs a lot of\nmoney. The ones we have set aside are these.\u201d\u2019 And they were the ugliest things you could think.\nI mean, dark colors for little kids, and things like that. So he said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, the little girl can\nhave the light blue coat.\u201d So he took it off the mannequin, and put it on my friend. And I thought\nit was such a moving story. And she was happy.",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, here comes humanity, you know? I mean, it\u2019s these tiny little things that make\nthe difference.",
        "A: He died at the age of 60. He died in 1973, of colon cancer. He worked with my father. I think\nI told you that they tried to -- to start another factory in Athens that made yarn, because they had\nsuch difficulty bringing yarn from England, and they thought it would modify, I mean, what they\nproduced. So this factory -- I mean, he was able to -- to get some partners, and he did go for\nawhile, but then, here again, it was difficult, and hard to get materials and things like that, so the\nfactory wasn\u2019t going very well, and Freddy decided to -- to work elsewhere, which was a big\nshock for my father, because he was counting on having his help. So -- but they didn\u2019t quite\nagree on how to manage the factory, and Freddy went elsewhere. So -- but he worked with my\nfather until -- I think when I came to United States in \u201958, he was still working with my father.\nHe probably left about 1960 -- in the middle of 60\u2019s, something like that.",
        "A: A little bit, yeah, yeah. A little bit. It was very disappointing to my father because he thought\nthat with hard work -- you know, my father was always somebody who would come up under\nhorrible circumstances, and Freddy saw no -- no future to -- to this factory. So I don\u2019t know who\nwas right, or who was wrong. They probably both were right, from their own perspective, you\nknow? [indecipherable] cause a lot of pain.",
        "A: She was 45 years old. She was born in 1900, yeah.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: [indecipherable] she was quite a lady, yeah.",
        "A: Well, my mother was a very quiet person. She was the eldest of three daughters, Julia and\nAnna. And I think she was quiet, but she was also a little bit like me, or I was like her, you know.\nShe was very sensitive, but not very outgoing. But she had a tremendous warmth, that people\nremember her. And everybody says, even now, that she was a grand dame, like a lady, a real\nlady. There\u2019s another vignette that I have to tell you, because that describes her. Many years ago,\nYola and I went back to Volos. And we went around the place where our house was, which\ndoesn\u2019t exist any more, has become apartment buildings. And we were walking through the\nneighborhoods, it was the first time I went back to Volos since I left Volos, since I came to the\nUnited States. That was in the -- \u201974 - \u00b075 -- 1974 - \u201975, approximately then. Yola had been to\nVolos before. And I think there was a lecture also, that we wanted to go. So I was telling Yola\nthat I always remember my mother will take me to a pastry shop called the Swiss. And I always\nremember the owner there, you know, talking to me, and giving me a little piece of pastry, or a\ncookie, or something. So Yola says, \u201cWell, we\u2019re gonna go that way anyway, so let\u2019s stop.\u201d So\nwe went, the sign still says the Swiss. And we go in, and the store is the same, nothing has\nchanged, you know, it\u2019s a narrow store, you know, the -- you know, all the pastries, and all the\nbreads there, and it\u2019s a fairly young man, a young man who recognizes Yola and says, \u201cYes, I\nremember you, you were here before.\u201d He is the son of the owner. And he says, \u201cWell, my father\ncomes here every day. He is 90 years old, and he sits there.\u201d In -- in the corner is this old man,\nyou know, asleep on a chair, and with his cane. And he goes -- [indecipherable] \u201cHere is my\nsister who lives in the United States.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he says, \u201cI have to tell my father.\u201d So he goes over\nand he -- he wakes his father up, and he says, \u201cFather, you know who this is?\u201d And he says,\n\u201cThis is the Moudzoukos daughters. This is Yola, and this is Paulette.\u201d And the man -- for a\nmoment he was trying to wake up. He gets up from the chair, shaking, and he embraces me, and\nhe starts crying. He says, \u201cI remember you. I remember your mother, what a lady she was. I\nremember bringing you here.\u201d I mean, it was such a moving moment. And then in the evening\nwe went to the lecture, and this woman recognizes Yola, and then she tells me -- Yola says,\n\u201cThis 1s my sister, Paulette.\u201d Says, \u201cOh Paulette, I was thinking of you a few days before.\u201d She is\na photographer, a professional photographer. And my mother, once a year, or twice a year, she\nused to take me to the studio to take my picture. In Greece there is, before Easter there\u2019s a\ncarnival, it\u2019s the four weeks of carnival. So children have parties, and they get dressed up in all\nsorts of costumes. So every time I would have a costume, my mother would take me out to have\nmy picture. And this woman tells me that she is moving her studio from where she were, to a\nnew place, and she was going through old negatives, and she found some of the negatives of me,\nand she was wondering wha --\nEnd of Tape Five, Side B\nBeginning Tape Six, Side A",
        "A: Oh. Yeah, so she was wondering what happened to me. She knew I had gone to -- to the\nUnited States. So she said to me, \u201cI will send you the negatives, because there\u2019s -- some of them\nyou may want to have them, you know, I don\u2019t need them any more. These were from 1930-\nsomething. But I never got them because I was leaving the next day, and she didn\u2019t send them.\nSo I never got them.",
        "A: We have a cousin in Volos, who 1s the president of the Jewish community there. His name is\nRaphael Freseese. And he is related -- he is third cousin, I think, or some like that. He is related\nbecause I think his grandmother was married to my grandmother\u2019s brother. I think that\u2019s the\nrelationship, and I remember his grandmother, a nice, wonderful old lady who would always\nbless me to become a bride, for her to see me a bride. Lovely woman. So, anyway, he has written\na book about the Jewish community of Volos, which he send me, and I correspond with him\noccasionally. Actually, the holidays I sent him a card, he sends me a card. I spoke to him on the\nphone a couple of times when I was in Greece. When I go to Volos I see him. I think it was in\n1975, or \u201974, there was a letter came from the Jewish community, they were going to have a 50\nyear reunion of the Jewish community of val -- of Volos, of the people who left Volos, because a\nlot went to the United States, a lot went to Israel, or other parts of Europe, or Athens. So they\nwere gathering everybody to go for this reunion, and I went with my sister. And it was -- it was\nsuch a nice thing. The first thing when you entered there, you know, they had pictures of all of\nVolos, the old Volos I remember. And there are pictures of my father, my grandfathers, the -- my\nfather and grandfather was the president, my gra -- yeah, my grandfather, his father, the president\nof the Jewish community. So there are prominent, big pictures of them, right on a panel. The\nfactory is very prominently displayed, since he was one of the biggest employers there. And then\nthe connections. You know, people remember me as a little kid. I mean, I left Volos when I was\n10. Here I\u2019m an old woman, I mean, grown up woman, you know, married with daughters of my\nown, and th-th -- there is that warmth, you know, of -- of the then, to the now. It comes through,\nit just comes through. So we had a wonderful two day affair, because then we -- the next -- they\nhad the Shabbat dinner. The women had cooked, and it was at the synagogue, it was service of\ncourse, and then the dinner. And the next day there were service Saturday morning, and then\nthey took us by bus to a place to swim, and then to have dinner, and then we went to one of the\nvillages up in Pilion. And at night there was a reception. So it was a very nice connection.",
        "A: Oh yeah, right now there are about a hundred people all together. Yeah, hundred -- 110 at\nmost. It wasn\u2019t a very large community, but I think about 27 percent of that community perished.\nAnd then, after the war, the ones who returned, returned to practically nothing, and they -- they\nleft Volos because there was hardly anything for them left, or to do. There were not jobs, so a lot\nof them left to go to the United States, or to Israel, or to Athens. So -- but that Jewish community\nis so small, but so connected. It has excellent relationship with a larger Volos community, there\nis mutual respect. Recently there\u2019s been a memorial that has been done there, and I mean, people\nlive together very nicely.",
        "A: I think so, because it\u2019s a smaller place, you know, and they know each other. There\u2019s great\nrespect for each other, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, we continued living in Athens, but we would go to Volos in the summer, because the\nfactory was still there, and my father was, you know, working there. And in the wintertime he\nwould commute from Athens to Volos. Once when we were in Volos, one summer, he -- he got a\nheart attack, and then he wasn\u2019t able to work for awhile. And I remember Freddy came to -- to\nVolos -- my father started -- helped start a -- build a -- a small airport in Volos, because Volos\nhad no airport. So the first plane that landed was a tiny, little plane that had Freddy, and a\ncardiologist, and Yola. They came to look after my father. So it landed on -- the first plane that\nlanded in that airport, isn\u2019t that interesting? And it was tiny plane. Then a few days later, Freddy\nremained in Volos to take care of the factory, and everything, and Yola and I left to go to -- to\nAthens, because she had a child by then, she had Maurice. And I remember my first flight, you\nknow, in this tiny little plane, and the pilot is totally incompetent, and I thought he was going to\nland in a roof in Athens, or someplace, I mean, he is going that close. It was such a tiny little\nplace, I mean, I was really scared.",
        "A: That was either \u201940 -- let\u2019s see, she was married \u00b046, it was probably \u201950, 1950 - \u00b051. Yeah,\nbecause her son was born 1950, yeah.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: It worked for a short period of time, but he -- the much more diminished -- wa -- first of all,\nthe machinery was all destroyed, you see, and they had to replace that, or part of that. The\nmachinery was German machinery, and it was brought from Germany before the war, so this was\nvery good machinery. It just didn\u2019t have the -- the means, the financial means, you know, to buy\nnew machinery, to get the whole thing started. It was very hard. But my father was a fighter, you\nknow, he wasn\u2019t -- a very kind man, very kind man. He couldn\u2019t stand people being hurt. He was\na very good employer, and I hear that now from people, that he was an excellent employer. He\nwas also involved in city affairs, I mean he was in the city council, he was in the Jewish\ncommunity, of course, he was -- he was a pillar of the society.",
        "A: Okay, well the world was hard for her. Living in other people\u2019s houses was hard for her. My\nfather wa -- my mother was always very clean, her house was always very orderly. She had\nexcellent taste. So for her to be at somebody else\u2019s house, it was very difficult. She -- I mean, she\nhad no other choice, you know. And before we went into hiding, during the Italian occupation,\nwhen we had lived in the villages of the mountains of Pilion, here again we were renting a room,\nor two rooms from somebody else\u2019s house. So that was hard for her, too, you know, to be ina\nvillage, here is this lady who 1s -- she wasn\u2019t spoiled, I want you to know, I mean, she was -- she\nwas a woman who had a good life, but she wasn\u2019t spoiled. So, you know, these things did take\nsome toll, I think. But I think the hardest thing for her was when we lost the factory, a lot of her -\n- of friends, who at least appeared to be friends during the good times, just disappeared. And that\nshe never forgot, that was a trauma for her, that the friends that she had helped, and friends that\nshe was counting on, and has been to their house, they have been to her house, kind of discarded\nus because they were not -- they didn\u2019t have money any more, for awhile. So that really\ntraumatized her.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I kept on telling her, because she used to say to me, \u201cDon\u2019t count so much on\nyour friends.\u201d And I would say, \u201cWhat? My friends are wonderful.\u201d You know, this kind of\nthing. She\u2019d say, \u201cWell, they are wonderful until things change.\u201d",
        "A: Exactly. I think she did. The war did that, her friends did that. And it was a constant struggle,\nyes.",
        "A: Yeah, I think my mother catered a lot to my father, because he -- he had diabetes, so she\nalways took good care of him. I mean, she would -- those days they used to weigh things,\nbecause you know, you have to eat a certain amount of carbohydrates, and a certain amount of\nprotein, I think. But this became her responsibility of taking care of him in this way. And she\nwould weigh everything. I remember he loved cherries, so the season of cherries would come,\nand they would count like eight cherries on the little plate, and he would say, \u201cWhat is this, eight\ncherries? Bring the bowl of cherries here.\u201d And she would freak out, say, \u201cBut these are\nweighted.\u201d You know, so it was like the joke, we weigh things and he -- he would sneak a few\nother cherries, you know, from the bowl. So yes, but he did count on her support. She was very\nsupportive of him, she was always there for him. I mean, they had a very close relationship. But\nshe begun to get depressed, and I think she had great difficulty overcoming this depression and\nslowly with every more d -- every difficulty that came along, it was harder for her to come on --\nto overcome this. So I guess she slowly started withdrawing, and withdrawing more and more.\nThen she had -- her appetite was diminished. She also had a problem with saliva, she couldn\u2019t\nproduce enough saliva to chew her food. And I don\u2019t know if this was the result of a dental\nprocedure that she had, or not, I -- I -- I\u2019m not quite clear, I don\u2019t remember, actually, at this\npoint. But she -- she had lost saliva, so she couldn\u2019t chew her food, and it was very painful. And\nshe started losing a tremendous amount of weight. Then she was put on medication and on some\nvitamins, and things like that.",
        "A: I think -- the depression, you know, was -- was -- it was there but not very prominent in the\n50\u2019s. I think towards the -- the end of the fift -- probab -- probably after I left, I think things got\nworse, because also the difficulties with the factory became much more. There were a couple of\nclients who had big orders, and they cancelled them because they had financial problems and\ncouldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t do it. So that, of course, affected our financial situation. So, I think she got\ntired, and she just didn\u2019t want to fight any more. And I left in *58, so I\u2019m sure that my leaving\nwas something, you know, difficult for her. She always hoped to be able to come and visit me,\nand see me in my new place. She wasn\u2019t able to do that, my father\u2019s heart condition and diabetes\nwere not doing too well, plus all the financial difficulties, you know, couldn\u2019t -- they couldn\u2019t\nafford the trip. It was that simple. So I think that certainly made her upset, and unhappy, in\naddition to everything else.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. Yola was always there for her, and she used to take her to doctor, or take her\nplaces, you know, and things like that. So yeah, Yola was always there. And of course, Maurice,\nher -- her little grandson who was there, who was a great pleasure to her, yes, much.",
        "A: I wish that too, I think she -- she was upset, and I was upset I didn\u2019t have any wedding photos.\nBut I took Sarah there when Sarah was six months old, and she just -- that was in 1960. Sarah\nwas born 1960. And she just loved her. Sarah was a very feisty baby, very, very light, very small\nbaby, but my goodness. A friend of mine who had her baby with Sarah, we put them both in a\nplaypen. She said to me, \u201cI thought my child was retarded compared to yours.\u201d Cause she was\nmoving, she was in constant move and action. And she was just great, and I think that did a lot of\ngood to her to -- to have her there. But then we left, we came back to United States, so here she\nwas left empty handed again. So that was hard for her. And she freaked out when I -- I said to\nmy mother, \u201cI\u2019m going to send a case of Gerber baby food for Sarah when I come.\u201d And she\nsaid, \u201cWhat? You\u2019re going to feed your child food from the can, or from a jar? Is that what you\ndo in the United States? We never did things like that.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, everybody here uses this\nkind of food for babies.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen you come here, we\u2019re gonna cook for the baby.\nWe\u2019re have -- I bought a meal, I\u2019m gonna mush everything.\u201d So she cooked for her, everything\nwas hand -- I me -- pur\u00e9ed, and prepared the way she knew how to do it, yeah. That\u2019s it.",
        "A: The best. She -- right, the best. She was a great caretaker, great caretaker. She was -- they had\nfun with Sarah. They borrowed a playpen, so we will put her in the middle of the living room,\nyou know, and we'll enjoy her just playing around. And that was great for them. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m so\nglad that she saw at least one gr-grandchild, because she died in 1962, so she had not seen Maya\nand Nicole. My father saw all three, because a year after my mother died, I went with Maya.\nMaya was a year old then. And also my grand -- my nephew was being Bar Mitzvahed, so we\nwent. So he saw them. And then when he was quite sick I took Nicole, who was about three. And\nhe saw Nicole, too. So he saw all three grandchildren. It\u2019s hard when you\u2019re that far away, yeah.\nMy mother died in 1962, and by then she was quite broken, quite depressed, quite desperate, I\nguess, so she committed suicide. Which was a terrible [indecipherable |",
        "A: She committed suicide, she took an overdose of something called belladonna, which is -- it\u2019s\na stimulant, a heart stimulant. They don\u2019t use it any more, because it\u2019s so powerful. I was in the\nUnited States, so I learned it from the unites -- here. And I was not able to go to the funeral,\nbecause we lived in California at the time, Sarah was a baby, she was like two years old, I mean\nshe was -- I couldn\u2019t leave her with anybody. And so -- we didn\u2019t have the money also to -- you\nknow, to travel from California to Greece. So, it was -- you know, when I went back in \u201963 with\nMaya and Sarah, Sarah was three, three and a half, and Maya was one at the time, or before one.\nShe celebrated her first birthday in Greece. That was like a year and a half after my mother had\ndied. Everybody came to the airport, my sister, my father, and my aunts. Friends of mine came,\nand my friends told me later that they wanted to be there to greet me because they knew that\nsince my mother wasn\u2019t there, they didn\u2019t want me to feel the void, which I did feel the void. But\nyou see, I lived in her house -- actually it wasn\u2019t the same house that I left to come to United\nStates from, because after my mother died, and my father moved to -- to a smaller apartment\nnear my sister. So I\u2019ve never been to this apartment before, but I was still looking for her. So it\nwas like I was grieving for her, two and a half year -- one and a half years later, where everybody\nwas finally coming to terms a little bit with it. And it was a very awkward kind of situation\nbecause it -- although it wasn\u2019t the same house, this was the same furniture, the same pictures, all\nthese kinds of things. And she wasn\u2019t there, you know? It was -- it was a difficult visit, yeah.",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t begin to heal like 20 years later.",
        "A: Oh, the other people?",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s right, yeah.",
        "A: Right. That\u2019s right, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, I think it was a gradual depression. I think -- I think that she saw no future to anything.\nYou know, I think depression -- and we are talking about clinical depression, we are not talking\nabout just having the blues, it -- if it\u2019s not addressed, that\u2019s how it -- it ends up. And those days,\nyou know, people didn\u2019t understand depression, I think they don\u2019t understand depression even\ntoday in many ways. Greece 1s not a -- a place where people, you know, understand these kind of\nthings. Certainly nobody in the family understood the enormity of it. I think she did see a doctor,\nwho maybe put her on antidepressants or something, but that was shortly before she died. So, it\nwas not a long therapy before that. You know, she just didn\u2019t have -- she had lost the -- the zest\nfor life. Everything seemed to be just enormous for her, even if I would say, well, can my friends\nstay for dinner, and this was a friend she knew, and somebody, you know, she didn\u2019t have to\nparticularly make something special, it seemed like it was too much for her. Or they had to move\nfrom one apartment to the other because the lease expired and this man was raising the price.\nAnd that was a tremendous thing for her, to -- to have to move again. To -- to pack, to organize. I\nmean, she had moved many times 1n her life, so things become enormous all of a sudden. I mean,\nthe slightest thing becomes enormous. And I think she just couldn\u2019t deal with any of that any\nmore.",
        "A: She left a note -- well, first of all, you know, all these pills were missing from -- from the\nbottle, and the bottle was next to her bedside. Her -- she left a note, but it wasn\u2019t found until a\nmonth later, or something like this, which was a note left to my father and to my sister. And\nbasically she was telling my father that, you know, what are we waiting -- I mean, what does life\nhave to offer us any more? We -- our children are married, they are taken care of. You know,\nthere\u2019s nothing really to hold us here any more. And another thing she was telling Yola is to take\ncare of me, because I\u2019m her little sister, yeah.",
        "A: It is sad, yeah. I was reading her last letter to me a couple of days ago, which I received in\nCalifornia after she died. Because she died April 11\", and I think this was written like the eighth\nof April. And I was trying to di -- I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve read that letter many times, because I\u2019m trying to --\nto determine what is in this letter that I could have deciphered that she was suicidal. And there is\nnothing in that letter that -- all she says is that now she\u2019s eating a little better, she has a little\nmore appetite, that Yola takes her to the doctor, that she is glad I\u2019m not there to -- to -- to see all\nthe difficulties my father is going through -- she\u2019s still protecting me. And she talks a little bit\nabout the future, like, you know, send me a picture of Sarah or something like that, which is, you\nknow, like looking forward to something, right? Although she says in the note that there\u2019s\nnothing to look forward to. Maybe three days before she had not decided to end her life, who\nknows? But I\u2019ve read -- I\u2019ve read that letter over and over trying to -- I\u2019ve taken -- it took me a\nlong time to come to terms with this, I\u2019d say 20 years. It\u2019s a long time. And as I said, I\u2019m in a\nwonderful profession that I can have access to all sorts of material. I\u2019ve gone to s-seminars, to\nworkshops, I mean, conferences. And I always, for a long time, when I was trying to resolve this,\nI was getting into workshops that had to do with suicide, because there, you know, I mean there\nis a variety of workshops, and some of them had to do with suicide. Aftermaths of suicide,\nsurvivors of -- of people who have suicided. Professionals who survived the suicide of a client.\nYou know, all sorts of things. So, 1 -- I was almost like drunk when I was getting all this\nmaterial, which I have really read, and studied, and thought about, and worked at it. And you\nknow, 1-it\u2019s something that sticks with you. It doesn\u2019t -- it\u2019s -- because it\u2019s not a -- a natural\ndeath, it\u2019s not a death that, you know, like somebody gets old and dies. It\u2019s just horrible to deal\nwith. So --",
        "A: I think by going to these workshops, and by -- by reading a lot. I didn\u2019t talk about it for\nalmost 20 years, so that was, I think -- then I decided that I needed to go to therapy and resolve\nit, so that\u2019s what I did. And this woman was extremely helpful. We talked a lot about my mother.\nShe asked me, because I was telling her I was --\nEnd of Tape Six, Side A\nBeginning Tape Six, Side B",
        "A: Okay. I had an aunt who lived in New York, and I think my brother-in-law called her to call\nIsaac, because they didn\u2019t know our telephone number in California. And she called Isaac at the\noffice to tell him. They didn\u2019t call me direct to tell me. So Isaac came home early, and then he\nasked me to sit down next to him, and he said, \u201cI have to tell you, Mother died.\u201d And when he\nsaid Mother died, I thought he was talking about his mother. And I\u2019m thinking, why 1s he telling\nme his mother died, she died, you know, in the Holocaust. Why now he tells me this? I know,\nand I said, \u201cI know.\u201d You know, like I was trying to figure it out. He said, \u201cNo, not my mother,\nyour mother died.\u201d But he -- he said nothing about suicide. He told me that she died, and you\nknow, it was something I just couldn\u2019t grasp, I just couldn\u2019t get in my head. So it took me a\ncouple of days to absorb it. Then I got a letter -- then I called home. And I think it was -- you\nknow, your mind gets kind of blocked in situations like this. Because I called, and it was after the\nfuneral, so I spoke to my father, and my father said, \u201cWe lost Thaliki,\u201d -- Thalia was my\nmother\u2019s name. Thaliki is like a diminutive. And he said, \u201cWe lost Thaliki,\u201d and here I\u2019m\nthinking, you lost her, why don\u2019t you look for her? You know, why don\u2019t you go find her, call\nthe police or something. I didn\u2019t tell him that, but that was the thought that went through my\nmind. So it was -- it was very differ -- difficult to be that very far away. And then my sister sent\nme a letter, I asked her to -- to tell me what happened, and she sent me her -- a long, long letter,\nwith all the details, which I brought it to therapy, and wrote it -- I mean, read it there. And that\nwas quite earthshaking and w -- and I was trying to avoid reading that in therapy, and -- because\nthe letter is in Greek, so I told my therapist I cannot do it, it\u2019s in Greece, you want -- Greek, you\ndon\u2019t understand anything. Said, \u201cThat\u2019s all right, you will translate.\u201d Which of course I did. It\nwas a very hard session, she cried, too. Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, it was terrible. It was -- it was hard, because you know, I couldn\u2019t communicate other\nthan a letter that used to take 10 days to arrive. And phone was not so -- you know, nowadays\nyou can call, and it doesn\u2019t cost that much. Those days, I mean, phone calls to Greece were very\nexpensive, and I think we talked a couple of times on the phone, I spoke with my father, with\nYola. And everybody there were thinking how am I gonna cope with being alone here, and not\nhaving a support system. So that was -- then on top of that, two days later, Isaac came to\nWashington because he had an interview with Bellcom. And this was prearranged of course, and\nthat interview was important, so he left and he came here. And while he was gone, I got a call\nfrom a teacher of mine who happened to be in New York. She had no idea my mother died, but\nshe called me just to say hello, and to say how are you doing. And I\u2019m saying to her -- she\u2019s\ncalling from new -- from New York, and I\u2019m saying, you know, my mother died, and there are\ntears coming down [indecipherable] poor woman, I mean, she didn\u2019t know what to do over the\nphone. So -- but that\u2019s -- 1t was a point of connection with somebody I knew, that I could tell\nsome. Yeah.",
        "A: Right, right, yeah, yeah. Right.",
        "A: Well, actually, I don\u2019t know, because there are a -- a lot of people who -- who went through\nthe Holocaust and did not commit suicide. So, you cannot pin it just on that. I think there are\nmany factors that go into something like this. It\u2019s not only one thing. You cannot say that it was\njust because of that, but certainly it has played -- I mean, the war and the Holocaust have played\na major part in her lowt -- outlook to life. So, you know, it\u2019s not one thing, but it definitely did\nhave something to do with it, yeah. But here again, there are lots of people who have gone\nthrough difficulties, or maybe even harder things, and still are alive. So, part of it is her make-up,\nI think. You know, there isn\u2019t a single answer. There is no single answer, and that\u2019s the hardest\nthing in dealing with that, that you can\u2019t find an answer to say, well, Pll pinpoint that this was it.\nThere isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a combination of things.",
        "A: Yeah, sure. That it was her decision, although this is not a decision I would choose for myself,\nbecause I don\u2019t want to leave this kind of legacy to my children. But here again, I\u2019m a different\nperson, other factors go into my life, so who knows? I think time has also something to do with\nit. Education about the subject has a lot to do with it. And I really have researched the subject in\nany possible way. I once thought of running a group of people who survived the suicide of\nsomeone. And then I decided maybe I wasn\u2019t ready to do that, because 1 have to be a little more\ndetached from it, and I didn\u2019t feel I was that detached yet, when I wanted to do the group.",
        "A: Okay. Okay, well, as I said, I worked for the International Social Service in New York for a\nshort period of time, a few months, which was a job I liked, and fitted me like a glove, it was\nperfect, because it was dealing with Greek adoptions, and people I knew from Greece I had to\ncommunicate with. Anyway, well after Sarah was born, I did not work any more. I -- and after\nthe other children were born I stayed home. I was involved in Brownies, and maybe school\nactivities and things like that. Actually I did work in the evenings, when I think Nicole was in\nkindergarten, for Garfinkels -- part time -- this was my part time job. And it was primarily\nbecause I needed to do something, and I needed to do something very part time. But I -- I could\nstart exploring other things. But I always wanted to go back to social work, because this was a\nfield that always interests me. I mean, I\u2019m interested in people, and their lives, and what makes\nthem tick, and what\u2019s -- how they conduct their lives, what\u2019s in their lives, what influence their\nlives. So, I had a Bachelor\u2019s degree from Greece, from Pierce College, which was an American\nschool. And I knew I couldn\u2019t do very much, but when Nicole went to first grade, I -- I thought\nseriously of getting a job in social work. And somebody told me about the Jewish Social Service\nin Rockville, that they were looking for a social worker at the department of aging, I think. And I\ncalled, and verified that indeed they did need somebody, asked me to send my resume, which I\ndid, and they called me back, they wanted me to go for an interview, which was terrific. Well, I\ndid go to the interview, but I went a day earlier than the interview was scheduled, like I was not\nanxious, I guess. And then I realized when I\u2019m there, because the receptionist looks at\n[indecipherable] says, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t have you down for today. I think your interview\u2019s\ntomorrow.\u201d I\u2019m protesting, I said, \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s today at 10 o\u2019clock.\u201d And then I realized I\u2019m\nwrong, but then I\u2019m thinking if I tell them I\u2019m wrong, they\u2019ll never hire me. So anyway, the\nassistant director who was to interview me, Marty Moss was his name, he -- he said to me, \u201cI\nthought this interview was tomorrow, but anyway since you\u2019re here, I have 10 minutes because I\nhave to go into a meeting. Let\u2019s just discuss a few minutes of what is available, and what you can\ndo [indecipherable]. And maybe we\u2019ll have to have a second interview at one time.\u201d Well, he\u2019s\ntelling me that the opening 1s at the Department of Aging in the Jewish Social Service. Now, I\nknow nothing about aging. I\u2019ve never worked with older people, I don\u2019t know what to do with\nthem. I want to work with children. Anyway, I said okay. And then I get a call from the\nchairperson of the Department of Aging to go for a second interview. And I\u2019m thinking, do I\nreally want to work with older people? I\u2019m not sure. But anyway, it was an entrance. So I think\nthe question that really, she asked me, was -- I had done some volunteer work for the Jewish\nCommunity Center, we were doing some kind of a woman\u2019s day, and I had chosen the older\nwomen, and I had done, you know, some -- a presentation about it, and gathered material, and we\nhad the show, a -- a fashion show for older women, you know, because we felt they were\nneglected in the fashion, things like that. Which went very well, actually. And I was telling her\nabout that, and she said, \u201cYou\u2019d be perfect for the department\u2019. And I\u2019m thinking, you don\u2019t\nknow -- I don\u2019t either, I don\u2019t know anything. But anyway, they hired me. And I was excited,\nand I thought well, Pll learn. If I don\u2019t like it, I can always leave. So that was how I started, and\nonce I started working with older people, I just loved it. I found it so rewarding. You know, here\nI was, always wanted to work with children, and now I\u2019m finding the other end of life more\ninteresting, actually, and very rewarding. So it was great, it was a great team to work with. It was\na good a -- very good agency, very good camaraderie and professionalism. And I enjoy every\nminute of it, and I stayed there. I think I started in \u201974, and stayed until 1990. That\u2019s a long time.\nAnd while I was working there -- I always wanted to do therapy, and I had taken some courses,\nand then while I was at the Jewish Social Service, the -- my department chair said, \u201cPaulette,\nyou've got to get your Master\u2019s degree. You are doing things that Master\u2019s degree social workers\nare doing, but we can\u2019t pay you as a Master\u2019s degree social worker.\u201d So finally I thought about\nit, and thought about it, and I\u2019ve never been to an American university, I was 49 years old. So\nwhen I told a friend, I said, \u201cI\u2019m 49, how am I gonna go to school?\u201d She said, \u201cYou'll be 49\nwhether you go or not, just go.\u201d So finally I talked it over with Isaac, I said I would need a lot of\nhelp. This was a time that Maya had started driving, and she said, \u201cI'll help, I'll help, I'll do all\nyour [indecipherable] driving for you.\u201d So everybody pitched in and I did go to school. They\naccepted me as an advanced standing student because of my experience with social work. They\nwaived ce -- certain courses the first semester, and they waived field placement the first\nsemester, because I was still working for the Jewish Social Service part time. So my first year\nwas much lighter than the other students here. Second year was harder, I had to -- to quit\nworking for the Jewish Social Service, because I couldn\u2019t handle everything, because I did have\na field placement, and I had an excellent supervisor. It was in a psychiatric clinic, a community\npsychiatric clinic in Witten. And I got excellent experience, I had a wonderful supervisor,\nMeedul Shore. And of course I had the classes, you know, I had to go to school, and plus the\nfamily. Sarah was already in college, Maya and Nicole were home. So it was hard writing\npapers, I\u2019ve never written a paper in this country. I mean, I\u2019ve written papers in Greece, but they\nwere different. It was a little hard, because as I said, this was a new experience for me. I didn\u2019t\neven know how to use the library. I had to ask how to use the library. It was a lot of work, an\nawful lot of work, but I loved every minute of it, because I felt I was doing it because I wanted to\ndo it. And I graduated with a Master\u2019s in 1991. And I went back to the Jewish Social Service,\nand -- but at the time they had a part time job only available, and they said, \u201cCome, it\u2019s part time,\nif something opens as full time, we\u2019ll get you as full time.\u201d",
        "A: Social work",
        "A: Uh-huh, right, yeah. 1991. And while I was working for the Jewish Social Service, my\nsupervisor at the community psychiatric clinic, called me one day, and he said, \u201cYou know, there\nis a psychiatrist who is looking for a social worker to work for him to do intakes. Are you\ninterested?\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019m interested, but I\u2019m not leaving Jewish Social Service.\u201d So he says,\n\u201cT\u2019ll have him call you.\u201d So he calls me, and he says he\u2019s looking for a social worker to do his\nintakes. Intakes are, you know, you -- you g -- see the person for the first time, you collect all the\ninformation, and then you give it to him, and then he determines the treatment and this kind of\nthing. But it\u2019s an elaborate process, I mean, the interviews have to be quite long, and to\nunderstand the problem, and this kind of thing. So when he called me, I was leaving for Arizona\nthe next day. It was one of Isaac\u2019s retreats. So I said to him, \u201cI\u2019m leaving for a week.\u201d He said,\n\u2018Send me your resume, and then we\u2019ll talk when you come back.\u201d I came back, he said, \u201cCome\nand see me.\u201d So I went to see him, we -- he decided to hire me. So I was working for him part\ntime, and I stayed with him 11 years. I was working both at the Jewish Social Service, and with\nhim. His name is Aaron Burger, he is in Silver Spring, very nice man. So that was a very good\nexperience, too, because he is a good supervisor also, and a very good -- good friend, also, he\nbecame.",
        "A: Well, since I was working half time at the Jewish Social Service, actually I would go -- I\nwould work one evening for him, and I would see four or five people, once a week. Then I\nwould, on my days off from the Jewish Social Service, I would go to his office, and see people.\nBut he also gave me some people from -- for treatment, some cases that didn\u2019t require his skills,\nyou know. And then, when I quit Jewish Social Service in 1990, because Isaac was retiring, and I\n-- we were thinking a lot about traveling to Europe and all that kind of stuff, I left Jewish Social\nService, and continued working with him for -- until after Ian was born, and then I told him I\nwanted to spend time with my grandson. And that was it. Which he fully understood, and --\nbecause he has grandchildren of his own. And I\u2019m friends with his wife, and his daughter, we\nbecame quite good friends. So --",
        "A: I love my career. And now I\u2019m working -- for awhile I didn\u2019t work, after I left Dr. Burger, but\nthen I worked for -- also part time as a contract worker for a company called Aging Network\nServices, which is located in Bethesda. They\u2019ve been in business for 20 years. It\u2019s run by two\nsocial workers, and they needed a Master\u2019s degree social worker to supervise social workers who\ndo care managers, and do care management. Coordinating services, and seeing families, and this\nkind of thing. And I\u2019m still with them, very part time, but I love doing it. I mean, I -- I do enjoy\nmy career, my career is just the best career for me, anyway. It\u2019s great. Once I was thinking that I\nmay want to change careers at times, because sometimes people\u2019s problems become too big, and\nyou wonder how good you are at it or not, in helping. But I think this was a phase I had gone\nthrough, so I decided to take a catering course, cause I love to cook, and I thought well, maybe\nIll do that professionally. But I did take the course, I got the certificate, I enjoyed the course, but\nI haven\u2019t opened a catering thing. Isaac wasn\u2019t too happy for me to do that.",
        "A: Right. I think, you know, your past experiences, I mean your history, your past history\ninforms your present, right? And I think I am who I am because of my past experiences, and my\nmake-up, of course, but yes, ve learned through my experiences. And I think my work relates\nvery well to my experiences of other people. Because somebody was asking me what are the\nmajor things that you understand about a client. And I said, \u201cI understand culture, and different\nculture. I understand suffering. I understand hardships. I understand moving away from a\ncountry, and from family, and going to another country and starting to make a life there. I\nunderstand loneliness, lonesomeness. I understand raising children, I understand having a\nhusband and working with him, and you know, with his difficulties, and all that kind of stuff.\u201d\nSo I understand these things. Somehow I -- they come instinctively now.\nhappen. I base that on you having mentioned getting performing artists t-to perform regularly for\nthe elderly.",
        "A: Seniors. Yeah, this is volunteer work. I mean, my work for the Aging Network Services is --\nis paid work. I\u2019m a member of WPAS, or Washington Performing Arts Society, the women\u2019s\ncommittee, and the women\u2019s committee has several subcommittees. And one of the committees I\nco-chair with another woman, is called Enriching Experiences for Seniors, that started about 10\nor 12 years ago. And what we do 1s we bring local artists to senior centers, nursing homes,\nassisted livings, recreation centers for senior adults. What we do is just we coordinate these\nthings. You have to coordinate the center, find the activities director, the date, coordinate the\nartist, and the days they are available to do this kind of things. And also provide the volunteers\nfrom the women\u2019s committee who go to audit the performance, because this way they give us\nfeedback on the artists and the interaction between the -- all the people and the artists, so we\u2019 ll\nknow whether to hire them for next year or not. This 1s a free program to the community -- I\nmean, the seniors don\u2019t pay anything for this. WPAS has a budget for the senior program. And\nthat\u2019s what I do in addition to working for the gala, which is a [indecipherable] event,\nfundraising event, or the auction, or the embassy adoption program, which 1s another women\u2019s\ncommittee program, where embassies adopt school, and the -- for the semester, or for the year,\nand the children study about that particular country. And I usually choose Greece. So the\nchildren -- the school that chooses Greece, and the embassy, I\u2019m the liaison between the two of\nthem. So we go -- the representative for the Greek embassy, or the other embassies go to the\nschool, talk to the children about it. The children study about Greece, and work with the teachers,\nwe work with the teachers, and then at the end of the semester, they put up a presentation, the\nembassy invites them for -- for cookies and juice, or whatever. And they give a presentation to\nthe ambassador, or the staff members of the embassy. And then we take the children to a Greek\nrestaurant, so they can taste a little food. These are sixth graders, they are 12 years old, and they\nare wonderful. This -- I mean, 50 embassies participate in this -- in this program, and it\u2019s a\nfantastic program for teachers and children. The teachers love this program because the children\nlearn so much through that program about the other countries. And it\u2019s very educational, it\u2019s a\nfun program, it\u2019s just great. So I love doing Greece, as you understand. Last year there were --\nthe Greek embassy was between ambassadors, so they didn\u2019t have time to participate in the\nprogram, so they were not there. So I did the embassy of the Bahamas, which was also a nice\nexperience, you know, and I went to a school pretty far away in someplace -- I think it was\nnortheast Washington. And the wife of the ambassador came to the school, they had -- they\ninvited the children to their embassy of the Bahamas. They had the presentation, they provided\nlunch at the embassy, from the whole class. It was a good experience. I mean, to -- to --\nsomehow I feel that, you know, just doing Greece every year kind of limits me to other countries,\nbecause people tell me wonderful things about the embassy of Israel, you know, and Thailand or\nother countries. But I love Greece, so Pll do anything to promote Greece, and to -- and teach\nchildren about it. There is so much. And next year it\u2019s going to be an important year because of\nthe Olympics, so --\nBeginning Tape Seven, Side A",
        "A: Seven. You were asking?",
        "A: Oh sure. They\u2019re different things, but yes, the sense of community was very strong in my\nfamily, and giving to the community. My mother volunteered, there was a Jewish organization in\nVolos, a women\u2019s organization, she volunteered that -- there. She volunteered at the orphanage\nin Volos. There was an orphan -- not a Jewish orphanage, an orphanage in Volos, and sometimes\nshe would take me with her. And I loved going with her, and talking with the children there, but I\nwas also petrified that if my mother and father were to die, I would end up in that orphanage. I\nwas so scared of that, of them dying and me being in the orphanage. And I remember when I had\nthis visit in Volos, when it was like the 50 year reunion I was telling you, Yola and I had taken a\ntaxi to go to the Jewish cemetery, because our grandparents are buried there. So as we are\npassing, the driver -- the taxi driver says, \u201cAnd here 1s, on the left 1s the orphanage.\u201d And I said\nto him, \u201cStop!\u201d And he scratches on his brakes, and he stops the taxi. And he said, \u201cWhat\nhappened?\u201d I said, \u201cStop, I want to see this orphanage.\u201d It seemed so small to me. I said, \u201cIs this\nthe same orphanage that was here?\u201d \u201cOh yeah,\u201d he said, \u201cnothing has changed. They just painted\nit, but it\u2019s the same thing.\u201d It looked so tiny. I mean, I remember it like a big place, with a big\nyard. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s so funny when you see things as an adult, and how you see things as a child,\nyeah.",
        "A: Yeah",
        "A: Okay. As I told you, my parents were first cousins, so my father was the second child, and\nfirst son. There were five children in his family. His mother was the eldest of seven children. My\ngrandparents had seven children, two girls. First one, my paternal grandmother, last one my\nmaternal grandmother, and there were boys in between. So there were five children in my\nfather\u2019s family. Abusta was the eldest, my father was the second, there were two girls, and\nSaould, or Sauld was the youngest, who was born in 19 -- I think he was born 1909, or 1910. So\nhe was like an afterthought. He was much younger compared to the other siblings in the family.\nWell, none of them are alive. They all went to hiding in different places. My fourth aunt, the\nfourth child in the family was the only one who survived until 1976, I think. She came to the\nUnited States. She was adopted by an uncle, the brother of -- of her mother, who was married,\nand they couldn\u2019t have any children. So Connie used to go to their house, and they had her there,\nand they played with her, and they loved her, they absolutely were in love with her. And they\ndecided to come -- to go to Teriester first. So they asked if they could take her along. And they\ndid, and then they decided they wanted to come to the United States. I mean, the uncle, and his\nwife. So they went back to Greece, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an official adoption, whether there\nwere papers of adoption taken. But somehow it seems like the family, or the parents, anyway,\ndecided to -- to let her go with the uncle, because they felt she will have a wonderful life in the\nUnited States, and not in Volos. So she came to the United States, and she didn\u2019t know she was\nadopted until much, much later in life. She was an adult, I think, when she found out about that.\nShe got married, and had a son, whom I see, Bob Guburbon. My aunt died in, I think, \u201970 -- let\nme see, no, she must have died in \u201976 or \u201977, yeah, in Florida. And her husband died a few years\nlater. I see her grand -- h-her son, often. This aunt, Connie, send us care packages after the war\nwas over, with food, with clothes. She would send fancy party clothes for me, and they looked so\nfunny, because you know, I mean, here I didn\u2019t have any clothes, and I had a -- an organza dress,\nold dress. And she would send some cans, I mean, chocolates. And she once sent shoes for my\nfather. I remember they were so huge. I mean, my father was a tall and big man, and these shoes\nwere tremendous for him. I mean, he couldn\u2019t wear them. And she sended a teddy bear for me.\nSo I always remember her, you know, for doing these things. Of course, I met her when I came\nto the United States. But I mean, she had never met her siblings. She was in touch with them. I\ndon\u2019t know if she was in touch with them before the war, but after the war, I mean, she came\nthrough with sending care packages. And then, of course, they were corresponding with -- \u2018scuse\nme -- with my father, and he was the one who would tell the news, you know, t-to -- to his\nsisters. And my Aunt Julia corresponded with her, because Julia had come to the United States to\nvisit her son who was studying, and has seen Connie. Now, my father\u2019s younger brother, Saul\nwas hiding in somebody\u2019s house, I think the name was aseema -- Aseemomeetees. And there\nwere two daughters and a son, maybe two sons. And he fell in love with the oldest daughter, and\nshe with him. Saul was a handsome, beautiful man. And after the war was over, they kept on\nseeing each other, and dating each other, and they wanted to get married, but of course she was\nChristian Orthodox, and the rabbi wouldn\u2019t marry them, she had to convert. So she took all the\nlessons that she needed to do to convert. But then there was a little detail which I don\u2019t\nremember now, and they decided they were gonna go to France, and get married in Paris. So\nthey did go to Paris and got married, and came back to live in Athens. And she knew more about\nJewish holidays than any of us did. My mother didn\u2019t know them, and she would call -- Deena,\nwas her name. Deena would call my mother and say, \u201cDo you know that today is,\u201d such and such\na holiday. My mother would say, \u201cOh, really?\u201d I mean, we observed the big holidays, but not the\nlittle ones. And Deena knew everything. And -- but unfortunately, a few months later, in 1950 --\nI think they married \u00b049, or beginning of \u201950 -- or \u201951 I think it was, he got cancer, a brain tumor.\nAnd they went to Paris and he had surgery and died. It was terrible. It was devastating. He was\n40 or 41, very young. A life, you know, just got done so young. And of course Deena was\ntotally, totally devastated. Now, many years later she remarried, but she divorced, this marriage\ndidn\u2019t go that well. Then many years later she married somebody who was living in the United\nStates, in Florida, so -- a -- a -- a Greek, but I think he -- he was Greek American, or someth like\nthat, and he went -- they -- they lived in Florida. She couldn\u2019t stand it, she didn\u2019t like Florida, she\ndidn\u2019t like America. So she divorced him too, and she went back to Greece, and now she -- she\nlives alone. When I go to Greece she comes and sees me. She -- she is very warm, very lovely. I\nwent to -- to volunteer nursing school at the Red Cross in Greece with her sister, her younger\nsister. So we were both volunteer nurses at the Red Cross hospital, and we took the classes\ntogether. So I haven\u2019t seen her sister for a long time, but Deena, she was a lovely, lovely woman,\nyeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s sad. It\u2019s sad that they were -- sad for her. I mean, here it was the love of her life, and he\ndied almost -- less than a year after they were married. And for the family, you know -- I mean,\nfor my father it was devastating. Actually, Saul was a very rambunctious young man, and when\nhe was -- I think at the age of 13, he came to live with my mother and father, because he had\ndiabetes, and somehow wouldn\u2019t adhere to any program, and my grandmother had very hard\ntime controlling him, or managing him. So her blood pressure would go very high, and they were\nvery worried about my grandmother. So my father said, \u201cLet him stay with us.\u201d And somehow\nmy mother was much more able to -- to work with him, and he loved my mother, he absolutely\nadored her. And he stayed with them, he lived with them.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "A: Eight years. Eight more years, but he was a broken man by then. I mean, he wa -- her death\nwas devastating to him. His health started -- well, his health was not so good before that, but it\nstarted deteriorating. He had the heart problems, he had diabetes, which was from a long time\nbefore that. He had arteriosclerosis, which started manifesting, you know, and some -- some\nbrain damage, you know. Forgetfulness, and stuff like that. So -- and he wa -- he was bitter. He\nwas bitter. Not too many friends came to see him. So he was again like he was a forgotten man,\nhe was somebody special and very much sought after in his younger years, because of his\nposition and his powerful connections and everything else. And then now that he needed to have\na lot of people around him, you know, they will come once in awhile to visit, and that was about\nit. So he -- he was lonely, very lonely.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. This is something that I really regret, because I was so very far away, and you\nknow, I couldn\u2019t do much. She took very good care of him, and she was like the care manager,\nyou know, did everything for him. Took -- would visit him every day, will talk to the doctors,\nmake arrangements with doctors, and things like that, yeah. Yeah, she was -- she took excellent\ncare of my parents. And I think she resents it a little bit that I was so far away and could not help,\nthat she had to go through that by herself. And maybe my job of taking care of older people, has\nsomething to do at some point with my need to take care of my parents. You know, lots of\nunconscious things go around. Can\u2019t decipher every single thing, but I\u2019m sure my choice of work\nis not incidental, you know, it\u2019s medi -- meaningful, and it relates to my need to do something I\ndidn\u2019t do. You know, I mean, they needed care, and she was there for them, I wasn\u2019t.",
        "A: Well, I think it\u2019s in balance with my life at this point. I think it\u2019s -- it\u2019s one experience that I\nwouldn\u2019t have had if the war had not happened. I think my life would have turned out to be\ntotally different. Carefree, you know, affluent. Totally different life. But I certainly don\u2019t regret\nmy life. I think it was a good life in many ways, because it brought me to the point I am now,\nclose to 70 years of age, where I think I have become a very strong person, a very compassionate\nperson, a person who cares about people. A person who -- who enjoys life. I mean, I remember a\nfriend of mine once, who has a house at the beach, had invited me, and then we decided at the\nspur of the moment to go to a -- to an orchard, or to -- to a farm nearby, and pick up peaches.\nAnd I remember giggling, and just laughing, and enjoying picking peaches. And she looked at\nme, and she said, \u201cPaulette, I never knew you would get such a thrill out of something so simple,\nyou know, such a very simple kind of thing.\u201d Incidentally, when we were, during the Italian\noccupation, I used to go and pick up fruit, you know, climb the trees and pick up peaches, or\ncherries. And of course I would eat the cherries, and I got sick, because I would love them, and\nyou know, then my stomach will hurt. So maybe that reminded me a little bit of that, but it was\nsuch a pleasure to do things, to do anything. I mean, I love being outdoors, looking at the blue\nsky, and -- or watching children, see them grow. That\u2019s the biggest joy for me.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s [indecipherable] thank you for [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- appreciate --",
