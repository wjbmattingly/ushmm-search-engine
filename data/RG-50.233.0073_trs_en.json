        "Max Karl Liebmann\nRG-50.233*0073\nInterview on March 28, 1992\nOne Audio cassette & one digitized\nAbstract\nMax Liebmann was born on September 3, 1921 in Mannheim, Germany into a relatively comfortable household that\nwas not particularly religious. He began playing the cello when he was eight years old and had hopes of going to a\nconservatory in Zurich or Jerusalem; but this became impossible. Max attended public school until 1937; at that time\nhe saw no sense in continuing at school due to the harassment he experienced as a Jew. From the beginning of 1938\nuntil Kristallnacht, he attended a private school. His mother had been trained as a concert pianist, and his father was in\nthe textile business. In 1938, his father was forced to give up his business; he went to Greece to try to build a business\nthere. Max and his mother moved in with his grandmother. From Greece his father illegally entered France and\nremained in Nice until the end of the war. Max\u2019s mother and father last met in Italy (on the father\u2019s way to France) in\nAugust 1939; his mother returned to Germany, certain that there would be no war.\nAt the outbreak of the war Max was called to perform harvesting work in East Germany. He was able to return to\nMannheim in late autumn 1939; he became a volunteer for emigration offices in Berlin. He worked there until his\ndeportation on October 22, 1940 to the non-occupied zone of France \u2014 Gurs. On the train to France Max was chosen\nas the translator for the Jewish transport leader. On arrival at the camp, he was separated from his mother. He\nremained at Gurs for 20 months during which time he worked in the office of the camp block. Because he played music\n\u2014 the cello \u2014 he was given a pass that allowed him to move about the camp more easily. Thus, he was able to see his\nmother and his new girlfriend daily.\nWhen Max\u2019s block was closed, he moved into the hospital of the camp where he ran the office. He was removed from\nthe camp at the end of June 1942 by the Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants to a farm outside of Lyon run by the Boy\nScouts of France. He was able to say \u2018goodbye\u2019 to his mother. When it was learned that a raid on the farm was\nplanned, they were dispersed and told to fend for themselves. With the help of Mireille Philip, he was given sanctuary\non another farm for about three and a half weeks. He was then given false papers and began a trek with others,\nclimbing up over the mountains into Switzerland. After about half an hour on their descent into Switzerland, they were\narrested by the Swiss patrol and told that they would be escorted back to France. After the Swiss patrol left the group,\nMax and another man turned around and made their way back to Switzerland. This time they were told that they\nwould not be returned to France, but would be interned in Switzerland. He remained in Switzerland for five and a half\nyears until he was able to immigrate to the United States.\nTranscript\nCartridge Tape, Side A",

        "| was born on September 3, 1921 in Mannheim in Germany. Mannheim is in the southwest of\nGermany. My parents, who also were born in Germany, were Alfred Liebmann and Jeanne, n\u00e9e Levi.\nMy father was in business in Mannheim as a representative of textile firms. To be more specific, he\nrepresented a maker of cotton gray goods and a converter. Those were the two companies who ...\nwhom he represented since the twenties, and with whom he was until he could no longer continue\nworking in Germany. My mother was basically the ... the housewife. However, from the beginning or\nfrom the middle or end of the Depression until closing of the business, she did the books of ... of my\nfather\u2019s company in Mannheim; and that is as far as what my mother did. My mother was trained\noriginally as a concert pianist; however, she never used it professionally. Nevertheless, she played a lot\nof piano. And when | was able on the cello to play more advanced music \u2014 such as sonatas, etc. \u2014 she\nalways accompanied me. And we also played, until our deportation, quite a bit of piano ... chamber\nmusic.\nYou played at home, had a piano, and you were the cellist?\n[NOTE: Interviewer and Max are talking over each other. |\nWe played at home; we had a...; | was a cellist. In fact \u2014 | don\u2019t think | put this in the videotape \u2014 |\nhad ... we had in 1939 a Gentile violinist, who was anti-Nazi, who came to our house unt ... almost until\nthe last minute when we were deported; and we played piano trios at home. My father was \u2014 aside\nfrom his business \u2014 very active in the Jewish Choral Society of Mannheim, called \u201cLiederkranz\u201d. He\nwas on the board of directors; he was the secretary. And he was essentially responsible for getting,\namong other things, all the tickets properly organized and sold. And after 1934, | believe, when Jews\nwere excluded from the cultural life in Germany, this choral society became what was known as\n\u201cJuedischer (JUdischer) Kulturbund,\u201d the cultural organization of the Jewish community in Mannheim.\nIn addition to a mixed choir, an orchestra was founded \u2014 a chamber orchestra. And until about 1937\nthere were concerts of choral works; there were concerts of the orchestra; there was opera\nperformed. We did an Offenbach operetta; we did Orpheus and Eur... Eur... Eurydice by Gluck; we did\nBastien and Bastienne by Mozart; together with a... a short opera \u2014 whose name escapes me right\nnow \u2014 by Pergolesi. So there was a large cultural life in Mannheim, which unfortunately had to end\nwhen the situation became such that it no longer could be done.",
        "061; 04:45 Your father \u2014 he was a... a photographer?\nNo. My father was ... my father, as | said, was representative of ... of textiles. And in 19 ... the beginning\nof 1938 when he had to give up his business and return the ... and turn over his accounts to Gentiles,\none of his companies asked him if he wouldn\u2019t want to try to build up an existence in Greece. So in\nMarch of 1938 my father went to Greece; which was quite an enterprise considering that legally he\ncould not take out more than ten marks from Germany. And how can you live on ten marks? So he\nmanaged to smuggle out some five hundred or a thousand marks which he taped into a toilet bowl in\nthe railroad car, until he was across the border in Switzerland when he retrieved the money. My father\nstarted to build an existence in Greece. However, due to interference from the German competition,\nhe was expelled; he went to Italy. And from Italy, from Ventimiglia, he went illegally to France. After\nthe usual stop in a prison for illegally entering France, he settled in Nice. At the beginning of the war\nhe was interned like everybody who was of German background. He was eventually released and came\nback to Nice and lived in Nice until the ... ten days before the landing of the American troops on French\nsoil when he was arrested when he was accidentally running into a German patrol. My mother saw my\nfather the last time in August of 1939 when they met in Italy when he was on his way to France. And",

In Mannheim there were two synagogues [NOTE: Haupt (Main) Synagogue and Klaus\nSynagogue]. One was called [? unintelligible] synagogue, which was from what we look at \u2014 as we\nlook at it today \u2014 was a conservative service.

And the Gestapo was on the\nphone because the head of the emigration office in Mannheim also was a contact between the Jewish\ncommunity and the Gestapo. He went to the office of the Gestapo almost weekly, and he was told to\ncome down immediately. And when he came down \u2014 and that was really a courtesy of the Mannheim\nGestapo \u2014 he was told that we would be arrested and deported the next morning.

        "place ina little wood ... a tennis field in a little wood. And chance would have it that in the morning at\n5:30, a group of young teenage girls would walk by. And amongst them was my wife, my girlfriend,\nwho refused to turn around when | whistled after her \u2014 and had to be physically turned around by\none of her girlfriends.\n[NOTE: question directed to wife.] Uh huh; \u2018cause you didn\u2019t recognize him, or you didn\u2019t ... you\u2019re\nnot accustomed to being whistled at?\nShe didn\u2019t want to be whistled at, and she didn\u2019t realize it was I.\nAha!\nSo when | explained the circumstances why | was here, she took me to Mireille Philip \u2014who was the\nwife of what was later to become the finance minister of de Gaulle in his first government; who was\nalready then with de Gaulle in England. And she made sure that after one night in the village, in a villa\nwith people who were very willing to give me a room for the night and fed me, | was placed on a farm\nabout an hour and a half to two hour away by foot \u2014 where | stayed about three and a half weeks.\nAnd these farmers shared their food with me. They put me into their hayloft. And after three and a\nhalf weeks, | was already certain that | was forgotten because no... |... | had heard nothing and seen\nnothing; until there was all of a sudden a little message from my wife who, in those days, also was\nhiding on a farm because the raids had ... where had started in France to arrest Jews. And | got a little\nnote from her that she was well; she was ... she was on a farm \u2014 | shouldn\u2019t worry. Shortly thereafter,\n| was picked up, brought back to Le Chambon ... where | found my girlfriend.\n217; 1:05:05 You were picked up by friends?\nBy ... by... by people from ... from the village. Madame Philip made sure that | was photographed; | was\ngiven false papers. And days later, with false papers and three other fellows, we were directed to a\nvillage one stop from Saint-Gervais in the French Alps. It went there by train. We fared well, nobody\nchallenged us; nobody stopped us. And | was also standing very often next to a gendarme, \u2018cause |... |\nfelt that was a good way of not getting checked on papers. You don\u2019t stand next to a gendarme when\nyou have a bad conscience.\nRight.\nAnd from this place near Saint-Gervais, we were taken the next morning on a 36 or 30, 40 hour hike \u2014\nhigh into the mountains. The leader of the four of us was a young 10, 11 year old boy who knew these\nmountains by heart. He had along a young French pastor, a Protestant minister who was supposed to\nlearn the way to guide others. So that ... that way we were overnight. We started early in the morning;\nwe walked all day; we climbed, we climbed, we climbed. When nightfall came, we found a rock\noverhang under which we stayed because it was raining that night. The next morning we went on, still\nclimbing, until the boy stopped and told us now we have to go down, and eventually we\u2019ll reach\nSwitzerland. Which we did, only to be arrested on about half an hour after we were walking\nsomewhere high, still high, in the mountains on a road with tunnels. And the ... the Swiss patrol\narrested us, stopped us, brought us to a mountain hut which ... which had a restoration service. There\nwas a restaurant there; we could sleep there overnight. And we found that we were maybe number\n36, 37, 38, 39 of a group of people who all had coming in this region \u2014 were found and stopped and\nheld by the Swiss authorities. We were given food, even though Switzerland has rationing, without\nThe folowing trangEa HRS FREOR St PF SUraRAP AeA ae ae He BPN AOS USE MSR MSTA eT RBS\nnot been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy.

        "next morning we were told by the commanding officer of this contingent of Swiss soldiers that now we\nwould be sent back to Switzerland [NOTE: interjection of his wife: \u201cto France\u201d] ... to France. We would\nnot ... we could not stay in Switzerland. And on the way back to what they called no man\u2019s land, all of a\nsudden | was picked on by a Swiss sergeant who started to scream and yell at me; and was trying to\ntell me what I\u2019m not supposed to do. That went on for about 15 or 20 minutes. Why he picked me | still\ndon\u2019t know. | don\u2019t even know who the man is, but it dawned on me when he was finished screaming\nand yelling, telling me what I\u2019m not supposed to do \u2014 that he had given me an exact chart of what |\nshould do. All | had to do is ignore the \u201cno\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d, and do; and then substitute \u201cdo\u201d, and he had\ngiven mea...\n270; 1:09:09 So, ignore all the negatives, the \u201cnot\u2019s\u201d ...\nYa, while | had to figure that out for myself of course and without the \u201cnot\u2019s\u201d he had told me exactly\nwhat to do to get back into Switzerland. The tragedy was that after the Swiss stopped us, told us to\nkeep on going dow ... down, and left us, the tragedy was when | stopped, the 30 or 40 people who\nwere with me, nobody had understood what was ... had transpired there. And | finally, after an hour \u2014\nwith the exception of one man who followed my reasoning; nothing to lose but to gain \u2014 the other 38\nwent back to ... to France, while he and | turned around and tried our way back into Switzerland. | had\nmanaged to look at a map the night before, and | knew approximately where | was. So we started\ncrossing a very tiny water, which was ice water which came from a glacier which went down into\nFrance. We crossed this. With one step we were across, and | had ... | discovered further up ... woods\nand what looked like a walk. So we climbed there, and indeed when we came up to the woods, we had\nfound a path.\nWhich he mentioned in his ... was he ... did ...\nNo, he didn\u2019t mention ...\nHe didn\u2019t mention it?\nNo, no. And we followed that path and eventually we ended up in a village which was called Finhaut in\nSwitzerland. We had been explained in France, in Chambon, that if we need help we should look first\nfor a French minister\u2019s. If there are no French pastors, go to the Catholic Church ... Protestant\nministers. If we couldn\u2019t find Protestant ministers, go to the Catholic Church. Though in a village like\nthis in Switzerland, high up in the Valais, there are no Protestants; there are only Catholics. So | went\nto the church, and | asked for Monsieur le Cur\u00e9; but unfortunately, the village priest wasn\u2019t there for\nthe day. He had gone down to... into the ... toa... to the ... to the administrative point of the Catholic\nChurch. So we went on, and it became dark. We had been on the road all day, and | decided I\u2019m not\ngoing to sleep another night ... if | can help it. So we went past a few houses \u2014 small village \u2014\nstretched out and high up in the mountains; must ... must have been over ... still over 2,000 meters.\nAnd | knocked on the door of a house which | liked. And after some to do, because the man explained\nto me he\u2019s a new ... a newly-wed; he has [? unintelligible] ... it\u2019s his brother-in-law\u2019s house. We were\ninvited in; we were given food; we were given a... a room; and we were given directions how to get on\ninto the ... down into the valley.\nAnd we walked another day, and by mid-afternoon we were in a village next to Martigny where | went\nto the Catholic priest because | had no more money. Actually it was around noon, and we were down. |\nwent to the Catholic Church; the priest gave us some food to eat. He gave me five francs, which\nThe following trang orittes me FOP a Yen diet te Lausanne ade fellow Twas with had e Hough money er phim, swiss has\nnot been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy.

        "money \u2014 was older than | was. And so we ended up in the station in Lausanne, and we were about 20\nminutes in Lausanne in the station, not knowing what to do.\n325; 1:13:14 You know, eventually you ... you sometimes you hit a snag; it was my ... my ball game. The other guy\njust followed me; whatever | said, he did. And so it dawned on me \u2014 you\u2019re a Jew; let\u2019s look for the\nJewish congregation. | looked in the telephone book, eventually. Nobody had bothered us in the\nstation, even though we were ... must have been ... quite conspicuous. And then | looked in the ... the\ntelephone book, and there it was \u2014 Cong ... Congregation Israeli; and it was Rue de la Gare, which is\nRailroad Street. So it was within two or three minutes; and we went there. And the first thing these\npeople told us, \u2018You\u2019re not going to be returned. We have to turn you over to the Swiss authorities, but\nyou will be interned; but you won't be returned to France.\u2019\nAnd that is what happened. We were, for about three months, in two quarantine camps. And from\nthere we were turned over into civilian control. And | was assigned to a labor camp in Sierre, which is\nin the French part of Switzerland, in the Rhone valley. | got there on December 23 to a totally empty\ncamp. What it was \u2014 they had leave of absence for the holidays, for Christmas. And the camp director\nasked me if | had relatives where | could go ... or friends where | could go; and | said, \u2018Yes, | have\nrelatives about, approximately where | came from.\u2019 So | turned around. He gave me a ticket; he gave\nme a pass; and | went to my cousin whom | hadn\u2019t seen in ... | don\u2019t know how many years. And | spent\nChristmas with my cousin. And so after Christmas | came back to camp, and | started life in a Swiss\nlabor camp. We shoveled snow because it had snowed over Christmas; and that wasn\u2019t for me. | didn\u2019t\nlike that. So within a week | managed to get into the office.\nAnd | was interned in Switzerland, in various camps and internment homes. What that meant... it ...\nwhat people didn\u2019t ... what people here don\u2019t realize is that in Switzerland people who illegally came to\nSwitzerland were interned. And while it was, of course, considerably better than what was happening\nto us in France, we were interned. The Swiss were not nice about it; we were harassed. Every so often\nwe were asked when are we going to leave. And they knew ... the Swiss knew perfectly well we\ncouldn\u2019t leave. There was nowhere to go during the war. So | was in Switzerland, in various offices of\ncamps and homes, for five and a half years until we were able to emigrate. | married my wife in\nSwitzerland and in ... she was able to join me in voluntary internment. Our daughter was born while we\nwere interned. And eventually, in March of 1948, we were able to come to the United States.\nAs you went across France towards Switzerland, did you know whether your father was still in\nFrance?\nYes. | knew my father was in Nice. | corresponded with him until his deportation. | corresponded with\nmy mother until she was deported. She knew ... my ... my mother knew when she was deported that |\nwas Safe.\nShe knew you were safe.\nAnd my father knew that we were engaged.

We got married in April of 1945 after we both managed to get birth certificates from Germany.\nThat also was a whole story because while my wife had relatives in Switzerland from whom she walked\naway because they made her life so miserable, they were not aware that we really wanted to get\nmarried right away. And after we finally had our birth certificates, since my wife was being treated by\nthe Swiss under German law, and she was not yet 21, she needed a parent ... a parental permission to\nget married.
