        "Q: Ok, we're ready to begin now. Could you please state your name?",
        "A: My name is David J. Selznick.",
        "Q: Where were you born?",
        "A: I was born in a small village in Lithuania, Aniksht.",
        "Q: And, and where exactly is that located in Lithuania?",
        "A: It, it's located closer to the Latvian border.",
        "Q: And when were you born?",
        "A: I was born two weeks before the big fire, and that's all they knew. There was no papers. I\nwas born in 1912, and in those days they had no documents in my village at all, so my father\nremembered that I was born two weeks before the big fire. When I became a teenager and\nabout the time to serve in the Lithuanian army, a commission of doctors have moved their\nhand several times over my face, and with that, they established that I was born in 1912,\nbecause my, my face didn't have a beard yet. And they took a date of January first, 1912.\nAnd from there on, I was born on January first, 1912.",
        "Q: Could you tell me a little about your childhood?",
        "A: My childhood: I was the youngest son of a family of five sisters. My father was a, a, a\npeddler going to the vil -- to the farms and exchanging goods. And when I was hardly three\nyears old, my father and mother wrapped me in a tallis and carried me a long distance to the\nrabbi's house. And there, he sat me down and taught me the Kometz aleph-beys.\u2019 And as a\nreward, coins came down from heaven. And the first coin fell down, and -- I was excited and\nbelieved. But on the second coin, I lift up my head, I lift up eyes and I notice the rabbi stand\nover my, over my head, and I realized that it's not from heaven, but it's coming from the\nrabbi's hand. And that affected for the rest of my life my thinking about every aspect of life.",

        "A: In what way? That whatever you are being told is not necessarily correct.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little about your education?",
        "A: In those days, the first rabbi -- which I just told you -- started with me to learn the kheder,\u201d\nthe elementary Talmudistic study. After that, in those days -- it's about a hundred years ago,\nin the Jewish families, a boy was not supposed to have elementary education, and my father\nwanted me to be a rabbi. So gradually, when I was finished with the kheder, I was sent to a\nyeshiva. Since my village was too small to have a yeshiva, so I was sent to Vilkomir, a large\ncity where I went to the yeshiva in Vilkomir. Since the custom was in those days that the\nyeshiva didn't had any cooking facilities, and -- every boy was by himself. And the custom\nwas that the local residents were giving a day to eat. Each family gave one day to a Yeshiva\nbokher. And since my mother had relatives in Vilkomir who were some of the most\nestablished and wealthiest people, so I had pretty comfortable every day in the families\nwhere I was eating every day, except for Thursday. Thursday was my day with -- where my\nmother's aunt and cousin, two elderly widows, mother and daughter, who owned half of the\nproperty in Vilkomir. But they never gave me anything to eat. And I was arriving about nine\no'clock in the morning for breakfast. After staying an hour and a half, and time to go back to\nthe kheder and I was not supposed to be late to the yeshiva, and I was not supposed to be late\nin the yeshiva. And I was held -- when I was holding the handle 1n the door to walk out and\nsaying to the Tante,\u201d \"A guten Tag, Tante Esther.\u201d\u201d That that's -- then, only then, she shouted\nfrom the other room, \"A guten Tag, Dovid Yankele. Du vilst dokh vos zu essen?\"\u00b0 \"Would\nyou want to eat something?\" And by then it was too late, and I walked out.",
        "Q: And this happened every Thursday?",
        "A: Every Thursday.",
        "Q: Until what age were you at the yeshiva?",
        "A: I was in the yeshiva until about 12 years, from the age of six. So I was six years. Every,\nevery session was six months. So I had about, about five to six years in the yeshiva, which 1s\nabout 10 zmanim.\u2019\n* After-hours Hebrew and religious instruction (Yiddish).\n\u00b0 Yeshiva student or Yeshiva boy (Yiddish).\n* It should be noted that the Yiddish the interviewee speaks displays (as in the Yiddish\npronunciation of Lithuanians who lived close to the former east Prussian border)\nconsiderable German inflections.\n> \u201cGood morning, Aunt Esther.\u201d (Yiddish)\n\u00b0 \u201cGood morning, David Jacob. Would you like something to eat?\u201d (Yiddish)\n\u201d Semesters (Yiddish)",
        "Q: And what, what happened when you were twelve years old?",
        "A: My father died. My father took sick. He was never sick in his life. He worked like a horse to\nsupport his wife and the five daughters. He didn't have to support me then because I was\neating days in the yeshiva. And the first week he took sick, he died in three, four days. They\nsent a horse and buggy -- there was no, no motor vehicles in that time. And if there would\nhave been already a bus or a truck that what would be cruising from Aniksht to Vilkomir, my\nfamily didn't have the money to pay. So a horse and buggy who was cruising constantly,\ntwice a week from Aniksht to Vilkomir, picked me up to take me home. When I walked in in\nthe house, the father's bed was standing 1n the middle of the living room. And I managed to\ncome over to his bed and tell him, \"Father, it's me, Dovid Yankele.\" And he managed to\nmove his hand over my body with affection, and a few minutes later he was dead. The\nlederer Rov,\u2019 the chief rabbi in Aniksht, who was this really holy man, he explain me that\nmy father would have been dead three, four days ago -- the first or the second day he took\nsick -- except God kept him alive until the moment I arrive, and that's when he passed away.",
        "Q: What happened to your family then?",
        "A: In that time, my father was extremely well-to-do. He had good days and bad days. But in that\ntime, so happened that he had horses and chickens and, and, and, and cows. And the day he\ndied, before the age of 12 or about, I suddenly became the old man of the family, and I had\nto take care not only of five grown-up sisters of mine and a constantly sick mother, but I had\nto take care of four horses and six cows and 12 chickens and porcupines. I had my own\nporcupine, who was still in the house. And I had to take care of all that. And it was a little\ntoo much for me. My older sister happened to have had escaped from Lithuania to deep\nRussia in the First World War, and she came back as a returnee. She had a husband and two\nchildren. All three of them died from hunger in her presence, so she was mentally slightly\ntouched off. And when I decided to sell all the cows and all the horses and everything, to\nliquidate the properties, she became disturbed, and she grabbed a knife, and she was ready to\nstab me. And I escaped and came to the capital, Kovno, where one of my sisters was married\nby then already, and I stayed with her. And from there on, I developed myself.",
        "Q: How old were you when you moved to Kovno?",
        "A: Well, that happened within a period of a few weeks or a few months. So I was about 14 -- 13\nto 14 when that incident happened, and I came to Kovno.",
        "Q: And once you got to Kovno?\n* Rabbi (Yiddish)",
        "A: I stayed for a little while with my married sister. And after that, I got myself a job as a\nmessenger boy in different retail outlets. And from there on, I, I kept building my life the\nbest way I can. All my other sisters were single, and they all had boyfriends. And all their\nboyfriends were ready to marry them except they refused to marry them without getting the\ndowry, which was the custom in the Jewish tradition in those days, which was called nadn.\u201d\nAnd without nadn, they weren't ready to marry them. We helped marry off my first sister by\nissuing \"veksels,\u201d\u201d\u201d which is promissory notes, of five thousand dollars for the two houses\nwhich we owned. Both houses were connected to each other, and there was a barn where we\nkept the cows and the horses in between the houses so you could walk from the inside. It was\na valuable property in those days. So the promissory notes that we had, first my mother and I\nhad to sign up to my first brother-in-law, otherwise he would not have married my sister.\nAnd he kept the notes in his -- under his pillow in his bed. So with the conniving of my\nmarried sister, we took out the notes from him and we gave it to the boyfriend of my second\nsister, and he married her. From thereon, we repeatedly did that all the time until all my\nsisters were married.",
        "Q: I see. And when you were living in Kovno, as you got older, what different kinds of jobs did\nyou have?",
        "A: Since I didn't had any schooling; it was forbidden while I was a yeshiva bokher to educate\nmyself. And we were living eight boys in one room, for the sole purpose that the boys should\nspy on each other, or not one of the boys should do something wrong illegally. And reading\na book in any language other than the Gemara was a illegal deed. So I had to have a candle, a\nlighted candle, covered with my blanket in order to read literature. And I tried to study, to\neducate myself. I gave up the study in yeshiva, because a student relative of mine in\nVilkomir, by the name of Yankel Zibutz (ph) smuggled me in the life of Baruch Spinoza and\nIsrael Acosta (ph). And when I was finished reading those two books under the candlelight\ncovered in my bed at night, in the danger of burning down the whole village and the whole\nhouse, I realized that to be a yeshiva bokher and continue is not for me. I became a educated\nskeptic, and I gave up the study. And by then, my father died and it happened what it\nhappened to me. So without any trade, I was too young for any trade or any occupation. So I\nwas getting jobs in retail outlets to make deliveries, and I joined up a Yiddish cultural night\nschool, where they was teaching people who didn't had the elementary schooling to be\neducated in the -- at night. And that is my -- what I had. After working for several retail\noutlets, I finally got myself a job in a office supply retail outlet by a childless couple. And\nthey, more or less, treated me like their own child. And I grew up with them, and became a\nadult with those people.",
        "Q: Can you tell me what happened as you moved into your 20s?\n\u201d Dowry (Hebrew)\n0 Promissory note, IOU (Yiddish)",
        "A: As I moved into my 20s ... I -- being engaged in a office products company, and where the\nLithuanian intellectuals, under the leadership of the priests and the, and the educated people\nstarted a tremendous antisemitic hate campaign towards the Jews. And the office products\ncompany were the first victims, because it was only and primarily the government\ninstitutions like the Foreign Ministry and the Diplomatic Ministry and the Internal Ministry,\nand all the other government agencies who were the prime customers of the office supply\ncompanies. And the government and the fascist Siauliaitist party kept sending pickets to\npicket some of the Jewish stores so gentiles should not come in. And the government\ninstructions was not to buy from Jews. I attempted, with the help of the proprietors of the\ncompany, to do something in that respect. And I took a trip to my village, which was\nAniksht. And there, I discussed with a gentile former childhood friend of mine by the name\nof Jonas Kovalisch (ph), and I encouraged him to come to Kovno and to buy out the existing\nretail outlet. And he lined up a, a, another gentile gentleman by the name of Jonas\nSvinkeviches (ph), who was a former publisher of the, of dictionaries and other books, and\nwas not engaged in that time in any business. And the two of them bought out the company,\nand it became a pure Christian company. And they became extremely successful because all\nthe agencies of the government institutions immediately start to buy from them. I still\nremained with the company as a inside man in the, in the closed, in the -- in the locked --\nlocked inside quarters, far away from the eye of the public. And yet, the very same\npurchasing agents of the very same government agencies who were placing the orders,\nrefused to deal with the pure Lithuanian Christian employees, and they dealt only with me.",
        "Q: And this was shortly before the war?",
        "A: That was up until 1933. In 1933, it became more and more difficult, and my position with\nthe company became more and more difficult because people didn't stay in their job very\nlong. People got old. People got married. They moved away. So new employees came in the\npurchasing departments, and they didn't want to be bothered with buying, with, with taking\ncare of, with me helping them take care of. So my position became more or less obsolete. So\nJonas Kowalisch (ph) decided, with my consent, that instead of keeping me in Kovno on the\njob which I had no, no, no purpose anymore and there was no way how I could get any other\nexistence, he decided to send me on a trip to America. Since the relationship was so good\nwith all the government agencies, he made me make an appointment with the protocol chief\nof the Foreign Ministry in Kovno. And when I had the appointment with that gentlemen, he\ntold me, \"David, I'll give you diplomatic papers that you are a diplomatic courier. I'll give\nyou two suitcases, where you'll deliver to the Lithuanian Embassy in Kovno in New York --\nor to the Lithuanian Consulate in New York. And you will travel as a diplomatic courier, and\nyou'll be able to get a visa and come in to the United States. If I will not have -- and I\ncertainly will not have -- any documents to send it to you -- with you. I will put in\nnewspapers and fill it in.\" And that's what happened. I got a visa. I arrived to America. I\ndelivered the two suitcases to the Consul General, to the Lithuanian Consul General, in New\nYork. And I went to my, my family from Bedford Hills picked me up, and I stayed there for\na short period of time.",
        "Q: But then you went back to Lithuania?",
        "A: No, I did not go back to Lithuania. And then, when my immigration, when my visa time\nexpired, I discovered that if you have fifty dollars in your pocket, you can take any\ntransportation and arrive in Lisbon without any documents, in Lisbon, Portugal, without any\nvisas or any documents. Or maybe they did require some kind of a paper where you would\nget where you get it in the, in the Portuguese Consulate in New York. I had the fifty dollars. I\narranged everything, and I took a boat, and two weeks later, I arrived in Lisbon. And I\nattempt to get established over there, to build up my existence.",
        "Q: Um-hm, and what happened then?",
        "A: After a while -- by then it was already closer to 1936. After a while, the sit- the situation in\neastern Europe, particularly Lithuania and the three Baltic states -- Lithuania, Latvia and\nEstonia -- became extremely dangerous. Vul-vulnerable from Hitler's part and from Stalin's\npart. Those three Baltic countries are like a little kitten squeezed in between a lion and a\nhippopotamus. And I felt that my five sisters -- I'm sorry -- by then it was only four sisters,\nbecause one of my brother-in-laws, my youngest sister Hanke (ph), was a leftist activist in\nKovno. And Lithuania was a fascist government under the rule of President Smetona.'' And\nhe was in danger to be arrested and be imprisoned for a long, long time -- escaped to South\nAmerica, to Uruguay. And three, four months after he arrived in Uruguay, he sent papers for\nmy sister. So the two of them were in Uruguay. So I was left with four sisters. I realized that\nif anything happens, anything dramatic happens to Kovno or to Lithuania, all my four sisters,\nwith all their four husbands -- each of them had four or five children -- and with all their\nchildren -- and my mother, my mother must have been 70 years by then. They will be\ndestroyed in 10 minutes after anything happened, without me and my supervision and my\nability to survive. So I voluntarily left Portugal to go back to Lithuania to be with my family.",
        "Q: And what happened when you got back?",
        "A: When I arrived there, I became a volun-- a, a free-lance business representative. I had friends\n'' Antanas Smetona was the leader of the fascist Gelezinis Vilkas (iron Wolf) movement and\npresident of Lithuania since 1926.\nin every industry -- in the garment industry, in the office product industry. I had a assistant\nby the name of Jonas Petronis (ph). He was a pure Christian. And here began the antisemitic\ndrive. The hate towards the Jews became stronger and stronger with the influence of Hitler.\nAnd no Jewish office supply storekeeper, or stationery storekeeper, could ever survive\nanymore. In the hundreds and hundreds of villages in Lithuania, every dru -- every little store\nwas selling school supplies for the schools. The written or non-written instructions -- I don't\nknow which one it 1s -- came that no school in any community in Lithuania should purchase\noffice products as school supplies from the Jewish storekeepers. So the Catholic hierarchy in\nKovno, where it's the headquarters of all the hate towards the Jews, decided to open up a\nwholesale office product business to supply all the school systems in Lithuania with office\nproducts and school supplies and books. By that, they took away by itself automatically all\nthe business from the Jewish store keepers. And my friend, Jonas Petronis (ph) became --\nthe, the priests and the prelates, they had nothing to do with the office products. What did\nthey know about office products? So he became the general director of all the off -- of all the\nimports of the office product supplies in Lithuania, for the whole Lithuanian region. And\nsnaturally, being one of the few non-Jewish-hating Lithuanians, he immediately made me the\n-- appointed me to be the general representative, or independent dealer, on all the products\nwhat they had. I was able to buy wholesale, and I was able to sell to the Jewish retail\nstorekeepers and to the non-Jewish retail, and to provide myself with a decent existence. I, I\nhave to stop for a second.",
        "Q: Sure. Take a drink of water... You can continue when ever you\u2019re ready",
        "A: I'm ready.",
        "Q: What, what happened next?",
        "A: That was in about 1936, towards the end of 1936. Where I build myself my existence\nthrough the means I just explained you and were as comfortable as anybody could be. I\nsupported all my sisters' families where they were spread out all over Lithuania. One of my\nsisters remained in Aniksht. Another sister was living in Jonava. A third sister was living in\nKovno, in the suburb of Kovno called Slobodka; and a fourth sister was in Aleksotas. And\nwith the grace of Jonas Petronis (ph), I was very successful in my business. I'm sorry, I'd like\nto correct myself. With the grace of the one of the few decent, non-Jewish-hating Christians,\nJonas Petronis (ph), I was able to become very successful and help all my family, and help\nall the people with whom I was ever involved in business, and many of my friends. Financial\nresource was no object with me at all.",
        "Q: Were you trying at that point to get your family out of Lithuania?",
        "A: There was no way how to make any attempt to get out the family of Lithuania. The whole\nworld was closed for Lithuanian Jews. As a matter of fact, the day of the ti -- the day of the\nout-outbreak of the war between Hitler and Stalin, there were there were extremely wealthy\nJews walking around with foreign passports and foreign visas to go in any part of the world.\nAnd they couldn't go because Lithuania wouldn't let them out. And the consul of the\nprospective countries, who gave out the visas because of decency and humane reasons, knew\nbefore he gave them the visas that those countries wouldn't let them in. There was no way for\nme to attempt to take out my family or myself. I came in. I came in to the, to the, to the --\nvoluntarily from a free country like Portugal to this situation, because I knew that my family\nwould not have survived any difficulty without me. But to attempt to get out, there was no\nway.",
        "Q: Can you tell me what happened when the war started, when Germany invaded Poland? What\nhappened to you in Lithuania?",
        "A: What happened to me 1s, in Vilijampole, where my sister in Vilijampole, where my sister\nlived was the heart of the Jewish poor population in Kovno. The popularity -- the population\n-- was mostly Jewish. All the great famous yeshivas were there. And when the war broke\nout, it took three days and three nights that the German were not able to step in in the\nvillages, in Kovno and in other villages, because the fronts were going on fightings between\nthe Russian Army and the German Army. But the civil Russian popula-- government in\nevery community, including Kovno and Vilijampolis, disintegrated within a half a day of the\nfirst outbreak of the war, which was the night of June 21st, 1941. In those three days and\nthree nights, with the Russian might disappeared suddenly within one day. All the\nfunctionaries of the Russian government and Party had their trucks and their buses and other\nmeans of transportation stacked away somewhere. And when it happened, they all packed up\ntheir families and they left. And the population was left without any mercy at all. And it's the\nLithuanian fascists, who were prepared for all the time since the Russian rule was in Kovno,\nsecretly, by the Nazi agents to have uniforms and ammunition. So the first half a hour after\nthe outbreak of the war that there was no more Russian might, the Lithuanian fascists -- they\ncalled themselves Siauliaitists or Siaulitists (ph), I don't know exactly -- the very same\norganization who before the war was doing all the anti-Jewish activities, they were within\none half an hour in uniforms.\nAnd they marched in in Slobodka; and they murdered the most brutal, the most unbelieved\ninhumanely torturous way almost all the population, the Jewish population, in that\ncommunity. I was supposed to be there, too, and I was supposed to be murdered. And I know\nthat there's no reason why I would have a better human being than everybody, where all my\nfriends were murdered. Except for one thing. Being a volun -- free. Being a independent\nrepresentative in the office products field, where I was selling to the retail outlets and I had a\ntremendous fine relationship with all the employees in the companies with whom I did\nbusiness. And one of the companies, the employee manager \u2014 a, a Jewish girl by the name of\nHinda \u2014 Hindale (ph), she was a member of the Communist Party. She was a member of the\nExecutive Committee of the Communist Party. And as soon as the Communist, Communist\nrule took over the power in Kovno -- that was about 1940, about a year prior to the outbreak\nof the war -- she called me. It's about a week and a half, about a week prior to the start of the\nwar. She called me that there's a meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party,\nand my name was put on to be sent to Siberia. For months and months and months, or weeks\nand weeks, the secret police used to ring the bell in the, in the most of the Jewish houses,\npack them up, send them to the station and send them to Siberia. There was no way of telling\nwho will be next to go. Since of my attitude being extremely polished and friendly with\neverybody, one of these, one of the highest activists of the Communist Party was constantly\nimprisoned by the Lithuanian. And he was a, a -- and his background was the office product\nindustry, and his family was known. And Hindale was the one who was collecting money\nfrom me to support his family, and to support other families, and the other of the imprisoned\npolitical prisoners, Jewish or non-Jewish. I gave to everybody generously, so she knew\nexactly who I was. And there were a great deal of members of the Central Committee of the\nCommunist Pa -- Kovno Lithuanian Communist Party, who also knew about my activities as\na human being. And she called me and informed me that I am on the list to be taken to\nSiberia. There was a mi-- a, a minority rule vote against taking me out, but the majority won.\nAnd she suggested to me that the person from whose family I helped support -- I don't know\nhis name, he became the head of the rectory of the vacation. He became the Commissioner\nof the head of the vacation for the whole commercial enterprises in Kovno. And since I was -\n- had to take a job by then already, because I also was advised by inside information that it's\nnot healthy for me to be a free-lance representative, so they appointed a job for me in one of\nthe retail outlets.\nI became the prekiau (ph) zinaviets\u2019~ (ph) -- the merchandise specialist. So she suggested to\nme I thought I should call that gentleman and ask him to grant me a vacation, because I\ndidn't feel good. I called him in his office, I made an appointment with him the same day to\nhave dinner with him in a restaurant. I explained to him that I don't feel good. I happen\nphysically to suffer from psoriasis. And all I had to do is unroll my sleeve and scratch a little\nin my, in my, in my joint area that 1t becomes white, to convince him that I am what I am.\nAnd he saw it. He called me the next day, and suggested that there's two openings for me on\nvacation. One was in Sochi, in Crimo-Cacausus\u2019\u201d -- the most luxury resort area in Russia,\nwhere Stalin personally had one of his villas. And I certainly shivered away from that. The\nnext place was Druskininkai, a resort area, a very famous resort area which belonged to\nLithuania five hundred years ago at the time when Lithuania ruled a great deal of eastern\n* Tn Lithuanian, the word for merchandise is \u201cprekes.\u201d The word for knowledge is\n\u201czinojimas.\u201d The interviewee\u2019s alteration of the endings of both words is probably due to\na vernacular not present in our dictionaries.\n'\u00b0 Located on the Black Sea, very near the border between the Russian S.F.S.R. and Georgia.\nEurope. And in 1918-20, in the war between the Lithuanian's independent and Poland's\nindependent, a Polish general occupied the whole territory with this Lithuanian capital of\nVilna, and it became Polish. And I accepted to go to Druskininkai. Since I am a person of -- I\nnever believed in delaying matters and in being sloppy, whatever I do, I immediately\naccepted the permit and that was on Monday night. Tuesday, I took the train to Druskininkai.\nI arrived there late Tuesday night. I registered in the hotel with all the formalities. And\nWednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday night, I was dancing in a nightclub with the, with\nthe wife of a Russian colonel -- the head of the Com-- of the whole Russian Army in that\narea. And we walked out 12 o'clock midnight, and we hear tremendous thunder. And she\nsaid that, \"These maneuvers... my husband told me that we may have maneuvers.\" And I\nsaid, \"No, that's not maneuvers. That is some kind of a war.\" And I went straight to the hotel.\nAnd a few minutes after I arrived to the hotel, the loudspeaker heard already Molotov's\nspeech that war broke out. I think we'll have a little recess.",

        "Q: Why don't you just continue whenever you're ready. Continue whenever you're ready. What,\nwhat happened once the war broke out? What, what happened to you now?",
        "A: I will continue. Oh, sorry. Can I stand up for a minute?\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",

        "Q: When the war broke out.",
        "A: Since I was a fairly well-to-do person, and without a family, as soon as the Communists took\nover Lithuania, everybody in Lithuania, every -- but everybody had to look like Stalin, to\nmake themselves a Stalin jacket and high boots, and pants with, with -- how do you call it?\n'* Molotov, Vyachelslav (1890-1986)\nRider pants, whatever it was. So I, I had tailor-made luxury black ankle leather coats, with\nhigh boots, with Stalinuvka\u2019\u201d (ph) jackets. And at the ttme when Molotov's speech was\ndelivered, the tens of thousands of vacationers, they're starting to run around in chaotic -- a\nmad situation. And nobody know what to do, and nobody knew where to go. And I\nimmediately decided that I will start to escape in the only highway road which was near the\nresort area. And I walked out with my beautiful black raincoat, dressed in the beautiful boots\nto look like a commissar. And after 10, 15 minutes walking, my feet were already crippled,\nand I had to throw away the boots and walk barefoot. I walked for an hour this way. While\npassing by -- that was in the middle of the night -- there was a water well. And thousands of\npeople were laying around the water well, hanging around. There was a school of Russian\nstudents. I don't remember what kind of school. It was a vocational school. And the boys\nwho were who were taking out the water from the well wore uniforms. And the thousands of\npeople had stretched out their hands to get a drink of water. I had some properties with me,\nand in the properties I had built in two very, very expensive diamonds. I prepared myself for\nthat kind of even-eventuality in many situations. In, in a dry shaving soap container, like a\nlittle, like a little roller. And I took that out and stretched out my hand to hand over to the\nboys; and within two seconds, I got the water. And I continued. Daybreak came, and by then\nI was half-dead. I couldn't walk anymore. I was on a field where thousands of people were\nlaying stretched out on the field, already half-dead from the same difficulty of walking\nbarefoot.\nAnd the German airplanes came flying over the field. And a lot of people were shoving\nthemselves through their bodies crawling, with the hope that they will be able to crawl closer\nto the bombs and get killed so they die, but it didn't happen to me. And it just so happened\nthat by then I was near a road where thousands of refugees were running towards Russia.\nThat highway was closer to Russia. Those borders, in those days, the, the, the, the national\nterritories that a little, a little highway, a little road -- here was Poland, five seconds later it\nwas Ukrainia, and, and a little bit further it was Byelorussia. It was all part of the same\nterritories. So I happened to be lying near the, the route, near the road, where a Jewish family\nwith a horse and buggy, with some children and women were on the, on the, on the, on the\nwagon, and men were walking with the wagon. And one of the women noticed me. And she\nstarted to cry and forced the man to put me on the wagon. And on the wagon, they bandaged\nmy feet and powdered it. And I recuperated. And after traveling all day and almost a half a\nnight, wherever we went the Germans were ahead of us. Finally we land up a village in\nUkraine. We were 1n a barn of a, of a Ukrainian farmer house. It was then already forbidden\nby Jews to take in wandering Jews. So the Ukrainian had mercy with us and took us in the\nbarn. And I remember if it happened today, right now, that his two grown-up sons were busy\nin the village robbing the Jewish properties. And the old man -- he must have been eighty,\nninety years old -- stood for hours in the doorway of his barn where we were laying, with a,\nwith a stick like a baseball stick over his shoulder, ready to beat his sons when they'll be\n> Stalinka jackets.\nfinished robbing the Jewish houses in the village and when they will come back home to stop\nthem from going in in the barn and kill us and take away the properties what those people\nhad with whom I was attached. I had no properties again at all anymore, so there was\nnothing to take from me. All they could do is kill me.\nAfter we left this property, we continued riding further and further and further. And we didn't\nmanage to go very far, where we stopped at another house. And I, I was relaxed already and\nalmost everything in my foot healed, except one area which was bleeding. And I was sitting\nin the front of the house. I think the house, the people in the house what made me do\nsomething in the front -- clean a pot, I don't remember what. And a group of German soldiers\nstopped and asked me, \"Du Jude?\"'\u00b0 And I said, \"Jude.\" And they took me with them. They\ntook me to a, to a, to a, to a fairly decent-looking residence. And it was vacant, and they\nmade me scrub the floor. It was the headquarters for the commanding general to stopover\nwhen he will arrive. They were preparing the headquarters. And since one of the guards\nnoticed my bleeding foot, they called in the military doctor and he bandaged my foot. In the\nmeantime, he bought something to eat. And after I was finished cleaning, they took me back\nto the place where they picked me up. By then, it was too late to go anywhere, because the\nroutes were bombed and destroyed and the Germans were everywhere. So the family, the\nfamily from Grodno to whom I attached myself, decided to go back to Grodno. And it took\nus several days. And we arrived in Grodno. Shortly before we came to the proper city in\nGrodno, there was the gendarmes, the military gendarmes, who were controlling the traffic.\nAnd they stepped -- they stopped us and identified a whole group as Jews and took us\nstraight to the prison. And from there, they kept us for a day or so. And since the whole\nfamily was in Grodno, resident family, they let them all go -- including me. So I stayed for a\nfew days with that family. Shortly afterwards, few -- I rested for a day or so. And then I --\nthey told me -- I spoke no Polish. So the family with whom I was staying discovered that\nthere are thousands of refugees are lined up in the front of the German commandant to get\npasses to go back to their homes. Where do you have that many thousands of refugees?\nBecause Druskininkai, the resort area where I was, was a resort area only for, for\nvacationers. There were dozens of hotels only for vacationers. And there were many other\nresort hotels in that area. So thousands, and maybe tens of thousands of Russian laborers and\nemployees who had a vacation lined up over there and were caught in the war. And they all\nlined up in Grodno, in the front of the Kommandantur to get passes to go home. And I did\nthe same thing. The procedure was: there was a big street, no traffic, it was blocked off;\nacross the street of the building of the Kommandantur, the thousands of people were staying\nand waiting in line. There were several German guards who controlled the traffic of the\npeople. And when a group of 10, 20 people walked out from the Kommandantur, that means\nthey took care of their business. The guards permitted a group of these other 10, 20 people to\ngo in. Since thousands of people were waiting on the other side and the guard doesn't\ndesignate who should come in, so the thousands of them was starting to run. So the guards\n'\u00b0 \u201cAre You a Jew?\u201d (German)\nwere controlling the outside. They let that many people in, and they did not permit any more.\nAnd the rest of them went back. That repeated itself several times a day. I was there for one\nday, and I think a second day. After that, the rule came out that every Jew should wear a Star\nof David. And the Grodno family made up Stars of David on the front and on the back, and\nthey made a set of Star of Davids for me, too. So the next morning, six o'clock in the\nmorning, I arrived at the, at the line-up place, already with my Star of David. I am not a tall\nperson. And between the husky big people without the Star of David, I would never had a\nopportunity to get there because as groups of people got their, their fulfillment, new groups\nof people arrived to wait for the police. A day passed by. Although nobody ever attempted to\noffend me at all, while I was standing, but when I started to run with all the other people to\nget in, that's when they pushed me aside and did not let me go near it. And one day, I think,\ntwo days passed by. Early morning on the third day, when I lined up together with all the\nother people, the German guard walked over to me and said, \"Du, Jude, komm.\"\"\u2019 And he\nwalked me through the gate, and while walking he said to me, \"Die Schweine, die, die, die\nRussians! Ich hab gesehen was ist \u2014 was angeht, und du hast niemals die Gelegenheit\ndurchzugehen.\" 6",
        "Q: Can you translate that?",
        "A: I was the only Jew with the Star of David waiting for a permission to go through. And he\nrealized there's so much going on. And he walked me through the Kommandantur. I walked\nin, in the corridor, and the officer was sitting at the desk. And I explained to him in German\nthat I'm, I'm going to the Kommandantur to ask a permit to go back from Kovno, to go back\nto Kovno. And he told me to go on the second floor, I'll see the people there, I'll know where\nto go in. And I did walk in, and my turn came after a little while. And another elderly\nGerman officer was sitting at, at the desk, and he and a civilian Pole was standing next to\nhim. Since all the applicants for permission to go home were not Poles -- they were Russian\nand Ukrainian, and all, all other people and all nationalities. Poles had no need to ask\npermission to go home, because that was their home at that moment. So, naturally, the\nCommandant had an interpreter. And I was the only Jew who came over. And the Polish\ninterpreter attempted immediately to explain the Commandant, in his broken Pol\u2014German -\n- that I am a Communist and I should be shot right away. My ear was very clear then. I stood\nup like, like \"Achtung!\" -- you know, like \"Attention!\" -- and I said to the Commandant,\n\"Der Mann ligt! Ich bin ein, ein, ein -- ich bin hier ftir Erholung in Druskininkai, und bin in\ndem middle auf dem Ausbruch, auf dem Krieg, von Kovno, Lithuanien. Und ich bitte dem\nCommandant erlauben es zuriickziehen nach Kovno.\"\u2019\u201d The man took a look at me, picked\nup his stamp, stamped on a paper, and out I was.\n'T \u201cVou, Jew, come.\u201d (German)\n'* \u201cThe swine, the, the, the Russians! I have seen what is going on, and you have no chance\nto go through.\u201d (German)\n'? \"The man lies! I have been an, an, an -- I am here for rehabilitation at Druskininkai and\nhave been caught in the middle of the escape from Kovno, Lithuania. And if the\ncommandant will allow, will return to Kovno.\" (German)",
        "Q: Ok, this is probably a good place to stop. We -- they -- have to change the tapes, so we can\ntake a break now.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: We\u2019re ready to go back on. We left off with your getting permission to go back to Kovno.",
        "A: I went back to the family in Grodno. They, they gave me a little food to go, and the next day\nin the morning I started off to go on foot towards Lithuania, which people suggested the\nroute I should take. There's not traffic. I was the only one going on that route, and no\nwalkers, nothing. I was just by myself. I walked all day long and rested for a while. It was --\nby then, it was in mid-- in mid-July, and it was extremely hot. And from time to time, I\nrested. I became thirsty, but I had nowhere out to drink. And towards the evening, I arrived\nat the house. There wasn't even any houses where to stop. But that was a house, and I\nstopped. And they gave me something to eat and they gave me to drink, and I continued.\nAnd late at night I arrived back in Druskininkai. From there, I started off. And by then, was\nalready a rule issued by the German authorities that no local resident should be permitted to\ntake in a strange Jew in their houses, under the penalty of death. Then I stretched out on the\nsidewalk, laying there ready to die, whatever will happen to me. I was extremely exhausted\nfrom the walk. I was already again hungry and thirsty. And early in the morning -- I laid all\nnight like that -- and early in the morning, at time when people were beginning to move\naround, there were two Jewish girls from Kovno who were also vacationing. They were\nnurses. I think they were sisters. And they saw me laying on the sidewalk. They recognized\nme. They came over, and they cried dramatically over me. But they couldn't help me, either.\nBut they brought me some water, and something to eat. And I strengthened myself a little bit.\nAnd after a while, I was laying there again. I didn't have the strength to get up. And two girls\npassed by. And they passed me -- Christian girls -- they passed me by laughing and giggling.\nAnd while they passed me by, one of them made a remark. I don't remember why the remark\nwas. And they came back, and that one girl recognized me. In the good days, prior -- about a\nyear, a year and a half ago, when Hitler attacked Poland, thousands of Polish Jewish refugees\nfind themselves in Lithuania. And one person from Warsaw, whom I became very friendly\nand sheltered him and helped him economically and to survive, happened to be a playboy.\nAnd he -- the girls were clinging to him like, like honey to a bee, and he had dates\nconstantly. And since I was a single fellow, too, we had dates together. And I remember one\nweekend he arranged a date for me with two gentile girls whose sister was married to a\nJewish musician in Kovno. And we had a beautiful evening together; but that was about a\nyear ago of the time that I was laying on the sidewalk. And my date, one of the two girls we\nhad a date, was that girl. How do you like that?! And she happened to be the sister of the\nLithuanian chief of the organized partisan murderous bands, who were busy in that time not\nto bother with the Jews.\nBecause 1n the Polish Ukrainian villages, the Lithuanian partisans who take over the power\nimmediately were busy antagonizing or robbing or murdering the Poles. They had not -- they\ndidn't have to bother with the Jews, because the Jews wouldn't run away from them. They\nhad time plenty for the Jews later on. But her brother was the head of the organizers of the\nmurderous partisan bands, who for participated in most of the destructive murders of Kovno\n-- including Slobodka, primarily Slobodka. Where if I would have been there, what I started\nto explain you originally. By all counts I should have been there. But because physically I\nhappened to be in Druskininkai, so I wasn't murdered. So he brought me in his house.",
        "Q: And then what happened?",
        "A: Then they gave me to eat and to drink, and they gave me some clothing. And he was getting\nready to send a transport of additional murderers to Kovno, to continue with the beautiful\nwork they did. And he instructed them to put me in the truck and to take me to Kovno. After\nall, I was his custody. And he instructed them, and he had told me, that on the highway they\nwill be stopped by a German officer who was the real head chief of the, of the, of the\nEinsatzkommando.\u201d\u201d And he will give them additional instructions in writing and will\nconverse with them. The German didn't speak Lithuanian, and the Lithuanian didn't speak\nGerman. But he will give them instructions what, additional instructions what to do in\nKovno. Prior to this stop, where he was supposed to wait for them, the soldiers should put\nme underneath their feet between the benches. The truck had benches arranged for people to\nsit. And they should cover me up with their feet. And he explained me, too -- or his sister\nexplained me -- that it will be stopped, and a German officer will talk German. I should not\nbreath or make any sign of anything. I should stay still. And I did, and they passed by. The\ntrip was a pretty long trip. It was almost a whole day. Towards the evening, they stopped in\nthe front of a, of a farmhouse, or a restaurant, where they all went in to eat. And they took\nme in, too, and I ate with them. When they arrived in Kovno, on Vilna Street -- one of the\nmain streets -- they just let me off. I'm finished. I'm finished, I -- their duty was over. That\nhouse was not far of the house where my brother-in-law's brother was living. So I walked in\nin that house, in their apartment. And there I find my sister with her two children, and my\nmother, from Jonava, with a niece of mine -- the one who survived. And there they -- I\ndiscovered the whole the whole story what happened. I would have been in Slobodka, in my\nsister's house. And they avoid that the brutal murder of the pogroms on the first three days.\nOn the fourth day, a group of partisans, murderous, decided to go and check out from house\nto house.\nMy sister happened to have lived in a attic. So the eight, nine men who were hiding were up\nthere in that apartment -- my brother-in-law, his brother, his son and other people -- they're\nhiding in the attic. It was not the straight down roof where you could fold up. It was a attic\nroof like areas were straight, where people could lay down there. After they didn't find\nanybody, they all walked out. And some of the idiots inside decided to look from, on the\n\u201d Task force (German)\nbalcony, decided to look if it's all over. And the last partisan decided to look up, and they\nmet each other. And they took them all down, and they took them to the Ninth\nFortification.\u201d' And they murdered them, together with most of the Jews that were murdered.\nYou have to remember that this Fortification, the Seventh and the Ninth Fortification, was\nfortifications -- you know what a fortification is? Built by the Czarist Russia to pretend -- to\nprevent -- attacks from German armies in, in 1905. And they were still in existence. And the\nLithuanian took them over, and that's where they murdered most of the Jews. They took\nthem there.",
        "Q: What, what happens to you next, now that you're back?",
        "A: The next, the next thing what happened, I happened to have an apartment in Kovno. My\nmother, when I made the trip to Druskininkai for a vacation, my mother was living with me.\nShe was taking care of the maid I had, and helping her. I didn't want my mother to be by\nherself. So I gave her money to buy gifts for all her daughters, and travel to visit from one\ndaughter to the other. And the first stop she made was in Jonava, with my sister who had\nfou-four children. Over there, the first day the Jews were lined up from their apartments,\ndriven to the forest and they were kept for several days. My then-70-years-old mother\nrealized that nothing good will come out from the whole thing. And she grabbed Dinah's (ph)\nhand -- my oldest niece, my sister's oldest daughter -- and she pushed herself closer and\ncloser to the forest. And when it became dark, she pulled out Dinah and they walked away.\nThey were hiding during the day in the, in the, in the ravinas (ph). Ravina, that's a English\nword? Between the -- and during the night, they were walking. A woman who couldn't read\nand write, never went to a school, never know what a map means, managed to go from\nJanova to Kovno. And that's how they arrived in Kovno. They were hiding during the day,\nbecause they would have been caught by the partisans and murdered. And if there weren't\nany partisans, some of the decent Christians would have fingered them to the partisans and\ncalled over a murderer. So they arrived in Kovno. So I had already a built-in family of my\nsister Chayke (ph), whose husband was murdered in Slobodka, with her little girl, Raisele\n(ph), and a boy, Alenke (ph). The boy was six years old. The girl was about 12, 14. That was\nthree people. My mother is four, and Dinahle (ph) then is five. So I had five dependents, on\nwhose ability to survive depends on me only. After a while, the rule came out to go into\nKovno ghetto. I, on the other hand, the minute when I heard what happened to my brother-\nin-law and their, and the, the other people -- and that had happened only three, four days\nbefore my arrival. Because they didn't murder them in the first three days of the onslaught. It\nwas on the fourth day; and it was three -- it was seven days since the beginning. I decided to\nwalk to the criminal police headquarters to attempt to speak to this chief of the criminal\npolice, Mr. Pomatitis (ph).\nMy relationship with Pomatitis was as following: while I was the manager, so-called\n*! Ninth Fort\nmanager of the new Christian office products store and his office was buying, and he\npersonally was coming and place orders for me for 5,000 dollar carpets and other expensive\nproperties and put in on the invoice \"office products\" to be sent to his home, it was a\npersonal relationship between him and myself. Since I wasn\u2019t some several times for\nbusiness, and when I became the employee of the government store retail outlet, after the,\nthe Communists took over, because I had to have a job, his wife was coming to the store to\nbuy school supplies for the children. So she told me that he was imprisoned in the Kovno\nprison, and I realized that they had difficulty to survive. So I gave her money to buy the\nschool supplies. I helped her with food, and I sent quite often hilf* -- help -- to her house.\nMy logic was, that when he was rel-- freed from prison from the Communists, and became\nagain the chief of the police headquarters in Kovno, my logic was that she would have told\nhim what I did. He knew who I am. And I think I'll take the, I'll take the risk and go to see\nhim, and ask him if he can liberate my brother-in-law and all the people who were kept in\nthat house. And that's what I did. In order to be secure, because it wasn't safe to walk through\nKovno for the Lithuanian partisans who didn't know who I am and didn't care who I am, I\nhad a distant relative -- a Jewish distant relative -- who was a former volunteer in the original\nLithuanian Army. And that was a big honor by the Lithuanians, and he wore a little button\non his--. With that, we were stopped a couple times going to the, to the police, to this. -- to\nthe chief of police, to Mr. Pomatitis, which was all the way on the, on the, on the new part in\nKovno, quite a distant. But we arrived. There were thousands of Jews waiting in the offices\nfor appointments, and hundreds and hundreds of Lithuanian and other minorities who were\nwaiting for their appointment. But when I informed the desk clerk that I came to see Mr.\nJonas Pomatitis, the chief of the police headquarters, within two seconds the assistant of the\npolice, chief of police of Mr. Pomatitis came out and asked me my business, and I told him.\nHe went back in; and came out and regretted that Mr. Pomatitis does not have the\nopportunity to come and speak to me. But he'll do everything he can, but he thinks 1t may be\ntoo late. And that's exactly what it was. It was too late. On the way back, we were stopped\nagain by Lithuanian partisans, who were picking up Jews from all over.\nIt was still permitted for Jews to walk on the street, but you had to have your star already. Or\nmaybe by then it was not. I don't remember. But it wasn't hard for a Lithuanian to know who\nis a Jew in Kovno. They looked at the at the little button of my friend, and they pushed him\naway; and they took me to the prison, to the yellow prison, which was nearby. They kept me\nthere for several hours. And then, with a group of hundreds of other Jews, they took me on\nthe mountains in a former Russian caserne, a military unit. And they made me sort clothing.\nAnd when the day was over, they sent me back in Kovno. Then the decree came out that all\nJews should go in in ghetto; and I made arrangements with my family to go to the ghetto.\nSince we had -- didn't have anything to transfer, it was for easier for us just to go Kovno to\nthe apartment of my sister. She lived in ghetto in, in Slobodka, where it was supposed to be.\nThe street she lived was supposed to be part of the ghetto. Before we did that, I decided to go\n** Help (Yiddish).\nto my former apartment and see if there was anything I could recuperate. The superintendent\nof the building was a Russian, a old Russian with a big beard. Nobody persecuted Poles. The\nLithuanian had a anger against Poles because of the war between them for so many years.\nBut the Russian were, were kept neutral. Nobody -- the old ones, and not new Russians.\nThey were regular Lithuanian citizens. When I walked in in that apartment, a rifle was\nhanging on the wall. And he explained me, \"You see, I can easily take down the rifle and\nshoot you dead. But I'm not going to do it.\" He returned to me a pair of shoes and some\nunderwear, and a loaf of bread. Because I was extremely well-to-do, and because my friend\nwas a former Polish immigrant, he arranged for me to buy from Vilna the most luxury Polish\nfurniture that only nobility could afford to have it -- or multi-millionaires. It was called\ntonnette (ph) manufacturing. So he became the possessor of all the luxury, with everything I\nhad. And after a few days, we moved into the ghetto. By then, my sister's apartment where\nshe lived was not any more designated to the ghetto, and we had to move in somewhere else.\nAnd since every Jew got something, so my family got also some kind of a location together\nwith other Jews. But in the meantime, we were in ghetto. The ghetto was not completely\nclosed up by then. But Jews were constantly moving in. The German authorities gave us, I\nthink, until August 15th to close in the ghetto, where no more, no, no Jews would be in\nKovno ghetto.\nIt should be in Kovno. Free should move in in the ghetto. I had a dear Lithuanian friend, a\nChris, a Christian Lithuanian friend -- also a former assistant of mine -- by the name of\nKostas (ph). And while I was preparing myself, I was not prepared that Stal-- Hitler will\nattack Stalin and overnight we will be finished. We were prepared that the Russians will take\nover Lithuania and stay aside watching Hitler fighting with England and, and France, and\nnothing will happen in Lithuania. And since the Germans -- the Russians -- might will take\nover my country, I was prepared with my, with my wealth that I could live for a thousand\nyears by having packages of my properties in different houses of different friends, Jewish\nand non-Jewish. Whoever was my friends, I supported some of those families for a couple\nyears, in order for them to -- while they are keeping my properties. Because I figured out\nexactly and precisely, if anything should happen except the war between Hitler and Stalin, I\nwould have enough to live for myself and for all the dozens of families who had my\nproperties. When I say \"myself,\" it's not \u201cT\u2019 personally. It's the five families of my, of my\nsisters. And that could have happened. I left with Kostas a box of British gold pens to be put\nin in fountain pens. In that time, there was no ball-points. It was only -- no ball-points. It was\nonly pencils and pens. I had a box about that big. In that box was a hundred boxes of a\nhundred pen in each box. If that property would have been converted successfully, at the\ntime of the transfer from Russian might to German might to the private -- might, it would\nhave been worth millions. Because nobody could have refused a gold pen to put in in their\nfountain pen, to continue be able to write. I left a whole box of that with Kostas. And when I\ncame, before I got into the ghetto, to pick up from him -- I had dinner with him, and at dinner\nthey served me with a broken fork and I left. I took a droska\u2019\u2019 back and a droska forth. If I\nwould have been caught riding a droska, I would have been shot on the premises. But I did. I\nfelt I had to do it, because by going in 1n the ghetto I thought I would be able to help myself\nsurvive for a long time with that, with that pens. You know what I'm talking about, that pen?\nDo you know what I'm saying?",
        "Q: No. No.",
        "A: No, you don't.",
        "Q: Like a fountain pen?",
        "A: Like a foun-- a pen to be put in, in the fountain pen.",
        "Q: That's right. Right, I understand.",
        "A: The most treasured thing in Lithuania or in Russia was a fountain pen. And the pen, the\nfountain pen, could not function without that pen. I came back to the ghetto. I took in with,\nwith the, with the properties. And I immediately, the next day -- but immediately the next\nday. Most of the Jewish were permitted to come into the ghetto with all their properties, with\nthe furniture. Some of them hired transportation -- horse and buggies -- and came into the\nghetto with everything they had because the Nazis knew that everything the Jewish would\nbring 1n in the ghetto, they'll get it later. It was no problem. The Jewish were not running\nfrom them anywhere. But I came in with nothing, with five mouths. And the first meal you\nmay manage, the second and the third. What you do with the fourth meal? So the following\nday, I immediately walked around the streets, where most of the people -- who had\neverything they needed for the first three, four weeks -- they're hiding, in order not to be\ncaptured to be taken to work. Because there's no guarantee that you'll come back. I was\nwalking around looking to be captured, to be taken to work, because that was the only\nopportunity, by being at work outside the Kovno ghetto, that I may have somehow a\npossibility to have some kind of food to survive and to bring to my family. That was my\nmotivation. A young member of the, of the same apartment where I lived -- there were\nseveral families in one room apartment. I think a young couple. And he followed my\nfootsteps, and he went with me. After walking for 10, 15 minutes, we naturally were\ncaptured by Lithuanian guards. One important factor I forgot to tell you. Can I put it in now?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: At a time a when Jewish were still walking back and forth from Kovno ghetto, from Kovno\n*\u00b0 Horse-drawn buggy. This could be a from a variety of languages: Russian, Polish, or\nGerman.\nto the ghetto, to, to pick up their things and to bring, I decided one day also to go to Kovno.\nMaybe I would visit Jonas Petronis, my other Christian real friend, who offered me I should\nhelp in the first place. And by then he had a retail book shop in Kovno. I thought I would\nvisit him and take up a couple matters with him to discuss. There was a bridge between\nKovno and Slobodka. And when I came near the bridge from the Slobod-- from the ghetto\nside, from the Slobodka side to go to Kovno, there was a Lithuanian untfor-- a Lithuanian\nguard with a rifle standing there. I didn't know who it was. I know him standing there, but I\ndidn't know who it was. When I came closer, he captured me. He was the son, the Yiddish-\nspeaking son, of the Lithuanian superintendent in the building where the family for whom I\nworked had purchased with the help of an American brother of the lady, a multi-millionaire,\nMr. Israel Matz (ph). So his father was the superintendent in the building; and he was the son\nof the superintendent -- who spoke Yiddish as good as I, or more better.\nAnd he captured me. And he shouted to call the guard from the other side. And who was the\nguard on the other side? His older brother, who was my best friend while, while , while we\nwere, we were on the, on the free side. And both of them decided in my presence, they were\ndebating should they knock me off, throw me in the river, not knock me off. And both of\nthem decided to let me go back to Kovno ghetto. So with that, I, I survived the first incident\nof destruction. Or, or that wasn't the first incident, but I survived that incident, too. The next\nmorning, I went off with my friend to go to look for work and I was captured. We were taken\nto shant-- to the military casernes which was a tremendous distant. We walked. When we\narrived there, we were half-dead. It was about three, four hundred people altogether. My\nfriend and I was taken to a huge military barrack home. We were given a, a emer --a pail --\nand a brush, and we, we were taken to this to the water foun-- sink. And we were told to take\nwater, and lay down and scrub the floor. So we did. We did. We scrubbed the floor until our\nknees were swollen and bloody. The Lithuanian, the Lithuanian murderous partisan who was\nin charge of us, every three or four hours came in to watch us. In the meantime, he murdered\nup -- he and his friends murdered up half of the Jewish over there because the Jewish didn't\nrealize. They mistakenly believed that they are still dealing with human beings, and tried to\npersuade them not to have them work so hard. And the slightest request of resentment or\nopposition to the hard work, they immediately took them out and murdered them. I didn't\nhave that case. I laid down on my knees, and I rubbed and scrubbed and rubbed and\nscrubbed. And the young man who was with me did exactly the same thing. That affected so\nmuch the murderous Christian Lithuanian guard that he himself run around to the Lithuanian\nhouses and begged food from them, got food from them, came in and throw it on the floor\nfor us to eat. When we were finished with that, five o'clock we were lined up and we arrived\nback in ghetto. It just so happened that the houses we got, they are the territory, the\nneighborhood of the poorest non-sufficient Jewish, who are worth any, nothing to the, to the\nJewish administration anyhow. But value nothing. And that's where we got the houses. So\nthere was a long desert to walk, a desert area, a sandy area, to walk to our quarters. Quiet\n* Pail (Yiddish).\nwalk. We were half-dead already, by the way, while we're arriving. When we arrived at the\ngate, there was already a organized a Ghettowache~ who were checking the gates for the\nJewish who came in. And there was a organized Jewish police community guards, who were\nguarding on the other side, on the inside of the Ghettowache. The cooperation between the\nmurderous guards and the Jewish guards after a while became pretty, pretty decent, pretty\ntolerant after a while. The rule had came out already then by the chief Gestapo commander\nof the ghetto that every Jew who meets a German executive -- civilian or military -- has to\nbow and take off the hat.\nWhen we walked in the Ghettowache, we were told to be careful. If we will meet a German,\nwe should bow and take off our hats if we had. We didn't have hats then. So we're walking\nhalfway. We are starving. And a Jew was not supposed to walk on the sidewalk, so we didn't\nwalk on the sidewalk in the first place. And we were walking already in the desert area when\nsuddenly, from a corner street, two guards, two armed German military men came out\nwalking towards us. When we came close enough to them, we bowed. And they immediately\ntook down their rifles to shoot at us. And I immediately figured out what's going on, what\ntheir thought was. If I would turn around and run back, they would shoot us right away\nbecause they would understand that I'm running away. There's no way how I could run\naway. So I immediately start running backwards, for them to know that my intentions are\ngood, and the other man followed me. After walking backwards 10, 15 steps and we came to\ntheir presence, we bowed very deep. And they laughed and walked away. And then, after a\nwhile, we came home and relaxed and, and had a little to eat. I think the guards -- the\nLithuanian, whom, for whom we worked -- gave us some food to take along with us. And\nthis way, every day I was going out, without waiting for anybody to line up and without\nwaiting to be captured. That young man and I were walking out every morning, and we were\nwaiting to be to be, we were looking for the opportunity to be caught and be taken outside\nthe ghetto where, where eventually we would have had something to eat. The first day, I was\ntaken to a German military unit, to the PX canteen, to wash the floors there and to help put\nthe merchandise on the shelves. When we arrived there, the manager of the canteen -- the\nGerman officer, the Christian German-speaking officer in charge of the canteen -- took the\ntwo of us in the canteen room. The canteen room was a little like a room as, as, as big as that\ncorer there. He put the pail of water in the front of the door, so when somebody would try\nto get in they would have to move the pail of water or, or know that it's something there. He\nwas able to see who would come in. If it's something that he's afraid of, he would open the\ndoor right away. And if it was somebody not important, he would tell them that the floor is\nwet. And immediately gave us food to eat, and told us if anything will try to get in in the\ndoor and he will tell us to remove the pail, we should put the food in a corner nobody, not,\nnot to be seen. And after eating, we cleaned up everything exactly and precisely, and he\ninvited us for a few more days to come.\n*\u00b0 Ghetto watch (German).\nAnd I had a beautiful, comfortable existence for my family and for other people after, for a\nfew days. Then that was over. And I started again, and, and after three, four days being in\nbad areas where I had to come back with almost nothing to eat, I lined to work for the Third\nPolice Brigade in the center of the most luxury area in, in Kovno. And I was working in the\nkitchen peeling potatoes, and, and, and doing all kind of manual work. And I had enough to\nfood to, to eat, and I had enough food to bring for the family and for other people. By then, it\nmust have been already mid, mid, mid, mid -- by end of August, where everything settled in.\nIn the early stages, where it was still permitted to go outside of the ghetto, a great deal of\nJewish young men from Slobodka ghetto -- it was easy to go to Jonava because the highway\nwas there. They're running out every morning to go and get some food. Jordan (ph), the chief\nmurderer of the Gestapo, was waiting for them right by the end of the trip and murdered\nthem all. That was going on for three, four days, until some goyim\u201d\u2019 -- decent goyim -- were\nable to come and to tell the Jewish not to go there, because they lined them up and they\nmurdered them on the spot. I was approached several times by very good friends of mine to\ngo with them and buy food. I didn't had any money or any clothing. Immediately thereafter\nthe creation of the ghetto, clothing was the commodity to exchange. I didn't had any. What\nmy superintendent returned to me was not enough for anything -- just a pair of shoes and a\npair of socks, and some underwear. So I had no reason to go, and that's why I survived this\nmurderous onslaught. When I lined up in the, in the Third Police Precinct, I think by reading\nthe other memories I know that it was Captain Tornbaum\u201d\u2019 who was in charge. After three,\nfour days working there, the, the, the chief himself, the chef himself, for whom we were\nactually working and giving us instructions, didn't bother with us one day or another. He\ngave us the instructions; we did them. He gave us to eat, and, and he had nothing to do with\nus one way or another. But one day, some more soldiers came to us, took one other man and\nme on a, on a, on a step on a attic in, in one of the houses, and took us over to a corner where\ntwo huge sacks of sugar was standing.\nHe instructed us to take the sacks, to bring them to the kitchen. I immediately came over to\nthe sack and started to grab it, and grabbed and grabbed and grabbed, and I couldn't even get\nnear the sack. And the other guy started to argue with him. It's too heavy for him. So he told\nme, \"Stay here.\" He walked over to him, slapped him around several times, and he grabbed\nthe sack and run down like, like, like anything, came back with him upstairs, dragged my\nsack and they came down. Because that that, that soldier realized that I couldn't even , even,\neven, even wrap around the sack. And that was the end of the incident. After a while, it\norganized work brigades for the Jewish to go to the outside of the ghetto working. The best\nunits were in the area where I was working, because there were a lot of, the complete\npopulation was filled up with Lithuanians. They immediately took over the luxury\n\u00b0\u00b0 Gentiles (Yiddish).\n\u201c7 Captain Alfred Tornbaum\napartments from the Jews. And they immediately started to peddle with the Jewish, bartering\nfood for clothing. And the Germans there, after, after a while getting used to the way of their\nslaves, probably keep their eye closed or didn't bother or whatever it is. It was going on a, a\nbusiness like a regular business. Clothing became a very expensive commodity to take out\nfrom Kovno ghetto. But the black marketeers, to them bring in food was not such a big thing.\nTo them was important to buy expensive food -- like saccharine. You know what saccharine\nis? Sweeteners. Or sugar or fat or butter. And that, at one time or another, it was pretty\ncomfortable to get in, bring it in. But after a while, it became extremely, extremely\ndangerous to bring in food of any value. And in that time, the German Nazis put up a\nLithuanian Wachmeister~> who was a tall, slim person. By five o'clock in the afternoon, the\nstreet to enter Kovno ghetto was lined up with thirty-five thousand Jews -- everyone broken\ndown by their brigades, lined up five in a row to march in to the ghetto after a day's work.\nThat Wachmeister was purposely hired to catch the black marketeers. I had a contract in the\nwork brigade, in that time, with a strong Jewish, physically strong Jew by the name of\nChaimke Lipman (ph).\nHe was extremely strong, powerful man. I was buying a sack of potatoes, because a sack of\npotatoes was a tool for me to bring in in Kovno ghetto. And at the entrance , by then a lot of\npeople who were brought in some food were already starving. So by then it was already\nseven, eight months, or five, stx months in the existence of the ghetto. And things changed\ndramatically. And the el-- the elderly people who couldn't go out to work were giving their\nclothes to the black marketeers to bring, to bring in food for them they to have something to\neat. And that Wachmeister had a certain morality in his own frame of mind. If you come in\neven with a big sack of potatoes, it had no monetary value at all. He didn't bother you. If you\nhad the biggest loaf of bread on you, he didn't bother you. If you had barley or any other, or\nany other of the vegetables, or cucumbers, or any other of those fruits or vegetables, it had no\nvalue. He didn't bother you. But he was looking for sugar, butter, saccharine and other, and\nchocolate, and for schnapps -- any other expensive things. So I had a contract with Chaimke\nLipschitz (ph). I was buying a big sack of potatoes. I couldn't even move the sack from the,\nfrom the, from the spot where I bought it. Chaimke, it was after the line-up to go to work,\nChaimke was picking up my sack of potatoes, carried all the five, six miles, carried in the\nghetto. I had my niece waiting with a little buggy, with a little dolly -- and dropped it in the\ndolly. I didn't have much farth-- very far to go with this sack of potatoes because on both\nsides of the ghetto, inside of the ghetto and after the gate, after Jewish walked in there were\ntwo lines of Jewish stretched out with their hands to beg. Among them was the famous\nwriter, Joseph Garr (ph). Within seconds, half of my sack of potatoes was emptied out.\nBecause it was my human duty to give it to them. And the rest of it was easy to haul with a\nlittle more simply, with a little wagon, to my house. And there my neighbors got, and my\nfamily got. I, on the other hand, was carrying a little box of a thousand boxes of saccharine.\nAnd there was five hundred saccharine in each box. That product, brought in in ghetto, was\n*\u00b0 Watchmaster (German).\nconverted to millions, probably, in that time. You could have gotten twenty-five suits. You\ncould have gotten gold and diamonds, all for that little box. So I was carried this -- the box\nwas not as long as these, as light as this, but only that thin. So I was carrying under my arm,\nand dancing like a prima donna with that little box. Except one thing. You do realize that if I\nwere caught with that little box getting in the gate, I would have been brutally beaten up and\nshot right there on the premises. And Chaimke Lipman (ph) would have had no punishment\nat all for bringing in my sack of potatoes, because they saw his sack of potatoes.",
        "Q: What happened,",
        "A: I think I would like to rest for a few minutes. Can we?",
        "Q: Sure. We can take a break. Help yourself to some water.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: Ok, we're back on. We're being taped again. We were, we were with when you're coming\nback into the ghetto.",
        "A: One morning, I went out again to be, to be wait, to look for the opportunity to be captured\nand taken to units outside the ghetto that I would be able to bring in some food. I was\ncaptured soon enough. I was taken inside the ghetto to the new ghetto Kommandantur,\nwhere there were a group of barracks -- seven, eight single-story houses. And it happened to\nbe isolated away from the residents of the ghetto. The only next building closest was the\nJewish police precinct. I was taken to the Kommandantur. A Jewish woman by the name of\nLuba, who was working there already, took me to the barn, pointed her finger to a big shovel\nand a broom and an axe and a saw to saw woods, and told me to clean the yard. Then told\nme to clean the toilets. When I was finished with that, I was sawing the woods, and when I\nwas finished with sawing the woods, I was chopping the woods. Luba was the maid for the\nCommandant. The new Commandant was by the name of Ritter. He was there every second\nmorning. He arrived every second morning, one o'clock in the afternoon, stayed there for, for\nthe next, one afternoon, one o'clock in the afternoon. Stayed there until the next and the\nfollowing afternoon, for two afternoons. And one o'clock arrived, his former, his friend\nTschich, who was on duty as Commandant -- both of them, they're former police officers in\nVienna. And while I worked the first day and cleaned the toilets and cleaned out everything -\n- the street, the, the, the, the yard. I realized that thanks to Luba and Esther, the two main\nmaids of the Kommandantur, I will have the opportunity if nothing else will happen to feed\nmy family and several other families. Because this is the outlet that I have the opportunity to\nget food. After a while, I trained myself to be so fast with all the other work that I was\nthrough by half day; and the rest of the half day, I was polishing the boots and the belt\nbuckles and the belts of the soldiers. The Ghettowache contained of about seven, eight\nindividual story combined barracks with two rooms with one entrance. And all entrances\nwas on one side.\nOn the other side was the living room, with a window in the living room but no door to get\nin. After a short period of time, under Luba's and Esther's influence, the Commandant\ninstructed me to bring in all the confis-- almost all the confiscated food that was taken away\nfrom the Jewish in the evening when they came in from the work on the outside brigade,\nworking brigades. And it was all lined up in my hands to take care of and being in charge of\nseparating, to bring in almost all the food in the bedroom of the Commandant Ritter. The\nJewish police precinct was only a short distance away. The Chief of Third Jewish Police\nPrecinct was a certain Kamse (ph), or Tarsis (ph) -- I don't remember. A former good friend\nof mine from the wars, from the days before the war. I had made arrangements with him. He\nwas sending twenty to twenty-four policemen, lined up behind the window of the, of the\nbedroom of the Commandant. I was opening the window, putting up the window or opening\nit, and hand over the first package to the first policeman who was standing behind the\nwindow. He turned and gave it to the next, until it land up in the precinct. And there, the\nCommandant was calling in, the Chief of Police called in the victims from whom the\nmerchandise was taken away and returned to them. After a while, Commandant Ritter\ninstructed me to go to the Chief of Police and tell him that the Jewish who are coming in\nfrom the outside brigade should sew in initials on their bags, on their shopping bags, which\nwas confiscated. So they should be able to get in return their own properties. All, all the\nGestapo used to come and pick up some food for themselves from, from Kovno. They were\ncoming in a small black Volkswagen. Luba 1s the one who prepared everything for them.\nAlso, the food for the Ghettowache -- primarily, the Commandant -- was cooked with the\nconfiscated food. After a while -- but, but after a while, what's going on was while I was\nreturning the food to the Jews, the Lithuanian Ghettowache started to mumble that they don't\nhave enough food. And where would they have enough food? Because some of the food was\nreturned to the victims, and it wasn't enough to cook for them, so they had to bring in foods\nfor themselves. The Wache was hanging on, the Lithuanian and the German Ghettowache\nwas hanging on the premises because the duty around the fences was only for two hours.\nAfter the two hours, they were free for four hours. They couldn't possibly go home and then\ncome back in the four hours, or three hours, or two and two -- I just don't remember exactly.\nIt was not enough time for them to go home and then come back on duty. So they were\nlaying around in the outer barracks recuperating and resting and sewing their stockings, and\ndo any of the other things there necessary while they were waiting to go back on duty. In\norder to prevent any of the guards -- the Jewish or the German -- or any outside German who\nwould come into the ghetto to catch what I'm doing. Because if it would have been\ndiscovered what I'm doing, I would have been the second to be shot. Commandant Ritter\nwould have been the first to be shot. For the period of the time when I was bringing in the\nfood in his bedroom from the, from the barns opposite, he lined them all up in front on the\ngarden, on the lawn up front, and personally conducted with all of them physical exer-\nexercise. Up and down, and down and up, and up and down, and down and up. Some of\nthem were getting so exhausted that they couldn't move every time. And the only time when\nI walked around with my big broom and shovel twice around the yard, that was the signal to\nhim that it's all over, and he released them. That was going on for two days. After that\nTschich came, and he was for two days. Although Tschich, Commandant Tschich, never\nharmed me at all -- he was rather decent to me -- but he told me from the first day that if he,\nif he will ever catch me returning anything to the, of the confiscated food to the Jews, he will\nshot me right there and then. And I followed his rule. He never caught me returning anything\nand everything. When I was finished with the actual duty of helping in the kitchen and\npeeling potatoes and cleaning the latrines, I was shining the buckles and the boots. You can\nbe assured that the most beautiful polished boots in the whole world was Commandant\nRitter's. And his buckle -- so was his buckle. I had invented a special invention. I took a\nglass, a empty glass. And with the back side of the glass I rubbed in the polish on the boot\nand the buckle, let it dry out for awhile. And then, when the, with the, with the, with bottom\nside of the glass I circular rubbed all away. And I'm not sure that if anybody in the world\nwould have had such a beautiful shoes. After a while -- I think it was about four or five\nmonths -- and Ritter and Tschich, the whole unit -- the whole unit moved away. And a new\nunit came in. And the commandant of that new unit was a German by the name of Schultz.\nHe did not instruct me to repeat the same things what I did with Commander Ritter, except\nhe instructed me something else. At that time, the Gestapo permitted to form a Volkskiiche~\u201d\n-- a kitchen to give the starving Jews, those that were starving, to give soup during the day\nfree of charge. And that volksktiche needed food to cook. And there was a former Hebrew\nteacher, I think by the name of Schulgasser (ph), who would come, who was coming with a\nhorse and buggy. And he fill down, the horse, I fill down for him the horse and buggy with\nthe food, and they took away. After a short period of time, I am sure that there was -- again,\nunder the influence of Luba and Esther -- he, he instructed me to go to the Chief of the Third\nPrecinct, Police Precinct, Mr. Tomason (ph), and tell him he should arrange that Schulgasser\nshould have a second horse and buggy similar to the first horse. If the first horse was a white\nhorse, so the second one should be a white horse. And stay a distant away. And when he was\nfilled up with the first one and the first one came out from the territory of the Ghettowache\nterritory, to bring in the second one and filling in the second one. Schultz, at the time when it\nbecame already very, very difficult, and at a time when it was known that\nObersturmbannfiihrer Goecke\u201d\u2019 is coming to liquidate the Kovno ghetto -- and Goecke was\nknown by all Jews that he was the liquidator. He started from the furthest part in Russia, and\nwhen the German armies were stepping back toward Germany, he was liquidating ghetto\nafter ghetto after ghetto. At the time it was known that Goecke is coming with units of\nliquidating the Kovno ghetto, I was helping sew a rucksack for the Commandant Schultz to\nput in Luba's blonde four, five years old boy and carry him over through the gates at night\nwith the flashlight of the signals. They had flashlights with three different colors, that there\nwas a signal, a specia-- a separate signal that the commandant is going, to better to go climb\nthrough the ghetto and take the baby in the village, where one of the Lithuanian guards --\nthey are by then already in the beginning of '44, 1944, even some of the worst murde--\nLithuanian murderers became already friendly with Jews because they were looking already\nfor a ticket. So one of the Lithuanians offered to survive and Luba's son, and the\nCommandant Schultz carried over personally the son to the Lithuanian's house.\nAfter a short period of time, the Ghettowache disappeared, and a new Ghettowache arrived.\nAnd they didn't have anymore the quarters in Kovno ghetto. They had the quarters already in\n*\u2019 Common kitchen (German).\n*\u00b0 Lieutenant Colonel (German); Wilhelm Goecke\na school, in a former school outside the Kovno ghetto which is about 15, 20 minutes by, by\ncar away from the ghetto. There I was again called in to be the slave of the, of the\nGhettowache kitchen. It was the unit of Obersturmbannfuthrer Goethe -- Goecke. It was the\nunit of the Obersturmbannfthrer Goecke, who arrived for the process of liquidating the\nKovno ghetto. He immediately converted the Kovno ghetto to a Kon, to a\nKonzentrationslager\u2019\u2019 Kaunas. And the restrictions became extremely severe for the Jews in\nevery level. I and all the other slaves for the Ghettowache were immediately taken away\nfrom the ghetto, and they built special bungalows, special quarters, upstairs of this of this\nschool for us to be there and to stay there and not to go back to the ghetto. By then it was a\nbig kitchen with maybe several hundred SS guards, and it required more people to work.\nAnd quite a few Jews managed to get themselves in the brigade. And while they were there,\nthey were locked in together with me, and they became permanent laborers, slave laborers,\nfor the Ghettowache. The, the chef of the kitchen was Ober, or Unter, or Oberscharfiihrer*\u201d\nBlaufuchs. He was a, a, a, a, they had -- he was not the chef. He was the head of the kitchen.\nThe chef was somebody else. And he was the direct boss of Luba and Esther, and direct my\nboss. I continued with the same duties of cleaning the toilets, cleaning the rooms, peeling\npotatoes, peeling beans for the kitchen, and all other manual labor work. In addition to that,\nWagner was one of the, of the PX managers. And he had a bicycle, and he constantly\ninstructed me to clean his bicycles. The physical appearance of the location was as\nfollowing: a small walking gate was from the main street.\nWell, about 15 blocks further was the Ghettowache, the ghetto. And it was the low, lower\ngate in the ghetto. The ghetto had two entrances. By then, they built a second entrance which\nwas Closer to the school where the Ghettowache was located. And there, there was a constant\nguard standing with a rifle on the sidewalk of the, of the walking entrance. And any time\nGoecke was about to arrive about one o'clock in the afternoon, that guard was giving signals\nthat Goecke is arriving. And with those signals, even high ranking officers of the SS\nattempted, if they could, to shy away from the premises, because nobody wanted to stumble\ninto Goecke. The only person who had a strong influence on him in a relationship to the, to\nthe, to the dining room was Unter-- Oberscharftthrer Blaufuchs, the head of the kitchen,\nbecause he was putting food in his stomach. I, by habit, didn't want to get rich. I couldn't get\nanymore to my family at all. I couldn't do anything. I didn't want to go out and, and, and do\nbusiness on the black market. As several Jews, from time to time -- arranged by the admin--\nJewish Judenrat\u2122 -- they're coming to the Wache to, to beg and to buy themselves food.\nBecause every outside work brigade had the opportunity to buy food, except the airport. And\na lot of people who worked on the airport get passes to go to the other work brigades, in\norder to be able to get themselves food; because the airport slave labor was the real slave\nlabor. And the whole existence of the ghetto depended on the airports. If the general in\n*' Concentration camp (German).\n* Sergeant (German).\n* Jewish Council (German).\ncharge of the airports would decided to liquidate the airports brigade, probably the ghetto\nwould have been liquidated immediately. So it was very important for the Judenrat to have\nthe, the, the Flug-- the Fliighafen\u201d* functioning. One time somebody asked me to buy\nmedicine for a child. I just don't remember what it was. And I walked out outside of the\ngates, outside of the premises, in the next gentile house, Christian house, where everybody\nwas communicating there constantly except I. I never did, but to do somebody a very\nimportant favor, I did walk out. The premises of the, of the, of the, of the school was that on\nthe front on the main street was the walking entrance, but on the side street was the driving\nentrance. And the gate was constantly open to driving entrance, because there was a danger\nthe Goecke may drive 1n any time. And how would it be that gate is closed, and he had to\nbeep, blow the horn to be let in? So it was constantly open.\nI walked out to that house next to, close enough to the Ghettowache, and discussed with the\nfarmer, with the gentile family about the question I was, I came to ask. And I, I was about\nready to go back, and two Lithuanian policemen arrived. And one of them sat down to write\nthe protocol to take me to the Gestapo where I would have been immediately shot because\nthey got a bonus for bringing me there. And the other was walking around from door, from\nthe door to the middle of the room, while the first one was writing the protocol. I was\nstanding as shivering like, like, like, like hell for a few seconds, and then it dawned on me,\n\"What am I shivering?\" I looked around, and I saw that the door was a push-out from the\noutside. I waited on the next turn when the guard, the policeman, was coming closer to the\ninside. And I run to the door. I pushed with my foot. I start running. They shoot at me, but\nthey didn't got me. And I was immediately, through the open wide gate, in on the premises, I\nimmediately came to Luba. She immediately informed Oberscharfthrer Blaufuchs and he\nwithin seconds took me, put me upstairs, put a guard over there. And a few minutes later, the\ntwo Lithuanian came to look for me, and he chased them out. His chasing them out was it\nwas only a momentary victory, a moment, a momen-- a momentarily victory. The higher\npowers over him were of the Gestapo. And those two Lithuanian policeman were, were the\nemployees of the Gestapo. It was their business to capture the Jewish on the outside so they\ncould have reported to the Gestapo and get, and Gestapo could have come and find me there.\nAnd Obersturmbann-- Ober, Oberscharfthrer Blaufuchs could not have helped a bit in that\ncase. But within seconds, he lined up a closed truck, got two guards shipped out with me\ninside, took me to the ghetto. And in the ghetto, where will they find me? The next day, I\ncame back to work. At one time I was called in, in, in, in, in Blaufuchs's apartment to clean\nhis apartment, because his wife was coming to visit him. And while I was cleaning the floor\nand everything else, she arrived. And when she arrived, he hardly kissed her and introduced\nher to me and said, \"David, du kannst ausstrecken deine Hand zu meiner Frau.\"\u201d? Tan\nshake hands with his Frau. And I shook hands with her. My job was finished then, and, and,\nand I disappeared.\n** Airport (German).\n> \"David, you can shake hands with my wife.\" (German)\nThe, the, the liquidation of the Kovno ghetto got closer and closer and closer by the day. It\nwas going on by the day. It took probably about five, six months from the time Goecke\narrived until he started to liquidate. All that depended on the front. If the front got closer,\nthen he liquidated faster. In the meantime, he started to organize the Konzentrationslager\nKovno. In the meantime, he had the Kinder\u201d\u2019 and the woman and the old people liquidation,\nwhere all the children and all the old people were in one day lined up and taken to be\ndestroyed. In that action, my little seven years old nephew and my almost 75 years old\nmother was taken out. They told me afterwards. It's a German Wachmeister, one of the units.\nWhen he came back, cried when he told me in torturous murder, how they destroyed the\npeople, the old people. Mothers, mothers, mothers, mothers were, were, were, were falling,\nkneeling for them, kissing their feet, not to take their child. So they killed the mother with\nthe child. They were taking children. The main action of liquidating, it was in the front of the\nthree big brick buildings. They were taking children, the, the, the Ukrainian and Lithuanian\nmurderers were going up to the third floor. It was a three story building. They were finding\nchildren on the top floor, and dropping them down through the window to the Ukrainian or\nLithuanian guard who was standing downstairs on the street. And he picked them up and\nknocked his head on the wall, choking up, until the child was dead. The German\nWachmeister who told me the brutality told me how a woman was find, a elderly woman\nwas find in a toilet. The toilets were wooden house, wooden bungalows-like. And she was\nhiding, and it was almost all over. And she mistakenly stuck out her head to see if it 1s all\nover and the Gestapo man saw her. They were walking with big sticks exactly for that\npurpose, with wide, with wide handles. My stick doesn't have a wide handle, but their stick\nhad special wide curves in order to grab a, a person's neck and pull them like that. So the\nWachmeister cried for me, in telling me how brutally elderly woman was dragged with the\nstick on the sidewalk until she was dead before she was thrown in the truck. When I came\nback after, when they started to liquidate the ghetto and brought me back in the ghetto, my\nsister told me that that old lady was my mother. That's the way she was, she was taken out.\nAt the start of the liquidation of Kovno ghetto, the last few days Goecke, personally, and,\nand, and Berman (ph) or Breller (ph), his assistant -- I don't really remember him. In the\nbook their whole names, but it's not important for us. They, personally, they're driving\naround the areas where groups of young people they're trying to escape. Everybody knew it's\nthe end. And they caught them and shot them on the streets, on the field -- wherever they\ncaught them -- without any mercy. Immediately, they murdered them. I was brought in in\nKovno ghetto, back in KZ Kovno, back to be prepared for the liquidation. But then they sent\nin a new group of guards, and that new group of guards needed service. They needed to\nprepare straw, straw mattresses for them. And I was called in with the other former workers\n\u00b0\u00b0 Children (German).\nto prepare the sacks for them. In those days they were building -- there was a barn where the\nwood was located, and all the tools. It was old rotten wood. They were building new\nbarracks up to the last minute to prevent the Jewish to go through the, to cut through, dig out\nand, and -- because the wood was all then rotten, to, to break it out and go, and go through.\nSo I, I, I, I, with the five, six other Jewish workers there, practically the last couple days\nbefore the liquidation of our camp, attempted to do that. We attempted to dig out in the side\nthat was still rotten. You pull it out from under the earth. You dug out the earth. And there\nwas a religious Jew by the name of Portnoy (ph). He had already his family outside, and he\nhad prepared his place for himself outside. And when he noticed that, he came to the kitchen\nand informed on us. So you should see this scene, how the cook, and the assistant cook, and\nWagner and, and, and, and Blaufuchs all came out to help us dig back in, so those who\nwould see and kill us immediately they should not be able to see anything that were not\nsmooth. It was not smooth. There was a guard, Schmittus (ph). One of the guards was a man\nby the name of Schmittus. I was told that he was a Ger\u2014a, a, a, Ger, a Volksdeutsche\u2019\u2019 in\nBudapest. You know what a Volksdeutsche, Volksdeutsche is? And the Nazis recognized\nVolksdeutsche as Deutsche\u2019.\nSome of the Volksdeutsche were the worst murderers, and some of them were decent people\n-- like all people are bad and good, except the good were in a very small minority. Probably\namongst 10 thousands, you could have find one or two decent people. Schmittus tried, made\nso many efforts to help me. Schmittus was constantly arguing with Blaufuchs against the\ntreatment of, the bad treatment of the Jews. But he was arguing with the wrong person,\nbecause Blaufuchs didn't have any better, any other opinion than he had. The day before we\nwere liqui-- before we were taken back to Kovno ghetto, and few days before the total\nliquidation, I was doing my work and Wagner called me over. His bicycle was standing in\nthe front of the entrance to the kitchen. The entrance of the kitchen was here, and the open\ngates to drive in was here. And Goecke, when he was driving in, was driving in to, to the\nother wall, turn around, faced his car to get out, and walked to the kitchen. So Wagner told\nme to clean his bicycle suddenly. It was the hour in the day when nobody would expect\nGoecke to come to the dining room. He had his own headquarters in, in the ghetto, and he\nhad his own headquarters in the Gestapo headquarters. He used to come to that, to the guard\nunit only for dinner, for, for lunch. And it was about 11 o'clock in the morning, or 11:30,\nwhen nobody would ever suspect or dream that he would come. The guard who was\nconstantly stationed on the, on the front of the main street with the sidewalk entrance was a,\na, a, a -- also a Volksdeutsche. A little confused human being, you know, but a very decent\nperson. We taught him that when you see danger -- Goecke, or Gestapo, or any other officer\n-- he should knock on the sidewalk with the rifle and shout twice, \"Yaveh (ph) v'yavo.\"\n*\u2019 Ethnic German (German).\n*> German (German).\n* This phrase (actually pronounced \u201cYa-aleh\u201d v\u2019yavo in Hebrew), meaning \u201cHe\u2019s arising\nand coming,\u201d comes originally from part of a Hebrew prayer. In the ghetto, \u201cya-aleh\u201d\nThat's the Hebrew words: \"He comes, he's here.\"\nAnd when he shout, he couldn't pronounce both words, but \"Yahveh\" he remember very\nwell. But when he shouted, \"Yahveh!\" everything disappeared from the, from the front area.\nThat day he wasn't there. Somebody else -- a stranger who was not under our influence. And\nWagner told me to clean his bicycle. And I removed my beautiful blue jacket with the stars\nof David on the front and the back in order not to make dirty, and I took the bicycle. I was\nwalking with the bicycle from the area where Wagner gave it to me towards the, towards the\nbarn, where I had my tools. And I passed by the area of the open gate and in drives in\nGoecke with a lady. Turns around. Gets out of the car. Walks over to me. Pulls out a gun.\nAnd he was ready to shoot. And I, and I stood up like a military person. I clicked my feet. I\nwas wearing galoshes. In July, I was wearing galoshes. But I made movement like I'm\nclicking my feet, and I shouted loud and clear, \"Obersturmbannfuhrer Goecke! Das ist nicht\nmein Schuld -- mein Schuld, dass ich keine Star of David habe. Der Wagner verlangte ich\nsoll sein Fahrrad saubermachen, (and) um nicht zu verschmutzen die Jacke mit die gelbe\nStern ... hab ich runtergenommen und ich ging mit dem Fahrrad zu der Bahn um meine\nGezeig zu nehmen.\"\u201d\u201d In that moment, he lowered down the revolver. And within, in, in that\nmoment, Blaufuchs was already near him. That's the only person whom he'll listen to.\nWagner was on the other side, and other high ranking SS officers. There was a new man who\ncame a few days ago -- a huge person, a SS officer. He probably was the head of the\ntransportation. And he saw what's going on, and everybody testified on my behalf, that I was\nnot attempting to escape with the bicycle. I was just going to the other area to clean it. It, it\ntook minutes, and Goecke gave a shout to me, \"Verschwinden!\" And I immediately\n\"verschwind.\u201d You know what \u201cverschwind\u201d\u2019 1s -- disappear. And I disappeared. He went to\nhave lunch. He walked out from his lunch. Blaufuchs was right behind him. And he shouted,\n\"Wo ist die Jude mit die blaue Jacke?!\" And I immediately was there standing, like, like,\nlike \"Attention!\" And he delivered this small speech to me, and he explained that the \"Blaue\nJacke ist beschlagnahmt.\"\u201d\u201d It's confiscated. And again shouted to me, \"Andreten! > AndI\nwalked away, and he drove away. And the same day, we were taken back to the ghetto and it\nstarted the liquidation.\nmeant \u201cbigshot\u201d and was used by ghetto inhabitants to announce warnings; for example,\nan approaching German guard.\n* \"Lieutenant Colonel Goecke, it is not my fault, my fault that I have no Star of David. Mr.\nWagner demanded that I clean his bicycle, and so as not to stain the jacket with the yellow\nstar ... I have taken it off and I went to the rail with my stuff.\u201d (German)\n*! \u201cWhere is the Jew with the blue jacket?\u201d (German)\n* \u201cBlue jacket is confiscated.\u201d (German)\n* Attention (German)\nI arrived Saturday night back in Kovno, never to go back to the, to the Ghettowache. I slept\nover the night. I, I had my niece then. My mother and the baby, Alenke was already\nmurdered. By the way, people told me when I arrived in the ghetto that that was the day\nwhen Goecke murdered, caught and murdered four or five group of young people -- a total\nof six, seven people per group. About thirty, forty people were murdered that day. And that's\nwhen they permitted me to be saved from Goecke, in a situation like that. Couldn't happen in\na million years anything like that. And Sunday morning the Wache started already to catch\nus and to put us in a cage. Shortly before I left the Kovno ghetto, two or three weeks before,\nto to and never came to come back to work for the Ghettowache, I noticed that Jewish were\nbuilding near the Kaisergasse (ph), a gate \u2014 a, a, a fence, a fenced a, a, a wire fence, a wire\nbu-- a wire partition like -- four or five times as big as this here, on the field in the ghetto.\nAnd somehow I thought maybe, maybe, maybe that will be to, to drive in Jews before the\nliquidation. Anyhow, Sunday morning the liquidation started, and I was caught by one of the\nnew guards. And -- no, I'm sorry. I was -- I begged my sister to go with me whatever will be\nhappened, and my niece to go with me. But she got permission to go in a bunker which one\nof the most prominent Jewish people build. She was a friend of the man's wife, and they\npermitted her to stay until. And we figured it's only for three or four days, and 1n three or\nfour days Russians were coming. And they permitted my niece, after a while, to going in.\nAnd while I was running to look for directions they had -- Mongrel (ph) was his name --\ncame out from the bunker and invited me, too. I am a, Iam a breathing difficulty.\nI was then, and I am today. So after being there for a couple of seconds, the bunker was built\nfor maybe 12, 14 people. By when I came in -- the last one, I and my niece there was already\n-- | was already the 67th or the 68th. It was burning hot in July. It was the first week in July,\nso how long could I have stayed in that place? After a few seconds, I started to cough and I\ngot out. I forced Dinah, my niece, also to get out. Somehow, she listened to me. And we\nwere captured right away on the street, and put in the enclosed wire fence that was fenced.\nWe were one of the few in the beginning, but as the day progressed, it became thousands of\nthem. People were stepping on each other already. We were laying there for three days and\nthree nights. On the second day, the transportation of the Kovno ghetto took place in three\ngroups. The first group went out Sunday afternoon without any incident. They went out, and\nthey were taken to Germany. The second group was my transportation. But the Jewish that\nthey find on the street, they lined them up and safely under the fence. But they were going\nwith Jewish men, Jewish policemen, from building, house to house, fish out the people in the\nhiding places. And there, the woman were laying nude just in a garden, and the men were\npractically nude, and brought them all to the to the encampment. So from an area that it\ncould house maximum a hundred or 200 people, there were already two-- 3000 people\nconcentrated. And it became a tremendous situation. You had to do your bowel movements\nright there and then on the premises because you couldn't go anywhere. And the stink from\nthe smell from the bowels was not to be believed. I think we were laying there for three, four\ndays or more, because they couldn't get transportation for us to go to the ghetto, to go to the,\nto the train. Anyhow, in those days, Schmittus was crawling from body -- person to person\nover the people to look for \"the David.\" Iam \"the David.\" I am David. And when he find,\n\u201cWho would know is \u2018the David\u2019? Only the few Jews who worked with me knew that they\ncalled \u201cthe David.\u201d There must have been fifty Davids there. Who would know? He finally\nfind me. And when he find me, he told me that I, when, to-- tonight or the next night, they\nwake us all up to march out. And at that time, I should try to be the very last line, and I\ninstructed my niece to be the very one with me. And other people who were near me, I\ninstructed them the same way. He said, by being the very last line, he and Wagner and two\nother additional people will close up the line of guards. They will be the last guards. And as\nsoon as they get out from the ghetto, I should escape.\nHe said naturally I should not get concerned that all four of them will, will kneel and shoot at\nme. But they wouldn't shoot at me. I should keep running. I instructed my sister, my niece to\ndo that, too. I was ready to two eventualities. I wanted to escape anyhow. I was ready, I\nhoped for two things may happen while I'm escaping. Maybe I'll escape and be an escapee;\nor while escaping I'll be shot in the rear. Without pain, I'll be dead. I happened to walk out\nSunday morning in a clean, bright shirt. And while laying the few days 1n the field, I find the\nbrother of my brother-in-law, who happened to have had a brown shirt, a dark shirt. And I\nexchanged with him. I gave him my shirt, and he gave me his shirt. I, I, I had a silly logic\nthat if I'll have to run in the middle of the night, the guards may see my white shirt and shoot\nme. The brown shirt, they will not see, because I planned to run out. I had a German bag, a\nbread bag. It's a linen bread bad by a hanging strap where they were carrying their loaf of\nbread, and I had a razor there and a couple of small things, and that's all. I was ready to\nescape, to be shot. That's all I wanted. I felt I'll never wind up in concentration camp. And I\ninstructed my niece to do that, too. When they marched out, about four o'clock in the, early\nin the morning, I tried to be the last line, and I was about in the last line. I was about the\nclosest to the right side to be able to run in a, in a, in a private house garden. It was through a\nlittle gate. I planned to do that, but I realized that Schmittus was not in the back and he's not\nthe one to decide in the first place where he would stay. And all he did is tried to sell me a\nbill of goods I should try to save myself and believe him. And with that, I may, I may\nsurvive. And that's all that he wanted: to help me to survive. As soon as we walked out,\nChrista Kartigas (ph) took us -- I think 1t was Christa Kartigas. We walked out maybe twenty\nsteps from the ghetto. I saw an open gate, that little pri-- that little gateway to a private\nhouse. You, you know what I mean. I ran in, and I ran through the garden. And a Lithuanian\nwas working in the garden, and he followed me and he caught me. And I loosened myself,\nand he remained with the same jacket that was supposed to be \u201cbeschlagnahmt\u201d and the\nsleeves of the shirt, in his hands. And I was already away from him. And I kept running and\nrunning and running, until I came to a big fence that was \u2014 the, the Lithuanian government\nhad had built up a huge animal, animal in -- animal, animal treatment for -- how do you call\nit? A, a\u2014to, to, to cure animals. Oh, my God. I forgot. I forgot.",
        "Q: Oh, like an animal treatment center.",
        "A: Ok, yeah. And it was a huge tall gate. And I couldn't, I couldn't possibly climb over the -- in\nmy height. It just happened that a pile of garbage was laying right there where I find myself.\nI climbed up on the garbage, climbed over the gate. And halfway on my -- halfway to the\nbuilding, I see there are hundreds of German soldiers. So I ran back, climbed over -- from the\ninside, it was easier to climb because there are the two planks, the bottom plank and the top\nplank. It was easy for me to climb back in, and I continued walking. I walked all day long.\nAnd a tremendous rain storm broke out. And I hid in the corn to hide myself from the rain.\nHow much I can hide myself from the rain, I don't know. But I, I was, I was like a animal,\nreally. My mind was like a animal. And the four guards, when I escaped with -- and, and,\nand when I walked out from the corn, my body was all smeared up in clay. And I, I slept the\nnight over in a, in a, in a, in a forest. And the next morning, I continued. By then I was\nhungry and thirsty, and I was making up my mind which house I should attempt to go in and\nask for something. And I noticed a big looking house, a big building, and I thought maybe,\nmaybe, maybe a owner of property -- they call it pomeshchik,\u201d in that time -- and most of\nthem were Poles. They, they're land owners. The rich land owners were Poles. And the Poles\nwere not so hot with the Lithuanians, and he may have been willing to help me, give me\nsome food. So I started to go to that house, because I thought it's the owner of a rich man,\nbecause it's a bigger house than the average. When I came close enough, I noticed it's the\nNinth Fortification. And I went back, and I started again walking. About noontime, I fall\nasleep -- weak and hungry, and smeared out in clay like, like , like a stray cat. And while I\nfall asleep, I heard voices of children -- Lithuanian voices saying, \"Zydu\u2019\u2019! Zydu! Ectu (ph)\nGestapo!\" -- \"Run to Gestapo!\" So I got up, and I went away. I, I, I, I just didn't had enough\nstrength to continue from hunger and thirst. So I walked in, in a yard of another house. I took\nthe next best house which to walk in, and I walked tn. It just so happened that the house was\nup front, and the barn was all the way in the back. So it took me a distant to go to the barn.\nAnd halfway to the barn, the whole barn was full with German soldiers retreating from the\narmy down the hill. And the proprietor was a old Russian farmer, a gentile, Christian. And\nhe saw me, measured up the situation right there and then, came over towards me and\nembraced me like he was, he caught a new relative who just came to visit him. Pushed me\nout from the area, walked in the house, gave me a piece of bread. And I continued walking.\nI walked for quite a distance. Then I came to a highway where a lot of Lithuanians were\nescaping from the war. The war was coming nearer, closer and closer. And I lined up and I\nand I lined myself up with the horse and buggy of a Lithuanian with a family, and he gave\nme something to eat and let me walk with him. But he told me if the Germans should come\nand look for, he will tell me -- he will tell them -- that Iam a Jew. So after I relaxed and\nthought on this moment for a few minutes, I continued to walk by myself on the upper hill of\n* Landowner (Russian)\n\u00a9 Jew (Lithuanian)\nthe, of the forest-like highway. It was no forest. It was little trees. And towards late at night,\nagain it started to rain, and I was terribly wet. I walked in, in a house. It was a man and two\nwomen -- brother and two sisters. They gave me milk and bread. I, I ate fancy foods all over\nthe world. Nothing tasted as good as that bread and milk. They took me to the barn. They\ndug out a, a wagon full of hay which they had prepared from the field. They put me in the, in\nthe hay, and they covered it back up. I slept half a night, and early in the morning I continued\nto walking. I walked all day, practical all day. Again hungry, without any food. And\nsuddenly I'm facing three roads: one, two, three. And what do I do? Where do you go? So I\npick a grass. You know when you were a child, a grass -- \"You love me, you don't love me.\"\nAnd I pulled the grass, and I designated this one is this grass, this one is this one. And it fall\non the one I went. I went originally to the straight one. And I continued. Late in the evening,\nI came to a house and the woman took me in and told me that her husband is hiding Jews in\nthe forest, and I should. After she gave me to eat, she, she sent me upstairs 1n the attic. And\nthis early in the morning, he came home, he woke me up, and we started to go to the forest.\nHe was looking for signals. He was removing trees and looking for signals. And we find\nafter a while he did find a signal. And the most amazing thing, in the midst of the darkest\narea, well, now you couldn't see any further, any further, he, he bend down two trees, two\nbranches. And we walked in, and we find ourself in the midst of a field with Jewish men and\nJewish women and children. Was a group of maybe 20, 30 people. And they had dug out a,\na, a hole and covered with, with, with grass. And anytime there was a danger, everybody\nwalked down in the hole and, and, and they stayed down there. I stayed there for the first\nday, the second day. It was already in mid-July. That was already the third week, or the\nsecond.",
        "Q: There's only four or five minutes left, so we should try to -- there's only four or five minutes\nleft so --",
        "A: We have only four or five minutes?",
        "Q: Yeah, so maybe we should usually get moving.",
        "A: Little bit. Anyhow, then we had to move from there, because the front was coming closer\nand the Germans were coming closer. Then we, we, we couldn't get anymore, the farmer\ncouldn't get to us. And we didn't had any food. We had to go by, we had to go in turns to the\nfarmers to beg for food. And there were German soldiers walked out from one side of the\nhouse, and we walked in the whole, in the other side of the house. Both had the same\npurpose -- to beg for food. And after three, four weeks -- after three weeks, exactly on July\nAth, the war was over, and I was liberated. And I came back to Kovno, and that's it.",
        "Q: Ok. Is there anything else that you'd like to, in this last couple of minutes, is there anything? I\nknow there's many, many details that you'd want to add. But is there any particular thought?",
        "A: I don't know what details I can add, except for while I -- and I immediately took off to go\nback to Kovno, and I didn't wait for the ceremonies and parades. And while there was a\ncurvy highway, and while I was going down the curve, suddenly a, a, a rifle is in my\nstomach. I lift up my hands and shouted who I am. And the soldier removed his rifle. It was a\nRussian soldier, and he didn't know what to speak to me. I didn't know how to speak to him.\nBut he called over a Jewish soldier, and I told the Jew who I am. And he cried and all the\nother soldiers cried, and everybody else cried then. After a couple of hours crying, I, after a\nhalf hour, I relaxed and went back to Kovno, and went, went to Kovno.",
        "Q: So that was your first encounter?",
        "A: My first encounter with the liberating army, yes. That were my first encounter.",
        "Q: And how long did you remain in Kovno?",
        "A: I was liberated August first. And I, and I made the arrangements. I met Jonas Petronis, my\nformer associate and my former friend, who became again the manager of all the office\nproduct properties. And within the first two weeks, I was walking around from garbage can\nto garbage can in the Lithuanian houses to try to get some food. And from the day I met him,\nI became a multi-millionaire. I became so rich. He was taking up properties, car loads of\nproperties, from the Communist hands -- which was originally my own merchandise, or part\nof my own. And I was selling it on the black market. I was walking out on the street with a\npencil in my hand. I had three Jewish with big suitcases standing behind me in the gate, and\na young officer was running by, and behind him two soldiers, Russian officer, behind him\ntwo soldiers. And we passed him by. And then he cursed, and cursed word, \"Blatzky rod!\nKarandashi, Karandashi!\"\"\u00b0 A pencil. It dawned on him what I have. And he run back, and\nhe saw my pencil and what, wanted to know how many I have and how much, how many I\nhave and how much. And he shouted to the Russian, to the soldiers to come over. And they\nshould pour over all the money in my suitcase, and I poured over all the -- within a week's\ntime, I became a multi-millionaire. It's went all to the devil, but that's beside the point. I\nopened a kitchen immediately and hired two Jewish woman to cook for the hungry Jews --\nfree of charge, naturally, knowing myself the way I am. And I was running around in the\ncity, and I selling, inviting people to come and eat. I met a rabbi, a older man, Mordchai\nPagramanski (ph). And when I was liberated, he came to the, to the forest where we were.\nWhat happened to him is not to be believed. They decided -- the Germans were, were exp--\nthrowing bombs over the buildings, to destroy the hiding Jews. And when it came to his part,\nthey decided that then, the officer said, \"Mittagszeit, Feierabend.\"*\u2019 And they stopped, and\nthey went to eat, and they didn't came back the same day. So they decided to escape, and\nthey delegated him to go to the German guards to ask permission to run away. And while\n* \u201cPuck your family! Pencils!

And he decided if the guard 1s dead drunk, he does not have\nto ask him permission. And they all started to go. And they marched dozens of kilometers,\ncrossing over the whole German Army, with the big beards -- seven, eight Jews with the big\nbeards. And they all arrived at the same place.",

I\nwas born in 1912, and in those days they had no documents in my village at all, so my father\nremembered that I was born two weeks before the big fire.

And when I was hardly three\nyears old, my father and mother wrapped me in a tallis and carried me a long distance to the\nrabbi's house.

But on the second coin, I lift up my head, I lift up eyes and I notice the rabbi stand\nover my, over my head, and I realized that it's not from heaven, but it's coming from the\nrabbi's hand.

        "A: In those days, the first rabbi -- which I just told you -- started with me to learn the kheder,\u201d\nthe elementary Talmudistic study. After that, in those days -- it's about a hundred years ago,\nin the Jewish families, a boy was not supposed to have elementary education, and my father\nwanted me to be a rabbi. So gradually, when I was finished with the kheder, I was sent to a\nyeshiva. Since my village was too small to have a yeshiva, so I was sent to Vilkomir, a large\ncity where I went to the yeshiva in Vilkomir. Since the custom was in those days that the\nyeshiva didn't had any cooking facilities, and -- every boy was by himself. And the custom\nwas that the local residents were giving a day to eat. Each family gave one day to a Yeshiva\nbokher. And since my mother had relatives in Vilkomir who were some of the most\nestablished and wealthiest people, so I had pretty comfortable every day in the families\nwhere I was eating every day, except for Thursday. Thursday was my day with -- where my\nmother's aunt and cousin, two elderly widows, mother and daughter, who owned half of the\nproperty in Vilkomir. But they never gave me anything to eat. And I was arriving about nine\no'clock in the morning for breakfast. After staying an hour and a half, and time to go back to\nthe kheder and I was not supposed to be late to the yeshiva, and I was not supposed to be late\nin the yeshiva. And I was held -- when I was holding the handle 1n the door to walk out and\nsaying to the Tante,\u201d \"A guten Tag, Tante Esther.\u201d\u201d That that's -- then, only then, she shouted\nfrom the other room, \"A guten Tag, Dovid Yankele.

        "A: My father died. My father took sick. He was never sick in his life. He worked like a horse to\nsupport his wife and the five daughters. He didn't have to support me then because I was\neating days in the yeshiva. And the first week he took sick, he died in three, four days. They\nsent a horse and buggy -- there was no, no motor vehicles in that time. And if there would\nhave been already a bus or a truck that what would be cruising from Aniksht to Vilkomir, my\nfamily didn't have the money to pay. So a horse and buggy who was cruising constantly,\ntwice a week from Aniksht to Vilkomir, picked me up to take me home. When I walked in in\nthe house, the father's bed was standing 1n the middle of the living room. And I managed to\ncome over to his bed and tell him, \"Father, it's me, Dovid Yankele.\" And he managed to\nmove his hand over my body with affection, and a few minutes later he was dead. The\nlederer Rov,\u2019 the chief rabbi in Aniksht, who was this really holy man, he explain me that\nmy father would have been dead three, four days ago -- the first or the second day he took\nsick -- except God kept him alive until the moment I arrive, and that's when he passed away.",
        "A: In that time, my father was extremely well-to-do. He had good days and bad days. But in that\ntime, so happened that he had horses and chickens and, and, and, and cows. And the day he\ndied, before the age of 12 or about, I suddenly became the old man of the family, and I had\nto take care not only of five grown-up sisters of mine and a constantly sick mother, but I had\nto take care of four horses and six cows and 12 chickens and porcupines. I had my own\nporcupine, who was still in the house. And I had to take care of all that. And it was a little\ntoo much for me. My older sister happened to have had escaped from Lithuania to deep\nRussia in the First World War, and she came back as a returnee. She had a husband and two\nchildren. All three of them died from hunger in her presence, so she was mentally slightly\ntouched off. And when I decided to sell all the cows and all the horses and everything, to\nliquidate the properties, she became disturbed, and she grabbed a knife, and she was ready to\nstab me. And I escaped and came to the capital, Kovno, where one of my sisters was married\nby then already, and I stayed with her. And from there on, I developed myself.",
        "A: Well, that happened within a period of a few weeks or a few months. So I was about 14 -- 13\nto 14 when that incident happened, and I came to Kovno.\n* Rabbi (Yiddish)",
        "A: I stayed for a little while with my married sister. And after that, I got myself a job as a\nmessenger boy in different retail outlets. And from there on, I, I kept building my life the\nbest way I can. All my other sisters were single, and they all had boyfriends. And all their\nboyfriends were ready to marry them except they refused to marry them without getting the\ndowry, which was the custom in the Jewish tradition in those days, which was called nadn.\u201d\nAnd without nadn, they weren't ready to marry them. We helped marry off my first sister by\nissuing \"veksels,\u201d\u201d\u201d which is promissory notes, of five thousand dollars for the two houses\nwhich we owned. Both houses were connected to each other, and there was a barn where we\nkept the cows and the horses in between the houses so you could walk from the inside. It was\na valuable property in those days. So the promissory notes that we had, first my mother and I\nhad to sign up to my first brother-in-law, otherwise he would not have married my sister.\nAnd he kept the notes in his -- under his pillow in his bed. So with the conniving of my\nmarried sister, we took out the notes from him and we gave it to the boyfriend of my second\nsister, and he married her. From thereon, we repeatedly did that all the time until all my\nsisters were married.",
        "A: Since I didn't had any schooling; it was forbidden while I was a yeshiva bokher to educate\nmyself. And we were living eight boys in one room, for the sole purpose that the boys should\nspy on each other, or not one of the boys should do something wrong illegally. And reading\na book in any language other than the Gemara was a illegal deed. So I had to have a candle, a\nlighted candle, covered with my blanket in order to read literature. And I tried to study, to\neducate myself. I gave up the study in yeshiva, because a student relative of mine in\nVilkomir, by the name of Yankel Zibutz (ph) smuggled me in the life of Baruch Spinoza and\nIsrael Acosta (ph). And when I was finished reading those two books under the candlelight\ncovered in my bed at night, in the danger of burning down the whole village and the whole\nhouse, I realized that to be a yeshiva bokher and continue is not for me. I became a educated\nskeptic, and I gave up the study. And by then, my father died and it happened what it\nhappened to me. So without any trade, I was too young for any trade or any occupation. So I\nwas getting jobs in retail outlets to make deliveries, and I joined up a Yiddish cultural night\nschool, where they was teaching people who didn't had the elementary schooling to be\neducated in the -- at night. And that is my -- what I had. After working for several retail\noutlets, I finally got myself a job in a office supply retail outlet by a childless couple. And\nthey, more or less, treated me like their own child. And I grew up with them, and became a\nadult with those people.\n\u201d Dowry (Hebrew)\n0 Promissory note, IOU (Yiddish)",
        "A: As I moved into my 20s ... I -- being engaged in a office products company, and where the\nLithuanian intellectuals, under the leadership of the priests and the, and the educated people\nstarted a tremendous antisemitic hate campaign towards the Jews. And the office products\ncompany were the first victims, because it was only and primarily the government\ninstitutions like the Foreign Ministry and the Diplomatic Ministry and the Internal Ministry,\nand all the other government agencies who were the prime customers of the office supply\ncompanies. And the government and the fascist Siauliaitist party kept sending pickets to\npicket some of the Jewish stores so gentiles should not come in. And the government\ninstructions was not to buy from Jews. I attempted, with the help of the proprietors of the\ncompany, to do something in that respect. And I took a trip to my village, which was\nAniksht. And there, I discussed with a gentile former childhood friend of mine by the name\nof Jonas Kovalisch (ph), and I encouraged him to come to Kovno and to buy out the existing\nretail outlet. And he lined up a, a, another gentile gentleman by the name of Jonas\nSvinkeviches (ph), who was a former publisher of the, of dictionaries and other books, and\nwas not engaged in that time in any business. And the two of them bought out the company,\nand it became a pure Christian company. And they became extremely successful because all\nthe agencies of the government institutions immediately start to buy from them. I still\nremained with the company as a inside man in the, in the closed, in the -- in the locked --\nlocked inside quarters, far away from the eye of the public. And yet, the very same\npurchasing agents of the very same government agencies who were placing the orders,\nrefused to deal with the pure Lithuanian Christian employees, and they dealt only with me.",
        "A: That was up until 1933. In 1933, it became more and more difficult, and my position with\nthe company became more and more difficult because people didn't stay in their job very\nlong. People got old. People got married. They moved away. So new employees came in the\npurchasing departments, and they didn't want to be bothered with buying, with, with taking\ncare of, with me helping them take care of. So my position became more or less obsolete. So\nJonas Kowalisch (ph) decided, with my consent, that instead of keeping me in Kovno on the\njob which I had no, no, no purpose anymore and there was no way how I could get any other\nexistence, he decided to send me on a trip to America. Since the relationship was so good\nwith all the government agencies, he made me make an appointment with the protocol chief\nof the Foreign Ministry in Kovno. And when I had the appointment with that gentlemen, he\ntold me, \"David, I'll give you diplomatic papers that you are a diplomatic courier. I'll give\nyou two suitcases, where you'll deliver to the Lithuanian Embassy in Kovno in New York --\nor to the Lithuanian Consulate in New York. And you will travel as a diplomatic courier, and\nyou'll be able to get a visa and come in to the United States. If I will not have -- and I\ncertainly will not have -- any documents to send it to you -- with you. I will put in\nnewspapers and fill it in.\" And that's what happened. I got a visa. I arrived to America. I\ndelivered the two suitcases to the Consul General, to the Lithuanian Consul General, in New\nYork. And I went to my, my family from Bedford Hills picked me up, and I stayed there for\na short period of time.",
        "A: No, I did not go back to Lithuania. And then, when my immigration, when my visa time\nexpired, I discovered that if you have fifty dollars in your pocket, you can take any\ntransportation and arrive in Lisbon without any documents, in Lisbon, Portugal, without any\nvisas or any documents. Or maybe they did require some kind of a paper where you would\nget where you get it in the, in the Portuguese Consulate in New York. I had the fifty dollars. I\narranged everything, and I took a boat, and two weeks later, I arrived in Lisbon. And I\nattempt to get established over there, to build up my existence.",
        "A: After a while -- by then it was already closer to 1936. After a while, the sit- the situation in\neastern Europe, particularly Lithuania and the three Baltic states -- Lithuania, Latvia and\nEstonia -- became extremely dangerous. Vul-vulnerable from Hitler's part and from Stalin's\npart. Those three Baltic countries are like a little kitten squeezed in between a lion and a\nhippopotamus. And I felt that my five sisters -- I'm sorry -- by then it was only four sisters,\nbecause one of my brother-in-laws, my youngest sister Hanke (ph), was a leftist activist in\nKovno. And Lithuania was a fascist government under the rule of President Smetona.'' And\nhe was in danger to be arrested and be imprisoned for a long, long time -- escaped to South\nAmerica, to Uruguay. And three, four months after he arrived in Uruguay, he sent papers for\nmy sister. So the two of them were in Uruguay. So I was left with four sisters. I realized that\nif anything happens, anything dramatic happens to Kovno or to Lithuania, all my four sisters,\nwith all their four husbands -- each of them had four or five children -- and with all their\nchildren -- and my mother, my mother must have been 70 years by then. They will be\ndestroyed in 10 minutes after anything happened, without me and my supervision and my\nability to survive. So I voluntarily left Portugal to go back to Lithuania to be with my family.",
        "A: When I arrived there, I became a volun-- a, a free-lance business representative. I had friends\n'' Antanas Smetona was the leader of the fascist Gelezinis Vilkas (iron Wolf) movement and\npresident of Lithuania since 1926.\nin every industry -- in the garment industry, in the office product industry. I had a assistant\nby the name of Jonas Petronis (ph). He was a pure Christian. And here began the antisemitic\ndrive. The hate towards the Jews became stronger and stronger with the influence of Hitler.\nAnd no Jewish office supply storekeeper, or stationery storekeeper, could ever survive\nanymore. In the hundreds and hundreds of villages in Lithuania, every dru -- every little store\nwas selling school supplies for the schools. The written or non-written instructions -- I don't\nknow which one it 1s -- came that no school in any community in Lithuania should purchase\noffice products as school supplies from the Jewish storekeepers. So the Catholic hierarchy in\nKovno, where it's the headquarters of all the hate towards the Jews, decided to open up a\nwholesale office product business to supply all the school systems in Lithuania with office\nproducts and school supplies and books. By that, they took away by itself automatically all\nthe business from the Jewish store keepers. And my friend, Jonas Petronis (ph) became --\nthe, the priests and the prelates, they had nothing to do with the office products. What did\nthey know about office products? So he became the general director of all the off -- of all the\nimports of the office product supplies in Lithuania, for the whole Lithuanian region. And\nsnaturally, being one of the few non-Jewish-hating Lithuanians, he immediately made me the\n-- appointed me to be the general representative, or independent dealer, on all the products\nwhat they had. I was able to buy wholesale, and I was able to sell to the Jewish retail\nstorekeepers and to the non-Jewish retail, and to provide myself with a decent existence. I, I\nhave to stop for a second.",
        "A: I'm ready.",
        "A: That was in about 1936, towards the end of 1936. Where I build myself my existence\nthrough the means I just explained you and were as comfortable as anybody could be. I\nsupported all my sisters' families where they were spread out all over Lithuania. One of my\nsisters remained in Aniksht. Another sister was living in Jonava. A third sister was living in\nKovno, in the suburb of Kovno called Slobodka; and a fourth sister was in Aleksotas. And\nwith the grace of Jonas Petronis (ph), I was very successful in my business. I'm sorry, I'd like\nto correct myself. With the grace of the one of the few decent, non-Jewish-hating Christians,\nJonas Petronis (ph), I was able to become very successful and help all my family, and help\nall the people with whom I was ever involved in business, and many of my friends. Financial\nresource was no object with me at all.",
        "A: There was no way how to make any attempt to get out the family of Lithuania. The whole\nworld was closed for Lithuanian Jews. As a matter of fact, the day of the ti -- the day of the\nout-outbreak of the war between Hitler and Stalin, there were there were extremely wealthy\nJews walking around with foreign passports and foreign visas to go in any part of the world.\nAnd they couldn't go because Lithuania wouldn't let them out. And the consul of the\nprospective countries, who gave out the visas because of decency and humane reasons, knew\nbefore he gave them the visas that those countries wouldn't let them in. There was no way for\nme to attempt to take out my family or myself. I came in. I came in to the, to the, to the --\nvoluntarily from a free country like Portugal to this situation, because I knew that my family\nwould not have survived any difficulty without me. But to attempt to get out, there was no\nway.",
        "A: What happened to me 1s, in Vilijampole, where my sister in Vilijampole, where my sister\nlived was the heart of the Jewish poor population in Kovno. The popularity -- the population\n-- was mostly Jewish. All the great famous yeshivas were there. And when the war broke\nout, it took three days and three nights that the German were not able to step in in the\nvillages, in Kovno and in other villages, because the fronts were going on fightings between\nthe Russian Army and the German Army. But the civil Russian popula-- government in\nevery community, including Kovno and Vilijampolis, disintegrated within a half a day of the\nfirst outbreak of the war, which was the night of June 21st, 1941. In those three days and\nthree nights, with the Russian might disappeared suddenly within one day. All the\nfunctionaries of the Russian government and Party had their trucks and their buses and other\nmeans of transportation stacked away somewhere. And when it happened, they all packed up\ntheir families and they left. And the population was left without any mercy at all. And it's the\nLithuanian fascists, who were prepared for all the time since the Russian rule was in Kovno,\nsecretly, by the Nazi agents to have uniforms and ammunition. So the first half a hour after\nthe outbreak of the war that there was no more Russian might, the Lithuanian fascists -- they\ncalled themselves Siauliaitists or Siaulitists (ph), I don't know exactly -- the very same\norganization who before the war was doing all the anti-Jewish activities, they were within\none half an hour in uniforms.\nAnd they marched in in Slobodka; and they murdered the most brutal, the most unbelieved\ninhumanely torturous way almost all the population, the Jewish population, in that\ncommunity. I was supposed to be there, too, and I was supposed to be murdered. And I know\nthat there's no reason why I would have a better human being than everybody, where all my\nfriends were murdered. Except for one thing. Being a volun -- free. Being a independent\nrepresentative in the office products field, where I was selling to the retail outlets and I had a\ntremendous fine relationship with all the employees in the companies with whom I did\nbusiness. And one of the companies, the employee manager \u2014 a, a Jewish girl by the name of\nHinda \u2014 Hindale (ph), she was a member of the Communist Party. She was a member of the\nExecutive Committee of the Communist Party. And as soon as the Communist, Communist\nrule took over the power in Kovno -- that was about 1940, about a year prior to the outbreak\nof the war -- she called me. It's about a week and a half, about a week prior to the start of the\nwar. She called me that there's a meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party,\nand my name was put on to be sent to Siberia. For months and months and months, or weeks\nand weeks, the secret police used to ring the bell in the, in the most of the Jewish houses,\npack them up, send them to the station and send them to Siberia. There was no way of telling\nwho will be next to go. Since of my attitude being extremely polished and friendly with\neverybody, one of these, one of the highest activists of the Communist Party was constantly\nimprisoned by the Lithuanian. And he was a, a -- and his background was the office product\nindustry, and his family was known. And Hindale was the one who was collecting money\nfrom me to support his family, and to support other families, and the other of the imprisoned\npolitical prisoners, Jewish or non-Jewish. I gave to everybody generously, so she knew\nexactly who I was. And there were a great deal of members of the Central Committee of the\nCommunist Pa -- Kovno Lithuanian Communist Party, who also knew about my activities as\na human being. And she called me and informed me that I am on the list to be taken to\nSiberia. There was a mi-- a, a minority rule vote against taking me out, but the majority won.\nAnd she suggested to me that the person from whose family I helped support -- I don't know\nhis name, he became the head of the rectory of the vacation. He became the Commissioner\nof the head of the vacation for the whole commercial enterprises in Kovno. And since I was -\n- had to take a job by then already, because I also was advised by inside information that it's\nnot healthy for me to be a free-lance representative, so they appointed a job for me in one of\nthe retail outlets.\nI became the prekiau (ph) zinaviets\u2019~ (ph) -- the merchandise specialist. So she suggested to\nme I thought I should call that gentleman and ask him to grant me a vacation, because I\ndidn't feel good. I called him in his office, I made an appointment with him the same day to\nhave dinner with him in a restaurant. I explained to him that I don't feel good. I happen\nphysically to suffer from psoriasis. And all I had to do is unroll my sleeve and scratch a little\nin my, in my, in my joint area that 1t becomes white, to convince him that I am what I am.\nAnd he saw it. He called me the next day, and suggested that there's two openings for me on\nvacation. One was in Sochi, in Crimo-Cacausus\u2019\u201d -- the most luxury resort area in Russia,\nwhere Stalin personally had one of his villas. And I certainly shivered away from that. The\nnext place was Druskininkai, a resort area, a very famous resort area which belonged to\nLithuania five hundred years ago at the time when Lithuania ruled a great deal of eastern\n* Tn Lithuanian, the word for merchandise is \u201cprekes.\u201d The word for knowledge is\n\u201czinojimas.\u201d The interviewee\u2019s alteration of the endings of both words is probably due to\na vernacular not present in our dictionaries.\n'\u00b0 Located on the Black Sea, very near the border between the Russian S.F.S.R. and Georgia.\nEurope. And in 1918-20, in the war between the Lithuanian's independent and Poland's\nindependent, a Polish general occupied the whole territory with this Lithuanian capital of\nVilna, and it became Polish. And I accepted to go to Druskininkai. Since I am a person of -- I\nnever believed in delaying matters and in being sloppy, whatever I do, I immediately\naccepted the permit and that was on Monday night. Tuesday, I took the train to Druskininkai.\nI arrived there late Tuesday night. I registered in the hotel with all the formalities. And\nWednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday night, I was dancing in a nightclub with the, with\nthe wife of a Russian colonel -- the head of the Com-- of the whole Russian Army in that\narea. And we walked out 12 o'clock midnight, and we hear tremendous thunder. And she\nsaid that, \"These maneuvers... my husband told me that we may have maneuvers.\" And I\nsaid, \"No, that's not maneuvers. That is some kind of a war.\" And I went straight to the hotel.\nAnd a few minutes after I arrived to the hotel, the loudspeaker heard already Molotov's\nspeech that war broke out. I think we'll have a little recess.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION \u2014 PAUSE",
        "A: I will continue. Oh, sorry. Can I stand up for a minute?\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: When the war broke out?",
        "A: Since I was a fairly well-to-do person, and without a family, as soon as the Communists took\nover Lithuania, everybody in Lithuania, every -- but everybody had to look like Stalin, to\nmake themselves a Stalin jacket and high boots, and pants with, with -- how do you call it?\n'* Molotov, Vyachelslav (1890-1986)\nRider pants, whatever it was. So I, I had tailor-made luxury black ankle leather coats, with\nhigh boots, with Stalinuvka\u2019\u201d (ph) jackets. And at the ttme when Molotov's speech was\ndelivered, the tens of thousands of vacationers, they're starting to run around in chaotic -- a\nmad situation. And nobody know what to do, and nobody knew where to go. And I\nimmediately decided that I will start to escape in the only highway road which was near the\nresort area. And I walked out with my beautiful black raincoat, dressed in the beautiful boots\nto look like a commissar. And after 10, 15 minutes walking, my feet were already crippled,\nand I had to throw away the boots and walk barefoot. I walked for an hour this way. While\npassing by -- that was in the middle of the night -- there was a water well. And thousands of\npeople were laying around the water well, hanging around. There was a school of Russian\nstudents. I don't remember what kind of school. It was a vocational school. And the boys\nwho were who were taking out the water from the well wore uniforms. And the thousands of\npeople had stretched out their hands to get a drink of water. I had some properties with me,\nand in the properties I had built in two very, very expensive diamonds. I prepared myself for\nthat kind of even-eventuality in many situations. In, in a dry shaving soap container, like a\nlittle, like a little roller. And I took that out and stretched out my hand to hand over to the\nboys; and within two seconds, I got the water. And I continued. Daybreak came, and by then\nI was half-dead. I couldn't walk anymore. I was on a field where thousands of people were\nlaying stretched out on the field, already half-dead from the same difficulty of walking\nbarefoot.\nAnd the German airplanes came flying over the field. And a lot of people were shoving\nthemselves through their bodies crawling, with the hope that they will be able to crawl closer\nto the bombs and get killed so they die, but it didn't happen to me. And it just so happened\nthat by then I was near a road where thousands of refugees were running towards Russia.\nThat highway was closer to Russia. Those borders, in those days, the, the, the, the national\nterritories that a little, a little highway, a little road -- here was Poland, five seconds later it\nwas Ukrainia, and, and a little bit further it was Byelorussia. It was all part of the same\nterritories. So I happened to be lying near the, the route, near the road, where a Jewish family\nwith a horse and buggy, with some children and women were on the, on the, on the, on the\nwagon, and men were walking with the wagon. And one of the women noticed me. And she\nstarted to cry and forced the man to put me on the wagon. And on the wagon, they bandaged\nmy feet and powdered it. And I recuperated. And after traveling all day and almost a half a\nnight, wherever we went the Germans were ahead of us. Finally we land up a village in\nUkraine. We were 1n a barn of a, of a Ukrainian farmer house. It was then already forbidden\nby Jews to take in wandering Jews. So the Ukrainian had mercy with us and took us in the\nbarn. And I remember if it happened today, right now, that his two grown-up sons were busy\nin the village robbing the Jewish properties. And the old man -- he must have been eighty,\nninety years old -- stood for hours in the doorway of his barn where we were laying, with a,\nwith a stick like a baseball stick over his shoulder, ready to beat his sons when they'll be\n> Stalinka jackets.\nfinished robbing the Jewish houses in the village and when they will come back home to stop\nthem from going in in the barn and kill us and take away the properties what those people\nhad with whom I was attached. I had no properties again at all anymore, so there was\nnothing to take from me. All they could do is kill me.\nAfter we left this property, we continued riding further and further and further. And we didn't\nmanage to go very far, where we stopped at another house. And I, I was relaxed already and\nalmost everything in my foot healed, except one area which was bleeding. And I was sitting\nin the front of the house. I think the house, the people in the house what made me do\nsomething in the front -- clean a pot, I don't remember what. And a group of German soldiers\nstopped and asked me, \"Du Jude?\"'\u00b0 And I said, \"Jude.\" And they took me with them. They\ntook me to a, to a, to a, to a fairly decent-looking residence. And it was vacant, and they\nmade me scrub the floor. It was the headquarters for the commanding general to stopover\nwhen he will arrive. They were preparing the headquarters. And since one of the guards\nnoticed my bleeding foot, they called in the military doctor and he bandaged my foot. In the\nmeantime, he bought something to eat. And after I was finished cleaning, they took me back\nto the place where they picked me up. By then, it was too late to go anywhere, because the\nroutes were bombed and destroyed and the Germans were everywhere. So the family, the\nfamily from Grodno to whom I attached myself, decided to go back to Grodno. And it took\nus several days. And we arrived in Grodno. Shortly before we came to the proper city in\nGrodno, there was the gendarmes, the military gendarmes, who were controlling the traffic.\nAnd they stepped -- they stopped us and identified a whole group as Jews and took us\nstraight to the prison. And from there, they kept us for a day or so. And since the whole\nfamily was in Grodno, resident family, they let them all go -- including me. So I stayed for a\nfew days with that family. Shortly afterwards, few -- I rested for a day or so. And then I --\nthey told me -- I spoke no Polish. So the family with whom I was staying discovered that\nthere are thousands of refugees are lined up in the front of the German commandant to get\npasses to go back to their homes. Where do you have that many thousands of refugees?\nBecause Druskininkai, the resort area where I was, was a resort area only for, for\nvacationers. There were dozens of hotels only for vacationers. And there were many other\nresort hotels in that area. So thousands, and maybe tens of thousands of Russian laborers and\nemployees who had a vacation lined up over there and were caught in the war. And they all\nlined up in Grodno, in the front of the Kommandantur to get passes to go home. And I did\nthe same thing. The procedure was: there was a big street, no traffic, it was blocked off;\nacross the street of the building of the Kommandantur, the thousands of people were staying\nand waiting in line. There were several German guards who controlled the traffic of the\npeople. And when a group of 10, 20 people walked out from the Kommandantur, that means\nthey took care of their business. The guards permitted a group of these other 10, 20 people to\ngo in. Since thousands of people were waiting on the other side and the guard doesn't\ndesignate who should come in, so the thousands of them was starting to run. So the guards\n'\u00b0 \u201cAre You a Jew?\u201d (German)\nwere controlling the outside. They let that many people in, and they did not permit any more.\nAnd the rest of them went back. That repeated itself several times a day. I was there for one\nday, and I think a second day. After that, the rule came out that every Jew should wear a Star\nof David. And the Grodno family made up Stars of David on the front and on the back, and\nthey made a set of Star of Davids for me, too. So the next morning, six o'clock in the\nmorning, I arrived at the, at the line-up place, already with my Star of David. I am not a tall\nperson. And between the husky big people without the Star of David, I would never had a\nopportunity to get there because as groups of people got their, their fulfillment, new groups\nof people arrived to wait for the police. A day passed by. Although nobody ever attempted to\noffend me at all, while I was standing, but when I started to run with all the other people to\nget in, that's when they pushed me aside and did not let me go near it. And one day, I think,\ntwo days passed by. Early morning on the third day, when I lined up together with all the\nother people, the German guard walked over to me and said, \"Du, Jude, komm.\"\"\u2019 And he\nwalked me through the gate, and while walking he said to me, \"Die Schweine, die, die, die\nRussians! Ich hab gesehen was ist \u2014 was angeht, und du hast niemals die Gelegenheit\ndurchzugehen.\" 6",
        "A: I was the only Jew with the Star of David waiting for a permission to go through. And he\nrealized there's so much going on. And he walked me through the Kommandantur. I walked\nin, in the corridor, and the officer was sitting at the desk. And I explained to him in German\nthat I'm, I'm going to the Kommandantur to ask a permit to go back from Kovno, to go back\nto Kovno. And he told me to go on the second floor, I'll see the people there, I'll know where\nto go in. And I did walk in, and my turn came after a little while. And another elderly\nGerman officer was sitting at, at the desk, and he and a civilian Pole was standing next to\nhim. Since all the applicants for permission to go home were not Poles -- they were Russian\nand Ukrainian, and all, all other people and all nationalities. Poles had no need to ask\npermission to go home, because that was their home at that moment. So, naturally, the\nCommandant had an interpreter. And I was the only Jew who came over. And the Polish\ninterpreter attempted immediately to explain the Commandant, in his broken Pol\u2014German -\n- that I am a Communist and I should be shot right away. My ear was very clear then. I stood\nup like, like \"Achtung!\" -- you know, like \"Attention!\" -- and I said to the Commandant,\n\"Der Mann ligt! Ich bin ein, ein, ein -- ich bin hier ftir Erholung in Druskininkai, und bin in\ndem middle auf dem Ausbruch, auf dem Krieg, von Kovno, Lithuanien. Und ich bitte dem\nCommandant erlauben es zuriickziehen nach Kovno.\"\u2019\u201d The man took a look at me, picked\nup his stamp, stamped on a paper, and out I was.\n'T \u201cVou, Jew, come.\u201d (German)\n'* \u201cThe swine, the, the, the Russians! I have seen what is going on, and you have no chance\nto go through.\u201d (German)\n'? \"The man lies! I have been an, an, an -- I am here for rehabilitation at Druskininkai and\nhave been caught in the middle of the escape from Kovno, Lithuania. And if the\ncommandant will allow, will return to Kovno.\" (German)\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: I went back to the family in Grodno. They, they gave me a little food to go, and the next day\nin the morning I started off to go on foot towards Lithuania, which people suggested the\nroute I should take. There's not traffic. I was the only one going on that route, and no\nwalkers, nothing. I was just by myself. I walked all day long and rested for a while. It was --\nby then, it was in mid-- in mid-July, and it was extremely hot. And from time to time, I\nrested. I became thirsty, but I had nowhere out to drink. And towards the evening, I arrived\nat the house. There wasn't even any houses where to stop. But that was a house, and I\nstopped. And they gave me something to eat and they gave me to drink, and I continued.\nAnd late at night I arrived back in Druskininkai. From there, I started off. And by then, was\nalready a rule issued by the German authorities that no local resident should be permitted to\ntake in a strange Jew in their houses, under the penalty of death. Then I stretched out on the\nsidewalk, laying there ready to die, whatever will happen to me. I was extremely exhausted\nfrom the walk. I was already again hungry and thirsty. And early in the morning -- I laid all\nnight like that -- and early in the morning, at time when people were beginning to move\naround, there were two Jewish girls from Kovno who were also vacationing. They were\nnurses. I think they were sisters. And they saw me laying on the sidewalk. They recognized\nme. They came over, and they cried dramatically over me. But they couldn't help me, either.\nBut they brought me some water, and something to eat. And I strengthened myself a little bit.\nAnd after a while, I was laying there again. I didn't have the strength to get up. And two girls\npassed by. And they passed me -- Christian girls -- they passed me by laughing and giggling.\nAnd while they passed me by, one of them made a remark. I don't remember why the remark\nwas. And they came back, and that one girl recognized me. In the good days, prior -- about a\nyear, a year and a half ago, when Hitler attacked Poland, thousands of Polish Jewish refugees\nfind themselves in Lithuania. And one person from Warsaw, whom I became very friendly\nand sheltered him and helped him economically and to survive, happened to be a playboy.\nAnd he -- the girls were clinging to him like, like honey to a bee, and he had dates\nconstantly. And since I was a single fellow, too, we had dates together. And I remember one\nweekend he arranged a date for me with two gentile girls whose sister was married to a\nJewish musician in Kovno. And we had a beautiful evening together; but that was about a\nyear ago of the time that I was laying on the sidewalk. And my date, one of the two girls we\nhad a date, was that girl. How do you like that?! And she happened to be the sister of the\nLithuanian chief of the organized partisan murderous bands, who were busy in that time not\nto bother with the Jews.\nBecause 1n the Polish Ukrainian villages, the Lithuanian partisans who take over the power\nimmediately were busy antagonizing or robbing or murdering the Poles. They had not -- they\ndidn't have to bother with the Jews, because the Jews wouldn't run away from them. They\nhad time plenty for the Jews later on. But her brother was the head of the organizers of the\nmurderous partisan bands, who for participated in most of the destructive murders of Kovno\n-- including Slobodka, primarily Slobodka. Where if I would have been there, what I started\nto explain you originally. By all counts I should have been there. But because physically I\nhappened to be in Druskininkai, so I wasn't murdered. So he brought me in his house.",
        "A: Then they gave me to eat and to drink, and they gave me some clothing. And he was getting\nready to send a transport of additional murderers to Kovno, to continue with the beautiful\nwork they did. And he instructed them to put me in the truck and to take me to Kovno. After\nall, I was his custody. And he instructed them, and he had told me, that on the highway they\nwill be stopped by a German officer who was the real head chief of the, of the, of the\nEinsatzkommando.\u201d\u201d And he will give them additional instructions in writing and will\nconverse with them. The German didn't speak Lithuanian, and the Lithuanian didn't speak\nGerman. But he will give them instructions what, additional instructions what to do in\nKovno. Prior to this stop, where he was supposed to wait for them, the soldiers should put\nme underneath their feet between the benches. The truck had benches arranged for people to\nsit. And they should cover me up with their feet. And he explained me, too -- or his sister\nexplained me -- that it will be stopped, and a German officer will talk German. I should not\nbreath or make any sign of anything. I should stay still. And I did, and they passed by. The\ntrip was a pretty long trip. It was almost a whole day. Towards the evening, they stopped in\nthe front of a, of a farmhouse, or a restaurant, where they all went in to eat. And they took\nme in, too, and I ate with them. When they arrived in Kovno, on Vilna Street -- one of the\nmain streets -- they just let me off. I'm finished. I'm finished, I -- their duty was over. That\nhouse was not far of the house where my brother-in-law's brother was living. So I walked in\nin that house, in their apartment. And there I find my sister with her two children, and my\nmother, from Jonava, with a niece of mine -- the one who survived. And there they -- I\ndiscovered the whole the whole story what happened. I would have been in Slobodka, in my\nsister's house. And they avoid that the brutal murder of the pogroms on the first three days.\nOn the fourth day, a group of partisans, murderous, decided to go and check out from house\nto house.\nMy sister happened to have lived in a attic. So the eight, nine men who were hiding were up\nthere in that apartment -- my brother-in-law, his brother, his son and other people -- they're\nhiding in the attic. It was not the straight down roof where you could fold up. It was a attic\nroof like areas were straight, where people could lay down there. After they didn't find\nanybody, they all walked out. And some of the idiots inside decided to look from, on the\n\u201d Task force (German)\nbalcony, decided to look if it's all over. And the last partisan decided to look up, and they\nmet each other. And they took them all down, and they took them to the Ninth\nFortification.\u201d' And they murdered them, together with most of the Jews that were murdered.\nYou have to remember that this Fortification, the Seventh and the Ninth Fortification, was\nfortifications -- you know what a fortification is? Built by the Czarist Russia to pretend -- to\nprevent -- attacks from German armies in, in 1905. And they were still in existence. And the\nLithuanian took them over, and that's where they murdered most of the Jews. They took\nthem there.",
        "A: The next, the next thing what happened, I happened to have an apartment in Kovno. My\nmother, when I made the trip to Druskininkai for a vacation, my mother was living with me.\nShe was taking care of the maid I had, and helping her. I didn't want my mother to be by\nherself. So I gave her money to buy gifts for all her daughters, and travel to visit from one\ndaughter to the other. And the first stop she made was in Jonava, with my sister who had\nfou-four children. Over there, the first day the Jews were lined up from their apartments,\ndriven to the forest and they were kept for several days. My then-70-years-old mother\nrealized that nothing good will come out from the whole thing. And she grabbed Dinah's (ph)\nhand -- my oldest niece, my sister's oldest daughter -- and she pushed herself closer and\ncloser to the forest. And when it became dark, she pulled out Dinah and they walked away.\nThey were hiding during the day in the, in the, in the ravinas (ph). Ravina, that's a English\nword? Between the -- and during the night, they were walking. A woman who couldn't read\nand write, never went to a school, never know what a map means, managed to go from\nJanova to Kovno. And that's how they arrived in Kovno. They were hiding during the day,\nbecause they would have been caught by the partisans and murdered. And if there weren't\nany partisans, some of the decent Christians would have fingered them to the partisans and\ncalled over a murderer. So they arrived in Kovno. So I had already a built-in family of my\nsister Chayke (ph), whose husband was murdered in Slobodka, with her little girl, Raisele\n(ph), and a boy, Alenke (ph). The boy was six years old. The girl was about 12, 14. That was\nthree people. My mother is four, and Dinahle (ph) then is five. So I had five dependents, on\nwhose ability to survive depends on me only. After a while, the rule came out to go into\nKovno ghetto. I, on the other hand, the minute when I heard what happened to my brother-\nin-law and their, and the, the other people -- and that had happened only three, four days\nbefore my arrival. Because they didn't murder them in the first three days of the onslaught. It\nwas on the fourth day; and it was three -- it was seven days since the beginning. I decided to\nwalk to the criminal police headquarters to attempt to speak to this chief of the criminal\npolice, Mr. Pomatitis (ph).\nMy relationship with Pomatitis was as following: while I was the manager, so-called\n*! Ninth Fort\nmanager of the new Christian office products store and his office was buying, and he\npersonally was coming and place orders for me for 5,000 dollar carpets and other expensive\nproperties and put in on the invoice \"office products\" to be sent to his home, it was a\npersonal relationship between him and myself. Since I wasn\u2019t some several times for\nbusiness, and when I became the employee of the government store retail outlet, after the,\nthe Communists took over, because I had to have a job, his wife was coming to the store to\nbuy school supplies for the children. So she told me that he was imprisoned in the Kovno\nprison, and I realized that they had difficulty to survive. So I gave her money to buy the\nschool supplies. I helped her with food, and I sent quite often hilf* -- help -- to her house.\nMy logic was, that when he was rel-- freed from prison from the Communists, and became\nagain the chief of the police headquarters in Kovno, my logic was that she would have told\nhim what I did. He knew who I am. And I think I'll take the, I'll take the risk and go to see\nhim, and ask him if he can liberate my brother-in-law and all the people who were kept in\nthat house. And that's what I did. In order to be secure, because it wasn't safe to walk through\nKovno for the Lithuanian partisans who didn't know who I am and didn't care who I am, I\nhad a distant relative -- a Jewish distant relative -- who was a former volunteer in the original\nLithuanian Army. And that was a big honor by the Lithuanians, and he wore a little button\non his--. With that, we were stopped a couple times going to the, to the police, to this. -- to\nthe chief of police, to Mr. Pomatitis, which was all the way on the, on the, on the new part in\nKovno, quite a distant. But we arrived. There were thousands of Jews waiting in the offices\nfor appointments, and hundreds and hundreds of Lithuanian and other minorities who were\nwaiting for their appointment. But when I informed the desk clerk that I came to see Mr.\nJonas Pomatitis, the chief of the police headquarters, within two seconds the assistant of the\npolice, chief of police of Mr. Pomatitis came out and asked me my business, and I told him.\nHe went back in; and came out and regretted that Mr. Pomatitis does not have the\nopportunity to come and speak to me. But he'll do everything he can, but he thinks 1t may be\ntoo late. And that's exactly what it was. It was too late. On the way back, we were stopped\nagain by Lithuanian partisans, who were picking up Jews from all over.\nIt was still permitted for Jews to walk on the street, but you had to have your star already. Or\nmaybe by then it was not. I don't remember. But it wasn't hard for a Lithuanian to know who\nis a Jew in Kovno. They looked at the at the little button of my friend, and they pushed him\naway; and they took me to the prison, to the yellow prison, which was nearby. They kept me\nthere for several hours. And then, with a group of hundreds of other Jews, they took me on\nthe mountains in a former Russian caserne, a military unit. And they made me sort clothing.\nAnd when the day was over, they sent me back in Kovno. Then the decree came out that all\nJews should go in in ghetto; and I made arrangements with my family to go to the ghetto.\nSince we had -- didn't have anything to transfer, it was for easier for us just to go Kovno to\nthe apartment of my sister. She lived in ghetto in, in Slobodka, where it was supposed to be.\nThe street she lived was supposed to be part of the ghetto. Before we did that, I decided to go\n** Help (Yiddish).\nto my former apartment and see if there was anything I could recuperate. The superintendent\nof the building was a Russian, a old Russian with a big beard. Nobody persecuted Poles. The\nLithuanian had a anger against Poles because of the war between them for so many years.\nBut the Russian were, were kept neutral. Nobody -- the old ones, and not new Russians.\nThey were regular Lithuanian citizens. When I walked in in that apartment, a rifle was\nhanging on the wall. And he explained me, \"You see, I can easily take down the rifle and\nshoot you dead. But I'm not going to do it.\" He returned to me a pair of shoes and some\nunderwear, and a loaf of bread. Because I was extremely well-to-do, and because my friend\nwas a former Polish immigrant, he arranged for me to buy from Vilna the most luxury Polish\nfurniture that only nobility could afford to have it -- or multi-millionaires. It was called\ntonnette (ph) manufacturing. So he became the possessor of all the luxury, with everything I\nhad. And after a few days, we moved into the ghetto. By then, my sister's apartment where\nshe lived was not any more designated to the ghetto, and we had to move in somewhere else.\nAnd since every Jew got something, so my family got also some kind of a location together\nwith other Jews. But in the meantime, we were in ghetto. The ghetto was not completely\nclosed up by then. But Jews were constantly moving in. The German authorities gave us, I\nthink, until August 15th to close in the ghetto, where no more, no, no Jews would be in\nKovno ghetto.\nIt should be in Kovno. Free should move in in the ghetto. I had a dear Lithuanian friend, a\nChris, a Christian Lithuanian friend -- also a former assistant of mine -- by the name of\nKostas (ph). And while I was preparing myself, I was not prepared that Stal-- Hitler will\nattack Stalin and overnight we will be finished. We were prepared that the Russians will take\nover Lithuania and stay aside watching Hitler fighting with England and, and France, and\nnothing will happen in Lithuania. And since the Germans -- the Russians -- might will take\nover my country, I was prepared with my, with my wealth that I could live for a thousand\nyears by having packages of my properties in different houses of different friends, Jewish\nand non-Jewish. Whoever was my friends, I supported some of those families for a couple\nyears, in order for them to -- while they are keeping my properties. Because I figured out\nexactly and precisely, if anything should happen except the war between Hitler and Stalin, I\nwould have enough to live for myself and for all the dozens of families who had my\nproperties. When I say \"myself,\" it's not \u201cT\u2019 personally. It's the five families of my, of my\nsisters. And that could have happened. I left with Kostas a box of British gold pens to be put\nin in fountain pens. In that time, there was no ball-points. It was only -- no ball-points. It was\nonly pencils and pens. I had a box about that big. In that box was a hundred boxes of a\nhundred pen in each box. If that property would have been converted successfully, at the\ntime of the transfer from Russian might to German might to the private -- might, it would\nhave been worth millions. Because nobody could have refused a gold pen to put in in their\nfountain pen, to continue be able to write. I left a whole box of that with Kostas. And when I\ncame, before I got into the ghetto, to pick up from him -- I had dinner with him, and at dinner\nthey served me with a broken fork and I left. I took a droska\u2019\u2019 back and a droska forth. If I\nwould have been caught riding a droska, I would have been shot on the premises. But I did. I\nfelt I had to do it, because by going in 1n the ghetto I thought I would be able to help myself\nsurvive for a long time with that, with that pens. You know what I'm talking about, that pen?\nDo you know what I'm saying?",
        "A: No, you don't.",
        "A: Like a foun-- a pen to be put in, in the fountain pen.",
        "A: The most treasured thing in Lithuania or in Russia was a fountain pen. And the pen, the\nfountain pen, could not function without that pen. I came back to the ghetto. I took in with,\nwith the, with the properties. And I immediately, the next day -- but immediately the next\nday. Most of the Jewish were permitted to come into the ghetto with all their properties, with\nthe furniture. Some of them hired transportation -- horse and buggies -- and came into the\nghetto with everything they had because the Nazis knew that everything the Jewish would\nbring 1n in the ghetto, they'll get it later. It was no problem. The Jewish were not running\nfrom them anywhere. But I came in with nothing, with five mouths. And the first meal you\nmay manage, the second and the third. What you do with the fourth meal? So the following\nday, I immediately walked around the streets, where most of the people -- who had\neverything they needed for the first three, four weeks -- they're hiding, in order not to be\ncaptured to be taken to work. Because there's no guarantee that you'll come back. I was\nwalking around looking to be captured, to be taken to work, because that was the only\nopportunity, by being at work outside the Kovno ghetto, that I may have somehow a\npossibility to have some kind of food to survive and to bring to my family. That was my\nmotivation. A young member of the, of the same apartment where I lived -- there were\nseveral families in one room apartment. I think a young couple. And he followed my\nfootsteps, and he went with me. After walking for 10, 15 minutes, we naturally were\ncaptured by Lithuanian guards. One important factor I forgot to tell you. Can I put it in now?",
        "A: Sure.\nAnd he captured me. And he shouted to call the guard from the other side. And who was the\nguard on the other side? His older brother, who was my best friend while, while , while we\nwere, we were on the, on the free side. And both of them decided in my presence, they were\ndebating should they knock me off, throw me in the river, not knock me off. And both of\nthem decided to let me go back to Kovno ghetto. So with that, I, I survived the first incident\nof destruction. Or, or that wasn't the first incident, but I survived that incident, too. The next\nmorning, I went off with my friend to go to look for work and I was captured. We were taken\nto shant-- to the military casernes which was a tremendous distant. We walked. When we\narrived there, we were half-dead. It was about three, four hundred people altogether. My\nfriend and I was taken to a huge military barrack home. We were given a, a emer --a pail --\nand a brush, and we, we were taken to this to the water foun-- sink. And we were told to take\nwater, and lay down and scrub the floor. So we did. We did. We scrubbed the floor until our\nknees were swollen and bloody. The Lithuanian, the Lithuanian murderous partisan who was\nin charge of us, every three or four hours came in to watch us. In the meantime, he murdered\nup -- he and his friends murdered up half of the Jewish over there because the Jewish didn't\nrealize. They mistakenly believed that they are still dealing with human beings, and tried to\npersuade them not to have them work so hard. And the slightest request of resentment or\nopposition to the hard work, they immediately took them out and murdered them. I didn't\nhave that case. I laid down on my knees, and I rubbed and scrubbed and rubbed and\nscrubbed. And the young man who was with me did exactly the same thing. That affected so\nmuch the murderous Christian Lithuanian guard that he himself run around to the Lithuanian\nhouses and begged food from them, got food from them, came in and throw it on the floor\nfor us to eat. When we were finished with that, five o'clock we were lined up and we arrived\nback in ghetto. It just so happened that the houses we got, they are the territory, the\nneighborhood of the poorest non-sufficient Jewish, who are worth any, nothing to the, to the\nJewish administration anyhow. But value nothing. And that's where we got the houses. So\nthere was a long desert to walk, a desert area, a sandy area, to walk to our quarters. Quiet\n* Pail (Yiddish).\nwalk. We were half-dead already, by the way, while we're arriving. When we arrived at the\ngate, there was already a organized a Ghettowache~ who were checking the gates for the\nJewish who came in. And there was a organized Jewish police community guards, who were\nguarding on the other side, on the inside of the Ghettowache. The cooperation between the\nmurderous guards and the Jewish guards after a while became pretty, pretty decent, pretty\ntolerant after a while. The rule had came out already then by the chief Gestapo commander\nof the ghetto that every Jew who meets a German executive -- civilian or military -- has to\nbow and take off the hat.\nWhen we walked in the Ghettowache, we were told to be careful. If we will meet a German,\nwe should bow and take off our hats if we had. We didn't have hats then. So we're walking\nhalfway. We are starving. And a Jew was not supposed to walk on the sidewalk, so we didn't\nwalk on the sidewalk in the first place. And we were walking already in the desert area when\nsuddenly, from a corner street, two guards, two armed German military men came out\nwalking towards us. When we came close enough to them, we bowed. And they immediately\ntook down their rifles to shoot at us. And I immediately figured out what's going on, what\ntheir thought was. If I would turn around and run back, they would shoot us right away\nbecause they would understand that I'm running away. There's no way how I could run\naway. So I immediately start running backwards, for them to know that my intentions are\ngood, and the other man followed me. After walking backwards 10, 15 steps and we came to\ntheir presence, we bowed very deep. And they laughed and walked away. And then, after a\nwhile, we came home and relaxed and, and had a little to eat. I think the guards -- the\nLithuanian, whom, for whom we worked -- gave us some food to take along with us. And\nthis way, every day I was going out, without waiting for anybody to line up and without\nwaiting to be captured. That young man and I were walking out every morning, and we were\nwaiting to be to be, we were looking for the opportunity to be caught and be taken outside\nthe ghetto where, where eventually we would have had something to eat. The first day, I was\ntaken to a German military unit, to the PX canteen, to wash the floors there and to help put\nthe merchandise on the shelves. When we arrived there, the manager of the canteen -- the\nGerman officer, the Christian German-speaking officer in charge of the canteen -- took the\ntwo of us in the canteen room. The canteen room was a little like a room as, as, as big as that\ncorer there. He put the pail of water in the front of the door, so when somebody would try\nto get in they would have to move the pail of water or, or know that it's something there. He\nwas able to see who would come in. If it's something that he's afraid of, he would open the\ndoor right away. And if it was somebody not important, he would tell them that the floor is\nwet. And immediately gave us food to eat, and told us if anything will try to get in in the\ndoor and he will tell us to remove the pail, we should put the food in a corner nobody, not,\nnot to be seen. And after eating, we cleaned up everything exactly and precisely, and he\ninvited us for a few more days to come.\n*\u00b0 Ghetto watch (German).\nAnd I had a beautiful, comfortable existence for my family and for other people after, for a\nfew days. Then that was over. And I started again, and, and after three, four days being in\nbad areas where I had to come back with almost nothing to eat, I lined to work for the Third\nPolice Brigade in the center of the most luxury area in, in Kovno. And I was working in the\nkitchen peeling potatoes, and, and, and doing all kind of manual work. And I had enough to\nfood to, to eat, and I had enough food to bring for the family and for other people. By then, it\nmust have been already mid, mid, mid, mid -- by end of August, where everything settled in.\nIn the early stages, where it was still permitted to go outside of the ghetto, a great deal of\nJewish young men from Slobodka ghetto -- it was easy to go to Jonava because the highway\nwas there. They're running out every morning to go and get some food. Jordan (ph), the chief\nmurderer of the Gestapo, was waiting for them right by the end of the trip and murdered\nthem all. That was going on for three, four days, until some goyim\u201d\u2019 -- decent goyim -- were\nable to come and to tell the Jewish not to go there, because they lined them up and they\nmurdered them on the spot. I was approached several times by very good friends of mine to\ngo with them and buy food. I didn't had any money or any clothing. Immediately thereafter\nthe creation of the ghetto, clothing was the commodity to exchange. I didn't had any. What\nmy superintendent returned to me was not enough for anything -- just a pair of shoes and a\npair of socks, and some underwear. So I had no reason to go, and that's why I survived this\nmurderous onslaught. When I lined up in the, in the Third Police Precinct, I think by reading\nthe other memories I know that it was Captain Tornbaum\u201d\u2019 who was in charge. After three,\nfour days working there, the, the, the chief himself, the chef himself, for whom we were\nactually working and giving us instructions, didn't bother with us one day or another. He\ngave us the instructions; we did them. He gave us to eat, and, and he had nothing to do with\nus one way or another. But one day, some more soldiers came to us, took one other man and\nme on a, on a, on a step on a attic in, in one of the houses, and took us over to a corner where\ntwo huge sacks of sugar was standing.\nHe instructed us to take the sacks, to bring them to the kitchen. I immediately came over to\nthe sack and started to grab it, and grabbed and grabbed and grabbed, and I couldn't even get\nnear the sack. And the other guy started to argue with him. It's too heavy for him. So he told\nme, \"Stay here.\" He walked over to him, slapped him around several times, and he grabbed\nthe sack and run down like, like, like anything, came back with him upstairs, dragged my\nsack and they came down. Because that that, that soldier realized that I couldn't even , even,\neven, even wrap around the sack. And that was the end of the incident. After a while, it\norganized work brigades for the Jewish to go to the outside of the ghetto working. The best\nunits were in the area where I was working, because there were a lot of, the complete\npopulation was filled up with Lithuanians. They immediately took over the luxury\n\u00b0\u00b0 Gentiles (Yiddish).\n\u201c7 Captain Alfred Tornbaum\napartments from the Jews. And they immediately started to peddle with the Jewish, bartering\nfood for clothing. And the Germans there, after, after a while getting used to the way of their\nslaves, probably keep their eye closed or didn't bother or whatever it is. It was going on a, a\nbusiness like a regular business. Clothing became a very expensive commodity to take out\nfrom Kovno ghetto. But the black marketeers, to them bring in food was not such a big thing.\nTo them was important to buy expensive food -- like saccharine. You know what saccharine\nis? Sweeteners. Or sugar or fat or butter. And that, at one time or another, it was pretty\ncomfortable to get in, bring it in. But after a while, it became extremely, extremely\ndangerous to bring in food of any value. And in that time, the German Nazis put up a\nLithuanian Wachmeister~> who was a tall, slim person. By five o'clock in the afternoon, the\nstreet to enter Kovno ghetto was lined up with thirty-five thousand Jews -- everyone broken\ndown by their brigades, lined up five in a row to march in to the ghetto after a day's work.\nThat Wachmeister was purposely hired to catch the black marketeers. I had a contract in the\nwork brigade, in that time, with a strong Jewish, physically strong Jew by the name of\nChaimke Lipman (ph).\nHe was extremely strong, powerful man. I was buying a sack of potatoes, because a sack of\npotatoes was a tool for me to bring in in Kovno ghetto. And at the entrance , by then a lot of\npeople who were brought in some food were already starving. So by then it was already\nseven, eight months, or five, stx months in the existence of the ghetto. And things changed\ndramatically. And the el-- the elderly people who couldn't go out to work were giving their\nclothes to the black marketeers to bring, to bring in food for them they to have something to\neat. And that Wachmeister had a certain morality in his own frame of mind. If you come in\neven with a big sack of potatoes, it had no monetary value at all. He didn't bother you. If you\nhad the biggest loaf of bread on you, he didn't bother you. If you had barley or any other, or\nany other of the vegetables, or cucumbers, or any other of those fruits or vegetables, it had no\nvalue. He didn't bother you. But he was looking for sugar, butter, saccharine and other, and\nchocolate, and for schnapps -- any other expensive things. So I had a contract with Chaimke\nLipschitz (ph). I was buying a big sack of potatoes. I couldn't even move the sack from the,\nfrom the, from the spot where I bought it. Chaimke, it was after the line-up to go to work,\nChaimke was picking up my sack of potatoes, carried all the five, six miles, carried in the\nghetto. I had my niece waiting with a little buggy, with a little dolly -- and dropped it in the\ndolly. I didn't have much farth-- very far to go with this sack of potatoes because on both\nsides of the ghetto, inside of the ghetto and after the gate, after Jewish walked in there were\ntwo lines of Jewish stretched out with their hands to beg. Among them was the famous\nwriter, Joseph Garr (ph). Within seconds, half of my sack of potatoes was emptied out.\nBecause it was my human duty to give it to them. And the rest of it was easy to haul with a\nlittle more simply, with a little wagon, to my house. And there my neighbors got, and my\nfamily got. I, on the other hand, was carrying a little box of a thousand boxes of saccharine.\nAnd there was five hundred saccharine in each box. That product, brought in in ghetto, was\n*\u00b0 Watchmaster (German).\nconverted to millions, probably, in that time. You could have gotten twenty-five suits. You\ncould have gotten gold and diamonds, all for that little box. So I was carried this -- the box\nwas not as long as these, as light as this, but only that thin. So I was carrying under my arm,\nand dancing like a prima donna with that little box. Except one thing. You do realize that if I\nwere caught with that little box getting in the gate, I would have been brutally beaten up and\nshot right there on the premises. And Chaimke Lipman (ph) would have had no punishment\nat all for bringing in my sack of potatoes, because they saw his sack of potatoes.",
        "A: I think I would like to rest for a few minutes. Can we?\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: One morning, I went out again to be, to be wait, to look for the opportunity to be captured\nand taken to units outside the ghetto that I would be able to bring in some food. I was\ncaptured soon enough. I was taken inside the ghetto to the new ghetto Kommandantur,\nwhere there were a group of barracks -- seven, eight single-story houses. And it happened to\nbe isolated away from the residents of the ghetto. The only next building closest was the\nJewish police precinct. I was taken to the Kommandantur. A Jewish woman by the name of\nLuba, who was working there already, took me to the barn, pointed her finger to a big shovel\nand a broom and an axe and a saw to saw woods, and told me to clean the yard. Then told\nme to clean the toilets. When I was finished with that, I was sawing the woods, and when I\nwas finished with sawing the woods, I was chopping the woods. Luba was the maid for the\nCommandant. The new Commandant was by the name of Ritter. He was there every second\nmorning. He arrived every second morning, one o'clock in the afternoon, stayed there for, for\nthe next, one afternoon, one o'clock in the afternoon. Stayed there until the next and the\nfollowing afternoon, for two afternoons. And one o'clock arrived, his former, his friend\nTschich, who was on duty as Commandant -- both of them, they're former police officers in\nVienna. And while I worked the first day and cleaned the toilets and cleaned out everything -\n- the street, the, the, the, the yard. I realized that thanks to Luba and Esther, the two main\nmaids of the Kommandantur, I will have the opportunity if nothing else will happen to feed\nmy family and several other families. Because this is the outlet that I have the opportunity to\nget food. After a while, I trained myself to be so fast with all the other work that I was\nthrough by half day; and the rest of the half day, I was polishing the boots and the belt\nbuckles and the belts of the soldiers. The Ghettowache contained of about seven, eight\nindividual story combined barracks with two rooms with one entrance. And all entrances\nwas on one side.\nOn the other side was the living room, with a window in the living room but no door to get\nin. After a short period of time, under Luba's and Esther's influence, the Commandant\ninstructed me to bring in all the confis-- almost all the confiscated food that was taken away\nfrom the Jewish in the evening when they came in from the work on the outside brigade,\nworking brigades. And it was all lined up in my hands to take care of and being in charge of\nseparating, to bring in almost all the food in the bedroom of the Commandant Ritter. The\nJewish police precinct was only a short distance away. The Chief of Third Jewish Police\nPrecinct was a certain Kamse (ph), or Tarsis (ph) -- I don't remember. A former good friend\nof mine from the wars, from the days before the war. I had made arrangements with him. He\nwas sending twenty to twenty-four policemen, lined up behind the window of the, of the\nbedroom of the Commandant. I was opening the window, putting up the window or opening\nit, and hand over the first package to the first policeman who was standing behind the\nwindow. He turned and gave it to the next, until it land up in the precinct. And there, the\nCommandant was calling in, the Chief of Police called in the victims from whom the\nmerchandise was taken away and returned to them. After a while, Commandant Ritter\ninstructed me to go to the Chief of Police and tell him that the Jewish who are coming in\nfrom the outside brigade should sew in initials on their bags, on their shopping bags, which\nwas confiscated. So they should be able to get in return their own properties. All, all the\nGestapo used to come and pick up some food for themselves from, from Kovno. They were\ncoming in a small black Volkswagen. Luba 1s the one who prepared everything for them.\nAlso, the food for the Ghettowache -- primarily, the Commandant -- was cooked with the\nconfiscated food. After a while -- but, but after a while, what's going on was while I was\nreturning the food to the Jews, the Lithuanian Ghettowache started to mumble that they don't\nhave enough food. And where would they have enough food? Because some of the food was\nreturned to the victims, and it wasn't enough to cook for them, so they had to bring in foods\nfor themselves. The Wache was hanging on, the Lithuanian and the German Ghettowache\nwas hanging on the premises because the duty around the fences was only for two hours.\nAfter the two hours, they were free for four hours. They couldn't possibly go home and then\ncome back in the four hours, or three hours, or two and two -- I just don't remember exactly.\nIt was not enough time for them to go home and then come back on duty. So they were\nlaying around in the outer barracks recuperating and resting and sewing their stockings, and\ndo any of the other things there necessary while they were waiting to go back on duty. In\norder to prevent any of the guards -- the Jewish or the German -- or any outside German who\nwould come into the ghetto to catch what I'm doing. Because if it would have been\ndiscovered what I'm doing, I would have been the second to be shot. Commandant Ritter\nwould have been the first to be shot. For the period of the time when I was bringing in the\nfood in his bedroom from the, from the barns opposite, he lined them all up in front on the\ngarden, on the lawn up front, and personally conducted with all of them physical exer-\nexercise. Up and down, and down and up, and up and down, and down and up. Some of\nthem were getting so exhausted that they couldn't move every time. And the only time when\nI walked around with my big broom and shovel twice around the yard, that was the signal to\nhim that it's all over, and he released them. That was going on for two days. After that\nTschich came, and he was for two days. Although Tschich, Commandant Tschich, never\nharmed me at all -- he was rather decent to me -- but he told me from the first day that if he,\nif he will ever catch me returning anything to the, of the confiscated food to the Jews, he will\nshot me right there and then. And I followed his rule. He never caught me returning anything\nand everything. When I was finished with the actual duty of helping in the kitchen and\npeeling potatoes and cleaning the latrines, I was shining the buckles and the boots. You can\nbe assured that the most beautiful polished boots in the whole world was Commandant\nRitter's. And his buckle -- so was his buckle. I had invented a special invention. I took a\nglass, a empty glass. And with the back side of the glass I rubbed in the polish on the boot\nand the buckle, let it dry out for awhile. And then, when the, with the, with the, with bottom\nside of the glass I circular rubbed all away. And I'm not sure that if anybody in the world\nwould have had such a beautiful shoes. After a while -- I think it was about four or five\nmonths -- and Ritter and Tschich, the whole unit -- the whole unit moved away. And a new\nunit came in. And the commandant of that new unit was a German by the name of Schultz.\nHe did not instruct me to repeat the same things what I did with Commander Ritter, except\nhe instructed me something else. At that time, the Gestapo permitted to form a Volkskiiche~\u201d\n-- a kitchen to give the starving Jews, those that were starving, to give soup during the day\nfree of charge. And that volksktiche needed food to cook. And there was a former Hebrew\nteacher, I think by the name of Schulgasser (ph), who would come, who was coming with a\nhorse and buggy. And he fill down, the horse, I fill down for him the horse and buggy with\nthe food, and they took away. After a short period of time, I am sure that there was -- again,\nunder the influence of Luba and Esther -- he, he instructed me to go to the Chief of the Third\nPrecinct, Police Precinct, Mr. Tomason (ph), and tell him he should arrange that Schulgasser\nshould have a second horse and buggy similar to the first horse. If the first horse was a white\nhorse, so the second one should be a white horse. And stay a distant away. And when he was\nfilled up with the first one and the first one came out from the territory of the Ghettowache\nterritory, to bring in the second one and filling in the second one. Schultz, at the time when it\nbecame already very, very difficult, and at a time when it was known that\nObersturmbannfiihrer Goecke\u201d\u2019 is coming to liquidate the Kovno ghetto -- and Goecke was\nknown by all Jews that he was the liquidator. He started from the furthest part in Russia, and\nwhen the German armies were stepping back toward Germany, he was liquidating ghetto\nafter ghetto after ghetto. At the time it was known that Goecke is coming with units of\nliquidating the Kovno ghetto, I was helping sew a rucksack for the Commandant Schultz to\nput in Luba's blonde four, five years old boy and carry him over through the gates at night\nwith the flashlight of the signals. They had flashlights with three different colors, that there\nwas a signal, a specia-- a separate signal that the commandant is going, to better to go climb\nthrough the ghetto and take the baby in the village, where one of the Lithuanian guards --\nthey are by then already in the beginning of '44, 1944, even some of the worst murde--\nLithuanian murderers became already friendly with Jews because they were looking already\nfor a ticket. So one of the Lithuanians offered to survive and Luba's son, and the\nCommandant Schultz carried over personally the son to the Lithuanian's house.\nAfter a short period of time, the Ghettowache disappeared, and a new Ghettowache arrived.\nAnd they didn't have anymore the quarters in Kovno ghetto. They had the quarters already in\n*\u2019 Common kitchen (German).\n*\u00b0 Lieutenant Colonel (German); Wilhelm Goecke\na school, in a former school outside the Kovno ghetto which is about 15, 20 minutes by, by\ncar away from the ghetto. There I was again called in to be the slave of the, of the\nGhettowache kitchen. It was the unit of Obersturmbannfuthrer Goethe -- Goecke. It was the\nunit of the Obersturmbannfthrer Goecke, who arrived for the process of liquidating the\nKovno ghetto. He immediately converted the Kovno ghetto to a Kon, to a\nKonzentrationslager\u2019\u2019 Kaunas. And the restrictions became extremely severe for the Jews in\nevery level. I and all the other slaves for the Ghettowache were immediately taken away\nfrom the ghetto, and they built special bungalows, special quarters, upstairs of this of this\nschool for us to be there and to stay there and not to go back to the ghetto. By then it was a\nbig kitchen with maybe several hundred SS guards, and it required more people to work.\nAnd quite a few Jews managed to get themselves in the brigade. And while they were there,\nthey were locked in together with me, and they became permanent laborers, slave laborers,\nfor the Ghettowache. The, the chef of the kitchen was Ober, or Unter, or Oberscharfiihrer*\u201d\nBlaufuchs. He was a, a, a, a, they had -- he was not the chef. He was the head of the kitchen.\nThe chef was somebody else. And he was the direct boss of Luba and Esther, and direct my\nboss. I continued with the same duties of cleaning the toilets, cleaning the rooms, peeling\npotatoes, peeling beans for the kitchen, and all other manual labor work. In addition to that,\nWagner was one of the, of the PX managers. And he had a bicycle, and he constantly\ninstructed me to clean his bicycles. The physical appearance of the location was as\nfollowing: a small walking gate was from the main street.\nWell, about 15 blocks further was the Ghettowache, the ghetto. And it was the low, lower\ngate in the ghetto. The ghetto had two entrances. By then, they built a second entrance which\nwas Closer to the school where the Ghettowache was located. And there, there was a constant\nguard standing with a rifle on the sidewalk of the, of the walking entrance. And any time\nGoecke was about to arrive about one o'clock in the afternoon, that guard was giving signals\nthat Goecke is arriving. And with those signals, even high ranking officers of the SS\nattempted, if they could, to shy away from the premises, because nobody wanted to stumble\ninto Goecke. The only person who had a strong influence on him in a relationship to the, to\nthe, to the dining room was Unter-- Oberscharftthrer Blaufuchs, the head of the kitchen,\nbecause he was putting food in his stomach. I, by habit, didn't want to get rich. I couldn't get\nanymore to my family at all. I couldn't do anything. I didn't want to go out and, and, and do\nbusiness on the black market. As several Jews, from time to time -- arranged by the admin--\nJewish Judenrat\u2122 -- they're coming to the Wache to, to beg and to buy themselves food.\nBecause every outside work brigade had the opportunity to buy food, except the airport. And\na lot of people who worked on the airport get passes to go to the other work brigades, in\norder to be able to get themselves food; because the airport slave labor was the real slave\nlabor. And the whole existence of the ghetto depended on the airports. If the general in\n*' Concentration camp (German).\n* Sergeant (German).\n* Jewish Council (German).\ncharge of the airports would decided to liquidate the airports brigade, probably the ghetto\nwould have been liquidated immediately. So it was very important for the Judenrat to have\nthe, the, the Flug-- the Fliighafen\u201d* functioning. One time somebody asked me to buy\nmedicine for a child. I just don't remember what it was. And I walked out outside of the\ngates, outside of the premises, in the next gentile house, Christian house, where everybody\nwas communicating there constantly except I. I never did, but to do somebody a very\nimportant favor, I did walk out. The premises of the, of the, of the, of the school was that on\nthe front on the main street was the walking entrance, but on the side street was the driving\nentrance. And the gate was constantly open to driving entrance, because there was a danger\nthe Goecke may drive 1n any time. And how would it be that gate is closed, and he had to\nbeep, blow the horn to be let in? So it was constantly open.\nI walked out to that house next to, close enough to the Ghettowache, and discussed with the\nfarmer, with the gentile family about the question I was, I came to ask. And I, I was about\nready to go back, and two Lithuanian policemen arrived. And one of them sat down to write\nthe protocol to take me to the Gestapo where I would have been immediately shot because\nthey got a bonus for bringing me there. And the other was walking around from door, from\nthe door to the middle of the room, while the first one was writing the protocol. I was\nstanding as shivering like, like, like, like hell for a few seconds, and then it dawned on me,\n\"What am I shivering?\" I looked around, and I saw that the door was a push-out from the\noutside. I waited on the next turn when the guard, the policeman, was coming closer to the\ninside. And I run to the door. I pushed with my foot. I start running. They shoot at me, but\nthey didn't got me. And I was immediately, through the open wide gate, in on the premises, I\nimmediately came to Luba. She immediately informed Oberscharfthrer Blaufuchs and he\nwithin seconds took me, put me upstairs, put a guard over there. And a few minutes later, the\ntwo Lithuanian came to look for me, and he chased them out. His chasing them out was it\nwas only a momentary victory, a moment, a momen-- a momentarily victory. The higher\npowers over him were of the Gestapo. And those two Lithuanian policeman were, were the\nemployees of the Gestapo. It was their business to capture the Jewish on the outside so they\ncould have reported to the Gestapo and get, and Gestapo could have come and find me there.\nAnd Obersturmbann-- Ober, Oberscharfthrer Blaufuchs could not have helped a bit in that\ncase. But within seconds, he lined up a closed truck, got two guards shipped out with me\ninside, took me to the ghetto. And in the ghetto, where will they find me? The next day, I\ncame back to work. At one time I was called in, in, in, in, in Blaufuchs's apartment to clean\nhis apartment, because his wife was coming to visit him. And while I was cleaning the floor\nand everything else, she arrived. And when she arrived, he hardly kissed her and introduced\nher to me and said, \"David, du kannst ausstrecken deine Hand zu meiner Frau.\"\u201d? Tan\nshake hands with his Frau. And I shook hands with her. My job was finished then, and, and,\nand I disappeared.\n** Airport (German).\n> \"David, you can shake hands with my wife.\" (German)\nThe, the, the liquidation of the Kovno ghetto got closer and closer and closer by the day. It\nwas going on by the day. It took probably about five, six months from the time Goecke\narrived until he started to liquidate. All that depended on the front. If the front got closer,\nthen he liquidated faster. In the meantime, he started to organize the Konzentrationslager\nKovno. In the meantime, he had the Kinder\u201d\u2019 and the woman and the old people liquidation,\nwhere all the children and all the old people were in one day lined up and taken to be\ndestroyed. In that action, my little seven years old nephew and my almost 75 years old\nmother was taken out. They told me afterwards. It's a German Wachmeister, one of the units.\nWhen he came back, cried when he told me in torturous murder, how they destroyed the\npeople, the old people. Mothers, mothers, mothers, mothers were, were, were, were falling,\nkneeling for them, kissing their feet, not to take their child. So they killed the mother with\nthe child. They were taking children. The main action of liquidating, it was in the front of the\nthree big brick buildings. They were taking children, the, the, the Ukrainian and Lithuanian\nmurderers were going up to the third floor. It was a three story building. They were finding\nchildren on the top floor, and dropping them down through the window to the Ukrainian or\nLithuanian guard who was standing downstairs on the street. And he picked them up and\nknocked his head on the wall, choking up, until the child was dead. The German\nWachmeister who told me the brutality told me how a woman was find, a elderly woman\nwas find in a toilet. The toilets were wooden house, wooden bungalows-like. And she was\nhiding, and it was almost all over. And she mistakenly stuck out her head to see if it 1s all\nover and the Gestapo man saw her. They were walking with big sticks exactly for that\npurpose, with wide, with wide handles. My stick doesn't have a wide handle, but their stick\nhad special wide curves in order to grab a, a person's neck and pull them like that. So the\nWachmeister cried for me, in telling me how brutally elderly woman was dragged with the\nstick on the sidewalk until she was dead before she was thrown in the truck. When I came\nback after, when they started to liquidate the ghetto and brought me back in the ghetto, my\nsister told me that that old lady was my mother. That's the way she was, she was taken out.\nAt the start of the liquidation of Kovno ghetto, the last few days Goecke, personally, and,\nand, and Berman (ph) or Breller (ph), his assistant -- I don't really remember him. In the\nbook their whole names, but it's not important for us. They, personally, they're driving\naround the areas where groups of young people they're trying to escape. Everybody knew it's\nthe end. And they caught them and shot them on the streets, on the field -- wherever they\ncaught them -- without any mercy. Immediately, they murdered them. I was brought in in\nKovno ghetto, back in KZ Kovno, back to be prepared for the liquidation. But then they sent\nin a new group of guards, and that new group of guards needed service. They needed to\nprepare straw, straw mattresses for them. And I was called in with the other former workers\n\u00b0\u00b0 Children (German).\nto prepare the sacks for them. In those days they were building -- there was a barn where the\nwood was located, and all the tools. It was old rotten wood. They were building new\nbarracks up to the last minute to prevent the Jewish to go through the, to cut through, dig out\nand, and -- because the wood was all then rotten, to, to break it out and go, and go through.\nSo I, I, I, I, with the five, six other Jewish workers there, practically the last couple days\nbefore the liquidation of our camp, attempted to do that. We attempted to dig out in the side\nthat was still rotten. You pull it out from under the earth. You dug out the earth. And there\nwas a religious Jew by the name of Portnoy (ph). He had already his family outside, and he\nhad prepared his place for himself outside. And when he noticed that, he came to the kitchen\nand informed on us. So you should see this scene, how the cook, and the assistant cook, and\nWagner and, and, and, and Blaufuchs all came out to help us dig back in, so those who\nwould see and kill us immediately they should not be able to see anything that were not\nsmooth. It was not smooth. There was a guard, Schmittus (ph). One of the guards was a man\nby the name of Schmittus. I was told that he was a Ger\u2014a, a, a, Ger, a Volksdeutsche\u2019\u2019 in\nBudapest. You know what a Volksdeutsche, Volksdeutsche is? And the Nazis recognized\nVolksdeutsche as Deutsche\u2019.\nSome of the Volksdeutsche were the worst murderers, and some of them were decent people\n-- like all people are bad and good, except the good were in a very small minority. Probably\namongst 10 thousands, you could have find one or two decent people. Schmittus tried, made\nso many efforts to help me. Schmittus was constantly arguing with Blaufuchs against the\ntreatment of, the bad treatment of the Jews. But he was arguing with the wrong person,\nbecause Blaufuchs didn't have any better, any other opinion than he had. The day before we\nwere liqui-- before we were taken back to Kovno ghetto, and few days before the total\nliquidation, I was doing my work and Wagner called me over. His bicycle was standing in\nthe front of the entrance to the kitchen. The entrance of the kitchen was here, and the open\ngates to drive in was here. And Goecke, when he was driving in, was driving in to, to the\nother wall, turn around, faced his car to get out, and walked to the kitchen. So Wagner told\nme to clean his bicycle suddenly. It was the hour in the day when nobody would expect\nGoecke to come to the dining room. He had his own headquarters in, in the ghetto, and he\nhad his own headquarters in the Gestapo headquarters. He used to come to that, to the guard\nunit only for dinner, for, for lunch. And it was about 11 o'clock in the morning, or 11:30,\nwhen nobody would ever suspect or dream that he would come. The guard who was\nconstantly stationed on the, on the front of the main street with the sidewalk entrance was a,\na, a, a -- also a Volksdeutsche. A little confused human being, you know, but a very decent\nperson. We taught him that when you see danger -- Goecke, or Gestapo, or any other officer\n-- he should knock on the sidewalk with the rifle and shout twice, \"Yaveh (ph) v'yavo.\"\n*\u2019 Ethnic German (German).\n*> German (German).\n* This phrase (actually pronounced \u201cYa-aleh\u201d v\u2019yavo in Hebrew), meaning \u201cHe\u2019s arising\nand coming,\u201d comes originally from part of a Hebrew prayer. In the ghetto, \u201cya-aleh\u201d\nThat's the Hebrew words: \"He comes, he's here.\"\nAnd when he shout, he couldn't pronounce both words, but \"Yahveh\" he remember very\nwell. But when he shouted, \"Yahveh!\" everything disappeared from the, from the front area.\nThat day he wasn't there. Somebody else -- a stranger who was not under our influence. And\nWagner told me to clean his bicycle. And I removed my beautiful blue jacket with the stars\nof David on the front and the back in order not to make dirty, and I took the bicycle. I was\nwalking with the bicycle from the area where Wagner gave it to me towards the, towards the\nbarn, where I had my tools. And I passed by the area of the open gate and in drives in\nGoecke with a lady. Turns around. Gets out of the car. Walks over to me. Pulls out a gun.\nAnd he was ready to shoot. And I, and I stood up like a military person. I clicked my feet. I\nwas wearing galoshes. In July, I was wearing galoshes. But I made movement like I'm\nclicking my feet, and I shouted loud and clear, \"Obersturmbannfuhrer Goecke! Das ist nicht\nmein Schuld -- mein Schuld, dass ich keine Star of David habe. Der Wagner verlangte ich\nsoll sein Fahrrad saubermachen, (and) um nicht zu verschmutzen die Jacke mit die gelbe\nStern ... hab ich runtergenommen und ich ging mit dem Fahrrad zu der Bahn um meine\nGezeig zu nehmen.\"\u201d\u201d In that moment, he lowered down the revolver. And within, in, in that\nmoment, Blaufuchs was already near him. That's the only person whom he'll listen to.\nWagner was on the other side, and other high ranking SS officers. There was a new man who\ncame a few days ago -- a huge person, a SS officer. He probably was the head of the\ntransportation. And he saw what's going on, and everybody testified on my behalf, that I was\nnot attempting to escape with the bicycle. I was just going to the other area to clean it. It, it\ntook minutes, and Goecke gave a shout to me, \"Verschwinden!\" And I immediately\n\"verschwind.\u201d You know what \u201cverschwind\u201d\u2019 1s -- disappear. And I disappeared. He went to\nhave lunch. He walked out from his lunch. Blaufuchs was right behind him. And he shouted,\n\"Wo ist die Jude mit die blaue Jacke?!\" And I immediately was there standing, like, like,\nlike \"Attention!\" And he delivered this small speech to me, and he explained that the \"Blaue\nJacke ist beschlagnahmt.\"\u201d\u201d It's confiscated. And again shouted to me, \"Andreten! > AndI\nwalked away, and he drove away. And the same day, we were taken back to the ghetto and it\nstarted the liquidation.\nmeant \u201cbigshot\u201d and was used by ghetto inhabitants to announce warnings; for example,\nan approaching German guard.\n* \"Lieutenant Colonel Goecke, it is not my fault, my fault that I have no Star of David. Mr.\nWagner demanded that I clean his bicycle, and so as not to stain the jacket with the yellow\nstar ... I have taken it off and I went to the rail with my stuff.\u201d (German)\n*! \u201cWhere is the Jew with the blue jacket?\u201d (German)\n* \u201cBlue jacket is confiscated.\u201d (German)\n* Attention (German)\nI arrived Saturday night back in Kovno, never to go back to the, to the Ghettowache. I slept\nover the night. I, I had my niece then. My mother and the baby, Alenke was already\nmurdered. By the way, people told me when I arrived in the ghetto that that was the day\nwhen Goecke murdered, caught and murdered four or five group of young people -- a total\nof six, seven people per group. About thirty, forty people were murdered that day. And that's\nwhen they permitted me to be saved from Goecke, in a situation like that. Couldn't happen in\na million years anything like that. And Sunday morning the Wache started already to catch\nus and to put us in a cage. Shortly before I left the Kovno ghetto, two or three weeks before,\nto to and never came to come back to work for the Ghettowache, I noticed that Jewish were\nbuilding near the Kaisergasse (ph), a gate \u2014 a, a, a fence, a fenced a, a, a wire fence, a wire\nbu-- a wire partition like -- four or five times as big as this here, on the field in the ghetto.\nAnd somehow I thought maybe, maybe, maybe that will be to, to drive in Jews before the\nliquidation. Anyhow, Sunday morning the liquidation started, and I was caught by one of the\nnew guards. And -- no, I'm sorry. I was -- I begged my sister to go with me whatever will be\nhappened, and my niece to go with me. But she got permission to go in a bunker which one\nof the most prominent Jewish people build. She was a friend of the man's wife, and they\npermitted her to stay until. And we figured it's only for three or four days, and 1n three or\nfour days Russians were coming. And they permitted my niece, after a while, to going in.\nAnd while I was running to look for directions they had -- Mongrel (ph) was his name --\ncame out from the bunker and invited me, too. I am a, Iam a breathing difficulty.\nI was then, and I am today. So after being there for a couple of seconds, the bunker was built\nfor maybe 12, 14 people. By when I came in -- the last one, I and my niece there was already\n-- | was already the 67th or the 68th. It was burning hot in July. It was the first week in July,\nso how long could I have stayed in that place? After a few seconds, I started to cough and I\ngot out. I forced Dinah, my niece, also to get out. Somehow, she listened to me. And we\nwere captured right away on the street, and put in the enclosed wire fence that was fenced.\nWe were one of the few in the beginning, but as the day progressed, it became thousands of\nthem. People were stepping on each other already. We were laying there for three days and\nthree nights. On the second day, the transportation of the Kovno ghetto took place in three\ngroups. The first group went out Sunday afternoon without any incident. They went out, and\nthey were taken to Germany. The second group was my transportation. But the Jewish that\nthey find on the street, they lined them up and safely under the fence. But they were going\nwith Jewish men, Jewish policemen, from building, house to house, fish out the people in the\nhiding places. And there, the woman were laying nude just in a garden, and the men were\npractically nude, and brought them all to the to the encampment. So from an area that it\ncould house maximum a hundred or 200 people, there were already two-- 3000 people\nconcentrated. And it became a tremendous situation. You had to do your bowel movements\nright there and then on the premises because you couldn't go anywhere. And the stink from\nthe smell from the bowels was not to be believed. I think we were laying there for three, four\ndays or more, because they couldn't get transportation for us to go to the ghetto, to go to the,\nto the train. Anyhow, in those days, Schmittus was crawling from body -- person to person\nover the people to look for \"the David.\" Iam \"the David.\" I am David. And when he find,\n\u201cWho would know is \u2018the David\u2019? Only the few Jews who worked with me knew that they\ncalled \u201cthe David.\u201d There must have been fifty Davids there. Who would know? He finally\nfind me. And when he find me, he told me that I, when, to-- tonight or the next night, they\nwake us all up to march out. And at that time, I should try to be the very last line, and I\ninstructed my niece to be the very one with me. And other people who were near me, I\ninstructed them the same way. He said, by being the very last line, he and Wagner and two\nother additional people will close up the line of guards. They will be the last guards. And as\nsoon as they get out from the ghetto, I should escape.\nHe said naturally I should not get concerned that all four of them will, will kneel and shoot at\nme. But they wouldn't shoot at me. I should keep running. I instructed my sister, my niece to\ndo that, too. I was ready to two eventualities. I wanted to escape anyhow. I was ready, I\nhoped for two things may happen while I'm escaping. Maybe I'll escape and be an escapee;\nor while escaping I'll be shot in the rear. Without pain, I'll be dead. I happened to walk out\nSunday morning in a clean, bright shirt. And while laying the few days 1n the field, I find the\nbrother of my brother-in-law, who happened to have had a brown shirt, a dark shirt. And I\nexchanged with him. I gave him my shirt, and he gave me his shirt. I, I, I had a silly logic\nthat if I'll have to run in the middle of the night, the guards may see my white shirt and shoot\nme. The brown shirt, they will not see, because I planned to run out. I had a German bag, a\nbread bag. It's a linen bread bad by a hanging strap where they were carrying their loaf of\nbread, and I had a razor there and a couple of small things, and that's all. I was ready to\nescape, to be shot. That's all I wanted. I felt I'll never wind up in concentration camp. And I\ninstructed my niece to do that, too. When they marched out, about four o'clock in the, early\nin the morning, I tried to be the last line, and I was about in the last line. I was about the\nclosest to the right side to be able to run in a, in a, in a private house garden. It was through a\nlittle gate. I planned to do that, but I realized that Schmittus was not in the back and he's not\nthe one to decide in the first place where he would stay. And all he did is tried to sell me a\nbill of goods I should try to save myself and believe him. And with that, I may, I may\nsurvive. And that's all that he wanted: to help me to survive. As soon as we walked out,\nChrista Kartigas (ph) took us -- I think 1t was Christa Kartigas. We walked out maybe twenty\nsteps from the ghetto. I saw an open gate, that little pri-- that little gateway to a private\nhouse. You, you know what I mean. I ran in, and I ran through the garden. And a Lithuanian\nwas working in the garden, and he followed me and he caught me. And I loosened myself,\nand he remained with the same jacket that was supposed to be \u201cbeschlagnahmt\u201d and the\nsleeves of the shirt, in his hands. And I was already away from him. And I kept running and\nrunning and running, until I came to a big fence that was \u2014 the, the Lithuanian government\nhad had built up a huge animal, animal in -- animal, animal treatment for -- how do you call\nit? A, a\u2014to, to, to cure animals. Oh, my God. I forgot. I forgot.",
        "A: Ok, yeah. And it was a huge tall gate. And I couldn't, I couldn't possibly climb over the -- in\nmy height. It just happened that a pile of garbage was laying right there where I find myself.\nI climbed up on the garbage, climbed over the gate. And halfway on my -- halfway to the\nbuilding, I see there are hundreds of German soldiers. So I ran back, climbed over -- from the\ninside, it was easier to climb because there are the two planks, the bottom plank and the top\nplank. It was easy for me to climb back in, and I continued walking. I walked all day long.\nAnd a tremendous rain storm broke out. And I hid in the corn to hide myself from the rain.\nHow much I can hide myself from the rain, I don't know. But I, I was, I was like a animal,\nreally. My mind was like a animal. And the four guards, when I escaped with -- and, and,\nand when I walked out from the corn, my body was all smeared up in clay. And I, I slept the\nnight over in a, in a, in a, in a forest. And the next morning, I continued. By then I was\nhungry and thirsty, and I was making up my mind which house I should attempt to go in and\nask for something. And I noticed a big looking house, a big building, and I thought maybe,\nmaybe, maybe a owner of property -- they call it pomeshchik,\u201d in that time -- and most of\nthem were Poles. They, they're land owners. The rich land owners were Poles. And the Poles\nwere not so hot with the Lithuanians, and he may have been willing to help me, give me\nsome food. So I started to go to that house, because I thought it's the owner of a rich man,\nbecause it's a bigger house than the average. When I came close enough, I noticed it's the\nNinth Fortification. And I went back, and I started again walking. About noontime, I fall\nasleep -- weak and hungry, and smeared out in clay like, like , like a stray cat. And while I\nfall asleep, I heard voices of children -- Lithuanian voices saying, \"Zydu\u2019\u2019! Zydu! Ectu (ph)\nGestapo!\" -- \"Run to Gestapo!\" So I got up, and I went away. I, I, I, I just didn't had enough\nstrength to continue from hunger and thirst. So I walked in, in a yard of another house. I took\nthe next best house which to walk in, and I walked tn. It just so happened that the house was\nup front, and the barn was all the way in the back. So it took me a distant to go to the barn.\nAnd halfway to the barn, the whole barn was full with German soldiers retreating from the\narmy down the hill. And the proprietor was a old Russian farmer, a gentile, Christian. And\nhe saw me, measured up the situation right there and then, came over towards me and\nembraced me like he was, he caught a new relative who just came to visit him. Pushed me\nout from the area, walked in the house, gave me a piece of bread. And I continued walking.\nI walked for quite a distance. Then I came to a highway where a lot of Lithuanians were\nescaping from the war. The war was coming nearer, closer and closer. And I lined up and I\nand I lined myself up with the horse and buggy of a Lithuanian with a family, and he gave\nme something to eat and let me walk with him. But he told me if the Germans should come\nand look for, he will tell me -- he will tell them -- that Iam a Jew. So after I relaxed and\nthought on this moment for a few minutes, I continued to walk by myself on the upper hill of\n* Landowner (Russian)\n\u00a9 Jew (Lithuanian)\nthe, of the forest-like highway. It was no forest. It was little trees. And towards late at night,\nagain it started to rain, and I was terribly wet. I walked in, in a house. It was a man and two\nwomen -- brother and two sisters. They gave me milk and bread. I, I ate fancy foods all over\nthe world. Nothing tasted as good as that bread and milk. They took me to the barn. They\ndug out a, a wagon full of hay which they had prepared from the field. They put me in the, in\nthe hay, and they covered it back up. I slept half a night, and early in the morning I continued\nto walking. I walked all day, practical all day. Again hungry, without any food. And\nsuddenly I'm facing three roads: one, two, three. And what do I do? Where do you go? So I\npick a grass. You know when you were a child, a grass -- \"You love me, you don't love me.\"\nAnd I pulled the grass, and I designated this one is this grass, this one is this one. And it fall\non the one I went. I went originally to the straight one. And I continued. Late in the evening,\nI came to a house and the woman took me in and told me that her husband is hiding Jews in\nthe forest, and I should. After she gave me to eat, she, she sent me upstairs 1n the attic. And\nthis early in the morning, he came home, he woke me up, and we started to go to the forest.\nHe was looking for signals. He was removing trees and looking for signals. And we find\nafter a while he did find a signal. And the most amazing thing, in the midst of the darkest\narea, well, now you couldn't see any further, any further, he, he bend down two trees, two\nbranches. And we walked in, and we find ourself in the midst of a field with Jewish men and\nJewish women and children. Was a group of maybe 20, 30 people. And they had dug out a,\na, a hole and covered with, with, with grass. And anytime there was a danger, everybody\nwalked down in the hole and, and, and they stayed down there. I stayed there for the first\nday, the second day. It was already in mid-July. That was already the third week, or the\nsecond.",
        "A: We have only four or five minutes?",
        "A: Little bit. Anyhow, then we had to move from there, because the front was coming closer\nand the Germans were coming closer. Then we, we, we couldn't get anymore, the farmer\ncouldn't get to us. And we didn't had any food. We had to go by, we had to go in turns to the\nfarmers to beg for food. And there were German soldiers walked out from one side of the\nhouse, and we walked in the whole, in the other side of the house. Both had the same\npurpose -- to beg for food. And after three, four weeks -- after three weeks, exactly on July\nAth, the war was over, and I was liberated. And I came back to Kovno, and that's it.",
        "A: I don't know what details I can add, except for while I -- and I immediately took off to go\nback to Kovno, and I didn't wait for the ceremonies and parades. And while there was a\ncurvy highway, and while I was going down the curve, suddenly a, a, a rifle is in my\nstomach. I lift up my hands and shouted who I am. And the soldier removed his rifle. It was a\nRussian soldier, and he didn't know what to speak to me. I didn't know how to speak to him.\nBut he called over a Jewish soldier, and I told the Jew who I am. And he cried and all the\nother soldiers cried, and everybody else cried then. After a couple of hours crying, I, after a\nhalf hour, I relaxed and went back to Kovno, and went, went to Kovno.",
        "A: My first encounter with the liberating army, yes. That were my first encounter.",
        "A: I was liberated August first. And I, and I made the arrangements. I met Jonas Petronis, my\nformer associate and my former friend, who became again the manager of all the office\nproduct properties. And within the first two weeks, I was walking around from garbage can\nto garbage can in the Lithuanian houses to try to get some food. And from the day I met him,\nI became a multi-millionaire. I became so rich. He was taking up properties, car loads of\nproperties, from the Communist hands -- which was originally my own merchandise, or part\nof my own. And I was selling it on the black market. I was walking out on the street with a\npencil in my hand. I had three Jewish with big suitcases standing behind me in the gate, and\na young officer was running by, and behind him two soldiers, Russian officer, behind him\ntwo soldiers. And we passed him by. And then he cursed, and cursed word, \"Blatzky rod!\nKarandashi, Karandashi!\"\"\u00b0 A pencil. It dawned on him what I have. And he run back, and\nhe saw my pencil and what, wanted to know how many I have and how much, how many I\nhave and how much. And he shouted to the Russian, to the soldiers to come over. And they\nshould pour over all the money in my suitcase, and I poured over all the -- within a week's\ntime, I became a multi-millionaire. It's went all to the devil, but that's beside the point. I\nopened a kitchen immediately and hired two Jewish woman to cook for the hungry Jews --\nfree of charge, naturally, knowing myself the way I am. And I was running around in the\ncity, and I selling, inviting people to come and eat. I met a rabbi, a older man, Mordchai\nPagramanski (ph). And when I was liberated, he came to the, to the forest where we were.\nWhat happened to him is not to be believed. They decided -- the Germans were, were exp--\nthrowing bombs over the buildings, to destroy the hiding Jews. And when it came to his part,\nthey decided that then, the officer said, \"Mittagszeit, Feierabend.\"*\u2019 And they stopped, and\nthey went to eat, and they didn't came back the same day. So they decided to escape, and\nthey delegated him to go to the German guards to ask permission to run away. And while\n* \u201cPuck your family! Pencils! Pencils!\u201d (Russian)\n\u201c7 \u201cMidday, break time.\u201d (German)\ngoing to look for the German guard, he stumbled in on somebody, and that somebody was\nthe German guard, dead drunk. And he decided if the guard 1s dead drunk, he does not have\nto ask him permission. And they all started to go. And they marched dozens of kilometers,\ncrossing over the whole German Army, with the big beards -- seven, eight Jews with the big\nbeards. And they all arrived at the same place.\nEnd of Tape #3\nConclusion of Interview\n"
