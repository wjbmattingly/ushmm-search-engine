        "A: I was born in Bayreuth in Bavaria in the as they say. That had a great influence on my\nearly youth only when Mother was Latvian at the. There was always singers coming and staying\nin our house and things like that, and started later to resent it terribly much because I\nhated...started to hate. Couldn't be helped. I had one little episode when I was a little girl. I met\nthis fabulous old gentleman who looked like Wagner. I feel into his arm when I was 12 years old.\nHe was a poet and a writer, and he was a Latvian and so far he was a friend of Wagners and\ncame to rehearsals in Bayreuth, and so I met him and he went off to Munich, sent me tickets. He\nwas wonderful. And one day he called me in the street and said I have to come. I said why. He\nsaid, \"I have to talk to you.\u201d So I run. There was this old man pacing up and down and he said,\n\"When I die, all these things, they'll die with me.\u201d I said, \"What?\" He said, \"About When I heard,\nI said, \"I don't want to hearing anything about Wagners. But he said you have because with me\nhe dies. And he's die I don't want to have anything to do with the Wagners. so far that I just\ndidn't want to have anything about them. That's strange but...but what can you do when you're 16\nyou know.",
        "Q: Tell me...tell me about your childhood. You had an unusual one.",
        "A: I was...I was a...We were the fifth, fourth and fifth children of my mother. We had a\nwonderful, wonderful. All of them. Very happy family life. Absolutely. In Bayreuth. My mother\nwas absolutely . My father was more of poet. Very nice. And then when I went to Munch I fell\nfor that because my father had taken the drawings of a child to a Professor and he said, \"Ah,\nshe's very gifted. Why don't you send her? So I had the first permission when I was 16. When\nthey called me back, I was too young and I could go again. But Munich was very important. But\nthe second time, I was in Munch...I remember the first time feces on the wall and Jews. That\nwas the start of Hitler. And he...1t was terrifying. But we didn't...crazy people. They thought it\nwas crazy people, but it wasn't. And it went on. And then in my studio where I worked as a\npupil...there was a young girl, beautiful girl and she came one day with a hack and cross, with a\nswastika. I said, \"What are you going...\u201d She said, \"Oh, one of my boyfriends gave it to me.\u201d I\nsaid, \" You better don't wear it because the has this hack and cross.\u201d So for me she kept it back,\nbut then she wear it again, and that was the beginning. Hack and Cross. Swastika. All over. And\nit took away the joy. And then I got anonymous telephone calls. I should go to this place far out\nof Munich and these were the people I had refused to meet and be friends with, and they took...",
        "A: Explain. I don't understand.",
        "Q: Well, I...I got a telephone call for example, \"Be at 9 O'clock at Corner, Munich at 9\no'clock. And then telephone thing. I didn't go of course. And the next thing is I got a letter that\nmy father died and I should go immediately to Bayreuth. I knew also that wouldn't be true. This\nwas the revenge of certain young punks because I refused to walk and go out with them you\nknow. So that it was the beginning that I knew I was...I was on the list you know. But...and I was\non their list. But of course, I didn't bother. knew that I married and went to Holland and I forgot\nabout. But I couldn't forget about, because I think I mentioned that I married in 1922 and in 23\nwe visited Bayreuth. And in Beareth, there's a beautiful old Beareth opera house which got\nWagner to Beareth. offered him that house, but, of course, it was not big enough...to Doctor\nWagner. But it was gorgeous...Beareth....and I loved it and I showed it to my husband and then\ndown that opera...little opera hill came down a troop...a troop of singing boys with the old flag.\nand everything. And my husband had a terrible temper and he wanted to go over and tear that\nflag down. But my father kept him back, said, \"Don't. These are only stupid boys.\u201d My husband\nwas very prophetic. It was 1923. He said, \"How can you say that? In 10 years these boys will be\nyour judges, will be your teachers, will be your...whatever it is.\u201d And he was right. Ten years\nafterwards. 23 to 33. He knew it. He said it to my father. But we knew and I knew it. Married to\nhim, I mean I knew. He was politically inclined, which he proved later too and I learned a lot of\nthings and I got interested in...1n politics.",
        "Q: So in 1923?",
        "A: That was in 1923 when my husband said to my father, \"In 10 years you will see those\nboys.\u201d And that was right. They are your judges and they are the...that's it. Yeah.",
        "Q: Where did you go after Beareth? After 1923, after that visit, tell us?",
        "A:I was...I was married in Amsterdam. It was wonderful. The most marvelous life anybody\ncould have. My children were born there. Lots of friends. It was a marvelous life there. And I\ncould paint and I could draw. I didn't start at that time first, but later I did. And it was just\nmarvelous. I took to Holland like as if I was born there. And I felt I always talked the language\nwithout an accent. It was my...I forced myself to listen you know. And nobody thought that I\nwould not be born in Holland. That was wonderful. I loved it. And then, of course, a tragedy\ncame. And my husband knew it before hand. He said, \"They come. They will come.\u201d And I\nknew they will come.",
        "Q: Excuse me. I want to pause and stop the tape for a moment please. Okay, we are back on\ntape. Huh... You had a...you had started to talk about the year 1933.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: During Amsterdam. What happened in 1933.",
        "A: You know that was that terrible....the beginning in Germany. And of course, we were\nterribly not only touched but all the refuge coming and we tried very much to do for them, the\nones who came and we...it was just a restless time. And my husband knew immediately. He said,\n\"This is the beginning.\u201d And my mother said the same thing. We knew it. And then I became ill\nand had fever, and I was sent away for a few months. And...uh...it was alright and I came back\nand it was very much better and then came 38. That was Kristallnacht. Wasn't it. And my mother\nwas still in Beareth because she didn't want to leave. She was very proud. She had no money in\nHolland. She had her money in Germany of course so she didn't want to leave. And the Gestapo\ncame and the same night I went to Germany immediately. I had my Dutch passport. I could do\nthat. I went to Beareth and started a fight of 7 days with the the , with these people because I\nwanted my mother out. And before they gave a exit reason that she could leave, they had of\ncourse a hundred thousand things to day. I was every day for 7 days there and fought with those\npeople, and told them what I thought about them. I did! I told somebody...one man that...one of\nthe that I know you. Your father was a fine man. He was really a noble man. I said, \"Oh you\nseem so...and why do you make a effort to besmear my whole family?\" \"Oh, no, we don't know.\nWe don't.\u201d But he did. But in any case, after 7 days I got the permission to go to the bank and get\nmy mother's fortune go to the Nazis. The bank director know me as a little child. He said,\n\"Listen, I know you, but it's better that you go. Your mother couldn't come out. I'm sorry we\nhave to take the money.\u201d So they took my mother's whole fortune. That's why she didn't come to\nHolland. I went to them opposite in that old palace which was once a palace and then was a Nazi\nplace and got a visa for my mother to exit. But we say I didn't get it, but it was there. And then I\nsaid, \"Okay, I will go.\u201d But when I came into the house...I forgot to tell you, my...the\npictures...the pictures of my youth. You know, I had so many. The beautiful portraits of my\nancestors, they were hacked to pieces in that Kristallnacht. My mother's apartment looked\nunbelievable and the beautiful picture. I didn't mind my picturers, my drawings of my youth but\nthe picture of my beautiful grandmother. And so I left and my mother followed in a few days. I\npurposely did that and when she came without trouble. She could come over, but she left\neverything and came like that to Amsterdam and I was...we were happy to have here. But the\nKristallnacht was something which has to be thought of you know. I was there. I saw it. I saw the\ndestruction. It's sad. Terrible. I had a friend who came to me, not a Jewish friend, and she\nbelonged to the aristocracy there and she said, \"You know we are so desperate.\u201d Her father in\nlaw was a very high, you know, very religious. And she said, \"Believe me, we are not all like\nthat. Believe me. We think it's terrible.\u201d But of course, they couldn't do anything. There were the\nNazis and they have the power and in Beareth they had especially power because there was a\nteacher who helped Hitler before and the Wagners, of course. I didn't even talk about the\nWagners yet. Huh? Would you like to know about the Wagners and my family? Now my...I only\nremember that we always had singers coming and staying in my father's house who were singing\nfor . With their little children, they always talked about and grandma, but it was who was the\npower of course behind the throne. And I remember there was in white and between and the\nyoungest daughter and her husband , he was the greatest anti-Semite, the Englishman. So we saw\nthem walk all the time. Beautiful old ladies, smiling, angelic, but the devil as we all know.",
        "Q: You saw them?",
        "A: Yes, of course we saw them. And my father knew Seigfrid and when I was graduating\nSeigfried gave me permission to play the piano, his piano, in our...I know that when I left school\nI played by Greek on the piano, on Seigfried Wagner's piano. Yeah, he was nice. It was she who\nwas the bad one. But Seigfried was very nice. Whenever he saw me, he waved to me. You know\nthat's...that's passe, of course. And so I left. My mother left and that was all about Germany and I\ndidn't want to hear about Germany anymore.",
        "Q: So this happened in 1938.",
        "A: Yes, that was in 1938 and we settled her down and then, of course, \u2019*we knew what was\ncoming. And then I got...I went to Switzerland. I worked in the....No it's very important. I had\nfever and the doctor said I must go away, get away from Amsterdam, from that fever place so to\nsay and I went to Arosa. And I meta friend and he said, \"Go to this hotel outside of Arosa. I was\nthere and my husband left me and on the first evening I went down, consoled myself by putting\non along gown, evening dress which I loved, and I'm called to the telephone. And my husband\ncalled me. I had just arrived you know, and he said, \"You have to come back.\u201d I said, \"What?\"\n\"There is the invasion of Vienna.\u201d I think it was...not yet, I mean the Nazis went to Vienna. I\nforgot. In any case, I said, \"I can't. I have high fever.\u201d He said, \"Then I'll call you tomorrow.\u201d\nAnd I come out and there stand two elegant Germans. They said, \"Ah, . We observed you are so\nbeautiful. Will you come out?\" I said, \"I am not accustomed to go out with strangers.\u201d They said\nyou must speak a very educated talk. I said, \"Oh,\" I said, \"You listened? \"If you listened,\" I said,\n\"then I tell you that I just heard that you invaded Austria.\u201d \"That couldn't be,\" he said. This\ngentlemen is the of some paper. I said, \"But it is true.\u201d And I let them stand there. But I knew\nthat I was on their list so I had letters. That was before Arosa. That was in . And I had bags...my\nhusband wrote me every day. And I went to my bag to look for them in the bag. The letters had\ndisappeared. So I knew...the chambermaids. They're all German chambermaids. They had taken\nmy letters, and the next day it was brought back. And so I said, \"I cannot stay here in that hotel\nwith those.\u201d So I went down to the gentlemen and said, \"I will not stay here in the hotel.\u201d He\nsaid, \"Why not?\" I said, \"Your guests. I don't like your guests.\u201d And I wonderful chance. One\nof the skiers saw me from Holland. He came. He said, \"You know this lady is here in the hotel.\nDon't you know here?\" I said, \"Yes.\u201d I called her up. I said I have got to get me a room. That\nwas the lady from Holland. She said, \"I will.\u201d So she got me a room. I took a sleigh and left\neverything in the hotel and I knew I was on their list and that was true. That was the beginning.\nBut they...but I was on the list. They had stolen my letters from my husband and so on. And that\nwas now 39 I think. So that was...we knew we were... how could I say... not only my husband,\nbut I was too on the list. And there it was. And then, you know, the invasion and we knew it. I\nsaid to my little housemaid when we went on vacation for a few days in August. I said, \"Stay\nhere.\u201d She said, \"Why.\u201d \"I said, \"Best. The Nazis come.\u201d She said, \"It couldn't be.\u201d I said, Yes.\u201d\nWe were on vacation and after the second...on the second day the maid comes in and while we\nwere having dinner and said that three gentlemen are outside. They come and then a screaming\nstarts. My children never forgot it. There was these three Gestapo people there and two Dutch\npoliceman and they wanted to have Mr. Model into prison. Yeah. And they screamed. That was\nthe worse thing. And I went up to him. I was so furious. Said, \"Why do you do that.\u201d He said,\n\"He's in our books 6 years.\u201d \"What for?\" \"Smuggled dollars.\u201d I said, \"My husband smuggled\ndollars?\" \"Yes, Ma'am. American Bank.\u201d He didn't really do it. So I immediately dumped into\na train, left my children there, went to Amsterdam and came to my house and the maid said,\n\"You know, they were here with Mr. Model. They opened every drawer and looked and left my\nin pieces and everything. They looked for papers and, of course, they couldn't find it, so that was\nthe beginning of the prison. At the same night at 11 o'clock at night, my maid comes...that little\nmaid...a very patriotic Dutch girl and she said, \"There's a gentlemen... had sent away...there's a\ngentleman and he's one of those who was here with Mr. Model when he came with the Nazis,\"\nshe said, \"and he said he insists that he has to talk to you. I said, \"Okay, if he insists. Put him in\nyour room.\u201d So I went there and it was one of the Dutch officers. You know I told you there\nwere the Gestapo and then two Dutch officers. And he said, \"Please, Mrs. Model, trust me.\u201d I\nsaid, \"Why should I trust you?\" He said, \"I am the other international law that we are forced to\nbe with the Nazis when they do something with Dutch citizens you know.\u201d And then he took out\na little match box and in that matchbox inside he had what he only could written. He had\nwritten...he had 9 people I should warn. And I warned them of course. He said, \"Please trust\nme.\u201d I said, \"But why should I trust you?\" He said, \"I tell you a story. Last year...two years\nago...I don't know...we had caught a young German who came due, he said, who came over with\n5 and the police called your husband because when they asked him, \"What do you do with the...\nHe said he delivered something to Mr. Model . Now he said...the policeman said latter...We\nknew Mr. Model had a perfect name. He wouldn't smuggle . So they called my husband. My\nhusband said, \"I can't come. Come to me.\u201d So they came. Three policeman with this young\nGerman Jew and my husband said, \"Do you know me?\" \"No.\u201d My husband said, \"I have never\nseen that boy.\u201d But he said, \"Let me be alone with him.\u201d So the police left, went the other room.\nThey were very polite and my ...my husband said, \"How did you get my name?\" He said, \"I\nbought it.\u201d So he said, \"What?\" \"Yeah, there is an exchange in Berlin and your name was on the\nhighest list. I paid 800 marks for your name as the one who helps everybody.\u201d I swear it this was\nthe truth what I tell you. So he had my husband's name and gave the police knew he wasn't\nsmuggling. So my husband said the police that they should not put him back to German...send\nhim back to Germany. And he vouched for him and he gave him money that he could go in\nthat...\u201d\u2019 which at that time was only a detention camp and not a...later became that terrible camp.\nSo my husband got it done that that boy who got him into difficulties was not put back to\nGermany. And this was the policeman. He said, \"And I was there when your husband pleaded\nnot to put that boy back. And I said to myself if I ever can do something for that man will. And\nnow was my opportunity because when I came there I knew I will help.\u201d And he said, My\ncolleague...colleague I don't know.\u201d But the funniest thing is that next day in the afternoon, the\ncolleague called me and said, \"Ah, he so wonderful. We got him something to eat in the morning\nbefore he went to the Gestapo headquarters.\u201d Imagine. They're all heart that because they saw\nhow wonderful he was. In prison...the prison...they said, \"He's so wonderful...he had...he gives\ncourage to everybody. He said to them when they walked in the prison yard, he said, \"Don't\nworry. They will not last out here. Then will not last 10 years,\" to the people you know. That was\nhim you know.",
        "Q: Before I ask you more about your husband, I'd like you to put your purse on the floor. It's\na little distracting. You should try not to touch the mike up here. Okay?",
        "A: Did I?",
        "Q: Tell me about your husband and how did he get involved in helping people. My husband\nas a young man already was involved. When he was 18, he was already a leader for young\npeople. And when I met him he had...was always in politics but against everything....against the\ncommon man you know. So I knew that and I was happy and I became just like he was. I helped\neverybody as far as I could, but I wasn't as powerful as he. Everybody could come to him and\nthey did. They did. I told you the Nazis told me. They knew since years that he was helping\neverybody and told me themselves. And I said, \"What did you say to me?\" Now isn't that stupid.\nI got so mad. I was alone. He was \u2019Karloff*. The name of the Nazi hunter who took my husband\nwas Inspector Karloff. Never will I forget the name. And he said, \"I think he's a wonderful man\nmyself.\u201d And I said, \"And you keep him in prison yet?\" \"But he's our enemy?\" I said, \"What do\nyou expect?\" You know he's too naive. Can you imagine? And so they kept him and kept him\nand kept him. And he could...he...he didn't get my letters. I got his letters which were desperate.\nHe never got a letter and I wrote every day. I sent somebody to the prison. (Sigh) He didn't...and\nthey didn't give it to him. And he was tortured because there were bombings from the English at\nthat time. But they were lost and then I get an anonymous telephone call from The Hague when\nhe was about 4 weeks in prison. And he...there was a German speaking and said, \"You don't\nknow me but I know about you and I know about your husband. I would like to see him.\u201d I said,\n\"He's not here.\u201d \"Where is he?\" I said, \"In prison,\" and bang the telephone went down. I should\nnot say in prison. He was in prison. And that was it. A week after that, the same thing. \"Can I\ntalk to Mr. Model?\" I said, \"He's in prison.\u201d \"Wait a moment,\" he said, \"I come.\u201d So there came\na tall, nice, portly German who said, \"I did not put my car in front of your house, which was nice\nwith the Gestapo of course. But I have to tell you that I am not your enemy. I'm your friend\nbecause Mr. Model did something so fabulous once for me. You know he always did things. I\nwant to help him.\u201d I said, \"You only can help him when you get him out of prison.\u201d And he\ndisappeared, you know, and that was it. And then I didn't hear anything and then one day I get a\ntelephone call Saturday morning and the same voice said, \"I see clear. I talked to that Karlo. And\nthat was it. And then in the afternoon at 2 o'clock a taxi comes and my husband was home. But\nthat wasn't the end of it. Every week one of the Gestapo people came to the bank and got him to\nThe Hague or to Rotterdam, and he never told me what happened there. He never told me. But\nevery week twice, three times, they called him again. Cat and mouse you know. H",
        "Q: What was the excuse first for putting him in prison.",
        "A: Oh, he was the collector of the...of the dollars all over Europe, which wasn't true at all of\ncourse. It was...it was actually the...uh...you know...then...yeah...then I was at the Gestapo for the\neighth time. I never came...I always went to the Gestapo and he interrogated me, and on the\neighth time, he said, \"Something terrible has happened while I was away.\u201d I said, \"What has\nhappened?\" He left...left the other man go and I was alone with him. And he said, \"Some people\nhave...I had forgotten about this even...\"Some people have offered money for Mr. Model's\nrelease.\u201d I said, \"What?\" \"Dollars,\" he said. I said, \"We have no dollars. My husband has no\ndollars.\u201d We delivered it to the Dutch. We were supposed to deliver it. \"No, no, no. 4 thousand\ndollars or 8 thousand dollars.\u201d I don't remember. In any case, suddenly I...he said...he mentioned\na name, Mrs. Levy. This Mrs. Levy, she was at my door, but I didn't receive her. He said, \"Yes,\nbut she was not Jewish.\u201d She had the name....she was a German who worked together with the\nMexican Consul to get money out of the people. And he said...when I was in prison...I forgot to\ntell you that men came in...a banker and said, \"Outside is a lady. She can help to get your\nhusband out of prison.\" And immediately I knew. Impossible! I knew that wouldn't be possible.\nSo I said, \"I don't believe you.\u201d \"Oh,\" he said, \"Yes.\u201d I said, \"Oh, 1t costs money.\u201d \"Yes, it costs\nmoney, but what is money for the release of Mr. Model?\" I said, \"It's nothing, but for me it's\nsomething because I don't have any dollars.\u201d \"And anyway,\" I said, \"I can't. \"Who's the lady?\"\nHe said, \"This is a Mrs. Levy.\" So I knew the name you know. And when I was there he said,\n\"Mrs. Levy came to him and offered the Gestapo...1magine, he said, 4 thousand or 6...8 thousand\ndollars...I don't know...for the release of . Of course, he couldn't do that. I said, \"No, you couldn't\ndo it, of course.\u201d That was the beginning and I knew darn well that they had...they wanted...we\nwould have paid...they would have paid 4 thousand dollars and then they would have come to us\nand give us 8 thousand dollars because that's what they did. But I didn't do it. I knew my husband\nwould hate it, and he said later he was so glad for that I didn't believe them and didn't let...I didn't\nsee Mrs. Levy ever. But she interfered with my life because she wanted money. Later after the\nwar, I heard, she was taken into prison by the Dutch with the Mexican Consul because she\ncheated and got money. I know people who paid her the money. But very nice people, Cohen,\nfrom Amsterdam. I heard that they paid the money. I didn't because first of all, I didn't have it.\nAnyway, that was...that was the beginning you know. And then we get a telephone call from the\nAmerican Consul, knew my husband, of course, my husband works for an American bank. And\nhe said, \"Mrs. Model, you have to get him out of the country.\u201d I said, \"Don't I know that? Don't I\nknow that?\" And before the Nazis came, on the day before the Germans marched in...I forgot to\ntell you...I had in my living room about 13 people who all wanted to leave the country with my\nhusband because they knew where he is there 1s action and they can do something. But my\nhusband said, \"I cannot leave. I have 40 people who depend on me.\u201d But I will help you and we\ngot in touch with other people. And there was a cousin of mine. He said, \"I am a criminal but I\ndon't go.\u201d He said, \"I cannot go if he doesn't go.\u201d I said, \"I cannot go if he doesn't go. I stay, of\ncourse.\u201d It was...ah...I never can forget that afternoon and they were all there and the Belgium\nConsul even offered us that we could go, and he said he wouldn't go because some 40 people are\ndepending on him. He cannot go. And he looked at me and I said...funnily enough I had...he said\nto me later, \"Why did you not say anything.\u201d I said, \"I had a feeling we would get out anyway.\u201d\nReal funny thing. I have a feeling we'll get out.",
        "Q: What did your husband mean '40 people are depending on him.\u201d He had a bank and 40\npeople were depending on him. He couldn't let them from one day to the other without money,\nwithout anything. That was him. He said, \"I cannot.\u201d My mother was one of them. You see. He\nsaid, \"I couldn't do that. 40 people. I.... cannot go.\u201d And when he said that, I said, \"We will go.\u201d\n[...[ had absolutely the feeling we will go somewhere. We could do it. It was my...1t was not\nmade up. I felt we could leave. And if so, he finished everything and when the American Consul\nsaid try get out and then a few other people called and the Underground called us and we were\ntwice put...1t was the most awful thing. Twice we were put on a list...an exit visa...visa, which\nwas the most important from the Nazis. But we couldn't no visa. We had nothing. Let me think\nback. Then that's another time when the....when the was a friend there officially they gave the\nvisa...we gave the permit...permit, but it was not the business of course. And called me and said\nwe have another...we had another visa...exit visa...visa...exit for you. I said, \"But we have\nno...have no visa for...from where should you go.\u201d But then the American Consul said, \"Mr.\nModel, try to get in touch with the American Consuls.\u201d How it really happened, I don't know.\nBut the time went and the exit visa was gone and we get another call and they said, \"If you don't\nleave now, you will never leave.\u201d That's the Underground. So my husband again went to\nRotterdam where the American Consul was, and he said to him, \"It's desperate. I will be killed\nand we all will be killed if you don't give us the...\"I can't do it.\u201d But...then my husband said, \"I\nwould...you would be responsible to Beareth because my husband worked for the bank where\nBeareth was...something. He got a little frightened and he said, \"Okay. Let your wife come on\nthe...\u2019 And I came. And he...he took our notes, but this was it. But then in the meantime it was\nFriday and Saturday morning my husband went...on Monday, we were supposed to go to that\ntransport. I had to tell my mother that we leave. I had to pack two bags. And my sons had 40\ndegree fever or something. Any case he said, \"You have to come immediately.\u201d He called me\nfrom Rotterdam. I was not permitted to take a taxi but I did, jumped into the train and arrive, and\nthere he stands and he smiles a little bit. And he said, \"I think we will make it.\u201d So he had told\nme that while he was talking to the Consul he remembered his other Spanish visa. He went to the\nSpanish Consulate and there was one girl left. And she said, \"I can't do anything.\u201d He said, \"Here\nare...I don't know how much money he gave her...Dutch money. Please. To your favorite charity,\nbut please put a Spanish visa and she did. She did. That was our savior...that unknown girl put a\nSpanish visa in our passport. And then he went back to the Americans Consulate and said to him,\n\"Here, I have a Spanish visa.\u201d Then, of course, I...I had to sign different things and at 3 O'clock\non that Saturday afternoon, here comes out a very looking man. I forgot his name, thank God. He\ngave me my passport, gave me his hand and said, \"Here is your passport.\u201d For you, I miss my\ngolf. I swear it. That's what he says. And I said, \"But you saved our lives.\u201d He said, \"For you, I\nmissed my golf.\u201d And then we went to Amsterdam and I had to tell my mother that we will leave\nand we didn't...and my sisters after me died when my husband was prison, and then I.... It was\nterrible, of course. You couldn't tell people, but I had to tell my mother and my brother.",
        "Q: You had to leave without your mother?",
        "A: Of course. We couldn't take her. And then. I must think back. Then that was Saturday.\nAnd on Sunday, my husband went to see my mother. He was so wonderful to her. And while he\nwas gone, I get a telephone call from that man with whom my husband worked Underground\nwhom I knew very well. I mean my husband didn't tell me, but I knew. I knew the work of that\nfriend of ours. And he said...it was 3 o'clock in the afternoon, Sunday afternoon. Monday\nmorning, we had to be at 7 o'clock with our two bags on the Grand Central Station. We would\nbe smuggled into a transport. And that ...and he said, \"I'm sorry. He has to be 8 o'clock...he has to\ngo to Grand Central Station. Don't ask any questions he said. So when my husband come in, I\nsaid, \"You have to be at 8 o'clock at Grand Central Station. Didn't know what...but he said, \"I\nwill be go.\u201d So you can imagine, I died a thousand deaths you know when he went at 8 o'clock.\nHe came back at Il o'clock at night. And this is when he had to memorize the undersea port\nstations in which the English bombed...the ones with the Nazis...when the Germans wanted him\nto bomb. And this was the list from that was the head of the Underground in The Hague who\nhad a blueprint and said my husband has to memorize that blueprint where where the U-boats\nare really built. And that he had to do. He had to memorize. You can imagine. In 2 hours! And\nthen the men from The Hague, who was the head of The Hague put...put his paper again and\nsaid, \"Good luck,\" and left with the blueprints and they were in my husband's mind. He didn't tell\nme what he had done, of course. I heard it only then in...1n Spain because he was so desperate\nthat he could lose the memory of that. Imagine, in they will be delivered...But he said the man\nfrom The Hague said, \"We waited for you. We had to have somebody with memory and brains.\u201d\nSo that...so that was the last thing, and then the next morning we went to the station. It was\nhorrible. My mother was standing in a corner. My brother was standing in a corner, and then we\nwent into a train. That is it. And that was goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. It was horrible. And then\nwe went the train. Halfway on the way to Brussels the door opens and out comes a very tall,\ngood-looking German officer. I think his name was Mr. \u2019 Von Hagen, Colonel von Hagens or\nsomething. He bowed to me and he said, \"Mrs. Model, I have to borrow your husband.\u201d And he\nwas a German officer. He said, \"Don't be afraid. I would like to talk to him.\u201d\u2019 My husband had to\ngo. I was sitting in that train. My children got frightened. You can't imagine how awful that was.\nAfter 20 minutes, he came again and that was the man who had just heard the name Model. He\nhad heard about my husband, and he always wanted to know whether we are a family of a\nGerman General from Model. And my husband said...I am not s family...we knew who we were,\nof course... I am not, and now and please let me go back to my wife. She will die a thousand\ndeaths because she went through quite a lot. So he said, \"Mr. Model, I only wanted to say you we\nheard so much about you and I am glad I met you,\" and he let him go. Now that same Mayor or\nwhatever he was kept his hand about me because I had a little basket. The kids called it because\nit was a little basket which we had from our boat into which I put three little on this side. The\nbooks I had from my husband, and a few drawings I had made of my husband and my mother\nand a friend. There were in that little basket which the kids called you know because I carried it\nmyself. So wherever we stopped in Paris...in...first in Brussels...1n Paris and we had to go out and\nwalk a little bit, this Gestapo man who was with that .... with that German officer came over to\nme and said, \"Open that basket.\u201d And every time he said it, that officer came said, \"Leave her\nalone.\u201d That went on four times. Four times he kept his hand over me. He said, \"Leave her\nalone.\u201d But in when he said goodbye, he came over. He said, \"I kept my hand...hand over you\nMrs. Model. What is in that basket?\" I said, \"You could have opened it. There are books, . But I\ndidn't... was glad he didn't, because when we opened on the boat these books because friends\nwanted to see it again, out fall drawings which a friend from Paris had made about Hitler and\npoems. Imagine that! That was my luck that he didn't force me to open that...that basket. That\nwas a wonderful man. I wish I had...I could thank him. Yeah. So then we were in Lisbon...in\nMadrid. In Madrid, you know we could only met because.... Yeah, I forgot. When we arrived in\nSandebastian, we were led to a hotel, and hardly had we entered that hotel when a young\nDutchman come over and said, \"Mr. Model, the Embassy from Madrid has already called three\ntimes. You have to call back. They have to talk to you immediately.\u201d So my husband called\nback. It was the Embassy, and the Ambassador said, \"I was told that you bring news. Please,\ntomorrow, you...you come to Madrid.\u201d My husband said, \"I cannot do that. I cannot just leave\nher. I have no visa. They knew that we had to. \"But you will get it.\u201d So next day came the Dutch\nConsul from Optowa. I'll never forget it. They're lovely old people there who had no visa. Of\ncourse, my husband said you have to get them a visa to Spain too. And he came, and it took 4\ndays until we got permission from the...from the Spanish \u2019things to travel through Spain to\nMadrid. And then we were in Lubrick, and he dumped us in the , and he said, \"You sit here. If I\ncome back after 2 hours,\"...He had a funny feeling...I couldn't get...get rid of my knowledge. \"If\nI'm stay a longer it's fine, but you have patience, and he dumped us in . The kids run around the\nof course, and I was sitting at with these other people also. And he came after 2 hours, looked\nterrible and said, \"I couldn't talk to him.\u201d When I enter he came over to me, \"Ah how wonderful\nthe ... He said, \"Ah, you know that I play golf with the German ambassador all the time. He's\nsuch a nice man.\u201d When my husband heard that, he said, \"For God's sake,\" so he didn't tell them\nabout the , but he had knowledge of a few other things and he told them that. And the officer\nsaid, \"Yes, but have told that bring out the most important news about Underground. No?\" Max\nsaid, \"That must have been an error,\" you know. And he came to me and he said, \"My God, if the\nman is Lisbon is the same caliber, I have to call America with my knowledge and then it's too\nlate. But the man in Lisbon was wonderful. My husband spend the whole week with who was\nthe Under Secretary and when we were on the boat he heard on the radio then...on the ship's\nradio...that the Dutch replaced and the from became the Ambassador. That was...he never\nknew....that baron never knew that it was the little Jew from Amsterdam who cost him his post.\nYeah? Isn't that? The...the turn of events is just miraculous in a way, you know? It's just...you\ncan't believe it sometimes. Yeah. And then we landed in Lisbon. It was nice to be there. You\ncould breathe again. The kids liked it, and he worked with the Embassy every day. Yeah. And\nthen friends...they learned the boat was , which was a boat for 150 people where there were 500\non the boat, you know, all refugees. All refugees, of course, some spies too. We were five in a\ncabin. We paid three thousand dollars which was sent from America. My sister-in-law sent the\nmoney for the boat to pay for. We paid. Some didn't you know. There was a whole bottom of the\nboat was full with...with...uh...young immigrants from all over and they, of course...they didn't\npay a penny, but we were...we could pay so therefore we pay. Huh? And there was guy \u201d*on the\nboat behaved very badly. His wife at least. He didn't. And the Rabbi from Luxembourg, we were\nelite there, we were first class because we paid. But this couple who had money with no\nrefugees, the son-in-law of the conductor, , and lovely wife and son and I think and then, of\ncourse, it spoke around immediately that my husband does bring from the bottom of the bunk,\nand a Dutchman. Everyday the kids...he organized those kids so they put the food which were\nabove the table and put them down because they didn't get any food you know. The people down\nthere was organized. Every day the kids went down and...and did that.",
        "Q: Your husband told them to do that?",
        "A: Yeah. We got more...we got food...more food, but our food too to divide too. But then\none day that young man came, that Dutchman came and said a baby was born. And it's terrible\namongst these many people. It's terrible...the wife...the young wife of a young Russian or Polish\nviolinist...I cannot forget it. \"We must have a room. We must have a room.\u201d So my husband\nstarted and we go to because they had a living room on the boat. They had a saloon on the boat.\nHe said, Mr. , you have to give up your saloon. She said, \"I can't.\u201d He said, \"Why can't you?\" \"T\nhave to receive people.\u201d My husband said, \"Whom do you receive? I won't come anyway.\u201d Do\nyou receive the Rabbi of Luxembourg, and Mr. and Mrs. something on the ?\" No, she couldn't\ngive her room. So that was number one. Then, he went to the Luxembourg Rabbi and he said, \"I\ncan't give it this room. A friend of my wife is living there.\u201d Then he went...of course, the people\nwho had no living room and wanted out of first class...our friends wanted to give their bathroom,\neverything. But you couldn't then. Then the purser came to my husband who had observed my\nhusband of course, and said, \"You know, Mr. Model. I give him...give them my room because I\nsaw how tough it is.\u201d So that young of wife then came to the purser's room. I give you these little\nsketches. Everything is the purest truth what I tell you, not that I want to make up, but it's true. It\nis true. So that young baby was looked after in the purser's room on top of the ship and not in the\nbottom of the ship. Yeah. So that was....1 was so happy when was permitted in the radio room\nthan the room of \u2019Sandame. And Madrid was replaced by that one he had made. So he was\nvery happy and he became....\u201d * became the Ambassador. No? That's another story. Huh?",
        "Q: On the ship can you...On the ship can you tell us about Shigall himself.",
        "A: No, I mean...I he was...he had nothing to say. Bella was everything you know. Bella was\nthe ruler and she...she was standing on the bottom on the...on the rung. I was sick. I wasn't up\nvery much. She said, \"My daughter, my daughter, My daughter.\u201d \"What about your daughter?\"\n\"Eva is still in Paris.\u201d Of course, Eva is a very nice person. I later met her. I helped her when she\nwas in New York. Very nice woman. And she was married at that time and couldn't get, but she\ncame out and that was her whole complaint. Only that Eva comes out. But he didn't say much I\nmean. She run around with a book on her back so my husband said, \"Why do you run around\nwith that book?\" Do you think some people can buy....\u201d\u201d You know he was...he had a...he had,\nbut Bella, Bella and later we saw them in New York a few times and he was always very\napologetic you know, and I liked meeting him. The daughter came and I liked her very much.\nShe was a few times in my house and her husband was selling. Bags full of sketch, not sketch,\nbut were etchings and she went from rich people to rich. Sometime she came to me to have\nlunch. She's a wonderful daughter, and she sewed for him them at that time. You can imagine\nlater it was different by that time. Just had to get money. He was brought over by the Cultural\nMission or something but they...of course they paid for his apartment I'm sure but...so she sold\nthese books which she got. She's a wonderful daughter. Really. Really wonderful. He was a...He\ncouldn't say anything. He was rude by here. And then one day I see him in the street and he\ncried. She had died, and he was desperate. Then shortly afterwards he fell in with a young\nEnglish girl. It wasn't so terrible you know. But he was a nice man. He was just a weak man you\nknow. I had nothing against him. And Eva was wonderful. I saw her later when she married .\nVery nice. Had two boys, so she was very very nice woman. Eda. She was very rich, but she also\ngives. She was not like her father was, stingy. She gives. She gives pictures here and there. I\nadmire her very much. Very nice, very nice.",
        "Q: So you were...back on the boat. Are there other stories about the boat trip that you would\nlike to tell?",
        "A: Oh, yes. One day I was bed. I had high fever, and I heard singing and I went down. There\nwere a few Viennese young boys with \u2019Leadere and I went up to one and I said, \"Aren't you\nashamed? You sing a song of Vienna. There your grandfather cleaning their streets.\u2019\u201d\u2019 He looked\nat me. He said, \"So I sang But two young girls came down and said, \"Oh excuse us because it\nwas so rude and stupid of that man and I was perfectly right and she will see that I don't sing\nany... That's what he sang all the time with his guitar. So that was another thing, but he didn't\nsing it anymore. Yeah. About...about...because you asked me about the boat. Yeah. Otherwise,\nthe kids had a lovely time and somebody tried to teach them the...the national anthem and they\nhad a good time and my son, my older son, who had so much tears when his father was in...1n\nprison and later in Paris when he had to go away. He cried and cried but then he comes to me and\nthere was my old, smiling lovely boy who was his old self. He had...1t was a miracle. There\nwas...his father was there. He didn't have to be afraid that they come and take his father.",
        "Q: Let's back up. Excuse me. Explain about coming into New York.",
        "A: Yeah. I forgot. I have to tell you that of course. We landed in Staten Island, and there\nwere...my sister in law and some friends, and he had taken an apartment in Fifth Avenue so we\ncould go there and the kids started immediately to...it's wonderful for them. You know, the high\nskyscrapers and everything. They loved it. And, of course, it was terribly hot but nothing was\nbad. It was so wonderful to be in America you know. That was it. My husband got immediately a\njob, and that was also wonderful and so we stayed for a few week and a month in that Fifth\nAvenue apartment and then I looked around and found....and then we had to go up Riverside\nDrive at night to see somebody who asked him to see...I don't know who it was...and we stepped\nout of Riverside Drive on Seventy Second street, and I look around and I said, \"It's lovely here.\u201d\nAnd I see...on the other side, I see something that looked like an apartment to...rent. I went over\nand this was the apartment I rented. Just like that. First one, and I rented it the next day. That\nwas...yeah...and I'm still there. Yeah. Now asked me some questions. I talk and talk because but\nplease.",
        "Q: Yeah. What is it like...uh...for you...uh...a young artist young artist with a husband and\nchildren first seeing the United States?",
        "A: Well, as an artist, I mean I thought nothing but these two little things, but I wanted my\nchildren to get out of New York. I wanted them to learn English without an accent because I had\nseen in Holland when the children lived with their parents, they had an accent. They learned it.\nBut then a friend of ours...I said I have to get them in a school outside of New York until a friend\nof ours she got us the addresses. And one afternoon when the kids...I put them in a camp....you\nknow we had friends who had told us about a camp, so the kids were in a camp already after a\nweek. Just gave me tips you know. There... You have to have a friend, you know...was one of\nthem then you know, and I went then...we got a telephone call. A young man came and said and\nsaid we should come out on Sunday. And I said, \"We will do that of course.\u201d And it was very\nchancy little man. He was...He was sent....I said, \"Yeah. Sent to look us over.\u201d He said, Yes.\u201d\nAnd he stumbled over a table where some photographs...the only thing I could take were\nphotographs and the photograph fell down. He said, \"Who did that?\" I said, \"I did.\u201d He said,\n\"Oh, Mrs. Model, your children are in because our chairman \u201d\u2019*is one of the big publishers and he\nloved children of artists. So it was. I came there and they immediately got accepted. Of course,\nmy older one immediately was...in spite of he didn't know English he was in short time on top of\nhis class. It's just fabulous. Peter always was was very intelligent, but immediately on top and\nloved and adored by the others. And \u201d was...he's like that. So that was from the beginning and I\nhad a wonderful time in the boarding school outside of New York.",
        "Q: What was the adjustment like for you and your husband in the first year.",
        "A: We got a scholarship, by the way. That's what I wanted to tell you. I was adjusted\nimmediately. I didn't have any trouble whatsoever. I felt at home. I spoke English, of course, and\nmy husband spoke English and we were immediately...we...we immediately felt that's where we\nwanted to be. We had some American friends and that was wonderful. And it was no trouble. I\nmean I...just wonderful, so we took...And that's it. I can't say anything but perfect results.",
        "Q: What work did your husband do?",
        "A: My husband was in the banking brokering business. But he had a...was a specialist. He\nwas something very special also in that because after his work and somebody come to me in\nAmerica and said, \"You know I made a study of your husband's brain and I saw there were only\n18 people in America who could do what he did,\" but I never knew what he did. So that was a\nlittle exaggerated, but 1t was surely truth. And he could work immediately, and it was very\nimportant. And people were awfully nice, Americans...the Americans we knew, but for one.",
        "Q: Turn back. When you talked that the FBI had called your husband at some point. Could\nyou explain about that?",
        "A: Yes. That was very strange. He gets a telephone call. I must not forget to say something.\nWhen we were in Staten Island and that immigration officer interrogated us didn't want to let us\nin because we had no hotel. We had only , which was address of my husband's office business.\nAnd he said nobody lives on. My husband said, \"I know. My family and my friends are down\nthere. They will tell us where we live. I can't lie to you,\" he said. \"I can't tell you I live in that\nhotel where we were before, but I have no address. This is business.\u201d And he was very nice. But\nthen finally my husband took out his Dutch career papers and he said, \"Why didn't you tell me\nbefore?\" He said, \"I didn't need to. I have a perfectly valid passport with a perfectly valid visa,\"\nwhich was true. And he didn't want to do it, but then he had to do it. And so that was the\nreception. And then we were boat...the boat left us to Manhattan skyline and we saw it was\nbeautiful, Staten Island. Not Ellis Island. It was Staten Island. Yeah. It was beautiful. We were at\nhome. The kids were at home immediately. There is no doubt. My youngest son said to\nme...after a week, he said to me, \"Mamma, can you believe...if I tell my friends in Holland that I\nam accustomed to skyscrapers, they wouldn't believe it.\u201d I'll never can forget he said that. It's\ntrue.",
        "Q: Tell me about the FBI.",
        "A: Oh, yes, so the FBI knew of course then through this immigration thing that he was a\nDutch career you see. So they approached him and said they trust him. Could they use him to be\ntheir...when they need...when they need something to know about Holland and all that.\u201d So that\nwas when they called him, very often. And about people whom they had, you know...and my\nhusband, of course, never said anything negative about the people. Then, afterall, we didn't know\nthem. We only know one friend and we said he's a very rick and wonderful man. But this is way\nasked. He never told me really what they asked him, but he went constantly. In the first year, he\nwas constantly called to help them because they trusted him. He was a Dutch career. They\nbelieved. And they saw the papers you know. So that was very good, of course. And I...when we\nsuddenly became citizen, he was...you know I talk a lot, and then he said But my husband always\nwarned her, \"Mina, you get yourself in deep water. Don't do that.\" Mr. Roosevelt was in there\ntoo, but he was a leftist organization. Don't forget you must tell these interrogation officers for\nthe citizenship, you must tell them that you were a member of these things. He was so asked me,\n\"Did you belong to any organizations.\u201d \"Yes,\" I said, I belonged to that but I left after 2 years.\nThat was true. They knew everything. And he knew that. Through the FBI, he knew. They would\nask everything. So I was safe. I wouldn't have thought about it, that I was a member once. But\nthat was the truth and I was so happy. And they were very nice because I was not a member any\nmore. All these little things come back now when you ask it you know.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story?",
        "A: To that?",
        "Q: To any of it.",

        "Q: Anything. Yes...What...what I'm interested in 1s are there...1s there any more stories that\nyou want to tell about the Nazis and your involvement with them.",
        "A: I really don't...I don't want to remember so much about that now. We were free of them\nand, of course, I left my family and all of them. That was tragic and terrible.",
        "Q: How did you lose your mother?",
        "A: In the concentration camp. She was there. And my brother was sent away and the kids\nwere sent away. This is my book then, in this book. It was terrifying. It was terrible, of course,\nand my husband's sister died in... That was the other thing, and..uh...after the war....ah...you\nknow, it's really...we should...we started a new life, and we were very happy here. The kids were\nhappy here. My husband was happy here too. It's only terribly that I had to lose him so early.\nBut otherwise, it was a wonderful life. We had nice friends, and I had my...my work. You asked\nme about my work.",
        "Q: Please describe for us.",
        "A: We had a wonderful...I had immediately nice friends. I became a member of the women's\nassociation, and I exhibited there an I got a gold medal. I told you that. And I could work and I\nhad a one-man show, which was very nicely then. I had...they were very good to me. I mean I\nwas really...they liked what I did let's say. And...uh...I was happy. That's it.

        "Q: Well, I...I got a telephone call for example, \"Be at 9 O'clock at Corner, Munich at 9\no'clock. And then telephone thing. I didn't go of course. And the next thing is I got a letter that\nmy father died and I should go immediately to Bayreuth. I knew also that wouldn't be true. This\nwas the revenge of certain young punks because I refused to walk and go out with them you\nknow. So that it was the beginning that I knew I was...I was on the list you know. But...and I was\non their list. But of course, I didn't bother. knew that I married and went to Holland and I forgot\nabout. But I couldn't forget about, because I think I mentioned that I married in 1922 and in 23\nwe visited Bayreuth. And in Beareth, there's a beautiful old Beareth opera house which got\nWagner to Beareth. offered him that house, but, of course, it was not big enough...to Doctor\nWagner. But it was gorgeous...Beareth....and I loved it and I showed it to my husband and then\ndown that opera...little opera hill came down a troop...a troop of singing boys with the old flag.\nand everything.

There was always singers coming and staying\nin our house and things like that, and started later to resent it terribly much because I\nhated...started to hate. Couldn't be helped. I had one little episode when I was a little girl. I met\nthis fabulous old gentleman who looked like Wagner. I feel into his arm when I was 12 years old.\nHe was a poet and a writer, and he was a Latvian and so far he was a friend of Wagners and\ncame to rehearsals in Bayreuth, and so I met him and he went off to Munich, sent me tickets. He\nwas wonderful. And one day he called me in the street and said I have to come. I said why. He\nsaid, \"I have to talk to you.\u201d So I run. There was this old man pacing up and down and he said,\n\"When I die, all these things, they'll die with me.\u201d I said, \"What?\" He said, \"About When I heard,\nI said, \"I don't want to hearing anything about Wagners.

My mother\nwas absolutely . My father was more of poet. Very nice. And then when I went to Munch I fell\nfor that because my father had taken the drawings of a child to a Professor and he said, \"Ah,\nshe's very gifted. Why don't you send her? So I had the first permission when I was 16. When\nthey called me back, I was too young and I could go again. But Munich was very important. But\nthe second time, I was in Munch...I remember the first time feces on the wall and Jews. That\nwas the start of Hitler. And he...1t was terrifying. But we didn't...crazy people. They thought it\nwas crazy people, but it wasn't. And it went on. And then in my studio where I worked as a\npupil...there was a young girl, beautiful girl and she came one day with a hack and cross, with a\nswastika. I said, \"What are you going...\u201d She said, \"Oh, one of my boyfriends gave it to me.\u201d I\nsaid, \" You better don't wear it because the has this hack and cross.\u201d So for me she kept it back,\nbut then she wear it again, and that was the beginning.

And I\ncould paint and I could draw. I didn't start at that time first, but later I did. And it was just\nmarvelous. I took to Holland like as if I was born there. And I felt I always talked the language\nwithout an accent. It was my...I forced myself to listen you know. And nobody thought that I\nwould not be born in Holland. That was wonderful. I loved it. And then, of course, a tragedy\ncame. And my husband knew it before hand. He said, \"They come. They will come.\u201d And I\nknew they will come.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: You know that was that terrible....the beginning in Germany. And of course, we were\nterribly not only touched but all the refuge coming and we tried very much to do for them, the\nones who came and we...it was just a restless time. And my husband knew immediately. He said,\n\"This is the beginning.\u201d And my mother said the same thing. We knew it. And then I became ill\nand had fever, and I was sent away for a few months. And...uh...it was alright and I came back\nand it was very much better and then came 38. That was Kristallnacht. Wasn't it. And my mother\nwas still in Beareth because she didn't want to leave. She was very proud. She had no money in\nHolland. She had her money in Germany of course so she didn't want to leave. And the Gestapo\ncame and the same night I went to Germany immediately. I had my Dutch passport. I could do\nthat. I went to Beareth and started a fight of 7 days with the the , with these people because I\nwanted my mother out. And before they gave a exit reason that she could leave, they had of\ncourse a hundred thousand things to day. I was every day for 7 days there and fought with those\npeople, and told them what I thought about them. I did! I told somebody...one man that...one of\nthe that I know you. Your father was a fine man. He was really a noble man. I said, \"Oh you\nseem so...and why do you make a effort to besmear my whole family?\" \"Oh, no, we don't know.\nWe don't.\u201d But he did. But in any case, after 7 days I got the permission to go to the bank and get\nmy mother's fortune go to the Nazis. The bank director know me as a little child. He said,\n\"Listen, I know you, but it's better that you go. Your mother couldn't come out. I'm sorry we\nhave to take the money.\u201d So they took my mother's whole fortune. That's why she didn't come to\nHolland. I went to them opposite in that old palace which was once a palace and then was a Nazi\nplace and got a visa for my mother to exit. But we say I didn't get it, but it was there. And then I\nsaid, \"Okay, I will go.\u201d But when I came into the house...I forgot to tell you, my...the\npictures...the pictures of my youth. You know, I had so many. The beautiful portraits of my\nancestors, they were hacked to pieces in that Kristallnacht. My mother's apartment looked\nunbelievable and the beautiful picture. I didn't mind my picturers, my drawings of my youth but\nthe picture of my beautiful grandmother. And so I left and my mother followed in a few days. I\npurposely did that and when she came without trouble. She could come over, but she left\neverything and came like that to Amsterdam and I was...we were happy to have here. But the\nKristallnacht was something which has to be thought of you know. I was there. I saw it. I saw the\ndestruction. It's sad. Terrible. I had a friend who came to me, not a Jewish friend, and she\nbelonged to the aristocracy there and she said, \"You know we are so desperate.\u201d Her father in\nlaw was a very high, you know, very religious. And she said, \"Believe me, we are not all like\nthat. Believe me. We think it's terrible.\u201d But of course, they couldn't do anything. There were the\nNazis and they have the power and in Beareth they had especially power because there was a\nteacher who helped Hitler before and the Wagners, of course. I didn't even talk about the\nWagners yet. Huh? Would you like to know about the Wagners and my family? Now my...I only\nremember that we always had singers coming and staying in my father's house who were singing\nfor . With their little children, they always talked about and grandma, but it was who was the\npower of course behind the throne. And I remember there was in white and between and the\nyoungest daughter and her husband , he was the greatest anti-Semite, the Englishman. So we saw\nthem walk all the time. Beautiful old ladies, smiling, angelic, but the devil as we all know.",

And my father knew Seigfrid and when I was graduating\nSeigfried gave me permission to play the piano, his piano, in our...I know that when I left school\nI played by Greek on the piano, on Seigfried Wagner's piano. Yeah, he was nice. It was she who\nwas the bad one. But Seigfried was very nice. Whenever he saw me, he waved to me. You know\nthat's...that's passe, of course. And so I left. My mother left and that was all about Germany and I\ndidn't want to hear about Germany anymore.",
        "A: Yes, that was in 1938 and we settled her down and then, of course, \u2019*we knew what was\ncoming. And then I got...I went to Switzerland. I worked in the....No it's very important. I had\nfever and the doctor said I must go away, get away from Amsterdam, from that fever place so to\nsay and I went to Arosa. And I meta friend and he said, \"Go to this hotel outside of Arosa. I was\nthere and my husband left me and on the first evening I went down, consoled myself by putting\non along gown, evening dress which I loved, and I'm called to the telephone. And my husband\ncalled me. I had just arrived you know, and he said, \"You have to come back.\u201d I said, \"What?\"\n\"There is the invasion of Vienna.\u201d I think it was...not yet, I mean the Nazis went to Vienna. I\nforgot. In any case, I said, \"I can't. I have high fever.\u201d He said, \"Then I'll call you tomorrow.\u201d\nAnd I come out and there stand two elegant Germans. They said, \"Ah, . We observed you are so\nbeautiful. Will you come out?\" I said, \"I am not accustomed to go out with strangers.\u201d They said\nyou must speak a very educated talk. I said, \"Oh,\" I said, \"You listened? \"If you listened,\" I said,\n\"then I tell you that I just heard that you invaded Austria.\u201d \"That couldn't be,\" he said. This\ngentlemen is the of some paper. I said, \"But it is true.\u201d And I let them stand there. But I knew\nthat I was on their list so I had letters. That was before Arosa. That was in . And I had bags...my\nhusband wrote me every day. And I went to my bag to look for them in the bag. The letters had\ndisappeared. So I knew...the chambermaids. They're all German chambermaids. They had taken\nmy letters, and the next day it was brought back. And so I said, \"I cannot stay here in that hotel\nwith those.\u201d So I went down to the gentlemen and said, \"I will not stay here in the hotel.\u201d He\nsaid, \"Why not?\" I said, \"Your guests. I don't like your guests.\u201d And I wonderful chance. One\nof the skiers saw me from Holland. He came. He said, \"You know this lady is here in the hotel.\nDon't you know here?\" I said, \"Yes.\u201d I called her up. I said I have got to get me a room. That\nwas the lady from Holland. She said, \"I will.\u201d So she got me a room. I took a sleigh and left\neverything in the hotel and I knew I was on their list and that was true. That was the beginning.\nBut they...but I was on the list. They had stolen my letters from my husband and so on. And that\nwas now 39 I think. So that was...we knew we were... how could I say... not only my husband,\nbut I was too on the list. And there it was. And then, you know, the invasion and we knew it. I\nsaid to my little housemaid when we went on vacation for a few days in August. I said, \"Stay\nhere.\u201d She said, \"Why.\u201d \"I said, \"Best. The Nazis come.\u201d She said, \"It couldn't be.\u201d I said, Yes.\u201d\nWe were on vacation and after the second...on the second day the maid comes in and while we\nwere having dinner and said that three gentlemen are outside. They come and then a screaming\nstarts. My children never forgot it. There was these three Gestapo people there and two Dutch\npoliceman and they wanted to have Mr. Model into prison. Yeah. And they screamed. That was\nthe worse thing. And I went up to him. I was so furious. Said, \"Why do you do that.\u201d He said,\n\"He's in our books 6 years.\u201d \"What for?\" \"Smuggled dollars.\u201d I said, \"My husband smuggled\ndollars?\" \"Yes, Ma'am. American Bank.\u201d He didn't really do it. So I immediately dumped into\na train, left my children there, went to Amsterdam and came to my house and the maid said,\n\"You know, they were here with Mr. Model. They opened every drawer and looked and left my\nin pieces and everything. They looked for papers and, of course, they couldn't find it, so that was\nthe beginning of the prison. At the same night at 11 o'clock at night, my maid comes...that little\nmaid...a very patriotic Dutch girl and she said, \"There's a gentlemen... had sent away...there's a\ngentleman and he's one of those who was here with Mr. Model when he came with the Nazis,\"\nshe said, \"and he said he insists that he has to talk to you. I said, \"Okay, if he insists. Put him in\nyour room.\u201d So I went there and it was one of the Dutch officers. You know I told you there\nwere the Gestapo and then two Dutch officers. And he said, \"Please, Mrs. Model, trust me.\u201d I\nsaid, \"Why should I trust you?\" He said, \"I am the other international law that we are forced to\nbe with the Nazis when they do something with Dutch citizens you know.\u201d And then he took out\na little match box and in that matchbox inside he had what he only could written. He had\nwritten...he had 9 people I should warn. And I warned them of course. He said, \"Please trust\nme.\u201d I said, \"But why should I trust you?\" He said, \"I tell you a story. Last year...two years\nago...I don't know...we had caught a young German who came due, he said, who came over with\n5 and the police called your husband because when they asked him, \"What do you do with the...\nHe said he delivered something to Mr. Model . Now he said...the policeman said latter...We\nknew Mr. Model had a perfect name. He wouldn't smuggle . So they called my husband. My\nhusband said, \"I can't come. Come to me.\u201d So they came. Three policeman with this young\nGerman Jew and my husband said, \"Do you know me?\" \"No.\u201d My husband said, \"I have never\nseen that boy.\u201d But he said, \"Let me be alone with him.\u201d So the police left, went the other room.\nThey were very polite and my ...my husband said, \"How did you get my name?\" He said, \"I\nbought it.\u201d So he said, \"What?\" \"Yeah, there is an exchange in Berlin and your name was on the\nhighest list. I paid 800 marks for your name as the one who helps everybody.\u201d I swear it this was\nthe truth what I tell you. So he had my husband's name and gave the police knew he wasn't\nsmuggling. So my husband said the police that they should not put him back to German...send\nhim back to Germany. And he vouched for him and he gave him money that he could go in\nthat...\u201d\u2019 which at that time was only a detention camp and not a...later became that terrible camp.\nSo my husband got it done that that boy who got him into difficulties was not put back to\nGermany. And this was the policeman. He said, \"And I was there when your husband pleaded\nnot to put that boy back. And I said to myself if I ever can do something for that man will. And\nnow was my opportunity because when I came there I knew I will help.\u201d And he said, My\ncolleague...colleague I don't know.\u201d But the funniest thing is that next day in the afternoon, the\ncolleague called me and said, \"Ah, he so wonderful. We got him something to eat in the morning\nbefore he went to the Gestapo headquarters.\u201d Imagine. They're all heart that because they saw\nhow wonderful he was. In prison...the prison...they said, \"He's so wonderful...he had...he gives\ncourage to everybody. He said to them when they walked in the prison yard, he said, \"Don't\nworry. They will not last out here. Then will not last 10 years,\" to the people you know. That was\nhim you know.",
        "A: Did I?\nwas Inspector Karloff. Never will I forget the name. And he said, \"I think he's a wonderful man\nmyself.\u201d And I said, \"And you keep him in prison yet?\" \"But he's our enemy?\" I said, \"What do\nyou expect?\" You know he's too naive. Can you imagine? And so they kept him and kept him\nand kept him. And he could...he...he didn't get my letters. I got his letters which were desperate.\nHe never got a letter and I wrote every day. I sent somebody to the prison. (Sigh) He didn't...and\nthey didn't give it to him. And he was tortured because there were bombings from the English at\nthat time. But they were lost and then I get an anonymous telephone call from The Hague when\nhe was about 4 weeks in prison. And he...there was a German speaking and said, \"You don't\nknow me but I know about you and I know about your husband. I would like to see him.\u201d I said,\n\"He's not here.\u201d \"Where is he?\" I said, \"In prison,\" and bang the telephone went down. I should\nnot say in prison. He was in prison. And that was it. A week after that, the same thing. \"Can I\ntalk to Mr. Model?\" I said, \"He's in prison.\u201d \"Wait a moment,\" he said, \"I come.\u201d So there came\na tall, nice, portly German who said, \"I did not put my car in front of your house, which was nice\nwith the Gestapo of course. But I have to tell you that I am not your enemy. I'm your friend\nbecause Mr. Model did something so fabulous once for me. You know he always did things. I\nwant to help him.\u201d I said, \"You only can help him when you get him out of prison.\u201d And he\ndisappeared, you know, and that was it. And then I didn't hear anything and then one day I get a\ntelephone call Saturday morning and the same voice said, \"I see clear. I talked to that Karlo. And\nthat was it. And then in the afternoon at 2 o'clock a taxi comes and my husband was home. But\nthat wasn't the end of it. Every week one of the Gestapo people came to the bank and got him to\nThe Hague or to Rotterdam, and he never told me what happened there. He never told me. But\nevery week twice, three times, they called him again. Cat and mouse you know. H",
        "A: Oh, he was the collector of the...of the dollars all over Europe, which wasn't true at all of\ncourse. It was...it was actually the...uh...you know...then...yeah...then I was at the Gestapo for the\neighth time. I never came...I always went to the Gestapo and he interrogated me, and on the\neighth time, he said, \"Something terrible has happened while I was away.\u201d I said, \"What has\nhappened?\" He left...left the other man go and I was alone with him. And he said, \"Some people\nhave...I had forgotten about this even...\"Some people have offered money for Mr. Model's\nrelease.\u201d I said, \"What?\" \"Dollars,\" he said. I said, \"We have no dollars. My husband has no\ndollars.\u201d We delivered it to the Dutch. We were supposed to deliver it. \"No, no, no. 4 thousand\ndollars or 8 thousand dollars.\u201d I don't remember. In any case, suddenly I...he said...he mentioned\na name, Mrs. Levy. This Mrs. Levy, she was at my door, but I didn't receive her. He said, \"Yes,\nbut she was not Jewish.\u201d She had the name....she was a German who worked together with the\nMexican Consul to get money out of the people. And he said...when I was in prison...I forgot to\ntell you that men came in...a banker and said, \"Outside is a lady. She can help to get your\nhusband out of prison.\" And immediately I knew. Impossible! I knew that wouldn't be possible.\nSo I said, \"I don't believe you.\u201d \"Oh,\" he said, \"Yes.\u201d I said, \"Oh, 1t costs money.\u201d \"Yes, it costs\nmoney, but what is money for the release of Mr. Model?\" I said, \"It's nothing, but for me it's\nsomething because I don't have any dollars.\u201d \"And anyway,\" I said, \"I can't. \"Who's the lady?\"\nHe said, \"This is a Mrs. Levy.\" So I knew the name you know. And when I was there he said,\n\"Mrs. Levy came to him and offered the Gestapo...1magine, he said, 4 thousand or 6...8 thousand\ndollars...I don't know...for the release of . Of course, he couldn't do that. I said, \"No, you couldn't\ndo it, of course.\u201d That was the beginning and I knew darn well that they had...they wanted...we\nwould have paid...they would have paid 4 thousand dollars and then they would have come to us\nand give us 8 thousand dollars because that's what they did. But I didn't do it. I knew my husband\nwould hate it, and he said later he was so glad for that I didn't believe them and didn't let...I didn't\nsee Mrs. Levy ever. But she interfered with my life because she wanted money. Later after the\nwar, I heard, she was taken into prison by the Dutch with the Mexican Consul because she\ncheated and got money. I know people who paid her the money. But very nice people, Cohen,\nfrom Amsterdam. I heard that they paid the money. I didn't because first of all, I didn't have it.\nAnyway, that was...that was the beginning you know. And then we get a telephone call from the\nAmerican Consul, knew my husband, of course, my husband works for an American bank. And\nhe said, \"Mrs. Model, you have to get him out of the country.\u201d I said, \"Don't I know that? Don't I\nknow that?\" And before the Nazis came, on the day before the Germans marched in...I forgot to\ntell you...I had in my living room about 13 people who all wanted to leave the country with my\nhusband because they knew where he is there 1s action and they can do something. But my\nhusband said, \"I cannot leave. I have 40 people who depend on me.\u201d But I will help you and we\ngot in touch with other people. And there was a cousin of mine. He said, \"I am a criminal but I\ndon't go.\u201d He said, \"I cannot go if he doesn't go.\u201d I said, \"I cannot go if he doesn't go. I stay, of\ncourse.\u201d It was...ah...I never can forget that afternoon and they were all there and the Belgium\nConsul even offered us that we could go, and he said he wouldn't go because some 40 people are\ndepending on him. He cannot go. And he looked at me and I said...funnily enough I had...he said\nto me later, \"Why did you not say anything.\u201d I said, \"I had a feeling we would get out anyway.\u201d\nReal funny thing. I have a feeling we'll get out.\nfrom Rotterdam. I was not permitted to take a taxi but I did, jumped into the train and arrive, and\nthere he stands and he smiles a little bit. And he said, \"I think we will make it.\u201d So he had told\nme that while he was talking to the Consul he remembered his other Spanish visa. He went to the\nSpanish Consulate and there was one girl left. And she said, \"I can't do anything.\u201d He said, \"Here\nare...I don't know how much money he gave her...Dutch money. Please. To your favorite charity,\nbut please put a Spanish visa and she did. She did. That was our savior...that unknown girl put a\nSpanish visa in our passport. And then he went back to the Americans Consulate and said to him,\n\"Here, I have a Spanish visa.\u201d Then, of course, I...I had to sign different things and at 3 O'clock\non that Saturday afternoon, here comes out a very looking man. I forgot his name, thank God. He\ngave me my passport, gave me his hand and said, \"Here is your passport.\u201d For you, I miss my\ngolf. I swear it. That's what he says. And I said, \"But you saved our lives.\u201d He said, \"For you, I\nmissed my golf.\u201d And then we went to Amsterdam and I had to tell my mother that we will leave\nand we didn't...and my sisters after me died when my husband was prison, and then I.... It was\nterrible, of course. You couldn't tell people, but I had to tell my mother and my brother.",
        "A: Of course. We couldn't take her. And then. I must think back. Then that was Saturday.\nAnd on Sunday, my husband went to see my mother. He was so wonderful to her. And while he\nwas gone, I get a telephone call from that man with whom my husband worked Underground\nwhom I knew very well. I mean my husband didn't tell me, but I knew. I knew the work of that\nfriend of ours. And he said...it was 3 o'clock in the afternoon, Sunday afternoon. Monday\nmorning, we had to be at 7 o'clock with our two bags on the Grand Central Station. We would\nbe smuggled into a transport. And that ...and he said, \"I'm sorry. He has to be 8 o'clock...he has to\ngo to Grand Central Station. Don't ask any questions he said. So when my husband come in, I\nsaid, \"You have to be at 8 o'clock at Grand Central Station. Didn't know what...but he said, \"I\nwill be go.\u201d So you can imagine, I died a thousand deaths you know when he went at 8 o'clock.\nHe came back at Il o'clock at night. And this is when he had to memorize the undersea port\nstations in which the English bombed...the ones with the Nazis...when the Germans wanted him\nto bomb. And this was the list from that was the head of the Underground in The Hague who\nhad a blueprint and said my husband has to memorize that blueprint where where the U-boats\nare really built. And that he had to do. He had to memorize. You can imagine. In 2 hours! And\nthen the men from The Hague, who was the head of The Hague put...put his paper again and\nsaid, \"Good luck,\" and left with the blueprints and they were in my husband's mind. He didn't tell\nme what he had done, of course. I heard it only then in...1n Spain because he was so desperate\nthat he could lose the memory of that. Imagine, in they will be delivered...But he said the man\nfrom The Hague said, \"We waited for you. We had to have somebody with memory and brains.\u201d\nSo that...so that was the last thing, and then the next morning we went to the station. It was\nhorrible. My mother was standing in a corner. My brother was standing in a corner, and then we\nwent into a train. That is it. And that was goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. It was horrible. And then\nwe went the train. Halfway on the way to Brussels the door opens and out comes a very tall,\ngood-looking German officer. I think his name was Mr. \u2019 Von Hagen, Colonel von Hagens or\nsomething. He bowed to me and he said, \"Mrs. Model, I have to borrow your husband.\u201d And he\nwas a German officer. He said, \"Don't be afraid. I would like to talk to him.\u201d\u2019 My husband had to\ngo. I was sitting in that train. My children got frightened. You can't imagine how awful that was.\nAfter 20 minutes, he came again and that was the man who had just heard the name Model. He\nhad heard about my husband, and he always wanted to know whether we are a family of a\nGerman General from Model. And my husband said...I am not s family...we knew who we were,\nof course... I am not, and now and please let me go back to my wife. She will die a thousand\ndeaths because she went through quite a lot. So he said, \"Mr. Model, I only wanted to say you we\nheard so much about you and I am glad I met you,\" and he let him go. Now that same Mayor or\nwhatever he was kept his hand about me because I had a little basket. The kids called it because\nit was a little basket which we had from our boat into which I put three little on this side. The\nbooks I had from my husband, and a few drawings I had made of my husband and my mother\nand a friend. There were in that little basket which the kids called you know because I carried it\nmyself. So wherever we stopped in Paris...in...first in Brussels...1n Paris and we had to go out and\nwalk a little bit, this Gestapo man who was with that .... with that German officer came over to\nme and said, \"Open that basket.\u201d And every time he said it, that officer came said, \"Leave her\nalone.\u201d That went on four times. Four times he kept his hand over me. He said, \"Leave her\nalone.\u201d But in when he said goodbye, he came over. He said, \"I kept my hand...hand over you\nMrs. Model. What is in that basket?\" I said, \"You could have opened it. There are books, . But I\ndidn't... was glad he didn't, because when we opened on the boat these books because friends\nwanted to see it again, out fall drawings which a friend from Paris had made about Hitler and\npoems. Imagine that! That was my luck that he didn't force me to open that...that basket. That\nwas a wonderful man. I wish I had...I could thank him. Yeah. So then we were in Lisbon...in\nMadrid. In Madrid, you know we could only met because.... Yeah, I forgot. When we arrived in\nSandebastian, we were led to a hotel, and hardly had we entered that hotel when a young\nDutchman come over and said, \"Mr. Model, the Embassy from Madrid has already called three\ntimes. You have to call back. They have to talk to you immediately.\u201d So my husband called\nback. It was the Embassy, and the Ambassador said, \"I was told that you bring news. Please,\ntomorrow, you...you come to Madrid.\u201d My husband said, \"I cannot do that. I cannot just leave\nher. I have no visa. They knew that we had to. \"But you will get it.\u201d So next day came the Dutch\nConsul from Optowa. I'll never forget it. They're lovely old people there who had no visa. Of\ncourse, my husband said you have to get them a visa to Spain too. And he came, and it took 4\ndays until we got permission from the...from the Spanish \u2019things to travel through Spain to\nMadrid. And then we were in Lubrick, and he dumped us in the , and he said, \"You sit here. If I\ncome back after 2 hours,\"...He had a funny feeling...I couldn't get...get rid of my knowledge. \"If\nI'm stay a longer it's fine, but you have patience, and he dumped us in . The kids run around the\nof course, and I was sitting at with these other people also. And he came after 2 hours, looked\nterrible and said, \"I couldn't talk to him.\u201d When I enter he came over to me, \"Ah how wonderful\nthe ... He said, \"Ah, you know that I play golf with the German ambassador all the time. He's\nsuch a nice man.\u201d When my husband heard that, he said, \"For God's sake,\" so he didn't tell them\nabout the , but he had knowledge of a few other things and he told them that. And the officer\nsaid, \"Yes, but have told that bring out the most important news about Underground. No?\" Max\nsaid, \"That must have been an error,\" you know. And he came to me and he said, \"My God, if the\nman is Lisbon is the same caliber, I have to call America with my knowledge and then it's too\nlate. But the man in Lisbon was wonderful. My husband spend the whole week with who was\nthe Under Secretary and when we were on the boat he heard on the radio then...on the ship's\nradio...that the Dutch replaced and the from became the Ambassador. That was...he never\nknew....that baron never knew that it was the little Jew from Amsterdam who cost him his post.\nYeah? Isn't that? The...the turn of events is just miraculous in a way, you know? It's just...you\ncan't believe it sometimes. Yeah. And then we landed in Lisbon. It was nice to be there. You\ncould breathe again. The kids liked it, and he worked with the Embassy every day. Yeah. And\nthen friends...they learned the boat was , which was a boat for 150 people where there were 500\non the boat, you know, all refugees. All refugees, of course, some spies too. We were five in a\ncabin. We paid three thousand dollars which was sent from America. My sister-in-law sent the\nmoney for the boat to pay for. We paid. Some didn't you know. There was a whole bottom of the\nboat was full with...with...uh...young immigrants from all over and they, of course...they didn't\npay a penny, but we were...we could pay so therefore we pay. Huh? And there was guy \u201d*on the\nboat behaved very badly. His wife at least. He didn't. And the Rabbi from Luxembourg, we were\nelite there, we were first class because we paid. But this couple who had money with no\nrefugees, the son-in-law of the conductor, , and lovely wife and son and I think and then, of\ncourse, it spoke around immediately that my husband does bring from the bottom of the bunk,\nand a Dutchman. Everyday the kids...he organized those kids so they put the food which were\nabove the table and put them down because they didn't get any food you know. The people down\nthere was organized. Every day the kids went down and...and did that.",
        "A: Yeah. We got more...we got food...more food, but our food too to divide too. But then\none day that young man came, that Dutchman came and said a baby was born. And it's terrible\namongst these many people. It's terrible...the wife...the young wife of a young Russian or Polish\nviolinist...I cannot forget it. \"We must have a room. We must have a room.\u201d So my husband\nstarted and we go to because they had a living room on the boat. They had a saloon on the boat.\nHe said, Mr. , you have to give up your saloon. She said, \"I can't.\u201d He said, \"Why can't you?\" \"T\nhave to receive people.\u201d My husband said, \"Whom do you receive? I won't come anyway.\u201d Do\nyou receive the Rabbi of Luxembourg, and Mr. and Mrs. something on the ?\" No, she couldn't\ngive her room. So that was number one. Then, he went to the Luxembourg Rabbi and he said, \"I\ncan't give it this room. A friend of my wife is living there.\u201d Then he went...of course, the people\nwho had no living room and wanted out of first class...our friends wanted to give their bathroom,\neverything. But you couldn't then. Then the purser came to my husband who had observed my\nhusband of course, and said, \"You know, Mr. Model. I give him...give them my room because I\nsaw how tough it is.\u201d So that young of wife then came to the purser's room. I give you these little\nsketches. Everything is the purest truth what I tell you, not that I want to make up, but it's true. It\nis true. So that young baby was looked after in the purser's room on top of the ship and not in the\nbottom of the ship. Yeah. So that was....1 was so happy when was permitted in the radio room\nthan the room of \u2019Sandame. And Madrid was replaced by that one he had made. So he was\nvery happy and he became....\u201d * became the Ambassador. No? That's another story. Huh?",
        "A: No, I mean...I he was...he had nothing to say. Bella was everything you know. Bella was\nthe ruler and she...she was standing on the bottom on the...on the rung. I was sick. I wasn't up\nvery much. She said, \"My daughter, my daughter, My daughter.\u201d \"What about your daughter?\"\n\"Eva is still in Paris.\u201d Of course, Eva is a very nice person. I later met her. I helped her when she\nwas in New York. Very nice woman. And she was married at that time and couldn't get, but she\ncame out and that was her whole complaint. Only that Eva comes out. But he didn't say much I\nmean. She run around with a book on her back so my husband said, \"Why do you run around\nwith that book?\" Do you think some people can buy....\u201d\u201d You know he was...he had a...he had,\nbut Bella, Bella and later we saw them in New York a few times and he was always very\napologetic you know, and I liked meeting him. The daughter came and I liked her very much.\nShe was a few times in my house and her husband was selling. Bags full of sketch, not sketch,\nbut were etchings and she went from rich people to rich. Sometime she came to me to have\nlunch. She's a wonderful daughter, and she sewed for him them at that time. You can imagine\nlater it was different by that time. Just had to get money. He was brought over by the Cultural\nMission or something but they...of course they paid for his apartment I'm sure but...so she sold\nthese books which she got. She's a wonderful daughter. Really. Really wonderful. He was a...He\ncouldn't say anything. He was rude by here. And then one day I see him in the street and he\ncried. She had died, and he was desperate. Then shortly afterwards he fell in with a young\nEnglish girl. It wasn't so terrible you know. But he was a nice man. He was just a weak man you\nknow. I had nothing against him. And Eva was wonderful. I saw her later when she married .\nVery nice. Had two boys, so she was very very nice woman. Eda. She was very rich, but she also\ngives. She was not like her father was, stingy. She gives. She gives pictures here and there. I\nadmire her very much. Very nice, very nice.",
        "A: Oh, yes. One day I was bed. I had high fever, and I heard singing and I went down. There\nwere a few Viennese young boys with \u2019Leadere and I went up to one and I said, \"Aren't you\nashamed? You sing a song of Vienna. There your grandfather cleaning their streets.\u2019\u201d\u2019 He looked\nat me. He said, \"So I sang But two young girls came down and said, \"Oh excuse us because it\nwas so rude and stupid of that man and I was perfectly right and she will see that I don't sing\nany... That's what he sang all the time with his guitar. So that was another thing, but he didn't\nsing it anymore. Yeah. About...about...because you asked me about the boat. Yeah. Otherwise,\nthe kids had a lovely time and somebody tried to teach them the...the national anthem and they\nhad a good time and my son, my older son, who had so much tears when his father was in...1n\nprison and later in Paris when he had to go away. He cried and cried but then he comes to me and\nthere was my old, smiling lovely boy who was his old self. He had...1t was a miracle. There\nwas...his father was there. He didn't have to be afraid that they come and take his father.",
        "A: Yeah. I forgot. I have to tell you that of course. We landed in Staten Island, and there\nwere...my sister in law and some friends, and he had taken an apartment in Fifth Avenue so we\ncould go there and the kids started immediately to...it's wonderful for them. You know, the high\nskyscrapers and everything. They loved it. And, of course, it was terribly hot but nothing was\nbad. It was so wonderful to be in America you know. That was it. My husband got immediately a\njob, and that was also wonderful and so we stayed for a few week and a month in that Fifth\nAvenue apartment and then I looked around and found....and then we had to go up Riverside\nDrive at night to see somebody who asked him to see...I don't know who it was...and we stepped\nout of Riverside Drive on Seventy Second street, and I look around and I said, \"It's lovely here.\u201d\nAnd I see...on the other side, I see something that looked like an apartment to...rent. I went over\nand this was the apartment I rented. Just like that. First one, and I rented it the next day. That\nwas...yeah...and I'm still there. Yeah. Now asked me some questions. I talk and talk because but\nplease.",
        "A: Well, as an artist, I mean I thought nothing but these two little things, but I wanted my\nchildren to get out of New York. I wanted them to learn English without an accent because I had\nseen in Holland when the children lived with their parents, they had an accent. They learned it.\nBut then a friend of ours...I said I have to get them in a school outside of New York until a friend\nof ours she got us the addresses. And one afternoon when the kids...I put them in a camp....you\nknow we had friends who had told us about a camp, so the kids were in a camp already after a\nweek. Just gave me tips you know. There... You have to have a friend, you know...was one of\nthem then you know, and I went then...we got a telephone call. A young man came and said and\nsaid we should come out on Sunday. And I said, \"We will do that of course.\u201d And it was very\nchancy little man. He was...He was sent....I said, \"Yeah. Sent to look us over.\u201d He said, Yes.\u201d\nAnd he stumbled over a table where some photographs...the only thing I could take were\nphotographs and the photograph fell down. He said, \"Who did that?\" I said, \"I did.\u201d He said,\n\"Oh, Mrs. Model, your children are in because our chairman \u201d\u2019*is one of the big publishers and he\nloved children of artists. So it was. I came there and they immediately got accepted. Of course,\nmy older one immediately was...in spite of he didn't know English he was in short time on top of\nhis class. It's just fabulous. Peter always was was very intelligent, but immediately on top and\nloved and adored by the others. And \u201d was...he's like that. So that was from the beginning and I\nhad a wonderful time in the boarding school outside of New York.",
        "A: We got a scholarship, by the way. That's what I wanted to tell you. I was adjusted\nimmediately. I didn't have any trouble whatsoever. I felt at home. I spoke English, of course, and\nmy husband spoke English and we were immediately...we...we immediately felt that's where we\nwanted to be. We had some American friends and that was wonderful. And it was no trouble. I\nmean I...just wonderful, so we took...And that's it. I can't say anything but perfect results.",
        "A: My husband was in the banking brokering business. But he had a...was a specialist. He\nwas something very special also in that because after his work and somebody come to me in\nAmerica and said, \"You know I made a study of your husband's brain and I saw there were only\n18 people in America who could do what he did,\" but I never knew what he did. So that was a\nlittle exaggerated, but 1t was surely truth. And he could work immediately, and it was very\nimportant. And people were awfully nice, Americans...the Americans we knew, but for one.",
        "A: Yes. That was very strange. He gets a telephone call. I must not forget to say something.\nWhen we were in Staten Island and that immigration officer interrogated us didn't want to let us\nin because we had no hotel. We had only , which was address of my husband's office business.\nAnd he said nobody lives on. My husband said, \"I know. My family and my friends are down\nthere. They will tell us where we live. I can't lie to you,\" he said. \"I can't tell you I live in that\nhotel where we were before, but I have no address. This is business.\u201d And he was very nice. But\nthen finally my husband took out his Dutch career papers and he said, \"Why didn't you tell me\nbefore?\" He said, \"I didn't need to. I have a perfectly valid passport with a perfectly valid visa,\"\nwhich was true. And he didn't want to do it, but then he had to do it. And so that was the\nreception. And then we were boat...the boat left us to Manhattan skyline and we saw it was\nbeautiful, Staten Island. Not Ellis Island. It was Staten Island. Yeah. It was beautiful. We were at\nhome. The kids were at home immediately. There is no doubt. My youngest son said to\nme...after a week, he said to me, \"Mamma, can you believe...if I tell my friends in Holland that I\nam accustomed to skyscrapers, they wouldn't believe it.\u201d I'll never can forget he said that. It's\ntrue.",
        "A: Oh, yes, so the FBI knew of course then through this immigration thing that he was a\nDutch career you see. So they approached him and said they trust him. Could they use him to be\ntheir...when they need...when they need something to know about Holland and all that.\u201d So that\nwas when they called him, very often. And about people whom they had, you know...and my\nhusband, of course, never said anything negative about the people. Then, afterall, we didn't know\nthem. We only know one friend and we said he's a very rick and wonderful man. But this is way\nasked. He never told me really what they asked him, but he went constantly. In the first year, he\nwas constantly called to help them because they trusted him. He was a Dutch career. They\nbelieved. And they saw the papers you know. So that was very good, of course. And I...when we\nsuddenly became citizen, he was...you know I talk a lot, and then he said But my husband always\nwarned her, \"Mina, you get yourself in deep water. Don't do that.\" Mr. Roosevelt was in there\ntoo, but he was a leftist organization. Don't forget you must tell these interrogation officers for\nthe citizenship, you must tell them that you were a member of these things. He was so asked me,\n\"Did you belong to any organizations.\u201d \"Yes,\" I said, I belonged to that but I left after 2 years.\nThat was true. They knew everything. And he knew that. Through the FBI, he knew. They would\nask everything. So I was safe. I wouldn't have thought about it, that I was a member once. But\nthat was the truth and I was so happy. And they were very nice because I was not a member any\nmore. All these little things come back now when you ask it you know.",
        "A: To that?",
        "A: I don't know what you want to know about...about my...my life. Didn't you say...",
        "A: I really don't...I don't want to remember so much about that now. We were free of them\nand, of course, I left my family and all of them. That was tragic and terrible.",
        "A: In the concentration camp. She was there. And my brother was sent away and the kids\nwere sent away. This is my book then, in this book. It was terrifying. It was terrible, of course,\nand my husband's sister died in... That was the other thing, and..uh...after the war....ah...you\nknow, it's really...we should...we started a new life, and we were very happy here. The kids were\nhappy here. My husband was happy here too. It's only terribly that I had to lose him so early.\nBut otherwise, it was a wonderful life. We had nice friends, and I had my...my work. You asked\nme about my work.",
        "A: We had a wonderful...I had immediately nice friends. I became a member of the women's\nassociation, and I exhibited there an I got a gold medal. I told you that. And I could work and I\nhad a one-man show, which was very nicely then. I had...they were very good to me. I mean I\nwas really...they liked what I did let's say. And...uh...I was happy. That's it. America was good to\nus and is good to us. So what more do you want?",
        "A: Is that really what you wanted to know?",
        "A: [...I.... was so afraid I would not be able to tell what you wanted to know.",
        "A: I talk. I talk.\n"
