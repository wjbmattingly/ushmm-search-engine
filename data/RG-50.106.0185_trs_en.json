        "A: Not really. Except that he got married in 1910 so that\u2019s kind of an earmark date.",
        "Q: In Romania?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Your mother\u2019s name?",
        "A: Helena Rubinstein and she was a first cousin to Helena Rubinstein. So that\u2019s the family\nbackground.",
        "Q: And was your mother also born in the same town your father was?",
        "A: No, no, no. My mother was well you know these, these Jewish birthplaces, they kind of\nchange because the Rubinsteins were all born in a little itty bitty village called Myelitz [ph|\nwhich nobody acknowledges.

        "Q: Two half-sisters?",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: I. My father\u2019s first wife died in childbirth. You know back in the olden days when and so I\nhad that half-sister. And then my mother well anyway, then there was another one and then there\ncame me. So we were three half-sisters.",

        "A: He was a furrier. In Leipzig Germany, everybody was a furrier.",
        "Q: What brought them to Leipzig?",
        "A: Actually it was interesting. My father initially was sent to Leipzig from Romania, a city\ncalled Wistoki where the family owned wooded, many forests. And a saw mill. And he was sent\nto Germany to sell the lumber. And stayed. And then got into, because everybody in Leipzig had\nsomething to do with fur. He drifted into the fur business.",
        "Q: And was he successful?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Fair. I mean considering that most of this was the depression, nobody was that\u2014but ok.",
        "Q: Were your parents very religious?",
        "A: Modern orthodox. In fact you might even have heard of this. Leipzig had a very famous\nrabbinical family, the Kalmbach [ph]. You probably heard of Shlomo. Well Kalmbach was my\nschool principal. I went to Kalmbach\u2019s private school. And he was my school principal. And\none of my classmates was Shlomo\u2019s cousin. And I was very close to the Kalmbach children.",
        "Q: What was the first name of the principal. Do you know? That\u2019s ok.",
        "A: It\u2019s been a long time.",
        "Q: Just a few years. So you said your parents were modern Orthodox. You went to this Jewish\nschool, Kalmbach school.",
        "A: Yes and Kalmbach was our family rabbi. He had the modern Orthodox synagogue in Leipzig,\nthe big \u2014",
        "Q: There was a big one?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember the name of it?",
        "A: I think it was referred to as the Kalmbach schul.",
        "Q: Were your parents Zionists? At the time?",
        "A: My father was. My mother was not, figure that one out.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: How did that manifest with him? Did he speak about \u2014",
        "A: Well, I guess he always wanted to go to Israel and never did. Or Palestine. And my mother\nalways had her eyes set on the United States. She never made it but she, she had three brothers in\nSeattle, Washington. And if it hadn\u2019t been December 7 killed it all. No, they \u2014",
        "Q: Once we went to war you mean.",
        "A: They had papers to go to Cuba. Legal, I mean valid papers. They were purchased but they\nwere for real and if December 7 hadn\u2019t happened. Ok because of the American immigration\nquota system, my father was number 34 on the list to come to the States. So there\u2019s only one\nthing nobody told you. The Romanian, Romania only got two visas a year. So being number 34\nmeant a 17 year wait.",
        "Q: So he was still considered Romanian even though he lived in Leipzig.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And your mother also was considered Romanian?",
        "A: Yeah because she, we only\u2014you know the family passport was Romanian passport.",
        "Q: Even though you were living in Germany. Ok. Let\u2019s talk about you as a young child now that\nwe\u2019 ve talked about your family. You went to --",
        "A: I was very precocious. I was a snot nosed kid. But I was bright. In fact it\u2019s kind of\ninteresting because when I was six years old somebody took me to some Zionist meeting. It was\nsort of a commemoration of somebody who was a hero. Joseph Trumpeldor who died, da, da,\nda and here is this little six year old and she says well what\u2019s so great about dying for your\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010\ncountry. Isn\u2019t it more important to live for it. And I thought that was a pretty astute comment\nfrom a six year old. Me.",
        "Q: How did the teacher answer that?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t a teacher. It was a youth group. Very, they were quite impressed. As I say I was a\nkind of a bright snot nosed kid. I don\u2019t think I was quite as smart as I thought I was. But I was\nfairly bright. Which has stood me in good stead over the years. In fact I guess growing up when\nI did I grew up sort of confrontational and I think it stood me well all my life. I like to say I\u2019ve\nnever been aggressive but I\u2019ve always been assertive. Fine distinction but a good one.",
        "Q: What\u2019s the distinction?",
        "A: That when you are aggressive you hold things, you have boundaries. It\u2019s not all free floating.\nAs aggression can fly in every direction. Assertiveness is focused. At least to me that was the\ndistinction.",
        "Q: You went to school. Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood? Was your house in a Jewish\nneighborhood in Leipzig?",
        "A: No it was a mixed neighborhood.",
        "Q: So did you have friends who were not Jewish?",
        "A: Yes, yes we did. Actually you probably wouldn\u2019t know about this but there used to be a very\nfamous German encyclopedia called Brachhaus [ph]. You know it\u2019s, take my word for it. It was\nvery famous. And the Brachhaus family lived across the street from us and Leipzig of course\nwas a publishing city. And very few people know that but you know the, not pocketbooks but\npaper backs, quality paperbacks were published in Leipzig long before the, the names were\ncoined. Because we had these publishing houses in Leipzig and boy I had a whole collection of\nEnglish novels that I read by the time I was ten years old.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: So you were able to speak English?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How did you learn that? in school?",
        "A: Leipzig being a city that had fairs also had language institutes where they trained translators\nand interpreters and it was a three month course and you kind of lived, I mean I didn\u2019t have to\nlive at the school because I was from Leipzig, but most students lived there. And it was\nimmersion study.\nYou had breakfast with your teachers. You went for a walk. You couldn\u2019t use anything but\nEnglish. If you couldn\u2019t say it in English, you couldn\u2019t say it. It was agony while it lasted.\nHowever, when I came to the States as an immigrant, I didn\u2019t have to take a single required\nEnglish college course. I passed every single college course, high school and college entrance\nby exam.\nThe only thing I couldn\u2019t pass was Shakespeare.",
        "Q: What other languages did you speak, did you know besides German and English?",
        "A: Well I spoke a little Hebrew. And English and French. From school. Still speak a little\nFrench.",
        "Q: What were your other interests as a child?",
        "A: Mostly reading. No I wasn\u2019t too much into sports because I was very near sighted as a kid\nand in those days we didn\u2019t have plastic glasses, so you know I couldn\u2019t go in for sports.",
        "Q: Cause they would break\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Because my glasses would you know a tennis ball in a pair of eyeglasses can be fatal. So I\nkind of was a little bit removed from sports and tended towards books.",
        "Q: Were you very close to your parents. What kind of relationship did you have with them?",
        "A: I was much closer to my mother. Yeah I had a, we had a good relationship. I think my dad\nwas a little bit of a control freak, but then I guess most parents were in those days.",
        "Q: Your two sisters, what were their names?",
        "A: One was Clara and one was Miriam.",
        "Q: Were you close to them?",
        "A: Well no because they were much older\u2014they were close to each other. Well one of them I\nwas fairly close to and in fact the one that ended her life in Israel, I actually went and spent six\nmonths with her in Beersheba before she died. She was quite, well she, she ended up with\nAlzheimer\u2019s. But that\u2019s all right. I mean she was a nice person. And she had, she had good, she\nhad had a good husband and family so she was well taken care of. And I spent six months\nhelping her. And things worked out ok.",
        "Q: To get back to your childhood. You said you were very independent, it sounds like you were\nvery independent and doing what you thought you should be doing.",
        "A: Well yeah because one of, part of the independent bit was as kids we belonged to a Jewish\nyouth group. And parents were not really that much. You know. It was a double edged sword for\nthe parents but \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember the names of the groups?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, Habonim. Oh yes I was a very upright Habonim member. And then when I went to\nSwitzerland they didn\u2019t have a Habonim and suddenly became Hashamir Hatsaya [ph] as the\nnext substitute.",
        "Q: But you also had non-Jewish friends that you played with when you were a youngster.",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "Q: When did you know that conditions were starting to change. I mean you were born in 1923.\nDid you, when did you ever hear of a man named Hitler. Do you remember the first \u2014",
        "A: Yes, 1933. I think I heard about him the day I was ten years old.",
        "Q: The day you were ten, ok what did you hear about him? Do you remember what your\nimpressions were?",
        "A: Terrible things were going to happen.",
        "Q: Who told you, your parents?",
        "A: The neighbors, the parents, it was in the air. There was unrest. It was really turmoil in the air.",
        "Q: And a ten year old child sensed it?",
        "A: You picked that up, yes. It was, you could kind of cut it.",
        "Q: Were there any outward manifestations right then on the street or signs or banners or \u2014",
        "A: Well my, my strongest recollection is the week of Kristallnacht.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: Yeah, that\u2019s later. We\u2019ll get to that. I\u2019m talking about a little earlier. You\u2019re talking about 33\nand you heard that a man named Hitler.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Now in control. Did you \u2014",
        "A: Well told us about Hitler and Hindenburg together. You know as a ten year old you didn\u2019t\nseparate that much.",
        "Q: Is it something you talked over with your family?",
        "A: Mostly in the Habonim group.",
        "Q: Mostly with your friend, ok.",
        "A: Mostly with your contemporaries.",
        "Q: Did you hear any speeches over the radio by Hitler?",
        "A: Yes. And not only that, but not wanting to but without being able to help it, I actually saw\nhim. I was crossing a major street in Leipzig when his car you know he was Heil-ing Seig Heil-\ning in his open vehicle, driving along \u2014",
        "Q: The motorcade you mean.",
        "A: The motorcade and I was at the curb. And I couldn\u2019t help it. I had to look at him. (laughs)",
        "Q: And you knew exactly who he was.",
        "A: Of course, I mean Seig Heil. I mean everybody knew who he was.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: I assume you did not do the salute.",
        "A: Of course not.",
        "Q: Did other people on the street \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t think people noticed me. Everybody was focused on him.",
        "Q: Him. So they did not notice that you \u2014",
        "A: I mean I was a little, I was small. I was not visible. I\u2019m still only five feet.",
        "Q: And then, again when did conditions start to change. It was 33, 34, 35. Do you remember any\nprogression, any signs or treatment by neighbors. What non-Jewish neighbors, did they ever say\nanything negative or positive to you?",
        "A: Oddly enough, believe it or not we had very good non-Jewish neighbors who were very\nfriendly. And like the night, just before Kristallnacht, they came and warned us and told us not to\ngo out the next morning. That the party had sent out word that all members had to show up in\nmufti. And start shooting and looting. And it was, Kristallnacht was planned down to the last\ndetail. And I knew all about it, before it happened. I was told the night before to stay home and\nbe careful. By non-Jewish neighbors.",
        "Q: What were their names? Do you remember?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: But I guess you know Leipzig was a stronghold for communism and I think our neighbors\nmight have been communists. And that might have been the warning connection. And I didn\u2019t\nthink of it at the time but in retrospect it would make sense.",
        "Q: Up til Kristallnacht did life go on for you as a child, as a 10, 11, 12, 13 year old normally?\nDid it go on, you don\u2019t remember any restrictions cause \u2014",
        "A: No, I mean I went to my private Jewish school.",
        "Q: Ok that was still functioning, all the way til Kristallnacht.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It was not closed or anything like that?",
        "A: No, until \u2014",
        "Q: Any restrictions on your father\u2019s business? That you know of.",
        "A: Well I, I think between the economic situation and being Jewish it wasn\u2019t going too well.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t going well but it wasn\u2019t taken over or closed down.",
        "A: I mean I don\u2019t think he was closed, it wasn\u2019t shut down or anything. It was just Depression\nand \u2014",
        "Q: And your non-Jewish \u2014",
        "A: Actually I think it\u2019s kind of funny, looking back. I don\u2019t know if there was a middle class\nJewish trade or not. But you know Jews were never poor. They just had cash flow problems.\nAnd I don\u2019t think my parents would have ever admitted to not being well off.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: Did you have household help?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you have a car?",
        "A: No. My uncle had a Rolls Royce and we used it.",
        "Q: Very impressive. Speaking about your uncle, so you had an extended family that you were \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, my mother had two, had \u2014",
        "Q: That you were close to.",
        "A: I mean she had, she had a younger brother in Leipzig and we were all very close.",
        "Q: Did you get together on holidays?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you have any certain memories of any of the holidays, anything special?",
        "A: Actually this is kind of weird. My worst memory of Passover is we were always invited to\nthe same family for Passover Seder and I couldn\u2019t stand their silverware.",
        "Q: That\u2019s important.",
        "A: It, no 1t was cheap metal and it had a taste and my parents had a real problem understanding\nwhy I would go with, to Seder and not eat. That was one of the \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: Did you celebrate the Sabbath in your own home? Shabbat. Did you light candles? And your\nfather make a blessing?",
        "A: No my mother lit the candles and we always you know had challah and gefilte fish or regular\nfish or matzo ball soup or noodle soup. No we had the traditional.",
        "Q: Traditional holiday. Did you keep kosher?",
        "A: Yes and no. My mother kept kosher for my father. So we had a kosher kitchen. But when we\ntraveled she and I ate traife and actually with my father\u2019s blessing. He just said he was raised\northodox. He couldn\u2019t get himself to change. But he was really, he was sort of an accepting\nliberal kind of guy. And like if I was sick in bed and needed a treat, he\u2019d come home and bring\nme a package of ham, for sandwiches. So you know it was a tradition, not religion.",
        "Q: You said you were a big reader. What were some, who were your favorite authors?",
        "A: All the forbidden. Everybody who was forbidden. Leon Furtwangler, Max Broad. Leon\nTrotsky.",
        "Q: This is while you were growing up but it was forbidden for people to read those, yeah.",
        "A: And actually what we did was we passed around the paperbacks. We read them and as we\nfinished reading we tore off the pages and destroyed them so we wouldn\u2019t get caught.",
        "Q: This is for your youth groups.",
        "A: Mm hm. And I had --- oh the other thing is because in 33 all the German professors were\nfired from German universities.",
        "Q: The Jewish professors.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah. Since I went to the Kalmbach private high school, every one of my high school\nteachers was from what you call it. You know the one outstanding the one well known.",
        "Q: In Leipzig.",
        "A: No in Germany. What was the big university? Heidelberg. Practically every one of my\nteachers was from, was a Heidelberg professor. My physics teacher, my chemistry teacher.",
        "Q: Did you know about the book burning?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Here you loved books. Do you remember as a young person \u2014",
        "A: I actually remember, I watched them.",
        "Q: In Leipzig?",
        "A: Yeah, I saw them I saw the piles of books on the street in the middle of the road there being\nburned.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: And you passed by and you walked.",
        "Q: And you who loved books, what \u2014",
        "A: What. You know you kept on crying.",
        "Q: Were you frightened by that point seeing what was starting to happen in the country?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Tm not sure that, I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I was frightened. I\nthink I was unnerved. No I don\u2019t think I, I don\u2019t think fear was the word. In fact, one of the\npeculiar things about the fact that I was a Romanian citizen and my passport did not say that I\nwas Jewish, I could go out when nobody else, when all Jews were restricted, I could still walk\nthe streets because my passport didn\u2019t say I was Jewish. I mean obviously policemen were, on\nthe street people suspected, but they couldn\u2019t prove it. And since nobody could prove that I was\nJewish they couldn\u2019t keep me inside.\nSo when all the curfews and everything was going I was walking around freely.",
        "Q: I was going to ask you about the curfews and the limitations.",
        "A: I moved.",
        "Q: What did you do? Did you do anything special because you were able to \u2014",
        "A: Well that\u2019s how I, that\u2019s how all my volunteering started. We had this big, ok. The German\nno. The Polish government, after the, I forgot his name. now there was a 17 year old Polish kid\nwho killed the attach\u00e9 in Paris. And the follow up to that is the German government expelling all\nPolish Jews in Germany back into Poland. And they were all brought to the Leipzig railroad\nstation because you know there was a biggest railroad in Europe and they had all these sidings.\nAnd that\u2019s where I started volunteering. I decided these people all these people showed up in\nnightgowns. And I decided they needed toothbrushes. And so I looked up a man who had a\nsundry shop. And I knocked on his, went over to his house and knocked on his door. And I told\nhim that all these Polish Jews sitting on the railroad siding in their nightgowns and that they\nneeded toothbrushes.\nAnd I made a toothbrush distribution. Of all the crazy \u2014 well I guess it was as appropriate as\nanything else, wasn\u2019t it. Kind of weird in retrospect.",
        "Q: Did you do this by yourself?",
        "A: Yeah.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: It was your idea.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t a group of friends.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: You were just a young \u2014",
        "A: It was just me.",
        "Q: You were about 13 years old.",
        "A: No, 15.",
        "Q: Right, 15, right.",
        "A: Yeah I just, I knocked on the guy\u2019s door and I said you have all these sundry items and we\nhave all these people that are dislocated. They are waiting for transportation and they need some",
        "Q: Did you tell your parents you were going to do it?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And they said ok?",
        "A: Yeah, well they knew I was safe with my passport.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: Did you always carry your passport with you.",
        "A: Yep.",
        "Q: The other Jews in Leipzig at the time had restrictions.",
        "A: I guess.",
        "Q: Like curfew and so forth. Did they have restrictions that where they could go by that time or\nwere they, or they had freedom to go around the city.",
        "A: It seems to me they were pretty damn restricted. But one of the things I sort of clearly\nremember and that was kind of a horrible, horrible I\u2019ve just never forgotten it. Leipzig had some\nsmall rivers and they assembled the elderly bearded Jews on the river\u2019s edge. Now there was the\nriver. And you know there was paved, I mean there was little river bed and then there was like\npavement and then there were the walls. And what they had done was they rounded up all the\northodox Jews and made them face the wall and shot into the air. They didn\u2019t kill them. They\njust pretended to kill them all. And in some ways that was worse because you heard the shots.\nYou opened your eyes. You looked and they were still standing. But you know fear, being lined\nup against the river bed wall and hearing all these shot gun, I don\u2019t know if they were guns. I\ndon\u2019t remember what ammo they used but it was pretty \u2014",
        "Q: And you actually saw this?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I stood.",
        "Q: By chance or did they force you all to come out.",
        "A: No, I made a point of going out.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: How did you know it was going to happen?",
        "A: I heard the neighbors talk.",
        "Q: The same neighbors that \u2014",
        "A: The communist neighbors.",
        "Q: That warned you about Kristallnacht.",
        "A: I was a very feisty.",
        "Q: Sounds like it. Very unusual for a young girl.",
        "A: No in a peculiar way, I\u2019m not sure I can explain it but I guess I always kind of went along\nfeeling it\u2019s better to see than not to. I felt more in control being able to watch. I wasn\u2019t so\npuzzled. I could see what was going on. But I just sort of hoofed it around.",
        "Q: And then you came home and you told your folks what you saw.",
        "A: Yeah, mm hm.",
        "Q: What were their reactions to all this and what was happening?",
        "A: Horrified. Scared, upset. You know what you expect. And again you had to realize at the\ntime I wasn\u2019t quite as analytical as. It\u2019s easier to analyze looking back than \u2014",
        "Q: Did the other Jews in Leipzig have to wear a star?",
        "A: That came later.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: That came later. SO life went on except for these terrible happenings. Before, you went to\nschool. You did a lot of reading.",
        "A: Well particularly I went to this English translator school.",
        "Q: You learned English.",
        "A: Yeah I had all kinds of good friends.",
        "Q: These were non-Jews.",
        "A: These were non-Jews, but these were immersion classes and \u2014",
        "Q: they treated you well. Did you ever experience any anti-Semitism on the street or at the \u2014",
        "A: I\u2019m sure I did but I don\u2019t think it registered. Or if it registered, it didn\u2019t stick. I mean I\u2019m sure\nI was called names by other kids. I just can\u2019t remember the specifics.",
        "Q: Do you ever remember being frightened at any time.",
        "A: Not really.",
        "Q: Did you know what was happening in the rest of the world? Did you know about the\nAnschluss when that happened, when Hitler went into Czechoslovakia?",
        "A: Oh yes. As a matter of fact I was politically very astute. Because of my membership in the\nyouth group. No, I mean I think all of us were way ahead in political understanding from the rest\nof the population.",
        "Q: In your youth group, were they urging you to eventually go to Israel, to \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Not eventually. As soon as possible.",
        "Q: And how did they prepare you for that?",
        "A: Well looking back it\u2019s all kind of weird, because at the time they told you to go up and go in\nsome farm and learn agriculture to get hachshava. And you know looking back good lord I\nmean who came up with this you know what I\u2019m saying. But at the time it was a solution to a\nproblem.",
        "Q: How to be a good farmer.",
        "A: Yep.",
        "Q: What did you do? Milk cows?",
        "A: No. I dug potatoes. I harvested potatoes and one of the other strange things in all of this mish\nmash there was, there were some really large Swiss corporations and they owned acres on which\nthey grew stuff. And when I went to Switzerland we volunteered to dig up potatoes for the, for\nthe Swiss chemical companies. These companies, these chemical companies owned farmland.\nAnd they actually cultivated them and so we volunteered and we dug up their potatoes for them.\nIn exchange for which we got to live in a Swiss castle.",
        "Q: This was like a summer project, when you went to Switzerland?",
        "A: I guess so.",
        "Q: This is while you\u2019re still living in Leipzig that you went to Switzerland.",
        "A: No I just left, I mean | left Leipzig for good.",
        "Q: Oh you had already left. Ok we\u2019ll get to that.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",

        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And then tell me what happened. So what happened the next day.",
        "A: Well the next day as I said I took a walk through town and I \u2014",
        "Q: Your parents knew that, that you were leaving? By yourself?",
        "A: Yeah. I stuck my passport in my handbag and I walked. Well.",

        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: And what were the firemen doing? Anything?",
        "A: No. The, the other interesting thing and oddly enough was sort of years later, had a follow up\nright here in Washington, DC. The librarian from the Folger Theater. His aunt and uncle owned\none of the biggest haberdasher firms in Leipzig. And they, they were foreign subjects and so\nwhen they set things on fire in Leipzig in the Jewish stores, when they looted and had everything\non fire. They protected the foreign owned. They actually had the fire department with their hoses\nsprinkle down and save the foreign Jewish businesses. And Leipzig had one what they called a\nhigh rise. I mean the Hoch House. It was ten stories and it was English owned. The fire\ndepartment protected that. It could not be touched because it was foreign property.",

        "A: Shock, disillusion, sad.",
        "Q: Any fear?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I was afraid. I think what saved me was not being afraid. I think that\u2019s what\nhelped me get through it. I was just sort of leading with my chin up front. Maybe I\u2019m too stupid\nto be afraid.",
        "Q: Did you see any other synagogues being burned or just the Kalmbach?",
        "A: No, I saw them. They set fire to the Forum temple. It was only about two blocks.",

        "Q: It was permitted.",
        "A: In fact anything that helped get Jews out of Germany was initially permitted. Because\ninitially Hitler wasn\u2019t going to kill all the Jews. He was just going to get rid of them.",

When I remember, I\nstill get angry. Because there was no excuse for being that much of an ostrich. But anyway, I\nwas in Switzerland, and I sort of worked as an au pair and studied English and made the best of\nthings. And oh there were funny little things. I mean it was such a peculiar time. Like my parents\ncouldn\u2019t send me money. You didn\u2019t get permission to send money out of Germany anymore.\nSo they would send me pounds and pounds of nail polish which I could sell and that gave me\nspending money. Cause you know, I was kind of a 16 year old hustler, putting it in modern lingo.\nBut it gave me spending money.",

This is track number two and we were talking about your now\nbeing in Switzerland. And then you eventually obviously left Switzerland. How did that come\nabout and where did you go? Did someone in the United States sponsor you? Can you tell me a\nlittle bit about that.\nRuth Rappaport: Ok my mother\u2019s oldest brother sponsored me to come to the States.

        "Q: Had he sponsored anybody else before you?",
        "A: Well, actually it was kind of cute. There were three brothers. My mother had three brothers.\nAnd there were three gay bachelors in South America. And they had themselves a really good\ntime in Argentina. Having fun and dating and traveling and doing all sorts of things. And then\ntwo of them came to the United States. They worked their way up from Argentina to British\nColumbia. They settled in Westminster of all places. Little dumpy, not known for anything\nplace. And they got established there. And by the time I got to Seattle, I had three uncles to live\nwith.",
        "Q: You had said previously that he was quite wealthy.",
        "A: No, as I said he, during the Depression, his certified income was $350,000, he cleared, he\npaid income tax on $350,000 income. So that is, that was a good bit of change in 1935. And as I\nsay, I would never mention it expect that it\u2019s part of the affidavit so it is a matter of record. It\u2019s\nnot hearsay.",

        "A: They came to Switzerland.",
        "Q: And what did they say when they came to Switzerland about what was happening in\nGermany?",
        "A: Well what everybody else knew. I mean you know the usual. Wasn\u2019t anything different.",
        "Q: Why didn\u2019t they come to the United States at that time? Because of the quota system.",
        "A: Because of the quota system.",
        "Q: But you were able to get out under the quota system.",
        "A: Yeah well the whole thing was so weird because the United States went by where you were\nborn.",
        "Q: Oh, so since you were born in Leipzig.",

        "Q: Where did you leave from?",
        "A: Holland. And I don\u2019t know, a shuffle between. I sort of shuffled back and forth for a while\nbetween Amsterdam and Brussels. There was confusion about boat reservations. The war was\non. And so I got kind of trapped and having reservations, cancelling reserve \u2014",
        "Q: Now this is December 39 you are talking about.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And the war started September 39 so you\u2019re right.",
        "A: So I got caught in that whole wartime mishugenah planning.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: But were you handling it yourself or were your \u2014",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: You were handling it yourself?",
        "A: As a matter of fact. It had never occurred to me that my uncle from Seattle, Washington\nwould come to New York to look for me. And so when the ship arrived in New York, I was\nsitting up on deck, dumb, fat and happy, watching all the families reunite. Oh I had a great time\nbecause you know husbands and wives are meeting up and parents and children were meeting\nup. And it was such a lively good scene. People had gotten out of Europe. And they had made it\nto the United States and everything was sort of happy, happy, happy. And I was sitting up on\ndeck watching it all.\nBecause I didn\u2019t except anybody to look for me. And all of a sudden, in those days we still had\nthese little Western Union boys. With the funny little straps. And here\u2019s this little flag coming\nalong. Paging Ruth Rappaport, paging Ruth Rappaport. And finally I realized that was my name\nup there.\nAnd so I said that\u2019s me and so the little Western Union boy, he was dragging this five by five\ngentleman who turned out to be my uncle. And so my uncle is standing there and saying what in\nhell is taking you so long.",
        "Q: Had you met him before?",
        "A: Unh.",
        "Q: It was the first time you met him?",
        "A: Had no, the only thing that was funny is that also my father had a brother in New York. So I\nhad an uncle on each side of the family. And while they were looking for me, the two uncles met.\nAnd it was sort of sad because the New York uncle wanted me to stay in New York before going\nout west. And I was so tempted. You know I heard about Broadway. I had heard about New\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010\nYork. It was the middle of the war and I really, I was dying to stay in New York. But I guess I\nwas a good little kid, in spite of \u2014 because I decided they had come to New York and they had\nbeen sitting there for six weeks. Waiting for me.\nAnd the only, and they had to leave that day because uncle was involved in a court case in\nSeattle. And so when it was a question of immediately going to Seattle, or seeing New York, I\ndecided, if he can wait for me for six weeks, he deserved to have me with him. And let\u2019s face it.\nThat was in the day of the Pullman. We had two drawing rooms. Pardon me. I had my own\nbedroom.",
        "Q: You went first class?",
        "A: We went first class. Being in the salmon business, he shipped all his salmons with the\nrailroads so he was a preferred railroad \u2014",
        "Q: Customer.",
        "A: VIP. Person. And oh boy was it elegant. I mean the waiters with their white gloves. Serving\nall meals. And the only thing, I nearly died on that trip. Going west. Hear of Finamint.\nLooked like Wrigley\u2019s mint.",
        "Q: It was chewing gum",
        "A: Yeah, except it was a whatchamacallit. Make it go.",
        "Q: Oh a laxative.",
        "A: It was a laxative. And my aunt that poor lady. She had heard about you know the poor\nsteerage passengers from Europe. And how everybody had to straighten out their stomach. She\npulled out a package of Finamints. And all the way from New York to Seattle, every hour I got a\nFinamint. I nearly died.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010\nNow my uncle and I don\u2019t know if this had to do with kashrut or money but the biggest thing he\ncould do for you is buy you an ice cream cone. I don\u2019t think he ever ate ice cream when he was a\nkid. I don\u2019t know if it wasn\u2019t kosher. In that little village. Or I don\u2019t know why he never had ice\ncream. But you know he gave you a hundred dollars as a present, That was nothing. But he\nbought you the ice cream snack, he was really in love with you. He really loved you. And every\ntime the damned train stopped, I got an ice cream cone. I nearly died. I spent the entire trip.",
        "Q: You know where.",
        "A: In the bathroom. As I said, luckily we had private accommodations. But oh what a trip.",
        "Q: So you finally got yourself across country. Was it hard to say goodbye to your parents.",
        "A: Yeah. Except of course at the time, I hoped they would come. You know. It would have\nbeen a lot harder had I known what was coming.",

        "A: First cousins.",
        "Q: They were first cousins. Their fathers were brothers.",

And they had opened a\nbrand new office called the Zionist Emergency Council. And I was the office manager. And in\nfact I\u2019m really proud of my time there. Because one of the things I did that nobody else had\ndone before me to my knowledge was job sharing.

        "A: Being treated as German subjects and punished. I mean sometimes looking back at our own\nlegal manipulations you wonder, what, what in the hell were we doing. No really, it was all the\ngood about the United States. You know we had some awfully strange \u2014",

And actually I had an American friend who was a school counselor for the American\ndependent school system in Germany. She was living in Frankfurt. And she insisted I come and\nvisit. And so finally one day I decided I would visit her because I discovered Frankfurt was a\ngood place to visit. There\u2019s nothing to do in Frankfurt except have coffee at a coffee house once\nand that takes care of Frankfurt.\nBut from Frankfurt there are a million, it\u2019s a major railroad center. And I went down to the,\nevery morning I went down to the railroad station and I checked where the next train was going\nto. And if it got to an interesting city or place in one and a half hours, I\u2019d get on it. And spend\nthe day at like Rothenburg or Baden-Wirttemberg or up, up and down the Rhine river. On\nriver boats. And so I\u2019d spend the day sight-seeing. And depending how my friend Ellis felt, 1f she\nwas in the mood, we\u2019d meet up and go out for dinner together. Or else I'd go home and have\ndinner with her at home. And so \u2014",
        "Q: What was it like to come back to Germany?",
        "A: I went back with a horrendous amount of reluctance. I didn\u2019t think I was ever going to go\nback. And don\u2019t forget all the years Leipzig was East Germany, so I couldn\u2019t have gone to\nLeipzig anyway. I went back under really duress, by a friend.\nHowever, it was Easter vacation and we took her automobile and we put 2000 miles on the car\nduring the Danube trip and then the Vienna Woods trip. We went to Budapest, via Vienna and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010\ncame back through the Durnow, through the Danube riverbed.

I think what\u2019s really interesting is that all my coworkers are\nstill showing up here, picking my brains. At least twice a month, they come and have lunch here\nand they pick my brains about. To begin with they still had lots of employees I know. And so\nwhen they have a, and they have supervisory problems, please you know this kid. What do you\nthink I ought to do with Aaron.

        "Q: What are your feelings about Germany? Today?",
        "A: (pause) Ill tell you one little story which I think was interesting. When I went traveling with\nmy friend Ellis, since she doesn\u2019t speak a word of German, and I do. I was always in charge of\nthe arrangements. And the Germans are very polite. And when we said and I, you know I would\norder the meal in German. And invariably they wouldn\u2019t say who are you or where are you from\nor what is your background. What I was getting was, oh you as, for an American you are\nspeaking in excellent German. Now this is a whole bunch of bullshit because I do not speak\nexcellent German. I speak a teenage German. I speak a slang German. Well not really, semi\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010\nslang. And it was the German way of trying to find out who, what I am, without being too\ninquisitive was this line of your German for an American is so good. Da, da, da, da, da.\nAnd as I say it\u2019s just a slangy colloquial every day teenage German that I speak but that was their\nway of trying to place me. And what was interesting, among all those travels we did, there was\none hotel that was closed that we needed a place to stay. And the hotel people gave us a key to\nthe whole hotel and let us stay 1n it.\nI mean it was really sort of phenomenal the kind of nice experiences we had when we went\ntraveling. And it all seemed to have something to do with, as I said, people recognizing that they\nwere too polite to do too much fishing but they knew there was a story. And so without being too\nobviously curious they accepted the story.",

        "A: Some of it, I guess.",
        "Q: Any special meaning to it for you or not?",

        "Q: Is it because Yad Vashem is in Israel?",
        "A: In part. And because of the way it\u2019s laid out. And, and I don\u2019t think, I haven\u2019t told you. I had\na very sort of interesting experience when I was in Switzerland. In order to get out of Germany\nI, in order to get out of Europe, to the States. I couldn\u2019t go through Italy because whatever, no\ntransportation and this and that. And so the only way to go was by way of Holland. But in order\nto get to Holland I had to go back through Germany because whoever was controlling visas\nhadn\u2019t made a peace treaty yet and I couldn\u2019t get \u2014 the only way I could get out of Europe was\nby backtracking.\nAnd (pause) wait a minute.

I finally got out by leaving Europe in a strange little border town called Sansival [ph] or\nSumerwal [ph] or it was a strange sounding name. And the only thing on that trip leaving\nEurope 1s I did get to see the Monica [ph] on peace in Brussels on the way out. That was one\ncompensation for the weird travel I had to do. But it was a bad time to come to the States\nbecause the war was on.",

And I don\u2019t think I\u2019d been in Seattle more than a month and I trooped off to the\nstate capital demonstrating for fair housing. And so that was my, that was the beginning of my\nendeavors. And my friend, Felicia who is my oldest closest black friend, her son refers to me as\nhis home mama and he still comes and visits. And she has two sons. And they\u2019re both my\nfriends.

        "Q: But you did not feel your life was in danger?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: No, I always felt perfectly secure, even when the damn Blitz, moving that tank through town\nand pointing guns at the Americans or the Israelis. That\u2019s another whole chapter the British exit\nof unh. You know 20\" century history has been pretty ugly.",
        "Q: How long did you stay in Israel?",
        "A: Until July 1950.",
        "Q: Working as a correspondent.",

        "Q: These were government sponsored offices.",
        "A: Yeah. Dishcat Internat Hutz [ph] foreign press service",
        "Q: So you were fluent in Hebrew obviously.",
        "A: No. Foreign press service worked in English.",
        "Q: By living there did you become fluent?",
        "A: Well the Israel government sent a professor to my office every morning and I had one hour\nHebrew instruction but this didn\u2019t take too well. This nice little rotund man showed up one\nmorning. And I said what can I do for you and he said no you\u2019re not doing for me. I\u2019m doing for\nyou. I\u2019m your Hebrew teacher. Although had somebody put me on the right track, I could have\nlearned a hell of a lot more Hebrew, a hell of a lot faster than what I did. Because once you play\naround with the three root characters it becomes a very simple, simply structured language. And\nI almost feel like I could go in front of the computer and spend two months and learn Hebrew\nnow.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: Did you meet any of the government leaders in Israel?",
        "A: Well I went to parties with Moshe Sharet and in fact \u2014",
        "Q: Did you meet Golda Meir?",
        "A: Oh Golda and I are old friends. In fact this was very funny because when I went to \u2014 oh. I\ntook Golda to the top of the Mark Hopkins for a drink once.",
        "Q: This is much later obviously.",
        "A: No this is earlier. Golda was in the states on some fundraising. And I invited her for a drink\nto the Mark Hopkins hotel in San Francisco because of the view. And I guess she was forever\ngrateful that somebody did such a nice thing for her. And at the time, we had a drink at the Mark\nHopkins in San Francisco, Golda gave me a dirty look and she said, the trouble is people like you\ndon\u2019t\u2019 come to Israel. You\u2019re the kind of person we need. To get things going. To get things\ndone, to get things accomplished. But no you raise money to send other people. And them was\nfighting words. And I said don\u2019t bet on it. Next thing I\u2019m sitting in Golda\u2019s office and said, in\nTel Aviv and I\u2019m saying I would like to join the army. And she said what\u2019s the matter with you?\nWhy the army. And I said because when working in the kitchen Ill learn Hebrew and she said\nno, if you\u2019re working in the kitchen you\u2019|l be learning how to peel potatoes. She was a very\npractical lady you know. She had her feet firmly on the ground. And so I said well if it\u2019s not the\nkitchen.",
        "Q: What else can I do?",
        "A: What else can I do? And so she put me down at the foreign press office. She said with your\ncommand of English and your knowledge of newspaper work and publicity, and that\u2019s when I\ngot busy and I did we did pack, information packets each month. To Anglo language consulates.\nAnd I did the selection of all the pictures and the story line. I wrote the features. But I think\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010\nlooking back, I didn\u2019t initiate all that much. I just never let an opportunity slip. I mean I was kind\nof Johnny on the spot. And I guess it was always sort of you know well what if goes wrong. so\nwhat. And I just didn\u2019t worry about results too much.\nBut one of my, I guess one of the things that was sort of pleasing to me is among placing\nphotographs for publication we had a Canadian tank commander who was a Machal volunteer\nand I got his picture into Life magazine. And I thought that was an accomplishment. And I think\nthat my biggest contribution to this whole English publicity bit was that I took a very firm stand\nand I said the pick and shovel days are over. Israel needs big time money to get off the ground.\nYou don\u2019t get big time money and support of paving a road with a pick and ax. And so I said get\naway from this dumb publicity of the pioneer who does everything and get this, the people who\nare starting a state.\nAnd so all my publicity was geared to income producing like I did a wonderful series on Tapu\nHai Za\u2019havy [ph], the Golden Apples. I mean oranges. But orange export could to for the\neconomy.",
        "Q: The Jaffa oranges?",
        "A: Yeah and so I got into that kind of thing for the English press and that was kind of fun. And\nalso what it meant was that I attended the first of everything. The first Yama, the first holiday of\nthis, the first military parade, the first airplane show. I got to go to all of those. And that was\nkind of rewarding. It lasted for one year everything was a first and that was kind of great fun.",
        "Q: Did you have any contact with Holocaust survivors in Israel at the time?",
        "A: Not specifically. In fact \u2019'm not sure I wasn\u2019t avoiding it but I wasn\u2019t trailing the Holocaust. I\nwas future oriented, not backwards. What happened, happened.",
        "Q: Do you think it could happen again?",
        "A: (pause) Yes. Unfortunately, yes. Again it\u2019s less apt to happen now. We have more\ncompetition. The other groups who also have problems. The competing minorities. But anti-\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010\nSemitism is not dead. Sorry about that. And anybody who says it can\u2019t happen here, I have\nnews for you. It can happen anywhere any time. You hope and pray it won\u2019t. But I would not bet\nthat there won\u2019t be another \u2014",

        "Q: Extraordinary life you\u2019ve had.",
        "A: I think I\u2019m done.",
        "Q: I love what you said when you said your volunteering tendencies came from giving out\ntoothbrushes. To the Jews in the train car. So you\u2019ve continued volunteering. Do you think a lot\nabout those days now. You don\u2019t",
        "A: No. I told you. I\u2019m forward oriented. I mean what\u2019s the point. Most of what\u2019s happened is\nrecorded by now. We have a lasting, we have lasting documentary evidence. And just, no I look\nforward, not backwards.",
        "Q: Thank you for looking a little bit backwards. For history.",
        "A:You know what I\u2019m saying. And I still think it\u2019s kind of funny that all of this started with the\nPoles being shipped out of Germany.",
        "Q: Have you ever been to Poland?",
        "A: Yeah. Not to stay but passing through and short term.",
        "Q: Did you go to Auschwitz?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",

        "A: No. I went to one concentration camp in Austria. Forgot the name now.",
        "Q: Mauthausen?",
        "A: Yeah. But there\u2019s just been too much in pictures and pictorials. I mean no. I really try not to\nrelive the past. I think one of the things that\u2019s kind of ironic. I\u2019m sort of waiting to see how all of\nthis is going to play is I think the one thing that our president is doing right 1s the one thing he\u2019s\nhurt by. Because as he says, he\u2019s not a black president, he\u2019s a president who is black. And I\nthink the blacks have it in for him because he won\u2019t be a black president. And I think that\u2019s too\nunfortunate. And I\u2019m sort of afraid that he may be a one term \u2014 kind of too sad because it\u2019s his\nown folks who turn against him. I think the white population is much more charitable in terms of\naccepting him. I think the blacks are disappointed because he isn\u2019t playing to the blacks. It\u2019s\nunfortunate because I say that\u2019s the one thing he is doing. We\u2019Il see what happens but I\u2019m\nlooking a little, the political scene looks a little dismal right now.",
        "Q: You've lived through very dismal times in your youth.",
        "A: Well it\u2019s been an interesting period.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Helena Rubinstein and she was a first cousin to Helena Rubinstein. So that\u2019s the family\nbackground.",
        "A: No, no, no. My mother was well you know these, these Jewish birthplaces, they kind of\nchange because the Rubinsteins were all born in a little itty bitty village called Myelitz [ph|\nwhich nobody acknowledges. It\u2019s a suburb of Talnuf [ph[ which nobody acknowledges, which\nis a suburb of Krakow, which everybody acknowledges.",
        "A: Not. Well wait a minute. Her older brother was 40, her older brother died in 1947 and was 65\nand she was maybe three years older.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Well see it wasn\u2019t Romania then. It was the Austrian-Hungarian empire. They were both\nliving under Kaiser Franz Joseph. And they remember the historical connections 1s, whatever\nyou call the stratification.",
        "A: I had two half-sisters.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I. My father\u2019s first wife died in childbirth. You know back in the olden days when and so I\nhad that half-sister. And then my mother well anyway, then there was another one and then there\ncame me. So we were three half-sisters.",
        "A: He was a furrier. In Leipzig Germany, everybody was a furrier.",
        "A: Actually it was interesting. My father initially was sent to Leipzig from Romania, a city\ncalled Wistoki where the family owned wooded, many forests. And a saw mill. And he was sent\nto Germany to sell the lumber. And stayed. And then got into, because everybody in Leipzig had\nsomething to do with fur. He drifted into the fur business.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Fair. I mean considering that most of this was the depression, nobody was that\u2014but ok.",
        "A: Modern orthodox. In fact you might even have heard of this. Leipzig had a very famous\nrabbinical family, the Kalmbach [ph]. You probably heard of Shlomo. Well Kalmbach was my\nschool principal. I went to Kalmbach\u2019s private school. And he was my school principal. And\none of my classmates was Shlomo\u2019s cousin. And I was very close to the Kalmbach children.",
        "A: It\u2019s been a long time.",

        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: I think it was referred to as the Kalmbach schul.",
        "A: My father was. My mother was not, figure that one out.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Well, I guess he always wanted to go to Israel and never did. Or Palestine. And my mother\nalways had her eyes set on the United States. She never made it but she, she had three brothers in\nSeattle, Washington. And if it hadn\u2019t been December 7 killed it all. No, they \u2014",
        "A: They had papers to go to Cuba. Legal, I mean valid papers. They were purchased but they\nwere for real and if December 7 hadn\u2019t happened. Ok because of the American immigration\nquota system, my father was number 34 on the list to come to the States. So there\u2019s only one\nthing nobody told you. The Romanian, Romania only got two visas a year. So being number 34\nmeant a 17 year wait.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yeah because she, we only\u2014you know the family passport was Romanian passport.",
        "A: I was very precocious. I was a snot nosed kid. But I was bright. In fact it\u2019s kind of\ninteresting because when I was six years old somebody took me to some Zionist meeting. It was\nsort of a commemoration of somebody who was a hero. Joseph Trumpeldor who died, da, da,\nda and here is this little six year old and she says well what\u2019s so great about dying for your\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010\ncountry. Isn\u2019t it more important to live for it. And I thought that was a pretty astute comment\nfrom a six year old. Me.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t a teacher. It was a youth group. Very, they were quite impressed. As I say I was a\nkind of a bright snot nosed kid. I don\u2019t think I was quite as smart as I thought I was. But I was\nfairly bright. Which has stood me in good stead over the years. In fact I guess growing up when\nI did I grew up sort of confrontational and I think it stood me well all my life. I like to say I\u2019ve\nnever been aggressive but I\u2019ve always been assertive. Fine distinction but a good one.",
        "A: That when you are aggressive you hold things, you have boundaries. It\u2019s not all free floating.\nAs aggression can fly in every direction. Assertiveness is focused. At least to me that was the\ndistinction.",
        "A: No it was a mixed neighborhood.",
        "A: Yes, yes we did. Actually you probably wouldn\u2019t know about this but there used to be a very\nfamous German encyclopedia called Brachhaus [ph]. You know it\u2019s, take my word for it. It was\nvery famous. And the Brachhaus family lived across the street from us and Leipzig of course\nwas a publishing city. And very few people know that but you know the, not pocketbooks but\npaper backs, quality paperbacks were published in Leipzig long before the, the names were\ncoined. Because we had these publishing houses in Leipzig and boy I had a whole collection of\nEnglish novels that I read by the time I was ten years old.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Leipzig being a city that had fairs also had language institutes where they trained translators\nand interpreters and it was a three month course and you kind of lived, I mean I didn\u2019t have to\nlive at the school because I was from Leipzig, but most students lived there. And it was\nimmersion study.\nYou had breakfast with your teachers. You went for a walk. You couldn\u2019t use anything but\nEnglish. If you couldn\u2019t say it in English, you couldn\u2019t say it. It was agony while it lasted.\nHowever, when I came to the States as an immigrant, I didn\u2019t have to take a single required\nEnglish college course. I passed every single college course, high school and college entrance\nby exam.\nThe only thing I couldn\u2019t pass was Shakespeare.",
        "A: Well I spoke a little Hebrew. And English and French. From school. Still speak a little\nFrench.",
        "A: Mostly reading. No I wasn\u2019t too much into sports because I was very near sighted as a kid\nand in those days we didn\u2019t have plastic glasses, so you know I couldn\u2019t go in for sports.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Because my glasses would you know a tennis ball in a pair of eyeglasses can be fatal. So I\nkind of was a little bit removed from sports and tended towards books.",
        "A: I was much closer to my mother. Yeah I had a, we had a good relationship. I think my dad\nwas a little bit of a control freak, but then I guess most parents were in those days.",
        "A: One was Clara and one was Miriam.",
        "A: Well no because they were much older\u2014they were close to each other. Well one of them I\nwas fairly close to and in fact the one that ended her life in Israel, I actually went and spent six\nmonths with her in Beersheba before she died. She was quite, well she, she ended up with\nAlzheimer\u2019s. But that\u2019s all right. I mean she was a nice person. And she had, she had good, she\nhad had a good husband and family so she was well taken care of. And I spent six months\nhelping her. And things worked out ok.",
        "A: Well yeah because one of, part of the independent bit was as kids we belonged to a Jewish\nyouth group. And parents were not really that much. You know. It was a double edged sword for\nthe parents but \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, Habonim. Oh yes I was a very upright Habonim member. And then when I went to\nSwitzerland they didn\u2019t have a Habonim and suddenly became Hashamir Hatsaya [ph] as the\nnext substitute.",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "A: Yes, 1933. I think I heard about him the day I was ten years old.",
        "A: Terrible things were going to happen.",
        "A: The neighbors, the parents, it was in the air. There was unrest. It was really turmoil in the air.",
        "A: You picked that up, yes. It was, you could kind of cut it.",
        "A: Well my, my strongest recollection is the week of Kristallnacht.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well told us about Hitler and Hindenburg together. You know as a ten year old you didn\u2019t\nseparate that much.",
        "A: Mostly in the Habonim group.",
        "A: Mostly with your contemporaries.",
        "A: Yes. And not only that, but not wanting to but without being able to help it, I actually saw\nhim. I was crossing a major street in Leipzig when his car you know he was Heil-ing Seig Heil-\ning in his open vehicle, driving along \u2014",
        "A: The motorcade and I was at the curb. And I couldn\u2019t help it. I had to look at him. (laughs)",
        "A: Of course, I mean Seig Heil. I mean everybody knew who he was.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Of course not.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think people noticed me. Everybody was focused on him.",
        "A: I mean I was a little, I was small. I was not visible. I\u2019m still only five feet.",
        "A: Oddly enough, believe it or not we had very good non-Jewish neighbors who were very\nfriendly. And like the night, just before Kristallnacht, they came and warned us and told us not to\ngo out the next morning. That the party had sent out word that all members had to show up in\nmufti. And start shooting and looting. And it was, Kristallnacht was planned down to the last\ndetail. And I knew all about it, before it happened. I was told the night before to stay home and\nbe careful. By non-Jewish neighbors.",
        "A: No.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: But I guess you know Leipzig was a stronghold for communism and I think our neighbors\nmight have been communists. And that might have been the warning connection. And I didn\u2019t\nthink of it at the time but in retrospect it would make sense.",
        "A: No, I mean I went to my private Jewish school.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, until \u2014",
        "A: Well I, I think between the economic situation and being Jewish it wasn\u2019t going too well.",
        "A: I mean I don\u2019t think he was closed, it wasn\u2019t shut down or anything. It was just Depression\nand \u2014",
        "A: Actually I think it\u2019s kind of funny, looking back. I don\u2019t know if there was a middle class\nJewish trade or not. But you know Jews were never poor. They just had cash flow problems.\nAnd I don\u2019t think my parents would have ever admitted to not being well off.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No. My uncle had a Rolls Royce and we used it.",
        "A: Yeah, my mother had two, had \u2014",
        "A: I mean she had, she had a younger brother in Leipzig and we were all very close.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Actually this is kind of weird. My worst memory of Passover is we were always invited to\nthe same family for Passover Seder and I couldn\u2019t stand their silverware.",
        "A: It, no 1t was cheap metal and it had a taste and my parents had a real problem understanding\nwhy I would go with, to Seder and not eat. That was one of the \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: No my mother lit the candles and we always you know had challah and gefilte fish or regular\nfish or matzo ball soup or noodle soup. No we had the traditional.",
        "A: Yes and no. My mother kept kosher for my father. So we had a kosher kitchen. But when we\ntraveled she and I ate traife and actually with my father\u2019s blessing. He just said he was raised\northodox. He couldn\u2019t get himself to change. But he was really, he was sort of an accepting\nliberal kind of guy. And like if I was sick in bed and needed a treat, he\u2019d come home and bring\nme a package of ham, for sandwiches. So you know it was a tradition, not religion.",
        "A: All the forbidden. Everybody who was forbidden. Leon Furtwangler, Max Broad. Leon\nTrotsky.",
        "A: And actually what we did was we passed around the paperbacks. We read them and as we\nfinished reading we tore off the pages and destroyed them so we wouldn\u2019t get caught.",
        "A: Mm hm. And I had --- oh the other thing is because in 33 all the German professors were\nfired from German universities.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah. Since I went to the Kalmbach private high school, every one of my high school\nteachers was from what you call it. You know the one outstanding the one well known.",
        "A: No in Germany. What was the big university? Heidelberg. Practically every one of my\nteachers was from, was a Heidelberg professor. My physics teacher, my chemistry teacher.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I actually remember, I watched them.",
        "A: Yeah, I saw them I saw the piles of books on the street in the middle of the road there being\nburned.",
        "A: And you passed by and you walked.",
        "A: What. You know you kept on crying.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Tm not sure that, I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I was frightened. I\nthink I was unnerved. No I don\u2019t think I, I don\u2019t think fear was the word. In fact, one of the\npeculiar things about the fact that I was a Romanian citizen and my passport did not say that I\nwas Jewish, I could go out when nobody else, when all Jews were restricted, I could still walk\nthe streets because my passport didn\u2019t say I was Jewish. I mean obviously policemen were, on\nthe street people suspected, but they couldn\u2019t prove it. And since nobody could prove that I was\nJewish they couldn\u2019t keep me inside.\nSo when all the curfews and everything was going I was walking around freely.",
        "A: I moved.",
        "A: Well that\u2019s how I, that\u2019s how all my volunteering started. We had this big, ok. The German\nno. The Polish government, after the, I forgot his name. now there was a 17 year old Polish kid\nwho killed the attach\u00e9 in Paris. And the follow up to that is the German government expelling all\nPolish Jews in Germany back into Poland. And they were all brought to the Leipzig railroad\nstation because you know there was a biggest railroad in Europe and they had all these sidings.\nAnd that\u2019s where I started volunteering. I decided these people all these people showed up in\nnightgowns. And I decided they needed toothbrushes. And so I looked up a man who had a\nsundry shop. And I knocked on his, went over to his house and knocked on his door. And I told\nhim that all these Polish Jews sitting on the railroad siding in their nightgowns and that they\nneeded toothbrushes.\nAnd I made a toothbrush distribution. Of all the crazy \u2014 well I guess it was as appropriate as\nanything else, wasn\u2019t it. Kind of weird in retrospect.",

        "A: No, 15.",
        "A: Yeah I just, I knocked on the guy\u2019s door and I said you have all these sundry items and we\nhave all these people that are dislocated. They are waiting for transportation and they need some",

        "A: Yep.",
        "A: I guess.",
        "A: It seems to me they were pretty damn restricted. But one of the things I sort of clearly\nremember and that was kind of a horrible, horrible I\u2019ve just never forgotten it. Leipzig had some\nsmall rivers and they assembled the elderly bearded Jews on the river\u2019s edge. Now there was the\nriver. And you know there was paved, I mean there was little river bed and then there was like\npavement and then there were the walls. And what they had done was they rounded up all the\northodox Jews and made them face the wall and shot into the air. They didn\u2019t kill them. They\njust pretended to kill them all. And in some ways that was worse because you heard the shots.\nYou opened your eyes. You looked and they were still standing. But you know fear, being lined\nup against the river bed wall and hearing all these shot gun, I don\u2019t know if they were guns. I\ndon\u2019t remember what ammo they used but it was pretty \u2014",

        "A: Yeah, mm hm.",
        "A: Horrified. Scared, upset. You know what you expect. And again you had to realize at the\ntime I wasn\u2019t quite as analytical as. It\u2019s easier to analyze looking back than \u2014",
        "A: That came later.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Well particularly I went to this English translator school.",

        "A: Not eventually. As soon as possible.",
        "A: Well looking back it\u2019s all kind of weird, because at the time they told you to go up and go in\nsome farm and learn agriculture to get hachshava. And you know looking back good lord I\nmean who came up with this you know what I\u2019m saying. But at the time it was a solution to a\nproblem.",
        "A: Yep.",
        "A: No. I dug potatoes. I harvested potatoes and one of the other strange things in all of this mish\nmash there was, there were some really large Swiss corporations and they owned acres on which\nthey grew stuff. And when I went to Switzerland we volunteered to dig up potatoes for the, for\nthe Swiss chemical companies. These companies, these chemical companies owned farmland.\nAnd they actually cultivated them and so we volunteered and we dug up their potatoes for them.\nIn exchange for which we got to live in a Swiss castle.",

His aunt and uncle owned\none of the biggest haberdasher firms in Leipzig. And they, they were foreign subjects and so\nwhen they set things on fire in Leipzig in the Jewish stores, when they looted and had everything\non fire. They protected the foreign owned. They actually had the fire department with their hoses\nsprinkle down and save the foreign Jewish businesses. And Leipzig had one what they called a\nhigh rise. I mean the Hoch House. It was ten stories and it was English owned. The fire\ndepartment protected that. It could not be touched because it was foreign property.",

        "A: Shock, disillusion, sad.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I was afraid. I think what saved me was not being afraid. I think that\u2019s what\nhelped me get through it. I was just sort of leading with my chin up front. Maybe I\u2019m too stupid\nto be afraid.",
        "A: No, I saw them. They set fire to the Forum temple. It was only about two blocks.",
        "A: I assume. I mean yes there were people, just how closely they watched or whether they were\ndelighted or whether they were appalled, it\u2019s been, you know some of these details you don\u2019t \u2014",

        "A: Yeah. Except I mean my father was totally unrealistic. Hitler\u2019s going to last six months and\nthe Germans will know what a bargain. God Almighty. I mean never mind. When I remember, I\nstill get angry. Because there was no excuse for being that much of an ostrich. But anyway, I\nwas in Switzerland, and I sort of worked as an au pair and studied English and made the best of\nthings. And oh there were funny little things. I mean it was such a peculiar time. Like my parents\ncouldn\u2019t send me money. You didn\u2019t get permission to send money out of Germany anymore.\nSo they would send me pounds and pounds of nail polish which I could sell and that gave me\nspending money. Cause you know, I was kind of a 16 year old hustler, putting it in modern lingo.\nBut it gave me spending money.",

Did someone in the United States sponsor you? Can you tell me a\nlittle bit about that.\nRuth Rappaport: Ok my mother\u2019s oldest brother sponsored me to come to the States.

And so when the ship arrived in New York, I was\nsitting up on deck, dumb, fat and happy, watching all the families reunite. Oh I had a great time\nbecause you know husbands and wives are meeting up and parents and children were meeting\nup. And it was such a lively good scene. People had gotten out of Europe. And they had made it\nto the United States and everything was sort of happy, happy, happy. And I was sitting up on\ndeck watching it all.\nBecause I didn\u2019t except anybody to look for me. And all of a sudden, in those days we still had\nthese little Western Union boys. With the funny little straps. And here\u2019s this little flag coming\nalong. Paging Ruth Rappaport, paging Ruth Rappaport. And finally I realized that was my name\nup there.\nAnd so I said that\u2019s me and so the little Western Union boy, he was dragging this five by five\ngentleman who turned out to be my uncle. And so my uncle is standing there and saying what in\nhell is taking you so long.",
        "A: Unh.",
        "A: Had no, the only thing that was funny is that also my father had a brother in New York. So I\nhad an uncle on each side of the family. And while they were looking for me, the two uncles met.\nAnd it was sort of sad because the New York uncle wanted me to stay in New York before going\nout west. And I was so tempted. You know I heard about Broadway. I had heard about New\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010\nYork. It was the middle of the war and I really, I was dying to stay in New York. But I guess I\nwas a good little kid, in spite of \u2014 because I decided they had come to New York and they had\nbeen sitting there for six weeks. Waiting for me.\nAnd the only, and they had to leave that day because uncle was involved in a court case in\nSeattle. And so when it was a question of immediately going to Seattle, or seeing New York, I\ndecided, if he can wait for me for six weeks, he deserved to have me with him. And let\u2019s face it.\nThat was in the day of the Pullman. We had two drawing rooms. Pardon me. I had my own\nbedroom.",

But you know he gave you a hundred dollars as a present, That was nothing. But he\nbought you the ice cream snack, he was really in love with you. He really loved you.

        "A: In the bathroom. As I said, luckily we had private accommodations. But oh what a trip.",

And\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010\nwe had made arrangements and we had paid $10,000 for them to try and get Cuban visas, which\nwas legal you know you could. You could do it legally. And if it hadn\u2019t been for December\nseventh, my parents would have been in Cuba. And it was that damned December seventh that\nkilled it all. And in fact it was interesting because we paid $10,000 to make these arrangements\nand they, they offered the money back saying they could do nothing.",
        "A: Yeah and so we just, the Dickstein company. And so we just decided if there, they don\u2019t want\nto take the money, there\u2019s no point in pushing.

On\nriver boats. And so I\u2019d spend the day sight-seeing. And depending how my friend Ellis felt, 1f she\nwas in the mood, we\u2019d meet up and go out for dinner together. Or else I'd go home and have\ndinner with her at home. And so \u2014",
        "A: I went back with a horrendous amount of reluctance. I didn\u2019t think I was ever going to go\nback. And don\u2019t forget all the years Leipzig was East Germany, so I couldn\u2019t have gone to\nLeipzig anyway. I went back under really duress, by a friend.\nHowever, it was Easter vacation and we took her automobile and we put 2000 miles on the car\nduring the Danube trip and then the Vienna Woods trip. We went to Budapest, via Vienna and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010\ncame back through the Durnow, through the Danube riverbed. And we put 2000 miles on the car\nin nine days, never went to sleep. But what a trip.",
        "A: 80s.",
        "A: And oh I don\u2019t know. Years are kind of merging a little. But \u2014",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "A: I can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019ve been retired 19 years and it seems like a year. In fact I think this is\nmore interesting and I had retired. I think what\u2019s really interesting is that all my coworkers are\nstill showing up here, picking my brains. At least twice a month, they come and have lunch here\nand they pick my brains about. To begin with they still had lots of employees I know. And so\nwhen they have a, and they have supervisory problems, please you know this kid. What do you\nthink I ought to do with Aaron. He\u2019s just obstreperous.",
        "A: A little bit.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: I\u2019m active, oh Capitol Hill village. Are you familiar with that or not? That I think you might\nkind of check out. And if you don\u2019t know it, I think you should meet Gail Cohn. She is the\nexecutive director. And she is quite a personality.",
        "A: Hell no. I never felt German. I was Romanian.",
        "A: No. I mean you know I\u2019m sort of in between and betwixt. I had a passport from a country I\nbarely knew. I lived in a country where I didn\u2019t have a passport. I mean I was just kind of\nfloating.",
        "A: Oh yes. Now if I want to say, if I switch to German, I have to really push a button. I really\nhave to make a switch and force my -- I mean I can think in German but it\u2019s a conscious effort.",
        "A: (pause) Ill tell you one little story which I think was interesting. When I went traveling with\nmy friend Ellis, since she doesn\u2019t speak a word of German, and I do. I was always in charge of\nthe arrangements. And the Germans are very polite. And when we said and I, you know I would\norder the meal in German. And invariably they wouldn\u2019t say who are you or where are you from\nor what is your background. What I was getting was, oh you as, for an American you are\nspeaking in excellent German. Now this is a whole bunch of bullshit because I do not speak\nexcellent German. I speak a teenage German. I speak a slang German. Well not really, semi\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010\nslang. And it was the German way of trying to find out who, what I am, without being too\ninquisitive was this line of your German for an American is so good. Da, da, da, da, da.\nAnd as I say it\u2019s just a slangy colloquial every day teenage German that I speak but that was their\nway of trying to place me. And what was interesting, among all those travels we did, there was\none hotel that was closed that we needed a place to stay. And the hotel people gave us a key to\nthe whole hotel and let us stay 1n it.\nI mean it was really sort of phenomenal the kind of nice experiences we had when we went\ntraveling. And it all seemed to have something to do with, as I said, people recognizing that they\nwere too polite to do too much fishing but they knew there was a story. And so without being too\nobviously curious they accepted the story.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Not really. It\u2019s also, I mean I\u2019ve outgrown Leipzig.",
        "A: Yeah and they eventually tracked.",
        "A: Yeah.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: (whispering) Oh I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: (pause) I think I had a sense of relief when the thing was finally over. It just got to be tedious.\nIt went on and on and on and on.",
        "A: Some of it, I guess.",
        "A: It was just another part of the whole big mess. I mean I think that whole Nazi period is just\nsort of it\u2019s one big mess in my mind. And I really, I guess I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever really thought I\nwanted to sit down and isolate different components.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Ok. Personally, I like visiting the Yad Vashem. That\u2019s where I belong.",
        "A: I can identify with the lay out. I can identify with the righteous Christians. I can, I have all\nkinds of linkage to it. I think the Holocaust Museum 1s a truly great educational institution. But\nit\u2019s not my connection to the Holocaust.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: In part. And because of the way it\u2019s laid out. And, and I don\u2019t think, I haven\u2019t told you. I had\na very sort of interesting experience when I was in Switzerland. In order to get out of Germany\nI, in order to get out of Europe, to the States. I couldn\u2019t go through Italy because whatever, no\ntransportation and this and that. And so the only way to go was by way of Holland. But in order\nto get to Holland I had to go back through Germany because whoever was controlling visas\nhadn\u2019t made a peace treaty yet and I couldn\u2019t get \u2014 the only way I could get out of Europe was\nby backtracking.\nAnd (pause) wait a minute. This was going to go somewhere.",
        "A: And I kind of had a kind of a bit of a back and forth shuttle between Holland and it took some\ndoing. I finally got out by leaving Europe in a strange little border town called Sansival [ph] or\nSumerwal [ph] or it was a strange sounding name. And the only thing on that trip leaving\nEurope 1s I did get to see the Monica [ph] on peace in Brussels on the way out. That was one\ncompensation for the weird travel I had to do. But it was a bad time to come to the States\nbecause the war was on.",
        "A: No but Europe was \u2014",
        "A: And there was fighting in the channel. And travel was not easy. And I had to get out.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "A: Hell no, no. I-",
        "A: Yeah and not only that. Challenges were to be met. It\u2019s just that simple. Goody, one more\nstep to take.",
        "A: No, I was a very timid child. I was very shy. I was very quiet. I was smart.",
        "A: The events and things that happened. Having to meet what came along. No, I mean my\nwhole behavior is strictly existential. Meet what comes.",
        "A: \u2019'm not at all religious. I had really strong Jewish identity. I am not religious. What little, I\nmean I go to services off and on because it\u2019s the thing to do, but not because I\u2019m praying.",
        "A: Yeah, exactly. I mean I, you know I\u2019m very much a part of the Capital Hill Havurah. That\u2019s\nmy interest and that\u2019s my sphere of influence. And that\u2019s where I participate. And that\u2019s where I\nput my mouth. And that\u2019s where I put my money.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: About the only, the only part of that I feel I can kind of answer readily is I just lost my oldest\ndearest black friend. She just died. She had a mysterious infection and they still don\u2019t know what\nshe died of. But the first thing that happened when I came to Seattle, Washington, I heard about\nfair housing. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019d been in Seattle more than a month and I trooped off to the\nstate capital demonstrating for fair housing. And so that was my, that was the beginning of my\nendeavors. And my friend, Felicia who is my oldest closest black friend, her son refers to me as\nhis home mama and he still comes and visits. And she has two sons. And they\u2019re both my\nfriends. And they consider me their, ersatz mama. Both of them eminently successful. In their\nown endeavors. One is a computer security big shot.",
        "A: OK I spent oh dear god. I spent the siege of Jerusalem in Jerusalem. I fought the battle of Ben\nYehuda street.",
        "A: Yep.",
        "A: I manned the Spandau machine gun. I did. On my roof. I fed \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: No, I was in San Francisco. I was dancing the hora outside the opera house.",
        "A: On the first of January 1948.",
        "A: Mm hm. I was an advance party of one.",
        "A: The Zionist Emergency Council.",
        "A: No to prepare the way for VIP. Oh we were very clever. They were going to have all the rich\nSan Francisco Jews go on a mission. Now they call them missions. We were going to have all\nthe people who gave money and time to work towards partition. We were going to have this\npublicity flight, DP, destination Palestine. Oh weren\u2019t we clever. And so I was going to be the\nadvance party of one. And I was dispatched. And when I got there I sent a telegram saying war\nbroke out. Stay home. And at that time I was still connected to the Seattle publication. And the\nSan Francisco Emanuel Bulletin put me on their contributor list. So they took stories from me.",
        "A: Israel.",
        "A: Yeah.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yep. As a matter of fact I have a very nice letter, I just can\u2019t find it. The government of Israel\nfinally sent me this piece of parchment thanking me for my assistance in establishing the state of\nIsrael. But I can\u2019t find it. Don\u2019t know what in the hell I did with it.",
        "A: The what?",
        "A: Yeah. I was living in the tallest house on Ben Yehuda street in Jerusalem. And we had a\nSpandau machine gun on the top. And we trained it to the YMCA and we exchanged fire.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: Well somebody showed me. And you know people sort of sometimes say ok I seem to be war\nprone. And you know I frequently get this business of aren\u2019t you scared. And you know I\u2019m not\nscared. You know why. I pretend I\u2019m a spectator. I\u2019m not in this war. I\u2019m watching this war.\nAnd that\u2019s it, gets me off the hook. I don\u2019t have to worry.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: No, I always felt perfectly secure, even when the damn Blitz, moving that tank through town\nand pointing guns at the Americans or the Israelis. That\u2019s another whole chapter the British exit\nof unh. You know 20\" century history has been pretty ugly.",
        "A: Until July 1950.",
        "A: I was in the foreign press office. And I helped establish the Israel photographic archives.\nNever mind. I get side tracked into things.",
        "A: Yeah. Dishcat Internat Hutz [ph] foreign press service",
        "A: No. Foreign press service worked in English.",
        "A: Well the Israel government sent a professor to my office every morning and I had one hour\nHebrew instruction but this didn\u2019t take too well. This nice little rotund man showed up one\nmorning. And I said what can I do for you and he said no you\u2019re not doing for me. I\u2019m doing for\nyou. I\u2019m your Hebrew teacher. Although had somebody put me on the right track, I could have\nlearned a hell of a lot more Hebrew, a hell of a lot faster than what I did. Because once you play\naround with the three root characters it becomes a very simple, simply structured language. And\nI almost feel like I could go in front of the computer and spend two months and learn Hebrew\nnow.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Well I went to parties with Moshe Sharet and in fact \u2014",
        "A: Oh Golda and I are old friends. In fact this was very funny because when I went to \u2014 oh. I\ntook Golda to the top of the Mark Hopkins for a drink once.",
        "A: No this is earlier. Golda was in the states on some fundraising. And I invited her for a drink\nto the Mark Hopkins hotel in San Francisco because of the view. And I guess she was forever\ngrateful that somebody did such a nice thing for her. And at the time, we had a drink at the Mark\nHopkins in San Francisco, Golda gave me a dirty look and she said, the trouble is people like you\ndon\u2019t\u2019 come to Israel. You\u2019re the kind of person we need. To get things going. To get things\ndone, to get things accomplished. But no you raise money to send other people. And them was\nfighting words. And I said don\u2019t bet on it. Next thing I\u2019m sitting in Golda\u2019s office and said, in\nTel Aviv and I\u2019m saying I would like to join the army. And she said what\u2019s the matter with you?\nWhy the army. And I said because when working in the kitchen Ill learn Hebrew and she said\nno, if you\u2019re working in the kitchen you\u2019|l be learning how to peel potatoes. She was a very\npractical lady you know. She had her feet firmly on the ground. And so I said well if it\u2019s not the\nkitchen.",
        "A: What else can I do? And so she put me down at the foreign press office. She said with your\ncommand of English and your knowledge of newspaper work and publicity, and that\u2019s when I\ngot busy and I did we did pack, information packets each month. To Anglo language consulates.\nAnd I did the selection of all the pictures and the story line. I wrote the features. But I think\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010\nlooking back, I didn\u2019t initiate all that much. I just never let an opportunity slip. I mean I was kind\nof Johnny on the spot. And I guess it was always sort of you know well what if goes wrong. so\nwhat. And I just didn\u2019t worry about results too much.\nBut one of my, I guess one of the things that was sort of pleasing to me is among placing\nphotographs for publication we had a Canadian tank commander who was a Machal volunteer\nand I got his picture into Life magazine. And I thought that was an accomplishment. And I think\nthat my biggest contribution to this whole English publicity bit was that I took a very firm stand\nand I said the pick and shovel days are over. Israel needs big time money to get off the ground.\nYou don\u2019t get big time money and support of paving a road with a pick and ax. And so I said get\naway from this dumb publicity of the pioneer who does everything and get this, the people who\nare starting a state.\nAnd so all my publicity was geared to income producing like I did a wonderful series on Tapu\nHai Za\u2019havy [ph], the Golden Apples. I mean oranges. But orange export could to for the\neconomy.",
        "A: Yeah and so I got into that kind of thing for the English press and that was kind of fun. And\nalso what it meant was that I attended the first of everything. The first Yama, the first holiday of\nthis, the first military parade, the first airplane show. I got to go to all of those. And that was\nkind of rewarding. It lasted for one year everything was a first and that was kind of great fun.",
        "A: Not specifically. In fact \u2019'm not sure I wasn\u2019t avoiding it but I wasn\u2019t trailing the Holocaust. I\nwas future oriented, not backwards. What happened, happened.",
        "A: (pause) Yes. Unfortunately, yes. Again it\u2019s less apt to happen now. We have more\ncompetition. The other groups who also have problems. The competing minorities. But anti-\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010\nSemitism is not dead. Sorry about that. And anybody who says it can\u2019t happen here, I have\nnews for you. It can happen anywhere any time. You hope and pray it won\u2019t. But I would not bet\nthat there won\u2019t be another \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I think I\u2019m done.",
        "A: No. I told you. I\u2019m forward oriented. I mean what\u2019s the point. Most of what\u2019s happened is\nrecorded by now. We have a lasting, we have lasting documentary evidence. And just, no I look\nforward, not backwards.",
        "A:You know what I\u2019m saying. And I still think it\u2019s kind of funny that all of this started with the\nPoles being shipped out of Germany.",
        "A: Yeah. Not to stay but passing through and short term.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. I went to one concentration camp in Austria. Forgot the name now.",
        "A: Yeah. But there\u2019s just been too much in pictures and pictorials. I mean no. I really try not to\nrelive the past. I think one of the things that\u2019s kind of ironic. I\u2019m sort of waiting to see how all of\nthis is going to play is I think the one thing that our president is doing right 1s the one thing he\u2019s\nhurt by. Because as he says, he\u2019s not a black president, he\u2019s a president who is black. And I\nthink the blacks have it in for him because he won\u2019t be a black president. And I think that\u2019s too\nunfortunate. And I\u2019m sort of afraid that he may be a one term \u2014 kind of too sad because it\u2019s his\nown folks who turn against him. I think the white population is much more charitable in terms of\naccepting him. I think the blacks are disappointed because he isn\u2019t playing to the blacks. It\u2019s\nunfortunate because I say that\u2019s the one thing he is doing. We\u2019Il see what happens but I\u2019m\nlooking a little, the political scene looks a little dismal right now.",
        "A: Well it\u2019s been an interesting period.\n"
