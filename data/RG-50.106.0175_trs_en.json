        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview\nwith Anita Weingarten Etzyon, conducted by Gail Schwartz on September 3\", 2009 in Potomac,\nMaryland. This is tape number one, side A. What 1s your full name?",
        "Answer: My full name is Anita Etzyon.",
        "Q: And what name were you born with?",
        "A: I was born Anita Weingarten.",
        "Q: And where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in 1941.",
        "Q: What -- what day?",
        "A: October 4\", 1941 in a town, or city at that time in Poland. The name of the town is Boryslaw.",
        "Q: All right, let\u2019s talk a little bit -- let\u2019s talk a little bit about your family, who your parents were.",
        "A: Okay, my father, his name was Marek, in -- in engli -- in America he would probably be\ncalled Mark. Marek Weingarten and my birth mom, her name was Ethel Birenbaum from Chelm.\nOnce she married my father, she became Ethel Weingarten.",
        "Q: Ah, let -- let\u2019s talk about your father\u2019s background, what do you know about that? Where he\nwas from?",
        "A: He was born also in Boryslaw, Poland in 1906. April 25\", 1906, because my son was born 70\nyears down the road, April 25\", 1976. So I remember that. His background was, from what he\ntold me, is that at one point as a child he was sent away to -- I don\u2019t know if it was an orphanage\nor it was like a youth home for children. And he stayed there for awhile, and I think he was also\nschooled in that area. And then he returned. He also told me that his ancestors, or his father,\nwhich is actually my grandfather, his father came from Vienna. And in those days they made\nshidduchim, a shidduch, so he was matched up with my grandmother, who was from Poland, and\napparently from Boryslaw. So that\u2019s how the famil -- th-the roots of the family came from\nVienna into Poland into Boryslaw. And my father became a craftsman, but the word -- what\u2019s --\nnot a mechanic, but what is that called, the people who do fences from metal.",
        "Q: An iron -- an ironworker, or --",
        "A: I-I would say yeah. Worked with iron and created all kinds of things. And then s -- an-and --\nand I think also my grandfather was involved in it, but after awhile he gave it up and he decided\nto assemble bicycles. And he opened a little workshop for himself and he employed his younger\nbrother and he also employed a young man in that workshop and that\u2019s what they did, they\nassembled bicycles and sold bicycles because it -- in those years, that was the mean of\ntransportation, or you had a horse and a carriage, or you took the train. Not too many cars were\nyet in Poland. But what he told me that his dream was, before the war, to import cars into Poland\nand develop this -- this -- this whole idea of transportation. Well, unfortunately it didn\u2019t work\nout, World War 2 broke out and those dreams were shattered. The other thing also, which I can\nmention it, he told me that he also was drafted into the Polish army and he served in the Polish\narmy as a soldier.",
        "Q: What years was that?",
        "A: That is a good question.",
        "Q: Is this the --",
        "A: I think it was -- it must have been -- if he was born in 906, he must have been in his late 20\u2019s,\nI would say, maybe 22 - 24. And -- and he was very good in math, so he told me -- I asked him\nwhat was your job there in -- in the Polish army. And he told me it was buchalterie, which means\nit had to do with papers, and --",
        "Q: Bookkeeping.",
        "A: -- bookkeeping and whatever that was involved in.",
        "Q: Doy --",

        "Q: Do you know if he experienced any anti-Semitism in the Polish army?",
        "A: No, he never mentioned that, no, no. But --",
        "Q: Was he a religious man?",
        "A: He came from a religious background, but he was not a religious man at all. He just simply\nturned away from religion. He felt that religion separates people and that was his outlook on life.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s now talk about your mother and how they met, about your mother\u2019s background?",

        "Q: Your birth -- your birth mother.",
        "A: My birth mother, now I don\u2019t know when she was born, but I know that she passed away\nwhen she was like 26 - 27, so --",
        "Q: Which means you were how old?",
        "A: Oh, I wasn\u2019t even a year old, so if we can add to \u201941 -- go -- you know, go back. So that must\nhave been --",
        "Q: So she died in 1942?",
        "A: Yeah, yes, she did, right.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: And what do I know about her? From -- very little that whatever my father told me about her.\nShe was a dressmaker and studied in Vienna. And apparently she was a very good one, very\ntalented.",

        "A: Ethel.",
        "Q: And her last name?",
        "A: And her last name was Birenbaum. Ethel Birenbaum. And then, you know, when my father\nmet her -- and I think my father was in his 30\u2019s when he got married, I think maybe 33 - 34,\nsomething like that.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I think they were married a short time, maybe hardly two years and -- and less --\nprobably less than even two years. But --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] were married, they had you as their child. How did you get the name Anita\nin Poland?",
        "A: The name Anita, my father said he named me Anita because when he ended up in that\norphanage or boys\u2019 dormitory, whatever it was, or -- or -- you know, when you send -- it was, I\nguess, customary in Europe to send children sometimes to go to school away from home, and\nfrom what he told me that his family, financially it was difficult for them to raise four children,\nso they sent him away as a young kid. And he said the woman that attended in that orphanage,\nher name was Anita and she was very kind and very nice and he said if ever he will have a child,\nand she will be a girl, he will name her Anita, and that\u2019s how I got the name Anita.",
        "Q: Okay. Obviously you -- you were too young to know what was happening between 41 and\n\u201945 in Poland.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did your father remarry?",
        "A: My father remarried after -- immediately after the war. I was --",
        "Q: Oh, after the war.",
        "A: After, immediately after. Not during the war, after the war.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s talk now --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- between \u201941 and *45, which obviously you don\u2019t remember. What -- have you --",
        "A: But what I --",
        "Q: -- what have you been told about those years?",
        "A: Okay. Okay, I --",
        "Q: Dealing with your story.",
        "A: Right. I was told that the fellow that worked for my father, he was a Christian and I think a\nBaptist, he mentioned they were Baptists. And he lived not in Boryslaw, but -- but in a nearby\nvillage, apparently not too far. And when the war broke out -- and I was born in \u201941, in October,\nit was very difficult to hide with me as a child, and my father approached him. And apparently\nthey were very good friends on top of everything else, and my father approached him and asked\nhim if he would go to his -- he wasn\u2019t married yet, but he had a girlfriend, and his girlfriend was\na teacher in that village. And he said, you know, we cannot hide with my baby. Would you be\nwilling to take her? I'll pay you whatever I have, I\u2019ll -- you know, my money, and whatever I\nhave in terms of furniture, and anything that I have, I will give you and I\u2019Il help you to settle.\nTalk it over with your girlfriend. And so he did and -- his girlfriend at that time. They said -- she\nsaid fine, we marry, but we will have to move to another place because where did this kid come\nfrom, you know?",
        "Q: Your -- you --",
        "A: The neighbors would see a baby they would immediately know that they are harboring a\nJewish kid. Hiding.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re -- you\u2019re about a year old now?",
        "A: No, I was less. I must have been like five months, four or five months. Very young, very\nlittle.",
        "Q: Oh, I thought you said your birth mother survived for a year after you were --",
        "A: Separate, not with me. She was hidden separately.",
        "Q: Oh, oh.",
        "A: She -- we were -- yeah.",
        "Q: At this time your --",
        "A: At this -- no --",
        "Q: -- your birth mother was still alive?",
        "A: Mi -- at this time my birth mother was still alive, but we were separated. I was given to the\nBaptist family. Her name was Stefka if I remember correctly. His name I haven\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know.\nThe guy\u2019s name I don\u2019t know. Her -- her husband. Which eventually they married and moved to\nanother town. She was a teacher and apparently she got a job as a teacher. And with my father\u2019s\nfinancial help that he gave them, they were willing to take me -- and since they had no children,\ncause they were a young couple. And that\u2019s how I ended up with them. But in the meantime --",
        "Q: What -- what town did you -- do they take you to?",
        "A: This I have no clue. My father never mentioned the name and I don\u2019t -- even if he did I don\u2019t\nremember the ti -- the town. So I spent with them til 19 -- til the end of the war, which was like\n1945.",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of those years? You were only four, obviously, when you --",
        "A: Not quite four, because I think -- what I remember --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- not the --",
        "Q: You were three, three and a half.",
        "A: -- three and a half.",
        "Q: Any memory --",
        "A: Well, I remember the journey, on a big truck that they came and picked me up with his new\nwife that my father remarried. I remember -- what I remember after the war, we ended up in a\napartment building, in a tall apartment building, and I remember my father brought little\nDominoes and we were building something with stacking up the Dominoes and if I\u2019m not\nmistaken he lit a -- a match and he put like a match in between those Dominoes and somehow I\nhave this image. Whether it really happened, that\u2019s what, you know, I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s\nwhat I remember, sitting in an apartment building once I was apparently taken from the Christian\nfamily.",
        "Q: Now, what was happening to your father and your birth mother in those years?",
        "A: Okay. My father told me that he was captured, couple times by the Germans. And the way he\ntold me, that the Germans used to come into the town --",
        "Q: He stayed in Boryslaw?",
        "A: He stayed in Boryslaw. And what they did, they knew -- it was called aksia, like you know,\non this and that day the Germans are coming and speaking to the Jewish authorities, the rabbis,\nwhatever it is, we need so many Jewish workers for a certain project. Please make sure that on\nthis and that date they all concentrate in the square, they are ready to go. We build a bridge, or\nwhatever it may be. And my father was pretty clever, he realized that at that time already, you\nknow, there were rumors that they are being sent, but they\u2019re not being sent to build bridges or\nwhatever it 1s. So prior to that aksia he used to run away and escape from Boryslaw. During the\ntime -- I\u2019m going back now -- he managed to hide my mother -- my birth mother and my\ngrandmother with a Christian woman, and he paid her. And what he claimed was, she was hiding\nwas in a hole in the ground where they kept like potatoes and onions over the winter so it\nshouldn\u2019t go rotten, you know, they didn\u2019t have fridges in those days yet, so that\u2019s where she sat\nwith her mother, day after day after day. And unfortunately she contracted a --",
        "Q: Tuberculosis?",
        "A: Tuberculosis, yes. It started with like emphysema, and you know, they didn\u2019t have antibiotics\nand the conditions were horrible and so forth. And then she developed TB and she passed away.\nIf she would not have contracted TB, she would probably survived.",
        "Q: And your grandmother?",
        "A: And unfortunately when she died in \u201942, the Christian lady just chased my grandmother out,\nshe said, I don\u2019t want to keep this old lady, out. And she ended up in one of the concentration\ncamps, and you know the end of it 1s, you know, death.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Um --",
        "Q: Boryslaw is near what big city? Is it --",
        "A: It\u2019s near Lvov.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, okay.",
        "A: Drohobycz. In that vicinity.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s called DoyIni slonsk.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, okay.",
        "A: And apparently there was a big Jewish commun -- I mean, I don\u2019t know how big, but it was a\nr -- arelatively large Jewish community there. And Boryslaw was known for having oil -- oil.\nSo, you know, they were digging for oil and they found oil in Boryslaw, so they had, you know,\nthose --",
        "Q: Derricks?",
        "A: Yes, right there, right.",
        "Q: So now it\u2019s the end of the war and your father comes to get you.",
        "A: Yeah. What my father said, that during the time of the war, when he managed to escape each\ntime there was an aksia --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and one time he was even caught and he ran away from -- managed to escape the camp. He\nused to come periodically to visit me at that village, but I was not supposed to know that he was\nmy father and they gave him a nickname like Chapchuss. You know, whatever, that means\nnothing. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s like a blabber word, whatever. So whenever they said oh,\nChapchuss is coming to see you. Because in case, if one of the neighbors or Germans would\ncome in, I may say, aw, Marek Wein -- whatever. In order not to have that, he was called\nChapchuss. So, that was the name.",
        "Q: What was your new name during the war?",
        "A: Oh, my name was Anna Theresa Beitsko.",
        "Q: And that was the name of the family?",
        "A: And apparently that was their name, yes. I was also baptized, by the way. I was taken to\nchurch as a baby and baptized. So it shows you, I must have been a couple months old, you\nknow. I don\u2019t know, four or five, something like that. I was baptized and I was their child. Now,\nafter the war, when the war ended, they maybe thought that nobody will survive, cause my mom\ndied, grandma was taken into a concentration camp. They thought my father, who knows, he\nprobably won\u2019t survive either. But he did, and so immediately after the war, a law came out in\nPoland that if there is a parent and there is a child that survived, they have to be united. So that\u2019s\nwhat happened. He came and -- and me -- remarried immediately after the war and came to claim\nme. From what he said, they didn\u2019t want to give me up, cause they already raised me and I was\nthree and a half, and they ran away, he claimed with me, and they hid someplace. But eventually,\nyou know, the police -- the Polish police, which was, I think, called Enkavide and the Russian\npolice too, together came and they said you -- that\u2019s it, you must return the child. He is the\nrightful father and, you know. And that\u2019s it. And I remember the journey on a truck, in the back\nof a truck, we were sitting on a truck and my father bought me this huge bear, which wasn't so\nhuge, but it -- in my eyes it was huge and it made moo each time you turned it, and I was\npetrified. I was so scared of that bear. On the other hand I also got a doll, you know, and that\u2019s it.\nAnd then we rode on the track to a city called Lignice and we settled there for awhile. There\nwere lots of Russians. I de -- remember, because we lived there already for almost a year, or\nmaybe even a year and a half. So now I started having memories of that place. My father opened\na shop, like a deli place and --",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit who your stepmother was.",
        "A: My step-mom is also a survivor. Her name was Clara Bardah from Chelm. She was one of six\nchildren. They were five sisters and one brother, and her parents both, Sela -- and I forgot the\ngrandfather\u2019s name.",
        "Q: What was her last name? Her mai --",
        "A: Bardah.",
        "Q: So her --",
        "A: Her -- her --",
        "Q: -- maiden name?",
        "A: -- I -- Morgenstern. Her maiden name -- grandmothers -- my step-grandmother, her name was\nTela Morgenstern, from Chelm, but then she married, I think his name was Wolfe. This -- her\nhusband\u2019s name, last name was Wolfe, but the first name I don\u2019t remember calling him grandpa,\nbut not by the first name.",
        "Q: So your stepmother\u2019s maiden name was Wolfe? Her father\u2019s name?",
        "A: Yeah, yes, yes.",
        "Q: And from Boryslaw also?",
        "A: From Drohobycz.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Which was a relatively [indecipherable] she was not from Boryslaw.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: From Drohobycz.",
        "Q: Okay. And now you\u2019re in this new town with her -- with them --",
        "A: With -- with them --",
        "Q: -- the three of you.",
        "A: Three of us, correct. And I remember our -- they rented an apartment, a big apartment\nbecause my step-mom survived, and her sisters survived, five sisters.",
        "Q: Had she been in a camp, your stepmother?",
        "A: No, no, my step-mom, they all managed to get false papers that they are Christians. They all\nhad, except one sister, all had blue eyes. They tied -- you know, they color their hair blonde and\nthey resemble the Irish race, let\u2019s put it that way, yeah. This was arranged by one -- from what I\nlearned, what they told me, by one Christian man who worked in the government, who fell in\nlove with one of the sisters. And they were very pretty, that\u2019s true, they were beautiful women.\nThree of them were really gorgeous cause I remember them when they, you know, moved to\nIsrael and so forth, so they were very attractive at that time, too. So I can imagine when they\nwere young, they were probably very attractive. And he managed to arrange for all the five of th\n-- four of them to be -- the fifth one could not, because the fifth one was beautiful, but dark hair,\nbrown eyes. You know, she did not look like an --",
        "Q: Ar-Aryan.",
        "A: Aryan, yes. Like the Aryan race, whatever. So with her was a different story. So -- but they\nworked in a lot of German families as housekeepers.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: And she used to tell us -- she used to tell me, my stepmother it was nerve-wracking,\npretending what you are not and acting what you are not and -- and -- you know, and -- so that\u2019s\nhow they survived. Now, my grandfather, my step-grandfather, who in Poland, interesting was --\nowned farmland. Not that he himself farmed it, but he was a farmer, basically, and that was a\nlittle bit unusual for Jews at that time to owe -- own land and be a farmer. But he did, he had a\nlot of land and you know, they grew potatoes and -- and whatever farmers did grow in those days\nand he had people who worked on the land. But with hi -- he was very religious. He used to pray\nthree times a day with the Tefillin and all that. And during the war it was very difficult to hide\nthem. So -- but they survived. They said that in the apartment they used to rip off the floor and\nthere was like a sub-floor. And whenever there was an aksia coming, you know, that the\nGermans are coming to search for Jews, they used to hide them in there, they used to lay flat,\nboard it again, put that carpet on, you know, and they had to lie there quietly, not a peep out of\ntheir mouth til the period of the aksia, you know, when -- then at night maybe they lift it up so\nthey could go to the bathroom or whatever. So that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s basically how they\nsurvived. Now, her brother was drafted into the army and sent to the Russian border and he\nperished there.",
        "Q: So now the three of you, as we said, are 1n this [indecipherable]",
        "A: In -- in Lignice.",
        "Q: And -- and what are your first memories of that?",
        "A: Well, the fact that my father opened a store, I remember, and I remember Russian soldiers\ncoming in. And in fact I remember there was a toilet and the Russian opened the door. They\ndidn\u2019t know what that looked, looked like a sink and they started washing themselves in that\ntoilet. I remember that. I remember even seeing the Russian soldier and I asked my father how\ncome they don\u2019t have shoes on. Some of them came, and that was after the war, they had no\nshoes. They had their feet wrapped with cloth and with, like blankets and tied with a rope and I\nlooked at that, it looked horrible to me because it looked like, you know, something in outer spa\n-- not normal. Not normal for a child because I already had shoes on and my father had shoes on\nand here are coming those poor soldiers, you know, and they looked dreadful. I remember that. I\nalso remember not a very pleasant episode in that apartment that we stayed. And apparently there\nwas a hospital not far from there. One night I remember screaming and yelling in Polish,\nratumko, and ratumko means save us, save us, save us. Apparently some Russian soldiers, drunk\nsoldiers came into the apartment and started beating on the door. And I remember waking up and\nopening the door and seeing blood on the door. And I was rushed in very quickly by my step-\nmom, quickly into the room and I don\u2019t know, I think I hid under the bed from fear or what have\nyou. And that\u2019s it, that\u2019s what I remember.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: -- member having a housekeeper in -- in Lignice. She was German, they hired her. And her\nname was Gertruda. Gertrude.",
        "Q: So your father and stepmother had really nothing against the Germans, as such, they hired this\nGerman woman.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. My father felt well, now you as a German -- that\u2019s what he said, I said, why did\n-- at one point, you know, when I was older, I questioned that and he said well, that was my\nrevenge. Now she\u2019s gonna work for us. That was his interpretation, or his revenge. She was\ngoing to be the housekeeper and she was going to work for us. And I remember her in the\nkitchen doing the noodles, you know, the old kind where you roll -- made the dough, you rolled\nit out, and I was watching how she was cutting it into strips. What else? You know, I --\napparently she must have taken care of me. I don\u2019t remember much of a relationship with her.",
        "Q: But wi -- talking about relationships, what was your relationship with your stepmother? What\ndid you call her, first of all?",
        "A: Well, I called her Mama.",
        "Q: Yeah, and --",
        "A: She was -- you know, I was told that she is my mother. Now, I must have gone through some\ntraumatic experience because I called her Mama, but I apparently didn\u2019t attach myself to her yet\nas a mama. So I don\u2019t remember too much as -- you know, of -- of -- kind of a n -- nurturing time\nwith her. This I don\u2019t remember, really. There wasn\u2019t such a nurturing time. Maybe Gertrude\nwas supposed to fill 1t in, but she -- you know, she didn\u2019t. So, you know, I -- I\u2019m sure that my\nphysical taking care was taken care of, you know, making sure that I was fed and making sure\nthat I was dressed and combed and bathed or whatever it is, but I really don\u2019t remember sitting\nand -- you know, and -- and listening to a story or playing some games. Stuff like that I don\u2019t\nremember.",
        "Q: What kind of neighborhood did you and your family live in after the war? Was it a Jewish\nneighborhood, were there many Jews there?",
        "A: I was -- in Lignice I was sent to a kindergarten, a Jewish kindergarten --",
        "Q: So there were Jews that came back --",
        "A: That came back and apparently settled there because en -- there was a kindergarten there,\napparently, because I went to that kindergarten. In fact, I have a little picture of us being on the\nstage and performing something for Hanukkah. You know, like a song or something, which I\nhave it, and so --",
        "Q: Do you remember -- again, you were very young, any experiences in those early years after\nthe war, of any anti-Semitism?",
        "A: Yes, later on.",
        "Q: Later on, okay.",
        "A: Later on, yes, when we moved from Lignice to another city called Swidnica.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019ll talk about that, let\u2019s finish --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- with Lignice.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you went to school, and you had Jewish friends.",
        "A: And -- and apparently I had some Jewish friends, which I really don\u2019t remember much.\nCourse, I don\u2019t know, it was -- you know --",
        "Q: You were still very young.",
        "A: -- young, and I don\u2019t know whether parents invited kids over like we do today.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I doubt it very much, and those parents that survived after the war, you know, life wasn\u2019t easy\nfor them, so who knows how much patience they had to take somebody else in the house an-and\nbe, you know, attentive to them and play with them, or whatever. I know I di -- I had a lot of\ntoys. They bought me a lot of toys after the war.",
        "Q: Did you have any contact, do you know, with that couple that raised you the first three years?",
        "A: No, no, because -- no, because I was told that she is my real mom, my step-mom was my\nmother. You see, I was in -- it was inculcated into my brain that this is your mother and I am\nyour father. This is your mother. Nothing about the past, that I was raised by a period of my life\nwith a Christian family or that I had a birth mom. No, that was -- that was discovered much later.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: When I was in, oh I would say 14 - 15. I was suspicious already that something is not right,\nbut that was years after.",
        "Q: Yeah, right, later. Did you call the woman who hid you Mama, do you know?",
        "A: I have no -- possibly.",
        "Q: Probably --",
        "A: Probably, yes.",
        "Q: Probably, yeah. So now you\u2019re asked to call another person Mama.",
        "A: Mama, yes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. So you were there for -- in Lignice for a year.",
        "A: I think it may be a year and a half --",
        "Q: And you went to school.",
        "A: -- two, could be. Maybe even two years, close to two years.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: And then we moved, and I went there to the -- to the kindergarten.",
        "Q: Right. But your father was not religious --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- so you didn\u2019t have any -- did you observe -- again, you were so young -- any holidays, or\nShabbat, or nothing?",
        "A: No, not that I remember.",
        "Q: Was your fath -- do -- do you know if your father was Zionist, a Zionist?",
        "A: No. No, he was not.",
        "Q: He was not, okay.",
        "A: No. He was a Polish pat-patriot. He was very into -- he was a Polish patriot. He loved Poland.\nHe had opportunity to leave.",
        "Q: Well that was going to be my next question.",
        "A: Yeah, but he did not. His cousin, his first cousin left in 1939 and came to Washington, and\nthat\u2019s how we ended up in Washington, through the first cousin. But my father, no, he didn't\nwant to leave Poland.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And he didn\u2019t want to leave his parents, you know, your commitment to the family, so forth.\nAnd maybe also my father was not that adventurous to move, you know, from different\nlanguages, you have to start all over. He just didn\u2019t -- he wasn\u2019t willing to do that.",
        "Q: Now why did they move to a new -- another city? Why did you leave Lignice?",
        "A: I think because -- my feeling -- he never said that, but that was my feeling, since he lived with\nthe sisters and their husbands and my mother with a big family, and I don\u2019t know whether he was\nplanning to advance himself in the business area, whatever. He decided he\u2019s moving away. So he\nmoved to Swidnica.",
        "Q: And where was that in relation to Lignice?",
        "A: Not that far. Closer to Wroclaw, which is another city in Poland. Not that far, in that vicinity,\nI don\u2019t know, maybe half a day drive or something like that. And ha -- why did he do that I don\u2019t\nknow, but I know one thing. Where -- in Swidnica he opened immediately a business with a\nman, a Christian man who -- whose specialty was he -- to manufacture candies, all kinds of\ncandies. And so they [indecipherable] together and they opened a factory that produced\nchocolates and candy varieties, all kinds of varieties of sweets and a store in front that sold the\nproducts that they manufactured. And that\u2019s what my father did, and this I remember very well,\nbecause I must have been close to seven years old already, six and a half. I remember coming to\nthe store. I remember my father arranging all those gorgeous, beautiful candy boxes with -- with\nribbons and what have you, chocolates and all kinds of candies, hard candies, soft candies,\nchocolates, small chocolates, you know. All kinds of sweets and delicatessen, you know, all\nkinds of specialties. And it went very well, because after the war people were extremely hungry\nand they craved all those things that they didn\u2019t have. So he did very well in that respect and we\nwere in Poland, in Swidnica until 1951.",
        "Q: What kind of neighborhood did you live in in -- in Swidnica?",
        "A: In Swidnica I lived, not necessarily in a Jewish neighborhood, no. I also went to school there,\nfirst grade and second grade.",
        "Q: Was this a public school, or --",
        "A: Public school.",
        "Q: So you were with child --",
        "A: And I was the only Jewish kid in the whole school.",
        "Q: In the whole school?",
        "A: The whole school.",
        "Q: So what was that like for you?",
        "A: Terrible.",
        "Q: Can you relate some of the --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- experiences that you had?",
        "A: I tell you it was terrible because I had a very good friend, her name was Krisha and she was\nChristian. And she used to ask me, are you Jewish? I said no, I\u2019m Christian. And I used to go\nwith her to church after school. I re -- that was in first grade.",
        "Q: Now, you said that because you thought you were Christian, or you thought it would be safe\nto --",
        "A: Don\u2019t forget --",
        "Q: -- to say --",
        "A: Don\u2019t forget that the three and a half or four years of my life --",
        "Q: Right, that\u2019s what I meant.",
        "A: -- I was brought up as a Christian.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I believed in it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And it was --",
        "Q: So at that point you still felt you were a Christian?",
        "A: I -- yes. It was so inculcucated into me that no matter what they said, I -- apparently there was\nsome ritual that I was taught as a little kid, you know, that I had to hold my hands together and\nsay a prayer before I go to sleep, and these things and that stayed with me for a pretty long time.\nSo I was -- I\u2019m the only Jewish kid in -- in the whole school and the teachers knew about it, that\nI\u2019m Jewish, you know, I\u2019m not a Christian. But I wouldn\u2019t accept that. I wanted to be like all the\nrest of the kids in school, in the classroom. And I remember a priest -- we -- we had in Poland at\nthat time, religious lessons in -- in -- in -- in school. And I remember the priest used to come and\nhe used to say, Anita, up and leave the class. And I used to burst out in tears, because this was a\nreligious --",
        "Q: Instruction?",
        "A: -- instruction, and I -- and I just wanted to participate like everybody else. And I started\ncrying and he said, okay, stay. So I stayed. I remember that. And --",
        "Q: Did you have any negative experiences? Anti-Semitic expressions to you?",
        "A: Well, the only anti-Semitic expressions is what -- with this questioning if you are -- am |\nJewish? Are you Jewish, or are you Christian? And I used to say no, I am Christian.",
        "Q: But nothing -- but nothing negative, that\u2019s what I meant.",
        "A: No, not negative, you know, pointing to me that I\u2019m a Jew or something like that, no, no.\nWhat I do remember is at the end of, I think it\u2019s the second grade, everybody got -- every child\ngot a book -- that\u2019s my husband -- every child got a book as a gift. I got the most smallest, little,\ntiny book. Everybody got nice, big books as a gift at the end of the year and I just got a tiny little\none.",
        "Q: Because the books they got were Christian books?",
        "A: They were Polish books, all kinds of stories.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: No, not necessarily religious books, no, no, no. But as a gift, as a token to the student, and I\ngot a little one. And of course I came home and I carried on and so my father and my step-mom\nwent to school and they said, how come you gave her such a little book and all the other kids got\nbig ones, she got just a little one, you know. And I don\u2019t know if that was an indication of\nwhatever. I have no clue. This is what I remember. And other than that --",
        "Q: But you felt confident going out on the street, that you would -- your parents thought it would\nbe -- you were safe to go out on the street?",
        "A: Not so confident, I mean, from school I walked with that girl, Krisha. And we went to church\nafter school.",
        "Q: Oh, you did go to church?",
        "A: Yes, after school we went to church and after that I went home. So sometimes she used to\ncome to me. I had a feeling that, you know, she used to come and play but not as often as I\nwanted her to come, so maybe the parents were not so happy that she associates with a Jewish\nkid or whatever, I don\u2019t know. They probably did know that I\u2019m not Christian, even though I\nkeep on saying that I was [indecipherable]",
        "Q: What was -- and what was the Russian presence in your town at that time?",
        "A: The Russian presence I remember only in Lignice, not in Swidnica.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: In Swidnica I don\u2019t remember the Russian presence -- presence at all, not at all. But what\nhappened after 1951 when we -- when we left Poland and immigrated to Israel is that the\nRussians were coming into Poland apparently and chopping down all the private initiatives.",
        "Q: Okay, why did your -- y-y say you stayed there til 51.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Why did your father and stepmother make the decision to leave?",
        "A: The decision they made to leave was because her sisters started immigrating to Israel. No,\nsorry, no, no, no, no, they came after us, no. The reason -- you know, it\u2019s funny because now I\nremember that once my stepmother said that one of the reasons was because I was so engrossed\ninto Catholicism as a kid. She said that\u2019s one of the reasons -- she -- she said that eventually I'll\nend up marrying out of faith and that\u2019s it. So she said, now the Russians are already in Poland,\nthey\u2019re coming in, they\u2019re shutting the private initiatives, no more businesses. You will have to\nclose your business, your private business. Here is one reason and the other reason is that the\nkids will grow up -- because in the meantime I had a half sister that was born.",
        "Q: When was she born?",
        "A: 48 or \u201949.",
        "Q: And her name?",
        "A: Her name was Henrika. Henrika, but her Hebrew name is Balia. Okay. And I think basically\nthat -- that\u2019s what drove them to come to Israel. Now, whether my father was a Zionist, I\u2019m\ntelling you the truth, nope. And he knew it\u2019s going to be hardship -- oh, there\u2019s something flying\nhere -- so --",
        "Q: Was your stepmother a Zionist?",
        "A: More than my father.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did -- did you want to wear a crucifix, a cross?",
        "A: Yeah, yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember ask -- asking your folks if you could?",
        "A: They were not too happy, but I wore it.",
        "Q: Oh, you did wear it?",
        "A: I wore it with Mary Magdalena. Not the crucifix, but Mary with the baby. That\u2019s what I had\non my -- on my neck, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. They let you do that?",
        "A: They let me, yes. And then after awhile they started not letting me. I remember that, it was a\nbig fight all ways. I always used to pin next to my bed, which had like, in those days had wooden\nbars. I used to pin Jesus, picture of Jesus and Mary Magdalena with her hands this way, that way,\nyou know. Yeah.",
        "Q: So what did -- before you left for Israel, what did Israel mean to you? Did you have any idea\nwhat it was, where it was?",
        "A: Yeah, I -- my father used to say a barren land, nothing to eat, desert, it\u2019s gonna be rough,\nrough times. You know, he pictured it very bleak.",
        "Q: But was willing to go.",
        "A: But went yeah, yeah. I think he actually wanted to come to United States, that was his dream,\nto come to America, but it did not materialize for him because -- I tell you the episode why. He\ncould have come the United States immediately after the war, because his cousin, his first cousin\nwho lived in Vienna, and he managed to escape in \u00b039, that\u2019s what I was told, and came directly\nto Washington, through family that arranged this for him, because in those days you just couldn\u2019t\ncome.",
        "Q: You needed a sponsor.",
        "A: You needed a sponsor and it had to be a quota too. So I don\u2019t know how, whether he had a\nquota, or maybe somebody really sponsored him with big chunk of money and said if something\nhappens, Jake Schutzman will [indecipherable] us, don\u2019t worry. So he arrived in \u201939 and\nimmediately after the war, there was a contact between my father and him. And my father started\nwith his business in wa -- in -- in Lignice and things were going well for him and he made good\nmoney and so forth. And he received a package from my cousin -- his -- his -- his cousin, which\nwas my second cousin, a package of clothing and he opened it up and he said, oh my God, what\na collection of some shmatas. What is he sending me, some shmatas? This is America, he says.\nThis is -- this is what life is in America? That\u2019s what -- I mean, here I have decent clothes, I -- I\nmean, it\u2019s a different life that I live than -- this is th -- you know, that was his impression for\nsome reason. And Jake Schutzman instead, sent him a letter and sent him papers to fill out at that\ntime and deposit it in the American embassy. He did that, but much later. I don\u2019t know, some\nyears went by, maybe three, four years went by by the time you went and deposited those papers\nin the American embassy. And -- and then he couldn\u2019t, in \u00b051, immigrate to United States\nbecause Poland -- Poland had a quota of so many people America would accept from Poland.\nAnd then you had to have a sponsor. So sponsor was Jake, but his financial situation at the\nbeginning, in \u201951 wasn\u2019t great. He wasn\u2019t that long in United States in order to sponsor, and so\nthe other option was only going to Israel.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: SO --",
        "Q: When did you leave -- when did you leave for Israel?",
        "A: 1951, and I think it was in April. We | -- we left by boat and we arrived in Haifa and I was not\nquite 10, so you know, I remember the trip, which was horrible, I was so sick. The ha --",
        "Q: What boat do y -- do you remember the boat\u2019s name?",
        "A: Megbah. Yes, the boat was called Megbah. I remember I was sick the whole week from Italy,\nbecause from Poland to Italy we rode a train. And from Italy we took a boat. And I remember\nthey dressed me, and I\u2019m not exaggerating, with eight or nine dresses, one on top of the other,\nand on -- because taking stuff from Poland, you couldn\u2019t take everything you wanted to, they\nrationed you. You couldn\u2019t take your wealth that you have accumulated, so you had to be very\nclever, how do you maneuver to get stuff out that, you know, is yours, that you earned it, you\nknow, over the years. So I remember arriving 1n Israel --",
        "Q: We-Were you very unhappy about leaving Poland?",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t remember that. No, I don\u2019t think I was unhappy. The idea of -- of riding a\ntrain and changing and you know, apparently maybe appealed to me. And there were also\npictures from United Jewish Appeal, I remember. You know, they were asking for donations and\nwe used to get those cards, and I used to look at the cards and they looked very fascinating, very\nnice, so from what my father said, barren land, and desert and nothing, and here are cards that\nshow farmers working, orange trees with oranges, lemons, it -- you know, it was -- it was\nappealing to a youngster.",
        "Q: So now you land in Haifa.",
        "A: Yeah, land in Haifa, sweating like anything.",
        "Q: Do you remember what your parents\u2019 reaction was when the boat --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- landed and they got on ground?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes --",
        "Q: Israeli ground.",
        "A: -- right. My fa -- my father was dressed in a suit with a hat with a kapeloush. My mother was\ndressed to perfection. She had a suit on, and a hat, and she had shoes made by a shoemaker in\nPoland. You know in those days everything was custom made. You didn\u2019t go to a shop lu -- like\nwe go here to the mall. She had on her, I\u2019Il never forget that, a fox. You know fox?",
        "Q: Right, wa --",
        "A: -- with the -- ye-yeah --",
        "Q: -- with the head and the --",
        "A: -- a Cire --",
        "Q: -- with the head and the tail.",
        "A: Yeah, with the tail, silver fox, black and silver, very pretty, I remember that. And the first\nthing, they put us in a big room and they started taking fleet it\u2019s called like a fleet, where they\ndisinfect you.",
        "Q: They sprayed you.",
        "A: Sprayed us. And my father, he got so uptight and nervous and he started screaming, what do\nyou think I\u2019m coming from, the jungle? What are you fleeting me? You know, and what do you\nthink we are, barbarians? And you know, it didn\u2019t help much, everybody, no matter where you\ncame from, whether you came from Yemen or Irag or Tunisia or Sahara or Poland or Germany,\nfleet everybody was fleeted. And then --",
        "Q: Let -- let\u2019s back up a little bit.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: Were the other people on the boat coming over, were they Polish Jews coming to Israel?",
        "A: Yes, yes, Polish Jews.",
        "Q: And di --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Were there many children on that boat?",
        "A: This, to be honest with you, I don\u2019t remember because I was so sick, seasick.",
        "Q: Oh, what -- yeah, right, yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think there were that many kids there, no.",
        "Q: So it isn\u2019t that you talked with other children?",
        "A: No --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- no, no.",
        "Q: What language were you speaking?",
        "A: Polish.",
        "Q: Only? That\u2019s all you knew?",
        "A: That\u2019s all I si -- knew, right.",
        "Q: And your parents spoke to you in Polish, okay.",
        "A: Polish, yeah, they spoke Polish.",
        "Q: So now you landed in Israel and you only know Polish.",
        "A: And I 0 -- only know Polish, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Okay, but you got sprayed.",
        "A: And I -- we got all sprayed and we were put into a big tent because they didn\u2019t have enough\nhousing in \u201951 to accommodate the -- the Altyah, you know, the incoming Jews. And in that tent,\nI remember that, there was no floor, 1t was just earth.",
        "Q: Wa -- where was this in --",
        "A: Hatfa.",
        "Q: You were still in Haifa?",
        "A: In Haifa, yes, Haifa. And we received like a bed, everybody got a bed, a folding bed, like\narmy bed with a blanket, and I think a pillow. And my father also brought food, by the way from\nPoland. I remember four jars, red jars, like milk jars, big ones, with schmaltz. Also dried\nmushrooms on a string, couple strings of that because there was no -- because we came at a time\nthat it was called senna, there was no food. Food was rationed in Israel at that time. And also\nsausages. But the kind that are dried, 1 -- where you don\u2019t have to refrigerate also. Strings of\nsausages. And I remember Daddy took a hammer and a nail from someplace and he hammered it\nto the pole of the tent and hung the sausages and the mushrooms and that the containers were put\naside. In that tent there were -- we were there, another Romanian family from Romania, which\nwe could not communicate and two other families from Yemen, which we could not\ncommunicate. The Yemenite Jews that came, they were dressed entirely different than those\nfrom Europe. And evening c-came, suppertime, they all sat on the floor and they put this big tray\nand they started eating with their hands. And my father and my step-mom, when they saw that,\nthey got up and they went real close to look and they spoke to each other in Polish and they\ncalled me to see. Look, look, take a look, look how they eat. I haven\u2019t seen anything like it. You\nsit on the ground and you eat with your hands. Where am I, he said. I came to like nomad lands.\nThis -- what is this, you know? He maybe envisioned in his head that it\u2019s going to be more\nEuropean but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s a mixture of Jews from all over the world. You know, and that was\nvery hard for him. We stayed there five days.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with Anita Etzyon. This is tape two, side A, and we were talking about your staying in\nthe tent and watching the family eat and the -- your father\u2019s response. The family from Yemen.",
        "A: Ah, right, yes. It was a cultural shock, I would say, to my father and my step-mom. They had\nnot seen it. There were no televisions yet in those days. Maybe if there would be, you know, they\nwould have seen different cultures, how people eat and how people interact, but it was very\nstrange for them.",
        "Q: Were there partitions in the tent?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So it was one open area?",
        "A: One open area, yes.",
        "Q: So it was you and your parents and your sister --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- with these other two families.",
        "A: With the other three families.",
        "Q: O-Other three families.",
        "A: There were four families in a tent.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then we stayed there a few days and my step-mom had a cousin in Israel by the name\nYakov or Kuba Morgenstern. And he lived in a village called -- at that time it was called Sidney\nAli, which -- which is an Arabic name and Arabs apparently lived there. Later on it became Nofti\nYam, was named Nof Yam. But I remember it as Sidney Ali. And he took us from -- from Haifa,\nfrom that absorption camp to the home that he lived, and he lived in a Arab home, which was left\nby the Arabs that left the area. It was an Arab home and we received a room downstairs and his\napartment was upstairs. And we lived there, I think two or three months.",
        "Q: Were you starting to pick up Hebrew?",
        "A: Very little, even though there was some kind of a school there, and it was like one room\nschool and there were like three or four [indecipherable]. This was first grade, this was second\ngrade, this was third grade and fourth grade. So we were like, you know, different ages in one\nroom, basically.",
        "Q: When you -- let\u2019s back up to the absorption center, were there other Polish families there that\nyou could speak to?",
        "A: There must -- there probably were, but I was not in contact with, I was with my family most\nof the day.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And -- and I think my father left couple times just to see what he can do in Israel, what -- you\nknow, what kind of a job can he get, what can he do? So he was trying to reach, apparently,\nsome contacts with people and -- and that\u2019s how my stepmother contacted this cousin of hers and\nthat\u2019s how we managed -- you know, he managed to kind of take us out from the absorption. And\nthen we stayed with him two or three months, not that long. And th-then we had to move to\nanother -- it\u2019s called in Hebrew Ma\u2019barah, which is another absorption built for Olim\nChadashim, which are the newcomers. And we lived there for almost two years.",
        "Q: What -- where was that?",
        "A: It was ca -- it was called Ma\u2019barot gelee. It was in Herzliya on the way to Tel Aviv on the\nmain highway at that time, which was not quite a highway, it was like a dirt road in a sense, but\nthat\u2019s how it was. And we lived there for two years. It was one room, made out of tin with a --\nwith a base that was made out of concrete. The walls were made out of tin. And when it rained it\nwas like playing orchestra on top of your roof. We stayed there for two years. My father also\nbrought from Poland, I must say, furniture. My father brought a whole lift. Where was I?",
        "Q: You were -- yo-you had moved to the new --",
        "A: Yeah, Ma\u2019barot gelee --",
        "Q: Ma\u2019barah.",
        "A: Ma\u2019 barah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And my father emi -- you know, he was at that time very depressed, I must say, very\ndepressed. Even in Boryslaw, which was not a very wealthy Jewish community there, he never\nlived in such conditions, where you live in one little room with -- you know, made out of tin --\npach, in Hebrew, really. And you know, and there were winds and rain and it was just miserable.\nBut, you know, as a kid, no matter where you stuck a kid, it\u2019s okay. You know, children are busy\ndoing their stuff, running around, you meet children, you get -- start playing. Even if I wasn\u2019t\nable to communicate, I still remember having couple friends there, because we -- we were all\nolim, we were all newcomers.",
        "Q: Were there ones from Poland?",
        "A: No --",
        "Q: Okay, so --",
        "A: -- no, no, no.",
        "Q: -- so you were picking up Hebrew ne --",
        "A: Slowly, yes. I was picking up slowly Hebrew.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But not to a degree that I was able to converse yet, or having a whole conversation.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But I was picking it up. And --",
        "Q: Did you go to school?",
        "A: Yes, I went to school there, right. Again, it was a very similar situation in -- and we had like\nfew of those barracks or whatever, those one rooms that were -- in one room you could have two\ngrades, or three grades and one teacher would, you know, teach us. My father brought furniture\nfrom Poland, a lift. He was able to ship a lift. We had it for a long time, I remember, a whole\nbedroom set and a whole living room set with dining table and four chairs. Clothing, and also\nmoney, he was able to bring money and wa --",
        "Q: So this arrived in the port of Haifa?",
        "A: N -- e -- that arrived in the port of Haifa eventually. I don\u2019t think it arrived with us, because\nthen it was transported -- this arrived a little bit later and it was transported to the absorption\nMa\u2019barot gelee, where we lived for two years. And I remember my father build another room by\nhimself to house this lift, cause there were a couple big boxes that he built in Poland, you know\nto hou -- to put the furniture in. He did that. My stepmother was very resource -- resourceful in\nthat respect. She remembered from home because her father owned land and he was a farmer, so\nwhat she did, she -- my father made her a big fence around that area that we lived. They fenced a\npiece of property, he could have done that, and she started a little farm of her own, with chickens\nand -- and ducks and -- and boy I remember and -- and turkeys, we had, and I remember how she\nused to hatch them, take those eggs and -- and put them in a basket and put a hen that was ready\nto sit on the eggs and -- and inc -- then the eggs incubated and then we had more chickens. And I\nwas in charge of the ducks, I remember. And since our -- our serif, that\u2019s what it was, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nthat ha -- little hat, was at the end and -- and at the end was a orange grove, a big orange grove.\nSo I used to go with the ducks and -- and whatever was there, I had a little stick, you know, like\na shepherd girl. Used to take -- there were four of them, they were pretty big, they are not the\nlittle ducks, they are those -- they look like swans in a sense, but they were --",
        "Q: Geese? Were they geese?",
        "A: Geese, geese. Four of them. They were very aggressive, that\u2019s what I remember. Anybody\nwho came by they would attack, like a dog, you know, it\u2019s interesting. So I used to take those\ngeese to the orange orchard and they used to pasture there. There was like a big pipe that they\nused to water those trees. And water used to drip in a little -- and it formed like a little basin or\nsomething and those geese used to go and drink and eat the grass around and so forth. And I\nloved it, I remember that, that was just wonderful. And so you know, living in Ma\u2019barah for me\nwasn\u2019t difficult at all, I enjoyed it. I remember sh -- my mother planted corn and potatoes and I\nremember there was a mole who used to come and eat the potatoes and we were fighting that\nmole, you know, with -- with the hoes and water into this -- into their grooves that they made\nunderground, what have you. So for me I -- I enjoyed it. I -- I -- it didn\u2019t bother me at all living\nin a -- in hut.",
        "Q: Did you miss Poland?",
        "A: No, no. I didn\u2019t miss Poland, not at all. I remember taking the dishes -- for instance, you\ncouldn\u2019t wash dishes in this one hut, cause even though my father made a kitchen, but it was\nvery difficult to wash the dishes, so I used to take like a basket or -- or a big pail with the dirty\ndishes and they built like a long --",
        "Q: Trough? A trough?",
        "A: A trough with faucets and everybody used to come and polish and wash their dishes there.\nAnother thing was, at the beginning when we moved into the -- Ma\u2019barah, you didn\u2019t have your\nprivate shower, so we all had to shower in a public shower that they built, you know, and they\ndidn't make it compartmentalized separate. They made -- you know, they put those showers and\neverybody in, you know, and my father and my mother they just -- they couldn\u2019t. So this -- first\nthing my father did after he built that room was immediately to put up a shower so he doesn\u2019t\nhave to go and shower. He was in that -- very handy. I must say he was very handy to put up a\nroom to house his furniture, to build the fence, to build a chicken coop for the chickens. So, you\nknow, make a little kitchen for my mom so she can cook and make a shower for us. Now, the\nbathroom had to be a public bathroom and so, you know, we used this public bathroom, which\nwasn\u2019t a bathroom like we are used to it, it was a hole. A huge hole in the ground and you know,\nthere were like four compartments, but there was a wall that separated those four, so thank God\nfor that. And I remember petrified going to the bathroom. Why? Because when I looked into the\nhole, I said oh my God, if I fall in there -- and I was small, you know, I wasn\u2019t a big kid or\nsomething. My God, if I fall into this hole. That was very, very scary. That was something that I\nremember til today, the fear of going to the bathroom, but you had to. You didn\u2019t have another\nfacility. So we lived there two years and in the meantime they managed to buy an apartment,\nwhich was in the process of being built, and it took almost, I don\u2019t know, a year or so to finish it,\nso that\u2019s why we stayed there almost two years. And then we moved to Herzliya, to a place\ncalled no -- a -- Noht Sarah, the dwellings of Sarah. It was a 40 -- 40 unit apartment, a long one,\na three story building.",
        "Q: At this time did you feel Israeli or Polish?",
        "A: No, I still felt Polish.",
        "Q: You still felt very Polish.",
        "A: Yes, very Polish.",
        "Q: Not -- not Israeli.",
        "A: Not Israeli.",
        "Q: But I imagine after two years your Hebrew was much [indecipherable]",
        "A: Was much better, right, and then I went ow -- enrolled -- they enrolled me in fifth grade\nelementary school. I was already -- by then I was 12 and I went into fifth grade. I was always a\nyear ahead of the others. When they were 11 in fifth grade, I was 12 in fifth grade. And maybe\nbecause of the lack of --",
        "Q: Language.",
        "A: -- language barrier and so forth, so you know, I couldn\u2019t keep up with the material. And by\nthen I already knew Hebrew and I was slowly acclimating myself. And luckily was that in\nHerzliya there were a few other kids that were not born sabras and that was a big thing in those\ndays, to be an Israeli. And here, I don\u2019t know if you heard or not, but the Israelis were not too\nhappy accepting the new immigrants and they called them, you know, in Hebrew they called\nthem subonim, which means soaps, like you -- you know, subonim. And they also wi -- didn\u2019t\naccept them, you know, they stuck together. And for me it was very important to penetrate that\nand become like one of them and not be this Polish immigrant.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about what did your pe -- did you know what happened to the Jews during World\nWar II and a -- and do you know what your -- or did your parents talk to you about it and what\nwere their reactions when they heard all the terrible things after the war was over. Obviously\nthey waited til you were older.",
        "A: Yes. Whether they talked much about it at that time -- they mentioned it from time to time,\nthat we are all survivors and so forth.",
        "Q: What did being a survivor mean to a young girl? Or wa-was that later on, when you were\nolder?",
        "A: To be honest with you not -- I wasn\u2019t very proud of it at that time in Israel, that I\u2019m a\nsurvivor, you know, because --",
        "Q: But why weren\u2019t you pr --",
        "A: -- because in school, sometimes even the teachers when they were teaching, they were saying\noh, those Jews, they went like sheep to slaughter. They did not resist, they did not fight. Because\nin Israel the young generation, the soldiers, the Haganah, the [indecipherable] all of them, they\nwere fighters, they fought. Now the Jews in Europe, there was a resistance in ghetto Warsaw we\nknow and -- and other places, but they felt that the Jews went like sheep to slaughter, and -- and\nwe were part of that -- you know, part of those Jews who somehow managed to survive, but you\nknow -- so these were -- | -- I -- in fact I remember one of my teachers also said that, that the\nJews went like sheep to slaughter and I came home and I said it to my parents. And they were\nvery upset and they went and they talked to the teacher how, you know, whatever. But that was\nthe -- that was the attitude of -- of the Israelis in those days, you know. We are the sabras, we are\nthe born Israelis and you know, proud an-and you know, and tall and strong and whatever. Free.",
        "Q: Did the -- did the children talk to you like that, or just the adults?",
        "A: No, some of the children.",

        "Q: Were they learning Hebrew?",
        "A: They were learning, but fa -- 1t was so difficult for them, because it\u2019s a Semitic language and -\n- and -- and they just couldn\u2019t, you know, so they continued speaking Polish and -- and my father\nwasn\u2019t very happy the first couple years living in Israel, so he didn\u2019t make the effort to acclimate\nhimself into the society. So they had their Polish friends, which they communicate only in\nPolish. And -- and the other thing was that also when you went shopping -- well you didn\u2019t have\nsupermarkets then, but we had grocery shops, so the grocer spoke Yiddish, or German or Polish\nor whatever, so --",
        "Q: Di-Di-Did your family know Yiddish at all?",
        "A: Yes, they did, but they did not speak it.",
        "Q: So you -- did you know Yiddish?",
        "A: No, no, because wa -- they did not speak Yiddish. But later on I picked up somehow by, I\ndon\u2019t know, I picked up the language, not that I\u2019m fluent, but maybe because through my\nlanguage, my mother-in-law spoke Yiddish and Russian and so --",
        "Q: But when you were younger you didn\u2019t [indecipherable |",

        "Q: Was Polish.",
        "A: Was Polish. And when I had friends coming in, that came over to visit, was only Polish. I\nused to say, why don\u2019t you speak Hebrew, they don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying, you know.\nIt did upset me, you know, but that was the reality, I couldn't change it.",

        "Q: And doing anything else? Did you do sports, did you --",
        "A: Well, within the school, you know the activities that we had.",
        "Q: And still no religious affiliations?",
        "A: No, not at all. Not at all. My parents turned 360 degrees away from religion, both of them.\nAnd they didn\u2019t really celebrate the holidays. Luckily they were in Israel, so I knew there was\nthis holiday, that holiday, you know, through school and so forth.",
        "Q: But nothing in the home.",
        "A: Nothing at home, no, nothing at home.",
        "Q: And so life went on in Herzliya.",
        "A: Right, life went on and then I went to the high school in -- in Herzliya as well and became\nquite -- you know, quite, involved in the social life of school and had a number of fu -- good\nfriends. And then, after --",
        "Q: A-At that point I assumed you felt Israeli, not Polish?",
        "A: Yes, I did.",
        "Q: It\u2019s high school.",
        "A: That -- it was high school already, right. But, was interesting when I spoke Hebrew. I have an\naccent, a Polish accent in the Hebrew language and my pronunciation, you know, the R, raiche,\nyou can hear raiche. The Israeli sabras, they don\u2019t have the raiche, they have the raiche. So you\ncould tell that this is not a sabra because her raiche is not raiche, it\u2019s raiche.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know. Other than that, you know, I was -- I felt fine. I felt like any other Israeli.",
        "Q: And then?",
        "A: And then I went to a school called Seminare aki Butsim. After two years of high school in\nIsrael, I transferred to Tel Aviv to study in --",
        "Q: With your family, or without your family?",
        "A: No, without my family. They lived -- we lived in Herzliya but I communicate -- I commuted\nto Tel Aviv, to Seminare, which -- which prepared you to be a teacher, and I was there for four\nyears, so it was a continuation. And the reason why I switched was because 1n those days, and I\nthink it\u2019s today the same story, if you finish high school, you go to the army. Now, if you stop\nhigh school after two years, which is the 10\" grade and you transfer to a Seminare and you finish\nthe two years of high school in the Seminare plus two years in the same Seminare tea --\nbecoming a teacher, then you are not -- your education is not interrupted and you don\u2019t go to the\narmy. Now, but when you finish the Seminare and you are not married, you go to the army. So\nhappened I met my husband in the last year of Seminare aki Butsim. And I\u2019ll never forget he said\nto me, okay -- I said, you know that at the end of the year I have to go to serve, to the army. He\nsaid [indecipherable] you\u2019ll serve in my army. And we got married and that --",
        "Q: How -- how did you meet your husband?",
        "A: I met my husband at a wedding that -- in the meantime my father got established in Israel and\nhe picked up a trade which I don\u2019t know whether he learned it in Israel or maybe he had some\nidea with another par -- par -- partner and he became a -- oh my God, listen -- hm -- plumber,\nwith another partner and Israel was -- at that time they were building Israel so he was doing all\nthe installations to the new homes in Herzliya and -- and so, you know, he did pretty well,\nworked very hard, you know, wasn\u2019t young any more. Took him at least five or eight years by\nthe time he managed to open a little business with this partner of his. And -- and you know, and\nwe lived in Herzliya and --",
        "Q: And your sister stayed -- stayed in Herzliya [indecipherable] younger --",
        "A: Ohy -- absolutely, the younger one, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: She is by eight years younger than me.",
        "Q: Yeah, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah, eight years, I think. Seven or eight years.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And yeah, she stayed in Herzliya and went to school and --",
        "Q: So you met -- you met your husband at a wedding.",
        "A: And my -- I -- at a wedding and it was a wedding of one of the builders that was marrying her\nson and my father was very insistent that I should go too to that wedding, and I didn't want to.\nBecause you have to understand that in Israel when you are 18, you are very self sufficient. You\ndon\u2019t go with your parents. And I said, I should go with you? And that makes sense. I don\u2019t want\nto go, I don\u2019t want to go. He said no, you should come, you should see a builder, he is a very\nwell-to-do man and a beautiful wedding and we\u2019re all invited and -- all right. So we wen -- I\nwent to the wedding with them and I wasn\u2019t very happy because I had to sit with them and it was\nboring, and interesting. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m going to back up now. When we came to Israel in 1951 there\nwas a family from Boryslaw that my father remembered. He was not 1n contact with this man,\nbut he knew that he immigrated to Israel. His name was Joseph Holzman. He immigrated to\nIsrael as a youngster when he was 17, before World War II. Left the family, his father, I think\ndied at a -- at the front fighting, I think, I don\u2019t know if it was the Pole [phone ringing] This man,\nJoseph Holzman, who was born in Boryslaw and my father knew him from Boryslaw, but there\nwas not really a contact between the two til my father arrived in Israel, and he said, I have to find\nthis man, I want to see what he does here so maybe he can guide me what to do in Israel. And so\nthis man Joseph Holzman, in Herzliya by the beach had a motel, a little motel and that was his\nbusiness. And so I remember I was -- we just -- you know, we just arrived in Israel and we were\nliving in the -- in that Sidney ali that I mentioned, which 1s close to where they lived and had\ntheir motel, so we went there one evening, and -- all of us, and you know, they spoke about\nwhatever. And that\u2019s it. And maybe he gave my father some advice and we left and that\u2019s it. And\nthere was never a contact any more. At the wedding his wife, Joseph\u2019s wife came to the\nwedding. He wasn\u2019t there because he stayed in the motel cause they had guests and he had to\nattend to the guests that they had. And -- but his wife was with her son at the wedding. And we\nwere ready to leave the wedding and go back home, it was around 11 o\u2019clock and we had to\ncatch the last bus from Tel Aviv, and so -- where the wedding took place. And Mrs. Holzman\nsaw my father and she remembered him, she said, hello Mr. Weingarten, how nice to see you,\nblah, blah, blah, and I\u2019m standing in the back. And she asks, and this is your daughter? And my\nfather said yes, and he introduced -- introduce yourself. So I introduced myself. She looked at\nme, grabbed me by the hand and she said, I have a very nice son, and I want you to meet him.\nAnd that was it, and the rest is history.",
        "Q: And -- and that\u2019s how you met your future husband?",
        "A: That\u2019s how I met my future husband and we started dating and that\u2019s it, and it ended up in\nmarriage.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: And your name is now Etzyon, and --",
        "A: Etzyon, correct.",
        "Q: -- and how did that happen that it was not Holzman?",
        "A: Because at that time it was very fashionable in Israel not to have a rooted Israeli name. Not\nHolzman, not Weingarten. Many, many families I remember at that time changed their names to\nHebrew names. And in fact, I went through that period too with my folks. I said, why don\u2019t you\nchange from Weingarten, which 1s a vineyard, and change it to Karmi. Karmi is a\n[indecipherable] name of a vineyard. Why do we have to be called Weingarten? So that was a\nperiod that a lot of Israelis went through, and changed their names. And I think what happened\nalso at that time, our Prime Minister Ben-Gurion, when he sent people overseas, diplomatic\nexcursions or whatever, representing Israel, he wanted them to have Hebrew names and not\nnames that were carried from the Diaspora or what have you, yes.",
        "Q: So you got married after how long? How long did you know your husband?",
        "A: Seven months, we got married, and --",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t have to go into the army.",
        "A: And then I didn\u2019t have to go to the army, yes.",

        "A: Herzliya.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Ina -- a little town called Kfar Shmaryahu. We lived there, my husband received a house\nfrom his folks. And we lived in that little house for almost three years. And in 19 -- and my\ndaughter was born in Israel.",
        "Q: Were you working at all, were you teaching?",
        "A: I just taught for one year in Israel, in elementary school. And then my daughter was born, so I\nstopped.",
        "Q: And your husband was doing what?",
        "A: My husband worked for an Israeli company doing refrigeration. Yes, refrigeration that was\ncalled Ampa, and that was his trade. And in 1963 we immigrated to America.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: This cousin, Jake Schutzman, who sent papers to my father in Poland, which took few year\nfor my father to deposit it in the American embassy. Things were forgotten, years went by,\nnobody thought about it. It was just erased. One day my father receives a letter from the\nAmerican embassy. They are sum -- summoning him to come -- calling him to come to the\nAmerican embassy. He went -- he didn\u2019t say anything to us -- he went to the American embassy\nto find out why are they inviting him. And -- completely slipped his mind, this whole episode\nwhat he did in Poland years ago. It was like 11 or 12 years ago. He came to the embassy and\nfrom what I understand, they told him, Mr. Weingarten, your Polish quota -- you deposited\npapers in this and this year, has finally matured. If you want, if you have a sponsor, you can go\nto United States within the next six months. My father came to us and he said listen, I got this\nletter and they said that I can now immigrate to America, but I\u2019m too old and I\u2019m not gonna start\nmy life all over again. Your name 1s there, and Dahlia\u2019s name is there and Mama\u2019s name,\nanybody who wants to go -- you want to go, go. I don\u2019t know whether you can go, he says, but\ntake this letter and go to the American embassy and see whether you have any rights at all. Well,\na seed was planted in my mind. I said to my husband, you know what? Why don\u2019t we go and\ncheck out? Out of curiosity. We don\u2019t have to go, but let\u2019s go and see. Maybe we can go for a\nyear, or two years, whatever it is, we don\u2019t have to sell anything. Why don\u2019t we just go and see?\nIf it works, fine, if not, not. So I finally convinced him to go to -- to take the ride with me to Tel\nAviv, to the consulate, because the embassy was -- was at the -- yeah, the embassy was in Tel\nAviv, not in [indecipherable] in -- in -- in Tel Aviv, right. And we arrived there, a young couple\nand we -- I -- you know, with my broken English at the time, and he looked at us, the -- we -- we\nmet with the consul. And the consul said, we -- he said, you are Anita Weingarten? Yes, I am\nAnita Weingarten. Well you -- you -- you have the right to go. You have the right like your\nfather does, the same way. You are m -- but I -- you are married and you have a child, he said,\nwe Americans do not separate families. I\u20191l never forget that sentence. We will add your husband\nand your child to your quota, and in five months you can go. Three months I think he said even, I\ndon\u2019t -- you know. Well, providing that you have somebody who can sponsor you so you don\u2019t\nfall on the American government as a burden. So I came, I said, listen Dad -- he said well, we\nhave a cousin in Washington, Jake Schutzman. Write to him and see how he responds to it. So I\nwrote him a letter, and he said, anything and everything that I can do for you, I will do. And we\nended up in Washington.",

        "A: His stepfather, Holzman, you know, he said okay, well the kids want to try, you know, let\nthem try, we\u2019re not gonna stop them, and so forth. For her it was very difficult because she had\nonly one granddaughter, that was my daughter, and you know, removing her away and so forth,\nso that was difficult. But then -- since then it\u2019s the history.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re here in -- in the United States. What did the United States represent to you at that\npoint in your life?",
        "A: Loved America from the very beginning.",
        "Q: You did.",

        "Q: Did you -- did you speak English well at that point?",
        "A: Spoke, you know, like a graduate of a seminar, but I -- I love languages and when we arrived\nhere -- and of course with the help of my second cousin, Jake Schutzman, I immediately\nenrolled, with my certificates, I started taking courses at Baltimore Hebrew College, and they --\na professor -- the professors used to come to Washington, D.C. and give lectures and I started\nlearning. I also listened to the radio. I repeated sentences when I turned on the television and I\nused to repeat after whoever appeared on television, whatever it was, I used to repeat the\nsentences. And learned the language.",
        "Q: Did you fly from Israel to --",
        "A: No, we took a boat.",

        "A: Absolutely. And my ha --",
        "Q: Was that an emotional experience?",
        "A: Yes, it was, absolutely, because it was also my husband\u2019s birthday when we docked in New\nYork. His 26\" birthday in April. April 28\". And it was a very emotional -- now, my husband,\nwhen we atri -- when we -- you know, when we were planning to leave Israel, and before that we\nsaw a movie called \u201cWest Side Story.\u201d And my husband said, is this America? That\u2019s what it\nlooks like? I said, well I don\u2019t think all America is what you see in \u201cWest Side Story.\u201d So he was\na little hesitant, you know, he said, what am I gonna do there, and I said don\u2019t worry, whatever --\nwe'll find what to do. We won\u2019t -- we won\u2019t be lost. And with that kind of attitude, you know,\nmy cousin Jake Schutzman started looking for him to find him a job so he can, you know, find\nhis way, and he did, you know, went in the evening, took courses in English and slowly, slowly\nprogressed.",
        "Q: And what kind of work did he do?",
        "A: And he started -- actually, he worked for two companies. The first company that hired him,\nyou know, when they told him to bring a certain tool he didn\u2019t understand exactly what they\nmeant, so they he -- he brought another tool, and he didn\u2019t last there too long, they fired him, and\nhe was very devastated because he was never fired before. But that\u2019s part of, you know, you --\nyou -- you acclimate yourself that way, that\u2019s part of life. And so then he worked for another\ngentleman, in fact the gentleman was a member of Beth El and I don\u2019t know what happened\nthen, they fired him. And then I took the initiative into my own hands, opened the yellow pages,\nlooked under heating and air conditioning and that was July, and we arrived in April. May, June,\nJuly, we were three months in Washington and I just figured out I\u2019m going to cope, and I\nhappened to land on a company named Dependo. And I called up and Mr. Blom answered the\nphone, and I said, we are from Israel, we are here three months and my husband worked in this\nline in Israel, in refrigeration and so forth. He said, okay, send him in. And he went and he got\nthe job and he worked there for seven years. And after seven years he decided well, time to go on\nmy own. And since then, with another partner and they opened their own business, and then, you\nknow, sometimes partnerships does -- doesn\u2019t always work well, and after, I think, two years or\nso they separated and my husband went on his own. And sine then has been on his own and has\nhis own company.",
        "Q: Did you have any more children?",
        "A: Yes, I have a son here in America and he was born in 1976.",

        "Q: As a teacher?",
        "A: As a substitute teacher at B\u2019nai Israel, at the time it was on 16\u2122 Street. And then I got a job in\nBeth El the following year on Old Georgetown Road and I worked there for, I think, seven or\neight years as a teacher, as a Hebrew teacher. And vis-a-vis I constantly studied through courses\nfrom Baltimore Hebrew College and got a degree there. And continued working -- later when we\nmoved -- we lived in Silver Spring. At first we lived in Washington, D.C. for two years and then\nwe bought a town house in Silver Spring and we lived there for seven years. And after seven\nyears we bought this house where we are in now, in Potomac. And I switched and I worked for\nHa Shalom, vis-a-vis at the -- what is today Charles E. Smith\u2019s Jewish Day School. And I sent\nmy daughter to that school. Prior to that it was called Solomon Schechter school and it was\nhoused on East West highway at Ora Kodish and in Temple Shalom it was split and -- and I\nworked there for -- since \u201969 -- 1969 at Solomon Schechter and then it became Charles E.\nSmith\u2019s Jewish Day School. And worked with Hashalom for seven, eight years, then the last 20\nyears at Washington Hebrew congregation.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about what your thoughts and feelings are. What are your thoughts about\nGermany? Granted, you don\u2019t have direct memories of the war, but your life certainly was\naffected by it --",
        "A: Yes --",
        "Q: -- obviously.",
        "A: -- absolutely. Right.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about Germans and Germany?",
        "A: My thoughts are I\u2019m sure that there were good people in Germany like in a -- any other\ncountry, es-especially at -- beginning when I was younger, of course I hated anything that had to\ndo with Germany or Germans, even to a point that even when my husband says well, maybe we\nshould go to Europe and go to Germany, I said I don\u2019t feel like going there. I said I don\u2019t want to\nbuy any car that\u2019s made in -- in germa -- in -- you know, that has anything to do with the German\nmanufacturing, or anything that it was manufactured in Germany. You know, some people buy\nMercedeses and so I said no, this is not for us, and I was -- and I\u2019m still, until today, not -- you\nknow. But I don\u2019t -- you know, there\u2019s no such thing really that I hate, cause I don\u2019t know what\nto hate there, or not to like there. But I feel that anti-Semitism still exists there and -- and -- and\non the other hand, now that -- when you read, you know, it\u2019s 60 some years after the war, and\nyou read the circumstances that brought Hitler to power, and the people that would not\nnecessarily follow, or obey, or belong to the Jugenrat, or whatever it is, were immediately either\npunished or -- or -- you know, they were sentenced to death or they had -- they were not getting\nthe rations or the food. So you -- you felt that those people were, in a sense pressured for their\nown survival, in order for them to survive, so they went with him and they wouldn\u2019t oppose him,\nbecause if they would, they would lose whatever they had. So, you know, it\u2019s from -- sometimes\nyou wonder. Such a thing can happen all over again, and the question is, how would the\npopulation react? Would everybody worry just about himself or themselves and to heck with the\nrest of the world as long as I have my food and I have my job and I\u2019m not being threatened?\nThen I, you know, so what do I care about this minority, that minority, whatever min -- 1t\u2019s very\npossible that this can, you know, that this -- that this is the reaction of maybe humanity, I don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "Q: Right, mm-hm. Do you consider yourself a survivor?",
        "A: Absolutely, yes. Yes, I do. I consider myself a survivor thanks to that family that took me in.\nIf not the family, I doubted whether I would survive.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I -- you se -- you said that professionally you\u2019ve taught at different Hebrew schools",
        "A: Right, yeah.",

        "A: Lam more --",
        "Q: -- a Jewish history?",
        "A: Iam more of a Reformed Jew. I am not an Orthodox Jew, because that really doesn\u2019t speak to\nme. So, I believe in what is called live and let live. And I don\u2019t think that really by being an\nOrthodox Jew and -- and -- and doing everything the way the Orthodoxy does, that this is the\nonly way. I believe that Judaism is much broader, much larger, and whether you follow exactly\nas the Torah tells you to follow, or the Talmud, that you are a better Jew than I am. I don\u2019t think\nSO.",
        "Q: Do you can -- how --",
        "A: I keep Shabbat, I light the candles, I like the Jewish atmosphere. We celebrate the holidays.\nWhether I run to the synagogue to pray and think that the salvation will come from God? No, I\nbelieve it comes from you. And there is even a sentence in Hebrew, it says [speaks Hebrew\nhere]. And ami is I. The emphasis is first on I. Not [speaks Hebrew], but on I. And that\u2019s what I\nbelieve that is. I, or an -- every individual really is responsible for his deeds and -- and you\nknow.",
        "Q: How would you describe yourself? Would you describe yourself as Jewish, American, Polish,\nIsraeli?",
        "A: Not -- no, not necessarily Polish. And I was thinking about it and sometimes I thought maybe\na world citizen would be real nice. To be just a world citizen.",
        "Q: So, have you --",
        "A: But I feel very close to Israel, definitely I do. And I feel that Jews need to have their own\nhomeland and not be spread all over. We should -- we have to have our own homeland, and if we\nwant to live in other places in the world, that\u2019s fine, but we need to have a homeland at this\npoint. If -- which is a Utopian thought, one day borders will be broken and people will -- you\nknow, that\u2019s something far-fetched, into the long, long future. So at this point we need our\nhomeland, we need our base.",

        "A: Americans.",
        "Q: Americans.",
        "A: Americans, yes. They consider themselves Americans and they love Israel, because I have\ntaken them couple times to Israel. They have been numerous times to the land of Israel. One of\nmy granddaughter had the Bat Mitzvah. One of my granddaughter graduated Charles E. Smith\nJewish Day School and went to Israel with them, and went prior to Israel. So they feel a bond\nwith Israel, but they consider themselves American Jews.",

        "A: Yeah, to see -- to see what -- well, Boryslaw is not going to be the same when it was 66 years\nago, or 68 years ago, it\u2019s not the same. But I would like to see that.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Well, because you know, my father was born there, my grandmother, my mother, I was born -\n- to see the birthplace, basically. To see what it looks like. And -- and -- and j -- you know, there\nis a picture here that I have, which I happened to enlarge, but you can see what Boryslaw looked\nlike.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, yeah.",

        "A: No, I don\u2019t have that problem, no. What sometimes bothers me is the ignorance of -- of\npeople and -- and you know, it\u2019s a -- and it\u2019s natural, the ignorance of -- of -- of not knowing, or\nnot showing interest or -- or stuff like that, but I feel comfortable among those and among those,\nboth. I don\u2019t -- I have an occasionally discussions and -- and when I mention sometimes, you\nknow, a -- since I know the Jewish history well, and I know in every land where Jews lived\neventually there was a persecution of the Jewish people, and if I mention nobody knows whether\nthis is not going to happen in uni -- in America. Even though this is a free country and so forth,\nwe have no guarantee that this will not happen here. We don\u2019t know. Depends on population,\ndepends on education.

        "A: Wa -- yes. I have a feeling yes, probably so.",
        "Q: In what way?",
        "A: In terms of education. I don\u2019t think that if my folks would have left, before the war, let\u2019s say,\nand immigrated to America and I would have been born here, most likely they would have\nacclimated themselves to the life in America and -- and you know, when I look -- for instance, I\nwork in Washington Hebrew, so they have pictures from very early century when the synagogue\nwas built by German Jews. And you see the kids graduating and so forth and -- and every year it\nsays, this group graduated, that group graduated, \u00b041 - \u00b042 - \u201943 - \u201944. And then I think to myself,\nmy God, on the other side of the ocean, what was going on? Were they aware what was going\non? Did they do enough? See? So -- and I would probably fall in the same category.",

        "A: Probably maybe less sensitive to the whole issue of the suffering, maybe, of others. And --\nand you know what -- and -- and even today, when we hear about Darfur, or we hear -- hear\nabout others being repressed different parts of the world, you know, we say we pray for them,\nthis and that, and what are we doing? Are we changing?\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with Anita Etzyon. This is tape three, side A. Do you think people today have learned\nany -- any lessons of the Holocaust? Is there anything happening today that concerns you?",
        "A: Yes, conc -- there are a lot of things that are happening that concerns me. First of all, I see\nanti-Semitism on the rise. That concerns me. I don\u2019t know whether we are doing enough to stop\nit. I\u2019m sure there are means to stop it, but we -- maybe we are ignoring it and thinking the wave\nwill go away. That concerns me a great deal. What concerns me also is that the attitude toward\nthe state of Israel, my feeling is, in United States, has changed from the time that we arrived 45\nyears ago, or 46 years ago, to what is happening today. It\u2019s not the same, it changed for the\nworse. And I don\u2019t know if this is a -- a propaganda by a lot of Muslim countries, and -- and --\nand maybe anti-Semitism was kind of, you know, hidden and begins slowly to mushroom out.\nMaybe that hatred was there and somehow it -- it -- 1t -- it was either covered up, or maybe it has\nto do with the newer generation that sees things differently than the older generation. It -- it\ncould be. What scares me that -- that what we hear today, we did not hear that 40 or 30 years\nago. Whether it\u2019s in France, whether it\u2019s in -- in -- in Sweden, whether it\u2019s in -- in -- in Norway,\nHolland.",
        "Q: Do you compare it to Germany in the 30\u2019s?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: In what way?",
        "A: This -- this --",
        "Q: People\u2019s reactions?",
        "A: Yes, people -- I tell you what, another thing that worries me is also the economical situation,\nbecause when economy goes down, people are looking for scapegoats and through history we\nhave seen that, that\u2019s what happens. Because the everyday person comes across -- so he comes\nacross with the shopkeeper or the owner of -- of a bank, or the owner of a mall or the owner of a\ncar dealer or whatever, and many times he finds Jewish people in this -- in these areas. And --\nand -- and the hatred begins to boil. I don\u2019t know how to tell you but I just want to give you an\nexample. I had a girl from the Philippines that came and helped me, and they were hardly here a\nyear, and her remark was -- she hardly knew anybody and her remark was, oh, all Jewish people\nare rich. And I said no, that\u2019s not true, not all Jewish people are rich. Jewish people, they are\nready to work, they are resourceful and they don\u2019t sit and wait for manna from heaven to fall.\nYou know, not all Jewish people are rich, that\u2019s wrong. But I just -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the\nperception. And what I find out with the younger generation now, scares me. The younger\ngeneration scares me.",
        "Q: In their sense of lack of awareness?",
        "A: Lack of awareness, lack of knowledge, easy to blame. It does. And I\u2019ll give you an example.\nYesterday I heard a story of a child, and I don\u2019t want to mention names, who went to a camp\nover summer and there were -- he was put with another kid. It\u2019s -- 1t wasn\u2019t just only a Jewish\ncamp, it was a camp for Jews and everybody else. And there was another child in his bunk who\nwas not Jewish -- and we are talking about 11 year old kid, who said to the Jewish kid, he said,\nall Jews should die. Now where does an 11 year old child come with such a statement? He must\nhave heard it at home, or in the surrounding that he comes from. So the father mentioned that the\nJewish kid slugged him, gave him a beating for it, you know. And -- and it shows you that 11\nyear old kid today, you know, like -- so are we reversing? What\u2019s happening? I wish I would\nhave an answer for all that, but I really don\u2019t. But I\u2019m very sensitive to it, I guess more than\nothers.",
        "Q: Because?",
        "A: Because my family experienced it.",
        "Q: Right. What are your thoughts when you enter the Holocaust Museum in Washington? Or --\nhave you been there?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, I have been there. Depressing. Yeah, very depressing.",
        "Q: Whe -- wh-where --",
        "A: Emotionally, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Do you feel it\u2019s necessary to have that kind of a museum?",
        "A: Absolutely, yes, very much so. Yeah.",
        "Q: But -- for educational pur --",
        "A: For educational purposes, for the second generation, because what happened, you know,\nthings are forgotten, as the years pass by. And we know for instance that some leaders of\ncountries deny the whole idea of Holocaust, it never existed, like Ahmadinejad. And what\nbothers me very much, that those very, very ultra-Orthodox Jews side with him and say there is\nno need for the state [indecipherable] the Messiah will arrive. And I don\u2019t know how long, but if\nhe would have crawled already, he would have been here, right? So I don\u2019t know when the\nMessiah will arrive. But yeah, def-definitely there is a need.",
        "Q: Do you feel that what you went through as a young child, and all your childhood is the\ndefining event of who you are, the defining element of who you are?",
        "A: Oh yes. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think it\u2019s a defining [indecipherable] yes.",
        "Q: You said it\u2019s made you more sensitive, you did say that.",
        "A: Right. Yes.",
        "Q: And then the other ways tha --",
        "A: More aware of different situations. Stronger, in a sense that I don\u2019t give in so quickly. I -- I\ndon\u2019t know if it\u2019s inborn or -- or -- or whatever I -- I like to achieve. I set a goal, I go after it. I\ndon\u2019t back out or -- or feel oh, I can\u2019t do it, or whatever. I guess that\u2019s it, basically.",
        "Q: Do you think about your childhood often?",
        "A: I do from time to time, but not that often. I don\u2019t dwell on it. I\u2019m trying not to dwell on it,\nbecause you know, if I\u2019Il start dwelling on it and I\u2019Il become really a miserable human being and\nI don\u2019t want that. And so --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What was your reaction during the Eichmann trial? Do you remember that?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Eichmann trial we were here already, in United States.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yes. I -- you know what I mem -- now that you brought it up, I remember looking at him\nsitting in that glass booth, he looked to me like a nebbish nothing. And yet, I thought to myself,\none human being like that, look much harm he did. And -- and -- and -- and what kind of -- you\nknow some -- I -- what kind of thoughts he had when he did what he did? What kind of feeling\nor attitude, or did he have any pity, or -- for others? No, you didn\u2019t see that. I don\u2019t know, I just -\n- you know. I didn\u2019t even feel such hatred toward him because he looked so nebbish to me, you\nknow? But then, when you think about it, were those people in those position emotionally\n[indecipherable] people, when you think about it, that they needed that boost, for being so\nimportant and having this power in their hands that their heads were totally -- I don\u2019t know, the\nbrain was totally screwed up that they could do that to others? How could you explain it?",
        "Q: Speaking of how to explain things, in raising your children --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- did you talk about your past --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: -- did you bring -- was this a big element in the raising of your children?",
        "A: Yes, it was.",
        "Q: In what ways?",
        "A: But 1 -- you know, I used to tell them that, but I didn\u2019t want them, especially my daughter\nwhen she was young, you know, to feel, you know, to feel constant sorrow or -- or -- or seeing\nher mother being depressed, or what. So I really didn\u2019t -- I did and did not put such emphasis\nwhen she was younger. But she heard the stories ha -- you know, my childhood, she knew about\nthat, yeah, and my growing up and so forth. So they know it and my grandchildren as well. They\nwere very fascinated. They always used to come when they were younger, and Grandma tell us,\nso what did you do and -- and do you remember, did you have friends? You know, the little\nthings that little children ask.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Things like that. And you know, they -- th-they know that I\u2019m a survivor. They know that I\nam a child that survived the war.",
        "Q: Are you a member of any of the hidden children groups?",
        "A: I was at the beginning. There wa -- I remember they started it here in Washington some time,\nbut then I did not pursue because I worked in the evenings and I couldn\u2019t always attend to the\nmeetings and --",
        "Q: You had said that you now -- you hadn\u2019t thought of, or you weren\u2019t thinking about going\nback to Poland, but now you -- you may --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So do -- are you -- as you\u2019ve gotten older, do you think more about your childhood than you\ndid?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, absolutely, yeah. Ye -- I would like to see that birthplace of mine, and also see\nwhat kept my father not wanting to leave Boryslaw or -- or Poland at all. And -- and sometimes I\nwonder, was it fear? Because I did the opposite of him. I was 20 -- not quite 23 - 24 when I came\nto United States, 23 and my husband was 26, with a child, and I was not afraid of changing,\ntrying something new. I don\u2019t know, maybe I was stupid, that -- that I have no clue. Young. But I\nwas not afraid, I always thought, you know what? We\u2019ll make it. Not -- things will be okay. And\nalways had this positive feeling of self assurance or whatever it is. And -- and I wasn't afraid.",
        "Q: Is your sister still in --",
        "A: In Israel --",
        "Q: In Israel.",
        "A: -- yes, yes, she 1s.",
        "Q: And is she able to come to visit you here?",
        "A: Oh yeah, she came couple times to visit me here, absolutely and we go and visit there, right.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And when you were an adult, did you talk more with your parents about the\nwar time?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Why not?",
        "A: Because they wouldn\u2019t bring up that subject and whenever I started asking -- and also keep in\nmind that I came in \u201963 to United States.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So that was really not a subject that they wanted to talk about because they themselves,\nespecially my father, used to get very emotional about it. And so not to aggravate him, or cause -",
        "Q: Get emotional about the war, or --",
        "A: The war and his life and everything that took place and you know, the whole thing, so it used\nto bring him, apparently memories that he didn\u2019t want to deal with. So not really, not much.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Were they able to come visit you here?",
        "A: Yes, they did, they came couple times here, and we tried to talk about it and -- you know.",
        "Q: Did they consider moving to --",
        "A: No, no, no, they were too old to do that. And you know, they were settled in their ways\nalready in Israel and in their lifestyle and so forth. But I have a feeling that my father regretted\nthe fact that he didn't move to United States when he was younger. When he came over and he\nsaw, you know and -- for the first time America so to speak and I had a feeling. He didn\u2019t --\nnever verbalized it, but I sensed that he regretted the fact that he didn\u2019t have the opportunity to\nmake it in a younger age.",
        "Q: When you were -- when he --",
        "A: Not -- not when he was 60 something, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But learning another language, as it was, he had difficulties learning Hebrew, so English, and",
        "Q: They eventually learned Hebrew?",
        "A: They did, but they still continued communicating either in German or Polish, yeah. Right.",
        "Q: Well, yeah, be -- before we close --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- is there any message you wanted to leave to your grandchildren? Anything you wanted to\nsay special to them?",
        "A: Well, special to them, I hope that they will be able to listen to the tape and go and visit the\nmuseum and -- and study and -- and learn and you know, they are young, but they -- eventually\nas they get older, I\u2019m sure they will, you know. A certain maturity comes with age. So that\u2019s\nwhat I would like to see, that they should study, be aware of their surroundings and also be\naware of anti-Semitism. That\u2019s what I would like to make sure that they do.",
        "Q: Right. Well, that\u2019s a very important note to end on. Is there anything else you wanted to add\nbe-before we close?",
        "A: You know, what I find out 1s that -- well, maybe now there is a more a-awakening among the\nJewish population toward the Holocaust and so forth, because I remember that some families\nwere saying no, don\u2019t teach it to our children. We don\u2019t want them to hear those terrible things,\nyou know, that happened. They\u2019re too young, they\u2019re too this. You know, like not experiencing\nit, or -- or even through stories and so forth. It\u2019s too sad. That\u2019s an -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a\ngood idea.",
        "Q: You think it should be taught.",
        "A: I think so, yes, yes. I think so. And that\u2019s the way I -- you know, that\u2019s how I feel.",

        "Answer: My full name is Anita Etzyon.",
        "A: I was born Anita Weingarten.",
        "A: I was born in 1941.",
        "A: October 4\", 1941 in a town, or city at that time in Poland. The name of the town is Boryslaw.",
        "A: Okay, my father, his name was Marek, in -- in engli -- in America he would probably be\ncalled Mark. Marek Weingarten and my birth mom, her name was Ethel Birenbaum from Chelm.\nOnce she married my father, she became Ethel Weingarten.",
        "A: He was born also in Boryslaw, Poland in 1906. April 25\", 1906, because my son was born 70\nyears down the road, April 25\", 1976. So I remember that. His background was, from what he\ntold me, is that at one point as a child he was sent away to -- I don\u2019t know if it was an orphanage\nor it was like a youth home for children. And he stayed there for awhile, and I think he was also\nschooled in that area. And then he returned. He also told me that his ancestors, or his father,\nwhich is actually my grandfather, his father came from Vienna. And in those days they made\nshidduchim, a shidduch, so he was matched up with my grandmother, who was from Poland, and\napparently from Boryslaw. So that\u2019s how the famil -- th-the roots of the family came from\nVienna into Poland into Boryslaw. And my father became a craftsman, but the word -- what\u2019s --\nnot a mechanic, but what is that called, the people who do fences from metal.",
        "A: I-I would say yeah. Worked with iron and created all kinds of things. And then s -- an-and --\nand I think also my grandfather was involved in it, but after awhile he gave it up and he decided\nto assemble bicycles. And he opened a little workshop for himself and he employed his younger\nbrother and he also employed a young man in that workshop and that\u2019s what they did, they\nassembled bicycles and sold bicycles because it -- in those years, that was the mean of\ntransportation, or you had a horse and a carriage, or you took the train. Not too many cars were\nyet in Poland. But what he told me that his dream was, before the war, to import cars into Poland\nand develop this -- this -- this whole idea of transportation. Well, unfortunately it didn\u2019t work\nout, World War 2 broke out and those dreams were shattered. The other thing also, which I can\nmention it, he told me that he also was drafted into the Polish army and he served in the Polish\narmy as a soldier.",
        "A: That is a good question.",
        "A: I think it was -- it must have been -- if he was born in 906, he must have been in his late 20\u2019s,\nI would say, maybe 22 - 24. And -- and he was very good in math, so he told me -- I asked him\nwhat was your job there in -- in the Polish army. And he told me it was buchalterie, which means\nit had to do with papers, and --",
        "A: -- bookkeeping and whatever that was involved in.",
        "A: He -- he was fluent in German, and wrote German and he was fluent in -- in -- in the Polish\nlanguage and wrote and read Polish, so -- you know.",
        "A: No, he never mentioned that, no, no. But --",
        "A: He came from a religious background, but he was not a religious man at all. He just simply\nturned away from religion. He felt that religion separates people and that was his outlook on life.",
        "A: Yeah, I -- my mother\u2019s background --",
        "A: My birth mother, now I don\u2019t know when she was born, but I know that she passed away\nwhen she was like 26 - 27, so --",
        "A: Oh, I wasn\u2019t even a year old, so if we can add to \u201941 -- go -- you know, go back. So that must\nhave been --",
        "A: Yeah, yes, she did, right.",
        "A: And what do I know about her? From -- very little that whatever my father told me about her.\nShe was a dressmaker and studied in Vienna. And apparently she was a very good one, very\ntalented.",
        "A: Ethel.",
        "A: And her last name was Birenbaum. Ethel Birenbaum. And then, you know, when my father\nmet her -- and I think my father was in his 30\u2019s when he got married, I think maybe 33 - 34,\nsomething like that.",
        "A: And I think they were married a short time, maybe hardly two years and -- and less --\nprobably less than even two years. But --",
        "A: The name Anita, my father said he named me Anita because when he ended up in that\norphanage or boys\u2019 dormitory, whatever it was, or -- or -- you know, when you send -- it was, I\nguess, customary in Europe to send children sometimes to go to school away from home, and\nfrom what he told me that his family, financially it was difficult for them to raise four children,\nso they sent him away as a young kid. And he said the woman that attended in that orphanage,\nher name was Anita and she was very kind and very nice and he said if ever he will have a child,\nand she will be a girl, he will name her Anita, and that\u2019s how I got the name Anita.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: My father remarried after -- immediately after the war. I was --",
        "A: After, immediately after. Not during the war, after the war.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: But what I --",
        "A: Okay. Okay, I --",
        "A: Right. I was told that the fellow that worked for my father, he was a Christian and I think a\nBaptist, he mentioned they were Baptists. And he lived not in Boryslaw, but -- but in a nearby\nvillage, apparently not too far. And when the war broke out -- and I was born in \u201941, in October,\nit was very difficult to hide with me as a child, and my father approached him. And apparently\nthey were very good friends on top of everything else, and my father approached him and asked\nhim if he would go to his -- he wasn\u2019t married yet, but he had a girlfriend, and his girlfriend was\na teacher in that village. And he said, you know, we cannot hide with my baby. Would you be\nwilling to take her? I'll pay you whatever I have, I\u2019ll -- you know, my money, and whatever I\nhave in terms of furniture, and anything that I have, I will give you and I\u2019Il help you to settle.\nTalk it over with your girlfriend. And so he did and -- his girlfriend at that time. They said -- she\nsaid fine, we marry, but we will have to move to another place because where did this kid come\nfrom, you know?",
        "A: The neighbors would see a baby they would immediately know that they are harboring a\nJewish kid. Hiding.",
        "A: No, I was less. I must have been like five months, four or five months. Very young, very\nlittle.",
        "A: Separate, not with me. She was hidden separately.",
        "A: She -- we were -- yeah.",
        "A: At this -- no --",
        "A: Mi -- at this time my birth mother was still alive, but we were separated. I was given to the\nBaptist family. Her name was Stefka if I remember correctly. His name I haven\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know.\nThe guy\u2019s name I don\u2019t know. Her -- her husband. Which eventually they married and moved to\nanother town. She was a teacher and apparently she got a job as a teacher. And with my father\u2019s\nfinancial help that he gave them, they were willing to take me -- and since they had no children,\ncause they were a young couple. And that\u2019s how I ended up with them. But in the meantime --",
        "A: This I have no clue. My father never mentioned the name and I don\u2019t -- even if he did I don\u2019t\nremember the ti -- the town. So I spent with them til 19 -- til the end of the war, which was like\n1945.",
        "A: Not quite four, because I think -- what I remember --",
        "A: -- not the --",
        "A: -- three and a half.",
        "A: Well, I remember the journey, on a big truck that they came and picked me up with his new\nwife that my father remarried. I remember -- what I remember after the war, we ended up in a\napartment building, in a tall apartment building, and I remember my father brought little\nDominoes and we were building something with stacking up the Dominoes and if I\u2019m not\nmistaken he lit a -- a match and he put like a match in between those Dominoes and somehow I\nhave this image. Whether it really happened, that\u2019s what, you know, I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s\nwhat I remember, sitting in an apartment building once I was apparently taken from the Christian\nfamily.",
        "A: Okay. My father told me that he was captured, couple times by the Germans. And the way he\ntold me, that the Germans used to come into the town --",
        "A: He stayed in Boryslaw. And what they did, they knew -- it was called aksia, like you know,\non this and that day the Germans are coming and speaking to the Jewish authorities, the rabbis,\nwhatever it is, we need so many Jewish workers for a certain project. Please make sure that on\nthis and that date they all concentrate in the square, they are ready to go. We build a bridge, or\nwhatever it may be. And my father was pretty clever, he realized that at that time already, you\nknow, there were rumors that they are being sent, but they\u2019re not being sent to build bridges or\nwhatever it 1s. So prior to that aksia he used to run away and escape from Boryslaw. During the\ntime -- I\u2019m going back now -- he managed to hide my mother -- my birth mother and my\ngrandmother with a Christian woman, and he paid her. And what he claimed was, she was hiding\nwas in a hole in the ground where they kept like potatoes and onions over the winter so it\nshouldn\u2019t go rotten, you know, they didn\u2019t have fridges in those days yet, so that\u2019s where she sat\nwith her mother, day after day after day. And unfortunately she contracted a --",
        "A: Tuberculosis, yes. It started with like emphysema, and you know, they didn\u2019t have antibiotics\nand the conditions were horrible and so forth. And then she developed TB and she passed away.\nIf she would not have contracted TB, she would probably survived.",
        "A: And unfortunately when she died in \u201942, the Christian lady just chased my grandmother out,\nshe said, I don\u2019t want to keep this old lady, out. And she ended up in one of the concentration\ncamps, and you know the end of it 1s, you know, death.",
        "A: Um --",
        "A: It\u2019s near Lvov.",
        "A: Drohobycz. In that vicinity.",
        "A: It\u2019s called DoyIni slonsk.",
        "A: And apparently there was a big Jewish commun -- I mean, I don\u2019t know how big, but it was a\nr -- arelatively large Jewish community there. And Boryslaw was known for having oil -- oil.\nSo, you know, they were digging for oil and they found oil in Boryslaw, so they had, you know,\nthose --",
        "A: Yes, right there, right.",
        "A: Yeah. What my father said, that during the time of the war, when he managed to escape each\ntime there was an aksia --",
        "A: -- and one time he was even caught and he ran away from -- managed to escape the camp. He\nused to come periodically to visit me at that village, but I was not supposed to know that he was\nmy father and they gave him a nickname like Chapchuss. You know, whatever, that means\nnothing. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s like a blabber word, whatever. So whenever they said oh,\nChapchuss is coming to see you. Because in case, if one of the neighbors or Germans would\ncome in, I may say, aw, Marek Wein -- whatever. In order not to have that, he was called\nChapchuss. So, that was the name.",
        "A: Oh, my name was Anna Theresa Beitsko.",
        "A: And apparently that was their name, yes. I was also baptized, by the way. I was taken to\nchurch as a baby and baptized. So it shows you, I must have been a couple months old, you\nknow. I don\u2019t know, four or five, something like that. I was baptized and I was their child. Now,\nafter the war, when the war ended, they maybe thought that nobody will survive, cause my mom\ndied, grandma was taken into a concentration camp. They thought my father, who knows, he\nprobably won\u2019t survive either. But he did, and so immediately after the war, a law came out in\nPoland that if there is a parent and there is a child that survived, they have to be united. So that\u2019s\nwhat happened. He came and -- and me -- remarried immediately after the war and came to claim\nme. From what he said, they didn\u2019t want to give me up, cause they already raised me and I was\nthree and a half, and they ran away, he claimed with me, and they hid someplace. But eventually,\nyou know, the police -- the Polish police, which was, I think, called Enkavide and the Russian\npolice too, together came and they said you -- that\u2019s it, you must return the child. He is the\nrightful father and, you know. And that\u2019s it. And I remember the journey on a truck, in the back\nof a truck, we were sitting on a truck and my father bought me this huge bear, which wasn't so\nhuge, but it -- in my eyes it was huge and it made moo each time you turned it, and I was\npetrified. I was so scared of that bear. On the other hand I also got a doll, you know, and that\u2019s it.\nAnd then we rode on the track to a city called Lignice and we settled there for awhile. There\nwere lots of Russians. I de -- remember, because we lived there already for almost a year, or\nmaybe even a year and a half. So now I started having memories of that place. My father opened\na shop, like a deli place and --",
        "A: My step-mom is also a survivor. Her name was Clara Bardah from Chelm. She was one of six\nchildren. They were five sisters and one brother, and her parents both, Sela -- and I forgot the\ngrandfather\u2019s name.",
        "A: Bardah.",
        "A: Her -- her --",

This -- her\nhusband\u2019s name, last name was Wolfe, but the first name I don\u2019t remember calling him grandpa,\nbut not by the first name.",
        "A: Yeah, yes, yes.",

        "A: No, no, my step-mom, they all managed to get false papers that they are Christians. They all\nhad, except one sister, all had blue eyes. They tied -- you know, they color their hair blonde and\nthey resemble the Irish race, let\u2019s put it that way, yeah. This was arranged by one -- from what I\nlearned, what they told me, by one Christian man who worked in the government, who fell in\nlove with one of the sisters. And they were very pretty, that\u2019s true, they were beautiful women.\nThree of them were really gorgeous cause I remember them when they, you know, moved to\nIsrael and so forth, so they were very attractive at that time, too. So I can imagine when they\nwere young, they were probably very attractive. And he managed to arrange for all the five of th\n-- four of them to be -- the fifth one could not, because the fifth one was beautiful, but dark hair,\nbrown eyes. You know, she did not look like an --",

        "A: And she used to tell us -- she used to tell me, my stepmother it was nerve-wracking,\npretending what you are not and acting what you are not and -- and -- you know, and -- so that\u2019s\nhow they survived. Now, my grandfather, my step-grandfather, who in Poland, interesting was --\nowned farmland. Not that he himself farmed it, but he was a farmer, basically, and that was a\nlittle bit unusual for Jews at that time to owe -- own land and be a farmer. But he did, he had a\nlot of land and you know, they grew potatoes and -- and whatever farmers did grow in those days\nand he had people who worked on the land. But with hi -- he was very religious. He used to pray\nthree times a day with the Tefillin and all that. And during the war it was very difficult to hide\nthem. So -- but they survived. They said that in the apartment they used to rip off the floor and\nthere was like a sub-floor. And whenever there was an aksia coming, you know, that the\nGermans are coming to search for Jews, they used to hide them in there, they used to lay flat,\nboard it again, put that carpet on, you know, and they had to lie there quietly, not a peep out of\ntheir mouth til the period of the aksia, you know, when -- then at night maybe they lift it up so\nthey could go to the bathroom or whatever. So that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s basically how they\nsurvived. Now, her brother was drafted into the army and sent to the Russian border and he\nperished there.",
        "A: In -- in Lignice.",
        "A: Well, the fact that my father opened a store, I remember, and I remember Russian soldiers\ncoming in. And in fact I remember there was a toilet and the Russian opened the door. They\ndidn\u2019t know what that looked, looked like a sink and they started washing themselves in that\ntoilet. I remember that. I remember even seeing the Russian soldier and I asked my father how\ncome they don\u2019t have shoes on. Some of them came, and that was after the war, they had no\nshoes. They had their feet wrapped with cloth and with, like blankets and tied with a rope and I\nlooked at that, it looked horrible to me because it looked like, you know, something in outer spa\n-- not normal. Not normal for a child because I already had shoes on and my father had shoes on\nand here are coming those poor soldiers, you know, and they looked dreadful. I remember that. I\nalso remember not a very pleasant episode in that apartment that we stayed. And apparently there\nwas a hospital not far from there. One night I remember screaming and yelling in Polish,\nratumko, and ratumko means save us, save us, save us. Apparently some Russian soldiers, drunk\nsoldiers came into the apartment and started beating on the door. And I remember waking up and\nopening the door and seeing blood on the door. And I was rushed in very quickly by my step-\nmom, quickly into the room and I don\u2019t know, I think I hid under the bed from fear or what have\nyou.

My father felt well, now you as a German -- that\u2019s what he said, I said, why did\n-- at one point, you know, when I was older, I questioned that and he said well, that was my\nrevenge. Now she\u2019s gonna work for us. That was his interpretation, or his revenge. She was\ngoing to be the housekeeper and she was going to work for us. And I remember her in the\nkitchen doing the noodles, you know, the old kind where you roll -- made the dough, you rolled\nit out, and I was watching how she was cutting it into strips. What else? You know, I --\napparently she must have taken care of me. I don\u2019t remember much of a relationship with her.",

Now, I must have gone through some\ntraumatic experience because I called her Mama, but I apparently didn\u2019t attach myself to her yet\nas a mama. So I don\u2019t remember too much as -- you know, of -- of -- kind of a n -- nurturing time\nwith her. This I don\u2019t remember, really. There wasn\u2019t such a nurturing time. Maybe Gertrude\nwas supposed to fill 1t in, but she -- you know, she didn\u2019t. So, you know, I -- I\u2019m sure that my\nphysical taking care was taken care of, you know, making sure that I was fed and making sure\nthat I was dressed and combed and bathed or whatever it is, but I really don\u2019t remember sitting\nand -- you know, and -- and listening to a story or playing some games.

Nothing about the past, that I was raised by a period of my life\nwith a Christian family or that I had a birth mom. No, that was -- that was discovered much later.",

        "A: And he didn\u2019t want to leave his parents, you know, your commitment to the family, so forth.\nAnd maybe also my father was not that adventurous to move, you know, from different\nlanguages, you have to start all over. He just didn\u2019t -- he wasn\u2019t willing to do that.",
        "A: I think because -- my feeling -- he never said that, but that was my feeling, since he lived with\nthe sisters and their husbands and my mother with a big family, and I don\u2019t know whether he was\nplanning to advance himself in the business area, whatever. He decided he\u2019s moving away. So he\nmoved to Swidnica.",
        "A: Not that far. Closer to Wroclaw, which is another city in Poland. Not that far, in that vicinity,\nI don\u2019t know, maybe half a day drive or something like that. And ha -- why did he do that I don\u2019t\nknow, but I know one thing. Where -- in Swidnica he opened immediately a business with a\nman, a Christian man who -- whose specialty was he -- to manufacture candies, all kinds of\ncandies. And so they [indecipherable] together and they opened a factory that produced\nchocolates and candy varieties, all kinds of varieties of sweets and a store in front that sold the\nproducts that they manufactured. And that\u2019s what my father did, and this I remember very well,\nbecause I must have been close to seven years old already, six and a half. I remember coming to\nthe store. I remember my father arranging all those gorgeous, beautiful candy boxes with -- with\nribbons and what have you, chocolates and all kinds of candies, hard candies, soft candies,\nchocolates, small chocolates, you know. All kinds of sweets and delicatessen, you know, all\nkinds of specialties. And it went very well, because after the war people were extremely hungry\nand they craved all those things that they didn\u2019t have. So he did very well in that respect and we\nwere in Poland, in Swidnica until 1951.",

        "A: And it was --",
        "A: I -- yes. It was so inculcucated into me that no matter what they said, I -- apparently there was\nsome ritual that I was taught as a little kid, you know, that I had to hold my hands together and\nsay a prayer before I go to sleep, and these things and that stayed with me for a pretty long time.\nSo I was -- I\u2019m the only Jewish kid in -- in the whole school and the teachers knew about it, that\nI\u2019m Jewish, you know, I\u2019m not a Christian. But I wouldn\u2019t accept that. I wanted to be like all the\nrest of the kids in school, in the classroom. And I remember a priest -- we -- we had in Poland at\nthat time, religious lessons in -- in -- in -- in school. And I remember the priest used to come and\nhe used to say, Anita, up and leave the class. And I used to burst out in tears, because this was a\nreligious --",

        "A: No, not negative, you know, pointing to me that I\u2019m a Jew or something like that, no, no.\nWhat I do remember is at the end of, I think it\u2019s the second grade, everybody got -- every child\ngot a book -- that\u2019s my husband -- every child got a book as a gift. I got the most smallest, little,\ntiny book. Everybody got nice, big books as a gift at the end of the year and I just got a tiny little\none.",

        "A: No, not necessarily religious books, no, no, no. But as a gift, as a token to the student, and I\ngot a little one. And of course I came home and I carried on and so my father and my step-mom\nwent to school and they said, how come you gave her such a little book and all the other kids got\nbig ones, she got just a little one, you know. And I don\u2019t know if that was an indication of\nwhatever. I have no clue. This is what I remember. And other than that --",

        "A: Yes, after school we went to church and after that I went home. So sometimes she used to\ncome to me. I had a feeling that, you know, she used to come and play but not as often as I\nwanted her to come, so maybe the parents were not so happy that she associates with a Jewish\nkid or whatever, I don\u2019t know. They probably did know that I\u2019m not Christian, even though I\nkeep on saying that I was [indecipherable]",
        "A: The Russian presence I remember only in Lignice, not in Swidnica.",
        "A: In Swidnica I don\u2019t remember the Russian presence -- presence at all, not at all. But what\nhappened after 1951 when we -- when we left Poland and immigrated to Israel is that the\nRussians were coming into Poland apparently and chopping down all the private initiatives.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: The decision they made to leave was because her sisters started immigrating to Israel. No,\nsorry, no, no, no, no, they came after us, no. The reason -- you know, it\u2019s funny because now I\nremember that once my stepmother said that one of the reasons was because I was so engrossed\ninto Catholicism as a kid. She said that\u2019s one of the reasons -- she -- she said that eventually I'll\nend up marrying out of faith and that\u2019s it. So she said, now the Russians are already in Poland,\nthey\u2019re coming in, they\u2019re shutting the private initiatives, no more businesses. You will have to\nclose your business, your private business. Here is one reason and the other reason is that the\nkids will grow up -- because in the meantime I had a half sister that was born.",
        "A: 48 or \u201949.",
        "A: Her name was Henrika. Henrika, but her Hebrew name is Balia. Okay. And I think basically\nthat -- that\u2019s what drove them to come to Israel.

        "A: They let me, yes. And then after awhile they started not letting me. I remember that, it was a\nbig fight all ways. I always used to pin next to my bed, which had like, in those days had wooden\nbars. I used to pin Jesus, picture of Jesus and Mary Magdalena with her hands this way, that way,\nyou know. Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, I -- my father used to say a barren land, nothing to eat, desert, it\u2019s gonna be rough,\nrough times. You know, he pictured it very bleak.",
        "A: But went yeah, yeah. I think he actually wanted to come to United States, that was his dream,\nto come to America, but it did not materialize for him because -- I tell you the episode why. He\ncould have come the United States immediately after the war, because his cousin, his first cousin\nwho lived in Vienna, and he managed to escape in \u00b039, that\u2019s what I was told, and came directly\nto Washington, through family that arranged this for him, because in those days you just couldn\u2019t\ncome.",
        "A: You needed a sponsor and it had to be a quota too. So I don\u2019t know how, whether he had a\nquota, or maybe somebody really sponsored him with big chunk of money and said if something\nhappens, Jake Schutzman will [indecipherable] us, don\u2019t worry. So he arrived in \u201939 and\nimmediately after the war, there was a contact between my father and him. And my father started\nwith his business in wa -- in -- in Lignice and things were going well for him and he made good\nmoney and so forth. And he received a package from my cousin -- his -- his -- his cousin, which\nwas my second cousin, a package of clothing and he opened it up and he said, oh my God, what\na collection of some shmatas. What is he sending me, some shmatas? This is America, he says.\nThis is -- this is what life is in America? That\u2019s what -- I mean, here I have decent clothes, I -- I\nmean, it\u2019s a different life that I live than -- this is th -- you know, that was his impression for\nsome reason. And Jake Schutzman instead, sent him a letter and sent him papers to fill out at that\ntime and deposit it in the American embassy. He did that, but much later. I don\u2019t know, some\nyears went by, maybe three, four years went by by the time you went and deposited those papers\nin the American embassy. And -- and then he couldn\u2019t, in \u00b051, immigrate to United States\nbecause Poland -- Poland had a quota of so many people America would accept from Poland.\nAnd then you had to have a sponsor. So sponsor was Jake, but his financial situation at the\nbeginning, in \u201951 wasn\u2019t great. He wasn\u2019t that long in United States in order to sponsor, and so\nthe other option was only going to Israel.",

You couldn\u2019t take your wealth that you have accumulated, so you had to be very\nclever, how do you maneuver to get stuff out that, you know, is yours, that you earned it, you\nknow, over the years.

And there were also\npictures from United Jewish Appeal, I remember. You know, they were asking for donations and\nwe used to get those cards, and I used to look at the cards and they looked very fascinating, very\nnice, so from what my father said, barren land, and desert and nothing, and here are cards that\nshow farmers working, orange trees with oranges, lemons, it -- you know, it was -- it was\nappealing to a youngster.",

        "A: Hatfa.",
        "A: In Haifa, yes, Haifa. And we received like a bed, everybody got a bed, a folding bed, like\narmy bed with a blanket, and I think a pillow. And my father also brought food, by the way from\nPoland. I remember four jars, red jars, like milk jars, big ones, with schmaltz. Also dried\nmushrooms on a string, couple strings of that because there was no -- because we came at a time\nthat it was called senna, there was no food. Food was rationed in Israel at that time. And also\nsausages. But the kind that are dried, 1 -- where you don\u2019t have to refrigerate also. Strings of\nsausages. And I remember Daddy took a hammer and a nail from someplace and he hammered it\nto the pole of the tent and hung the sausages and the mushrooms and that the containers were put\naside. In that tent there were -- we were there, another Romanian family from Romania, which\nwe could not communicate and two other families from Yemen, which we could not\ncommunicate. The Yemenite Jews that came, they were dressed entirely different than those\nfrom Europe. And evening c-came, suppertime, they all sat on the floor and they put this big tray\nand they started eating with their hands. And my father and my step-mom, when they saw that,\nthey got up and they went real close to look and they spoke to each other in Polish and they\ncalled me to see. Look, look, take a look, look how they eat. I haven\u2019t seen anything like it. You\nsit on the ground and you eat with your hands. Where am I, he said. I came to like nomad lands.\nThis -- what is this, you know? He maybe envisioned in his head that it\u2019s going to be more\nEuropean but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s a mixture of Jews from all over the world. You know, and that was\nvery hard for him.

And th-then we had to move to\nanother -- it\u2019s called in Hebrew Ma\u2019barah, which is another absorption built for Olim\nChadashim, which are the newcomers. And we lived there for almost two years.",
        "A: It was ca -- it was called Ma\u2019barot gelee. It was in Herzliya on the way to Tel Aviv on the\nmain highway at that time, which was not quite a highway, it was like a dirt road in a sense, but\nthat\u2019s how it was. And we lived there for two years. It was one room, made out of tin with a --\nwith a base that was made out of concrete. The walls were made out of tin. And when it rained it\nwas like playing orchestra on top of your roof. We stayed there for two years. My father also\nbrought from Poland, I must say, furniture. My father brought a whole lift. Where was I?",
        "A: Yeah, Ma\u2019barot gelee --",
        "A: Ma\u2019 barah.",
        "A: And my father emi -- you know, he was at that time very depressed, I must say, very\ndepressed. Even in Boryslaw, which was not a very wealthy Jewish community there, he never\nlived in such conditions, where you live in one little room with -- you know, made out of tin --\npach, in Hebrew, really. And you know, and there were winds and rain and it was just miserable.\nBut, you know, as a kid, no matter where you stuck a kid, it\u2019s okay. You know, children are busy\ndoing their stuff, running around, you meet children, you get -- start playing. Even if I wasn\u2019t\nable to communicate, I still remember having couple friends there, because we -- we were all\nolim, we were all newcomers.",
        "A: No --",
        "A: -- no, no, no.",
        "A: Slowly, yes. I was picking up slowly Hebrew.",
        "A: But not to a degree that I was able to converse yet, or having a whole conversation.",
        "A: But I was picking it up. And --",
        "A: Yes, I went to school there, right. Again, it was a very similar situation in -- and we had like\nfew of those barracks or whatever, those one rooms that were -- in one room you could have two\ngrades, or three grades and one teacher would, you know, teach us. My father brought furniture\nfrom Poland, a lift. He was able to ship a lift. We had it for a long time, I remember, a whole\nbedroom set and a whole living room set with dining table and four chairs. Clothing, and also\nmoney, he was able to bring money and wa --",
        "A: N -- e -- that arrived in the port of Haifa eventually. I don\u2019t think it arrived with us, because\nthen it was transported -- this arrived a little bit later and it was transported to the absorption\nMa\u2019barot gelee, where we lived for two years. And I remember my father build another room by\nhimself to house this lift, cause there were a couple big boxes that he built in Poland, you know\nto hou -- to put the furniture in. He did that. My stepmother was very resource -- resourceful in\nthat respect. She remembered from home because her father owned land and he was a farmer, so\nwhat she did, she -- my father made her a big fence around that area that we lived. They fenced a\npiece of property, he could have done that, and she started a little farm of her own, with chickens\nand -- and ducks and -- and boy I remember and -- and turkeys, we had, and I remember how she\nused to hatch them, take those eggs and -- and put them in a basket and put a hen that was ready\nto sit on the eggs and -- and inc -- then the eggs incubated and then we had more chickens. And I\nwas in charge of the ducks, I remember. And since our -- our serif, that\u2019s what it was, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nthat ha -- little hat, was at the end and -- and at the end was a orange grove, a big orange grove.\nSo I used to go with the ducks and -- and whatever was there, I had a little stick, you know, like\na shepherd girl. Used to take -- there were four of them, they were pretty big, they are not the\nlittle ducks, they are those -- they look like swans in a sense, but they were --",
        "A: Geese, geese. Four of them. They were very aggressive, that\u2019s what I remember. Anybody\nwho came by they would attack, like a dog, you know, it\u2019s interesting. So I used to take those\ngeese to the orange orchard and they used to pasture there. There was like a big pipe that they\nused to water those trees. And water used to drip in a little -- and it formed like a little basin or\nsomething and those geese used to go and drink and eat the grass around and so forth. And I\nloved it, I remember that, that was just wonderful. And so you know, living in Ma\u2019barah for me\nwasn\u2019t difficult at all, I enjoyed it. I remember sh -- my mother planted corn and potatoes and I\nremember there was a mole who used to come and eat the potatoes and we were fighting that\nmole, you know, with -- with the hoes and water into this -- into their grooves that they made\nunderground, what have you. So for me I -- I enjoyed it. I -- I -- it didn\u2019t bother me at all living\nin a -- in hut.",
        "A: No, no. I didn\u2019t miss Poland, not at all. I remember taking the dishes -- for instance, you\ncouldn\u2019t wash dishes in this one hut, cause even though my father made a kitchen, but it was\nvery difficult to wash the dishes, so I used to take like a basket or -- or a big pail with the dirty\ndishes and they built like a long --",
        "A: A trough with faucets and everybody used to come and polish and wash their dishes there.\nAnother thing was, at the beginning when we moved into the -- Ma\u2019barah, you didn\u2019t have your\nprivate shower, so we all had to shower in a public shower that they built, you know, and they\ndidn't make it compartmentalized separate. They made -- you know, they put those showers and\neverybody in, you know, and my father and my mother they just -- they couldn\u2019t. So this -- first\nthing my father did after he built that room was immediately to put up a shower so he doesn\u2019t\nhave to go and shower. He was in that -- very handy. I must say he was very handy to put up a\nroom to house his furniture, to build the fence, to build a chicken coop for the chickens. So, you\nknow, make a little kitchen for my mom so she can cook and make a shower for us. Now, the\nbathroom had to be a public bathroom and so, you know, we used this public bathroom, which\nwasn\u2019t a bathroom like we are used to it, it was a hole. A huge hole in the ground and you know,\nthere were like four compartments, but there was a wall that separated those four, so thank God\nfor that. And I remember petrified going to the bathroom. Why? Because when I looked into the\nhole, I said oh my God, if I fall in there -- and I was small, you know, I wasn\u2019t a big kid or\nsomething. My God, if I fall into this hole. That was very, very scary. That was something that I\nremember til today, the fear of going to the bathroom, but you had to. You didn\u2019t have another\nfacility. So we lived there two years and in the meantime they managed to buy an apartment,\nwhich was in the process of being built, and it took almost, I don\u2019t know, a year or so to finish it,\nso that\u2019s why we stayed there almost two years. And then we moved to Herzliya, to a place\ncalled no -- a -- Noht Sarah, the dwellings of Sarah. It was a 40 -- 40 unit apartment, a long one,\na three story building.",
        "A: No, I still felt Polish.",
        "A: Yes, very Polish.",
        "A: Not Israeli.",
        "A: Was much better, right, and then I went ow -- enrolled -- they enrolled me in fifth grade\nelementary school. I was already -- by then I was 12 and I went into fifth grade. I was always a\nyear ahead of the others. When they were 11 in fifth grade, I was 12 in fifth grade. And maybe\nbecause of the lack of --",
        "A: -- language barrier and so forth, so you know, I couldn\u2019t keep up with the material. And by\nthen I already knew Hebrew and I was slowly acclimating myself. And luckily was that in\nHerzliya there were a few other kids that were not born sabras and that was a big thing in those\ndays, to be an Israeli. And here, I don\u2019t know if you heard or not, but the Israelis were not too\nhappy accepting the new immigrants and they called them, you know, in Hebrew they called\nthem subonim, which means soaps, like you -- you know, subonim. And they also wi -- didn\u2019t\naccept them, you know, they stuck together. And for me it was very important to penetrate that\nand become like one of them and not be this Polish immigrant.",
        "A: Yes. Whether they talked much about it at that time -- they mentioned it from time to time,\nthat we are all survivors and so forth.",
        "A: To be honest with you not -- I wasn\u2019t very proud of it at that time in Israel, that I\u2019m a\nsurvivor, you know, because --",
        "A: -- because in school, sometimes even the teachers when they were teaching, they were saying\noh, those Jews, they went like sheep to slaughter. They did not resist, they did not fight. Because\nin Israel the young generation, the soldiers, the Haganah, the [indecipherable] all of them, they\nwere fighters, they fought. Now the Jews in Europe, there was a resistance in ghetto Warsaw we\nknow and -- and other places, but they felt that the Jews went like sheep to slaughter, and -- and\nwe were part of that -- you know, part of those Jews who somehow managed to survive, but you\nknow -- so these were -- | -- I -- in fact I remember one of my teachers also said that, that the\nJews went like sheep to slaughter and I came home and I said it to my parents. And they were\nvery upset and they went and they talked to the teacher how, you know, whatever. But that was\nthe -- that was the attitude of -- of the Israelis in those days, you know. We are the sabras, we are\nthe born Israelis and you know, proud an-and you know, and tall and strong and whatever. Free.",
        "A: No, some of the children.",
        "A: At that time I don\u2019t think I knew what to answer.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think I knew what to answer.",
        "A: Yes, yes, that I was different, that my folks spoke Polish at home, which bothered me a lot,\nwe --",
        "A: They were learning, but fa -- 1t was so difficult for them, because it\u2019s a Semitic language and -\n- and -- and they just couldn\u2019t, you know, so they continued speaking Polish and -- and my father\nwasn\u2019t very happy the first couple years living in Israel, so he didn\u2019t make the effort to acclimate\nhimself into the society. So they had their Polish friends, which they communicate only in\nPolish. And -- and the other thing was that also when you went shopping -- well you didn\u2019t have\nsupermarkets then, but we had grocery shops, so the grocer spoke Yiddish, or German or Polish\nor whatever, so --",
        "A: Yes, they did, but they did not speak it.",
        "A: No, no, because wa -- they did not speak Yiddish. But later on I picked up somehow by, I\ndon\u2019t know, I picked up the language, not that I\u2019m fluent, but maybe because through my\nlanguage, my mother-in-law spoke Yiddish and Russian and so --",
        "A: No, when I was younger, no, I didn\u2019t speak any Yiddish at all. But my father spoke German\nand my step-mom probably spoke a little bit German, too.",
        "A: So -- but the base -- the language they spoke at home and the language we communicated --",
        "A: Was Polish. And when I had friends coming in, that came over to visit, was only Polish. I\nused to say, why don\u2019t you speak Hebrew, they don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying, you know.\nIt did upset me, you know, but that was the reality, I couldn't change it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yeah. Right, they did. After awhile they did.",
        "A: Yes. After awhile they did.",
        "A: Right, and I\u2019m going --",
        "A: -- t-to elementary school in Herzliya.",
        "A: Well, within the school, you know the activities that we had.",
        "A: No, not at all. Not at all. My parents turned 360 degrees away from religion, both of them.\nAnd they didn\u2019t really celebrate the holidays. Luckily they were in Israel, so I knew there was\nthis holiday, that holiday, you know, through school and so forth.",
        "A: Nothing at home, no, nothing at home.",
        "A: Right, life went on and then I went to the high school in -- in Herzliya as well and became\nquite -- you know, quite, involved in the social life of school and had a number of fu -- good\nfriends. And then, after --",
        "A: Yes, I did.",
        "A: That -- it was high school already, right. But, was interesting when I spoke Hebrew. I have an\naccent, a Polish accent in the Hebrew language and my pronunciation, you know, the R, raiche,\nyou can hear raiche. The Israeli sabras, they don\u2019t have the raiche, they have the raiche. So you\ncould tell that this is not a sabra because her raiche is not raiche, it\u2019s raiche.",
        "A: You know. Other than that, you know, I was -- I felt fine. I felt like any other Israeli.",
        "A: And then I went to a school called Seminare aki Butsim. After two years of high school in\nIsrael, I transferred to Tel Aviv to study in --",
        "A: No, without my family. They lived -- we lived in Herzliya but I communicate -- I commuted\nto Tel Aviv, to Seminare, which -- which prepared you to be a teacher, and I was there for four\nyears, so it was a continuation. And the reason why I switched was because 1n those days, and I\nthink it\u2019s today the same story, if you finish high school, you go to the army. Now, if you stop\nhigh school after two years, which is the 10\" grade and you transfer to a Seminare and you finish\nthe two years of high school in the Seminare plus two years in the same Seminare tea --\nbecoming a teacher, then you are not -- your education is not interrupted and you don\u2019t go to the\narmy. Now, but when you finish the Seminare and you are not married, you go to the army. So\nhappened I met my husband in the last year of Seminare aki Butsim. And I\u2019ll never forget he said\nto me, okay -- I said, you know that at the end of the year I have to go to serve, to the army. He\nsaid [indecipherable] you\u2019ll serve in my army. And we got married and that --",
        "A: I met my husband at a wedding that -- in the meantime my father got established in Israel and\nhe picked up a trade which I don\u2019t know whether he learned it in Israel or maybe he had some\nidea with another par -- par -- partner and he became a -- oh my God, listen -- hm -- plumber,\nwith another partner and Israel was -- at that time they were building Israel so he was doing all\nthe installations to the new homes in Herzliya and -- and so, you know, he did pretty well,\nworked very hard, you know, wasn\u2019t young any more. Took him at least five or eight years by\nthe time he managed to open a little business with this partner of his. And -- and you know, and\nwe lived in Herzliya and --",
        "A: Ohy -- absolutely, the younger one, yes.",
        "A: She is by eight years younger than me.",
        "A: Yeah, eight years, I think. Seven or eight years.",
        "A: And yeah, she stayed in Herzliya and went to school and --",
        "A: And my -- I -- at a wedding and it was a wedding of one of the builders that was marrying her\nson and my father was very insistent that I should go too to that wedding, and I didn't want to.\nBecause you have to understand that in Israel when you are 18, you are very self sufficient. You\ndon\u2019t go with your parents. And I said, I should go with you? And that makes sense. I don\u2019t want\nto go, I don\u2019t want to go. He said no, you should come, you should see a builder, he is a very\nwell-to-do man and a beautiful wedding and we\u2019re all invited and -- all right. So we wen -- I\nwent to the wedding with them and I wasn\u2019t very happy because I had to sit with them and it was\nboring, and interesting. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m going to back up now. When we came to Israel in 1951 there\nwas a family from Boryslaw that my father remembered. He was not 1n contact with this man,\nbut he knew that he immigrated to Israel. His name was Joseph Holzman. He immigrated to\nIsrael as a youngster when he was 17, before World War II. Left the family, his father, I think\ndied at a -- at the front fighting, I think, I don\u2019t know if it was the Pole [phone ringing] This man,\nJoseph Holzman, who was born in Boryslaw and my father knew him from Boryslaw, but there\nwas not really a contact between the two til my father arrived in Israel, and he said, I have to find\nthis man, I want to see what he does here so maybe he can guide me what to do in Israel. And so\nthis man Joseph Holzman, in Herzliya by the beach had a motel, a little motel and that was his\nbusiness. And so I remember I was -- we just -- you know, we just arrived in Israel and we were\nliving in the -- in that Sidney ali that I mentioned, which 1s close to where they lived and had\ntheir motel, so we went there one evening, and -- all of us, and you know, they spoke about\nwhatever. And that\u2019s it. And maybe he gave my father some advice and we left and that\u2019s it. And\nthere was never a contact any more. At the wedding his wife, Joseph\u2019s wife came to the\nwedding. He wasn\u2019t there because he stayed in the motel cause they had guests and he had to\nattend to the guests that they had. And -- but his wife was with her son at the wedding. And we\nwere ready to leave the wedding and go back home, it was around 11 o\u2019clock and we had to\ncatch the last bus from Tel Aviv, and so -- where the wedding took place. And Mrs. Holzman\nsaw my father and she remembered him, she said, hello Mr. Weingarten, how nice to see you,\nblah, blah, blah, and I\u2019m standing in the back. And she asks, and this is your daughter? And my\nfather said yes, and he introduced -- introduce yourself. So I introduced myself. She looked at\nme, grabbed me by the hand and she said, I have a very nice son, and I want you to meet him.\nAnd that was it, and the rest is history.",
        "A: That\u2019s how I met my future husband and we started dating and that\u2019s it, and it ended up in\nmarriage.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: Etzyon, correct.",
        "A: Because at that time it was very fashionable in Israel not to have a rooted Israeli name. Not\nHolzman, not Weingarten. Many, many families I remember at that time changed their names to\nHebrew names. And in fact, I went through that period too with my folks. I said, why don\u2019t you\nchange from Weingarten, which 1s a vineyard, and change it to Karmi. Karmi is a\n[indecipherable] name of a vineyard. Why do we have to be called Weingarten? So that was a\nperiod that a lot of Israelis went through, and changed their names. And I think what happened\nalso at that time, our Prime Minister Ben-Gurion, when he sent people overseas, diplomatic\nexcursions or whatever, representing Israel, he wanted them to have Hebrew names and not\nnames that were carried from the Diaspora or what have you, yes.",
        "A: Seven months, we got married, and --",
        "A: And then I didn\u2019t have to go to the army, yes.",
        "A: And he says I\u2019m still serving.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Herzliya.",
        "A: Ina -- a little town called Kfar Shmaryahu. We lived there, my husband received a house\nfrom his folks. And we lived in that little house for almost three years. And in 19 -- and my\ndaughter was born in Israel.",
        "A: I just taught for one year in Israel, in elementary school. And then my daughter was born, so I\nstopped.",
        "A: My husband worked for an Israeli company doing refrigeration. Yes, refrigeration that was\ncalled Ampa, and that was his trade. And in 1963 we immigrated to America.",
        "A: This cousin, Jake Schutzman, who sent papers to my father in Poland, which took few year\nfor my father to deposit it in the American embassy. Things were forgotten, years went by,\nnobody thought about it. It was just erased. One day my father receives a letter from the\nAmerican embassy. They are sum -- summoning him to come -- calling him to come to the\nAmerican embassy. He went -- he didn\u2019t say anything to us -- he went to the American embassy\nto find out why are they inviting him. And -- completely slipped his mind, this whole episode\nwhat he did in Poland years ago. It was like 11 or 12 years ago. He came to the embassy and\nfrom what I understand, they told him, Mr. Weingarten, your Polish quota -- you deposited\npapers in this and this year, has finally matured. If you want, if you have a sponsor, you can go\nto United States within the next six months. My father came to us and he said listen, I got this\nletter and they said that I can now immigrate to America, but I\u2019m too old and I\u2019m not gonna start\nmy life all over again. Your name 1s there, and Dahlia\u2019s name is there and Mama\u2019s name,\nanybody who wants to go -- you want to go, go. I don\u2019t know whether you can go, he says, but\ntake this letter and go to the American embassy and see whether you have any rights at all. Well,\na seed was planted in my mind. I said to my husband, you know what? Why don\u2019t we go and\ncheck out? Out of curiosity. We don\u2019t have to go, but let\u2019s go and see. Maybe we can go for a\nyear, or two years, whatever it is, we don\u2019t have to sell anything. Why don\u2019t we just go and see?\nIf it works, fine, if not, not. So I finally convinced him to go to -- to take the ride with me to Tel\nAviv, to the consulate, because the embassy was -- was at the -- yeah, the embassy was in Tel\nAviv, not in [indecipherable] in -- in -- in Tel Aviv, right. And we arrived there, a young couple\nand we -- I -- you know, with my broken English at the time, and he looked at us, the -- we -- we\nmet with the consul. And the consul said, we -- he said, you are Anita Weingarten? Yes, I am\nAnita Weingarten. Well you -- you -- you have the right to go. You have the right like your\nfather does, the same way. You are m -- but I -- you are married and you have a child, he said,\nwe Americans do not separate families. I\u20191l never forget that sentence. We will add your husband\nand your child to your quota, and in five months you can go. Three months I think he said even, I\ndon\u2019t -- you know. Well, providing that you have somebody who can sponsor you so you don\u2019t\nfall on the American government as a burden. So I came, I said, listen Dad -- he said well, we\nhave a cousin in Washington, Jake Schutzman. Write to him and see how he responds to it. So I\nwrote him a letter, and he said, anything and everything that I can do for you, I will do. And we\nended up in Washington.",

That\u2019s what it\nlooks like? I said, well I don\u2019t think all America is what you see in \u201cWest Side Story.\u201d So he was\na little hesitant, you know, he said, what am I gonna do there, and I said don\u2019t worry, whatever --\nwe'll find what to do.

And with that kind of attitude, you know,\nmy cousin Jake Schutzman started looking for him to find him a job so he can, you know, find\nhis way, and he did, you know, went in the evening, took courses in English and slowly, slowly\nprogressed.",
        "A: And he started -- actually, he worked for two companies. The first company that hired him,\nyou know, when they told him to bring a certain tool he didn\u2019t understand exactly what they\nmeant, so they he -- he brought another tool, and he didn\u2019t last there too long, they fired him, and\nhe was very devastated because he was never fired before. But that\u2019s part of, you know, you --\nyou -- you acclimate yourself that way, that\u2019s part of life. And so then he worked for another\ngentleman, in fact the gentleman was a member of Beth El and I don\u2019t know what happened\nthen, they fired him. And then I took the initiative into my own hands, opened the yellow pages,\nlooked under heating and air conditioning and that was July, and we arrived in April. May, June,\nJuly, we were three months in Washington and I just figured out I\u2019m going to cope, and I\nhappened to land on a company named Dependo. And I called up and Mr. Blom answered the\nphone, and I said, we are from Israel, we are here three months and my husband worked in this\nline in Israel, in refrigeration and so forth. He said, okay, send him in. And he went and he got\nthe job and he worked there for seven years. And after seven years he decided well, time to go on\nmy own. And since then, with another partner and they opened their own business, and then, you\nknow, sometimes partnerships does -- doesn\u2019t always work well, and after, I think, two years or\nso they separated and my husband went on his own. And sine then has been on his own and has\nhis own company.",
        "A: Yes, I have a son here in America and he was born in 1976.",
        "A: Exactly the same date like my father, April -- noth -- no, no, no, March 25\", \u201976, the\nbicentennial.",
        "A: Bicentennial baby.",
        "A: Oh, all the time, yes. I started working in 19, actually \u201963 1n a --",
        "A: As a substitute teacher at B\u2019nai Israel, at the time it was on 16\u2122 Street. And then I got a job in\nBeth El the following year on Old Georgetown Road and I worked there for, I think, seven or\neight years as a teacher, as a Hebrew teacher. And vis-a-vis I constantly studied through courses\nfrom Baltimore Hebrew College and got a degree there. And continued working -- later when we\nmoved -- we lived in Silver Spring. At first we lived in Washington, D.C. for two years and then\nwe bought a town house in Silver Spring and we lived there for seven years. And after seven\nyears we bought this house where we are in now, in Potomac. And I switched and I worked for\nHa Shalom, vis-a-vis at the -- what is today Charles E. Smith\u2019s Jewish Day School. And I sent\nmy daughter to that school. Prior to that it was called Solomon Schechter school and it was\nhoused on East West highway at Ora Kodish and in Temple Shalom it was split and -- and I\nworked there for -- since \u201969 -- 1969 at Solomon Schechter and then it became Charles E.\nSmith\u2019s Jewish Day School. And worked with Hashalom for seven, eight years, then the last 20\nyears at Washington Hebrew congregation.",
        "A: Yes --",
        "A: -- absolutely. Right.",
        "A: My thoughts are I\u2019m sure that there were good people in Germany like in a -- any other\ncountry, es-especially at -- beginning when I was younger, of course I hated anything that had to\ndo with Germany or Germans, even to a point that even when my husband says well, maybe we\nshould go to Europe and go to Germany, I said I don\u2019t feel like going there. I said I don\u2019t want to\nbuy any car that\u2019s made in -- in germa -- in -- you know, that has anything to do with the German\nmanufacturing, or anything that it was manufactured in Germany. You know, some people buy\nMercedeses and so I said no, this is not for us, and I was -- and I\u2019m still, until today, not -- you\nknow. But I don\u2019t -- you know, there\u2019s no such thing really that I hate, cause I don\u2019t know what\nto hate there, or not to like there. But I feel that anti-Semitism still exists there and -- and -- and\non the other hand, now that -- when you read, you know, it\u2019s 60 some years after the war, and\nyou read the circumstances that brought Hitler to power, and the people that would not\nnecessarily follow, or obey, or belong to the Jugenrat, or whatever it is, were immediately either\npunished or -- or -- you know, they were sentenced to death or they had -- they were not getting\nthe rations or the food. So you -- you felt that those people were, in a sense pressured for their\nown survival, in order for them to survive, so they went with him and they wouldn\u2019t oppose him,\nbecause if they would, they would lose whatever they had. So, you know, it\u2019s from -- sometimes\nyou wonder. Such a thing can happen all over again, and the question is, how would the\npopulation react? Would everybody worry just about himself or themselves and to heck with the\nrest of the world as long as I have my food and I have my job and I\u2019m not being threatened?\nThen I, you know, so what do I care about this minority, that minority, whatever min -- 1t\u2019s very\npossible that this can, you know, that this -- that this is the reaction of maybe humanity, I don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "A: Absolutely, yes. Yes, I do. I consider myself a survivor thanks to that family that took me in.\nIf not the family, I doubted whether I would survive.",
        "A: Right, yeah.",
        "A: Lam more --",
        "A: Iam more of a Reformed Jew. I am not an Orthodox Jew, because that really doesn\u2019t speak to\nme. So, I believe in what is called live and let live. And I don\u2019t think that really by being an\nOrthodox Jew and -- and -- and doing everything the way the Orthodoxy does, that this is the\nonly way. I believe that Judaism is much broader, much larger, and whether you follow exactly\nas the Torah tells you to follow, or the Talmud, that you are a better Jew than I am. I don\u2019t think\nSO.",
        "A: I keep Shabbat, I light the candles, I like the Jewish atmosphere. We celebrate the holidays.\nWhether I run to the synagogue to pray and think that the salvation will come from God? No, I\nbelieve it comes from you. And there is even a sentence in Hebrew, it says [speaks Hebrew\nhere]. And ami is I. The emphasis is first on I. Not [speaks Hebrew], but on I. And that\u2019s what I\nbelieve that is. I, or an -- every individual really is responsible for his deeds and -- and you\nknow.",
        "A: Not -- no, not necessarily Polish. And I was thinking about it and sometimes I thought maybe\na world citizen would be real nice. To be just a world citizen.",
        "A: But I feel very close to Israel, definitely I do. And I feel that Jews need to have their own\nhomeland and not be spread all over. We should -- we have to have our own homeland, and if we\nwant to live in other places in the world, that\u2019s fine, but we need to have a homeland at this\npoint. If -- which is a Utopian thought, one day borders will be broken and people will -- you\nknow, that\u2019s something far-fetched, into the long, long future. So at this point we need our\nhomeland, we need our base.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: We -- we do, every year, every other year, yes, yes. In fact, we are planning now to go in\nOctober.",
        "A: Americans.",
        "A: Americans, yes. They consider themselves Americans and they love Israel, because I have\ntaken them couple times to Israel. They have been numerous times to the land of Israel. One of\nmy granddaughter had the Bat Mitzvah. One of my granddaughter graduated Charles E. Smith\nJewish Day School and went to Israel with them, and went prior to Israel. So they feel a bond\nwith Israel, but they consider themselves American Jews.",
        "A: No, I have not.",
        "A: But I would like to. Now I would -- before I didn\u2019t have no desire whatsoever, but now I\nwould like to, and I don\u2019t know if it comes with age, or -- I\u2019d -- yeah --",
        "A: Yeah, to see -- to see what -- well, Boryslaw is not going to be the same when it was 66 years\nago, or 68 years ago, it\u2019s not the same. But I would like to see that.",
        "A: Well, because you know, my father was born there, my grandmother, my mother, I was born -\n- to see the birthplace, basically. To see what it looks like. And -- and -- and j -- you know, there\nis a picture here that I have, which I happened to enlarge, but you can see what Boryslaw looked\nlike.",
        "A: SO --",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t have that problem, no. What sometimes bothers me is the ignorance of -- of\npeople and -- and you know, it\u2019s a -- and it\u2019s natural, the ignorance of -- of -- of not knowing, or\nnot showing interest or -- or stuff like that, but I feel comfortable among those and among those,\nboth. I don\u2019t -- I have an occasionally discussions and -- and when I mention sometimes, you\nknow, a -- since I know the Jewish history well, and I know in every land where Jews lived\neventually there was a persecution of the Jewish people, and if I mention nobody knows whether\nthis is not going to happen in uni -- in America. Even though this is a free country and so forth,\nwe have no guarantee that this will not happen here. We don\u2019t know. Depends on population,\ndepends on education. Many, many factors go into it.",
        "A: No, my -- both parents passed away.",
        "A: In Israel, right, yes.",
        "A: My father did and my stepmother did, yes, they did, right. And they claimed it helped them\nquite a bit to live in Israel. That it helped them toward their older age. They did.",
        "A: Most like -- yeah, probably I would be different if my -- yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Right, yes --",
        "A: -- yes. Very possible. You -- you\u2019re referring to the fact that if my father would not have\nsurvived?",
        "A: Oh, of course would be different.",
        "A: Wa -- yes. I have a feeling yes, probably so.",
        "A: In terms of education. I don\u2019t think that if my folks would have left, before the war, let\u2019s say,\nand immigrated to America and I would have been born here, most likely they would have\nacclimated themselves to the life in America and -- and you know, when I look -- for instance, I\nwork in Washington Hebrew, so they have pictures from very early century when the synagogue\nwas built by German Jews. And you see the kids graduating and so forth and -- and every year it\nsays, this group graduated, that group graduated, \u00b041 - \u00b042 - \u201943 - \u201944. And then I think to myself,\nmy God, on the other side of the ocean, what was going on? Were they aware what was going\non? Did they do enough? See? So -- and I would probably fall in the same category.",
        "A: Probably.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Most likely.",
        "A: Probably maybe less sensitive to the whole issue of the suffering, maybe, of others. And --\nand you know what -- and -- and even today, when we hear about Darfur, or we hear -- hear\nabout others being repressed different parts of the world, you know, we say we pray for them,\nthis and that, and what are we doing? Are we changing?\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Yes, conc -- there are a lot of things that are happening that concerns me. First of all, I see\nanti-Semitism on the rise. That concerns me. I don\u2019t know whether we are doing enough to stop\nit. I\u2019m sure there are means to stop it, but we -- maybe we are ignoring it and thinking the wave\nwill go away. That concerns me a great deal. What concerns me also is that the attitude toward\nthe state of Israel, my feeling is, in United States, has changed from the time that we arrived 45\nyears ago, or 46 years ago, to what is happening today. It\u2019s not the same, it changed for the\nworse. And I don\u2019t know if this is a -- a propaganda by a lot of Muslim countries, and -- and --\nand maybe anti-Semitism was kind of, you know, hidden and begins slowly to mushroom out.\nMaybe that hatred was there and somehow it -- it -- 1t -- it was either covered up, or maybe it has\nto do with the newer generation that sees things differently than the older generation. It -- it\ncould be. What scares me that -- that what we hear today, we did not hear that 40 or 30 years\nago. Whether it\u2019s in France, whether it\u2019s in -- in -- in Sweden, whether it\u2019s in -- in -- in Norway,\nHolland.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: This -- this --",
        "A: Yes, people -- I tell you what, another thing that worries me is also the economical situation,\nbecause when economy goes down, people are looking for scapegoats and through history we\nhave seen that, that\u2019s what happens. Because the everyday person comes across -- so he comes\nacross with the shopkeeper or the owner of -- of a bank, or the owner of a mall or the owner of a\ncar dealer or whatever, and many times he finds Jewish people in this -- in these areas. And --\nand -- and the hatred begins to boil. I don\u2019t know how to tell you but I just want to give you an\nexample. I had a girl from the Philippines that came and helped me, and they were hardly here a\nyear, and her remark was -- she hardly knew anybody and her remark was, oh, all Jewish people\nare rich. And I said no, that\u2019s not true, not all Jewish people are rich. Jewish people, they are\nready to work, they are resourceful and they don\u2019t sit and wait for manna from heaven to fall.\nYou know, not all Jewish people are rich, that\u2019s wrong. But I just -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the\nperception. And what I find out with the younger generation now, scares me. The younger\ngeneration scares me.",
        "A: Lack of awareness, lack of knowledge, easy to blame. It does. And I\u2019ll give you an example.\nYesterday I heard a story of a child, and I don\u2019t want to mention names, who went to a camp\nover summer and there were -- he was put with another kid. It\u2019s -- 1t wasn\u2019t just only a Jewish\ncamp, it was a camp for Jews and everybody else. And there was another child in his bunk who\nwas not Jewish -- and we are talking about 11 year old kid, who said to the Jewish kid, he said,\nall Jews should die. Now where does an 11 year old child come with such a statement? He must\nhave heard it at home, or in the surrounding that he comes from. So the father mentioned that the\nJewish kid slugged him, gave him a beating for it, you know. And -- and it shows you that 11\nyear old kid today, you know, like -- so are we reversing? What\u2019s happening? I wish I would\nhave an answer for all that, but I really don\u2019t. But I\u2019m very sensitive to it, I guess more than\nothers.",
        "A: Because my family experienced it.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, I have been there. Depressing. Yeah, very depressing.",
        "A: Emotionally, yeah.",
        "A: Absolutely, yes, very much so. Yeah.",
        "A: For educational purposes, for the second generation, because what happened, you know,\nthings are forgotten, as the years pass by. And we know for instance that some leaders of\ncountries deny the whole idea of Holocaust, it never existed, like Ahmadinejad. And what\nbothers me very much, that those very, very ultra-Orthodox Jews side with him and say there is\nno need for the state [indecipherable] the Messiah will arrive. And I don\u2019t know how long, but if\nhe would have crawled already, he would have been here, right? So I don\u2019t know when the\nMessiah will arrive. But yeah, def-definitely there is a need.",
        "A: Oh yes. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think it\u2019s a defining [indecipherable] yes.",
        "A: Right. Yes.",
        "A: More aware of different situations. Stronger, in a sense that I don\u2019t give in so quickly. I -- I\ndon\u2019t know if it\u2019s inborn or -- or -- or whatever I -- I like to achieve. I set a goal, I go after it. I\ndon\u2019t back out or -- or feel oh, I can\u2019t do it, or whatever. I guess that\u2019s it, basically.",
        "A: I do from time to time, but not that often. I don\u2019t dwell on it. I\u2019m trying not to dwell on it,\nbecause you know, if I\u2019Il start dwelling on it and I\u2019Il become really a miserable human being and\nI don\u2019t want that. And so --",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Eichmann trial we were here already, in United States.",
        "A: Yes. I -- you know what I mem -- now that you brought it up, I remember looking at him\nsitting in that glass booth, he looked to me like a nebbish nothing. And yet, I thought to myself,\none human being like that, look much harm he did. And -- and -- and -- and what kind of -- you\nknow some -- I -- what kind of thoughts he had when he did what he did? What kind of feeling\nor attitude, or did he have any pity, or -- for others? No, you didn\u2019t see that. I don\u2019t know, I just -\n- you know. I didn\u2019t even feel such hatred toward him because he looked so nebbish to me, you\nknow? But then, when you think about it, were those people in those position emotionally\n[indecipherable] people, when you think about it, that they needed that boost, for being so\nimportant and having this power in their hands that their heads were totally -- I don\u2019t know, the\nbrain was totally screwed up that they could do that to others? How could you explain it?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Yes, it was.",
        "A: But 1 -- you know, I used to tell them that, but I didn\u2019t want them, especially my daughter\nwhen she was young, you know, to feel, you know, to feel constant sorrow or -- or -- or seeing\nher mother being depressed, or what. So I really didn\u2019t -- I did and did not put such emphasis\nwhen she was younger. But she heard the stories ha -- you know, my childhood, she knew about\nthat, yeah, and my growing up and so forth. So they know it and my grandchildren as well. They\nwere very fascinated. They always used to come when they were younger, and Grandma tell us,\nso what did you do and -- and do you remember, did you have friends? You know, the little\nthings that little children ask.",
        "A: Things like that. And you know, they -- th-they know that I\u2019m a survivor. They know that I\nam a child that survived the war.",
        "A: I was at the beginning. There wa -- I remember they started it here in Washington some time,\nbut then I did not pursue because I worked in the evenings and I couldn\u2019t always attend to the\nmeetings and --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, absolutely, yeah. Ye -- I would like to see that birthplace of mine, and also see\nwhat kept my father not wanting to leave Boryslaw or -- or Poland at all. And -- and sometimes I\nwonder, was it fear? Because I did the opposite of him. I was 20 -- not quite 23 - 24 when I came\nto United States, 23 and my husband was 26, with a child, and I was not afraid of changing,\ntrying something new. I don\u2019t know, maybe I was stupid, that -- that I have no clue. Young. But I\nwas not afraid, I always thought, you know what? We\u2019ll make it. Not -- things will be okay. And\nalways had this positive feeling of self assurance or whatever it is. And -- and I wasn't afraid.",
        "A: In Israel --",
        "A: -- yes, yes, she 1s.",
        "A: Oh yeah, she came couple times to visit me here, absolutely and we go and visit there, right.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Because they wouldn\u2019t bring up that subject and whenever I started asking -- and also keep in\nmind that I came in \u201963 to United States.",
        "A: So that was really not a subject that they wanted to talk about because they themselves,\nespecially my father, used to get very emotional about it. And so not to aggravate him, or cause -",
        "A: The war and his life and everything that took place and you know, the whole thing, so it used\nto bring him, apparently memories that he didn\u2019t want to deal with. So not really, not much.",
        "A: Yes, they did, they came couple times here, and we tried to talk about it and -- you know.",
        "A: No, no, no, they were too old to do that. And you know, they were settled in their ways\nalready in Israel and in their lifestyle and so forth. But I have a feeling that my father regretted\nthe fact that he didn't move to United States when he was younger. When he came over and he\nsaw, you know and -- for the first time America so to speak and I had a feeling. He didn\u2019t --\nnever verbalized it, but I sensed that he regretted the fact that he didn\u2019t have the opportunity to\nmake it in a younger age.",
        "A: Not -- not when he was 60 something, you know.",
        "A: But learning another language, as it was, he had difficulties learning Hebrew, so English, and",
        "A: They did, but they still continued communicating either in German or Polish, yeah. Right.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, special to them, I hope that they will be able to listen to the tape and go and visit the\nmuseum and -- and study and -- and learn and you know, they are young, but they -- eventually\nas they get older, I\u2019m sure they will, you know. A certain maturity comes with age. So that\u2019s\nwhat I would like to see, that they should study, be aware of their surroundings and also be\naware of anti-Semitism. That\u2019s what I would like to make sure that they do.",
        "A: You know, what I find out 1s that -- well, maybe now there is a more a-awakening among the\nJewish population toward the Holocaust and so forth, because I remember that some families\nwere saying no, don\u2019t teach it to our children. We don\u2019t want them to hear those terrible things,\nyou know, that happened. They\u2019re too young, they\u2019re too this. You know, like not experiencing\nit, or -- or even through stories and so forth. It\u2019s too sad. That\u2019s an -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a\ngood idea.",
