        "Answer: I was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut in 1923. What else do you want to\nknow?",
        "Q: Your family name.",
        "A: Oh, my family name was Hannan, H-a-n-n-a-n.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, and tell me a little bit about your parents and you know, what it was like --\nwhat -- you know, what your life was like in Bridgeport.",
        "A: Oh, my father owned a lumber yard in Bridgeport and my mother was just a\nhousewife and we had five children. We owned our own home and went to school\nthere until I graduated from high school and went in training.",
        "Q: What year did you graduate from high school?",
        "A: This -- I -- I -- from -- 1940, then I went in training. I graduated in June and then I\nwent in training in September in Saint Vincent\u2019s in New York City.",
        "Q: And why did you decide to go into nurse\u2019s training?\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: Well, my aunt was a nurse, she worked down Doctor\u2019s Hospital in New York and\nshe always liked it and she had been a nurse in the first World War and -- just figured\nthat it was something I wanted to do. I enjoy helping -- working with people and --",
        "Q: Had she told you stories about being a nurse --",
        "A: She had, yeah.",
        "Q: -- in the war?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, she did. In fact, she married -- while she was in the war, she married a\ndoctor and she had a really nice life and she traveled a great deal and she wou -- then,\nafter she came out -- well, I guess she had -- after she was divorced, she worked as a --\nin charge of the operating room at Doctor\u2019s Hospital in New York and so I decided to\ngo into Saint Vincent\u2019s for training.",
        "Q: And when did you get out?",
        "A: 1943. And I -- shortly after that -- well, most of the girls were going in the service\nand -- [inaudible] I went, I wanted -- my best friend was going into the army nurse\ncorps, but I didn\u2019t -- flight -- flight nurse. I didn\u2019t particularly care for that, so I just\nwent into the -- the army nurse corps.",
        "Q: Do you think most of the people in your -- that graduated from nurse\u2019s training\nwith you, went into the service, was that your impression?",
        "A: I think -- I think most of them did. Not -- not all, some of them were getting\nmarried, some of them were -- wanted to stay and work at -- you know, stateside, but I\nJuly 15, 1998\nwould say the majority of us went into the service, either the navy or the army nurse\ncorps.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. It\u2019s so -- did it s -- fe -- it felt like sort of the thing to do? A lot of people -",
        "A: It did.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, everybody was going there at the time. Well, I can remember working on\none of the wa -- halls and they came and said when -- that the Japanese had attacked\nPearl Harbor and we all thought that was such a shocking thing, that you know, they\n-- here these boys were taken so completely unawares and decided that this would be\nthe type of the thing we would like to do, you know, go in and help take care of them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: And -- and you enlisted then, in \u201843 did you say?",
        "A: 43.",
        "Q: Where at? Where did you go in?",
        "A: I was inducted in Fort Dix, New Jersey and then we went to Atlantic City for our\nbasic training. I can\u2019t remember where I went. I stayed at Fort Dix for quite awhile,\nuntil we got our or -- oh yes, I guess I stayed there until we got our orders to go with\nthe 131st evacuation hospital.\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "Q: And what was the basic training like?",
        "A: Oh, I remember long marches along the streets in Atlantic City. It was a nice place\nto take your basic training. Climbing under fences and practicing with your gas masks\nand ex -- a lot of exercises and -- and the social life there in the evening was -- was\ngood. We like the different -- like Glenn Miller was there. In fact we saw him the first\n-- the last time he played in the States and he flew from there to England and his plane\nwas lost. But the basic training, you know, was very strenuous and concentrated. And\nright from there, I forget where I went then. I remember staying there for quite awhile.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And then you got orders to join the 13 1st?",
        "A: 13 1st, yeah.",
        "Q: And -- and then what happened? Where did you go or what was the --\n[indecipherable] the next major thing that you remember?",
        "A: I remember getting on the ship, the Queen Elizabeth, that -- we were all surprised\nthat we were going to go over on that. And that was a very hairy ride, with the mines\nand whatnot in the water that time. And we ended up in Greenock, Scotland. And\nthat\u2019s where -- I was saying downstairs -- excuse me -- the Salvation Army was there\nto greet us with coffee and donuts. And then we went on from there to Alteringham,\nEngland and we were living in a private home wh-when -- all I can remember it was\nfreezing. They only heated the house with fireplace -- didn\u2019t keep you very warm. But\nwe rented bikes and we rode around the countryside and then we were as-assigned to a\nJuly 15, 1998\ngeneral hospital, I can\u2019t remember the number of the general hospital and we worked\nthere with the boys that were being brought back from Europe.",
        "Q: This was the winter of \u00b045 -- \u201845, right?",
        "A: *45, right, yeah, yeah. I remember going to Christmas eve mass and it was so\nfoggy, we had to hang onto one another walking down the street and you couldn\u2019t see\nin front of you. And from there we got our orders to go -- to get the h-hospital -- to get\n-- we -- a lot of -- I guess some of the girls went to different hospitals, I\u2019m not sure\nabout that, though.",
        "Q: In England, you mean?",
        "A: In England, yeah. General hospitals.",
        "Q: But they -- but you were just taking care of GI\u2019s -- American GI\u2019s?",
        "A: GI\u2019s, oh yeah, just American GIs, yes. In fact I met a boy I knew from home, from\nBridgeport. He -- I had him as a patient. He had been injured at Anzio. And -- fact I\nsaw him several times after we got out of the service, exchanged experiences. And\nthen we got -- the hospital unit got together again and we went over the chelver into\nSudan, France, as I remember and we set up our tents and all named -- heh -- gave\nthem all different names. I think I lived in Fools Rush In. And some -- Idiot\u2019s Delight\nwas one, or something. And --",
        "Q: What was it like living in a tent? This was in the spring, now?",
        "A: This was in the spring, yes.\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "Q: April? March, April?",
        "A: I guess. Must have been, cause I know we were in England in Christmastime and\nthen -- yeah, it must have been early spring. It was fun. We had -- we slept on cots and\nwe had air mattresses, and so it was fairly comfortable. The only thing was the\nshowering and bathing and all, that was rather difficult, but then we started to get\npatients there to take care of, they were bringing some back from the front and we got\nour first experience there of actually being an evacuation hospital.",
        "Q: And how was that different from what you\u2019d done before?",
        "A: Oh, oh it was quite different, because you were all set up in tents, you know and it\nwas -- well, you know, it -- it -- the -- the general hospital in -- in England, I think that\nmust have been a regular hospital that they had taken over and they had all the\nfacilities, whereas out in the field, you -- you know -- you didn\u2019t -- you just had\ntemporary, makeshift things, but it didn\u2019t seem as though we were there too long. As I\nsaid, I can\u2019t remember all this.",
        "Q: How was it -- that was the first time you had -- were caring then, for --",
        "A: For actual casualties that were coming in from the war front, yes.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: Well, it was very challenging. You could hear -- in fact, from where we were you\ncould hear the bombs and hear shooting and stuff.",
        "Q: Were you frightened?\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: Not -- not really. No, no. We knew we weren\u2019t right up on the front line, we were\nfar enough back, that -- and --",
        "Q: Did you talk to the injured men?",
        "A: Oh yes, yeah. Oh, yeah, I talked to them.",
        "Q: What did they want to talk about?",
        "A: Most of them wanted to talk about their girls back home and how homesick they\nwere and couldn\u2019t wait til they got back and if they weren\u2019t injured very much, they\nsaid, \u201cOh, this means I\u2019ve got to go back into the war -- fighting again,\u201d you know,\nand I -- but others that were being -- that\u2019s -- if they were more seriously wounded,\nwere shipped back to England and then they vess eventually they went home or were\ntaken care of there. And I think it was there that we got word that one of our nurse\u2019s\nhusban -- it was at -- yes, it was at the Battle of the Bulge and her husband was lost\nand reported as either dead or a prisoner of war and then as we went along -- can\u2019t\nremember where we were, Mike showed up. And that was exciting, you know, that he\nwas actually a -- a prisoner, taken a prisoner and a colonel friend set them up in a\nhouse and they were able to be together there. Then we moved on -- oh, we had to get\nour Eisenhower jackets or something, so we all piled in the big truck and went into --",
        "Q: What were those?",
        "A: They were those short jackets that -- they named them after Eisenhower because I\nbelieve he wore them. And we didn\u2019t have them to -- to go on further, so we drove into\nJuly 15, 1998\nBelgium and oh, those people were just so happy to see the Americans, they were so\nfriendly. And --",
        "Q: Why did you have to get those jackets?",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- I guess it was accepted ca -- to wear in the battle areas, or something. I\ndon\u2019t remember, but I know we were told we had to go up there, so we got in big\ntrucks and went along and were singing the army songs as we went up to pick them\nup. And then shortly after that we must have moved out and I --remember exactly\nwhere we went from there.",
        "Q: Wha -- When you were there -- this was in Germany\u201d",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What -- What was your particular responsibility? What -- what was your job? Were\nyou in a ward or an operating room, or --",
        "A: N-No, no, I was in a ward, yeah.",
        "Q: Caring --",
        "A: Dispensing medication and dressings and yeah [indecipherable]",
        "Q: These were men who\u2019d been operated on, some of them?",
        "A: Some of them had been operated on, yeah, some of them had -- you know, a broken\nleg and some shrapnel wounds and -- helped to take care of them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And then you stayed there for awhile and then moved? You moved a lot?\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: We moved quite often and I can\u2019t remember all the different places we moved.\nCan\u2019t even remember where we -- I should have read my thing I have at home. I didn\u2019t\nre -- expect to have to tell it.",
        "A: But you did -- you did move around?",
        "Q: We moved around quite a bit, yeah and finally we got -- we went into Austria and\nthat was just gorgeous. We lived in regular homes in Austria and they -- right through\n-- it was near vee -- it was near Linz, Austria. And it was across from ver -- Vienna\nand very often at night, the Russians would be shooting out the lights and shooting at\nthe wires and the -- your electricity would go out. They had maids who came and they\npolished your shoes and did different things for you while you were there. These were,\nI guess, local Austrian girls. And then we had to go to -- the only thing I can remember\nis go -- they told us we were going to a concentration camp. And the one thing that I\ncan remember most about that was for miles before we got there, was the smell -- the\ndead bodies rotting, oh. That was just -- it was hard to believe. And when we would\nget there, you just see the bodies all piled up, you know and then they eventually\nwould dig trenches, they would just -- they couldn\u2019t make coffins for them fast enough\nand dug -- put them in common graves. And we went in and they were -- most of those\npeople that were not dead, that were s -- who they had -- most of them, they had\npracticed on. They practiced taking out an appendix or practiced removing an arm or a\nleg and these people needed to be nursed back, you know. And you al -- you couldn\u2019t\nJuly 15, 1998\nspeak their language, but you could almost feel that they knew what you were saying\nand you -- course, sort of knew what they were saying, they were just so glad to see\nsomebody come in. Their food was so terrible and most of them looked like skeletons.\nI have pictures of them. And --",
        "Q: What was your work -- daily work there?",
        "A: Mostly just taking care of these patients, a lot of them of course, they had had\noperations and they were left in -- had -- all infected and you had to take care of those\nand put clean dressings on and try it on some of them that -- help with the therapy, to\nhelp them to get walking. They were ba -- they put them -- like if they had taken a leg\noff or something, then they would be walking on crutches and you would be helping\nthem with that, and --",
        "Q: What was the place where you worked, and what was --",
        "A: It was a tent. Most of these patients were all like in tents or shacks, if I remember.\nI\u2019m not sure which -- what it was. It wasn\u2019t -- 1t was nothing, you know, like -- it\ndidn\u2019t look like a hospital at all, excepting that there were rows of beds where the\npatients were in. A lot of them had casts on as I remember and they wanted you to sign\nit for them.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t set up your hospital -- tent hospital there, you worked 1n their --\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: Well, I think our -- our men had gone ahead and I think they had set up some of\nthis, because by the time we got there, they were -- the area where we were going to be\nworking was set up.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah. Cause they went on ahead of us, now that I think of it and I -- unless they -- I\ndon\u2019t think that they were -- had any type of hospital set up before they got in there,\nbut -- but they might have, I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: So you worked with people? Others have told me that they never touched patients\nor they were not supposed to touch patients, but 1t sounds like you were changing\ndressings and --",
        "A: Oh yes, you were changing dressings and helping them to wa -- and then you\u2019d\ntake them outside and have them walk and get out in the fresh air, cause most of them\nhadn\u2019t seen daylight or sunlight and all they gave them was bread and water and -- to\neat. And I loved the bread, it was that dark bread that they get overseas. But I mean,\nnot -- not any nourishing food, they hadn\u2019t had. And --",
        "Q: Were they men or women or both, or --",
        "A: They were both. They were both, but mostly men. The majority I -- as I recall, were\nmen. But they -- there were some women there, too, yeah. I didn\u2019t see any children.\nThere might have been, but I don\u2019t remember seeing them.",
        "Q: Did you -- do you remember caring for women as well as men?\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t remember having women patients. I remember just having male\npatients, as -- now that I think about it.",
        "Q: And do you know -- d-did you know then who they were or where they were from,\nor --",
        "A: No. You knew where -- they -- they would tell you where they were from, yes, they\nwould tell you where they were from, but --",
        "Q: Did you know at that time whether or not they were Jewish people or not?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t, no. Some of them would -- you knew -- they said they were, but most\nof them you would just t-try to get out from where they came from. A lot of them\nseemed to be -- come from Poland and -- it was hard to understand them, but you --\nyo-you know, you tried to decipher as much as you could.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did they try and express to you anything at all -- some of them?",
        "A: They tried constantly to express their gratitude, you know, for what we were doing\nfor them, they -- and hope that they would get that -- w -- you know, well and be able\nto go back home again, if there was any home to go to, [indecipherable] often said\nthat. They didn\u2019t know what the conditions were going to be like back home.",
        "Q: Were you able to do much for them over the period of time you were there?",
        "A: I think that they -- a lot of them I -- we thought -- felt were improving and were\nputting weight back on and -- especially I can remember one young man on crutches\nand then he seemed to be able to wa -- go to a cane and could walk with a cane and did\nJuly 15, 1998\nget help. Course a lot of -- I guess they just kept them in a bed, or in -- I don\u2019t know\nwhere they kept them and -- so that they didn\u2019t get up and were able to really move\naround until we had gotten in there, I guess.",
        "Q: Do you have any 1-idea of what else was going on there while you were there? I\nmean, was there continuing to bury bodies while you were there? That was going on?",
        "A: Well, we s -- oh yes, they were continually burying the bodies, yeah, yeah. They --\na lot of them died while we were there, too, but they also were burying the bodies that\nwere piled up when we got there. And when they could then eventually they had a\ncemetery and they would put, you know, little markers on each one. But at first 1t was\njust a communal grave where they had to put the bodies. And there was the\ncrematorium that they used to burn them and gas them. They had that and they burned\nthat down while we were there to prevent the spread of disease, I guess.",
        "Q: You saw that?",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: What did you think when you saw that, did you --",
        "A: Couldn\u2019t believe it. And what upset me the most was you would see these reels\nfrom home and people said, \u201cThat\u2019s not true, that\u2019s all propaganda.\u201d",
        "Q: What do you mean reels?\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: They said they were army -- my parents would write, you know, they were army\nreels and that would say that it was all propaganda, that these things didn\u2019t happen. In\nthe movie theaters, apparently [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Oh, newsreels?",
        "A: Newsreels, yes, yes. They must have shown them and I said, \u201cWell then, let them\ncome over here and see it.\u201d And because, it -- even today you\u2019ll hear people say that\nthey don\u2019t believe it existed and it certainly did.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: When you were seeing that, did you have any sense of -- of how widespread it was\nin Europe?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you --",
        "A: No, we really didn\u2019t at that time, no, til we then heard about so many of the other\nconcentration camps and all. They were much bigger than camp Gusen. I guess\nMauthausen and some of them were much larger and had a lot more, you know,\nprisoners than we did, but at that time we had no idea of that, no.",
        "Q: Were -- did you have any sense of how the people in the town were reacting to\nthis? Did you have any contact with people in the -- in -- in Linz?\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: Not really, not really, no. Just the girl -- th -- some of the women that would work -\n- work at the camp that were -- you know, lived in the village, but they didn\u2019t say very\nmuch, and -- of course there was a language barrier. Couldn\u2019t really understand them\nall.",
        "Q: Do you remember people coming to Gusen from the town to -- to do work or --",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember -- not at the -- no, not with the patients they weren\u2019t, no. Not that\nI remember. They could have, but I really don\u2019t remember that.",
        "Q: Did you have any other s -- did you have any sense of -- of what kinds of things the\npeople were doing and when they were inmates there? Were they --",
        "A: Don\u2019t think --",
        "Q: -- do you know about the -- I mean, for example, I know there was a quarry nearby\nwhere people had to carry stones.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I do remember hearing --",
        "Q: Did you see that, or --",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember seeing that, but I do remember hearing about it, yeah. They had --\nthey -- they di -- I know they were tru -- cruelly mistreated because they also had a --\nthe commandant hung in effigy. I guess the prisoners that were there and they finally\nhad gotten home, I have a picture of him hanging there and was something else I had -\n- just [indecipherable] skipped my mind. Oh, taking their skin and making\nlampshades out of it.\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "Q: You heard about that or you saw that?",
        "A: Oh yeah -- no, I heard about that, but I did see one of the lampshades and they said\nit was made from the skin of the patients that were there. This was the commandant --\ncommandant\u2019s wife or somebody made -- was supposed to have made these.",
        "Q: Where did you see that lampshade?",
        "A: There, there.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were all of the -- all of the survivors who were there ill or were s-some people able\nto go around and --",
        "A: Some of them were able to go around and do some of the -- the work, you know,\ncleaning up and yeah, they weren\u2019t a -- they were functional, yeah, they weren\u2019t all,\nyou know, like bedridden people or that had things wrong with them, no. That -- wa --\nthat\u2019s where we were supposed to, you know, do most of our -- was with the sick ones,\nbut there were others walking around and -- all looked like skeletons, though.",
        "Q: How long were you there at Gusen, roughly?",
        "A: Seems like we were there about three months or so, but I\u2019m not -- I really can\u2019t\nremember. I have all those things written down at home [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And then after that?\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: From there, can\u2019t remember where we went. We went to a camp, but I can\u2019t\nremember where -- cause I remember being there on VE Day and celebrating --",
        "Q: VE Day?",
        "A: -- the victory. Yeah.",
        "Q: VE Day before you went to Gusen.",
        "A: Well, that was before, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. No, that\u2019s right, yes, yes [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Other people have mentioned a camp called -- it\u2019s named after a cigarette -- in\nFrance.",
        "A: Twen --",
        "Q: 20 grand?",
        "A: 20 grand, yes, yes, right.",
        "Q: Is that the one you\u2019re thinking of?",
        "A: 20 grand, yes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking of.",
        "Q: In France?",
        "A: In France, yeah.",
        "Q: And you were --",
        "A: And from there we learned we were going home -- to go to the Pacific. And some\nof them that were -- we were -- there were several ho-hospitals there and a lot of them\nJuly 15, 1998\nwere going directly to the Pacific, but we were supposed to go home -- wi -- go home\non leave and we went home on the General Bliss as I remember and were home on\nleave when they dropped the bomb on Hiroshima. And then I was shipped out to --\nwhere was it, 1t was where they have the racetress -- racetracks out -- hm, we used to\ngo to the races once in a while, that -- Bonnie -- did you interview Bonnie?",
        "Q: Not yet.",

        "Q: It wasn\u2019t Texas, was it?",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t Texas. Gee, I know it as well as I know my own name, but my\nmemory\u2019s getting very bad.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t go -- at any rate, you didn\u2019t go --",
        "A: We did not go to the Pacific and then was discharged from there. And I got on an\narmy plane and flew out to California to visit my sister and that was it.",
        "Q: So you were in for what, about a year?",
        "A: N -- About 18 months I\u2019d say, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And I wanted to go back and ask you what you thought when the\nbomb was dropped on Hiroshima.",
        "A: I was very, very happy to think that it would save so many lives instead of, you\nknow, continuing this horrible war and I wasn\u2019t anxious to go to the Pacific myself,\nbeing selfish, but I was so glad for the boys that didn\u2019t have to, you know, lose their\nJuly 15, 1998\nlives fighting over there. Yeah, I know I thought that it was a very, very wise decision\nat the time.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: When you look back now, 50 years later on that year, and especially on that\nexperience you had, witnessing what had happened at the concentration camp, what\ndoes it mean to you? What -- how -- how has is affected you?",
        "A: Well, it was an experience that I would never have wanted to miss. I felt that, you\nknow, we did a lot of good and got a lot out of it my-myself, I enjoyed it and I\u2019d do it\nagain if -- if the opportunity had come, you know, if I was to go into the service. Not\nnow, but, you know -- but I really thought it was a very rewarding experience. Patients\nwere all so very happy you know, were glad to see you and you felt that -- as I said,\nyou felt you were doing something. I felt I was doing more there than I would have\nbeen if I went to work in a -- a hospital or -- here in the States or, you know, into one\nof the -- couple of my friends went into the -- like Sikorsky\u2019s and different places,\nworked as industrial nurses, but I thought being an army nurse was the best.",
        "Q: And th-the experience you had, especially at Gusen, how do you think of that, how\ndoes -- what -- what did you learn from that?",
        "A: Well, I -- hopefully I learned that -- that this would never, ever happen again. And I\nhave often -- I\u2019ve spoken to some groups and -- to let them know that it really did\nJuly 15, 1998\nhappen and I had sent the pictures to school and my children, you know, have brought\nit up when they\u2019ve been in school and studied it. And gone into school occasionally\nand talked to some of the classes, because so many of the people still felt that it was --\nit was just a lie, that it never had o -- had occurred and so I felt it was important to let\nthem know that it did. And racial discrimination and whatnot certainly shouldn\u2019t be a\npart of our lives.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Learned that.",
        "Q: What else? I -- I -- I know we just kind of did a brief review, but what did -- is there\nanything you\u2019d like to say, or any particular memory that you want to --",
        "A: No, not really. As I said, a lot of it I just can\u2019t even remember any more.",
        "Q: It seems -- it\u2019s so interesting to me that 50 years later, this group of women is still\nin touch with each other.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we have kept up. We have a round robin and then we\u2019ve gotten\ntogether, you know, for reunions, but -- well, in my training school is the same thing,\nwe -- we\u2019ve gotten -- every five years we go to New York City and get together and\nhave a reunion. It\u2019s nice to keep -- we have so much in common. I think this is, you\nknow, what keeps -- keeps us coming and getting together.",
        "Q: You ha -- is it just what you did then that you have in common?\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: No, I think living for that length of time together and living under not very good\nconditions, you know, you just sort of got much closer to the girls than you normally\nwould, you know, if you were in the every day world. You slept together, you wash\ntogether, you eat together and you were -- had a common purpose.",

And then we had to go to -- the only thing I can remember\nis go -- they told us we were going to a concentration camp. And the one thing that I\ncan remember most about that was for miles before we got there, was the smell -- the\ndead bodies rotting, oh. That was just -- it was hard to believe. And when we would\nget there, you just see the bodies all piled up, you know and then they eventually\nwould dig trenches, they would just -- they couldn\u2019t make coffins for them fast enough\nand dug -- put them in common graves. And we went in and they were -- most of those\npeople that were not dead, that were s -- who they had -- most of them, they had\npracticed on.

We like the different -- like Glenn Miller was there. In fact we saw him the first\n-- the last time he played in the States and he flew from there to England and his plane\nwas lost.

And I think it was there that we got word that one of our nurse\u2019s\nhusban -- it was at -- yes, it was at the Battle of the Bulge and her husband was lost\nand reported as either dead or a prisoner of war and then as we went along -- can\u2019t\nremember where we were, Mike showed up. And that was exciting, you know, that he\nwas actually a -- a prisoner, taken a prisoner and a colonel friend set them up in a\nhouse and they were able to be together there. Then we moved on -- oh, we had to get\nour Eisenhower jackets or something, so we all piled in the big truck and went into --",
        "A: They were those short jackets that -- they named them after Eisenhower because I\nbelieve he wore them.

Their food was so terrible and most of them looked like skeletons.\nI have pictures of them. And --",

        "A: They tried constantly to express their gratitude, you know, for what we were doing\nfor them, they -- and hope that they would get that -- w -- you know, well and be able\nto go back home again, if there was any home to go to, [indecipherable] often said\nthat. They didn\u2019t know what the conditions were going to be like back home.",
        "A: I think that they -- a lot of them I -- we thought -- felt were improving and were\nputting weight back on and -- especially I can remember one young man on crutches\nand then he seemed to be able to wa -- go to a cane and could walk with a cane and did\nJuly 15, 1998\nget help. Course a lot of -- I guess they just kept them in a bed, or in -- I don\u2019t know\nwhere they kept them and -- so that they didn\u2019t get up and were able to really move\naround until we had gotten in there, I guess.",
        "A: Well, we s -- oh yes, they were continually burying the bodies, yeah, yeah. They --\na lot of them died while we were there, too, but they also were burying the bodies that\nwere piled up when we got there. And when they could then eventually they had a\ncemetery and they would put, you know, little markers on each one. But at first 1t was\njust a communal grave where they had to put the bodies. And there was the\ncrematorium that they used to burn them and gas them. They had that and they burned\nthat down while we were there to prevent the spread of disease, I guess.",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Couldn\u2019t believe it. And what upset me the most was you would see these reels\nfrom home and people said, \u201cThat\u2019s not true, that\u2019s all propaganda.\u201d\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: They said they were army -- my parents would write, you know, they were army\nreels and that would say that it was all propaganda, that these things didn\u2019t happen. In\nthe movie theaters, apparently [indecipherable]",
        "A: Newsreels, yes, yes. They must have shown them and I said, \u201cWell then, let them\ncome over here and see it.\u201d And because, it -- even today you\u2019ll hear people say that\nthey don\u2019t believe it existed and it certainly did.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, we really didn\u2019t at that time, no, til we then heard about so many of the other\nconcentration camps and all. They were much bigger than camp Gusen. I guess\nMauthausen and some of them were much larger and had a lot more, you know,\nprisoners than we did, but at that time we had no idea of that, no.\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: Not really, not really, no. Just the girl -- th -- some of the women that would work -\n- work at the camp that were -- you know, lived in the village, but they didn\u2019t say very\nmuch, and -- of course there was a language barrier. Couldn\u2019t really understand them\nall.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember -- not at the -- no, not with the patients they weren\u2019t, no. Not that\nI remember. They could have, but I really don\u2019t remember that.",
        "A: Don\u2019t think --",
        "A: Yes, yes, I do remember hearing --",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember seeing that, but I do remember hearing about it, yeah. They had --\nthey -- they di -- I know they were tru -- cruelly mistreated because they also had a --\nthe commandant hung in effigy. I guess the prisoners that were there and they finally\nhad gotten home, I have a picture of him hanging there and was something else I had -\n- just [indecipherable] skipped my mind. Oh, taking their skin and making\nlampshades out of it.\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: Oh yeah -- no, I heard about that, but I did see one of the lampshades and they said\nit was made from the skin of the patients that were there. This was the commandant --\ncommandant\u2019s wife or somebody made -- was supposed to have made these.",
        "A: There, there.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Some of them were able to go around and do some of the -- the work, you know,\ncleaning up and yeah, they weren\u2019t a -- they were functional, yeah, they weren\u2019t all,\nyou know, like bedridden people or that had things wrong with them, no. That -- wa --\nthat\u2019s where we were supposed to, you know, do most of our -- was with the sick ones,\nbut there were others walking around and -- all looked like skeletons, though.",
        "A: Seems like we were there about three months or so, but I\u2019m not -- I really can\u2019t\nremember. I have all those things written down at home [indecipherable]\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: From there, can\u2019t remember where we went. We went to a camp, but I can\u2019t\nremember where -- cause I remember being there on VE Day and celebrating --",
        "A: -- the victory. Yeah.",
        "A: Well, that was before, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. No, that\u2019s right, yes, yes [indecipherable]",
        "A: Twen --",
        "A: 20 grand, yes, yes, right.",
        "A: 20 grand, yes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking of.",
        "A: In France, yeah.",
        "A: And from there we learned we were going home -- to go to the Pacific. And some\nof them that were -- we were -- there were several ho-hospitals there and a lot of them\nJuly 15, 1998\nwere going directly to the Pacific, but we were supposed to go home -- wi -- go home\non leave and we went home on the General Bliss as I remember and were home on\nleave when they dropped the bomb on Hiroshima. And then I was shipped out to --\nwhere was it, 1t was where they have the racetress -- racetracks out -- hm, we used to\ngo to the races once in a while, that -- Bonnie -- did you interview Bonnie?",
        "A: Oh. She and I were roommates there.",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t Texas. Gee, I know it as well as I know my own name, but my\nmemory\u2019s getting very bad.",
        "A: We did not go to the Pacific and then was discharged from there. And I got on an\narmy plane and flew out to California to visit my sister and that was it.",
        "A: N -- About 18 months I\u2019d say, yeah.",
        "A: I was very, very happy to think that it would save so many lives instead of, you\nknow, continuing this horrible war and I wasn\u2019t anxious to go to the Pacific myself,\nbeing selfish, but I was so glad for the boys that didn\u2019t have to, you know, lose their\nJuly 15, 1998\nlives fighting over there. Yeah, I know I thought that it was a very, very wise decision\nat the time.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, it was an experience that I would never have wanted to miss. I felt that, you\nknow, we did a lot of good and got a lot out of it my-myself, I enjoyed it and I\u2019d do it\nagain if -- if the opportunity had come, you know, if I was to go into the service. Not\nnow, but, you know -- but I really thought it was a very rewarding experience. Patients\nwere all so very happy you know, were glad to see you and you felt that -- as I said,\nyou felt you were doing something. I felt I was doing more there than I would have\nbeen if I went to work in a -- a hospital or -- here in the States or, you know, into one\nof the -- couple of my friends went into the -- like Sikorsky\u2019s and different places,\nworked as industrial nurses, but I thought being an army nurse was the best.",
        "A: Well, I -- hopefully I learned that -- that this would never, ever happen again. And I\nhave often -- I\u2019ve spoken to some groups and -- to let them know that it really did\nJuly 15, 1998\nhappen and I had sent the pictures to school and my children, you know, have brought\nit up when they\u2019ve been in school and studied it. And gone into school occasionally\nand talked to some of the classes, because so many of the people still felt that it was --\nit was just a lie, that it never had o -- had occurred and so I felt it was important to let\nthem know that it did. And racial discrimination and whatnot certainly shouldn\u2019t be a\npart of our lives.",
        "A: Learned that.",
        "A: No, not really. As I said, a lot of it I just can\u2019t even remember any more.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we have kept up. We have a round robin and then we\u2019ve gotten\ntogether, you know, for reunions, but -- well, in my training school is the same thing,\nwe -- we\u2019ve gotten -- every five years we go to New York City and get together and\nhave a reunion. It\u2019s nice to keep -- we have so much in common. I think this is, you\nknow, what keeps -- keeps us coming and getting together.\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: No, I think living for that length of time together and living under not very good\nconditions, you know, you just sort of got much closer to the girls than you normally\nwould, you know, if you were in the every day world. You slept together, you wash\ntogether, you eat together and you were -- had a common purpose.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nConclusion of Interview\n"
