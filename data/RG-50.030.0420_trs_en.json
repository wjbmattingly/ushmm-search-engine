        "Question: Your Majesty, I would like to thank you for agreeing to share with us your\nrecollections of a very complicated period in your life, and critical period in Romanian history.\nBefore we begin, for the camera, could you please tell us your name, when you were born and\nwhere you were born?",
        "Answer: Now, this thing of the name 1s something which is very confusing to very many people.\nMy name is Michael, as you know, but this -- I don\u2019t want to make too many explanations, but\nanyhow just tell you how things are. Of course, our family comes from Germany from\nSigmaringen, become the first -- the first king of Romania was a Hohenzollern, like my\ngrandfather. But that ended with my grandfather. So we, in fact, do not have a family name in\nRomania. The family name of Hohenzollern is the origin, but that does not figure in any\ndocument or [indecipherable]. So that\u2019s why I said it\u2019s a bit confusing. So, the result 1s that we\nare called by our name and then add, of Romania. So that\u2019s how things are now. I was born on\nthe 25\" of October, 1921, in Sinaia in a house which unfortunately doesn\u2019t exist any more\nbecause the o-original one burnt down, and it was rebuilt in 1954 - \u201956, the modern one. So that\u2019s\nabout all for the introduction.",
        "Q: Thank you, thank you. Your majesty, King Carol returned to Romania in 1930. You were\nnine years old. As I understand it, he took charge of your education and upbringing at that time.\nCan you talk with us about your relationship with your father in those years, and about the\neducation that he organized for you?",
        "A: Well, two things here. One was my personal feelings and personal relationship with him, and\nthe second part was aj -- was about the schooling. My personal relationship with him, to put it\nquite frankly, was not all the very best. I don\u2019t know how many people in United States and other\ncountries are quite aware of what went on at that period. I don\u2019t want to say too strongly, but his\nprivate life is the one that -- that other people know more about. As you know, probably, that he\nhad a connection with a certain person. As far as I could recollect what I was told, that started\nwhen I was about two years old. And in the 20\u2019s he left Romania and renounced his rights to the\nfamily and to the throne and to everything concerning Romania. So then when he came back in\n1930, with a promise that this person was not going to come back with him. He finally did bring\nit back. So this situation got, well let\u2019s say practically out of hand. Because of this, my mother\nhad to leave the country. So she left for good in 1932. So he had been away in the 20\u2019s, and my\nmother looked after me and gave me -- this is the way we [indecipherable] in Romania, you\nknow, the first seven years at home. And that\u2019s something that normally remains with one for the\nrest of your life. And the life after, when my father came was so totally different that it just was\nvery, very difficult for me to really take it. Well, that\u2019s one part, but the part of my education\nwhere I must say I was thankful to him because he had an idea, which 1s certainly very well. He\nmade a special school for me inside the palace grounds, but in the [indecipherable] and we\nstarted with 12 boys in this school, each one of them from another part of the country, and from\ncompletely different social standings. From sons of simple peasants right up to sons of some\nindustrialists, or intellectuals. So that helped me to, say to rub shoulders with a very good part of\nthe Romanian people, even if at our age. And the teachers that we had were selected of some of\nthe best run schools, especially one school. And then at the end of every school year, for about\nthree weeks, we took off in a train, a special train with everybody in it, the professors and all of\nus, in a different part of the country, we -- well, we took our lessons and courses in geography\nand history on the actual place where these things ac -- happened. So that is how I got to know\nmy country, as much as possible, every little corner. I mean not every, it\u2019s very difficult, but a\nlot. Well, that has served me all through my life.",
        "Q: You have just described a difficult relationship with King Carol. As you grew up in those\nyears, did he talk with you and share his views about the political developments in Romania that\nhe was confronting?",
        "A: I forgot again. I forgot to mention one thing, that although my mother was gone,\n[indecipherable] with something was rather painful for me because he only let me go to see her\ntwice a year for three weeks in Florence, because she went to Florence. You know, she loved art\nso much, she f-found a villa there from 1932 and bought this place, and that\u2019s where I used to go\nand see her. And I can say that those six months in -- those few mon -- not few months, few\nweeks, I\u2019m sorry, few weeks at the time, I could say that that really charged my batteries,\nbecause otherwise it would have been really, if I can use the expression, absolute hell,\nsometimes. Now as far his political life and that, again, I don\u2019t think many people understand the\nsituation at the time. I was never, at least not from him ever told what was going on. We learned\na certain amount of political systems in school, but that was very dry, not in practice. So in all\nthese events that f-finally led up to 1940 when he had to leave, I knew about them, of course, as\na side line. But I had to try and find out by myself from various people, but I never got anything\nfrom him, from my father. And that was a terrible handicap when he left, because I was suddenly\n-- found myself in a position without actually knowing all the details. I knew a lot of things that\nwere going on, but not all the details on how everything worked. And that made life really\ndifficult.",
        "Q: How did you find out what was going on?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: How did you find out what was happening?",
        "A: Well, of course, I could see the newspapers and some other people -- and some of the boys\nused to tell me things that I always expected my father to say. So that\u2019s the -- that 1s a very\nsketchy thing and it\u2019s not the real basics of what was going on. That I didn\u2019t find out except\nmuch, much later.",
        "Q: Can you describe your reaction if -- if you were aware of the significance of this, of the rise of\nHitler to power in Germany\u2019?",
        "A: Well, of course, that\u2019s -- everybody knew, I knew, we saw in the papers, we knew what was\nhappening with him, yes. Well, I could put it then that in the later part of the 30\u2019s, all of Europe\nwas catching fire, see, so we were unfortunately in a place geographically, in a very, very\ndifficult situation from the east, then the pressures from the Germans. We had alliances before\nwith [indecipherable] many people knew, which when Hitler started bullying Europe, these\nalliances fell to pieces, unfortunately. So our part of Europe was left uncovered. We had maybe\nan advantage as a disadvantage because we have oil, and Hitler needed oil. We have the Danube\n[indecipherable] part of the Danube. I think he liked that part also. So the whole political\nsituation was getting more and more complicated, more and more involved. But I just found\nthese things out in a [indecipherable] so to speak, not the actual basics, not the actual mechanism\nof it. That was my difficulty.",
        "Q: Did you have the same difficulty knowing what -- what happened in Romanian political life at\nthat time? There was a -- this was a period when right wing parties began to appear in Romania.",
        "A: Yes. Of course [indecipherable] these people that used to come, wanting audiences to my\nfather, but just very rarely other people, we had certain festivities. I knew a lot of them. I knew\nquite a lot of what they were and what they were doing, but that\u2019s about all. I had no actual\nproper contact with these people. They just sort of just -- you know, like a -- how shall I say,\nmeet at a party, that sort of thing. But not in depth. Now that was very difficult.",
        "Q: Some historians have said that some of those right wing political groups, the Iron Guard in\nparticular --",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: -- had great appeal to young people in this country. Were you aware of -- of their mass ap-\nappeal to young people here?",
        "A: Well, among the young people, yes, I have caught, how do I -- shall I say, from their point\n[indecipherable] long, because through their parents, I suppose, and themselves, they realized\nwhat had happened with me and my mother. Now that did -- I must say it was very, very\ngratifying because whenever we met these young people [indecipherable] the warmth was\nextraordinary. Maybe I didn\u2019t quite understand why it was happening, what the reason for it was,\nbut this I found out years later, because they realized what 1t was which was happening with my\nmother. And then you mentioned the point about the extreme right coming up, and that\n[indecipherable] influenced politically my father. Because I must say something here, which I\ndon\u2019t want to be badly understood. But this person that was the cause of my mother\u2019s sadness,\nshe was Jewish. Not that I have any particular feelings about that, but I have a feeling of what --\nbecause of her, what happened with my mother. And those extreme rights were [indecipherable |\nthe Nazi fifth column, you know, were anti-Jewish. That, of course, connected with my father,\nfrom his private life. Because during the 30\u2019s I must also admit that Romania progressed\nenormously, if not politically, but economically. We have our money, the leu was practically at\nthe level of the dollar in the end of the 30\u2019s. We had a standard of living like France and\nBelgium. So s -- some good did come, very much good. The trouble was the pol-political part\nthat was not quite as it should have been. And this background of my father with these others is a\ncomplicated matter. And then of course, some political tendency, like in all parts of Europe, you\nknow, we still have this -- how shall I put this, sort of a Byzantine influence, which is completely\ndifferent to what we know in the west, politically speaking. That also didn\u2019t quite fit in with\nsome of my father\u2019s ideas. And that\u2019s why, towards the end of the 30\u2019s, he formed a sort of a\n[indecipherable] we like to call 1t, which was not quite the thing to do, because when the real\ntrouble started, we didn\u2019t have the old political parties to lean on. And then you got the situation\nthat the extreme right started agitating out in the streets. Very complicated situation and he fell\ninto that. Now, these are all things that I -- not studied, I'll say, but I found out many more\ndetails many years after. But at the time we were all very worried and I could not make out\nexactly what was going on in detail, because I wasn\u2019t told. I had to try and pick it up here and\nthere. That\u2019s very much in a nutshell.",
        "Q: What was your father\u2019s view about Jews in Romania? What were his feelings, his personal\nfeelings and his political feelings?",
        "A: About me personally?",
        "Q: Abo -- about Jew -- Jewish people.",
        "A: Oh. Well, he never talked about them. Not a word. That is also something pretty extraordinary\nbecause we knew what was going on with Hitler and so on, but he never said a word to me. So I\ncan\u2019t really say what he actually felt about that. I\u2019m sorry, that -- just one of those things I\ncouldn\u2019t --",
        "Q: An-and what did he think about the Iron Guard?",
        "A: Well, that --",
        "Q: Did he -- did he speak about that?",
        "A: Well, the Iron Guard you mean?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, well that, of course, I could feel it more than hear it, to understand that he was, of\ncourse, not at all for that. He didn\u2019t want that at all. They were attacking him because of this\nperson. And there were certain things that went on of course, which we also found out much\nlater. Like the execution of these whole group of Iron Guard people. I still can\u2019t make out exactly\nif he approved this or if he instigated this, or it was done by some of the government people\nwithout him knowing [indecipherable] that I really cannot say, because I was not told. And even\ntoday I\u2019m not very clear [indecipherable |",
        "Q: That execution of the group of Iron Guard people, including Corneliu Codreanu himself, took\nplace as your father was returning from a visit to Germany. This was actually a visit that you\nbegan --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- with him --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- in London. Could you talk about that trip --",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: -- to -- to, I believe Germany and France and the United Kingdom and what your goals were\nand what the results were.",
        "A: Well, that again comes into the same complex with me, because I was there officially with\nhim, of course, in London, Paris, and then we went to [indecipherable]. But what was going on\nunderneath, the discussions he had around these places, I never knew a thing. It seems\ninconceivable, this thing, in a way, but unfortunate that that\u2019s how it was. I just know that the\nEnglish visit -- you know, the English royal family, and many of the English people, did not\nappreciate my father at all because of his private life. So, the official part, of course, had to go\nalong as it normally goes, but couldn\u2019t exactly feel hostility, but you felt something that was not\nquite the same as another place, you know. In France that was different and of course when we\nended up in [indecipherable], of course I knew what Hitler was doing and I knew who he was\nand so on, but I was not involved. My father and him went up in the -- in the house there, and\nwhat happened, I don\u2019t know. What I heard that was being said, apparently, I c -- but I can\u2019t be\nsure, but Hitler must have said something about the extremists. In what way and how, I really\ncan\u2019t tell. But whether what happened with Iron Guard execution was because of this, a-again,\nI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t -- I really don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You met Adolf Hitler at -- on that occasion. Was that the first time you had met him and can\nyou tell us your impressions of him and the people around him?",
        "A: Well, of course I saw them all around there the first time I have ever been to this place. But\n[indecipherable]. That was a very -- just to show you, there was a awkward thing that happened\nthat\u2019s [indecipherable] neither here nor there in this whole thing, because everybody knew my\npassion for cars and mechanics. So I happened to look out the window and I saw his big\nMercedes there. So one of his aides, I think, was [indecipherable] so, are you interested in autos?\nI said well, yes. So they took me down and offered me to go in this car of his, ride it up to the\nmountain at the little eagle\u2019s nest, what you call it, it was on top of the [indecipherable] and we\nwent down, ju-just to show you I was out of all this thing that was going on 1n-inside.",
        "Q: And your father did not reveal in his attitude or -- or mood, what was happening?",
        "A: No [indecipherable]",
        "Q: In this same trip, when you visited the United Kingdom -- I know because I\u2019ve seen a\nphotograph of a dinner at Guild Hall, where you were seated with Prime Minister Neville\nChamberlain.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Can you talk about him?",
        "A: No, I think we just talked, you know, what one talks at a big party like that, but nothing else.\nAnd some of the newspapers had some funny jokes about that. They were wondering if I talked\nto him about fishing, because he was supposed to be a good fisherman, or something, but not --\nyou know --",
        "Q: So at this time you were not aware of or talking about the Munich accords and the results of\nthis for Romania.",
        "A: No. Not at all, unfortunately.",
        "Q: When did you become aware of th anti-Semitic nature of political groups like the Iron Guard,\nand the League of National Christian Defense of -- of Achay Cuza, and -- and the National\nChristian Party that had both Goga and Cuza.",
        "A: Well, there was Cuza, of course I met him, but I didn\u2019t have very much contact with him, so\non. But all through the school year, the \u201937 - \u201938 - \u201939, I could feel it was -- something was\nboiling up. And I was again, very much aware of what was happening, but without knowing all\nthe underneath and how the mechanism was working. What was happening 1s -- well we were all\nvery concerned.",
        "Q: Did you ever see the demonstrations that took place in the street by these groups?",
        "A: No, no, no, we were all but closed in in this thing, and when we used to go out, any event or\nsomething locally, that was kept out. But, when he got to the [indecipherable] in the beginning of\n1940, then of course I could hear them screaming outside, not yet. Now then -- I did find out that\nthey were screaming because they wanted all the change because of what happened with\nCodreanu and the [indecipherable] this whole story has ever been brought up and\n[indecipherable] getting more and more acute. Not yet. [indecipherable] I didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You made reference earlier, your Majesty, to the political reorganization that your father\nmade here in na -- in the early part of 1938.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: Did he talk with you at that time about what his goals were, for the Frontul Renasterii\nNationale, th-the Front of National Rebirth.",
        "A: Right. That was [indecipherable] in the new constitution we made in 1938, of course we had\nto learn all about that in school. We practically had to, not quite but nearly, learn it by heart. My\nreaction to that was -- what shall I say, sort of unknowing of the details on the things brought this\nthing on, that I only found out much later. Probably the dissatisfaction of my father, because\ncertain politicians would not exactly follow what he would like to do. A certain amount of\nfriction among them. So what I made out later on was that my father got fed up with this way of\nhappenings. So that\u2019s why he put them out and introduced this new Frontul Renasteri1, they\ncalled it, which was -- looked to me like on the basis of some sort of -- not extreme right, but\nvery right. You know, all uniforms and all sorts of things that were not in our character. So of\ncourse the general population did not really appreciate this sort of thing, but we couldn\u2019t do\nmuch about it then.",
        "Q: He was supported --\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: -- last year that King Carol was king, and the last year before you became king was a very\ncomplicated and troubled period in Romania. It was a year that began with the murder of a prime\nminister, of Armand Calinescu. Do you remember from that period, the impact of that murder on\nthe royal house and on your father?",
        "A: Well, I do remember something, yes. My impression of the time was that this was the revenge\nof the Iron Guard for what happened with that group that was killed. That\u2019s what we imagine.\nWhat happened afterwards, was a sort of a revolt among the people\u2019s feelings because those\nthree people that actually killed the prime minister, were caught, brought to the place where they\nshot him and were shot in the head, and left them lying there. That I remember. So the reaction\nof the people was that no matter what they did, how much of -- th-that\u2019s not the way to behave in\na civilized country. That was the reaction. They even came, a lot of people -- town people, I\nthink and maybe some other places, and they put flowers on there. That I remember. What\nhappened, we were at the time [indecipherable] we were leaving for Torchyn, because there was\nsome work being done on the -- behind the palace where we lived. And we were -- I was at lunch\nwith my father when we heard the -- some screams on the radio, which was cut immediately.\nAnd then here\u2019s the master of the household, or the marshalle of the house, as you call it. He was\non his way back home, he came back rushing, and came in and said -- I can tell you the word he\nsaid was Armand, which was called Armand Calinescu, is dead. The reaction, I saw my father go\nwhite in the face [indecipherable] he went up in his room. So wa -- that\u2019s how I -- how I saw it, I\nwas there. Well, after that he called me up to his room and started to -- you know, he was on the\nshock, deep shock. He said a whole bunch of things that I should realize that these people are\nmurderers, that any day he could be shot also, that -- I don\u2019t know a whole lot of other details\nwhich I don\u2019t quite remember, but I know that he was -- what shall I say, he was -- he -- he was\ngoing to pieces, really. Well -- and after that I think they must have talked in the [indecipherable]\nbecause I don\u2019t know again the details [indecipherable] not explain, were not told. Now that was\nthe reaction, I was there, I li -- I lived with.",
        "Q: Did he ever recover his control of the situation after that?",
        "A: Well, he was in control for quite some time. But then, you know, Europe -- Europe was going\nto pieces also. Then the -- the way the country had to navigate between all these things going on\nwas getting more and more complicated. As I said before, the real political parties were -- were\nnowhere present, and he was more or less quite alone with this new thing that they produced. So\nhe was in control, of course, but the feeling in the population was going down and down, so that\nwas a difficulty. This 1s all the things that I suffered -- I suffered it, I was living with it, but\nfeeling it from the boys at school, and things I saw in the newspaper, but not the actual\ninformation, properly be given to me of how and what is going on. That I didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: In 1940, King Carol invited some Iron Guard members, including Horia Sima into the\ngovernment. How can we understand that?",
        "A: That\u2019s one of these things difficult to understand. You see, we got another situation which\nwas rather humiliating for my father in a sense, because this General Antonescu at the time,\nwhich was very much against him because of his private life and because of his politics with\nthese party things and so on. [indecipherable] was against my father in certain declarations. So\nbeing a officer when this wi -- went down very badly with my father, of course and he put him\nunder house ar -- sort of a house arrest if you can call it, in a monastery. In the monastery\n[indecipherable] and he put him away. Not -- not prison, but anyhow a semi -- semi-free\n[indecipherable]. Again, a situation evolving in such a way that suddenly he had to call him back\nto put him in some position. See, it\u2019s a very, very awkward situation, all this. And I just saw\nthese things happening, but I couldn\u2019t get the underneath of it. I know that the Legionnaire\n[indecipherable] had been contacting Antonescu, but without knowing what and how long --\nwhat was being prepared, that I didn\u2019t know at all. I don\u2019t want to jump too far forward, but --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- but in the beginning of the 40\u2019s, of course, on top of the situation -- internal situation and\nwe got [indecipherable] from the Russians, and then we got [indecipherable] for northern\nTransylvania, and then it got from bad to worse. Only some things that sort of leaked out to me.\nFirst of all, the population around me also said we have to do something, we have to have some\nreaction, and there was no reaction from that point of view. It was quite obvious that we could\nnot -- our army, or anybody else could have possibly stopped the Russians from coming in, but\none should have don\u2019t it, at least a sort of symbolic something -- resistance, you call it. I\nremember there was a crown council [indecipherable] after the Russian [indecipherable]. It was a\n-- I was not involved, but I know it was going on [indecipherable] in Paris, when one of the\nleading former politicians and professor -- maybe you know the name of Yargo, the historian. He\nwas also not very friendly with my father, but anyhow he was there, because he was part of these\npeople, so he came out of this meeting when I ha -- happened to be there. So he came straight up\nto me, I could see he was livid, in his face. And he just said a very strong word and he said, all\nthat bunch is a bunch of traitors, and he walked off. And I -- I didn\u2019t understand what that was.\nThen after I found out that they got probably frightened or didn\u2019t have backbone or whatever it\nis, I\u2019m not quite sure, but they all advised that there\u2019s nothing to be done, we just have to\ncomply, not to [indecipherable]. And that\u2019s one of the revolt of many of the people in Romania,\nis that we should have at least done something. But that\u2019s about how I got to know these things,\ncause I was also [indecipherable] put in the sideline that I was also involved because it was the\nend of my schooling years, just before university, and I was having my final exam with four\nother boys, just about that same period. Now, I don\u2019t know what you call it in English, in\nRomanian or the French is the baccalaureate, and sh -- all this -- you know, you get sort of torn\nbetween the home life and different things. I have to concentrate on my exams, and the same\ntime these things are going on. You\u2019re sort of -- get to be in a sort of a haze, you know? So that\u2019s\nin a nutshell also, if I could say.",
        "Q: In this period, the very end of your father\u2019s reign, did he ever share with you the idea that he\nmight lose control and have to leave?",
        "A: No, I can\u2019t say he did. You know, from -- I had this background because of my mother, you\nsee. And he never talked to her -- about her, or very, very rarely. When I used to come back from\nseeing her, he never even asked me how she was. So no, I didn't -- I saw something wasn\u2019t\nclicking, you know, that\u2019s -- this is just very, very difficult way to explain it, surely, but I think\nsome people maybe will understand.",
        "Q: How did you learn that King Carol had abdicated, and that you were king?",
        "A: Well, this was getting on, as I said before, when -- this is a little before the beginning of\nSeptember, 1914, when he called back Antonescu. He made a prime minister, I think it was at\nthe time. Accidentally, I happened to be just outside my father\u2019s office when Antonescu was in\nthere. And when he came out, he saw me there, he came straight up to me and just said -- he -- he\nalways had this funny habit of talking in the third person, you know, about himself. A-Awkward.\nSo he came up to me and she said General Antonescu guarantees the situation. Then he left. Now\nwhat did he guarantee, what was the situation? I had no idea. So we come to the last part of it,\nthis was on the fifth of September. On or before that, he had another audience with Antonescu\nwhen Antonescu demanded that he give up nearly all his prerogatives to Antonescu. That just left\nhim with a few -- put it little bit vulgar in a way, [indecipherable]. So on the fifth of September,\nwe could hear shooting going on outside in the streets. The guards around the palace grounds\nwere reinforced [indecipherable], I met him in the garden. But all that night we stayed awake,\nuntil about five o\u2019clock in the morning, and then a courier came from Antonescu with a letter. It\nwas given to him, he opened it, and as he was reading I could vaguely see his color was draining.\nAnd he gave this letter to this man that was the gray matter behind him, a man called\nLudverrano, just gave it to him, so that he read it also, and then he said to my father in French,\nbecause he used to talk a mixture of languages, he said, nothing more to do. So I was, you know,\nsort of shaken out of a haze, so I just said, well, what\u2019s this? So then they read it to me, in which\nAntonescu demanded his abdication because of all sorts of things, the political situation, this\n[indecipherable] one thing, my mother and so on, a whole mixture of things, and that -- then --\ndemanding his abdication. So that was that. That\u2019s at five o\u2019clock in the morning, we hadn\u2019t slept\nall night, and funnily enough there\u2019s a certain lady there, was a -- a -- present at this same thing.\nWhat she had to do with [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know, but anyhow. So I went to bed. And about\nnine o\u2019clock in the morning, the telephone rang. Now one of the ladies, she said, quick, get up,\nget dressed to take the oath. Now [indecipherable] slept for two hours. So that\u2019s what happened.\nI went back into the palace after I sort of woke up. And there\u2019s Antonescu, the patriarch, the\npresident of the Supreme court, and one or two others. Horia Sima was not there. They said he\nwas, but he wasn\u2019t. So I took the oath. And as my father had given him all those prerogatives, he\nput under my nose [indecipherable] so many people didn\u2019t understand how I can, but he made\nme, forced me to sign it, that Romania became a -- a national legionnaire state. You probably\ndon\u2019t remember all that stuff. Well, this was, again, because of my non-information of what had\nbeen going on. I did not quite understand what was going on really. So this situation was -- was\nagain, kept quite out of [indecipherable]. Now one thing I must say that I was extremely grateful\nto Antonescu in all this unpleasantness that he did bring my mother back. And I consider this one\nthing, that if it wouldn\u2019t have been for her all those awful years, I don\u2019t know what I would have\ndone, cause she -- she kept me going, in a way.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And bringing back all those years when I was quite small, and so [indecipherable]. So that\u2019s\nthe situation I found, and how I f-found myself involved in it.",
        "Q: And what was the tone of Antonescu toward you as king in this period?",
        "A: He was a terribly stubborn man, you know, and very foolishly he had this idea which -- like\nwith -- I discovered it. You know, the -- the French saying says, [indecipherable] father, so is the\nson. [indecipherable] p\u00e9re, [indecipherable] fils. So he probably had this stupid idea that I was\nrather influenced, or that I was going to follow in my life like my father. So he kept me away. He\ncertainly was not particularly friendly with me, no, because of this mentality of his. So, all this\nattitude of his went on til 1944. He was cold, correct if you like, which he was. But personally\n[indecipherable] around it, you can feel these sort of things, 1t was cold. He had great respect for\nmy mother, that he did. She managed to put certain things through with him, but that\u2019s about all.",
        "Q: The National Legionary State --",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: -- for historians, meant for Romania move towards alliance with Germany, and action against\nthe Jews, and --",
        "A: Well. Well, yes --",
        "Q: Can y --",
        "A: -- well --",
        "Q: -- can you speak about this?",
        "A: -- that situation with the Legionnaires, they didn\u2019t last very long. I don\u2019t know why -- perhaps\nAntonescu used them or they used him or something to get my father off, but 1t\u2019s very possible.\nBut then was the famous rebellion, they called it. He put and end to that in [indecipherable] with\na -- I think, the permission of Hitler somehow, because they were his men, after all. But that was\nall. And from that, of course, there was an -- a verbal alliance with ro -- Germany. There was\nnothing written, as far as I know, and that\u2019s how he got us in 1n a sort of partnership with Nazi\nGermany, which was not at all in the feelings and mentality of the Romanian people, neither that\nright, neither at left, neither. We never had these sort of mentalities, but he, having all the\nprerogatives, he did what he want [indecipherable].",
        "Q: During the Iron Guard rebellion, to which you referred, there was terrible violence against\nJews in Bucharest and some in other parts of the country.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: Were you aware of what was happening in the street toward Jews?",
        "A: We found that out a bit, let\u2019s say, a few days after. I know -- that I know very well\n[indecipherable] things that happened there, but I must have something else, it is not with -- not\njust the Jews, there were many of our own Romanian intellectuals, historians, professors,\nministers, they were also in the same thing, they were also murdered together with all the others.\nBut that\u2019s, of course [indecipherable] discussed in the feelings of the population, but they\ncouldn\u2019t do anything, they -- we -- we all had our hands tied because of Antonescu. And I don\u2019t\nknow if he managed to stop this, what was happening with the Jews, or did he just\n[indecipherable] it out by itself, I\u2019m not quite sure.",
        "Q: Did he talk with you at any time about policy toward the Jews?",
        "A: No, he kept pretty [indecipherable] my father because this thing of the Russian\n[indecipherable], that they shouldn\u2019t get anything, that they were all [indecipherable] the same\nold stories coming over and over again, you know, but nothing else. You may [indecipherable |\nalready, and many other people that when the war was declared on Russia, my mother heard it on\nthe BBC on the radio. And that same morning we went [indecipherable] I called up his deputy\n[indecipherable] the small Antonescu we called him, and I said, what\u2019s going on? We are\n[indecipherable] nobody tells me. He said, well, I thought you were going to see it in the\nnewspapers. So you can see the kind of atmosphere that was going on. They declare -- my\ncountry declaring war against the Russians, and I\u2019m not even told. And I must find it out in the\nnewspaper, you know. Y-Y-You sort of remain speechless [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Were there people on whom you could count to share information with you about what was\nhappening?",
        "A: Well, this is also something. First of all, I inherited a number of people from my father.\nOthers Antonescu put out immediately and replaced them with his people [indecipherable] and\nmy people run the court. So, you know, you felt you\u2019re cornered, spied on, you couldn't actually\nopen your heart to these people and try and discuss properly -- but of course the -- the officers\naround me came with all sorts of information [indecipherable]. We knew what was going on, but\nwithout any possibility of doing anything or even saying anything.",
        "Q: When the war began, there was a simultaneous increase 1n violence against Jews in -- in\nRomania. C -- do you recall the -- the events surrounding the -- the pogrom in Iasi --",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: -- and how -- how you understood that at -- in the -- inj -- June of 1941.",
        "A: Well, we had information, yeah I did have information what was going on, then we had the\nchief rabbi, which I mentioned before, Safran, as a young man at the time. He managed,\nsomehow he came and saw me quite often, and saw my mother, and he was giving us\ninformation. But in the very, very early stages of this, we could not even man -- manage to talk a\nword of all this, Antonescu wouldn\u2019t even listen. But slowly, slowly during the war, with more\nand more information coming from Safran. My mother did there manage somehow, I don\u2019t\nunderstand how, but she managed somehow to get Antonescu, get some reason in him. And\nalthough these things did happen, we can\u2019t -- I mean, be honest about it, it did. I can say that no\nJews in Romania was ever sent to a concentration camp in Germany or Poland, no th -- no. They\ndid send them into Transnistria, quite a number of them. But maybe you also know that\nEichmann was running around in Romania also. Now that was the information we got on the sly,\nthat he was trying to get Antonescu to do the final -- what you call it the final pogrom, and -- but\nhe refused. He let other [indecipherable] things did happen, but not this real bad one, as far as I\ncan know -- I -- as far as [indecipherable] afterward. Not only that, but he allowed that my\nmother should send a few train wagons into Transnistria with clothes and food for the Jews that\nwere there, [indecipherable]. And it -- it did work to a certain degree. And because of that -- you\nprobably know that also, that my mother\u2019s position was getting rather dangerous, from the\nGerman point of view, because of this.",
        "Q: Could you speak more about that?",
        "A: Well, the idea that I could understand [indecipherable] you\u2019re talking about many, many\nevenings about all these things, she was completely distressed about it. And as I knew her, if\nanother question that there were Jews, that there were Romanians, that they were this, or they\nwere, whatever it was, they were human beings like us. [indecipherable]. From a Christian point\nof view and a moral point of view, these are unconceivable things. And that 1s why she tried her\nbest to get Antonescu to get something through his head that this is not something that is\npossible. It\u2019s -- she even told me once that if -- I co-can\u2019t also say something and try and alter\nthis, I\u2019ll be known as Michael the Bad. Sh -- I don\u2019t know if she meant it like that, or there --\nsomething, but anyhow. Well, I do remember we had one or two meals with Antonescu, and\neven the German minister [indecipherable]. And I tried to say something, and my mother said\nquite more. The atmosphere was glacial. But somehow something did get through to Antonescu\nand he didn\u2019t do the worst that could have been done, as far as I know.",
        "Q: Did you have similar conversations with Mihai Antonescu?",
        "A: Yes, we did also. And he was much more -- how shall I say, more softened on this thing. He\ntried several times to take my part in some of these problems with Antonescu. Maybe that also\nhelped. That even my mother, let\u2019s say [indecipherable] backbone [indecipherable] fight to try\nand get some sense in [indecipherable] stop as much as possible, what was going on. Because we\nalso in Romania, the moment the war started, what was left of the political parties, the national\n[indecipherable] laborers and myself and the whole population of Romania, we fully agreed that\nwe have to get back the [indecipherable]. No, no problem there. No pe -- all [indecipherable]\nwhat not -- one step of our front, yeah. With the result that we ended up in Stalingrad. And that\u2019s\nhow it happened. But I -- I want to say about that that the Romanian people are not the kind who\nwant to go around and do these sort of things. It\u2019s not in their character. Whether they like the\nJews or not like them, that\u2019s beside the point. The fact is that they -- it\u2019s not in the character of\nRomania, at least at that time. [indecipherable]. And that was, in a way we had the moral backing\nfrom the feelings in Romania about this thing, that\u2019s perhaps why my mother had a little more\ncourage to fight it out, and I too. I mean, we tried to do what we could, and it\u2019s very much thanks\nto the Rabbi Safran, that used to come fairly often and tell us what was happening and as far as\nhe could make out, what was going to happen. So we did manage perhaps because of this, to say\ncertain things before something did happen. It\u2019s possible.",
        "Q: Were you aware that --\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: Your majesty, again, talking about the autumn of 1941, were you aware that Antonescu had\nordered the deportation to Transnistria of all of the Jews of Bessarabia and northern Buchovina,\nand the conditions in which these deportations were taking place?",
        "A: Well that part is something which was not very pleasant, because there are -- we had infor -- I\nhad information, like everybody else, through the army, that w-when the Russians came in and\ninvaded -- you know that that part of northeastern Romania, there were quite a lot of Jews living\nup there. Now, by all means, not all at all, because many had run out, but there were quite a few,\nunfortunately, that collaborated with the Soviets and some rather unpleasant things did happen\nthere also, that\u2019s quite true. Whether they were brought in by the Russians or they were actually\nones that were there, I\u2019m not very sure, but something did happen there. Not that that changed\nthe -- the mentality in Romania, no. It was just [indecipherable] about that, that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: And when the Romanian army occupied Odessa --",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: -- there was an incident involving Romanian -- the Romanian command center, and in reprisal\nthe army executed twent -- 25,000 local Jews, Ukrainian Jews from Odessa. Did this news come\nto Romania? Was there general awareness? Were you and the Queen mother aware of this?",
        "A: Those are things we found o -- out of course after it happened. You know, that\u2019s after, I don\u2019t\nremember who it was exactly, blew up some headquarters, I think, yeah. Now, which part of the\narmy did some of those things there, I\u2019m not quite sure where the order came from, but I think it\nwas the general sort of thing given to the army. But I do know that there was one general\ncommanding around there that protested violently, and as far as I remember he was put out and\nmoved somewhere else. So there was some reaction, that I know. But we found it out probably\nsay a week, 10 days after th -- all that happened, yes. Now we -- we were all very unhappy about\nthis. But a -- but Antonescu never said a word to me on that. Again, all of these things were -- I\nwas kept in the dark.",
        "Q: You visited the military front on some occasion. Did you witness the conditions in\nTransnistria itself, in which people were living under -- under Romanian administration?",
        "A: That the people --",
        "Q: That -- in which people were living.",
        "A: Oh. Well, we did -- we knew the general situation, yes, but I said before, these details that\nwere going on underneath and so on, that we only found out much later, after the events.",
        "Q: You have made reference to the action that you took, and that the Queen mother took --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- in 1942, to stop the deportation --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- of Jews from Romania. And indeed the Queen mother has been recognized as Righteous\nAmong the Nations by Yad Vashem, and she is rec -- so recognized at our museum as well. I\u2019d\nlike to ask about some of the people who perhaps helped to increase your awareness and the\nQueen mother\u2019s awareness of what was actually happening with the Jews. And I\u2019m -- I -- I\u2019d like\nto ask you about some individuals because history tells us that certain people were involved, but\nwe don\u2019t have real confirmation in most cases. One you have made reference to, and that is\nRabbi Safran. Were you ever approached by other Jewish leaders in the country?",
        "Q: Yes, I was, Filderman, who was, I think, the head of the Jewish community in Romania as far\nas I remember. But not quite as often as with Rabbi Safran. But we did -- we did meet him and\nthen, with the heads of the two political parties, [indecipherable] and Bratiano, indirectly\ncollaborated I\u2019d say, morally with them, because they also tried to push, if not directly with\nAntonescu, but around somehow. Then he was the patriarch [indecipherable] directly then with\nAntonescu. As far as I remember there were one or two of his ministers, I think, who also did not\nagree with this thing and tried to do their best. They couldn\u2019t get -- do too much because they\nwould have been immediately put out. I\u2019m not sure of their names, but I know there were some.\nAnd a few others, which I do not know exactly who, but I know there were some -- some people\nin -- among the higher class in Romania that did try to influence [indecipherable].",

        "A: Well, he was very close to us, with my mother, myself and my father\u2019s secretary was in\nschool with me. We used to discuss all these things and try and find the ways and means to sort\nof try and put some brakes on all this and somehow [indecipherable] the actual thing itself, I'll\nhave to read it again to see how it was, but I know we did have many, many meetings with --\nwith him when he was in c -- at court with me, so we saw him nearly every day. And whenever\nsomething like this came up we always spent several hours discussing it, yes, 1t\u2019s quite true.",

        "A: Auschnitt?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I knew him before, my father\u2019s [indecipherable] because they had [indecipherable]\nyears together with Malaxa.

        "A: No, no.",

        "A: Because after the -- after my father left, all these people disappeared. They were put away, or\nleft, or something. So after that no, but before [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Were there foreign diplomats who approached you on the matter of the Jews?",
        "A: No. Because I didn\u2019t have the occasion to meet with them. Very, very rarely. If -- and the\ndiplomats at that time almost -- you know, the Americans, the British and the others are gone.\nThe Germans, I know the ones that were more or less in that line, but we never got to talk about\nanything of that, unfortunately. We didn\u2019t have enough contact with them.",

        "A: Ah, Balun, yes. Not specially because I used to meet all the higher clergy, but I had heard that\nhe\u2019d tried something else, but I never talked with him about it. With the patriarch yes, but not\nwith the others. Patriarch came here several times and he talked to my mother and try and find\nsomething to influence [indecipherable] the others I -- I imagine they must have said something.\nI did hear about Balun, but I never personally talked to him about that.",
        "Q: Another church leader, not of the Romanian church, is the papal nunzio, Andrea Casullo --",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: -- who was here in Bucharest. Again my question is, was this a person who raised the Jewish\nissue 1n a significant way?",
        "A: You see, the situation with Antonescu and me, and all these people that he had put around me,\nexcept for [indecipherable] we -- we felt spied upon. All these other big groups, like church\ndignitary models, well we sht -- imagined that they were proper Christians, what else could I say,\nbut you know, we were really cagey about certain things because just about [indecipherable]\nAntonescu\u2019s, you didn\u2019t quite dare go and speak your mind out loudly too much. Not for us, but\nperhaps those people might start suffering afterwards. So we were very, very careful, maybe it\nwas too much, not to say -- not to be too, too aggressive, you might say. We were aggressive\nwhere -- like my mother was with Antonescu to try and get something done, but that was inside\nhere, sort of not in public. That was a very, very strange situation, because all these people\naround with big ears report immediately -- I even had several occasions when the head of my\nmilitary house here, a general, went and made a written report to Antonescu about something\nthat I talked about. So you see, we found that out after and we had to sort of pull back a little. It\nwas a -- a Situation which very difficult for people outside the world, this sort of thing to quite\nunderstand because in Britain and America [indecipherable] you breathe the freedom. We did not\ngot fr-freedom inside ourselves and our mentality what we couldn\u2019t dare go out quite like we\nwould have liked to. S-Sometimes here and there we managed, but not as much as we would\nhave liked to.",
        "Q: How were you and the Queen mother able to discuss these matters?",
        "A: Well, the -- we didn\u2019t at that time, I don\u2019t think we had microphones in the house. That came\nmany years after. But oh, we talked, we talked, we talked days and weeks among ourselves,\ntrying to find some [indecipherable] to impress what we -- our I -- ideas and our mentalities. And\nthat\u2019s why something did get through. Well, I can give you another example for instance,\nAntonescu insisted that I should go on the front. All right, that was probably the right thing to do\nwith our troops. But he wanted me to go to Transnistria. Was that big part of per -- part of land\nbetween the Dniester and the Bug. That\u2019s where the -- the Jews were put. Well, I refused flatly. I\nsaid, I\u2019m not going there. If you want me to go to the front, I\u2019ll take an airplane and go to\n[indecipherable] but I\u2019m not going there. He didn\u2019t like that at all, but he had to -- he swallowed\nit. So, he had unveil a few things like that. We did manage, but let\u2019s say the basic part of ruling\nthe country, and that, no.",
        "Q: And your decision not to go to Transnistria, what was the -- the rationale for that decision?",
        "A: What? To go to Transnistria?",
        "Q: To not go to Transnistria.",
        "A: Oh. To Moscow? No.",
        "Q: To Transnistria. When Antonescu wanted you to visit the front.",
        "A: Ah, yes. Well, he thought it was a -- because I was the head of [indecipherable] you see. He\nwas commanding it, but I was the head. It\u2019s a very awkward situation there because that was all\nthese arrangements that was left over from my father. So he found, and I suppose it was fairly\nright, that once our troops were fighting anyhow, I should show myself among them. Which was\nnat-natural, yes, but not, I don\u2019t think for any other reason, but just that, to be among them,\nwhich I did, in two or three places, in [indecipherable] and some other places in the fronts in\nRomania when it started, also. But only once or twice, not more.",
        "Q: How did you finally convince Antonescu not to deport more Jews?",
        "A: This 1s a -- it\u2019s a very long story, but I\u2019ll try and concentrate 1t somehow, because we were so\ndistressed about going into Russia, because it was none of our business. I know the Romanians --\nsee, generations, you look at our history, all our troubles that we\u2019ve had here had always come\nfrom the east. So after the Russian revolution, slowly, slowly, all these years, we saw what was\ngoing on there, so this was certainly not in our mentality. So the fact to take back Tr-\nTransylvania and -- I mean Bessarabia and Buchovina was perfectly in agreement with that, but\nnot any further. So, as things were getting from bad to worse, we\u2019d realized maybe before th-that\nthis is going to end extremely badly. We got together in a clandestine -- I sort of picked the\nwords not quite right, if you like, on the sly, with [indecipherable] and our group of some\nofficers, to try and find a way to get out of the war. And this started already in the end of \u201942, it\nwent all through \u00b043 and 44. That\u2019s how we had the -- well, there again you have Antonescu\nwhich is an awkward situation [indecipherable] with the Germans, doing everything with the\nGermans and at the same time he let people from these two parties go out to [indecipherable].\nThey let them even have, some of them that were in prison, radio transmitter. I-It\u2019s one of these\nsituations that doesn\u2019t make sense, you know? But anyhow. So we sent some people out to try\nand contact the allies, that is the American and the Great Britain, to see what we can do. We\nprobably don\u2019t want to go on with this [indecipherable] we have to get out. So these discussions\nand negotiations, recall they went on quite a long time til late \u201943 and \u201944, when Britain and\nAmerica said that we won\u2019t discuss with you any more, because you\u2019re bringing the Communist\nSocialist group in this. We were all shocked about these things because what else we gotta do?\nWe have in Romania an -- an population of 20 million people, about. We had known, about 500\nCommunist members and another 300 sympathizers. Well, what do they got to do with what --\nthis, you see? We found that out much later, that 1t was the Soviet [indecipherable] that we\nshould bring them in. So anyhow, they try and get [indecipherable], the -- Stalingrad happened.\nThe situation was getting more and more dangerously acute. So we finally decided that we must\nfind the right moment to tell Antonescu that he has to stop this war, or make an armistice. So if\nhe doesn\u2019t want to, he\u2019s got to be put out. That\u2019s not very easy to say, but, you know, their job\nwas going up and down inside Romania all the time. The Gestapo sitting here, next to the Royal\nPalace and the German commander too, recall [indecipherable]. It\u2019s not very funny, so to speak,\nyou know? We had -- just when the worst part is happening, the Russian troops were coming\nclose to our borders. The Germans funnily enough, they took two Panzer divisions from\nRomania and put them up in Poland. Maybe -- maybe you heard about all this. But that gave us a\nsort of a little breathing space, but we still couldn\u2019t do anything on our own completely, because\nwe asked for help from the allies, which we didn\u2019t even get an answer from then. And that\u2019s\nbecause of the Soviets, we knew that after. So, to bring a very long story short, when the front\ncollapsed in Bessarabia in the north, Antonescu came back from the front in the 22\u2122 or\nsomething like that, in August, through an indiscretion [indecipherable] we heard the telephone\nconversation, from his headquarters, saying that Antonescu is going back on the front on the 24\",\nI think was. Well our arrangement, which have already been done, was to call him on the 26\".\nWe asked for strong American bombardment, for the air force to come here to hit certain spots\nwhere the Germans were, and then we hear [indecipherable] 24\". So in a great rush, we\norganized the [indecipherable] for the few troops that were here, just in case, and I called him, it\nhappened to be the 23\" of August, and [indecipherable] specific date [indecipherable] just like\nthat. [indecipherable] came. And that is when everybody knows what happened. It\u2019s just that I'd\nlike to specify one thing is that it\u2019s always been said that it was a coup d\u2019etat, but it -- I don\u2019t\nmake coup d\u2019etats. I was the head of state, even if he was the [indecipherable] he was called. So\nit was perfectly on my prerogative to dismiss him. So, not a coup d\u2019etat, you could call it a\npolitical coup if you like, but that\u2019s not quite the same thing. And our greatest luck of all was\nfirst of all, surprise, because I\u2019m perfectly convinced that the Gestapo and the Secret Services\nhere knew that -- exactly that we were plotting something. The very [indecipherable]\ninformations on the political side, whereas what actually happened was the military side. And\nthat they didn\u2019t know. And that was a complete surprise, it took them completely by surprise,\nand contrary to what very many people like to say, that Romania was liberated by the Soviets,\nwhich is absolute nonsense, excuse me the word, because we finish with the Germans in 48\nhours, or four days [indecipherable]. When the Russians came here to [indecipherable] there\nwasn\u2019t single German left. We -- we managed to take too, 50,000 prisoners, including the top\nbrass, right down to the last, here and in other parts around the town. The g -- the ra -- Americans\nbombed those places and that finished the resistance, and there were one or two small pockets\nnorth, near the oil fields, which were -- that went pretty quick. And that was all. And that was the\ngreatest luck we had. I think we must have -- how shall I say? God\u2019s hand in all this, because you\nsee, another little detail was that when we did this thing in 23\" of August, the Russian advance\nstopped, or slowed. We didn\u2019t react at the time, because we didn\u2019t understand, but later we\nunderstood what that is. I personally am convinced that -- you remember in Warsaw we had a\nuprising against the Germans, and the Russians stopped the advance, they let the Germans\n[indecipherable] the whole lot, and then they came in. Well, that\u2019s what they were hoping that\nwas going to happen with us, only we had the luck to finish ourselves, without them. And that\ndisturbed them very much. But two little details which I can give you if you like, from their point\nof view is when -- in the palace it was, on the night of the 23\"\u00a2 of August, the Communist man\ncame with -- who was known later on as [indecipherable], you probably know that. He was --\ncame as another name. But -- but Toscanu, who came in straight to me in the office where I was,\nand he looked at me and said, what have you done, you\u2019ve ruined us. So I -- I was speechless. I\nmean, we\u2019d been discussing this thing for months, and I go -- he tells me that it\u2019s ruined him. We\nunderstood that later, I\u20191l come to that. When the armistice -- what we call it here, was made up\nof a commission that went to Moscow. But Toscanu let -- leaked it out after that he went to see\nsome important person 1-in Moscow. And he reports to him, he said, what have you done over\nthere, you spoiled our business, something like that. The Romanian word is different. [speaks\nRomanian]. That\u2019s how they put it. So he said, well what -- what is [indecipherable] you know,\nit\u2019s scratching down a bit from the surface, he came [indecipherable] very slow there in the\ntrucks in the northeast, waiting for this to happen, and surely they have that in mind, that the\nGermans were going to finish us and then they could come and do what they wanted straight\naway. But here is an very important thing, because I had the supports of the two main parties, the\nmain ones, of course the other two also, but the strongest support of was the army. So,\nAntonescu was commanding the army. Well, when I gave the order, there wasn\u2019t one single\ndefection. And that 1s something that a -- a -- what I heard would happen in Hungary. It seems\nthat [indecipherable] gave the same order and nothing happened. They didn\u2019t listen to him. And I\ndon\u2019t know you explained this. Is it the military discipline? Is it the oath they took? Was it\nbecause the commanders of the big units and all that, realized as much as us that the whole thing\nis finished, and that something had to be done? Or is it a combination of all that together? But\nanyhow, it worked, see. Not many people seem to understand quite all these underneath things\nthat were going on, cause all our work, political work so to speak, on the sly, that lasted well\nover a year. It came [indecipherable]. It was, of course, unpleasant for me in a sense, risking the\nwhole thing one -- one side, but Antonescu were not an enemy of mine, he was an adversary, if\nyou can call it like [indecipherable] I just put in English, because he behaved very unpleasantly\nwith us. But anyhow, it was something I had to do, nothing to do with, like many people say, my\nrevenge on Antonescu [indecipherable] that\u2019s absolute nonsense. I don\u2019t have that. That\u2019s not my\nmentality. But it was something that had to be done, and we did what we had to. And that was\nmy duty towards my country [indecipherable] that\u2019s the main thing. With God\u2019s help, we\nmanaged. What happened afterwards, that is a completely different question. That\u2019s not our\ndoing. So our hope for whoever hears this thing will have a better understanding of it.",
        "Q: That\u2019s -- that\u2019s very interesting, and this puts an end to the Antonescu regime. I want to ask\nyou to come back with me just for a moment --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- to 1942, when you and the queen are pressing Antonescu to not deport the Jews of Ragatz,\nand southern Transylvania and ask that, were you aware that there was a new plan to deport\nRomanian Jews to the concentration camps in Poland?",
        "A: Yes, that also came from Rabbi Safran, the information. And then we had heard that\nEichmann was around, running around Romania, and talking to Antonescu, talking to the Secret\nService here, Gestapo and what have you, you know. So that\u2019s why it was -- my mother was\nstrong about certain things, because it\u2019s hard to bring Antonescu\u2019s attention, but it was unheard\nof, the kind of thing like that, it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know, she used some arguments, I don\u2019t remember\nexactly, but that got through to him, which --",
        "Q: And you knew that these were extermination camps in Poland?",
        "A: Yeah, which was fairly unusual with Antonescu, because he was very stubborn. But maybe he\nhad a little soft point somewhere that my mother managed to get through. So he did not have\nanybody sent out t-to the German and Polish [indecipherable]. Yes, he did Transnistria, that\u2019s\ntrue, but it could have been much worse. And that was thanks to my mother [indecipherable] she\nmanaged to get this, to do something through to him. And much also, thanks to Safran, because\nhe used to come and tell us what\u2019s -- either what is happening or what he knew was going to\nhappen. So that\u2019s why we could manage a little bit to do something before.",
        "Q: One story that we hear --\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: Your Majesty, I -- I have heard that when the Queen Mother wanted to be successful in\nstopping the deportation of Jews, she threatened Antonescu, and told him that if this did not stop,\nshe would leave the country, and that you would leave the country with her. Is this so, and can\nyou tell us about what actually made the greatest impression on Antonescu, and when you knew\nthat you had been successful?",
        "A: Yes, now that you mention that, I remember vaguely something that my mother told me, that\nshe said that, something like that to Antonescu. Was a little bit I said before, when she tried to\nget through to him that this is a [indecipherable] all the rest of it [indecipherable] I -- I think that\nprobably when she added something about me, then -- that we would leave, or something like\nthat, I think that\u2019s true, yes. Now that you say it, I do remember that she had said something to\nme, not much detail, but just a few words to that effect, yes.",
        "Q: And was this what made the difference?",
        "A: Yes, you know, she had a very, very deep religious feeling. She was more -- let\u2019s say more\nChristian than religious, inspired by her family. A very, very strong moral sense, and these sort\nof things that were going on, just -- she could not take them. It was not just sitting still, she had\nto say something, and sometimes I heard her say to the other people some very, very -- really\nstrong things. And she didn't mince her words at all, so maybe in this particular occasion, she\nused that type of talk with Antonescu. I don\u2019t know, I wasn\u2019t there when she said that to him, or\nmaybe she -- I was there, but she said it in a corner. I didn\u2019t hear her say it, but she told me\nafterward, now that you reminded me of it.",
        "Q: And Antonescu\u2019s reaction once this was decided, was anger, or what -- what was his reaction?",
        "A: Well, that was the [indecipherable] surely.",
        "Q: You have described already your action to remove Antonescu from power. Within two years\nafter that, you signed his death sentence, and he was executed together with Mihai Antonescu,\nand Alexianu, the governor of Transnistria, and Mr. Vasiliu from the Ministry of the Interior.\nWhen you removed Antonescu from power, did you expect to be signing his death sentence after\nthat?",
        "A: What do you [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you expect that the course of events --",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: -- following his removal would lead to his death sentence?",
        "A: Well, yes, we did imagine that probably something like that would happen. I mean, the\njudgement. But the whole way this was done -- you see, this 1s [indecipherable] one of these\ncunning things with the Soviets. Could I say something before that? I have been accused of many\npeople that I gave up Antonescu to the Communists, which is not true, for the simple reason, on\nthe night of the 23\" to the 24\"\" of August, we were over our heads with reorganizing the whole\nthing, making the government, naming ministers, and all the rest that went with it. And then,\nsome officers in the general staff, through one of my [indecipherable] said, you must leave\nBucharest as quick as possible, because there\u2019s going to be s -- reprisals from the Germans, as\nthe American bombing couldn\u2019t have happened before the 26\". So we all packed up in a hurry,\nand I left Bucharest at around two or half past two in the morning. We went out to the west\n[indecipherable] the country. Now, we had organized with the two parties to have a team that\u2019s\ngoing to take over Antonescu and take care of him, because we didn\u2019t want something to happen\nwith him like with Mussolini, get him out. So, unfortunately these two parties did not have\nanybody ready because it happened too quick. The only one that had a team ready of course, was\nthe Communists [indecipherable]. So around four in the morning they came to the palace and\nsaid, we have to take care of this thing, because if nothing happens, and th -- the Prime Minister I\nnamed, General Sanatescu, maybe in a little moment of weakness, let them take him. So they\ntook him to the seat of the Communist party in Bucharest, yeah, a place called [indecipherable].\nWell, I was in -- already in the western part of the country, how could I have done that, see?\nNow, the Communists, as I was coming to say 1s that they took -- when the Russians came in\nhere, of course they took him, Moscow -- Lubyan, I think, the prison. They kept him for two\nyears, about. So what happened in the meantime, the Russian troops were here, they started\nmessing up all the political parts, messing up what I was trying to do. [indecipherable] come in\nhere and smashing door in my office, [indecipherable] on the table [indecipherable] forcing me\nto put Groza on, bringing in all the Communists in \u201945. So it\u2019s not -- th-things started to\ndeteriorate, I wouldn\u2019t say very, very fast, but very clearly. So, in the meantime the population\nwas getting sort of worked up, moderately at least. So in the two years that Antonescu was hir --\nkept by the Russians, th-the people started to see that perhaps was better during Antonescu\u2019s\ntime than it was now. Which, in fact, it was, unfortunately, except for the war. So when\nAntonescu got back and put on trial, all these people were sort of said, after all, he\u2019s done\nsomething, these people, look what they\u2019re doing, see? On that I\u2019m convinced that the way they\ndid this trial, which was a farce, all of it fixed beforehand like the Nazis used to do also, like in\nRussia. It was done I thi -- I -- felt there -- m-maybe I think of it now, to -- to bring down my\nimage. See -- you see, in that time I don\u2019t know -- want to know everything that\u2019s\n[indecipherable] not with the thing behind it. Now what, constitutionally speaking, my\n[indecipherable] my situation was that no act is valid that I would sign without the counter-\nsignature of the minister. That is in our constitution because it\u2019s the minister that countersigns\nthat is responsible, not me. So, when they came out with the sentences -- now, the Minister of\nJustice at the time, Patrascanu came [indecipherable] saying -- asking for pardon, which\nAntonescu did not do. With -- his lawyer did it, but not him. So on, and then he said no, no, no,\none or two years. So constitutionally speaking, what will be my position? I could refuse that and\nsign something else, but nothing will have happened. That\u2019s one thing. And the second\ncomplication was that -- that there were Soviets behind it. I\u2019m absolutely certain [indecipherable]\nAmerican. So even if anybody would have wanted to [indecipherable] this thing, 1t would not\nhave been possible. And that\u2019s how it happened. And the way they did that was -- excuse me the\nword, was absolutely disgusting. Cause after all, he was a patriot, he loved his country, he tried\nto defeat [indecipherable] and so on. He -- politically he did it for the -- my question was what\ncould we do? [indecipherable] But his feelings were the Romanian [indecipherable]. Although he\nwas [indecipherable] things that went on, still. And the way this was done was -- was not a trial,\nthey were murderers, to put it quite frankly, and was very distressing for me and my mother and\nall the others, ever after what we been though. And the way he ended, I didn\u2019t like it, although\nprobably something had to be done, you couldn\u2019t avoid that, you know. Not quite like that, you\nknow? No matter what he did and all that, he is still [indecipherable] you know, they did\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: When the war ended, your Majesty, you faced another huge challenge here, and you had\nbegun to talk about it. You showed great courage in opposing the communization of Romania.\nAfter four years of war, and this invasion of the Soviet Union that you have referred to, do you\nbelieve it was possible for Romania to resist the imposition of a Communist regime? That it was\nrealistic to think that this was possible?",
        "Q: Well, all these things that happened after [indecipherable] circles of high politics in the world,\nthat were not our doings. And we were in a way, the victims of all these things. I tried to do what\nI could to put brakes on it. And because it was -- these arrangements were in high circles. I don\u2019t\nmean to be unfair, misunderstanding, but we did not get the proper backing and help from the\nwestern allies. We know [indecipherable] percentages. So the Soviets that came here, they were\nthe monsters and they would do what they want, and how they wanted. I know there were a lot of\n-- a lot of -- lot of contacts with the American person in [indecipherable] commission and the\nBritish one. And they were doing what they could here, locally. And they understood the\nsituation very well, but they didn\u2019t, as far as I can make out get the true backing from\nWashington and London [indecipherable] these big arrangements. And there\u2019s not much more I\ncan tell you about that. I did what I could with who I could, whether it\u2019s [indecipherable] I say, a\nlosing battle in a way, but at least one thing I can say, that like [indecipherable] like my mother,\ntoo. Maybe we lost our battle, at least we lost it with some dignity, with our heads up that we did\nat least tried to do what we could to save what we could -- be saved. It didn\u2019t work, but not\nbecause of us.",
        "Q: Looking back 50 years to this period of time that we have talked about, and especially the\nyears when you were king, from 1940 through 1947, how would you characterize those years in\nRomania\u2019s history?",
        "A: It\u2019s difficult to put that in one word. What could I say? Besides being sad, it was more than\nfrustrating. You see what was happening, you have your hands tied. I was here in the position\nwhich was supposed to do more, and I couldn\u2019t. You know, it\u2019s frustrating, perhaps you\u2019re not\nstrong enough, but I don\u2019t know what other words to put in it. We fought like lions and tigers.\nOur conscience, my mother and myself, is clear. We had hands tied, you know, that\u2019s why I say\nfrustrating, we were -- I don\u2019t know a better word for that, but to say it was difficult is a -- an\nunderstatement of [indecipherable] you know. That\u2019s how things happen sometimes, you know.\nYou know, they say sometimes very often that the ways of the lord are many and unpenetrable.\nWe never quite know what these meanings are, why these things happen. You try to do the best,\nsometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to be [indecipherable] you\nknow, but I mean, you know -- you -- you think about these thing, you can\u2019t put it out of your\nmind sometime. And that\u2019s one side -- all right, that\u2019s me personally, you see, but I look at\nwhat\u2019s happened to this part of Europe and my country. So that [indecipherable] on top of it.\nDifficult to explain sometime, very difficult. People say you get bitter, yes, you do get bitter\nsometimes, but if you let bitterness lead you, that means you go down the drain with it. That\u2019s\nnot the way to do thing. I mean, it\u2019s sad and it\u2019s painful, it\u2019s wounds you have, but you might --\nmight let that take you -- lead you, because then you -- then you say, I\u2019m not so good at all. So\nwe tried at least. I -- I hope I managed to [indecipherable].",
        "Q: I would like to thank you very much for sharing these thoughts with us today. Thank you,\nyour Majesty.",
        "A: Well, I can perhaps add something, that with all these awful things that have been happening\nsince the war, especially in this part of Europe and Romania, being on a program like yours now,\nI do hope that maybe I can -- I brought some light into some events, to explain certain things\nwhich I\u2019m quite convinced that very few people know. [indecipherable] and the thing happens as\n[indecipherable] you see events, you start making up your mind. Make decisions, or have ideas\nwhich are not actually based on the full knowledge of what\u2019s what. And that is what I\u2019ve been\ntrying all these years to sort of bring out. To stop looking at the surface of things, which are bad\nor good, whatever it is. What -- the point it, why have we got to a certain point if you don\u2019t\nunderstand what\u2019s happened underneath. And that is a sort of grudge I have against many people,\nthat they dis -- they discuss the -- the signs on the surface, without bothering to go underneath\nand find out why, what are the causes of these things, and to make -- to try and get that thing\nhealed up. And then the rest should follow. You know, they say sometimes that it\u2019s a very -- how\nmost people cut the branches [indecipherable] off, but a very, very few that look at the\nunderneath of the -- at the roots of it. And that\u2019s what I wish so much, with all this modern world\nnow and the people that -- that -- you know, everything\u2019s [indecipherable] all over the place now,\nto -- to try and understand why did certain things happen, and the tragedy of the whole -- what\nwill you say, let\u2019s say in this part of Europe, a hundred million people here. And unfortunately\nit\u2019s happening in other places also now. And we feel terrible when we see these thing\n[indecipherable] here, of course, because it\u2019s my country, but when you see other things that\nhappen -- look at New York now. Which just -- I don\u2019t know. We -- we have another Romanian\nsaying that says, when God wants to mock the people, they take [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t like\nthat, but when you see what\u2019s happening in the world these days, you really don\u2019t know. You\ncan\u2019t understand any more, sometime.

        "Q: Yes, I was, Filderman, who was, I think, the head of the Jewish community in Romania as far\nas I remember. But not quite as often as with Rabbi Safran. But we did -- we did meet him and\nthen, with the heads of the two political parties, [indecipherable] and Bratiano, indirectly",

You showed great courage in opposing the communization of Romania.\nAfter four years of war, and this invasion of the Soviet Union that you have referred to, do you\nbelieve it was possible for Romania to resist the imposition of a Communist regime? That it was\nrealistic to think that this was possible?",
        "Q: Well, all these things that happened after [indecipherable] circles of high politics in the world,\nthat were not our doings. And we were in a way, the victims of all these things. I tried to do what\nI could to put brakes on it. And because it was -- these arrangements were in high circles. I don\u2019t\nmean to be unfair, misunderstanding, but we did not get the proper backing and help from the\nwestern allies. We know [indecipherable] percentages. So the Soviets that came here, they were\nthe monsters and they would do what they want, and how they wanted. I know there were a lot of\n-- a lot of -- lot of contacts with the American person in [indecipherable] commission and the\nBritish one. And they were doing what they could here, locally. And they understood the\nsituation very well, but they didn\u2019t, as far as I can make out get the true backing from\nWashington and London [indecipherable] these big arrangements. And there\u2019s not much more I\ncan tell you about that. I did what I could with who I could, whether it\u2019s [indecipherable] I say, a\nlosing battle in a way, but at least one thing I can say, that like [indecipherable] like my mother,\ntoo. Maybe we lost our battle, at least we lost it with some dignity, with our heads up that we did\nat least tried to do what we could to save what we could -- be saved.

        "Answer: Now, this thing of the name 1s something which is very confusing to very many people.\nMy name is Michael, as you know, but this -- I don\u2019t want to make too many explanations, but\nanyhow just tell you how things are. Of course, our family comes from Germany from\nSigmaringen, become the first -- the first king of Romania was a Hohenzollern, like my\ngrandfather. But that ended with my grandfather. So we, in fact, do not have a family name in\nRomania. The family name of Hohenzollern is the origin, but that does not figure in any\ndocument or [indecipherable]. So that\u2019s why I said it\u2019s a bit confusing. So, the result 1s that we\nare called by our name and then add, of Romania. So that\u2019s how things are now. I was born on\nthe 25\" of October, 1921, in Sinaia in a house which unfortunately doesn\u2019t exist any more\nbecause the o-original one burnt down, and it was rebuilt in 1954 - \u201956, the modern one. So that\u2019s\nabout all for the introduction.",
        "A: Well, two things here. One was my personal feelings and personal relationship with him, and\nthe second part was aj -- was about the schooling. My personal relationship with him, to put it\nquite frankly, was not all the very best. I don\u2019t know how many people in United States and other\ncountries are quite aware of what went on at that period. I don\u2019t want to say too strongly, but his\nprivate life is the one that -- that other people know more about. As you know, probably, that he\nhad a connection with a certain person. As far as I could recollect what I was told, that started\nwhen I was about two years old. And in the 20\u2019s he left Romania and renounced his rights to the\nfamily and to the throne and to everything concerning Romania. So then when he came back in\n1930, with a promise that this person was not going to come back with him. He finally did bring\nit back. So this situation got, well let\u2019s say practically out of hand. Because of this, my mother\nhad to leave the country. So she left for good in 1932. So he had been away in the 20\u2019s, and my\nmother looked after me and gave me -- this is the way we [indecipherable] in Romania, you\nknow, the first seven years at home. And that\u2019s something that normally remains with one for the\nrest of your life. And the life after, when my father came was so totally different that it just was\nvery, very difficult for me to really take it. Well, that\u2019s one part, but the part of my education\nwhere I must say I was thankful to him because he had an idea, which 1s certainly very well. He\nmade a special school for me inside the palace grounds, but in the [indecipherable] and we\nstarted with 12 boys in this school, each one of them from another part of the country, and from\ncompletely different social standings. From sons of simple peasants right up to sons of some\nindustrialists, or intellectuals. So that helped me to, say to rub shoulders with a very good part of\nthe Romanian people, even if at our age. And the teachers that we had were selected of some of\nthe best run schools, especially one school. And then at the end of every school year, for about\nthree weeks, we took off in a train, a special train with everybody in it, the professors and all of\nus, in a different part of the country, we -- well, we took our lessons and courses in geography\nand history on the actual place where these things ac -- happened. So that is how I got to know\nmy country, as much as possible, every little corner. I mean not every, it\u2019s very difficult, but a\nlot. Well, that has served me all through my life.",
        "A: I forgot again. I forgot to mention one thing, that although my mother was gone,\n[indecipherable] with something was rather painful for me because he only let me go to see her\ntwice a year for three weeks in Florence, because she went to Florence. You know, she loved art\nso much, she f-found a villa there from 1932 and bought this place, and that\u2019s where I used to go\nand see her. And I can say that those six months in -- those few mon -- not few months, few\nweeks, I\u2019m sorry, few weeks at the time, I could say that that really charged my batteries,\nbecause otherwise it would have been really, if I can use the expression, absolute hell,\nsometimes. Now as far his political life and that, again, I don\u2019t think many people understand the\nsituation at the time. I was never, at least not from him ever told what was going on. We learned\na certain amount of political systems in school, but that was very dry, not in practice. So in all\nthese events that f-finally led up to 1940 when he had to leave, I knew about them, of course, as\na side line. But I had to try and find out by myself from various people, but I never got anything\nfrom him, from my father. And that was a terrible handicap when he left, because I was suddenly\n-- found myself in a position without actually knowing all the details. I knew a lot of things that\nwere going on, but not all the details on how everything worked. And that made life really\ndifficult.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Well, of course, I could see the newspapers and some other people -- and some of the boys\nused to tell me things that I always expected my father to say. So that\u2019s the -- that 1s a very\nsketchy thing and it\u2019s not the real basics of what was going on. That I didn\u2019t find out except\nmuch, much later.",
        "A: Well, of course, that\u2019s -- everybody knew, I knew, we saw in the papers, we knew what was\nhappening with him, yes. Well, I could put it then that in the later part of the 30\u2019s, all of Europe\nwas catching fire, see, so we were unfortunately in a place geographically, in a very, very\ndifficult situation from the east, then the pressures from the Germans. We had alliances before\nwith [indecipherable] many people knew, which when Hitler started bullying Europe, these\nalliances fell to pieces, unfortunately. So our part of Europe was left uncovered. We had maybe\nan advantage as a disadvantage because we have oil, and Hitler needed oil. We have the Danube\n[indecipherable] part of the Danube. I think he liked that part also. So the whole political\nsituation was getting more and more complicated, more and more involved. But I just found\nthese things out in a [indecipherable] so to speak, not the actual basics, not the actual mechanism\nof it. That was my difficulty.",
        "A: Yes. Of course [indecipherable] these people that used to come, wanting audiences to my\nfather, but just very rarely other people, we had certain festivities. I knew a lot of them. I knew\nquite a lot of what they were and what they were doing, but that\u2019s about all. I had no actual\nproper contact with these people. They just sort of just -- you know, like a -- how shall I say,\nmeet at a party, that sort of thing. But not in depth. Now that was very difficult.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Well, among the young people, yes, I have caught, how do I -- shall I say, from their point\n[indecipherable] long, because through their parents, I suppose, and themselves, they realized\nwhat had happened with me and my mother. Now that did -- I must say it was very, very\ngratifying because whenever we met these young people [indecipherable] the warmth was\nextraordinary. Maybe I didn\u2019t quite understand why it was happening, what the reason for it was,\nbut this I found out years later, because they realized what 1t was which was happening with my\nmother. And then you mentioned the point about the extreme right coming up, and that\n[indecipherable] influenced politically my father. Because I must say something here, which I\ndon\u2019t want to be badly understood. But this person that was the cause of my mother\u2019s sadness,\nshe was Jewish. Not that I have any particular feelings about that, but I have a feeling of what --\nbecause of her, what happened with my mother. And those extreme rights were [indecipherable |\nthe Nazi fifth column, you know, were anti-Jewish. That, of course, connected with my father,\nfrom his private life. Because during the 30\u2019s I must also admit that Romania progressed\nenormously, if not politically, but economically. We have our money, the leu was practically at\nthe level of the dollar in the end of the 30\u2019s. We had a standard of living like France and\nBelgium. So s -- some good did come, very much good. The trouble was the pol-political part\nthat was not quite as it should have been. And this background of my father with these others is a\ncomplicated matter. And then of course, some political tendency, like in all parts of Europe, you\nknow, we still have this -- how shall I put this, sort of a Byzantine influence, which is completely\ndifferent to what we know in the west, politically speaking. That also didn\u2019t quite fit in with\nsome of my father\u2019s ideas. And that\u2019s why, towards the end of the 30\u2019s, he formed a sort of a\n[indecipherable] we like to call 1t, which was not quite the thing to do, because when the real\ntrouble started, we didn\u2019t have the old political parties to lean on. And then you got the situation\nthat the extreme right started agitating out in the streets. Very complicated situation and he fell\ninto that. Now, these are all things that I -- not studied, I'll say, but I found out many more\ndetails many years after. But at the time we were all very worried and I could not make out\nexactly what was going on in detail, because I wasn\u2019t told. I had to try and pick it up here and\nthere. That\u2019s very much in a nutshell.",
        "A: About me personally?",
        "A: Oh. Well, he never talked about them. Not a word. That is also something pretty extraordinary\nbecause we knew what was going on with Hitler and so on, but he never said a word to me. So I\ncan\u2019t really say what he actually felt about that. I\u2019m sorry, that -- just one of those things I\ncouldn\u2019t --",
        "A: Well, that --",
        "A: Well, the Iron Guard you mean?",
        "A: Yeah, well that, of course, I could feel it more than hear it, to understand that he was, of\ncourse, not at all for that. He didn\u2019t want that at all. They were attacking him because of this\nperson. And there were certain things that went on of course, which we also found out much\nlater. Like the execution of these whole group of Iron Guard people. I still can\u2019t make out exactly\nif he approved this or if he instigated this, or it was done by some of the government people\nwithout him knowing [indecipherable] that I really cannot say, because I was not told. And even\ntoday I\u2019m not very clear [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Well, that again comes into the same complex with me, because I was there officially with\nhim, of course, in London, Paris, and then we went to [indecipherable]. But what was going on\nunderneath, the discussions he had around these places, I never knew a thing. It seems\ninconceivable, this thing, in a way, but unfortunate that that\u2019s how it was. I just know that the\nEnglish visit -- you know, the English royal family, and many of the English people, did not\nappreciate my father at all because of his private life. So, the official part, of course, had to go\nalong as it normally goes, but couldn\u2019t exactly feel hostility, but you felt something that was not\nquite the same as another place, you know. In France that was different and of course when we\nended up in [indecipherable], of course I knew what Hitler was doing and I knew who he was\nand so on, but I was not involved. My father and him went up in the -- in the house there, and\nwhat happened, I don\u2019t know. What I heard that was being said, apparently, I c -- but I can\u2019t be\nsure, but Hitler must have said something about the extremists. In what way and how, I really\ncan\u2019t tell. But whether what happened with Iron Guard execution was because of this, a-again,\nI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t -- I really don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Well, of course I saw them all around there the first time I have ever been to this place. But\n[indecipherable]. That was a very -- just to show you, there was a awkward thing that happened\nthat\u2019s [indecipherable] neither here nor there in this whole thing, because everybody knew my\npassion for cars and mechanics. So I happened to look out the window and I saw his big\nMercedes there. So one of his aides, I think, was [indecipherable] so, are you interested in autos?\nI said well, yes. So they took me down and offered me to go in this car of his, ride it up to the\nmountain at the little eagle\u2019s nest, what you call it, it was on top of the [indecipherable] and we\nwent down, ju-just to show you I was out of all this thing that was going on 1n-inside.",
        "A: No [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I think we just talked, you know, what one talks at a big party like that, but nothing else.\nAnd some of the newspapers had some funny jokes about that. They were wondering if I talked\nto him about fishing, because he was supposed to be a good fisherman, or something, but not --\nyou know --",
        "A: No. Not at all, unfortunately.",
        "A: Well, there was Cuza, of course I met him, but I didn\u2019t have very much contact with him, so\non. But all through the school year, the \u201937 - \u201938 - \u201939, I could feel it was -- something was\nboiling up. And I was again, very much aware of what was happening, but without knowing all\nthe underneath and how the mechanism was working. What was happening 1s -- well we were all\nvery concerned.",
        "A: No, no, no, we were all but closed in in this thing, and when we used to go out, any event or\nsomething locally, that was kept out. But, when he got to the [indecipherable] in the beginning of\n1940, then of course I could hear them screaming outside, not yet. Now then -- I did find out that\nthey were screaming because they wanted all the change because of what happened with\nCodreanu and the [indecipherable] this whole story has ever been brought up and\n[indecipherable] getting more and more acute. Not yet. [indecipherable] I didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Right. That was [indecipherable] in the new constitution we made in 1938, of course we had\nto learn all about that in school. We practically had to, not quite but nearly, learn it by heart. My\nreaction to that was -- what shall I say, sort of unknowing of the details on the things brought this\nthing on, that I only found out much later. Probably the dissatisfaction of my father, because\ncertain politicians would not exactly follow what he would like to do. A certain amount of\nfriction among them. So what I made out later on was that my father got fed up with this way of\nhappenings. So that\u2019s why he put them out and introduced this new Frontul Renasteri1, they\ncalled it, which was -- looked to me like on the basis of some sort of -- not extreme right, but\nvery right. You know, all uniforms and all sorts of things that were not in our character. So of\ncourse the general population did not really appreciate this sort of thing, but we couldn\u2019t do\nmuch about it then.\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: Well, I do remember something, yes. My impression of the time was that this was the revenge\nof the Iron Guard for what happened with that group that was killed. That\u2019s what we imagine.\nWhat happened afterwards, was a sort of a revolt among the people\u2019s feelings because those\nthree people that actually killed the prime minister, were caught, brought to the place where they\nshot him and were shot in the head, and left them lying there. That I remember. So the reaction\nof the people was that no matter what they did, how much of -- th-that\u2019s not the way to behave in\na civilized country. That was the reaction. They even came, a lot of people -- town people, I\nthink and maybe some other places, and they put flowers on there. That I remember. What\nhappened, we were at the time [indecipherable] we were leaving for Torchyn, because there was\nsome work being done on the -- behind the palace where we lived. And we were -- I was at lunch\nwith my father when we heard the -- some screams on the radio, which was cut immediately.\nAnd then here\u2019s the master of the household, or the marshalle of the house, as you call it. He was\non his way back home, he came back rushing, and came in and said -- I can tell you the word he\nsaid was Armand, which was called Armand Calinescu, is dead. The reaction, I saw my father go\nwhite in the face [indecipherable] he went up in his room. So wa -- that\u2019s how I -- how I saw it, I\nwas there. Well, after that he called me up to his room and started to -- you know, he was on the\nshock, deep shock. He said a whole bunch of things that I should realize that these people are\nmurderers, that any day he could be shot also, that -- I don\u2019t know a whole lot of other details\nwhich I don\u2019t quite remember, but I know that he was -- what shall I say, he was -- he -- he was\ngoing to pieces, really. Well -- and after that I think they must have talked in the [indecipherable]\nbecause I don\u2019t know again the details [indecipherable] not explain, were not told. Now that was\nthe reaction, I was there, I li -- I lived with.",
        "A: Well, he was in control for quite some time. But then, you know, Europe -- Europe was going\nto pieces also. Then the -- the way the country had to navigate between all these things going on\nwas getting more and more complicated. As I said before, the real political parties were -- were\nnowhere present, and he was more or less quite alone with this new thing that they produced. So\nhe was in control, of course, but the feeling in the population was going down and down, so that\nwas a difficulty. This 1s all the things that I suffered -- I suffered it, I was living with it, but\nfeeling it from the boys at school, and things I saw in the newspaper, but not the actual\ninformation, properly be given to me of how and what is going on. That I didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: That\u2019s one of these things difficult to understand. You see, we got another situation which\nwas rather humiliating for my father in a sense, because this General Antonescu at the time,\nwhich was very much against him because of his private life and because of his politics with\nthese party things and so on. [indecipherable] was against my father in certain declarations. So\nbeing a officer when this wi -- went down very badly with my father, of course and he put him\nunder house ar -- sort of a house arrest if you can call it, in a monastery. In the monastery\n[indecipherable] and he put him away. Not -- not prison, but anyhow a semi -- semi-free\n[indecipherable]. Again, a situation evolving in such a way that suddenly he had to call him back\nto put him in some position. See, it\u2019s a very, very awkward situation, all this. And I just saw\nthese things happening, but I couldn\u2019t get the underneath of it. I know that the Legionnaire\n[indecipherable] had been contacting Antonescu, but without knowing what and how long --\nwhat was being prepared, that I didn\u2019t know at all. I don\u2019t want to jump too far forward, but --",
        "A: -- but in the beginning of the 40\u2019s, of course, on top of the situation -- internal situation and\nwe got [indecipherable] from the Russians, and then we got [indecipherable] for northern\nTransylvania, and then it got from bad to worse. Only some things that sort of leaked out to me.\nFirst of all, the population around me also said we have to do something, we have to have some\nreaction, and there was no reaction from that point of view. It was quite obvious that we could\nnot -- our army, or anybody else could have possibly stopped the Russians from coming in, but\none should have don\u2019t it, at least a sort of symbolic something -- resistance, you call it. I\nremember there was a crown council [indecipherable] after the Russian [indecipherable]. It was a\n-- I was not involved, but I know it was going on [indecipherable] in Paris, when one of the\nleading former politicians and professor -- maybe you know the name of Yargo, the historian. He\nwas also not very friendly with my father, but anyhow he was there, because he was part of these\npeople, so he came out of this meeting when I ha -- happened to be there. So he came straight up\nto me, I could see he was livid, in his face. And he just said a very strong word and he said, all\nthat bunch is a bunch of traitors, and he walked off. And I -- I didn\u2019t understand what that was.\nThen after I found out that they got probably frightened or didn\u2019t have backbone or whatever it\nis, I\u2019m not quite sure, but they all advised that there\u2019s nothing to be done, we just have to\ncomply, not to [indecipherable]. And that\u2019s one of the revolt of many of the people in Romania,\nis that we should have at least done something. But that\u2019s about how I got to know these things,\ncause I was also [indecipherable] put in the sideline that I was also involved because it was the\nend of my schooling years, just before university, and I was having my final exam with four\nother boys, just about that same period. Now, I don\u2019t know what you call it in English, in\nRomanian or the French is the baccalaureate, and sh -- all this -- you know, you get sort of torn\nbetween the home life and different things. I have to concentrate on my exams, and the same\ntime these things are going on. You\u2019re sort of -- get to be in a sort of a haze, you know? So that\u2019s\nin a nutshell also, if I could say.",
        "A: No, I can\u2019t say he did. You know, from -- I had this background because of my mother, you\nsee. And he never talked to her -- about her, or very, very rarely. When I used to come back from\nseeing her, he never even asked me how she was. So no, I didn't -- I saw something wasn\u2019t\nclicking, you know, that\u2019s -- this is just very, very difficult way to explain it, surely, but I think\nsome people maybe will understand.",
        "A: Well, this was getting on, as I said before, when -- this is a little before the beginning of\nSeptember, 1914, when he called back Antonescu. He made a prime minister, I think it was at\nthe time. Accidentally, I happened to be just outside my father\u2019s office when Antonescu was in\nthere. And when he came out, he saw me there, he came straight up to me and just said -- he -- he\nalways had this funny habit of talking in the third person, you know, about himself. A-Awkward.\nSo he came up to me and she said General Antonescu guarantees the situation. Then he left. Now\nwhat did he guarantee, what was the situation? I had no idea. So we come to the last part of it,\nthis was on the fifth of September. On or before that, he had another audience with Antonescu\nwhen Antonescu demanded that he give up nearly all his prerogatives to Antonescu. That just left\nhim with a few -- put it little bit vulgar in a way, [indecipherable]. So on the fifth of September,\nwe could hear shooting going on outside in the streets. The guards around the palace grounds\nwere reinforced [indecipherable], I met him in the garden. But all that night we stayed awake,\nuntil about five o\u2019clock in the morning, and then a courier came from Antonescu with a letter. It\nwas given to him, he opened it, and as he was reading I could vaguely see his color was draining.\nAnd he gave this letter to this man that was the gray matter behind him, a man called\nLudverrano, just gave it to him, so that he read it also, and then he said to my father in French,\nbecause he used to talk a mixture of languages, he said, nothing more to do. So I was, you know,\nsort of shaken out of a haze, so I just said, well, what\u2019s this? So then they read it to me, in which\nAntonescu demanded his abdication because of all sorts of things, the political situation, this\n[indecipherable] one thing, my mother and so on, a whole mixture of things, and that -- then --\ndemanding his abdication. So that was that. That\u2019s at five o\u2019clock in the morning, we hadn\u2019t slept\nall night, and funnily enough there\u2019s a certain lady there, was a -- a -- present at this same thing.\nWhat she had to do with [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know, but anyhow. So I went to bed. And about\nnine o\u2019clock in the morning, the telephone rang. Now one of the ladies, she said, quick, get up,\nget dressed to take the oath. Now [indecipherable] slept for two hours. So that\u2019s what happened.\nI went back into the palace after I sort of woke up. And there\u2019s Antonescu, the patriarch, the\npresident of the Supreme court, and one or two others. Horia Sima was not there. They said he\nwas, but he wasn\u2019t. So I took the oath. And as my father had given him all those prerogatives, he\nput under my nose [indecipherable] so many people didn\u2019t understand how I can, but he made\nme, forced me to sign it, that Romania became a -- a national legionnaire state. You probably\ndon\u2019t remember all that stuff. Well, this was, again, because of my non-information of what had\nbeen going on. I did not quite understand what was going on really. So this situation was -- was\nagain, kept quite out of [indecipherable]. Now one thing I must say that I was extremely grateful\nto Antonescu in all this unpleasantness that he did bring my mother back. And I consider this one\nthing, that if it wouldn\u2019t have been for her all those awful years, I don\u2019t know what I would have\ndone, cause she -- she kept me going, in a way.",
        "A: And bringing back all those years when I was quite small, and so [indecipherable]. So that\u2019s\nthe situation I found, and how I f-found myself involved in it.",
        "A: He was a terribly stubborn man, you know, and very foolishly he had this idea which -- like\nwith -- I discovered it. You know, the -- the French saying says, [indecipherable] father, so is the\nson. [indecipherable] p\u00e9re, [indecipherable] fils. So he probably had this stupid idea that I was\nrather influenced, or that I was going to follow in my life like my father. So he kept me away. He\ncertainly was not particularly friendly with me, no, because of this mentality of his. So, all this\nattitude of his went on til 1944. He was cold, correct if you like, which he was. But personally\n[indecipherable] around it, you can feel these sort of things, 1t was cold. He had great respect for\nmy mother, that he did. She managed to put certain things through with him, but that\u2019s about all.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Well. Well, yes --",
        "A: -- well --",
        "A: -- that situation with the Legionnaires, they didn\u2019t last very long. I don\u2019t know why -- perhaps\nAntonescu used them or they used him or something to get my father off, but 1t\u2019s very possible.\nBut then was the famous rebellion, they called it. He put and end to that in [indecipherable] with\na -- I think, the permission of Hitler somehow, because they were his men, after all. But that was\nall. And from that, of course, there was an -- a verbal alliance with ro -- Germany. There was\nnothing written, as far as I know, and that\u2019s how he got us in 1n a sort of partnership with Nazi\nGermany, which was not at all in the feelings and mentality of the Romanian people, neither that\nright, neither at left, neither. We never had these sort of mentalities, but he, having all the\nprerogatives, he did what he want [indecipherable].",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: We found that out a bit, let\u2019s say, a few days after. I know -- that I know very well\n[indecipherable] things that happened there, but I must have something else, it is not with -- not\njust the Jews, there were many of our own Romanian intellectuals, historians, professors,\nministers, they were also in the same thing, they were also murdered together with all the others.\nBut that\u2019s, of course [indecipherable] discussed in the feelings of the population, but they\ncouldn\u2019t do anything, they -- we -- we all had our hands tied because of Antonescu. And I don\u2019t\nknow if he managed to stop this, what was happening with the Jews, or did he just\n[indecipherable] it out by itself, I\u2019m not quite sure.",
        "A: No, he kept pretty [indecipherable] my father because this thing of the Russian\n[indecipherable], that they shouldn\u2019t get anything, that they were all [indecipherable] the same\nold stories coming over and over again, you know, but nothing else. You may [indecipherable |\nalready, and many other people that when the war was declared on Russia, my mother heard it on\nthe BBC on the radio. And that same morning we went [indecipherable] I called up his deputy\n[indecipherable] the small Antonescu we called him, and I said, what\u2019s going on? We are\n[indecipherable] nobody tells me. He said, well, I thought you were going to see it in the\nnewspapers. So you can see the kind of atmosphere that was going on. They declare -- my\ncountry declaring war against the Russians, and I\u2019m not even told. And I must find it out in the\nnewspaper, you know. Y-Y-You sort of remain speechless [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, this is also something. First of all, I inherited a number of people from my father.\nOthers Antonescu put out immediately and replaced them with his people [indecipherable] and\nmy people run the court. So, you know, you felt you\u2019re cornered, spied on, you couldn't actually\nopen your heart to these people and try and discuss properly -- but of course the -- the officers\naround me came with all sorts of information [indecipherable]. We knew what was going on, but\nwithout any possibility of doing anything or even saying anything.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Well, we had information, yeah I did have information what was going on, then we had the\nchief rabbi, which I mentioned before, Safran, as a young man at the time. He managed,\nsomehow he came and saw me quite often, and saw my mother, and he was giving us\ninformation. But in the very, very early stages of this, we could not even man -- manage to talk a\nword of all this, Antonescu wouldn\u2019t even listen. But slowly, slowly during the war, with more\nand more information coming from Safran. My mother did there manage somehow, I don\u2019t\nunderstand how, but she managed somehow to get Antonescu, get some reason in him. And\nalthough these things did happen, we can\u2019t -- I mean, be honest about it, it did. I can say that no\nJews in Romania was ever sent to a concentration camp in Germany or Poland, no th -- no. They\ndid send them into Transnistria, quite a number of them. But maybe you also know that\nEichmann was running around in Romania also. Now that was the information we got on the sly,\nthat he was trying to get Antonescu to do the final -- what you call it the final pogrom, and -- but\nhe refused. He let other [indecipherable] things did happen, but not this real bad one, as far as I\ncan know -- I -- as far as [indecipherable] afterward. Not only that, but he allowed that my\nmother should send a few train wagons into Transnistria with clothes and food for the Jews that\nwere there, [indecipherable]. And it -- it did work to a certain degree. And because of that -- you\nprobably know that also, that my mother\u2019s position was getting rather dangerous, from the\nGerman point of view, because of this.",
        "A: Well, the idea that I could understand [indecipherable] you\u2019re talking about many, many\nevenings about all these things, she was completely distressed about it. And as I knew her, if\nanother question that there were Jews, that there were Romanians, that they were this, or they\nwere, whatever it was, they were human beings like us. [indecipherable]. From a Christian point\nof view and a moral point of view, these are unconceivable things. And that 1s why she tried her\nbest to get Antonescu to get something through his head that this is not something that is\npossible. It\u2019s -- she even told me once that if -- I co-can\u2019t also say something and try and alter\nthis, I\u2019ll be known as Michael the Bad. Sh -- I don\u2019t know if she meant it like that, or there --\nsomething, but anyhow. Well, I do remember we had one or two meals with Antonescu, and\neven the German minister [indecipherable]. And I tried to say something, and my mother said\nquite more. The atmosphere was glacial. But somehow something did get through to Antonescu\nand he didn\u2019t do the worst that could have been done, as far as I know.",
        "A: Yes, we did also. And he was much more -- how shall I say, more softened on this thing. He\ntried several times to take my part in some of these problems with Antonescu. Maybe that also\nhelped. That even my mother, let\u2019s say [indecipherable] backbone [indecipherable] fight to try\nand get some sense in [indecipherable] stop as much as possible, what was going on. Because we\nalso in Romania, the moment the war started, what was left of the political parties, the national\n[indecipherable] laborers and myself and the whole population of Romania, we fully agreed that\nwe have to get back the [indecipherable]. No, no problem there. No pe -- all [indecipherable]\nwhat not -- one step of our front, yeah. With the result that we ended up in Stalingrad. And that\u2019s\nhow it happened. But I -- I want to say about that that the Romanian people are not the kind who\nwant to go around and do these sort of things. It\u2019s not in their character. Whether they like the\nJews or not like them, that\u2019s beside the point. The fact is that they -- it\u2019s not in the character of\nRomania, at least at that time. [indecipherable]. And that was, in a way we had the moral backing\nfrom the feelings in Romania about this thing, that\u2019s perhaps why my mother had a little more\ncourage to fight it out, and I too. I mean, we tried to do what we could, and it\u2019s very much thanks\nto the Rabbi Safran, that used to come fairly often and tell us what was happening and as far as\nhe could make out, what was going to happen. So we did manage perhaps because of this, to say\ncertain things before something did happen. It\u2019s possible.\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: Well that part is something which was not very pleasant, because there are -- we had infor -- I\nhad information, like everybody else, through the army, that w-when the Russians came in and\ninvaded -- you know that that part of northeastern Romania, there were quite a lot of Jews living\nup there. Now, by all means, not all at all, because many had run out, but there were quite a few,\nunfortunately, that collaborated with the Soviets and some rather unpleasant things did happen\nthere also, that\u2019s quite true. Whether they were brought in by the Russians or they were actually\nones that were there, I\u2019m not very sure, but something did happen there. Not that that changed\nthe -- the mentality in Romania, no. It was just [indecipherable] about that, that\u2019s all.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Those are things we found o -- out of course after it happened. You know, that\u2019s after, I don\u2019t\nremember who it was exactly, blew up some headquarters, I think, yeah. Now, which part of the\narmy did some of those things there, I\u2019m not quite sure where the order came from, but I think it\nwas the general sort of thing given to the army. But I do know that there was one general\ncommanding around there that protested violently, and as far as I remember he was put out and\nmoved somewhere else. So there was some reaction, that I know. But we found it out probably\nsay a week, 10 days after th -- all that happened, yes. Now we -- we were all very unhappy about\nthis. But a -- but Antonescu never said a word to me on that. Again, all of these things were -- I\nwas kept in the dark.",
        "A: That the people --",
        "A: Oh. Well, we did -- we knew the general situation, yes, but I said before, these details that\nwere going on underneath and so on, that we only found out much later, after the events.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.\ncollaborated I\u2019d say, morally with them, because they also tried to push, if not directly with\nAntonescu, but around somehow. Then he was the patriarch [indecipherable] directly then with\nAntonescu. As far as I remember there were one or two of his ministers, I think, who also did not\nagree with this thing and tried to do their best. They couldn\u2019t get -- do too much because they\nwould have been immediately put out. I\u2019m not sure of their names, but I know there were some.\nAnd a few others, which I do not know exactly who, but I know there were some -- some people\nin -- among the higher class in Romania that did try to influence [indecipherable].",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, he was very close to us, with my mother, myself and my father\u2019s secretary was in\nschool with me. We used to discuss all these things and try and find the ways and means to sort\nof try and put some brakes on all this and somehow [indecipherable] the actual thing itself, I'll\nhave to read it again to see how it was, but I know we did have many, many meetings with --\nwith him when he was in c -- at court with me, so we saw him nearly every day. And whenever\nsomething like this came up we always spent several hours discussing it, yes, 1t\u2019s quite true.",
        "A: Auschnitt?",
        "A: Well, I knew him before, my father\u2019s [indecipherable] because they had [indecipherable]\nyears together with Malaxa. They\u2019re both industrialists, and they were in certain circles\n[indecipherable] but except for knowing him and meeting him, I didn\u2019t have anything to do with\nhim really. I just -- I just --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Because after the -- after my father left, all these people disappeared. They were put away, or\nleft, or something. So after that no, but before [indecipherable]",
        "A: No. Because I didn\u2019t have the occasion to meet with them. Very, very rarely. If -- and the\ndiplomats at that time almost -- you know, the Americans, the British and the others are gone.\nThe Germans, I know the ones that were more or less in that line, but we never got to talk about\nanything of that, unfortunately. We didn\u2019t have enough contact with them.",
        "A: Not that I remember about --",
        "A: -- no. Not that I remember, mm-mm.",
        "A: With who? Th --",
        "A: Ah, Balun, yes. Not specially because I used to meet all the higher clergy, but I had heard that\nhe\u2019d tried something else, but I never talked with him about it. With the patriarch yes, but not\nwith the others. Patriarch came here several times and he talked to my mother and try and find\nsomething to influence [indecipherable] the others I -- I imagine they must have said something.\nI did hear about Balun, but I never personally talked to him about that.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: You see, the situation with Antonescu and me, and all these people that he had put around me,\nexcept for [indecipherable] we -- we felt spied upon. All these other big groups, like church\ndignitary models, well we sht -- imagined that they were proper Christians, what else could I say,\nbut you know, we were really cagey about certain things because just about [indecipherable]\nAntonescu\u2019s, you didn\u2019t quite dare go and speak your mind out loudly too much. Not for us, but\nperhaps those people might start suffering afterwards. So we were very, very careful, maybe it\nwas too much, not to say -- not to be too, too aggressive, you might say. We were aggressive\nwhere -- like my mother was with Antonescu to try and get something done, but that was inside\nhere, sort of not in public. That was a very, very strange situation, because all these people\naround with big ears report immediately -- I even had several occasions when the head of my\nmilitary house here, a general, went and made a written report to Antonescu about something\nthat I talked about. So you see, we found that out after and we had to sort of pull back a little. It\nwas a -- a Situation which very difficult for people outside the world, this sort of thing to quite\nunderstand because in Britain and America [indecipherable] you breathe the freedom. We did not\ngot fr-freedom inside ourselves and our mentality what we couldn\u2019t dare go out quite like we\nwould have liked to. S-Sometimes here and there we managed, but not as much as we would\nhave liked to.",
        "A: Well, the -- we didn\u2019t at that time, I don\u2019t think we had microphones in the house. That came\nmany years after. But oh, we talked, we talked, we talked days and weeks among ourselves,\ntrying to find some [indecipherable] to impress what we -- our I -- ideas and our mentalities. And\nthat\u2019s why something did get through. Well, I can give you another example for instance,\nAntonescu insisted that I should go on the front. All right, that was probably the right thing to do\nwith our troops. But he wanted me to go to Transnistria. Was that big part of per -- part of land\nbetween the Dniester and the Bug. That\u2019s where the -- the Jews were put. Well, I refused flatly. I\nsaid, I\u2019m not going there. If you want me to go to the front, I\u2019ll take an airplane and go to\n[indecipherable] but I\u2019m not going there. He didn\u2019t like that at all, but he had to -- he swallowed\nit. So, he had unveil a few things like that. We did manage, but let\u2019s say the basic part of ruling\nthe country, and that, no.",
        "A: What? To go to Transnistria?",
        "A: Oh. To Moscow? No.",
        "A: Ah, yes. Well, he thought it was a -- because I was the head of [indecipherable] you see. He\nwas commanding it, but I was the head. It\u2019s a very awkward situation there because that was all\nthese arrangements that was left over from my father. So he found, and I suppose it was fairly\nright, that once our troops were fighting anyhow, I should show myself among them. Which was\nnat-natural, yes, but not, I don\u2019t think for any other reason, but just that, to be among them,\nwhich I did, in two or three places, in [indecipherable] and some other places in the fronts in\nRomania when it started, also. But only once or twice, not more.",
        "A: This 1s a -- it\u2019s a very long story, but I\u2019ll try and concentrate 1t somehow, because we were so\ndistressed about going into Russia, because it was none of our business. I know the Romanians --\nsee, generations, you look at our history, all our troubles that we\u2019ve had here had always come\nfrom the east. So after the Russian revolution, slowly, slowly, all these years, we saw what was\ngoing on there, so this was certainly not in our mentality. So the fact to take back Tr-\nTransylvania and -- I mean Bessarabia and Buchovina was perfectly in agreement with that, but\nnot any further. So, as things were getting from bad to worse, we\u2019d realized maybe before th-that\nthis is going to end extremely badly. We got together in a clandestine -- I sort of picked the\nwords not quite right, if you like, on the sly, with [indecipherable] and our group of some\nofficers, to try and find a way to get out of the war. And this started already in the end of \u201942, it\nwent all through \u00b043 and 44. That\u2019s how we had the -- well, there again you have Antonescu\nwhich is an awkward situation [indecipherable] with the Germans, doing everything with the\nGermans and at the same time he let people from these two parties go out to [indecipherable].\nThey let them even have, some of them that were in prison, radio transmitter. I-It\u2019s one of these\nsituations that doesn\u2019t make sense, you know? But anyhow. So we sent some people out to try\nand contact the allies, that is the American and the Great Britain, to see what we can do. We\nprobably don\u2019t want to go on with this [indecipherable] we have to get out. So these discussions\nand negotiations, recall they went on quite a long time til late \u201943 and \u201944, when Britain and\nAmerica said that we won\u2019t discuss with you any more, because you\u2019re bringing the Communist\nSocialist group in this. We were all shocked about these things because what else we gotta do?\nWe have in Romania an -- an population of 20 million people, about. We had known, about 500\nCommunist members and another 300 sympathizers. Well, what do they got to do with what --\nthis, you see? We found that out much later, that 1t was the Soviet [indecipherable] that we\nshould bring them in. So anyhow, they try and get [indecipherable], the -- Stalingrad happened.\nThe situation was getting more and more dangerously acute. So we finally decided that we must\nfind the right moment to tell Antonescu that he has to stop this war, or make an armistice. So if\nhe doesn\u2019t want to, he\u2019s got to be put out. That\u2019s not very easy to say, but, you know, their job\nwas going up and down inside Romania all the time. The Gestapo sitting here, next to the Royal\nPalace and the German commander too, recall [indecipherable]. It\u2019s not very funny, so to speak,\nyou know? We had -- just when the worst part is happening, the Russian troops were coming\nclose to our borders. The Germans funnily enough, they took two Panzer divisions from\nRomania and put them up in Poland. Maybe -- maybe you heard about all this. But that gave us a\nsort of a little breathing space, but we still couldn\u2019t do anything on our own completely, because\nwe asked for help from the allies, which we didn\u2019t even get an answer from then. And that\u2019s\nbecause of the Soviets, we knew that after. So, to bring a very long story short, when the front\ncollapsed in Bessarabia in the north, Antonescu came back from the front in the 22\u2122 or\nsomething like that, in August, through an indiscretion [indecipherable] we heard the telephone\nconversation, from his headquarters, saying that Antonescu is going back on the front on the 24\",\nI think was. Well our arrangement, which have already been done, was to call him on the 26\".\nWe asked for strong American bombardment, for the air force to come here to hit certain spots\nwhere the Germans were, and then we hear [indecipherable] 24\". So in a great rush, we\norganized the [indecipherable] for the few troops that were here, just in case, and I called him, it\nhappened to be the 23\" of August, and [indecipherable] specific date [indecipherable] just like\nthat. [indecipherable] came. And that is when everybody knows what happened. It\u2019s just that I'd\nlike to specify one thing is that it\u2019s always been said that it was a coup d\u2019etat, but it -- I don\u2019t\nmake coup d\u2019etats. I was the head of state, even if he was the [indecipherable] he was called. So\nit was perfectly on my prerogative to dismiss him. So, not a coup d\u2019etat, you could call it a\npolitical coup if you like, but that\u2019s not quite the same thing. And our greatest luck of all was\nfirst of all, surprise, because I\u2019m perfectly convinced that the Gestapo and the Secret Services\nhere knew that -- exactly that we were plotting something. The very [indecipherable]\ninformations on the political side, whereas what actually happened was the military side. And\nthat they didn\u2019t know. And that was a complete surprise, it took them completely by surprise,\nand contrary to what very many people like to say, that Romania was liberated by the Soviets,\nwhich is absolute nonsense, excuse me the word, because we finish with the Germans in 48\nhours, or four days [indecipherable]. When the Russians came here to [indecipherable] there\nwasn\u2019t single German left. We -- we managed to take too, 50,000 prisoners, including the top\nbrass, right down to the last, here and in other parts around the town. The g -- the ra -- Americans\nbombed those places and that finished the resistance, and there were one or two small pockets\nnorth, near the oil fields, which were -- that went pretty quick. And that was all. And that was the\ngreatest luck we had. I think we must have -- how shall I say? God\u2019s hand in all this, because you\nsee, another little detail was that when we did this thing in 23\" of August, the Russian advance\nstopped, or slowed. We didn\u2019t react at the time, because we didn\u2019t understand, but later we\nunderstood what that is. I personally am convinced that -- you remember in Warsaw we had a\nuprising against the Germans, and the Russians stopped the advance, they let the Germans\n[indecipherable] the whole lot, and then they came in. Well, that\u2019s what they were hoping that\nwas going to happen with us, only we had the luck to finish ourselves, without them. And that\ndisturbed them very much. But two little details which I can give you if you like, from their point\nof view is when -- in the palace it was, on the night of the 23\"\u00a2 of August, the Communist man\ncame with -- who was known later on as [indecipherable], you probably know that. He was --\ncame as another name. But -- but Toscanu, who came in straight to me in the office where I was,\nand he looked at me and said, what have you done, you\u2019ve ruined us. So I -- I was speechless. I\nmean, we\u2019d been discussing this thing for months, and I go -- he tells me that it\u2019s ruined him. We\nunderstood that later, I\u20191l come to that. When the armistice -- what we call it here, was made up\nof a commission that went to Moscow. But Toscanu let -- leaked it out after that he went to see\nsome important person 1-in Moscow. And he reports to him, he said, what have you done over\nthere, you spoiled our business, something like that. The Romanian word is different. [speaks\nRomanian]. That\u2019s how they put it. So he said, well what -- what is [indecipherable] you know,\nit\u2019s scratching down a bit from the surface, he came [indecipherable] very slow there in the\ntrucks in the northeast, waiting for this to happen, and surely they have that in mind, that the\nGermans were going to finish us and then they could come and do what they wanted straight\naway. But here is an very important thing, because I had the supports of the two main parties, the\nmain ones, of course the other two also, but the strongest support of was the army. So,\nAntonescu was commanding the army. Well, when I gave the order, there wasn\u2019t one single\ndefection. And that 1s something that a -- a -- what I heard would happen in Hungary. It seems\nthat [indecipherable] gave the same order and nothing happened. They didn\u2019t listen to him. And I\ndon\u2019t know you explained this. Is it the military discipline? Is it the oath they took? Was it\nbecause the commanders of the big units and all that, realized as much as us that the whole thing\nis finished, and that something had to be done? Or is it a combination of all that together? But\nanyhow, it worked, see. Not many people seem to understand quite all these underneath things\nthat were going on, cause all our work, political work so to speak, on the sly, that lasted well\nover a year. It came [indecipherable]. It was, of course, unpleasant for me in a sense, risking the\nwhole thing one -- one side, but Antonescu were not an enemy of mine, he was an adversary, if\nyou can call it like [indecipherable] I just put in English, because he behaved very unpleasantly\nwith us. But anyhow, it was something I had to do, nothing to do with, like many people say, my\nrevenge on Antonescu [indecipherable] that\u2019s absolute nonsense. I don\u2019t have that. That\u2019s not my\nmentality. But it was something that had to be done, and we did what we had to. And that was\nmy duty towards my country [indecipherable] that\u2019s the main thing. With God\u2019s help, we\nmanaged. What happened afterwards, that is a completely different question. That\u2019s not our\ndoing. So our hope for whoever hears this thing will have a better understanding of it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, that also came from Rabbi Safran, the information. And then we had heard that\nEichmann was around, running around Romania, and talking to Antonescu, talking to the Secret\nService here, Gestapo and what have you, you know. So that\u2019s why it was -- my mother was\nstrong about certain things, because it\u2019s hard to bring Antonescu\u2019s attention, but it was unheard\nof, the kind of thing like that, it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know, she used some arguments, I don\u2019t remember\nexactly, but that got through to him, which --",
        "A: Yeah, which was fairly unusual with Antonescu, because he was very stubborn. But maybe he\nhad a little soft point somewhere that my mother managed to get through. So he did not have\nanybody sent out t-to the German and Polish [indecipherable]. Yes, he did Transnistria, that\u2019s\ntrue, but it could have been much worse. And that was thanks to my mother [indecipherable] she\nmanaged to get this, to do something through to him. And much also, thanks to Safran, because\nhe used to come and tell us what\u2019s -- either what is happening or what he knew was going to\nhappen. So that\u2019s why we could manage a little bit to do something before.\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: Yes, now that you mention that, I remember vaguely something that my mother told me, that\nshe said that, something like that to Antonescu. Was a little bit I said before, when she tried to\nget through to him that this is a [indecipherable] all the rest of it [indecipherable] I -- I think that\nprobably when she added something about me, then -- that we would leave, or something like\nthat, I think that\u2019s true, yes. Now that you say it, I do remember that she had said something to\nme, not much detail, but just a few words to that effect, yes.",
        "A: Yes, you know, she had a very, very deep religious feeling. She was more -- let\u2019s say more\nChristian than religious, inspired by her family. A very, very strong moral sense, and these sort\nof things that were going on, just -- she could not take them. It was not just sitting still, she had\nto say something, and sometimes I heard her say to the other people some very, very -- really\nstrong things. And she didn't mince her words at all, so maybe in this particular occasion, she\nused that type of talk with Antonescu. I don\u2019t know, I wasn\u2019t there when she said that to him, or\nmaybe she -- I was there, but she said it in a corner. I didn\u2019t hear her say it, but she told me\nafterward, now that you reminded me of it.",
        "A: Well, that was the [indecipherable] surely.",
        "A: What do you [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Well, yes, we did imagine that probably something like that would happen. I mean, the\njudgement. But the whole way this was done -- you see, this 1s [indecipherable] one of these\ncunning things with the Soviets. Could I say something before that? I have been accused of many\npeople that I gave up Antonescu to the Communists, which is not true, for the simple reason, on\nthe night of the 23\" to the 24\"\" of August, we were over our heads with reorganizing the whole\nthing, making the government, naming ministers, and all the rest that went with it. And then,\nsome officers in the general staff, through one of my [indecipherable] said, you must leave\nBucharest as quick as possible, because there\u2019s going to be s -- reprisals from the Germans, as\nthe American bombing couldn\u2019t have happened before the 26\". So we all packed up in a hurry,\nand I left Bucharest at around two or half past two in the morning. We went out to the west\n[indecipherable] the country. Now, we had organized with the two parties to have a team that\u2019s\ngoing to take over Antonescu and take care of him, because we didn\u2019t want something to happen\nwith him like with Mussolini, get him out. So, unfortunately these two parties did not have\nanybody ready because it happened too quick. The only one that had a team ready of course, was\nthe Communists [indecipherable]. So around four in the morning they came to the palace and\nsaid, we have to take care of this thing, because if nothing happens, and th -- the Prime Minister I\nnamed, General Sanatescu, maybe in a little moment of weakness, let them take him. So they\ntook him to the seat of the Communist party in Bucharest, yeah, a place called [indecipherable].\nWell, I was in -- already in the western part of the country, how could I have done that, see?\nNow, the Communists, as I was coming to say 1s that they took -- when the Russians came in\nhere, of course they took him, Moscow -- Lubyan, I think, the prison. They kept him for two\nyears, about. So what happened in the meantime, the Russian troops were here, they started\nmessing up all the political parts, messing up what I was trying to do. [indecipherable] come in\nhere and smashing door in my office, [indecipherable] on the table [indecipherable] forcing me\nto put Groza on, bringing in all the Communists in \u201945. So it\u2019s not -- th-things started to\ndeteriorate, I wouldn\u2019t say very, very fast, but very clearly. So, in the meantime the population\nwas getting sort of worked up, moderately at least. So in the two years that Antonescu was hir --\nkept by the Russians, th-the people started to see that perhaps was better during Antonescu\u2019s\ntime than it was now. Which, in fact, it was, unfortunately, except for the war. So when\nAntonescu got back and put on trial, all these people were sort of said, after all, he\u2019s done\nsomething, these people, look what they\u2019re doing, see? On that I\u2019m convinced that the way they\ndid this trial, which was a farce, all of it fixed beforehand like the Nazis used to do also, like in\nRussia. It was done I thi -- I -- felt there -- m-maybe I think of it now, to -- to bring down my\nimage. See -- you see, in that time I don\u2019t know -- want to know everything that\u2019s\n[indecipherable] not with the thing behind it. Now what, constitutionally speaking, my\n[indecipherable] my situation was that no act is valid that I would sign without the counter-\nsignature of the minister. That is in our constitution because it\u2019s the minister that countersigns\nthat is responsible, not me. So, when they came out with the sentences -- now, the Minister of\nJustice at the time, Patrascanu came [indecipherable] saying -- asking for pardon, which\nAntonescu did not do. With -- his lawyer did it, but not him. So on, and then he said no, no, no,\none or two years. So constitutionally speaking, what will be my position? I could refuse that and\nsign something else, but nothing will have happened. That\u2019s one thing. And the second\ncomplication was that -- that there were Soviets behind it. I\u2019m absolutely certain [indecipherable]\nAmerican. So even if anybody would have wanted to [indecipherable] this thing, 1t would not\nhave been possible. And that\u2019s how it happened. And the way they did that was -- excuse me the\nword, was absolutely disgusting. Cause after all, he was a patriot, he loved his country, he tried\nto defeat [indecipherable] and so on. He -- politically he did it for the -- my question was what\ncould we do? [indecipherable] But his feelings were the Romanian [indecipherable]. Although he\nwas [indecipherable] things that went on, still. And the way this was done was -- was not a trial,\nthey were murderers, to put it quite frankly, and was very distressing for me and my mother and\nall the others, ever after what we been though. And the way he ended, I didn\u2019t like it, although\nprobably something had to be done, you couldn\u2019t avoid that, you know. Not quite like that, you\nknow? No matter what he did and all that, he is still [indecipherable] you know, they did\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: It\u2019s difficult to put that in one word. What could I say? Besides being sad, it was more than\nfrustrating. You see what was happening, you have your hands tied. I was here in the position\nwhich was supposed to do more, and I couldn\u2019t. You know, it\u2019s frustrating, perhaps you\u2019re not\nstrong enough, but I don\u2019t know what other words to put in it. We fought like lions and tigers.\nOur conscience, my mother and myself, is clear. We had hands tied, you know, that\u2019s why I say\nfrustrating, we were -- I don\u2019t know a better word for that, but to say it was difficult is a -- an\nunderstatement of [indecipherable] you know. That\u2019s how things happen sometimes, you know.\nYou know, they say sometimes very often that the ways of the lord are many and unpenetrable.\nWe never quite know what these meanings are, why these things happen. You try to do the best,\nsometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to be [indecipherable] you\nknow, but I mean, you know -- you -- you think about these thing, you can\u2019t put it out of your\nmind sometime. And that\u2019s one side -- all right, that\u2019s me personally, you see, but I look at\nwhat\u2019s happened to this part of Europe and my country. So that [indecipherable] on top of it.\nDifficult to explain sometime, very difficult. People say you get bitter, yes, you do get bitter\nsometimes, but if you let bitterness lead you, that means you go down the drain with it. That\u2019s\nnot the way to do thing. I mean, it\u2019s sad and it\u2019s painful, it\u2019s wounds you have, but you might --\nmight let that take you -- lead you, because then you -- then you say, I\u2019m not so good at all. So\nwe tried at least. I -- I hope I managed to [indecipherable].",
        "A: Well, I can perhaps add something, that with all these awful things that have been happening\nsince the war, especially in this part of Europe and Romania, being on a program like yours now,\nI do hope that maybe I can -- I brought some light into some events, to explain certain things\nwhich I\u2019m quite convinced that very few people know. [indecipherable] and the thing happens as\n[indecipherable] you see events, you start making up your mind. Make decisions, or have ideas\nwhich are not actually based on the full knowledge of what\u2019s what. And that is what I\u2019ve been\ntrying all these years to sort of bring out. To stop looking at the surface of things, which are bad\nor good, whatever it is. What -- the point it, why have we got to a certain point if you don\u2019t\nunderstand what\u2019s happened underneath. And that is a sort of grudge I have against many people,\nthat they dis -- they discuss the -- the signs on the surface, without bothering to go underneath\nand find out why, what are the causes of these things, and to make -- to try and get that thing\nhealed up. And then the rest should follow. You know, they say sometimes that it\u2019s a very -- how\nmost people cut the branches [indecipherable] off, but a very, very few that look at the\nunderneath of the -- at the roots of it. And that\u2019s what I wish so much, with all this modern world\nnow and the people that -- that -- you know, everything\u2019s [indecipherable] all over the place now,\nto -- to try and understand why did certain things happen, and the tragedy of the whole -- what\nwill you say, let\u2019s say in this part of Europe, a hundred million people here. And unfortunately\nit\u2019s happening in other places also now. And we feel terrible when we see these thing\n[indecipherable] here, of course, because it\u2019s my country, but when you see other things that\nhappen -- look at New York now. Which just -- I don\u2019t know. We -- we have another Romanian\nsaying that says, when God wants to mock the people, they take [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t like\nthat, but when you see what\u2019s happening in the world these days, you really don\u2019t know. You\ncan\u2019t understand any more, sometime. Anyhow, I that what -- I mean they\u2019re saying now that\nthey\u2019Il be a better understanding, at least as far as we are concerned, what happened. And I thank\nyou very much for it.\n"
