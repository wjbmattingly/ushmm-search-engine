        "A: Yes. But a\u2014 my parish was a church, holy \u2014 holy \u2014 the Alexander Church in\nThree Crosses Square in Warsaw.",
        "Q: Is that the center of town, or is that a little bit outside the center?",
        "A: I would say it\u2019s close to center, yes, close to center, because the Royal Tr-Track\nstarts from Wilanow, all the way to the old town in Warsaw, but this is part of that\nsection that covers that distance. They call it the Royal Track [speaks Polish] This\nis in Polish. But Nowy Swiat, the New World, actually started from that square,\nThree Crosses Square.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "Q: Okay. What kind of a building did you grow up in? Was it a huge apartment\nbuilding, or single family \u2014",

        "A: Yes, it was a modern place. Warsaw is a \u2014 as it grew, during the time after the\nfirst World War, this was under the Tsarist Russia.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: But then, when Pilsudski came to power in 1918, Poland regained her\nindependence, after 123 years of nonexistence, so to speak, of \u2014 Poland only\nexisted only as partitions.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Poland was divided actually into three segments, and this was Prussian, Russian,\nand Austro-Hungary. So actually, Warsaw was part of the Tsarist domain.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "Q: So, when Poland became independent again, and the three parts became united,\n123 years is still quite a while, because it 1s more than living memory. Several\ngenerations are comprised in that. Had people changed very much? Could you\nunderstand one another \u2014 I mean psychologically?",
        "A: Well, there were different, let\u2019s say, frames that the Poles grew, that say,\nGermans were very anti-Polish, and Hakatay(ph) was the organization that even\nforbade the Polish language to be used at schools.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Russians were also trying to bring their influence to the point. And then, the\nmost tolerant part was the au \u2014 aus \u2014 aus \u2014 aus \u2014",
        "Q: Austro-Hungarian?",
        "A: Aust-Austro-Hungarian part. Yeah, so that was was a \u2014 a little better for\nschooling, secondary schooling and so on. And let\u2019s say Poles from Galicia?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know, they were a little different in character than let\u2019s say, Poles that were\nslightly Germanized under the ger \u2014 the Prussian operation, and the Poles living\nunder the Russians. So, this process of fusing us together was actually a great, let\u2019s\nsay, accomplishment of the Catholic church, because they mostly \u2014 the Poles were\nof Catholic faith, and that was \u2014 the church was actually the strongest party that\nJanuary 27, 2015\nexisted in \u2014 in Poland. But then when Pilsudski became the Marshall of Poland \u2014\nthis was in 1914, and officially Poland regained her independence in the *18, he\nwas assigned a task of, let\u2019s say, fusing th-the different characters of people that\ngrew in different segments of the country.",
        "Q: So what were some of the \u2014 I mean, just curiosity \u2014 you say the Galicianas are\ndifferent than those who were \u2014 and Galicia was under Austro-Hungarian rule?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What kind of character did the one have in comparison to the other two, and so\non?",
        "A: Let\u2019s say the \u2014 the \u2014 let\u2019s say the Germans, Poles, from the German part, from\nthe Prussian part were, let\u2019s say, a little bit more like Germans, very orderly, let\u2019s\nsay the work that they accomplished was more thorough than let\u2019s say the group of\nPoles in the east, under the Russians. And let\u2019s say the Galicians were also a little\nbit closer to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to German influence. But all together, united by the faith,\nyou know, we were very quickly re \u2014 reburn(ph).",
        "Q: Reborn.",
        "A: Reborn, yes, reborn.",
        "Q: Yeah. And tell me a little bit \u2014 so, there are questions that I usually ask people\nwho were in the eastern territories, that don\u2019t apply here, but I will just bring them\nJanuary 27, 2015\nup. And that is, one of the \u2014 the issues that I want to find out about is the degree of\nmodernization. So there I will ask, you know, did anybody have a radio? Did\nanybody have a telephone? Did they ha \u2014 did \u2014 were cars \u2014 automobiles common to\nsee? Well, in the center of Warsaw, I would assume that these things \u2014",
        "A: Yes, the Poland was called \u2014 they called Poland at that time \u2014 the Warsaw was\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the Paris of the east.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That was \u2014 city was about one point two million people. And there \u2014 there was,\nlet\u2019s see, very large Jewish diaspora in Warsaw. The diaspora was about 400,00, so\nevery third Warsawian was of \u2014 of Hebrew faith. Some of them got more or less\nPoland-ized, then the \u2014 they were, let\u2019s say, getting with the Poles closer, and the\nother ones were dep \u2014 Poland was free, as far as the religion is concerned, so they\nhad their ow-own synagogues, they had their own traditions, and they grew in the\nenvironment that their predecessors are sort of giving them. But \u2014",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 mm-hm, go ahead.",
        "A: And Warsaw \u2014 Warsaw was specially \u2014 some districts of Warsaw were\npredominantly Jewish. The most famous synagogue was the synagogue on\nTlomackie Street. Now, if you ever visit Warsaw at that area, was \u2014 actually is a\nJanuary 27, 2015\nskyscraper about 40 stories high, a blue building that was, let\u2019s say built after the\nwar, in that area where that synagogue was.",
        "Q: Is there \u2014",
        "A: And this was the most beautiful synagogue in the world, the largest, and \u2014",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Even though you weren\u2019t Jewish \u2014 you aren\u2019t Jewish, did you ever visit inside?\nDid you ever \u2014",
        "A: Oh, my father \u2014 my father was always very, how should I say, trying to show me\nthe \u2014 the cerkiew, which is the Orthodox church, we had one big chur \u2014 cerkiew in\nPraga. Because Praga is not the Czech Prague, it\u2019s a\u2014 Warsaw was on the left\nbank of the Vistula, looking north was Warszawa, was Warsaw. On the right side\nwas Praga.",
        "Q: So it was like a \u2014 a district of Warsaw, a section of Warsaw.",
        "A: Well yes, th-the eastern part, you know, the bridges connected the city together.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And there was a cerkiew, there was the Russian Orthodox church. And very\noften he took me over to show the \u2014 how they pray, and how they, let\u2019s say,\ncelebrate their different religious \u2014\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "Q: Services.",
        "A: \u2014 services. And there was a \u2014 in \u2014 1n Warsaw I visited synagogues from time to\ntime. Actually in my classroom, I had many Jewish friends that especially \u2014\nThursdays were the days when they were teaching us religion; history of the\nCatholic churches, or at that time the \u2014 the Jewish minority was excused, they could\ntake a walk into the park, play soccer, or whatever. [phone ringing]",
        "Q: Let\u2019s cut. [break] So, you were talking about something very interesting.",
        "A: Th-Thursday \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, hang on a minute, let\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah, you were talking about Thursdays at school.",
        "A: Thursdays at school. So, the \u2014 let\u2019s say, students, pupils that were excused for\nthat day, of Jewish faith, you know, so very often I \u2014 I \u2014 I joined them just to be out\nin the park, and play soccer. That \u2014",
        "Q: I was \u2014 yeah, I was going to say, weren\u2019t you jealous of those kids who didn\u2019t\nhave to go to class?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, you know, so I was what, eight, seven \u2014 seven, eight years old, so at\nthat time it was okay.",
        "Q: So, did you ever visit this beautiful synagogue you told us \u2014\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Yes \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 when you were [indecipherable]",
        "A: \u2014 I visited that synagogue. Yes, this was in 1936 or \u201937, yeah, with my father.",
        "Q: So you were bor \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you have \u2014",
        "A: Nowadays \u2014 nowadays they have Tlomackie Street, and there is a \u2014 a Jewish,\nlet\u2019s say library, and \u2014 and a small museum, because the main museum that was\nerected just th \u2014 one year ago, open up, it\u2019s one of the most beautiful, modern\nmuseum, they spend a lot of money. And I think the \u2014 the help came from the good,\nold U.S.A., you know, so \u2014 and then fa \u2014 I think contribution was also made by the\nPolish president to build in the area where they have nalewki(ph), and that was that\ninfamous Umschlagplatz. That\u2019s was the \u2014 the Jews were loaded on the trucks, and\ntaken over to Treblinka. So this was ex-Jewish district.",
        "Q: So, was the Umschlagplatz within the space of the ghetto, or outside of it?",
        "A: Umschlagplatz was on the periphery of ghetto, you know, but it was inside,\ninside yes.",
        "Q: It was inside, but at the edge.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: And the railroad tracks at Stawki, there were, I think five tracks that the trains\nwere coming in, because there was a \u2014 sort of like a 10 \u2014 10,000 \u2014 10,000 a day\nwere trying to unload from Warsaw and send them to Treblinka.",
        "Q: So when \u2014 when \u2014 when Jews were being loaded onto \u2014 you\u2019d say trucks, and\nthen to trains, or how would they be \u2014",
        "A: No, they were \u2014 they were \u2014 they were walking toward the tra \u2014 Umschlagplatz.\nThere were no trucks actually in the ghetto, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They were streetcars, but they were not used. Normally the cruel police force\nwere the actually Jewish police, because they were obliged to bring the contingent\nof so many Jews for that particular day, that were shipped to Treblinka.",
        "Q: So they would go by foot to the Umschlagplatz?",
        "A: But foot, with \u2014 they were normally told that they are going east for some places\nthat they will be employed and work for the upkeep of their own lives, and so on.\nSo they were \u2014 they were lied about this designation of Treblinka, because this was\nthe end of the trip, so to speak, of \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah. And it was by train?",
        "A: By train, yes.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "Q: By train. Now, you say this was within the ghetto \u2014 the ghetto itself, but on the\nperiphery. Did you ever see anything like this, were you able to see it?",
        "A: No, I - let\u2019s see. I had my school located \u2014 let\u2019s start from a different point.\nThere were two ghettos actually. There was small ghetto, south of Wolska Street,\nwhich was main thoroughfare through Warsaw.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And there was a large ghetto north of it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And normally they build a wall around small and large ghettos, so this whole\narea was isolated. Along the Wolska Street, between Wronia and Zelazna, this\nwas a point where two ghettos were \u2014",
        "Q: Connected?",
        "A: \u2014 connected, yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And they were also at the place like Zelazna and Chlodna, this was a bridge\nthat was connecting small ghetto with large ghetto. That bridge you could see in\nthat film of pianist, by \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, by Roman Polanski.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Polanski, yes. This bridge I remember well, and that portion of wall, and the\nmain gate to the ghetto, I remember very well because my school was like \u2014 during\nthe occupation, you know, the secondary schooling was forbidden for the Poles.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Hitler wanted us only to know how to count to a hundred, write and read, and\nthat\u2019s it. And we were designated for what they call konnektenvolk(ph).",
        "Q: Konnektenvolk(ph).",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So this was \u2014 this was school located \u2014 trade school, actually, this was trade\nschool, because no secondary schools were allowed. But in that trade school we had\nschooling, secondary schooling undercover, we say. We used to say yeah, pod\npokrywka gymnasium pod pokrywka. The secondary school was under the cover.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So even we had the universities and polytechnics, everything was unofficially\nforbidden, but underground was acting. So, going to my trade school \u2014 actually, this\nwas the first class of gymnasium we call it, high school, I was passing the main gate",
        "Q: Of the ghetto.",
        "A: \u2014 and actually right by that bridge, what you saw in that film.",

        "Q: So you would see over the wall?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What were the things that you were seeing?",
        "A: Well, the buildings. The street was divided by the wall, and these houses there,\nthe \u2014 cause ghetto was overpopulated. At that time, some of the houses are already\nempty, because that process of sending Jews to the death chambers in Treblinka\nwas \u2014 vacated a lot of space, leaving space in the buildings. So that was neglected.\nOn top of the wall, actually, the Germans set up machine guns. There were, actually\nat that time, some of the people that came from the ukra \u2014 Ukraine \u2014 Ukrainians\nJanuary 27, 2015\nwere guarding the Jewish ghetto, and Latvians were guarding the Jewish ghetto.\nAnd the Germans were in the supervisory positions.",

        "Q: But do you remember anything from the inside of that synagogue, of what it\nlooked like to you?",
        "A: Not the \u2014 the \u2014 the altar, the decorations, the building, the walls. I have a picture,\nbut not too vivid, you know.",

I was always, let\u2019s say,\ncurious of what the other people, how they pray, what they do, and how the\nceremony goes, you \u2014 so I \u2014 I remember when I visited cerkiew, which was that\nOrthodox. The only thing that was \u2014 that I remember was the \u2014 a lot of herbs, and\nholy \u2014",

That was a\ntextile factory, there was some mechanical shop, and the top was some chemical\nestablishment there. So we didn\u2019t have many neighbors, you say civilians, because\nwe were part of that industrial complex. My mother was running a little cafeteria,\nfor one place, and the father was working for the Polska Linia Samochodowa,\nwhich was the transportation company.",

        "Q: Well, let\u2019s see, and we\u2019ll see.",
        "A: When the Germans caught me at the main railroad station, because we had some\nbusiness with the Hungarians, or Romanians and Germans, that was going to the\neastern front, you know, to \u2014 for a \u2014 for a cover-up I used to be selling cigarettes or\nnewspapers, something, because we deal \u2014 we dealt with the Hungarians and the\nother soldiers for schnapps. We could buy some good material for our, let\u2019s say\nweapons, even pistols and so on. So when I was arrested by the Germans, I was\nyoung \u2014 12 years \u2014 or 12 - 13 years old, and they put me in the prison on\nJanuary 27, 2015\nPoznanska Street, and I \u2014 they kept me there \u2014 because Germans actually gave to\nthe blue policeman. We had Polish police. On the Polish side they were in blue\nuniforms, and the German gendarmerie, that was the German police that actually\ncooperated with the Polish policemen. And they gave me, as a youngster to the blue\npolicemen, and they put me in jail. So I spend there a few weeks, and what\nhappened is that I\u2014 I was young, undernourished, and I had some beginning of\ntuberculosis. So the Polish underground, when they saw what was happening to me,\nthey sent me to Olenika(ph), which was the sanitortum near Otwock.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And there I was, let\u2019s say, for a few months, to kill that \u2014",
        "Q: Tuberculosis?",
        "A: \u2014 beginning to \u2014 tuberculosis, I had sha \u2014 shadows in my lungs that were the sarg\n\u2014 larger size of a plum or an apple. And this finally was arrested and calcinations\nwere formed, and I didn\u2019t have an open tuberculosis. So they saved my life, so to\nspeak. Tu-Tuberculosis was, during the time of occupation of Poland was a very\ncommon problem, because people are undernourished, and \u2014",
        "Q: Was it a killer?",

        "A: Yes, yes. No, the \u2014 the \u2014 it was very close to epidemic, because we were\nreceiving about 1500 calories, and that was not enough to \u2014 to \u2014 to die, and not\nenough to live normal life.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So the Poles were starving, but the poor Jewish guys, they were even worse,\nbecause they were getting about 500 calories a day. So they were destined for death.",
        "Q: Yeah. Okay, let\u2019s return prewar. Was your family very religious?",
        "A: I would say yes; Father especially, and my mother. And nearby \u2014 I mentioned\nthe church where I was baptized; this was the Saint Alexander church on Three\nCrosses Square in Warsaw. But when we moved, we belonged to Saint\nClement\u2019s.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: These were the \u2014 oh, I forgot that \u2014 maybe it will come back to me, but the\nparish nearby, we were members of that parish, and during the uprising, and during\nJanuary 27, 2015\nthe occupation, we attended the masses regularly on \u2014 on Sunday. And that was\nonly couple blocks away. This church actually, I found that was damaged, yes,\ndamaged, but it was rebuilt, and it\u2019s still existing in.",
        "Q: So did you go weekly to \u2014 was it a\u2014 was it a family tradition to go to mass every\nSunday?",
        "A: Yes, every Sunday we went to mass, and \u2014 at this church, or church \u2014\nBoromeusz Church. This was close to the main entrance to the ghetto. This was at\nthe point where I mentioned street Zelazna. Actually at that point Wlodna and\nElektoralna, that was a Y, sort of branches, that the church was in that triangle.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: And this was something that I had to be there on Sundays, and some other big\nholidays, because that was sort of obligatory from the school.",
        "Q: Ah. So \u2014",
        "A: So the school \u2014 the schools\u2019 students, pupils, were going to that special mass for\nthe students.",
        "Q: And that would be on a school day, or on Sundays?",
        "A: This was Sundays, and major holidays \u2014",
        "Q: Holidays.",
        "A: \u2014 yeah.\nJanuary 27, 2015",

        "A: Before the war, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah, before the war. And you said that you had \u2014 it was a public school that\nyou went to?",
        "A: Yes, the school was number 100. It was a new building, built during the 20 years\nof Polish independence, and I remember it very well, because that was a walking\ndistance. And school was very clean, well illuminated. We used to have a very soft\n\u2014 soft slippers that we couldn\u2019t bring the shoes normally from the street, with the\nhard soles that would damage shining floors. Nice windows, big windows;\nclassrooms were spacious. So that was a nice time that I had during the time til\n1939 \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 attending. And I finished, I think the fourth grade.",
        "Q: In \u2014 and \u2014 by 1939.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. Tell me a little bit about your mother and father\u2019s own family histories.\nHad they, either of them finished university, or gone to university?\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: No, my \u2014 no, they didn\u2019t have a higher education. My mother completed high\nschool; and Father, he was sort of a business-minded man, and he did not get\nuniversity studies behind him. But he was, let\u2019s say a junior college, education-\nwise. And he served, during the time when Poland was still partitioned, he served\nin the Austria army, so his German was excellent, and partially I inherited the\nGerman language from him. So he was \u2014 during the occupation, he was employed\nby the Ostbahn. Ostbahn, east railroad \u2014 the Germans had westbound, eastbound,\nReich-bahn. So this was part of the Reich-bahn, and he was, as an interpreter,\nworking at the main central station there.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s quite an interesting position to have.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So you were \u2014 the main central station for the ost, for the east.",
        "A: For the east.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes. This was located on the Jerusalem alley, and it\u2019s still there, but the\nbuilding was completely, let\u2019s say, destroyed, but that area was used for the new\nstructure that is the center Warsaw station. Very nice building, near \u2014 near that \u2014\nJanuary 27, 2015\nwhat do they call it, the gift from Stalin, near the palace of the \u2014 the Stalin palace,\nbut this was \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, I think I know the building you mean.",
        "A: \u2014a-\u2014a left \u2014 did you see that building?",
        "Q: It looks almost like the one at mo \u2014 in Moscow, with similar structure.",
        "A: Yes. This was a style that the Russians ca \u2014 kept, that they preserved building the\nstructures according to the drawings that they made for their university in Moscow.\nSo the Alexanderplatz in Berlin was similar to this. Well, this was despised by the\nPoles, th-they used to laugh. I remember the first visit in Poland in 1950 \u2014 \u201959,\nwhen driving with the guy that was a taxi driver, he asked me, says, the best view of\nWarsaw? You know where you get the best view of Warsaw\u2019? He says, the best\nview of Warsaw you get from the palace. I said, oh yeah? Why is that so? Well,\ncause when you in the palace, you don\u2019t see the palace. You know, so \u2014",
        "Q: Even the taxi driver.",
        "A: Even the taxi driver, yes. He says that he \u2014 he was going a little further, he says,\neven that antenna that they built \u2014 they built that was a protective weapon that no\nPole could climb up on the very top and do things, dirty things. They hated the\nstructure, you know. It\u2019s still existing. It\u2019s like a monument of the Russian\noccupation of \u2014 of Poland. And this was a gift.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "Q: I see. I see.",
        "A: My wife re \u2014 remembers this vividly because she was witnessing the erection of\nthat \u2014",
        "Q: The construction of this building.",
        "A: The construction of this, yes. I saw it finished. Now it\u2019s dark. When \u2014 when you\nsee when the two systems meet, the \u2014 th-the monument of the communism, versus\nagainst the \u2014 the \u2014 the capitalism, so to speak, of the skyscrapers, you know, na \u2014\nmodern buildings. It is \u2014 it 1s a contrast that you cannot simply understand, you\nknow, how the Russians could build such a awful structure in the midst of that\nmodern new Warsaw that is growing \u2014 growing up.",
        "Q: Well, you know, in \u2014 architecture has its own stories. In architecture and\ngeography too. You know, geography you would think is such a neutral subject, but\ngeography encompasses maps and street names, and those changed so often,\nbecause of whatever political force happened to be in power in this part of the\nworld. Okay \u2014",
        "A: You can \u2014 you can actually take a \u2014 Poland as an example of a migratory nation,\nbecause when you look \u2014 when you look at the history, the union with Lithuania\nwas what, 15\"\" century, when we were one country, Poland was actually the largest\nJanuary 27, 2015\nstate in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u20141n Europe; from the Black Sea all the way to the black \u2014 Baltic\nSea.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: And the borders were changing so much, going eastbound, westbound, and that\u2019s\nwhy the Poles are of some different characters, because the days of occupation\nchanged the people. And since the borders moved, the people moved.",
        "Q: That\u2019s true, that\u2019s true.",
        "A: That was tr-tragic in a way, but when Polish borders were set up in Yalta,\nPotsdam and other places where the destiny of Poland was set up with the\nmatches, they were laughing that Churchill, Stalin and President Roosevelt, they\nwere setting up the borders of Poland with the m \u2014",
        "Q: With the matchsticks.",
        "A: \u2014 matches. And then the famous Curzon line, the [indecipherable] of Curzon,\nyou know, that divided the portion of eastern part of Poland, and the western part\nof Poland.",
        "Q: You mean during the war itself?",
        "A: During the war itself. In 1939 \u2014 we jumping from subject to subject.",
        "Q: We are. It\u2019s okay.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: But that mixture maybe will give you a little better idea what \u2014 that time, in \u00b039,\nthere was that infamous pact of Ribbentrop-Molotov. Thirty-nine when the Russia\nwas befriended with Reich.",
        "Q: With Germany.",
        "A: With Germany. And this was \u2014 we call it the fourth partition of Poland, and the\nborder line, Curzon Line actually came into picture. Because now \u2014 it \u2014 there is a\ncertain similarity what they doing now in Ukraine, you know, when they coming to\nprotect their brothers and sisters, living in the administrative territory of eastern\nUkraine, that was happening in the eastern part of Poland. They came to resc \u2014\nrescue the Ukrainians minority that lived there, and the Byelorussian minority, and\nall the part of north \u2014 northeast part of Poland that\u2019s Lithuania nowadays. They\nwere trying to save their people from the Polish tyranny. So the borders were\nmoving and then we sometimes laughed that we have Poles with so many German\nnames, and we have Germans with the Polish names.",
        "Q: It got all mixed.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It got all mixed, and \u2014 through all of these chess players \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 you know, on the \u2014 on the field. Let\u2019s go back again.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back again. In the \u2014 at \u2014 I wanted to find out more about your families\u2019\nhistories. That is, what kind of a family did your father come from, and that your\nmother came from?",
        "A: They were, let\u2019s say Father, his brother owned a larger piece of land near Kielce.\nAnd Mother was living in that area, before they moved into Warsaw.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So they were rather the agricultural, farmer \u2014 farmers.",
        "Q: Farm people.",
        "A: Yes. And when they lived in Warsaw, they changed their style completely.",
        "Q: Oh, did they?",
        "A: Yes, because you know, as they came from the smaller \u2014 smaller places, into big\ncity like this. So this was a major change \u2014",
        "Q: Did they feel \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in their style of life.",
        "Q: Did they feel \u2014 were they comfortable in Warsaw \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 did they feel good \u2014\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Sister, for instance \u2014 we di \u2014 we were not rich, but we were pretty well-to-do,\nand Sister was going to ballet school. I was going to the normal public school, but\nlater on, during the occupation, they had to dish out money so I could go to the\nsecondary school, unofficial \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 secondary schools. And the sister was much older than I am, so she was\ncontinuing that \u2014 let\u2019s say musical education that she wanted to finish, but that was\nvery difficult. Difficult because living conditions were very \u2014",
        "Q: Hard.",
        "A: Living conditions were rough, very rough. People were rather concerned how to\nsurvive from day to day. They couldn\u2019t have any plans at all.",
        "Q: Yeah. You \u2014",
        "A: I remember as a kid I used to say goodbye to my parents going to school,\nbecause I didn\u2019t know whether I \u2014 I am gonna come back, you know, in peace. So\ncity was living in a very, how shall I say, warlike atmosphere. Strit \u2014 streets were\nnot safe. Streetcars were \u2014 very often street was blocked, and people were taken by\nforce into the \u2014 the trucks, and put into the camp to be sent to work in \u2014 in \u2014 in\nGermany. Slave laborers.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "Q: So, it just \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t know, when you were on the streetcar, whether or not\nyou ll make your destination.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Is that what you\u2019re saying?",
        "A: Yes. Nervousness. Nervousness was a controlled \u2014 a very rude way by the\nGermans. At the beginning \u2014 that was \u2014 I\u2019m speaking of 1940, very rough winter in\nWarsaw, because it was very cold, and then \u201942 \u2014 42, \u201941 \u2014 \u00b042, when the\nseparation of the population was getting to the point that they build the ghetto, and\nthey separated Aryan population from the Jewish population. And then \u201943, the\nconditions started changing where that German behavior, after Korksk(ph) and\nStalingrad changed their attitude. They sort of mellowed down, you know, that\u2019s \u2014\nthat greeting of high Hitler, with the hand raised very high, changed a little bit like,\njust in case we lose, high Hitler with the little \u2014 smaller \u2014 smaller gesture. We were\nlaughing, and \u2014 but we sensed that was a city that was witnessing the change in the\nGerman attitude. Stalingrad was a major \u2014 major change in the German bravura,\nthe German spirit of vic-victory for any cost.",
        "Q: So, I'll ask one question about this, and then I want to go back still, to pre-war.\nDid people know about German losses in Stalingrad? I mean, after all, they\ncontrolled the media.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, they \u2014 let\u2019s say, the German propaganda was very strong when the\nOperation Barbarossa starts. You know, they named \u2014 the code name Barbarossa\nwas the time when the Germans attacked Russia. This was a sh \u2014 shock.",
        "Q: So you mean June 21*?",

        "Q: Don\u2019t talk about that, just about \u2014 I \u2014 what I wanted to know about is, how much\ndid people know about the Battle of Stalingrad in \u201943?",
        "A: Stalingrad. Let\u2019s say, we drew conclusions what was happening in the eastern\nfront, when we saw trains going through Warsaw with the German sol \u2014 German\nsoldiers, you know, that no ears, no noses, no hands, because of the frostbites, from\nthat famous Russian general. You know the fis \u2014 famous Russian general? What\nwas his name?",

And they knew what\nwas happening. Plus, we were getting the news from the BBC.",
        "Q: That\u2019s interesting.",

        "A: Oh yeah, Stefcha(ph) \u2014 Stefcha(ph) \u2014 Steffa(ph) \u2014 Steffa(ph) was the girl that\nwas actually sort of taking care of us \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A:\u2014my sister and I.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay, so before the war, you had a radio.",
        "A: We had the radio, we had telephone. That was not the modern, you know,\niPhone like we have here. That was on the wall, with that little receiver that you are\nputting in, the dial \u2014",
        "Q: You mean, your phone \u2014 your phone wasn\u2019t a map service, and wasn\u2019t a laundry\nservice, and wasn\u2019t a camera as well, like the iPhone is?",
        "A: No. No, we could call, let\u2019s say, the operator for a weather report, or things like\nthat, but that was the long way.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right. So \u2014 so you had a phone, you had a radio. Did your parents own an\nautomobile?",
        "A: Let\u2019s say, that was time when we had a couple cars that we rented for tax1.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: For taxi, you know. So later on, when there was no gas, there were no need for\ncars.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "Q: So you rent \u2014 your family rented cars out and used them as taxis to make\nmoney? Is this what there was \u2014",
        "A: No, it\u2019s a\u2014 when that firm actually was very close to \u2014 to bankruptcy, you know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Father received this, I should say, a premium, like, that were two cars that he\nrepaired, and then he rented out to the guys that were taxi drivers.",
        "Q: Oh, and so he got some \u2014 some \u2014 he got some percentage of that.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: I see. So the firm that he was working in, which was \u2014 tell me again, it was \u2014",
        "A: First Galena(ph) Samochodowa.",
        "Q: And that was to do parts for buses, right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: To buy parts for \u2014",
        "A: These were \u2014 these were the intercity buses. Not like a Greyhound, or \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Much smaller, but they were going from city to city, alongside the railroads.",
        "Q: And did that \u2014 did that company go bankrupt before the war?",
        "A: No, no, this lasted til 1939. Actually, some of the buses, some of the cars were\nrequisitioned by the army when the war started in 1939.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I remember a visit of some high ranking officers that came over, and they were\ndiscussing what cars can be used by the army.",
        "Q: The Polish army.",
        "A: Polish army, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay, now I want to turn to another subject; again, before the war. What\nwere the kinds of conversations that you would have around the dinner table with\nyour family? Did you talk about political events, and political things?",
        "A: Say Poles all together, they have, let\u2019s say, great interest in \u2014 in politics. And\nespecially since Poland was exposed to all different, let\u2019s say pressures from the\nwest, from the east. Discussions at the table, and friends of my father came over.\nThey were officers from the \u2014 active officers from the \u2014 from the Polish army. They\ndiscuss at the table the issues of Poland being such a strong country, that they \u2014 the\nGermans will attack Poland, we will resist, and then so on, and so on. So the talks\nwere on the subject of military efforts, and \u2014 an-and Europe at that time was sort of\nsensing oncoming second World War. So these discussions, I remember that the\nfather was discussing this. But when we had gatherings that my mother\u2019s brother\ncoming from Otwock for \u2014 sometimes for a weekends, or summertime, so we were\ngoing there, discussions were different, you know. Our schooling time, and then\nJanuary 27, 2015\nchanges in the economy that were improving little by little; because you know,\ncountry was actually devastated during the first World War, and the oppressors, the\noccupiers, they \u2014 they were taking their share. So we could not develop, just like\nwestern Europe developed free, and that momentum that they had could not be,\nlet\u2019s say, shown 1n the Polish economy.",
        "Q: Well, here\u2019s a question that\u2019s a bit provocative, and I know in advance that it is.\nBut there is the image, that when the war started, and Germany crossed the border\ninto Poland with tanks, they were met by cavalry officers on horses and swords.",
        "A: This is \u2014 actually, this was a false story. Some of the big cavalry units were\nsurrounded by the German, let\u2019s say motorized units. And when they locked in, they\ntried to escape, but they were not, let\u2019s say, crazy enough to attack with the lances\nagainst the German tanks, no.",
        "Q: Okay. I mean \u2014 I-I mean more that Poland was so unprepared that it didn\u2019t have\ntanks of its own, that it didn\u2019t have modern military equipment. Is that so, or is that\na falsehood?",
        "A: That\u2019s falsehood. We had air force.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s a\u2014 not as modern as the Germans had, but very effective.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: We had our own design, let\u2019s say WSK Kalisz and that PZL-11. These airplanes\nwere not large in numbers, because this was a developing industry in Poland, the\naircraft industry. The tanks, they were not built in Poland, but we had tanks vic \u2014\nVickers tanks from \u2014 imported from England. And we had the motorized units. We\nhad the motorized brigade that actually later on, became the first armored division\nin the west, under General Maczek, af you \u2014 if you heard.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Okay.",
        "A: And when \u2014 when Poland army was formed, let\u2019s say we had so much\nexperience with the enemies that the army was indoctrinated well enough to be\nspiritually strong. Equipment-wise, we were inferiors to Germans. We were\ninferiors \u2014 spirit of fighting was much stronger maybe that the Germans had.",
        "Q: So the morale was high.",
        "A: Morality of the army was high, morale was high, but the equipment was inferior,\ninferior. But very effective. Because remember, when the \u2014 when the Germans\nattacked us from three directions, actually; from East Prussia, going south; from\nthe Reich, they were going east, and from the south, they were attacked through \u2014\nCzechoslovakia was already annexed by the \u2014 by the Reich, by the Germany.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Right.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: And at that time also Slovakia joined the German camp. So we had some \u2014 part\nof the invasion of ch \u2014 Slovaks into Poland, the German armies, and then armies\nfrom the East Prussia that was coming in.",
        "Q: And that was all September 1\u201c, 1939?",
        "A: Yes, September 1939. So, wi\u2014 most of our defenses were directed against the\nGermans coming from the west. We did not expect the Russians will stab us in the\nback on the 17\" of September. They attacked to come and free their people that\nwere living in Kresy, which was the Volhynia, Polesie, Podole, and the\nNowogrdodek, closer to Lithuania, as we were. So Kresy were liberated, quotation\nmarks, by the \u2014 by the Russians.",
        "Q: So there was no knowledge of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in Poland\u2019?",
        "A: In Poland\u201d",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, there was knowledge, yes, we knew, we knew about it, yes.",
        "Q: At the time?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Because it was signed one week before the war started.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Yes, but we knew it. Don\u2019t forget that the Polish dwika(ph), which was the, let\u2019s\nsay, compared to \u2014 to FBI or CIA, the Secret Service, and so on, we had a very\ngood sensors everywhere in \u2014 in \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 in Prussia and in \u2014 in Germany, especially in Berlin. And \u2014",
        "Q: So you had intelligence reports, the con \u2014 the government had intelligence\nreports.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. But then \u2014",
        "A: And these were prior to the \u2014 prior to the outbreak of the war. We were pretty\nwell advanced in decoding German messages. \u201cEnigma\u201d is \u2014 that\u2019s the movie\nnowadays \u2014",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: \u2014 going on, I don\u2019t know if you see it. I didn\u2019t see it, but I would like to see it,\nbecause there was a great contribution to the victory of the allied effort during the\nsecond World War, by giving the \u2014 giving the English and French the secrets of\nenigma. What was started was the getting in, was the mathematical school that the\nPoles attended in 1932. And the connections that the Germany had with East\nPrussia was via the enigma. They were sending codes, and all different secret\nJanuary 27, 2015\ninformation. So the Poles started getting interest in it, and Zygalski, Rafski(ph),\nand there was a third name that I forgot, but the \u2014 these were the three codebreakers,\nlater on that they work for the Polish secret service. And this was in July 1939,\nwhen from England, Poland signed the agreement to be defended by England and\nFrance, in case that we get attacked by the Germans. But anyway, going back to\nthat point that the British paid a visit to Poland, Pery(ph) was the name of the town\nin the suburb of Warsaw. Poles had copied two machines that were intercepted.\nWhen they send this to East Prussia, it went via Warsaw. So the secret service\ntook the machines, dismembered them, photographed them, do everything possible\nto reproduce the machines. And some of the copies were so identical that the\nGermans wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize which is the original, which is the copy.",
        "Q: Oh, so then you started fueling disinformation?",
        "A: Yeah, so when they came over, the British, Knox and Denniston, I think, they\nwere two gentlemen, and the Frenchman, Bernard, Colonel Bernard came over,\nand they were actually exchanging their accomplishment that field of cryptology,\nwith the Poles. And they were very surprised when the Poles simply showed them\nthat, we have two gifts from you. One machine for the British, M \u2014 M \u2014 MI-6, I\nbelieve, and the French secret \u2014 military secret to Colonel Bernard.",
        "Q: So they gave these two enigma \u2014\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Enigmas to our allies.",
        "Q: I see. Okay, this shows how much you know about \u2014 I mean, very few people\nknow the detail of this \u2014 these sorts of events. But when I asked of the Molotov-\nRibbentrop Pact, and did people know about it, I\u2014 I need to be more precise. Did\nthe man on the street know about it, or did the government know about it?",
        "A: I'd say, speaking of government, Polish government, when Poland was attacked,\nescaped, with a lot of trained personnel; most of the Polish airmen went through\nRomania \u2014 Romania was ally of Poland \u2014 and most of them escaped through\nHungary and Romania to the west.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So when the government left Poland, ji\u2014 was General Rydz-Smigly, and\nMoscicki was the president. Moscicki was actually a \u2014 as \u2014 a Swiss. He was\neducated in Switzerland and so on. But anyway, when they left, the official, legal\nPolish government was formed in France. In exile, they \u2014 we called it.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: So through that government, and the connections of the Polish underground, and\nthe government in France, and later on when France was defeated, they moved to\nLondon. And then came picture of President Raczkiewicz, if you know, and then\nSikorski, General Sikorski. He was a premier of the Polish government in exile.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Through that government, and the connections of Polish underground, you\nknow, there was an exchange of news, views, and interviews, whatever was\nhappening in the west, and especially in the Germany. You know, so \u2014",
        "Q: So that \u2014 so \u2014",
        "A: \u2014so they were well informed. The members of the underground in Poland was \u2014\nwere \u2014 were very well informed of what was behind the screen going on.",
        "Q: All right. What about people like your family, like your neighbors. Did you\nknow of \u2014 of \u2014 were \u2014 were \u2014 was the regular person in Warsaw as well informed,\nor were they surprised? Because you see, when you say something like, the Soviet\nUnion stabbed Poland in the back, that \u2014 that suggests a surprise. And if you\u2019re\nvery well informed, you won\u2019t be surprised.",
        "A: Let\u2019s say, we had so many refugees in Warsaw during the war, as the Germans\nadvanced from the west \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 toward Warsaw. Eight \u2014 on the eighth day of operations, they were already at\nthe gates of Warsaw. So we had refugees coming from the west into Warsaw, and\nwe had refugees coming from the east into Warsaw. So, this melting pot, this city,\nJanuary 27, 2015\nthe capital city was sort of a source of all kind of gossip; good news, bad news. So\nthe people were pretty well informed.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Even the \u2014 in the streets, average Pole not maybe educated well enough, but still",
        "Q: Knew something.",
        "A: \u2014 people say.",
        "Q: People talk.",
        "A: And this was an exchange of news. Plus, you know, we had hidden radios, we\nwere listening to the BBC.",
        "Q: Okay. So now I\u2019ve jumped ahead a little bit. I want to go back to the very\nbeginning. Do you remem \u2014 the very beginning of the war. Do you remember where\nyou were on September 1\u201c, 1939?",
        "A: September 1, 1939, prior the day to that outbreak and attack by the Germans, I\nwas walking with my sister toward the deli store nearby, and we were talking about\n\u2014 because the \u2014 that was in the atmosphere that Poles \u2014 we are so strong that if they\nattacked us, the third day, our forces will be in Berlin, you know. So I talked to my\nsister, I says, would you be \u2014 Helena, would you be interested to \u2014 to \u2014 to see the\nJanuary 27, 2015\nwar, what it is like? And she says yes, it will be very interesting. So, as kids, you\nknow, young people, we were talking about the oncoming disaster.",
        "Q: And you were 10, and she was 14.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. It\u2019s \u2014 you were kids.",
        "A: Yes. The kids, but you know, th-th \u2014 the kids, let\u2019s say, in \u2014 in \u2014 in adopted\ncountry, here in United States, they are not as mature as the kids in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014\nliving in the conditions, wartime conditions. Kids mature fast. You know, when\nyou\u2019re in danger, y-you don\u2019t think about baseball, TV sets, and things at the time\nthat was not existing. But we were seriously interested of what was going on. When\nI joined the underground \u2014 maybe that\u2019s a subject later on \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 this was 1940 \u2014 \u201942, I was \u2014 I was what, 12 - 13 years old.",
        "Q: You were young.",
        "A: I was young.",
        "Q: You were young. You were young. Okay, so the day before, you remember\ngoing to the deli with your sister.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What about the day itself? When did you learn?\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: We learn the first, when we saw the German airplanes flying over, and the Polish\nanti-aircraft artillery opened the full blast, whatever was necessary to protect our\nskies, I saw the dogfights of the Polish P-11 fighter planes in the sky. The\nMesserschmitts were much faster, and they were metal planes. But the planes that\nPoland had, had a very [phone ringing][break]",
        "Q: So you \u2014 you saw the Polish planes, yes.",
        "A: The Polish planes. The anti-aircraft \u2014 actually, there was a heavy machine gun\nposition near that Clement\u2019s church, in their garden, you know, they set up near the\nchurch, because you know, the religious Germans would not maybe mount an attack\nsomewhat close to the church. But this \u2014 this post was manned by the \u2014 by the\nPolish army, and the anti-aircraft was very effective.",
        "Q: Were any of them shot down?",
        "A: I saw, let\u2019s say, smoke trails, three times. One was, I think, Polish airplane, and\nthen the two Messerschmitts went down. The conflict that lasted from first of\nSeptember til sixth of October, the losses that the Germans suffered in the air force\n\u2014 they say that the Polish air force was grounded and non-existing, on the contrary.\nI have a book written by Becker, a German writer, who said that first 16 days, there\nwas a very effective strength of Polish air force. Pilots were very well trained in\nDeblin air academy. And these pilots that were fighting in 1939 over the Polish\nJanuary 27, 2015\nskies, they escape through Romania, through France, to England. And they were\npart of the \u2014 part of the battle \u2014 Battle of Britain.",
        "Q: So, in other words, did they become \u2014 did they set up the training for the RAF\npilots, and for Polish pilots over \u2014 over Germany?",
        "A: The RAF, yes, that was the \u2014 Doening(ph), General Doening(ph), the head of\nthe RAF. He was very skeptical, because there was a language barrier, and actually,\nhe finally, when he saw what the damages the Luftwaffe did to the British, he\ndecided to accept the Polish contingent of air pilots, and there were two squadrons\nformed. Three or two, and three or through \u2014 three. Kosciuszko Squadron. I even\nhave a poster that I can later on show you. These pilots \u2014 if you saw a movie,\n\u201cBattle of Britain,\u201d there were Poles, very brave, and we had the highest score,\nbeating the Germans on equal basis, you know, because Spitfires and Hurricanes\nwere equivalent to Messerschmitts. Or Dornier, or whatever they had, the\nbombing airplanes, the Heinkels and Dorniers, and all the weapons that Goering\nprovided for \u2014 for the Operation Sea Lion, whatever it was, he wanted to put\nBritain on the \u2014 on her knees. And the fight was very, let\u2019s say, effective. So the\npilots, the pilots that left Poland, they put their talent to action in England, when\nthey had better airplanes, but the spirit very strong. The \u2014 the British were a little\nskeptical, because of the language, and we were not so very obedient. We had our\nJanuary 27, 2015\nstyle of fighting in the sky, and the guys really, when they attacked, th-th-the British\nsquadron leader at that time, there was a Canadian by the name of Kent. He was\ntrying to control the disobedience of Pole, how to attack the Germans, but the\nresults were rather \u2014 very effective. Realize that the Poles in England, with 15\nsquadrons, four bomber squadrons. We accounted for almost 1000 German planes\nshot in the air, th-the dogfights. One thousand, that\u2019s a big \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s a lot.",
        "A: \u2014 big score.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a lot.",
        "A: The 303 was the Kosciuszko Squadron. And why we named the Kosciuszko\nSquadron was the story of Kosciuszko heard that we got as a rep \u2014 re-reprocity.\nSee, the Poland regained her independence, thanks to President Wilson. And at that\ntime Americans wanted to pay the \u2014 pay the dues for \u2014 for fighting, for\nindependence of Poland from the Bolsheviks; this is the first World War. And 18\nAmerican pilots, Americans, they formed the squadrons that fought the Bolsheviks.",
        "Q: Oh, really?",
        "A: And they were the Kosciuszko Squadron.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: And Kosciuszko name for the bri \u2014 Battle of Britain was with the insignia of the\nsame thing of Kosciuszko, with the American flag, with the two [indecipherable]\nlike this, I show you later on \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 in that poster. But that was paid respect for the Poles for our, let\u2019s say,\ncontribution to the independence of the United States.",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: That was now the General Pulaski that was, that died in Savanna, Georgia. The\nfather of American cavalry. And Kosciuszko, the father of West Point. I don\u2019t\nknow if you ever visited West Point?",
        "Q: I\u2014I haven\u2019t, but \u2014 and I didn\u2019t know that he would have been the founder of it.",
        "A: Yes, he started this whole thing, as a stronghold against the Brits.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And there\u2019s a big bol \u2014 Kosciuszko monument in the square of the \u2014 and there\nare many \u2014 many artifacts, and remembrances. Jefferson was that \u2014",
        "Q: Yes, of course.",
        "A: He called Kosciuszko as a \u2014 the son \u2014 the true son of freedom.",
        "Q: I do know who Kosciuszko was, of course, but \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "Q: \u2014 that \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know this about West Point.",
        "A: Yeah, West Point.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That was acad \u2014 a military academy, yeah.",
        "Q: Right, sure. Okay, that\u2019s a far away from Warsaw, and September first \u2014",
        "A: Yes, okay, yes, I\u2019m sorry for that [indecipherable] \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: \u2014 because you are actually the guidance.",
        "Q: I know.",
        "A: You the \u2014 you\u2019re the GPS.",
        "Q: I know, but you have such interesting \u2014 interesting observations that I want to\nhear them, and then we get off track. All right, so we\u2019re back down \u2014 we\u2019re back at\nWarsaw. You see at least three trails of smoke; two from Messerschmitts in the\nvery beginning.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And then how did the following days unvel \u2014 unfold and develop, in those first\nfew days of \u2014",
        "A: Few \u2014 few days of \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 in Warsaw, and what do you see?\nJanuary 27, 2015",

        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Because you know, during the siege of Warsaw that lasted 28 days, our food\nsupplies were exhausted. The water was short, a shortage of water, and the\nresistance was strong, very strong. We defended Warsaw for so long, and the\nGermans admired the \u2014 the knighthood of the Polish army that I\u2019m after. Because\nde-defending Warsaw was a guy by the name of Rommel, General Rommel, the\nPolish side. I don\u2019t know if there was any connection of that Erwin Rommel in\nAfrica, or Rommel General.",

        "A: On the orphanage, what we did is, portion of the building that was not\ncompletely damaged, so to speak of, so we covered the windows that were all\nbroken, the floor, the doors. We tried to rebuild whatever space was available.",
        "Q: Did you return to your old apartment?",
        "A: Ah, no, no, no.",

Portion of the offices we converted to our, let\u2019s say, primitive living\nquarters. No water. The windows we covered with whatever. We didn\u2019t have\nplastic, but there was something very foggy that we covered too, because the winter\nof 1940 was so severe that \u2014 frost was so strong that the pigeons were falling off the\nbalconies.",

        "A: And there we was \u2014 we were \u2014 let\u2019s say, the Germans, when they entered the\ncity, some of the squares they set up the salamanders, you know, they were\nsalamanders, they were like a coke ovens, and they heated up so the people could \u2014\ncould warm themselves. And Wehrmacht at that time, they set up field kitchens \u2014\ncan you imagine, for the civilians. The Wehrmacht was behaving like a regular \u2014\nregular army. No \u2014 no behavior like the SS, or \u2014 or \u2014 or the, let\u2019s say gent \u2014 the \u2014\nthe field police. Later on when the secondary units came, the Wehrmacht left, you\nknow, so there was a change in attitude toward the civilians.",
        "Q: So, you move back across the street, and \u2014 and into one of the offices that now\nyou converted \u2014",
        "A: I returned back to the next possession actually, that was adjacent to the area\nwhere we lived. After the fire, we rebuild it. I remember we had two rooms at the\nbeginning, the whole family. And there was a family by the name of Bront(ph),\nBront(ph). I think that was a \u2014 a German citizen, and his wife was Polish,\nBehrowska(ph), and they had a daughter, Danuta(ph). And I think this family,\nbecause of the German roots, they signed the volks \u2014 Volksliste. They sign up to be\npart of, let\u2019s say that superior race. So they lived in the two \u2014 they displaced us from\nthe two rooms, and they \u2014 we were moved to the single room. Four people, single\nJanuary 27, 2015\nroom. So, they later on moved out from the area, into a special section of the city\nthat was reserved for the Germans.",
        "Q: I see, I see. Did they have children, or was this only a couple?",
        "A: They\u2019re a couple, they had one child, there was \u2014 that was Danuta(ph). And\nwhen she came to visit us during the occupation, she was that hio \u2014 the ha \u2014\nHitlerjugend, but she was the madel, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014",

        "Q: But things changed.",
        "A: It\u2019s changed, yes. Now, I remember when I walked in when they were occupying\nthat two room apartment, I remember the Griffarts(ph) on the wall. You know the\nname Griffarts(ph)?",
        "Q: No, what\u2019s that?",
        "A: Oh, the German staff officers used to call Hitler Griffarts(ph).",

        "A: Well, you know, the Wehrmacht were \u2014 tha-that was endearment \u2014 I \u2014 I rather\nnot, because later on Hitler acted like a strategist, because he had dreams, you\nknow. So \u2014 so \u2014",
        "Q: You mean, like dreams at night?",
        "A: At night, yeah \u2014",

A lot of military uniforms\nwe ve seen in the streets everywhere, that they were occupying the best place to,\nlet\u2019s say, live and be treated. So most of the theaters, restaurants, were with the\ninscription, nur fiir Deutsche, for Germans only.",

Sometimes when there\nwere too many, let\u2019s say, attacks on the Germans, or too many of their side weapons\ndisappeared, because in the crowd, the streetcar, many times, you know, the AK\nwere cutting their holsters, and stealing their weapons, and so on, and so on. So they\nwere changing the platform, sometimes in front, sometimes in the back. But this\nwas strictly for Germans. And a city, as such, you know, was divided for the Aryans\nJanuary 27, 2015\nand the Jews. The ghetto was formed, the wall was built, and the minority of the\nJews, which was the largest diaspora in the world; I think maybe more than in New\nYork; so they were put into either small ghetto, or large ghettos.

Now,\nthis portion of the building, the \u2014 what was saved after the bombardment, they\nrepaired whatever they could, but the basement and the first floor, what they were\ndoing, they were building field kitchens, you know, just like the first World War,\nthat was on wheels.

        "A: I would say yes. I didn\u2019t see any in uniform, any people in uniform. There was\nthe guy that came over a couple times, you know, to inspect the facility, and see\nwhat there is \u2014 the production rate, or whatever.\nJanuary 27, 2015",

        "A: You know, we \u2014 we sometimes improvised things as we need. So I remember\nmy father built his own little oven, connected to the stack, to the chimney, and we\nwere cooking right on two \u2014 two \u2014 let\u2019s say two burners, not burners, but fire\n[indecipherable] what we had that was something, a hotplate like. So this was the\npart, and the sanitary facilities, they were using some toilets that were left, you\nknow, with \u2014",

        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But then we were heating the water in some tub, you know, and then washing\nourselves the best we could.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: There was a lack of everything, you know. Soap was scarcity, paper was a\nscarcity. Bread tha-that was made for the Poles. Sometimes we were laughing that\nthat bread was just like a \u2014 like a \u2014 like a board, not properly baked in the \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014\nin enough time to make it edible, to make it edible. They didn\u2019t use the flour, they\nJanuary 27, 2015\nused the sawdust underneath in the ovens, you know, so \u2014 so this was a substitute.\nEverything was ersatz.",
        "Q: Substitute, yes.",
        "A: Substitute. Ersatz. That\u2019s a \u2014 the bread, the basic stuff, staple. The marmalade\nwas made out of beets, sweetened up with saccharin. You know, it was the artificial\nsweetener. And that thing, you could eat as much as you wanted, but the next day\nthe thing was fermented and was growing. You always had a full \u2014 full jar. So meat\nwas only on the black market \u2014 black market, you know, so the ingenious Poles\nwere going to the countryside to bring food. The Germans intercepted \u2014 most of the\nrailroad stations they were intercepting in order to take that food away from them.\nBut food; meat, butter, you know, these were things very difficult to obtain.",
        "Q: And they were forbidden?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Schwarzmarkt is what they call it, the black market, was a no-no.",
        "Q: Well, here\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: The Germans were setting up patrols and \u2014 and \u2014 and stopping the trains before\nthis destination, and \u2014 and \u2014 and getting the people, sorting them out, and checking\nwhat kind of food they bringing.",

        "A: There was rationing. We \u2014",
        "Q: And there was rationing so that you could get only a certain amount of any kind\nof food, but was it actually so that certain foods were forbidden to even have,\nwhether the e \u2014 for example, if it\u2019s eggs, or butter, or meat. I-Is it that it\u2019s not\nforbidden if you have it in your home, that it\u2019s forbidden to bring it there? Ho-How\ndid that work?",
        "A: Let\u2019s see, it was forbidden to \u2014 meat, especially meat, you know. But eggs you\ncould buy on the bla \u2014 black market; flour and butter, you know. Whatever the\npeople could smuggle in from the countryside, that was done. But not all these, let\u2019s\nsay attempts, were successful. The Germans were intercepting and taking away\nfrom the people.",
        "Q: Okay. So \u2014",
        "A: So even they joked that sometimes as \u2014 a pig was smuggled into the city. But\nhow it was smuggled? Because it was dressed up in a human suit, you know, where\nthe snout was all covered up with bandages, you know, and the \u2014 th-they \u2014 the\nGerman patrol was told that this was a sick man going to Warsaw hospital;\nsuddenly there was a pig. Women were \u2014\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "Q: Was that actually true?",
        "A: Yes, yes. There were many, many different ways of how to outwit the Germans,\nfor the sake of survival. Things were very risky, but still they had to be played.",

        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Yes, many a times said now, we are experiencing this unfortunate exchange of\nthoughts that we had just before the war started. Because the occupation was cruel,\nvery cruel. And we were treated as sub-humans.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 how did you personally experience that kind of treatment?",
        "A: How did I experience that kind of treatment? First, as I said, the streetcars were\nseparated for Germans, and for the Poles.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The s \u2014 on the sidewalks very often, we had to leave room as the Germans were\npassing by for them. And the lines for food in our, let\u2019s say, stores, were long,\npeople were waiting, sometimes for nothing. The German stores, there was a\ncompany my \u2014 Mynell(ph) \u2014 Mynell(ph), that was for Germans, where they could\nJanuary 27, 2015\nbuy anything they wanted; butter, eggs, meat. Everything just for the Germans,\nseparated from the Polish.",
        "Q: Were there German civilians?",
        "A: Yes. During the heavy bombing of Reich, the \u2014 Germany wen \u2014 was bombed.\nMany Germans, to save their lives, they were moving. Let\u2019s say members of the\nfamilies, they were moving into Warsaw to live, and certain parts of the city were\nreserved for a German population. The better sides, undestroyed, and \u2014 was\nprovided for the German families, Reichsdeutsche that came from the \u2014 from the\nReich.",
        "Q: So, does that mean towards \u2014 clo \u2014 closer towards the second part of the war? If\nyou're saying it\u2019s when Germany itself was being bombed, or \u2014",
        "A: Well, the mass \u2014 mass bombing, you know, it started where the Americans\ndeclared war, when was this, 19 \u2014",

        "Q: No, the Americans started in \u2014 June 6\", 1944 was the invasion of Normandy.",
        "A: Normandy? Oh, but I am speaking of bombing of Germany was already \u2014 I\nthink the \u2014",
        "Q: Underway?\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 American air force was already in England prior to that day.",

        "Q: Well, but my point is \u2014 my \u2014 my question is, did these civilians, were they were\nfrom the very beginning \u2014",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: \u2014 in Warsaw? They appeared later?",
        "A: No, they appeared later.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Later, yes.",
        "Q: So, in the beginning the Germans that you saw were military people, were all\nsomehow or other connected with the war effort?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. Did you see any \u2014 you mentioned during the shelling of the artillery, when\nthe factory that \u2014 in your home was \u2014 was destroyed, that people died, were killed\nas a result of this artillery fire.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Did you ever see anybody el \u2014 did you ever see anybody treated violently on the\nstreet? Did you ever see any corpses on the roads?",
        "A: No, not violently in the street, there was no scene like this. But there were times\nwhere the Germans, let\u2019s say, separated certain parts of the street, or streetcars that\nwere in, in order to kidnap the people for work in the Reich. So these things were\nvery frequent.",
        "Q: And you saw these things.",
        "A: Yes, I was part of it. That\u2019s a scene that I remember. One of my colleagues, he\nhad a pistol on him, and when the Germans stopped, you know, he was so upset that\nhe started sweating, you know. And there was an older lady, say 80 - 85, she look at\nthat young fellow, and she open her purse, you know. So he put the gun \u2014",
        "Q: In her purse.",
        "A: \u2014 into her purse, she close it. The Germans didn\u2019t attack her, you know, didn\u2019t\nquestion her at all. And the boys \u2014",
        "Q: But they searched him.",
        "A: \u2014 he save his \u2014 she saved his life. And \u2014 and the spirit, and \u2014 and the brotherhood\namong the Poles in Warsaw was unusually unique and \u2014 and good, from the sense\nJanuary 27, 2015\nthat we stood for each other until the end. And we knew that the end is coming for\nall of us, one way or the other, so we stuck together. There was a \u2014",
        "Q: And that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s unusual.",
        "A: Yeah. For [indecipherable] yes, yes. There were \u2014 there were cases, you know,\nlike schmeil(ph) shovnik(ph), you heard that expression?",
        "Q: Tell me what this is.",

        "A: I was a member \u2014 okay, I was a member, I joined the underground when I was\n12. In 1942, I was sworn in in Schweidel, the suburb, you know, very nice forest\nthere. I was sworn in into paramilitary organization, which was \u2014 pre-war, it was the\nBoy Scout movement.",
        "Q: So tell me how did that happen? Did you find them, or did they find you?",
        "A: No, they found me, I think. I had two good teachers, you know. Casimira(ph)\nBye(ph) and Janina(ph) Guretsky(ph). They were observing me at school, and my\nbehavior, and the way they trusted me. And there was a third teacher, that was Mrs.\nBernisz(ph). She was of German descent. And they accosted me, and they ask me if\nI would be interested to work in the underground. So, I sign up, I was sworn in in\n1942, and the rest of the years of occupation, I was a member of the Home Army,\nPolish Home Army, with the sign of, as you can see, that anchor, PW, which stands\nof Polska Walczaca, I don\u2019t know, the fighting Poland.",

Two slices that were soaked 1n artificial\ncoffee made out of grain, regular grain. Put some sugar on top of it, put these things\ntogether, and that was my sandwich for school.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: Or, sometimes the onion that was fried in some schmaltz, lard, and this was sort\nof a spread \u2014",
        "Q: Onto the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 for the sandwich. Meat was a scarcity, scarcity. And let\u2019s say sometimes the\nOstbahn, they had the cafeterias where my mother could get the soup for us.",
        "Q: So your father would bring it back, or \u2014",
        "A: No, my mother used to walk to there and she had the document that she was wife\nof the employee of the Ostbahn, and she was bringing the soup home.",

        "Q: And you said your sister worked in a food production factory \u2014",
        "A: Yes, be \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 or place, or something. So what was that all about?",
        "A: The food was actually for us, for the Poles. That was not for the production, for\nthe Germans, was strictly controlled by \u2014 by the Germans, you know, so they \u2014 they\nwere very careful. Let\u2019s say they were confiscating the cattle and the \u2014 and all the\nthings, but the processing of that was made by \u2014 by them.",
        "Q: Okay. So, your sister worked. What kind of food was she producing?",
        "A: I think this was like marmalades, and all kind of preserves, fruit preserves. No \u2014\nother, let\u2019s say preserves. They were \u2014 made, you know, pickling the cucumbers, or\n\u2014 or pickles. And that was the simpl \u2014 simple \u2014 simple food like this, you know.",
        "Q: And did she ever bring any of that home?",
        "A: Oh, she \u2014 they put that was that, let\u2019s say, instead of payment, you know, they\nused to give something for the employees. Like my father used to get the alcohol, or\ncoal \u2014 coal for burning in the stove. Or sometimes he was getting a \u2014 a bread, or\nmar-margarine. Artificial butter. So these things that he could get from the \u2014 from\nhis superiors, you know.\nJanuary 27, 2015",

        "Q: To the salary.",
        "A: \u2014 to mediocre salaries. Because this money what the Germans issued had no\npurchasing power.",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "A: Like for instance, if you went for the black market to buy food in the country.\nThe farmers used to accept only the pre-war money, which was silver coins. Silver\ncoins, you know, the tens ztotys, five zlotys, two zlotys. They were silver. I-I think\nat about 60 or 70 percent pure silver. So they knew the metal value, and they were\nselling food for this kind of bouillon.",
        "Q: I see. Rather \u2014 and rather than the \u2014",
        "A: Than accepting the paper money issued by the Germans, which had no \u2014 it was\ngood for the General na gubernia(ph) to \u2014 to \u2014 to buy some stuff on the black\nmarket, but the farmers, they were very skeptical about the paper money.",

        "A: My sister? I\u2014 she knew something about it. Very often, you know, th \u2014 sh-she\ndidn\u2019t show up on time home, it seemed to me, but everything was enveloped in\nsecrecy. We couldn\u2019t operate with the names, we were using only nom de guerre.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, what was yours?",
        "A: Tabacca(ph).",
        "Q: So your pseudonym was Tabacca(ph)?",
        "A: Tabacca(ph). And then when there was some kind of a [indecipherable] which\nwe used to call when the Germans discovered some \u2014 somebody that was squealing,\nand we were in danger of being discovered, I was changed to Zbeek(ph)\nEnrysh(ph).",
        "Q: Zbeek(ph)?",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did your father ever t-tell stories of what he would see at the Ostbahn? What\nkind of things he would be translating?",
        "A: When \u2014 he often told me about the German trains coming from the eastern front.\nHe said that he saw some kwerp \u2014 corpses. I mean, the people without legs, you\nknow, frozen noses, ears. But they were running through the tracks that were\nseparated by some kind of partition, so the civilians wouldn\u2019t see them. But he said\nthat casualties were coming from the eastern front, yes.",
        "Q: So he could see these things and he talked about them?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. And did he work with one particular German if \u2014 in \u2014 official in particular,\nor with many?",
        "A: I think with many, because the administration of the railroad was in many hands,\nyou know, but the chief honcho, I don\u2019t even know who \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 who \u2014 who that guy was.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "Q: And what would be the sort of things \u2014 he \u2014 was he a sort of like an in \u2014 in\nbetween the \u2014 the German bosses and the other workers? Is this where his\ntranslation skills were used, for them to translate orders? Or was it in different\ncapacities?",
        "A: He was translating because there were many Poles employed that didn\u2019t speak\nGerman. But the work assignments that were, let\u2019s say, by the Germans to direct\ncertain squads of people to do this kind of work, [indecipherable] repairs, or the \u2014\nwhat they call, the platform repairs, or \u2014 or is \u2014 cleaning up the stations, you know.\nSo he was always called in as a interpreter.",
        "Q: And do you think that he might have been involved in underground work?",
        "A: I\u2014I don\u2019t think so. Maybe he was accosted by some people, but I don\u2019t think\nthat he was \u2014 he was aware of that I was doing, toward the end, but I don\u2019t think he\nwas part of it. He, let\u2019s say, cooperated, if there was some assignment to report, yes.\nBut I don\u2019t think that he was fully sworn in, an-and \u2014 and \u2014 and working for the \u2014\nfor the underground. Let\u2019s say Poles were all members of the underground. We\nwere all, let\u2019s say, sympathetic to the people that were actually the activists, you\nknow, and the civilians were cooperating every time there was a situation, a\ndangerous situation, so they did help.",
        "Q: Like the lady who opened her purse for the gun.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. They say with that inscription, and I said nur fur Deutsche, we\nplayed the joke on Germans, because somehow the buchhandlung, there was some",

        "Q: The armbands, mm-hm.",
        "A: Armbands, nur fur Deutsche, you know. And then we started putting in on the\nlampposts, telegraph posts, everything that was vertically up, you know, we put\nthese things around, nur fur Deutsche. And they caught that thing after a while,\nand that was repercussions.",
        "Q: Oh, really?",
        "A: Just like repercussions was \u2014 the Germans used the sign of victory. The\nPilsudski square in center of Warsaw, that\u2019s where the tomb of unknown soldier is\nlocated. It still exists, partially, the uprising \u2014 survived the siege of 1939. There are\nonly three or four columns. If you\u2019ve been in Warsaw, maybe you saw it, the tomb\nof unknown soldier. Anyway, this was Pilsudski square. When Hitler came to\nWarsaw for the victory parade, as a gift they changed the name of many streets to\nGerman sounding names, and this was changed to Adolf Hitlerplatz. And in front\nJanuary 27, 2015\nof Poniatowski monument, they put a big sign of Victoria, and that victory sign\nunderneath was Deutschland siegt am allen fronten.",
        "Q: Okay, Germany is victorious on all fronts.",
        "A: On all the fronts. The word siegt, we changed S to L, and the sos \u2014 Deutschland\nliegt am allen fronten.",
        "Q: So that mean \u2014 allen fronten.",
        "A: You know, this \u2014 this was a very \u2014",
        "Q: And how would you translate that?",
        "A: The German lies on all the fronts. You know, flat. So this, they didn\u2019t like it at\nall, because many places they had Deutschland siegt am allen fronten. And there\nwere propaganda signs by Dr. Goebbels, even showing a Polish soldier wounded,\nand Churchill, and the Polish soldier is saying, England, this is your deed. I don\u2019t\nknow if you saw it in some of the books.",
        "Q: No. So \u2014 oh the \u2014 so the fact \u2014",
        "A: That the guilt \u2014 the guilt lies in engl \u2014 with England, you know, that \u2014",
        "Q: That Poland is 0 \u2014 okay.",
        "A: \u2014 they are guilty of \u2014 of our suffering, and so on. There was tremendous shock,\nthe time I \u2014 that was 1943, around the springtime, March or \u2014 March, I think. There\nwas mutual agreement between Poland \u2014 let\u2019s say the government, Polish\nJanuary 27, 2015\ngovernment in exile in England, Sikorski, with ma \u2014 with the Russians, fighting\nagainst common enemy.",
        "Q: Correct.",
        "A: But, when there was Katyn discovery, what happened is that the Germans\nadvanced, and they stop at Smolensk, Charkow. They found this massive graves \u2014\ngraves, Polish graves. These were places of execution of the Polish officers that\nwere captured during that attack on the 17\" of March.",
        "Q: September.",
        "A: I mean, 17\" of September, 1939, when they stabbed us in the back.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They deported million and a half Poles to Siberia, and they separated the\nmilitary personnel to be, let\u2019s say, kept in the different camps. Out of this they\nselected the officers. The officers were the officers of reserves, so there were, you\nknow, lawyers, doctors, professional officers and all kind of intelligentsia that was\npart of that 200-some 20 prisoners of war that these Russians captured. Out of this\nthey selected the officers, and they were executed in Katyn.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re talking 220,000?",
        "A: Two hundred twenty military personnel.",
        "Q: Okay. Only 220 \u2014\nJanuary 27, 2015",

        "Q: The officers.",
        "A: The officers, and so on. They \u2014",
        "Q: So what happened when the graves were discovered? How 1s that received in\nWarsaw\u2019?",
        "A: As the Germans advanced, and they discovered \u2014 immediately the Russian\npropaganda was saying that the Germans did it, you know, and they tried to blame\nthe Russians for this. The Germans, to prove the case, they have asked the higher\nranking officers, British, French, and then whoever was there from the western\nEuropean POW camps, and they form a commission. And this commission was\njoined by the Red Cross, and they all went to the passive disc \u2014 discovery of these\nbig, massive graves, and they selected the caliber of the guns that they were using to\nshoot them in the back \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, I want to make sure I understand. They selected not only th \u2014 they asked\nnot only the international Red Cross, but their own prisoners of war that they had\ncaptured \u2014",
        "A: Yes.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "Q: They formed a commission from some of these selected people \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 who were prisoners themselves, to go to the site of the mass graves \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and do what?",
        "A: Exhume the bodies. Check, you know, some of the insignias, dog tags, and the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the bullets that normally they found the skulls with the hole in the back,\nbecause the prisoners were tied in the back, walked into the room, and shot by the\nNKVD \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 in the back of their heads.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So this was a shock for me, when I walked into classroom, and I saw my teacher\ncrying, Mrs. Bernisz(ph).",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Or Umlaut.",
        "Q: Or Umlaut.",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Bernisz(ph), yeah.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Bernisz(ph), you know. Her brother, Lieutenant Bernisz(ph), a Polish lieutenant\n\u2014 she admitted that she was of German descent, even for generations in \u2014 in\nWarsaw. So she says \u2014 she was crying, you know, and I ask her now, why do you\ncry ma\u2019am? What happened? You know, she just simply pushed a Red Cross card, a\nnotification postal card to me, and then I ripped it over, and I looked at this, and that\nwas his name listed among the bodies exhumed from that mass grave.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And this changed entirely, the diplomatic relations with the Polish government\nin exile. They were broken, these relations were broken, and the Russians ignored\nthe free legal Polish government. They said that this is not true, the Germans did it,\nand we were siding with the fascists, you know. Th-The \u2014 the regular way of the\nRussian lies that are \u2014 even now you can s \u2014 listen to [indecipherable] and \u2014 and \u2014\nand \u2014 and see how nicely he forms certain ways of how to do the right thing the\nRussian way.",
        "Q: I see. Let\u2019s go back to these events. So people discovered that \u2014 Warsaw begins\nto discover that these missing officers have been murdered by the rus \u2014 the Soviet\nforces.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: You find out in a very personal way, through your teacher.\nJanuary 27, 2015",

        "Q: How did it \u2014 how did people find out in general abou \u2014 was this something that\nthe Germans were \u2014 were broadcasting?",
        "A: Well, they were the \u2014 they were drumming it up. Germans were drumming it up,\nand the situation was even getting worse and worse, because the Polish formations\nof soldiers in Russia, under the command of General Anders \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 there was a situation when Sikorski met with Stalin and all the other big brass,\nRussian brass in \u2014 in \u2014 in Moscow, I think, and he asked about, where are the Polish\nofficers? Because when we formed these units, Polish units to fight the Germans,\nwhere are the officers? And the Russians responded by saying, you know, they were\nsomewhere in Manchuria and they run away. They escape from the captivity. They\nnever admitted \u2014 they \u2014 you know when they admitted? When \u2014 I forgot his name,\nthat Russian prior to Gorbachev, ye \u2014 ye \u2014 yench \u2014",

        "Q: So we\u2019re talking well over 50 years later.",
        "A: Yes.",

That was in [indecipherable] \u2014 what our activities were. So we were\nsabotaging the German vehicles as much as we could, you know.

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then we were using all kind of propaganda posters to counteract the German\npropaganda posters. Like, for instance, the mysterious death of General Sikorski in\nGibraltar.

Tanks, armor cars, any cars, any guns,\nanything that was on wheels. So we used to have charts and mark these things to\n107January 27, 2015\nsend later on to our headquarters, which in turn sent it over to \u2014 to London. That\nwas very useful, because the Brits knew, you know, what strength actually, the\nGermans are sending to the eastern front, that this was a sign to us on two bridges;\nPoniatowski bridge, and Kierbedzia bridge.

        "Q: Which, which, the Warsaw uprising?",
        "A: The Warsaw uprising. There were \u2014 in the ghetto there were Jews that were\nbrought from Hungary, but they were protected by their skills, you know, tailors,\nshoemakers that were contributing to the war machine.",
        "Q: The German war machine.",
        "A: The German war machine.",
        "Q: Right.\n128January 27, 2015",
        "A: And Zoska battalion, which was one of the leading scouts, but \u2014 Boy Scouts, but\nthey were a\u2014 18 and up. So they freed about 350, and they called the gang\nShufka(ph). Gesia Street was the street in the ghetto, and they had these barracks\nwhere they were working \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 for the German war machine. So some of these guys joined the Polish units\nduring the Warsaw uprising.",

        "A: Yes, the ghetto \u2014 the ghetto was put out.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I\u2019m speaking of some remains of the skilled Jews that were used for the war\nmachine, that were separated from the rest of the Jews in \u2014 in Shufka(ph), and these\nwere the Hungarian Jews that were kept.\n129January 27, 2015",
        "Q: Okay. Hungarian Jews weren\u2019t deported from Hungary until March \u201944. So, in\nother words, they couldn\u2019t have been part of the Warsaw ghetto. They couldn\u2019t\nhave been part of the Warsaw ghetto that was obliterated, and yet they\u2019re kept\nalive. They must have been brought in later.",
        "A: I think so. It could be like this, because there was even a negotiation between the\nallies, the \u2014 the Germans demanded trucks for trading freedom for these Jews.\nThere was something secret that I \u2014 I never, let\u2019s say, analyzed this so deep, but\nthey were trying to save the Jews by giving some \u2014",

        "Q: So let\u2019s turn to the uprising. How do you \u2014 what ha \u2014 what do you get involved\nin, what changes in your life to prepare to \u2014",
        "A: What happened, the uprising started on the first of August.",
        "Q: Right, and where were you?",

        "Q: Where the orphanage was.",
        "A: Orph \u2014 the cro \u2014 across the street, yes, and the last meeting we had with the\npatrol one, we said that we are going together at Kartselak(ph), which was a\nmarketplace right at the Wolska Street, that main thoroughfare, and Towarowa,\nJanuary 27, 2015\nand Przyokopowa, this was a large square, like a Maxwell Street in Chicago, you\nknow, there were little stands that the people were selling. Anything that your heart\ndesire, the black market at that time.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, the meeting didn\u2019t come through because of the beginning of uprising was\nscheduled for five o\u2019clock [indecipherable] stands for walka(ph). And there was\nsupposed to be at five, but it started at the different time. So what happened was that\nI simply joined the newly formed company, 315, across the street in that building of\nJanusz Korczak.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And what the \u2014 happened, they assigned me to be the observer. So I was posted\non that highest point of that building that was safe from that siege during the 1939.\nAnd I was watching the Germans coming Karolkowa Street, toward the Wolska.\nThis was street \u2014 side street, but anyway important, because they tried to clear both\nsides of Wolska, so the German traffic would go free, without any side \u2014 side\nattacks. But what we did over first and second of the uprising day, we build a\nbarricade and a deep ditch on Karolkowa Street. So the Germans, when they came\nover, to the point I saw them, I was reporting down that there is a German armor car\nwaiting, but they hesitating to cross because of the obstacle. Then \u2014 this was couple\n132January 27, 2015\ndays like this, and then, before \u2014 actually, before uprising started, I was put to work\nby cleaning some old rifles that were recovered from the hiding places, for an attack\nby the grownups, of that School 100. Because School 100 that I attended during \u2014\nbefore the war \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: \u2014 this whole building was converted to a rest house for the Germans. All the\nnicer buildings \u2014",
        "Q: The beautiful building where you didn\u2019t walk with shoes. Where you walked on\nyour si \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, this was converted to a shelter for the Germans that were coming to\nWarsaw to rest, after the battle fatigue \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 whatever they had in the east, or \u2014 they were re-convalescence after they were\nwounded, whatever. Most of the better buildings were taken by the Germans, by the\nGermans. So anyway, this attack failed, because the Germans were armed to the \u2014",
        "Q: Teeth.",
        "A: \u2014 kin. And this thing was a failure.",
        "Q: Okay.\n133January 27, 2015",
        "A: So the next operation, what happened was, on the V separation of two streets,\nTowarowa and Przyokopowa, there was a German repair shop, for German\nvehicles. So, we were told that we have to get gasoline for the Molotov cocktails.\nAnd I remember from 1939 I had these flare \u2014 flare gun.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That was my weapon. There was one guy that \u2014 with the saw off Mauser, you\nknow, carbine? Anyway, when we \u2014 there was about five of us, two mechanics, and\nthere were two, three of younger ones, you know, and we entered that place, the\nGermans got scared off. They got on a\u2014 motorbikes, and they left. So we started\ngetting the cars into some kind of a position that maybe we can start \u2014",
        "Q: Drive them out.",
        "A: \u2014 drive them out. So one of the mechanics, you know, he was able to \u2014 the car\nhad the four tires on. The others didn\u2019t have the tires on because they were over the\n\u2014 what they call, the tunnels, that they were \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, where they were repairing.",
        "A: Repairing, yeah.",
        "Q: Repairing things.",
        "A: So the one with the four tires was okay, so he started this car. But in the\nmeantime, what I was doing 1s I was collecting into jerry cans \u2014\n134January 27, 2015",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know the jerry cans are.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: Those 20 liter \u2014",
        "Q: Yes, yes, yes, yes, okay, right.",
        "A: \u2014 metal containers. I was sucking \u2014 siphoning the gasoline from the ones that \u2014",
        "Q: Were on ther \u2014 right.",
        "A: \u2014 have the tires on, that was getting ready for repairs.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So I was able to put about two \u2014 two \u2014 two of these canisters, jerry cans \u2014",
        "Q: How were you siphoning?",
        "A: With the rubber hose.",
        "Q: And you were sucking it in?",
        "A: Sucking it in. Once it started, you know, then the gasoline was dripping out.\nAnyway, I was \u2014 this was the most precious liquid at the time, because the company\n315 was waiting for delivery of weapons, but it never materialized, you know, they\ndidn\u2019t get it. So the most effective weapons were the Molotov cocktails. Some of\nthe units that were on the barricade on Gorezewska Street, parallel to Wolska, right\nat Miynarska, these were barricades attacked by the Germans, and they were trying\n135January 27, 2015\nto really break the opposition at any cost. They were even putting civilians in front\nof their tanks, and \u2014 and \u2014 and approaching the Polish points of resistance \u2014",
        "Q: With the civilians in front?",
        "A: Yeah, so we would stop shooting, you know, at our own people. And anyway, I\ndelivered \u2014 I could carry the whole jerry can, but I take half of it, couple times. I\nwalked from Krochmaina, from that Janusz Korezak place, and | carried this over\nto Gorcezewska Street, which was a distance of at least five, six, seven blocks, as a\nsmall kid, with a friend of mine.",
        "Q: That\u2019s not \u2014 that\u2019s not bad \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 that\u2019s quite a bit.",
        "A: And you know, they welcomed me at the barricade when I brought that gasoline,\nbecause whenever Germans approached \u2014 and the houses on the left, and on the\nright, you know, had these bottles, you know, these things were very dangerous for\nthe Germans [indecipherable] we set the fire to a tank, you know, the \u2014 the \u2014 the\ncrew was jumping out.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So this was one of the major operations. Then this other one \u2014 oh, this was\nsomething that I\u2019ll never forget. We were told, for the areas that were already freed\n136January 27, 2015\nfrom the Germans, to hang our national flags in front of the houses. And this was a\n\u2014 boo-boo, because the Germans marked the areas they saw the flags; there were\nobservation planes flying over, and three Stukas came over, and bombed again, the\narea where we lived in.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: They flatten it out. I remember as a ki \u2014 that I was \u2014 I \u2014I was holding a\u2014a-\u2014a\nradiator, you know, on the first floor, and somehow I was found semi-conscious in\nthe \u2014 in the basement.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: From that flattening out?",
        "A: From that flattening out. And then, after this, we all took a shelter in the\nKorezak\u2019s building \u2014 Korezak\u2019s building. And then \u2014 that was August third or\nfourth, the Germans brought R.O.N.A., you heard of R.O.N.A.? R-o-n-a. That was\nRusskaya Osvoboditelnaya Narodnaya Armiya.",

        "Q: Yes.\n137January 27, 2015",
        "A: This was a traitor. This wa \u2014 he was a Russian, and he recruited the Ukrainians,\nand Russians, whoever was available, and some \u2014 some Mongols from the Azure,\nto put them to work on Poles, the rebellious Poles, and finish us off.",
        "Q: So in other words, this was a group of Russians who were \u2014",
        "A: Volunteer \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 Russians and other Soviets who were against the Soviet Union. That is the \u2014",
        "A: Yes, Vlasov, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, Vlasov armies.",

        "Q: Hat?",
        "A: \u2014 hats, with the Hakenkreuz, and the German Wehrmacht uniforms, and some\nof them had the SS marks. So they were special troops.",
        "Q: So what was this \u2014 what was distinguished about them, aside from their look?",
        "A: Aside from them look, they had that R.O.N.A. badges on their left arms.",

        "Q: Von dem Bach, okay.",
        "A: Von dem Bach. He was in charge, a specialist for the partisan warfare. He was\nin Warsaw operation on, I think, the fourth or fifth of August. And he was the guy\nthat stopped the mass mor \u2014 murders of that district Wola. Because during that time\nwhen the R.O.N.A. came into picture, and they started shooting civilians, 50,000 of\nar \u2014 Soviets lost their lives because they were cleaning up, mercilessly, all the side\nstreets, and every courtyard was a cemetery.",
        "Q: So they were indiscriminate in who they were shooting?",
        "A: Yes, yes. To the point when that was the fifth or sixth of August, I was in the\ncourtyard \u2014 that\u2019s where we lived \u2014 and I was in the basement, and some civilians\nwent into basements and they were hiding there. The windows were covered with\nthe sandbags, and some metal plates to protect from any kind of outside attack.\nWhen the R.O.N.A. soldiers came over, they had this German potato mashers, you\nknow, these grenades with that little handle on? They used to combine these\ngrenades together and make the bundle of them, and they used to open that little\nwindows and they were tossing into the basement of people. And this was almost\n139January 27, 2015\nunbelievable scream of people dying in the basements. And they took us, the live\nones, they took us outside the building. You know, my father was already with \u2014 old\nmen separated, and I was pulled by the women on the left side. They put some kind\nof a babushka on my head.",
        "Q: A kerchief on your head?",
        "A: Yes, and they took us into captivity, we were running along this street of\nKrochmaina, then Karolkowa, to Wolska Street, then we kept running westbound\non Wolska Street. And that time I saw last time my father standing already with the\nhands up in front of Biernatzki \u2014 Biernatzki Palace. That was a big structure right\nin the back of that Clement\u2019s church. There was the last time I saw my father.",
        "Q: Oh really?",
        "A: Yes. And we were driven by force, running all the way to Warsaw west station.\nThe electrical trains were still operating, Warsaw west.",

        "Q: And you think that he\u2019s in either one of these places?",
        "A: Yes, yes. And I think there is a cemetery, Wolski Cmentarz. Wolski cemetery,\nthat they say that they buried ashes of about 50 - 60,000 people from Warsaw, all\nover. They were exhuming the dead and burning them. And by weighing, you\nknow, how much ash you get from one person, there were some 12 or 14 big trucks\ncarrying the ashes into a common grave at Wolski Cmentarz. And I visited this\nplace last time I was there in August. And there was a big ceremony, there was\nAmerican ambassador, there were Polish president Komorowski, and our new\nallies there was the German Bundeswehr, two officers, I took some pictures of\nthem; politely watching what was happening there. It was a big ceremony, and the\npeople came and by \u2014 by hundreds, thousands almost, to participate. They were four\nspiritual leaders. There was a rabbi, there was Orthodox church, there was\nevangelical pastor, and a Catholic, you know. And they were all praying for those\nthat were \u2014 this is the largest cemetery in the world actually, of 50 - 60,000 ashes of\npeople buried. And they have the whole yard [indecipherable] to build with these\nstones, you know, they look like a skull. And one older woman, she said, do you\nknow the symbol of these stones? But this is large area I\u2019m speaking of. And I said\n141January 27, 2015\nno, I don\u2019t know. These are supposed to, let\u2019s say symbolize the heads of the people\nthat were buried there. Wolski Cmentarz.",

        "Q: Got it.",
        "A: So when we were in Pruszk\u00e9w, the 600,000 [indecipherable] went through two\ncamps: Ozarow and Pruszkow.",
        "Q: And I had interrupted you to find out about your father. So you were telling me\nwhere you were being herded to, more or less, you were being forced to run to.",

Pruszkow was a camp where they were loading us into cattle cars\nafter two, three days of \u2014 of tremendous, tumultuous situation. People were looking\nfor each other, lost you know, wounded, sick. There was a Red Cross, and there was\n142January 27, 2015\nthat help e \u2014 help. This whole thing was a chaos, you know, there was the \u2014 people\nwere shocked. They were s-semi-alive. They were put by 70 to a freight car.

        "Q: Politics, right, right.",
        "A: \u2014 yes. So the \u2014 first were Germans. And then, what happened there, there was\nnight, and I remember Berlin on fire, you know, there was \u2014 under bombing, and I\nthink that the British at night were bombing it, because they were throwing these\n143\nJanuary 27, 2015\nphosphor bombs, and they looked like a Christmas tree. So anyway, I peeped\nthrough that hole \u2014",

So again, there was a segregation commission. We were out in the field,\nyou know, so latrines were dug up, so we could satisfy our physical necessities\nthere.

So there \u2014 the camp\n146January 27, 2015\nwas located on the \u2014 right by the railroad junction. There were at least four or five\nrailroad tracks, the main ones. Inside was the reloading ramps, about seven or eight\nreloading zebs \u2014 that they were distributing the war material, packages on whatever\nthe Germans stole in the western Europe, you know, that were sending over to their\nfamilies in Germany.

In this camp, there was international\nsociety. They were French, they were Belgians, they \u2014",
        "Q: Were you slave labor, or were you treated as prisoners of war?",
        "A: No, this was \u2014 th-this was a \u2014 a thing that the Germans didn\u2019t know what to do\nwith this, because on the 18, the pressure of allies in the west, exerted on the\nGerman government, forced the Germans to take all the AK people as allied army,\nand this was treated as the prisoners of war. Since I was the younger one, and then I\ncouldn\u2019t be, and then I was as a slave laborer, put to work. And this camp had the\nFrenchmen, Belgians, and there was a \u2014 a \u2014 Yugoslavs that \u2014 not the Tito guys, but\nMikhailovich?\n147January 27, 2015",

        "Q: Place.",
        "A: \u2014 section because they didn\u2019t recognize the Geneva Convention, they didn\u2019t have\nany Red Cross. Some of the barracks were marked with the Red Cross sign on top,\nbecause of the importance of that railroad junction. So they tried to show the allies\nup in the air, don\u2019t bomb, because this is a hospital, or whatever they thought for a\nmoment. But we were put on these ramps, and we worked hard for a bowl of soup \u2014",
        "Q: So was your \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 piece of bread.",

        "A: I would say about even.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Even, because, you know, the Reich at that time was already coming, in that\nagony, to an end; so they really didn\u2019t know what to do with us.",

        "Q: Yeah, 15.",
        "A: So, working on that ramp, we were stealing food sometimes. I\u2019Il never forget\nwhen I ate the pound of butter because I \u2014 I took the piece, you know, brick of\nbutter like this, and the German guard, he noticed that, you know, so he followed\nme, and he was waiting, and I went to satisfy my physical necessities, and I \u2014 to\ncover it up, I ate almost a pound of butter.",
        "Q: My word.",
        "A: Took a\u2014 I remember one Ukrainian there, he stole some tobacco leaves. And we\nwere checked on the end of the day, on \u2014 on our end of the day check-up, as we\nwere leaving for the camp again, th-the poor Ukrainian, or Russian at that time,\nwhatever was \u2014 he had a cap, and from the cap there\u2019s some parts of the leaves\nsticking out. And the Gestapo ask him now, did \u2014 what did you steal this time,\nIvan? He says, nothing, nothing. And then he lifted up his \u2014",
        "Q: Cap.",
        "A: \u2014 cap, and the leaves started flying down, and that was the end of the guy\nbecause they took him right away to the side. There was a bunker, there was a\nbunker in the middle of the station that looked like a innocent building like, but the\nwalls were about a yard thick. During the unexpected alerts, when the big boys were\n149January 27, 2015\ncoming over, and they were coming over by numbers, Americans were flying these\nfortresses, you know, that you would pray more and more, please.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They were the white streaks of their frozen exhaust.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And this was a massive attack, you know, because that was the method that they\nwere bombing was the carpet method.",
        "Q: Carpet bombing.",
        "A: They selected the certain [indecipherable] target [indecipherable] leveled off.\nGermans \u2014",
        "Q: So did \u2014 so did they go into this bunker, the Germans, that you\u2019re descry \u2014",
        "A: They used to save us by putting us at the very top. The German civilian families\nwere at the very safest bottom portion. The transit military, Germans that were in\ntransit, you know, going from place to place during the alert, they used to go in\nthere. And we were at the very top. So some of the prisoners of war that signed the\nagreement that they would like to work for the \u2014 you know, as civilians, they were\nthere. So they put us in the very top. We used to sing songs, and all the things that\nthe Germans were getting so aggravated, you know, because we were happy when\nthe bombing was going on. Praying more and more. That was one scene. Another\n150January 27, 2015\nscene was that th \u2014 there were transports of cattle. They pulled the cattle trains\nalong the ramps, and they sounded the alert. Sometimes alert lasted for three, four,\nor five days.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: So they pulled the trains away, during the alert, they pulled the trains away so\nthey would protect the material, whatever it was there. But when the bombed the\ntrain, they opened up these cattle cars. You know, there were so many cows out in\nthe field, running away.",
        "Q: Course. Poor animals.",
        "A: That we started cutting the meat from these cows, and taking it to the barracks,\nand we smeared the smell of the meat all over the place, so when the German\nguards came over with the dogs, the dogs were going crazy, because we were hiding\nthe meat in the attics of the barracks. Then we had the meat for a couple days,\ncooking and eating and so on. You know, this \u2014",
        "Q: And yet the dogs were only smelling the blood.",
        "A: Yeah. They were going crazy. Another scene I remember; we were in the movie\nbarrack, movie barrack, they were showing us their victorious times. Suddenly,\nexplosion took place, a big explosion. These covers that were closing the windows,\nyou know, were blown out. We saw flames all over the place. We run out of the\nJanuary 27, 2015\nbarracks, and we saw a plane that was shot down, and landed right between the two\nrows of barracks.",
        "Q: Oh wow.",
        "A: Yeah, the Germans said, oh finally, we shot one of the American planes, you\nknow. But we were forced to clean the remains next day, and the Germans told us to\nbring all these human parts, shoes, whatever. Parts that were showing, and I \u2014 I\nfound the German belt with the [indecipherable] you know. And \u2014 and the human\nleg and the \u2014 in the air force boots, you know, they were special boots, heavy, fur-\nlined, you know. And they finally recognized that this was a German plane. I think\nit was ME110, I think, Messerschmitt 110, two engine plane. Though there was\nsadness among them, to see that there was their own plane. What other scene I \u2014 I\nremember? Oh, this was the times when we started \u2014 they remove us. When the\nfront was getting closer and closer, they decided to move us out from the camp, and",
        "Q: So were you there for about half a year? How long were you there for?",

        "A: Yeah, yeah, Lehrte by Hannover. This was important ta \u2014 important town,\nLehrte, because of the railroad junction. And Misburg was another town,\nMisburg, where they had the artificial \u2014 artificial gasoline plant, you know, and\nthey were \u2014 dry distillation, whatever methods they were using, but they were\nmaking the gasoline. This was very, very, let\u2019s say sensitive [indecipherable]. The\nGermans used to use a special fog in order to envelop and cover it up. So we were\ngetting the clouds of the fog sometimes into that camp, so we couldn\u2019t breathe.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Anyway, when they were \u2014",
        "Q: Did you speak German? At that point, did you speak German?",

        "A: Ina way \u2014I don\u2019t think so, no.",
        "Q: No?\n153\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: No, no, cause I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t try to \u2014 to give them the privilege, you know. So\nI was still at heart a\u2014 a bloody Pole. So, when they marched us in the \u2014 that was\nnear Senda(ph) when \u2014 when I woke up with that carbine at my belly \u2014 you know,\nth-the \u2014 the thing was that the American soldiers had no noise in their army boots,\nthey were quiet at night, so they would \u2014 I had that carabiner at my belly, you\nknow, they look at me, and \u2014 and there was a \u2014 a captain, I think, that spoke Polish.\nHe was from \u2014 he was from Detroit.

        "A: No, this is \u2014 this is a de-delicate matter, because the allies were trying to\nconvince us to return back \u2014 to \u2014 to remove us from their backs, because there was\none and a half million refugees, slave laborers in Germany, and the countries of\ntheir origin were already under Russian occupation. So we had no place to go. So\nthe only thing was saving, let\u2019s say Polish necks, were that we had the units that\nwere under British command, that were part of the allied army. The General\n159January 27, 2015\nMarchuk(ph), and there was the paratroopers division, the Sosabowskis that were\noccupying certain parts of the British zone, was under Polish hands.\nWilhelmshaven was actually this was base of German \u2014 Donitz submarines,\nWilhelmshaven.",

        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: No.",
        "A: The \u2014 the Russians especially were afraid because the propaganda that they were\nfed, you know, that the west if inferior, west is so and so, and so and so, you know.\nSuddenly they were witnesses to something different. Many Ukrainians were hiding\namong the Polish DP camps. Many Russians were trying to falsify their papers to \u2014\nnot to be forced to return back.

        "Q: Okay. I mean \u2014 I-I mean more that Poland was so unprepared that it didn\u2019t have\ntanks of its own, that it didn\u2019t have modern military equipment. Is that so, or is that\na falsehood?",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. Hungarian Jews weren\u2019t deported from Hungary until March \u201944. So, in\nother words, they couldn\u2019t have been part of the Warsaw ghetto.

So, this process of fusing us together was actually a great, let\u2019s\nsay, accomplishment of the Catholic church, because they mostly \u2014 the Poles were\nof Catholic faith, and that was \u2014 the church was actually the strongest party that\nJanuary 27, 2015\nexisted in \u2014 in Poland. But then when Pilsudski became the Marshall of Poland \u2014\nthis was in 1914, and officially Poland regained her independence in the *18, he\nwas assigned a task of, let\u2019s say, fusing th-the different characters of people that\ngrew in different segments of the country.",

And let\u2019s say the Galicians were also a little\nbit closer to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to German influence.

The diaspora was about 400,00, so\nevery third Warsawian was of \u2014 of Hebrew faith. Some of them got more or less\nPoland-ized, then the \u2014 they were, let\u2019s say, getting with the Poles closer, and the\nother ones were dep \u2014 Poland was free, as far as the religion is concerned, so they\nhad their ow-own synagogues, they had their own traditions, and they grew in the\nenvironment that their predecessors are sort of giving them.

Actually in my classroom, I had many Jewish friends that especially \u2014\nThursdays were the days when they were teaching us religion; history of the\nCatholic churches, or at that time the \u2014 the Jewish minority was excused, they could\ntake a walk into the park, play soccer, or whatever.

        "A: That\u2019s right, you know, so I was what, eight, seven \u2014 seven, eight years old, so at\nthat time it was okay.\nJanuary 27, 2015",

        "A: Nowadays \u2014 nowadays they have Tlomackie Street, and there is a \u2014 a Jewish,\nlet\u2019s say library, and \u2014 and a small museum, because the main museum that was\nerected just th \u2014 one year ago, open up, it\u2019s one of the most beautiful, modern\nmuseum, they spend a lot of money. And I think the \u2014 the help came from the good,\nold U.S.A., you know, so \u2014 and then fa \u2014 I think contribution was also made by the\nPolish president to build in the area where they have nalewki(ph), and that was that\ninfamous Umschlagplatz. That\u2019s was the \u2014 the Jews were loaded on the trucks, and\ntaken over to Treblinka. So this was ex-Jewish district.",
        "A: Umschlagplatz was on the periphery of ghetto, you know, but it was inside,\ninside yes.",
        "A: And the railroad tracks at Stawki, there were, I think five tracks that the trains\nwere coming in, because there was a \u2014 sort of like a 10 \u2014 10,000 \u2014 10,000 a day\nwere trying to unload from Warsaw and send them to Treblinka.",

        "A: They were streetcars, but they were not used. Normally the cruel police force\nwere the actually Jewish police, because they were obliged to bring the contingent\nof so many Jews for that particular day, that were shipped to Treblinka.",
        "A: But foot, with \u2014 they were normally told that they are going east for some places\nthat they will be employed and work for the upkeep of their own lives, and so on.\nSo they were \u2014 they were lied about this designation of Treblinka, because this was\nthe end of the trip, so to speak, of \u2014",
        "A: By train, yes.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: No, I - let\u2019s see. I had my school located \u2014 let\u2019s start from a different point.\nThere were two ghettos actually. There was small ghetto, south of Wolska Street,\nwhich was main thoroughfare through Warsaw.",
        "A: And there was a large ghetto north of it.",
        "A: And normally they build a wall around small and large ghettos, so this whole\narea was isolated. Along the Wolska Street, between Wronia and Zelazna, this\nwas a point where two ghettos were \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 connected, yes.",
        "A: And they were also at the place like Zelazna and Chlodna, this was a bridge\nthat was connecting small ghetto with large ghetto. That bridge you could see in\nthat film of pianist, by \u2014",
        "A: Polanski, yes. This bridge I remember well, and that portion of wall, and the\nmain gate to the ghetto, I remember very well because my school was like \u2014 during\nthe occupation, you know, the secondary schooling was forbidden for the Poles.",
        "A: Hitler wanted us only to know how to count to a hundred, write and read, and\nthat\u2019s it. And we were designated for what they call konnektenvolk(ph).",

But in that trade school we had\nschooling, secondary schooling undercover, we say. We used to say yeah, pod\npokrywka gymnasium pod pokrywka. The secondary school was under the cover.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: So even we had the universities and polytechnics, everything was unofficially\nforbidden, but underground was acting. So, going to my trade school \u2014 actually, this\nwas the first class of gymnasium we call it, high school, I was passing the main gate",
        "A: \u2014 and actually right by that bridge, what you saw in that film.",
        "A: Walking there. So this was close. This portion was Aryan portion, so we saw it,\neverything what was going on behind the wall.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, the buildings. The street was divided by the wall, and these houses there,\nthe \u2014 cause ghetto was overpopulated. At that time, some of the houses are already\nempty, because that process of sending Jews to the death chambers in Treblinka\nwas \u2014 vacated a lot of space, leaving space in the buildings. So that was neglected.\nOn top of the wall, actually, the Germans set up machine guns. There were, actually\nat that time, some of the people that came from the ukra \u2014 Ukraine \u2014 Ukrainians\nJanuary 27, 2015\nwere guarding the Jewish ghetto, and Latvians were guarding the Jewish ghetto.\nAnd the Germans were in the supervisory positions.",

        "A: So they had the very good singers.",
        "A: Mm \u2014 no, no, no. But they had some practices during that time, so that we\nwalked in and we were permitted to look around, and \u2014\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: You know, war \u2014 Warsaw was actually like an international sort of a\nmetropoly(ph), and we had the majority Poles, okay, that was about 800,000 Poles\nat that time, and 400,000 were Jews.

I was always, let\u2019s say,\ncurious of what the other people, how they pray, what they do, and how the\nceremony goes, you \u2014 so I \u2014 I remember when I visited cerkiew, which was that\nOrthodox. The only thing that was \u2014 that I remember was the \u2014 a lot of herbs, and\nholy \u2014",

My father was working for the transportation com \u2014 company, and where\nhe was in the \u2014 in this storage, purchasing the tires, different parts for the buses that\nwere in the workshop, repaired. Our apartment consisted of one large room. There\nwas a bed, and two bedrooms, and a kitchen.",
        "A: You know, for Warsaw that was a nice \u2014",
        "A: Nice size of place. And the next, adjacent building was a large building, built\nduring the Tsarist times, I think, that they had three different factories. That was a\ntextile factory, there was some mechanical shop, and the top was some chemical\nestablishment there. So we didn\u2019t have many neighbors, you say civilians, because\nwe were part of that industrial complex. My mother was running a little cafeteria,\nfor one place, and the father was working for the Polska Linia Samochodowa,\nwhich was the transportation company.\nJanuary 27, 2015",

We could buy some good material for our, let\u2019s say\nweapons, even pistols and so on. So when I was arrested by the Germans, I was\nyoung \u2014 12 years \u2014 or 12 - 13 years old, and they put me in the prison on\nJanuary 27, 2015\nPoznanska Street, and I \u2014 they kept me there \u2014 because Germans actually gave to\nthe blue policeman.

And they gave me, as a youngster to the blue\npolicemen, and they put me in jail. So I spend there a few weeks, and what\nhappened is that I\u2014 I was young, undernourished, and I had some beginning of\ntuberculosis. So the Polish underground, when they saw what was happening to me,\nthey sent me to Olenika(ph), which was the sanitortum near Otwock.",

        "A: Yes, the school was number 100. It was a new building, built during the 20 years\nof Polish independence, and I remember it very well, because that was a walking\ndistance. And school was very clean, well illuminated. We used to have a very soft\n\u2014 soft slippers that we couldn\u2019t bring the shoes normally from the street, with the\nhard soles that would damage shining floors. Nice windows, big windows;\nclassrooms were spacious. So that was a nice time that I had during the time til\n1939 \u2014",

        "A: No, my \u2014 no, they didn\u2019t have a higher education. My mother completed high\nschool; and Father, he was sort of a business-minded man, and he did not get\nuniversity studies behind him. But he was, let\u2019s say a junior college, education-\nwise. And he served, during the time when Poland was still partitioned, he served\nin the Austria army, so his German was excellent, and partially I inherited the\nGerman language from him. So he was \u2014 during the occupation, he was employed\nby the Ostbahn. Ostbahn, east railroad \u2014 the Germans had westbound, eastbound,\nReich-bahn. So this was part of the Reich-bahn, and he was, as an interpreter,\nworking at the main central station there.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Yes. This was located on the Jerusalem alley, and it\u2019s still there, but the\nbuilding was completely, let\u2019s say, destroyed, but that area was used for the new\nstructure that is the center Warsaw station. Very nice building, near \u2014 near that \u2014\nJanuary 27, 2015\nwhat do they call it, the gift from Stalin, near the palace of the \u2014 the Stalin palace,\nbut this was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014a-\u2014a left \u2014 did you see that building?",
        "A: Yes. This was a style that the Russians ca \u2014 kept, that they preserved building the\nstructures according to the drawings that they made for their university in Moscow.\nSo the Alexanderplatz in Berlin was similar to this. Well, this was despised by the\nPoles, th-they used to laugh. I remember the first visit in Poland in 1950 \u2014 \u201959,\nwhen driving with the guy that was a taxi driver, he asked me, says, the best view of\nWarsaw? You know where you get the best view of Warsaw\u2019? He says, the best\nview of Warsaw you get from the palace. I said, oh yeah? Why is that so? Well,\ncause when you in the palace, you don\u2019t see the palace. You know, so \u2014",
        "A: Even the taxi driver, yes. He says that he \u2014 he was going a little further, he says,\neven that antenna that they built \u2014 they built that was a protective weapon that no\nPole could climb up on the very top and do things, dirty things. They hated the\nstructure, you know. It\u2019s still existing. It\u2019s like a monument of the Russian\noccupation of \u2014 of Poland. And this was a gift.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: My wife re \u2014 remembers this vividly because she was witnessing the erection of\nthat \u2014",
        "A: The construction of this, yes. I saw it finished. Now it\u2019s dark. When \u2014 when you\nsee when the two systems meet, the \u2014 th-the monument of the communism, versus\nagainst the \u2014 the \u2014 the capitalism, so to speak, of the skyscrapers, you know, na \u2014\nmodern buildings. It is \u2014 it 1s a contrast that you cannot simply understand, you\nknow, how the Russians could build such a awful structure in the midst of that\nmodern new Warsaw that is growing \u2014 growing up.",
        "A: You can \u2014 you can actually take a \u2014 Poland as an example of a migratory nation,\nbecause when you look \u2014 when you look at the history, the union with Lithuania\nwas what, 15\"\" century, when we were one country, Poland was actually the largest\nJanuary 27, 2015\nstate in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u20141n Europe; from the Black Sea all the way to the black \u2014 Baltic\nSea.",
        "A: And the borders were changing so much, going eastbound, westbound, and that\u2019s\nwhy the Poles are of some different characters, because the days of occupation\nchanged the people. And since the borders moved, the people moved.",
        "A: That was tr-tragic in a way, but when Polish borders were set up in Yalta,\nPotsdam and other places where the destiny of Poland was set up with the\nmatches, they were laughing that Churchill, Stalin and President Roosevelt, they\nwere setting up the borders of Poland with the m \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 matches. And then the famous Curzon line, the [indecipherable] of Curzon,\nyou know, that divided the portion of eastern part of Poland, and the western part\nof Poland.",

        "A: But that mixture maybe will give you a little better idea what \u2014 that time, in \u00b039,\nthere was that infamous pact of Ribbentrop-Molotov. Thirty-nine when the Russia\nwas befriended with Reich.",
        "A: With Germany. And this was \u2014 we call it the fourth partition of Poland, and the\nborder line, Curzon Line actually came into picture. Because now \u2014 it \u2014 there is a\ncertain similarity what they doing now in Ukraine, you know, when they coming to\nprotect their brothers and sisters, living in the administrative territory of eastern\nUkraine, that was happening in the eastern part of Poland. They came to resc \u2014\nrescue the Ukrainians minority that lived there, and the Byelorussian minority, and\nall the part of north \u2014 northeast part of Poland that\u2019s Lithuania nowadays. They\nwere trying to save their people from the Polish tyranny. So the borders were\nmoving and then we sometimes laughed that we have Poles with so many German\nnames, and we have Germans with the Polish names.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: They were, let\u2019s say Father, his brother owned a larger piece of land near Kielce.\nAnd Mother was living in that area, before they moved into Warsaw.",
        "A: So they were rather the agricultural, farmer \u2014 farmers.",
        "A: Yes. And when they lived in Warsaw, they changed their style completely.",
        "A: Yes, because you know, as they came from the smaller \u2014 smaller places, into big\ncity like this. So this was a major change \u2014",

        "A: Sister, for instance \u2014 we di \u2014 we were not rich, but we were pretty well-to-do,\nand Sister was going to ballet school. I was going to the normal public school, but\nlater on, during the occupation, they had to dish out money so I could go to the\nsecondary school, unofficial \u2014",

        "A: Living conditions were rough, very rough. People were rather concerned how to\nsurvive from day to day. They couldn\u2019t have any plans at all.",
        "A: I remember as a kid I used to say goodbye to my parents going to school,\nbecause I didn\u2019t know whether I \u2014 I am gonna come back, you know, in peace. So\ncity was living in a very, how shall I say, warlike atmosphere. Strit \u2014 streets were\nnot safe.

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Nervousness. Nervousness was a controlled \u2014 a very rude way by the\nGermans. At the beginning \u2014 that was \u2014 I\u2019m speaking of 1940, very rough winter in\nWarsaw, because it was very cold, and then \u201942 \u2014 42, \u201941 \u2014 \u00b042, when the\nseparation of the population was getting to the point that they build the ghetto, and\nthey separated Aryan population from the Jewish population. And then \u201943, the\nconditions started changing where that German behavior, after Korksk(ph) and\nStalingrad changed their attitude. They sort of mellowed down, you know, that\u2019s \u2014\nthat greeting of high Hitler, with the hand raised very high, changed a little bit like,\njust in case we lose, high Hitler with the little \u2014 smaller \u2014 smaller gesture. We were\nlaughing, and \u2014 but we sensed that was a city that was witnessing the change in the\nGerman attitude.

Let\u2019s say, we drew conclusions what was happening in the eastern\nfront, when we saw trains going through Warsaw with the German sol \u2014 German\nsoldiers, you know, that no ears, no noses, no hands, because of the frostbites, from\nthat famous Russian general.

        "A: Say Poles all together, they have, let\u2019s say, great interest in \u2014 in politics. And\nespecially since Poland was exposed to all different, let\u2019s say pressures from the\nwest, from the east. Discussions at the table, and friends of my father came over.\nThey were officers from the \u2014 active officers from the \u2014 from the Polish army. They\ndiscuss at the table the issues of Poland being such a strong country, that they \u2014 the\nGermans will attack Poland, we will resist, and then so on, and so on. So the talks\nwere on the subject of military efforts, and \u2014 an-and Europe at that time was sort of\nsensing oncoming second World War. So these discussions, I remember that the\nfather was discussing this. But when we had gatherings that my mother\u2019s brother\ncoming from Otwock for \u2014 sometimes for a weekends, or summertime, so we were\ngoing there, discussions were different, you know. Our schooling time, and then\nJanuary 27, 2015\nchanges in the economy that were improving little by little; because you know,\ncountry was actually devastated during the first World War, and the oppressors, the\noccupiers, they \u2014 they were taking their share. So we could not develop, just like\nwestern Europe developed free, and that momentum that they had could not be,\nlet\u2019s say, shown 1n the Polish economy.",
        "A: This is \u2014 actually, this was a false story. Some of the big cavalry units were\nsurrounded by the German, let\u2019s say motorized units. And when they locked in, they\ntried to escape, but they were not, let\u2019s say, crazy enough to attack with the lances\nagainst the German tanks, no.",
        "A: That\u2019s falsehood. We had air force.",
        "A: That\u2019s a\u2014 not as modern as the Germans had, but very effective.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: We had our own design, let\u2019s say WSK Kalisz and that PZL-11. These airplanes\nwere not large in numbers, because this was a developing industry in Poland, the\naircraft industry. The tanks, they were not built in Poland, but we had tanks vic \u2014\nVickers tanks from \u2014 imported from England. And we had the motorized units. We\nhad the motorized brigade that actually later on, became the first armored division\nin the west, under General Maczek, af you \u2014 if you heard.",
        "A: And when \u2014 when Poland army was formed, let\u2019s say we had so much\nexperience with the enemies that the army was indoctrinated well enough to be\nspiritually strong. Equipment-wise, we were inferiors to Germans. We were\ninferiors \u2014 spirit of fighting was much stronger maybe that the Germans had.",
        "A: Morality of the army was high, morale was high, but the equipment was inferior,\ninferior. But very effective. Because remember, when the \u2014 when the Germans\nattacked us from three directions, actually; from East Prussia, going south; from\nthe Reich, they were going east, and from the south, they were attacked through \u2014\nCzechoslovakia was already annexed by the \u2014 by the Reich, by the Germany.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: And at that time also Slovakia joined the German camp. So we had some \u2014 part\nof the invasion of ch \u2014 Slovaks into Poland, the German armies, and then armies\nfrom the East Prussia that was coming in.",
        "A: Yes, September 1939. So, wi\u2014 most of our defenses were directed against the\nGermans coming from the west. We did not expect the Russians will stab us in the\nback on the 17\" of September. They attacked to come and free their people that\nwere living in Kresy, which was the Volhynia, Polesie, Podole, and the\nNowogrdodek, closer to Lithuania, as we were. So Kresy were liberated, quotation\nmarks, by the \u2014 by the Russians.",

        "A: Yes, yes.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Yes, but we knew it. Don\u2019t forget that the Polish dwika(ph), which was the, let\u2019s\nsay, compared to \u2014 to FBI or CIA, the Secret Service, and so on, we had a very\ngood sensors everywhere in \u2014 in \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in Prussia and in \u2014 in Germany, especially in Berlin. And \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: And these were prior to the \u2014 prior to the outbreak of the war. We were pretty\nwell advanced in decoding German messages. \u201cEnigma\u201d is \u2014 that\u2019s the movie\nnowadays \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 going on, I don\u2019t know if you see it. I didn\u2019t see it, but I would like to see it,\nbecause there was a great contribution to the victory of the allied effort during the\nsecond World War, by giving the \u2014 giving the English and French the secrets of\nenigma. What was started was the getting in, was the mathematical school that the\nPoles attended in 1932. And the connections that the Germany had with East\nPrussia was via the enigma. They were sending codes, and all different secret\nJanuary 27, 2015\ninformation. So the Poles started getting interest in it, and Zygalski, Rafski(ph),\nand there was a third name that I forgot, but the \u2014 these were the three codebreakers,\nlater on that they work for the Polish secret service. And this was in July 1939,\nwhen from England, Poland signed the agreement to be defended by England and\nFrance, in case that we get attacked by the Germans. But anyway, going back to\nthat point that the British paid a visit to Poland, Pery(ph) was the name of the town\nin the suburb of Warsaw. Poles had copied two machines that were intercepted.\nWhen they send this to East Prussia, it went via Warsaw. So the secret service\ntook the machines, dismembered them, photographed them, do everything possible\nto reproduce the machines. And some of the copies were so identical that the\nGermans wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize which is the original, which is the copy.",
        "A: Yeah, so when they came over, the British, Knox and Denniston, I think, they\nwere two gentlemen, and the Frenchman, Bernard, Colonel Bernard came over,\nand they were actually exchanging their accomplishment that field of cryptology,\nwith the Poles. And they were very surprised when the Poles simply showed them\nthat, we have two gifts from you. One machine for the British, M \u2014 M \u2014 MI-6, I\nbelieve, and the French secret \u2014 military secret to Colonel Bernard.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Enigmas to our allies.",
        "A: I'd say, speaking of government, Polish government, when Poland was attacked,\nescaped, with a lot of trained personnel; most of the Polish airmen went through\nRomania \u2014 Romania was ally of Poland \u2014 and most of them escaped through\nHungary and Romania to the west.",
        "A: So when the government left Poland, ji\u2014 was General Rydz-Smigly, and\nMoscicki was the president. Moscicki was actually a \u2014 as \u2014 a Swiss. He was\neducated in Switzerland and so on. But anyway, when they left, the official, legal\nPolish government was formed in France. In exile, they \u2014 we called it.",
        "A: So through that government, and the connections of the Polish underground, and\nthe government in France, and later on when France was defeated, they moved to\nLondon. And then came picture of President Raczkiewicz, if you know, and then\nSikorski, General Sikorski. He was a premier of the Polish government in exile.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Through that government, and the connections of Polish underground, you\nknow, there was an exchange of news, views, and interviews, whatever was\nhappening in the west, and especially in the Germany. You know, so \u2014",
        "A: \u2014so they were well informed. The members of the underground in Poland was \u2014\nwere \u2014 were very well informed of what was behind the screen going on.",
        "A: Let\u2019s say, we had so many refugees in Warsaw during the war, as the Germans\nadvanced from the west \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 toward Warsaw. Eight \u2014 on the eighth day of operations, they were already at\nthe gates of Warsaw. So we had refugees coming from the west into Warsaw, and\nwe had refugees coming from the east into Warsaw. So, this melting pot, this city,\nJanuary 27, 2015\nthe capital city was sort of a source of all kind of gossip; good news, bad news. So\nthe people were pretty well informed.",
        "A: Even the \u2014 in the streets, average Pole not maybe educated well enough, but still",
        "A: \u2014 people say.",
        "A: And this was an exchange of news. Plus, you know, we had hidden radios, we\nwere listening to the BBC.",
        "A: September 1, 1939, prior the day to that outbreak and attack by the Germans, I\nwas walking with my sister toward the deli store nearby, and we were talking about\n\u2014 because the \u2014 that was in the atmosphere that Poles \u2014 we are so strong that if they\nattacked us, the third day, our forces will be in Berlin, you know. So I talked to my\nsister, I says, would you be \u2014 Helena, would you be interested to \u2014 to \u2014 to see the\nJanuary 27, 2015\nwar, what it is like? And she says yes, it will be very interesting. So, as kids, you\nknow, young people, we were talking about the oncoming disaster.",
        "A: Yes.",

The kids, but you know, th-th \u2014 the kids, let\u2019s say, in \u2014 in \u2014 in adopted\ncountry, here in United States, they are not as mature as the kids in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014\nliving in the conditions, wartime conditions. Kids mature fast. You know, when\nyou\u2019re in danger, y-you don\u2019t think about baseball, TV sets, and things at the time\nthat was not existing. But we were seriously interested of what was going on. When\nI joined the underground \u2014 maybe that\u2019s a subject later on \u2014",

        "A: We learn the first, when we saw the German airplanes flying over, and the Polish\nanti-aircraft artillery opened the full blast, whatever was necessary to protect our\nskies, I saw the dogfights of the Polish P-11 fighter planes in the sky. The\nMesserschmitts were much faster, and they were metal planes. But the planes that\nPoland had, had a very [phone ringing][break]",
        "A: The Polish planes. The anti-aircraft \u2014 actually, there was a heavy machine gun\nposition near that Clement\u2019s church, in their garden, you know, they set up near the\nchurch, because you know, the religious Germans would not maybe mount an attack\nsomewhat close to the church. But this \u2014 this post was manned by the \u2014 by the\nPolish army, and the anti-aircraft was very effective.",
        "A: I saw, let\u2019s say, smoke trails, three times. One was, I think, Polish airplane, and\nthen the two Messerschmitts went down. The conflict that lasted from first of\nSeptember til sixth of October, the losses that the Germans suffered in the air force\n\u2014 they say that the Polish air force was grounded and non-existing, on the contrary.\nI have a book written by Becker, a German writer, who said that first 16 days, there\nwas a very effective strength of Polish air force. Pilots were very well trained in\nDeblin air academy. And these pilots that were fighting in 1939 over the Polish\nJanuary 27, 2015\nskies, they escape through Romania, through France, to England. And they were\npart of the \u2014 part of the battle \u2014 Battle of Britain.",
        "A: The RAF, yes, that was the \u2014 Doening(ph), General Doening(ph), the head of\nthe RAF. He was very skeptical, because there was a language barrier, and actually,\nhe finally, when he saw what the damages the Luftwaffe did to the British, he\ndecided to accept the Polish contingent of air pilots, and there were two squadrons\nformed. Three or two, and three or through \u2014 three. Kosciuszko Squadron. I even\nhave a poster that I can later on show you. These pilots \u2014 if you saw a movie,\n\u201cBattle of Britain,\u201d there were Poles, very brave, and we had the highest score,\nbeating the Germans on equal basis, you know, because Spitfires and Hurricanes\nwere equivalent to Messerschmitts. Or Dornier, or whatever they had, the\nbombing airplanes, the Heinkels and Dorniers, and all the weapons that Goering\nprovided for \u2014 for the Operation Sea Lion, whatever it was, he wanted to put\nBritain on the \u2014 on her knees. And the fight was very, let\u2019s say, effective. So the\npilots, the pilots that left Poland, they put their talent to action in England, when\nthey had better airplanes, but the spirit very strong. The \u2014 the British were a little\nskeptical, because of the language, and we were not so very obedient. We had our\nJanuary 27, 2015\nstyle of fighting in the sky, and the guys really, when they attacked, th-th-the British\nsquadron leader at that time, there was a Canadian by the name of Kent. He was\ntrying to control the disobedience of Pole, how to attack the Germans, but the\nresults were rather \u2014 very effective. Realize that the Poles in England, with 15\nsquadrons, four bomber squadrons. We accounted for almost 1000 German planes\nshot in the air, th-the dogfights. One thousand, that\u2019s a big \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 big score.",
        "A: The 303 was the Kosciuszko Squadron. And why we named the Kosciuszko\nSquadron was the story of Kosciuszko heard that we got as a rep \u2014 re-reprocity.\nSee, the Poland regained her independence, thanks to President Wilson. And at that\ntime Americans wanted to pay the \u2014 pay the dues for \u2014 for fighting, for\nindependence of Poland from the Bolsheviks; this is the first World War. And 18\nAmerican pilots, Americans, they formed the squadrons that fought the Bolsheviks.",
        "A: And they were the Kosciuszko Squadron.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: And Kosciuszko name for the bri \u2014 Battle of Britain was with the insignia of the\nsame thing of Kosciuszko, with the American flag, with the two [indecipherable]\nlike this, I show you later on \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in that poster. But that was paid respect for the Poles for our, let\u2019s say,\ncontribution to the independence of the United States.",
        "A: That was now the General Pulaski that was, that died in Savanna, Georgia. The\nfather of American cavalry. And Kosciuszko, the father of West Point. I don\u2019t\nknow if you ever visited West Point?",
        "A: Yes, he started this whole thing, as a stronghold against the Brits.",
        "A: And there\u2019s a big bol \u2014 Kosciuszko monument in the square of the \u2014 and there\nare many \u2014 many artifacts, and remembrances. Jefferson was that \u2014",
        "A: He called Kosciuszko as a \u2014 the son \u2014 the true son of freedom.",
        "A: Yeah.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Yeah, West Point.",
        "A: That was acad \u2014 a military academy, yeah.",

        "A: My family, okay.",
        "A: This \u2014 we \u2014 on the 11\", I think, on the 11 of September, I saw the Germans\u2019\nplanes coming over and making some white streaks in the sky, and let\u2019s say a few\nhours later, a heavy artillery bombardment started.",
        "A: No, there were bombs \u2014 bombs bombing was, but not the part that we lived in.",
        "A: That was the direct hit that they started attacking the complex, because the repair\nshops of these transportation company, they looked like hangars, you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 buildings, and the other buildings were sort of industrial. So when they\nmarked, the artillery barrage started.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: And it was so powerful that the whole thing \u2014 we only were saving was our\nlives, that\u2019s all, because there was such a quick, rapid involvement in flames, under\nthe attack, that I remember we were trying to save one person that was locked\nbehind the doors, and we were trying to break the lock to get to, because when we\nfound it th-th-that a man had both legs cut off. So we tried to save him, but it was in\nvain. We saved one \u2014",
        "A: No, he was a repairman or a watchman in that company that was in the \u2014 in the \u2014\nin the repair shops, you know.",
        "A: The \u2014 the \u2014 the artillery shells were falling left and right. The char \u2014 the\nbuildings were inflamed. And \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and we were trying to save lives.\nPeople \u2014 wounded \u2014 wounded people, so I was running around, trying to find the\nrubber hoses from the gas ovens, to use as \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 tourniquets to stop the bleeding. We were carrying some of the wounded\npeople to the hospital next few blocks, on Plocka Street, in Wola. But whenever we\ndelivered them to the hospital, most of them were \u2014 bled to death. So, we couldn\u2019t\nJanuary 27, 2015\nsave them. But when the houses, our houses, our apartment were all destroyed. You\nknow who came to our rescue?",
        "A: We had orphanage across the street, orphanage of Korczak\u2019s. Korezak.",
        "A: Janusz Korezak. His real name was Goldsmith, I believe.",
        "A: Janusz Korezak gave us a protection in his house, that was somehow saved.\nAnd I was in the basement. He was feeding me the oatmeals for a couple weeks.",
        "A: Korezak. I knew him personally, yeah.",
        "A: How did I know him?",
        "A: In \u2014 he provided shelter for us. I remember he was in Polish uniform with the \u2014\nwith the rank of lieutenant, I think. The \u2014 he was in the Polish armed forces, in the\nuniform, because as a reserve officer.",
        "A: No, no \u2014\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A:\u2014no, no. We met during that disaster.",
        "A: Yes. His house still stays there. There\u2019s a monument of Janusz Korezak in the\nyard, in the courtyard.",
        "A: [indecipherable] I have some pictures of the \u2014",
        "A: Oh, Janusz Korezak was the educator and teacher, well-known in western\nEurope, how to develop a child\u2019s, let\u2019s say, spiritual background. And he was\nteaching the Polish schools about how to bring up the children the right way. He\nwas a doctor by \u2014 by profession. He was very well-known among the Poles, and\nalso abroad, as a writer, and teacher.",
        "A: What happened to him. When \u2014 when the Germans build the ghetto, he was\ntaken with the children \u2014 there was about 200 children \u2014",

        "A: All Jewish orphanage, yes.",
        "A: He was moved to Chiodna Street, that was a building where they\naccommodated them, and this was in the portion that I mentioned before, when the\nsmall ghetto was adjacent to the large ghetto through three, four blocks, between\nZelazna and Wronia, along the Chlodna Street, Chtodna Street. So I remember,\nas child going to that trade school, we had the backpacks. We used to use our\nblouses and backpacks for food. When we bordered the streetcar that was going\nthrough that three blocks of both ghettoes, we used to empty our \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 backpacks, and \u2014 and whatever food we could share, we were throwing it on\nthe street so the kids from the building actually were picking it up.",
        "A: Yes, yes, the \u2014 the police blew \u2014 policemen that were protecting people from\ngetting off the streetcar, or getting on the streetcar, because streetcar didn\u2019t stop in\nthat segment, you know, it was going from the Towarowa Street, which was the \u2014\nlet\u2019s say two blocks to Wronia, and then about four blocks to Zelazna. And this\nJanuary 27, 2015\nportion was off limits to the Aryans, and vice-a-versa. The Jews couldn\u2019t board the\n\u2014 the streetcars to get out from ghetto.",
        "A: Yes, the streetcars were going to through the main \u2014 main thoroughfares,\nthrough Warsaw, and through ghetto, with the \u2014 the streetcar, our streetcars, the\nAryan side, used to have the numbers. The Jewish portion, they used to have the\nStar of David \u2014",

        "A: Only to ghetto, yes.",
        "A: And after, let\u2019s say, that Chiodna Street, when things got bad, the Korezak\norphans were moved to Sienna Street, Sienna Street, which is close to the Palace\nJanuary 27, 2015\nof Science that Stalin gived. Even now when I visited Warsaw, there is a Korezak\nmonument near the fountain, you know, as he\u2019s embracing children.",
        "A: No.",

        "A: I would say, yeah \u2014 about that, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, he was \u2014 he was \u2014 he was delivering the o \u2014 oatmeals, you know, I was\nexhausted from that fire and then that shock from the artillery bombings, so I was\nsort of shaken up to the point that he had to calm me down with \u2014 whenever he was\nbringing the hot oatmeal to me, he was almost feeding me, so I could eat, you know.\nSo, he was very soft.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, he said, you look very, very tired to me, you look very tired, so I have to\nhelp you to rebuild your strength.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Because you know, during the siege of Warsaw that lasted 28 days, our food\nsupplies were exhausted. The water was short, a shortage of water, and the\nresistance was strong, very strong. We defended Warsaw for so long, and the\nGermans admired the \u2014 the knighthood of the Polish army that I\u2019m after. Because\nde-defending Warsaw was a guy by the name of Rommel, General Rommel, the\nPolish side. I don\u2019t know if there was any connection of that Erwin Rommel in\nAfrica, or Rommel General.",
        "A: Yeah, Rommel \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. Juliusz Rommel. And there was another general, Czuma, Czuma, [ think\nhis son was here in Chicago for a while, but he returned to Poland. Czuma.\nCzuma, c-z-u-m-a, Czuma.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: On the orphanage, what we did is, portion of the building that was not\ncompletely damaged, so to speak of, so we covered the windows that were all\nbroken, the floor, the doors. We tried to rebuild whatever space was available.",
        "A: Ah, no, no, no.",
        "A: Thi-This whole thing was collapsed. The next \u2014 next possession, next building\nwhich I mentioned to you, this was a portion of that was offices, portion were this\nmechanical shop, or textile shop and some chemical stuff that they were doing\nupstairs. Portion of the offices we converted to our, let\u2019s say, primitive living\nquarters. No water. The windows we covered with whatever. We didn\u2019t have\nplastic, but there was something very foggy that we covered too, because the winter\nof 1940 was so severe that \u2014 frost was so strong that the pigeons were falling off the\nbalconies.",
        "A: Very severe winter, minus 40 centigrade, almost.",
        "A: Yes.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: And there we was \u2014 we were \u2014 let\u2019s say, the Germans, when they entered the\ncity, some of the squares they set up the salamanders, you know, they were\nsalamanders, they were like a coke ovens, and they heated up so the people could \u2014\ncould warm themselves. And Wehrmacht at that time, they set up field kitchens \u2014\ncan you imagine, for the civilians. The Wehrmacht was behaving like a regular \u2014\nregular army. No \u2014 no behavior like the SS, or \u2014 or \u2014 or the, let\u2019s say gent \u2014 the \u2014\nthe field police. Later on when the secondary units came, the Wehrmacht left, you\nknow, so there was a change in attitude toward the civilians.",
        "A: I returned back to the next possession actually, that was adjacent to the area\nwhere we lived. After the fire, we rebuild it. I remember we had two rooms at the\nbeginning, the whole family. And there was a family by the name of Bront(ph),\nBront(ph). I think that was a \u2014 a German citizen, and his wife was Polish,\nBehrowska(ph), and they had a daughter, Danuta(ph). And I think this family,\nbecause of the German roots, they signed the volks \u2014 Volksliste. They sign up to be\npart of, let\u2019s say that superior race. So they lived in the two \u2014 they displaced us from\nthe two rooms, and they \u2014 we were moved to the single room. Four people, single\nJanuary 27, 2015\nroom. So, they later on moved out from the area, into a special section of the city\nthat was reserved for the Germans.",
        "A: They\u2019re a couple, they had one child, there was \u2014 that was Danuta(ph). And\nwhen she came to visit us during the occupation, she was that hio \u2014 the ha \u2014\nHitlerjugend, but she was the madel, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014madel. Wundersdeutches madel. Yeah, she came in uniform, and we\ncouldn\u2019t talk too much to her, even though they were \u2014 she was very befriended\nwith my sister, going to the ballet school together.",
        "A: It\u2019s changed, yes. Now, I remember when I walked in when they were occupying\nthat two room apartment, I remember the Griffarts(ph) on the wall. You know the\nname Griffarts(ph)?",
        "A: Oh, the German staff officers used to call Hitler Griffarts(ph).",
        "A: Griffarts(ph). This was abbreviation of \u2014 of griisste \u2014 griisste feldherr aller\nzeit. The \u2014 the \u2014 the greatest field Marshall of all times.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Griffarts(ph), yeah.",
        "A: Well, you know, the Wehrmacht were \u2014 tha-that was endearment \u2014 I \u2014 I rather\nnot, because later on Hitler acted like a strategist, because he had dreams, you\nknow. So \u2014 so \u2014",
        "A: At night, yeah \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that he was trying to implement these dreams into the action, you know.\nManstein \u2014 Manstein, his number one strategist on the eastern front, he had to\nlisten to the fuehrer, you know. So the officers among themselves, from time to\ntime they used the name \u2014",
        "A: He had the fuehrer on the wall, so that \u2014 to us it was a shock.",
        "A: Feldherr aller zeit.\n69January 27, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 zeit, yeah. Griffarts(ph).",
        "A: Yeah.\nBeginning File Two",
        "A: Griffarts(ph).",
        "A: Groste Feldherr aller zeit.",
        "A: Superiority of race. This \u2014 the \u2014 they disconnected our good relations.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Let\u2019s say the control of the city \u2014 I think that was a Fisher, the \u2014 the governor of\nthe city, because Frank was \u2014 Frank was in Krakow. Krakow was the head \u2014 ci \u2014\nthe main city of GG, government gubern \u2014",
        "A: Gouvernement, yeah. General na gubernia(ph)",
        "A: And Warsaw was a city of transit for the Germans to the eastern front, one of\nthe cities. So the character of the city was changed. A lot of military uniforms\nwe ve seen in the streets everywhere, that they were occupying the best place to,\nlet\u2019s say, live and be treated. So most of the theaters, restaurants, were with the\ninscription, nur fiir Deutsche, for Germans only.",
        "A: So streetcars, even streetcars, you know, they had the platform, front platform on\nthe streetcar there was nur fur Deutsche, only for Germans. Sometimes when there\nwere too many, let\u2019s say, attacks on the Germans, or too many of their side weapons\ndisappeared, because in the crowd, the streetcar, many times, you know, the AK\nwere cutting their holsters, and stealing their weapons, and so on, and so on. So they\nwere changing the platform, sometimes in front, sometimes in the back. But this\nwas strictly for Germans. And a city, as such, you know, was divided for the Aryans\nJanuary 27, 2015\nand the Jews. The ghetto was formed, the wall was built, and the minority of the\nJews, which was the largest diaspora in the world; I think maybe more than in New\nYork; so they were put into either small ghetto, or large ghettos. A small ghetto\nactually, delicately speaking, was reserved for the well-to-do \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Jews. Yes. And the large ghetto was \u2014 well, the Germans used the term\nlumpenproletariat.",
        "A: Did you hear that one?",
        "A: Lumpenproletariat. So the poor Jews were in the large ghetto.",
        "A: And, well, the annihilation of the Jewish race started right from the beginning,\nwhen they activated Treblinka, which was the closest crematorium, closest to\nWarsaw.",
        "A: Yes.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 okay, my sister was working for a food \u2014 food \u2014 food factory, and my\nfather, as I mentioned, because of his knowledge of German language, he was used\nas a interpreter.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Most of the Polish industry, which was in the city, and the workshops\nand the \u2014 all kind of places where they could use for the war machinery for the\nThird Reich \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they immediately activated that, an-and they were trying to give some kind of a\npriority to produce the machinery of war. Like for instance, that building nearby,\nwhat we lived in, the section that there were offices converted to apartments. Now,\nthis portion of the building, the \u2014 what was saved after the bombardment, they\nrepaired whatever they could, but the basement and the first floor, what they were\ndoing, they were building field kitchens, you know, just like the first World War,\nthat was on wheels. All these containers and they were cooking the meals for the\narmy. So \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, so this was a place, pretty active.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Manufactured there, yes, by the Poles. And the production was for the\nWehrmacht. I remember a visit one day that \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether he was a\nReichsdeutsche or Volksdeutsche. I think he must have been Reichsdeutsche\nbecause he had that Tyrolean hat with the little \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 brush.",
        "A: Feathers. And he came over, visited. He came in a Skoda, Skoda, that was\nCzech car, very nice car. And he inspected the facilities, you know.",
        "A: No, he was a\u2014 a~\u2014a private \u2014 private \u2014 a civilian uniform, yeah, civilian\nuniform.",
        "A: I would say yes. I didn\u2019t see any in uniform, any people in uniform. There was\nthe guy that came over a couple times, you know, to inspect the facility, and see\nwhat there is \u2014 the production rate, or whatever.\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: I would say so, because he had that round sign \u2014 badge of Reichsdeutsche \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you know, they used to have these badges on their lap \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, patel \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s \u2014 it was \u2014 it \u2014 it looked like a Ebermensch(ph).",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: You know, we \u2014 we sometimes improvised things as we need. So I remember\nmy father built his own little oven, connected to the stack, to the chimney, and we\nwere cooking right on two \u2014 two \u2014 let\u2019s say two burners, not burners, but fire\n[indecipherable] what we had that was something, a hotplate like. So this was the\npart, and the sanitary facilities, they were using some toilets that were left, you\nknow, with \u2014\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: Yeah \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 of the office, so the primitive and very s-simple way, and the \u2014 the idea was to\nsurvive, so we did not complain too much.",
        "A: Heating \u2014 hm?",
        "A: This \u2014 heating, we were boiling the water, you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in that little stove that we had. The washing facilities, there used to be a public\n\u2014 the public shower stations in the city, so we utilized these.",
        "A: But then we were heating the water in some tub, you know, and then washing\nourselves the best we could.",
        "A: There was a lack of everything, you know. Soap was scarcity, paper was a\nscarcity. Bread tha-that was made for the Poles. Sometimes we were laughing that\nthat bread was just like a \u2014 like a \u2014 like a board, not properly baked in the \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014\nin enough time to make it edible, to make it edible. They didn\u2019t use the flour, they\nJanuary 27, 2015\nused the sawdust underneath in the ovens, you know, so \u2014 so this was a substitute.\nEverything was ersatz.",

That was not for the production, for\nthe Germans, was strictly controlled by \u2014 by the Germans, you know, so they \u2014 they\nwere very careful.

        "A: \u2014 to mediocre salaries. Because this money what the Germans issued had no\npurchasing power.",
        "A: Like for instance, if you went for the black market to buy food in the country.\nThe farmers used to accept only the pre-war money, which was silver coins. Silver\ncoins, you know, the tens ztotys, five zlotys, two zlotys. They were silver. I-I think\nat about 60 or 70 percent pure silver. So they knew the metal value, and they were\nselling food for this kind of bouillon.",

He, let\u2019s say, cooperated, if there was some assignment to report, yes.\nBut I don\u2019t think that he was fully sworn in, an-and \u2014 and \u2014 and working for the \u2014\nfor the underground. Let\u2019s say Poles were all members of the underground. We\nwere all, let\u2019s say, sympathetic to the people that were actually the activists, you\nknow, and the civilians were cooperating every time there was a situation, a\ndangerous situation, so they did help.\nJanuary 27, 2015",

It still exists, partially, the uprising \u2014 survived the siege of 1939. There are\nonly three or four columns. If you\u2019ve been in Warsaw, maybe you saw it, the tomb\nof unknown soldier. Anyway, this was Pilsudski square. When Hitler came to\nWarsaw for the victory parade, as a gift they changed the name of many streets to\nGerman sounding names, and this was changed to Adolf Hitlerplatz. And in front\nJanuary 27, 2015\nof Poniatowski monument, they put a big sign of Victoria, and that victory sign\nunderneath was Deutschland siegt am allen fronten.",

And this commission was\njoined by the Red Cross, and they all went to the passive disc \u2014 discovery of these\nbig, massive graves, and they selected the caliber of the guns that they were using to\nshoot them in the back \u2014",

It could be like this, because there was even a negotiation between the\nallies, the \u2014 the Germans demanded trucks for trading freedom for these Jews.\nThere was something secret that I \u2014 I never, let\u2019s say, analyzed this so deep, but\nthey were trying to save the Jews by giving some \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 material for them.",
        "A: But these Jews were brought from Hungary, yes.",
        "A: Hungarian Jews.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes. And these \u2014\nJanuary 27, 2015",
        "A: No, the ghetto, the ghetto, the small and large one was already finished.",
        "A: Well, these activities I mentioned to you, the little sabotage that we had \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 on the bridges, and then the posters, and then the inscriptions of PW \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in different places, to show that we still existing. And marking the theaters and\nthe \u2014 sabotaging the German propaganda slogans. So, this was the activity of 1942 -\n\u00b043, until the uprising, yes.",
        "A: What happened, the uprising started on the first of August.",
        "A: I was near \u2014 near that Janusz Korezak building, and \u2014",
        "A: Orph \u2014 the cro \u2014 across the street, yes, and the last meeting we had with the\npatrol one, we said that we are going together at Kartselak(ph), which was a\nmarketplace right at the Wolska Street, that main thoroughfare, and Towarowa,\nJanuary 27, 2015\nand Przyokopowa, this was a large square, like a Maxwell Street in Chicago, you\nknow, there were little stands that the people were selling. Anything that your heart\ndesire, the black market at that time.",
        "A: So, the meeting didn\u2019t come through because of the beginning of uprising was\nscheduled for five o\u2019clock [indecipherable] stands for walka(ph). And there was\nsupposed to be at five, but it started at the different time. So what happened was that\nI simply joined the newly formed company, 315, across the street in that building of\nJanusz Korczak.",
        "A: And what the \u2014 happened, they assigned me to be the observer. So I was posted\non that highest point of that building that was safe from that siege during the 1939.\nAnd I was watching the Germans coming Karolkowa Street, toward the Wolska.\nThis was street \u2014 side street, but anyway important, because they tried to clear both\nsides of Wolska, so the German traffic would go free, without any side \u2014 side\nattacks. But what we did over first and second of the uprising day, we build a\nbarricade and a deep ditch on Karolkowa Street. So the Germans, when they came\nover, to the point I saw them, I was reporting down that there is a German armor car\nwaiting, but they hesitating to cross because of the obstacle. Then \u2014 this was couple\n132January 27, 2015\ndays like this, and then, before \u2014 actually, before uprising started, I was put to work\nby cleaning some old rifles that were recovered from the hiding places, for an attack\nby the grownups, of that School 100. Because School 100 that I attended during \u2014\nbefore the war \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 this whole building was converted to a rest house for the Germans. All the\nnicer buildings \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, this was converted to a shelter for the Germans that were coming to\nWarsaw to rest, after the battle fatigue \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 whatever they had in the east, or \u2014 they were re-convalescence after they were\nwounded, whatever. Most of the better buildings were taken by the Germans, by the\nGermans. So anyway, this attack failed, because the Germans were armed to the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 kin. And this thing was a failure.\n133January 27, 2015",
        "A: So the next operation, what happened was, on the V separation of two streets,\nTowarowa and Przyokopowa, there was a German repair shop, for German\nvehicles. So, we were told that we have to get gasoline for the Molotov cocktails.\nAnd I remember from 1939 I had these flare \u2014 flare gun.",
        "A: That was my weapon. There was one guy that \u2014 with the saw off Mauser, you\nknow, carbine? Anyway, when we \u2014 there was about five of us, two mechanics, and\nthere were two, three of younger ones, you know, and we entered that place, the\nGermans got scared off. They got on a\u2014 motorbikes, and they left. So we started\ngetting the cars into some kind of a position that maybe we can start \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 drive them out. So one of the mechanics, you know, he was able to \u2014 the car\nhad the four tires on. The others didn\u2019t have the tires on because they were over the\n\u2014 what they call, the tunnels, that they were \u2014",
        "A: Repairing, yeah.",
        "A: So the one with the four tires was okay, so he started this car. But in the\nmeantime, what I was doing 1s I was collecting into jerry cans \u2014\n134January 27, 2015",
        "A: You know the jerry cans are.",
        "A: Those 20 liter \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 metal containers. I was sucking \u2014 siphoning the gasoline from the ones that \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 have the tires on, that was getting ready for repairs.",
        "A: So I was able to put about two \u2014 two \u2014 two of these canisters, jerry cans \u2014",
        "A: With the rubber hose.",
        "A: Sucking it in. Once it started, you know, then the gasoline was dripping out.\nAnyway, I was \u2014 this was the most precious liquid at the time, because the company\n315 was waiting for delivery of weapons, but it never materialized, you know, they\ndidn\u2019t get it. So the most effective weapons were the Molotov cocktails. Some of\nthe units that were on the barricade on Gorezewska Street, parallel to Wolska, right\nat Miynarska, these were barricades attacked by the Germans, and they were trying\n135January 27, 2015\nto really break the opposition at any cost. They were even putting civilians in front\nof their tanks, and \u2014 and \u2014 and approaching the Polish points of resistance \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, so we would stop shooting, you know, at our own people. And anyway, I\ndelivered \u2014 I could carry the whole jerry can, but I take half of it, couple times. I\nwalked from Krochmaina, from that Janusz Korezak place, and | carried this over\nto Gorcezewska Street, which was a distance of at least five, six, seven blocks, as a\nsmall kid, with a friend of mine.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And you know, they welcomed me at the barricade when I brought that gasoline,\nbecause whenever Germans approached \u2014 and the houses on the left, and on the\nright, you know, had these bottles, you know, these things were very dangerous for\nthe Germans [indecipherable] we set the fire to a tank, you know, the \u2014 the \u2014 the\ncrew was jumping out.",
        "A: So this was one of the major operations. Then this other one \u2014 oh, this was\nsomething that I\u2019ll never forget. We were told, for the areas that were already freed\n136January 27, 2015\nfrom the Germans, to hang our national flags in front of the houses. And this was a\n\u2014 boo-boo, because the Germans marked the areas they saw the flags; there were\nobservation planes flying over, and three Stukas came over, and bombed again, the\narea where we lived in.",
        "A: They flatten it out. I remember as a ki \u2014 that I was \u2014 I \u2014I was holding a\u2014a-\u2014a\nradiator, you know, on the first floor, and somehow I was found semi-conscious in\nthe \u2014 in the basement.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: From that flattening out. And then, after this, we all took a shelter in the\nKorezak\u2019s building \u2014 Korezak\u2019s building. And then \u2014 that was August third or\nfourth, the Germans brought R.O.N.A., you heard of R.O.N.A.? R-o-n-a. That was\nRusskaya Osvoboditelnaya Narodnaya Armiya.",
        "A: The Russian freedom \u2014 freedom army. This was General Vlasov, you heard of\nGeneral Vlasov?\n137January 27, 2015",
        "A: This was a traitor. This wa \u2014 he was a Russian, and he recruited the Ukrainians,\nand Russians, whoever was available, and some \u2014 some Mongols from the Azure,\nto put them to work on Poles, the rebellious Poles, and finish us off.",
        "A: Volunteer \u2014",
        "A: Yes, Vlasov, yeah.",
        "A: Vlasov army.",
        "A: Yes. They had the Cossacks \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 hats, with the Hakenkreuz, and the German Wehrmacht uniforms, and some\nof them had the SS marks. So they were special troops.",
        "A: Aside from them look, they had that R.O.N.A. badges on their left arms.\n138January 27, 2015",
        "A: And they were used to especially quench the partisan war \u2014 partisan war in the\ncountries occupied by the German armies. These were under the command of\nGeneral Bach, von dem Bach.",
        "A: Von dem Bach. He was in charge, a specialist for the partisan warfare. He was\nin Warsaw operation on, I think, the fourth or fifth of August. And he was the guy\nthat stopped the mass mor \u2014 murders of that district Wola. Because during that time\nwhen the R.O.N.A. came into picture, and they started shooting civilians, 50,000 of\nar \u2014 Soviets lost their lives because they were cleaning up, mercilessly, all the side\nstreets, and every courtyard was a cemetery.",
        "A: Yes, yes. To the point when that was the fifth or sixth of August, I was in the\ncourtyard \u2014 that\u2019s where we lived \u2014 and I was in the basement, and some civilians\nwent into basements and they were hiding there. The windows were covered with\nthe sandbags, and some metal plates to protect from any kind of outside attack.\nWhen the R.O.N.A. soldiers came over, they had this German potato mashers, you\nknow, these grenades with that little handle on? They used to combine these\ngrenades together and make the bundle of them, and they used to open that little\nwindows and they were tossing into the basement of people. And this was almost\n139January 27, 2015\nunbelievable scream of people dying in the basements. And they took us, the live\nones, they took us outside the building. You know, my father was already with \u2014 old\nmen separated, and I was pulled by the women on the left side. They put some kind\nof a babushka on my head.",
        "A: Yes, and they took us into captivity, we were running along this street of\nKrochmaina, then Karolkowa, to Wolska Street, then we kept running westbound\non Wolska Street. And that time I saw last time my father standing already with the\nhands up in front of Biernatzki \u2014 Biernatzki Palace. That was a big structure right\nin the back of that Clement\u2019s church. There was the last time I saw my father.",
        "A: Yes. And we were driven by force, running all the way to Warsaw west station.\nThe electrical trains were still operating, Warsaw west.",
        "A: Well, there were two stories that I heard. That the executions of men during the\nvols \u2014 vol \u2014 vol \u2014 Wola massacre, the execution of the men were two places: one,\nthe Saint Albert church on Wolska Street, and then Franaszek factory. This was\nchemical factory when they were executing men by hundreds and hundreds of them.\n140January 27, 2015\nAnd when they ki \u2014 were killed, I heard that they were piled up, you know, the live\nones were piling the dead ones, and pouring gasoline over, and burning.",
        "A: Yes, yes. And I think there is a cemetery, Wolski Cmentarz. Wolski cemetery,\nthat they say that they buried ashes of about 50 - 60,000 people from Warsaw, all\nover. They were exhuming the dead and burning them. And by weighing, you\nknow, how much ash you get from one person, there were some 12 or 14 big trucks\ncarrying the ashes into a common grave at Wolski Cmentarz. And I visited this\nplace last time I was there in August. And there was a big ceremony, there was\nAmerican ambassador, there were Polish president Komorowski, and our new\nallies there was the German Bundeswehr, two officers, I took some pictures of\nthem; politely watching what was happening there. It was a big ceremony, and the\npeople came and by \u2014 by hundreds, thousands almost, to participate. They were four\nspiritual leaders. There was a rabbi, there was Orthodox church, there was\nevangelical pastor, and a Catholic, you know. And they were all praying for those\nthat were \u2014 this is the largest cemetery in the world actually, of 50 - 60,000 ashes of\npeople buried. And they have the whole yard [indecipherable] to build with these\nstones, you know, they look like a skull. And one older woman, she said, do you\nknow the symbol of these stones? But this is large area I\u2019m speaking of. And I said\n141January 27, 2015\nno, I don\u2019t know. These are supposed to, let\u2019s say symbolize the heads of the people\nthat were buried there. Wolski Cmentarz.",
        "A: Mother and sisters, they were all put into concentration camp Pruszkow.\nPruszkow was concentration camp 121. Pruszk\u00e9w was the station, let\u2019s say, in the\nwestern part of the city. That\u2019s where they converted railroad repair shop into a\ncamp for the civilians brought to it.",
        "A: So when we were in Pruszk\u00e9w, the 600,000 [indecipherable] went through two\ncamps: Ozarow and Pruszkow.",
        "A: Yes, this was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014to Warsaw west. Warszawa zachodnia, Warsaw west. That\u2019s where we\nboarded the trains that took us over to Pruszk\u00e9w, that was I don\u2019t know, 20\nkilometers away. Pruszkow was a camp where they were loading us into cattle cars\nafter two, three days of \u2014 of tremendous, tumultuous situation. People were looking\nfor each other, lost you know, wounded, sick. There was a Red Cross, and there was\n142January 27, 2015\nthat help e \u2014 help. This whole thing was a chaos, you know, there was the \u2014 people\nwere shocked. They were s-semi-alive. They were put by 70 to a freight car. When\nthey loaded the freight car, there was about 40 \u2014 40 \u2014 40 cattle cars. And that train\nmoved toward Reich, toward Germany. And we were transported \u2014 the first stop\nafter seven days, no water, no nothing, you know, the car was locked. And there\nwere \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, and there was barbed wire in the windows. We had one \u2014 one older guy\nwith the \u2014 with the knife, scissors. So he was cutting the openings in the floor of\nthat car, so this was our \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 toilet. Toilet, yes. There was 70 people almost, in the car. You know, first stop\nwas Oranienburg. You heard of Oranienburg? It was a concentration camp that\nthe Germans built \u2014 built for the Germans, and all those that did not comply with\nthe German philosophy \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yes. So the \u2014 first were Germans. And then, what happened there, there was\nnight, and I remember Berlin on fire, you know, there was \u2014 under bombing, and I\nthink that the British at night were bombing it, because they were throwing these\n143\nJanuary 27, 2015\nphosphor bombs, and they looked like a Christmas tree. So anyway, I peeped\nthrough that hole \u2014",
        "A: That was the beginning of August. There was the seven \u2014 no, eight te \u2014 middle,\nmiddle, yeah.",
        "A: Middle of August. And when we stopped there, what happened 1s that they\ndisconnected three or four cars. And the train was moving at night, not during the\ndaytime, because daytime, any moving train was attacked by the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 by the allied, you know, so at night we moved, and the next stop was Weimar.",
        "A: Weimar, near to Buchenwald.",
        "A: Yeah. That was a place that Schiller and Goethe was creating.",
        "A: Yes, Weimar.\n144January 27, 2015",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Buchenwald, yes.",
        "A: And so they disconnected three or four cars. They were distributing the mar \u2014 th-\nthe manpower according to whatever they \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 scheduled, yes.",
        "A: So after that, you know, the train started moving at night again, and the next\nstop, I\u2014 I\u2014 we knew already that something\u2019s gonna happen there. We don\u2019t \u2014 I use\nthe word [indecipherable] you know, as I mentioned to you on the phone, that you\ndidn\u2019t know the expression \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that we either will be freed going through a stack, though a chimney.",
        "A: Or we wil \u2014 gonna be put to work for the Reich.\n145January 27, 2015",
        "A: So when they moved the train from Weimar, Buchenwald, the next stop was,\nafter a few days \u2014 at night, we travel at night, and we stopped at Bergen-Belsen.\nThe \u2014",
        "A: The sightseeing tour, nice.",
        "A: Bergen-Belsen was a place well-known already. That\u2019s where they killed many,\nmany Jewish people and international people that were kept in the \u2014 1n this death\nmachine. So again, there was a segregation commission. We were out in the field,\nyou know, so latrines were dug up, so we could satisfy our physical necessities\nthere. And after medical commission, you know, they, luckily, put us into a group\nof people that can be still used for work.",
        "A: And then Bergen-Belsen, they took us to camp. This was near Hannover,\nLehrte, Lehrte, l-e-h-r-t-e, Lehrte.",
        "A: And this was a junction, a railroad junction, important ra-railroad junction\nbetween Hannover and all the ruhrgebeit(ph) coming through Hannover toward\nBerlin [indecipherable] Berlin and all the other main cities. So there \u2014 the camp\n146January 27, 2015\nwas located on the \u2014 right by the railroad junction. There were at least four or five\nrailroad tracks, the main ones. Inside was the reloading ramps, about seven or eight\nreloading zebs \u2014 that they were distributing the war material, packages on whatever\nthe Germans stole in the western Europe, you know, that were sending over to their\nfamilies in Germany. So we worked for 12 hours a day.",
        "A: Yes, from one car, say that was sorted out that this car will go to Bremen, this\ncar will go to Hamburg, you know, so we were distributing, we were getting the\nshipment orders, and we knew what to do. In this camp, there was international\nsociety. They were French, they were Belgians, they \u2014",
        "A: No, this was \u2014 th-this was a \u2014 a thing that the Germans didn\u2019t know what to do\nwith this, because on the 18, the pressure of allies in the west, exerted on the\nGerman government, forced the Germans to take all the AK people as allied army,\nand this was treated as the prisoners of war. Since I was the younger one, and then I\ncouldn\u2019t be, and then I was as a slave laborer, put to work. And this camp had the\nFrenchmen, Belgians, and there was a \u2014 a \u2014 Yugoslavs that \u2014 not the Tito guys, but\nMikhailovich?\n147January 27, 2015",
        "A: Mikhailovich. So Serbs were there, and the Russians were kept in a different \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 section because they didn\u2019t recognize the Geneva Convention, they didn\u2019t have\nany Red Cross. Some of the barracks were marked with the Red Cross sign on top,\nbecause of the importance of that railroad junction. So they tried to show the allies\nup in the air, don\u2019t bomb, because this is a hospital, or whatever they thought for a\nmoment. But we were put on these ramps, and we worked hard for a bowl of soup \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 piece of bread.",
        "A: I would say about even.",
        "A: Even, because, you know, the Reich at that time was already coming, in that\nagony, to an end; so they really didn\u2019t know what to do with us.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Four \u2014 15 - 15, yes, yes.\n148January 27, 2015",
        "A: So, working on that ramp, we were stealing food sometimes. I\u2019Il never forget\nwhen I ate the pound of butter because I \u2014 I took the piece, you know, brick of\nbutter like this, and the German guard, he noticed that, you know, so he followed\nme, and he was waiting, and I went to satisfy my physical necessities, and I \u2014 to\ncover it up, I ate almost a pound of butter.",
        "A: Took a\u2014 I remember one Ukrainian there, he stole some tobacco leaves. And we\nwere checked on the end of the day, on \u2014 on our end of the day check-up, as we\nwere leaving for the camp again, th-the poor Ukrainian, or Russian at that time,\nwhatever was \u2014 he had a cap, and from the cap there\u2019s some parts of the leaves\nsticking out. And the Gestapo ask him now, did \u2014 what did you steal this time,\nIvan? He says, nothing, nothing. And then he lifted up his \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 cap, and the leaves started flying down, and that was the end of the guy\nbecause they took him right away to the side. There was a bunker, there was a\nbunker in the middle of the station that looked like a innocent building like, but the\nwalls were about a yard thick. During the unexpected alerts, when the big boys were\n149January 27, 2015\ncoming over, and they were coming over by numbers, Americans were flying these\nfortresses, you know, that you would pray more and more, please.",
        "A: They were the white streaks of their frozen exhaust.",
        "A: And this was a massive attack, you know, because that was the method that they\nwere bombing was the carpet method.",
        "A: They selected the certain [indecipherable] target [indecipherable] leveled off.\nGermans \u2014",
        "A: They used to save us by putting us at the very top. The German civilian families\nwere at the very safest bottom portion. The transit military, Germans that were in\ntransit, you know, going from place to place during the alert, they used to go in\nthere. And we were at the very top. So some of the prisoners of war that signed the\nagreement that they would like to work for the \u2014 you know, as civilians, they were\nthere. So they put us in the very top. We used to sing songs, and all the things that\nthe Germans were getting so aggravated, you know, because we were happy when\nthe bombing was going on. Praying more and more. That was one scene. Another\n150January 27, 2015\nscene was that th \u2014 there were transports of cattle. They pulled the cattle trains\nalong the ramps, and they sounded the alert. Sometimes alert lasted for three, four,\nor five days.",
        "A: So they pulled the trains away, during the alert, they pulled the trains away so\nthey would protect the material, whatever it was there. But when the bombed the\ntrain, they opened up these cattle cars. You know, there were so many cows out in\nthe field, running away.",
        "A: That we started cutting the meat from these cows, and taking it to the barracks,\nand we smeared the smell of the meat all over the place, so when the German\nguards came over with the dogs, the dogs were going crazy, because we were hiding\nthe meat in the attics of the barracks. Then we had the meat for a couple days,\ncooking and eating and so on. You know, this \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. They were going crazy. Another scene I remember; we were in the movie\nbarrack, movie barrack, they were showing us their victorious times. Suddenly,\nexplosion took place, a big explosion. These covers that were closing the windows,\nyou know, were blown out. We saw flames all over the place. We run out of the\nJanuary 27, 2015\nbarracks, and we saw a plane that was shot down, and landed right between the two\nrows of barracks.",
        "A: Yeah, the Germans said, oh finally, we shot one of the American planes, you\nknow. But we were forced to clean the remains next day, and the Germans told us to\nbring all these human parts, shoes, whatever. Parts that were showing, and I \u2014 I\nfound the German belt with the [indecipherable] you know. And \u2014 and the human\nleg and the \u2014 in the air force boots, you know, they were special boots, heavy, fur-\nlined, you know. And they finally recognized that this was a German plane.

This was very, very, let\u2019s say sensitive [indecipherable]. The\nGermans used to use a special fog in order to envelop and cover it up. So we were\ngetting the clouds of the fog sometimes into that camp, so we couldn\u2019t breathe.",

        "A: South of Denmark, maybe a little bit west.",
        "A: No, this is \u2014 this is a de-delicate matter, because the allies were trying to\nconvince us to return back \u2014 to \u2014 to remove us from their backs, because there was\none and a half million refugees, slave laborers in Germany, and the countries of\ntheir origin were already under Russian occupation. So we had no place to go. So\nthe only thing was saving, let\u2019s say Polish necks, were that we had the units that\nwere under British command, that were part of the allied army. The General\n159January 27, 2015\nMarchuk(ph), and there was the paratroopers division, the Sosabowskis that were\noccupying certain parts of the British zone, was under Polish hands.\nWilhelmshaven was actually this was base of German \u2014 Donitz submarines,\nWilhelmshaven.",

Many Ukrainians were hiding\namong the Polish DP camps. Many Russians were trying to falsify their papers to \u2014\nnot to be forced to return back. There was an agreement between, I think, Roosevelt\nand Stalin to return all the Russians prisoners of war back to their homeland.",

Should I\nsign a two year contract and go down yonder, and chase the rabbits for the\ngovernment for two years, or should I go to U.S.A.?
