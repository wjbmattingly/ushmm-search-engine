        "Are you ready? We're going. Okay, let's start talking about what changes happened in everyday\nlife when Hitler invaded.",
        "Well, right away after we were invaded, we had a call from a well known uh Jewish\nSocialist/(Communist friend of my grandparents to ask for shelter. This was the day after the army,\nNazis, marched in, and uh, we said they could come, and they lived in the country in Lavin, and we\nhad visitors sometimes, we were not close, but his cousin, for instance, had been in our house, so\nwe had had contact with them on and off, and we told my grandmother that uh we were, our house\nwas full at that po-moment because we rented a room, that uh, would she take them, and she said\nimmediately, \"Yes.\" So, one thing is if they come for him, being followed for instance, you got\nparanoid right away too. Um, well, then you tell them that you don't know, that you're just renting\na room to these people, and uh, they're fleeing from the war, and she said, \"But, he's a communist\nwith a picture in the paper, you know, and I read the paper.\" \"Well, can't you say that you can't\nread the paper anymore?\" \"No.\" She says, \"And I've lined all my closets with the paper!\" So well,\nmy mother and I said, \"Okay, we'll come over and rip out the paper and throw them out.\" So, but\nuh, in the kitchen cabinets it was glued on, so we started ripping them shred by shred, and we're\nsitting there in the kitchen with all these pots and pans on our knees, and ripping these little sheets,\nand I thought, \"You know, this is crazy.\" The craziness started right the first day. When you say,\n\"How did our lives change? It changed overnight. I remember waking up from the sound of\nairplanes, and the telephone rang at 5:30, 6:00 in the morning, and my aunt said, \"Don't be upset,\nbut the war has started.\" And that's how it changed, and we had this call right after that because\nthey were, no, the war started last fa, five days--Rotterdam was bombed, and 5 days later we\nsurrendered, and the refu--suicides began. We had many Jewish friends, and many suicided and\nuh, many started going hiding because they thought that was necessary. Then, Seisencort, who was\na traitor of Germany, the head of the uh, Austrian Nazi, who had uh, was the head of the Nazi\ngovernment from 38 became the head of our government so we had a civilian Gestapo government\nreally, rather than, uh, Denmark had a military government, uh Belgium had a military government,\nFrance did, and the military, although they cooperated with Hitler, they weren't as antisemitic and\nas rabid. They didn't make passports, what, were as difficult to copy. Ours were the most difficult\nto copy. I don't know the ones in East Germany, in, in Eastern Europe, but it was easy if you",
        "brought people to the Belgian border, like this man was talking about, uh, to get a Belgian passport\nwas easy, was easy to falsify. Anyway, I, I used to start stealing passports right from the\nbeginning.",
        "Let's back up to how life changed, and tell me about things that changed in the street, for example.\nWell, after that first panic wave, uh, things calmed down somewhat because the Germans in\nSeisencort were holding speeches about how they would wipe out your past, they weren't interested\nin politics, or changing our politics or arresting anyone, they would leave us alone as long as we\ndidn't hinder their war effort. They were just interested in winning the war, and if we didn't\nsabotage their effort, they would leave us alone. Now we were too glad only to believe that.\nSounded sensible that they would do that, but uh, we did not really uh at that moment take\ncognizance of the uh fact that Mein Kampf and Hitler, and many of his friends were obsessed with\nwhat they thought was the fifth column of the Jews inside. And that became more and more a\npriority, and of course, the Gestapo preferred arresting Jews and getting rid of them, and it was and\nundangerous job for them rather than going to the front. So they had a selfish interest in cleaning\nup the, the Jewish inside the country rather than the war effort. So their, their tension shifted. So,\nthen gradually everybody had to have passports, every, they Jews had to have a J init. And they\nsegregated the Jews in the ghetto, former Jewish neighborhood, and, and the pogroms started, or\nraids, where they would just empty out all of the Jews. My mother was caught in one of those\nraids, and they let her out because she had no J on her passport, and many people asked to tape on\nthe back of her bag or ,or on the back of her bike or in the bag of her bike, a Jewish baby, take out\nof the ghetto. And of course, they checked everything before she went out, she couldn't do that.\nBut she came home broken. (Sighs). Well, my sorority that I was a member of was very active in\nthe underground, and in placing Jews, and especially Jewish children. And I would pick them out\nof the ghetto because if they weren't raiding it, the ghetto was open, and you could ride in and out,\nyou know, with a child. They were not checking. They could, but they didn't always. And so, uh,\nI took people out of there, brought them home, and then there were homes for them in the country,\nespecially for children, it would be much better to place them in the farms, and uh, they would stay\nwith us for a couple of days to a couple of weeks. And it is true we uh, finally found people\nstaying with us one, because there weren't that many raids anymore after D-Day, that was June,\nforty....forty-four, June 6, 44. After that, there were no more trains to camps in Poland, and people\nhad less raids. All the Gestapo\u2019s, the --------- against the green police, were all called up for active\nduty, and there were less raids, and then, we had more stable population in our house, 4 or 5\npeople, who stayed until the end of the war. And, uh, it's true, people that were not compatible\nwith us, we'd try to find harder a place for them outside. Because it's hard to live with strangers in",
        "your house, and uh, if they have a very different background, lifestyle, uh, well, for instance, I\nbrought a young couple to uh, the hothouses in Asmir, where they lived fairly independently. They\nwere brought food or they could cook some themselves. In other words, there's 2 of them in one\nhothouse, a big place and it was warm, unlike, most of our houses were unheated. So, uh, after a\ncouple of fights with them, I found a place for them in a hothouse. They were better off, and we\nwere better off.\nGo back and talk a little more about how old you were at this time, and what your sorority did.\nYeah. When the war started, uh, those 5 days, uh, I was a medical student, and I was 19, almost 20.\nAnd uh, I was part also of an underground group. One of the leaders of the underground, Johann\nBrower, enlisted me. He was hiding in our house for a while, and he enlisted me, and I was part of\na group of 10, mostly boys, students, and we read Mein Kampf and it was good, we, we knew what\nHitler was about; we weren't as deluded as some. You know, we didn't know about the gas\nchambers, we didn't know about the Final Solution until after the war, but, I did not have much\nillusions when these people were called up, so-called for work in Germany, that they would come\nback. I did not, I thought maybe they worked them to death, but how come you never hear, you\ndon't get a postcard, you don't get a message, nobody escapes.\nWe have to reload.\nBeep.\nOkay, let's uh, let's talk again about your sorority and how the education went underground and\nhow many people were involved.\nYeah, uh, my medical school closed when we had to sign a loyalty oath, and uh, nobody wanted to\nsign a loyalty oath. The whole university closed, and except maybe, I remember out of my class of\n200, there was one boy who was a Nazi, and, but there were no classes. But he, he signed the\nloyalty oath. Zeller was his name, I remember him. And he, we all thought he was an idiot to\nbegin with, you know, one of these people who in grammar school have cooties, you know, the,\nsomebody doesn\u2019t fit in anywhere, and those people became Nazis, about 3% of the population.\nAnd uh, it is true that they were very interested in power. They thought the Germans would win,\nand they would uh, harass us, you know, or betray us if they could. But most of the time, uh, I\nwould say, you trusted people and you could trust people, because if you were in a streetcar, and a\nGerman soldier got in, in, they would say in Ger- in Dutch slang something derogatory, everybody",
        "sort of wink or snicker, you know, like we're all, this is our enemy, and we were taught in the\nunderground how to behave when you were arrested. And uh, always ask for an interpreter even\nthough you speak German so that you can hear the question twice, and that you can correct the\nanswer, and try to get in control of the interview by different ruses, you know, distractions and so\nforth, and I remember once, I was so afraid they had come to arrest me, and they, two guys took me\nby the wri-wrist, threw me against the wall, and I was trembling, and I didn't want to show them.\nDon't show them that you're scared, you know, then they'll become more sadistic. So, I was uh\ntrembling, and to hide it, I was crossing my legs and uncrossing my legs, and I had shorts on, and\nthis uh, Gestapo ------------------------- said to me, \"You're not impressing me with your legs.\" So\nthen I stopped trembling automatically because I felt I had gained a little human control. He was,\nafter all, just a person, a man, rather than, this devil. Anyway, and then, I...they sat me in a chair,\nand they were in the meantime rolling up the rugs, looking in all the closets, going in the attic, the\nbasement, searching for contraband. And fortunately had, we had been warned, so there was no,\nnobody in our house hiding, no Jews, and we had no underground papers under the rugs, so I felt a\nlittle bit safer because of that. And then I asked if I could uh, speak to my grandmother. I said, you\nknow, she's 80 years old, and she's expecting me for dinner. They always come around 6 in the\nmorning or 6 at night. And he said, you can just say that you're not coming for dinner and nothing\nmore. And they went with me to the telephone, you know, watching me. So I said, I'm not coming\nfor dinner. And fortunately Tibs, uh, my best friend, Jewish girl, was hiding in her house because\nour house was empty. And she answered the phone, fortunately, because my grandma was a little\ndeaf, and I knew I couldn't say too much, so Tibs said, \"You weren't supposed to come here for\ndinner. Are you having visitors?\" I said, \"Yes,\" and I said, \"Hang up,\" and she said, \"I'll call your\nmother and warn her not to come home.\" And then he punched the button to hang up. And uh, that\nmade me feel so good, the fact that she knew that they were there somehow that connection makes\nyou feel very good, and that my mother wouldn't walk in the trap unwarned, and uh, she knew\nwhere my mother was. We were kind of on, on warning about that particular visit because they\nwere looking for a particular man, who was indeed hiding in house ------------, and we knew they\nwere looking for him.",
        "Let's go back to the sorority and the university, and tell me sort of in a broad way how the students\nall got involved and what general kinds of things they got involved in.",
        "Well, for instance, I would get a call, \"Could you pick up such and such a person at such and such\nan address, and keep that person until we have his uh, further, a further address for him. This was\nmostly in code we say, said all those things, so I would go there and pick, let's say, a little 3 year\nold, and then, um, they would call me and say, \"Would you do an errand for us to um, Inghausen?\"",
        "or uh \"Horne?\" and I knew what that was, some contraband had to be transported. Like a radio\nsender for uh, contact with England. Of course, that was very highly punishable. And so, and they\ndid have these little check, you know these little uh, how do you call, little wooden houses for\nsoldiers on the roads everywhere, checkpoints, and they would uh, check you, and if you had food,\nthey would uh, take it and keep it. Sometimes take your bike, they could do that. They would take\nyour bike, and you had to walk home, wherever you were. And if you had a radio sender, well, that\nwas, you would be shot. So I would bring things like that. We also hid weapons that were stolen\nfrom Virma. I'd get a call if we would keep stuff for a couple of days, usually a bit longer that a\ncouple of days. And then uh, if you were one minute after 8 on the street, they would arrest you\nand you'd go to jail, and they'd always pick people from the jails to be shot if there was any, if any\nsoldier was killed or any railroad blown up, whatever subversive activity, they would take 100\npeople and shoot them, innocent people, people in the camp or in the jail, innocent in the sense that\nthey were one minute late after the curfew. So, but if you had to bring people to the country, it was\nvery hard to get back before the curfew was over. So, I sometimes had to travel uh, at night. And\nthen when it was 8 o clock, uh you just slipped from doorway to doorway in the dark to find shelter\nyourself, to get back in time. Uh, fortunately, we had a network, and uh, sometimes it was far away\nin the country, uh, we would go two, and we would have two networks and addresses. And if I had\nto bring, let's say, a radio sender to another part of the country, uh, a boy would drive in front of me\nwith no sender, and I would ride behind him, let's say 100 yards behind him with the contraband,\nand if, I were held up, he could escape, and I wouldn't know the address we were going to. And\nthen I brought people to the Belgian border, and you had to get Belgian passports, but we got them\nthere. But we would fix them there with a, they had to bring their passport pictures and put them\non right then and there, and then they would go from there, from the village on the border. The\nGeeters had brought, and Lean Geeter was 7 months pregnant, and she, her husband, her brother,\nand her mother in law walked all the way to Spain--there was an underground railroad, and unlike\nwhat Harry was saying, a lot of people were caught, yes, but there was a reliable group that did this.\nYou mentioned in you other interview...\nWe have to change rolls.\nWe need to be more general...\nBeep.\nWhy don't we start with the, why don't you describe the hiding place in your house and how that",
        "got killed, and what it was like.",
        "Well, we were hiding people, as I told you, from the very first day of the war really. Was the\ninvasion, but uh, we didn't get a hiding place made until a carpenter, we hadn't really thought of\nthat, although we had rehearsed that if there would be a raid on our house, and every house was\nraided, house block by block, house by house, they went to every house in the country, I'm sure,\nand especially in Amsterdam because there were so many Jews in Amsterdam. And, uh, so we had\nhiding, we had escape routes made, out of the window of the top floor, and then over the roofs 1n to\nuh, an attic of the school. Uh, I explained to you that our house, being a house, first of a mayor of\nAmsterdam, then it became a school, and with a house for the principal, and that house in 1915\nbelonging to the city of Amsterdam, was rented by my grandfather, and I was born there in 1920.\nAnd we lived in that, my mother, and later my grandmother, a maid, and I. And we rented rooms,\none or two usually, and um, because my, my father had left, and he was not supporting us, and so\num, when we started taking in people, we realized that they had to get away if the Gestapo came.\nSo we had a first floor, in other words, electrical button could open the door, and so you could look\nthrough a wall window, through the door downstairs on the 1st floor downstairs on the Ist floor and\nsee who's coming in. And we had a alarm that we rang for the 3rd floor, so the people on the 3rd\nfloor could cripe, creep out the window, in the gutter, and get lost, and go to the attic on the back\nside of the house on the school, it was connected with us. There were two, a front part of the\nschool, they had this wing, we had this wing, and then, in the back was the school behind the\ncourtyard, and there were, uh, there was an attic that we had access too, so they could, you could go\nin hiding there. And that we had as an escape route, and we rehearsed that. To get out of the\nwindow and out in there quietly, very fast. So, when uh, uh time came that a man called and he\nsaid \"I'm a carpenter from the underground,\" and he had tools with him, and he looked so honest\nand reliable, we trusted him. My mom said, \"Do you know this man?\" I said, \"No, but let him\nmake a hiding place.\" And he made such a good hiding place that when I go back to that house, It's\nvery hard to find. It doesn't hold too many people though, 2 or 3 crammed sitting together, but we,\nwe did have those safeties, unlike Anne Frank who didn't have, have a hiding place to go to in case\nfor raid, and I think they were, well, either was not possible there or they were naive or fatalistic\nthat once the Gestapo found them they would, that would be the end. I felt, felt that we maybe\nbecause it was part of an underground network, the, it's called the Lomlok Organization I found out\nlater. The LO uh, trained us in how to do these things, not only to how to be interrogated, but what\npapers to get, what was safe, and uh, how you needed a hiding place in your house, or an escape\nroute, to get out. You couldn't just go on the roof because they would uh, put barbed wire on each\nside on each side of the road, and machine guns, and they would have, even have somebody on, on\nthe rooftops watching. It's impossible to believe the effort and time and manpower these Gestapo\u2019s",
        "employed to, to catch Jews. And when my mother and I were arrested, and we said that this Hans\nYoung they were looking for had indeed rented a house, a room in a house, but he was a\nbusinessman who had spent time in Amsterdam, and uh, yes, he had met his bookkeeper, we\nbelieve, there, uh, and his bookkeeper was arrested that's how we knew that his bookkeeper might\nbe talking, so we had a story ready that Hans Young to us was not Jewish, he had good papers, he\nhad blond hair, blue eyes, how could he be a Jew? Well, we'll show you pictures of eye grounds.\nAnd they showed us pictures of eye corners, I mean, like, 8 in a row, 16 pictures, and that's how\nyou could recognize that somebody was a Jew, never mind the color of the hair. And my mother\nand I would say, \"Really!?\" You know, later, when we were alone, we said, \"Can you believe\nsuch craziness?\" They were crazy. Because, it couldn't be true, right? And besides, if it were, ----\n----------------- planning to do that anyway, but of course, we had to uh, pretend, and they believed\nus. They always believed you if you went along with their delusions because they were possessed\nby this delusional belief descending from on high, Hitler, and the anti-Semites there that ruled the\ncountry, and they believed it, and they thought that we should believe it to, that it was natural for us\nto believe that, that Jews were really that evil, and that you had to wipe them out.\nCan you tell me the story of incident on the street with the boy who ran when he was out after 6.\nYeah, my mother was a little careless, and we would tell her, you know, \"you really have to come\nhome in time,\" and one time they had uh, people with machine guns on the corner of our street, uh,\nand arrested a couple of people, and they waved to my mother to get off her bike and come in the\nside street. And uh, she waved back at them. I mean she, she was uh naive, and uh, no, no, over\nthere, and they pointed a gun at her, and she went and so, well, people already arrested because it\nwas 2 minutes after 8, and one boy bolted from this roll, and ran away over a bridge and back, and\nuh, he was shot, and a doctor who lived on the corner behind us, ran out of his house to tend to this\nboy. Well, my mother never did that again. But she was let go because she had a letter from a\ndoctor that she had some phlebitis, and sometimes needed emergency help, which was true. She\nalso had a heart condition. And so she had that letter with her. We did take precautions like that,\nSO...\nHow organized was the sorority?\nExcuse me?\nHow organized was the sorority?",
        "I do not know. I was, of course, a new member, I was 19, and young student, and some of the\nmembers were uh, graduate students, medical students, you stay in school for 7 yrs, so some were\nolder, and I have a feeling that one of my uh, older sorority members, uh organized this, but, we did\nnot talk about those things, but when she called me, I could sort of tell that she was organizing this,\nand would I do this, or that. And then I would call her, in turn, and say, \"I'm having a family of 5\npeople here. They're orthodox Jews, uh father mother and 3 children. Can you find shelter for\nthem, they would like to stay together if at all possible.\" And then she would say, \"Yeah, I'll do my\nbest,\" and, uh, then they would be picked up by someone.\nAnd what about the passports--we have to reload.\nBeep.\nBeep.\nWhy don't you start with that story\n4-second sticks???\nFamily, and some of the things that happened, just give a little general story.\nWell, my best friend in high school was Tetsa Fenamo, who uh, survived the war being hidden in\nour house, my grandmother's apt., and different places. Her sisters and her brother in law stayed\nwith us the longest time, almost a year at the end of the war, but right before the end of the war,\nTetsa Fenamo and her sister, Jan, her husband Leon Nortem, and Bram Pays, rented a, an apt in\nJanet's name. She had good fal-false papers and she rent an apt, and the four of them then, two\nboys, uh, were hidden, but the girls, not looking very Jewish, moved about freely. And they were\nof course very happy to have an independent life. And they were betrayed or they were arrested in\na raid, and um, I got the girls and Bram Pays out by going to the jail and talking to the --------. This\nwas now, at the very end of the war, the spring of 1945, and they knew they had lost the war, the\nGermans, and they, the jails were overfilled, and Bram Pays was uh, invited by Neils Bohr to study\nin, in Denmark, and he had uh, I had a letter, and uh, just as he said, they did have some respect for\nscientists, maybe, and they let the girls go, they couldn't prove they were not Jewish because by\nnow the Cadaster, where everybody was registered, so that you could check if somebody had a\nfalse passport, you could check if the counterpart was in the city hall. Cadaster. Well, that was\nburned by this Johann Brower and his friends, who had hired me, you know, for the underground,",
        "and he blew that up with a bomb, and of course, he was arrested and killed. And uh, at least the\nadvantage was they could not check anymore who had good papers and who had false papers by\nchecking them with the city hall, registration.",
        "(Sandy says something, can't hear)",
        "So Bram Pays, how did I know him? He was a very close friend of uh, the Fenameroans, and I was\n2 when we met there, and we actually were engaged to be married, or, let's say we were very close,\nand, uh, he hid in our house, but he hid also in my best friend's house, the Cohor's and in other\npeople's houses, and uh, I still have contact with him, and he's writing his now his own bio-\nautobiography, and he sends me chapter by chapter to check for veracity and what I remember, and\ndo I remember stories. So, should I tell you one of the stories about Bram Pays? He was very uh,\nup person, and uh, Leon Nordheim was shot in, I told you they were arrested, the 4 of them, I got\nthe girls out, but basically you had good papers, and I got Bram Pays out because he had this paper\nby Neils Bohr where he was invited, and Leo Nordheim had on his pocket, in his pocket when he\nwas arrested, a, a manuscript of a paper that he had written for the underground papers about what\nto do with the Jewish children after the war if their parents hadn't survived. And a copy of that\npaper he was carrying in his own handwriting on him, that had just happened. And so that was one\nreason why he was shot. The other was, I think, because he was so scared. Bram was not scared,\nand it made a difference, I think. Leon Nordheim also looked very Jewish, and that always got\nthem. Well, let me tell you another story about Bram. For a long time, he was hiding in our house,\nand the doorbell rang very early, and a man called and he said Ziedepolizzi, that is the moral police,\nuh, police for uh, moral uh, well, the issue was he asked who lived 1n the back of the house, and my\nmother said, \"My daughter has a room in the back.\" \"Well, can I see that? Can I talk to her?\" And\nwhat had happened was that I had washed myself, I had a basin in front of a window, and knowing\nthat school wasn't open in the morning, I didn't think anybody would see me. Besides their\nwindows were lower, so you couldn't look up. But, actually, a block and a half away, 2 streets\nfurther, was a seminary, a religious seminary, a Roman Catholic church, and they had trained, um,\nspyglasses on our house, and they had watched me undress in my room. Big deal. And so this man\ncame, and we were very mad at this...uh, well, say, Prior of, the head of the Seminary that he hadn't\ncalled and called the police, I mean in those times you didn't call the police. You didn't know who\nwas good and who was not good. Anyway, this man came upstairs, and my mother had rang the\nalarm bell, so Bram, she thought, would be in the hiding place in the attic. But Bram was very bold\nand curious, being a scientist, and he was, instead of going up in the attic, he was listening behind\nthe door. He didn't realize there was a, uh, milklice window in that door. And you could see his\nJewish profile through the window, and the man said, \"Who 1s there? Who lives in that room?\"",
        "And my mother said, \"Well, here's my daughter's room. She opened the door to my room, and so\nhe told the story what we, I, was accused of, and I said, \"Oh, thank God, is that all?\" which was\nstupid of me, you know, because, but I had a feeling that this was a decent citizen. He had, wore a\nbowler hat, boulder? bowler hat. The Gestapo wouldn't wear bowler hats, you know those English\nhats with a rim and it's round, round ball. So, Bram thought it was all funny. One time he came,\nand uh, we had, we would listen to the radio, that was also punishable by death penalty--if you had\na radio and listened to the BBC. But, we were one of the few people who felt we could have them,\nwe should have it and listen to it, and then, as many as 30, 35 people would come to listen to the\nradio. Well a gathering of more than 8 or 10 was also punishable by death. But, that was a lot of\nfun for us, to have all our friends come and visit, and for them of course, being hidden, and, kind of\nlocked up in isolation, you know, this is one family, was a great thing for them, and they would all\nmeet each other and chat and then, uh, the Dutch National Anthem would sound, you know, we'd\nall be quiet, the Queen was going to speak, the Dutch Queen was in hiding, in exile in London, and\nuh, and she would talk, and then the National Anthem would sound again, and my mother sat up\nand she said, \"Quiet! The National Anthem! The Queen is going to speak!\" Well, she had just\nfinished when all of the sudden, tired from all this, she just fell asleep even though there were 30\npeople in the room, so we just started laughing uncontrollably. Here was this big event and she had\nslept through the whole thing. She was reprimanding us for being quiet...Another incident that was\nfunny and sort of tells you how we lived was that uh, we were just sitting down to dinner with the\npeople we were hiding, this was Leon and Janet and Hans Doin and Vishavasonte were the Jews,\nand there was my grandmother, our maid, my mother and myself, and we were sitting down and all\nwe had was rotten potatoes, and my mother said, \"Something smells awful.\" \"It's the potatoes.\"\n\"No, no,\" she said, \"I know what they smell like, it smells like the cat did something. Let's go\nlook.\" So we all sniffed around, and I said, \"I know what it is,\" and there was a shelf behind my\nmother's head, and there was a loaf of bread behind it, and the bread by now was so terrible, it\nsmelled like cat doo, cat doo, and that was what the smell...Anyway, so, that's how we lived. This\nbread was mud colored, and in the middle was something, it wasn't flour, I don't know what, what\nwas it, we ate mostly sugar beads ground up, which was mostly cellulose, and my mother was\nhospitalized because it formed a knot in her intestine, and she had acute ----, and she had to be\nhospitalized, and nothing would pass anymore through that knot of cellulose. And I was so proud\nthat I had a new recipe--you know, you grind up this, this sugar bead, and it looked just like rice,\nand then you put, we still had curry powder, and you put curry on it, and it looks like curried rice.\nWell, my poor mother was hospitalize for that.",
        "Okay, we have to reload.",
        "Beep.\nWhat did you and your family and other rescuers risk? What were the risks?\nLife and death. There were big placards hung up all through the city that helping Jews uh, was\npunishable by death. And, uh, this was no idle boast--my uncle, who did not have Jews found in\nhis house, was in a camp, concentration camp for a year...\nLet's stop...Go ahead and come down.\nTake 6 is up.\nBeep.\nI'm just going to start again.\nWhat were the things that you and other rescuers risked?\nIf you were caught, you were going to be punished by death. And whenever they arrested us, just\nfor, you know, being accused, helping Jews, uh, they would say, \"You're under arrest, you're going\nto jail.\" And my uncle who was accused of helping Jews was a year in a concentration camp.\nNow, this was not a gas chamber camp, this was a Dutch camp, but, people died like flies there\nfrom undernourishment, illness, and uh, he escaped sort of miraculously. They emptied out the\ncamp, and he was left behind with a couple of other people hiding in the latrines. And he walked to\nthe next village, 1t was in Fuft, and uh, he came home emaciated a year later. They helped him in\nFuft, they called his family, they gave him money for the train, and it wasn't, this was not toward\nthe very end of the war, and his wife, my aunt, was allowed to send him a package once a month, of\nmaybe 3 Ibs of food and uh, she would come to our house to make a package, it was so painful for\nher to do that, and uh, I have asked his three daughters to record what he did and what uh, what\nthey actually found uh, what they found, they came to my grandmother's and they were uh, she was\nunder arrest, she was then in her 80s and they said, um, she said, \"Why have you arrested my son?\nYou have absolutely no proof that he did anything wrong.\" \"Yes he helped Jews. He uh, we found\nsilver in his house with initials that were not his own.\" So my grandma took a drawer from her uh,\nchest, and she emptied it out all over the table, and there was all this silver, forks and knives, and\nshe said, \"Look at that. In our family, we buy at auctions. You see there are initials on there that\nare not ours, so, I think that's a lot of nonsense.\" The man was sort of quiet, and he had sent the",
        "others away, and it was just one Gestapo with her, which was unusual, but they figured, you know,\nshe was so old maybe, she wouldn't do anything bad. And then, uh, let's see, he was questioning\nher, \"Had she helped Jews?\" She denied it of course, and she grabbed his arm, and she looked in\nhis face, and she said, \"I saw you at my neighbor's house, the Mendelssohn\u2019s, and you took a rug at\nnight, you were alone with another guy, and you're not allowed to do that. That's looting, and that's\nforbidden.\" And the man got very nervous, and he put all his papers together in his, in his\nbriefcase, and he said he had to go now, and he never came back, and we, we said, \"Grandma, you\nknow, you, he could have shot you, and nobody would have, have known the difference, right.\"\nAnd they did that, as I just told you before. Well, she scared him away. She scared him, and when\nshe was retelling the story, she got all angry again, you know, and he was afraid of her.\nOver all those years of rescuing, about how many people went in and out of your house?\nHundreds, close to a hundred. My mother and I made a list after the war. I lost the list with all the\nnames of the people.\nTell me how...\nWell, as I said, people would call us and ask us if they could stay with us, and then if uh, we had to\nget the house empty again, we would uh place them elsewhere. And so, a new bunch would come.\nAnd uh, at the end of the war, uh, one of the girls that uh, hid in our house for a long time, Visha\nEnsante, she's a survivor, uh, was caught, was in jail, and one of the Gestapo\u2019s uh, not the head, but\nright under him, prot\u00e9g\u00e9, uh, made her his lover, he set her up in an apt, he dyed her hair blonde,\nand he sent her out to make contact with the underground, her, her group, her boyfriend and his\nbrother, whom I also knew quite well, made bombs and they were caught, and they were shot, and\nVisha was in this apt and she went to the underground, brought messages back, but fake, and of\ncourse, she could not keep that up too long. She was 17 and not well. She had a slipped disc\nprobably, uh, now I know she did. I got her later in a hospital under a false name, but anyway, she\nescaped from this apt, and we hid her, and of course, it was doubly dangerous, they were looking\nfor her. And, uh, so...\nWere you afraid all the time?\nYes, we were terrified all the time, but, you know, you can suppress that fear if you know that it's\nimportant, what you're doing. I also distributed underground newspapers. I thought it was\nimportant enough to risk your life for. It was very important to have communication and know",
        "what's going on in the world, rather than the censored press, which was worthless. So...\nDo you think it was a combination of fear and excitement, adventure...?\nYeah, it was also an adventure, that's true. I wasn't, I would say, the most adventurous because that\ngroup of 10 that I was assigned to by Johann Brower, uh, he was born conspirator, he had fought in\nthe Spanish Civil War, and, um, I was afraid of him, his recklessness, and I was afraid of the 10\nguys I was connected with. They were the kind that made bombs and did dangerous thing, and I'm\na pacifist, I was against violence. I didn't rescue German soldiers who fell in the canal, but I didn't\nkill anybody, I didn't want to kill anybody, and, uh, so I left that group, and none of those survived,\nthose boys, not sur, did not survive. One of my best friends had a radio sender, he never survived.\nMany, there was many friends that I was in high school with, apart from the Jewish friends that I\nlost, uh, the underground, I lost many...and uh, Johann Brower was killed, um, I wasn't such a\ndaredevil that I carried a gun or did, made bombs, I was um 100% into making passports,\nunderground papers, and hiding people, mostly hiding people, and taking care, and I would visit\nthem once a month. I would be the only contact for them with their family or with, well, their old\nworld. It was very important. One young boy of 14 that I visited regularly was a very\nheartbreaking, quiet, depressed kid, and, uh, the people that he was with were also rather quiet and\nun, unemotional people, and they would complain to me that he had such smelly feet, which he did.\nAs soon as you came in the apt, you smelled it, it was really terrible. And I couldn't understand\nthat they didn't discuss that with each other. So, I said \"You must talk about that,\" and we did, and\nI said, \"You have to wash your feet all the time, and uh, bring a powder, and you have to powder\nyour feet, and you have to walk on your socks, and you have to walk on your socks, and they have\nto be washed, and you don't...smell it, but it's really terrible for people to live with that.\" So, it\nseems like a crazy problem but smell 1s very important, and you can't live with a bad smell in your\nhouse. And so they almost hated him and I said, \"I cannot send this young kid, he's your child, you\nhave to tell him this.\" So, that problem got fortunately solved.\nUh, tell me a little more, we have to reload.\nCorrection, sync take 7 is up.\nBeep.\nOkay, so tell me about the Gestapo, and the times that they came to your house. How many, and in\ngeneral what you knew about it or didn't know about it. How you felt about it.",
        "Most of the time I would think we knew that they were coming. Like when Hans Dion's\nbookkeeper was arrested. We could suspect that he would talk, and he did, that he had met his boss\nin our house, and so we were prepared then that they were coming. At the same time, you couldn't\nhide yourself elsewhere, then you wouldn't be useful anymore, and there was a good chance that if\nwe had a good story together, my mother and I, that we would, as before, talk our way out of it.\nWe felt we were so smart, we had done it before. And, uh, so when I was arrested there and they\nthrew me against the wall, and uh, they left, but they, they would come in, the way you knew that it\nwas the Gestapo is they would ring the bell, and two men would come at once, obviously armed,\nyou know, like you see in the movies, and even some with open arms, but they came in uh, civilian\nclothes, but 2 at once throwing open the door, well, that's most unusual, so you knew it was the\nGestapo, they rang the bell to warn, and usually when we were by the in, from the Gestapo\nheadquarters, these men wouldn't say \"This is Gestapo headquarters,\" but he said, \"You're going to\nhave visitors,\" and then hang up, so I dedu-duced from that he knew what he was talking about\nbecause a few days later they would come. And so, we heeded these warnings, and we would call\neveryone, get rid of everyone, get rid of all the illegal newspapers, the illegal passports that was on\ntheir way in transit to different places, and we would call every Jewish person, or every\nunderground person, uh, \"Don't come, we're going to have visitors.\" Well, Hanna Nordbauer, a\nJewish girl, who made passports, always travelled with about 30 to 50 passports in her pocketbood,\ncame anyway, and, we said, \"Hanna, we called you.\" Well, right on her heels, they came. There\nwas no way for her to get out. So I said to my mother, \"I'll put her in the hiding place, and you\nkeep them busy downstairs here. So, I went upstairs, we put her in the hiding place, and thank God\nthey didn't stay too long, and they didn't search the whole house. They just sniffed around. They\nusually came with 6 people, and they sniffed around everywhere, fanned out, rolled up rugs,\nlooked, but this time they didn't go to the attic. So after they left, I went to the attic to get Hanna out\nof there, and in front of the hiding place was a little bunch of freesias wrapped in a fresh paper, and\nif they had seen that, I bet they would have thought, \"How come there's a bunch of flowers lying in\nthe attic on the floor? There's something going on here.\" So my mother and I were very angry at\nHanna and said, \"If we call you not to come, you really must not come.\" So, this is how it went.\nWere you afraid of the Gestapo?",
        "Was I afraid of them?! I was terrified of them. It was, my mother would tremble from head to toe\nwhen they would come, and I would uh, sort of hold her arm or say, \"Don't show them you're\nscared. Don't show them you're scared.\" There's nothing here in the house. Don't worry. They\ncan't pin anything down on us.\" You know, whenever they weren't paying attention, uh, I'd bolster",
        "her spirits.\nWere you behind most of the rescuing, and she not behind it?\nShe was 100% behind me, but I got most of the people in. Hans Young was one of her people, an\nolder man. But, most of the people that came, came through my network, and my friends, and as I\nsaid, uh, Henry Polok, who called the first day after the invasion was uh relationship of my\ngrandparents, and called her specifically.\nCan you talk about how important rescuing was in general in Poland. How big an effort it was\ngenerally.\nIt must have been a big thing in Amsterdam and all over the country because I know the churches\nwere doing this, and I know uh ordinary uh farmers who'd never seen a Jew were doing this, I\nbrought people to them, and they didn't really care about, they cared about doing the right thing. I\nmean, I could say that most of these people were my friends, or friends of my friends, although we\nhad people that we had never seen before, but, it was very important, and my whole family was\ninvolved in it, and all my friends were involved in it. Two of my cousins were also in jail for a\nlong time for helping.\nWere you afraid of traitors?\nVery afraid.\nWell, tell me about them.\nWell, if you lived next to uh NS--------, is uh, Dutch Nazis. Uh, these people were paid and trained\nto, to watch out for Jews at the neighbor's houses, and um, so if you knew that you lived next door\nto them, or underneath them, uh, they would take a lot of extra courage to do that. My friends,\nTetsa lived for a while in a house in Okmar where a neighbor said to her people, \"We know you\nhave a Jew here in the house,\" and they denied it, but they knew she had either been seen, and that\nthese people were Nazi sympathizers, so then they placed here elsewhere--she came maybe back to\nus for a while or my grandmother's or an aunt of mine who hid people too in Hausen. Now in\nHausen, for instance, a little fishing village on the Zauderzei, uh, they were raided. There was a\nvillage of about 8000 souls, and they were raided by 7000 Gestapo, house to house, so when I'm\ntalking about what they put into it, as effort to find hidden Jews, it was enormous. I don't know any",
        "other country they did that. And uh, I've heard people ask me, \"How come 95% of the Danish Jews\nwere saved and only 20% of the Dutch?\" Well, that was the reason. The Danish Jews could, in\none night, roll over to Sweden, and apparently there wasn't too much patrolling there, because 95%\ncould get to Sweden. But we had Germany on one side, the North Sea on the other. People tried to\nescape, some of my friends tried to escape over the North Sea in a boat, but if your boat wasn't\nseaworthy...besides, they had a lot of patrols on the North Sea, the Germans, uh with big lamps,\nboats with big lamps, and if you weren't caught, these boats weren't seaworthy. Very interesting,\nour maid was from a family that had Rhine Boats that uh, trafficked up and down the Rhine was\ngood for...Europe. And, they were requisitioned by Hitler, and he cut off front of them, and put\ntanks in them, and tried to see if they were seaworthy, and he could invade Germany that way.\nAnd many of those boats were requisitioned, but they were not seaworthy, so they, he couldn't, if\nhe had been able to use them, uh, history might have been different, he might have invaded\nEngland, and the war would have been lost maybe, to Hitler, because the English didn't have many\ntanks at that time.\nWhat about bounties?\nBounties? I heard that you could get 100 Gelders for betraying a Jew, and our maid, who uh, was\ndeep in the black market, was uh, because of her family, transporting and this food to Germany,\nand stealing from it, and selling it, that that saved our lives because many people died from hunger.\n1000 people a day in Amsterdam died the last ---------- winter. Anyway, our maid was arrested.\nShe had, she had threatened to betray us when my mother got mad at her for not doing anything in\nthe house, and they started yelling at each other, she would say, \"I, I'm going to tell them that you\nhave Jews in the house!\" And it was an empty threat because when she was arrested, she did not\nbetray us. One of the times that they came to our house, was arresting our maid for her black\nmarketeering...\nWe have to reload.\nContinuing interview with Tina Strobos.\nBeep.\nUm, why did you do it, and why did the rescuers do it, uh, my mother said to me, \"You know we\ncan get killed, but you know, even if it's the last thing you do, you have to do that because uh, you\ncan't live with that injustice and not do anything, and then live with yourself, and knowing you",
        "didn't do...everything you could. I wouldn't want to live in a world where nobody cares a damn.\nWhat kind of people were the rescuers that you knew of?",
        "Well, I suppose we had a strong sense of justice, and um, a strong sense of that the Nazis shouldn't\nwin, and that we should do everything to make them worth their efforts. And that the worst thing\nthey did was really to the Jews. They were the most victimized, and that, uh they had very few\nchoices, and so we should help them, and we did. And most of the people I know, did help. And\nmost people I know were in the underground, and most of the underground people that I know\nwere involved in this rescue work, I would say. I'm not saying that there was a total absence of\nantisemitism, but it was of a joking benign kind, usually. Nobody, uh, even if let's say they didn't\nhave Jewish friends or uh, there was one club in, in the city that I know didn't take Jews at least\nbefore the war, but they didn't, wouldn't ever think of harming anyone, or doing any harm to\nsomeone. And uh, they were involved in, most of those people were upright citizens, and were\ninvolved in it, and a lot of money was needed for it too. You know, poor farmers, if you place\npeople there, and you could promise them, you know food was very expensive, and you could\nreally not live on sugar beads alone, so you had to have some money to feed these people. And I\nbrought money around too for one of the little girls that, and for this boy I just mentioned, 14 year\nold boy, I brought money every month there, and food cards and stamps, so that they would have\num, at least one loaf of bread you got a week, which deteriorated in quality. Well, let me tell you\nhow we uh were connected with the black through our maid, mostly, and uh, one time my mother,\nand one of the hiders, uh Leon Nordheim, said uh, Churchill's going to talk tonight. And, uh, when\nafter he talked about blood, sweat and tears, and they're going to fight them on the beaches, they\ngot so depressed because it meant the war was still going to be longer than we thought. You know,\nyou lived in this constant hope that the war was miraculously going to be won soon. Um, well\nLeon and my mother plunked down 60 dollars for a bottle of gin, but I didn't know about that, and I\nwould be studying with one of these bottles of gin, you know, those earthenware bottles, and I\nwould fill it with hot water, and try to study in my room, which was fro-freezing cold, and put\nblankets over me, and this wa-hot water bottle, and put on gloves, and my little fur coat, and I'd try\nto study, and then I would come with the bottle, ---- cold, I would come in the living room where\nwe had a 2 lb coffee can, you know, those Maxwell coffee cans, and cut a hole in the bottom, and\nwe had tiny little bit of fuel in that, and on top of that was a kettle, either with hot water of a kettle\nwith sugar beads to extract the sugar from it, and every house smelled of sugar beads, and if I now\ndrive past a field of sugar beads, I still get nauseated because it smells like the war. Anyway, uh, I\nwould come in, and fill my, my hot water bottle with hot water, and then take it back to my room to\nstudy. And so I saw this hot, bottle of balls, I'll show you one like it, and I emptied it out in the",
        "sink, and as I was pouring it, I smelled gin. Ughhhh! And so I stopped midstream, and at that\nmoment Leon came in, one of our hiders, Jewish boy, and he in a glance knew what happened\nbecause he had bought the bottle, and he started laughing like a hyena, he had a funny laugh, and\nwhen he laughed, I started laughing too because I felt terrible, guilty of course, I knew what I'd\ndone, and then everybody said, \"What's the matter? What's going on here?\" And everybody\nstarted laughing, laughing, because they finally bought this bottle after much deliberation, and I\nwas pouring it down the sink, and then my mother came in, and she was furious with me. Stupid,\ndidn't you see the glasses standing there? No, I thought it was my bottle. And uh, so everybody\nlaughed hysterically to kind of help me because my mother was so mad at me, you know, and then\nshe had to laugh too, finally.\nWhat was your closest call in all those years?\nI guess when I went to the apt where uh I knew was raided, and my friends were caught, my closest\nfriends, and I wanted to find out who the -------------- was, and what their status was, and whether\nthe girls were discovered to be Jews or not, so that I could up a defense for them. (clears throat)\nAnd on top of that, they were dealing in diamonds, and they had a diamond of my aunt's in that apt\nand I was hoping to be able to find that. However, they had found the diamonds. It was good, I\nwas immediately arrested, and they said, \"You're a Jew too!\" and uh, then they looked in my\npocketbook, and stupidly I had in there a letter from Visha Ensant and thanking me for something,\nand she was in the hospital at that ttme. She had a slipped disc, and she was operated on, got her\nhospitalized, she had intolerable pain, and I got her hospitalized under false name in a catholic\nhospital. And they operated on her, and I had a letter in my pocketbook, and it said, \"Visha\" and\nVisha was notorious with the Gestapo. That was very close call because they started asking me,\n\"Who is this Visha?\" Fortunately I knew another Visha, and I made up a story, and, but I was\nsitting in that apt, they had me under arrest, and I'm sitting in that apt and I had my ears open, and I\nfound out, one, that they didn't know the girls were not Jewish. And I found out that they noticed\nthat Leon Nordheim and his wife were sleeping in one bedroom and that they thought she was not\nJewish, I overheard all that. And so this is how I could get them out, or at least help them. And say\nto this ---------, \"I know that they're not Jewish. You know, and you're jeopardizing these people.\"\nWhat do you mean you kept your ears open?\nHmmm?\nWhat do you mean you kept your ears open?",
        "I overheard their conversations, and they said, \"You know, if a man's socks and a woman's\nunderwear in one drawer, they're sleeping together, this Jew, and this non-Jew are sleeping\ntogether.\" And they all thought it was a terrible thing, but at least I knew what they thought they\nknew. So I wasn't going to jeopardize them, you know, and blow their cover. And that's how the\ngirls got out. And of course, when they got out, they came to our house right away. And Bram\ncame out of jail too. He said, \"I was the only Jew walking broad daylight in the Ledsestraat, and I\nwalked in the middle of the street,\" he said, and was so happy, and we said to him, \"What if some\nlittle Gestapo was snooping around and he didn't know that the head of the Gestapo had let you out,\nand you were back in jail before that all got cleared up, and you were shot before that was all found\nout?\" Yeah, he didn't think of that.\nSo, were all of you fearless?\nNo, you could be scared to death, and do what you have to do, like I said, you know, even if it's the\nlast thing I do, I have to do that, I have to because else I can't respect myself.\nThank you\n---------------------planes going overhead.\n30 seconds room tone with aircraft.\nEnd room tone.\nAnother 30 seconds room tone without aircraft.\nEnd room tone.
