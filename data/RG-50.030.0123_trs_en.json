        "Q: Could you please tell me your name?",
        "A: Frima.",
        "Q: When were you born?",
        "A: In \u00b036 \u2014 1936.",
        "Q: Where were you born?",
        "A: Volochisk.",
        "Q: Which is where?",
        "A: Which is part of Russia.",
        "Q: Could you tell me something about your parents?",
        "A: Well, my parents \u2014 of course, to me they were the best parents in the world. My mother was\na housewife. My father made a living for her. And we were a happy family with two other\nchildren. There was three of us, a brother, we were two sisters. And we had a beautiful\nfamily. We had a large family, uncles and aunts, grandparents, niece and nephews, nieces,\ncousins. Unfortunately, all of them were killed by the Germans, by the Nazis actually. And\nthere's very little, very few of us left at the present time. And what is there to talk about? We\nhad a wonderful home. We had a beautiful home. We had a beautiful life until World War II\ncame around and this is when our problems started and our life was destroyed. But we\nsurvived, minus my father, my aunts, my uncles, my cousins, my grandparents. It's just the\nfour of us who survived. And where do we start talking about our lives?",
        "Q: Tell me what happened when the Nazis came in?",
        "A: When they came in we tried to escape. We thought perhaps we would go to White Russia\nwhich supposedly, you could be safe there, but it was too late. After two days of traveling,\nwe had to turn back and we came back to our town. At that time the Nazis had already\nfencing in about 20 blocks or so \u2014 and all the Jewish people had to move out of their homes\nand go to live in that area. And had some distant cousins living there, so we moved in with\nthem and we lived with them. My father since he spoke many languages, he was taken by the\nNazis as an interpreter. And so he would work during the day and come home at night to the\nghetto. The rest of us \u2014 I would \u2014 I stayed home. My mother and my sister were taken to\nwork to labor camps every day and brought back in the evening. While living there, of\ncourse, life was very harsh, very hard. We could not go out of the ghetto. You were supposed\nto stay inside. The minute we moved into the ghetto we had \u2014 they put up the yellow stars on\neach one of us. We always had to walk around in the streets with a yellow star, one in the\nback and one up front. Frightening it was, but that was part of our lives and we existed like\nthis for a few months until one morning very early we heard knocking on the doors and the\nwindows and yelling, you know, \u201cGet out! Get out! Get out!\u201d So quickly we got dressed and\nwe walked out of the house that we were staying in. The Gestapo was there and they told us\nall to go in a certain direction. My mother put on me my beautiful rabbit coat that I had, a\nrabbit coat and a hat. And we started following the other people, and they took us to a large\nbuilding. It must have been a factory and they told us to get undressed. And they would\nmake you take off the jewelry and everything, any valuables that you had on you. They\nundressed \u2014 they told us to get undressed. We all did. The women remained with the\nunderwear only, and the men in their shorts. And my mother wasn't fast enough to take off\nher gold earrings, so she was hit by a Gestapo with the handle of a rifle and she fell down.\nWe picked her up.\nAnd all of us \u2014 there were a few hundred of us \u2014 we were all already undressed, and we had\nto form lines outside. It was a cloudy day, very cloudy, and a very fine drizzle was going\ndown. And all the women were so embarrassed that they were without anything on top that\nthey all covered their breasts with their hands. And they made groups and we started walking\nthe street following the other people. As we were passing some of those streets and there\nwere some Ukrainians who were cheering as we were walking by. They were applauding\nand cheering. But this, this what was done to us. We kept on walking silently without saying\nanything until we were out of the city. And on the roads going towards where they were\ntaking us, there were rows on both sides of Gestapo and German Shepherds. And we kept\nwalking and the drizzle was coming down and I was so scared. I was so afraid that I\ndeveloped diarrhea. But you are not allowed to talk so I didn't tell my mother anything. We\njust kept on walking and walking. And then my mother said, \"Children, you have to pray to\nGod.\" And we did. And as we were walking a black cat crossed the street and somehow\nsomebody said, \"Okay, now you know where we are going. We are going to be killed.\" But\nmy mother said to us, \"Don't think that way. Don't think that way.\" And we kept on walking.\nWhen we got to the field and that was an abandoned slaughter house, there were mountains\nof clothing from the people before that were killed and their clothing was taken off there.\nThey told us to stand in line to wait to be killed and at that time the sun came out and the day\nwas beautiful. The sun was shining. The skies were blue. And so many people standing\nnaked in that line waiting to be killed. And my mother was looking around and she saw this\ntall Gestapo man. Very, very tall. And she took a chance by walking out of the line and\nwalking towards him and asked him, \"Do they kill non-Jews here.\" And he looks at her and\nhe says, \"You're not Jewish?\" And she says, \"No, I'm not.\" And he said, \"Well, what are you\ndoing here?\" She said, \"Well, my husband was taken to prison. He is someplace in one of\nthese cities,\" she said, \"and I decided with my children to come and find him to visit him.\"\nSo we were walking on this road and as they were bringing down the Jews, they took us\nalong and nobody would listen to us.\" With that, with one of his hands, he took my mother's\nhand, my hand, and my sister's hand and he took us out of the line and he said, \"Come with\nme.\" He took us into that abandoned little slaughter house and he told us to sit and wait. In\nthe meantime he told my sister that she should bring some clothing. So he took her to one of\nthose mountains, and she just picked up whatever clothing she was able to get for my\nmother, for myself and herself. And she brought it in and we started putting on the clothing.\nThere was some other people in that place, and one of them was a lady with a baby in her\narms, and she recognized us.\nAnd when the Gestapo came in with a Ukrainian, because the Ukrainians were collaborators,\nand they spoke Ukrainian and Russian and Polish. They spoke \u2014 and they spoke German. So\nin order for the Gestapo to understand, you know, what we were saying because we're\ntalking to him in Ukrainian. My mother was talking Ukrainian to him. So this lady turns\naround and says to him, \"They are Jews. Why aren't they killed.\" And so he hit her, and we\njust sat there frightened. We didn't know what to say. We couldn't say anything. And he took\nus out. We were already dressed. And he said to us \u2014 he said to the Ukrainian, \"You take\nthem to town. You will escort them to town.\" Because you could not possibly walk on the\nroad back when this was \u2014 when they were walking all the Jews to be killed. So the\nUkrainian told us to follow him and we did. As we were walking back, on the side of the\nstreet, of the road my mother saw many of our neighbors who were walking towards the\nslaughter house to be killed. And all she did was sigh because it was very painful to see them\ngo. So the Ukrainian didn't say anything and when we got to the city to town and my mother\nsaid to him, \"Thank you for bringing us back to town,\" he said to us, \"No. We're not letting\nyou go because you are Jewish. You are Jews.\" And my mother says, \"No. I'm not.\" He says,\n\"Yes, you are. I saw you, how you sighed when you saw them, the Jews walking that road.\nAnd we have to interr....\u201c* My mother started, of course, lying and saying, \u201cno\u201d and tells him\nthe same story that she told the, the Gestapo. And he says, \"No, we have to take you in for\ninterrogation and, and then we'll see what happens and then we'll let you go.\" So my mother\nsaid, \"Perhaps I can, you know, give you something. I have some...\u201d you know, some things\nshe had saved whatever. \u201cT'll pay you. Just let us go.\" And he said, \"No.\" He took us to a\nlittle jail which was in the city.\nAnd we were put in a room maybe was 10 by 10 with other criminals and other robbers and\nthieves and everything like that. They put us in there. And every day, they would take us a\nfew blocks from that area to a Gestapo office for interrogation. And so they were, you know,\nasking my mother questions and my sister and, of course, we kept telling them the same\nstory. Nothing \u2014 me they didn't touch. It was just my mother and my sister interrogating to\nsee if they lied or if they were telling the truth. And they just couldn't find anything out and\nthis was already like three, four days. One day they decided that the only way they will be\nsure to find out if we are Jews are not is if they interrogate me. And I was about five and a\nhalf at that time. So they came to jail and I remember this Gestapo put me on his lap and said\nto me \u2014 asking me my name which, of course, we changed our names. We changed our\nidentity. We changed everything. And he started telling me what a beautiful little Jewish girl\nIam. And I sort of jumped at him. I says, \"How can you compare me to a Jewish little girl. I\nam Christian and I am \u2014 we have nothing to do \u2014 I have nothing to do with Jewish girls. I\ndon't even want to look like them.\" Well, he kept interrogating me for about an hour and he\nkept on every second, you know, second word or third word \u201cJewish little girl, Jewish little\ngirl,\u201d and I kept saying you know, \"That's not me and we're not and we're just Christians and\nthat's all.\" Well, after that they realized that you know, they're wrong. That for sure we are\nfrom where we told them we were and we were going where we were going, the whole, the\nwhole bit. But then they decided after checking out the town that my mother gave them,\nthere was no one under such a name and the address. There was no such address and so on\nand so forth \u2014 there was no such people. They realized that there was something not right. So\nthey decided to have us interrogated again. So the next day, we were, all of us, walking on\nthe street going towards the Gestapo office. And of course, there was always a Ukrainian\nwho would be our guard because my mother spoke Ukrainian and one of my sister's friends\nfrom school saw her and she said to her, \"You are still alive?\" With that, the Ukrainian\nrealized that we have to be Jews. And so after he took us \u2014 he didn't say anything, but after\nhe took us for the next interrogation they decided that we have to be killed. We have to be\nexecuted.\nSo they brought us back to our room in jail. And the way the jail was situated was one room\nand then the next room were our guards. So if you want \u2014 had to go to the restroom, you\nwould have to walk into their room, ask for permission and then, you know, either they\nwould go with you because the restroom was outside the building or they would, you know,\nor they would keep one of us like if I wanted to go to the restroom my mother would go with\nme, but my sister would remain in the jail. Or vice versa whichever way. There was always\none of us had to stay in that room because they were always, I guess, afraid that we'll escape.\nWell, after hearing between the other inmates that we are going to be killed my mother\nquickly thought of escaping. And so that evening that we decided to escape we watched the\nguard that was sitting in the room next to ours. He fell asleep so we couldn't out walk all of\nus together because we didn't want our inmates to be suspicious of us. So my mother and I\nstarted walking out thinking that if he wakes up and asks us where we're going, we going to\nthe restroom and my sister remains in the room. But he did not wake up, and we just walked\nout and as we were going down the stairs and you're supposed to turn in to go to the\nbackyard to the bathroom the front door was open. And so my mother said, \"We go.\" Now\nthere was somebody standing in front of that door, but as we came closer to leaving it the\nman just walked away and we ran away. Now, my mother did tell my sister where we're\ngoing to be so when she escapes the same way as we did then we will meet in the area where\nsome of our people \u2014 not our people, our neighbors lived and we decided that's where we're\ngoing to meet.\nAnd it so happened that as my sister started walking out after we had left \u2014 my mother and I\nhad left. She started walking and he woke up and he said to her, \"Where are you going?\"\nAnd she says, \"I'm going to the bathroom.\" And he says, \"Aw, go ahead, your mother's there\nwith your sister.\" Except he didn't know that we're gone already. And so my sister escaped\ntoo. We did meet in the place by the neighbors. And they were hiding us until we decided\nthat the best way to hide will be in our back yard where we had a barn. And so we told one\nof our neighbors that we'll be in the attic of the barn and so she would once a day bring us\nsomething to eat. And the barn was like two stories high. And we didn't know, of course,\nwhere my father was because he was going to work as an interpreter. We hadn't heard from\nhim and he didn't know where we were. So here we were in our barn and this neighbor was\nnice enough to bring us food once a day. But obviously somebody noticed that she was\ncarrying food to the barn, and so one day after about three or four days that we were up there\nsleeping in the \u2014 you know, in the barn on the what we call it \u2014 the wood and everything \u2014\nwe just stayed there. Somebody called the SS and they started following the lady. And she\nrealized that, so she started screaming, \"Save yourselves. Save yourselves.\" She never made\nit to the barn but she was just screaming loud enough for us to hear. So my mother and my\nsister quickly ran to the other end of the barn of the attic and with their bare hands they broke\ntwo panels of heavy wood and we jumped, we jumped. From the two floors we jumped\ndown and we started running away. So by the time the Germans broke into the barn, we were\nalready gone.\nNow we really hadn't no place where to go so we went back to the ghetto and in the ghetto,\nthere was, of course, the other Jewish people and my father was there. So we were reunited\nand we were there again about \u2014 let's see, that was in '41. We were together until the second\npogrom. Now when they started talking about killing us again, my mother and, of course,\nwith my father, they decided that we have to try and escape from the ghetto. Now the ghetto\nwas always surrounded. It was actually with wires, barbed wires. It was barbed wired and\nyou had guards by the entrances. So my mother and my father decided that we have to\nescape. We cannot stay for the second pogrom which was a few months later. So we could\nnot escape together. We had to separate. So my mother took me. We were first to escape at\nnight. We just climbed out between the barbed wire and we went to one of our neighbors \u2014\nnot neighbors, to some friends that we had, Gentiles, which were very nice. Thanks to them,\nI guess, we're still alive. And then next \u2014 like an hour later, my sister and then we were\nreunited, my sister and my mother and myself. We waited for my father and he never\nshowed. We didn't know what happened to him, and we couldn't go back to the ghetto either\nbecause the following day there was another pogrom. So after that we were always hopeful\nthat we will find our father. In the meantime, we had to escape.\nWe had to run away from the city because the second pogrom was already meant to clean\nout the city \u2014 to clean the city out of Jews. So my mother knew someone. Of course, my\nmother \u2014 my father also knew this gentlemen who was a motorman on one of the trains. And\nshe paid him off, he should smuggle her and my sister out of the city. Now, like I said before,\nwe didn't know where my father was. Now she could not take me along because \u201cA\u201d I was\ntoo little and it was very, very cold. It was in the wintertime. And it was very cold and the\nclothes that we had really wasn't warm enough. So she made arrangements with a Gentile\nlady that she should hold, you know, keep me in her house until the spring. And then in the\nspringtime this gentlemen who smuggled my sister and my mother out of \u2014 to Romania that\nhe will come and he will take me, too, and bring me to my mother. The lady agreed, and my\nmother gave her whatever we had, you know, just to make sure that I'm safe. She lived \u2014 she\nhad two of her grandchildren living with her. They did not know that I was Jewish. And I\ndon't look Jewish either. And so she kept me in back of her house. She had like a little room,\na pantry and that \u2014 this 1s where I used to stay and I used to sleep. In fact that pantry was so\ninfested with, with mice that at night, I used to cover myself with a, with a blanket that she\ngave me and feel those mice crawling all over me. My mother had left before. But before she\nleft she told me that she has to go away with my sister and she gave me a hundred rubles and\nshe told me that in the springtime this gentlemen whom I knew will come and he'll bring me\nback to my mother. That it's only going to be a little while and I'm safer staying with this\nlady and her grandchildren here.\nMy mother left, but before she did I cried. And I said, \"I have a headache. Don't leave me.\"\nBut she said she has to go. I guess I understood. And so she gave me the hundred rubles and\nI remained in the lady's house. With her grandchildren, I used to play. After two weeks the\nlady became a little panicky and she was really afraid to keep a Jewish child in the house\nbecause the Germans notify everyone that if a Jew is found tn their house that their house\nwill be burned and the family will be killed. You know, the whole thing. So she was really\nafraid. And so she told me I had to leave her house two weeks later. Well, at that time I was\ninfested already with lice because nobody gave me a bath and I slept in the same clothes and\nI lived in the same clothes and I lived in that pantry with the mice. And so I walked out of\nthe house.\nAnd the first thing I did was go into a \u2014 to a store \u2014 a religious article store and I bought a\nbig cross and I spend my hundred rubles. And then I was so infested with the lice that my\nhead, my skin was all rashes and bloody from scratching it so much. And so I felt that I\nreally needed help and I remembered this lady whom my parents were friendly with and I\nremembered that we used to visit them every so often. That it's quite a bit outside the city. I\ndidn't remember the address and I didn't remember the name. But I just remember how we\nused to walk. And I \u2014 that's how I walked. And I made it to the house. And it was winter and\ncold and the snow was snow maybe five, six inches of snow. And I made it to her house and\nas I got to her gate her dog started barking so she came out to see who was at the gate and\nshe sees me and she says, \"My God, Come in quick. Come in quick.\" And she takes me to\nher barn because obviously she must have noticed that I have lice crawling all over me. So\nshe wouldn't take me into her house but she took me into the barn and she \u2014 quickly she took\noff my clothes and put on other clothes and she said to me, \"Where are your parents?\" I said,\n\"Everybody is killed. Everybody is dead.\" Because I wanted her to have pity on me. And so\nshe did. She took me to her bathroom. She shaved off my head. She gave me a bath. She\ngave me a glass of hot milk and a piece of black bread. And I ate it so fast that I got so sick\nthat she thought I was dying. And she couldn't call a doctor and she had to pull all her shades\ndown. Nobody should see that she has any strangers in her house. And she had a son who\nwas at school and she didn't want the son to know either because the son did know me and\nhe knew that I was Jewish. So she gave me a bath and, and she put on one her \u2014 of her white\ngowns on me and it really felt good because I felt clean. And she put some Vaseline on my\nhead and she kept me in her bedroom for a week, a whole week. Now her son didn't know\nthat until one day about three, four days later he said, \"Why is your bedroom door locked\nand the shades are down?\" And so she felt that she had to tell him, otherwise he might, you\nknow, he might talk about it on the outside and then they'll send the SS and this 1s what's\ngoing to happen to them. So one evening she sort of surprised him. She said to me, \"Come\nin, I want you to see my son and I want him to see you.\" And when I walked in, he almost\ndied because I was wearing her white gown and my head was shaven. And he just became so\nwild, but she said to him, \"Don't you ever tell anyone that you\u2019ve seen Frima.\" And he said,\n\"I promise, I never will.\" And so I stayed with her for another week.\nIn the meantime, like I told you when she gave me that milk and the bread and I got so sick,\nshe didn't know what to do. So her husband and the lady whom I'm very grateful to, she was\ngiving me enemas because I was already blue in my face. I couldn't talk and I was stopping \u2014\nI was slowing down with my breathing. That's how sick I got. Well, after the war she told my\nmother that as she was trying to save my life she said, \"At the same time I was thinking\nwhere am I going to bury your child. I mean nobody supposed to know that there's a Jewish\nkid in my house.\" But anyway, I guess, God was very good to her and was good to me. After\na few enemas, I'm finally \u2014 I woke up and I was stronger and I was able to talk. And after\nstaying a week with her, she said, you know, she can't keep me any longer because she was\nalso afraid that people might become suspicious \u2014 her neighbors. And so here I am without a\nplace to stay, without a home to go to. And I knew I couldn't go back to that lady who told\nme to leave the first place. So I decided that since she had under her house, she had a little \u2014\nlike a little opening with a door, where her dog used to sleep that that's where I'm going to\nsleep too together with her dog, without her knowing it. And so what I used to do 1s walk\naround during the day. Just walk during the day and go to some of the people that I knew and\nthey would give me a piece of bread or give me a potato and I would continue walking and\nwalking and walking. And then at night when it was already dark in the lady's house and it\nwas quiet, I would sneak in. And the dog knew me and he loved me and he didn't even bark.\nSo he used to lie on my legs, keep me warm, and that's how I slept through the night until\nalso very, very early in the morning, I used to get up and pray to God, of course, and put on\nmy kerchief and start walk out from the \u2014 from the \u2014 under the house and just walk the\nstreets again.\nAnd one day as I was walking through the same streets that I walked before I heard a couple\nof young boys saying, \"Gee, she might be a Jew because I've seen her walking here once\nbefore.\" Well after I heard this, I never walked in that area again. I just continued walking to\ndifferent places and different places. And one day I decided to go back in the area where we\nlived. And we had a cat. It was a Persian cat, beautiful gray, dark gray cat. And I wasn't even\nnear the house, and the cat recognized me and he started following me. Now the Nazis didn't\nlike cats. And as I was walking and the cat was walking after me meowing and meowing, I\ncouldn't pick him up because they knew that most of the Jewish people had cats. And so I\nwouldn't pick up my cat. And I just kept walking and he followed me until I was passing the\nbuilding from the kindergarten. And there were two guards sitting outside and they saw my\ncat following me and they killed him. They killed my beautiful cat. And I just kept walking\nas if I didn't know anything and as if I \u2014 the cat did not belong to me. And so I continued\nwalking for about six months. And that was my daily life, sleeping with the dog, walking\nduring the day. And one day when I came back to sleep with the dog, I saw a light on in the\nlady's house and so I imagined they might be awake and therefore I should not go in, you\nknow, go under the house. So next to her there was a bombarded house. There was only four\nwalls. Nothing in it. Full of rubbles and wood and stones and everything. That's where I lay\ndown, between the rubbles and I \u2014 in order to keep warm because it was winter I would blow\nin my breathing the hot air into my jacket \u2014 1n that little jacket. I wore a little jacket, a little\nskirt, and I had somebody's stockings and that's how I stayed through the night there. And, of\ncourse, the next morning I did the same thing. I walked out. And I walked again. Then the\nway that my mother told me that sometimes in the springtime that this gentlemen will come\nand pick me up and bring me to her, so I knew that when he'll come and ask the lady for me,\nshe'll tell him she doesn't know where I am because she did not know where I am. She did\nnot know that I was sleeping under her house with her dog. So when April came around, I\nwould just circle the area in the neighborhood so when I see him I would, you know, get in\ntouch with him and he'll be able to take me to my mother. And that's exactly what happened.\nHe came once and she said she doesn't know where I was, but then somehow he decided to\ncome again because my mother told him that this is where I'm going to be, that she is going\nto keep me until he will, you know, he will come to pick me up. And so one day as soon as I\nwas in that area, I saw him and that's how we met.\nNow he made arrangements and late at night the following day he took me to a train station\nand he hid me in one of those cars full of coils. And then in the middle of the night, he\ntransferred me to a different train and he just told me to lie on one of the cars, which were\ntransported. There were German jeeps transported to Romania. I met another girl. She was\nabout 10 years my senior and he was smuggling her also. So the two of us were lying on this\nopen car full of jeeps and without knowing that in one of the Jeeps there was a German\nsitting. He was the watchman. And, of course, the gentlemen didn't know either that, you\nknow, the, the car that we were on that there was danger. And so we're traveling through the\nnight towards Romania. Now Romania, although it was occupied by the Germans, they had\nsome kind of agreement that the Jews will not be killed. They will live in the ghettos and\nwork, but they will not be killed unless they're on the outside of the ghetto. Alright? So it\nwas sort of a little safer for the Jewish people to, to be. We traveled through the night and\nthen at dawn, I hear a door open. And the two of us are lying there. Now she had a Jewish\naccent. So although I was a little younger, I told her not to speak. She has to be quiet and\nthey really wouldn't know anything. And we'll just make believe we're sleeping. And we\nhear, you know, the Germans with those boots, those high boots, just stamping. He was \u2014\ncame over to us and we just made believe that we don't, we don't know anything. But we\nwere sleeping. But, of course, he kicks me in my back and I made believe I just woke up and\nhe kicks her and he starts yelling in German and I do not speak German. But since I spoke\nYiddish I could understand a little bit, but, of course, I wasn't going to speak to him in\nYiddish so I just kept saying to him in Russian that we, we lost my \u2014 we lost our mother, and\nwe're looking for my mother and whatever. Anyway, he was furious. He kept yelling in\nGerman, and I kept talking to him in Russian and crying, you know, \"My mother. My\nmother. My mother.\" Well that was early in the morning and then about an hour later or so\nwe were coming closer to the town to the city where we were supposed to get off.\nWell, he was so furious. The train stopped and he made us walk down from the train into the\nfields. So although I was begging and I was crying and both of us were crying, he wouldn't\nhear of it. He just told us to get off and he kicked us off, and there we are. And we're\nstanding there and crying and crying and I kept on begging him and begging him and finally\nI changed his mind. He told us to come up again. And so it didn't take too long. After that we\narrived at our destination, and my mother wasn't there. Nobody was there. But some people\nwith whom my mother was were there, and this gentlemen who was smuggling us, he\nbrought us to the house where he was supposed to meet my mother so she can pay him.\nExcept the head of the ghetto threw my mother out and my sister because he knew that my\nmother had some gold pieces which she had saved to pay the gentlemen who smuggled me.\nAnd the head of the ghetto wanted that money, of course, for the Gestapo. So he threw them\nout of the ghetto. And so when I came there my mother wasn't there any longer. My sister\nwasn't there. And the people told me, you know, that my mother went to another ghetto\nwhich was a couple of hours from that area. So they took me to the head of the ghetto and he\nwas Jewish and his wife \u2014 they had no children and I was crying and asking him, \"Where's\nmy mother. I want to be with my mother. Take me to my mother.\" And he said \u2014 and he was\ntrying to convince me that my life will be so much better if I stayed with them and I won't be\nmissing anything and I'll have dolls and I'll have toys and I'll have everything. And I kept\nsaying, \"I want my mother. I want my mother. Please get me back to my mother.\" So finally\nhe said, \"Okay.\"\nAnd they \u2014 there was what do you call it? Horse and buggy going every \u2014 once a day to\ndifferent little towns where, you know, some of the people lived there. So he got me on one\nof those little, little coaches with a horse. There were few men, and I was the only child with\nthem. And as we were traveling through the fields, there were always, always like groups of\n\u2014 I don't know if you call them bandits or whatever. They were always used to look for\nJewish people and beat them up and take everything away from them cause that's \u2014 I guess,\nthat's how they made a living. I don't really know. Well, they stopped our carriage and they\nstarted taking all the men off, because they knew we were Jewish. When I saw this, I jumped\noff the carriage and I kept running, running toward the fields. Now this was springtime. And\nat that time the harvest, they build those what do you call them? You know, they bunched up\nthe harvest so there was a little \u2014 like little tents and I hid 1n one of those, and I was sitting\nthere and thinking, \"Where do I go from here?\" And I was praying and then hours \u2014 a couple\nof hours later I heard horses coming in my direction. And I was sure that they were looking\nfor me, and that they were going to get me. So I decided before I run to different haystacks \u2014\nexactly haystacks \u2014 I should look out and see, you know, what is happening. Well, when I\nlooked out I saw the carriage, the wagon with the horse, and the men on it. And so I ran\ntowards the wagon, and they were, of course, very happy to see me and they kept saying how\nthose bandits were looking for me because they noticed a little girl and I had escaped. So\nthey were very angry because those men were beaten. Everything was taken away from\nthem. And they were all injured, all beaten, but anyway they took me up and they hugged me\nand they kissed me. And we finally made it to a little town where my mother was \u2014 were\nassembled a couple hundred of Jewish people there. And that was before Passover.\nAnd when the word passed around that a wagon came with some men and a little girl, my\nmother and my sister knew that it had to be me so, of course, they ran out to greet me. And\nthat little town, they was \u2014 it was so little that actually the Germans knew where the Jews\nlived so they didn't have to surround it or, you know, put up barbed wire or anything like\nthat. We lived in one room with this Gentile man. We had one cot and all three of us slept on\nit. And there was \u2014 then there was another mother and a daughter that slept on another cot.\nWe worked in his fields to pay him for sort of rent so my mother and my sister worked on\nthe field and I worked on the field. My job was digging out potatoes and carrying them to his\nwarehouse, and for this I would get a loaf of bread a day. That was very good. We are very\nlucky. We remained living there for about a year, at least a year \u2014 I'd say \u201940 \u2014 \u00b042 \u2014 for\nabout a year. And we kept working and then the day before we were liberated, the Germans\nhad dug another grave, a mass grave to kill all of us, like the Final Solution. And the day\nbefore their plan, the Russians were bombarding the city \u2014 the little town and there was street\nfighting going on and we were saved except for those Jewish people who either got killed\nbecause their homes were, you know, where they stayed. It wasn't their homes, but wherever\nthey lived, either the house was bombarded or because of the street fighting or whatever.\nWell, we were lucky to survive. And we went back to look for our father. And all we, the\nnews we had is that he was seen with two Gestapos walking the street, down the street and\nwe never heard from him. And we didn't know that you know, all my aunts and uncles and\ngrandparents and cousins, they're all killed. And we started to build up a new life.\nMy mother was the widow who tried to put our lives together. And so she was selling and\nbuying and selling and trying to make a go of it. The shoes that I was wearing \u2014 we couldn't\nafford to buy anything, so I would go between the destroyed buildings and rubbles and pick\nup rope and with a crochet needle I would crochet slippers and then put a piece of cardboard.\nAnd these were the shoes I wore. And, God, that's how we lived until we decided that\neveryone else is dead, no one is left, that we have to start a new life, and just leave Europe.\nAnd so we joined other Jewish people who hoped that we can escape to Germany. That was\nthe end of the war. We can go to Germany, and from Germany perhaps we can go to\ndifferent countries. And so we did.",
        "Q: Okay. This is a good time for us to break. We're getting ready to change the tape now.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Okay, we're rolling. Why don't you tell me about leaving your father at the ghetto?",
        "A: When my mother and father decided that we should escape before the second pogrom, I did\nnot want to leave. I wanted to stay with my father or whenever he'll escape I'll go with him.\nAnd so I was crying and I said, \"Papa, I don't want to go without you.\" But he insisted. He\nsaid, \"You must go. You go with Mama.\" He says, \"I'll follow you. Don't worry. I'll follow\nyou.\" \"I swear,\" he said, \"We'll meet again.\" And so I listened to what he had to say and I\nbelieved him. And so I, I went with my mother and we escaped. We made it out of the\nghetto. And my father was, was left behind and we just don't know what happened to him\nexcept for the fact that people said they saw him walking down the street with the Gestapo.\nSo, so we never heard from him and nobody ever saw him alive. That was the end of my\nfather's life. And that was bad. Anyway, we have to get back to where we left off. I wanted \u2014\nwhen my mother came to pick me up when I arrived in the little town, they were all\npreparing \u2014 baking Matzos for Passover at that time. And my sister went and, you know,\ntook me from that wagon and walked me to the house where my mother was with the other\npeople baking the Matzos, and my mother, of course, took me in her arms, put me on her lap,\nand started looking on me, checking me out, if I was okay. And suddenly she sees a big cross\nand she says to me, \"My child, mayn kind.\u2019 What is that?\" And I says, \"Mama, I wanted to\nlive so I can tell you what I went through and I wanted to make sure that nobody is\nsuspicious of me, so I had to buy the cross and make believe that I'm Christian. She took it\noff and she gave it to one of the priest in that town where we lived and that was the same\ncross that I used to take off at night when I went to sleep or when I prayed to God and then\nput it on in the morning. It was really big. It was a very big cross. And then walk around the\nstreets so everyone can see that I have it so nobody would be suspicious of me or have any\ndoubts that I'm anything else but a non-Jew. And this was my life for about six months until\nthe day that I came to see my mother and my fa\u2014 and my sister. And after the liberation \u2014\nafter we were liberated, we went back and\u2014",
        "Q: How did you get from Romania back to the Soviet Union.",
        "A: Again, we were going from town to town, from city to city, with wagons, with trains, with\nwhatever was available and we just made it back. But we were very lucky that the day before\nthe execution of all the few Jews that lived in that town, that we were liberated. And it was a\nterrible experience seeing the fighting in the streets and the wounded soldiers. We used to\npull them into the houses and, you know, wash them and then change their socks and then\nand bandage their, their wounds. And these were the ones who, who, thanks to them, we\n' My child (Yiddish)\nsurvived. And then when we got home, most of our home \u2014 house was destroyed, so my\nmother worked very, very hard selling, dealing, making dollars, and with her own hands, she\nput together the home again. You know, like she painted it and she plastered it and she did\neverything. And then we decided that we have to leave, that we weren't safe any longer. So\nthrough different, you know, different papers and different channels, my mother got us out of\nRussia to Poland. And then from Poland we took a train. We took a train to Stuttgart. Yeah,\nStuttgart. And we traveled for a few days. There were other \u2014 yeah, some Jewish people.\nAnd we made it there. And then we were supposed to be smuggled from that area from\nPoland towards Germany in a truck. So, gosh, that truck was full of people. So many! Some\nwas sitting. Some were lying on the floor. When we got to the border and the guards wanted\nto inspect the truck to see, you know, what was 1n the truck. Of course, certainly, they did\nnot think of people, the driver \u2014 he stopped and as the guards were coming to open up and\nsee what was doing, he took off. And they started, of course, shooting, but he kept going\nzigzag, so he was not hit, and we, we made it to Germany. And then there, of course, they\nhad already the displaced person camps and they gave us a place. We stood in Berlin for a\nlittle while, and then from Berlin they would send people to different cities. So we stayed for\nmaybe a couple of weeks in Berlin cause during that period I got sick there also. That's a\ndifferent story. And when I got better they sent us to Bavaria, which had the DP camps,\ndisplaced person camps. And there, there we lived, you know, in one room, but we were\nliberated and we just went on with our lives. There were schools set up, and I went to the\nschool where I learned Hebrew. And the rest of the family, everyone was working and\nmaking a couple of dollars. And then, this 1s a long story short, but I said I'm making a long\nstory short and then we went to \u2014 from Germany. We stayed in Germany for about two and a\nhalf years. Then we went to France.",
        "Q: How did you get from Germany to France?",
        "A: We went by train. We took a train in Munich, and we went to France, to Paris. We stayed in\nParis for about six months. During that period I used to we weren't working, so during that\nperiod, I used to go collect food and clothing for the Moroccan Jews who were very poor and\nthey lived in Paris in a very isolated area. And every week I used to bring clothing and food.\nAnd since I was young and I was able to get around Paris and whoever needed anything or a\nplace, you know, to go someplace and didn't know, I would, you know, I would sort of take\nthem around. I was their guide. And then while there, they were talking about another war.\nThat was really frightening to us. So, we decided that instead of coming to the United States\nwhere we had to wait for a visa and it was a waiting period and we were so scared that we\ndecided to go to Cuba. And there I had an aunt. She quickly made out the papers for us \u2014 the\nnecessary papers and did whatever was necessary and we went there. And lived there until I\ndecided to come to the United States.",
        "Q: How long was that?",
        "A: That's nine years later. And I came to the United States and, of course, always thinking about\nthe past and always worry about the future. Never really feeling liberated, although alive, but\nnever really liberated. And then, of course, met my husband.",
        "Q: Where?",
        "A: It was a blind date. I was going to Teacher\u2019s Institute for Women. And I met a young lady\nthere and we became good friends. And she said to me she wanted me to meet a nice Jewish\nfellow. And that's how we met. We got married. And we have three lovely children. And we\ndo think about the past. We do think about the horrors. My husband was in China during\nWorld War II, and he was \u2014 they were starving. They did not have ghettos or sort of, you\nknow, like we did. They did not have pogroms. They had a ghetto, but they did not have\npogroms. But they were starving. There was no food. And we had the pogroms and we had\nstarvation. We had everything. It was a lot of atrocities going on. Horrible experiences.\nAlways frightened, always feeling you're being followed. In fact the nights when I used to\nwalk the streets and I used to hear the German shepherds bark, to this date I dislike these\ndogs. I really do. And I always used to feel that any minute, you know, they will attack or\nsomething, attack me although it was at night and I used to walk like you against, against\nbuilding between, between trees nobody should see me, nobody should hear me. And\neverything brings memories. When it drizzles and it's cloudy, it brings memories of the day\nwhen they took us to be killed, the first pogrom. When I hear a German shepherd, it brings\nmemories. When I walk the streets, everything seems to bring memories. It's quite\nfrightening. Let's see.",
        "Q: How else did the war affect your life?",
        "A: Everything that I look at brings memories. Everything that I do brings memories. For many\nyears I had nightmares. I used to wake up screaming and screaming. For a while, I used to\ndream about my father. Just everything. If I pass a barn, it brings memories of the escape, of\nwhen we jumped out of the barn and we ran to hide. It just \u2014 there isn't a thing that doesn't....\nWhen I see barbed wire, it's memories of how, how really we lived in that enclosed area not\nbeing allowed to walk, and when I walked in the streets within that area I had, you know, I\nhad the stars, the yellow stars, the Star of David, one 1n the back and one up front. And it\ndidn't matter how old you were or how young you were, you still had to wear them. Even in\npictures, when I see a German uniform brings memories of how they beat us. I mean I was\nlucky, but in front of me, grown-ups if they didn't move fast enough, they were beaten with\nsticks and they were hit with guns. Such horrors. Just horrible things. And just as they affect\nan older person, it certainly affects a child. It's just that we grow up a little stronger perhaps\nthan the elderly people do. And my mother suffered with that ear that, that she was hit. She\nsuffered for until the day she died she wasn't able to hear too well. And it was also memories,\nawful memories. And more memories when there's \u2014 when you lose your father. You lost so\nmany dear ones. Part of your life you lost. It was just a lot of anger. Anger to the world for\ndoing such things, and not to feel when all of us had to stand naked \u2014 such inhumanity. We\nwere just made to feel like animals. And the beatings that one constantly had to go through\nthere, all the people. Then I was, I was from the lucky ones yet. Well, now when we look\nback we hope that the past is remembered so the future will be much better future for every\nhuman being. Really for every human being cause I don't think that the world could possibly\nsurvive with such horrors like we did 1n the \u201830s and \u201840s. And we hope there's gonna be a\nbetter tomorrow, which I always prayed every day while alone until I came together \u2014\nreunited with my mother and my sister. And then when we finally made it to the United\nStates of America, I still don't feel free. I don't think that a survivor will ever feel free. It's\nsomething that was done to his life, to his way of feeling, thinking. Something that nobody\ncan understand, only the survivor himself somehow will have to sort of adjust himself to the\nworld and do his part as a human being. Oh, gosh.\n[Displaying photograph]",

There\nwere a lot of people sitting there and eating and I was standing \u2014 I was so hungry and there\nwas one empty seat next to a gentleman so I figured may as well go in and perhaps\nsomebody will feel sorry for me and pay for, for my soup.

So we always kept in mind who we were. We could not\nshow it. We could not tell anyone about it.

        "A: Well, my parents \u2014 of course, to me they were the best parents in the world. My mother was\na housewife. My father made a living for her. And we were a happy family with two other\nchildren. There was three of us, a brother, we were two sisters. And we had a beautiful\nfamily. We had a large family, uncles and aunts, grandparents, niece and nephews, nieces,\ncousins. Unfortunately, all of them were killed by the Germans, by the Nazis actually. And\nthere's very little, very few of us left at the present time. And what is there to talk about? We\nhad a wonderful home. We had a beautiful home. We had a beautiful life until World War II\ncame around and this is when our problems started and our life was destroyed. But we\nsurvived, minus my father, my aunts, my uncles, my cousins, my grandparents. It's just the\nfour of us who survived. And where do we start talking about our lives?",
        "A: When they came in we tried to escape. We thought perhaps we would go to White Russia\nwhich supposedly, you could be safe there, but it was too late. After two days of traveling,\nwe had to turn back and we came back to our town. At that time the Nazis had already\nfencing in about 20 blocks or so \u2014 and all the Jewish people had to move out of their homes\nand go to live in that area. And had some distant cousins living there, so we moved in with\nthem and we lived with them. My father since he spoke many languages, he was taken by the\nNazis as an interpreter. And so he would work during the day and come home at night to the\nghetto. The rest of us \u2014 I would \u2014 I stayed home. My mother and my sister were taken to\nwork to labor camps every day and brought back in the evening. While living there, of\ncourse, life was very harsh, very hard. We could not go out of the ghetto. You were supposed\nto stay inside. The minute we moved into the ghetto we had \u2014 they put up the yellow stars on\neach one of us. We always had to walk around in the streets with a yellow star, one in the\nback and one up front. Frightening it was, but that was part of our lives and we existed like\nthis for a few months until one morning very early we heard knocking on the doors and the\nwindows and yelling, you know, \u201cGet out! Get out! Get out!\u201d So quickly we got dressed and\nwe walked out of the house that we were staying in. The Gestapo was there and they told us\nall to go in a certain direction. My mother put on me my beautiful rabbit coat that I had, a\nrabbit coat and a hat. And we started following the other people, and they took us to a large\nbuilding. It must have been a factory and they told us to get undressed. And they would\nmake you take off the jewelry and everything, any valuables that you had on you. They\nundressed \u2014 they told us to get undressed. We all did. The women remained with the\nunderwear only, and the men in their shorts. And my mother wasn't fast enough to take off\nher gold earrings, so she was hit by a Gestapo with the handle of a rifle and she fell down.\nWe picked her up.\nAnd all of us \u2014 there were a few hundred of us \u2014 we were all already undressed, and we had\nto form lines outside. It was a cloudy day, very cloudy, and a very fine drizzle was going\ndown. And all the women were so embarrassed that they were without anything on top that\nthey all covered their breasts with their hands. And they made groups and we started walking\nthe street following the other people. As we were passing some of those streets and there\nwere some Ukrainians who were cheering as we were walking by. They were applauding\nand cheering. But this, this what was done to us. We kept on walking silently without saying\nanything until we were out of the city. And on the roads going towards where they were\ntaking us, there were rows on both sides of Gestapo and German Shepherds. And we kept\nwalking and the drizzle was coming down and I was so scared. I was so afraid that I\ndeveloped diarrhea. But you are not allowed to talk so I didn't tell my mother anything. We\njust kept on walking and walking. And then my mother said, \"Children, you have to pray to\nGod.\" And we did. And as we were walking a black cat crossed the street and somehow\nsomebody said, \"Okay, now you know where we are going. We are going to be killed.\" But\nmy mother said to us, \"Don't think that way. Don't think that way.\" And we kept on walking.\nWhen we got to the field and that was an abandoned slaughter house, there were mountains\nof clothing from the people before that were killed and their clothing was taken off there.\nThey told us to stand in line to wait to be killed and at that time the sun came out and the day\nwas beautiful. The sun was shining. The skies were blue. And so many people standing\nnaked in that line waiting to be killed. And my mother was looking around and she saw this\ntall Gestapo man. Very, very tall. And she took a chance by walking out of the line and\nwalking towards him and asked him, \"Do they kill non-Jews here.\" And he looks at her and\nhe says, \"You're not Jewish?\" And she says, \"No, I'm not.\" And he said, \"Well, what are you\ndoing here?\" She said, \"Well, my husband was taken to prison. He is someplace in one of\nthese cities,\" she said, \"and I decided with my children to come and find him to visit him.\"\nSo we were walking on this road and as they were bringing down the Jews, they took us\nalong and nobody would listen to us.\" With that, with one of his hands, he took my mother's\nhand, my hand, and my sister's hand and he took us out of the line and he said, \"Come with\nme.\" He took us into that abandoned little slaughter house and he told us to sit and wait. In\nthe meantime he told my sister that she should bring some clothing. So he took her to one of\nthose mountains, and she just picked up whatever clothing she was able to get for my\nmother, for myself and herself. And she brought it in and we started putting on the clothing.\nThere was some other people in that place, and one of them was a lady with a baby in her\narms, and she recognized us.\nAnd when the Gestapo came in with a Ukrainian, because the Ukrainians were collaborators,\nand they spoke Ukrainian and Russian and Polish. They spoke \u2014 and they spoke German. So\nin order for the Gestapo to understand, you know, what we were saying because we're\ntalking to him in Ukrainian. My mother was talking Ukrainian to him. So this lady turns\naround and says to him, \"They are Jews. Why aren't they killed.\" And so he hit her, and we\njust sat there frightened. We didn't know what to say. We couldn't say anything. And he took\nus out. We were already dressed. And he said to us \u2014 he said to the Ukrainian, \"You take\nthem to town. You will escort them to town.\" Because you could not possibly walk on the\nroad back when this was \u2014 when they were walking all the Jews to be killed. So the\nUkrainian told us to follow him and we did. As we were walking back, on the side of the\nstreet, of the road my mother saw many of our neighbors who were walking towards the\nslaughter house to be killed. And all she did was sigh because it was very painful to see them\ngo. So the Ukrainian didn't say anything and when we got to the city to town and my mother\nsaid to him, \"Thank you for bringing us back to town,\" he said to us, \"No. We're not letting\nyou go because you are Jewish. You are Jews.\" And my mother says, \"No. I'm not.\" He says,\n\"Yes, you are. I saw you, how you sighed when you saw them, the Jews walking that road.\nAnd we have to interr....\u201c* My mother started, of course, lying and saying, \u201cno\u201d and tells him\nthe same story that she told the, the Gestapo. And he says, \"No, we have to take you in for\ninterrogation and, and then we'll see what happens and then we'll let you go.\" So my mother\nsaid, \"Perhaps I can, you know, give you something. I have some...\u201d you know, some things\nshe had saved whatever. \u201cT'll pay you. Just let us go.\" And he said, \"No.\" He took us to a\nlittle jail which was in the city.\nAnd we were put in a room maybe was 10 by 10 with other criminals and other robbers and\nthieves and everything like that. They put us in there. And every day, they would take us a\nfew blocks from that area to a Gestapo office for interrogation. And so they were, you know,\nasking my mother questions and my sister and, of course, we kept telling them the same\nstory. Nothing \u2014 me they didn't touch. It was just my mother and my sister interrogating to\nsee if they lied or if they were telling the truth. And they just couldn't find anything out and\nthis was already like three, four days. One day they decided that the only way they will be\nsure to find out if we are Jews are not is if they interrogate me. And I was about five and a\nhalf at that time. So they came to jail and I remember this Gestapo put me on his lap and said\nto me \u2014 asking me my name which, of course, we changed our names. We changed our\nidentity. We changed everything. And he started telling me what a beautiful little Jewish girl\nIam. And I sort of jumped at him. I says, \"How can you compare me to a Jewish little girl. I\nam Christian and I am \u2014 we have nothing to do \u2014 I have nothing to do with Jewish girls. I\ndon't even want to look like them.\" Well, he kept interrogating me for about an hour and he\nkept on every second, you know, second word or third word \u201cJewish little girl, Jewish little\ngirl,\u201d and I kept saying you know, \"That's not me and we're not and we're just Christians and\nthat's all.\" Well, after that they realized that you know, they're wrong. That for sure we are\nfrom where we told them we were and we were going where we were going, the whole, the\nwhole bit. But then they decided after checking out the town that my mother gave them,\nthere was no one under such a name and the address. There was no such address and so on\nand so forth \u2014 there was no such people. They realized that there was something not right. So\nthey decided to have us interrogated again. So the next day, we were, all of us, walking on\nthe street going towards the Gestapo office. And of course, there was always a Ukrainian\nwho would be our guard because my mother spoke Ukrainian and one of my sister's friends\nfrom school saw her and she said to her, \"You are still alive?\" With that, the Ukrainian\nrealized that we have to be Jews. And so after he took us \u2014 he didn't say anything, but after\nhe took us for the next interrogation they decided that we have to be killed. We have to be\nexecuted.\nSo they brought us back to our room in jail. And the way the jail was situated was one room\nand then the next room were our guards. So if you want \u2014 had to go to the restroom, you\nwould have to walk into their room, ask for permission and then, you know, either they\nwould go with you because the restroom was outside the building or they would, you know,\nor they would keep one of us like if I wanted to go to the restroom my mother would go with\nme, but my sister would remain in the jail. Or vice versa whichever way. There was always\none of us had to stay in that room because they were always, I guess, afraid that we'll escape.\nWell, after hearing between the other inmates that we are going to be killed my mother\nquickly thought of escaping. And so that evening that we decided to escape we watched the\nguard that was sitting in the room next to ours. He fell asleep so we couldn't out walk all of\nus together because we didn't want our inmates to be suspicious of us. So my mother and I\nstarted walking out thinking that if he wakes up and asks us where we're going, we going to\nthe restroom and my sister remains in the room. But he did not wake up, and we just walked\nout and as we were going down the stairs and you're supposed to turn in to go to the\nbackyard to the bathroom the front door was open. And so my mother said, \"We go.\" Now\nthere was somebody standing in front of that door, but as we came closer to leaving it the\nman just walked away and we ran away. Now, my mother did tell my sister where we're\ngoing to be so when she escapes the same way as we did then we will meet in the area where\nsome of our people \u2014 not our people, our neighbors lived and we decided that's where we're\ngoing to meet.\nAnd it so happened that as my sister started walking out after we had left \u2014 my mother and I\nhad left. She started walking and he woke up and he said to her, \"Where are you going?\"\nAnd she says, \"I'm going to the bathroom.\" And he says, \"Aw, go ahead, your mother's there\nwith your sister.\" Except he didn't know that we're gone already. And so my sister escaped\ntoo. We did meet in the place by the neighbors. And they were hiding us until we decided\nthat the best way to hide will be in our back yard where we had a barn. And so we told one\nof our neighbors that we'll be in the attic of the barn and so she would once a day bring us\nsomething to eat. And the barn was like two stories high. And we didn't know, of course,\nwhere my father was because he was going to work as an interpreter. We hadn't heard from\nhim and he didn't know where we were. So here we were in our barn and this neighbor was\nnice enough to bring us food once a day. But obviously somebody noticed that she was\ncarrying food to the barn, and so one day after about three or four days that we were up there\nsleeping in the \u2014 you know, in the barn on the what we call it \u2014 the wood and everything \u2014\nwe just stayed there. Somebody called the SS and they started following the lady. And she\nrealized that, so she started screaming, \"Save yourselves. Save yourselves.\" She never made\nit to the barn but she was just screaming loud enough for us to hear. So my mother and my\nsister quickly ran to the other end of the barn of the attic and with their bare hands they broke\ntwo panels of heavy wood and we jumped, we jumped. From the two floors we jumped\ndown and we started running away. So by the time the Germans broke into the barn, we were\nalready gone.\nNow we really hadn't no place where to go so we went back to the ghetto and in the ghetto,\nthere was, of course, the other Jewish people and my father was there. So we were reunited\nand we were there again about \u2014 let's see, that was in '41. We were together until the second\npogrom. Now when they started talking about killing us again, my mother and, of course,\nwith my father, they decided that we have to try and escape from the ghetto. Now the ghetto\nwas always surrounded. It was actually with wires, barbed wires. It was barbed wired and\nyou had guards by the entrances. So my mother and my father decided that we have to\nescape. We cannot stay for the second pogrom which was a few months later. So we could\nnot escape together. We had to separate. So my mother took me. We were first to escape at\nnight. We just climbed out between the barbed wire and we went to one of our neighbors \u2014\nnot neighbors, to some friends that we had, Gentiles, which were very nice. Thanks to them,\nI guess, we're still alive. And then next \u2014 like an hour later, my sister and then we were\nreunited, my sister and my mother and myself. We waited for my father and he never\nshowed. We didn't know what happened to him, and we couldn't go back to the ghetto either\nbecause the following day there was another pogrom. So after that we were always hopeful\nthat we will find our father. In the meantime, we had to escape.\nWe had to run away from the city because the second pogrom was already meant to clean\nout the city \u2014 to clean the city out of Jews. So my mother knew someone. Of course, my\nmother \u2014 my father also knew this gentlemen who was a motorman on one of the trains. And\nshe paid him off, he should smuggle her and my sister out of the city. Now, like I said before,\nwe didn't know where my father was. Now she could not take me along because \u201cA\u201d I was\ntoo little and it was very, very cold. It was in the wintertime. And it was very cold and the\nclothes that we had really wasn't warm enough. So she made arrangements with a Gentile\nlady that she should hold, you know, keep me in her house until the spring. And then in the\nspringtime this gentlemen who smuggled my sister and my mother out of \u2014 to Romania that\nhe will come and he will take me, too, and bring me to my mother. The lady agreed, and my\nmother gave her whatever we had, you know, just to make sure that I'm safe. She lived \u2014 she\nhad two of her grandchildren living with her. They did not know that I was Jewish. And I\ndon't look Jewish either. And so she kept me in back of her house. She had like a little room,\na pantry and that \u2014 this 1s where I used to stay and I used to sleep. In fact that pantry was so\ninfested with, with mice that at night, I used to cover myself with a, with a blanket that she\ngave me and feel those mice crawling all over me. My mother had left before. But before she\nleft she told me that she has to go away with my sister and she gave me a hundred rubles and\nshe told me that in the springtime this gentlemen whom I knew will come and he'll bring me\nback to my mother. That it's only going to be a little while and I'm safer staying with this\nlady and her grandchildren here.\nMy mother left, but before she did I cried. And I said, \"I have a headache. Don't leave me.\"\nBut she said she has to go. I guess I understood. And so she gave me the hundred rubles and\nI remained in the lady's house. With her grandchildren, I used to play. After two weeks the\nlady became a little panicky and she was really afraid to keep a Jewish child in the house\nbecause the Germans notify everyone that if a Jew is found tn their house that their house\nwill be burned and the family will be killed. You know, the whole thing. So she was really\nafraid. And so she told me I had to leave her house two weeks later. Well, at that time I was\ninfested already with lice because nobody gave me a bath and I slept in the same clothes and\nI lived in the same clothes and I lived in that pantry with the mice. And so I walked out of\nthe house.\nAnd the first thing I did was go into a \u2014 to a store \u2014 a religious article store and I bought a\nbig cross and I spend my hundred rubles. And then I was so infested with the lice that my\nhead, my skin was all rashes and bloody from scratching it so much. And so I felt that I\nreally needed help and I remembered this lady whom my parents were friendly with and I\nremembered that we used to visit them every so often. That it's quite a bit outside the city. I\ndidn't remember the address and I didn't remember the name. But I just remember how we\nused to walk. And I \u2014 that's how I walked. And I made it to the house. And it was winter and\ncold and the snow was snow maybe five, six inches of snow. And I made it to her house and\nas I got to her gate her dog started barking so she came out to see who was at the gate and\nshe sees me and she says, \"My God, Come in quick. Come in quick.\" And she takes me to\nher barn because obviously she must have noticed that I have lice crawling all over me. So\nshe wouldn't take me into her house but she took me into the barn and she \u2014 quickly she took\noff my clothes and put on other clothes and she said to me, \"Where are your parents?\" I said,\n\"Everybody is killed. Everybody is dead.\" Because I wanted her to have pity on me. And so\nshe did. She took me to her bathroom. She shaved off my head. She gave me a bath. She\ngave me a glass of hot milk and a piece of black bread. And I ate it so fast that I got so sick\nthat she thought I was dying. And she couldn't call a doctor and she had to pull all her shades\ndown. Nobody should see that she has any strangers in her house. And she had a son who\nwas at school and she didn't want the son to know either because the son did know me and\nhe knew that I was Jewish. So she gave me a bath and, and she put on one her \u2014 of her white\ngowns on me and it really felt good because I felt clean. And she put some Vaseline on my\nhead and she kept me in her bedroom for a week, a whole week. Now her son didn't know\nthat until one day about three, four days later he said, \"Why is your bedroom door locked\nand the shades are down?\" And so she felt that she had to tell him, otherwise he might, you\nknow, he might talk about it on the outside and then they'll send the SS and this 1s what's\ngoing to happen to them. So one evening she sort of surprised him. She said to me, \"Come\nin, I want you to see my son and I want him to see you.\" And when I walked in, he almost\ndied because I was wearing her white gown and my head was shaven. And he just became so\nwild, but she said to him, \"Don't you ever tell anyone that you\u2019ve seen Frima.\" And he said,\n\"I promise, I never will.\" And so I stayed with her for another week.\nIn the meantime, like I told you when she gave me that milk and the bread and I got so sick,\nshe didn't know what to do. So her husband and the lady whom I'm very grateful to, she was\ngiving me enemas because I was already blue in my face. I couldn't talk and I was stopping \u2014\nI was slowing down with my breathing. That's how sick I got. Well, after the war she told my\nmother that as she was trying to save my life she said, \"At the same time I was thinking\nwhere am I going to bury your child. I mean nobody supposed to know that there's a Jewish\nkid in my house.\" But anyway, I guess, God was very good to her and was good to me. After\na few enemas, I'm finally \u2014 I woke up and I was stronger and I was able to talk. And after\nstaying a week with her, she said, you know, she can't keep me any longer because she was\nalso afraid that people might become suspicious \u2014 her neighbors. And so here I am without a\nplace to stay, without a home to go to. And I knew I couldn't go back to that lady who told\nme to leave the first place. So I decided that since she had under her house, she had a little \u2014\nlike a little opening with a door, where her dog used to sleep that that's where I'm going to\nsleep too together with her dog, without her knowing it. And so what I used to do 1s walk\naround during the day. Just walk during the day and go to some of the people that I knew and\nthey would give me a piece of bread or give me a potato and I would continue walking and\nwalking and walking. And then at night when it was already dark in the lady's house and it\nwas quiet, I would sneak in. And the dog knew me and he loved me and he didn't even bark.\nSo he used to lie on my legs, keep me warm, and that's how I slept through the night until\nalso very, very early in the morning, I used to get up and pray to God, of course, and put on\nmy kerchief and start walk out from the \u2014 from the \u2014 under the house and just walk the\nstreets again.\nAnd one day as I was walking through the same streets that I walked before I heard a couple\nof young boys saying, \"Gee, she might be a Jew because I've seen her walking here once\nbefore.\" Well after I heard this, I never walked in that area again. I just continued walking to\ndifferent places and different places. And one day I decided to go back in the area where we\nlived. And we had a cat. It was a Persian cat, beautiful gray, dark gray cat. And I wasn't even\nnear the house, and the cat recognized me and he started following me. Now the Nazis didn't\nlike cats. And as I was walking and the cat was walking after me meowing and meowing, I\ncouldn't pick him up because they knew that most of the Jewish people had cats. And so I\nwouldn't pick up my cat. And I just kept walking and he followed me until I was passing the\nbuilding from the kindergarten. And there were two guards sitting outside and they saw my\ncat following me and they killed him. They killed my beautiful cat. And I just kept walking\nas if I didn't know anything and as if I \u2014 the cat did not belong to me. And so I continued\nwalking for about six months. And that was my daily life, sleeping with the dog, walking\nduring the day. And one day when I came back to sleep with the dog, I saw a light on in the\nlady's house and so I imagined they might be awake and therefore I should not go in, you\nknow, go under the house. So next to her there was a bombarded house. There was only four\nwalls. Nothing in it. Full of rubbles and wood and stones and everything. That's where I lay\ndown, between the rubbles and I \u2014 in order to keep warm because it was winter I would blow\nin my breathing the hot air into my jacket \u2014 1n that little jacket. I wore a little jacket, a little\nskirt, and I had somebody's stockings and that's how I stayed through the night there. And, of\ncourse, the next morning I did the same thing. I walked out. And I walked again. Then the\nway that my mother told me that sometimes in the springtime that this gentlemen will come\nand pick me up and bring me to her, so I knew that when he'll come and ask the lady for me,\nshe'll tell him she doesn't know where I am because she did not know where I am. She did\nnot know that I was sleeping under her house with her dog. So when April came around, I\nwould just circle the area in the neighborhood so when I see him I would, you know, get in\ntouch with him and he'll be able to take me to my mother. And that's exactly what happened.\nHe came once and she said she doesn't know where I was, but then somehow he decided to\ncome again because my mother told him that this is where I'm going to be, that she is going\nto keep me until he will, you know, he will come to pick me up. And so one day as soon as I\nwas in that area, I saw him and that's how we met.\nNow he made arrangements and late at night the following day he took me to a train station\nand he hid me in one of those cars full of coils. And then in the middle of the night, he\ntransferred me to a different train and he just told me to lie on one of the cars, which were\ntransported. There were German jeeps transported to Romania. I met another girl. She was\nabout 10 years my senior and he was smuggling her also. So the two of us were lying on this\nopen car full of jeeps and without knowing that in one of the Jeeps there was a German\nsitting. He was the watchman. And, of course, the gentlemen didn't know either that, you\nknow, the, the car that we were on that there was danger. And so we're traveling through the\nnight towards Romania. Now Romania, although it was occupied by the Germans, they had\nsome kind of agreement that the Jews will not be killed. They will live in the ghettos and\nwork, but they will not be killed unless they're on the outside of the ghetto. Alright? So it\nwas sort of a little safer for the Jewish people to, to be. We traveled through the night and\nthen at dawn, I hear a door open. And the two of us are lying there. Now she had a Jewish\naccent. So although I was a little younger, I told her not to speak. She has to be quiet and\nthey really wouldn't know anything. And we'll just make believe we're sleeping. And we\nhear, you know, the Germans with those boots, those high boots, just stamping. He was \u2014\ncame over to us and we just made believe that we don't, we don't know anything. But we\nwere sleeping. But, of course, he kicks me in my back and I made believe I just woke up and\nhe kicks her and he starts yelling in German and I do not speak German. But since I spoke\nYiddish I could understand a little bit, but, of course, I wasn't going to speak to him in\nYiddish so I just kept saying to him in Russian that we, we lost my \u2014 we lost our mother, and\nwe're looking for my mother and whatever. Anyway, he was furious. He kept yelling in\nGerman, and I kept talking to him in Russian and crying, you know, \"My mother. My\nmother. My mother.\" Well that was early in the morning and then about an hour later or so\nwe were coming closer to the town to the city where we were supposed to get off.\nWell, he was so furious. The train stopped and he made us walk down from the train into the\nfields. So although I was begging and I was crying and both of us were crying, he wouldn't\nhear of it. He just told us to get off and he kicked us off, and there we are. And we're\nstanding there and crying and crying and I kept on begging him and begging him and finally\nI changed his mind. He told us to come up again. And so it didn't take too long. After that we\narrived at our destination, and my mother wasn't there. Nobody was there. But some people\nwith whom my mother was were there, and this gentlemen who was smuggling us, he\nbrought us to the house where he was supposed to meet my mother so she can pay him.\nExcept the head of the ghetto threw my mother out and my sister because he knew that my\nmother had some gold pieces which she had saved to pay the gentlemen who smuggled me.\nAnd the head of the ghetto wanted that money, of course, for the Gestapo. So he threw them\nout of the ghetto. And so when I came there my mother wasn't there any longer. My sister\nwasn't there. And the people told me, you know, that my mother went to another ghetto\nwhich was a couple of hours from that area. So they took me to the head of the ghetto and he\nwas Jewish and his wife \u2014 they had no children and I was crying and asking him, \"Where's\nmy mother. I want to be with my mother. Take me to my mother.\" And he said \u2014 and he was\ntrying to convince me that my life will be so much better if I stayed with them and I won't be\nmissing anything and I'll have dolls and I'll have toys and I'll have everything. And I kept\nsaying, \"I want my mother. I want my mother. Please get me back to my mother.\" So finally\nhe said, \"Okay.\"\nAnd they \u2014 there was what do you call it? Horse and buggy going every \u2014 once a day to\ndifferent little towns where, you know, some of the people lived there. So he got me on one\nof those little, little coaches with a horse. There were few men, and I was the only child with\nthem. And as we were traveling through the fields, there were always, always like groups of\n\u2014 I don't know if you call them bandits or whatever. They were always used to look for\nJewish people and beat them up and take everything away from them cause that's \u2014 I guess,\nthat's how they made a living. I don't really know. Well, they stopped our carriage and they\nstarted taking all the men off, because they knew we were Jewish. When I saw this, I jumped\noff the carriage and I kept running, running toward the fields. Now this was springtime. And\nat that time the harvest, they build those what do you call them? You know, they bunched up\nthe harvest so there was a little \u2014 like little tents and I hid 1n one of those, and I was sitting\nthere and thinking, \"Where do I go from here?\" And I was praying and then hours \u2014 a couple\nof hours later I heard horses coming in my direction. And I was sure that they were looking\nfor me, and that they were going to get me. So I decided before I run to different haystacks \u2014\nexactly haystacks \u2014 I should look out and see, you know, what is happening. Well, when I\nlooked out I saw the carriage, the wagon with the horse, and the men on it. And so I ran\ntowards the wagon, and they were, of course, very happy to see me and they kept saying how\nthose bandits were looking for me because they noticed a little girl and I had escaped. So\nthey were very angry because those men were beaten. Everything was taken away from\nthem. And they were all injured, all beaten, but anyway they took me up and they hugged me\nand they kissed me. And we finally made it to a little town where my mother was \u2014 were\nassembled a couple hundred of Jewish people there. And that was before Passover.\nAnd when the word passed around that a wagon came with some men and a little girl, my\nmother and my sister knew that it had to be me so, of course, they ran out to greet me. And\nthat little town, they was \u2014 it was so little that actually the Germans knew where the Jews\nlived so they didn't have to surround it or, you know, put up barbed wire or anything like\nthat. We lived in one room with this Gentile man. We had one cot and all three of us slept on\nit. And there was \u2014 then there was another mother and a daughter that slept on another cot.\nWe worked in his fields to pay him for sort of rent so my mother and my sister worked on\nthe field and I worked on the field. My job was digging out potatoes and carrying them to his\nwarehouse, and for this I would get a loaf of bread a day. That was very good. We are very\nlucky. We remained living there for about a year, at least a year \u2014 I'd say \u201940 \u2014 \u00b042 \u2014 for\nabout a year. And we kept working and then the day before we were liberated, the Germans\nhad dug another grave, a mass grave to kill all of us, like the Final Solution. And the day\nbefore their plan, the Russians were bombarding the city \u2014 the little town and there was street\nfighting going on and we were saved except for those Jewish people who either got killed\nbecause their homes were, you know, where they stayed. It wasn't their homes, but wherever\nthey lived, either the house was bombarded or because of the street fighting or whatever.\nWell, we were lucky to survive. And we went back to look for our father. And all we, the\nnews we had is that he was seen with two Gestapos walking the street, down the street and\nwe never heard from him. And we didn't know that you know, all my aunts and uncles and\ngrandparents and cousins, they're all killed. And we started to build up a new life.\nMy mother was the widow who tried to put our lives together. And so she was selling and\nbuying and selling and trying to make a go of it. The shoes that I was wearing \u2014 we couldn't\nafford to buy anything, so I would go between the destroyed buildings and rubbles and pick\nup rope and with a crochet needle I would crochet slippers and then put a piece of cardboard.\nAnd these were the shoes I wore. And, God, that's how we lived until we decided that\neveryone else is dead, no one is left, that we have to start a new life, and just leave Europe.\nAnd so we joined other Jewish people who hoped that we can escape to Germany. That was\nthe end of the war. We can go to Germany, and from Germany perhaps we can go to\ndifferent countries. And so we did.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: When my mother and father decided that we should escape before the second pogrom, I did\nnot want to leave. I wanted to stay with my father or whenever he'll escape I'll go with him.\nAnd so I was crying and I said, \"Papa, I don't want to go without you.\" But he insisted. He\nsaid, \"You must go. You go with Mama.\" He says, \"I'll follow you. Don't worry. I'll follow\nyou.\" \"I swear,\" he said, \"We'll meet again.\" And so I listened to what he had to say and I\nbelieved him. And so I, I went with my mother and we escaped. We made it out of the\nghetto. And my father was, was left behind and we just don't know what happened to him\nexcept for the fact that people said they saw him walking down the street with the Gestapo.\nSo, so we never heard from him and nobody ever saw him alive. That was the end of my\nfather's life. And that was bad. Anyway, we have to get back to where we left off. I wanted \u2014\nwhen my mother came to pick me up when I arrived in the little town, they were all\npreparing \u2014 baking Matzos for Passover at that time. And my sister went and, you know,\ntook me from that wagon and walked me to the house where my mother was with the other\npeople baking the Matzos, and my mother, of course, took me in her arms, put me on her lap,\nand started looking on me, checking me out, if I was okay. And suddenly she sees a big cross\nand she says to me, \"My child, mayn kind.\u2019 What is that?\" And I says, \"Mama, I wanted to\nlive so I can tell you what I went through and I wanted to make sure that nobody is\nsuspicious of me, so I had to buy the cross and make believe that I'm Christian. She took it\noff and she gave it to one of the priest in that town where we lived and that was the same\ncross that I used to take off at night when I went to sleep or when I prayed to God and then\nput it on in the morning. It was really big. It was a very big cross. And then walk around the\nstreets so everyone can see that I have it so nobody would be suspicious of me or have any\ndoubts that I'm anything else but a non-Jew. And this was my life for about six months until\nthe day that I came to see my mother and my fa\u2014 and my sister. And after the liberation \u2014\nafter we were liberated, we went back and\u2014",
        "A: Again, we were going from town to town, from city to city, with wagons, with trains, with\nwhatever was available and we just made it back. But we were very lucky that the day before\nthe execution of all the few Jews that lived in that town, that we were liberated. And it was a\nterrible experience seeing the fighting in the streets and the wounded soldiers. We used to\npull them into the houses and, you know, wash them and then change their socks and then\nand bandage their, their wounds. And these were the ones who, who, thanks to them, we\n' My child (Yiddish)\nsurvived. And then when we got home, most of our home \u2014 house was destroyed, so my\nmother worked very, very hard selling, dealing, making dollars, and with her own hands, she\nput together the home again. You know, like she painted it and she plastered it and she did\neverything. And then we decided that we have to leave, that we weren't safe any longer. So\nthrough different, you know, different papers and different channels, my mother got us out of\nRussia to Poland. And then from Poland we took a train. We took a train to Stuttgart. Yeah,\nStuttgart. And we traveled for a few days. There were other \u2014 yeah, some Jewish people.\nAnd we made it there. And then we were supposed to be smuggled from that area from\nPoland towards Germany in a truck. So, gosh, that truck was full of people. So many! Some\nwas sitting. Some were lying on the floor. When we got to the border and the guards wanted\nto inspect the truck to see, you know, what was 1n the truck. Of course, certainly, they did\nnot think of people, the driver \u2014 he stopped and as the guards were coming to open up and\nsee what was doing, he took off. And they started, of course, shooting, but he kept going\nzigzag, so he was not hit, and we, we made it to Germany. And then there, of course, they\nhad already the displaced person camps and they gave us a place. We stood in Berlin for a\nlittle while, and then from Berlin they would send people to different cities. So we stayed for\nmaybe a couple of weeks in Berlin cause during that period I got sick there also. That's a\ndifferent story. And when I got better they sent us to Bavaria, which had the DP camps,\ndisplaced person camps. And there, there we lived, you know, in one room, but we were\nliberated and we just went on with our lives. There were schools set up, and I went to the\nschool where I learned Hebrew. And the rest of the family, everyone was working and\nmaking a couple of dollars. And then, this 1s a long story short, but I said I'm making a long\nstory short and then we went to \u2014 from Germany. We stayed in Germany for about two and a\nhalf years. Then we went to France.",
        "A: We went by train. We took a train in Munich, and we went to France, to Paris. We stayed in\nParis for about six months. During that period I used to we weren't working, so during that\nperiod, I used to go collect food and clothing for the Moroccan Jews who were very poor and\nthey lived in Paris in a very isolated area. And every week I used to bring clothing and food.\nAnd since I was young and I was able to get around Paris and whoever needed anything or a\nplace, you know, to go someplace and didn't know, I would, you know, I would sort of take\nthem around. I was their guide. And then while there, they were talking about another war.\nThat was really frightening to us. So, we decided that instead of coming to the United States\nwhere we had to wait for a visa and it was a waiting period and we were so scared that we\ndecided to go to Cuba. And there I had an aunt. She quickly made out the papers for us \u2014 the\nnecessary papers and did whatever was necessary and we went there. And lived there until I\ndecided to come to the United States.",
        "A: That's nine years later. And I came to the United States and, of course, always thinking about\nthe past and always worry about the future. Never really feeling liberated, although alive, but\nnever really liberated. And then, of course, met my husband.",
        "A: It was a blind date. I was going to Teacher\u2019s Institute for Women. And I met a young lady\nthere and we became good friends. And she said to me she wanted me to meet a nice Jewish\nfellow. And that's how we met. We got married. And we have three lovely children. And we\ndo think about the past. We do think about the horrors. My husband was in China during\nWorld War II, and he was \u2014 they were starving. They did not have ghettos or sort of, you\nknow, like we did. They did not have pogroms. They had a ghetto, but they did not have\npogroms. But they were starving. There was no food. And we had the pogroms and we had\nstarvation. We had everything. It was a lot of atrocities going on. Horrible experiences.\nAlways frightened, always feeling you're being followed. In fact the nights when I used to\nwalk the streets and I used to hear the German shepherds bark, to this date I dislike these\ndogs. I really do. And I always used to feel that any minute, you know, they will attack or\nsomething, attack me although it was at night and I used to walk like you against, against\nbuilding between, between trees nobody should see me, nobody should hear me. And\neverything brings memories. When it drizzles and it's cloudy, it brings memories of the day\nwhen they took us to be killed, the first pogrom. When I hear a German shepherd, it brings\nmemories. When I walk the streets, everything seems to bring memories. It's quite\nfrightening. Let's see.",
        "A: Everything that I look at brings memories. Everything that I do brings memories. For many\nyears I had nightmares. I used to wake up screaming and screaming. For a while, I used to\ndream about my father. Just everything. If I pass a barn, it brings memories of the escape, of\nwhen we jumped out of the barn and we ran to hide. It just \u2014 there isn't a thing that doesn't....\nWhen I see barbed wire, it's memories of how, how really we lived in that enclosed area not\nbeing allowed to walk, and when I walked in the streets within that area I had, you know, I\nhad the stars, the yellow stars, the Star of David, one 1n the back and one up front. And it\ndidn't matter how old you were or how young you were, you still had to wear them. Even in\npictures, when I see a German uniform brings memories of how they beat us. I mean I was\nlucky, but in front of me, grown-ups if they didn't move fast enough, they were beaten with\nsticks and they were hit with guns. Such horrors. Just horrible things. And just as they affect\nan older person, it certainly affects a child. It's just that we grow up a little stronger perhaps\nthan the elderly people do. And my mother suffered with that ear that, that she was hit. She\nsuffered for until the day she died she wasn't able to hear too well. And it was also memories,\nawful memories. And more memories when there's \u2014 when you lose your father. You lost so\nmany dear ones. Part of your life you lost. It was just a lot of anger. Anger to the world for\ndoing such things, and not to feel when all of us had to stand naked \u2014 such inhumanity. We\nwere just made to feel like animals. And the beatings that one constantly had to go through\nthere, all the people. Then I was, I was from the lucky ones yet. Well, now when we look\nback we hope that the past is remembered so the future will be much better future for every\nhuman being. Really for every human being cause I don't think that the world could possibly\nsurvive with such horrors like we did 1n the \u201830s and \u201840s. And we hope there's gonna be a\nbetter tomorrow, which I always prayed every day while alone until I came together \u2014\nreunited with my mother and my sister. And then when we finally made it to the United\nStates of America, I still don't feel free. I don't think that a survivor will ever feel free. It's\nsomething that was done to his life, to his way of feeling, thinking. Something that nobody\ncan understand, only the survivor himself somehow will have to sort of adjust himself to the\nworld and do his part as a human being. Oh, gosh.\n[Displaying photograph]",
        "A: This was home. This was in \u201945. That is me, in 1945, at home after I had gained a little\nweight. My mother was able to get me a sweater and a little hat. It felt good. So she called a\nphotographer. She said, \u201cYou look so great, I must take a picture.\u201d And this picture was\ntaken in the house.\n[Displaying photograph]",
