        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with John Meyerstein.",
        "Answer: Stein.",
        "Q: John Meyerstein, conducted by Nina Ellis on July first, 2004, in Washington, D.C. This is\ntape number one, side A. Just for the record, would you tell me your name, where you live now,\nand when and where you were born.",
        "A: Okay. My name is John Meyerstein. I was originally called Hans Meyerstein, but when we\narrived in England after the St. Louis voyage, it was suggested to my parents that -- that they\ngive me an English first name, and the name John was chosen, I\u2019m not sure how, and it\u2019s -- from\nthat moment onwards it became that, and my parents never used any other name but that, at the\ntime. I currently live in Oakville, Ontario, which is about 20 miles west of Toronto. I was born in\nHalle, Germany, on the 21*' of March, 1935.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Tell me, do you have many memories of those first years in Germany?",
        "A: Truthfully I have to say no. I know that some people say that they can remember everything\nwhen they were in a pram, or a cradle. I have to be truthful and say I do not recall those sort of\nthings.",
        "Q: Okay. Tell me about your parents, their names, and where they were from.",
        "A: My father was Ludwig Meyerstein. He was born in Rosslau, Germany in -- on March the 10\",\n1893. My mother was Alice Meyerstein, born Alice Eisner, and she was born in a -- a place\ncalled Gutentag, in Upper Silesia, Germany, on the 29\" of June, 1910.",
        "Q: And do you know wh-where they met, and how -- how they came to be married?",
        "A: How they met I don\u2019t know, I rather suspect it was one of these arranged marriages. Both my\nfamilies -- both my parent\u2019s families were financially very well off, and I can only conclude that\nit was assumed that this would be a good way of having a marriage. My mother never discussed\nit, in fact she probably talked to my wife years later on things which she didn\u2019t discuss with me.\nBut how they actually met, and -- I don\u2019t know, I rather think it was a -- an arranged marriage,\nbut how that was done, if -- if my assessment 1s correct, I have no idea.",
        "Q: And your father served in World War I, I understand.",
        "A: Yes, he was -- he served in -- four years in -- in World War I, together with an older brother,\nwho also served fo -- four years, and a younger brother, who was also in -- in World War I, but\nwho did not come back, he was killed in -- in 1918, I think, a week or two before Armistice Day,\nand was listed as missing 1n action, and never -- never found again, actually. So there were three\nbrothers, of which my father was one, went to the wars, in 1914 - \u201918, and only two came back.",
        "Q: You know what -- what kind of service your father performed, or where he was --",
        "A: My -- I -- I -- I think my father\u2019s younger brother was in an infantry regiment. My father and\nhis elder brother, Hugo -- and I should say that my father\u2019s younger brother, the one who was\nkilled in 1914 - \u201918, was called Hans, and that was why I was originally called Hans, because my\ngrandmother wanted to have a -- a grandson following that name. My father and his elder brother\nHugo both served in cal -- cavalry regiments to begin with, and Is -- I don\u2019t know how far the\ncavalry went, because as you know, things changed, and cavalry re -- regiments then became\nextinct almost, and presumably went into infantry regiments. My father\u2019s elder brother Hugo\ncame out at the end of the war as a captain, and my father ended the war, I think, as a second\nleftenant.",
        "Q: Do you know where he served, and --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- did he see combat?",
        "A: I -- I -- I think they both did, I do not know where they served. I believe it was always on the\nwestern front, because I think that my father would have mentioned something if -- if -- if it had\nbeen elsewhere on the eastern front at that time. I have my father\u2019s military b-book, you know, of\nthe class of -- of 19 f -- I can\u2019t think what they call it now, class of 1914, or -- or something like\nthat. But it doesn\u2019t show exactly where all these things were, it wa -- just like a military record\nbook, which I had years later in the British army, when I was drafted. But I\u2019ve also since, in the\nlast -- since my father\u2019s death, found my grandfather\u2019s military book, and he was in the class of\n1879, in the militia, in an artillery regiment. So, on my father\u2019s side of the family, military\nactivity was not a -- an unusual activity, despite what the -- the Germans said, that there were\nthat few -- not that many Jews volunteered or fought, that was totally incorrect. I do recall that\nmy father mentioned to me that he provi -- that his father, my grandfather, provided the horses,\nand gave them money and so forth, because in the units which they had to serve, particularly\nsince they ultimately ended up in -- with -- in the commission rank, that required more funding,\nand my parents were obviously in -- in a position to -- to -- to -- to -- to -- to provide that. The\nother thing which I found rather interesting, contrary to what I sometimes read, is that my father,\non one or two occasions, and these were things which we could always discuss, said to me that\nwhen he entered the -- the cavalry regiment, or was in -- was -- w-was organized to go to this\nunit, that the -- the colonel of the regiment said to him, \u201cWell, Meyerstein, you can\u2019t say that\nthere are any anti -- anti-Jews here, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d So again, I find it\nsometimes a bit awkwa -- difficult to understand when I read various documents, as to what took\n-- actually took place. Obviously there were anti-Jewish Germans, and there were Germans who\ndidn\u2019t view this in any shape or form. Whether that\u2019s normal, I can\u2019t say actually, you know.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And they -- and my brother -- and one other thing which I think you might find interesting --\nand this was apparently -- this wa -- given to me by my mother, who had a very good\nrelationship in terms of -- of f-friendship with my father\u2019s brother, 1s after World War I, when\nthe German army was reorganized -- this was told by my Uncle Hugo to my mother, they got in\ntouch with my Uncle Hugo, who obviously had a very good military record, and said, \u201c\u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t you come back into the German army?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, you know, I\u2019m Jewish.\u201d And -\n- and apparently they said to him, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you just say you\u2019re Christian, it won\u2019t any\ndifference,\u201d and -- and left it. He didn\u2019t, of course, do that. What I\u2019m getting at it\u2019s so peculiar\nand so strange in what subsequently took place.",
        "Q: What business was your father\u2019s family in?",
        "A: My father\u2019s family had a -- what you would call a small department store in Rosslau. They\nwere the only Jewish family in this entire community. In fact my grandmother, my f-father\u2019s\nmother, was also born in this -- in Rosslau, and I have the documents, the birth certificate, and\nthe marriage certificate to my grandfather, also 1-in -- in my files. And apparently he was quite\nsuccessful in that respect, and -- and was continued, I think, until the German -- until the Nazis\ncame to power, and of course ultimately that was all taken away from them.",
        "Q: They were the only Jews in that town?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Huh. So there was no synagogue or community there that --",
        "A: No. No -- not at all.",
        "Q: Were they just full assimilated [indecipherable]",
        "A: Absolute -- I -- I -- I would have to say yes, because I have -- if you look at the birth\ncertificates, and the marriage certificates of both sides of my grandparents, you will find that the\nnames are all traditional German names. M-My father is Ludwig. My elder -- his elder brother\nHugo, my -- hi-his younger brother Hans, the one who was killed, and who I was named af --\nHans. My grandmother was named Rosian, which literally trans -- mean little rose. My -- my\ngrandfather was Max. If you look at his parent\u2019s birth certificates, 1t\u2019s Magnus, which 1s really\nlike a Latin name, and the grandmother, I think was -- great-grand -- was Regina. But this also\napplies to my father\u2019s -- grandmother -- my mother\u2019s grandparents in like manner. So when\npeople say to me, well what Jewish names did they have, I have to be honest and say I don\u2019t\nhonestly know. My mother, for example is Alice, spelled the same way in English as it 1s 1n -- in\n-- in German, except in German it\u2019s a different pronunciation. So the documents which I have\nfinally found among my father\u2019s papers, after a long time, so far I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve sor -- deciphered\nthat they\u2019ve gone back to about 1822, and they\u2019re all -- the Christian names, the first names,\nwere all literally almost -- you could say either they were English or they were German, but\ntotally integrated. And I suspect that that -- the shock of what subsequent happened, they\nprobably couldn\u2019t believe what was taking place.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Your father\u2019s family, you said, had a department store in that time --",
        "A: Well, I would call it a department store in the like manner, and I have seen pictures of it a\nlittle bit.",
        "Q: And your father worked there?",
        "A: No, my father -- my father became a barrister and a judge, moved to Halle, where I was\nultimately born, practiced criminal law. And ironically -- Halle is a very big chemical loca --\narea, even I think to this day. And 1-ironically, which I didn\u2019t realize, he never discussed it, but\nmy mother mentioned it to me, and also my cousin who lives in Australia, whose mother is my\nfather\u2019s -- was my father\u2019s sister, told me that he was also the outside counsel for I.G. Farben, the\nbig German chemical company, which ultimately made the -- the material which was doing the\ngas chambers. Course, this all -- we\u2019re not talking about that particular period, we\u2019re talking in\nthe -- in the 30\u2019s and so forth. So my father had a very successful, an-and according to my\nmother was a very well known criminal barrister 1-in Halle.",
        "Q: And he would have been there through the 20\u2019s?",
        "A: Ah, yes.",
        "Q: An-And then you were born there in 1934?",
        "A: 735.",
        "Q: \u00b035 - ?35. And what about your mother\u2019s family, what business were they in? You said that\nthey were also --",
        "A: My -- my mother\u2019s parents lived, as I mentioned, in -- in Gutentag, which is an interesting\nname because it means good day, or good morning -- in Upper Silesia, almost on the -- on the\nPolish border. My -- she had one brother called Lota, and her father was Ludwig Eisner, and my\ngrandmother, my mother\u2019s mother, was Rosa Eisner. They owned what you would call a farm\nequipment wholesale business. And I have pictures, I found pictures. I have no idea how they\nmanaged to keep these particular pictures, or bring them with them considering all the other\nproblems which they were experiencing. Where my grandfather had -- you could see the trucks\noutside his -- th-the fi -- th-the family business and home, with the telephone number, and on the\ntruck, branded names of things like percil and so forth, even American products. They did farm\nequipment, I would sort of say, you know, which supplied the farming community, which was\npredominantly Polish speaking, although this Upper S-Silesia was of course Germany, and had\nbeen for 150 years or so. And very successful as well.",
        "Q: So let\u2019s start now with -- with -- your father was arrested, I understand, in -- in 1938?",
        "A: Well, actually, he was initial -- he was arrested twice. The first ti -- my fa -- my father\u2019s sister\nemigrated with her husband to Australia as a result of friends which they had who -- who helped\nthem there. And one of the -- also from Germany, also German Jews. And one of the German\nJews had some business things which were required to -- to be handled, and I believe, and this 1s\nonly -- I\u2019m only surmising this, cause we never di -- I only heard this from my mother, my father\ntook over some activities. This was, or been public perhaps early \u201938 or so. And for some reason\nor another, you know, at that time, the -- the German government was already starting to try and\ntake money, or -- and various other things from -- from German -- from German Jews, and their\nbusinesses. And he was arrested and held for six weeks in Halle -- but it was obviously nowhere\nnear anything which subsequently took place -- and was released. And then, I think after Kristall\nnight, which was in the latter part of 1938, my father was arrested and taken to Buchenwald. My\nmother\u2019s father was also arrested and taken to Buchenwald. My father\u2019s -- my mother\u2019s brother,\nLota, was also arrested and taken to Buchenwald. And they found each other there, of all -- I\nmean, most incredible, found each other. All three got out. Now, you have to remember, my\nfather was a first World War veteran, my grandfather, my mother\u2019s mother -- father was also a\nveteran. And I have subsequently read books and documents which indicate that the Germans\nbasically said to some of these people, \u201cBecause of your activities as, you know, in World War I,\nwe're going to let you go. But you have so many days or weeks, and if you are still here in\nGermany, then we -- if when we re-arrest you again, we\u2019ll never -- you\u2019 Il never get out.\u201d So I\nbelieve my father must have got out, probably in early 1939. I don\u2019t know which day, and my\ngrandfather. My Uncle Lota also got out, but I don\u2019t know exactly when, and under what\nconditions, but they did, and I have proof of the fact, perma -- documentation that my father then\napplied for visa to the United States in, I think, February of 1939. So between Kristallnacht and\nentry into Buchenwald, and now it must have been somewhere between that time, and shall we\nsay the end of January, or -- so he was rather lucky to get out at that time.",
        "Q: Let me go back and ask you when your -- your father\u2019s sister left Germany to go to Australia.",
        "A: That would have been somewhere in 1938, I go -- I believe.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] in the same year, then.",
        "A: But before Kristallnacht.",
        "Q: Before?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And it was an escape in a sense, a sense of -- of being unsafe for Jews and the decision to\nleave [indecipherable |",
        "A: Well, I -- yes, I -- I think you\u2019re right, but I think the motivating factor might have come more\nfrom my aunt\u2019s husband, as distinct from other things. My mother has mention -- mentioned to\nme on several occasions as a boy when I asked questions, that I think sometime in \u201938 -- when, I\ndon\u2019t know, I think before Kristallnacht, okay, that the families got together. My father\u2019s family,\nof which really, was really in my grandmother, because my -- my grandfather on my father\u2019s\nside, died in 1929, so th -- you know, none of this would have applied, got together, and sort of\nsaid what we could -- what -- what should we do, because at that time you still, from what I\u2019ve\nbeen given to understand from my mother, you could still take out all your money and\nbelongings without any problems. But they couldn\u2019t come to any conclusion. And you have to\nremember, from my father\u2019s side of the family, it was -- I have the documents to the early 1800\u2019s\nand my father always used to say to me it was even before, you know whe -- they were more\nGerman than the Germans.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay, if you want to put it this way. Now, I don\u2019t th -- I don\u2019t think that that was quite as di --\nas long on my mother\u2019s side of the family, because I understand that from their aspects, my\nmother\u2019s grandfather, m-my gra -- my great-grandfather came from Poland in the days when\nPoland was under Russian law, and rode across the border into Germany, into -- into Silesia.\nBecause in those days the Russians used to call people up for military service, and it wasn\u2019t just\na two year stint, it was 20 years before they were released. So I suspect that they -- his parents,\ngreat-great-grandparents, sort of said you\u2019d better get out and -- and -- and go somewhere else.\nBut, if you follow what I\u2019m getting at, it\u2019s that depth of -- of period. But my parent, when they\nhad the meeting with -- with the two families, obviously couldn\u2019t come to lo -- to a conclusion.\nWe\u2019re sitting here today saying why not? I can\u2019t answer that question.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. [indecipherable] interesting to know what that conversation was like, what the\narguments were [indecipherable]",
        "A: I -- I get the impression from her mother that -- th-the -- the women on the one hand wanted\nto go, and the men -- you have to remember that my father was a very successful barrister, even\nthough things had already declined, I don\u2019t know to what degree how far. Everything which I\nread, where everything is stated, regulations do this, yes it\u2019s true, but things still somehow, how\ndid they manage to survive and live with no income coming in? Because although things were\ntightening, you could still spend money, if you had it.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: And, you know, perhaps they just thought that this was just an aberration.",
        "Q: Yeah. And the women wanted to go, the women were clearer --",
        "A: Well, I understand on my mother\u2019s side, her mother, and my mother wanted to go. My\nfather\u2019s mother was not enthusiastic, but I don\u2019t know that, I\u2019m just giving you comments which\nmy mother said to me.",
        "Q: Right, right. So your father comes home from Buchenwald, do you have any memory of that?",
        "A: No. I can only tell you that my mother went to pick him up, so she must have been notified.\nAnd she had to go by train because Halle to Buchenwald is not, you know, a -- a bus ride. And\nmy mother said that nothing happened to her physically, they were just, you know, they just told\nto go sit in a corner in the -- of the waiting room, or wherever. Of the entrance or whatever it\nwas. Nobody bothered her, but nobody was very -- nobody was terribly polite, but nobody was\nterribly rude, they just said go sit over there, and -- and -- and that was it. And I have to assume\nthat it was done by train. My mother said that, you know, from that day onwards, my father --\nthere were no -- no more argument about leaving. And I have to conclude that -- that my father\nwas too stunned and shattered at what had happened. And even though he\u2019d been four years in\nthe first World War, I have to conclude that there was -- the -- what -- what he saw and\nexperienced in Buchenwald had no comparison to what we read about, what took place in World\nWar I, where it was strictly military and -- and not the other scenarios, but he was on th -- we\nnever discussed that, he -- he -- he could not -- he could not --",
        "Q: Talk about it.",
        "A: No, or he wouldn\u2019t talk about it, let\u2019s put it that way.",
        "Q: Well then, we\u2019re coming close to the time when you -- you and your mother and father, and\nyour grandfather, you mother\u2019s father, left together to go on the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s an interesting aspect, yes. My grandfather, on my -- ma -- my mother\u2019s father,\nhad some relatives who had emigrated to the United States. I think it would have had to be in the\nvery late 18 -- the latter part of the 1800\u2019s. How they got in touch with these relatives, I really\ndon\u2019t know, but they did. And where the exact relationship was I don\u2019t know, because I\nultimately met these people in the United States, and they were the ones who provided the\nsponsorship bond documents. And they couldn\u2019t really explain the exact relationship as to how --\nwhether it was their mother, mother\u2019s mother or so. And as you know, when people went\nthrough Ellis Island, names got changed, or people married each other on the boat, I -- I really\ncan\u2019t te -- I\u2019m sorry, I really can\u2019t tell you how that happened, other than that two of the relatives\n-- and I have [indecipherable] gave me some of the documents, which I didn\u2019t know",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t -- I\u2019ve met them. Years later I met them, and they viewed me as very distant, we\nviewed each other as very distant cousins, but none of us could exactly explain where the\nconnection -- the third person shown on those documents, I have no idea, other than it was\nobviously a very generous individual.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s look at that, as long as we\u2019re talking about it, because we can mention the names on\ntape, because I have those document here as well. This is the one you\u2019re talking about.",
        "A: Yes. Edna Cohn, when I met her was already in her -- I -- either late 60\u2019s or early 70\u2019s and\nwe\u2019re now talking over 30 - 40 years ago, almost -- or -- or longer. Edna was not married, and\napparently she spent her life in -- in a stockbroking -- most of her career in a stockbroking office.\nWhen we met it was in California, not in Chicago, they\u2019d retired for health or weather reasons.\nSamuel Fox was married to Edna Cohn\u2019s sister, Miriam. Samuel Fox was not a relative, or any\nconnection, but he was married to Miriam, and had been a pharmacist in [indecipherable] and --\nand had his own business in Chicago. Aaron Stein, also from Chicago, who is the third affiant\nhere shown in the documents, I don\u2019t know who that is, other than obviously a very generous\nperson. They put up the money for the bonds, which enabled my parents and my grandfather,\nwhere the connection was, Ludwig Eisner to -- to put applications in, and I believe the -- the sort\nof certificates, the -- what do they call them, visa application numbers are the ones shown here as\nwell, for the three of us. This document also shows Ludwig Eisner, which the museum here\ndidn\u2019t know who it was, although it was -- he was listed in all the -- the museum documents. But\nhe happened to be my grandfather, and he\u2019s shown here actually.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, they didn\u2019t know that.",
        "A: And they didn\u2019t know that. They do now.",
        "Q: So these three people put up the money, and --",
        "A: These three people, yeah --",
        "Q: -- presumably had never met your parents?",
        "A: Didn\u2019t even know my parents existed.",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t know they existed until they --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- presumably got a letter from someone, maybe your father.",
        "A: Not my father, would have had to be from my grandfather, because he -- Ludwig Eisner, my\nfather\u2019s father-in-law.",
        "Q: Right. That\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: Yes, and I -- how that ever happened, how they got th -- th -- how they traced each other, I\ndon\u2019t honestly know.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And they didn\u2019t know themselves, when I met them years later. And -- and the re -- the\nrelationship was -- was tremendous. And years later Edna Cohn and her sister Miriam Fox,\nvisited England, and at that time -- to see my parents, and at that time my parents financially\nwere in a position to repay --",
        "Q: The bond.",
        "A: -- the bond. And I have comments -- I have letters in my -- in my father\u2019s papers, which I\nfound in -- in -- really in the last year or so, because where my parents -- my father died six\nweeks short of 93, and my mother subsequently, almost 20 years younger, died two ye -- in\n2001, at 91 and a half. So you imagine, I had almost a hundred years worth of com --\namalgamated documents to look through, that which had survived, and so forth. And I found\nletters which Edna Cohn [indecipherable] written to my father in England, to sort of say -- they\nwere still sending them some money, not to worry about that, so I imagine that must have\ndepressed my father considerably.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: But they were able to repay that.",
        "Q: They pa -- have repaid the bond, how much was it?",
        "A: Pve no idea.",
        "Q: Yeah. Interesting.",
        "A: I -- in -- in terms of -- of today\u2019s currency, I don\u2019t know what the cost, the Holocaust Museum\nprobably, would know what a bond for a visa -- I mean, it was a standard, I would imagine, a\nstandard visa bond. What it was, I don\u2019t really know, translated into 2004 currency valuations\ntoday, I would imagine is -- might be somewhat more expensive, I don\u2019t know. But it was very\ngenerous of them. And if 1t hadn\u2019t been for them, we probably wouldn\u2019t have been sitting here.",

        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with John\nMeyerstein. This is tape one, side B. So tell me now what you know about the -- the decision to\nleave, and the purchase of the ticket, if you know anything at all.",
        "A: Okay. I don\u2019t know a great deal of how it was done. I can only conclude from my mother\u2019s\ncomments, that the moment my father was released from Buchenwald, and them -- and 1-in -- in\nsimilar manner, I suspect, although probably not on the same day, my grandm -- my mother\u2019s\nfath -- my grandfather on my mother\u2019s side. They didn\u2019t really have much choice about leaving,\nbecause that which I\u2019ve read in more recent times would indicate that they were probably told\nyou have a minimum period of time, and if we find you again, you have to go. We\u2019re -- we\u2019re --\nwe'll arrest you and -- and you\u2019ll never be let out again. How they got tickets on the St. Louis,\nwho organized that, and in what manner, I don\u2019t know. I do know that my parents -- and this is\nonly what my mother told me, that they already knew that they would have to leave, even though\nmy father and my grandfather were in Buchenwald, something would have to be done, or\nimmediately after Buchenwald. And my grandmother -- my -- on my mother\u2019s side, came down\nfrom Gutentag, presumably to Halle, and they went -- they bought things, including jewelry,\nwhich they sewed -- from what I\u2019m told, stitched into furnitu -- into the furniture, cause in those\ndays, and this is where the anomaly is so incredible is, you could take everything that you had, or\nyou could buy it. So they took two complete containers, which I would be -- the equivalent of\nsay -- I don\u2019t know what a container in those days would be viewed. Today, two con -- small\ncontainers would be 20 foot containers, which I gather was furniture, stove, fridge, whatever. In\nfact, \u2019ve often wondered about it, and said to my mother, why on earth would you take electrical\nappliances, that don\u2019t apply when we ended up in -- in -- in England, and -- and so forth. Clo --\neverything which they had. And these all came on board the -- the St. Louis with us. We never\ngot them at the end, but I mean, that -- that\u2019s a different story, and we can get to that in due\ncourse. How they did that, I don\u2019t know. I think the jewelry, and it was viewed as being a\ndangerous thing, but they didn\u2019t think that people would -- the -- the Germans would be tearing\nopen the -- the -- the -- the furniture and so forth. They might check your clothing, but they\nwouldn\u2019t do anything else. And that was -- they hope would, if they got to wherever they were\ngoing, they could then sell those things and which -- provide some money. Because as you know,\nwhen we left on the St. Louis, I think -- I don\u2019t know what the amount was, probably, you know,\nfive or six U.S. dollars at that time -- or I don\u2019t know, not much more. So in other words, you\nhad money when you -- before you left the ga -- the dockside, you climbed on the St. Louis, and\nyou had nothing left at the time, so we -- we had no money on -- on that. Everything had already\nbeen paid for on the St. Louis. But how that actually happened, I really don\u2019t know. At th -- it\nwas never explained to me, and I -- I\u2019ve asked my -- I have some cousins in Australia from my\nmother\u2019s side, and they don\u2019t know. They know even less than I do.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Do you have any memory of the ship?",
        "A: Not a great deal. I -- I gather that I was apparently -- I got lost on -- it was -- it was like a\nluxury liner. Perhaps the word luxury\u2019s a bit too strong, but it was -- it was a very pleasant cruise\nship. It was like -- for b -- I -- a-again, and it\u2019s not something that my parents discussed with me,\nbut what I\u2019ve subly read is, you know, it was used for -- people would, in better times, go on\nholiday. And apparently I -- I got lost somewhere, and that caused a great panic for my mother,\nand then they found me, or my grandfather found me, and with no problem. But that\u2019s about the\nonly thing I can remember. I\u2019ve got one or two pictures, but they really aren\u2019t -- three or four,\nthat you wouldn\u2019t know it\u2019s the St. Louis, it -- a-and they\u2019re not in groups of people, and quite\nfrankly, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t have a big recollection on that.",
        "Q: Did your parents take those photographs? Do you know?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not convinced that they did. I think my father -- I think my father was too\nstunned.",
        "Q: Stunned, yeah.",
        "A: I ga -- the pictures which I have, and there are only about two or three, I can see a cor -- wh-\nwhe -- when -- when people were taken to Buchenwald, s -- as I understand it, you know, it was\nlike a -- you know, it was already -- it wasn\u2019t a death camp as they subsequent became, but it was\nalready a death camp, so everybody got shaved. And I -- and when we -- the pictures on the St.\nLouis with my father, you can see his hair growing back again, but he looked still, quite gaunt.\nMy grandfather was always bald, and so you can\u2019t tell from those pictures. And of course,\nthey\u2019re all dressed again in -- in clothes and suits and ties and so forth. But you can see in my\nfather\u2019s picture, at least I can, perhaps to me, th-the trauma of what had happened, and I\u2019m not so\nsure that he took them. He -- he -- for years he didn\u2019t want to be photographed, and whether that\nwas a reminder of the way these things happen, I don\u2019t know. Even in better times, you know.\nBut I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t think so. He wouldn\u2019t be standing around. He -- he was not the -- he\nwas not an outward going person. My mother was, he was more reserved. Perhaps it related to\nhis profession, perhaps it related to his -- he was a 19\" century person, having been born before\nthe turn of the century. And I -- I -- he once said to me that, you know, he -- he didn\u2019t like the\n20\" century at all, which of course is understandable. He was much more comfortable in -- in\nthat era. And wit -- wi -- reflects itself in the -- the relationship which we had together. It actually\nchanged a little bit when we had grandchildren -- when I had grandchildren, which of course he\nalways used to say to me he never thought he would have because he was so much older in that\nrespect. And he lived long enough to s -- to see my eldest daughter go to university, which of\ncourse was a great thing for him.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So the -- the stories that you may have from the voyage, are all things that your\nmother --",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: -- and par -- and father --",
        "A: No, my father discus --",
        "Q: No -- not your father.",
        "A: -- scussed not a single thing. No, we could never talk on those matters, and my mother asked\nme not to. I tried once as a -- as a mid-teenager, and my father started to get emotionally very\nupset. And my mother came in the room, and -- and saw what was happening, gathered what was\nhappening, and just pulled me to one side and said, don\u2019t ask, and stop it, and I said I\u2019m sorry,\nand he calmed down and that was the end. We could talk on other matters, prior to 1933. Now,\nthe -- the horrendous things didn\u2019t really affect -- didn\u2019t happen till somewhat later, but in\nlooking back it\u2019s that period which he -- obviously he could not look. But he ca -- but as time --\nas the years went by, he mellowed -- not that we could talk about these things, whereas my\nmother still retained the emotional problems which I suspect she experienced having to wi --\nwatch this in a more active role than I did, as a small boy.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. So the -- whatever stories then are from your mother, from the\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Entirely from -- entirely answers to questions which I posed over a few -- period of few -- of a\nfew years. Now, in England, when we had -- and we can come to that later, but in England,\nwhere we ultimately ended up at, there again was not a Jewish community per se, and there were\nalso a few other German refugees. Mostly women whose husbands had -- had -- had been left\nbehind, or couldn\u2019t get out, and they got together -- and because my mother was -- I was a small\nboy, and you -- you know, the days of leaving with babysitters was unheard of, so I was always\ncarted around, and then put in a corner and given a book to read. So I would sometimes hear\nsome of these things which they would talk about. And -- and of course all these things also got\nplayed out, so it was comments as a result, and further comments, and answers to questions\nwhich my mother gave, among a group of three or four other ladies, some a little bit older, with\nno children, but in the same sort of situation.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. So what -- what stories do you have of the voyage itself, that in --",
        "A: My mother told me -- well, apparently up to the -- up to the arrival in Cuba, it was -- 1t was\nvery -- seemed to be very pleasant, in fact unbelievably, I mean, not that she said that, but when\nyou read the background, you have to really question yourself. Here they are forced out of a\ncountry, and suddenly being, you know, provided with -- with -- with a staff, you know, waiters\nand everything else, at beck and call, considering what was taking place. But I think a great deal,\nfrom what I\u2019ve read, or what I\u2019ve heard, would indicate that the captain of the St. Louis was an\nextremely decent individual, and determined to -- he was determined to -- to have this as if there\nwas no -- no animosity against anybody in particular. And I believe the -- the Israeli government\nhonored him with a -- with a -- with a medal after the war, and I\u2019ve also read that as a result of\nhis activities, he was relieved of command when the St. Louis ultimately returned empty in -- in -\n- to Germany. Never given another command, although he was a career naval officer from World\nWar I days. But he was left alone, which 1s always again, you do -- you\u2019d have thought he\u2019d have\nbeen put on trial for being decent to Jews. That did not happen. So I think a lot the -- the -- the\nway the -- the -- the staff and the crew of the St. Louis conducted themselves, probably in my -- I\ncan only surmise, was the way the captain felt they should handle themselves. So I think the\nvoyage to Cuba probably was very pleasant. The voyage back from Cuba was not so pleasant.\nMy -- my mother told me that things started to go downhill emotionally for people. And I -- I\ndon\u2019t know the name, I can\u2019t recall the name of it, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s listed somewhere, there was one\nperson who threw himself overboard in -- off the St. Louis in -- in -- in the harbor. I think, you\nknow, t-trying to commit suicide, you know. And my mother knew the wi -- or had met the wife\nof -- of that ba -- if -- 1f -- if my memory is correct. Ya -- people talked among themselves\nsometimes, but to what degree I don\u2019t know. On the voyage back, they apparently had to have\ncommittees, which were -- the captain requested the men to form, if they were willing, various\ncommittees which would -- which would sort of patrol the decks, certainly during the night, or\nduring the day and night, to avoid people from trying to commit suicide, and my father -- my\nmother told me that my father was -- was a member of one of these committees. I don\u2019t know\nwhat my grandfather, whether he was that way. It\u2019s just that she responded, or she mentioned\nthat to me, because there was serious -- a -- a serious thought by various people that others would\nperhaps do this. Whether that\u2019s right or wrong I don\u2019t know, actually. I\u2019m not aware that\nanybody did do it, but there was that particular feeling. And of course there must have been, and\nI suspect, although my mother didn\u2019t mention it, a tremendous apprehension as to what was\ngoing to happen, because if the ship really returned to Hamburg again, then -- or wherever we\nsailed, the re -- the results would have been extremely dire.",
        "Q: Sure. An-Anything else from the time in Havana, or --",
        "A: Well, we were never in Havana --",
        "Q: Right, I know, in the harbor.",
        "A: You know, in the harbor.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether the passengers at the time knew what was taking place, and I -- I-I\u2019ve\ngot to be careful here now in how I respond to you, because I could be making comments about\nwhat I\u2019ve read.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: My understanding is that the Jewish relief agency in -- in the s -- in the United States was\ntrying to negotiate --",
        "Q: Release.",
        "A: -- the -- with -- with the mexi -- with the Cuban authorities, or the Cuban president, because I\n-- | gather -- and this is only what I\u2019ve read, is that the -- the entry certificates were not signed by\nthe president, but they were signed by Benito, if that\u2019s the -- o-or whoever was the immigration\nminister, and were already ada -- you know, illegal documents, before we ever sailed.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Okay. And I don\u2019t know whether -- what would have happened if people had known that. I\u2019ve\nalso read that one or two passengers, who had tickets, Jewish passengers, never believed these\ntickets were valid from the Hamburg American line, and went to the Cuban authorities in Berlin\nor whatever, and got landing visas separately, on their own, before they ever doc -- you know,\nboarded the ship. And the -- and th-these were people who were, in fact, allowed to land. But\nhow far that\u2019s accurate, I don\u2019t know. I suspect -- I can only cou -- my mother certainly had no\nidea, and I could never ask my father, that, you know, they were not going to be -- and all I\u2019ve --\nto be allowed to land, and all I\u2019ve heard is that there were negotiations on -- whether they knew\nthat, on board, I don\u2019t know. The vessel cruised up and down the -- the eastern seaboard. And I\nthink that was done deliberately by the captain from what I\u2019ve read, in the hope that something\nwould materialize. I gather it was really a negotiating tactic, with the -- again from what the --\nwhat I\u2019ve read or seen published, and that the -- the then president of the -- of Cuba couldn\u2019t --\nwouldn\u2019t -- you know, wanted more money and there was a negotiating thing, and then suddenly\nthe negotiation dropped down.",

        "Q: -- did you mother mention that?",
        "A: -- my mother did mention that, yeah. It was close enough to do that, yes. But I presume that\nhad to be on a clear night.",

That\u2019s about all I\ncan -- she didn\u2019t discuss that in great deal -- and I have to be honest and say I don\u2019t think I ever\nasked her what did you do all day long.",

I have to assume that my parents perhaps made a point of\nnot discussing these satter -- these matters in the evening or with myself in -- present, you know?\nOtherwise, perhaps I might have remembered that.",

        "A: No --",
        "Q: -- about where they would get off.",
        "A: -- what happened was, from what my mother told me is, when the ship docked, I think it was\nAntwerp, or we -- perhaps it happened before Antwerp. My mother indicated to me that -- that\ntables were set up on the deck of the St. Louis, everybody but -- now then, at that juncture, knew\nthat there were a number of countries in Europe, western Europe who were going to -- to take.\nMy understanding was -- a th -- and my mother said to me there were tables set out. You know,\ntable to England, table to France, table to Holland, takin -- table to Belgium, or whatever it was.\nAnd that you could -- you know, it wasn\u2019t a lottery where names were put into a hat. My mother\nsaid to me that she perhaps, without ra -- you know, thinking and -- about it, said that she might\nhave been tempted, if it had been her choice, to try to go to France, because as a young teenager,\nher father had sent her with her brother to do a tour of Europe in the summertime. Lucky for\nthem, they had the money to do it, and that she\u2019d gone to France, and she\u2019d gone to Italy, you\nknow, as a young teenager, perhaps in her seven -- at the age of 17 or 18, and because of that --\nand she\u2019d learned French at school, not English [indecipherable] that that would have been,\nbecause she\u2019d been there once or so, it would have been nice. My father, apparently, paid\nabsolutely no attention to this, and walked to the English table, and sign up, for which there was\nnot a -- initially, not a big demand. Now, my father could speak a little bit English. He made a\nlife and death decision, either comprehending a little bit of what might happen, because war talk\nwas already in the air, you have to remember. We\u2019re talking now beginning of June, okay, and\nwar didn\u2019t -- took place in September.",
        "Q: September.",
        "A: Okay. Perhaps -- and I\u2019ve often pondered about this myself, m-my -- my mother certainly\ncouldn\u2019t give me an answer. And I thought myself, perhaps my father, from his four years in\nmilitary experience, thought that perhaps being -- th-the 20 miles of channel might be some\ndiversion. I don\u2019t really know. He made that decision, and obviously not one in which he was\nforced to do it, but voluntarily. And it was a life and death decision. So we then ended up in th-\nthe -- in Antwerp, okay. The St. Louis didn\u2019t take us to England, another vessel took us, called\nthe Rocosus, if I am not mistaken. My parents belongings, in these two containers and everything\nelse, were offloaded from the St. Louis, the Hamburg American line, and dumped on the\ndockside. The Rocosus -- and I don\u2019t -- and obviously was not -- I don\u2019t know, it was not a\nHamburg American line, or it didn\u2019t matter, wouldn\u2019t load them onto the boat to Southampton,\nthey demanded money. And my parents, or my father had absolutely no money. And so these\ncontainers remained behind. So other than our cabin luggage, which was put on board, all these\nthings, and I just have often pondered what my parents thoughts were, seeing these, and knowing\nwhat was in there --",
        "Q: And the jewelry that she had sewn in --",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s what my mother told me, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Which would have helped. And having no ability to -- to do anything, must have caused my\nfather even bigger depression, I suspect, you know, or stunned silence. We\u2019ve -- I was able to\ntalk to my mother about this years later, and we just hope that if they were left there, that\nultimately they got bombed. If they were taken to Germany when the Germans marched into\nAntwerp, and they were put into some German storage houses, hopefully they got damaged and\nburned, because they would never have known what they were sitting on. You know?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So I -- I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re laughing about -- this wasn\u2019t a laughing matter, I don\u2019t doubt, at\nthe time.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sure, yeah.",
        "A: And then we took the boat to Southampton. We arrived in Southampton as far as I\nunderstand, and were taken by train. And this is really memory -- not really such accurate\nmemory other -- you know, I\u2019ve read about this. And we arrived in London. And we at -- we\nended up in as -- the four of us -- I\u2019m including my grandfather now, Grandfather Eisner, my\nmother\u2019s father, were put up either in a two, or three, and I really don\u2019t know -- certainly not\nmore -- upstairs in a house, 1n a -- 1n a -- in an area of London called Camden town. The only\nthing which I really remember about this is that directly opposite the front of the house was a\nsmall park on the other side of the street, and that I -- my parents allowed me, or I was able to\nplay there. It -- it was in summertime, we arrived in June -- all the time. And I think that\u2019s where\nI learned my English. Very quickly, because when -- children have that ability, I think, 1f you\nfollow what I\u2019m getting at.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And obviously my parents were in no mood to sort of say to me, let\u2019s go sightseeing, let\u2019s do\n-- I\u2019m sure they -- I don\u2019t know why. So I was able to play there, and that\u2019s a recollection which\nI have, obviously a pleasant one. And I have to conclude that that\u2019s where I learned English, and\nm-my -- my mother has said to me that within about four or six weeks, I was fortunate enough --\nand I then began to act as an interpreter --",
        "Q: For them.",
        "A: -- for them, you know. Not with understanding, but to respond to the English questions an --\nand so forth, if required, if required. I don\u2019t know who really paid the rent, or provided my\nparents with funds, or my grandfather. My mother alway -- I -- I\u2019m aware that the Jewish relief\nagency would -- did -- did provide some funds, but my mother always spoke very highly of\nQuakers in -- in -- in England, and liberals. Now, when I say liberals, I don\u2019t think she meant it\nin the -- a political context, you know, liberal being democrat or -- or -- or whatever. I think she\nmeant liberal in the sense that there were decent liberal people who felt that yo -- that either part\nof their life was to be -- certainly not Jews, I -- I -- you know, the Jewish relief agency was doing\none thing, Quakers obviously were -- were not Jewish. I think she meant decent liberal people\nwho felt a -- a sense of -- of -- of desire to help people who were in less fortunate circumstances.\nAnd she always talked very highly of that, and they provided some means, but to what -- what\nextent I don\u2019t know. But the Quaker thing, my mother always spoke extremely highly of.",
        "Q: What do you know about your father\u2019s being taken to the Isle of Man, your father and your\ngrandfather?",
        "A: Oh, okay. Well, I think I have to go a little bit -- back a little bit.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We were all together until war was declared --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I-In September. You may be aware of the fact that after the war was declared, the -- the -- the\neng -- British government made a suggestion that children in -- living in the London area might\nwish, depending upon their parents, to be boarded int -- more into the countryside. Be -- I\nsuppose they assumed that London was going to be a target area. And they also said that mothers\ncould go with them if they wanted to. Now how that was conveyed to my parents, I don\u2019t know,\nbut that\u2019s what happened to us. My mother and I went on one of these trains, together with other\npeople re -- other ordinary people from lon -- from the London area. Nothing connected with\nJews or Germans in any shape or form. And I don\u2019t know exactly when, whether it was the end\nof the year, or the beginning of 1940, we ended up in a place called Bedford, which is 50 miles\nnorth of London. And we remained there ever si -- you know, my parents remained there ever\nsince. Now, I don\u2019t know when my father and my grandfather -- they weren\u2019t -- they never said\nthey were arrested, they were interned. It was not like a German arrest, and it was not\nspecifically geared to Jews. It -- all aliens. German aliens, and other ali -- I mean, other aliens,\nAustrian aliens, all connected with -- with Germany, were immediately rounded up, for want of a\nbetter word. Some went to the Isle of Man, some went somewhere else. My father, and I believe\nmy grandfather, went to the Isle of Man. In what particular month or -- or period, I\u2019m not\nabsolutely sure. It must have been -- I\u2019m -- perhaps end of sep -- end of 39, perhaps early \u00b040.",
        "Q: You\u2019re not certain that your grandfather went --",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t -- I kno -- he was there, but I don\u2019t know in what period of time.",
        "Q: Your grandfather?",
        "A: They were both together, interned there.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And I\u2019m not sure that they all turned up released. It was not over but -- for my father and my\ngrandfather, I -- I get the impression it was not a long internment. And that\u2019s the one thing which\nmy father, he never referred to it as an arrest. He was able to comment to me about that, and he\nsaid it was really like being in a barracks in the military, and I think he was trying to compare it\nto World War I. And he never spoke ill of that situation, and I suspect if you compare it to what\nhappened in Buchenwald, there were -- you know, there was no comparison whatsoever. I\u2019m\nsure they were interviewed, perhaps several times, and I\u2019m sure there must have been other\nGerman aliens, who may well have been German spies, who lived in England for many years, o-\nor what have you, and they had to be weeded out. But I don\u2019t recall my grandfather or my father\never mentioning anything of what you would call an ill nature. And, you know, the -- the fact\nthat they were sleeping in a barracks or -- or being interviewed, it was not in any shape and form,\nfrom what I gather, similar to what would have happened, or did happen in Buchenwald, and\nwhat subsequently happened.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So I never -- and they certainly when I came out, there was no -- it didn\u2019t look -- you know, I\nmean obviously it\u2019s like being in an army camp, but it wasn\u2019t in any other way. And ultimately\nthey both joined us in Bedford. When, I don\u2019t know, and where they came together, I don\u2019t -- I\ncan\u2019t really recall. If it was 1940, then I was already five. And in those days, you went to school\nat the age of five in England. So my concern -- my ma -- mother\u2019s concern wasn\u2019t getting me off\n-- off to school -- and you have to remember, by this time I was speaking English already, and it\nwas not a long distance away, but again my mother spoke that the Quakers in Bedford, it was not\na Jewish --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: Okay, this is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with John Meyerstein,\nconducted by Nina Ellis on July first, 2004, in Washington, D.C.. This is tape number two, side\nA. So we\u2019re in -- it\u2019s 1940 now. Your mother and you are living in Bedford.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And presumably sometime your father and grandfather come back during that year.",
        "A: Yes, yeah, I don\u2019t know exactly what -- when that year. The one thing which is interesting,\nthe -- the -- the -- the German air raids on Britain at that time, had re-really started, and I\nremember my mother had a school friend, somewhat older. I used to call her Aunt Margot. She\nwas not married, but she was more like a sister to my -- in other words they were school friends,\nbut the relationship was almost like sisters, okay. And she had fa -- I can\u2019t tell you how, but she\ngot to London on her own, and she was living in London, and my mother apparently contacted\nher and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come and live in Bedford? You can get a job in Bedford. And --\nand come stay with me.\u201d I think my mother was worried, you know, with the air raids, and\nnightly bombing, my father not there, my grandfather not being there. And so Margot Lewin,\nwho had a brother in New York, and was also, I think, hoping to get a visa to the States, which\nultimately came through, but not until World War II was -- was over, and so forth, said all right,\napparently, and -- and came to Bedford, and very shortly got a job in a major manufacturing\ncompany, an ironwork company in Bedford, as a secretary. She obviously knew enough English\nto be able to do these things. And she actually lived with us, and we all lived in one room. And I\nthink it made my mother feel a little bit more safe and secure. I would call her Aunt Margot, you\nknow, and she really became more of an aunt than a real aunt would have been, if you follow\nwhat I\u2019m getting at. And you know, we had nightly bombing raids at -- you know, sometimes\ntwo or three times during the night, and ri -- my mother -- my -- and we were living on the top\nfloor of a -- of a building, of -- of a three story ap -- house, okay? And my mother -- you know,\nyou get very tired when you have to get up and dress and all the rest of these things. And my\nmother said to me -- said to us, and I think it was a general agreement, not bu -- I mean, they\ndidn\u2019t ask for my approval, I was -- that they weren\u2019t going to get up any more. If it was -- if -- I\nthink my mother said if it was God\u2019s will the bomb was going to go down, it won\u2019t make any\ndifference if we\u2019re upstairs or down in the cellar. It\u2019s going to take us all.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So we ended up just sleeping through all this, not getting up any more. And we would be\nwoken up by the air raid warning to say that this was -- the -- the planes were coming, or the all\nclear siren, when they were all gone. But, you know, we just didn\u2019t get up any more. My -- my\nmother just made that decision, she said ge -- you kill yourself, I think -- or we will -- we will --\nwe will die out of sheer exhaustion, you know, or I don\u2019t know quite, you know, how it\u2019s --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- anyway, they stayed -- they were -- they were there together, and if fact I visited my aunt in\nNew York -- not -- she\u2019s not my real aunt --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- but if you understand what I mean, many years later, as -- as a married person, when I was\nalready married, and she in fact -- and I then brought her from New York in -- in -- in a car. I had\na business ve -- trip, and I drove to New York for that specifically, picked her up from her\napartment, drove her back to Canada, to Toronto. She stayed with us for two or three weeks, and\nthen we put her on a plane back to -- to New York.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And you know, she was -- she was the type of aunt that, you know, if I needed pocket money,\nshe was the one I would turn to. And years later, when I was in the army overseas, after I was\ndrafted in England, she would write to me, and whenever she wrote, she would always put some\nmoney in from New York. So I was exchanging dollars. And she would always put some money\nin it -- she didn\u2019t have any sons or daughters --",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: -- 1f you understand what I mean.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: She only had nieces, and -- and to her I was really her nephew in that context.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: She was that close to my mother, you see.",
        "Q: To your mother, right. That must have been a great comfort to your mother, to have a\ncompanion, sure.",
        "A: I think so. And it was a gr -- and -- and you know, it was very nice. She was the type of aunt\nwho was the accommodating type, in the sense that she made no demands on me. If anybody\nmade any demands, it was me on her. And -- and she was always obliging with -- with -- with so\nforth, so I have my -- my memories of her were -- were -- were very good. Then my father was\nreleased from the Isle of Man, and at that juncture we obviously couldn\u2019t live together. And then\nwe -- we then moved to another --",
        "Q: Because you didn\u2019t have enough space?",
        "A: No, well, we were in one room, and w -- and my -- and -- and my mother\u2019s school friend --",
        "Q: Was there.",
        "A: -- was there. So we had to move, and it was -- and we needed a bit more space, or wer -- we --\nyou know, the landlady was not exactly the greatest. I -- I don\u2019t -- she was a -- she had a temper,\nI don\u2019t mean that she was anti-Jewish, I think she was just a -- not a very accommodating person.\nShe rented rooms out to various other people. And I remember my telling how that one of the --\nthere was an old man living on one of the rooms, and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t take any attention to Mrs.\nMorgan, she\u2019s just naturally irritable.\u201d You know? So it wasn\u2019t anything -- if -- if you understand\nme, it wasn\u2019t anything bi -- against that.",
        "Q: Personal, yeah.",
        "A: She was just making money renting out rooms, okay. And -- but I think the rooms were -- bu -\n- that money came in from either the Quakers, or other liberal people in the -- in -- in Bedford, in\nthe sense of decent people, actually, until such time. And then at some point, and I don\u2019t know\nwhen, probably sometime in the 40\u2019s, my father came to Bedford, was released, so did my\ngrandfather. We -- my mother made arrangements to move to another place where the three of us\ncould be together, not far away from where we were staying. My -- she also made arrangements\nfor my f -- grandfather to have a room by himself somewhere, in another house. And Aunt\nMargot, quote, unquote, also got a room for herself, and we went, and we progressed from there.\nMy father then got a job. The one thing which I have always found very interesting is that we --\nmy parents did not, neither my father, my mother, or my grandfather, particularly after they ki --\nwere released from -- from the Isle of Man were not request -- did not have to go to the police\nstation daily or weekly or monthly in any shape or form. And I gather that that was a -- I -- I\ncould be wrong, but I read somewhere years later, that that was a decision made by Prime\nMinister Churchill to say, look, if we\u2019ve checked these people out, let\u2019s not create a problem.\nWe\u2019ve got more important things to do than worry about having people go -- but whether that\u2019s\naccurate or not, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But I\u2019m not aware that my parents or my father, or my grandfather had to report on a regular\nbasis to the police. And we were left alone. Nobody ever bothered us. Nobody ever bothered us.\nIn fact, it -- you -- it was perhaps typical English, you\u2019ve got your freedom, you\u2019re on your own\nnow. Which I found rather interesting in today\u2019s context, where immigrants in various countries,\nwhen they arrive, want -- make demands on all sorts of things. We were just only too happy. I\u2019m\nsure my parents, you know, depressed, stunned, whatever, but they were left alone.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: They did not have to worry about being knocked up in the middle of the night by a police\nwatrant or -- or what have you.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And I think that -- I know from my father\u2019s point of view, that that impressed him, years later.\nWe didn\u2019t actually talk about that, but I think he -- he -- his indication was that that -- that was\nsomething which made him, I suspect, feel a little bit better.",
        "Q: Yeah, I --",
        "A: He was left alone.",
        "Q: -- my guess though, is that for a while -- 1t would take you a while to relax, and even though\nyou were in a safe community, to feel secure, especially after what he\u2019d been through. Even\nthough nobody was --",
        "A: I think this is --",
        "Q: -- bothering him.",
        "A: I think you\u2019re right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But it must -- yeah, let me -- I can -- Pll give you a very funny situation [indecipherable] I\nthink you -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s germane to what you\u2019ve just said. We were 50 miles from London, and on\n-- On occasion some -- during the war years, we would take the train to London, my mother and\nI, my father was working, just for a day\u2019s outing. I mean here I\u2019m still at school. I remember we\nwere walking down -- this is quite clear to me -- walking down Oxford Street, which is like Fifth\nAvenue in New York. It\u2019s a bustling community, you know? It wasn\u2019t exactly empty of people,\neven in war time. And suddenly we saw, what my mother explained to me, an extremely\nOrthodox, pious Jew, with a beard and a hat, and I mean, the complete regalia. And my mother\nstopped to look around, and I had to stop and she said, \u201cLook at that.\u201d And the only people\nstopping to look were my mother and myself, and I said, \u201cWell, what is it?\u201d And she said, \u201cBut,\nthat\u2019s an Orthodox Jew.\u201d And I didn\u2019t quite know what she meant at that time. Well I think\nafterwards, years later my -- I -- we talked about this, my mother and I, is that it was so\nincredible, nobody paid the slightest attention. It was not an unnatural event. They -- people just\nall were passing back -- my mother thought it was so unnatural in the -- in the context of what\nshe\u2019d left, to see this. For me, I didn\u2019t really think about this until years later, when I began to\nunderstand what she really meant. But I remember her saying to me, \u201cThat\u2019s a very Orthodox\nJew.\u201d But I think she, a-as I say, she was wondering whether people would accost him, or -- or\naffront him, or something. But he just walked on, and nobody paid the slightest attention, other\nthan ourselves.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know. And other people must have looked at us to see [indecipherable] why were we\nturning to -- looking at somebody else?",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: So that, I think, in answer to your comment, perhaps was the thing which may ult -- may have\nmade my father -- my father never read a German newspaper any more. He only read an English\nnewspaper. We talked in English and German, and as the years went by, we talked more English.\nMy father never wrote a letter to me, other than in English. Neither did my mother. Mind you,\nyou have to remember I couldn\u2019t, if they\u2019d have written a letter in German I couldn\u2019t have read\nit, because until I went to school years later, where -- where I had an option of learning -- I had\nto do French, but I also had an option of doing another foreign language, so I took German, but it\nwas just school reading and writing. And that just -- that\u2019s how it -- you know, my parents never\ntalked to me --",
        "Q: It\u2019s pretty remarkable that, I mean, your father was in his late 30\u2019s, almost 40 years old by\nthen.",
        "A: No, when -- in that period of time, my father was born in 1893 --",
        "Q: \u00b093.",
        "A: -- so we\u2019re talking let\u2019s say, in --",
        "Q: He was almost 50 years old.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I was a small boy, I mean, he could have had a grandson by that time.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And to -- you know, to turn away from his native language at that age is quite remarkable.",
        "A: Well, yea -- this is a little bit off -- off the thing, but I think it\u2019s -- again it\u2019s -- it\u2019s relevant to\nyour question. Years later, when I had -- I made a business trip many years later to Germany --\non bus -- you know, to -- for the business discussions. And I thought, well Ill bring him back a\ndecent German newspaper, me -- meaning a quality pa -- newspaper. And I\u2019Il -- and I sat in\n[indecipherable] bookstore, a book in German, which related to the -- to the period prior to\nWorld War I, and I bought it, thinking that he would like it. He barely scanned the paper. He\nlooked at the book. I still have the book, I don\u2019t have the paper, but I still have the book. And he\nlooked at the book and the pictures. I think the title of the book was sort of, you know, Germany,\npre-World War I days, you know, of how people lived and so forth, which he would have\nunderstood. He scanned it, put it awa -- he never read a German book, you know, he -- it was all\nEnglish books, history and everything else. And he -- that was a period he -- I don\u2019t mean that he\nphysically thought about it, and wi -- and made a -- an effort to show people, it just that he did\nnot pay attention any more. He didn\u2019t listen to German newscasts on the BBC, it was always in\nEnglish. Of course his English continued to improve, as you can appreciate, but as far as he was\nconcerned England for him was, I suppose the equivalent of heaven at that moment.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: In relationship to what he\u2019d experienced, because nobody ever bothered. They didn\u2019t ask.\nEnglish people generally, bit more reserved, so didn\u2019t ask questions. And he wasn\u2019t the type to\nwant to answer, so he was just left alone. They thought he was a very nice person, he was\ncourteous and pleasant, but he wasn\u2019t forced to express himself to anybody. I think that made a\nmajor difference.",
        "Q: What kind of work did he get when he get when he -- when he [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, he couldn\u2019t practice law because English common law, like American common law has\nabsolutely no relationship to German law, so he could never practice his profession, and I think\nhe was too old to -- to start all over again. You have to remember he\u2019d been a judge, and he\u2019d\nbeen a barrister. And there was no relationship, and w -- and we didn\u2019t have the funds, anyway.\nAnd -- and so he took a job in a factory, and you know, he -- but really, I suppose any job, you\nknow, beggars can\u2019t be choosers, to put food on the table, and pay the rent, and -- and -- and so\nforth, and th -- perhaps the one thing which one can say is that whilst he was free to do what he\nwanted, or was free to -- to live quietly, with nobody bothering him in England, that didn\u2019t mean\nthat the English government was going to help him get a job.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Did your parents have much of a social life? Were friends over, or visiting other people, or --",
        "A: We lived in a one bedr -- one bedroom apartment with a little -- with one gas ring. You don\u2019t\nhave people coming over, if you understand what I mean. We\u2019d had money. For a long time we\nwere -- my mother never had to do this, of course, but I can still remember -- 1n fact, after my\nmother died, and I went through her personal effects, I found the book -- she used to buy little --\nlittle booklets, you know, and inside she daily jotted what she had bought in terms of groceries or\nso forth, because she had to make sure that we had enough money for rent and so forth. She\ncouldn\u2019t stop herself afterwards, even when -- when it wasn\u2019t necessary. They -- it didn\u2019t say \u2019'm\ndoing this. They [indecipherable] no, you know, I mean, it wasn\u2019t exactly a happy thing when I\nwent through these things. I -- I understood what she was about.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And if I asked for any money, she\u2019d have to look through her purse and then check the book,\nand -- and say so forth, so no, we didn\u2019t have -- yeah, people might come for a -- an hour or so,\nmy -- my grandfather would come and -- and -- and so forth. But he didn\u2019t have very much, and\nso my mother -- my mother had to go out to work as well, to do housecleaning for people.\nMainly because t-to bring some money in. And my f -- my grandfather couldn\u2019t work, he was too\nold, or it wasn\u2019t possible. His English was not that good, so she would provide -- give him\nmoney for -- he was -- he smoked cigarettes an-and -- and -- and so forth, but we didn\u2019t -- to\nanswer your question in a nutshell, did we have a social life? No. I think my mother, she knew\nmore people as a result of my going to school, because she met other mothers in the process. But\nthat wasn\u2019t what you would call a social --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- although those -- those -- those acquaintanceships continued for many years, if you\nunderstand what I\u2019m getting at, but they were not really what you would call -- where people\nwould socialize, invite each other. We didn\u2019t have the funds and -- and m-my father certainly w-\nwould not have -- he was -- he was too -- he was what I would call today in a clinical depression.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That\u2019s quite understandable.",
        "A: Yeah, and I think that that went -- I didn\u2019t realize that until many years later, until I was an\nadult, and even then, it wasn\u2019t until I got much older that I -- I -- I begin to thi -- thought about\nthis, and understand now. He went into depressions at weekends more than during the week. And\nthere were several times a -- I -- I rather think that my mother thought that he was going to try to\ncommit suicide.",
        "Q: Oh boy.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t. But he would leave the house on a Saturday morning sometimes, you know, he\nworked from Monday to Friday. He\u2019d get up in the morning, no breakfast -- this didn\u2019t happen\nall the time, there were -- it was like a sort of periods, for no reason, and you have to remember\nhis brother was still there, his mother was there. His -- his sister was in Australia, so that was\nokay. And he would go away. Now, we lived in a town where there was a -- a -- a river, was a\nvery nice little country town, bit like Alexandria down the road, but a little bit broader, with\nbridge and a major river running down, where every summer they\u2019d have a huge regatta, and still\ndo to this day. Think it was the third biggest regatta in -- in England, and every year. And it was\nsort of three miles on one side of the embankment, we\u2019d call it, and three miles on the other. And\nin summertime it was very nice, with benches down there, and I -- I can remember they used to\nhave a -- a bandstand, and you know, they\u2019d play military marches. I mean, that was to keep\npeople\u2019s spirits up, you know? And he\u2019d go out, and come four o\u2019clock, or so, 3:30, my mother\ndidn\u2019t know where he was. I don\u2019t know why sh -- the population was what, between 50 and\n80,000. Still really not much more than 80 or 90,000 to this day. It\u2019s the -- it\u2019s the county town of\n-- of Bedfordshire. And I don\u2019t know where my -- where my mother got the idea that I would\nfind him, and I didn\u2019t know where to look, but perhaps it oc -- I don\u2019t know why, it occurred to\nme on -- once, that perhaps he might want to go and sit down on the -- on the bench, and perhaps\nthat -- I didn\u2019t know where to go, up and down streets, you know, [indecipherable] find -- and\nsure enough I found him there. He\u2019d generally sit there on a bench. He would just be sitting\nalone. And I\u2019d come up, and he still wouldn\u2019t talk, and I'd say, well it\u2019s time for -- for supper,\nyou know, for dinner, or supper or something like that. Mom said it\u2019s ready, you -- and he -- we -\n- we got up and walked, but we didn\u2019t talk. That happened on several occasions. I don\u2019t mean, ru\n-- you know, every other month. That happened on several occasions over a period of about --\nperhaps between nine and 11 or so. And several, I don\u2019t mean a huge amount, perhaps two or\nthree or four times.",
        "Q: But over time, enough for you to --",
        "A: But that actually would da -- yeah -- no --",
        "Q: -- understand that was going on for [indecipherable] period of time.",
        "A: -- I didn\u2019t really quite know, no, I just thought my father was a moody individual --",
        "Q: Yeah, at the time you wouldn\u2019t know.",
        "A: -- I mean, I -- I realize, of course, it wasn\u2019t actually.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But that gradually eased to the point that eventually that never happened any more.",
        "Q: What was it like for you in school? Did you have any particular trouble in school, or --",
        "A: Yeah, the first school I went to was like a -- like a typical public school here, you know, grade\none, two. Two -- I think grade -- grade one we went in at five, and then at age 10 you went onto a\n-- what would be the middle school, or something like that, okay. Yeah, I did, but it wasn\u2019t an\nanti-Jewish thing, it was because of my na -- m-my German surname. I mean, John was,\neverybody understood that, and I\u2019d occasionally get called, you know, German sausage or\nsomething like that, you know, but I mean these things happen. And you know, there was a time\nwhen I was probably having a fistfight, but not because it was anti-Jewish. I\u2019d reached a point\nwhere I wasn\u2019t going to take this, or couldn\u2019t take this any longer. And you know how kids are,\nthey can bully. Now you ha -- you -- you either come to a conclusion that you have to -- you\nhave to face this up, and -- and I never discussed this with my parents, you know. There wasn\u2019t\nmuch point, my father was working, my mother was working, he was going to, you know --",
        "Q: What are they going to do, right.",
        "A: -- and but you know, there was a -- there was a period where I sort of had regular fights, but it\nwas -- but I wasn\u2019t the only one having these, these characters were doing this with other kids\nthat -- you know, for whatever reasons. And it reached a point where ultimately, I must have\nobviously defended myself on my own sufficiently, that you become friends with the bully, and\nyears later we would say hello to each other. You know, bullies, when they get taken on straight\nin, and not backing off as well, they go to the -- to the weakest. I think it was really a choice of\neither taking a -- a whacking each time, or having to try and see if you could defend yourself,\nand I -- I -- I -- I\u2019ve told my wife this, I had to know I -- whether I -- whether I hit and bit and\nkicked to the point where they didn\u2019t want that happening, and gradually, over a period of time,\nth-that was left alone. That didn\u2019t continue indefinitely. But it was no -- I suppose a bit\nunderstandable. Meyerstein, that\u2019s a German name, German sausage, you know?",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: You know, not a Jewish thing, because you know I don\u2019t recall having that -- that --",
        "Q: Right, right. You mentioned earlier that while your father was at the Isle of Man, and you and\nyour mother and your mother\u2019s friend were there in Bedford, living on the third floor, did bombs\never drop in your neighborhood?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: They did?",
        "A: They did. When we moved -- when we moved to -- you have to remember this 1s not a big --\nBedford was not a big town. Lewton, which was 20 miles away, was the home of General\nMotors, okay, but Bedford was the hub of a -- had a major railway station, it was a hub area for a\nlot of trains coming in and out, and I think they were always trying -- and about 20 minute -- 15\nminutes away by car, was the intake for all the RAF -- Air Force personnel, entering the -- the\nRAF, you know, if you understand what I\u2019m getting at. So there were --",
        "Q: Targets.",
        "A: Targets. And sometimes, of course the -- the -- the air raid warnings would come on if they\nheard planes flying overhead, even if they were not been a target, Bedford. And there was one\noccasion, not when we were on the third floor, but when we were on the second floor m -- of my\n-- just before my father came to join us, I -- I think, cause that\u2019s the time we would have moved\nthere, there was one really major bombing raid, and they were obviously going for the railway\ntracks. And the landlady and my mother, and I -- and this wasn\u2019t a big house, all got up and --\nand we went into the living room, and you know, they had these old antique dining tables, round\ndining tables, you know, solid, you would probably need six people to lift them. And I remember\nmy mother pushing me under the table, and she and the landlady got underneath, because the fe -\n- the -- the -- I think the feeling was, if the ceiling was coming in, the table was thick enough,\nand heavy enough to absorb this. But nothing happened, other than the house shook. But there\nwere time -- but you know, you get used to it. You know, I don\u2019t say that that\u2019s a great way of\ngetting used to things --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- but we got used to -- you can\u2019t panic, that\u2019s -- what can you do?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And there were one or two occasions when I would walk to school. In fact, my daughters both\ncalled me at the time after 9-11 [indecipherable] and they were living there in the States, and said\nto me, \u201cDad, what happened when you were a youngster?\u201d You know, and I said, \u201cWell, I went\nto school.\u201d And I said, you know, Grandma was working, Granddad was working, and I was\ncloser to school than anywhere else, what was I going to do to get home, I couldn\u2019t have got in\nanyway. I didn\u2019t have a f -- a key. So I just ran on to school, but I mean, what can you do? You\nknow, they\u2019re high up in the sky, you know. For youngsters sometimes that\u2019s -- it\u2019s a bit of an\nadventure. I -- I don\u2019t mean to demean that, your question or answer.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: This didn\u2019t happen every day. But, I mean, you get used to it. What could I do anyway?",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Ya -- you -- I think people have to le -- do learn to control panic now, obviously some people\nma -- take 1t more seriously than anything else. But this wasn\u2019t a daily occurrence.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But people do -- it was a war time, that\u2019s why when I mentioned it, I thought my father was\nvery heavily depressed. In today\u2019s context, that would probably be referred to for di -- for\nmedical reasons. You have to remember Britain was the only country left in Europe, alone, and a\n-- a -- America didn\u2019t come into World War II until \u201941, after Pearl Harbor. And that was\ntowards the end of \u201941.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So, you know, people didn\u2019t have time to worry about were you depressed or --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- or worried. They had far more worries on their mind. I know that my mother -- if anything,\nmy mother\u2019s worry, where we stayed. W-We lived in this place that she -- the landlady was very\npleasant. Her name -- Mrs. Duncan, I remember her name. And she had a -- her son was a pilot\nflying Mosquito bombers over Germany, and my mother was always terribly afraid that if\nsomething happened to him, Mrs. Duncan would turn on my mother, you know, he didn\u2019t, you\nknow. I -- I don\u2019t know [indecipherable] she was very concerned. But I remember one day -- my\nmother told me this, and I would have been, well, around six, yeah. One day my mother was at\nhome, and there was a knock on the door, and a young army officer bi -- was at the door, and my\nmother opened the door, and he saluted her and said, you know, \u201cIs Mrs. Duncan in? Mrs.\nDuncan?\u201d And my mother said, \u201cShe\u2019s not in.\u201d And he said, \u201cOh, could you tell her, I\u2019m her\nnephew.\u201d You know, also in the military, but in the army side, you know? Saluted her, and wal --\nand said, di -- \u201cWould you let her know I passed by, I\u2019m on leave,\u201d or something like that. \u201cShe\nknows where I am.\u201d And [indecipherable] for my mother to understand. But I think my mother\ncould never get over the fact that, you know, if it had been a German officer, he would have sort\nof kicked the door, or -- or I don\u2019t know whether -- what she assumed.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s just she couldn\u2019t understand the courtesy with which --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- she was wi -- she was treated, you see. No, so that was a sample of little -- little memories\nof -- of -- of which I have.",
        "Q: Right. Do y --",
        "A: They both survived, and I met them years later as I was growing up a little bit, actually, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Oh. Do you have any r-recollection of the end of the war? V-E day?",
        "A: Well I -- no, my rec -- not really, you know my recollections of D-Day were greater --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- because when you look -- well, for the simple reason that when you went to school -- and\nwhe -- when I got up in the morning, there was a mass -- and looked out the window, we\ncouldn\u2019t help it, the planes were enor -- constantly, the sky was full of planes, so everybody\nknew something was happening. That, to me, was far more -- far more -- you know, I mean, the\nplace was dark with planes, all going in one direction.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. So, yo -- and -- and I bet that you -- your father probably followed that very\nclosely in the papers, and I\u2019m sure everybody did --",
        "A: Mm, yes, yeah.",
        "Q: -- at that -- at then -- in those times it was quite -- quite momentous for everyone.",
        "A: Yes, I think he did, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I -- I would imagine so. We didn\u2019t discuss it, I don\u2019t recall that -- I -- th-the one thing which,\nagain, which is interesting in the context of how one views refugees today, when we arrived in\nEngland, they -- and I have these documents still, or booklets, wa -- they -- I don\u2019t know whether\nwh -- whether the Jewish agency gave them out, or whatever. They just said to the -- to th --\neverybody got them, and I found them just recently, that, you know, don\u2019t congregate together --\nand they\u2019re in engla -- in English, but to -- I think to German refugees in particular, don\u2019t\ncongregate together, don\u2019t speak loudly, don\u2019t speak in German. Keep -- keep your head down,\nand -- and -- and pay attention to what\u2019s going on, and -- and go about things, and do your work,\nand -- and don\u2019t get in a -- don\u2019t create problems. And I be -- perhaps I\u2019m a little cynical, and I\nview other refugees, you know, wh-who come to other countries and almost demand -- perhaps\nan exaggeration, but expect things to be handed over. My parents didn\u2019t expect anything.\nSometimes I wonder, when I look at this and say to myself, you know, we were [indecipherable]\nthey did what -- they did that, they -- they kept away from public -- you know, they wouldn\u2019t\nhave gone out in the streets to celebrate, because first of all, with accents, they would have had to\nexplain themselves, they were just probably thankful.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But that didn\u2019t really mean very much.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Because at that juncture, my father probably wouldn\u2019t have known what happened to my\nfather -- to my mother -- to his mother, and to his brother. No idea, you see. Although we had\nRed Cross letters from my grandmother, up to 1942.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And -- but he had no idea, he -- in 1939, when we --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to ask you to start again with the telegram.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with John\nMeyerstein, this is tape two, side B. You -- you were mentioning --",
        "A: In 1939, from what I understand, from what my mother told me, my father received a\ntelegram from his -- from his brother Hugo, presumably in ger -- in Germany, I -- I\u2019m not -- I\nassume so, or from somewhere, saying can you do anything to help me? He was married, no\nchildren. Well, my father had no money, and no influence, no way -- and wouldn\u2019t have known\nwhere to turn, let alone anything else. So presumably that cable never got answered. I don\u2019t\nknow where the cable is, I\u2019ve never seen it -- you know, I\u2019ve not found it among the papers.",
        "Q: It must have been a heartbreaking thing for your father.",
        "A: Exactly. The other thing, of course, you have to understand is that my father had the problems\nof his mother and his brother. My mother and my grandfather had the problems of the\ngrandmother, you know, my mother\u2019s mother.",
        "Q: She was still there, she was still there.",
        "A: My f -- my mother\u2019s brother, Lota Eisner was also at Buchenwald, also got out, and we met\neach other in London before the war started. And he, for some reason or other, got a permit to go\nto Palestine. How it happened, I\u2019ve no idea, he never explained it to me. We met years later and\nhe -- I -- I\u2019ve spoken to his children, my cousins, they don\u2019t know how. And he went to\nPalestine, and ended up in the British army, joined the British army. My m -- the -- I -- my\nmother tells me that the reason -- or told me the reason that her mother didn\u2019t leave was that he\nhadn\u2019t left before we\u2019d left. So she was concerned that her only son would be left behind, so she\nwasn\u2019t going to go, so she put -- forced my f -- ha -- my grandfather to go with us, but she wou --\ndidn\u2019t come. I don\u2019t know, it -- it -- it\u2019s a strange story, okay?",
        "Q: It is interesting, yeah.",
        "A: And I\u2019Il include this to you because I think you\u2019re going to find this rather interesting. She\nwas left behind, but her son got out before the World War. Well --",
        "Q: Right, say -- say her name again.",
        "A: Her name was Rosa Eisner, okay?",
        "Q: Right, Rosa Eisner.",
        "A: She\u2019s in Gutentag, still in her own home, hadn\u2019t been confiscated or anything, you know.\nNow war was declared in \u201939. We were all out, she was alone. That must have been a real\nproblem for my father -- for my mother, and for my grandfather, with no means to do anything\nany more. Pondering, I suppose, and no communication, as far as I know. She got out on a vessel\nwhich sailed from the Baltic during the war. When exactly, I don\u2019t quite know. I don\u2019t know the\nname of it, I know it\u2019s in the Holocaust -- Holocaust Museum, people know about it. It sailed,\nand ultimately ended up with all refugees, the place was packed to the gunwales, I gather, with\nrefugees. I don\u2019t know who the skipper was, it was not a -- I don\u2019t know, from some -- I don\u2019t\nknow. Anyway -- or how the crew was hired, or what have you. It was like a tramp vessel, I\nsuspect. It ended up in Haifa waters. They didn\u2019t want to let it enter, so the vessel blew it itself\nup. My grandm -- mother was on deck when they blew it up, had no idea this was going to\nhappen, they didn\u2019t tell anybody. I mean, that th-the -- the Jews decided it\u2019s the only way they\u2019re\ngoing to have to get ashore. So they blew itself up, the vessel started to sink, or capsize. My --\nmy grandmother told my mother, and my mother told me, they -- and even my cousins don\u2019t\nknow the full story. My grandmother was thrown overboard. She was on deck luckily, not below\ndeck or anywhere. And couldn\u2019t swim, and the cable, as the ship was turning over, cable came\ndown -- you know, these things don\u2019t happen in seconds, and she hung onto this, and you know,\nof course, as soon as the vessel blew itself up, the military all came out to pick everybody up,\nyou know. Picked her up, you know, and picked up the survivors or something, and put them\ninto a military barracks. God knows how -- I don\u2019t know, she said my name is so and so, I have a\nson who is in Palestine. They checked the records, found he was in the British army, contacted\nhim, and said get here, is this your mother? He goes down to the barracks as his -- my mother\nexplained, to where they were all interned. I mean, it\u2019s like a barracks, I mean, with clothing and\nstuff like that. And he says, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s my mother.\u201d And they said, \u201cTake your mother and go,\nand don\u2019t come back.\u201d",
        "Q: Unbelievable.",
        "A: Yeah. So that\u2019s another story, so we all survived, in that context, except my grandmother on\nmy father\u2019s side, and my father\u2019s brother, you know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But that\u2019s a different story altogether.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we didn\u2019t discover that until years later. My cousins, to this day, don\u2019t quite know how\nthis happened. Now, why my grandmother left, and this is perhaps an even stran -- equally story,\nthey were in Gutentag. It was a predominantly Catholic community, not a big community,\nGutentag was not a big -- you would hardly find it on the map, and I don\u2019t know what the Polish\nname is now. The -- a very rural farming community, which 1s why I think my grandfather must\nhave -- or his father actually started the business, this --",
        "Q: Farm implement.",
        "A: -- farm implement, you know, which grew into quite a sizable establishment. And everybody\nspoke Polish. The farming -- th-the Poles, although they were German -- born on German soil,\nstill predominantly ethnic Poles, okay. I think Silesia was taken by the ger -- Prussia in 17 --\nmiddle of the 1700\u2019s or so. Anyway, predominantly Catholic. My mother\u2019s there -- my\ngrandmother\u2019s there alone, as my mother -- mother explained to me, and the Catholic priest --\nthere\u2019s a na -- come -- in the middle of winter, and I don\u2019t quite know when, \u201840 perhaps.\n[indecipherable] must have been, perhaps \u201840, I presume. Yeah, would have been -- would have\nhad to be \u201840. Ag -- dub -- my -- as I understand it, and this is what my mother [indecipherable]\nit, there was a knock on the back door, and you can -- must have been after dark. So you can\nimagine that must have been a major shock to my grandmother, you know, in the -- to get a\nknock -- it\u2019s bad enough to get a knock on the front door, but to get a knock on the back door.\nShe opens the back door, and it\u2019s the parish priest. He comes in, they\u2019re all in darkness. He says,\n\u201cDon\u2019t put on the lights.\u201d And says, \u201cYou know, the Gestapo is coming tomorrow morning t- to\narrest you, or to pick you up.\u201d He had obviously heard this from either his parishioners, or some\nwho were in -- who were Catholics, but were in the Gestapo or whatever. Ye -- ye -- there were\nGermans there as well, but it was a predominantly Catholic community, okay. And you -- you\nbetter be going. Yo -- I suggest you -- you -- you\u2019re not here.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And -- and don\u2019t le -- when -- and they talked for a few more minutes I presume, or for\nwhatever period of time, and then he left again by the back door. Apparently then -- no lights on,\nyou know. So apparently she -- it was in wintertime, so she got on -- a-as my mother explains it,\nshe dressed in my father -- grandfather\u2019s trousers, heavy sweater and everything else. It\u2019s snow\non the ground. And -- and in those days people had th -- what they call rucksacks, what we call\nthese little --",
        "Q: Backpacks.",
        "A: Backpacks, actually. As much as she could pack together, take whatever she could\n[indecipherable] documents, money, whatever she may have had, and in the middle of the night,\nwalked away.",
        "Q: Geez. Geez. Alone, she\u2019d been alone. My goodness. Would you like to take a break? Yeah\n[break] Artev --",
        "A: Okay.",

        "A: Yes.",

        "A: No -- well, not -- not in a different way. I -- I can give you a better an -- a -- a different a-\nanswer to that. M-My father\u2019s main concern was to make sure that -- always was I would have\nthe best education he could possibly provide, which was pretty limited in those days because we\ndidn\u2019t have the money. Now, Bedford had a -- was a small community of between 50 and 80,000\npeople, and it\u2019s not much more than 80,000 or 90 at the most today. But it had a reputation for\nhaving the two -- in England they call them public schools, but they\u2019re like private schools, of\nthe Ivy League type, and two girl\u2019s schools like this, and a convent, which went up to university\nlevel. And many people sent children as boarding children to these schools, because of the\neducational -- Bedford had a reputation for having an excellent educational system, a private\neducational system. And my father, having no money, nevertheless, wanted to see if he could do\nthe same -- give me that -- or give me that opportunity, and went to see the headmaster, or the\nprincipal of one of these two boys public schools, there were no girls, I mean, they\u2019re separate\nactually. These are both Anglican, high Anglican schools, if you understand high Anglican in\nthat context.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The principal was in fact, an Anglican priest, but a teacher as a career, but had -- but had also\nbeen a -- had also become a priest. And my father had a private interview with him, I understand,\nexplained the circumstances. The principal said, send your boy in. If he takes a test like anybody\nelse and passes it, we -- it would -- it\u2019s -- 1t wa -- 1t was one of these schools which had a great\nalumni, which --",
        "Q: Endowment.",
        "A: -- yeah, and it was a 400 year old school. I passed the exam, which I don\u2019t think was that high\na standard, nevertheless, and at the age of 10 in 1940 -- in -- 11 in 1946, I entered the school. I\nused to walk to school every day, I was a day boy, and the school never sent a bill.",
        "Q: Wow. What was the name of the school?",
        "A: The school was called Bedford Modern School. It was first chartered in, I think, 1566 by then\nLord Mayor of London, who had been born in Bedford. The school still inherits the -- the rents\nfrom the land which this former Lord Mayor endowed to the school, together, so that\u2019s where\nthey get all these -- you know, the o -- the -- plus the -- the other alumni scenario, and not a word\nwas ever mentioned or raised.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And nobody was dis -- it was never discussed in the school, and --",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t singled out in any way?",
        "A: Never singled out in any way.",
        "Q: Hm. Fabulous.",
        "A: And I think there were about -- in total about two or three other Jewish boys at the school. If\nyou -- if you did not want to attend an-and that was the type of school where it still does, I think.\nWell, I\u2019m not sure whether it does it any more now. The school had about a thousand -- between\n700 and a thousand boys at all time. Every morning at nine o\u2019clock, the hall was filled with a --\nthis is really -- and you'll find this interesting -- was filled with the boys and the masters. Th-The\n-- the headmaster, the principal, would walk with cap and gown, everybody [indecipherable]\nmasters in caps and gown, would walk through the center of the hall, and the whole school\nwould ri -- ri -- stand up bec -- in -- in courtesy to the headmaster, and he would go up on the\ndais, and then there would be a small reading, and a small two or three minute sermon, some\ndiscussions, and a prayer which act -- ironically was always interdenominational, it didn\u2019t really\nhave any great things, and then it\u2019s [indecipherable] been, you know, after that was done --",

There was -- you\nknow, we -- and nobody ever attempted to proselytize, or to try and convert, 1t was just --\nbecame a matter of courtesy that we all attended. And -- and I mean, nobody knew who was\nwho.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: If you understand what I mean.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I\u2019ve gone back, visited the school from time to -- I mean, 1n odd years over the years,\nand -- and -- and they\u2019ve told me that they sometimes find parents who -- who\u2019ve come in and\nsaid -- cause now the fees have gone up much higher than they are a -- and I said, \u201cWhat happens\nif parents can\u2019t meet the fees?\u201d You know, and he said well, we\u2019ve had some [indecipherable]\none of the bursars in the school, not now any more, but about 10 years ago was in my class. And\nhe, for some reason decided that he\u2019d continue to do these things. We -- so we knew each other\non first name terms. And he said to me, well, he said, that\u2019s actually happened, with this\ndownsizing, rightsizing, outsizing thing in the late -- in the 80\u2019s, early 90\u2019s, and so forth. And he\nsaid, but we -- we just told parents the endowment will take care of that until such time as you\u2019re\nin a position to. So the school still continues that.",
        "Q: Has that tradition, that\u2019s wonderful.",
        "A: Yeah, as a tradition.",
        "Q: I say high Anglican, only because the -- the -- the principal was a high Anglican, a -- a -- you\nknow, a priest. And he\u2019s the one, when you got to the last two years of school, he -- he -- w-we --\nthey -- they had the what they would call Divinity class, 40 minutes once a week. But his -- and I\ndid attend it, and we all did. It wasn\u2019t a religious conversion, it was a discussion of religious\nphilosophy. And each student in a class had to -- in -- in alphabetical order, had to take the notes\nso that they could be -- and they would have to stand up and -- and repeat that the following\nweek to the principal, the headmaster, to bring him up to date as to what had been discussed the\nlast time. Did you understand what I\u2019m getting at?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And it became -- so if I had to do it, there was somebody else there the next week, that --\nsitting next to me, taking, making sure -- they would have to stand up and take the notes.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And you had to do that -- 1t was his Divinity course, but 1t was really courses in religious\nethics for 40 minutes once a week.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Years later, when he retired, I came back. My parents were living in England, I was married,\nalready had a daughter, and I was working overseas and was a member of the Rotary club. And\nfor some reason or another my -- I met somebody from the school who was in fact involved in\nthe Rotary club. And the priest of another parish on this little outskirts of the town, who had also\nbeen to -- to the school, but much earlier than I, but who was the person in charge of getting\nspeakers, somehow or another was given my name, and wrote me a little note, and said, \u201cWould\nyou mind speaking? You -- I -- we understand you\u2019re working overseas, could you -- would you\nlike to talk on this one?\u201d And so I said yes, and he said, \u201cOh, by the way, the Reverent J.E.\nTaylor,\u201d you know, he\u2019s retired, he\u2019s your -- your -- your headmaster, you know, \u201che is a\nmember of our club, and he has volunteered to introduce you.\u201d",
        "Q: Oh, how great. That\u2019s great, yeah.",
        "A: And the -- what was even more interesting is they had the local member of Parliament for\nBedford, turned up that day, who happened to be the former -- former Churchill -- former Prime\nMinister Churchill\u2019s son-in-law, and of course I ended up getting preference. He sat, you know,\non one side, but th -- they weren\u2019t -- this -- they weren\u2019t there -- he wasn\u2019t there to give them a\nspeech --",
        "Q: Right, right.",

        "Q: Interesting, interesting.",
        "A: You know.",
        "Q: Huh. Yeah. You graduated from there?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: In the -- in 19 fo -- I -- I graduated in 19 fift -- I went to school in \u201946, to this particular school\nI told you about, graduated in 1953. In 1948, my father became a British citizen, my parents\nbecame British citizens. Because my father became a British citizen, that automatically made me\na British citizen, I did not have to apply, I was a minor, did not have to apply, okay. But on the\ndocuments, I became. That meant that at the age of 17, I had to register for draft. Now, in\nEngland in those days, the draft continued I think until some time of the 60\u2019s. Britain was in the\nsame boat as America is now. Whenever there was a call to do something, they had to send\ntroops. And in -- at the age of 17, it was published in the newspapers that in alphabetical order,\ndates and so and so, and you went to the nearest manpower office, and you registered, okay. And\nyou s -- you explained where you were, what you were doing, were you at school, when did you\nanticipate leaving school, did you plan to go on early -- to further studies? If so, when and how.\nAnd you had to do this, it was a mandatory call up for all males between the ages of 17 and a\nhalf and 35. Now you could have deferments, but you couldn\u2019t get out of it unless you were a\nConscientious Objector, okay. And then you had to -- you would have had to go before a\ntribunal, and that whilst -- they wouldn\u2019t have let you off, but you could have [indecipherable]\naway for that. So at the age of 17 and a half, as I say, I -- I had to register. And I never finished\nmy last day at school, because at my last day of school, I went to a -- I took the train to another\nbalan -- 40 minutes away to another community, where I was -- I\u2019d been sent documents, this for\nmy medical exam, because I had mentioned that I would leave in -- in July 19 -- or I -- I -- in --\nin ju -- in -- in 1953 I would be leaving school, and I\u2019d made the decision not to -- to -- to do the\ncall up earlier than later, not really understanding the consequences of I --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- about what that would really mean. So I never finished the last day of school. Did the call\nup, where you have an interview, and they ask you what you\u2019d like to do, would you like to go in\nthe army, would you like to go in the navy, would you like to go in the air force, and I said,\n\u201cWell Pll -- I'd like to go in the army.\u201d I think really because my grandfather, on both sides, my\nfather, his brothers, my uncle, all been in the army, so I -- 1t was -- it was like it was like a\ntradition. It was now my turn.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I said army, and the fellow said to me, the -- the interviewing officer, obviously a retired\nserving officer, said, \u201cMo -- any -- any particular preference?\u201d And I still remember this, and I\nlaugh about it. I must have been quite arrogant in [indecipherable] days, and I said I\u2019m here -- I\nam now, you know, it -- I'd -- I\u2019d turned 18 now, understand. I said, \u201cI'd like to go in the\nIntelligence Corps.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, why would you like to,\u201d -- you know, \u201cwhat makes you\nsay the Intelligence Corps?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I studied Latin and French at school, and I\nthought I was pretty good, you know. And he nodded, and didn\u2019t say anything. And you know, a\nfew days -- a couple -- two or three weeks later, I get a letter and it says report to the follow -- to\nthe infantry unit in my -- in my hometown. You know, which -- so obviously, if I had said\ninfantry, I might have got into the Intelligence Corps --",
        "Q: Intelligence.",
        "A: -- but here, that\u2019s how the military sometimes worked. It didn\u2019t matter, okay. My mother was\nnot terribly happy about this. My fa -- and -- and -- and mention this, and said she was going to\ncall -- you have to remember my parents are now British citizens, and sa -- so my mother said\nshe was going to -- didn\u2019t like this one bit, because it was a pretty sure thing -- I wa --\n[indecipherable] it was pretty -- there was a good likelihood that I\u2019d be sent overseas. You know,\nBritain was involved in -- in -- in Germany, Middle East, the communist uprisings in -- in -- 1n --\nin Malaya at that time, which was British territory. The Korean war, you know, where Britain\nhad, as is normal these days, when America calls --",
        "Q: Britain follows.",
        "A: Britain usually ca -- Britain usually accedes, and sends in troops as well. Quite a strange,\nremarkable situation. Painful for a lot of people, no doubt, I don\u2019t -- I expect, but 1t seems to be\nthat way, and was then. But it was Britain really in the major role, and not quite the other way\naround.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So my mother, I think, was very concerned, and said she was going to call the Member of\nParliament. Now, I don\u2019t know whether she meant that, or whether she really was trying to\nexpress her irritation. I remember my f -- I remember my father just looking at her and saying,\nthat\u2019s end of conversation. You know, in this family we don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t talk like that, you\nknow. Really -- I mean, you know, it\u2019s the first time I actually heard my father talk to my mother\n-- if they talked like that together, it wasn\u2019t in my presence, that\u2019s the first time I heard my -- I\nheard my father being quite curt about this thing. And sure enough, of course, what happened,\nmuch to my mother\u2019s horror, I suspect, I did my si -- infantry training, and before I knew what\nwas happening, they\u2019d sent me on three weeks embarkation leave, and -- to -- to join another\nadjacent battalion -- infantry battalion in another county next door. You know, it\u2019s like\n[indecipherable] Alexandria to -- to something, you know, else. Wa -- you\u2019re on your way to\nKorea, this bat -- battalion had been chosen to -- to go to Korea. You know, all people below 18\nstep back. I remember we -- I came back from weekend leave and we had a morning parade, step\nback, you -- you are not going, all those 18 and above, pick up your three week embarkation\nleaves, and sign your -- sign your -- to the effect that if you are late from -- from -- from three\nweeks leave, you are no longer classified as absent [indecipherable] if you\u2019re late, you\u2019re\nclassified as a deserter, because you\u2019re going overseas as a battalion, and b-by the way, before\nyou leave today, sign your -- all of you sign your wills. [indecipherable] you know. So here am I\nat the age of 18, signing a will, which I didn\u2019t have anything sign on, but I think it\u2019s done for\npension, or if something should happen you know.",
        "Q: Sure, sure.",
        "A: And I come home, and I tell my parents [indecipherable] you know, and I\u2019m on three weeks\nembarkation leave, you know. Well, there was nothing they could do about that. On the morning\nwhich we left, I got up early. My father wa -- bef -- we had breakfast together, and then he went\nto work, but we shook hands. And his only comment to me -- he didn\u2019t hug -- we didn\u2019t hug each\nother, it wasn\u2019t -- that wasn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t his --",
        "Q: Style, yeah.",
        "A: Style. We shook hands, and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t do anything to dishonor our name.\u201d",
        "Q: Oh. We can stop for a second.",
        "A: And we shook hands, and I say, my father said, you know, don\u2019t do anything to ho -- dishonor\nour name, and off he went to work. My mother came to the -- decided she\u2019d come to the railway\nstation with me, f -- on the way back to camp, and she gave me a small plaque, with the 10\ncommandments. And now she was very qui -- I think she -- she got more religious as time went\nby, and -- and I think she just said, \u201cThis is going to take care of you.\u201d",
        "Q: Huh.",
        "A: Now, I don\u2019t quite know wha -- why. And she said, \u201cYou take it.\u201d So I put it in my wallet,\nand obviously it did take care of me.",
        "Q: Yeah. Which leads me to ask, in all those years, or even -- even before they left Germany,\nwere -- your parents did not live in a Jewish community, but were they religious?",
        "A: I think -- let me put it this way, I don\u2019t know how religious my father really was in Germany.\nTh -- in Halle there was a germ -- a Jewish community, with a jewi -- with a synagogue.",
        "Q: Did they attend?",
        "A: I f -- I -- I think they did.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I -- I think they did. But how -- how, you know, religious they -- they were, I honestly can\u2019t\ntell you.",
        "Q: But it wasn\u2019t something that was discussed regularly --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- so if they were, it was -- they kept it to themselves, or between themselves.",
        "A: No, I won\u2019t say that, it\u2019s just that my father was not what you would call a religious person to\ndiscuss religion.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: You know. I -- I don\u2019t know, at -- it yo -- it\u2019s an interesting question. He and I never\ndiscussed religion.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So then there\u2019s no way to know, in a sense, what kind of impact this whole\nexperience had on his belief.",
        "A: I initially thought, for a long time, that his belief -- that he\u2019d gone the other way. That, in\nother words, he just didn\u2019t believe in anything any more.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And sometimes I had the feeling that he did things because my mother was a little bit more\nkeen and enthusiastic, and that in order to stop grumbles, he -- he went along with things. He did\nnot attend a lot of -- in the early stages -- you know, it was a small -- there were about half a\ndozen, my memory of there were about half a dozen English Jewish people living in Bedford,\nwhere we g -- where I grew up. Most of them, I think, had been born in London. They were\nEnglish -- born in England. My mother -- we would go to the services, they were usually held in\nsomebody\u2019s house, at the -- at -- two or three times in the year, okay. And I did have a Bar\nMitzvah, but it was in somebody\u2019s house, cause there\u2019s no synagogue, there was no Jewish\ncommunity, and there isn\u2019t to this day.",
        "Q: Was there a rabbi?",
        "A: They would try and get hold of a rabbi, I believe, from London. If not, then whoever was\nmost conversant and fluent, might take the service, if you follow what I\u2019m getting --",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: During the war, there were -- my mother and I would go to these things. My father was\nworking, and he couldn\u2019t afford to take off the time.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was too important, 1t was just, you know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know. So it wasn\u2019t a very big -- 1t was not a big thing. And the other -- in fact, the --\nthere were several other -- I think I mentioned this to you, there were several other Jewish\nrefugees. I recall perhaps one or two who were quite elderly, and there were some -- three or four\nladies, women, who were married, but whose husbands weren\u2019t -- and who husbands never got --\ncame out, and -- and were killed, unfortunately, in the death camps. And as a result, they, to\nsome degree, adopted me, if you -- if you follow what I\u2019m getting at. You know, they would -- I\nwant to say that they were all -- I became -- they were all mothers, but they looked upon me --\nthey would always ask, where is -- where is John, or where is Johnny, you know. You know,\nthese ladies -- these women lived in -- by themselves in rooms. Some had to work -- they all had\nto work, but they try -- you know, they -- I -- I think they all came from reasonably well-to-do\ncircumstances. Nobody really asked anybody to --\nEnd of Tape Two Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with John\nMeyerstein. This is tape three, side A. These women?",
        "A: Yeah, these women, and yo -- as I say, you can count the numbers who I can remember,\nbarely on the fingers of, you know, two hands. And perhaps the ones I\u2019m thinking about, not\neven that many. And they remained in Bedford long after the war was over, and they would\nalways ask my mother, you know -- an-and I can remember sometimes meeting for a cup of tea\nin downtown Bedford, you know, in a restaurant or a caf\u00e9 or something, even during the war\nyears, th-th -- two or three would get together, and I\u2019d come along, and so how\u2019s John, or how\u2019s\nJohnny, and -- and so forth. And -- so they, in their own way, I suspect, were almost adopting me\nwithout saying so. And I don\u2019t mean that in any, you know, affect -- loving way, but just -- 1t was\n-- to them, that meant something. And another thing which I thought was rather interesting was\nthat the moment I was called into the military service, my parent\u2019s stock went up in the world.\nPeople sa -- if -- you have to remember, I grew up in -- in the ca -- in a place -- in England, in a -\n- in a-- ina community, particularly after World War II -- now we\u2019re talking for -- World War II\nfinished in \u201946 -- \u00b045, I\u2019m talking now \u201953, I-I\u2019m on a -- IJ-I\u2019m in the army on a way to -- to\nKorea. That\u2019s only eight years. On the street in which I grew up, or everywhere, there wasn\u2019t\nsomebody who didn\u2019t have a brother, an uncle, a father, a grandfather, a nephew, a niece,\nsomebody who hadn\u2019t served in the -- in the -- in the British military, of which most would have\nhad to be sent overseas. Very similar now to what I -- what we read and hear and see happening\nto Americans. So now my parents, people who -- English people would say, what\u2019s happening to\nJohn? So my parents were not long -- refugees in that context.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, they were full British citizens.",
        "A: Well, they were now viewed as being in the similar vein, and I think my parents -- I th -- not\nthat we discussed it, but I\u2019m looking back now, people would say, oh I met so and so, he wanted\nto know how you were doing. My mother in particular, my father didn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t that way\ninclined, but my mother, among, you know, other English people, neighbors and so forth. And I\nthink that that had something to do with these other now elderly ladies, or quite older ladies, who\nagain would sort of say, what\u2019s happening. It -- 1t seemed to raise the level. They weren\u2019t\nrefugees from German oppression. Somebody was doing equal things.",
        "Q: Right, right. It\u2019s interesting how --",
        "A: If that mean -- if -- if you understand. I don\u2019t know whether it has any meaning.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I think it had meaning.",
        "Q: To them, sure.",
        "A: To them, yeah.",
        "Q: Sure, sure.",
        "A: It gave my parents status. They could talk on equal terms.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And in some instances, of course, on more terms, because some of my peer group ended up\nnot going overseas. So here was I now doing something which was far more serious --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- than, you know, being posted to Scotland or someplace like that.",
        "Q: Right, right, right, right. And how long did you serve?",
        "A: I came out in \u201955.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I came out in \u201955, yeah, we -- I came back on a troop ship, you know came back, and was\nthen -- and then ended up in a -- what is like -- you would have to call now like the National\nGuard.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Not from a voluntary point of view, but the system was, when you did your two year\u2019s stint in\n-- in draft -- National Service it was called, English -- but it\u2019s the same thing as the draft, yeah.\nYou then went into -- they call it territorial army, which was like the National Guard, and I\nwould -- I had to do five weekends, and one fort -- two we -- a two or three week camp every\nyear.",
        "Q: Mm-hm",
        "A: Well, this was in \u201955, and I was living at home with my parents, looking for a job. The\nsituation was a little bit different. What I\u2019d seen and witnessed, and been involved in was now\ntotally different from my peer group at school, who\u2019d ri -- who\u2019d gone on -- who\u2019d never gone\noverseas. We were all the same age level, but mentally I was far removed, if you understand\nwhat I\u2019m getting.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: It took me a little bit -- 1t took me several months to wind down from this -- this scenario, if\nyou understand what I\u2019m getting about. So I do understand of -- I -- I -- I -- I have a lot of\nunderstanding as to what\u2019s taking place right now, from an Iraq point of view --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- with the United States forces, particularly at that same age level.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Cause I came back -- now, was a very funny situation, I came back -- I came out, and I wasn\u2019t\neven 21. Now, in England at that time, you couldn\u2019t vote if you\u2019re 21. You had to get permission\nto get married if you were -- if you were less than 21. You couldn\u2019t buy cigarettes if you were --\nunless you were 21, and you couldn\u2019t go into a bar, or a pub, as they call it in England, and order\na drink if you were under 21. So, when I came out, when I was released, I was released -- my\nparents came to the railway station to pick me up. We -- we came off the boat, took the train to\nBedford, and my parents came to me, and they\u2019d already called the -- the -- the -- the -- the\nregimental depot to say, you know, when are they coming in, and they\u2019d said, oh, you know, he\u2019s\n-- he should be arriving at the railway station, and so on. They said, can we go and see him?\nThey said yeah, but have to remember, he -- they\u2019re going to come into the -- we\u2019re gonna -- he\u2019s\ngoing to have to come to the -- he can say hello to you, but he\u2019s got to come to the depot, but\nthey\u2019Il be -- he\u2019Il be going on leave later on this evening, okay. But we -- we need to do some\nforms, and it'll be for three weeks, and then he goes back for a couple of days, and then it\u2019s\nrelease, you see. So my parents had told me this was happening. So, I was not 21 yet, but I was\non three weeks paid leave, but still in the military. So I arrived at home in uniform, and you\nknow, for three weeks I was running around in civilian clothes. And one evening I went to a pub\nnearby to get a drink, and I -- you know, I had to get a packet of cigarettes. And I walked in --\nand -- well, but I\u2019ve told this story [indecipherable] parents and to my wife and to my kids, and\nit\u2019s hilarious. I walked in, and I went to the bar and I said, \u201cI'd like a half a glass of beer, and --\nand a packet of Craven A cigarettes.\u201d And the barman looked at me and said, \u201cHow old are you\nsonny?\u201d You know, and -- and the -- and the older people sitting at the bar, I could hear the little\ntitters of laughter, you see. He says, \u201cYou come back when you\u2019re 21.\u201d You know. So I walked\nout of the bar in a real high state. You have to remember, I\u2019d come back from Korea, you see. I\nwalked home, I went upstairs -- this in my parents house, and I got out of my civilian clothes,\nand --",
        "Q: Put your uniform on.",
        "A: -- put my uniform [indecipherable]. And they said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d I said, \u201cI went to get\na packet of cigarettes and they turned me down.\u201d I put on my uniforms, which had my ribbons on\nit, everything else. And I -- I-I think I run back to the pub, you know, got [indecipherable] stood\noutside, and sort of got myself organized, and I walked in. There was the same barman and the\nsame group of people, it wasn\u2019t very far away. And I said, \u201cI want a glass of beer, and a packet\nof Craven A cigarettes.\u201d And the barman had a straight face, and he pulled this beer out for me,\nand he said, \u201cWhich cigarettes did you order?\u201d And I said, \u201cA packet of 20 Craven A.\u201d And\nthere wasn\u2019t a sound from the -- from the other --",

        "A: -- you -- you know, from the other -- you know, who were still sitting on the bar, so they were\nlooking at me, but not more titters, you see.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And I thought this was -- I was so annoyed, you see.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a great story.",
        "A: And that was the end of -- I mean, of course, nobody said anything, and I know -- I drank my\nbeer, smoked my cigarettes, which you know, obviously didn\u2019t do me any good, I don\u2019t smoke\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Just to prove a point. That had nothing to do with religion, of course --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- I was just so ticked off, you know, I was ready to take the par -- th-the pub apart, you see.",
        "Q: I bet.",
        "A: Not that that would have happened, but nobody said a word --",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s great.",
        "A: -- they just all looked at me, and -- and then tol -- turned and drank their beer again.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: In \u201956 -- and I\u2019m still -- I turned 21. In \u201956, Britain, with France went into the Suez, and if you\nremember, Israel attacked from the other side, because Egypt had taken over the Suez canal. In\n\u201956, I was -- I forget which day it was now, I was in London on a in -- going -- going for a job\ninterview, or so. And I came back -- I\u2019d taken the train up in the morning, and I\u2019d come back in\nthe -- before suppertime -- it\u2019s only an hour each way by train. And my mother said to me, \u201cI\nthink you better stay home this evening.\u201d And I -- you know, not with a happy look on her face.\nAnd I said, \u201cOh, why?\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, the police came round this afternoon. They want to\ngive you something.\u201d And I -- so I said, \u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you take it?\u201d They said, \u201cNo, no,\nyou've got to sign for this.\u201d So they -- I said, \u201cWell, what did you say?\u201d They said, \u201cWell, I told\nthem you\u2019d be back -- you were in London for the day, you\u2019d be back.\u201d They said, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll\nbe along tonight at nine o\u2019clock.\u201d So I said, \u201cAll right.\u201d They said -- my mother said, \u201cYou\u2019d\nbetter stay at home for this.\u201d I said [indecipherable] not go out or [indecipherable] that\u2019s okay.\nSure enough about nine-ish in the evening, police car turn up at my -- at our door, and -- and a\nknock on the door, and you know, \u201cJohn Meyerstein?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah.\u201d They said, \u201cWe got a\ndocument.\u201d And it was in one of these buff colored envelopes, and in those days it was on Her\nMajesty\u2019s Service, you see? You\u2019ve got to sign for this thing. And inside was a call-up notice to -\n- to -- to me, to say that if I move from the house for more than 72 hours, I was t -- it was -- in\nthose days they didn\u2019t call it Department of National Defense, it was War Office, to say that the\ndocument was headline -- headed th -- you know -- letterhead was War Office, to say that if I\nmove from this -- my place of residence for more than 72 hours, I was to notify the War Office,\nand I was to hold myself in readiness for an immediate call-up, you see? So I -- I d -- well, I\ndon\u2019t quite know why, I\u2019m not a reservist, th -- you know, I -- the reservists were people who\ndidn\u2019t do anything, but they got paid. I was not a reservist in that way, I was in the territorial,\nwhich was like the National Guard. So the next morning, I called the -- the -- the depot where I\nu-used to do th -- for the training. It was the same ba -- regimental battalion which I\u2019d started off\nwith, you see. And I said, you know, I just had this call-up [indecipherable]. \u201cWell,\u201d they said,\n\u201c\u2018veah you -- there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, what do you mean?\u201d They\nsaid, \u201cWell, you served in Korea, so on your file -- we don\u2019t have to train you again, you\u2019ve had\ntraining for all these things.\u201d And of course, in between that 12 months, I had -- I\u2019d done s-some\n-- locally, some parachute training, because it gave you extra money, and the wings looked pretty\ngood on your battle dress, you see. And they said, \u201cWell, you\u2019ve got all these things, they don\u2019t\nhave to train you. There\u2019s nothing you can do, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s been -- it\u2019s flagged,\nyou know, that you\u2019ve served in a -- in a combat zone before. It\u2019s different if we have to get\nsomebody and we\u2019re going to train them. We don\u2019t need to give you 16 weeks training,\u201d or stuff\nlike that, in much the same way as it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- to some degree it\u2019s happening here, as I read in\nthe papers right now.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: So, of course, I showed this to my parents, and of course nothing was said, there\u2019s nothing I\ncould do about it. Now, it may have been that my mother wasn\u2019t so -- don\u2019t forget, Israel was\nnow on the other side.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So -- so there was a different s -- a very -- 1t wasn\u2019t the Israeli army calling me up, it was the\nBritish army calling me up. And then I got a job interview. I got a job application, you know.\nAnd I took it, and that\u2019s -- and the company wanted me to s -- go overseas to -- to -- to Singapore\non their behalf. And I called the depot -- depot, and said, you know -- I didn\u2019t hear anything for -\n- for awhile. And I -- I called the depot and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got this job.\u201d They said, \u201cWell you take\nthe job, you\u2019ve -- I mean, you\u2019ve just been -- you\u2019ve just been put on notice. If -- you know, if\nthey\u2019re going to do something, they\u2019re going to get in -- they\u2019Il get you wherever you are,\u201d you\nsee. I mean, that is how it\u2019s d -- I don\u2019t know it\u2019s done in -- in the st -- in the United States, but in\nBritain they would know wherever you are.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay. So I went to -- I went to Singapore to work, didn\u2019t hear any more about it. About a year\nafter -- all this is over in \u201956, I get a notice from the depot, \u201cPlease report for -- for -- for the two\nor three weeks annual -- annual maneuvers,\u201d or whatever it is, you see. So I wrote immediately\nback and said, \u201cI\u2019m in Singapore, you want -- you know, you\u2019ve sent me the thing here, could\nyou send me a travel warrant,\u201d which it was the standard thing to do f -- t -- from Singapore to\nLondon and London back to Singapore, or how do you wish me to proceed? I got -- never got an\nanswer back. I never got -- I never had another letter.",
        "Q: Never -- never noticed.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Huh. Huh. Who knows what that was about.",
        "A: Well, I think somebody laughed -- looked at it, I mean they would all know this --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]. Right.",
        "A: -- and the people, because in a small community like that, everybody know it -- my mother\nknew the wife of -- of one of -- of the people who worked in the -- in the depot, or something,\nand they would have known this is going out.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And -- and so they probably said, oh, this 1s nonsense and --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- what do we call John back for, we\u2019re gonna spend money on an air ticket for him.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: You know, the -- the -- the battalion\u2019s not going to fall or -- or break because he\u2019s --",
        "Q: On this guy.",
        "A: -- he\u2019s not here.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So those are -- those are some rather interesting military experiences.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And what is interesting is that that battalion, grandfathered into different names, was the first\nbattalion sent by the British army to Kabul to participate with the united -- or to Afghanistan\nwith the --",
        "Q: Afghanistan.",
        "A: -- with the --",
        "Q: Interesting.",
        "A: -- with the -- with the American forces --",
        "Q: Interesting.",
        "A: -- actually. Interesting to this day, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And I know this because the -- the ba -- the regiment, the battalion, the -- the [indecipherable]\nregiment still sends me, every three or four months, a little brochure of up-to-date happenings as\nto what is -- 1s going on, you know, and what they\u2019re doing, because of what Britain is doing\nnow in Iraq, as well as in -- in -- in -- in -- in -- still in Afghanistan [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right, right, right. I\u2019m going to try and make a jump here now, in terms of our narrative, back\nto making some connections with the St. Louis experience, if I can. You -- and I don\u2019t mean to\ndiminish the in-between years, but we\u2019re really looking to talk --",
        "A: I understand.",
        "Q: -- to relate to -- to this subject. You end up in Asia --",
        "A: Working.",

        "A: My father lived to -- died in -- at -- in I th -- my father -- my father\u2019s birthday was March the\n10\", he died at the end of 1986, which would have made him, I think at that -- at that period if\nI\u2019m not -- yeah, I think I\u2019m right, si -- about six weeks -- almo -- or six or seven weeks short of\n93. And he\u2019s buried in England.",
        "Q: And -- and your mother?",
        "A: She died in December 2001, and she lived to 91 and a half, exactly.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And -- and where is she buried?",
        "A: She\u2019s buried next -- they -- when they -- they bought graves in a d -- in a -- years be -- before,\nin a Jewish cemetery, outside Bedford, between London and Bedford. They bought two graves\nand they\u2019re lying side by side with -- each with their own headstone.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And did she die in England also?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, so sh --",
        "A: And -- and -- and -- in -- in -- in -- in peace and -- and -- and n-no -- no pressure, you know,\nno ha -- peace and quiet, let\u2019s put it that way.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And -- and -- in their last years of their lives were you -- did you see them a lot, or -- were\nthey reflective a-about their experience, or had they kind of moved ahead and looking straight\nahead --",
        "A: My father never discussed it. Again, I have to tell you that.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: A-And my father\u2019d become -- we didn\u2019t talk about that period at all, but he\u2019d become a little\nbit more mellow. My mother, I think, emotionally, was still a little bit more, you know -- could\nreally not forget these things, you know.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Despite the fact that, you know, from a physical point of view, because one can say mental\nstress could be equally as bad as physical stress, you know.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: She, I think, coped with it harder. She did not bury it to the same degree, but, you know, and\nI\u2019m not sure how one -- how one copes on this thing, you know. Individual people have different\nsituations on this. They -- my mother went to Israel twice to see her mother. My father went\nonce, and they both came to North America to s -- to visit me.",
        "Q: Because you ended up in Canada.",
        "A: Because I ended up in Canada, and of course we had two grandchildren of that\n[indecipherable]. And my mother even then flew, while she was in Canada from Toronto to New\nYork to spend a week with Margot -- Aunt Margot, quote, unquote, as I mentioned to you before,\nearlier in the discussions.",
        "Q: Her friend from school.",
        "A: Yeah, and spent -- and stayed with her and then came back again, you know.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I did ask my parents -- my mother was quite keen to come and join us. My father -- we went\nfor a walk, and you have to remember, my father was already now in his 80\u2019s, or just -- yeah,\nbeginning his 80\u2019s. And I asked him, and he said, \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cI -- I\u2019m too old.\u201d He says -- he\nlooked upon North America, he liked everything which he saw, but he thought it was a younger\nperson\u2019s country. And for him I think it would have been re-rooting another tree, took him long\nenough to plant in England, if you want to put it that way. I think that would have been too\nmuch. My mother, I think, was interested in that time. I think my father found his English\nsolitude comforting. He -- he was very much an island unto himself. You can\u2019t really live that\nway, but he tried his utmost to -- to -- t-to -- to activate that sort of situation, I think. But they\ndidn\u2019t come again -- he didn\u2019t come again, and -- and -- and that\u2019s quite an effort. In those days\nthey really wanted, you know, they didn\u2019t like if -- people who were quite old to fly. I mean, he\nwas physically fit okay, but I mean, he was in his 80\u2019s. I mean, can you imagine what would\nhave happened if he\u2019d had a heart attack or something, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And -- an -- as you were then left home, and had your own life, and\nchildren of your own, how did you integrate your earlier experiences with your later life, and --\nand were you able to move ahead, and did it motivate you in any way, either socially, or\npolitically, or rel -- in a -- in a -- in terms of a religious community, can you -- are you able to --\nto sort of understand how those early years formed you and affected you later?",
        "A: I think -- that\u2019s not an easy question to answer.",
        "Q: I know, it\u2019s a hard -- it\u2019s very hard as a -- it\u2019s a --",
        "A: I certainly think that the -- the early years made me much more self sufficient, or reliant upon\nmyself. My parents didn\u2019t, for a long time, didn\u2019t know a lot of people -- and I\u2019m talking about\npeople in England, English people to whom they could ask questions and -- as to what one\nshould be doing, how should we do it. So everything which I thought about, or wanted to do, I\nwould have to sort of glean for myself through my questions, wondi -- wondering whether that\nperson would know what I was talking about or so forth. So, i1-it made me stand on my own feet,\nequally so. My military experiences certainly helped in that, because in those days when you\nwent for a job interview, more or less any company would ask, have you been in the military? In\nEngland, what sort of school did you go to, and have you served in the military and the third\nquestion was, have you served overseas? And I think the reason for that was that they felt if -- if\nthose three things all tied together, they had a reliable, disciplined person, who would understand\nwhat to do, okay. Now whether that\u2019s true today, I suspect not to the same degree at all. M-My\nfather being so much older, was -- wasn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t that easy to relate in terms, I mean, when I --\nI watch -- I go out to watch our grandkids play soccer or something like that, and we -- and we\u2019re\nnot close together, we -- they live very far apart, but when we do -- or we\u2019ve done for our own\nkids when they were doing that. Girls play soccer these days now. I don\u2019t mean that in a silly\nway, but --",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: -- but my father didn\u2019t have the time or the energy.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, af -- and probably was still too depressed. And my mother was also working in\nwhatever shape or form to bring some extra money in. Not the nicest of jobs, you know, cleaning\nfloors, and washing clothes in -- 1n a -- in somebody\u2019s house is not exactly what she was used to,\nbut it paid the -- it paid bills, and eventually she didn\u2019t have to do that. So, I didn\u2019t really have\nthat -- that close-knit relationship. I was very grateful to my father for making sure, and going\nout of his way, with all his efforts to get me a good education, and -- and a certain standard of --\nof -- of decency, and -- and -- and how to live, and how to behave. And the -- and that -- you\nknow, the behavior -- to him, behavior and dignity were terribly important, which I think you can\nunderstand. My mother was a much more emotional person, I think became somewhat more\nreligious in later years. But we didn\u2019t talk a great deal about it. It -- perhaps that was the way\nGerman Jews, who had lived in Germany for such -- and I don\u2019t mean that in any demeaning\nway, had integrated so much that they did not view themselves so much as Jewish as they viewed\nthemselves as Germans of a Jewish religion, 1-1f you understand, actually.",
        "Q: Quite a different thing, sure.",
        "A: Okay?",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: And we didn\u2019t talk about that. Nobody made any demands upon anybody. And it\u2019s very hard\nfor me to understand that. When I went to get a job interview, when I was being inter -- in -- and\nI\u2019m only speaking about my experiences in England, nobody ever asked, you know, what\nreligion are you, 1-1f you understand what I\u2019m getting at.",
        "Q: Yes, mm-hm.",
        "A: I mean, just to give you an illustration of how these -- I\u2019m only speaking now from the\nEnglish point of view. Years later I\u2019m living in Canada, I\u2019m running a business of my own, and\ndealing with British companies of quite sizable renown and -- renow -- renown in -- in their own\nfields. And suddenly I\u2019m asked -- I get a call from -- from -- from a senior army officer from\nEngland saying we\u2019re going to be in eng -- in Canada in a short period of [indecipherable] we\u2019d\nlike you to consider being an honorary defense industries representative for us. It\u2019s purely\nhonorary, it doesn\u2019t pay anything. Would you be interested? And I thought to my -- well, I -- I\nsaid yes, you know, I mean, no reason. And I thought to myself -- he came and 1n typical English\nway we met, had a meal, some drinks. He knew exactly what school I\u2019d been to, where I\u2019d done\nmy service, who I was representing. I have to assume that some of the companies from England,\nwho deal with Department of National Defense said we have so and so. And they want -- and he\nsaid it\u2019s purely honorary, but it opened the doors to a lot of scenarios. And I said to my wife\nafter, isn\u2019t it funny a German Jewish refugee, sitting in Canada now, has been asked to be an\nhonorary situation in this way, where I\u2019d come, you see.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I -- I mean, this is many years -- a number of years ago. And I thought, what an\nachievement for myself, you know, 1-if I can view it in that way.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: I just thought it was a great -- it was an honor.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how much it really benefited me, but it was -- I thought 1t was an honor to me,\nas to how far I\u2019d come, and the -- and the -- the -- the feeling of -- of -- of being able to have\nsomebody ask that, and not sort of say, where are your antecedents, and -- and -- and -- and so\nforth.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so these things had -- but nobody said to me, are you Jewish? What religion are you? Are\nyou a refugee? Were you the son of a refugee? Now, why would they ask in the first place, but\nmy parents didn\u2019t talk about the St. Louis to other people. They talked perhaps, to other Jewish,\nin that little group --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- about it. And if somebody who had an understanding, like yourself, they might -- my\nmother -- certainly my father wouldn\u2019t have discussed it with you.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know. And -- but beyond that, that was an era which had gone, from my father\u2019s point of\nview. I don\u2019t think he would have appreciated it. I don\u2019t know how best to answer your -- your\nquestion that way. I-I don\u2019t know. I -- I went to -- I went to visit Israel in 1967 -- \u201967, yes. And I\ntalked to my mother\u2019s brother. I stayed with my uncle and his wife.",
        "Q: Lothar?",
        "A: Lota, yeah. His wife was Laura. She ran a flower business and had the contract to supply the\nIsraeli parliament every day with flowers. And she -- and I had the chance -- she took me with\nher, and I had a chance to see the -- the Israeli parliament and to explain various other things and\nso forth. My uncle was also very much an intellectual, eve -- you know, in his own way. Also a\nlawyer, but never practiced law. Too late for him, you know.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: And never practiced it in Israel either. And worked at the -- the la -- the library in -- in\nJerusalem or something like that, you know, he liked -- he was great on books. And he told me\nquite frankly, he said, \u201cI\u2019m -- I\u2019m an agnostic. I\u2019ve -- \u2019ve become an agnostic.\u201d And I said,\n\u201cWell then, do you go to the synagogue?\u201d He and I were just talking alone quietly. And I said,\n\u201cWere you always an agnostic?\u201d And I think he said to me no, not initially, but he said, \u201cIt\nwasn\u2019t a very deeply religious household in which we grew up in,\u201d for whatever reasons, we\ndidn\u2019t go into that detail, and I don\u2019t know, you know, because what is one man\u2019s viewpoint --\npersonal viewpoint, not -- might not necessarily reflect what actually did happen\n[indecipherable].

And by the way, my uncle always wrote to me in English,\nyou know, from Israel. I would send him books, and he would send me a recommendation on\nbooks. Course, his recommendation on books were based on his time at the university, you\nknow, when he was studying in Germany, okay. Whereas my books would be on more current\naffairs, you know, current affairs, politics, North America, British, or something like that, he --\nhe loved that. And I would send him the books, and he would read that. In fact my -- my -- my --\nmy cousin, his son, he had two children, a -- a boy and a girl -- his son, when his father died,\nwhen my uncle died, called me up to tell me what had happened, and I -- you know, and I -- and\nwe were talking and he said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve suddenly discovered all my father\u2019s papers.

And it was time for me to do the headstone for my mother, cause you\ngenerally don\u2019t -- it\u2019s in the -- in the grave, you don\u2019t put a headstone 1n 1n the first few months\nor a year because the ground tends to move, and the stones can fall over. So I'd had the\nheadstone made, made arrangements for the people in England to carve the headstone to match\nthe duplicate of my father, an-and to have it in there so for my arrival, so I could combine the\ntrip. My wife was very keen, cause this is a one off thing, and if she didn\u2019t attend there\u2019d be no\nsecond 50, you know, reunion in Bath, England, cause she went t-to study home economics in -\n- you know, in Bath, a-as a -- as a student, okay. And -- and she\u2019d been to Washington long\nbefore I ever got here. She -- after she\u2019d finished u-university studies, she came to visit, her\nfather sent her through the United States to have a -- to -- to -- to see North America in general,\nactually, long before I ever got here. While she was at school studying, I was in Korea, you see. I\nalways say to her, my taxes, she got a -- got a free education. But anyway, and we did all this,\nyou see, we -- we went to -- and of course she ca -- we went together to bury my mother and --\nand so forth. My children are aware of this. Last year when we were back, my cousin, the older g\n-- my uncle, a girl. She now has four children of her own, and more grandchildren than I\u2019ve got,\nyou know. In the last month she\u2019s just had two, suddenly. But she turned up with her husband,\nwith her daughter. She was coming on a business trip to Europe, but she was coming to England\nbecause she\u2019d found out that I was coming -- we hadn\u2019t seen each other for years -- but -- with\nher husband. Her daughter was living -- was spending some time in England. Her son, who was\nmarried, was spending some time 1n England as well. We all met in London for a meal, for\nlunch. And we spent the whole -- we -- I think we met at 12, we didn\u2019t break up until six o\u2019clock\nin the evening. And it\u2019s very funny, her -- she is now e-mailing me almost on a regular basis,\nwhich hasn\u2019t happened. Her son, who\u2019s -- is e-mailing me, who I -- the youngest son, w-which\nwe'd never met before, I had no idea what he looked like and so forth.

I\u2019m -- I -- ma -- my -- my f -- agrees with me on this, we\u2019ve talked about this, in fact my\ndaughters also, I\u2019ve discussed this with my daughters, who were -- you know, my eldest daughter\nis 42, and the other one will be 38 this year, both married with children. I don\u2019t know whether\nmy cousins are -- view me now as a sort of rock, because of the worries which are going on in\nIsrael.

        "A: -- from Jews, and others, but Jews as -- in particular, and those are now being checked out.\nAnd -- and as you know, the Swiss, you know -- you know, looted all the accounts. I, by sheer\ncoincidence, not without any deliberate scenarios, happened to hit a website about a year ago,\nand up popped my grandma -- parent\u2019s names on my mother\u2019s side, and my father\u2019s name, my\nmother\u2019s name and my name, with all the right birthdates, places of birth and the time of -- you\nknow, th-the -- the date of birth, with the exact names. Now, I don\u2019t know where they got these\nthings from. So, I called my cousin in Australia, and it was agreed th -- that we would put a\nclaim in for property -- we already had that done before -- we would put in another claim, and we\nwould also put in an insurance claim. And rightly or wrongly, ve no means of knowing. But my\ncousin in Australia said, \u201cJohn, will you take care of this?\u201d So I said yes. Now, she physically is\nnot so well any more. I mentioned the same -- I called my two cousins in or -- in Israel, cause\nthey\u2019re the direct grandchildren, like I am, of our grandfather on my mother\u2019s side. And said,\n\u201cT\u2019ve seen these names, and I\u2019ve seen your father\u2019s name on their as well, and my mother\u2019s\nname. Not my name, not your names, but our -- I think you should -- did you notice?\u201d \u201cNo, we\ndidn\u2019t notice.\u201d They didn\u2019t even know about this. I said, \u201cI think you should put some -- a claim\nin.\u201d And both of me -- he said, \u201cJohn, you take care of it -- will you take care of it?\u201d I said,\n\u201cWell, I -- a-are you quite happy with this?\u201d Because in the application forms -- I\u2019d already\ndownloaded them from the computer, and I\u2019d read them through. And of course, don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s\nall in English, the applications have to be in English, and they\u2019re not normally speaking English\nat the -- so, 1t would -- that\u2019s another reason they probably might have thought let John do it,\ncause he understands the language better. And I said, \u201cAre you absolutely comfortable,\u201d because\nI said that I will -- I sign as the applicant, and I have to state, which I would, and give your\naddresses of any other relatives who might, should a claim ever be honored, if the -- if there 1s --\nit ever come up, that I undertake to insure that you were [indecipherable] no question, no doubt\nin my -- please take care of it, I said, \u201cI tell you what, in that case I will do it, but I will give you\ncopies of everything,\u201d which I did, and to my cousin in Australia. But I said, \u201cRecognize\nsomething, our chances are less than one percent. If you look at it in that light, then you won\u2019t\nget upset. If nothing happens, if 1t comes, which we -- I doubt very much, then wh -- we\u2019ll see\nwhat happens. But if you\u2019re comfortable,\u201d -- and they said, \u201c\u201cWe\u2019re very comfortable.\u201d And from\n-- and, you know, and somehow or another that suddenly -- and I\u2019ve wondered to myself whether\npsychologically they look upon me now as somebody who if something devastating were to\nhappen -- and I mean, unfortunately they are in an area of the -- of the world where, you know, I\nmean, things can happen elsewhere, but where things are not the most pleasant for everybody --\nwhether they don\u2019t somehow look upon me as being somebody who might be in a position to\nhelp, were something to go wrong.",

And here we are now, looking back to this event that happened in 1939, in an institution\nwhere an enormous amount of human energy has been devoted to documenting this period, this\nevent and the period surrounding it. That aside, how do you look back on the St. Louis? Is it a\ntiny blip to you, or do you have feelings about it, attitudes about it, in terms of in pol -- maybe\npolitical attitudes about it.

And Canada turned them down with much greater vehemence, I think, indirectly, than\nlet\u2019s say other countries may have down. Just said no. I\u2019ve read certain documents, or papers\nwhich -- in books, which indicate that there was a reason for it, Quebec being French, and\nCatholic, and you know, not keen to want anything to do with Jews at that time, had influence on\nthe federal government, I don\u2019t know. Could something have been done at this end? Yes, I have\nto ask myself that question. Could, you know, could the federal government, in it\u2019s wisdom,\nignore -- could the president of the United States or whatever, have ignored the political antennas\naround him and said, for humanitarian reasons it\u2019s a mere 1100 people, 1200 people or whatever.\nI think they could have done. I mean, when I see the way things are happening today. Would it\nhave made a difference to my parents? Hopefully it would have done. At least they would have\nhad some relatives like these people here --",

        "A: -- in Chicago. How much they could have done to help beyond, I don\u2019t know. It would have\nbeen a point of reference, I would imagine we would have attempted to -- to go there, that\u2019s the\nonly point, just out of sheer gratitude, and they -- probably knowing them -- they\u2019re long dead\nnow, and I honor them accordingly, I\u2019m sure they would have done everything possible to -- to\nhelp us, or to put us up, or it wouldn\u2019t matter what it would have been. Yes, I-I -- that\u2019s always\nbeen a disappointment to me. Politics being politics, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m logical enough to know that, you\nknow, somebody would argue that, you know, what are a thousand people in the context of a\ncountry\u2019s overall requirements? What did that German military store in Klausowitz say? You\nknow, war is just another name for -- and a tactic of politics, or something like that, I think you\nunderstand what I mean. I don\u2019t know. I -- I -- I -- I certainly don\u2019t think that Canada came out of\nit any -- in any great honor, notwithstanding what they might do today. Say certainly there were\npeople who did go to the Prime Minister in Canada at the time, and say please do something, and\nI don\u2019t mean just Jews. Could America have done something? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think the\nEuropean countries who -- who gave sanction -- sanctuary to -- to the -- to us, whether it was\nEngland, or that -- did 1t with great enthusiasm, but they did it, you know. For which, certainly\nfrom England\u2019s point of view, I\u2019m eternally grateful, actually. And I think P\u2019ve repaid my s -- my\nscore on that by -- by my military service for U.K. And I suppose in fairness -- and my parents\nare buried there, and all the benefits I\u2019ve gained, in -- from a business, or other point of view,\nhave come from the U.K., and were -- it never gonna happen, but were England to call, I would\nhave to assume that I\u2019d have to do something, more than for anywhere else, because of that. But\ndo I believe they all did it because they thought we were the greatest thing, no, I would imagine\nthey did it because we were a damned inconvenience. But it was -- but they were good enough to\ndo it, in whatever way. And whether somebody persuaded them, or somebody put some pressure\non, doesn\u2019t matter. It only requires good people to stand up and something can happen. The other\nargument, if good people stand up and do nothing, bad things happen.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Right. I would imagine I\u2019m being very, perhaps coldly logical in -- and -- and -- and in many\nways I can follow that because I an -- my father was, you know, very Prussian in his ways, you\nknow, really. And I can understand those feelings, because actually I was born in -- in what was\nPrussia then, because Prussia didn\u2019t become a non-country until after the war, I think \u201947 or \u00b048,\nwhen they decided to eliminate the country as a country. So I can feel these things. This is not an\ninheritance of one generation. We\u2019re talking back generations here, you know. When I got called\nup, my mother -- my mother sort of said, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s that German instinct,\u201d you know, got to\ngo back into the military again. And my father said nothing and we all laughed, but underneath\nit, perhaps my mother had a point, you know. I didn\u2019t go unhappily, you know. No --",

Do I think these things can happen again? I suspect\nso. Do I feel that things could have been done better? Yes, I do. How can I change that? I\u2019ve\ntaught my kids about that.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I\u2019ve not -- I\u2019ve never tried to impose too much on it, I wanted them to have a normal life, as\nnormal as I could make it, and as normal as I got it. And I am grateful to my parents, or to my\nfather in particular, for not putting me into this position of having to try and almost rethink\neverything [indecipherable] continuous, as we talked about earlier. But I\u2019ve always said to my\nkids, you know, my daughters, if you have to do something, don\u2019t do it at the last minute, do it\nwhen it\u2019s easy, when there\u2019s no pressure, if that\u2019s what you want to do.

I find 1t sometimes very hard to understand how my -- my family, my father\u2019s family\nand my mother\u2019s family, male and female, male more than anything else because they\u2019re the\nones who had the -- the greatest education, and I mean a really good education, could not have\nseen the writing on the wall.

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: My mother tells me that they had a meeting, but I wasn\u2019t part of that meeting, you know, I -- I\nwas born, but I wasn\u2019t like we\u2019re discussing here, so I can\u2019t really say what actually took place.\nYou know, how did they discuss it, what did they discuss? I suppose the question probably was\nraised is what are we going to do? And where do we go? One thing is, I suspect, when -- when\nwe didn\u2019t get into the United States, or United States made no effort, or -- or Canada, because th\n-- they were the next two -- the two countries closest, is that the Germans must have chuckled to\nthemselves and said, \u201cWell, you see, if they don\u2019t let them in, there\u2019s only 1100. And then what\nyou -- you -- no wonder what we\u2019re doing is right.\u201d",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Okay?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Then I have to ask the question, well why did the other countries do it, okay? Holland\u2019s\nalways had that reputation for giving sanctity to -- sanctuary, I beg your pardon, to -- to refugees.\nThe -- France, I\u2019m not quite sure, even to this day in my mind -- I\u2019m a bit ambivalent about\nFrance, I can -- was it Belgium agreed as well?",
        "Q: I think so.",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019m not quite -- I don\u2019t know enough about Belgium. Britain always opened it\u2019s doors to\nrefugees in the old days. Course the old days weren\u2019t so old any more at that time, okay, but they\ndid it. For whatever reason, they did it. Nobody else did it in Europe. And the Germans must\nhave been saying to themselves, well hooray, we can go full steam ahead, cause nobody\u2019s gonna\nsave these guys. Is that a correct assessment? I don\u2019t know. I have pondered about this. I would\nhave to tell you that I became -- ve become very cynical about platitudes of all descriptions.\nI\u2019m skeptical. I want to see the deeds done. And of course there are good men who stand up. But\nsometimes they get overwhelmed by other people who say, it\u2019s not my business, it\u2019s not my\naffair, and really, I don\u2019t want to get involved. I don\u2019t know the answer to that.",
        "Q: But the --",
        "A: You know, and -- and -- and -- and it\u2019s, you know, not sure whether that\u2019s answered your\nquestion correctly. I -- I -- I don\u2019t think the St. Louis is the only motivating factor in my\ncomments to you. I could say to you that nobody came up to my parents or to my father and said,\nI know you were a barrister, now you can\u2019t practice law -- this was after they got in England --\nPll help you get a job. Which must have been very tough for him. But on the other hand I\nrecognize also that we landed, were accepted, and left alone. Nobody bothered us, nobody threw\nstones at us. Nobody bis -- painted signs on the -- on the doors. Th -- the -- the homes we all\nlived in, or rented, were all owned by non-Jews. Nobody marched outside to chastise that person\nor uS.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Not that that would have happened anyway, the police would have been round there normally\nin those days, even to this day. But what I\u2019m getting at 1s people could turn around and say, you\nwere lucky. And I suppose we were, because I suspect strongly that those people who, for\nwhatever reasons, went to Europe, to the countries, all of which were overrun by Germany, not\nall of them survived.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: In fact, I would have to anticipate, I don\u2019t know the figures, and we did talk about this earlier\nyesterday, I have a very great feeling that most of them -- there are survivors, but I don\u2019t think\nthey survived in -- I mean, from my perspective, we didn\u2019t have a lot of money, but we had\nclothes, and sho -- and en-enough food to eat, whether it was -- whether we had -- we didn\u2019t have\nmeat every day, but we were on rationing like everybody else in England. But it didn\u2019t seem to\naffect my health. I was accepted at school, nobody questioned me, nobody criticized me, no\nteacher made derogatory remarks. And when my parents in -- or my mother in the beginning,\nwent to see a teacher in her broken English, nobody laughed at her or -- or denigrated her, or\ntalked about her. So perhaps we ha -- we have something to be grateful for, but have I become\ncynical? I suppose so, a little bit. More so than the St. Louis, do you understand? Cause we\nsurvived the St. Louis.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: I understand about --",
        "A: -- yeah, you see, I\u2019m sure that 1t must have been terrible for my parents, and my grandfather,\nnot knowing in those -- in that period when the ship turned around and we arrived in England, or\nit was finally determined that we could go. And obviously, when my father made the decision,\nmy grandfather must have made the s -- followed. I mean, 1t would have been ridiculous if he\nhad gone somewhere else, but he could have done, I mean, he was his own man. He didn\u2019t.\nThank goodness. He -- we all -- perhaps they discussed it, and my -- or my father may have\ntalked to my father -- grandfather about it, and said, \u201cI\u2019m going, we\u2019re going to do this.\u201d And he\nmight have said -- they might have agreed on that. I don\u2019t know. It was never discussed. But it\u2019s\nvery hard for me cause I was not part of that conversation, and you ask me perhaps -- and you\nstarted off at the beginning by sort of saying sometimes parents try to shield their children, what\ncould I have contributed to it, you know? I\u2019m sure my father didn\u2019t talk to my mother about\nBuchenwald, or what little --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continue -- this 1s a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with John\nMeyerstein, conducted by Nina Ellis on July first, 2004, in Washington, D.C. This is tape\nnumber four, side A.",
        "A: I can recall that on odd occasions -- certainly not by my father because he never discussed\nthose things, but my mother, when we talked about the St. Louis, or she mentioned it to other --\ngenerally German refugees earlier in the war, when they got together in -- in Bedford, you know,\nthree or four people, or something, they would -- or they would talk to each other and -- and the\nSt. Louis might well come up. I don\u2019t recall my mother ever saying to me, or in her presence,\nbecause they were always -- and I was always taken along at these things, because they had\nnowhere to leave me, my mother, and didn\u2019t want to leave me anyway. And -- and so she would\nbe talking in German, and when she mentioned the St. Louis, I don\u2019t ever recall her saying that\nshe had, on the St. Louis, an unpleasant experience, any of the crew, or the staff, or anybody was\nrude to her. Now usually, if somebody was rude, or crude, or showed impatience or something,\nI\u2019m sure she would have made a comment about that. My mo -- my mother was rather me-\nmeticulous a-about that sort of thing. I never heard her say anything which was like a derogatory\nscenario. Obviously, of course, it was from the -- from the point of view of where we were going\nto land, was serious. But I don\u2019t recall her ever mentioning that -- that the people as -- the staff of\nthe -- of the crew, either on the way out, or on the way back to Europe, were unpleasant, as far as\nshe was -- a -- as something which she could have said had impacted upon her. Now, whether\nthat happened with -- you know, in the same way to -- to 999 other passengers, I don\u2019t know, and\nI can\u2019t say, you know. But in that context, that\u2019s perhaps another way of trying to explain to you\nthat, you know, the -- for me -- for -- I think for my parents it was always the question of where\nwould they end up. Because don\u2019t forget, my father probably -- I mean this is not a -- we don\u2019t\nhave a piece of paper saying that, but I\u2019m pretty sure that for my father, he was under notice, as\nmust -- must have been my grandfather, if you are not out of Germany within some things, we\nwill be back for you and Buchenwald will be even worse than it already 1s. Now, on the other\nhand, I have the Red Cross letters, of which my grandmother on my father\u2019s side was still alive\nand writing to us in April of 1942. We received it in June *42, okay. Now, in the same year, in\nSeptember, she was transported to Theresienstadt, and died a month later, we just got that\nconfirmed yesterday, okay, here. I just had that -- your -- your -- your -- your colleague\ndownstairs, Steve oh, whatever it is, found it out. And it\u2019s taken me a long time, you know. How\nmany -- over half a century to find that out. So how did these things happen, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nconceivable that the people would have remained where they were for awhile, before all these\nreally horrendous things, in terms of transportation, death camps, came along. In other words\nwas building up, but it didn\u2019t happen in -- in one month. I\u2019m not trying to minimize that, okay.\nSo it\u2019s possible that my parents could have lived in Halle from somewhat longer. But I think that\nmy father was under sentence, if you follow what I\u2019m getting at.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I\u2019ve often wondered how he got out of Buchenwald. You know, y -- I -- and I -- I -- I\u2019ve --\nI\u2019ve -- | -- I -- the only rea -- and there\u2019s nothing on paper, and he never discussed it, but I\u2019ve\nread documentation to say that, you know, World War I veterans were -- were released with an\nunderstanding. However, I\u2019ve also pondered my father being -- having been the outside counsel\nfor I.G. Farben, and knowing so many people in Halle, in -- in -- where his career was. And my\nmother would tell me that even in -- even in -- in the period between hi -- \u201933, and perhaps up to\n-- up to the -- 38, they would have like -- they call it in -- in German -- in -- in -- in German, it\nwas like a -- the equivalent of Bridge scart and once a week --",
        "Q: The equivalent of what?",
        "A: It\u2019s -- it was a card game, like Bridge.",
        "Q: Oh. Oh, oh, oh.",
        "A: And per -- I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s weekly or monthly, my mother would have -- the -- it\nwould be arranged that my parents -- a combination -- my father had his business on a fourth\nfloor of an apartment building. Half the fi -- a -- the floor, was the apartment for living and the\nother half was his private practice. And the -- you know, this would be a table of four and six,\nand she would have a buffet done. This is after Hitler still is around, can you beat this, you know.\nAnd Is -- used to ask -- I asked her [indecipherable] I said -- I said, \u201cAnd they were all Jewish\npeople?\u201d And is -- no, there might have been a couple of Jews, and the rest were, you know,\npeople from either a judge or somebody else, who were not Jews. And my -- my -- I do recall my\nfather saying to me, that had things got very bad, he had already made arrangements with people\nhe knew, who would take me -- and they were obviously all known Jewish people, and -- but it\nnever came up, okay. Now who they were, what they were, I don\u2019t know. And I\u2019ve often\nwondered whether some of these people may not have -- you know, they were not, you know,\nthey were pretty senior people in the city of -- I suspect [indecipherable] people who were known\nin the city, you know, if it was -- if it was legal or otherwise, whether that didn\u2019t help him get\nout, you know. You can\u2019t tell, you know. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s a strange -- I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: These are questions that you\u2019ll always have.",
        "A: Yeah. And I don\u2019t know the answers --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- to those, and then nobody\u2019s alive to this day.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. I wanted to ask you about this -- this is sort of a museum kind of centered\nquestion, but since you received this notice that this search was going on for survivors, and\nyou\u2019ve come into contact with all this information and been thinking about it, and maybe in -- in\na different kind of way, or through a different kind of lens, and come here to Washington, and\nyou\u2019ve answered this question partially, but how has this brought you either any kind of new\nunderstanding, or specific kind of information about your family that otherwise may not have\nhappened to you?",
        "A: That\u2019s it -- you\u2019ve got -- there\u2019s several questions in that one question.",
        "Q: I know, I know.",
        "A: New understanding?",

What I -- what has happened is, in coming here, and -- and -- and through the generous\nhelp of people like yourself and others, I\u2019ve managed, after all these years, on behalf of my\ncousin in Australia who 1s in her 80\u2019s now, to get closure on my grandmothers. I have a -- I have\na -- a date on which she died. So we now know where she died, and on the day in which, cause\nyou know, it -- it turns out the Germans were meticulous, it seemed, in stating --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- where the dates are. That was my main reason, I have to be truthful with you. I can\u2019t do\nanything about the St. Louis. I didn\u2019t initiate the project, you\u2019re initiating the project, or the\nmuseum, and I think it\u2019s great. And it -- and -- but I have to say to you, there\u2019s not much I can --",
        "Q: Gain from it.",
        "A: -- gain, because even though I was on it, from my personal experience it wasn\u2019t horrendous.\nAt least I don\u2019t think it was. I can\u2019t answer for my parents any more, because they\u2019re dead.\nWhether I ca -- and they really made no reference to the St. Louis -- St. Louis, other than it was a\nvoyage. And they couldn\u2019t get into Cuba, and they couldn\u2019t get into the States. Well, Cuba was\nreally their -- the -- the -- the -- the weigh station, if you want to put it that way. I don\u2019t know,\nyou know, beyond that I don\u2019t know. I -- I\u2019m glad that I -- I got acquainted with you all, because\nthe -- the people here at the museum are doing their best to answer some other questions. I got\nmy first answer yesterday. I think I posed three questions -- actually four, but three of the more\nserious ones. My fourth question really was to the museum, what are you planning to do with all\nthis, you know, as far as the St. Louis is concerned, but that\u2019s not a -- that\u2019s not a -- a -- a family\nissue, Okay, in that context. I had three serious questions. The first one got answered.",
        "Q: About your grandmother.",
        "A: About my grandmother. And was -- my cousin, I al-already guessed, we had no closure date.\nSo this means I don\u2019t have to -- to -- to -- to -- to have a -- a what do they call it, a plaque put up\nsomewhere else to do th -- I do now know where she 1s, okay, and I can, in -- in -- 1n any little\nfamily book, I can put down died so and so, okay. How she died, I don\u2019t want to think about. I\nsuspect that there\u2019s a -- she was only in her mid-70\u2019s, people live to much older ages these days.\nSo why should it have happened, how could it have happened? I don\u2019t even ask those questions,\ncause I won\u2019t get any answer, and all I\u2019ll do is make myself angry. If you -- if you understand.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: Okay. So I\u2019ve got closure. What I really would like to do, perhaps on my father\u2019s behalf, 1s\nfind out what happened to his elder brother, and that\u2019s going to be a lot harder.",
        "Q: Hugo.",
        "A: Yeah, now he obviously died early in -- and in -- where, and under what circumstances, we\ndon\u2019t know. My mother always said that he had sort of fled eastwards. But if he fled too far east,\nhow did he end up getting a cable -- how did he get to find out where we were in London to send\nus a telegram? And why did he end up coming back the other way, and dying in a -- as a result of\nquote unquote, the term hospitalization which my grandmother, well, it was typed out for her,\nand we have to ask what that means. How would she have known about that so early in the war,\nokay? So where was he, if she\u2019d have known that. I mean, I can\u2019t believe that everybody\n[indecipherable] these unoccupied territories would have been so keen to start sending out. And -\n- and I think the museum has mentioned that it\u2019s really more in Germany that all these things\nwere kept meticulously, you know. Just as well they were now today, because that means we can\ntrace them, and we can complain about them, and -- and -- and quote for some people, perhaps it\nmay give them some claim in their old age where they might need the restitution which they\u2019re\nentitled to. But I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s really what I\u2019d want to get out of this thing, and I\u2019m not --\nand because if y -- I hadn\u2019t been made aware of this, and I didn\u2019t even see it in the -- I -- you\nknow, the Washington Post isn\u2019t read daily by everybody overseas. And it isn\u2019t read everywhere\ndaily in the United States, you know.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: We winter down in Houston in -- for three months with our daughter, younger daughter who\nlives there permanently, and we had the Houston Chronicle delivered to us every day, so you\nknow, I wasn\u2019t rushing out to get the Washington Post. And I didn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t aware of it, even\nthough apparently it was advertised in other papers, and a friend of ours, who is actually the --\nthe godfather of our younger daughter in Houston, who lives in -- here in -- and worked as a --\nwe met each other years ago in -- overseas, and he became -- he and his wife became godparents\nto my daughter. He was in the foreign service, and we\u2019ve kept in touch over the -- over the time,\nand he called me, and said, \u201cDid you know about this?\u201d I said no. He said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen,\u201d -\n- I said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t normally take the wa -- Washington Post.\u201d I said, \u201cThe easiest one to get,\nwhere we are, is actually the New York Times, actually.\u201d",
        "Q: New York Times.",
        "A: And I\u2019m not trying to denigrate the Washington Post. But I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything like\nthat in the Wall Street Journal,\u201d I get that every day on my doorstep at six in the morning at\nhome, and -- with our other papers -- and he said, \u201cIll send it to you.\u201d And that\u2019s where it all\nstarted. But for me at that juncture, 1t was important because your colleagues here all offered to\nbe of help if they could, which was very generous and I appreciate that very much. The other\nthing is, it wasn\u2019t until my mother died, in 2001, that I got a chance to go through all these\npapers, cause up to that time, she was really -- kept them boxed, bagged, and everything else.\nAnd it was quite a difficult process, because when you consider when th -- their ages when they\nboth died -- so the Germans didn\u2019t win that game -- it was almost a hundred years of\ndocumentation. And the very serious things were all in German, and in all German writing. You\nknow, not the Romanized way we see it today, you know [indecipherable] we\u2019re talking about.\nAnd I\u2019ve had to really, piece by piece, and it wasn\u2019t until last year that I went -- that I took back\nwith me, or went through the li -- in England, the last box of papers and pictures, which\nsomebody very gener -- kindly and generously kept for me, you know. You know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not\neasy to take things back in bags, and all the rest of this, you know --",
        "Q: No, I can\u2019t imagine it, yeah.",
        "A: -- you understand. And so that has, to some degree, sparked off. And then when my cousins\nasked me on both sides to submit these claims, I then really had to dig into this material. Luckily,\nI had it now, but it\u2019s still very time consuming, because the answers aren\u2019t always there. So then\nwhen this thing came up, at the end of last year, al -- I thought to myself -- perhaps I\u2019m being a\nbit selfish here, perhaps this is a way in which I can get some answers, not so much for claims or\nanything else, but on what happened to my grandmother, which I did. What happened to my\nUncle Hugo. Those were the two --",
        "Q: Right. Pressing -- pressing questions for you.",
        "A: -- priority questions actually. I am a little skeptical about what I get [indecipherable] mind,\nbecause even downstairs in the museum, the people who deal with that, the ones who found what\nhappened to my grandmother said it\u2019s very -- that could prove to be very, very difficult, you\nknow. And why would he have been rounded up immediately, that\u2019s you know, do you under --\ndo you follow?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know, the real serious round-ups -- I mean my grandmother wasn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t deported to\nTheresienstadt until 19 -- 1942. The war broke out in 39, if Hitler was putting all the Jews in,\nwhy didn\u2019t they all go in wa -- in one fell swoop? So I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s very confusing. But\nwho s -- who knows what [indecipherable]. I -- I -- I don\u2019t know how other than to answer you --\nthat question, and then put some of these things to rest.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not a great believer in dwelling indefinitely on these things, mentally and\nphysically, it doesn\u2019t do you well. I can\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t stop it then, I can\u2019t stop -- stop it now. I\ndon\u2019t want to leave my daughters with an inheritance of trying to find something. They know\nwhere they came from. They know how they got from A to B, they know who their parents are,\nthey know who their grandparents are, they both met the -- one set of grandparents, okay. They --\nthey know from pictures and everything else where they came from, and how far they can -- they\ncan trace back their particular roots --",
        "Q: Pretty far.",
        "A: Pretty far.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So they really don\u2019t need to do chasing. It\u2019s not easy, and sometimes it\u2019s really quite -- how\ncan I put it? Draining. You know, for the simple reason that reading or looking at these things\ncan make people very angry. And I must admit it causes me some anger. Other people view it\ndifferently, so perhaps I\u2019m being a little bit selfish in having the museum do these things for me.\nIf this is a way in which I can, from my point of view, to aid what you\u2019re talking about, do this\noral history, of which the St. Louis is a part, then it\u2019s -- it\u2019s my way of saying thank you very\nmuch. And I think it\u2019s worthwhile, but how much the contribution is to future generations, I\u2019d\nlike to believe that it will be, but I\u2019ve lived and worked in quite a few parts of the world, and I\u2019ve\nhad to step in ironically on behalf of others, purely as a westerner in some parts of the world, for\npeople who came -- I sometimes -- I -- I\u2019m perhaps -- I say to myself -- you know, I -- let\u2019s hope\nthat these things don\u2019t happen again, irrespective of -- to whichever group of people or otherwise\n-- and that\u2019s about as much as I can say to you.",

        "Answer: Stein.",
        "A: Okay. My name is John Meyerstein. I was originally called Hans Meyerstein, but when we\narrived in England after the St. Louis voyage, it was suggested to my parents that -- that they\ngive me an English first name, and the name John was chosen, I\u2019m not sure how, and it\u2019s -- from\nthat moment onwards it became that, and my parents never used any other name but that, at the\ntime. I currently live in Oakville, Ontario, which is about 20 miles west of Toronto. I was born in\nHalle, Germany, on the 21*' of March, 1935.",
        "A: Truthfully I have to say no. I know that some people say that they can remember everything\nwhen they were in a pram, or a cradle. I have to be truthful and say I do not recall those sort of\nthings.",
        "A: My father was Ludwig Meyerstein. He was born in Rosslau, Germany in -- on March the 10\",\n1893. My mother was Alice Meyerstein, born Alice Eisner, and she was born in a -- a place\ncalled Gutentag, in Upper Silesia, Germany, on the 29\" of June, 1910.",
        "A: How they met I don\u2019t know, I rather suspect it was one of these arranged marriages. Both my\nfamilies -- both my parent\u2019s families were financially very well off, and I can only conclude that\nit was assumed that this would be a good way of having a marriage. My mother never discussed\nit, in fact she probably talked to my wife years later on things which she didn\u2019t discuss with me.\nBut how they actually met, and -- I don\u2019t know, I rather think it was a -- an arranged marriage,\nbut how that was done, if -- if my assessment 1s correct, I have no idea.",
        "A: Yes, he was -- he served in -- four years in -- in World War I, together with an older brother,\nwho also served fo -- four years, and a younger brother, who was also in -- in World War I, but\nwho did not come back, he was killed in -- in 1918, I think, a week or two before Armistice Day,\nand was listed as missing 1n action, and never -- never found again, actually. So there were three\nbrothers, of which my father was one, went to the wars, in 1914 - \u201918, and only two came back.",
        "A: My -- I -- I -- I think my father\u2019s younger brother was in an infantry regiment. My father and\nhis elder brother, Hugo -- and I should say that my father\u2019s younger brother, the one who was\nkilled in 1914 - \u201918, was called Hans, and that was why I was originally called Hans, because my\ngrandmother wanted to have a -- a grandson following that name. My father and his elder brother\nHugo both served in cal -- cavalry regiments to begin with, and Is -- I don\u2019t know how far the\ncavalry went, because as you know, things changed, and cavalry re -- regiments then became\nextinct almost, and presumably went into infantry regiments. My father\u2019s elder brother Hugo\ncame out at the end of the war as a captain, and my father ended the war, I think, as a second\nleftenant.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I -- I -- I think they both did, I do not know where they served. I believe it was always on the\nwestern front, because I think that my father would have mentioned something if -- if -- if it had\nbeen elsewhere on the eastern front at that time. I have my father\u2019s military b-book, you know, of\nthe class of -- of 19 f -- I can\u2019t think what they call it now, class of 1914, or -- or something like\nthat. But it doesn\u2019t show exactly where all these things were, it wa -- just like a military record\nbook, which I had years later in the British army, when I was drafted. But I\u2019ve also since, in the\nlast -- since my father\u2019s death, found my grandfather\u2019s military book, and he was in the class of\n1879, in the militia, in an artillery regiment. So, on my father\u2019s side of the family, military\nactivity was not a -- an unusual activity, despite what the -- the Germans said, that there were\nthat few -- not that many Jews volunteered or fought, that was totally incorrect. I do recall that\nmy father mentioned to me that he provi -- that his father, my grandfather, provided the horses,\nand gave them money and so forth, because in the units which they had to serve, particularly\nsince they ultimately ended up in -- with -- in the commission rank, that required more funding,\nand my parents were obviously in -- in a position to -- to -- to -- to -- to -- to provide that. The\nother thing which I found rather interesting, contrary to what I sometimes read, is that my father,\non one or two occasions, and these were things which we could always discuss, said to me that\nwhen he entered the -- the cavalry regiment, or was in -- was -- w-was organized to go to this\nunit, that the -- the colonel of the regiment said to him, \u201cWell, Meyerstein, you can\u2019t say that\nthere are any anti -- anti-Jews here, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d So again, I find it\nsometimes a bit awkwa -- difficult to understand when I read various documents, as to what took\n-- actually took place. Obviously there were anti-Jewish Germans, and there were Germans who\ndidn\u2019t view this in any shape or form. Whether that\u2019s normal, I can\u2019t say actually, you know.",
        "A: And they -- and my brother -- and one other thing which I think you might find interesting --\nand this was apparently -- this wa -- given to me by my mother, who had a very good\nrelationship in terms of -- of f-friendship with my father\u2019s brother, 1s after World War I, when\nthe German army was reorganized -- this was told by my Uncle Hugo to my mother, they got in\ntouch with my Uncle Hugo, who obviously had a very good military record, and said, \u201c\u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t you come back into the German army?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, you know, I\u2019m Jewish.\u201d And -\n- and apparently they said to him, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you just say you\u2019re Christian, it won\u2019t any\ndifference,\u201d and -- and left it. He didn\u2019t, of course, do that. What I\u2019m getting at it\u2019s so peculiar\nand so strange in what subsequently took place.",
        "A: My father\u2019s family had a -- what you would call a small department store in Rosslau. They\nwere the only Jewish family in this entire community. In fact my grandmother, my f-father\u2019s\nmother, was also born in this -- in Rosslau, and I have the documents, the birth certificate, and\nthe marriage certificate to my grandfather, also 1-in -- in my files. And apparently he was quite\nsuccessful in that respect, and -- and was continued, I think, until the German -- until the Nazis\ncame to power, and of course ultimately that was all taken away from them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No. No -- not at all.",
        "A: Absolute -- I -- I -- I would have to say yes, because I have -- if you look at the birth\ncertificates, and the marriage certificates of both sides of my grandparents, you will find that the\nnames are all traditional German names. M-My father is Ludwig. My elder -- his elder brother\nHugo, my -- hi-his younger brother Hans, the one who was killed, and who I was named af --\nHans. My grandmother was named Rosian, which literally trans -- mean little rose. My -- my\ngrandfather was Max. If you look at his parent\u2019s birth certificates, 1t\u2019s Magnus, which 1s really\nlike a Latin name, and the grandmother, I think was -- great-grand -- was Regina. But this also\napplies to my father\u2019s -- grandmother -- my mother\u2019s grandparents in like manner. So when\npeople say to me, well what Jewish names did they have, I have to be honest and say I don\u2019t\nhonestly know. My mother, for example is Alice, spelled the same way in English as it 1s 1n -- in\n-- in German, except in German it\u2019s a different pronunciation. So the documents which I have\nfinally found among my father\u2019s papers, after a long time, so far I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve sor -- deciphered\nthat they\u2019ve gone back to about 1822, and they\u2019re all -- the Christian names, the first names,\nwere all literally almost -- you could say either they were English or they were German, but\ntotally integrated. And I suspect that that -- the shock of what subsequent happened, they\nprobably couldn\u2019t believe what was taking place.",
        "A: Well, I would call it a department store in the like manner, and I have seen pictures of it a\nlittle bit.",
        "A: No, my father -- my father became a barrister and a judge, moved to Halle, where I was\nultimately born, practiced criminal law. And ironically -- Halle is a very big chemical loca --\narea, even I think to this day. And 1-ironically, which I didn\u2019t realize, he never discussed it, but\nmy mother mentioned it to me, and also my cousin who lives in Australia, whose mother is my\nfather\u2019s -- was my father\u2019s sister, told me that he was also the outside counsel for I.G. Farben, the\nbig German chemical company, which ultimately made the -- the material which was doing the\ngas chambers. Course, this all -- we\u2019re not talking about that particular period, we\u2019re talking in\nthe -- in the 30\u2019s and so forth. So my father had a very successful, an-and according to my\nmother was a very well known criminal barrister 1-in Halle.",
        "A: Ah, yes.",
        "A: 735.",
        "A: My -- my mother\u2019s parents lived, as I mentioned, in -- in Gutentag, which is an interesting\nname because it means good day, or good morning -- in Upper Silesia, almost on the -- on the\nPolish border. My -- she had one brother called Lota, and her father was Ludwig Eisner, and my\ngrandmother, my mother\u2019s mother, was Rosa Eisner. They owned what you would call a farm\nequipment wholesale business. And I have pictures, I found pictures. I have no idea how they\nmanaged to keep these particular pictures, or bring them with them considering all the other\nproblems which they were experiencing. Where my grandfather had -- you could see the trucks\noutside his -- th-the fi -- th-the family business and home, with the telephone number, and on the\ntruck, branded names of things like percil and so forth, even American products. They did farm\nequipment, I would sort of say, you know, which supplied the farming community, which was\npredominantly Polish speaking, although this Upper S-Silesia was of course Germany, and had\nbeen for 150 years or so. And very successful as well.",
        "A: Well, actually, he was initial -- he was arrested twice. The first ti -- my fa -- my father\u2019s sister\nemigrated with her husband to Australia as a result of friends which they had who -- who helped\nthem there. And one of the -- also from Germany, also German Jews. And one of the German\nJews had some business things which were required to -- to be handled, and I believe, and this 1s\nonly -- I\u2019m only surmising this, cause we never di -- I only heard this from my mother, my father\ntook over some activities. This was, or been public perhaps early \u201938 or so. And for some reason\nor another, you know, at that time, the -- the German government was already starting to try and\ntake money, or -- and various other things from -- from German -- from German Jews, and their\nbusinesses. And he was arrested and held for six weeks in Halle -- but it was obviously nowhere\nnear anything which subsequently took place -- and was released. And then, I think after Kristall\nnight, which was in the latter part of 1938, my father was arrested and taken to Buchenwald. My\nmother\u2019s father was also arrested and taken to Buchenwald. My father\u2019s -- my mother\u2019s brother,\nLota, was also arrested and taken to Buchenwald. And they found each other there, of all -- I\nmean, most incredible, found each other. All three got out. Now, you have to remember, my\nfather was a first World War veteran, my grandfather, my mother\u2019s mother -- father was also a\nveteran. And I have subsequently read books and documents which indicate that the Germans\nbasically said to some of these people, \u201cBecause of your activities as, you know, in World War I,\nwe're going to let you go. But you have so many days or weeks, and if you are still here in\nGermany, then we -- if when we re-arrest you again, we\u2019ll never -- you\u2019 Il never get out.\u201d So I\nbelieve my father must have got out, probably in early 1939. I don\u2019t know which day, and my\ngrandfather. My Uncle Lota also got out, but I don\u2019t know exactly when, and under what\nconditions, but they did, and I have proof of the fact, perma -- documentation that my father then\napplied for visa to the United States in, I think, February of 1939. So between Kristallnacht and\nentry into Buchenwald, and now it must have been somewhere between that time, and shall we\nsay the end of January, or -- so he was rather lucky to get out at that time.",
        "A: That would have been somewhere in 1938, I go -- I believe.",
        "A: But before Kristallnacht.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I -- yes, I -- I think you\u2019re right, but I think the motivating factor might have come more\nfrom my aunt\u2019s husband, as distinct from other things. My mother has mention -- mentioned to\nme on several occasions as a boy when I asked questions, that I think sometime in \u201938 -- when, I\ndon\u2019t know, I think before Kristallnacht, okay, that the families got together. My father\u2019s family,\nof which really, was really in my grandmother, because my -- my grandfather on my father\u2019s\nside, died in 1929, so th -- you know, none of this would have applied, got together, and sort of\nsaid what we could -- what -- what should we do, because at that time you still, from what I\u2019ve\nbeen given to understand from my mother, you could still take out all your money and\nbelongings without any problems. But they couldn\u2019t come to any conclusion. And you have to\nremember, from my father\u2019s side of the family, it was -- I have the documents to the early 1800\u2019s\nand my father always used to say to me it was even before, you know whe -- they were more\nGerman than the Germans.",
        "A: Okay, if you want to put it this way. Now, I don\u2019t th -- I don\u2019t think that that was quite as di --\nas long on my mother\u2019s side of the family, because I understand that from their aspects, my\nmother\u2019s grandfather, m-my gra -- my great-grandfather came from Poland in the days when\nPoland was under Russian law, and rode across the border into Germany, into -- into Silesia.\nBecause in those days the Russians used to call people up for military service, and it wasn\u2019t just\na two year stint, it was 20 years before they were released. So I suspect that they -- his parents,\ngreat-great-grandparents, sort of said you\u2019d better get out and -- and -- and go somewhere else.\nBut, if you follow what I\u2019m getting at, it\u2019s that depth of -- of period. But my parent, when they\nhad the meeting with -- with the two families, obviously couldn\u2019t come to lo -- to a conclusion.\nWe\u2019re sitting here today saying why not? I can\u2019t answer that question.",
        "A: I -- I get the impression from her mother that -- th-the -- the women on the one hand wanted\nto go, and the men -- you have to remember that my father was a very successful barrister, even\nthough things had already declined, I don\u2019t know to what degree how far. Everything which I\nread, where everything is stated, regulations do this, yes it\u2019s true, but things still somehow, how\ndid they manage to survive and live with no income coming in? Because although things were\ntightening, you could still spend money, if you had it.",
        "A: And, you know, perhaps they just thought that this was just an aberration.",
        "A: Well, I understand on my mother\u2019s side, her mother, and my mother wanted to go. My\nfather\u2019s mother was not enthusiastic, but I don\u2019t know that, I\u2019m just giving you comments which\nmy mother said to me.",
        "A: No. I can only tell you that my mother went to pick him up, so she must have been notified.\nAnd she had to go by train because Halle to Buchenwald is not, you know, a -- a bus ride. And\nmy mother said that nothing happened to her physically, they were just, you know, they just told\nto go sit in a corner in the -- of the waiting room, or wherever. Of the entrance or whatever it\nwas. Nobody bothered her, but nobody was very -- nobody was terribly polite, but nobody was\nterribly rude, they just said go sit over there, and -- and -- and that was it. And I have to assume\nthat it was done by train. My mother said that, you know, from that day onwards, my father --\nthere were no -- no more argument about leaving. And I have to conclude that -- that my father\nwas too stunned and shattered at what had happened. And even though he\u2019d been four years in\nthe first World War, I have to conclude that there was -- the -- what -- what he saw and\nexperienced in Buchenwald had no comparison to what we read about, what took place in World\nWar I, where it was strictly military and -- and not the other scenarios, but he was on th -- we\nnever discussed that, he -- he -- he could not -- he could not --",
        "A: No, or he wouldn\u2019t talk about it, let\u2019s put it that way.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s an interesting aspect, yes. My grandfather, on my -- ma -- my mother\u2019s father,\nhad some relatives who had emigrated to the United States. I think it would have had to be in the\nvery late 18 -- the latter part of the 1800\u2019s. How they got in touch with these relatives, I really\ndon\u2019t know, but they did. And where the exact relationship was I don\u2019t know, because I\nultimately met these people in the United States, and they were the ones who provided the\nsponsorship bond documents. And they couldn\u2019t really explain the exact relationship as to how --\nwhether it was their mother, mother\u2019s mother or so. And as you know, when people went\nthrough Ellis Island, names got changed, or people married each other on the boat, I -- I really\ncan\u2019t te -- I\u2019m sorry, I really can\u2019t tell you how that happened, other than that two of the relatives\n-- and I have [indecipherable] gave me some of the documents, which I didn\u2019t know",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t -- I\u2019ve met them. Years later I met them, and they viewed me as very distant, we\nviewed each other as very distant cousins, but none of us could exactly explain where the\nconnection -- the third person shown on those documents, I have no idea, other than it was\nobviously a very generous individual.",
        "A: Yes. Edna Cohn, when I met her was already in her -- I -- either late 60\u2019s or early 70\u2019s and\nwe\u2019re now talking over 30 - 40 years ago, almost -- or -- or longer. Edna was not married, and\napparently she spent her life in -- in a stockbroking -- most of her career in a stockbroking office.\nWhen we met it was in California, not in Chicago, they\u2019d retired for health or weather reasons.\nSamuel Fox was married to Edna Cohn\u2019s sister, Miriam. Samuel Fox was not a relative, or any\nconnection, but he was married to Miriam, and had been a pharmacist in [indecipherable] and --\nand had his own business in Chicago. Aaron Stein, also from Chicago, who is the third affiant\nhere shown in the documents, I don\u2019t know who that is, other than obviously a very generous\nperson. They put up the money for the bonds, which enabled my parents and my grandfather,\nwhere the connection was, Ludwig Eisner to -- to put applications in, and I believe the -- the sort\nof certificates, the -- what do they call them, visa application numbers are the ones shown here as\nwell, for the three of us. This document also shows Ludwig Eisner, which the museum here\ndidn\u2019t know who it was, although it was -- he was listed in all the -- the museum documents. But\nhe happened to be my grandfather, and he\u2019s shown here actually.",
        "A: And they didn\u2019t know that. They do now.",
        "A: These three people, yeah --",
        "A: Didn\u2019t even know my parents existed.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Not my father, would have had to be from my grandfather, because he -- Ludwig Eisner, my\nfather\u2019s father-in-law.",
        "A: Yes, and I -- how that ever happened, how they got th -- th -- how they traced each other, I\ndon\u2019t honestly know.",
        "A: And they didn\u2019t know themselves, when I met them years later. And -- and the re -- the\nrelationship was -- was tremendous. And years later Edna Cohn and her sister Miriam Fox,\nvisited England, and at that time -- to see my parents, and at that time my parents financially\nwere in a position to repay --",
        "A: -- the bond. And I have comments -- I have letters in my -- in my father\u2019s papers, which I\nfound in -- in -- really in the last year or so, because where my parents -- my father died six\nweeks short of 93, and my mother subsequently, almost 20 years younger, died two ye -- in\n2001, at 91 and a half. So you imagine, I had almost a hundred years worth of com --\namalgamated documents to look through, that which had survived, and so forth. And I found\nletters which Edna Cohn [indecipherable] written to my father in England, to sort of say -- they\nwere still sending them some money, not to worry about that, so I imagine that must have\ndepressed my father considerably.",
        "A: But they were able to repay that.",
        "A: Pve no idea.",
        "A: I -- in -- in terms of -- of today\u2019s currency, I don\u2019t know what the cost, the Holocaust Museum\nprobably, would know what a bond for a visa -- I mean, it was a standard, I would imagine, a\nstandard visa bond. What it was, I don\u2019t really know, translated into 2004 currency valuations\ntoday, I would imagine is -- might be somewhat more expensive, I don\u2019t know. But it was very\ngenerous of them. And if 1t hadn\u2019t been for them, we probably wouldn\u2019t have been sitting here.",
        "A: Okay. I don\u2019t know a great deal of how it was done. I can only conclude from my mother\u2019s\ncomments, that the moment my father was released from Buchenwald, and them -- and 1-in -- in\nsimilar manner, I suspect, although probably not on the same day, my grandm -- my mother\u2019s\nfath -- my grandfather on my mother\u2019s side. They didn\u2019t really have much choice about leaving,\nbecause that which I\u2019ve read in more recent times would indicate that they were probably told\nyou have a minimum period of time, and if we find you again, you have to go. We\u2019re -- we\u2019re --\nwe'll arrest you and -- and you\u2019ll never be let out again. How they got tickets on the St. Louis,\nwho organized that, and in what manner, I don\u2019t know. I do know that my parents -- and this is\nonly what my mother told me, that they already knew that they would have to leave, even though\nmy father and my grandfather were in Buchenwald, something would have to be done, or\nimmediately after Buchenwald. And my grandmother -- my -- on my mother\u2019s side, came down\nfrom Gutentag, presumably to Halle, and they went -- they bought things, including jewelry,\nwhich they sewed -- from what I\u2019m told, stitched into furnitu -- into the furniture, cause in those\ndays, and this is where the anomaly is so incredible is, you could take everything that you had, or\nyou could buy it. So they took two complete containers, which I would be -- the equivalent of\nsay -- I don\u2019t know what a container in those days would be viewed. Today, two con -- small\ncontainers would be 20 foot containers, which I gather was furniture, stove, fridge, whatever. In\nfact, \u2019ve often wondered about it, and said to my mother, why on earth would you take electrical\nappliances, that don\u2019t apply when we ended up in -- in -- in England, and -- and so forth. Clo --\neverything which they had. And these all came on board the -- the St. Louis with us. We never\ngot them at the end, but I mean, that -- that\u2019s a different story, and we can get to that in due\ncourse. How they did that, I don\u2019t know. I think the jewelry, and it was viewed as being a\ndangerous thing, but they didn\u2019t think that people would -- the -- the Germans would be tearing\nopen the -- the -- the -- the furniture and so forth. They might check your clothing, but they\nwouldn\u2019t do anything else. And that was -- they hope would, if they got to wherever they were\ngoing, they could then sell those things and which -- provide some money. Because as you know,\nwhen we left on the St. Louis, I think -- I don\u2019t know what the amount was, probably, you know,\nfive or six U.S. dollars at that time -- or I don\u2019t know, not much more. So in other words, you\nhad money when you -- before you left the ga -- the dockside, you climbed on the St. Louis, and\nyou had nothing left at the time, so we -- we had no money on -- on that. Everything had already\nbeen paid for on the St. Louis. But how that actually happened, I really don\u2019t know. At th -- it\nwas never explained to me, and I -- I\u2019ve asked my -- I have some cousins in Australia from my\nmother\u2019s side, and they don\u2019t know. They know even less than I do.",
        "A: Not a great deal. I -- I gather that I was apparently -- I got lost on -- it was -- it was like a\nluxury liner. Perhaps the word luxury\u2019s a bit too strong, but it was -- it was a very pleasant cruise\nship. It was like -- for b -- I -- a-again, and it\u2019s not something that my parents discussed with me,\nbut what I\u2019ve subly read is, you know, it was used for -- people would, in better times, go on\nholiday. And apparently I -- I got lost somewhere, and that caused a great panic for my mother,\nand then they found me, or my grandfather found me, and with no problem. But that\u2019s about the\nonly thing I can remember. I\u2019ve got one or two pictures, but they really aren\u2019t -- three or four,\nthat you wouldn\u2019t know it\u2019s the St. Louis, it -- a-and they\u2019re not in groups of people, and quite\nfrankly, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t have a big recollection on that.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not convinced that they did. I think my father -- I think my father was too\nstunned.",
        "A: I ga -- the pictures which I have, and there are only about two or three, I can see a cor -- wh-\nwhe -- when -- when people were taken to Buchenwald, s -- as I understand it, you know, it was\nlike a -- you know, it was already -- it wasn\u2019t a death camp as they subsequent became, but it was\nalready a death camp, so everybody got shaved. And I -- and when we -- the pictures on the St.\nLouis with my father, you can see his hair growing back again, but he looked still, quite gaunt.\nMy grandfather was always bald, and so you can\u2019t tell from those pictures. And of course,\nthey\u2019re all dressed again in -- in clothes and suits and ties and so forth. But you can see in my\nfather\u2019s picture, at least I can, perhaps to me, th-the trauma of what had happened, and I\u2019m not so\nsure that he took them. He -- he -- for years he didn\u2019t want to be photographed, and whether that\nwas a reminder of the way these things happen, I don\u2019t know. Even in better times, you know.\nBut I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t think so. He wouldn\u2019t be standing around. He -- he was not the -- he\nwas not an outward going person. My mother was, he was more reserved. Perhaps it related to\nhis profession, perhaps it related to his -- he was a 19\" century person, having been born before\nthe turn of the century. And I -- I -- he once said to me that, you know, he -- he didn\u2019t like the\n20\" century at all, which of course is understandable. He was much more comfortable in -- in\nthat era. And wit -- wi -- reflects itself in the -- the relationship which we had together. It actually\nchanged a little bit when we had grandchildren -- when I had grandchildren, which of course he\nalways used to say to me he never thought he would have because he was so much older in that\nrespect. And he lived long enough to s -- to see my eldest daughter go to university, which of\ncourse was a great thing for him.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: No, my father discus --",
        "A: -- scussed not a single thing. No, we could never talk on those matters, and my mother asked\nme not to. I tried once as a -- as a mid-teenager, and my father started to get emotionally very\nupset. And my mother came in the room, and -- and saw what was happening, gathered what was\nhappening, and just pulled me to one side and said, don\u2019t ask, and stop it, and I said I\u2019m sorry,\nand he calmed down and that was the end. We could talk on other matters, prior to 1933. Now,\nthe -- the horrendous things didn\u2019t really affect -- didn\u2019t happen till somewhat later, but in\nlooking back it\u2019s that period which he -- obviously he could not look. But he ca -- but as time --\nas the years went by, he mellowed -- not that we could talk about these things, whereas my\nmother still retained the emotional problems which I suspect she experienced having to wi --\nwatch this in a more active role than I did, as a small boy.",
        "A: Entirely from -- entirely answers to questions which I posed over a few -- period of few -- of a\nfew years. Now, in England, when we had -- and we can come to that later, but in England,\nwhere we ultimately ended up at, there again was not a Jewish community per se, and there were\nalso a few other German refugees. Mostly women whose husbands had -- had -- had been left\nbehind, or couldn\u2019t get out, and they got together -- and because my mother was -- I was a small\nboy, and you -- you know, the days of leaving with babysitters was unheard of, so I was always\ncarted around, and then put in a corner and given a book to read. So I would sometimes hear\nsome of these things which they would talk about. And -- and of course all these things also got\nplayed out, so it was comments as a result, and further comments, and answers to questions\nwhich my mother gave, among a group of three or four other ladies, some a little bit older, with\nno children, but in the same sort of situation.",
        "A: My mother told me -- well, apparently up to the -- up to the arrival in Cuba, it was -- 1t was\nvery -- seemed to be very pleasant, in fact unbelievably, I mean, not that she said that, but when\nyou read the background, you have to really question yourself. Here they are forced out of a\ncountry, and suddenly being, you know, provided with -- with -- with a staff, you know, waiters\nand everything else, at beck and call, considering what was taking place. But I think a great deal,\nfrom what I\u2019ve read, or what I\u2019ve heard, would indicate that the captain of the St. Louis was an\nextremely decent individual, and determined to -- he was determined to -- to have this as if there\nwas no -- no animosity against anybody in particular. And I believe the -- the Israeli government\nhonored him with a -- with a -- with a medal after the war, and I\u2019ve also read that as a result of\nhis activities, he was relieved of command when the St. Louis ultimately returned empty in -- in -\n- to Germany. Never given another command, although he was a career naval officer from World\nWar I days. But he was left alone, which 1s always again, you do -- you\u2019d have thought he\u2019d have\nbeen put on trial for being decent to Jews. That did not happen. So I think a lot the -- the -- the\nway the -- the -- the staff and the crew of the St. Louis conducted themselves, probably in my -- I\ncan only surmise, was the way the captain felt they should handle themselves. So I think the\nvoyage to Cuba probably was very pleasant. The voyage back from Cuba was not so pleasant.\nMy -- my mother told me that things started to go downhill emotionally for people. And I -- I\ndon\u2019t know the name, I can\u2019t recall the name of it, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s listed somewhere, there was one\nperson who threw himself overboard in -- off the St. Louis in -- in -- in the harbor. I think, you\nknow, t-trying to commit suicide, you know. And my mother knew the wi -- or had met the wife\nof -- of that ba -- if -- 1f -- if my memory is correct. Ya -- people talked among themselves\nsometimes, but to what degree I don\u2019t know. On the voyage back, they apparently had to have\ncommittees, which were -- the captain requested the men to form, if they were willing, various\ncommittees which would -- which would sort of patrol the decks, certainly during the night, or\nduring the day and night, to avoid people from trying to commit suicide, and my father -- my\nmother told me that my father was -- was a member of one of these committees. I don\u2019t know\nwhat my grandfather, whether he was that way. It\u2019s just that she responded, or she mentioned\nthat to me, because there was serious -- a -- a serious thought by various people that others would\nperhaps do this. Whether that\u2019s right or wrong I don\u2019t know, actually. I\u2019m not aware that\nanybody did do it, but there was that particular feeling. And of course there must have been, and\nI suspect, although my mother didn\u2019t mention it, a tremendous apprehension as to what was\ngoing to happen, because if the ship really returned to Hamburg again, then -- or wherever we\nsailed, the re -- the results would have been extremely dire.",
        "A: Well, we were never in Havana --",
        "A: You know, in the harbor.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether the passengers at the time knew what was taking place, and I -- I-I\u2019ve\ngot to be careful here now in how I respond to you, because I could be making comments about\nwhat I\u2019ve read.",
        "A: My understanding is that the Jewish relief agency in -- in the s -- in the United States was\ntrying to negotiate --",
        "A: -- the -- with -- with the mexi -- with the Cuban authorities, or the Cuban president, because I\n-- | gather -- and this is only what I\u2019ve read, is that the -- the entry certificates were not signed by\nthe president, but they were signed by Benito, if that\u2019s the -- o-or whoever was the immigration\nminister, and were already ada -- you know, illegal documents, before we ever sailed.",
        "A: Okay. And I don\u2019t know whether -- what would have happened if people had known that. I\u2019ve\nalso read that one or two passengers, who had tickets, Jewish passengers, never believed these\ntickets were valid from the Hamburg American line, and went to the Cuban authorities in Berlin\nor whatever, and got landing visas separately, on their own, before they ever doc -- you know,\nboarded the ship. And the -- and th-these were people who were, in fact, allowed to land. But\nhow far that\u2019s accurate, I don\u2019t know. I suspect -- I can only cou -- my mother certainly had no\nidea, and I could never ask my father, that, you know, they were not going to be -- and all I\u2019ve --\nto be allowed to land, and all I\u2019ve heard is that there were negotiations on -- whether they knew\nthat, on board, I don\u2019t know. The vessel cruised up and down the -- the eastern seaboard. And I\nthink that was done deliberately by the captain from what I\u2019ve read, in the hope that something\nwould materialize. I gather it was really a negotiating tactic, with the -- again from what the --\nwhat I\u2019ve read or seen published, and that the -- the then president of the -- of Cuba couldn\u2019t --\nwouldn\u2019t -- you know, wanted more money and there was a negotiating thing, and then suddenly\nthe negotiation dropped down.",
        "A: What would have happened had one lump sum been offered at that time, and they accepted, I\ndon\u2019t honestly know.",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s very hard to determine at this juncture.",
        "A: Nobody\u2019s alive today. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes, my -- my --",
        "A: -- my mother did mention that, yeah. It was close enough to do that, yes. But I presume that\nhad to be on a clear night.",

        "A: Yeah, she remembered that, yeah.",
        "A: The -- the half dozen photographs which I\u2019ve discovered, or not even that, would indicate that\npeople lou -- walked along the deck, lounged on the deck chairs, read books. That\u2019s about all I\ncan -- she didn\u2019t discuss that in great deal -- and I have to be honest and say I don\u2019t think I ever\nasked her what did you do all day long.",
        "A: No.",

        "A: You know, playing around with other kids, and -- and not a problem.",
        "A: And -- and perhaps my parents -- we were obviously all in one cabin, my parents and myself,\nand my grandfather in another cabin. I have to assume that my parents perhaps made a point of\nnot discussing these satter -- these matters in the evening or with myself in -- present, you know?\nOtherwise, perhaps I might have remembered that.",
        "A: Docks at ham -- at Antwerp.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: No --",
        "A: -- what happened was, from what my mother told me is, when the ship docked, I think it was\nAntwerp, or we -- perhaps it happened before Antwerp. My mother indicated to me that -- that\ntables were set up on the deck of the St. Louis, everybody but -- now then, at that juncture, knew\nthat there were a number of countries in Europe, western Europe who were going to -- to take.\nMy understanding was -- a th -- and my mother said to me there were tables set out. You know,\ntable to England, table to France, table to Holland, takin -- table to Belgium, or whatever it was.\nAnd that you could -- you know, it wasn\u2019t a lottery where names were put into a hat. My mother\nsaid to me that she perhaps, without ra -- you know, thinking and -- about it, said that she might\nhave been tempted, if it had been her choice, to try to go to France, because as a young teenager,\nher father had sent her with her brother to do a tour of Europe in the summertime. Lucky for\nthem, they had the money to do it, and that she\u2019d gone to France, and she\u2019d gone to Italy, you\nknow, as a young teenager, perhaps in her seven -- at the age of 17 or 18, and because of that --\nand she\u2019d learned French at school, not English [indecipherable] that that would have been,\nbecause she\u2019d been there once or so, it would have been nice. My father, apparently, paid\nabsolutely no attention to this, and walked to the English table, and sign up, for which there was\nnot a -- initially, not a big demand. Now, my father could speak a little bit English. He made a\nlife and death decision, either comprehending a little bit of what might happen, because war talk\nwas already in the air, you have to remember. We\u2019re talking now beginning of June, okay, and\nwar didn\u2019t -- took place in September.",
        "A: Okay. Perhaps -- and I\u2019ve often pondered about this myself, m-my -- my mother certainly\ncouldn\u2019t give me an answer. And I thought myself, perhaps my father, from his four years in\nmilitary experience, thought that perhaps being -- th-the 20 miles of channel might be some\ndiversion. I don\u2019t really know. He made that decision, and obviously not one in which he was\nforced to do it, but voluntarily. And it was a life and death decision. So we then ended up in th-\nthe -- in Antwerp, okay. The St. Louis didn\u2019t take us to England, another vessel took us, called\nthe Rocosus, if I am not mistaken. My parents belongings, in these two containers and everything\nelse, were offloaded from the St. Louis, the Hamburg American line, and dumped on the\ndockside. The Rocosus -- and I don\u2019t -- and obviously was not -- I don\u2019t know, it was not a\nHamburg American line, or it didn\u2019t matter, wouldn\u2019t load them onto the boat to Southampton,\nthey demanded money. And my parents, or my father had absolutely no money. And so these\ncontainers remained behind. So other than our cabin luggage, which was put on board, all these\nthings, and I just have often pondered what my parents thoughts were, seeing these, and knowing\nwhat was in there --",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s what my mother told me, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Which would have helped. And having no ability to -- to do anything, must have caused my\nfather even bigger depression, I suspect, you know, or stunned silence. We\u2019ve -- I was able to\ntalk to my mother about this years later, and we just hope that if they were left there, that\nultimately they got bombed. If they were taken to Germany when the Germans marched into\nAntwerp, and they were put into some German storage houses, hopefully they got damaged and\nburned, because they would never have known what they were sitting on. You know?",
        "A: So I -- I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re laughing about -- this wasn\u2019t a laughing matter, I don\u2019t doubt, at\nthe time.",
        "A: And then we took the boat to Southampton. We arrived in Southampton as far as I\nunderstand, and were taken by train. And this is really memory -- not really such accurate\nmemory other -- you know, I\u2019ve read about this. And we arrived in London. And we at -- we\nended up in as -- the four of us -- I\u2019m including my grandfather now, Grandfather Eisner, my\nmother\u2019s father, were put up either in a two, or three, and I really don\u2019t know -- certainly not\nmore -- upstairs in a house, 1n a -- 1n a -- in an area of London called Camden town. The only\nthing which I really remember about this is that directly opposite the front of the house was a\nsmall park on the other side of the street, and that I -- my parents allowed me, or I was able to\nplay there. It -- it was in summertime, we arrived in June -- all the time. And I think that\u2019s where\nI learned my English. Very quickly, because when -- children have that ability, I think, 1f you\nfollow what I\u2019m getting at.",
        "A: And obviously my parents were in no mood to sort of say to me, let\u2019s go sightseeing, let\u2019s do\n-- I\u2019m sure they -- I don\u2019t know why. So I was able to play there, and that\u2019s a recollection which\nI have, obviously a pleasant one. And I have to conclude that that\u2019s where I learned English, and\nm-my -- my mother has said to me that within about four or six weeks, I was fortunate enough --\nand I then began to act as an interpreter --",
        "A: -- for them, you know. Not with understanding, but to respond to the English questions an --\nand so forth, if required, if required. I don\u2019t know who really paid the rent, or provided my\nparents with funds, or my grandfather. My mother alway -- I -- I\u2019m aware that the Jewish relief\nagency would -- did -- did provide some funds, but my mother always spoke very highly of\nQuakers in -- in -- in England, and liberals. Now, when I say liberals, I don\u2019t think she meant it\nin the -- a political context, you know, liberal being democrat or -- or -- or whatever. I think she\nmeant liberal in the sense that there were decent liberal people who felt that yo -- that either part\nof their life was to be -- certainly not Jews, I -- I -- you know, the Jewish relief agency was doing\none thing, Quakers obviously were -- were not Jewish. I think she meant decent liberal people\nwho felt a -- a sense of -- of -- of desire to help people who were in less fortunate circumstances.\nAnd she always talked very highly of that, and they provided some means, but to what -- what\nextent I don\u2019t know. But the Quaker thing, my mother always spoke extremely highly of.",
        "A: Oh, okay. Well, I think I have to go a little bit -- back a little bit.",
        "A: We were all together until war was declared --",
        "A: I-In September. You may be aware of the fact that after the war was declared, the -- the -- the\neng -- British government made a suggestion that children in -- living in the London area might\nwish, depending upon their parents, to be boarded int -- more into the countryside. Be -- I\nsuppose they assumed that London was going to be a target area. And they also said that mothers\ncould go with them if they wanted to. Now how that was conveyed to my parents, I don\u2019t know,\nbut that\u2019s what happened to us. My mother and I went on one of these trains, together with other\npeople re -- other ordinary people from lon -- from the London area. Nothing connected with\nJews or Germans in any shape or form. And I don\u2019t know exactly when, whether it was the end\nof the year, or the beginning of 1940, we ended up in a place called Bedford, which is 50 miles\nnorth of London. And we remained there ever si -- you know, my parents remained there ever\nsince. Now, I don\u2019t know when my father and my grandfather -- they weren\u2019t -- they never said\nthey were arrested, they were interned. It was not like a German arrest, and it was not\nspecifically geared to Jews. It -- all aliens. German aliens, and other ali -- I mean, other aliens,\nAustrian aliens, all connected with -- with Germany, were immediately rounded up, for want of a\nbetter word. Some went to the Isle of Man, some went somewhere else. My father, and I believe\nmy grandfather, went to the Isle of Man. In what particular month or -- or period, I\u2019m not\nabsolutely sure. It must have been -- I\u2019m -- perhaps end of sep -- end of 39, perhaps early \u00b040.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t -- I kno -- he was there, but I don\u2019t know in what period of time.",
        "A: They were both together, interned there.",
        "A: And I\u2019m not sure that they all turned up released. It was not over but -- for my father and my\ngrandfather, I -- I get the impression it was not a long internment. And that\u2019s the one thing which\nmy father, he never referred to it as an arrest. He was able to comment to me about that, and he\nsaid it was really like being in a barracks in the military, and I think he was trying to compare it\nto World War I. And he never spoke ill of that situation, and I suspect if you compare it to what\nhappened in Buchenwald, there were -- you know, there was no comparison whatsoever. I\u2019m\nsure they were interviewed, perhaps several times, and I\u2019m sure there must have been other\nGerman aliens, who may well have been German spies, who lived in England for many years, o-\nor what have you, and they had to be weeded out. But I don\u2019t recall my grandfather or my father\never mentioning anything of what you would call an ill nature. And, you know, the -- the fact\nthat they were sleeping in a barracks or -- or being interviewed, it was not in any shape and form,\nfrom what I gather, similar to what would have happened, or did happen in Buchenwald, and\nwhat subsequently happened.",
        "A: So I never -- and they certainly when I came out, there was no -- it didn\u2019t look -- you know, I\nmean obviously it\u2019s like being in an army camp, but it wasn\u2019t in any other way. And ultimately\nthey both joined us in Bedford. When, I don\u2019t know, and where they came together, I don\u2019t -- I\ncan\u2019t really recall. If it was 1940, then I was already five. And in those days, you went to school\nat the age of five in England. So my concern -- my ma -- mother\u2019s concern wasn\u2019t getting me off\n-- off to school -- and you have to remember, by this time I was speaking English already, and it\nwas not a long distance away, but again my mother spoke that the Quakers in Bedford, it was not\na Jewish --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yeah, I don\u2019t know exactly what -- when that year. The one thing which is interesting,\nthe -- the -- the -- the German air raids on Britain at that time, had re-really started, and I\nremember my mother had a school friend, somewhat older. I used to call her Aunt Margot. She\nwas not married, but she was more like a sister to my -- in other words they were school friends,\nbut the relationship was almost like sisters, okay. And she had fa -- I can\u2019t tell you how, but she\ngot to London on her own, and she was living in London, and my mother apparently contacted\nher and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come and live in Bedford? You can get a job in Bedford. And --\nand come stay with me.\u201d I think my mother was worried, you know, with the air raids, and\nnightly bombing, my father not there, my grandfather not being there. And so Margot Lewin,\nwho had a brother in New York, and was also, I think, hoping to get a visa to the States, which\nultimately came through, but not until World War II was -- was over, and so forth, said all right,\napparently, and -- and came to Bedford, and very shortly got a job in a major manufacturing\ncompany, an ironwork company in Bedford, as a secretary. She obviously knew enough English\nto be able to do these things. And she actually lived with us, and we all lived in one room. And I\nthink it made my mother feel a little bit more safe and secure. I would call her Aunt Margot, you\nknow, and she really became more of an aunt than a real aunt would have been, if you follow\nwhat I\u2019m getting at. And you know, we had nightly bombing raids at -- you know, sometimes\ntwo or three times during the night, and ri -- my mother -- my -- and we were living on the top\nfloor of a -- of a building, of -- of a three story ap -- house, okay? And my mother -- you know,\nyou get very tired when you have to get up and dress and all the rest of these things. And my\nmother said to me -- said to us, and I think it was a general agreement, not bu -- I mean, they\ndidn\u2019t ask for my approval, I was -- that they weren\u2019t going to get up any more. If it was -- if -- I\nthink my mother said if it was God\u2019s will the bomb was going to go down, it won\u2019t make any\ndifference if we\u2019re upstairs or down in the cellar. It\u2019s going to take us all.",
        "A: So we ended up just sleeping through all this, not getting up any more. And we would be\nwoken up by the air raid warning to say that this was -- the -- the planes were coming, or the all\nclear siren, when they were all gone. But, you know, we just didn\u2019t get up any more. My -- my\nmother just made that decision, she said ge -- you kill yourself, I think -- or we will -- we will --\nwe will die out of sheer exhaustion, you know, or I don\u2019t know quite, you know, how it\u2019s --",
        "A: -- anyway, they stayed -- they were -- they were there together, and if fact I visited my aunt in\nNew York -- not -- she\u2019s not my real aunt --",
        "A: -- but if you understand what I mean, many years later, as -- as a married person, when I was\nalready married, and she in fact -- and I then brought her from New York in -- in -- in a car. I had\na business ve -- trip, and I drove to New York for that specifically, picked her up from her\napartment, drove her back to Canada, to Toronto. She stayed with us for two or three weeks, and\nthen we put her on a plane back to -- to New York.",
        "A: And you know, she was -- she was the type of aunt that, you know, if I needed pocket money,\nshe was the one I would turn to. And years later, when I was in the army overseas, after I was\ndrafted in England, she would write to me, and whenever she wrote, she would always put some\nmoney in from New York. So I was exchanging dollars. And she would always put some money\nin it -- she didn\u2019t have any sons or daughters --",
        "A: -- 1f you understand what I mean.",
        "A: She only had nieces, and -- and to her I was really her nephew in that context.",
        "A: She was that close to my mother, you see.",
        "A: I think so. And it was a gr -- and -- and you know, it was very nice. She was the type of aunt\nwho was the accommodating type, in the sense that she made no demands on me. If anybody\nmade any demands, it was me on her. And -- and she was always obliging with -- with -- with so\nforth, so I have my -- my memories of her were -- were -- were very good. Then my father was\nreleased from the Isle of Man, and at that juncture we obviously couldn\u2019t live together. And then\nwe -- we then moved to another --",
        "A: No, well, we were in one room, and w -- and my -- and -- and my mother\u2019s school friend --",
        "A: -- was there. So we had to move, and it was -- and we needed a bit more space, or wer -- we --\nyou know, the landlady was not exactly the greatest. I -- I don\u2019t -- she was a -- she had a temper,\nI don\u2019t mean that she was anti-Jewish, I think she was just a -- not a very accommodating person.\nShe rented rooms out to various other people. And I remember my telling how that one of the --\nthere was an old man living on one of the rooms, and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t take any attention to Mrs.\nMorgan, she\u2019s just naturally irritable.\u201d You know? So it wasn\u2019t anything -- if -- if you understand\nme, it wasn\u2019t anything bi -- against that.",
        "A: She was just making money renting out rooms, okay. And -- but I think the rooms were -- bu -\n- that money came in from either the Quakers, or other liberal people in the -- in -- in Bedford, in\nthe sense of decent people, actually, until such time. And then at some point, and I don\u2019t know\nwhen, probably sometime in the 40\u2019s, my father came to Bedford, was released, so did my\ngrandfather. We -- my mother made arrangements to move to another place where the three of us\ncould be together, not far away from where we were staying. My -- she also made arrangements\nfor my f -- grandfather to have a room by himself somewhere, in another house. And Aunt\nMargot, quote, unquote, also got a room for herself, and we went, and we progressed from there.\nMy father then got a job. The one thing which I have always found very interesting is that we --\nmy parents did not, neither my father, my mother, or my grandfather, particularly after they ki --\nwere released from -- from the Isle of Man were not request -- did not have to go to the police\nstation daily or weekly or monthly in any shape or form. And I gather that that was a -- I -- I\ncould be wrong, but I read somewhere years later, that that was a decision made by Prime\nMinister Churchill to say, look, if we\u2019ve checked these people out, let\u2019s not create a problem.\nWe\u2019ve got more important things to do than worry about having people go -- but whether that\u2019s\naccurate or not, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: But I\u2019m not aware that my parents or my father, or my grandfather had to report on a regular\nbasis to the police. And we were left alone. Nobody ever bothered us. Nobody ever bothered us.\nIn fact, it -- you -- it was perhaps typical English, you\u2019ve got your freedom, you\u2019re on your own\nnow. Which I found rather interesting in today\u2019s context, where immigrants in various countries,\nwhen they arrive, want -- make demands on all sorts of things. We were just only too happy. I\u2019m\nsure my parents, you know, depressed, stunned, whatever, but they were left alone.",
        "A: They did not have to worry about being knocked up in the middle of the night by a police\nwatrant or -- or what have you.",
        "A: And I think that -- I know from my father\u2019s point of view, that that impressed him, years later.\nWe didn\u2019t actually talk about that, but I think he -- he -- his indication was that that -- that was\nsomething which made him, I suspect, feel a little bit better.",
        "A: He was left alone.",
        "A: I think this is --",
        "A: I think you\u2019re right.",
        "A: But it must -- yeah, let me -- I can -- Pll give you a very funny situation [indecipherable] I\nthink you -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s germane to what you\u2019ve just said. We were 50 miles from London, and on\n-- On occasion some -- during the war years, we would take the train to London, my mother and\nI, my father was working, just for a day\u2019s outing. I mean here I\u2019m still at school. I remember we\nwere walking down -- this is quite clear to me -- walking down Oxford Street, which is like Fifth\nAvenue in New York. It\u2019s a bustling community, you know? It wasn\u2019t exactly empty of people,\neven in war time. And suddenly we saw, what my mother explained to me, an extremely\nOrthodox, pious Jew, with a beard and a hat, and I mean, the complete regalia. And my mother\nstopped to look around, and I had to stop and she said, \u201cLook at that.\u201d And the only people\nstopping to look were my mother and myself, and I said, \u201cWell, what is it?\u201d And she said, \u201cBut,\nthat\u2019s an Orthodox Jew.\u201d And I didn\u2019t quite know what she meant at that time. Well I think\nafterwards, years later my -- I -- we talked about this, my mother and I, is that it was so\nincredible, nobody paid the slightest attention. It was not an unnatural event. They -- people just\nall were passing back -- my mother thought it was so unnatural in the -- in the context of what\nshe\u2019d left, to see this. For me, I didn\u2019t really think about this until years later, when I began to\nunderstand what she really meant. But I remember her saying to me, \u201cThat\u2019s a very Orthodox\nJew.\u201d But I think she, a-as I say, she was wondering whether people would accost him, or -- or\naffront him, or something. But he just walked on, and nobody paid the slightest attention, other\nthan ourselves.",
        "A: You know. And other people must have looked at us to see [indecipherable] why were we\nturning to -- looking at somebody else?",
        "A: So that, I think, in answer to your comment, perhaps was the thing which may ult -- may have\nmade my father -- my father never read a German newspaper any more. He only read an English\nnewspaper. We talked in English and German, and as the years went by, we talked more English.\nMy father never wrote a letter to me, other than in English. Neither did my mother. Mind you,\nyou have to remember I couldn\u2019t, if they\u2019d have written a letter in German I couldn\u2019t have read\nit, because until I went to school years later, where -- where I had an option of learning -- I had\nto do French, but I also had an option of doing another foreign language, so I took German, but it\nwas just school reading and writing. And that just -- that\u2019s how it -- you know, my parents never\ntalked to me --",
        "A: No, when -- in that period of time, my father was born in 1893 --",
        "A: -- so we\u2019re talking let\u2019s say, in --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: And I was a small boy, I mean, he could have had a grandson by that time.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, yea -- this is a little bit off -- off the thing, but I think it\u2019s -- again it\u2019s -- it\u2019s relevant to\nyour question. Years later, when I had -- I made a business trip many years later to Germany --\non bus -- you know, to -- for the business discussions. And I thought, well Ill bring him back a\ndecent German newspaper, me -- meaning a quality pa -- newspaper. And I\u2019Il -- and I sat in\n[indecipherable] bookstore, a book in German, which related to the -- to the period prior to\nWorld War I, and I bought it, thinking that he would like it. He barely scanned the paper. He\nlooked at the book. I still have the book, I don\u2019t have the paper, but I still have the book. And he\nlooked at the book and the pictures. I think the title of the book was sort of, you know, Germany,\npre-World War I days, you know, of how people lived and so forth, which he would have\nunderstood. He scanned it, put it awa -- he never read a German book, you know, he -- it was all\nEnglish books, history and everything else. And he -- that was a period he -- I don\u2019t mean that he\nphysically thought about it, and wi -- and made a -- an effort to show people, it just that he did\nnot pay attention any more. He didn\u2019t listen to German newscasts on the BBC, it was always in\nEnglish. Of course his English continued to improve, as you can appreciate, but as far as he was\nconcerned England for him was, I suppose the equivalent of heaven at that moment.",
        "A: In relationship to what he\u2019d experienced, because nobody ever bothered. They didn\u2019t ask.\nEnglish people generally, bit more reserved, so didn\u2019t ask questions. And he wasn\u2019t the type to\nwant to answer, so he was just left alone. They thought he was a very nice person, he was\ncourteous and pleasant, but he wasn\u2019t forced to express himself to anybody. I think that made a\nmajor difference.",
        "A: Well, he couldn\u2019t practice law because English common law, like American common law has\nabsolutely no relationship to German law, so he could never practice his profession, and I think\nhe was too old to -- to start all over again. You have to remember he\u2019d been a judge, and he\u2019d\nbeen a barrister. And there was no relationship, and w -- and we didn\u2019t have the funds, anyway.\nAnd -- and so he took a job in a factory, and you know, he -- but really, I suppose any job, you\nknow, beggars can\u2019t be choosers, to put food on the table, and pay the rent, and -- and -- and so\nforth, and th -- perhaps the one thing which one can say is that whilst he was free to do what he\nwanted, or was free to -- to live quietly, with nobody bothering him in England, that didn\u2019t mean\nthat the English government was going to help him get a job.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: We lived in a one bedr -- one bedroom apartment with a little -- with one gas ring. You don\u2019t\nhave people coming over, if you understand what I mean. We\u2019d had money. For a long time we\nwere -- my mother never had to do this, of course, but I can still remember -- 1n fact, after my\nmother died, and I went through her personal effects, I found the book -- she used to buy little --\nlittle booklets, you know, and inside she daily jotted what she had bought in terms of groceries or\nso forth, because she had to make sure that we had enough money for rent and so forth. She\ncouldn\u2019t stop herself afterwards, even when -- when it wasn\u2019t necessary. They -- it didn\u2019t say \u2019'm\ndoing this. They [indecipherable] no, you know, I mean, it wasn\u2019t exactly a happy thing when I\nwent through these things. I -- I understood what she was about.",
        "A: And if I asked for any money, she\u2019d have to look through her purse and then check the book,\nand -- and say so forth, so no, we didn\u2019t have -- yeah, people might come for a -- an hour or so,\nmy -- my grandfather would come and -- and -- and so forth. But he didn\u2019t have very much, and\nso my mother -- my mother had to go out to work as well, to do housecleaning for people.\nMainly because t-to bring some money in. And my f -- my grandfather couldn\u2019t work, he was too\nold, or it wasn\u2019t possible. His English was not that good, so she would provide -- give him\nmoney for -- he was -- he smoked cigarettes an-and -- and -- and so forth, but we didn\u2019t -- to\nanswer your question in a nutshell, did we have a social life? No. I think my mother, she knew\nmore people as a result of my going to school, because she met other mothers in the process. But\nthat wasn\u2019t what you would call a social --",
        "A: -- although those -- those -- those acquaintanceships continued for many years, if you\nunderstand what I\u2019m getting at, but they were not really what you would call -- where people\nwould socialize, invite each other. We didn\u2019t have the funds and -- and m-my father certainly w-\nwould not have -- he was -- he was too -- he was what I would call today in a clinical depression.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, and I think that that went -- I didn\u2019t realize that until many years later, until I was an\nadult, and even then, it wasn\u2019t until I got much older that I -- I -- I begin to thi -- thought about\nthis, and understand now. He went into depressions at weekends more than during the week. And\nthere were several times a -- I -- I rather think that my mother thought that he was going to try to\ncommit suicide.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t. But he would leave the house on a Saturday morning sometimes, you know, he\nworked from Monday to Friday. He\u2019d get up in the morning, no breakfast -- this didn\u2019t happen\nall the time, there were -- it was like a sort of periods, for no reason, and you have to remember\nhis brother was still there, his mother was there. His -- his sister was in Australia, so that was\nokay. And he would go away. Now, we lived in a town where there was a -- a -- a river, was a\nvery nice little country town, bit like Alexandria down the road, but a little bit broader, with\nbridge and a major river running down, where every summer they\u2019d have a huge regatta, and still\ndo to this day. Think it was the third biggest regatta in -- in England, and every year. And it was\nsort of three miles on one side of the embankment, we\u2019d call it, and three miles on the other. And\nin summertime it was very nice, with benches down there, and I -- I can remember they used to\nhave a -- a bandstand, and you know, they\u2019d play military marches. I mean, that was to keep\npeople\u2019s spirits up, you know? And he\u2019d go out, and come four o\u2019clock, or so, 3:30, my mother\ndidn\u2019t know where he was. I don\u2019t know why sh -- the population was what, between 50 and\n80,000. Still really not much more than 80 or 90,000 to this day. It\u2019s the -- it\u2019s the county town of\n-- of Bedfordshire. And I don\u2019t know where my -- where my mother got the idea that I would\nfind him, and I didn\u2019t know where to look, but perhaps it oc -- I don\u2019t know why, it occurred to\nme on -- once, that perhaps he might want to go and sit down on the -- on the bench, and perhaps\nthat -- I didn\u2019t know where to go, up and down streets, you know, [indecipherable] find -- and\nsure enough I found him there. He\u2019d generally sit there on a bench. He would just be sitting\nalone. And I\u2019d come up, and he still wouldn\u2019t talk, and I'd say, well it\u2019s time for -- for supper,\nyou know, for dinner, or supper or something like that. Mom said it\u2019s ready, you -- and he -- we -\n- we got up and walked, but we didn\u2019t talk. That happened on several occasions. I don\u2019t mean, ru\n-- you know, every other month. That happened on several occasions over a period of about --\nperhaps between nine and 11 or so. And several, I don\u2019t mean a huge amount, perhaps two or\nthree or four times.",
        "A: But that actually would da -- yeah -- no --",
        "A: -- I didn\u2019t really quite know, no, I just thought my father was a moody individual --",
        "A: -- I mean, I -- I realize, of course, it wasn\u2019t actually.",
        "A: But that gradually eased to the point that eventually that never happened any more.",
        "A: Yeah, the first school I went to was like a -- like a typical public school here, you know, grade\none, two. Two -- I think grade -- grade one we went in at five, and then at age 10 you went onto a\n-- what would be the middle school, or something like that, okay. Yeah, I did, but it wasn\u2019t an\nanti-Jewish thing, it was because of my na -- m-my German surname. I mean, John was,\neverybody understood that, and I\u2019d occasionally get called, you know, German sausage or\nsomething like that, you know, but I mean these things happen. And you know, there was a time\nwhen I was probably having a fistfight, but not because it was anti-Jewish. I\u2019d reached a point\nwhere I wasn\u2019t going to take this, or couldn\u2019t take this any longer. And you know how kids are,\nthey can bully. Now you ha -- you -- you either come to a conclusion that you have to -- you\nhave to face this up, and -- and I never discussed this with my parents, you know. There wasn\u2019t\nmuch point, my father was working, my mother was working, he was going to, you know --",
        "A: -- and but you know, there was a -- there was a period where I sort of had regular fights, but it\nwas -- but I wasn\u2019t the only one having these, these characters were doing this with other kids\nthat -- you know, for whatever reasons. And it reached a point where ultimately, I must have\nobviously defended myself on my own sufficiently, that you become friends with the bully, and\nyears later we would say hello to each other. You know, bullies, when they get taken on straight\nin, and not backing off as well, they go to the -- to the weakest. I think it was really a choice of\neither taking a -- a whacking each time, or having to try and see if you could defend yourself,\nand I -- I -- I -- I\u2019ve told my wife this, I had to know I -- whether I -- whether I hit and bit and\nkicked to the point where they didn\u2019t want that happening, and gradually, over a period of time,\nth-that was left alone. That didn\u2019t continue indefinitely. But it was no -- I suppose a bit\nunderstandable. Meyerstein, that\u2019s a German name, German sausage, you know?",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They did. When we moved -- when we moved to -- you have to remember this 1s not a big --\nBedford was not a big town. Lewton, which was 20 miles away, was the home of General\nMotors, okay, but Bedford was the hub of a -- had a major railway station, it was a hub area for a\nlot of trains coming in and out, and I think they were always trying -- and about 20 minute -- 15\nminutes away by car, was the intake for all the RAF -- Air Force personnel, entering the -- the\nRAF, you know, if you understand what I\u2019m getting at. So there were --",
        "A: Targets. And sometimes, of course the -- the -- the air raid warnings would come on if they\nheard planes flying overhead, even if they were not been a target, Bedford. And there was one\noccasion, not when we were on the third floor, but when we were on the second floor m -- of my\n-- just before my father came to join us, I -- I think, cause that\u2019s the time we would have moved\nthere, there was one really major bombing raid, and they were obviously going for the railway\ntracks. And the landlady and my mother, and I -- and this wasn\u2019t a big house, all got up and --\nand we went into the living room, and you know, they had these old antique dining tables, round\ndining tables, you know, solid, you would probably need six people to lift them. And I remember\nmy mother pushing me under the table, and she and the landlady got underneath, because the fe -\n- the -- the -- I think the feeling was, if the ceiling was coming in, the table was thick enough,\nand heavy enough to absorb this. But nothing happened, other than the house shook. But there\nwere time -- but you know, you get used to it. You know, I don\u2019t say that that\u2019s a great way of\ngetting used to things --",
        "A: -- but we got used to -- you can\u2019t panic, that\u2019s -- what can you do?",
        "A: And there were one or two occasions when I would walk to school. In fact, my daughters both\ncalled me at the time after 9-11 [indecipherable] and they were living there in the States, and said\nto me, \u201cDad, what happened when you were a youngster?\u201d You know, and I said, \u201cWell, I went\nto school.\u201d And I said, you know, Grandma was working, Granddad was working, and I was\ncloser to school than anywhere else, what was I going to do to get home, I couldn\u2019t have got in\nanyway. I didn\u2019t have a f -- a key. So I just ran on to school, but I mean, what can you do? You\nknow, they\u2019re high up in the sky, you know. For youngsters sometimes that\u2019s -- it\u2019s a bit of an\nadventure. I -- I don\u2019t mean to demean that, your question or answer.",

        "A: Ya -- you -- I think people have to le -- do learn to control panic now, obviously some people\nma -- take 1t more seriously than anything else. But this wasn\u2019t a daily occurrence.",
        "A: But people do -- it was a war time, that\u2019s why when I mentioned it, I thought my father was\nvery heavily depressed. In today\u2019s context, that would probably be referred to for di -- for\nmedical reasons. You have to remember Britain was the only country left in Europe, alone, and a\n-- a -- America didn\u2019t come into World War II until \u201941, after Pearl Harbor. And that was\ntowards the end of \u201941.",
        "A: So, you know, people didn\u2019t have time to worry about were you depressed or --",
        "A: -- or worried. They had far more worries on their mind. I know that my mother -- if anything,\nmy mother\u2019s worry, where we stayed. W-We lived in this place that she -- the landlady was very\npleasant. Her name -- Mrs. Duncan, I remember her name. And she had a -- her son was a pilot\nflying Mosquito bombers over Germany, and my mother was always terribly afraid that if\nsomething happened to him, Mrs. Duncan would turn on my mother, you know, he didn\u2019t, you\nknow. I -- I don\u2019t know [indecipherable] she was very concerned. But I remember one day -- my\nmother told me this, and I would have been, well, around six, yeah. One day my mother was at\nhome, and there was a knock on the door, and a young army officer bi -- was at the door, and my\nmother opened the door, and he saluted her and said, you know, \u201cIs Mrs. Duncan in? Mrs.\nDuncan?\u201d And my mother said, \u201cShe\u2019s not in.\u201d And he said, \u201cOh, could you tell her, I\u2019m her\nnephew.\u201d You know, also in the military, but in the army side, you know? Saluted her, and wal --\nand said, di -- \u201cWould you let her know I passed by, I\u2019m on leave,\u201d or something like that. \u201cShe\nknows where I am.\u201d And [indecipherable] for my mother to understand.

        "A: They both survived, and I met them years later as I was growing up a little bit, actually, you\nknow.",
        "A: Well I -- no, my rec -- not really, you know my recollections of D-Day were greater --",
        "A: -- because when you look -- well, for the simple reason that when you went to school -- and\nwhe -- when I got up in the morning, there was a mass -- and looked out the window, we\ncouldn\u2019t help it, the planes were enor -- constantly, the sky was full of planes, so everybody\nknew something was happening.

        "A: Mm, yes, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, I think he did, yes.",
        "A: I -- I would imagine so. We didn\u2019t discuss it, I don\u2019t recall that -- I -- th-the one thing which,\nagain, which is interesting in the context of how one views refugees today, when we arrived in\nEngland, they -- and I have these documents still, or booklets, wa -- they -- I don\u2019t know whether\nwh -- whether the Jewish agency gave them out, or whatever. They just said to the -- to th --\neverybody got them, and I found them just recently, that, you know, don\u2019t congregate together --\nand they\u2019re in engla -- in English, but to -- I think to German refugees in particular, don\u2019t\ncongregate together, don\u2019t speak loudly, don\u2019t speak in German.

        "A: Because at that juncture, my father probably wouldn\u2019t have known what happened to my\nfather -- to my mother -- to his mother, and to his brother. No idea, you see. Although we had\nRed Cross letters from my grandmother, up to 1942.",
        "A: And -- but he had no idea, he -- in 1939, when we --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: In 1939, from what I understand, from what my mother told me, my father received a\ntelegram from his -- from his brother Hugo, presumably in ger -- in Germany, I -- I\u2019m not -- I\nassume so, or from somewhere, saying can you do anything to help me? He was married, no\nchildren. Well, my father had no money, and no influence, no way -- and wouldn\u2019t have known\nwhere to turn, let alone anything else. So presumably that cable never got answered. I don\u2019t\nknow where the cable is, I\u2019ve never seen it -- you know, I\u2019ve not found it among the papers.",
        "A: Exactly. The other thing, of course, you have to understand is that my father had the problems\nof his mother and his brother. My mother and my grandfather had the problems of the\ngrandmother, you know, my mother\u2019s mother.",
        "A: My f -- my mother\u2019s brother, Lota Eisner was also at Buchenwald, also got out, and we met\neach other in London before the war started. And he, for some reason or other, got a permit to go\nto Palestine. How it happened, I\u2019ve no idea, he never explained it to me. We met years later and\nhe -- I -- I\u2019ve spoken to his children, my cousins, they don\u2019t know how. And he went to\nPalestine, and ended up in the British army, joined the British army. My m -- the -- I -- my\nmother tells me that the reason -- or told me the reason that her mother didn\u2019t leave was that he\nhadn\u2019t left before we\u2019d left. So she was concerned that her only son would be left behind, so she\nwasn\u2019t going to go, so she put -- forced my f -- ha -- my grandfather to go with us, but she wou --\ndidn\u2019t come. I don\u2019t know, it -- it -- it\u2019s a strange story, okay?",
        "A: And I\u2019Il include this to you because I think you\u2019re going to find this rather interesting. She\nwas left behind, but her son got out before the World War. Well --",
        "A: Her name was Rosa Eisner, okay?",
        "A: She\u2019s in Gutentag, still in her own home, hadn\u2019t been confiscated or anything, you know.\nNow war was declared in \u201939. We were all out, she was alone. That must have been a real\nproblem for my father -- for my mother, and for my grandfather, with no means to do anything\nany more. Pondering, I suppose, and no communication, as far as I know. She got out on a vessel\nwhich sailed from the Baltic during the war. When exactly, I don\u2019t quite know. I don\u2019t know the\nname of it, I know it\u2019s in the Holocaust -- Holocaust Museum, people know about it. It sailed,\nand ultimately ended up with all refugees, the place was packed to the gunwales, I gather, with\nrefugees. I don\u2019t know who the skipper was, it was not a -- I don\u2019t know, from some -- I don\u2019t\nknow. Anyway -- or how the crew was hired, or what have you. It was like a tramp vessel, I\nsuspect. It ended up in Haifa waters. They didn\u2019t want to let it enter, so the vessel blew it itself\nup. My grandm -- mother was on deck when they blew it up, had no idea this was going to\nhappen, they didn\u2019t tell anybody. I mean, that th-the -- the Jews decided it\u2019s the only way they\u2019re\ngoing to have to get ashore. So they blew itself up, the vessel started to sink, or capsize. My --\nmy grandmother told my mother, and my mother told me, they -- and even my cousins don\u2019t\nknow the full story. My grandmother was thrown overboard. She was on deck luckily, not below\ndeck or anywhere. And couldn\u2019t swim, and the cable, as the ship was turning over, cable came\ndown -- you know, these things don\u2019t happen in seconds, and she hung onto this, and you know,\nof course, as soon as the vessel blew itself up, the military all came out to pick everybody up,\nyou know. Picked her up, you know, and picked up the survivors or something, and put them\ninto a military barracks. God knows how -- I don\u2019t know, she said my name is so and so, I have a\nson who is in Palestine. They checked the records, found he was in the British army, contacted\nhim, and said get here, is this your mother? He goes down to the barracks as his -- my mother\nexplained, to where they were all interned. I mean, it\u2019s like a barracks, I mean, with clothing and\nstuff like that. And he says, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s my mother.\u201d And they said, \u201cTake your mother and go,\nand don\u2019t come back.\u201d",
        "A: Yeah. So that\u2019s another story, so we all survived, in that context, except my grandmother on\nmy father\u2019s side, and my father\u2019s brother, you know.",
        "A: But that\u2019s a different story altogether.",
        "A: And we didn\u2019t discover that until years later. My cousins, to this day, don\u2019t quite know how\nthis happened. Now, why my grandmother left, and this is perhaps an even stran -- equally story,\nthey were in Gutentag. It was a predominantly Catholic community, not a big community,\nGutentag was not a big -- you would hardly find it on the map, and I don\u2019t know what the Polish\nname is now. The -- a very rural farming community, which 1s why I think my grandfather must\nhave -- or his father actually started the business, this --",
        "A: -- farm implement, you know, which grew into quite a sizable establishment. And everybody\nspoke Polish. The farming -- th-the Poles, although they were German -- born on German soil,\nstill predominantly ethnic Poles, okay. I think Silesia was taken by the ger -- Prussia in 17 --\nmiddle of the 1700\u2019s or so. Anyway, predominantly Catholic. My mother\u2019s there -- my\ngrandmother\u2019s there alone, as my mother -- mother explained to me, and the Catholic priest --\nthere\u2019s a na -- come -- in the middle of winter, and I don\u2019t quite know when, \u201840 perhaps.\n[indecipherable] must have been, perhaps \u201840, I presume. Yeah, would have been -- would have\nhad to be \u201840. Ag -- dub -- my -- as I understand it, and this is what my mother [indecipherable]\nit, there was a knock on the back door, and you can -- must have been after dark. So you can\nimagine that must have been a major shock to my grandmother, you know, in the -- to get a\nknock -- it\u2019s bad enough to get a knock on the front door, but to get a knock on the back door.\nShe opens the back door, and it\u2019s the parish priest. He comes in, they\u2019re all in darkness. He says,\n\u201cDon\u2019t put on the lights.\u201d And says, \u201cYou know, the Gestapo is coming tomorrow morning t- to\narrest you, or to pick you up.\u201d He had obviously heard this from either his parishioners, or some\nwho were in -- who were Catholics, but were in the Gestapo or whatever. Ye -- ye -- there were\nGermans there as well, but it was a predominantly Catholic community, okay. And you -- you\nbetter be going. Yo -- I suggest you -- you -- you\u2019re not here.",
        "A: And -- and don\u2019t le -- when -- and they talked for a few more minutes I presume, or for\nwhatever period of time, and then he left again by the back door. Apparently then -- no lights on,\nyou know. So apparently she -- it was in wintertime, so she got on -- a-as my mother explains it,\nshe dressed in my father -- grandfather\u2019s trousers, heavy sweater and everything else. It\u2019s snow\non the ground. And -- and in those days people had th -- what they call rucksacks, what we call\nthese little --",
        "A: Backpacks, actually. As much as she could pack together, take whatever she could\n[indecipherable] documents, money, whatever she may have had, and in the middle of the night,\nwalked away.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No -- well, not -- not in a different way. I -- I can give you a better an -- a -- a different a-\nanswer to that. M-My father\u2019s main concern was to make sure that -- always was I would have\nthe best education he could possibly provide, which was pretty limited in those days because we\ndidn\u2019t have the money. Now, Bedford had a -- was a small community of between 50 and 80,000\npeople, and it\u2019s not much more than 80,000 or 90 at the most today. But it had a reputation for\nhaving the two -- in England they call them public schools, but they\u2019re like private schools, of\nthe Ivy League type, and two girl\u2019s schools like this, and a convent, which went up to university\nlevel. And many people sent children as boarding children to these schools, because of the\neducational -- Bedford had a reputation for having an excellent educational system, a private\neducational system. And my father, having no money, nevertheless, wanted to see if he could do\nthe same -- give me that -- or give me that opportunity, and went to see the headmaster, or the\nprincipal of one of these two boys public schools, there were no girls, I mean, they\u2019re separate\nactually. These are both Anglican, high Anglican schools, if you understand high Anglican in\nthat context.",
        "A: The principal was in fact, an Anglican priest, but a teacher as a career, but had -- but had also\nbeen a -- had also become a priest. And my father had a private interview with him, I understand,\nexplained the circumstances. The principal said, send your boy in. If he takes a test like anybody\nelse and passes it, we -- it would -- it\u2019s -- 1t wa -- 1t was one of these schools which had a great\nalumni, which --",
        "A: -- yeah, and it was a 400 year old school. I passed the exam, which I don\u2019t think was that high\na standard, nevertheless, and at the age of 10 in 1940 -- in -- 11 in 1946, I entered the school. I\nused to walk to school every day, I was a day boy, and the school never sent a bill.",
        "A: The school was called Bedford Modern School. It was first chartered in, I think, 1566 by then\nLord Mayor of London, who had been born in Bedford. The school still inherits the -- the rents\nfrom the land which this former Lord Mayor endowed to the school, together, so that\u2019s where\nthey get all these -- you know, the o -- the -- plus the -- the other alumni scenario, and not a word\nwas ever mentioned or raised.",
        "A: And nobody was dis -- it was never discussed in the school, and --",
        "A: Never singled out in any way.",
        "A: And I think there were about -- in total about two or three other Jewish boys at the school. If\nyou -- if you did not want to attend an-and that was the type of school where it still does, I think.\nWell, I\u2019m not sure whether it does it any more now. The school had about a thousand -- between\n700 and a thousand boys at all time. Every morning at nine o\u2019clock, the hall was filled with a --\nthis is really -- and you'll find this interesting -- was filled with the boys and the masters. Th-The\n-- the headmaster, the principal, would walk with cap and gown, everybody [indecipherable]\nmasters in caps and gown, would walk through the center of the hall, and the whole school\nwould ri -- ri -- stand up bec -- in -- in courtesy to the headmaster, and he would go up on the\ndais, and then there would be a small reading, and a small two or three minute sermon, some\ndiscussions, and a prayer which act -- ironically was always interdenominational, it didn\u2019t really\nhave any great things, and then it\u2019s [indecipherable] been, you know, after that was done --",
        "A: -- and if you wanted to attend, you could. If -- nothing was ever said if you didn\u2019t want to\nattend. Everybody did. We all did. Cause there was really no reason not to. There was -- you\nknow, we -- and nobody ever attempted to proselytize, or to try and convert, 1t was just --\nbecame a matter of courtesy that we all attended. And -- and I mean, nobody knew who was\nwho.",
        "A: If you understand what I mean.",
        "A: And I\u2019ve gone back, visited the school from time to -- I mean, 1n odd years over the years,\nand -- and -- and they\u2019ve told me that they sometimes find parents who -- who\u2019ve come in and\nsaid -- cause now the fees have gone up much higher than they are a -- and I said, \u201cWhat happens\nif parents can\u2019t meet the fees?\u201d You know, and he said well, we\u2019ve had some [indecipherable]\none of the bursars in the school, not now any more, but about 10 years ago was in my class. And\nhe, for some reason decided that he\u2019d continue to do these things. We -- so we knew each other\non first name terms. And he said to me, well, he said, that\u2019s actually happened, with this\ndownsizing, rightsizing, outsizing thing in the late -- in the 80\u2019s, early 90\u2019s, and so forth. And he\nsaid, but we -- we just told parents the endowment will take care of that until such time as you\u2019re\nin a position to. So the school still continues that.",
        "A: Yeah, as a tradition.",
        "A: And it became -- so if I had to do it, there was somebody else there the next week, that --\nsitting next to me, taking, making sure -- they would have to stand up and take the notes.",
        "A: And you had to do that -- 1t was his Divinity course, but 1t was really courses in religious\nethics for 40 minutes once a week.",
        "A: Years later, when he retired, I came back. My parents were living in England, I was married,\nalready had a daughter, and I was working overseas and was a member of the Rotary club. And\nfor some reason or another my -- I met somebody from the school who was in fact involved in\nthe Rotary club. And the priest of another parish on this little outskirts of the town, who had also\nbeen to -- to the school, but much earlier than I, but who was the person in charge of getting\nspeakers, somehow or another was given my name, and wrote me a little note, and said, \u201cWould\nyou mind speaking? You -- I -- we understand you\u2019re working overseas, could you -- would you\nlike to talk on this one?\u201d And so I said yes, and he said, \u201cOh, by the way, the Reverent J.E.\nTaylor,\u201d you know, he\u2019s retired, he\u2019s your -- your -- your headmaster, you know, \u201che is a\nmember of our club, and he has volunteered to introduce you.\u201d",
        "A: And the -- what was even more interesting is they had the local member of Parliament for\nBedford, turned up that day, who happened to be the former -- former Churchill -- former Prime\nMinister Churchill\u2019s son-in-law, and of course I ended up getting preference. He sat, you know,\non one side, but th -- they weren\u2019t -- this -- they weren\u2019t there -- he wasn\u2019t there to give them a\nspeech --",
        "A: -- you know, just I was there to speak for 20 minutes, and -- and the -- and the -- th-the -- that\nthe -- that my former headmaster, principal, you know, spoke very -- made no reference at all to\nhow my father might have come to see him or something, other than that this is one of my former\nstudents, and he did this and this and this and this and is now this, and I\u2019m delighted to introduce\nhim.",
        "A: You know.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: In the -- in 19 fo -- I -- I graduated in 19 fift -- I went to school in \u201946, to this particular school\nI told you about, graduated in 1953. In 1948, my father became a British citizen, my parents\nbecame British citizens. Because my father became a British citizen, that automatically made me\na British citizen, I did not have to apply, I was a minor, did not have to apply, okay. But on the\ndocuments, I became. That meant that at the age of 17, I had to register for draft. Now, in\nEngland in those days, the draft continued I think until some time of the 60\u2019s. Britain was in the\nsame boat as America is now. Whenever there was a call to do something, they had to send\ntroops. And in -- at the age of 17, it was published in the newspapers that in alphabetical order,\ndates and so and so, and you went to the nearest manpower office, and you registered, okay. And\nyou s -- you explained where you were, what you were doing, were you at school, when did you\nanticipate leaving school, did you plan to go on early -- to further studies? If so, when and how.\nAnd you had to do this, it was a mandatory call up for all males between the ages of 17 and a\nhalf and 35. Now you could have deferments, but you couldn\u2019t get out of it unless you were a\nConscientious Objector, okay. And then you had to -- you would have had to go before a\ntribunal, and that whilst -- they wouldn\u2019t have let you off, but you could have [indecipherable]\naway for that. So at the age of 17 and a half, as I say, I -- I had to register. And I never finished\nmy last day at school, because at my last day of school, I went to a -- I took the train to another\nbalan -- 40 minutes away to another community, where I was -- I\u2019d been sent documents, this for\nmy medical exam, because I had mentioned that I would leave in -- in July 19 -- or I -- I -- in --\nin ju -- in -- in 1953 I would be leaving school, and I\u2019d made the decision not to -- to -- to do the\ncall up earlier than later, not really understanding the consequences of I --",
        "A: -- about what that would really mean. So I never finished the last day of school. Did the call\nup, where you have an interview, and they ask you what you\u2019d like to do, would you like to go in\nthe army, would you like to go in the navy, would you like to go in the air force, and I said,\n\u201cWell Pll -- I'd like to go in the army.\u201d I think really because my grandfather, on both sides, my\nfather, his brothers, my uncle, all been in the army, so I -- 1t was -- it was like it was like a\ntradition. It was now my turn.",
        "A: And I said army, and the fellow said to me, the -- the interviewing officer, obviously a retired\nserving officer, said, \u201cMo -- any -- any particular preference?\u201d And I still remember this, and I\nlaugh about it. I must have been quite arrogant in [indecipherable] days, and I said I\u2019m here -- I\nam now, you know, it -- I'd -- I\u2019d turned 18 now, understand. I said, \u201cI'd like to go in the\nIntelligence Corps.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, why would you like to,\u201d -- you know, \u201cwhat makes you\nsay the Intelligence Corps?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I studied Latin and French at school, and I\nthought I was pretty good, you know. And he nodded, and didn\u2019t say anything. And you know, a\nfew days -- a couple -- two or three weeks later, I get a letter and it says report to the follow -- to\nthe infantry unit in my -- in my hometown. You know, which -- so obviously, if I had said\ninfantry, I might have got into the Intelligence Corps --",
        "A: -- but here, that\u2019s how the military sometimes worked. It didn\u2019t matter, okay. My mother was\nnot terribly happy about this. My fa -- and -- and -- and mention this, and said she was going to\ncall -- you have to remember my parents are now British citizens, and sa -- so my mother said\nshe was going to -- didn\u2019t like this one bit, because it was a pretty sure thing -- I wa --\n[indecipherable] it was pretty -- there was a good likelihood that I\u2019d be sent overseas. You know,\nBritain was involved in -- in -- in Germany, Middle East, the communist uprisings in -- in -- 1n --\nin Malaya at that time, which was British territory. The Korean war, you know, where Britain\nhad, as is normal these days, when America calls --",
        "A: Britain usually ca -- Britain usually accedes, and sends in troops as well. Quite a strange,\nremarkable situation. Painful for a lot of people, no doubt, I don\u2019t -- I expect, but 1t seems to be\nthat way, and was then. But it was Britain really in the major role, and not quite the other way\naround.",
        "A: So my mother, I think, was very concerned, and said she was going to call the Member of\nParliament. Now, I don\u2019t know whether she meant that, or whether she really was trying to\nexpress her irritation. I remember my f -- I remember my father just looking at her and saying,\nthat\u2019s end of conversation. You know, in this family we don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t talk like that, you\nknow. Really -- I mean, you know, it\u2019s the first time I actually heard my father talk to my mother\n-- if they talked like that together, it wasn\u2019t in my presence, that\u2019s the first time I heard my -- I\nheard my father being quite curt about this thing. And sure enough, of course, what happened,\nmuch to my mother\u2019s horror, I suspect, I did my si -- infantry training, and before I knew what\nwas happening, they\u2019d sent me on three weeks embarkation leave, and -- to -- to join another\nadjacent battalion -- infantry battalion in another county next door. You know, it\u2019s like\n[indecipherable] Alexandria to -- to something, you know, else. Wa -- you\u2019re on your way to\nKorea, this bat -- battalion had been chosen to -- to go to Korea. You know, all people below 18\nstep back. I remember we -- I came back from weekend leave and we had a morning parade, step\nback, you -- you are not going, all those 18 and above, pick up your three week embarkation\nleaves, and sign your -- sign your -- to the effect that if you are late from -- from -- from three\nweeks leave, you are no longer classified as absent [indecipherable] if you\u2019re late, you\u2019re\nclassified as a deserter, because you\u2019re going overseas as a battalion, and b-by the way, before\nyou leave today, sign your -- all of you sign your wills. [indecipherable] you know. So here am I\nat the age of 18, signing a will, which I didn\u2019t have anything sign on, but I think it\u2019s done for\npension, or if something should happen you know.",
        "A: And I come home, and I tell my parents [indecipherable] you know, and I\u2019m on three weeks\nembarkation leave, you know. Well, there was nothing they could do about that. On the morning\nwhich we left, I got up early. My father wa -- bef -- we had breakfast together, and then he went\nto work, but we shook hands. And his only comment to me -- he didn\u2019t hug -- we didn\u2019t hug each\nother, it wasn\u2019t -- that wasn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t his --",

My mother came to the -- decided she\u2019d come to the railway\nstation with me, f -- on the way back to camp, and she gave me a small plaque, with the 10\ncommandments. And now she was very qui -- I think she -- she got more religious as time went\nby, and -- and I think she just said, \u201cThis is going to take care of you.\u201d",
        "A: Now, I don\u2019t quite know wha -- why. And she said, \u201cYou take it.\u201d So I put it in my wallet,\nand obviously it did take care of me.",

And the other -- in fact, the --\nthere were several other -- I think I mentioned this to you, there were several other Jewish\nrefugees. I recall perhaps one or two who were quite elderly, and there were some -- three or four\nladies, women, who were married, but whose husbands weren\u2019t -- and who husbands never got --\ncame out, and -- and were killed, unfortunately, in the death camps. And as a result, they, to\nsome degree, adopted me, if you -- if you follow what I\u2019m getting at. You know, they would -- I\nwant to say that they were all -- I became -- they were all mothers, but they looked upon me --\nthey would always ask, where is -- where is John, or where is Johnny, you know. You know,\nthese ladies -- these women lived in -- by themselves in rooms. Some had to work -- they all had\nto work, but they try -- you know, they -- I -- I think they all came from reasonably well-to-do\ncircumstances. Nobody really asked anybody to --\nEnd of Tape Two Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Yeah, these women, and yo -- as I say, you can count the numbers who I can remember,\nbarely on the fingers of, you know, two hands. And perhaps the ones I\u2019m thinking about, not\neven that many. And they remained in Bedford long after the war was over, and they would\nalways ask my mother, you know -- an-and I can remember sometimes meeting for a cup of tea\nin downtown Bedford, you know, in a restaurant or a caf\u00e9 or something, even during the war\nyears, th-th -- two or three would get together, and I\u2019d come along, and so how\u2019s John, or how\u2019s\nJohnny, and -- and so forth. And -- so they, in their own way, I suspect, were almost adopting me\nwithout saying so. And I don\u2019t mean that in any, you know, affect -- loving way, but just -- 1t was\n-- to them, that meant something. And another thing which I thought was rather interesting was\nthat the moment I was called into the military service, my parent\u2019s stock went up in the world.\nPeople sa -- if -- you have to remember, I grew up in -- in the ca -- in a place -- in England, in a -\n- in a-- ina community, particularly after World War II -- now we\u2019re talking for -- World War II\nfinished in \u201946 -- \u00b045, I\u2019m talking now \u201953, I-I\u2019m on a -- IJ-I\u2019m in the army on a way to -- to\nKorea. That\u2019s only eight years. On the street in which I grew up, or everywhere, there wasn\u2019t\nsomebody who didn\u2019t have a brother, an uncle, a father, a grandfather, a nephew, a niece,\nsomebody who hadn\u2019t served in the -- in the -- in the British military, of which most would have\nhad to be sent overseas. Very similar now to what I -- what we read and hear and see happening\nto Americans. So now my parents, people who -- English people would say, what\u2019s happening to\nJohn? So my parents were not long -- refugees in that context.",
        "A: Well, they were now viewed as being in the similar vein, and I think my parents -- I th -- not\nthat we discussed it, but I\u2019m looking back now, people would say, oh I met so and so, he wanted\nto know how you were doing. My mother in particular, my father didn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t that way\ninclined, but my mother, among, you know, other English people, neighbors and so forth. And I\nthink that that had something to do with these other now elderly ladies, or quite older ladies, who\nagain would sort of say, what\u2019s happening. It -- 1t seemed to raise the level. They weren\u2019t\nrefugees from German oppression. Somebody was doing equal things.",
        "A: If that mean -- if -- if you understand. I don\u2019t know whether it has any meaning.",
        "A: I think it had meaning.",
        "A: To them, yeah.",
        "A: It gave my parents status. They could talk on equal terms.",
        "A: And in some instances, of course, on more terms, because some of my peer group ended up\nnot going overseas. So here was I now doing something which was far more serious --",
        "A: -- than, you know, being posted to Scotland or someplace like that.",
        "A: I came out in \u201955.",
        "A: I came out in \u201955, yeah, we -- I came back on a troop ship, you know came back, and was\nthen -- and then ended up in a -- what is like -- you would have to call now like the National\nGuard.",
        "A: Not from a voluntary point of view, but the system was, when you did your two year\u2019s stint in\n-- in draft -- National Service it was called, English -- but it\u2019s the same thing as the draft, yeah.\nYou then went into -- they call it territorial army, which was like the National Guard, and I\nwould -- I had to do five weekends, and one fort -- two we -- a two or three week camp every\nyear.",
        "A: Well, this was in \u201955, and I was living at home with my parents, looking for a job. The\nsituation was a little bit different. What I\u2019d seen and witnessed, and been involved in was now\ntotally different from my peer group at school, who\u2019d ri -- who\u2019d gone on -- who\u2019d never gone\noverseas. We were all the same age level, but mentally I was far removed, if you understand\nwhat I\u2019m getting.",
        "A: It took me a little bit -- 1t took me several months to wind down from this -- this scenario, if\nyou understand what I\u2019m getting about. So I do understand of -- I -- I -- I -- I have a lot of\nunderstanding as to what\u2019s taking place right now, from an Iraq point of view --",
        "A: -- with the United States forces, particularly at that same age level.",
        "A: Cause I came back -- now, was a very funny situation, I came back -- I came out, and I wasn\u2019t\neven 21. Now, in England at that time, you couldn\u2019t vote if you\u2019re 21. You had to get permission\nto get married if you were -- if you were less than 21. You couldn\u2019t buy cigarettes if you were --\nunless you were 21, and you couldn\u2019t go into a bar, or a pub, as they call it in England, and order\na drink if you were under 21. So, when I came out, when I was released, I was released -- my\nparents came to the railway station to pick me up. We -- we came off the boat, took the train to\nBedford, and my parents came to me, and they\u2019d already called the -- the -- the -- the -- the\nregimental depot to say, you know, when are they coming in, and they\u2019d said, oh, you know, he\u2019s\n-- he should be arriving at the railway station, and so on. They said, can we go and see him?\nThey said yeah, but have to remember, he -- they\u2019re going to come into the -- we\u2019re gonna -- he\u2019s\ngoing to have to come to the -- he can say hello to you, but he\u2019s got to come to the depot, but\nthey\u2019Il be -- he\u2019Il be going on leave later on this evening, okay. But we -- we need to do some\nforms, and it'll be for three weeks, and then he goes back for a couple of days, and then it\u2019s\nrelease, you see. So my parents had told me this was happening. So, I was not 21 yet, but I was\non three weeks paid leave, but still in the military. So I arrived at home in uniform, and you\nknow, for three weeks I was running around in civilian clothes. And one evening I went to a pub\nnearby to get a drink, and I -- you know, I had to get a packet of cigarettes. And I walked in --\nand -- well, but I\u2019ve told this story [indecipherable] parents and to my wife and to my kids, and\nit\u2019s hilarious. I walked in, and I went to the bar and I said, \u201cI'd like a half a glass of beer, and --\nand a packet of Craven A cigarettes.\u201d And the barman looked at me and said, \u201cHow old are you\nsonny?\u201d You know, and -- and the -- and the older people sitting at the bar, I could hear the little\ntitters of laughter, you see. He says, \u201cYou come back when you\u2019re 21.\u201d You know. So I walked\nout of the bar in a real high state. You have to remember, I\u2019d come back from Korea, you see. I\nwalked home, I went upstairs -- this in my parents house, and I got out of my civilian clothes,\nand --",
        "A: -- put my uniform [indecipherable]. And they said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d I said, \u201cI went to get\na packet of cigarettes and they turned me down.\u201d I put on my uniforms, which had my ribbons on\nit, everything else. And I -- I-I think I run back to the pub, you know, got [indecipherable] stood\noutside, and sort of got myself organized, and I walked in. There was the same barman and the\nsame group of people, it wasn\u2019t very far away. And I said, \u201cI want a glass of beer, and a packet\nof Craven A cigarettes.\u201d And the barman had a straight face, and he pulled this beer out for me,\nand he said, \u201cWhich cigarettes did you order?\u201d And I said, \u201cA packet of 20 Craven A.\u201d And\nthere wasn\u2019t a sound from the -- from the other --",
        "A: -- you -- you know, from the other -- you know, who were still sitting on the bar, so they were\nlooking at me, but not more titters, you see.",
        "A: And I thought this was -- I was so annoyed, you see.",
        "A: And that was the end of -- I mean, of course, nobody said anything, and I know -- I drank my\nbeer, smoked my cigarettes, which you know, obviously didn\u2019t do me any good, I don\u2019t smoke\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Just to prove a point. That had nothing to do with religion, of course --",
        "A: -- I was just so ticked off, you know, I was ready to take the par -- th-the pub apart, you see.",
        "A: Not that that would have happened, but nobody said a word --",
        "A: -- they just all looked at me, and -- and then tol -- turned and drank their beer again.",
        "A: And I\u2019m sure that same situation is going on --",
        "A: -- right now, here.",
        "A: In \u201956 -- and I\u2019m still -- I turned 21. In \u201956, Britain, with France went into the Suez, and if you\nremember, Israel attacked from the other side, because Egypt had taken over the Suez canal. In\n\u201956, I was -- I forget which day it was now, I was in London on a in -- going -- going for a job\ninterview, or so. And I came back -- I\u2019d taken the train up in the morning, and I\u2019d come back in\nthe -- before suppertime -- it\u2019s only an hour each way by train. And my mother said to me, \u201cI\nthink you better stay home this evening.\u201d And I -- you know, not with a happy look on her face.\nAnd I said, \u201cOh, why?\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, the police came round this afternoon. They want to\ngive you something.\u201d And I -- so I said, \u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you take it?\u201d They said, \u201cNo, no,\nyou've got to sign for this.\u201d So they -- I said, \u201cWell, what did you say?\u201d They said, \u201cWell, I told\nthem you\u2019d be back -- you were in London for the day, you\u2019d be back.\u201d They said, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll\nbe along tonight at nine o\u2019clock.\u201d So I said, \u201cAll right.\u201d They said -- my mother said, \u201cYou\u2019d\nbetter stay at home for this.\u201d I said [indecipherable] not go out or [indecipherable] that\u2019s okay.\nSure enough about nine-ish in the evening, police car turn up at my -- at our door, and -- and a\nknock on the door, and you know, \u201cJohn Meyerstein?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah.\u201d They said, \u201cWe got a\ndocument.\u201d And it was in one of these buff colored envelopes, and in those days it was on Her\nMajesty\u2019s Service, you see? You\u2019ve got to sign for this thing. And inside was a call-up notice to -\n- to -- to me, to say that if I move from the house for more than 72 hours, I was t -- it was -- in\nthose days they didn\u2019t call it Department of National Defense, it was War Office, to say that the\ndocument was headline -- headed th -- you know -- letterhead was War Office, to say that if I\nmove from this -- my place of residence for more than 72 hours, I was to notify the War Office,\nand I was to hold myself in readiness for an immediate call-up, you see? So I -- I d -- well, I\ndon\u2019t quite know why, I\u2019m not a reservist, th -- you know, I -- the reservists were people who\ndidn\u2019t do anything, but they got paid. I was not a reservist in that way, I was in the territorial,\nwhich was like the National Guard. So the next morning, I called the -- the -- the depot where I\nu-used to do th -- for the training. It was the same ba -- regimental battalion which I\u2019d started off\nwith, you see. And I said, you know, I just had this call-up [indecipherable]. \u201cWell,\u201d they said,\n\u201c\u2018veah you -- there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, what do you mean?\u201d They\nsaid, \u201cWell, you served in Korea, so on your file -- we don\u2019t have to train you again, you\u2019ve had\ntraining for all these things.\u201d And of course, in between that 12 months, I had -- I\u2019d done s-some\n-- locally, some parachute training, because it gave you extra money, and the wings looked pretty\ngood on your battle dress, you see. And they said, \u201cWell, you\u2019ve got all these things, they don\u2019t\nhave to train you. There\u2019s nothing you can do, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s been -- it\u2019s flagged,\nyou know, that you\u2019ve served in a -- in a combat zone before. It\u2019s different if we have to get\nsomebody and we\u2019re going to train them. We don\u2019t need to give you 16 weeks training,\u201d or stuff\nlike that, in much the same way as it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- to some degree it\u2019s happening here, as I read in\nthe papers right now.",
        "A: So, of course, I showed this to my parents, and of course nothing was said, there\u2019s nothing I\ncould do about it. Now, it may have been that my mother wasn\u2019t so -- don\u2019t forget, Israel was\nnow on the other side.",
        "A: So -- so there was a different s -- a very -- 1t wasn\u2019t the Israeli army calling me up, it was the\nBritish army calling me up. And then I got a job interview. I got a job application, you know.\nAnd I took it, and that\u2019s -- and the company wanted me to s -- go overseas to -- to -- to Singapore\non their behalf. And I called the depot -- depot, and said, you know -- I didn\u2019t hear anything for -\n- for awhile. And I -- I called the depot and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got this job.\u201d They said, \u201cWell you take\nthe job, you\u2019ve -- I mean, you\u2019ve just been -- you\u2019ve just been put on notice. If -- you know, if\nthey\u2019re going to do something, they\u2019re going to get in -- they\u2019Il get you wherever you are,\u201d you\nsee. I mean, that is how it\u2019s d -- I don\u2019t know it\u2019s done in -- in the st -- in the United States, but in\nBritain they would know wherever you are.",
        "A: Okay. So I went to -- I went to Singapore to work, didn\u2019t hear any more about it. About a year\nafter -- all this is over in \u201956, I get a notice from the depot, \u201cPlease report for -- for -- for the two\nor three weeks annual -- annual maneuvers,\u201d or whatever it is, you see. So I wrote immediately\nback and said, \u201cI\u2019m in Singapore, you want -- you know, you\u2019ve sent me the thing here, could\nyou send me a travel warrant,\u201d which it was the standard thing to do f -- t -- from Singapore to\nLondon and London back to Singapore, or how do you wish me to proceed? I got -- never got an\nanswer back. I never got -- I never had another letter.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I think somebody laughed -- looked at it, I mean they would all know this --",
        "A: -- and the people, because in a small community like that, everybody know it -- my mother\nknew the wife of -- of one of -- of the people who worked in the -- in the depot, or something,\nand they would have known this is going out.",
        "A: And -- and so they probably said, oh, this 1s nonsense and --",
        "A: -- what do we call John back for, we\u2019re gonna spend money on an air ticket for him.",
        "A: You know, the -- the -- the battalion\u2019s not going to fall or -- or break because he\u2019s --",
        "A: -- he\u2019s not here.",
        "A: So those are -- those are some rather interesting military experiences.",
        "A: And what is interesting is that that battalion, grandfathered into different names, was the first\nbattalion sent by the British army to Kabul to participate with the united -- or to Afghanistan\nwith the --",
        "A: -- with the --",
        "A: -- with the -- with the American forces --",
        "A: -- actually. Interesting to this day, yeah.",
        "A: And I know this because the -- the ba -- the regiment, the battalion, the -- the [indecipherable]\nregiment still sends me, every three or four months, a little brochure of up-to-date happenings as\nto what is -- 1s going on, you know, and what they\u2019re doing, because of what Britain is doing\nnow in Iraq, as well as in -- in -- in -- in -- in -- still in Afghanistan [indecipherable]",

And he\u2019s buried in England.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: My father never discussed it. Again, I have to tell you that.",
        "A: A-And my father\u2019d become -- we didn\u2019t talk about that period at all, but he\u2019d become a little\nbit more mellow. My mother, I think, emotionally, was still a little bit more, you know -- could\nreally not forget these things, you know.",
        "A: Despite the fact that, you know, from a physical point of view, because one can say mental\nstress could be equally as bad as physical stress, you know.",
        "A: She, I think, coped with it harder. She did not bury it to the same degree, but, you know, and\nI\u2019m not sure how one -- how one copes on this thing, you know. Individual people have different\nsituations on this. They -- my mother went to Israel twice to see her mother. My father went\nonce, and they both came to North America to s -- to visit me.",
        "A: Because I ended up in Canada, and of course we had two grandchildren of that\n[indecipherable]. And my mother even then flew, while she was in Canada from Toronto to New\nYork to spend a week with Margot -- Aunt Margot, quote, unquote, as I mentioned to you before,\nearlier in the discussions.",
        "A: Yeah, and spent -- and stayed with her and then came back again, you know.",
        "A: I did ask my parents -- my mother was quite keen to come and join us. My father -- we went\nfor a walk, and you have to remember, my father was already now in his 80\u2019s, or just -- yeah,\nbeginning his 80\u2019s. And I asked him, and he said, \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cI -- I\u2019m too old.\u201d He says -- he\nlooked upon North America, he liked everything which he saw, but he thought it was a younger\nperson\u2019s country. And for him I think it would have been re-rooting another tree, took him long\nenough to plant in England, if you want to put it that way. I think that would have been too\nmuch. My mother, I think, was interested in that time. I think my father found his English\nsolitude comforting. He -- he was very much an island unto himself. You can\u2019t really live that\nway, but he tried his utmost to -- to -- t-to -- to activate that sort of situation, I think. But they\ndidn\u2019t come again -- he didn\u2019t come again, and -- and -- and that\u2019s quite an effort. In those days\nthey really wanted, you know, they didn\u2019t like if -- people who were quite old to fly. I mean, he\nwas physically fit okay, but I mean, he was in his 80\u2019s. I mean, can you imagine what would\nhave happened if he\u2019d had a heart attack or something, you know?",
        "A: I think -- that\u2019s not an easy question to answer.",
        "A: I certainly think that the -- the early years made me much more self sufficient, or reliant upon\nmyself. My parents didn\u2019t, for a long time, didn\u2019t know a lot of people -- and I\u2019m talking about\npeople in England, English people to whom they could ask questions and -- as to what one\nshould be doing, how should we do it. So everything which I thought about, or wanted to do, I\nwould have to sort of glean for myself through my questions, wondi -- wondering whether that\nperson would know what I was talking about or so forth. So, i1-it made me stand on my own feet,\nequally so. My military experiences certainly helped in that, because in those days when you\nwent for a job interview, more or less any company would ask, have you been in the military? In\nEngland, what sort of school did you go to, and have you served in the military and the third\nquestion was, have you served overseas? And I think the reason for that was that they felt if -- if\nthose three things all tied together, they had a reliable, disciplined person, who would understand\nwhat to do, okay. Now whether that\u2019s true today, I suspect not to the same degree at all. M-My\nfather being so much older, was -- wasn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t that easy to relate in terms, I mean, when I --\nI watch -- I go out to watch our grandkids play soccer or something like that, and we -- and we\u2019re\nnot close together, we -- they live very far apart, but when we do -- or we\u2019ve done for our own\nkids when they were doing that. Girls play soccer these days now. I don\u2019t mean that in a silly\nway, but --",
        "A: -- but my father didn\u2019t have the time or the energy.",
        "A: You know, af -- and probably was still too depressed. And my mother was also working in\nwhatever shape or form to bring some extra money in. Not the nicest of jobs, you know, cleaning\nfloors, and washing clothes in -- 1n a -- in somebody\u2019s house is not exactly what she was used to,\nbut it paid the -- it paid bills, and eventually she didn\u2019t have to do that. So, I didn\u2019t really have\nthat -- that close-knit relationship. I was very grateful to my father for making sure, and going\nout of his way, with all his efforts to get me a good education, and -- and a certain standard of --\nof -- of decency, and -- and -- and how to live, and how to behave. And the -- and that -- you\nknow, the behavior -- to him, behavior and dignity were terribly important, which I think you can\nunderstand. My mother was a much more emotional person, I think became somewhat more\nreligious in later years. But we didn\u2019t talk a great deal about it. It -- perhaps that was the way\nGerman Jews, who had lived in Germany for such -- and I don\u2019t mean that in any demeaning\nway, had integrated so much that they did not view themselves so much as Jewish as they viewed\nthemselves as Germans of a Jewish religion, 1-1f you understand, actually.",
        "A: Okay?",
        "A: And we didn\u2019t talk about that. Nobody made any demands upon anybody. And it\u2019s very hard\nfor me to understand that. When I went to get a job interview, when I was being inter -- in -- and\nI\u2019m only speaking about my experiences in England, nobody ever asked, you know, what\nreligion are you, 1-1f you understand what I\u2019m getting at.",
        "A: I mean, just to give you an illustration of how these -- I\u2019m only speaking now from the\nEnglish point of view. Years later I\u2019m living in Canada, I\u2019m running a business of my own, and\ndealing with British companies of quite sizable renown and -- renow -- renown in -- in their own\nfields. And suddenly I\u2019m asked -- I get a call from -- from -- from a senior army officer from\nEngland saying we\u2019re going to be in eng -- in Canada in a short period of [indecipherable] we\u2019d\nlike you to consider being an honorary defense industries representative for us. It\u2019s purely\nhonorary, it doesn\u2019t pay anything. Would you be interested? And I thought to my -- well, I -- I\nsaid yes, you know, I mean, no reason. And I thought to myself -- he came and 1n typical English\nway we met, had a meal, some drinks. He knew exactly what school I\u2019d been to, where I\u2019d done\nmy service, who I was representing. I have to assume that some of the companies from England,\nwho deal with Department of National Defense said we have so and so. And they want -- and he\nsaid it\u2019s purely honorary, but it opened the doors to a lot of scenarios. And I said to my wife\nafter, isn\u2019t it funny a German Jewish refugee, sitting in Canada now, has been asked to be an\nhonorary situation in this way, where I\u2019d come, you see.",
        "A: And I -- I mean, this is many years -- a number of years ago. And I thought, what an\nachievement for myself, you know, 1-if I can view it in that way.",
        "A: I just thought it was a great -- it was an honor.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how much it really benefited me, but it was -- I thought 1t was an honor to me,\nas to how far I\u2019d come, and the -- and the -- the -- the feeling of -- of -- of being able to have\nsomebody ask that, and not sort of say, where are your antecedents, and -- and -- and -- and so\nforth.",
        "A: And so these things had -- but nobody said to me, are you Jewish? What religion are you? Are\nyou a refugee? Were you the son of a refugee? Now, why would they ask in the first place, but\nmy parents didn\u2019t talk about the St. Louis to other people. They talked perhaps, to other Jewish,\nin that little group --",
        "A: -- about it. And if somebody who had an understanding, like yourself, they might -- my\nmother -- certainly my father wouldn\u2019t have discussed it with you.",
        "A: You know. And -- but beyond that, that was an era which had gone, from my father\u2019s point of\nview. I don\u2019t think he would have appreciated it. I don\u2019t know how best to answer your -- your\nquestion that way. I-I don\u2019t know. I -- I went to -- I went to visit Israel in 1967 -- \u201967, yes. And I\ntalked to my mother\u2019s brother. I stayed with my uncle and his wife.",
        "A: Lota, yeah. His wife was Laura. She ran a flower business and had the contract to supply the\nIsraeli parliament every day with flowers. And she -- and I had the chance -- she took me with\nher, and I had a chance to see the -- the Israeli parliament and to explain various other things and\nso forth. My uncle was also very much an intellectual, eve -- you know, in his own way. Also a\nlawyer, but never practiced law. Too late for him, you know.",
        "A: And never practiced it in Israel either. And worked at the -- the la -- the library in -- in\nJerusalem or something like that, you know, he liked -- he was great on books.

I\u2019ve -- \u2019ve become an agnostic.\u201d And I said,\n\u201cWell then, do you go to the synagogue?\u201d He and I were just talking alone quietly. And I said,\n\u201cWere you always an agnostic?\u201d And I think he said to me no, not initially, but he said, \u201cIt\nwasn\u2019t a very deeply religious household in which we grew up in,\u201d for whatever reasons, we\ndidn\u2019t go into that detail, and I don\u2019t know, you know, because what is one man\u2019s viewpoint --\npersonal viewpoint, not -- might not necessarily reflect what actually did happen\n[indecipherable]. And I said, \u201cSo, do you go on the Jewish high holidays to the -- to the\nsynagogue?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI do, but,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that\u2019s really to please your\naunt.\u201d But he said it doesn\u2019t do any harm to sit and reflect, while you\u2019re sitting down there. But\nhe said, \u201cAre you asking me would I go voluntarily? No.\u201d But he said, \u201cWhat difference does it\nmake?\u201d He said, \u201cI go. So, after all, I\u2019m free to do what I want.\u201d So I don\u2019t know how best to\nanswer that situation there.",

        "A: 1 -- I -- I-- ?'m not -- I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m an agnostic, or an atheist, because I wouldn\u2019t have\nmade the same comment to my uncle. And by the way, my uncle always wrote to me in English,\nyou know, from Israel. I would send him books, and he would send me a recommendation on\nbooks. Course, his recommendation on books were based on his time at the university, you\nknow, when he was studying in Germany, okay. Whereas my books would be on more current\naffairs, you know, current affairs, politics, North America, British, or something like that, he --\nhe loved that. And I would send him the books, and he would read that. In fact my -- my -- my --\nmy cousin, his son, he had two children, a -- a boy and a girl -- his son, when his father died,\nwhen my uncle died, called me up to tell me what had happened, and I -- you know, and I -- and\nwe were talking and he said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve suddenly discovered all my father\u2019s papers. He\nmade a photostatic co [indecipherable] a duplicate copy of every letter he wrote to you, and he\nkept every one of your letters.\u201d And he said, \u201cI\u2019m looking at a pile of books, now.\u201d We were on\nthe phone, and he said, \u201cI\u2019m looking at a pile of books. I had no idea that you\u2019d sent him these\nthings.\u201d There\u2019s a bit of an age gap between us, you know, he\u2019s about 50, and -- and I\u2019m -- I\u2019ll be\n70 next year. And he said, \u201cI had no idea that he kept all the,\u201d -- we didn\u2019t know this, you know.\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to go through all this,\u201d and -- and -- and this is very important, 1t was\nmore important for him to tell me this than it was for me to mention it to him, you see.",

And it was time for me to do the headstone for my mother, cause you\ngenerally don\u2019t -- it\u2019s in the -- in the grave, you don\u2019t put a headstone 1n 1n the first few months\nor a year because the ground tends to move, and the stones can fall over. So I'd had the\nheadstone made, made arrangements for the people in England to carve the headstone to match\nthe duplicate of my father, an-and to have it in there so for my arrival, so I could combine the\ntrip. My wife was very keen, cause this is a one off thing, and if she didn\u2019t attend there\u2019d be no\nsecond 50, you know, reunion in Bath, England, cause she went t-to study home economics in -\n- you know, in Bath, a-as a -- as a student, okay. And -- and she\u2019d been to Washington long\nbefore I ever got here. She -- after she\u2019d finished u-university studies, she came to visit, her\nfather sent her through the United States to have a -- to -- to -- to see North America in general,\nactually, long before I ever got here. While she was at school studying, I was in Korea, you see. I\nalways say to her, my taxes, she got a -- got a free education. But anyway, and we did all this,\nyou see, we -- we went to -- and of course she ca -- we went together to bury my mother and --\nand so forth. My children are aware of this. Last year when we were back, my cousin, the older g\n-- my uncle, a girl. She now has four children of her own, and more grandchildren than I\u2019ve got,\nyou know. In the last month she\u2019s just had two, suddenly. But she turned up with her husband,\nwith her daughter. She was coming on a business trip to Europe, but she was coming to England\nbecause she\u2019d found out that I was coming -- we hadn\u2019t seen each other for years -- but -- with\nher husband. Her daughter was living -- was spending some time in England. Her son, who was\nmarried, was spending some time 1n England as well. We all met in London for a meal, for\nlunch. And we spent the whole -- we -- I think we met at 12, we didn\u2019t break up until six o\u2019clock\nin the evening. And it\u2019s very funny, her -- she is now e-mailing me almost on a regular basis,\nwhich hasn\u2019t happened. Her son, who\u2019s -- is e-mailing me, who I -- the youngest son, w-which\nwe'd never met before, I had no idea what he looked like and so forth. And it -- I don\u2019t know\nwhy, whether it\u2019s because I\u2019m now the oldest, we\u2019re a much closer relationship, although we\nnever discussed religion, you see.",

I\u2019m -- I -- ma -- my -- my f -- agrees with me on this, we\u2019ve talked about this, in fact my\ndaughters also, I\u2019ve discussed this with my daughters, who were -- you know, my eldest daughter\nis 42, and the other one will be 38 this year, both married with children. I don\u2019t know whether\nmy cousins are -- view me now as a sort of rock, because of the worries which are going on in\nIsrael. Do you follow, I\u2019m the -- I\u2019m the person living outside, not under these pressures, and\nthere -- do you understand? It\u2019s almost like my -- am I the person they could turn to if something\nwent wrong?",

        "A: -- from Jews, and others, but Jews as -- in particular, and those are now being checked out.\nAnd -- and as you know, the Swiss, you know -- you know, looted all the accounts. I, by sheer\ncoincidence, not without any deliberate scenarios, happened to hit a website about a year ago,\nand up popped my grandma -- parent\u2019s names on my mother\u2019s side, and my father\u2019s name, my\nmother\u2019s name and my name, with all the right birthdates, places of birth and the time of -- you\nknow, th-the -- the date of birth, with the exact names. Now, I don\u2019t know where they got these\nthings from. So, I called my cousin in Australia, and it was agreed th -- that we would put a\nclaim in for property -- we already had that done before -- we would put in another claim, and we\nwould also put in an insurance claim. And rightly or wrongly, ve no means of knowing. But my\ncousin in Australia said, \u201cJohn, will you take care of this?\u201d So I said yes. Now, she physically is\nnot so well any more. I mentioned the same -- I called my two cousins in or -- in Israel, cause\nthey\u2019re the direct grandchildren, like I am, of our grandfather on my mother\u2019s side. And said,\n\u201cT\u2019ve seen these names, and I\u2019ve seen your father\u2019s name on their as well, and my mother\u2019s\nname. Not my name, not your names, but our -- I think you should -- did you notice?\u201d \u201cNo, we\ndidn\u2019t notice.\u201d They didn\u2019t even know about this. I said, \u201cI think you should put some -- a claim\nin.\u201d And both of me -- he said, \u201cJohn, you take care of it -- will you take care of it?\u201d I said,\n\u201cWell, I -- a-are you quite happy with this?\u201d Because in the application forms -- I\u2019d already\ndownloaded them from the computer, and I\u2019d read them through. And of course, don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s\nall in English, the applications have to be in English, and they\u2019re not normally speaking English\nat the -- so, 1t would -- that\u2019s another reason they probably might have thought let John do it,\ncause he understands the language better. And I said, \u201cAre you absolutely comfortable,\u201d because\nI said that I will -- I sign as the applicant, and I have to state, which I would, and give your\naddresses of any other relatives who might, should a claim ever be honored, if the -- if there 1s --\nit ever come up, that I undertake to insure that you were [indecipherable] no question, no doubt\nin my -- please take care of it, I said, \u201cI tell you what, in that case I will do it, but I will give you\ncopies of everything,\u201d which I did, and to my cousin in Australia. But I said, \u201cRecognize\nsomething, our chances are less than one percent. If you look at it in that light, then you won\u2019t\nget upset. If nothing happens, if 1t comes, which we -- I doubt very much, then wh -- we\u2019ll see\nwhat happens. But if you\u2019re comfortable,\u201d -- and they said, \u201c\u201cWe\u2019re very comfortable.\u201d And from\n-- and, you know, and somehow or another that suddenly -- and I\u2019ve wondered to myself whether\npsychologically they look upon me now as somebody who if something devastating were to\nhappen -- and I mean, unfortunately they are in an area of the -- of the world where, you know, I\nmean, things can happen elsewhere, but where things are not the most pleasant for everybody --\nwhether they don\u2019t somehow look upon me as being somebody who might be in a position to\nhelp, were something to go wrong.",
        "A: Mm.",

        "A: In other words, whatever -- and it seems to me that whatever decisions they\u2019re now making,\nthey call now to ask what my views were, whereas over the last 30 years, we barely exchanged\ncards. It\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re -- we\u2019ve got to check to see --",

        "A: -- that -- that I\u2019m -- you know, I'd rather I was completely wrong 1n this.",
        "A: And hopefully I am, that nothing is going to happen. Or whether it\u2019s they\u2019re worried about --\nbecause they have parents and grandparents who went through this.",
        "A: Now, I asked both my -- I asked my cousin over lunch that time, you know, did -- did your --\ndid -- did y -- did your father, my uncle and your mother talk to you about all this? They said\n\u201cNo, not really. In fact you\u2019re telling us more. Things which we had no idea.

I don\u2019t --\nperhaps my mother -- my grandmother put those pictures in a rucksack. She couldn\u2019t take\nanything else, perhaps she took some of those sort of things, you know. But I found that rather\ninteresting. But again, to answer your questions, I -- we never talked about these things. Perhaps\nwe\u2019re a bit more peculiar in that respect. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Four weeks, or thereabouts, yeah.",
        "A: Hm, no, I -- that\u2019s a fair question.",
        "A: No, I think, no, I think I can answer that. As far as the -- the memories of the -- of the -- of the\nSt. Louis, I would really just say to you again, I was only four.",
        "A: Okay. We\u2019re talking 1939 in May, I\u2019d only turned four in March, so we left in May, in June\nwe arrived in England, okay.",
        "A: To me that\u2019s a very short period, and obviously nothing untoward happened. I certainly don\u2019t\nrecall -- and I don\u2019t hear my mother -- I don\u2019t think my mother ever mentioned anything of any\nproblem with me, other than that one thing where I -- she --",
        "A: -- I got lost on the -- or some -- or appeared to get lost in the [indecipherable]. I do recognize\nthough, I think, and I\u2019ve often wondered why, you know, more consideration could not have\nbeen given either by the U.S., and also Canada, Canada turned them down as well, no question\nabout it. And Canada turned them down with much greater vehemence, I think, indirectly, than\nlet\u2019s say other countries may have down. Just said no. I\u2019ve read certain documents, or papers\nwhich -- in books, which indicate that there was a reason for it, Quebec being French, and\nCatholic, and you know, not keen to want anything to do with Jews at that time, had influence on\nthe federal government, I don\u2019t know. Could something have been done at this end? Yes, I have\nto ask myself that question. Could, you know, could the federal government, in it\u2019s wisdom,\nignore -- could the president of the United States or whatever, have ignored the political antennas\naround him and said, for humanitarian reasons it\u2019s a mere 1100 people, 1200 people or whatever.\nI think they could have done. I mean, when I see the way things are happening today. Would it\nhave made a difference to my parents? Hopefully it would have done. At least they would have\nhad some relatives like these people here --",
        "A: -- in Chicago. How much they could have done to help beyond, I don\u2019t know. It would have\nbeen a point of reference, I would imagine we would have attempted to -- to go there, that\u2019s the\nonly point, just out of sheer gratitude, and they -- probably knowing them -- they\u2019re long dead\nnow, and I honor them accordingly, I\u2019m sure they would have done everything possible to -- to\nhelp us, or to put us up, or it wouldn\u2019t matter what it would have been. Yes, I-I -- that\u2019s always\nbeen a disappointment to me. Politics being politics, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m logical enough to know that, you\nknow, somebody would argue that, you know, what are a thousand people in the context of a\ncountry\u2019s overall requirements? What did that German military store in Klausowitz say? You\nknow, war is just another name for -- and a tactic of politics, or something like that, I think you\nunderstand what I mean. I don\u2019t know. I -- I -- I -- I certainly don\u2019t think that Canada came out of\nit any -- in any great honor, notwithstanding what they might do today. Say certainly there were\npeople who did go to the Prime Minister in Canada at the time, and say please do something, and\nI don\u2019t mean just Jews. Could America have done something? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think the\nEuropean countries who -- who gave sanction -- sanctuary to -- to the -- to us, whether it was\nEngland, or that -- did 1t with great enthusiasm, but they did it, you know. For which, certainly\nfrom England\u2019s point of view, I\u2019m eternally grateful, actually. And I think P\u2019ve repaid my s -- my\nscore on that by -- by my military service for U.K. And I suppose in fairness -- and my parents\nare buried there, and all the benefits I\u2019ve gained, in -- from a business, or other point of view,\nhave come from the U.K., and were -- it never gonna happen, but were England to call, I would\nhave to assume that I\u2019d have to do something, more than for anywhere else, because of that. But\ndo I believe they all did it because they thought we were the greatest thing, no, I would imagine\nthey did it because we were a damned inconvenience. But it was -- but they were good enough to\ndo it, in whatever way. And whether somebody persuaded them, or somebody put some pressure\non, doesn\u2019t matter. It only requires good people to stand up and something can happen. The other\nargument, if good people stand up and do nothing, bad things happen.",
        "A: Right. I would imagine I\u2019m being very, perhaps coldly logical in -- and -- and -- and in many\nways I can follow that because I an -- my father was, you know, very Prussian in his ways, you\nknow, really. And I can understand those feelings, because actually I was born in -- in what was\nPrussia then, because Prussia didn\u2019t become a non-country until after the war, I think \u201947 or \u00b048,\nwhen they decided to eliminate the country as a country. So I can feel these things. This is not an\ninheritance of one generation. We\u2019re talking back generations here, you know. When I got called\nup, my mother -- my mother sort of said, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s that German instinct,\u201d you know, got to\ngo back into the military again. And my father said nothing and we all laughed, but underneath\nit, perhaps my mother had a point, you know. I didn\u2019t go unhappily, you know. No --",
        "A: Not a chan - not a way.",
        "A: It was my turn now, and to b -- as -- you know, so I -- and I don\u2019t want to minimize that, I\u2019m\nnot talking glory here, but this was different. Do I think these things can happen again? I suspect\nso. Do I feel that things could have been done better? Yes, I do. How can I change that? I\u2019ve\ntaught my kids about that.",
        "A: I\u2019ve not -- I\u2019ve never tried to impose too much on it, I wanted them to have a normal life, as\nnormal as I could make it, and as normal as I got it. And I am grateful to my parents, or to my\nfather in particular, for not putting me into this position of having to try and almost rethink\neverything [indecipherable] continuous, as we talked about earlier. But I\u2019ve always said to my\nkids, you know, my daughters, if you have to do something, don\u2019t do it at the last minute, do it\nwhen it\u2019s easy, when there\u2019s no pressure, if that\u2019s what you want to do.

I find 1t sometimes very hard to understand how my -- my family, my father\u2019s family\nand my mother\u2019s family, male and female, male more than anything else because they\u2019re the\nones who had the -- the greatest education, and I mean a really good education, could not have\nseen the writing on the wall. I mean, I have in my father\u2019s documents, I found them, the date on\nwhich he was made a barrister, or sign [indecipherable] under Prussia. The date when he was\nmade a commissioner of oaths and all these. And attached underneath, the date when he was --\nthe -- the -- the -- the -- Hitler, under government regulations, starting in 1933 to \u201934, rescinded\nall these things. And I\u2019ve often asked myself, my God, if you saw that, what --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Exactly right. My -- my father was a lawyer, my Uncle Hugo, his eld -- my father\u2019s eldest\nbrother worked in the financial institution, in a bank. I -- I don\u2019t know the name of the bank. My\nmother\u2019s brother was a lawyer, although he never practiced law, per se. But I think he got a\ndoctorate in law as well, he was a -- he -- he liked studies [indecipherable] and my daughter\nseems to take after that as well, my eldest daughter. Anyway, I -- and sud -- funny enough, so\ndoes my young daughter now gradually, it di -- just takes in different ages [indecipherable]. But\nhow could they not have seen this?",
        "A: My mother tells me that they had a meeting, but I wasn\u2019t part of that meeting, you know, I -- I\nwas born, but I wasn\u2019t like we\u2019re discussing here, so I can\u2019t really say what actually took place.\nYou know, how did they discuss it, what did they discuss? I suppose the question probably was\nraised is what are we going to do? And where do we go? One thing is, I suspect, when -- when\nwe didn\u2019t get into the United States, or United States made no effort, or -- or Canada, because th\n-- they were the next two -- the two countries closest, is that the Germans must have chuckled to\nthemselves and said, \u201cWell, you see, if they don\u2019t let them in, there\u2019s only 1100. And then what\nyou -- you -- no wonder what we\u2019re doing is right.\u201d",
        "A: Okay?",
        "A: Then I have to ask the question, well why did the other countries do it, okay? Holland\u2019s\nalways had that reputation for giving sanctity to -- sanctuary, I beg your pardon, to -- to refugees.\nThe -- France, I\u2019m not quite sure, even to this day in my mind -- I\u2019m a bit ambivalent about\nFrance, I can -- was it Belgium agreed as well?",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019m not quite -- I don\u2019t know enough about Belgium. Britain always opened it\u2019s doors to\nrefugees in the old days. Course the old days weren\u2019t so old any more at that time, okay, but they\ndid it. For whatever reason, they did it. Nobody else did it in Europe. And the Germans must\nhave been saying to themselves, well hooray, we can go full steam ahead, cause nobody\u2019s gonna\nsave these guys. Is that a correct assessment? I don\u2019t know. I have pondered about this. I would\nhave to tell you that I became -- ve become very cynical about platitudes of all descriptions.\nI\u2019m skeptical. I want to see the deeds done. And of course there are good men who stand up. But\nsometimes they get overwhelmed by other people who say, it\u2019s not my business, it\u2019s not my\naffair, and really, I don\u2019t want to get involved. I don\u2019t know the answer to that.",
        "A: You know, and -- and -- and -- and it\u2019s, you know, not sure whether that\u2019s answered your\nquestion correctly. I -- I -- I don\u2019t think the St. Louis is the only motivating factor in my\ncomments to you. I could say to you that nobody came up to my parents or to my father and said,\nI know you were a barrister, now you can\u2019t practice law -- this was after they got in England --\nPll help you get a job. Which must have been very tough for him. But on the other hand I\nrecognize also that we landed, were accepted, and left alone. Nobody bothered us, nobody threw\nstones at us. Nobody bis -- painted signs on the -- on the doors. Th -- the -- the homes we all\nlived in, or rented, were all owned by non-Jews. Nobody marched outside to chastise that person\nor uS.",
        "A: Not that that would have happened anyway, the police would have been round there normally\nin those days, even to this day. But what I\u2019m getting at 1s people could turn around and say, you\nwere lucky. And I suppose we were, because I suspect strongly that those people who, for\nwhatever reasons, went to Europe, to the countries, all of which were overrun by Germany, not\nall of them survived.",
        "A: In fact, I would have to anticipate, I don\u2019t know the figures, and we did talk about this earlier\nyesterday, I have a very great feeling that most of them -- there are survivors, but I don\u2019t think\nthey survived in -- I mean, from my perspective, we didn\u2019t have a lot of money, but we had\nclothes, and sho -- and en-enough food to eat, whether it was -- whether we had -- we didn\u2019t have\nmeat every day, but we were on rationing like everybody else in England. But it didn\u2019t seem to\naffect my health. I was accepted at school, nobody questioned me, nobody criticized me, no\nteacher made derogatory remarks. And when my parents in -- or my mother in the beginning,\nwent to see a teacher in her broken English, nobody laughed at her or -- or denigrated her, or\ntalked about her. So perhaps we ha -- we have something to be grateful for, but have I become\ncynical? I suppose so, a little bit. More so than the St. Louis, do you understand? Cause we\nsurvived the St. Louis.",
        "A: 1 -- I -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s --",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t --",
        "A: -- yeah, you see, I\u2019m sure that 1t must have been terrible for my parents, and my grandfather,\nnot knowing in those -- in that period when the ship turned around and we arrived in England, or\nit was finally determined that we could go. And obviously, when my father made the decision,\nmy grandfather must have made the s -- followed. I mean, 1t would have been ridiculous if he\nhad gone somewhere else, but he could have done, I mean, he was his own man. He didn\u2019t.\nThank goodness. He -- we all -- perhaps they discussed it, and my -- or my father may have\ntalked to my father -- grandfather about it, and said, \u201cI\u2019m going, we\u2019re going to do this.\u201d And he\nmight have said -- they might have agreed on that. I don\u2019t know. It was never discussed. But it\u2019s\nvery hard for me cause I was not part of that conversation, and you ask me perhaps -- and you\nstarted off at the beginning by sort of saying sometimes parents try to shield their children, what\ncould I have contributed to it, you know? I\u2019m sure my father didn\u2019t talk to my mother about\nBuchenwald, or what little --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: I can recall that on odd occasions -- certainly not by my father because he never discussed\nthose things, but my mother, when we talked about the St. Louis, or she mentioned it to other --\ngenerally German refugees earlier in the war, when they got together in -- in Bedford, you know,\nthree or four people, or something, they would -- or they would talk to each other and -- and the\nSt. Louis might well come up. I don\u2019t recall my mother ever saying to me, or in her presence,\nbecause they were always -- and I was always taken along at these things, because they had\nnowhere to leave me, my mother, and didn\u2019t want to leave me anyway. And -- and so she would\nbe talking in German, and when she mentioned the St. Louis, I don\u2019t ever recall her saying that\nshe had, on the St. Louis, an unpleasant experience, any of the crew, or the staff, or anybody was\nrude to her. Now usually, if somebody was rude, or crude, or showed impatience or something,\nI\u2019m sure she would have made a comment about that. My mo -- my mother was rather me-\nmeticulous a-about that sort of thing. I never heard her say anything which was like a derogatory\nscenario. Obviously, of course, it was from the -- from the point of view of where we were going\nto land, was serious. But I don\u2019t recall her ever mentioning that -- that the people as -- the staff of\nthe -- of the crew, either on the way out, or on the way back to Europe, were unpleasant, as far as\nshe was -- a -- as something which she could have said had impacted upon her. Now, whether\nthat happened with -- you know, in the same way to -- to 999 other passengers, I don\u2019t know, and\nI can\u2019t say, you know. But in that context, that\u2019s perhaps another way of trying to explain to you\nthat, you know, the -- for me -- for -- I think for my parents it was always the question of where\nwould they end up. Because don\u2019t forget, my father probably -- I mean this is not a -- we don\u2019t\nhave a piece of paper saying that, but I\u2019m pretty sure that for my father, he was under notice, as\nmust -- must have been my grandfather, if you are not out of Germany within some things, we\nwill be back for you and Buchenwald will be even worse than it already 1s. Now, on the other\nhand, I have the Red Cross letters, of which my grandmother on my father\u2019s side was still alive\nand writing to us in April of 1942. We received it in June *42, okay. Now, in the same year, in\nSeptember, she was transported to Theresienstadt, and died a month later, we just got that\nconfirmed yesterday, okay, here. I just had that -- your -- your -- your -- your colleague\ndownstairs, Steve oh, whatever it is, found it out. And it\u2019s taken me a long time, you know. How\nmany -- over half a century to find that out. So how did these things happen, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nconceivable that the people would have remained where they were for awhile, before all these\nreally horrendous things, in terms of transportation, death camps, came along. In other words\nwas building up, but it didn\u2019t happen in -- in one month. I\u2019m not trying to minimize that, okay.\nSo it\u2019s possible that my parents could have lived in Halle from somewhat longer. But I think that\nmy father was under sentence, if you follow what I\u2019m getting at.",
        "A: I\u2019ve often wondered how he got out of Buchenwald. You know, y -- I -- and I -- I -- I\u2019ve --\nI\u2019ve -- | -- I -- the only rea -- and there\u2019s nothing on paper, and he never discussed it, but I\u2019ve\nread documentation to say that, you know, World War I veterans were -- were released with an\nunderstanding. However, I\u2019ve also pondered my father being -- having been the outside counsel\nfor I.G. Farben, and knowing so many people in Halle, in -- in -- where his career was. And my\nmother would tell me that even in -- even in -- in the period between hi -- \u201933, and perhaps up to\n-- up to the -- 38, they would have like -- they call it in -- in German -- in -- in -- in German, it\nwas like a -- the equivalent of Bridge scart and once a week --",
        "A: It\u2019s -- it was a card game, like Bridge.",
        "A: And per -- I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s weekly or monthly, my mother would have -- the -- it\nwould be arranged that my parents -- a combination -- my father had his business on a fourth\nfloor of an apartment building. Half the fi -- a -- the floor, was the apartment for living and the\nother half was his private practice. And the -- you know, this would be a table of four and six,\nand she would have a buffet done. This is after Hitler still is around, can you beat this, you know.\nAnd Is -- used to ask -- I asked her [indecipherable] I said -- I said, \u201cAnd they were all Jewish\npeople?\u201d And is -- no, there might have been a couple of Jews, and the rest were, you know,\npeople from either a judge or somebody else, who were not Jews. And my -- my -- I do recall my\nfather saying to me, that had things got very bad, he had already made arrangements with people\nhe knew, who would take me -- and they were obviously all known Jewish people, and -- but it\nnever came up, okay. Now who they were, what they were, I don\u2019t know. And I\u2019ve often\nwondered whether some of these people may not have -- you know, they were not, you know,\nthey were pretty senior people in the city of -- I suspect [indecipherable] people who were known\nin the city, you know, if it was -- if it was legal or otherwise, whether that didn\u2019t help him get\nout, you know. You can\u2019t tell, you know. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s a strange -- I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yeah. And I don\u2019t know the answers --",
        "A: -- to those, and then nobody\u2019s alive to this day.",
        "A: That\u2019s it -- you\u2019ve got -- there\u2019s several questions in that one question.",
        "A: New understanding?",
        "A: I'd have to say no. I can\u2019t understand it to this day.",
        "A: Okay. What I -- what has happened is, in coming here, and -- and -- and through the generous\nhelp of people like yourself and others, I\u2019ve managed, after all these years, on behalf of my\ncousin in Australia who 1s in her 80\u2019s now, to get closure on my grandmothers. I have a -- I have\na -- a date on which she died. So we now know where she died, and on the day in which, cause\nyou know, it -- it turns out the Germans were meticulous, it seemed, in stating --",
        "A: -- where the dates are. That was my main reason, I have to be truthful with you. I can\u2019t do\nanything about the St. Louis. I didn\u2019t initiate the project, you\u2019re initiating the project, or the\nmuseum, and I think it\u2019s great. And it -- and -- but I have to say to you, there\u2019s not much I can --",
        "A: -- gain, because even though I was on it, from my personal experience it wasn\u2019t horrendous.\nAt least I don\u2019t think it was. I can\u2019t answer for my parents any more, because they\u2019re dead.\nWhether I ca -- and they really made no reference to the St. Louis -- St. Louis, other than it was a\nvoyage. And they couldn\u2019t get into Cuba, and they couldn\u2019t get into the States. Well, Cuba was\nreally their -- the -- the -- the -- the weigh station, if you want to put it that way. I don\u2019t know,\nyou know, beyond that I don\u2019t know. I -- I\u2019m glad that I -- I got acquainted with you all, because\nthe -- the people here at the museum are doing their best to answer some other questions. I got\nmy first answer yesterday. I think I posed three questions -- actually four, but three of the more\nserious ones. My fourth question really was to the museum, what are you planning to do with all\nthis, you know, as far as the St. Louis is concerned, but that\u2019s not a -- that\u2019s not a -- a -- a family\nissue, Okay, in that context. I had three serious questions. The first one got answered.",
        "A: About my grandmother. And was -- my cousin, I al-already guessed, we had no closure date.\nSo this means I don\u2019t have to -- to -- to -- to -- to have a -- a what do they call it, a plaque put up\nsomewhere else to do th -- I do now know where she 1s, okay, and I can, in -- in -- 1n any little\nfamily book, I can put down died so and so, okay. How she died, I don\u2019t want to think about. I\nsuspect that there\u2019s a -- she was only in her mid-70\u2019s, people live to much older ages these days.\nSo why should it have happened, how could it have happened? I don\u2019t even ask those questions,\ncause I won\u2019t get any answer, and all I\u2019ll do is make myself angry. If you -- if you understand.",
        "A: Okay. So I\u2019ve got closure. What I really would like to do, perhaps on my father\u2019s behalf, 1s\nfind out what happened to his elder brother, and that\u2019s going to be a lot harder.",
        "A: Yeah, now he obviously died early in -- and in -- where, and under what circumstances, we\ndon\u2019t know. My mother always said that he had sort of fled eastwards. But if he fled too far east,\nhow did he end up getting a cable -- how did he get to find out where we were in London to send\nus a telegram? And why did he end up coming back the other way, and dying in a -- as a result of\nquote unquote, the term hospitalization which my grandmother, well, it was typed out for her,\nand we have to ask what that means. How would she have known about that so early in the war,\nokay? So where was he, if she\u2019d have known that. I mean, I can\u2019t believe that everybody\n[indecipherable] these unoccupied territories would have been so keen to start sending out. And -\n- and I think the museum has mentioned that it\u2019s really more in Germany that all these things\nwere kept meticulously, you know. Just as well they were now today, because that means we can\ntrace them, and we can complain about them, and -- and -- and quote for some people, perhaps it\nmay give them some claim in their old age where they might need the restitution which they\u2019re\nentitled to. But I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s really what I\u2019d want to get out of this thing, and I\u2019m not --\nand because if y -- I hadn\u2019t been made aware of this, and I didn\u2019t even see it in the -- I -- you\nknow, the Washington Post isn\u2019t read daily by everybody overseas. And it isn\u2019t read everywhere\ndaily in the United States, you know.",
        "A: We winter down in Houston in -- for three months with our daughter, younger daughter who\nlives there permanently, and we had the Houston Chronicle delivered to us every day, so you\nknow, I wasn\u2019t rushing out to get the Washington Post. And I didn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t aware of it, even\nthough apparently it was advertised in other papers, and a friend of ours, who is actually the --\nthe godfather of our younger daughter in Houston, who lives in -- here in -- and worked as a --\nwe met each other years ago in -- overseas, and he became -- he and his wife became godparents\nto my daughter. He was in the foreign service, and we\u2019ve kept in touch over the -- over the time,\nand he called me, and said, \u201cDid you know about this?\u201d I said no. He said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen,\u201d -\n- I said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t normally take the wa -- Washington Post.\u201d I said, \u201cThe easiest one to get,\nwhere we are, is actually the New York Times, actually.\u201d",
        "A: And I\u2019m not trying to denigrate the Washington Post. But I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything like\nthat in the Wall Street Journal,\u201d I get that every day on my doorstep at six in the morning at\nhome, and -- with our other papers -- and he said, \u201cIll send it to you.\u201d And that\u2019s where it all\nstarted. But for me at that juncture, 1t was important because your colleagues here all offered to\nbe of help if they could, which was very generous and I appreciate that very much. The other\nthing is, it wasn\u2019t until my mother died, in 2001, that I got a chance to go through all these\npapers, cause up to that time, she was really -- kept them boxed, bagged, and everything else.\nAnd it was quite a difficult process, because when you consider when th -- their ages when they\nboth died -- so the Germans didn\u2019t win that game -- it was almost a hundred years of\ndocumentation. And the very serious things were all in German, and in all German writing. You\nknow, not the Romanized way we see it today, you know [indecipherable] we\u2019re talking about.\nAnd I\u2019ve had to really, piece by piece, and it wasn\u2019t until last year that I went -- that I took back\nwith me, or went through the li -- in England, the last box of papers and pictures, which\nsomebody very gener -- kindly and generously kept for me, you know. You know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not\neasy to take things back in bags, and all the rest of this, you know --",
        "A: -- you understand. And so that has, to some degree, sparked off. And then when my cousins\nasked me on both sides to submit these claims, I then really had to dig into this material. Luckily,\nI had it now, but it\u2019s still very time consuming, because the answers aren\u2019t always there. So then\nwhen this thing came up, at the end of last year, al -- I thought to myself -- perhaps I\u2019m being a\nbit selfish here, perhaps this is a way in which I can get some answers, not so much for claims or\nanything else, but on what happened to my grandmother, which I did. What happened to my\nUncle Hugo. Those were the two --",
        "A: -- priority questions actually. I am a little skeptical about what I get [indecipherable] mind,\nbecause even downstairs in the museum, the people who deal with that, the ones who found what\nhappened to my grandmother said it\u2019s very -- that could prove to be very, very difficult, you\nknow. And why would he have been rounded up immediately, that\u2019s you know, do you under --\ndo you follow?",
        "A: You know, the real serious round-ups -- I mean my grandmother wasn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t deported to\nTheresienstadt until 19 -- 1942. The war broke out in 39, if Hitler was putting all the Jews in,\nwhy didn\u2019t they all go in wa -- in one fell swoop? So I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s very confusing. But\nwho s -- who knows what [indecipherable]. I -- I -- I don\u2019t know how other than to answer you --\nthat question, and then put some of these things to rest.",
        "A: I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not a great believer in dwelling indefinitely on these things, mentally and\nphysically, it doesn\u2019t do you well. I can\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t stop it then, I can\u2019t stop -- stop it now. I\ndon\u2019t want to leave my daughters with an inheritance of trying to find something. They know\nwhere they came from. They know how they got from A to B, they know who their parents are,\nthey know who their grandparents are, they both met the -- one set of grandparents, okay. They --\nthey know from pictures and everything else where they came from, and how far they can -- they\ncan trace back their particular roots --",
        "A: Pretty far.",
        "A: So they really don\u2019t need to do chasing. It\u2019s not easy, and sometimes it\u2019s really quite -- how\ncan I put it? Draining. You know, for the simple reason that reading or looking at these things\ncan make people very angry. And I must admit it causes me some anger. Other people view it\ndifferently, so perhaps I\u2019m being a little bit selfish in having the museum do these things for me.\nIf this is a way in which I can, from my point of view, to aid what you\u2019re talking about, do this\noral history, of which the St. Louis is a part, then it\u2019s -- it\u2019s my way of saying thank you very\nmuch. And I think it\u2019s worthwhile, but how much the contribution is to future generations, I\u2019d\nlike to believe that it will be, but I\u2019ve lived and worked in quite a few parts of the world, and I\u2019ve\nhad to step in ironically on behalf of others, purely as a westerner in some parts of the world, for\npeople who came -- I sometimes -- I -- I\u2019m perhaps -- I say to myself -- you know, I -- let\u2019s hope\nthat these things don\u2019t happen again, irrespective of -- to whichever group of people or otherwise\n-- and that\u2019s about as much as I can say to you.",
