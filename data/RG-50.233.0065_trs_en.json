        "LARO, Aaron\nRG-50.233*0065\nFebruary 5, 1992\nAbstract\nAaron Laro was born March 23, 1919 in Zdzieciol, Poland. He says it always had anti-Semitism.\nIn 1937, signs were posted demanding a boycott of Jewish-owned shops. After war broke out,\nJewish property was confiscated, including the Laro\u2019s six-room house. Aaron and others hid\nweapons in the woods.\nA ghetto was built in January 1942 in Novogrudek (Navahrudak, Belarus), and Jews had to move\nthere and wear the yellow Star of David. He says there were two massacres, but speaks of only\none, in April 1942, when 800 people were killed.\nHe escaped from the ghetto and joined partisans in the woods. He was a machinist, and repaired\ntanks and other vehicles they found. They also found Jewish families hiding in the woods.\nRussians split the Jews from the partisans. Anti-Semitism was strong in the woods. But a\nRussian major threatened to kill all partisans if any one of them killed a Jew.\nAaron made a detonator that derailed a train going to Vilna. Then, he helped derail three more\ntrains.\nThe Russian army liberated them in 1944, and without letting them wash or rest, incorporated\nthem into their troops. Aaron fought in many battles, and still has a bullet near his heart, a piece\nof shrapnel in his head, and a leg injury.\nAfter a month in a hospital where he recuperated from the bullet wound near his heart, he was\nmade a sergeant. He deserted from the Russian army in autumn 1944. He emigrated to the United\nStates in June 1947, with the woman who had been with him throughout their time in the woods.\nThey married in the U.S.\nAaron said that as a Jew, he \u201cdidn\u2019t regret for one minute\u201d the blood he spilled fighting against\nNazi Germany \u201cbecause I took revenge for my family and for the six million Jewish people.\u201d",
        "Interview",
        "My name is Aaron Laro. I was born March 23, 1919. Zdzieciol, Poland.\nCan you tell me a little about your childhood? And also where you grew up, a little bit about\nyour town, a little bit about your childhood and also about your parents, what your father did,\nyou know, what your mother did ...\nI was born in a small town in about -- actually by the end -- before the war we were about 4,000\nJewish people.\nYou remember anything that stands out in your childhood when you were growing up?\nNo.\nNo? Okay, that\u2019s all right. Did you have brothers and sisters?\nI had one brother and two sisters...\nDon\u2019t mind me when I\u2019m writing, you can just keep talking, don\u2019t worry about it. Can you tell\nme a little bit about your parents, what your father did for a living, and that kind of thing?\nMy father did two things, he was a shoe maker and then had a shoe store partnership.\nWho was he a partner with, do you remember?\nWell, one moved to Israel. His partner was Altavanietsky and Elovitch(?) (27).\nDo you remember, like, the street that you lived on? Do you remember much about the area you\nlived in before the war?\nI remember, what...\nAnything distinctive that you remember about it, you know? What the houses may have looked\nlike?\nWell, we had in 1935 a fire, which a tenth of the town burned down. And after that came up a\nbeautiful town; they made beautiful streets with sidewalks and nice homes made out of wood,\nand gold metal roofs, gold metal roofs mostly, and was nice painted, and government forced\npeople to make picket fences and paint them white yes, was very clean, very clean. Was a big\nchange in 1935. My father built a big six room house, beautiful house -- but it didn\u2019t last long.\nIn 1939 the war broke out, actually broke out in \u201841, and we lived only six years in the new\nhouse. Everything was taken away. Now gentiles are living over there, we had to just run away.\nDo you remember when you were growing up? Oh, first let me ask you where did you go to\nschool? Did you go to a public school or a private school or a...\nIt was a private Jewish school.\nA private Jewish school.",
        "What was the school like?\nWhat do you mean what was it like?\nWhat did you study there? What did you do?\nWell, Polish was what you say in English, compulsory, you had to. So we had every day one\nhour of Polish and Polish history, Jewish and Hebrew, we had a gym, we had a teacher for sport,\ngymnastic.\nDid you play any sports?\nYeah, we used to have performances twice a year on Hanukkah and on Purim.\nDo you remember any instances of anti-Semitism when you were growing up?\nIt was always anti-Semitic over there, in Poland and in Russia, everybody knows it.\nDo you remember any, you know, instances that stand out in your mind that were that, you\nknow, specifically remember that really you can recall?\nAbout anti-Semitism? Well, in 1937 when Hitler start spreading all over, they put up signs on\nthe walls on the Polish church that the gentiles should boycott Jewish people, not shop from\nJewish people. That\u2019s the most outstanding moment. Otherwise was tolerable, you know what I\nmean? Jewish people go ahead traveling the villages, buying from the farmers their product. I\ncould hear sometimes a slur, or something else, but when my father was young they had\npogroms. In Russian times, it was much worse. Poland was a democracy but the Pas Outsky\n[ph] was a general, and he had them under control, you know what I mean? It was half\ndemocracy and ruled by a general so...and he was not a little bit sympathetic to Jewish people.\nBut then the anti-Semitism was spreading all over Poland. Hitler penetrated Poland in the \u201830s\nand it was getting worse and worse.\nWere people in your town afraid of the Nazis? I mean, did you know what was going on in\nGermany at this time?\nWell, obviously every German knew. Somebody going tell you they didn\u2019t notice is baloney.\nOnly if they couldn\u2019t read and didn\u2019t know what was going on in the world.\nDid people leave? Were they that frightened that they would leave Poland?\nNo.\nThey weren\u2019t that frightened? They just\u2014\nNo.\nBut they knew what\u2014you know, most people knew what was going on?\nWait one second, you see the Jewish people in western Poland, when they were occupied by\nNazi Germany, they were escaping to Russia, 1n our territory.",
        "Going the other way?\nThat\u2019s why every town where we lived we had a lot of displaced persons, what you call them,\nrunaways?\nRefugees?\nRefugees, we had a lot of refugees.\nWho were coming\u2014?\nBut we had nowhere to run.\nYeah.\nWe were ready. I remember that too. We got our bicycles, we took our belongings. When the\nwar broke out, we figured we were going to run to Russia, but the Germany army was moving so\nfast\u2014\nIt caught up to you.\nIt caught up to kill, they bombarded on the highways and a lot of our people came back, they\ncame back.\nMmhmm.\nBut a couple days later it was 1939.\nYeah.\nThe Russian army came over and we were liberated and under the Russians we didn\u2019t show anti-\nSemitism. Jewish people got better jobs. You know what I mean?\nYeah, sure.\nJewish people got better jobs and, while we were partisans, we had anti-Semitism again. And an\naunt was raped and killed.\nAnd that\u2019s on the Russians side?\nYeah, partisans, we were together in the woods.\nRight.\nThey disarmed Jewish partisans for any little thing. Ifa gentile took boots from a farmer, it was\nnothing, but if a Jew took a pair of boots, they killed him.\nRight.\nYeah.\nCan you tell me, you were just talking about collecting you know, bicycles getting ready to run\nto the Russian side. Can you tell me about that period where, the Germans are coming and you",
        "know they\u2019re invading and you\u2019re running away. Can you tell me about that, like what kind of\npreparations you made to run to the Russian side, what you took?\nI took about... We went through that strategy twice, in 1939 but it lasted two days because soon\nwe hear on the radio that the Russian army cross the border and are coming to liberate us, we\nweren\u2019t scared anymore, because the Germans were still 150 kilometers from us. And we knew\nthat they divided Poland (#102) in half, so we were jumping in the skies, we are so glad. The\nRussians are coming. We didn\u2019t know at that time they were anti-Semites, too.\nRight.\nBut everybody thought communism is the coming for Jewish people.\nDid your whole family try to go?\nNo, no.\nRun away or...\nNo, no, you have small kids it\u2019s very hard. But the worst problem was in 1941 when the war\nstarted with Russia, so people ran away and the Russian army cut them off, the German army,\nand they come back, and we were stuck in ghettos.\nRight, Okay. Why don\u2019t you tell me a little about when you start to run away and then the\nRussians come in and you first see the Russians the first time in 1939.\nPll give an example. I was already 19 years old. I wasn\u2019t so emotional, but my younger brother,\nI remember he was kissing the Russian tanks. Yeah, people were climbing on the tanks and\nkissing them, because it was difference between life and death.\nSure. How far did you run before you knew that the\u2014just, you said something about two days,\nbut how far did you get away from your town before... Not far, not far because right away we\ncould hear on the radios, the Russian army\u2019s coming.\nOkay, can you tell me, when the Russians come in and take over that area of Poland, what was it\nlike? I mean, what did they do? Did they, you said there was some anti-Semitism, did they\nenact laws against the Jews?\nNo, no, no. In 1939, when they came in it was very good. Everybody suffered later on. You\nknow what I mean? Communism meant nothing. They cleaned out, as a matter of fact, they\ncleaned out all our stores. They bought, they had money, but that\u2019s it.\nYeah.\nBut we didn\u2019t suffer from anti-Semitism in 1939-40 until the Nazis came in. We suffered from\nthem in the partisans (?), from the Russians...\nOkay. What was the Russian\u2014what was the rule like? How was\u2014did your lives change very\nmuch because the Russians were there? Did they impose any of their, you know ...",
        "The lives changed completely after two month we realize, it is a (#130) at us and we\nthey nothing but, the only thing they have is propaganda.\nMmhmm.\nThere was no food, no clothing. You couldn\u2019t travel by train, you needed a permit to go from one\ntown to another town. You were just a prisoner.\nOkay, and this lasted, you said, the Russians come in late September of 39.\nYes.\nAnd they were there until 1941?\nUntil June 22, when the war broke out, 1941.\nOkay. Did they seize any of the businesses and try to nationalize them?\nOh, the Russians? Sure. They took over everything. They controlled every part of your life.\nYour heart and your soul. Your body.\nWe had a six room house, for family of six it\u2019s not too much. They wanted to nationalize the\nhouse. Take away the house, not take it away but we would have to pay like taxes on the house\nbecause the square feet, 1t was too big for a family of six. My father bribed the head from the\nfinance department and my daughter\u2014my younger sister got a job in that office, so we invited\nhim for dinner.\nYeah.\nAnd it cut the meters, he said a 120 square meters and he made it 110, and the house was still\nours. That was life in Russia.\nOkay, why don\u2019t you tell me a little about when the Germans come back in, in 1941.\nWell, when the Germans came back in 1941, we knew it was the beginning of our end. We\nknew it.\nDid you, were people in that area did they know, I don\u2019t know, most of the camps and things\nhadn\u2019t been set up. Did they know of concentration camps in Germany and, you know that kind\nof thing about places like Auschwitz and... Do you remember if you knew?\nI am not sure. We knew they were taking away a lot of Jewish people. We knew it.\nBut you weren\u2019t sure where they were going?\nWe didn\u2019t know that much by that time. But one man, the mayor in our town from Lodz, a big\ncity in Poland, he was lucky he escaped and he came back because he married, his wife was from\nour town Zdzienceil and he came back and he told us, assembled a lot of Jewish people and told\nthem to dig a big grave with spoons...\nWith spoons?",
        "With spoons, and he came and he told us it\u2019s tragic, he says it\u2019s our end.",
        "Did people not believe him, when he told those things?",
        "Ah yes, ah yeah, ah yeah, but there was nowhere to run?",
        "Yeah.",
        "You see the population, all the population was against us.",
        "Mmhmm.",
        "So, at the moment, you didn\u2019t have where to go. If the population is with you, then it\u2019s okay.",
        "But when the population is against you, the moment that you [the Jew?] walked out from the",
        "ghetto, they were pointing to the Germans, Jude. A Jew. You could recognize a Jew, always.",
        "Sure. It\u2019s interesting you say that, because I\u2019ve had interviews where people say, \u201cThey didn\u2019t",
        "fear the Germans so much as they feared, especially in Poland, their neighbors.\u201d Because the",
        "Germans seemed, according to these people who I\u2019ve talked to, seemed not to really know who",
        "was Jewish. But the Poles could point them out. You know, who knew exactly who was Jewish",
        "so there was, so they didn\u2019t really fear the Germans as much as they feared...their neighbors.",
        "They didn\u2019t fear\u2014the soldiers weren\u2019t so bad. You remember the soldiers were standing near",
        "your house, stopped to rest for a while, and one young German came over and was talking to",
        "them a little. He said, \u201cNow it\u2019s not going to be bad for you. When the S.S. are going to come,\u201d\nhe warned, \u201cthen it\u2019s going to start a lot of trouble for you.\u201d But he was looking with a little\nsympathy, you could... right?",
        "Wife: Yeah. Excuse me, can I talk?",
        "Interviewer: Sure, go ahead.",
        "Wife: We had to wear yellow marks...",
        "Aaron Laro: Star of David now?",
        "Wife: Because we are Jews and we are not allowed to walk on the sidewalk.",
        "Interviewer: Now this is after the Germans...?",
        "Aaron Laro: _That\u2019s in the ghetto, that started in the ghetto, yeah.",
        "Interviewer: When the Germans (were in)?",
        "Wife: There was one German, where she was working cleaning then, he once said to her\nand a friend, \u201cmaybe you should run away in the woods, but how will you survive\nthe winter?\u201d",
        "[Cannot understand her words here - #184]",
        "Aaron Laro: No, no, no, he was short. I remember him, yeah. Short-headed guy ...",
        "Wife: Said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why Hitler doesn\u2019t like the Jewish people.\u201d\nInterviewer: He said this?\nAaron Laro: Yeah!\nWife: Turned back to me and that they stink in Germany.\nAaron Laro: He said, \u201cIn Russia, in White Russia, Polacks they stink,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are\nintelligent people, what does he want from you?",
        "Wife: \u201cThey stink they\u2019re stupid, they stink.\u201d\nInterviewer: Yeah.\nWife: That\u2019s what he said to me. He cared for the Jewish people. He was a nice guy.\nInterviewer: Yeah.\nWife: A policeman, a gendarme. He\u2019s a policeman.\nInterviewer: Right.\nAaron Laro: So Iwas working over there\u2014I was starting to learn for a machinist, an\nelectrician in a power station. So when the Germans came in, the power station was supposed to\nrun. Then they gave me a permit, I was walking during the night by myself and I used to turn off\nthe lights, we had lights until one o\u2019clock, I think. And the Germans used to come across me,\nbut they were patrolling the town. I used to see, with (181). He never touched\nme. (194) and I used to go through the gates, back to the ghetto\u2014he never touched me.\nIt was interesting. Why don\u2019t you tell me a little bit about when the Germans first get there and\nwhat you did and what your family did when the Germans come through in 41? Before we get to\nthe ghetto. We can talk about the ghetto later.\nWell, when they came in they were bombarding, so we run away in the outskirts of the town\nwhere my father\u2019s friends, White Russians, we go over there for two days.\nInterviewer: What did you take with you when you ran?\nNothing. We were in the same town, I took my bicycle. A lot of people even didn\u2019t run from the\ntown. People were resigned. We knew there was nowhere to go. And then we came back. We\nwere lucky we were still in our homes from July until January 1942, then they made the ghetto\nfor us. I don\u2019t know why we were so lucky. Some other towns they made ghettos right away,\nand we were living, going on with a normal life. The only thing, we couldn\u2019t walk on the\nsidewalks and the Star of David we had to wear.\nSo they made you wear the Star of David after they came in. Was it immediately or did they\nmake you wear an arm band as soon as they came in?\nI think 1t was maybe a month after, as soon as they came in. I don\u2019t remember exactly or two\nweeks.",
        "Why don\u2019t you tell me a little bit about the ghetto?\nThe ghetto in order to go into the ghetto they gave us from eight in the morning till two in the\nafternoon. We had no machine, nothing, no trucks, no horses. So how much would you take on\nthe sled? It was winter time. So we moved in our aunt\u2019s house, she had only three rooms. We\nwere sharing two families in, so whatever we could\u2014furniture, forget about. So we took\nclothing and I don\u2019t remember, I think no furniture even, there was nowhere to put it.\nWas it just a matter of space, or did the Germans not allow you to take certain things?\nI don\u2019t think they didn\u2019t allow, but they gave us six hours, from eight until two, so how much\nfurniture could you take, there was nowhere to put it, because my Aunt had a little apartment.\nDid you take food with you as well?\nWhatever we had, we took with us. Sure.\nWas the ghetto fenced, closed?\nFenced.\nWhat was the fence? Was it stone or picket?\nPicket. It wasn\u2019t, look how many people escaped. You could jump over, it was a picket that\nhigh, that\u2018s all. But the local police were patrolling around it.\nWere you allowed\u2014you weren\u2019t allowed to leave, legally. You were supposed to, you had some\nsort of pass to leave? Was that how it was?\nYeah. They took Jewish people on the highways. They took Jewish people to cut trees in the\nwoods so they used to take them out in groups. They used to take them out and uh, the Judenrat\nused to supply them. They needed, let\u2019s say, 100 people to go to the woods, they needed 100\npeople, so they counted 100 people and they took them, used to march like soldiers to the\nhighways and to the woods.\nNow, were these people guarded by Germans or were they guarded by, like, Polish police?\nPolice. One German, the rest police.\nHow large was the ghetto itself? A few blocks?\nThe ghetto, one, two, three, four, five. I would say a kilometer and half long and not too wide\u2014\nten square blocks. Ten, eight square blocks.\nDid you go out on some of these work details?\nDid I what?\nDid you go out on some of these work details? You were talking about when they took people\nout to the woods or to fix the highways, did you do any of that? Any of that work?\nNo. I was working at the power station.",
        "You were working at the power station.\nYes.\nWhat did you do at the power station? What was your job?\nMy job was to take care of the machines. I was 18 years old and I could take apart the big\nmachines.\nSo, did you do that\u2014is that something you\u2019d worked on before the war?\nI started in Poland to learn that trade. Yeah.\nWife: When he came here, he couldn\u2019t get a job.\nWhen he came here, to the United States?\nYeah. Because it was a closed union. It was a non-gentile [?] union, an electrical union, I\ncouldn\u2019t get in. The United Jewish Appeal gentleman told me, \u201cLie if you want, but forget about\nelectrician.\u201d When a father dies, the son comes in in his place, they are so strict.\nWhy don\u2019t you tell me about -- you said that many people were able to escape. Did you notice\npeople leaving, did you know people who left before you left?\nNo, not many people. We used to sneak out and take weapons in the woods.\nOh, really. Why don\u2019t you tell me something about that?\nWell, we used to realize that we don\u2019t need so much clothing so we used to exchange with\ngentiles, give him a suit and get from him a rifle, bullets, grenades, revolver, whatever we could.\nAnd did you hide these things, you hid these things in the woods?\nWe had it in the ghetto, in the basement in a dry place and we used to\u2014we were in touch with a\nRussian lieutenant and he was working in a village near the forest, so he had cabin that he made\nin the woods, so we used to bring it in over there.\nWas there somebody who was kind of running this operation? I don\u2019t want to call it an operation\nbecause I don\u2019t know exactly... Was there somebody, like, in charge of gathering the weapons\nand everything?\nI know what you\u2019re pointing at. Our president of the Judenrat (279) was a lawyer\u2014Alta\nBoretsky (?). Why did we pick him? Because he was a smart man and he was the president of\nthe Judenrat. So we picked some of the Jewish militia in the ghetto in that organization so we\ncould know better what was going on around, because they were patrolling the ghetto. They\nwould not betray us. Like in some other ghettos a lot of Jewish people were betrayed. Not in\nour town. We were a different breed. And because of him, while he was in the Judenrat and he\nhad a lot of money because the Germans were asking for money, for gold, for fur. So through\nhim, we could get some money and buy weapons to arm the Jewish people. He was a smart man.\nSo he was actually our leader.",
        "How many people, that you know of, were involved in trying to procure these weapons?\nWell, we were few groups. I don\u2019t know exactly what was going on in the other group, but I\nknow they had workers, too. They had rifles bought, but we were about eight guys.\nCan you describe for me, like, from start to finish, what you would do in order to try to get these\nweapons? Like the eight of you, what the organization was like, where you got the money, you\nsaid you got some money from this lawyer, he would collect some money or whatever.\nYeah, but we used to exchange, give him clothing, shoes, whatever we could, a sewing machine.\nYou know what I mean? Who needs a sewing machine?\nSure, right!\nSo we give the family (?), for them a sewing machine was like a million dollars.\nYou had to sneak out in order to do this?\nYeah.\nDid you do this at night, or mostly in the day?\nI have to put one thing. The White Russian population was different, a quieter people than the\nPolacks. That\u2019s why some Polish people told you they feared the Polacks, the local population\nmore than the Germans. Our people, the White Russians were\u2014it\u2019s a quieter element but they\ndidn\u2019t, you know what I mean, they didn\u2019t point their fist or a finger on a Jews and the Polacks.\nThat\u2019s why we could operate easier. You know cigarette holder, chromium was in Europe? If\nyou kept it like that, you took it out from pocket, it is shiny and you could get from the farmer\nwhatever you want, bread and butter, everything, they were shaking.\nYeah.\nBoichikes, don\u2019t kill me, don\u2019t kill me, Pll give what you want.\nOkay. You said something about getting rifles and things, and guns and pistols. Were you able\nto get anything else, like grenades?\nYeah.\nWhere did you get the grenades from?\nSee, when the Germans destroyed the Russian army, they dropped everything on the fields.\nThe Russians did?\nYeah. The major population, they picked from the field whatever they wanted.\nThey had grenades?\nThey had plenty.\nOh, I see. Okay.",
        "Some of them were communists, leftist sympathizers. They gave us for free, just to help us.\nYou know what I mean? Some wanted money.\nWhy don\u2019t you tell me a little bit about how you got involved with the partisans?\nHow?\nDid you get involved with the partisans while you were in the ghetto or after?\nI\u2019m telling you when I was in the ghetto there was still no partisans. We met a Russian, I\nmentioned before, we met a Russian 1n our town, he brought logs, wood to sell and we got\nacquainted with him, and he was a lieutenant, and that\u2019s when it started.\nI remember the first meeting we had a friend of mine and he was afraid too. It was a short\nmeeting and he told us we should start to get weapons. And that when we started to buy\nweapons and we used to bring it over (?) about six kilometers from our town.\nIn the woods?\nIn the woods.\nDo you remember the date, roughly, about when that was when you had that first meeting?\nYeah. It was cool, we were buying a lot of wood for the winter. It must be in October, October.\nIn 1942 or?\n1941. We still didn\u2019t have a ghetto.\nOh, so this meeting took place before the ghetto.\nBefore the ghetto. The ghetto started January 1942. Thank God, I still remember dates. You\nknow a lot of town people still call me, when was the shooting, when was the massacre? And\nwhen did they take us in that ghetto? They are younger than me and they don\u2019t remember any\ndates.\nYou remember them all?\nI remember them.\nYou got a good memory.\nI\u2019m bad to remember names. It\u2019s funny thing, how a brain works. I\u2019m not so good in\nmemorizing names.\nBut you know numbers?\nDates.\nYou said there were about eight people who were involved in getting these weapons. They were\nall involved with this Partisan person? The person you had the meeting with. Did they all know\nhim?",
        "I don\u2019t believe they all know him. I don\u2019t remember exactly how many of us were at the meeting\nfirst\u2014three or four. But then we took in more boys, we needed more. We were not afraid\nbecause there were no informers, like in Hebrew we call it \u201cAmussian\u201d (?). We were neighbors,\nwe knew him.\nHow many Germans, like either S.S. or German army persons were in the town at this time? Do\nyou remember?\n(344) Not many, there were about eight, nine Germans and the rest were local militia, black\nuniforms.\nWas there a larger German contingent somewhere in the area, not far away?\nIn Novogrudek (Navahrudak, Belarus). Yeah, Minkat (? Nothing found) was over there...? (379).\nWhy don\u2019t you describe for me a little bit about more go on with what you were doing in the\nghetto collecting these weapons, and then when I guess, when you escaped, or they took you to\nNovogrudek (Navahrudak, Belarus).\nYou want the whole story?\nSure, give it to me, give me the whole story.\nWe got in touch with another Russian guy, a Russian pilot who was working for somebody in\nour town.\nAbout what time was this now, was this about the same time we were talking about before?\nWe were about 1942, we were in the ghetto already. That was our biggest mistake. Even that\nlawyer, and he said we should stay in touch with him because I saw him once with a gun in the\npocket. And then I became suspicious. I said how can you walk around with a gun in the\npocket? In other words, he had a permit? Voretsky didn\u2019t realize it, that lawyer. He betrayed us.\nThe lawyer did?\nNo, no, the Russian pilot.\nThe Russian pilot. O.K.\nHe betrayed us.\nHe betrayed you to whom? Who did he tell? The Germans?\nSee what can happen. We had a meeting in front of, we weren\u2019t married by that time, we were\nyoung kids, we went to school together and we were friends. We are standing in front of her\nhouse in the ghetto and the slaughterhouse, you had to go through the ghetto, the gentiles, in\norder to reach the slaughter house. So he was working for one who was making the provisions,\nyou know, non-kosher. Walking back he stopped and said that he had in the village, promising\nsomebody two revolvers and grenades, and I would like one of you should go with me. And not\nthe whole group was standing. It was me, and Sholom Pyolin (Sholom Pyolun and Ohat\nZukotun?), three or four of us. Until now I can\u2019t understand why did he pick that Sholom Pyolun",
        "(?). He was a refugee from Poland and he moved in our town. He ran away from the Nazis. A\nsmall boy. He picked him because he was not from our town and he said to him, Sholom\n[Russian words You will go with me] (?) (420). It means, you\u2019ll go with me. And we all going\nto meet over there in and I'll wait for you. He was a brave guy, my friend, Sholom\nPyolun. It was warm, it was summer. It was six, seven in the evening, the sun was still shining a\nlittle bit. He said goodbye to us and he went straight over the fields in the meadows in that\ndirection. She was working for the Nazis cleaning their building over there and she was going\ninto a little room where she had the brooms and the mop and everything. She opened up the door\nshe sees that Russian guy jump out of the window because he saw her. The guy who betrayed\nus. So she realized right away that he is a spy. But she couldn\u2019t stop the work to tell us. They\nwould kill her, the Nazis.\nThat\u2019s right.\nThe moment she finished her work and she came back home, she call me, \u201cAaron, I saw Vanya\nover there.\u201d His name was Vanya. Oye, I said we are in trouble. We couldn\u2019t call him back\nbecause he was gone, and he was waiting, the Germans made an ambush and they caught him\nalive, and they brought him in our town. See the story? A tragedy.\nWhat did they do after that? What did the Germans do after that?\nThey tortured him to death in prison.\nOh my gosh. Now this is your friend, this is not the Russian guy they tortured?\nNo, no. What happened to the Russian guy from then on, we don\u2019t know, he disappeared.\nBut the guy who went across the field, your friend, was the one who was tortured.\nYes.\nDo you know where they took him?\nHe went to many places and I think they got the guns and the grenades, but on the way back they\ncaught him with the grenades, they had proof, you know what I mean, with the grenades and\neverything. So he was arrested, like I told you, they tortured him to death, but he didn\u2019t give any\nnames. He didn\u2019t give any names of us. A Jewish guy was going to get water from the well and\nhe found that little note, he threw out the little window.\nFrom where he was being tortured?\nFrom the prison, yeah.\nWow. So the Germans basically, they knew that there was some sort of plan going on, but they\ndidn\u2019t know who it was?\nThey knew, yes. It was in the evening, a friend of mine in the same group, comes over my house\nand he says, \u201cAaron, we have to run away because they uncovered the underground organization.\nAnd, come on, that lawyer and the rest of the boys were waiting in the main Schule in\u2014the\nladies.\u201d You know, in Europe, the ladies were services having on the top separate, not the men",
        "together, it was an orthodox Shul. \u201cOver there they\u2019re a hiding, and make it fast, we have to\nretreat, we have to go.\u201d And then I had a tragic moment. My mother and father came over\u2014\n\u201cyou are leaving us in a tragic moment like now? You run away to save your life and you leave\nus alone?\u201d I say, \u201cMommy, I am not trying to save my life, we are going to die anyway. I want\nto fight, I want to die in battle, I want to take a couple of Germans with me in the grave, but I\ndon\u2019t want to go alive in the grave.\u201d It didn\u2019t help. And there was another reason that I couldn\u2019t\ngo. If I would go away, I wouldn\u2019t report to work the next day so the Germans would kill my\nparents anyway. They would know right away that I disappeared. So I said to my friend, \u201cI am\nnot going. I don\u2019t want that on my conscience, they should kill my parents, my sister and\nbrothers.\u201d They said goodbye to me. They went away, they ran away that night from the ghetto.\nThey came in the woods, they met, there was a small group of Russian partisans, but he was\nintelligent so he became the commander. A couple weeks later, I ran away too, for a couple of\nnights, and I came back and it was quiet, nobody ever looked for me, for my other friend and that\nRussian guy disappeared. They sent him away somewhere, I don\u2019t believe they killed him, the\nsent him away in another town.\nTo do something somewhere else.\nYeah. So [ll go in another instance. I was working like nothing would happen, but over there\none Sunday the Russian partisan went to the village, they had a good time with the girls. They\nwere drinking, became high, intoxicated and they opened up a fire and started yelling, \u201cKill the\nJew and save Russia.\u201d An old slogan (501). They killed that Boretskafy (?) (502), that\nlawyer, they killed two, three, four and the rest escaped.\nThis was in the ghetto? They killed people in the ghetto? Is that where they killed them?\nNo. In the partisans (?). They killed my friend, that lawyer, and the other boys that joined him.\nOh, the other\u2014oh, I see. I understand now, Okay.\nThey were anti-Semites, you know what I mean?\nWhy don\u2019t you go ahead and tell me some more. So, now you\u2019re still in the ghetto, you didn\u2019t\nescape. You decided not to escape because you did not want to endanger your family. What did\nyou do after that?\nI was still working power station.\nHow long did you work there?\nI worked there until the massacre. Until they killed all the Jewish people.\nWhich was when?\nAugust the 6\" of 1942.\nWhy don\u2019t you explain that, tell me about that.\nAbout what?\nAbout August 6\".",
        "It was four o\u2019clock in the morning and we suddenly hear people running. We looked in the\nwindow, we\u2019re asking them what happened? We are surrounded by the Germans. A lot of\nGermans all around the town.\nSo now these were Germans who weren\u2019t in the town before? They came...\nNo, armies, regular army, a lot of them. A lot were Lithuanians, murderers. They came with\nrolled up sleeves like butchers, and drunk, and they told us to come to the market, the center of\nthe town. They had also another excuse, they wanted to check the \u201cArbishein\u201d (?) (541).\nThe workplace or whatever?\nLike a document that you are working.\nRight, work papers?\nYes. So we came together in the center of the town, and then when they got all of us, they took\nus\u2014they chased us like cattle near the Jewish cemetery. The second one. We had an old\ncemetery and that was the newer one. And they brought us near the cemetery and they gave us\nan order to lay down face down. We were surrendered to Germans. Whoever tried to escape the\nghetto, was killed right away. There were three lines of Germans. Three rings. Know what I\nmean? And then they started call skilled people and they warned us not to lift the head. If they\nask for carpenter, raise your hand but keep your nose in the ground. So they called carpenters,\nblacksmiths, and here and there and I say to myself, I knew from my father that during the war, a\nshoemaker and a tailor was the best trade. I said to myself, what do they need an electrician,\nmachinist? So when they were calling for shoemakers, I raise my hand. He told me to lift my\nhead. When they have to lift your head, they wanted to see your age. If you are too young, they\ndidn\u2019t take you. So then he poked you with the rifle, they hit you in the back. Get up and run\nover there, face down. And then my father the same way and that\u2019s all from my family. So\nofficially they were supposed to live. We found out later on that about 120 people take to\nNovagrudek to that forced labor camp.\nThat\u2019s where they took them?\nYes, but they took us to the movies. They packed us in the movies and during the next couple of\ndays they found a lot of Jewish people hiding and the movie was filled up. That\u2019s when she\ncame out with her family. She was hiding too. So they accumulated instead of 120, there was\nmaybe a thousand. So then when they tried to pick who should live and who should die again.\nAnd then when the German pulled her out and saw she 1s a good tailor, see I\u2019m coming to the\npoint, and the rest they put us in trucks and took us to railway station and then they put us in the\ntrain and they took us to a camp. A forced labor camp.\nHow long, or how far from your town is Novagrudek?\nThirty-five kilometers. Wires and you know, the rings (7).\nBarbed wire.\nYeah. Barbed wires and on each corner on towers was they were standing with machine guns.",
        "The people who they didn\u2019t choose to take to the work camp, what happened to them?\nThey took them, they went to the left and they shoot them.\nThey shot them?\nThey shot them. They took them back to the same cemetery. There was a big grave, mass grave,\nthat the gentiles are digging. They never told us. I have good friends, Polacks, a kilometer and a\nhalf from my town and they never came to tell a Jew, that run away they are digging graves for\nyou. It was so secret that nobody knew anything. And that\u2019s in a big pit, a big grave where\n2,500 Jewish people may be. We had two massacres. One was in April 1942 and they killed\nold people and widows.\nIn April of 1942?\nYes, they killed 800.\nThey just killed people they couldn\u2019t send to a work camp?\nThe first massacre was just\u2014they called it, they couldn\u2019t work, useless people it was for them.\nWhy don\u2019t you tell me a little bit about Nova ( )\nBut it wasn\u2019t a cattle train? But, also it wasn\u2019t a passenger train? It didn\u2019t have seats.\nI think it was, benches on the side. But they squeezed us in so many people you couldn\u2019t sit\nanyway.\nRight.\nLike sardines.\nThat\u2019s what I wanted to know, if 1t was the same as most train rides that ve heard about. O.K.,\ngo ahead. I\u2019m sorry I interrupted you. Go ahead and tell me about Novagrudek (?).\nSo when I was taken they dropped us in the working camp, I said to myself, Oh, my God, how\nwill we escape from here? The first thing was I was looking around, how the fences were made\nand if there was any chance to escape.\nWhat did you think when you came in and saw that? Did it look like it was promising that\nmaybe you could escape?\nNo. I became very pessimistic. Very pessimistic because it was a small place and the police\nwere standing with machine guns all around in the towers. I was there a few days and the camp\nwas, before we came over there, there were people there already from the same town, from\nNovagrudek, the natives were already there.\nSo the camp was outside of the town of Novagrudek?\nIt was a still town. It used to be Koht/called (?) (650) Poland, big building. So, they made a\ncarpenter shop, a shoemaker shop and the villagers used to come and bring work, the Jewish",
        "people used to do all that work. I noticed that every day six Jewish people are being picked out\nwithout writing down names, you just counted six Jews are going with horse and wagon to\nghetto, because there was still a ghetto in Novagrudek. They were baking bread for the forced\nlabor camp. So every day there used to go six people and when they came back the police were\ncounting six Jews. They didn\u2019t care Aaron, Jack, no names, just numbers.\nAs long as they had six?\nWe realized it, we said to ourselves, from the ghetto would be a good chance to escape, because\nthere\u2019s just a picket fence and that\u2019s it. So we organized. There was was in charge of our\npeople from our town. So we asked him he should pick out six from our guys and send us to the\nghetto. There were Jewish people from the ghetto who wanted to come to the forced labor camp\nbecause they believed there was a better chance to survive in the forced labor camp. So we went\nsix over there, we sent six people from the ghetto with the horse and wagon with the bread. Next\nday the other group, my friends, came another six.\nSo you were shifting people into the ghetto?\nSo we were 12 already. And another six came in the horse and wagon. And in nighttime, we\nfound over there they gave us a shovel in the ghetto we dug holes, cat and dog (?). Now a\npoliceman was patrolling. But the fence in the ghetto was long, so when he started out on that\ncorner until he comes over there and back, so we dug a hole somewhere here under the bushes\nand as soon as __ passed us, one by one we would jump out and we escaped all 12 of us.\nNow is this ghetto similar to the one in your town? The one in Novagrudek?\nIt was a higher fence, that was the difference. Wood, anyway. No barbed wire, it was a fence,\nthat\u2019s all.\nAt this point you then went into the woods?\nWe had a good guy. One guy, one of my friends, he was a carpenter, was working in the\nvillages, that\u2019s why he was a good guy. By two o\u2019clock we were far away by a lake. I\nremember, I was so nervous, the tongue was so dry, stiff, we . It took us two weeks to\nreach the partisans. We knew where to go, we are not afraid even we knew there were anti-\nSemites and they killed some people, we had no other choice and we were so surprised we came\nover there, we found a lot of Jewish people. They run out from the hiding places under the\nfloors, under the houses and everybody knew where to go. That\u2019s when we join them. By the\nend of the summer, \u201942, we were around over a 100 boys from our town. We had more than\n200,000 bullets, we had machine guns, we had rifles.\nYou said it took you two weeks? Was that traveling mostly through the woods to get to the\nPartisans?\nYes.\nHow did you get food and things?\nFrom the farmers. One of our friends had a little revolver. For ladies, a little one with two\nbullets, that\u2019s all we had. And I told you we had a cigarette holder so we used to keep it like that",
        "and they were shivering. We were boys, take a bread, cheese, milk. On the way to the woods,\nwe were looking for Jewish people, we knew where Jewish people were hiding. My friend\u2019s\nfather was in the village and we found him.\nSo you just collected these people and took them?\nYes. We took them with us in the woods.\nO.K., why don\u2019t you describe to me about the organization and the leaders of the partisan group\nand what you did with the partisans. What you were doing?\nWell, the first summer, our main objective was to arm a lot of Jewish people, there was a lot of\nJewish people. We were just a Jewish fighting group in the beginning.\nIn order to do that, what did you do?\nWell, we used to buy, we used to go to friends, a lot of Jews had friends in the villages. They are\nbuying from Jewish people in town, you know, customers. Asking for grenades or weapons.\nThe problem was that we were not trained soldiers. I was too young for the Polish army, I was\nnot kosher for the Russian army. They didn\u2019t want to take me because my uncle was fighting\nagainst the communists in 1920. My father was a big shot in our town, they didn\u2019t trust me. We\nhad actually maybe five or ten percent professional soldiers who were in the Polish army. They\nknew how to keep a rifle. We didn\u2019t know anything, we had to learn from a-b-c.\nSo they trained you?\nThey trained, you had to learn yourself. For instance, I found, we used to see on the fields\nstanding tanks, burned down tanks, rotting tanks the Germans destroyed them. I used to take out\nthe machine guns and bring them in the woods. They were still good, but the springs used to be\nnailed from the fire when the tank was burning, so they were soft. It didn\u2019t work with the\nmachine gun, so I took the springs and I used to heat it up in the fire flame and wrap it in oil to\ntemper it. Sometimes I succeeded and sometimes not. That\u2019s the way we used to make machine\nguns put together from three to one. You know what I mean?\nSo basically that\u2019s what you did, you were ...?\nBecause I am a machinist, it was in my field already.\nSo you collected weapons or whatever you could use.\nThis is still the summer of 42? What kind of operations did you carry out? Did you, like, try to\nfight or attack any German places or anything?\nFrom beginning in November 42, we had the first fight. In the center of our forest, there was a\nvillage and they sent in Ukrainians and Germans and they made outpost, they call it. They call it\na garrison, outpost. And they sent us in a letter we should surrender, get rid of the Jews, the\nJewish people, they were writing like to the gentiles. So they got an answer, if you\u2019 ll hit us with\nthe clean bullets, we\u2019ll cure it, but if our rusty bullets are going to hit you, you\u2019ll die from\ninfection. Nobody surrendered to them. And there was not, we were not under one command.\nEvery group was for himself. It was no good. Sometimes we were fighting each other too. It",
        "was no good. But we had to destroy the Germans. We got united under one command. And it\nwas one morning, I remember, 1n November and we had two tanks that the Russian boys fixed\nthem, but the Russian army left them. It had tires like a car, it is made out of steel and a little\ncannon, you know what I mean?\nLike an armored transport?\nYeah.\nSomething like that?\nThe top turns like 1n a tank, a little one. We had two of them and we (736).\nWhere did you hide those? Did you hide those in the woods also?\nIn the woods. The woods were about 4 x 4 kilometers\u2014it was pretty big. And we had two big\nrivers, the Yennen(?) that flows into the Baltic Sea. So we attack in one, a Russian lieutenant\nofficer killed only. We destroyed them, our first fight. We took a lot of trophies. That\u2019s the way\nwe could help our Jewish people who lived, a lot of groups lived in the woods. Whole families.\nHusbands, wives and children who survive. So we gave them one quilt to cover\u2014big beds, the\nkitchen was cooking for the soldiers, we took away the horse with the kitchen and a lot of\nbullets, rifles, a lot of trophies. But we did it a couple times more, then we got an order from\nMoscow not to do it anymore.\nTo stop?\nTo stop because one partisan\u2019s life is more important than 100 Germans. But what they wanted\nus to do is hit and run, hit and run. You couldn\u2019t keep up a long fight with the Germans. Like I\nhad 50 bullets, how long can you fight? Oh, and by that time came an order to split up the\nJewish group. See Stalin, he didn\u2019t trust the Jewish group. We couldn\u2019t resist. They were in the\nthousands and we were a few hundred. So they split us up. Part of us between the gentiles.\nO.K. when they split you up, where did you go?\nIn the same forest.\nYou stayed there?\nYeah, a couple of kilometers there was another group. So the first damage we tried to do the\nGermans, we burned down all the bridges. The transportation, they would drive the trucks.\nTelephone lines we used to cut down. Then we started learning the rail trains. That was the\nmost important thing.\nHow did you do that?\nThere was a Ukrainian captain and he had a Jewish wife. When anti-Semitism was very high in\nthe woods, a group of Russian, there was a major\u2014what was his name? I still remember him.\nHe had a lot of Jewish people with him from Russia. He was a communist. When he heard what\nwas going on, anti-Semitism, and was killed, and so forth. All the partisans were called in one\nplace and he give an order, if you kill one Jew, will be killed all of you, it\u2019s an order. We have to",
        "kill Germans, we came to fight our enemy. It quieted down. So, I\u2019ll come to the point. That\nUkrainian captain, called me. He said I heard you are a very handy boy, you know electrical\nwork. Would you like to make mines in the rail trains? I said right away, \u201csure.\u201d He said to me,\n\u201clay down.\u201d It\u2019s summer time in the tents. I remember laying on the ground, he took out the\npiece of paper and a pencil and he made a sketch. What we needed was a detonator and a battery\nand a big shell\u2014a 125 millimeter shell he gave me. And he said, \u201cHere go make it.\u201d I picked\nthree or four Jewish guys, my friend who lives in Houston, Texas, Morris Abrams, he still is over\nthere, and we went to a group over there living in the woods. What I needed was plywood to\nmake a little box. So I made up the box and I made everything with a battery, with a button\nsticking out just to go under the rail and we went not far away, about 20 kilometers from us was\nrunning a train from Lemberg (L\u2019 viv, Ukraine) to Vilna. From south Poland up to the north,\nnorth Lithuania. And one boy was watching the Germans on one side and one boy was and the\nother one we toOkay our coats to cover up because I had to turn on a flashlight. You have to see\nwhat you are doing, otherwise you would explode and you\u2019ll get your (787).\nAnd I put in mine, you have to be very careful because you have to put detonator four\nmillimeters under the rail. When the train comes, the weight of the train settles eight\nmillimeters, it sinks. So you had room only four millimeters. The most dangerous thing. So\nwhen I made it and then we put in the shell, I remember we dug a big hole. Now you have to\nkeep the dirt, not leave a mark that you dug the dirt because the Germans are walking back and\nforth. So we left the gravel, everything is put aside. And when I put it in the ground then I put\nwith the chisel I made a little hole in the shell and I put in the detonator and carefully cover up\nwith the dirt and put back the gravel, we covered it up and we run away in the woods. About\nthree kilometers, two kilometers we lay down, we\u2019re waiting. Eleven o\u2019clock in the morning, I\nshould live, I still remember 11 1n the morning, we hear chug, chug, the train is coming. In our\nterritory it used to go slow, in the beginning it used to go fast, but since we started to derail them,\nthey got smart, the Germans, they go slow because the damage is smaller when you go slow, like\n40 miles, but it used to go 80. And suddenly, we heard an explosion. We were so glad, my first\nsuccessful job. So, in the night we went to the village and the gentiles said, what happened? So\nthey told us it was the train with medication.\nOh, no.\nAnd three cars jumped down, not all of them, three, three cars. So by the same time, the train\nwas destroyed, damaged and it would take a week to fix it, so it slowed down the supplies to the\nbattlefield. That was my first job. The second successful job was we were sent to the Third\nReich. You know part of Poland was next to Germany?\nRight.\nwas Germany, over there it was very hard to fight because the population was mostly",
        "Polacks. Over there we were walking two days and finally we came over there, we were very\nlucky we had a very good guide. I still can\u2019t understand how come he knew so well our territory.\nHe was a Russian. He was living like Moshe Rabinim (sp.), the Jewish people from Egypt. And\nI'll make it short, we derailed three trains over there too. Two with shells and one with gasoline.\nBecause two groups went over there before us and never came back they were killed over there.\nAnd we were lucky, we came back. We had a local paper in the woods, they were writing about\nme operating. In the worst circumstances I used to clean my machine gun, I had a machine gun.\nIt wasn\u2019t rusty because when we came back, the White Polacks were shooting at us. So my",
        "machine gun was working and I opened fire on them. And I kept my machine gun in good\nshape.\nSo it worked when you needed it?\nSo how long, so, you were with the Partisans until the end of the war?\nI was, we were liberated by the Russian army in July 1944.\nSo July of 44 you, did they make you go in the army, is that what they did? The Red Army. So\nyou were kind of incorporated into the army.\nWe were incorporated, they didn\u2019t ask us.\nDid you want to go, did you not want to do that?\nActually, we were bitter with them. I\u2019Il tell you why. We were living under abnormal\nconditions. We had all kind of skin diseases. Sometimes you wear underwear for four, five\nweeks. We had, excuse me, lice and all the hell. And they didn\u2019t let us to go back to the town to\na bath to wash ourselves and change the clothing. They took us right away to the battlefield and\ndid not give us a chance to rest two, three days. That was what we were angry at.\nO.K. Did you see any action while you were in the Red Army before the end of the war? Did\nyou fight against the Germans?\nDid I see action?\nYes. Were you involved in battles?\nIn the Red Army, the Russian army? Sure. It didn\u2019t take long and we were fighting in Bialystok.\nWe knew that the Germans were going to start the next morning and offensive. And they, I went\nto artillery. When I saw that infantry is just cannon meat, flesh, so they were looking for\nartilleries, so I raised my hand and I went over there. We were standing battery, four of us,\nsuddenly we hear the German tanks in the morning. And they were moving slowly, slowly and\nwe open up a fire with our cannons. The shells were too small. We used the biggest tanks, tiger\nand panther. Like one family houses, so big. And that\u2019s what they were waiting for. The\nmoment they saw us shooting, they opened up the fire on us. We were four times six, twenty-\nfour, all of them were killed. Me and three Russian boys survived. That was my first battle.\nAnd I had shrapnel in my temple, right here.\nO.K.\nThat was my first battle, then we were fighting continuously.\nCould you tell us at this point, did you know the Germans, could you tell that they were losing\nthe war? You know what I mean, that the war seemed to be going bad for the Germans at this\npoint, or was that not evident?\nI think they knew it. They didn\u2019t have any more airplanes, seldom you saw an airplane because\nthey lost a lot of airplanes over England, and we were not afraid of them anymore. But you still\nhad to watch out. They were very good fighters, the Germans. They started a couple contra-",
        "offensives and they wounded a lot of our boys and they killed a lot of our boys. And we had a\nvery heavy fight in Poland, in Solinka. Oh what a fight we had over there. The big river, the\nriver was named Solinko. We crossed the bridge and we had just a platform. Two kilometers\ndeep and maybe five in the width. And the Germans are shooting at us and it was just like an\nearthquake, like an earthquake. After a nice couple of hours it quieted down. My lieutenant and\nthe guys were hiding in the trenches. And when I searched for the little window in each cannon,\nwhen I looked and I saw the Germans running, I became wild. I said, now I have a moment to\ntake revenge. And I\u2019m yelling to the window to bring up shells, they were hanging and we\ncouldn\u2019t hear each other. Because from the airplanes and the bombs and everything, it was\nterrible. So I was carrying myself the shells and shooting them so much that the paint on the\ncannon was burning, believe me, smoke was coming out. When it was quiet down, two boys,\nRussian young soldiers, 18 years old, kids, come over to me, I should help them to take out\nGermans, surrounding the white flag from the trench. I said I have no right to leave my cannon.\nThey said it\u2019s your job, infantry, go take them. So I see them standing and talking, so I stood up\ntoo because I was on my knees. I could hear many times bullets hitting the spires, it makes a\n\u201cWhoooo\u201d, it\u2019s singing. What I see, I thought the Germans were running away. The moment I\nstood up, knocked me a bullet here, through and through, and I fell like a rock. I was wounded\nin the hospital and I was taken from the battlefield.\nIt missed your heart?\nThat\u2019s what the doctor told me. Mendel was following you. Right here it went in my blade and\nmy shoulder.\nAnd you were in the hospital for a month?\nA month.\nAnd then they put you right back out?\nYes. Then they sent me to the military school. I was a month in the military school and I came\nout I was a sergeant and I was a commander of a cannon.\nWhere was the military school?\nNot far from the battlefield.\nAnd then you came back as a sergeant?\nYes. (Wife: He won a lot of medals.)\nDo you still have the medals?\nIt\u2019s a long story. I deserted in Russia, in Poland we lost, we were going back to Russian, I\ndeserted so I throw away all my medals, who needs it, because the (911) were\nlooking for me all over the town. I was running from one house to another.\nSo you\u2019ve been wounded and you go in the hospital and you\u2019re back on the battlefield, about\nwhat time was this, when was this? Late \u201844, early \u201845, do you remember?",
        "No that was \u201844 it was still warm, it was maybe in September, because end of September, maybe.\nCan you tell me a little bit about the end of the war? As the war starts to wind down, did you go,\ndid you remain...\u201d\nI will try to make it shorter because you can talk another week if I have to tell you everything.\nWe go to central Poland, northern Berlin, and we came in East Prussia and we split in half and\nwe came out to the Baltic Sea, near Koenigsberg (Kaliningrad, Russia). Heavy fights over there.\nGermans resisted, we were arrested in four days and then they threw us over into Germany, like I\nsaid, north of Berlin and soon Berlin fell, the resistance was very weak already. And slowly we\nwere moving on and moving on and it was dangerous because the German army fell apart. So\nyou could hear Germans talking in the front of you, in the back of you. We were scared, so we\ncouldn\u2019t sleep even. But I was fighting until we came close to the American army. I actually\ndidn\u2019t see because I was in the artillery. I wasn\u2019t on the first line. I\u2019m glad I was privileged to\nhave the opportunity to fight against Nazi Germany. As a Jew, I didn\u2019t regret one minute for the\nblood I was spilling. Because I took revenge for my family and for the six million Jewish\npeople.\nDo you remember the day when the war ended, where you were? What you were doing when\nyou heard the war was over?\nI\u2019m telling you, in Germany.\nSo you were right outside Berlin?\nWest of Berlin. Yes.\nCan you tell me a little bit what you did after the war?\nAfter the war, we were going back to Russia. In Lodz was parade; a general was standing, there\nwas a big parade. While we were marching I look sideways, I see the people are jumping on the\nsidewalk, waving hands, (951) on I turn my head, and I look, my ex-friend passes,\nthey recognized me, they recognized me waving their hands. What can I do, it is a parade. But\nthere was a lieutenant in charge of us, marching first, he was young. I said to him comrade\nlieutenant, I want information to get out. He said what happened? I said to him I see my friend\nover there and they are jumping, he said go, catch up with them and I never saw me again. They\ntold me what goes on in Russia about anti-Semitism. And my wife and my father were still over\nthere. They told me send a telegram and come over. They never got my telegram. I had a lot of\nthe (963) looking for me. I had to wait for them until November. (Wife:\nExcuse me, we came looking for him, in town, ask for him, actually we don\u2019t know. I ask how is\nhe doing, how is he feeling, he said he\u2019s good, he\u2019s fine.) But he knew I deserted. So finally we\ncame, I sent a letter and that letter reached them on my military address. They made papers. As\nPolish immigrants, they couldn\u2019t leave Russia. So they came to Lodz and they found me and I\ngot in connection with a guy, a friend of mine, took us by truck to Berlin, we came to\n(976) to Germany by train and from there to Berlin. I registered with the UNRRA",
        "and they took us in big American trucks, they brought us to Hamburg in Germany and over there\nan American lieutenant came out and said now you are a free people and go wherever you want.\nSo I knew a couple of townspeople are in near Frankfurt am Main, so I went to them and",
        "settled and then we got in touch with my relatives in America and Canada and they sent to us a\nvisa and in 1947 we came here. June 1947.\nHave you been in New York all that time?\nYes.\nWhen did you get married?\nHere, in 1947.\nShe was with me all the time with the partisans.\nYou were with the partisans also? So you were in the woods also?\nAll the time.\nPeople here can\u2019t believe it. They say they can make a movie out of it. For awhile we went to\nthe same school, free tuition, a government school. A cousin of mine with the same name\nsneaked in in the camp in Grudack. I still can\u2019t understand how could he sneak in with a cut-off\nrifle and he sneaked in under the wires, at night we were sleeping, he sneaked in. How could he\ncome over there. He was 17 years old, a young kid. He had a father over there too. He told us\nwhat was going on and he run away and he came to the woods.\nWell, I think I\u2019ve asked all my questions. Is there anything else you want to say before I cut off\nthe tape?\nLike I said, I\u2019m proud of myself, I have so many wounds, a wound in my leg, a bullet in my\nheart. I had something wrong with my nose, I went to the doctor he took x-rays he said, \u201cMr.\nLaro, you know you have a piece of metal in your head?\u201d I think for a while and I said, oh, that\nmust be when I fought in Bialystok. I still have it, I feel it. He said, \u201cIf it don\u2019t bother you, leave\nit alone.\u201d\nThat\u2019s great.",
