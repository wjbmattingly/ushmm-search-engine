But we\nweren't told in those days really what was happening.\nNow, we had heard rumors of what was happening; that they were killing Jews and so\nforth. Even before I went into the Army, we had gotten rumors of that, things like that\nhappening, but nobody was really sure, you know. There was no everything was kept\nquiet. So when we got into Germany, of course, it was a matter of just getting through\nand fighting and going through these battles. There was no time to think of things like\nthat until we until we got to the camp of Buchenwald.",
        "Q: What was first impression? What's the first thing you saw",
        "A: In Buchenwald?",
        "Q: when you got there?",
        "A: Well, I guess we were one of the first units into Buchenwald. And I remember\nstanding just inside the entrance, and having the feeling of not only horror, but utter\ndesolation. What I saw was on my left, was a mass of dead bodies piled about eight feet\nhigh, and stretching out maybe 30 or 40 yards. The bodies had been soaked kerosene,\nready to be burnt, but I guess we arrived too soon for them to do it. On my right, there\nwere several people that were lying there, and some of them were crawling. Some\nweighed 80 pounds. Some looked half dead to me. One of them was crawling towards\nme, and I said something in Yiddish. I can't remember for sure, but \"Vus Kenneth Tuin\nZick Sehelthen, (ph)\" and one of them came up and tried to kiss my feet. The feeling of\nhelplessness and not believing was very prevalent. The gentile soldiers who were with\nme were almost in tears and shaking their heads. And I remember one of the survivors\ncoming up and telling me that the Polish SS had run out the back of the camp, and they\nwere getting away. And then later, one of the our soldiers, who had gone back there,\nsaid that two of them had been caught by some of the inmates and killed. The scene that I\ndescribed to you has never left my memory. And when I hear some of these groups that\nare now prevalent in the United States, around the world, that say that this never\nhappened, this really prevailed on me to tell what I saw, because I will never forget it.\nWe left this area soon after. I guess we had another assignment. And it was a long time\nago, 50 years or so. I don't remember what that assignment was between you and me.\nBut that scene that I saw at the entrance will never be forgotten, and I felt that I had to\ndescribe it.",
        "Q: Do you know what day you arrived there?",
        "A: I wouldn't know the date, but I know that Patton was 20 or 30 miles ahead of us. He\nhad come through, and then gone on. He was always ahead of the other units.\nAnd so that was really probably the exact date that Buchenwald was liberated. Because\nthe fact that the SS troops that were still there, and they had tried to, you know, get rid of\nthat evidence, so it was not more than one or two days difference.",
        "Q: And you said you had no preparation for what you would be seeing here?",
        "A: No preparation.",
        "Q: You were a young man.",
        "A: No preparation.",
        "Q: You were in your early 20s",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: with no preparation?",
        "A: No preparation of this at all.\nAnd not it was a situation that we really didn't believe. Not only me, but everybody that\nwalked in with me, you know, at that time.",
        "Q: Were you with other Jewish soldiers?",
        "A: No. There were Jewish soldiers in our outfit, but I think I was the only one at that\npoint that had walked into this.",
        "Q: How big a group were you?",
        "A: Oh, there must have been 10 or 12 of us.",
        "Q: And you walked into the camp?",
        "A: We went into that camp.",
        "Q: Are there any other experiences that you had besides talking in Yiddish to the one\nsurvivor?",
        "A: No, because after we did survey this area, we were told we have to get out; that other\npeople were coming in to do something to",
        "Q: Would",
        "A: work with the survivors, and",
        "Q: How long were you actually inside Buchenwald?",
        "A: Maybe not more than a half hour.",
        "Q: So what was the purpose of you going? What did they tell you the purpose was for\nyou?",
        "A: They just wanted to...",
        "Q: Witness it?",
        "A: Witness, as witnesses, right, to see what was going on. And then we our whole outfit\nmoved out after that, and then that was it.",
        "Q: And you had described one young man's reaction. Any other reactions that you\nremember from the other soldiers?",
        "A: Just disbelief. I think nobody ever would have thought of seeing things like that.\nNow, I remember our outfit had gone through five battles, so we had seen many things.\nBut this was the horror of it and the immensity of it, you know, was hard to understand.",
        "Q: How much of the camp did you see? Did you walk around?",
        "A: Not maybe we went in 40 or 50 yards, and then returned, went back.",
        "Q: And do you feel that because you were Jewish, that your reaction was different than\nyour fellow soldiers?",
        "A: I don't think so. I think that they were also in shock; that they didn't believe this could\nhappen. Man's inhumanity to man.",
        "Q: Did you see any of the living quarters, the barracks?",
        "A: We saw barracks. We didn't go into them, but they were",
        "Q: Can you describe what you saw; what you remember?",
        "A: They were like wooden barracks, but they were run down if I remember correctly, and\nit was small areas where they were living. I did see that.",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: Tiny, tiny areas where they had lived, little probably not even beds, you know, but\nprobably on the floor.",
        "Q: So you just walked around on your own?",
        "A: Yeah. We walked in on our own, and then we were told let's go, we're moving out,\nand that was it.",
        "Q: Did you talk about what you saw with the other men that you were with, the ten other\nmen?",
        "A: No. We went into another assignment, and we had we were spread out, so I didn't get\nto talk to too many people. Later, we talked about it, you know, and really, what I'm\ntelling you, we talked among ourselves, you know.",
        "Q: Did you discuss any of this with any of the officers in the camp, in the Army\u2019?",
        "A: One of the officers, if I remember, was with us when we went in, but we didn't discuss\nthat afterwards, because things were still popping, as you know, because that wasn't the\nend of the war.",
        "Q: And you said you spoke Yiddish to one of the",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: survivors?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And did you speak to any of the other survivors, or just that one?",
        "A: No. It seemed to me if I remember correctly, that was the one. The others\nwere couldn't speak. They were mostly I was thinking afterwards, I wonder if they\nreally survived, because they looked in such bad shape that probably many of them\ndidn't.",
        "Q: So you then left, and can you just briefly tell us what happened after?",
        "A: Well, we would we had to go on. And after that, it's hard to remember what\nhappened. I remember carrying one message to a Russian general in Lavesig that, and\nforgetting to shake his hand, and he was left hanging there as I left the room.\nAnd finally, after a few months, the war was did finish.",
        "Q: And then you",
        "A: But I did write about this.",
        "Q: Well, let's",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So then you how much longer were you in the service?",
        "A: Probably not more than a few more months.",
        "Q: And",
        "A: Before I left.",
        "Q: And then you came back?",
        "A: Came back to",
        "Q: Michigan?",
        "A: To Michigan.",
        "Q: And what did you do then?",
        "A: Okay. Then I went to I decided that I would go and really take music more seriously,\nand I went to college, and became a music teacher and a music performer. Met my wife,\nBetty, who is also a musician, and that's what we've been doing since.",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: To this day.",
        "Q: Well, let's talk a little bit about how this experience that you went through in\nBuchenwald as a young man, a young soldier affected you. Does it still affect you?",
        "A: Hmm. I would imagine it does, 'cause the immensity of what I saw, and the fact that I\nwas there, of course. And I had been telling not only my family, but other people,\nwhoever I saw, or whoever was interested of these things that I had that 1t was hard to\ntalk about. But when I first came back, people wanted to know. I remember writing to\nmy family even from Europe of what I saw.",
        "Q: Describing",
        "A: Describing what I saw. And I did that.",
        "Q: Do you still have those letters?",
        "A: No, no. What happened was my mother used to read those letters, and finally and cry\nwhenever she read them. So finally, I decided that get rid of them. And now I realize\nthat was a mistake. I shouldn't have. But I did. I got rid of them.",
        "Q: Did you take any photographs of what you saw when you",
        "A: Yes. We had some photographs.",
        "Q: That you yourself",
        "A: But those photographs were included in some of the letters, and so I got rid of those,\ntoo.",
        "Q: Uhhuh. But you yourself had a camera?",
        "A: No. We had I had a camera, but I didn't take all those. There were other soldiers that\ndid take photographs, and they gave me some of the prints that they got. That's where I\ngot them.",
        "Q: You had said you had written or was that the letter you're talking about, the letters\nthat you wrote home?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: You didn't write anything formal?",
        "A: Well, no, I didn't write anything formal.",
        "Q: Formally?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: How did that experience that you went through affect your feelings about being\nJewish?",
        "A: Well",
        "Q: Did it change the way you feel?",
        "A: No, I don't think it changed. Our family has you know, is a family that had many\nJewish clergy in it. My mother's family, on her side, there were Rabbis that went back as\nfar as four generations. I think we came from Spain, and then to Poland, and so I\nremember stories about, you know, great, great, great grandfather being Rabbis and so\non.\nSo I've always felt Jewish. I don't think it had any affect on it. But it sure opened my\neyes about what had been going on, and why, and why this happened was a big question;\nwhy it was allowed to happen. Because I think now as we read books and go back into\nhistory that many people knew what was going on, and nothing not enough was done to\nsave these people.",
        "Q: Did the Army have any mechanism for the soldiers to talk out their experiences of\nwhat they saw",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: at places like Buchenwald?",
        "A: No, not not that I know of. Perhaps, you know, other units that moved in to try to\nwork with these people may have had that, but we were not given that, you know,\nresponsibility; or nobody ever talked to us about it after that.",
        "Q: Were most of the other men that you came to the camp with young like you?",
        "A: Yes, just about my age, maybe a little bit older.",
        "Q: And you said that you did talk about it with them a little bit after?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember any of the exchanges that you've had; any of their comments?",
        "A: Same thing that I that I talked told you. First of all, there was disbelief. And nobody\never said that they would have imagined the immensity of this terrible horror that we saw.\nAnd to think that these people and in every contact that we had with German people,\nthey always said that it wasn't us that did these horrible things. We were not Nazis. But\nit turns",
        "Q: When you say contact, when was this contact?",
        "A: Well, if we talked to a German person.",
        "Q: Over you're talking about when you were",
        "A: Yeah, as we went from, you know",
        "Q: Towns?",
        "A: Citytocity, towntotown, and we naturally would say did you know about what was\nhappening. Your town was right next to this; the ovens there. They all said, oh, no, we\ndidn't know. We were not Nazis. But it turned out [many|am] times, they were. We\nfound evidence of Nazi materials in their attics and so on. Everybody denied it.",
        "Q: What kind of what did you do after you left Buchenwald? You said you went to\ndifferent towns and cities. What was your role?",
        "A: Okay. Since I was a Jewish soldier, I knew a little Yiddish, I sort of became the\nbilleting person. In other words, I would go around talking to people to allow soldiers to\nstay in different places. And that's what I mean when I had contact with the regular\npersons in these towns.",
        "Q: And what was their reception to you knowing",
        "A: Oh, fine.",
        "Q: that you were Jewish?",
        "A: No, it didn't matter. They were just glad to see Americans, you know. Oh, we're glad\nto see you.",
        "Q: And they knew you were Jewish?",
        "A: Sure, because I talked Jewish. I'm sure German people",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: The German people could tell the difference between German and",
        "Q: You were speaking Yiddish and",
        "A: I was speaking Yiddish, and they were answering in German, right. And usually I\nwould go to the Burgermeister, because he was the one that went, tell us, tell us where we\ncould find a billeting, you know.",
        "Q: Well, is there anything else that you wanted to add; that you wanted to say",
        "A: Well",
        "Q: about your experiences?",
        "A: it was heartrending, as you can hear, and I just I hope that I what I've said, you\nknow, can verify what, you know, what has what happened over there. And as an\neyewitness, I thought that I should have some evidence, you know, to that effect, and tell\nthat this did happen, and it wasn't a hoax. And it was horrible.",
        "Q: Well, thank you very much for telling us your story.",
        "A: Okay. I'm happy I'm able to do that. It wasn't easy, but I felt we felt 1t was important.",
        "Q: As you said, this is something that has stayed with you.",
        "A: Right. Especially the scene in the entrance of the camp.",
        "Q: Were there any special signs that you saw?",
        "A: There was a sign above the camp, but you know, I can't remember what it said now.\nSome of the movies I've seen, there had been different slogans, Arbeit? You know about\nthat. Means what was it.",
        "Q: Arbeitsdorf?",
        "A: Yeah, right. But I don't really remember if it said that in Buchenwald. It might have.\nIt might have.",
        "Q: And that was the only camp that you went to?",
        "A: That was the only camp we went to. We were near I had heard that we were passing\nby different ones, or there were, you know, as we went through, because we had just\nfollowed the line of the tanks, but we didn't we didn't go to another camp. That was it.\nSo I don't know what happened in Dachau, for example, or others. Just what I saw in\nBuchenwald. One thing I do remember is that upon entrance into Buchenwald, not only\nwas it the visual horror, but we had that terrible odor of dead bodies and kerosene, and it\nwas it was an odor that made us all nauseous. A terrible feeling of nauseousness and\nutter desolation. And this happened, again, at the entrance of this camp.",
        "Q: And the other soldiers felt the way you do?",
        "A: Yes. The other soldiers felt the way I did. And as a matter of fact, now that I think\nback, I remember one of the other soldiers not being able to stay there. He had to leave\nimmediately. But I did not do that, because I wanted to see as much as I could.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Because I'm Jewish, and I didn't want to, you know, forget what I was seeing. I\nthought maybe some day in the future, I'll be able to describe this, or I would have to\ndescribe it, which I am now doing. Another experience that I had later in our area, area of\nSouthfield, Michigan at the time, 1s we met a survivor of that camp. He happened to be a\njeweler who came to our house to show a small, little charm bracelet that we were\ntrying thinking of getting for our twoyear old daughter at the time. Now, this was over\n30 years ago.\nBut when he had heard that I went into the camp and was a liberator, he said you know, I\nwas a survivor of Buchenwald, too. And the only way I survived was I finally cut off\nsome toes in order to get to a hospital. And he was very emotional. We hugged, and he\ncried. And he said you, you saved us. And this happened, the meeting happened 30, over\n30 years ago. And we see each other once in a while, and memories come back, of\ncourse.",
        "Q: And this was",
        "A: On both sides.",
        "Q: And this was an emotional experience for you?",
        "A: Well, as you can tell, it was very emotional, because he started to talk a little bit about\nhis experiences in the camp, although not much. So I met in other words, I did meet\na one of those people who was there when I walked into that camp.",
        "Q: Thank you for telling us that very moving story. This concludes the interview of\nJerome Stasson. It was conducted on March 21, 1994 at the United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum.\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "A: Right.",
        "A: Of Germany?",
        "A: Hah.",
        "A: You know, everything we didn't know too much about what was happening. And that\nwas one of the things that was so shocking when we arrived in Buchenwald. But we\nweren't told in those days really what was happening.\nNow, we had heard rumors of what was happening; that they were killing Jews and so\nforth. Even before I went into the Army, we had gotten rumors of that, things like that\nhappening, but nobody was really sure, you know. There was no everything was kept\nquiet. So when we got into Germany, of course, it was a matter of just getting through\nand fighting and going through these battles. There was no time to think of things like\nthat until we until we got to the camp of Buchenwald.",
        "A: In Buchenwald?",
        "A: Well, I guess we were one of the first units into Buchenwald. And I remember\nstanding just inside the entrance, and having the feeling of not only horror, but utter\ndesolation. What I saw was on my left, was a mass of dead bodies piled about eight feet\nhigh, and stretching out maybe 30 or 40 yards. The bodies had been soaked kerosene,\nready to be burnt, but I guess we arrived too soon for them to do it. On my right, there\nwere several people that were lying there, and some of them were crawling. Some\nweighed 80 pounds. Some looked half dead to me. One of them was crawling towards\nme, and I said something in Yiddish. I can't remember for sure, but \"Vus Kenneth Tuin\nZick Sehelthen, (ph)\" and one of them came up and tried to kiss my feet. The feeling of\nhelplessness and not believing was very prevalent. The gentile soldiers who were with\nme were almost in tears and shaking their heads. And I remember one of the survivors\ncoming up and telling me that the Polish SS had run out the back of the camp, and they\nwere getting away. And then later, one of the our soldiers, who had gone back there,\nsaid that two of them had been caught by some of the inmates and killed. The scene that I\ndescribed to you has never left my memory. And when I hear some of these groups that\nare now prevalent in the United States, around the world, that say that this never\nhappened, this really prevailed on me to tell what I saw, because I will never forget it.\nWe left this area soon after. I guess we had another assignment. And it was a long time\nago, 50 years or so. I don't remember what that assignment was between you and me.\nBut that scene that I saw at the entrance will never be forgotten, and I felt that I had to\ndescribe it.",
        "A: I wouldn't know the date, but I know that Patton was 20 or 30 miles ahead of us. He\nhad come through, and then gone on. He was always ahead of the other units.\nAnd so that was really probably the exact date that Buchenwald was liberated. Because\nthe fact that the SS troops that were still there, and they had tried to, you know, get rid of\nthat evidence, so it was not more than one or two days difference.",
        "A: No preparation.",
        "A: No preparation.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No preparation of this at all.\nAnd not it was a situation that we really didn't believe. Not only me, but everybody that\nwalked in with me, you know, at that time.",
        "A: No. There were Jewish soldiers in our outfit, but I think I was the only one at that\npoint that had walked into this.",
        "A: Oh, there must have been 10 or 12 of us.",
        "A: We went into that camp.",
        "A: No, because after we did survey this area, we were told we have to get out; that other\npeople were coming in to do something to",
        "A: work with the survivors, and",
        "A: Maybe not more than a half hour.",
        "A: They just wanted to...",
        "A: Witness, as witnesses, right, to see what was going on. And then we our whole outfit\nmoved out after that, and then that was it.",
        "A: Just disbelief. I think nobody ever would have thought of seeing things like that.\nNow, I remember our outfit had gone through five battles, so we had seen many things.\nBut this was the horror of it and the immensity of it, you know, was hard to understand.",
        "A: Not maybe we went in 40 or 50 yards, and then returned, went back.",
        "A: I don't think so. I think that they were also in shock; that they didn't believe this could\nhappen. Man's inhumanity to man.",
        "A: We saw barracks. We didn't go into them, but they were",
        "A: They were like wooden barracks, but they were run down if I remember correctly, and\nit was small areas where they were living. I did see that.",
        "A: Tiny, tiny areas where they had lived, little probably not even beds, you know, but\nprobably on the floor.",
        "A: Yeah. We walked in on our own, and then we were told let's go, we're moving out,\nand that was it.",
        "A: No. We went into another assignment, and we had we were spread out, so I didn't get\nto talk to too many people. Later, we talked about it, you know, and really, what I'm\ntelling you, we talked among ourselves, you know.",
        "A: One of the officers, if I remember, was with us when we went in, but we didn't discuss\nthat afterwards, because things were still popping, as you know, because that wasn't the\nend of the war.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No. It seemed to me if I remember correctly, that was the one. The others\nwere couldn't speak. They were mostly I was thinking afterwards, I wonder if they\nreally survived, because they looked in such bad shape that probably many of them\ndidn't.",
        "A: Well, we would we had to go on. And after that, it's hard to remember what\nhappened. I remember carrying one message to a Russian general in Lavesig that, and\nforgetting to shake his hand, and he was left hanging there as I left the room.\nAnd finally, after a few months, the war was did finish.",
        "A: But I did write about this.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Probably not more than a few more months.",
        "A: Before I left.",
        "A: Came back to",
        "A: To Michigan.",
        "A: Okay. Then I went to I decided that I would go and really take music more seriously,\nand I went to college, and became a music teacher and a music performer. Met my wife,\nBetty, who is also a musician, and that's what we've been doing since.",
        "A: To this day.",
        "A: Hmm. I would imagine it does, 'cause the immensity of what I saw, and the fact that I\nwas there, of course. And I had been telling not only my family, but other people,\nwhoever I saw, or whoever was interested of these things that I had that 1t was hard to\ntalk about. But when I first came back, people wanted to know. I remember writing to\nmy family even from Europe of what I saw.",
        "A: Describing what I saw. And I did that.",
        "A: No, no. What happened was my mother used to read those letters, and finally and cry\nwhenever she read them. So finally, I decided that get rid of them. And now I realize\nthat was a mistake. I shouldn't have. But I did. I got rid of them.",
        "A: Yes. We had some photographs.",
        "A: But those photographs were included in some of the letters, and so I got rid of those,\ntoo.",
        "A: No. We had I had a camera, but I didn't take all those. There were other soldiers that\ndid take photographs, and they gave me some of the prints that they got. That's where I\ngot them.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, no, I didn't write anything formal.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well",
        "A: No, I don't think it changed. Our family has you know, is a family that had many\nJewish clergy in it. My mother's family, on her side, there were Rabbis that went back as\nfar as four generations. I think we came from Spain, and then to Poland, and so I\nremember stories about, you know, great, great, great grandfather being Rabbis and so\non.\nSo I've always felt Jewish. I don't think it had any affect on it. But it sure opened my\neyes about what had been going on, and why, and why this happened was a big question;\nwhy it was allowed to happen. Because I think now as we read books and go back into\nhistory that many people knew what was going on, and nothing not enough was done to\nsave these people.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, not not that I know of. Perhaps, you know, other units that moved in to try to\nwork with these people may have had that, but we were not given that, you know,\nresponsibility; or nobody ever talked to us about it after that.",
        "A: Yes, just about my age, maybe a little bit older.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Same thing that I that I talked told you. First of all, there was disbelief. And nobody\never said that they would have imagined the immensity of this terrible horror that we saw.\nAnd to think that these people and in every contact that we had with German people,\nthey always said that it wasn't us that did these horrible things. We were not Nazis. But\nit turns",
        "A: Well, if we talked to a German person.",
        "A: Yeah, as we went from, you know",
        "A: Citytocity, towntotown, and we naturally would say did you know about what was\nhappening. Your town was right next to this; the ovens there. They all said, oh, no, we\ndidn't know. We were not Nazis. But it turned out [many|am] times, they were. We\nfound evidence of Nazi materials in their attics and so on. Everybody denied it.",
        "A: Okay. Since I was a Jewish soldier, I knew a little Yiddish, I sort of became the\nbilleting person. In other words, I would go around talking to people to allow soldiers to\nstay in different places. And that's what I mean when I had contact with the regular\npersons in these towns.",
        "A: Oh, fine.",
        "A: No, it didn't matter. They were just glad to see Americans, you know. Oh, we're glad\nto see you.",
        "A: Sure, because I talked Jewish. I'm sure German people",
        "A: The German people could tell the difference between German and",
        "A: I was speaking Yiddish, and they were answering in German, right. And usually I\nwould go to the Burgermeister, because he was the one that went, tell us, tell us where we\ncould find a billeting, you know.",
        "A: Well",
        "A: it was heartrending, as you can hear, and I just I hope that I what I've said, you\nknow, can verify what, you know, what has what happened over there. And as an\neyewitness, I thought that I should have some evidence, you know, to that effect, and tell\nthat this did happen, and it wasn't a hoax. And it was horrible.",
        "A: Okay. I'm happy I'm able to do that. It wasn't easy, but I felt we felt 1t was important.",
        "A: Right. Especially the scene in the entrance of the camp.",
        "A: There was a sign above the camp, but you know, I can't remember what it said now.\nSome of the movies I've seen, there had been different slogans, Arbeit? You know about\nthat. Means what was it.",
        "A: Yeah, right. But I don't really remember if it said that in Buchenwald. It might have.\nIt might have.",
        "A: That was the only camp we went to. We were near I had heard that we were passing\nby different ones, or there were, you know, as we went through, because we had just\nfollowed the line of the tanks, but we didn't we didn't go to another camp. That was it.\nSo I don't know what happened in Dachau, for example, or others. Just what I saw in\nBuchenwald. One thing I do remember is that upon entrance into Buchenwald, not only\nwas it the visual horror, but we had that terrible odor of dead bodies and kerosene, and it\nwas it was an odor that made us all nauseous. A terrible feeling of nauseousness and\nutter desolation. And this happened, again, at the entrance of this camp.",
        "A: Yes. The other soldiers felt the way I did. And as a matter of fact, now that I think\nback, I remember one of the other soldiers not being able to stay there. He had to leave\nimmediately. But I did not do that, because I wanted to see as much as I could.",
        "A: Because I'm Jewish, and I didn't want to, you know, forget what I was seeing. I\nthought maybe some day in the future, I'll be able to describe this, or I would have to\ndescribe it, which I am now doing. Another experience that I had later in our area, area of\nSouthfield, Michigan at the time, 1s we met a survivor of that camp. He happened to be a\njeweler who came to our house to show a small, little charm bracelet that we were\ntrying thinking of getting for our twoyear old daughter at the time. Now, this was over\n30 years ago.\nBut when he had heard that I went into the camp and was a liberator, he said you know, I\nwas a survivor of Buchenwald, too. And the only way I survived was I finally cut off\nsome toes in order to get to a hospital. And he was very emotional. We hugged, and he\ncried. And he said you, you saved us. And this happened, the meeting happened 30, over\n30 years ago. And we see each other once in a while, and memories come back, of\ncourse.",
        "A: On both sides.",
        "A: Well, as you can tell, it was very emotional, because he started to talk a little bit about\nhis experiences in the camp, although not much. So I met in other words, I did meet\na one of those people who was there when I walked into that camp.\n"
