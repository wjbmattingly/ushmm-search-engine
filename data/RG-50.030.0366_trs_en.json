My father in the beginning he still ran the factory -- it was going.\nAnd then we had to close so this Hugo got all the stuff.\nHe got it. And he came to our house, to our apartment. We had an apartment and closed it\nup and chased us out. They wanted us to wait until they will get a lot of people together\nand they wanted to take us somewhere.

I don't remember. I told you I don't remember a lot of things, but I know\nsomebody saved my life. Oh, I know, I know. There was I told you outside, outside of the\nghetto there was this big, factory, straw factory and other factories. And when the\nGermans announced they are going to grab people, they wanted a transport, Bert sent me\nwith a friend of ours, the one he lives, he's in Canada now, the same fellow, to hide me in\none of the factories there because people weren't coming to work. They weren't working.\nIt was -- the Germans wanted everybody to stay home so they have it easier, to grab us.\nThis fellow took me to this place called Maryzin, part of the city, and hid me until 1t was\nover. I was, I was in the factory. I was, I was, I think I was the only person there. There\nwas no one there but me and this young man was with me that brought me over there and\nwhen it was over they let us know. And this, oh, I was sure I was going to be finished this\ntime.",
        "Q: What did you think was going to happen?",
        "A: I thought the Germans will get me, and we didn't know what they were doing with us. We\nknew it was nothing good. I knew it's not going to be a party for sure. Now I can laugh.",

        "A: My father had a good position. He was in charge of a Kooperative. Rumkowski gave him\na privileged job because, you know, he never forgot that my father supported him and so\non, and my mother was an instructor in a underwear factory. She knew the business. This\nwas her business so she was an instructor. And so, but it was hopeless for my father. He\njust, he couldn't adjust to the conditions. He was killed after the war, the third of May '45,\nhe was on the walk, and they took a transport and wanted to bring them to the sea and\ndrown them there. He couldn't walk so he was shot. My brother was there too, and my\nfather said to him, \"Run for your life, just leave me alone here and save yourself.\u201d Pushed\nhim away and my brother ran for his life. And since I know this story of run for your life,\nI ran for my life every night because I have always these nightmares and I scream, \"Run,\nrun for your life.\u201d That tells me I don't, I don't remember he told me, \"Run for your life.\"",

        "A: My mother, yes, she was a strong woman, a strong personality, yeah. She adjusted. She\nsurvived with me. She was with me in the concentration camp. And because of her I was\nalive because I think I was giving in.\nI didn't feel like living anymore when we were in the concentration camp and the allies\nwere bombing. I prayed to God that the bombs should come and get us because we were\nso sick of living.",
        "Q: Did you notice that a number of men that were in a similar position to your father also\nhad a, I don't want to say, an inability to adjust or it was difficult for them to adjust to, to\nsuch a situation?",
        "A: I don't know how somebody else felt. I know how my father felt. He was world -- very\nworldly, very sophisticated man and had such plans for his children for the future, for a\ngood future, and this is what happened. He was very depressed and disappointed.

Bert's office was\nthere on the, on the other side and I, I saw him quite often and the corners of my eyes I\nsaw. I would never turn around. A lady didn't turn around, but I, I saw him watching me\nand looking after me. I could see it. And one day I came from work going home, he was\nwalking with his secretary and his secretary knew me because he used to work for my\nfather before the war and I knew they were talking about me. I knew it. And then this\nfellow came to, to, to my parents house and said Irene, he wanted a date with me. I was, I\ndidn't, I was very blue and I had enough. I didn't want anymore to go out. My mother\nsaid, \"Don't sit home. You don't sit shee'va.\u2019 Go out and meet people. Don't just go to\nwork and come home.\" And I did and I had this date with him and I came hour earlier\nbecause I didn't want to go to this date. And my mother pushed me, she said, \"Go\" I said,\n\"Mom it's so late.\u201d \"See if he's there it's fine. If not you come home.\u201d We knew it was\ncurfew after a certain hour, I don't remember what time it was you couldn't walk\nanymore. So, it means I would be stuck on this date and won't be able to go home. But I\nwent, an hour late, and he was just turning around to -- he didn't wait anymore and he\nwas walking and he saw me. So, we went to his boss. He said his boss 1s sick, has a cold\nand we went there and my girlfriend supposed to be the date of his boss. We come, we\ncome there, he -- and Bert opens the door and greeted me and I don't know when he\ngreeted me, I said \"This is it!\" And I had to stay there. My girlfriend wasn't there, but it\nturned out that my girlfriend was this fellow's date and Bert was playing violin. He has a\nlovely voice and -- yes, he has a lovely voice -- he was singing and we were talking. And\nI was -- he knew my life story already from my girlfriend, everything.

He took her in. She was with us all day\nlong. At night she went to her family and he didn't want her to work. She had to take it\neasy so he made her life easy. She survived. She lives in, in Sweden.",
        "Q: Now, during this ten months, shall I assume that you're living with your parents?",
        "A: Yeah, I was. Oh, sure. Oh yes, sure I lived with my parents. There wasn't such a thing as\n-- you know. There was respect.",
        "Q: Did you know Bert was going to go to your parents and ask them -- ?",
        "A: No, no, no. I didn't know, because you see he had an older sister, she wasn't married yet.\nSo, when we were talking about, you know, getting -- the second day we met, he told me\nyou are, you are going to be my wife. I said, \"Oh, no. I had a bad experience and I'm too\nyoung now to go through it again. I don't, I don't know what's going to happen.\u201d And he\nsaid to me, \u201cEven though I have an older sister but you are going to be my wife.\u201d This\nwas the second date we had.\nAnd so, we courted for a while and 10 months later we got married.

        "Q: When did you meet her in the ghetto? After you met Bert?",
        "A: Yes, sure, I didn't know her. She didn't want me to marry Bert. She was very much\nagainst it. \"Oh, my, my brother is going to be married to some divorced woman.\" She\nwas, she was giving him trouble. So, Rumkowski didn't know about whom they're\ntalking, so he said -- and Bert went to Rumkowski to ask permission to marry me. He\nsaid I want to see your future wife. I want to see her because your sister is so much\nagainst it. And when I came to him, he invited me to his house. I came here and I thought\nhe would go ballistic. He saw me, he says, \"You are the one?\" I said yes and I told him\nthe story why I separated from the other one. And he said, \"All right you will get married.\nI will give you away, and I will give Dora some sermon.\u201d And he told her, he told her.",
        "Q: Was that typical that people would go to Rumkowski and ask for permission?",
        "A: No, no, no, no. It wasn't typical. We had a Standesamt,'\u201d you know. We had a civil office\nwhere you got your, like you get your license here, it was the same thing. But she was\nagainst me marrying her brother. He was the apple of her eye, you know, and she -- he --\nthought no one was good enough for, for him, but Rumkowski told her different.",
        "Q: Did she adjust?",
        "A: Oh, yes, she did. Listen, she survived because of me. We were in Ravensbrick and it\nwasn't fun and I really took care of her there. I took care of her and she came out of it, but\nshe didn't live long enough.",
        "Q: When you got married, where, where were you married and when?",
        "A: In June, June 27, '43, and it was a place where Rumkowski was giving marriages because\nJews weren't allowed to get married and you didn't have wedding bands. They give you a\nhandkerchief, you know.\nBut there was this place that he was giving people away and we married with 18 or 19\npeople. I have part of the picture, a few couples with me.

        "A: No. I was very low. I mean lying low. I didn't make any waves. I was very -- I socialized\nvery little because after I got -- we knew, knew what was going on, how the people felt\nSO, SO, SO We didn't socialize too much. Bert had a group of people, a few couples. He was\nthe only bachelor, and we met with these people. We played a lot of cards at times, and\nwe read a lot, but I didn't know many people. Every-everybody knew me because, you\n'\u00b0 Civil marriage ceremony (German)\nknow, they knew my family. We, we didn't, we didn't do anything special because like\nlife was so hard and when you, when you came from work you wanted to relax and take\nit easy. You never know what's going to happen next again. And we, we had always\nsurprises.",
        "Q: Like what?",
        "A: Like, like they would surround at any time at will every place, every house and direct\npeople out. We never knew who was next on the line. No, we didn't know that. And life\nwas very iffy.",
        "Q: Did you have dealings with Germans?",
        "A: No, I didn't. The one German that supposed to pay us for, and I was waiting every single\nday for weeks at, at you know, we had a gate on the Baugehirn.'' This is where the whole\nbrain of the ghetto was sitting, you know, the president Rumkowski was there and his\nsecretary and the Germans had their people sitting there.\nThis is where every dealing went through. I was waiting at the gate because he promised\nhe will pay us so much merchandise he took and we could live nicely because we were\nhungry. I saw him few times pass by in a Droschke.'* Do you know what a Droschke is?\nA horse and a carriage, but he never gave us a penny and when I met him after the war in\nMunich, like nothing ever happened. \u201cOh, Irene, he showed me this big apartment house\nhe owned and on top of the roof he had a swimming pool.\u201d And he said to me, \"Irene this\nall could you be yours. You didn't want it.\u201d I said, \"No, I wouldn't and I still don't want\nit.\u201d But he never, never gave a penny back. Bert wrote him a letter that she -- he -- should\nat least compensate my mother. He begged me not to tell his wife anything and I didn't.\nHe married a very lovely woman and this is it. The end of the story.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were there chores?",

        "Q: Could you wash your clothes?",
        "A: In the ghetto yes, but when we were in the concentration camp, we couldn't. But we did --\nyou know what I did? We had this metal pieces coming wrapped in brown paper and we\nhad to take off the paper and wash these pieces of metal with sudsy water.\nSo, after we did that, we took the, the pail in the toilet, you know, in the cabin, close up\nand get undressed and wash with this garbagy water. And then I had only one pair of\npants. This was it. No bra or nothing. So, I would take off the pants, wash it in this water\nand guess what I would do. I was working at the, at the press. I would hang the pants\nunder the table and the heat of the press would almost dry it. It was half dry. I would put\nit on again and this is the way I kept clean.",

        "Q: And what did you do?",
        "A: Oh, we were, we were designating footage, you know, in one room to people whoever\nneeded a place to live. They came and we had to investigate how many people lived there\nand so on and this is how they got their apartments where to live.",

        "Q: Did you sleep okay?",
        "A: I can't tell you that. I don't remember. I don't know. Nobody, nobody slept well, I guess,\nbecause it was always in the back of our minds that we don't know what's going to\nhappen next. You couldn't plan it. It wasn't a normal way of living.",
        "Q: Did you think about the future? Did you think about this ending and the war ending?",
        "A: As I told you when you are young you are very optimistic. We were optimistic at one\ntime in the ghetto. We were very -- we were in love, you know, and we were talking\nabout things but we didn't believe we going to make it. Nobody did believe that we were\ngoing to make it.",

She kept\nme going. I didn't want to, you know, we had -- when they bombarded the Allies, the\ncamp, we had to go in, into, go out and we go into the ditches, the anti-aircraft ditches. In\nthe beginning we did it with my mother, and later on we didn't do it anymore. We didn't\ngo out. We were staying where we are, were, and I said, \u201c\u201cWhatever happens, happens to\nme, Mom, if you want to go.\u201d\u201d My mother was with me.

        "A: It was hard because here you, came, you had transport came of very special people.\nBright, intelligent, educated, very well to do, they came here to this, to this miserable\nplace and they had to get adjusted. Was very hard for them to get adjusted. Then you\ndidn't have apartments, you would give them some space, but you couldn't pick people\nthat have something compatible and you know this was tragedy, tragedy. You didn't talk\nthe same language. They couldn't communicate with us. They spoke Czech. We spoke\nmostly Polish, mostly Yiddish, all the people spoke so it was very hard on, on these\npeople. I felt sorry for them, not for myself because we had a roof over our head, they\ndidn't.\nAnd when they got these rooms, it was one tragedy after another. They were dying out.",
        "Q: How did you decide where to put people?",
        "A: We tried, we tried to get people from the same cultures, from the same background. It\nwas, it was a humiliating time, a humiliating experience. Beautiful people, we had\nProfessor Caspari\u2019\u201d that was one of the first cancer researcher. He lost his life, too.",
        "Q: Did you have a, a card file of where people were living?",
        "A: Oh, yes. It was very, very orderly. Everything was just like clockwork, unbelievable how\neverything worked the way it's supposed to. Yeah, we had, we had -- everybody was\nregistered.",
        "Q: And they couldn't move unless --",
        "A: No, no where could they move? They needed space where to live, and space was\nprecious.\n'S Professor Wilhelm Caspari (1872-1944), renown cancer researcher and bacteriologist.",
        "Q: In that kind of a situation where people are living under such tension, yeah, with so little\nfood and under difficult apartment situations, was there a lot of fighting and arguments?",
        "A: Not really, not really, because we all were in the same situation and we all had to do our\nbest to get along. Life was miserable enough without having any kind of fights, you\nknow, and wars and stuff like that. Everybody had to try and they did, they did. My\nparents, we lived when I was at home we were four people before I got married and there\nwas a lady from Vienna, German speaking with two children in the same room divided\nby a sheet. So, people had to make their best. They had to try very hard and they got\nalong. I know my parents became very friendly with this lady and tried to help her as\nmuch as they could.",
        "Q: You had said that there were, there were a lot of affairs going on?",
        "A: Yes, life was going on. And life is one big affair, right.",
        "Q: Do you think it was more so in some ways because of the circumstances?",
        "A: Yes, because people did things that they would probably have never done ethically or\nmorally. I know when I was growing up nobody heard about somebody living together\nand not being married. It was just unheard of. Such a person would be ostracized, I know\nfor sure. People did that in the ghetto. They had no choices and besides the\ncircumstances, you know. Maybe he had a better apart -- room -- than I have, and maybe\nhe had a better job than I had so there was a lot of marriages that could never happen if\nnot these circumstances.\nBecause very young girls sold themselves to, to old men. What was it? It wasn't love.",
        "Q: So they could have a better circumstance?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Were the men in better working positions so that they got better apartments?",
        "A: No, no there was, there was absolutely no -- any specific, you know, nobody as I told\nyou, it was tough enough and we had to get along and gender didn't mean a thing.\nWomen were working. Whatever they could do. Naturally women cannot do physical\nwork the way a man can do so but everybody was working. Otherwise they couldn't\nsurvive. They wouldn't get their rations. They wouldn't get their food.",
        "Q: No, I meant you mentioned the fact that some young women would go with much older\nmen that under ordinary circumstances they wouldn't, so it must be that these men could\nprovide something. They had an apartment?",
        "A: Some, some of the girls needed a father image. They were left alone. Their parents were\ntaken away or died away and here somebody's lost and there is nothing worse than\nloneliness and they were lonely.",
        "Q: Was that the, one of the biggest frights for, for all of you, to be separated?",
        "A: Yes, I think so. I think so.",
        "Q: Could you talk about Rumkowski threatening, threatening you and why he would get\nangry with you?",
        "A: Yes, he knew me quite well, since my early childhood, and he knew me. I had a big\nmouth. And Bert, whenever we knew that there comes evacuation or they called it\nRazzia,'\u201d when they surrounded the houses and, and took out the people, when we knew\nabout it Bert was sick. He wasn't sick. I told him you are not going anywhere, you are\nstaying here. Let your partner go. I wouldn't let him go. It happened a few times that\nwhenever something was, Bert was sick. So, Rumkowski called me and in Yiddish he\nsaid to me I'm not going -- you want to tell in Yiddish -- he said to me I'm going to send\nyou with a broom to sweep the, the streets because I know it's your head and you stay out\nof it and if ever happens I send you with a broom. He knew, he knew it was my idea.",
        "Q: Now, now you didn't want Bert to go?",
        "A: I didn't want him to, to be responsible or have part on something that we don't know\nwhat's going to happen. This is what happened. It was a good intuition of mine.",
        "Q: So, he never participated in deportations?",
        "A: No, he didn't. No, no, no. Every, every factory when there was an evacuation, everybody\nhad to give a list and they gave lists of people that they couldn't use in was because, you\nknow, everybody was registered -- even the little children. So, every, every factory was\nreally responsible for the people that went. They had to give names. They had to give\npeople.\n'* Raid (German). The Fascist term for a roundup of people, often Jews.

        "A: Terrible, the worst.",

        "A: Not that I know, not that I know. I wouldn't know.",
        "Q: Do you remember the times when they took the children after Rumkowski gave that\nspeech?",
        "A: I didn't hear -- the first time I heard this speech was here when I saw the movie here. I\nnever heard it, but my family was involved too, because my uncle had two little girls and\nthey took the children. They took the girls. My aunt wouldn't go with the children. My\nuncle said he wouldn't let the children go alone. He doesn't -- we didn't know where they\nwere going, but he didn't want them to be alone without somebody of parent, of a parent\nand he went with them. He went to Auschwitz. Later on we found out. He never made it.",
        "Q: But the mother didn't go?",
        "A: No, she didn't survive. We never heard from her again after the war so we don't know.\nBut usually the mother was the tigress. Usually the mother was the one that was there for\nher children, especially a Jewish mother and here she didn't want to go so my, my uncle\nwent.",
        "Q: When, when they did the deportations and the evacuations in the factory and the houses,\nwas there a particularly horrible atmosphere in the ghetto at these, at these times?",
        "A: It was a panic, sheer panic. People were running like -- did you ever see a mound -- this\nis the way it looked, the ghetto looked, everybody was running. Everyone was running\naimless. Nobody knew where they are going. There was no place to run and hide but\npeople were scared.",
        "Q: Were you ever on a list before 1944?",
        "A: On what list?",
        "Q: A deportation list, or was there not a list?",
        "A: There were no lists. They, they grabbed people at random.\nThis is what I said about the Razzia. They just came, surrounded the place, and went\nfrom basement to attic and took everybody out whomever they could get and this was the\nway. They threw them in, in the pickup trucks like, like a piece of merchandise.",
        "Q: Did you see these?",
        "A: Some of them I saw, some of them I saw. I told you I was hidden and I saw them coming\nwith the truck and picking up people and then the truck left.",
        "Q: Did you have nightmares there?",

        "A: It was one big nightmare, the whole ghetto.",
        "Q: So one didn't distinguish?",
        "A: No, it wasn't a real world. It was a night -- big, big night -- scary nightmare.",
        "Q: Did Bert tell you about the radio reports, the underground radio?",
        "A: I knew it, I knew it because this oral surgeon, this friend of ours, he was very technical.\nHe could do anything with his hands and one day I come into the room and I see they're\nlistening. I said, \"Bert you're going to pay with your life.\u201d He said, \"What does it matter?\nThis way we, we could give people hope.\u201d They were spreading whatever they heard.\nNothing about out lives. Only the western front, the eastern front, you know, Russia and\nthe Allies and so on. This we knew. We knew exactly because they were listening.",
        "Q: Did they ever hear the reports from the Polish government in exile from Britain and what\nthey were doing on the radio then?",
        "A: No, no, no. They just had reports were approaching our midst because they were already\nliberated in I think in '44. The Lodz ghetto was way before us liberated. I think in\nJanuary of '44 and we were liberated in '45 in April. They were liberated by the end of\n'44, the Lodz ghetto. The end of '44 beginning of '45. This was they ended. We still had a\nyear to go.",
        "Q: What was that last deportation? You were on the last deportation?",
        "A: We, we were on the last deportation. Bert went to Koenigswusterhausen with the men\nand the women. I went to Ravensbrick.",
        "Q: And how long were you there?",
        "A: They sold us after we came in Nov -- October. I was there maybe three weeks. They sold\nus right away. They put us out naked in November and the young Germans came to look\nus over, the transport, you know. The only thing was missing they didn't look at our teeth\nbecause they looked everything over. It was a very nice transport, young women,\nprofessional young women. And they sold us so we went to this working camp from\nRavensbruck.",
        "Q: Did they select some people out from your group or did you all go?",
        "A: Older women with a few children went to the camp Bert was where the men, where\nBiebow's\u2019\u201d people went -- Biebow's camp. This is where they went. And the young\nwomen, that we were, we were staying there and sent to, to the camp to work.",
        "Q: What was the name of the camp?",
        "A: It was, first we were in Ravensbriick and they sent us to Tzana Arado. There was this\nairplane factory, Arado, this is where we were.",
        "Q: What, what do you remember about Ravensbriick? Was this -- you were there for a\ncouple of weeks?",
        "A: I was -- what can I tell you? They also had crematorium also there. They, they did check\nus out. We had an obstetric doctor. You know, I was -- they knew very little because they\nwere checking me out and injecting something. I don't know what it was and I heard one\nwoman talking to the other, \"Oh, she's a virgin.\u201d You see how little they knew because I\nwas already a married lady. They, after the war, I had problems conceiving and my\nbrother told me that the, the obstetrician that checked me out, a friend, said that I need a\nmiracle that I will never make it, they exper -- because of the experimentation. It took me\na long time. It took me over a year and, and running from one doctor to another and a\nmiracle happened. I conceived.",
        "Q: So, they injected you with you something?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: More than once?\n'\u00b0 Hans Biebow (1902-1947) was the head of the Lodz Ghetto administration",
        "A: Once, once when we first arrived. They shaved everybody's head. I wasn't shaved\nbecause before we left I said to Bert, you know if they have to do the job I better do it by\nmyself and had a crewcut like a boy's cut. So, they didn't touch me.",
        "Q: Before you left Lodz?",
        "A: Be-before we left the hospital, you know. We were in a hospital together, like a camp,\nbefore they sent us out on the trip. So, I, I told you we had the last supper there and I cut\nmy hair so short, they didn't touch me because everybody was bald. They, they really cut\n-- shaved -- them.",
        "Q: Where did you get that idea from to cut your hair?",
        "A: I don't know. I told you I lived by my intuition most of the time, not by my wits, by my\nintuition. I has a terr-it scares me sometimes because sometimes things are going to\nhappen and I know in advance. I saw it and I lived it and I keep on telling Bert, \u201cListen to\nme because every time you listen to me you know I'm right,\u201d and now he, we had to wait\nso many years for him to find out that I'm right, the intuition.",
        "Q: When you got to Ravensbriick, did you begin to find out what had been happening in the,\nin the camps?",
        "A: Yes, you see, we were privileged. We lived on the gypsy block, 2,000 gypsies and they\nwere so proud being German gypsies, they treated us to cruelly you wouldn't believe it.\nYou know Paroe. they said he never went to the bathroom, the same happened to us,\nbecause as soon as we would go to, to do what we had to do, they would, they would\ndrag us out. They would never let us go to the toilet. So, when we came to the factory,\nyou know, every morning at 5:00 o'clock in the morning we were already walking for\nmiles to go to the factory, this is where I washed, I told you, and this is where we did\nwhat we had to do because we couldn't do it in Ravensbruck.",
        "Q: Could you speak with each other, they gypsies?",
        "A: I spoke German so it was no problem. You had an advantage if you, if you could\ncommunicate. It helped so much more. My life was really saved by Princess Potocka, a\nvery known Polish family. She was a young woman of 30 that time and she was working\nwith us in the factory in Arado, and she had an, an affair going with some German\nMeister\u2019\u00ae or something. He was in charge, a German fellow, and then one SS woman\n'\u00a9 Master (German)\nfrom the kitchen, she was in charge fell in love with her. She was a very attractive\nwoman and brought her over to the kitchen, wouldn't let her go anymore to the factory.\nSo I became the mailman. It, it isn't funny because I paid almost with my life once, but I\nwas getting letters from her to give it to him. Before I went home in the evening, he\nwould give me a note for her and I would stick it somewhere, you know, and every night\nwhen I came to the camp I would have a big bowl of very thick soup and I would share it\nwith my mother, with Bert's sister and another young girl was very sick -- heart\ncondition, I would share it with her, too. She passed away a few months later, but she\nsaved my life. I mean, all right, I did a job for her but for until the liberation every single\nday I came I could count on a good soup and I think this kept me going.",
        "Q: Was the work hard in Zana, in the airplane factory?",
        "A: Yes, it is hard because a little woman sitting with a, with a air hammer, which you know\nthe body goes and the whole thing goes, it is hard and I wasn't the best worker, either.\nYes, it was hard, but I was lucky. I really was. I was lucky the fellow that was in charge\nof where I worked, a German also, he was very nice to me, a married man, middle age,\nand he felt sorry for us so this poor women coming here and struggling. He would bring\nme a butt of a cigar, he would bring me from his wife a pair of pants. At least I had a pair\nof pants to change. He would make me a comb so my hair started to grow out. I could --\nhe was really nice, nice to me, wonderful. With this butt, you know, I could get two\npieces of bread for that. And this is how I survived. After the war we said thank you to\nhim.",
        "Q: And now you were injured in some way in Zana, is that right? You had blood poisoning?",
        "A: Oh, I have -- see this? A souvenir for life, yeah. From this metal, I got probably a, a cut\nand I had poisoning and there was one SS woman, young we called her Snow White\nbecause she was so charming and so gentle with us. She had to watch over us, you know,\nso we don't escape or anything else, and she went with me with when I had this in three\nplaces at the same time I had this blood poisoning.\nShe took me to, to a doctor that came with us on the transport, a young Jewish woman,\nand she took the tweezers, just pulled it off. Opened up the -- and I don't know how it\nhealed. It took a long time, you know, complications, but it healed. It seems that a young\nperson can survive everything. So I was lucky that people took to me and I was lucky. I\nwas really lucky.",
        "Q: Were you ever hurt or beaten?",
        "A: No, I wasn't.",
        "Q: Not your mother?",
        "A: My mother was, I wasn't. My mother shortly before the liberation when the Allies start to\nbomb, people got very uneasy, very nervous. The natives, the natives, and they took out\nHalftling,'\u2019 we were Halftling, you know. They took us out, they took the women, which\ndidn't go to the factory to dig the anti-aircraft ditches. And I don't know what happened.\nMy mother didn't move fast enough. They beat her up, but how -- I didn't believe she was\ngoing to make it. She was all over black and blue. But they didn't touch me.",
        "Q: How do you account for your mother's spirit and her ability to keep you going?",
        "A: I, I thought, I thought that, I always thought that she was a very smart woman, very\nbright woman. She was a young woman, after the war she was in her beginning 40s but\npeople were always, all the people coming for advice to her because she was that kind of\na person that everybody liked her. She corresponded with the whole world. The letters\nshe was receiving even after she passed away and the pictures and so on. I saw it. She\nwas a strong personality, you know and the chance of survival was much better than\nsomebody that is very frugal, you know, frail.",
        "Q: And she was really important to you?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Tell me about the -- I don't know how to -- we use the word liberation but it's such a long\nprocess. What, what are you thinking of?",
        "A: I think about that you are never liberated. I'm going to freak out I know it. Can we stop?",
        "Q: Irene could you describe the period of time when it looks as if the war is going to be\nover, what we seem to be calling liberation. What went on?",
        "A: We didn't know when it's going to be over until the moment it was over, because here we\nwere in this working camp. It's true that they didn't, they didn't do anything to us. They\ndidn't rape us. They didn't -- we were caged and went to work and came from work and\nwe didn't know until the 26th of April '45 when we saw the women SS and the men\n'\u2019 Nazi term for persons incarcerated 1n a concentration, slave labor, or other type of camp\n(German).\npacking stuff and going away. Suddenly we saw everybody is running and we didn't\nbudge. We didn't move because where could we go. To whom could we run? And this is\nhow we found out about the we are free, free to what?",
        "Q: What did you do during the bombardments?",
        "A: I was lying on my with, with my mother on the bunk. We, we didn't move. In the\nbeginning we did, but later on we didn't even move. We didn't have the energy. We were\nwalking for hours every day. We didn't have clothes. We were wearing like blue jeans\nuniforms, not even with long sleeves, you know. We didn't have anything. It was cold\nand, and we were hungry and we didn't have any, any hygienic possibilities, you know?\nThey gave us a very watery, like a Kamillentee'\u00ae soup. You know, I used it to wash, I\ndidn't eat it. This was only to drink, but I needed it to wash. We didn't, we didn't know\nwhat was going on until we saw it.\nThen when everybody was running, the people started to look for food. They went to this\nfactory restaurant they went, and they had a warehouse full of food and they start to grab\nit and eat it and there's so many got dysentery and all kinds of -- and I was just the\nopposite. I was organizing the food and giving it away to everybody. I couldn't eat. I\ndidn't need to eat anymore.",
        "Q: Who were the soldiers that came in?",
        "A: We had the Russian soldiers that came in.",
        "Q: Were they kind?",
        "A: Very much so. To us they were, you know, like people say, they were raping -- they\ndidn't have to rape. The German women were standing in line to be, to be raped, to get a\nbar of chocolate or some cigarettes.\nThey didn't have to rape. In any case, we were ten women in a, in a house after the\nliberation when they starting shooting everybody. I was the youngest woman there and\nall these ladies with their daughters, they wanted to, they wanted to run with me. And the\nRussian soldiers, they were fighting. It was on the Elbe River, the fighting going on. This\nis where we were located and they, they told us not to go in groups because the Germans\nwill think it's military and they will start shooting so I ran and all these people ran after\nme and we came to a small town already Russian occupied. I went to the Kommandant\u201d\u201d\nand he gave us a house of a German doctor that run away. He gave us a soldier to stay all\n'\u00ae Chamomile tea (German)\n'? Commander (German)\nnight long to, to watch over us so I can't complain. We were very -- I was very lucky. We\nwere lucky. We always had nice people to take care of us.",
        "Q: And you didn't know what was happening to Bert or where he was?",
        "A: No, I didn't, I didn't know. I didn't know. They told me that he's dead and I didn't give up.\nI was looking for him every where. After the war I told you we were in this small town\non the Elbe River, the Commandant made me a translator, you know. German, I spoke\nalready English and Russian and we didn't have -- it was like a hole in the wall. It was far\naway, we didn't have any, we didn't have anybody to communicate with and one day a\nyoung man, 18 years old, comes to our door. He's, he's looking some place to live, a\nyoung boy, a Polish boy. So, my mother said to me, \u2019 You know Irene, we will take this\nboy in.\u201d Maybe somebody would take care of David. We did. It's a long story. Through\nhim I found Bert. And Dora, Dora was with us. Bert I found through him, through this\nyoung boy.",
        "Q: How?",
        "A: He was, he spoke fluent Russian. He came from the Russian part of Poland, you know.\nSpeaking Rus -- speaking, they spoke Russian, and the boy made accqua-acquaintances\nand we were close to Berlin, very short distance to Berlin and he would go to Berlin.\nHe was smuggling. I was working for the commander and I had to go and buy pro -- get\nprovisions for the commander and I did it. So, to the commander went a part and a part\nwent to our house where all the ten of us were living. They had, I ate with the\ncommandant, it was a group. And one day this -- Genneg(ph) was his name -- came home\nand he said there is a nunnery and they have men, they are all swollen up from hunger\nafter the concentration camp. He's very sick and they don't have enough food for. So, my\nmother started to make packages. We had plenty of food and this Genneg took the\nbicycle and every day he delivered the food. Came a time when he comes and he says\nhe's all right he's going back to Lodz and he wants you to, to write down your names and\nwhere you are and I said to my mother, so we write. He will throw it away some place.\nMother says, \u201cBut it doesn't harm you to write it down,\u201d so we did. He went to L\u00e9dz, he\nput it at the town hall and my brother was there with a friend and the friend says, \"Look,\nthis is your mother and Irene here.\u201d\u2019 He knew where to find us and he found us. This, this\nwas he found us. The men survived and he was grateful and, and he gave me a chance to\nfind my brother. And then my brother they, they started him to get involved, you know to\ntranslate and so on and I started and he told me that he heard that Bert was alive. He\ndidn't know where but he knows he's alive. So, there is nothing for me to do here\nanymore, I'm going to look for him. Went to Berlin, got the papers because at that time --\nGermany was divided already, English zone, American zone and so on -- got the papers\nand I brought over the first transport of people from Berlin to the English zone, 60 people\nof us. We come to Brunswick, this is two hours from Han-Hannover, I think a short\ndistance from, and I am at the railroad station with Dora and I said -- my mother was left\nbehind with my brother in this small town -- I said we have to get on this train no matter\nwhat. And as we talk a young man comes over and he recognized me and I said you\nknow I heard that my, my husband is alive but I'm looking for him.\nSo he says you know I have to tell you something. Your husband is an angel. Why? He\nwas working in the town hall, Bert, voluntary, and this man, it was curfew after the war.\nCertain times you couldn't move around and you needed papers, identification. Bert\nwrote him out the papers and gave him everything and he wanted to give him money. So,\nBert says when I do for someone a fa-favor I don't take pay for it and go and\nGesundheit.\u201d\u00b0 I met this fellow at the railroad station and he told me where Bert was. I\nknew where he was. So, we got on this train at four in the morning. You know people\nwere hanging on trains. You didn't have a regular, you know -- it was right after the war.\nWe got there to Hannover and then the experience how we met it was just unbelievable.\nBut it's a long story, too long. But we met. I found him.",
        "Q: Then what did you do?",
        "A: And then, Dora thought I didn't have feelings because when I saw him not one tear came\nout of my eye. I was just like a, like a piece of ice. I couldn't, I couldn't comprehend and I\ndidn't believe it's real because every man I saw on the street I thought it was Bert. Well,\nbut then two days later, I got very, very sick. The reaction was delayed. It came later, so,\nyeah, then we started our life.",
        "Q: You stayed in Hannover for a while?",
        "A: Four years. '49 we left, '45 we met, August '45 and in '49 we came to the United States.",
        "Q: Was that difficult to be in Germany for those years?",
        "A: It was very difficult because every stone was full of blood and we knew it, and we,\nwhenever we looked at a German we thought maybe you were the killer of my father.",
        "Q: Did you want to come to the United States?",
        "A: Yes, yes, we wanted to. We wanted to come to the United States.",
        "Q: So, were you trying for four years to come?\n*\u201d God bless you (German)",
        "A: Yes, we registered and then we, we waited for better times.",
        "Q: Were, were you both able to speak English at this time?",
        "A: Yes. Oh, I didn't tell you this most important thing. When I met Bert I didn't speak\nGerman, and he didn't speak Polish and we communicated in English. And my wedding\nband and his was inscribed in English.\nI wrote him down for better and for worse and he wrote me down forever yours, and the\ntwo rings survived, yeah. My daughters have one and the other one has the second.",
        "Q: Now had you both learned English prior to meeting?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, sure. We grew up with learning, with languages. I told you I loved\nlanguages, and they came very easy to me.",
        "Q: And what was it like for you when you came to this country? Was this, was this difficult?",
        "A: Sure it was difficult because we didn't have anybody. Bert started to work the second day\nwe came here. He started to walk the waterfront of New York and he saw help wanted.\nSo he was sweeping -- with all his education he was sweeping the floors. Six months\nlater he was the administrator of the place, of the factory and he stayed there for a while.\nThey wouldn't give him a break. He wouldn't get paid right for what he was doing. He\nquit.",
        "Q: Did you work?",
        "A: Oh, I worked, I worked all the time.",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: I was a buyer, department stores.",
        "Q: So, you picked up, you picked up where your parents left off?",
        "A: I don't know, you see, when I went to Queens I took merchandising and so to be a buyer\nyou didn't need a degree. You didn't need to be educated. You had to have your common\nsense and, and know what you were doing, but they sent me there and I started to work in\nthis firm and I worked all this, through the different stages because we were moving a lot.\nBert was traveling and we were moving. We went to Scranton. We were in many places.",
        "Q: Did people ask you questions about your life during the war or did they ignore it?",
        "A: Nobody asked me, and I never answered until now.",
        "Q: Do you think people learned?",
        "A: No. I told you about our friend in Munich. When we saw him last time and we were\ntalking he said you know Irene, these Germans, our people didn't learn yet. They didn't\nlearn from all the experience and it's so true. Nobody learned because we thought it was\ngoing to be a great world that people learned from their mistakes and it's going to be a\ngood place to be alive and live and -- but look what happens. It's worse than before the\nsecond world war. All the signs are there. All this hatred.",
        "Q: So, it's very frustrating?",
        "A: It is, it is.",
        "Q: Even if one tells the truth?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: Even if one tells the truth.",
        "A: Yes, because a lot of people don't believe you. With all the signs, with all the corpus\ndelecti,\u201d' they have everything there and the people, the soldiers, the American soldiers\nthat came into these places and smelled the stench and, and saw this, this cruelty and\npeople still deny it, and they're young people. The future leaders of this country...Don't\nmake me cry again.",
        "Q: Is there anything that we have forgotten to talk about that you'd like to talk about?",
        "A: No, there's too much to talk about that you couldn't -- you could spend the whole few\ndays talking about it.",
        "Q: Why do you want to talk about it now?\n*! Body of the crime (Latin)",
        "A: Because, because, now that we are here. That people are denying the Holocaust. No, you\njust can't let it because the, the future generations have to avoid anything like happen\nagain, and it can happen anywhere.",
        "Q: Is there something particular you'd like to say to your children or to other people's\nchildren who might watch this about your life and about your experience?",
        "A: Oh, my life is not extraordinary. It's just a life of one of the six millions or more, and\nwhat would I want to say. Just watch out because you have to be very vocal. You just\ncan't go and talk or mix in or, or, or getting assimilated into this everything will work out.\nIt won't. You have to work for it. You have to do something about it to make it a better\ntomorrow.",
        "Q: When you look at contemporary history now with Rwanda and Bosnia do you, do you\nwonder if civilization can ever change? Does it depress you?",
        "A: It's -- I think that people can change. People can change, but what we lack is leadership.\nYou need somebody to look up to. This is how it used to be with the movies, you know,\nyoung people I remember when I was young you went to a movie you had an idol. People\nthat did good things and, and they were heroes. What kind of heroes do we have today\u201d?\nTo whom could we look up to? Do you know someone that you can look up to?",
        "Q: Do, do you understand why people sometimes criticize Rumkowsk1? He has -- do you\nthink it's totally inappropriate?",
        "A: I think it's inappropriate because I can be objective about it. I saw everything happening.\nI lived through it. If not him not one person would survive from the Lodz ghetto because\nit would be annihilated in '42 they want to do it. So, he started to deal with them. We give\nyou anything you want, workmanship. We have good workers in every field. Give us\nfood. And he was stretching the days, stretching them, and because of him a lot of people\nsurvived. But you know, every -- a lot of people have grudges. You do something good\nfor them 10 times, 11 times you can't -- you make an enemy. The 10 times are forgotten.\nThis is why I, I think it is disappointing but what can I say? Who am I to say anything?\nNobody can judge. Nobody can judge that didn't live through it.",

        "A: There was no way escaping. Escaping where to? You see, if we would have connections\nwith population, the rest of the Polish population it was a different story, but the ghetto\nwas divided. We had a bridge going from one side to another but the trams were going\nalong the ghetto and the Poles would make fun of us. They looked at us and made all\nkinds of awful, awful gestures. So, how -- we, we couldn't connect with anybody. We had\nno one to connect with.",
        "A: All the time, all the time, yes. We, we had such a small -- and you know -- a growing\nyoung person needs their food more probably than an older person and we didn't have\nthat. You didn't have that, what we know now about proteins. Didn't have those things.\nWe didn't have fruits. We were lucky when we got some potato peels, then we were\nlucky because you made a big feast out of it.",
        "A: We, when we were getting some flour, were trying to make -- you wouldn't believe how\npeople were so -- they were discovering a new way of cooking because from nothing we\nmade something.\nI didn't know how to cook. I never learned it from my mother because she didn't know\nhow to cook, so I never learned it. But in the ghetto after we got married with Bert I\nstarted to experiment and somehow I managed. Listen, it didn't matter anyhow whatever\nwe ate it was just to stuff our stomachs, not to go hungry.",
        "A: Oh, yes, there was always a black market in the ghetto, yes.",
        "A: There were people that were smuggling in. There were smugglers in the ghetto that\nbrought in all different kinds of stuff and there were people that were selling. It was like a\nbartering business, you know. They smoked, so they would give away their last piece of\nbread to get a smoke, to get a cigarette.",
        "A: No, no. I never liked the smell of it and I, I was very athletic and I didn't smoke. My\nmother didn't smoke and I was copying my mother and in a lot of ways, I'm like my\nmother, most of the ways.",
        "A: Oh, yes -- in the ghetto? No. My sports was going to work and coming home.",

I have a picture of him.\nI told you that I got these pictures, I have a picture of him too, but I don't remember. It\nwas -- I told you a lot of things I forgot.",
        "A: We had, we had hospitals, but people were afraid to go to hospitals because you never\nknew when the Germans will come in and take everybody out and just get rid of them.\nBut we had hospitals. We had good doctors.",

I don't remember. I told you I don't remember a lot of things, but I know\nsomebody saved my life. Oh, I know, I know. There was I told you outside, outside of the\nghetto there was this big, factory, straw factory and other factories. And when the\nGermans announced they are going to grab people, they wanted a transport, Bert sent me\nwith a friend of ours, the one he lives, he's in Canada now, the same fellow, to hide me in\none of the factories there because people weren't coming to work. They weren't working.\nIt was -- the Germans wanted everybody to stay home so they have it easier, to grab us.\nThis fellow took me to this place called Maryzin, part of the city, and hid me until 1t was\nover. I was, I was in the factory. I was, I was, I think I was the only person there. There\nwas no one there but me and this young man was with me that brought me over there and\nwhen it was over they let us know. And this, oh, I was sure I was going to be finished this\ntime.",

        "A: My father had a good position. He was in charge of a Kooperative. Rumkowski gave him\na privileged job because, you know, he never forgot that my father supported him and so\non, and my mother was an instructor in a underwear factory. She knew the business. This\nwas her business so she was an instructor. And so, but it was hopeless for my father. He\njust, he couldn't adjust to the conditions. He was killed after the war, the third of May '45,\nhe was on the walk, and they took a transport and wanted to bring them to the sea and\ndrown them there. He couldn't walk so he was shot. My brother was there too, and my\nfather said to him, \"Run for your life, just leave me alone here and save yourself.\u201d Pushed\nhim away and my brother ran for his life. And since I know this story of run for your life,\nI ran for my life every night because I have always these nightmares and I scream, \"Run,\nrun for your life.\u201d That tells me I don't, I don't remember he told me, \"Run for your life.\"",

And because of her I was\nalive because I think I was giving in.\nI didn't feel like living anymore when we were in the concentration camp and the allies\nwere bombing. I prayed to God that the bombs should come and get us because we were\nso sick of living.",
        "A: I don't know how somebody else felt. I know how my father felt. He was world -- very\nworldly, very sophisticated man and had such plans for his children for the future, for a\ngood future, and this is what happened. He was very depressed and disappointed. He\ndidn't fight enough to survive. You had to fight for your life.",
        "A: Oh, as I said, I was married for a few months and was dissolved of the marriage and I\nwas living with my parents. I worked on the other side of the bridge. Bert's office was\nthere on the, on the other side and I, I saw him quite often and the corners of my eyes I\nsaw. I would never turn around. A lady didn't turn around, but I, I saw him watching me\nand looking after me. I could see it. And one day I came from work going home, he was\nwalking with his secretary and his secretary knew me because he used to work for my\nfather before the war and I knew they were talking about me. I knew it. And then this\nfellow came to, to, to my parents house and said Irene, he wanted a date with me. I was, I\ndidn't, I was very blue and I had enough. I didn't want anymore to go out. My mother\nsaid, \"Don't sit home. You don't sit shee'va.\u2019 Go out and meet people. Don't just go to\nwork and come home.\" And I did and I had this date with him and I came hour earlier\nbecause I didn't want to go to this date. And my mother pushed me, she said, \"Go\" I said,\n\"Mom it's so late.\u201d \"See if he's there it's fine. If not you come home.\u201d We knew it was\ncurfew after a certain hour, I don't remember what time it was you couldn't walk\nanymore. So, it means I would be stuck on this date and won't be able to go home. But I\nwent, an hour late, and he was just turning around to -- he didn't wait anymore and he\nwas walking and he saw me. So, we went to his boss. He said his boss 1s sick, has a cold\nand we went there and my girlfriend supposed to be the date of his boss. We come, we\ncome there, he -- and Bert opens the door and greeted me and I don't know when he\ngreeted me, I said \"This is it!\" And I had to stay there. My girlfriend wasn't there, but it\nturned out that my girlfriend was this fellow's date and Bert was playing violin. He has a\nlovely voice and -- yes, he has a lovely voice -- he was singing and we were talking. And\nI was -- he knew my life story already from my girlfriend, everything. I didn't have to tell\nhim anything, but in the morning I went straight to work. It was few blocks from where\nhe lived. And this was, 1s it. This is how we started dating. About ten months later we got\nmarried.\n\u201d The seven obligatory days of mourning for the deceased's next of kin (Hebrew).",
        "A: No, it didn't. No, it didn't because Bert even though he was in a privileged position and\nhe was getting special food, extra, he sent it to my parents, yeah, and there was a girl who\nused to work for him and she had tuberculosis. He took her in. She was with us all day\nlong. At night she went to her family and he didn't want her to work. She had to take it\neasy so he made her life easy. She survived. She lives in, in Sweden.",
        "A: Yeah, I was. Oh, sure. Oh yes, sure I lived with my parents. There wasn't such a thing as\n-- you know. There was respect.",
        "A: No, no, no. I didn't know, because you see he had an older sister, she wasn't married yet.\nSo, when we were talking about, you know, getting -- the second day we met, he told me\nyou are, you are going to be my wife. I said, \"Oh, no. I had a bad experience and I'm too\nyoung now to go through it again. I don't, I don't know what's going to happen.\u201d And he\nsaid to me, \u201cEven though I have an older sister but you are going to be my wife.\u201d This\nwas the second date we had.\nAnd so, we courted for a while and 10 months later we got married. We were together a\nfew months when the evacuation came and -- oh -- this was awful. We met 10 months\nafter the war. I found him 10 months after the war.",
        "A: Oh, she was with me in the concentration camp.",
        "A: Yes, sure, I didn't know her. She didn't want me to marry Bert. She was very much\nagainst it. \"Oh, my, my brother is going to be married to some divorced woman.\" She\nwas, she was giving him trouble. So, Rumkowski didn't know about whom they're\ntalking, so he said -- and Bert went to Rumkowski to ask permission to marry me. He\nsaid I want to see your future wife. I want to see her because your sister is so much\nagainst it. And when I came to him, he invited me to his house. I came here and I thought\nhe would go ballistic. He saw me, he says, \"You are the one?\" I said yes and I told him\nthe story why I separated from the other one. And he said, \"All right you will get married.\nI will give you away, and I will give Dora some sermon.\u201d And he told her, he told her.",
        "A: No, no, no, no. It wasn't typical. We had a Standesamt,'\u201d you know. We had a civil office\nwhere you got your, like you get your license here, it was the same thing. But she was\nagainst me marrying her brother. He was the apple of her eye, you know, and she -- he --\nthought no one was good enough for, for him, but Rumkowski told her different.",
        "A: Oh, yes, she did. Listen, she survived because of me. We were in Ravensbrick and it\nwasn't fun and I really took care of her there. I took care of her and she came out of it, but\nshe didn't live long enough.",
        "A: In June, June 27, '43, and it was a place where Rumkowski was giving marriages because\nJews weren't allowed to get married and you didn't have wedding bands. They give you a\nhandkerchief, you know.\nBut there was this place that he was giving people away and we married with 18 or 19\npeople. I have part of the picture, a few couples with me. I have it, I told you, yeah. This\nis where we got married. On a honeymoon we didn't go, I assure you.",
        "A: It was, no, Dora gave for my parents and her, her family dinner. This was it. There was\nno party.",

        "A: No. I was very low. I mean lying low. I didn't make any waves. I was very -- I socialized\nvery little because after I got -- we knew, knew what was going on, how the people felt\nSO, SO, SO We didn't socialize too much. Bert had a group of people, a few couples. He was\nthe only bachelor, and we met with these people. We played a lot of cards at times, and\nwe read a lot, but I didn't know many people. Every-everybody knew me because, you\n'\u00b0 Civil marriage ceremony (German)\nknow, they knew my family. We, we didn't, we didn't do anything special because like\nlife was so hard and when you, when you came from work you wanted to relax and take\nit easy.

        "A: Like, like they would surround at any time at will every place, every house and direct\npeople out. We never knew who was next on the line. No, we didn't know that. And life\nwas very iffy.",
        "A: No, I didn't. The one German that supposed to pay us for, and I was waiting every single\nday for weeks at, at you know, we had a gate on the Baugehirn.'' This is where the whole\nbrain of the ghetto was sitting, you know, the president Rumkowski was there and his\nsecretary and the Germans had their people sitting there.\nThis is where every dealing went through. I was waiting at the gate because he promised\nhe will pay us so much merchandise he took and we could live nicely because we were\nhungry. I saw him few times pass by in a Droschke.'* Do you know what a Droschke is?\nA horse and a carriage, but he never gave us a penny and when I met him after the war in\nMunich, like nothing ever happened. \u201cOh, Irene, he showed me this big apartment house\nhe owned and on top of the roof he had a swimming pool.\u201d And he said to me, \"Irene this\nall could you be yours. You didn't want it.\u201d I said, \"No, I wouldn't and I still don't want\nit.\u201d But he never, never gave a penny back. Bert wrote him a letter that she -- he -- should\nat least compensate my mother. He begged me not to tell his wife anything and I didn't.\nHe married a very lovely woman and this is it.

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I don't want to tell you what we did. You know what we did? We were picking the lice\nout of our clothes and trying, you know, to keep clean. Very hard. It was very hard.",
        "A: In the ghetto yes, but when we were in the concentration camp, we couldn't. But we did --\nyou know what I did? We had this metal pieces coming wrapped in brown paper and we\nhad to take off the paper and wash these pieces of metal with sudsy water.\nSo, after we did that, we took the, the pail in the toilet, you know, in the cabin, close up\nand get undressed and wash with this garbagy water. And then I had only one pair of\npants. This was it. No bra or nothing. So, I would take off the pants, wash it in this water\nand guess what I would do. I was working at the, at the press. I would hang the pants\nunder the table and the heat of the press would almost dry it. It was half dry. I would put\nit on again and this is the way I kept clean.",

        "A: I can't tell you that. I don't remember. I don't know. Nobody, nobody slept well, I guess,\nbecause it was always in the back of our minds that we don't know what's going to\nhappen next. You couldn't plan it. It wasn't a normal way of living.",
        "A: As I told you when you are young you are very optimistic. We were optimistic at one\ntime in the ghetto. We were very -- we were in love, you know, and we were talking\nabout things but we didn't believe we going to make it. Nobody did believe that we were\ngoing to make it.",
        "A: No, no. We knew, we knew that we didn't want to go any more through torture and we\nknew what these people are capable of. So, Bert was prepared, but my mother one night\nwhen we were asleep she cleaned out the rings. We still have some left over in this ring.",

She kept\nme going. I didn't want to, you know, we had -- when they bombarded the Allies, the\ncamp, we had to go in, into, go out and we go into the ditches, the anti-aircraft ditches. In\nthe beginning we did it with my mother, and later on we didn't do it anymore. We didn't\ngo out.

You didn't talk\nthe same language. They couldn't communicate with us. They spoke Czech. We spoke\nmostly Polish, mostly Yiddish, all the people spoke so it was very hard on, on these\npeople.

People did that in the ghetto. They had no choices and besides the\ncircumstances, you know. Maybe he had a better apart -- room -- than I have, and maybe\nhe had a better job than I had so there was a lot of marriages that could never happen if\nnot these circumstances.\nBecause very young girls sold themselves to, to old men.

I said, \"Bert you're going to pay with your life.\u201d He said, \"What does it matter?\nThis way we, we could give people hope.\u201d They were spreading whatever they heard.\nNothing about out lives. Only the western front, the eastern front, you know, Russia and\nthe Allies and so on. This we knew. We knew exactly because they were listening.",
        "A: No, no, no. They just had reports were approaching our midst because they were already\nliberated in I think in '44. The Lodz ghetto was way before us liberated. I think in\nJanuary of '44 and we were liberated in '45 in April. They were liberated by the end of\n'44, the Lodz ghetto. The end of '44 beginning of '45. This was they ended. We still had a\nyear to go.",
        "A: We, we were on the last deportation. Bert went to Koenigswusterhausen with the men\nand the women. I went to Ravensbrick.",
        "A: They sold us after we came in Nov -- October. I was there maybe three weeks. They sold\nus right away. They put us out naked in November and the young Germans came to look\nus over, the transport, you know. The only thing was missing they didn't look at our teeth\nbecause they looked everything over. It was a very nice transport, young women,\nprofessional young women. And they sold us so we went to this working camp from\nRavensbruck.",
        "A: Older women with a few children went to the camp Bert was where the men, where\nBiebow's\u2019\u201d people went -- Biebow's camp. This is where they went. And the young\nwomen, that we were, we were staying there and sent to, to the camp to work.",
        "A: It was, first we were in Ravensbriick and they sent us to Tzana Arado. There was this\nairplane factory, Arado, this is where we were.",
        "A: I was -- what can I tell you? They also had crematorium also there. They, they did check\nus out. We had an obstetric doctor. You know, I was -- they knew very little because they\nwere checking me out and injecting something. I don't know what it was and I heard one\nwoman talking to the other, \"Oh, she's a virgin.\u201d You see how little they knew because I\nwas already a married lady. They, after the war, I had problems conceiving and my\nbrother told me that the, the obstetrician that checked me out, a friend, said that I need a\nmiracle that I will never make it, they exper -- because of the experimentation. It took me\na long time. It took me over a year and, and running from one doctor to another and a\nmiracle happened. I conceived.",
        "A: Yeah.\n'\u00b0 Hans Biebow (1902-1947) was the head of the Lodz Ghetto administration",
        "A: Once, once when we first arrived. They shaved everybody's head. I wasn't shaved\nbecause before we left I said to Bert, you know if they have to do the job I better do it by\nmyself and had a crewcut like a boy's cut. So, they didn't touch me.",
        "A: Be-before we left the hospital, you know. We were in a hospital together, like a camp,\nbefore they sent us out on the trip. So, I, I told you we had the last supper there and I cut\nmy hair so short, they didn't touch me because everybody was bald. They, they really cut\n-- shaved -- them.",
        "A: I don't know. I told you I lived by my intuition most of the time, not by my wits, by my\nintuition. I has a terr-it scares me sometimes because sometimes things are going to\nhappen and I know in advance. I saw it and I lived it and I keep on telling Bert, \u201cListen to\nme because every time you listen to me you know I'm right,\u201d and now he, we had to wait\nso many years for him to find out that I'm right, the intuition.",
        "A: Yes, you see, we were privileged. We lived on the gypsy block, 2,000 gypsies and they\nwere so proud being German gypsies, they treated us to cruelly you wouldn't believe it.\nYou know Paroe. they said he never went to the bathroom, the same happened to us,\nbecause as soon as we would go to, to do what we had to do, they would, they would\ndrag us out. They would never let us go to the toilet. So, when we came to the factory,\nyou know, every morning at 5:00 o'clock in the morning we were already walking for\nmiles to go to the factory, this is where I washed, I told you, and this is where we did\nwhat we had to do because we couldn't do it in Ravensbruck.",
        "A: I spoke German so it was no problem. You had an advantage if you, if you could\ncommunicate. It helped so much more. My life was really saved by Princess Potocka, a\nvery known Polish family. She was a young woman of 30 that time and she was working\nwith us in the factory in Arado, and she had an, an affair going with some German\nMeister\u2019\u00ae or something. He was in charge, a German fellow, and then one SS woman\n'\u00a9 Master (German)\nfrom the kitchen, she was in charge fell in love with her. She was a very attractive\nwoman and brought her over to the kitchen, wouldn't let her go anymore to the factory.\nSo I became the mailman. It, it isn't funny because I paid almost with my life once, but I\nwas getting letters from her to give it to him. Before I went home in the evening, he\nwould give me a note for her and I would stick it somewhere, you know, and every night\nwhen I came to the camp I would have a big bowl of very thick soup and I would share it\nwith my mother, with Bert's sister and another young girl was very sick -- heart\ncondition, I would share it with her, too. She passed away a few months later, but she\nsaved my life. I mean, all right, I did a job for her but for until the liberation every single\nday I came I could count on a good soup and I think this kept me going.",
        "A: Yes, it is hard because a little woman sitting with a, with a air hammer, which you know\nthe body goes and the whole thing goes, it is hard and I wasn't the best worker, either.\nYes, it was hard, but I was lucky. I really was. I was lucky the fellow that was in charge\nof where I worked, a German also, he was very nice to me, a married man, middle age,\nand he felt sorry for us so this poor women coming here and struggling. He would bring\nme a butt of a cigar, he would bring me from his wife a pair of pants. At least I had a pair\nof pants to change. He would make me a comb so my hair started to grow out. I could --\nhe was really nice, nice to me, wonderful. With this butt, you know, I could get two\npieces of bread for that. And this is how I survived. After the war we said thank you to\nhim.",
        "A: Oh, I have -- see this? A souvenir for life, yeah. From this metal, I got probably a, a cut\nand I had poisoning and there was one SS woman, young we called her Snow White\nbecause she was so charming and so gentle with us. She had to watch over us, you know,\nso we don't escape or anything else, and she went with me with when I had this in three\nplaces at the same time I had this blood poisoning.\nShe took me to, to a doctor that came with us on the transport, a young Jewish woman,\nand she took the tweezers, just pulled it off. Opened up the -- and I don't know how it\nhealed. It took a long time, you know, complications, but it healed. It seems that a young\nperson can survive everything. So I was lucky that people took to me and I was lucky. I\nwas really lucky.",
        "A: No, I wasn't.",
        "A: My mother was, I wasn't. My mother shortly before the liberation when the Allies start to\nbomb, people got very uneasy, very nervous. The natives, the natives, and they took out\nHalftling,'\u2019 we were Halftling, you know. They took us out, they took the women, which\ndidn't go to the factory to dig the anti-aircraft ditches. And I don't know what happened.\nMy mother didn't move fast enough. They beat her up, but how -- I didn't believe she was\ngoing to make it. She was all over black and blue. But they didn't touch me.",
        "A: I, I thought, I thought that, I always thought that she was a very smart woman, very\nbright woman. She was a young woman, after the war she was in her beginning 40s but\npeople were always, all the people coming for advice to her because she was that kind of\na person that everybody liked her. She corresponded with the whole world. The letters\nshe was receiving even after she passed away and the pictures and so on. I saw it. She\nwas a strong personality, you know and the chance of survival was much better than\nsomebody that is very frugal, you know, frail.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I think about that you are never liberated. I'm going to freak out I know it. Can we stop?",
        "A: We didn't know when it's going to be over until the moment it was over, because here we\nwere in this working camp. It's true that they didn't, they didn't do anything to us. They\ndidn't rape us. They didn't -- we were caged and went to work and came from work and\nwe didn't know until the 26th of April '45 when we saw the women SS and the men\n'\u2019 Nazi term for persons incarcerated 1n a concentration, slave labor, or other type of camp\n(German).\npacking stuff and going away. Suddenly we saw everybody is running and we didn't\nbudge. We didn't move because where could we go. To whom could we run? And this is\nhow we found out about the we are free, free to what?",
        "A: I was lying on my with, with my mother on the bunk. We, we didn't move. In the\nbeginning we did, but later on we didn't even move. We didn't have the energy. We were\nwalking for hours every day. We didn't have clothes. We were wearing like blue jeans\nuniforms, not even with long sleeves, you know. We didn't have anything. It was cold\nand, and we were hungry and we didn't have any, any hygienic possibilities, you know?\nThey gave us a very watery, like a Kamillentee'\u00ae soup. You know, I used it to wash, I\ndidn't eat it. This was only to drink, but I needed it to wash. We didn't, we didn't know\nwhat was going on until we saw it.\nThen when everybody was running, the people started to look for food. They went to this\nfactory restaurant they went, and they had a warehouse full of food and they start to grab\nit and eat it and there's so many got dysentery and all kinds of -- and I was just the\nopposite. I was organizing the food and giving it away to everybody. I couldn't eat. I\ndidn't need to eat anymore.",
        "A: We had the Russian soldiers that came in.",
        "A: Very much so. To us they were, you know, like people say, they were raping -- they\ndidn't have to rape. The German women were standing in line to be, to be raped, to get a\nbar of chocolate or some cigarettes.\nThey didn't have to rape. In any case, we were ten women in a, in a house after the\nliberation when they starting shooting everybody. I was the youngest woman there and\nall these ladies with their daughters, they wanted to, they wanted to run with me. And the\nRussian soldiers, they were fighting. It was on the Elbe River, the fighting going on. This\nis where we were located and they, they told us not to go in groups because the Germans\nwill think it's military and they will start shooting so I ran and all these people ran after\nme and we came to a small town already Russian occupied. I went to the Kommandant\u201d\u201d\nand he gave us a house of a German doctor that run away. He gave us a soldier to stay all\n'\u00ae Chamomile tea (German)\n'? Commander (German)\nnight long to, to watch over us so I can't complain. We were very -- I was very lucky. We\nwere lucky. We always had nice people to take care of us.",
        "A: No, I didn't, I didn't know. I didn't know. They told me that he's dead and I didn't give up.\nI was looking for him every where. After the war I told you we were in this small town\non the Elbe River, the Commandant made me a translator, you know. German, I spoke\nalready English and Russian and we didn't have -- it was like a hole in the wall. It was far\naway, we didn't have any, we didn't have anybody to communicate with and one day a\nyoung man, 18 years old, comes to our door. He's, he's looking some place to live, a\nyoung boy, a Polish boy. So, my mother said to me, \u2019 You know Irene, we will take this\nboy in.\u201d Maybe somebody would take care of David. We did. It's a long story. Through\nhim I found Bert. And Dora, Dora was with us. Bert I found through him, through this\nyoung boy.",
        "A: He was, he spoke fluent Russian. He came from the Russian part of Poland, you know.\nSpeaking Rus -- speaking, they spoke Russian, and the boy made accqua-acquaintances\nand we were close to Berlin, very short distance to Berlin and he would go to Berlin.\nHe was smuggling. I was working for the commander and I had to go and buy pro -- get\nprovisions for the commander and I did it. So, to the commander went a part and a part\nwent to our house where all the ten of us were living. They had, I ate with the\ncommandant, it was a group. And one day this -- Genneg(ph) was his name -- came home\nand he said there is a nunnery and they have men, they are all swollen up from hunger\nafter the concentration camp. He's very sick and they don't have enough food for. So, my\nmother started to make packages. We had plenty of food and this Genneg took the\nbicycle and every day he delivered the food. Came a time when he comes and he says\nhe's all right he's going back to Lodz and he wants you to, to write down your names and\nwhere you are and I said to my mother, so we write. He will throw it away some place.\nMother says, \u201cBut it doesn't harm you to write it down,\u201d so we did. He went to L\u00e9dz, he\nput it at the town hall and my brother was there with a friend and the friend says, \"Look,\nthis is your mother and Irene here.\u201d\u2019 He knew where to find us and he found us. This, this\nwas he found us. The men survived and he was grateful and, and he gave me a chance to\nfind my brother. And then my brother they, they started him to get involved, you know to\ntranslate and so on and I started and he told me that he heard that Bert was alive. He\ndidn't know where but he knows he's alive. So, there is nothing for me to do here\nanymore, I'm going to look for him. Went to Berlin, got the papers because at that time --\nGermany was divided already, English zone, American zone and so on -- got the papers\nand I brought over the first transport of people from Berlin to the English zone, 60 people\nof us. We come to Brunswick, this is two hours from Han-Hannover, I think a short\ndistance from, and I am at the railroad station with Dora and I said -- my mother was left\nbehind with my brother in this small town -- I said we have to get on this train no matter\nwhat. And as we talk a young man comes over and he recognized me and I said you\nknow I heard that my, my husband is alive but I'm looking for him.\nSo he says you know I have to tell you something. Your husband is an angel. Why? He\nwas working in the town hall, Bert, voluntary, and this man, it was curfew after the war.\nCertain times you couldn't move around and you needed papers, identification. Bert\nwrote him out the papers and gave him everything and he wanted to give him money. So,\nBert says when I do for someone a fa-favor I don't take pay for it and go and\nGesundheit.\u201d\u00b0 I met this fellow at the railroad station and he told me where Bert was. I\nknew where he was. So, we got on this train at four in the morning. You know people\nwere hanging on trains. You didn't have a regular, you know -- it was right after the war.\nWe got there to Hannover and then the experience how we met it was just unbelievable.\nBut it's a long story, too long. But we met. I found him.",
        "A: And then, Dora thought I didn't have feelings because when I saw him not one tear came\nout of my eye. I was just like a, like a piece of ice. I couldn't, I couldn't comprehend and I\ndidn't believe it's real because every man I saw on the street I thought it was Bert. Well,\nbut then two days later, I got very, very sick. The reaction was delayed. It came later, so,\nyeah, then we started our life.",
        "A: Four years. '49 we left, '45 we met, August '45 and in '49 we came to the United States.",
        "A: It was very difficult because every stone was full of blood and we knew it, and we,\nwhenever we looked at a German we thought maybe you were the killer of my father.",
        "A: Yes, yes, we wanted to. We wanted to come to the United States.\n*\u201d God bless you (German)",
        "A: Yes, we registered and then we, we waited for better times.",
        "A: Yes. Oh, I didn't tell you this most important thing. When I met Bert I didn't speak\nGerman, and he didn't speak Polish and we communicated in English. And my wedding\nband and his was inscribed in English.\nI wrote him down for better and for worse and he wrote me down forever yours, and the\ntwo rings survived, yeah. My daughters have one and the other one has the second.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, sure. We grew up with learning, with languages. I told you I loved\nlanguages, and they came very easy to me.",
        "A: Sure it was difficult because we didn't have anybody. Bert started to work the second day\nwe came here. He started to walk the waterfront of New York and he saw help wanted.\nSo he was sweeping -- with all his education he was sweeping the floors. Six months\nlater he was the administrator of the place, of the factory and he stayed there for a while.\nThey wouldn't give him a break. He wouldn't get paid right for what he was doing. He\nquit.",
        "A: Oh, I worked, I worked all the time.",
        "A: I was a buyer, department stores.",
        "A: I don't know, you see, when I went to Queens I took merchandising and so to be a buyer\nyou didn't need a degree. You didn't need to be educated. You had to have your common\nsense and, and know what you were doing, but they sent me there and I started to work in\nthis firm and I worked all this, through the different stages because we were moving a lot.\nBert was traveling and we were moving. We went to Scranton. We were in many places.",
        "A: Nobody asked me, and I never answered until now.",
        "A: No. I told you about our friend in Munich. When we saw him last time and we were\ntalking he said you know Irene, these Germans, our people didn't learn yet. They didn't\nlearn from all the experience and it's so true. Nobody learned because we thought it was\ngoing to be a great world that people learned from their mistakes and it's going to be a\ngood place to be alive and live and -- but look what happens. It's worse than before the\nsecond world war. All the signs are there. All this hatred.",
        "A: It is, it is.",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: Yes, because a lot of people don't believe you. With all the signs, with all the corpus\ndelecti,\u201d' they have everything there and the people, the soldiers, the American soldiers\nthat came into these places and smelled the stench and, and saw this, this cruelty and\npeople still deny it, and they're young people. The future leaders of this country...Don't\nmake me cry again.",
        "A: No, there's too much to talk about that you couldn't -- you could spend the whole few\ndays talking about it.\n*! Body of the crime (Latin)",
        "A: Because, because, now that we are here. That people are denying the Holocaust. No, you\njust can't let it because the, the future generations have to avoid anything like happen\nagain, and it can happen anywhere.",
        "A: Oh, my life is not extraordinary. It's just a life of one of the six millions or more, and\nwhat would I want to say. Just watch out because you have to be very vocal. You just\ncan't go and talk or mix in or, or, or getting assimilated into this everything will work out.\nIt won't. You have to work for it. You have to do something about it to make it a better\ntomorrow.",
        "A: It's -- I think that people can change. People can change, but what we lack is leadership.\nYou need somebody to look up to. This is how it used to be with the movies, you know,\nyoung people I remember when I was young you went to a movie you had an idol. People\nthat did good things and, and they were heroes. What kind of heroes do we have today\u201d?\nTo whom could we look up to? Do you know someone that you can look up to?",
        "A: I think it's inappropriate because I can be objective about it. I saw everything happening.\nI lived through it. If not him not one person would survive from the Lodz ghetto because\nit would be annihilated in '42 they want to do it. So, he started to deal with them. We give\nyou anything you want, workmanship. We have good workers in every field. Give us\nfood. And he was stretching the days, stretching them, and because of him a lot of people\nsurvived. But you know, every -- a lot of people have grudges. You do something good\nfor them 10 times, 11 times you can't -- you make an enemy. The 10 times are forgotten.\nThis is why I, I think it is disappointing but what can I say? Who am I to say anything?\nNobody can judge. Nobody can judge that didn't live through it.",
