        "Q: What was the name of the town that you were born in?",
        "A: Gletwitz.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you tell me about the town that is what you remember of it and when you were a\nsmall child.",
        "A: It was a rather small town. We had one synagogue and a small community. We went to the\nelementary school which was a Jewish school and I went there from first grade until fifth grade\nand that was in 1938. At, I was in the fifth grade. I had some very happy memories and let me\nstart with saying I also had a sister. She\u2019s born October 19 in 1932. That\u2019s the only sibling that I\nhave. My parents and my, rather my father was born in Germany, in Katowice which later on\nbecame Poland. So when he was about 14 years old he left Poland because he didn\u2019t want to be\nunder the Polish rule. His parents however remained there. My mother was born in a very small\ntown and she had one sister and she lived with us in Gleiwitz. Now my grandparents on my\nfather\u2019s, the parents of my father, they remained in Poland and they had 9 children but 2 of them\ndied before and one was killed early. I don\u2019t remember exactly when, when that child was killed.\nI do however know that they were very orthodox and very, very religious and my grandmother\nwould not light any lights on Shabbos. She would carry a handkerchief pinned to her dress and\nhad a head piece which was like sort of a lace bedekom which is something that they wore. And\nshe wouldn\u2019t even turn on the electricity or anything like that. And she had servants, but these\nservants were not even allowed to do that either. So they had to wait from sundown to sundown\nbefore they could eat warm food.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you tell me the names of all the people that you just referred to. I don\u2019t think we\nhave that down yet. You could perhaps start with the parents of your parents and work forward.",
        "A: My grandmother\u2019s name was Dirka Miyinski and my grandfather was Louis Mijinski. They\nhad a lot of children but I only knew about a couple of them. I remember one aunt. She had\ntwins. Her name was Erna and I don\u2019t remember her last name. There were two boys, twins,\nboys. Then the other aunt was Anna and she had one child when I was in Germany and there\nwas, this the one Anna lived in Germany. The one I just referred to with Erna, she lived in\nPoland, Katowice. Then there was a George, the brother of my dad who was a couple of years\nolder. He also was in Germany. He had one son. So that boy now lives in New York. The other\npeople that I barely know but my grandmother, my maternal grandmother was born in Germany\nas I said. And her name was Anna Zusman. Her maiden name was Hyman and my her husband\nwas the first Jewish locomotive engineer. And he worked his way up from being a coal boy but\nshoveling coal into the engines. And he just went higher and higher until he became an engineer.\nHe loved trains that much that whenever he was on vacation he would stand at the trestle and\nwatch all the trains go by. He just loved it. And my earliest recollection was of him. He had a\nstroke. I was 5 years old at that time. And he was paralyzed completely. And he could speak\nbut nobody could understand by myself. He talked to me about all the trains that he was running\nand all that information which he just loved. And I had a very close relationship with him. And\nbeing the very first grandchild, I\u2019d say my grandmother Anna spoiled me.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t think you said the name of your maternal grandfather, the one who worked for the\nrailroad.",
        "A: His name was Beno Zusman.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you tell me a little bit about your family life, what you remember because I know\nyou were very young and how your parents lived their lives and what you and your sister were\nlike.",
        "A: My father was out of town a lot. As a matter of fact he was gone sometimes for weeks at a\ntime. And my mother and her sister and my grandmother were very close and they would take\ntrips together with us children and by the way my aunt Ruth K, her name now was last name was\nKarliner but before that she was married to a Banger and they used to take us to the mountains\nand we had wonderful times. It was like a resort into the mountains which was resort was called\nReinerts. And I don\u2019t really know what kind of mountains they were, but I do remember having\na wonderful time up there with everyone. Climbing and, and using sticks where you put metals\non them telling you what city you were in which I thought fascinating. And it usually was around\nmy birthday. So they would have to kind of sneak the gifts into a suitcase so that they could\nsurprise me when I woke up on my birthday that they would have a present for me. I surely\ndidn\u2019t expect it because I mean we were so far away from home. But they did that for me. And\ngoing back again to, my sister she was born when I was five like I said. And she was born in our\nhouse. Our regular apartment. We didn\u2019t have a house in this case. But she was born and my\ncousin is the same age and she was born about 14 days prior to my sister. And she didn\u2019t tell her\nhusband that she was going to have the baby that soon. So when he came home, that\u2019s my uncle,\nuncle Herbert was his name. It was aunt Ruth\u2019s husband. He came home and he said what are\nyou doing in bed. And she said oh nothing. I didn\u2019t feel that good. She says, go look at the\ncarriage, the doll carriage that Margie has. And he said what. I\u2019ve seen that carriage and the\ndolls a million times before. And she says go take a look and go look at it again. Well finally to\nget him to do that, I urged him on. So I said uncle come look, come look, look at my Suzy. And\nhe looked in there and there was this child. My doll\u2019s name was Suzy so he didn\u2019t know that it\nwas areal child. But it was so funny because he couldn\u2019t get over it, that this little baby was in\nmy carriage. And he had no idea what had happened. And then my sister came a few, exactly\ntwo weeks later. One was, my cousin was on the third of October, my sister was born on the 19\nof October. But my dad was out of town as usual. And he did have an inkling that when he came\nback there would be a child there. And sure enough. In those days you didn\u2019t go to a hospital.\nYou had a midwife. And then I loved playing with the babies you might say because they were\nlike my own doll. And I was able to hold them and play with them. So that kind of grew because\nwhen I was about six years old, my parents put me in charge, my mother put me in charge of\ntaking care of my sister. And I would, I roll her up and down the streets. But then being a young\nkid, you know you kind of forget about what you\u2019re supposed to be doing. And a girlfriend of\nmine would say hey let\u2019s play hopscotch. So I did and the next thing I know my sister falls head\nover onto the cement, screaming, crying and I was so afraid to go back home. I thought oh my\nI\u2019m going to really get it. I came home because my, they could hear. I guess the whole\nneighborhood could hear my sister. She was really upset and a little hurt but not really\ndrastically. And I came home and she was still screaming and my mother says what happened\nwhat happened. And I said she fell kind of with the carriage on the cement. How could you.\nAnd my grandmother said what do you expect a child. She\u2019s still a child herself. You shouldn\u2019t\npunish her. So I got away with that one too. And later on we, where I was living they had\nalways a fair once a year. And that was run by the gypsies and they were living in these house\nwagons lined up along the plaza there. It was like in the, on Fridays they would have a market\nthere. and the rest of the time, at times they would have a fair. They would have carousels and\nbig wheel and that was a big treat for us. And because my sister was too small, we couldn\u2019t\u2019 take\nher and neither could we take our my cousin because she was the same age. And this was maybe\nwhen they were about three or four years old. And one night I remember very well, my aunt\ngoes home. Her daughter was missing and she got a shock of her life. Where could the child have\ngone to. She was gone. We combed the neighborhood. Everybody was running around and\nfinally we located her oh maybe a half a block away. Somebody had seen her walking as a little\nkid in the middle of evening, dark already and they took her in and they said you wait til your\nmom will come. And sure enough she was sitting in the window looking out and when my aunt\ncame by she said oh there\u2019s my mommy. And that was one of the things I really remember.\nVery, very well. I went to the Jewish school and that, that was a wonderful place. When I first\ngot there however, the very first year they asked us for a physical and they had this big hall and\nyou went from one doctor to the next. One was a doctor for general. Then there was a doctor for\nlooking in the eyes. There was a dentist that looked in your mouth. And of course they wanted us\nto be stripped to the waist because they wanted to take our I guess our vitals. Anyway, I wasn\u2019t\nabout to do that. I was too ashamed to show my body. And they said it\u2019s ok, you can do that.\nAnd I said no. I took my clothes and ran down the stairs and I didn\u2019t want to do it. So then the\nteacher came over to my mother and she said did you know that your daughter ran from school\nand my mother said no, why would she do that. And she said well she didn\u2019t want to undress.\nAnd my mother said, well of course. She\u2019s very shameful of showing her body you know. And I\nnever lived that one down. Ever since then, everybody is always laughing about it. The kids used\nto kind of snicker when they saw me. What are you ashamed of. You\u2019re not developed yet or\nanything like that. But it\u2019s I was only about six years old. And I mean to me my body was kind\nof precious and I wasn\u2019t about to show it off to anybody. And anyway, my sister, Eva, her name\nis Eva Renart. I don\u2019t know if I mentioned it prior to this. She went to kindergarten, also a\nJewish kindergarten and she had a wonderful time as well. And as I think back, we, my parents\nwell that is my mother and father if he was in town, and my aunt and her husband, they went to\nthe temple every Saturday faithfully. Of course in those days you didn\u2019t hire any baby sitters,\nyou used the older child. That was me. And I would have to play house and entertain the young\nones. And that was kind of fun because we played house and I was always the mother and they\nwere the children. And of course they had to behave. Otherwise I would punish them and put\nthem in a corner or something like that. And those are really very, very good memories for me\nbecause I enjoyed what I was doing. And then in see we lived in upper Silesia, so we were\nprotected by the Versailles contract or however you want to call it. I\u2019m not sure exactly the\nwording. But until 1935 Hitler could not touch us. But in 1935 Hitler then said no more Jews to\nleave out of the country. So my dad couldn\u2019t go anymore to the in his business to the Polish\nforests and to the Czechoslovakia Russia and so forth. So the Nazis took him for forced labor.\nAnd he was digging ditches and they were there was water accumulated over there. And he got\nquite ill. So in 1938 we did get, in the early part of 1938 we received an affidavit from our\nuncles. That is my grandmother\u2019s brothers who lived in Battle Creek, Michigan. They posted an\naffidavit but when my dad heard that there, you know he had, I don\u2019t know, he was very smart\nman. He had an inkling that things were going, not going to go so well for the Jews. So he\ndecided rather than waiting in Germany we should go ahead and go to another country that\u2019s\naffiliated with the United States, wait there and then as soon as our visa became valid that they\nwould give it to us, then we could go to America. That was the plan. However, that wasn\u2019t\nexactly what took place.",
        "Q: Before we get to the to your leaving Germany, I want to go back a little bit so I don\u2019t forget.\nWhy don\u2019t we talk a little bit about what you remember about where you lived, what your\nparents were like, what it was like when your grandparents moved into the house with you.",
        "A: Well my grandparents moved in once my grandfather got the stroke. They could not, my\ngrandmother wasn\u2019t able to take care of him. So we had moved into a place that had three\nbedrooms. And one was occupied by my parents. One was occupied by we rented out one and\nthe other one was my grandparents. And my grandmother and my grandfather had a beautiful\nroom and we enjoyed going in there and talking to them. Oh let me tell you something else that\nhappened. When I was about six years old, I think it was something like that. We had Passover\nand my father always wore the white kitle and he was a very, he came from a very orthodox\nfamily. So he wore the white kitle like I said and my grandfather who had a stroke couldn\u2019t get\nup. So he sat there and asked the children. Of course it was us children, so they were still kind of\ntiny and they were just sitting and like in a little not a playpen exactly but something where they\ncould contain them because they were just crawling around at that point. And all of a sudden I\nsaid you know dad, you look like a beggar. Oh, my dad got so upset at me. How dare I say you\nlook like a beggar and my grandfather, my father was so upset at me, my grandfather being he\ncouldn\u2019t speak very well, start in his own way yelling. Well the women all were in the kitchen\ntrying to bring the food out. When they heard my father yelling and my grandfather trying to\nyell and me crying they dumped all the dishes on the kitchen floor. That was my mother, my aunt\nand my grandmother. They came running. What in the world happened. And when we told them\nwhat happened, well it wasn\u2019t a big deal. But to me it was horrible that my dad would get so\nupset that I said that. Our neighborhood where I lived was mostly Catholic or Protestant. I think\nit was more like Catholic. So the girlfriends that I had in our very immediate neighborhood were\nall Christian kids. So but they never made a difference between my being Jewish and themselves.\nAnd they would call us and say come on and play with me. And I would go out and play with\nthem. And until they very day that we left, I never knew that they would even, have a difference.\nSo to me I was accepted as their equal. There was no discrimination. The schooling had to be in,\nI had to go to a Jewish school because I guess maybe the others wouldn\u2019t accept us. I really don\u2019t\nknow why. But I started the first grade and went all the way up to fifth. Like I said before. And\nthat\u2019s the only way there was. But one of the memories I have that also that I loved to dance.\nAnd do gymnastics. So at a very early age, my mother enrolled me into a school for gymnastics\nand I wanted to become a gymnastics teacher. Or a ballerina. Anything that had to do with dance\nor whatever. And I was pretty flexible and I enjoyed it very much. And then we would put on\nplays, like little dances and so forth and with that we would then entertain our congregation. Or\nwe would go to the old age home and perform over there. It was really a lot of fun and my\nmother made sure I had the most beautiful costumes. One of the ones that I really remember is\nthat I was a butterfly and my girlfriend was the flower. So I could dance around a lot. And we,\nthese are just wonderful memories and I had also of course a lot of Jewish girlfriends, that is\nwhen school would let out. I would go over there and play with them and one of the girls had a\nbicycle. Well I didn\u2019t have one. So she would let me ride the bicycle. Well the first time I got\nonto the bike, I headed right straight for the rose bushes. And I came out of there looking and a\nmess, scratched up from head to toe. You might say. But I didn\u2019t care because I had fun. It\ndidn\u2019t matter. I was learning how to ride the bicycle. I did it the hard way perhaps but I got it.\nAnd let\u2019s see what else. The, one of my girlfriends Hannah Weissenberg, she was my very best\nfriend. And she didn\u2019t live all that far away but not in our immediate area, so only time I could\nplay with her was either right after school or when my mother would take me over there and pick\nme up because we just didn\u2019t do that. And as I said before, there was another girl too that I only\nknow now the last name, Richar, was her name. And they went to Israel as far as I know. But I\ncouldn\u2019t be very sure. People left you know, some had left already. The moment in 1935 they\nwould leave and go. But my two girlfriends that I you know I had really close ties with they were\nin Germany as long as I was. Now there was another girlfriend that I had. Her father was very\northodox. Her name is Miana Shy. And she we found her again in the United States but that\nwas a very strange situation. I didn\u2019t even know she would be here. So but let me go, get back to\nthat later. While I was in school I learned English. However it was not the English that people in\nAmerica talk or in the Philippines. It was Oxford English. The eithers and the neithers and the\nlooking glass and all that sort of thing. Well when I left Germany and I went to another school,\nthe kids all made fun of me. Because I didn\u2019t speak like any of them. And they would snicker\nand laugh and like ridicule me. And I felt really bad about that because that\u2019s the only English I\ndid know. But anyway so in like, we can go back to the time we went and got the visa. My dad\nlike I said kind of saw the writing on the wall and he said we\u2019re now leaving. So in Germany you\nhardly bought any dresses ready-made. Everything had to be made. By material and the\ndressmakers and the dressmakers were a few blocks away of course. And so my mother had\nstarted putting things into suitcase because she knew we had to leave in October and this was\nnow around Rosh Hashanah. And during Rosh Hashanah somebody came in and told my parents\nyou'd better get out now. They\u2019re going to be closing the border to France which is Strasbourg.\nSo we rushed out of the temple, the middle of services, went home, started putting things into the\nsuitcases and then we had to call the government official to put a seal on it. Once it was sealed\nyou could not break the seal unless you were outside Germany. So I remember us rushing\nthrough and getting everything ready and which is what my parents did. Then the official came\nand then we had to leave with ten marks in our pocket.",
        "Q: Margie, why don\u2019t we go back just a little bit and why don\u2019t you tell me if there was anything\nthat was particularly Jewish about this Jewish German school that you were required to attend\nfor first grade on.",
        "A: Well the only thing is they did not teach Sunday school or Hebrew. So we had to go to the\ntemple for the lessons from the rabbi and the cantor. And we learned the different, we learned all\nabout the holidays and how to keep a kosher household and all that sort of thing. But basically all\nthey really went into the math which is actually German, math and a little bit of geography of\nGermany. But and the English lessons that I had over there because I knew that eventually\npeople were going to be you know going to different countries and they felt that we should learn\nEnglish. We did however, my Hebrew wasn\u2019t all that great. So my dad said that I have to have\nprivate lessons and Mr. Kamm, K-A-M-M. I remember his name. He gave me private lessons in\nHebrew. Well I became pretty good at it so when my dad would go out of town out of the\ncountry, I would have to do the Havdalah. And I must say it went very well because my mother\nsaid go ahead, do it, do it. And I enjoyed that. Because I was the focus point. I mean I was the\nhead of the household at that point. And let\u2019s see what else. It\u2019s very hard to remember all the\ndifferent things. But, oh yes. Hanukah. Was a wonderful time. And I had as I said before, a lot\nof Christian children around me and our house. Well I would go for Christmas always upstairs\nand see their tree and at midnight they would have all these candles and goodies on the tree. And\nI was like I said I was accepted and I would partake with their Christmas celebrations. Well I\ncame down and talked to my mother and father and I said you know we don\u2019t have anything like\nthat. Why don\u2019t we have a Hanukah bush or something like that. Well they didn\u2019t quite go along\nwith that idea. However, my father surprised us as playing Hanukah man. Instead of Santa Claus\nhe was Hanukah man. And he would knock on the door and of course I didn\u2019t know it was my\nfather at that time. And this man would come in with a very stern voice and would say have you\nbeen good this time and of course both my sister and I said, trembling we said of course, yes,\nyes, we\u2019ve been good children. And he said well ok in that case I guess you deserve a gift. And\nhe would have this pillowcase over his shoulder and that\u2019s how Santa Claus\u2019 way and he\u2019d\nimitate the Santa Claus cause I was impressed by that. And so he was a Hanukah man so he had\nto imitate more or less the Catholics how they, the Christians how they handled things which was\nkind of cute. And I only found out after I was a practically a teenager that was my father cause\nhe never was there and I couldn\u2019t figure out. I mean he was there a couple of minutes. I\u2019d go\nwhere did he go. And then the bell rings and I didn\u2019t put two and two together. So it was really\nneat. I really enjoyed that. And I think that\u2019s I\u2019m trying to remember. It is so, so much happened.",
        "Q: Did you wonder why you had to go to a Jewish school and the other children, the Gentiles\nwent to another school. Did your parents explain that to you?",
        "A: The same teachers taught my mother. And so naturally where the mother was taught I had to\ngo and that was how, I never questioned it. It just seemed a natural thing that Miss Stantur was\nmy mother\u2019s teacher and she was, became my teacher. And of course she always compared me\nto my mother. My mother must have been, I was very timid though. I really didn\u2019t do things that\nmost kids, I was very good. But sometimes you know maybe I was quite as good as my mother\nused to be. And she would tell my mother go to my mother and say, oh you know your daughter\ndid this and this and this. And I mean really I was my own person. I couldn\u2019t change me to my\nmother. My mother was very lenient. My father on the other hand, he was very strict. I mean if\nyou didn\u2019t throw the mark, I mean forget it. I mean he would, he was quick with the hand too.\nAnd my goodness whenever he hit, he had big hands. I mean the man was over 200 pounds and\nyeah, I was a little girl. You know and my mother would threaten us every time when he would\nbe out and she\u2019d say I\u2019m making notes. He will know all about what you\u2019re doing so when he\ncomes you will get punishment. And that was about it.",
        "Q: What was important to them? What do you think they wanted you to understand that their\nvalues were?",
        "A: To be a good Jew. I mean (no sound)",
        "Q: This is side two of the first tape of the interview with Margie Rosenthal. We were talking\nabout your parents values.",
        "A: My mother was very lenient and she would get upset with us and she would warn me\nespecially because I was the oldest that if I was not going to behave she was going to make notes\nand when dad would come back, then I would be punished. And that scared me enough that from\nthen on and I was a pretty good girl and we had a lot of fun. I mean I can\u2019t say that any of that\nwas bad. But my grandmother spoiled me. I didn\u2019t like, like for example on Friday afternoons\nfor midday was our big meal. And of course Shabbos was a big, big, big thing in our house so\nduring the noon hours we would have like maybe rice and cinnamon or something, a very light\nmeal. Well I didn\u2019t like that at all, so my grandmother would make me a soup, chicken soup and\nput some things in there so I would have something warm. And then came the evening. I didn\u2019t\nlike the beef because I don\u2019t care for boiled beef. I never did, I don\u2019t know. Well maybe\nnowadays I might but not really. So she would always have like a little squab or I should make\na something that I would like, special vegetables, special this, special that and my parents didn\u2019t\nreally approve of that because this is just spoiling her. And she said well she\u2019s my one and only\nand she, I love her. And my grandmother would, we were always doing things together. In fact\nour friends and relatives, everybody called us the bride and groom because we were always\ntogether. Like I said my grandma and I had a wonderful relationship and when I had to leave\nGermany and leave her behind, that was really one of the hardest things I had to do. I didn\u2019t\u2019\ncare so much about my aunt and uncle that were there who I loved dearly too but my\ngrandmother and I had a wonderful relationship. As a matter of fact, when my grandfather died,\nI moved into the room with her. So the two of us shared a room. And at night she would have\nsome chocolate and of course I had to have it. And none of the others did but I got it. So when I\nwould go like during vacation, during say Easter vacation, Passover vacation, I would go to a\ngirlfriend in Boyden, Germany. That was oh not that far away but it was far enough. For me\nevery distance was far actually. And I would stay there for a few weeks and I would have to buy\nher always the same chocolates that she loved which was a coffee liquor filled chocolate. And\nshe loved those so whenever I went to Boyden, I had a little money saved up. I would buy that\nfor her so I could bring it back to her. And she appreciated it so much. Well, that\u2019s the least I\ncould do for her goodness to me all the time. And, and then my cousin oh she was a little, she\nwould, she did things like let me tell you what she did. Like I told you, she ran away when we\nwere always having a we didn\u2019t have baby sitters in those days, so my auntie put her to bed. But\nnow let me tell you what happened at Passover. Just prior to Passover she was naughty so my\naunt locked her into a little room I mean off the kitchen. I mean not for long. But all of a sudden\nshe hears this crash bang and oh she\u2019s like what has she done now. So she opened up and my\ncousin Suzie had broken every egg that there was for Passover. She had just gotten so upset that\njust kind of stomped on them or threw them about. I don\u2019t really know what she did. But she\ndestroyed every egg. So my auntie had to start from scratch. And, oh go ahead.",
        "Q: You said something at the beginning of the interview about things changing in the area where\nyou lived in 1935 I think. As a child what filtered into your impressions of the changes that were\nhappening and how did you see your parents dealing with it and your, I don\u2019t\u2019 know if you\ngrandfather was dead then, but your grandmother.",
        "A: My well it didn\u2019t really, really come to my attention. However, my mother and my sister and I\nwould go to Katowice to visit my great, my grandparents in Poland. And one time when she\nwent and then came back she got a letter that you have to come to the police station, that you\nwere carrying contraband. And I said what in the world. I wouldn\u2019t carry anything that wasn\u2019t\nlegal. And apparently they had found a sausage that my mother had brought from Poland to\nGermany and that too wasn\u2019t allowed. And so they had a, I mean we were scared that they would\ntake her to a concentration camp or something, that you know going to really punish her and\nthank the, thanks be to God. Nothing really happened. She was able to explain that it was a gift\nfrom my in-laws and that it was just a gift and that she hadn\u2019t even bought it. With German\nmoney or whatever. And that she didn\u2019t\u2019 have any contraband. She had no money that belonged\nto Poland or anything. We knew better than that. So those are things that stuck in my mind that\nshe was so upset and the whole family was upset when that happened. But my girlfriends,\nnobody we didn\u2019t we didn\u2019t really have that big a problem with the stores or anything like that. it\nwas just the government took my father to work in the ditches and my dad was coming home\nvery, feeling not well. He was having pains. I guess kidney, already then problems. And for\nme, really nothing really, really happened that I could remember that was a difference.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything about Nazi propaganda on the radios for example. Anything\nabout book burnings say or newspapers and your parents talking about what was going on.",
        "A: No I think they tried to shield us from all that. No, I, I don\u2019t\u2019 ever remember them saying\nmuch of anything and we still had our Jewish doctor that we went to. And until the time we left\nthere was really no major problems. In fact one of my Christian girlfriends wanted to come to\nthe depot the railway station and my parents said better not. That\u2019s how close we all were. Cause\nthere was really, like I said, I myself did not feel it. And they kept it from us. They did not want\nto share because this was very disturbing and they didn\u2019t want to put us into that. My sister Eva,\nshe was a very timid person. She was shy and but she loved to eat. Oh boy did she love to eat.\nAnd whenever we would go, we would go visiting people like friends of ours and they would put\nout the coffee and the cake. For the children special little goodies. She would say oh, she\nwouldn\u2019t ask right out you know. And before we left, my mother always gave us something to\neat because she loved to eat. And I was a very poor eater as a matter of fact. And my, my food\nwas they had to put it on a chair with a little stool and they would put a lot of butter on it because\nI didn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t eating enough as far as they were concerned. So I hate the butter. So they\ndidn\u2019t\u2019, they didn\u2019t give me a knife or anything So they always knew where I sat because I\nwould take the butter off on the edge of the plate. And I would go around like that. so that\u2019s why\nI guess maybe my grandmother was spoiling me a little bit With the squab and all that stuff, veal\ncutlets and because I was a very poor eater. Now not my sister. We would go to these people\nand she had the full tummy. And we would go there and she would just look at my mother and\nshe said you know I haven\u2019t had that in a long time. And of course the people would feel so sorry\nfor her and they would say oh poor Eva. Sure, help yourself, take something. It was so\nembarrassing for my mother. She would get so red in the face. She would say like I don\u2019t feed\nher anything, but it wasn\u2019t true at all. She just had a very good appetite. And I was, going back\nto when I was saying, playing house with them you know. My little cousin I told you 1s this little\ndevious person. I mean she was just, I mean she was always into things. And all of a sudden my\nsister would start crying. I said why are you crying, Eva, what happened. Suzie. And I didn\u2019t see\nanything. She said but she did and my cousin was so sneaky, Suzie. She was so sneaky, she\nwould either drop something on the ground on the floor or pretend that she\u2019s picking it up. At the\nsame time she\u2019s pinching my foot or leg or something on my sister or behind my back. I think it\nwas really something. Keeping those two apart was a major, major problem. When I walked\nwith them, I had to keep one on the left and one on the right, I mean at arm\u2019s length. I couldn\u2019t\neven bring them together. But like I said my sister followed me everywhere. Well one time we\nwere a bunch of kids were playing. Down in the we had meadows, very pretty meadows near,\nnearby and oh like across the street and we lived in the newer portion of Gleiwitz. It was a lovely\nplace. And we stepped outside and then there was this big meadow on both sides. Beautiful. So\nkids are you know they take, I learned how to throw knife. Pocket knife. That\u2019s a boys\u2019 game but\nI played with everybody. Wasn\u2019t just girls, it was boys too. I was only maybe ten years old at\nthat time. So I said to Eva I said why don\u2019t\u2019 you run and get me a knife so I can play also. So\nshe runs up the hill and she comes back. While she\u2019s running down, she falls and she cuts\nherself. Oh my goodness. Here she is bleeding. I think that she\u2019s dying because she\u2019s crying like\nyou know there\u2019s no tomorrow. And of course again I had to take her home and again my\ngrandmother said not her. I mean we should have covered in something so she wouldn\u2019t fall\nbecause she was carrying it and running. But she was trying to do me a favor, the, my little sister\nso like I said it was of her I was in trouble more than for my own sake. But hey, that\u2019s all right. I\nmean she was five years younger than I was. I mean after all I was a big sister you know. I had to\nreally do whatever I was supposed to do. But sometimes I\u2019d forget it and did what I, what any\nyoung kid would do. But it matured me. I\u2019d say that much it did. And where, I don\u2019t know now\nwhere.",
        "Q: I was going to ask you how your parents decided on where you were going to emigrate. You\nmentioned the family in Michigan in fact sponsoring you. But of course you didn\u2019t end up in\nMichigan. So why don\u2019t you tell me what you remember about the circumstances of the choice\nbeing made to go to the Philippines and how the other people around you, your family, the\nJewish community reacted when you told them what you planned to do",
        "A: My father as you know was in the lumber business. And when he asked, you know he asked\naround and nobody knew what to do. So when he went to the consulate, American Consulate he\nasked where could I go and practice my profession. They said well I don\u2019t\u2019 know but why don\u2019t\nyou try the Philippines. It\u2019s not a bad place. Why don\u2019t\u2019 you go there and then from there you\ncan come to the states. So with that in mind, jungles and all this when I heard jungles, oh boy\nmy mind went wild. I thought oh boy I could play with the monkeys. I could play with the lions.\nI could play with all, I was animal lover from way back. As a matter of fact, I used to walk a dog\njust to, to be near a dog. I loved animals from way when I was a little girl. And the woman\nwould be happy to give me her dog, the big German shepherd and I would play, but that was my\nprotection and nobody could come near me. So when they said jungle I was all enthused. I\nthought jungle, great. You know I\u2019Il be having the beach right there and then I walk a few feet\nand I\u2019d be living on the outskirts of the jungle. And my dad would go into the jungle. Maybe he\ncould bring me back a wild animal or something like that. Well it didn\u2019t quite turn out that way,\nbut I didn\u2019t know that. We didn\u2019t even know where the Philippines was. All I knew was that you\nhad to go over the ocean and that you had to take a ship and so my parents tried to I guess maybe\nmake it nicer than it really would have been. And I don\u2019t think they really had much of an idea\neither. All, All my dad knew he might have a good job over there.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you tell me. I don\u2019t think we discussed this. What kind of work exactly your father\ndid. In the lumber industry.",
        "A: My dad would go into the woods, into the forest and estimate the footage of the trees to be\ncut. He had a wonderful mind. He never used to calculate it for anything. He could just but he\ndidn\u2019t need a calculator. His mind worked so well that all he looked at a tree and he estimated\nand my goodness and that was how it was. I mean he was, he had a fabulous mind. And he knew\nthat if he went into the Philippines he would go into the jungle, would go in and cut some, tell\nthem how to cut the trees and how much footage you\u2019d get out of it. And with that in mind he\ndecided we\u2019 ll go to the Philippines and so there we would wait for our visa to the States and that\nwould be wonderful. Didn\u2019t quite happen.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything or do you have a strong memory of what it was like when your\nfather lost his job with the lumber company. What did you understand about why that happened.",
        "A: My parents wouldn\u2019t tell us. Didn\u2019t tell me at all. All they said, I guess they were afraid that\nif I made a remark to one of my Christian friends, they all had to somehow belong to the Nazi\nparty or you know things like that, because in those days, when a boy reached a certain age, or a\ngirl for that matter, they had to join the Junge, Jungefrau and, and it was like a Boy Scouts.\nHowever, you\u2019ve seen them in the movies and they had to join. And it really could have been\nvery, very hard on my parents if I said something so they really didn\u2019t want to confide in us too\nmuch because if I, 1f any of us would have said something wrong that when we mentioned the\nfact that we were going to the Philippines, everybody said you\u2019re crazy. Why the Philippines.\nWait here til your visa comes. What\u2019s your rush. And my father said well I don\u2019t like the way\nthings are going. Stores are already a little bit discriminating and I found that all out afterwards.\nNothing was told to us at that point. But people all thought that he was out of his mind. So my\naunt, my uncle, the whole family stayed behind. My grandmother didn\u2019t want to leave because\nshe had a pension from her husband being a locomotive engineer. So she said why should I give\nup everything to go into a country that we know nothing about. I mean if yeah, could I would\nsay I go straight to the United States that\u2019s one thing. But to go into a country. They did say\ntropics. They did say don\u2019t bring any warm clothing. Just get light clothing. So the dresses and\nall that was what we had was just light clothing. And they said that we could take a bicycle. But\nthen we didn\u2019t know also what to pack. My mother had visions of maybe she couldn\u2019t get any\nsoap so she brought boxes of the, like you have here Tide and all that sort of thing. And she took\nthat along. And my dad was in those days we had a very musical family. My dad played the\nviolin. My mother played the piano and my aunt Ruth sang. So we always had a trio but I didn\u2019t\nget to do any of that. So when we talked about leaving, 1t was oh why, why, what is your rush\nyou know. Stay, a little longer. And so my dad said no. And he booked passage on a French\nsteamer. That meant we had to go through France and but when they told us remember when we\nwere in the temple and told us that we had to leave right then and there. We had the suitcases\nsealed and we said our goodbyes and we took off.",
        "Q: Was it the American embassy that suggested that you go to the Philippines as the sort of\ninterim place to be on your way to the United States.",
        "A: Yes it was because we went, we had an affidavit. However before we could even get the visa\nto the Philippines we had to put down like $500. That was a lot of money in those days. And that\nshould see us through whatever comes in the next year or so that we would not be a burden to\nanybody. No other government. And with that we were able to get the visa to go to the\nPhilippines. And that was how we finally got that and then we left on a train and went over\nStrasbourg. And my mother started to cry and I thought you know that she\u2019s just upset because\nshe left her family there. And which was very traumatic for her. Because her sister and her were\njust very close. They were just a couple of years apart. And so and my grandmother of course.\nSo then we got past the as we get to Strasbourg, the German government, the officials come up\nand they said let\u2019s open your suitcases. We want to see what you have in there and so my mother\nopened up the suitcase. They broke the seal rather and then she opened up and they kind of went\nthrough it. And then they said everything is ok and close up again and go on. And this was the\nsame train that left our home, town of Gleiwitz. It was going all the way to Paris. Well after we\npassed into France my mother was very hysterical by this time. So I asked her, I said if you\u2019re\nmissing your sister so much, I can be your sister. I\u2019m old enough. I\u2019m 11 years old. And that\nmade her cry even more. But then she told me that while they were sealing and she had\nforgotten to take the money out for the dresses. And those German marks in the clothing. And if\nthey had caught her, she would have been in jail and they would have thrown away the key. I\nmean that was going against every, everything so they just the customs was very strict in those\ndays anyway. Especially the Germans. Only let you take ten marks. Well we\u2019re supposed to\nlive with ten marks, that\u2019s 40 marks the four of us for this was in the early part of September and\nour ship didn\u2019t leave until about, I think almost like three weeks later. So we went, the first time\nwe came into Paris when we got to Paris, the cab driver took us, we said yes take us to a hotel.\nHe drove around and around and around. That was number one. Charged an exorbitant amount.\nThen he took us to this hotel. It was $50, dollars, 50 marks, whatever the currency to francs a\nday. Well that depleted the money that we were able to take from Germany. Thank god for the\nfew dollars. Well pretty soon that money ran out too. And we had to eat and of course we only\nstayed in the hotel one day. We went to another building that about 3 or 4 stories up. And they\ndidn\u2019t even have a toilet up there. All you had to do in France. On each floor they had one, one\nof those things where you kind of squat on a hole. And the only toilet we had was on the ground\nfloor. Well we had never seen anything like this or had even been close to something like that.\nSo it was, that part was really very traumatic for us. How, not to have a toilet. I mean that was\nunheard of in Germany. Anyway so here we were now without money. And we didn\u2019t want to\nbe burdened with the Jewish HIAS or whoever Joint, whoever was there. So my mother\nsomehow made mention in a letter to my grandmother. So she said go to this insane asylum.\nThere is the son of a friend of mine which, the mother always sends money to him. And he will\ngive you the money and I in turn will give her the money in Germany. And that\u2019s what we did\nbut let me tell you. Going to the insane asylum was a horrible feeling. All these people that were\neither crying or singing and pretending to holding a baby and some came up to us and pulling us\nand didn\u2019t\u2019 want us to go and it was just that part was really very bothersome. Then we talked to\nthe man. He sounded as normal as anybody else. As you and I. well the reason he was in the\ninsane asylum was because he had taken a dip in the river Seine and he was naked. It was\nevening and he didn\u2019t think anybody would see him. Well lo and behold, they got him and they\nsaid anybody that does that has to go to the insane asylum. So that was where we got our money.\nAnd then we were in Paris for about ten days I would say. And but we didn\u2019t go and eat all the\ntime. I mean there was no way for us to go and eat. We couldn\u2019t afford it. so we\u2019d buy the bread\nand get some cheese and we\u2019d eat upstairs in the room or whatever we rented.",
        "Q: Were you around other people, other Jews who were in the process of leaving Europe and\nhow did your family find this rooming house. And were there other people staying there who\nwere doing something similar to what you were doing.",
        "A: No, these were French Jewish people that we met when we went to buy the bread. This\nhappened to be a Jewish bakery or she just worked there. I really don\u2019t know. AII I know is that\nmy parents went to talk and she spoke German and so that kind of made a bond but the woman\nof course never offered us any money. And then we asked where could we have a good dinner\nor lunch or something but we\u2019d like a kosher restaurant. So she told us where to go for a kosher\nrestaurant. Other times we, it was a treat for us to go like a cafeteria type thing, where you helped\nyourself and you could take your milk or whatever and for us that was something new. We\nnever had anything like that in Germany. SO we stood there like we didn\u2019t know what to do. So\nthe French people came up to us and we didn\u2019t speak French of course which was another\nhardship, so we had to find always somebody that might be able with motions and things like\nthat and I do remember one time though we had gone on a subway. We were going to go\nsomeplace and my father said we\u2019re getting off at the next stop. Well I was the first one at the\ndoor and I jumped out and I look around. As I\u2019m looking the doors are closing and my parents\nare on the subway still. Well here\u2019s this 11 year old kid, doesn\u2019t know any word of French.\nDoesn\u2019t know where she exactly is but I thought well if I go up the stairs and walk backwards,\nback over towards the other station but of course I didn\u2019t know which was way but I kind of had\na hunch. So I was pretty good with locations. So I started walking and I see my mother and my\nfather. My mother was crying. Oh thank God we found you. Thank God we got you back. I said\nwhat\u2019s the big deal. I knew I had to walk towards the station. Yeah but how did you know. I said\nwhat, I don\u2019t know, I just knew it. But anyway so that was quite an ordeal for everybody\nbecause they thought they\u2019d lost me and I thought I\u2019d lost them. What would I do? but as it\nturned out it was fine. So you see, I\u2019m a survivor. From way back. Go ahead.",
        "Q: Which if your parents do you think you learned your survival skills from or your grandparents\ntoo I guess?",
        "A: I think my dad. My dad had this he had really special qualities and whenever we would talk\nand we\u2019d get a few times you know when he could sit down and talk to us, I think he was the\nmost important influence on my maturing that quickly and also being having his ideas and things\nlike that. But I don\u2019t know whether it was really all of him. It might be my grandparents too I\nwould say. My grandmother was a very self-sufficient woman. And she did all the how shall I\nsay she did all the planning and everything else. She was the matron. And she whatever she said\neverybody did. She was avery wise woman also. But I\u2019m sorry to say she wasn\u2019t wise enough\nto leave with us. Which I had hoped she might do. But anyways so here we are now in France\nand the time has come for us to go to Marseilles where the ship 1s. Well while we were in France\nthere were no other refugees like ourselves that we had met or seen or anything. We couldn\u2019t\u2019\neven go like I said we, Yom Kippur. We spent Yom Kippur in Paris. But we couldn\u2019t\u2019 even get\nto a temple for some reason. Then I don\u2019t know why. That part I don\u2019t remember. But anyway\neverything was kind of a new, new thing to me so we took the train and went to Marseilles. We\nchecked into somebody must have told us which hotel to check into and we had to wait three\ndays for our vessel, ship to come and was the President Dorme. While we were in Marseilles,\nwe met this young, very young couple. They had just gotten married before they left Germany all\nby themselves. So this lady looked up to my mother as her mother. And she asked my mother a\nlot of questions. How do you do this and what do you do with this. So my mother has kind of\nreared her you might say because she was so lost the poor thing. She had, she didn\u2019t know\nanything and her name was Margot Friedlander. And his name was Heinrich Friedlander. Well\nanyway so we get finally, the ship arrives. And it was a great big passenger ship. Of course to us\nkids who had never seen a steamer, never seen anything. We come from a very small town, as I\nmentioned. And oh in Paris, I saw my first black people. I had never seen anybody but white\npeople because there were, we were too far away from everything. But in Marseilles there were\na number of other nationalities . And when we finally got on board the ship, we realized oh there\nare more children. There was one was Margot Kassel and Biata Zuskind and Biata was a\nsmaller child. And my sister was going to have a birthday on that trip. It would have been\nOctober the 19\". All right. so my mother bought a cake for her at one of the bakeries in\nMarseille and very, didn\u2019t show it to my sister, cause it was only next port would be Port Said.\nAnd her birthday was on the day of Port Said. That we arrived in Port Said. Well I think that\u2019s\nthree days away, board the ship the 16\". And while going down the gangplank into Port Said, all\nthese beggars\n(end file 1)\n(file 2 \u2014 RG-50.106.0052.02.03 \u2014 duration: 01:03:21)",
        "Q: This is the taped interview made for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. The\ninterview is with Margie Rosenthal. I\u2019m the interviewer Nancy Alper. It\u2019s October 24\" 1996.\nThis is the second tape, side A. Now Margie we were talking about your mother\u2019s attempts to\nhave a birthday celebration on board the ship on the way to Hong Kong for your sister Eva.",
        "A: Well my sister being very generous at all times, my mother presented her the cake on board\nand we were going to have it for dessert. Well we come across this beggar on the street. My\nsister turns around, runs back up onto board. We didn\u2019t know why she was running back and we\ncalled her and she was already up the gangplank and already gone, comes back with the cake.\nShe\u2019s giving it to the beggar. And my mother just having fits. She just said this was your cake\nEva, what are you giving away? That poor man has nothing to eat. So my mother, what did she\ndo. She took some money. Gave the money to the beggar and took the cake back which we had\nafter all. But that\u2019s how Eva is. She will take off her shirt and give it to you. Very, very soft\nhearted person. Anyway so on board ship we met a lot of other refugees. Like I said Margot\nKassel was my sister\u2019s age and Bi, Biata Zuskind she was a younger, she was about maybe\nthree years old at that time, two or three years old. And things were pretty good but I don\u2019t like,\nI didn\u2019t know any French food. And for me to start eating French food when I\u2019m used to the\nregular kosher German kitchen, you know was quite a change. So I said and I did say something\nto my dad. I don\u2019t remember exactly what, but he said my reply was well I\u2019m going to write to\nmy grandmother because she will have to know how I am treated on here. You are treating me\nnot well at all. I told my dad. Uh oh. That was the wrong thing to say, of course. So he said you\njust dare do that. Make a heart more heavy than she already has. I mean the poor woman has just\nlost a daughter, her granddaughter, granddaughters and now you want to write a letter and tell\nher how miserable things are here. You better not. Well he was right. Of course, I didn\u2019t but\nneedless to say I would never have hurt my grandmother in any, any kind of a way. so I had to\nadjust to the food. But you know I missed my tomatoes. Oh I love tomatoes and pickles and\nthings like that. So there was one gentleman that was in the, working in the kitchen and I\nmentioned it to him. They all spoke some German. And I told him that I really missed having a\nfresh tomato. Guess what. At dinner he brought me a fresh tomato. That was the best meal I can\nremember. And every meal we had wine as well but of course children never drank the wine but\nthe food was so different than what I had known that it took quite an adjustment and then we\nwent from Port Said, we went over to Porti. Oh, Suez Canal. Let me not forget the Suez Canal\nwhich was a very exciting experience. You could see across the bank and you could see\nbuildings. I mean buildings, I would say more like pyramids. And you see the Arabs and I mean\nit was so close. It was just a very thrilling experience and dad said you\u2019d better remember this\nvery well. This may be your last time you\u2019re going to go through Suez Canal. This is something\nthat is very, very important for you to know. So we really stayed on board and looked at\neverything. And then we came to Djibouti and somebody wanted to buy my sister from my\nmother. They said oh she is so cute. My sister had blond hair, blue eyes and curly hair. I mean\nshe was very adorable. And they, the woman wouldn\u2019t give up. She wanted to buy my sister. My\nsister said no, she\u2019s not for sale. And then so then we were afraid that she was going to take her\nSO we were always around her. I mean it was like until we left, you know we had to watch her\nevery second because we really thought that she might kidnap her or something. And then we\nwent to Singapore. Singapore was just beautiful. It was absolutely lovely. But hot. It was so hot\nand we just came from Germany and we are in autumn already in Europe. And we come over\nthere and it was, I mean we were not used to the heat. Of course. But anyway we did take a walk\nand strolled in a little bit on the pier and then it was too much. And we had to turn back to the\nship. So we never really got to see Singapore. And then from there my next recollection was\ngetting to Saigon. Now Saigon my dad bought himself a beautiful one of those tropical helmet\ntype things and he looked really chic and he wore that on deck all the time. But in Saigon we\nstayed there two days. We had French legionnaires on board. And these poor guys didn\u2019t have\nwine or anything so the men at our table took the wine from our table and took it over there to\nthese guys. And they were so happy to have something that like wine for the French. You know\nhow that, it is. So they were so happy. But before I even get that far. Let me say something else.\nFor days, there were, the people, the officers on the ship said \u201cKeep an eye on the back of the\nship. We have a line out. We hope to catch a whale.\u201d Oh boy. With us kids, we were always\nchecking the line that was hanging out of the back of the ship. And we\u2019d see it trailing you know.\nBut nothing is happening, nothing is happening. One day finally there was a big thing, intercom\nand attention, attention. We caught whale. I want most, everybody on board, children first. Let\nthem see the whale. Before we cut the whale open. So oh boy. I mean we were in the lounge as\na matter of fact, in the ladies lounge, washing our hands and everything else. And we run upstairs\nto the deck where the line was. And there was this long fish, dripping water still, black fish, very\nimpressive, big huge thing. And they said well now all the girls, all the kids are here. There\nweren\u2019t that many children on board because this was a luxury liner really and was dropping off\nthe legionnaires to Saigon. And so it was very, very exciting. So we all rushed up there and were\nstanding with bated breath. Now they\u2019re going to cut the fish open, going to see what\u2019s inside the\nfish. And the captain come out and has this big knife and he cuts it open. And you know what\nfalls out. Candies. Oh it was, we had crossed I guess the dateline. I am not sure what exactly\nwhat happened. But it was so thrilling. All these candies fell out and they were green and\ndifferent colors, mainly green that represent the eggs I guess in the whale or whatever. I don\u2019t\nknow. But it was so funny. And, oh he said take all the candy you want. Of course, we kids,\ncandy. We all grabbed hands full and then of course there were other passengers took it too.\nSo this is one of my very memorable experiences we had on the ship. Other than that I mean that\nwas really nothing much happening.",
        "Q: I think you had told me that your parents had pre-paid for the entire trip while you were still\nin Germany. It was a kind of package. Why don\u2019t you tell me a little bit about that and how if\nyou know anything, how they knew how to go about doing that. And another question was how\nmany immigrants and refugees there were on the ship. From other countries besides France and\ndoing something similar to what you were doing.",
        "A: No the only people were from Germany and they were the only refugees. And like I said there\nwas only this one young family. And this one family with the daughter Margot and the one with\nZuskind. That was the other one. That I believe was all there was on the ship, as far as Jewish.\nAnd the other ones, I don\u2019t, there were French people going to Singapore, Saigon, really not a\nwhole lot of people but we only knew about ours. And I did not mention this but the men slept\nseparately from the women. So we had in our cabin was this young woman that was just\nmarried, my mother and my sister and I, four of us. And in dad\u2019s cabin there were also four men.\nSo they had for some reason, I don\u2019t know. I guess they didn\u2019t have the facilities to\naccommodate us because we were the refugees but we did pay for the passage already in\nGermany. And I believe the HIAS was helping us. But I\u2019m not quite sure. I never did question\nthem how, when and where and what. All I know is that we had the money that we had to put\ndown in Breslau to the American consulate and vouch that we would never be a burden to any\ngovernment.",
        "Q: Also I wanted to ask you, did you have a German passport. Do you remember that? When\nyou left Germany.",
        "A: We did and it all over Juden ok. And by that time we were stateless. We did not have any\nmore a home, so we were considered stateless. And in Singapore, my sister and were always on\ndeck looking around and you know kids, there was nothing more for us to do really. There were\nno movies. If there were, they would have been in French. We would never have understood\nanyways, so us children kind of had to devise our own games and _ talk and do things like that. So\nI was looking into the hold of the ship, I see that our box that we had our furniture in, our\nfurniture. I would say like bicycle and soap that my mother was bringing along and things like\nthat. Oh, the few goblets of crystal. I mean painstakingly wrapped. It was a big wooden box,\nthey called them lifts in those days. And that had broken open. And with all of those natives\nthere, I was so afraid they were going to take it all and we wouldn\u2019t have anything left when we\ngot to the Philippines. So I told my sister, I said you watch while I go run and find dad so he can\nget ahold of the captain to make sure that they get it covered up again. Or nail it together,\nwhatever it takes. Cause I don\u2019t\u2019 want to lose all our stuff. So she was standing on top there\nlooking down. And I found my father pretty soon. And I said come quick, come quick. Look\nwhat\u2019s happened. So he ran and got the captain and they went down in the hold and they were\nable to get our stuff together. But that is how we reached the Philippines. The soap had spilled\nout onto the bicycle. The bicycle had rusted away. So by that time we really didn\u2019t have a\nbicycle. We didn\u2019t\u2019 have much of soap. I mean a lot of stuff was ruined regardless you know.\nBut anyways so that was in Saigon. And on the way from Saigon to Hong Kong came the\ntyphoon. Everybody was sick. Everybody was sick. We couldn\u2019t go to the dining room. And oh\nmy dad\u2019s hat flew away that he just so painstakingly bought in Saigon. Went overboard and it\nwas gone. He was more upset about that than I think anything else because it was such a nice\nhelmet type thing that they wore in the Orient you know. Anyway so we were too sick to eat.\nBut my dad was at the table, eating. I mean we could never understand how could you eat. We\nwere so sick that the doctor had to give us medications because we couldn\u2019t hold food down and\nwe couldn\u2019t eat. I mean it was horrible and I mean, all the passengers were sick. Except my dad\nand this young guy that had just gotten married. The two of them had the whole dining room to\nthemselves. And they had all the food they wanted. And they had to put the plates into containers\nwhich were bolted to the tables. Otherwise they would be sliding this way and sliding that way.\nBut we finally made it into Kowloon which is Hong Kong China. But we had to stay in Kowloon\nbecause that\u2019s where the ship docked. Now we needed shots in Kowloon because we didn\u2019t get\nthe malaria and, and that, whatever the tropical diseases were. So we had to go to this Chinese\ndoctor who had an office in this building. The staircase was so narrow and so dark that we could\nhardly see where we were going. Well my imagination was oh my god he\u2019s going to abduct us\nand we\u2019re not going to go get anywhere and we\u2019re going to be sold as slaves or something like\nthat. Like I said I had a very vivid imagination. And we made it up the stairs. Got our shots,\ncame back down and we were all kind of (sniffs) like this you know. We were kind of crying\ncause it was hurting. And my dad said all right, I had a, I couldn\u2019t take my big doll from\nGermany but I was able to take the smaller version. And I loved that doll. Of course I had to\nname her Suzie also, naturally because I left my Suzie one in Germany so this was also Suzie. So\nhe said how about we buy Suzie a dress. Well that was a big deal so I went with him to, with my\nparents into this beautiful store that had all embroidered things. And I said I showed them the\ndoll and they said we\u2019ve got the thing for you. They gave me this beautiful dress for my doll. Oh\nit was absolutely gorgeous. All kinds of embroidery and all it was so pretty. So now I had a\ndress. And we stayed in a very pretty hotel in Hong Kong and the food, I guess I had gotten used\nto eating almost anything because if you\u2019re hungry you\u2019|l have to eat. And so I did eat French.\nNow I was going to experience Chinese food. Which was again something different, but noodles\nI liked so that was ok. We ate a lot of noodles. And we did take a trip also over to Hong Kong\nwhich is by ferry boat which was kind of exciting for us as well. So we were a few days in, I\ncan\u2019t remember exactly the how many days we were in Hong Kong. But then we were on our\nway to the Philippines on a not with a passenger ship which I thought we would have. No. We\nhad to leave the ship and go on a freighter, a small freighter and there we were all in one cabin\ntogether. But my dad always liked to have the round window, the portholes opened because he\nliked it. So while dad was there and he had his mouth open one of us kids, I guess probably it\nwas me, took a raisin and threw it in his mouth and he thought it was a fly. And he started\ncoughing and screaming and yelling. I swallowed a fly, I swallowed a fly. But then we\nlaughed and he says what happened. What did you guys do. And you know how kids do pranks\nlike that. So we told him, it was only a raisin. Well the next day he was sleeping again, the\nwindow open again. This time a big wave came and he thought we\u2019re drowning. He\u2019s\nscreaming we\u2019re drowning, we\u2019re drowning. Why don\u2019t we all jump. You know he thought for\nsure we were drowning. As it was, a wave had come into the cabin on top of him. And all he\ncould he was breathing. I mean he had been sleeping and all of a sudden he was like d, you know\nbeing drenched with this ocean water. And so that was another experience that we won\u2019t forget,\nbecause he thought for sure we were drowning. Well anyway we make it finally to Manila and\nwe",
        "Q: How long did the trip take all together?",
        "A: Hmm. Mmm. Ok we left Marseilles around the, I would say the 16\" yeah, 16\" of October and\nwe did not get the, between all that, we did not get to Manila til the 16\", no, 14 of November. I\ndid forget to mention something and now it came at just now I had a loss of memory again but\nit'll get back to me, ok. And we were met at the docks by the Jewish committee and they took us\nto a hotel in the walled city. The walled city is called Intramuros and that is a very old. That\nwas because of the Spaniards and the Spanish were occupying Manila. That was a fortress and\nso this time you know it was very exciting to be living in something like that and, but they\nwarned us don\u2019t leave any food out. Because of the rats that go around these old buildings. Oh\nmy gosh. Now we are afraid of rats as well. I mean I love animals, but I don\u2019t\u2019 think Id like rats.\nSo we would take food upstairs but have to wrap it in linen napkin, very well. And they still got\nto it. So we still all the food we brought upstairs was eaten you know nibbled on during the night\nby these stupid rats. And we only stayed there like 3 days. And then the Jewish committee said\nwe'll give, tell you where you can go and rent something. So we rented the upstairs of a house.\nDownstairs was a Filipino dentist. And upstairs was for us refugees. My parents, other people I\ndon\u2019t even remember their names very well but every room was occupied by a different family.\nAnd one, then we had a single bachelor and he had to sleep outside on the sofa because we just\nran out of room. And this man gets up the next morning and he says he yelled at us. He says you\nkids are playing tricks on me again. Apparently somebody played a trick on him on one of the\nships where he came from. And we don\u2019t know which ship he came on because there were quite\na few refugees at that time, already. Anyhow so he accused us of taking his pants and hiding\nthem. Well we didn\u2019t do that. so everybody started looking for his pants because he said, how I\ncan\u2019t even get out of bed you know. So finally somebody looked down. AII the windows in the\nPhilippines had bars by the way because a lot of robberies took place. So we looked down and\nsure enough on the ground were his pants. And so we kids went and got them. And how in the\nworld did they do that. We asked the dentist downstairs. Oh he said easy. They are on a tree,\nwhich is a ways away but same level as your upstairs, up, apartment is and he said they just take\na fishhook, fish line, hook the pants bring them out, take the money and leave the pants. That\u2019s\nexactly what they did. They took all of his money. They took his papers and everything else but\nthey left his pants. So that was our one experience.",
        "Q: You had mentioned being excited about going to the jungle. And I was wondering what your\nearliest impressions were of what the Philippines were like compared to what you had been\nthinking it was going to be like and how it compared to your experience in Germany.",
        "A: A far cry from Germany, a very far cry. There were palm trees, all right with coconuts on\nthem. And the Filipinos would climb up the tree and throw down the coconuts for us. And we\ncould crack them open, but first they had a green hull around them which had to be stripped, but\nthey all carried knives, bolos, you know. And so like hatchet, big hatchet things. Oh very vicious\nlooking deals. And that\u2019s what they used to do. But I could not see any jungle. I mean these were\npaved streets. These were houses. And I thought well maybe when we move further in, you\nknow away from the city area, I might find the jungle. Well it didn\u2019t quite happen that way. We\nonly stayed in there one month because that was no place for us, when they can hook something\nand take things out of there. That was not for us. So then again we have asked the Jewish\ncommittee, where we could go and where we could live. So they said well there is a house. [Il\nshow you but you have to share it with another family. Well no problem, I mean, that\u2019s fine. So\nwe met the Kostenits family, a husband, wife and one daughter. The daughter was just a couple\nof years older than I was. And so that was a beautiful complex. It was, it belonged to I think a\nmayor, Resal. His last name was Resal. I don\u2019t remember his first name. But there are a lot of\nResals over there. There are lot, it\u2019s a very popular name. And this house was very beautiful. It\nhad, downstairs was a hall. Cause it was like a dance hall. Oh it was huge. And then you went\nup the stairs and upstairs were the living quarters \u2014 the kitchen, three bedrooms. One was\noccupied by my parents. One was occupied by the girl, Eva. Kostenits parents. And the other\nroom was for us three girls. And it also had a very long veranda out front. The length of the\nhouse. Of course, also it had bars. Downstairs, upstairs and so forth. The only bar that wasn\u2019t on\nwas in the kitchen because they felt I guess there wasn\u2019t much to steal in the kitchen. So anyway\nSO we moved in with what we had, not a whole lot because like I said the bicycle was already\nruined from the ocean water and everything else so I don\u2019t know. My dad wasn\u2019t able to clean it\nup. There was just no way of rescuing it. My mother\u2019s soap became like soap suds. There was\nhardly anything left of that. But we did have a few clothes that we had brought along and we\nwere able to use them. But since we knew that this was going to be temporary because it was for\ntwo people, we wanted something for ourselves and they wanted something for themselves as\nwell. But what happened is which made us move even faster, was we were sleeping one night\nand I was awoken by a man putting his arms around my neck and putting his face next to me.\nAnd I woke up and I yelled. A boy wants to kiss me. I like I said my imagination, I have very\nvivid imagination. At this time, by that time I was 12 years old. My birthday was in July and you\nknow time passes on. so this was July and I was 12. And but back to this robber. He was taking\na check on what I was wearing and he had been already to somebody else. I don\u2019t remember\nnow. It was my sister or the other gal. both were named Eva so I didn\u2019t know. And so this lady\nnext door in the bedroom said oh go to sleep you had a, you had a dream. You just, go back to\nsleep, go back to sleep. I said no he\u2019s creeping out now. He\u2019s leaving. He\u2019s leaving. Catch him,\nsomebody stop him. You know. And so my parents, by my voice could tell immediately that\nsomething was wrong. So my mom got up and of course she saw the window to the kitchen wide\nopen. The door to the, from the kitchen going down was wide open, things scattered all over the\nplace. And my dad had a very bad habit, of taking his rings off at night. Wedding ring and all.\nWell that was gone. The wedding ring was gone. The watch was gone and that he was very\nupset about. And then we had some eau de cologne that we had brought from Germany. It had a\ngold cap on it, sort of gold metal thing. They took that. They thought that was the real thing. So\nwhat over a period of time, I mean this is how we lost some things. You know robberies. So he\ntook quite a few things with him. He took we had brought coral necklaces, my sister and I. Those\nhe took. Oh a few odds and ends, I mean. At this time I don\u2019t\u2019 even remember what all the man\ndid take, but he was so deft at it that he had gone to this one, and nobody, he was in my parents\u2019\nroom and they didn\u2019t even feel his presence or hear him or that is so very quiet. If he hadn\u2019t\ntouched me I might not have woke up. But he made the mistake of touching me. With that I\nwoke up. And they said had he had I worn earrings he would have probably been able to take\nthem out. I would not have felt it. And the necklace the same thing. He, they do it in one, one\ngrab, feeling for necklace and earrings. And being I\u2019m a light sleeper, that he was able to take it.\nNot, I mean not get to it. Then we called, I guess I didn\u2019t call, we didn\u2019t call the police. We had\nno phone of course. Somebody heard us and commotion and so the people next door that lived\nthere came over and asked what went on and we told them. And so I see this Filipino man\ncoming up the stairs and I\u2019m yelling. I said \u201cthat\u2019s him, that\u2019s him\u201d. At night it you know this is\nnight time we\u2019re talking about. He had on white t-shirt and white shorts. So did this man that was\ncreeping out of the room that had touched me and he too had. So I said \u201cthat\u2019s him, that\u2019s him\u201d.\nAnd they kept saying \u201cno, no, no. No, he\u2019s our houseboy.\u201d I said \u201cthat\u2019s the man, I saw him.\u201d\nBut of course it wasn\u2019t him. But I was so hysterical at that point that, and then of course I was\nafraid to sleep. They had to look under the beds, they had to look everywhere before I would\neven go to bed. I mean I was just so afraid of everything. By then and to this day, I am still. I\nmean this wasn\u2019t the only robbery. I'll get to that later. But to this very day I don\u2019t trust\nanybody. When I had a dog in America, I was fine. We lost our dog. Now I have ADT which 1s\na security system installed. And my husband can\u2019t understand it. He\u2019s from Shanghai. But me, I\nam from the Philippines. And we had so many robberies that I am paranoid about things like\nthat. Anyway, so that was one of the experiences with the robbery. The very first one. Then\nthese people moved out and they moved across to the next house. And then we took another\nfamily in because nobody could afford to pay that kind of rent and my dad still didn\u2019t have a job.\nSo they kept saying \u201cyou'll find one. Don\u2019t worry, you'll find one.\u201d But I went, enrolled as we\nhad to go to school of course. I mean we can\u2019t do without school. So my parents enrolled us into\na parochial school run by the German nuns. They figured because German nuns would be helpful\nin learning, then we could learn to speak English better than we did. So they put me into fourth\ngrade and my sister was very young so she went into first grade. Well, after a while they realized\nthat I\u2019m not, I\u2019m too far ahead because I you know I had already been in the fifth grade in\nGermany. So they put me into fourth first and then they put me into fifth. So that\u2019s what it was.\nInto fourth grade first and then into the fifth. Then before I knew it we were kicked out of school.\nMy mother was called. Come to school. We want to talk to all the parents were called one by\none. And the head, the Mother Superior said to my family, my mother, sorry you have to take\nyour children out. My mother said, why. Well because you\u2019re Jewish. My mother said because\nwe\u2019re Jewish. We just left Germany bruise we were Jewish. Well, we\u2019re being persecuted here\ntoo. Why?",
        "Q: This is side 2, Side B of the second tape, the interview with Margie Rosenthal for the United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum, by Nancy Alper. The date is October 24, 1996. And\nMargie you and I before I turned the machine on were just talking about your hearing on board\nship, on your way to Manila, about the happening of Kristallnacht in Germany.",
        "A: We heard that the temples had been burned and that there was a big closings of the stores of\nthe Jewish merchants and that must have come in over the radio to the operator on board ship.\nAnd he passed it along to the refugees that were on board. So we knew how close my dad had\ngotten to not even getting us out of Germany. And that was a very fortunate thing for us that we\nmade it out before all this took place. Oh, they were arresting all the Jewish people but the men\nespecially the men. And taking them to concentration camps. And my uncle, my aunt Ruth\u2019s\nhusband, Herbert Binger was one of the first that they took to the concentration camp, Dachau.\nAnd he was there so that\u2019s how we had heard only through letters, that were in Manila by the\ntime we reached Manila. And I also forgot to mention the fact that when we got off the ship in\nManila, there was a girl that had a cousin waiting on her at the pier or the docks in Manila. And\nshe said to her cousin, she said \u201cHey\u201d she said \u201cwho\u2019s that Chinese lady that, that Chinese girl\nthat\u2019s there with you that came off the ship. She is Chinese.\u201d And my girlfriend said \u201cOh no,\nshe\u2019s one of us.\u201d And I was so devastated when I heard that, I had never forgotten that ever\nsince. It\u2019s been bothering me and I told her about that, the last day that we were here together at\nthe reunion but I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Now back to our moving around to the Santa\nEscolastica school and going to classes over there. And the boy that had, we had to leave the\nschool because this little boy that was in kindergarten, he apparently had either stomped on the\npicture of Jesus or spit on it or both. I\u2019m not exactly sure. But the Mother Superior told my\nmother that she has to take us out of school because we cannot expect, she said \u201cwe cannot\nexpect Jewish children to come and study at the Catholic school. We wouldn\u2019t go to your\nschool.\u201d So my mother said \u201cwell we don\u2019t have a school. There are just a handful of Jewish\nchildren here.\u201d She said, \u201cWell then it\u2019s time you opened one up.\u201d And with that my mother\nwas so upset that she said \u201cyes, ok\u201d. So all of the kids that were in that school. There weren\u2019t all\nthat many. But there were a number of the refugees that were there and we had to leave. But\nwhile I was in classes over there, the children all made fun of my English because my English\nwas the Oxford English and if I said something like looking glass or either or neither, they just\nwould laugh and that would really embarrass me. And then another thing that happened is there\nare So many cats over there and somehow, I didn\u2019t know yet. I learned later on that you had to be\nvery careful where you stepped because if you stepped into some cat do, you would get that\nhorrible smell on you and the whole class would smell badly. And somebody would say \u201chm, I\nsmell something horrible. Margie, did you step into something.\u201d And you know what, I really\nwas the one that did it. So they\u2019d send me out of the class. I had to clean my shoes off. The\nbottom and wherever I stepped into it and then I could return to the class. But I still had a few\nvery ugly experiences over in Santa Escolastica. So when they told us we had to leave I really\nwasn\u2019t all that sorry. To me, that was kind of a new page in my life. I was going on from this bad\nexperience with the German sisters. So we moved, this was Pasay where we were living in that\nbig house and that where we shared with so many people.",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t in Intramuros anymore. Is Pasay a suburb of Manila.",
        "A: Yeah, by the way yeah, Pasay is a suburb of Manila. And Pasay had also the Jewish\ncommittee. I think they were located either very close to it or I\u2019m not sure exactly where. But\nthey told my dad that he should use his money up first and not to worry about a job. It\u2019ll come,\nit\u20191l come and my dad said \u201cyeah but I don\u2019t\u2019 want to use everything up. We\u2019ll have nothing to\nlive on anymore.\u201d And they said \u201coh, it\u2019s all right. You\u2019ll find work. You\u2019ll find.\u201d So it was\nover a year later that my dad finally did. But not until we moved to Ermita. But I do want to\nsay one more thing what happened to me while we were living in Pasay. We had this one lady\nthat had a baby and her husband, they were living with us at that time in the big house. And she\nasked my mother if I could go and get her some sanitary napkins. So my mother said yeah she\nshould go. So she gave me some one and she said \u201cwhy don\u2019t you go to the market, over\u201d which\nwas not all that far away. And she said \u201cgo and get me a box of sanitary napkins\u201d. And I went\nahead and I was about 12 years old at the time. And I went over there and I said \u201cI want a box of\nsanitary napkins\u201d. And this Chinese merchant said to me, he says do you know what they are.\nAnd I says \u201cOf course,\u201d I said \u201cit\u2019s a napkin that you wipe your mouth with when you are\ndone\u2019. Well they all were laughing like crazy and I couldn\u2019t understand why they are laughing.\nTo me it was a very serious matter. So when I went home I told my mother, I said \u201cyou know\nthey were laughing but when I, they asked me if I knew what a sanitary napkin was and I didn\u2019t\nknow. All I said is well it\u2019s something that you have to use when you eat your lunch or dinner\nand you wipe your mouth and to be you know. Etiquette, it reminds you to have a napkin. And\nthey roared, they absolutely roared.\u201d And she said \u201coh my goodness\u201d. She said you don\u2019t know\nreally, do you?\u201d I said \u201cwhat should I know\u201d. And she said \u201cWell that\u2019s when you get your\nperiod.\u201d Well I was so embarrassed. From that moment on, when I had to go to the market I\nwent across the street. I passed them so I wouldn\u2019t have to look at them or go near them. It was\nthe most embarrassing moment of my life, I think at that point. It was horrible. Anyway, from\nlike I said from Pasay we did finally move to Ermita because first of all there were no jobs to be\nhad over where we were living in Pasay and there was a nice school with American nuns and I\nthink really that was the main reason that my parents moved to Ermita. There were many other\nsuburbs they could have gone to, suburbs of Manila that they could have gone to. But that so we\nwent over to meet the sisters of Maryknoll. And they were so wonderful. They opened their\narms, took us in. We had to pay which we did too at Santa Escolastica. Nothing is for free. We\neven had to buy uniforms at Santa Escolastica. And now we had to buy uniforms again in\nMaryknoll, at or college. But Maryknoll college uniform was very pretty. It was a wine red full\nskirt with bib like. And underneath you had a beige blouse, short sleeves and it had a wine red\nribbon around the collar which was very pretty. It was kind of a pleated top and down to the\nwaist and then again pleat from the waist down. And we really loved the sisters. It was so\nwonderful. And being we were Jewish we were not required to take religious lessons as we had\nto do in Santa Escolastica. We had to attend all the lessons, but over there they gave me the\nfreedom. If I wanted to, I could sit in the back of the class and just listen. Well I thought that\nwas very interesting for me was the history so I just sat there and listened to all the teachings of\nJesus Christ and the parables and all the things that happened and saints and what have. And\nthen it came. Oh before I go on, I was put into the sixth grade right then and there because I was\nin fifth grade at Santa Escolastica. And they thought that I would fit very well into the sixth\ngrade. So I was in the sixth grade. And they had a test, an examination at the end of the school\nyear and they said would you like to take the examination on, on the religious part of it. I said\nsure. What have I to lose. I mean after all you know I\u2019m not supposed to be here but I\u2019Il take it.\nAnd believe it or not I was on the honor roll, the second person on the honor, I did better than the\nCatholics did. And the sisters told it all over the school. Can you imagine. We have a Jewish girl\nand she got a 98% whereas you kids don\u2019t even get anything. You are barely passing. And so I\nwas really thrilled. And then came the seventh grade. And again I was on the honor roll and\nagain I was on the top in fact this time I was on the first on the honor roll. I was number one\nwhich made me very happy. And it pleased them immensely. Then we graduated from the\nseventh grade. Well that is a big deal. The archbishop has to come in and he has to bless the\nchildren and you had to have special uniforms. White dress and I, well my mother really\ncouldn\u2019t afford to buy a white dress so one of the classmates of mine said oh her sister already\ngraduated and I could fit into her dress. And that\u2019s what happened and I had to go forward and\nkiss the ring. I pretended to kiss it. I didn\u2019t really kiss, I didn\u2019t think 1t was sanitary enough to\nkiss the ring, but I did and from then on I went to high school. And in the first year of high\nschool, I learned Latin and that was a very difficult language. And then the war broke out. And\nthat was the end of it for my school of that time.",
        "Q: Where did you go to high school?",
        "A: The very same place. Maryknoll College. They also had a high school. And at that point I\nwas, let\u2019s see 14 years old, 14 years old. It was 1941 and I\u2019m trying to get the figures in my head.\nAnyhow, anyway I didn\u2019t not even complete the high school, the first year of high school\nbecause the war did break out in December.",
        "Q: Before we get to that part of what you went through because it was so different and involving,\nwhat was your experience with the Jewish community or your association with the Jewish\ncommunity in Manila between your arrival at the end of 1938 and say the bombing of Pearl\nHarbor in December of 1941.",
        "A: We had by that time, we had joined the congregation. The Temple Emil and we had a\nwonderful person that was I think he wasn\u2019t really a rabbi. He was the father of Rebecca\nKonigsberg because her father was very well educated in the Jewish religion. And he knew all\nthe customs so he was leading the congregation there for a number of years. And we went to\nSunday School. We took Hebrew lessons. We, we learned a lot in that time. And even through\nall the war years, we still were going to that temple until the very end of the occupation. But let\nme not get ahead of it. We moved to Ermita and we had to share again a lower flat like. It had\nseveral bedrooms and we rented it in the beginning, we rented it to American businessmen.\nThen they left. Then we rented it to an American woman with a child and the man was in the\nmilitary. And then they were evacuated because they knew that something was going to happen.\nPeople had an inkling that war was not far away but nobody really talked about it, that this was\nin 1940 I would say. And then white Russians moved in. After they all had left, so we had quite\na turn over, over there, but we always were able to rent it. And before all this, I do want to say\nsomething really cute. We had a black cat. And this cat was like a little dog. It would know\nexactly when we would come from school, at lunch time and would sit at the gate waiting for us.\nAnd it was adorable. That cat was just like a, like a little, it was like, but like a cat, it wasn\u2019t,\nwasn\u2019t a cat. It was like a dog I want to say. And then my mother saw a black cat one day out\nwhile she was shopping for groceries. And she said \u201cmy goodness, that looks like our cat Peter\u201d.\nSo she was feeding this cat Peter all the way to the home and guess what. There was our cat in\nthe window sitting and looking. So she had fed this strange black cat who was very happy to\nreceive the food. That was one of the funny experiences we had during that time. Anyway.",
        "Q: I forgot to ask you. Do you remember approximately when your father got the job with the\nFord motor company and what that did to your life.",
        "A: My dad got the job after one year, which was 1939. He did get a job with Ford Motors as a\npurchasing agent. And he had to drive the car around and pick up parts and things like that and\nhe really loved the job. It was very nice and he really enjoyed it. And we were very happy to\nfinally have you know some extra money. And in the meanwhile, we got a word that in Manila,\nin, I\u2019m sorry in Shanghai an uncle who had been coming over Manila and we couldn\u2019t keep him\nthere, had gone on to Shanghai. Had pneumonia and passed away and left my aunt with a six\nyear old daughter. That was in 1939. The same age as my sister. So it was a very trying\nexperience for her so we were able to send her money so she would have something to live on.\nAnd then came the news that my grandmother was still in Germany and had to get out. So again\nwe had to send some money and to, into Shanghai and my grandmother got the very last train out\nof Germany, over Siberia to go to Shanghai.",
        "Q: Now when you say your grandmother you\u2019re talking about Anna Zusman.",
        "A: Yes, yes it was Anna Zusman that was my grandmother that was left behind. The other ones\nI, like I said I don\u2019t even know you know. I knew they were in Katowice. That\u2019s the last, we had\nsaid our goodbyes over there. And my grandmother in Germany, she by that time everybody had\nto wear the Star of David on their, the yellow star of David, or an arm band. They had to be\nidentified as Jews. And when friends that she had before wouldn\u2019t\u2019 even talk to her. That they\nran across the street or just to get out of the way so they wouldn\u2019t have to greet her. And so",
        "Q: this is probably a good time for me to ask you. You mentioned there were letters waiting for\nyou when you got to Manila. And although you knew about Kristallnacht from on board the ship,\nI assume you learned more things from the correspondence that you had waiting for you in\nManila. I wanted to ask you about that correspondence and whether you were able to continue\nreceiving mail after that.",
        "A: Yes we did letters, get letters from my aunt and my grandmothers stating the fact that my\nuncle now was in a concentration camp and he has to get out. Out of Germany because that\u2019s the\nonly way he could get out of the concentration camp. Now my uncle had already years ago had\nTV. He was so he had weak lungs. So when he went into we tried to keep him Manila by the\nway. We tried everything. We went to the HIAS, we went to the Jewish committee. We tried\nevery which way and there was absolutely no way they could, we could keep them over there\nwhich was very disturbing to us because we had hoped that they could stay with us. And as fate\nwould have it. they went to Shanghai and that\u2019s the only place my grandmother, Anna Zusman\ncould go. So perhaps this was the way fate played it on us, that she was saved that way. And she\ndied in Shanghai at, of old age but my aunt said that also she had stomach cancer and nobody\nwanted to really talk about it. And thinking now about the going back to the beginning. I\u2019m\ntrying to remember in sequence how things were going. In Ermita, when we found out that the\nwar was coming. My dad of course was still working on the pier. And then the Japanese started\nbombing us very, very heavily. And there was no difference between military objects or private\npeople. It just didn\u2019t\u2019 matter. And we could always tell when you saw them in morning, early\nhigh up above at around 8:00, that would mean they would bomb us. If they weren\u2019t there at\n8:00 that day they would not bomb. SO this was from December the eighth until oh, into I\nthink it was like February when they finally decided to invade us. And my dad was working like\nI say on the docks and they\u2019re bombing all the time. And then the Americans had to set fire to all\nof the ships\u2019 cargo and everything that was on the docks. They didn\u2019t want to leave anything to\nthe Japanese of course. So the people were told, take whatever you can carry. The ships are open\nto you. The factories are open to you. Grab whatever you can. Make as many trips as you can\nand get all the food or whatever you feel like you\u2019re going to grab and if you can make several\ntrips go for it. So people would pass our house with, carrying things like clothing and just\nmaterials so my mother bought a couple of materials from these people and we bought potatoes\nbecause potatoes did not grow in Manila. They had to be imported. So and we were used to\neating potatoes. So then my dad got a bicycle from the company and they said take whatever you\ncan take. So he just took the bicycle and a few odds and ends. But no, not a whole lot. We\u2019re\nnot, he wasn\u2019t the kind of person to just take. But we did get a few things from the people that\nwere dragging it and then they could go back and get more. This way they had money and at the\nsame time were able to get some groceries or foods, I mean clothing and whatever else we could\npossibly use. One thing we heard about and that was kind of a strange situation. These people,\nthere were four of them. And they were carrying this, they saw this huge heavy box. And they\nfigured there must be something wonderful in that box. So the four, four people are carrying it.\nAnd they took it all the way down to, into our area and along the beach. It was called Dewey\nBoulevard, it was a beautiful, it wasn\u2019t a beach. First it was a street and then there was a beach.\nThat this was Dewey Boulevard with a street that they were walking on and dragging things and\npulling and whatever they could do. And finally got far enough from the fire and opened it up\nand inside was a coffin with a dead person who was on his way to wherever they were going\nnext to be buried. Well needless to say that was the end of that, never got to go to his resting\nplace. And then the fire was going a lot. I mean it was all around. They were trying to burn as\nmuch as they could. But they did not burn homes or anything like that. 1t was just at the pier.\nAnd then pretty soon the Japanese started marching in and the Americans had already left for\nBataan and I think Corregidor and they went kind of away from Manila. And only people left\nwere the civilians. Us. And we were declared open city, a long time ago but the Japanese just\ndidn\u2019t\u2019 care. they bombed us anyway. And that is how some people did get killed, injured et\ncetera. We were safe. We were very, very fortunate that we did not get killed. And my dad being,\nworking with the at the docks for so long, it was a miracle that he wasn\u2019t hit by something or\nother. And",
        "Q: Before we go on to the Japanese occupation, I didn\u2019t want to forget to ask you about whether\nthe Filipinos treated you any differently because you were Jewish. Whether the Jewish\ncommunity there was treated any worse than any other part of the white immigrant or refugee\ncommunity.",
        "A: No, they treated us very well. I mean they to them Judaism didn\u2019t\u2019 mean anything different.\nWe believed in God. They believed in God. The majority of the people there were anyway\nCatholics and there was, they were very strict Catholics. They would go to Mass and they really\nrespected everybody. And therefore they believed in the Ten Commandments. Honor thy\nparents, love thy neighbors. And they really believed in that.",
        "Q: Also during that period of time, before the Japanese occupation you were going to, you were\nstill in school. At the Maryknoll college. And I assume you were still going to Sunday school at\nthe temple. So before the Japanese came, what was your life like within the Jewish community.",
        "A: We had a very life. We had our get together. We had, made a lot of friends with other Jewish\nrefugees and we children enjoyed going to Sunday school. We met our peers and we just enjoyed\nit and during the high holidays it was always a wonderful time for us because everybody was\nthere, regardless of whether they were very religious or not and a lot of the people that, there\nwere some, I shouldn\u2019t say a lot. There were some people that came from Shanghai that friends, I\nmade friends with the Helmans. There was Rosie Helman, Siggy Helman and Gloria Helman.\nThose were the children. And Mr. and Mrs. Helman. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember their first names at this\nmoment. They had a boarding house right on Dewey Boulevard overlooking the ocean. And that\nwas a very favorite place for everybody and Rosie and I became very dear friends because she\nwent to the Sunday school and we just all had a very pretty good life considering you know we\nweren\u2019t\u2019 rich or anything like that. We couldn\u2019t take things out of their country so we were, had\nto start fresh, completely fresh as I\u2019ve said before. There was not a whole lot left that we could\nrescue or salvage. We did keep that wooden box that all our stuff came in. And my mother had\npacked away a couple of things, including some crystal because we only lived in one room, the\nfour of us were in one room and rented all out to the other people so we could pay for this flat.\nLike I say we had a hard time because they had to give money for the visa for my grandmother\nand already mentioned for us to be able to buy a popsicle, ice cream. I mean there, the food thing\non a popsicle. Oh that was quite a big deal. We never were able to buy a Coke because those\nwere expensive. Even five centavos we couldn\u2019t have. We had to save every penny to send to\nShanghai. And for the visa for my grandmother. So we were really considered quite poor in those\ndays. So when the war, I mean when the Japanese came in, we had taken, we had gotten a few\nfurnitures of course, and all the people, the Americans had left. Now the Japanese were marching\nin. We heard them coming in during the night. And it was an awful feeling to hear marching. It\nreminded us of the Nazis in Germany. And we were so afraid that they were going to come into\nour homes. And, and just kill us all. We had heard horrible stories of what Japanese can do from\npeople in different areas. They were very sadistic. And the first troops in were mostly Koreans.\nThey had taken them as the foot soldiers and the officers were Japanese and these people, the\nKoreans and the low, low Japanese their uniforms smelled so horrible that you could actually\nsmell them through the windows into the house. And had a terrible stench about them. I don\u2019t\u2019\nknow whether they were able to wash it there or what you know. Because they were in the war. I\nmean they were just waiting and they had to land someplace. But it was very, very hard for us to\nall of a sudden for the Americans to the Japanese. We didn\u2019t know what awaited us. How they\nwere going to treat us, being Jewish and of course our nuns were still at the Maryknoll college\nbut we were not able to go to school because we were afraid to go out into the streets and so\nforth. And of course they were, later we learned they were right away interned in Saint Thomas\nwhich as an internment camp for Americans, for white Russians and people that they suspected\nof being pro-American. So but also then we were afraid we were going to be bombed by the\nAmericans and so 1n a way that is also sort of what happened, but not right away. Not, they\nwere still gathering themselves together and trying to get all the forces that were left because\nthey, a lot of them were in Bataan and they didn\u2019t\u2019 have a lot of communications with them\nbecause the Japanese intercepted everything that went out of the country.",
        "Q: I had asked you what your diet and life style was\n(file 3 \u2014 RG-50.106.0052.03.03 \u2014 duration: 01:01:04)",
        "Q: This is continuation of an interview for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. I\u2019m\ninterviewing Margie Rosenthal and my name is Nancy Alper. It\u2019s the 24\" of October 1996.\nThis is the third tape of this interview, the first side. And Margie and I were just talking about\ntheir life style, the family\u2019s life style before the Japanese took over and afterwards.",
        "A: Before the Japanese took over, we could go to the market and buy beef and you know better\nthings. However no the potatoes before the war were still there because they were imported.\nOnce the Japanese moved in we did not have any fresh food. We did not have any regular\npotatoes. We ate yams or yellow potatoes, the sweet potatoes, I should say. And we didn\u2019t have\nmuch money. In fact money was like going always up, up, up. It was like inflation. Money\nwasn\u2019t worth a thing and so we ate rice. One meal would be the rice soup. Another meal would\nbe the rice. Another meal would be the potato peels , the sweet potato peel and another one\nwould be the regular sweet potato. But my mother became inventive. She would take for\nexample she would take the potato which was an awful sweet potato and she would put vinegar\non it and would put salt on it and it kind of deadened the sweetness. And it was a little bit like a\npotato salad, were trying to imitate that. Then to make, in those days we still had electricity and\nso forth. So my mother would get some coconuts and with (rust?) with the coconut and then\nsqueeze out the cream and from that she would make ice cream and put that into like cubes, into\ncube trays in the freezer. And we would have ice cream. I mean you had to be very inventive.\nYou could take flowers and make a jelly and jam out of it. And later on in the things, I mean\nflour disappeared. We had then we made, we bought bread made of rice flour. We bought bread\nout of just about anything that you could imagine and the matzo. We had no matzo of course so\nwe used sour flour for matzo. Things were really pretty rotten. And the beef came to an end as\nwell because the caribous were, you know there were more no more caribous and the Japanese\nconfiscated a lot of the stuff. So all of a sudden we were having horse meat. But we didn\u2019t know\nit was. It tasted different. Our Dad finally told us because he was in Russia before the war if you\nremember. He would say it tastes sweet and that is horse meat. Well then we didn\u2019t want to eat\nthat any more either. So we stuck to a diet of fish and chicken but chicken was really a delicacy.\nWe couldn\u2019t hardly afford to buy a chicken so we decided we\u2019re going to raise our own and well\nwhere do you keep a chicken, right. There was no, you can\u2019t leave it outside. It might get stolen\nso we put chickens in one of the little rooms like a closet and had a bar across it and they would\nroost right on top of the bars. But then the rats would come and would like to eat those poor\nchickens. You had, you know making a lot of fluttering and screaming and screeching. And we\nwould jump out of bed and we tried to chase the rats away from the where we had the chickens\nbecause like I said they liked to eat chickens too. Then during the winter season we lived in a\nplace where we were downstairs and across the street from us was the house of Japanese where\nthey were torturing Filipinos. Whoever they thought was a group that was against them. And\nthey would do the most horrible things to them. And we would see walking by. It was just awful.\nThey would have men hanging upside down and would make them smoke and they would have\nthem close their nose and mouth and they would have to inhale the smoke. And they would just\nabsolutely and they\u2019d blow up like they would swell up. It was just awful. Or they would pull\nfingernails out and toenails and the water torture. They did everything and anything to get some\ninformation out of them. And that they didn\u2019t do, they couldn\u2019t do. And my dad at that time,\nthere was no more. In the beginning my dad and I were selling automobile parts, in the very\nbeginning of the Japanese occupation because we needed to get some money. So we would buy\nparts from one place and take it and sell it to another place. One of our, my good customers was\nthe cigar company. Hamber, I think it was called cigar company. And they would give me\nwhat they wanted. They needed say X number of piston rings, X number of spark plugs. X\nnumber of fan belts. I mean things like that or even batteries. So I would go and find where I\ncould find some and then bring it to them and sell them. Now I was having a better time of sales\nthan my dad, I guess because I was a girl. Anyway, and that way I was able to support my family\nsome money somehow. And in the meantime, of course the Americans were bombing us.",
        "Q: Were you still Ermita then or had you moved to a different location and where did you get\nthe auto parts?",
        "A: Well we still were in Ermita and the auto parts, people tipped us off who might be wanting to\nsell. Well you had no gasoline. You only had cars there so you dismantled them and sold part by\npart because nobody could drive a car at that point anyway. Gasoline was out of the question so\nyou had to do what you had to do and this is how I found out well these people had this and that\nand so I went and procured it and sold it to them. And we\u2019d separate, my dad and I. He\u2019d go one\ndirection and I\u2019d go someplace else and sometimes we\u2019d meet for lunch or whatever, downtown.\nBut between the bombings, the Americans were flying way up there. And we wanted to say\nhooray, hooray, hooray but we didn\u2019t dare show any kind of an emotion because that would have\nbeen the end. But then that stopped too. And so then my dad used to go to the market, get some\nlinguises, they called them. That\u2019s a sausage and other things that he thought people would need\nand took it into the provinces, way into the interior of Manila, in that bundle into Philippines,\ninterior of the suburbs and further out. Well twice, my poor father was caught. The first time they\nthought he was a guerrilla but he talked his way out of it. The second time he wasn\u2019t so lucky.\nHe, they had him, they hand bound him. They were going to shoot him. I mean they already had\na position to sue. And he said I can show you that I\u2019m a Jewish person. I had the bris, and they\nsaid that doesn\u2019t mean anything. We do too. We had the same operation. Don\u2019t work, that stuff.\nSo he said I can recite the Shema. He said how do we know that that is your prayer. We don\u2019t\u2019\nknow Hebrew. So he was there for hours. They were keep, questioning him. And he kept saying\nI am not a, I am not a spy for the Japanese. I am not. Iam pro-American. We",
        "Q: Now if I understand this they were rebel guerrillas. These were not Japanese soldiers but\nthese were the Filipinos who were fighting the Japanese.",
        "A: That is correct. They were in the outskirts hiding underground so to speak. Yes, and they,\nwhen they see a white man or what\u2019s he doing in the province, find out he\u2019s German on top of\nthat. Well, that means enemy. And so they really wanted to kill him. And so he said \u201clook, if\nyou\u2019re going to kill me, do it now. Don\u2019t prolong this anymore. I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d He was saying\nthe Shema over and over and over again. And nothing they said, he said or did. He says I have a\nfamily. I have two children. I have a, my wife is there. He said please you know this was in the\nPasay. This, in the meanwhile we had to move Ermita, because Ermita was getting very\nexpensive, so we went back to Pasay. And we rented a downstairs. It was like a basement type\nthing, level to the ground. And that, from there we were making our trips into the city and you\ndidn\u2019t have much. As transportation you mostly had to walk and it was pretty hard. And anyway\nso my dad, this finally somebody else, the big, big macher came from the group. And he said, \u201cI\nbelieve this man. Let him go.\u201d So they said ok, let him go. He was so sure they were going to\nshoot him in the back. And he took his bicycle and started walking. He didn\u2019t dare get on a\nbicycle because he was so weak by that time. He was so exhausted from the interrogations and\nfrom the, the whole way they held him, hand cuffed behind his back and all that. I mean he was\njust a broken man. Well, they let him go. But the man that told him you can go, said, \u201cI will\nwatch you. I will make sure that you are telling the truth. And if you\u2019re not, you\u2019re a dead man.\u201d\nSo he told him where he, where we lived so he says \u201cI\u2019m going to come and check up on you.\u201d\nMy dad came home walking. He never rode the bicycle all the way, miles and miles and miles,\nkilometers over there. And he came home and he always was an old man. He was so broken up\nabout this that we said you\u2019re not going back into that again ever, ever. You cannot do it. And so\nmy poor father, that night, sure enough we spied, we saw somebody outside our window. We\nthought it was somebody going to break in again. And no, it was one of the people that had said\nthey\u2019re going to check up on him were outside our window, looking in. But barely. You had to\njust kind of look in through the slats. But they were there checking up on us. That was the last\ntime he went into the country. We would not let him. I said we\u2019d rather starve. Now we, like I\nsaid, we were at the floor level. In the back was swamp. And they had fish so we would go out\nthere and try to catch some fish for food. And we had those two chickens. But you know we\ndidn\u2019t have heart. We did not have the heart to kill them so we gave them to a neighbor and says\nhere. You take them. We don\u2019t want to eat them. And they\u2019re getting older. You better just use\nthem. Of course they didn\u2019t\u2019 give us any share at all, but the Japanese kept up their atrocities\nsomething awful. And many people didn\u2019t make it back. I mean even some of our Jewish people\nwere taken . They found a short wave radio or sometimes they didn\u2019t find anything. They just\ndidn\u2019t\u2019 like the way you answered them and that was it.",
        "Q: With the Japanese patrolling on a daily basis around all the neighborhoods sort of like a\npolice force.",
        "A: Not really patrolling. They had houses. Little like a, it was like you see in England. You\nknow those little guard houses. They had that that set up all over and when you walked by you\nhad to bend down as low as you could because if you didn\u2019t they just slap you left and right. And\nso we learned to do it. But later on we get to the idea, hey wait a minute. We are German. They\ndon\u2019t\u2019 know the difference so we said Allemande, Allemande. German. Deutsch, Deutsch.\nAnd you know it worked. We didn\u2019t\u2019 have to do it anymore. They bowed to us. But they were\nlike I said pretty viscous. And again things became, the water kept rising in that place. Whenever\nit rained. It was rainy season, the piles came loose. And we, whenever we put our feet out ora\nhand out, it would touch water. So we know the water had risen to our bed. And the beds were\nway up there. High up. Everything was up high. And that\u2019s how so we could open the, we had\nwindow open. The water was as high outside as it was inside. So we saw fish floating by and we\ntried to catch those fish. So once in a while we were lucky and we were able to catch the fish. So\nbetween vegetables that were growing out back and fish we didn\u2019t need a whole lot of money.",
        "Q: I think you talked about the fact that the Japanese placed their munitions near some, in\nsuburban neighborhoods. And I\u2019m wondering if that was true in Pasay as well as Ermita. If that\nwas just a general practice of the Japanese.",
        "A: It certainly was. From Pasay, we moved back to Ermita. We just things were getting pretty\nbad. We couldn\u2019t\u2019 stay in that, in a place where the water was coming up all the time. We lost a\nlot of things due to that. The shoes molded away, the blankets and everything else. So that didn\u2019t\nlast. So then we went to Ermita now. It was almost 1945, very close to 1945 when we moved\nback to Ermita. I would say that was probably in the very beginning of 45. And the bombings of\nthe Americans increased. Then came shelling. They had, they dropped leaflets and were telling\nus that they had already come to the outskirts of Manila by dropping leaflets. So we knew the\nend was near. We could just hold out a little bit longer. And we had ok, also we, up until that\ntime we were able to go to the temple. And we were able to go every week to services. But\nwhen the shell, the bombings got worse and worse, it really was very dangerous to be outside.\nAnd there was no place to really hide because there were no air raid shelters in Manila because it\nwas too low. It was water underneath, not far down, we had water. So we couldn\u2019t build any air\nshelters. So you had to hope for the best. That was about it. So then we were again back in\nErmita and then the Japanese had been storing ammunition in between the civilians because\nthey knew that the, if the Americans knew civilians lived there, they would not bomb the\ncivilians. So they very smartly put gasoline, ammunition, anything that was flammable to put in-\nbetween the civilians, like maybe two houses of civilian. The third one would have that. Or five\nhouses of civilians and a big bloc of Japanese. So they were all over the place. And we knew\nmore or less where they were. So we but we, where else can you run. I mean you can\u2019t keep\nrunning so we were at one place. It used to be a dressmaker\u2019s place. That was our very last stand.\nWe were so tired of moving and running away and no matter where we went we were getting\nbombed or getting shelled. It really didn\u2019t\u2019 make any difference.",
        "Q: I know you told me that you also sold pies. And I\u2019m wondering where that fit in and 1n this\ntime period we\u2019re discussing and if you reached a point where there simply wasn\u2019t anything you\ncould do anymore to earn money.",
        "A: Well the pies came at a very late date also because like I said food was running out. So this\none lady was baking pies and I took it to the hospital where they still had some doctors and\nnurses. And also the people that were discharged from the prisons were there. And there was\none Jewish man that I, basically that was the one I really, really remembered. Because I had\nknown him. His name was Moser. And he was laying on the bed, white. His legs were saw raw\nthat he couldn\u2019t even put his legs together and he was so thin that there was nothing left and he\nlooked almost like what you see nowadays with the concentration camp victims. Exactly that\u2019s\nwhat he looked like. They starved him, they beat him. They did everything you can possibly\nimagine. He could barely talk to us. And I brought a pie over to him and I fed him because I felt\nthat was the only thing I could do. I would explain what happened to that pie later on to the lady\nthat made them, but he had to have some nourishment and I started feeding him small little\npieces and he ate it and his eyes became big and cause he couldn\u2019t really show much emotion at\nthat point. He was just too, too tired of living, too tired of everything. And the pies like I said you\nknow I sold as long as I could. And that stopped as well because the bombing got more severe\nand more severe and by that time, the Americans were already in Intramuros, in that area we\nheard. So it was time to just put an end to this. And so we were in this building that we had taken\nover from the dressmaker. And across the street from us were this red light house, the red light\ndistrict house. And I was standing in the doorway of our place where we were. And all of a\nsudden this Japanese soldier comes in, grabs me and was trying to drag me up the stairs. I am\ncrying, I am yelling and my mother is holding me. My sister is holding my mother and my father\nis holding my, my sister. My mother. Well anyway, one after the other. And I am trying to hold\nonto the bannister and he\u2019s pulling me, he\u2019s much stronger than I am. By this time I had amoebic\ndysentery. And I was very weak and so this, finally dad let go and he says I\u2019m running outside\nand see if I find a, an officer. Lucky, he found an officer. Do you speak English? Do you speak\nGerman? English. Help us, help me. My daughter. She\u2019s not one of those. So he came in and\nhe, I was already on the top of the stairs. And all of a sudden the officer arrived. And yelled\nsomething in Japanese and the, this soldier froze. And I was, I was hysterical by this time. I\nmean I was completely, I was so bad, I couldn\u2019t even walk downstairs. They carried me down\nthe stairs. And I was there and the officer called him to come down. The guy came down, this\nsoldier. He took him and he beat him up. I mean I, after a while I actually felt sorry for this guy.\nNot only did he beat him. He knocked him to the ground and then he kicked him. And he was\nstill apologizing. This, this police, I mean this solider was apologizing to this, to this officer.\nAnyway it was very lucky for me. It was really it was very, one of the fortunate instances. Well\nthen this all was coming to an end. The Japanese were making, going from house to house\ninterrogating or taking people. My dad said goodby already. My mother said goodby to us too.\nAnd said that your aunt is in Shanghai and I want you to go there after the war because if we are\nnot around, you have to be the, you have to be in charge. And he said, again he started saying the\nShema and dad said this is it. I\u2019m sorry, you girls will have to fend for yourself. The Americans\nare not far away. So you know be calm and do what they say. So guess what. They were next\ndoor, avoided our house, went to the next one and you could her people screaming and crying.\nAnd the truck was loading up all these people. And we were scared and next day in the morning\nthey brought some of the women back, not the men. We never saw the men again. And then that\nnight, all of a sudden we hear bombing, shelling and fire starting in our immediate area.",
        "Q: These people who were the victims of the house to house search, were these Filipinos,\nAmericans, refugees.",
        "A: Only Filipinos. There were no more white people around. We were just living among\nFilipinos.",
        "Q: Do you think that they in these two instances helped you in the instance of the soldier who\nwas dragging you up the steps and spared you in the instance you just described because you\nwere Germans.",
        "A: We think that might have happened because how else I mean we had the same place. I mean\nwe were side by side we\u2019d go from one to the next to the next. I mean you know how, we\nassumed that maybe this officer when somehow word must have spread. Say don\u2019t go there,\nthose are Germans. I don\u2019t know. Maybe the hand of God was over us. What, we don\u2019t\u2019 know.\nWe just don\u2019t\u2019 know. We only know that we were spared. And then that night we had to leave\nthat place and we thought we\u2019ll never come back again. And we hid in about a block away\nwhere still no flames. And we went there. In the morning we heard that that street had not\nburned yet so we cautiously made our way back there and sure it was not burned yet. So my\nfather said now I they next time the flames are going to get closer. We better grab what we\u2019re\ngoing to take if we can carry it.",
        "Q: When you say flames, you\u2019re talking about flames from what the bombs had set on fire in the\narea, what was burning as a result of the bombing?",
        "A: Shelling, the shelling, not the bombing at this point. It was mainly the heavy, heavy shelling.\nBy the Americans. And they just shot into it because the Japanese were intermingled with us and\nthe ammunition and the gasoline and daddy, my father said we don\u2019t want to go up in flames\nand be thrown to smithereens. We just might as well leave while we still can. So that morning we\ngathered all our meager, one photo album, the address for my aunt and the visa, affidavits for\nAmerica. I, my dad told me to take the electric plate over my neck and that was heavy. And the\ndog and the leash. We had a dog. And my sister couldn\u2019t\u2019 carry anything. She was too, I was 17\nat the time. and so my sister she was, what 12. So I don\u2019t know. Maybe they gave her something\nto carry also. And on top of that we had again bought some chickens. Raw, live chickens. And\nthey were making such a racket. So we gave it to somebody. And said we don\u2019t\u2019 want to be, we\ncan\u2019t kill them anyway. Just take them, just go. So we gave them to somebody who I don\u2019t even\nknow who they were. And we went to this apartment house that was down the street and in that\napartment house we went to that apartment building that was standing. That was a very high rise\nbuilding for those days. And in the bottom, or as you walked in from off the street were sandbags\nWell apparently a bomb, a shell had come into there and had not exploded. A great big thing and\none bomb was also in the shaft, elevator shaft. And we figured well let\u2019s lay down there. I mean\nwe've got to get out of the house. At least it\u2019s far enough, even though that explodes it\u2019Il give us\nsome protection with these bags around the building. Well we didn\u2019t expect a shell to come\nright, explode, come right into the, it was like a carport almost. Open on all the sides you see.\nAnd it came right in and exploded and it was phosphorous now. And the explosion of it, threw\nme under a very low table. It was like maybe 5 inches, 6 inches off the floor. It pushed me\nunderneath that and my mother got hit with shrapnel. Our dog ran away at that time and we were\nlooking for the dog afterwards but it was just as well because where we were before had taken\nour dog was barking at all the Japanese. We didn\u2019t know how to keep her quiet. So when this\nexplosion happened, she took off which was probably a blessing. Anyway so we I thought I said\nI think I\u2019m dying. I couldn\u2019t\u2019 breathe because of the phosphor in my lungs, you know. And my\nmother was bleeding from her shrapnel wounds. So we got out of there and went to a maybe a\nblock away to a garage that had burned I mean the garage. A house that had already burned out.\nAll those left were the bottom with hot, hot coals like tiles and things. But where else can we go.\nWe stayed there for just a little bit, maybe one night. That didn\u2019t work very well. So then we\nwent to the school which was Atenao, a parochial school for boys. The building was already\noccupied by a lot of refugees so there was no more room in the building. So the other people\nthat were outside were sitting in ditches that had been placed around the whole parameter of the\nschool. Well that\u2019s where we were when the shots kept coming over our heads. And my mother\nstill had that shrapnel in her but what could we do. There were no doctors, medics, nothing. So\nall we did was we put some bandage on her and that was all we could do. And then we, shell, a\nbig shrapnel fell between my mother and myself. If we had been closer it would have killed one\nof us. Well we figured out that wasn\u2019t a place to stay again. So again we started moving around.\nSo then we spied this, oh that was several blocks away because we knew that this was going to\ngo up and sure enough that night, our house, our place, that whole block went up. In explosion\nbecause a shell had hit there as well and it hit our apartment where we were hiding. It also was\nhitting already close to that place where we were living before. So we had to go further. So we\nwalked and we w",
        "Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum with Margie Rosenthal. Nancy Alper, October\nthe 26\" 1996. This is the second side of the third tape of the interview. And we were talking\nabout what I assume was part of the battle of Manila, at the very end of the war in the Pacific\nagainst the Japanese, or close to the end.",
        "A: The, we had finally come upon this garage that had a roof like I said, three sides but the front\nwas all open. We were in like sardines. We tried to get out of the outside as much as possible.\nBut we barely made it in because a lot of people there already. And there was one Jewish lady.\nShe had her maid there. She had her cushions there. She had everything that it could possibly\ncould think of. She would not move an inch. So we all were trying to help each other, trying to\nget In as many people as we could. Well we couldn\u2019t lic down. I mean it was you just laid to the\nside of yourself. Anyway, and then we were across the street was a whole contingent of\nJapanese. The whole house was occupied by Japanese soldiers. And pretty soon these Japanese\ncame over, wanted the girls. And being that I was very undernourished, underweight, didn\u2019t have\nmuch on me, they didn\u2019t see me. They thought I was just a kid. But there were some girls there\nthat were well endowed. They lined them all up and they said you, you, you, you. Come. Well\none of them was the daughter of optometrist that we knew. And he went up to this soldier who\nsaid you, you, you. He said watch, my daughter. And so he understood. He let the girl go. And\nhe gave him his gold watch. Then he asked for the men to come out. So all the men including\nmy father of course. He was lining them up and we thought oh my god, he\u2019s going to shoot them\nall now. Imean what. So my dad, said German, German. That saved him. So he sent him back to\nus. But the other ones they took along. They didn\u2019t shoot them right in front of our faces. They\njust took them. So that gave us a little bit more room in the garage which is a sad thing to say\nyou know. But that\u2019s when the moment you say German that was it. So then we had no food, no\nwater and at this time we were pretty worn out by running around from one area to another area\nand nothing to eat but we had had with us a little bit of drink. My dad had saved some whiskey in\na bottle. And he said we were going to use this when we are liberated. Well this was an\nemergency. And we had no more water. So when, they, I looked across the ruins and I saw a\nbunch of people. I said looks to me like they\u2019re going for water. I saw them lowering a can on a\nstring. I said that looks to me like that might have been a house. I\u2019m going. So my dad said, no\nI\u2019m going. I said no you\u2019re not. Because you are man. You might get killed. You are staying. I\nsaid I\u2019m going to take my sister, Eva. So she and I had this flask that was used to probably wine\nin there. It was kind of a maybe a five gallon jug, empty. So I said I\u2019m going to go because\nwhatever, we had nothing else. I mean we found it along the way somewhere. I that\u2019s not what\nwe carried because we had nothing, except what we had on our body, the photo album and a\nstamp album and electric plate. And when you throw yourself down, by that time I\u2019d lost the\nelectric plate also already. I didn\u2019t\u2019 have that anymore because that was at least it was heavy and\nhow could you fall on top of that. It was impossible. So I left 1t some time ago. So then I said,\nlet\u2019s go Eva. So we walked over there to the place where I saw those women and they were\nfighting over the water. I mean there were so , maybe 60 and I had no way of even getting close\nto it. So I just stood there and what next. How am I going to obtain water. We needed water. All\nof a sudden shelling started, whizzing right over our heads. Well the Filipinos, these were all\nFilipinos that we are talking about, all lay down flat on the ground. So that they wouldn\u2019t\u2019 be hit.\nAnd I said Eva lay down too. And I said look. She says come on lay down, lay down. I said no I\ncan\u2019t. I have got to get the water while I can. I\u2019m going to do that. So that\u2019s exactly what I did. I\ntook the can that was standing. I lowered it, brought up this filthy looking water. Threw it into\nthe jug. I got a few cans because the bombing, the shelling goes on for a while. I mean once one\nhits, then there are several. And I was standing up. I said to my sister, I said if it hits me, you\ntake the water and you carry it home, carry it to the garage. So I was standing there. And I,\neverything\u2019s fate in my eyes. And that\u2019s what happened. I got the water. The shelling stopped.\nWe didn\u2019t get a whole lot but we got enough to tide us over. So I said come on. Grab the one\nend of it. I grabbed the other end. We stumbled over all the ruins and the burned out things and\nno, nothing was standing anymore. Everything was just flattened. But you know stones and, and\nglass whatever have you. So we made it right back to the garage and my dad took the whiskey\nand put some into the, into the water we had and that we were survived and had water. And then\nthe next day we were, I had to go, we had no toilet. I had to go to the bathroom. I\u2019m outside and\nall of a sudden, this soldier comes up to me and I thought it was a Japanese and I\u2019m already\ngoing like this with my head down and my hands over my head and, and just cowering down. He\nsaid \u201cget up, get up. We are here, we are here.\u201d I jumped up. I said \u201can Americans, you\u2019re\nAmericans. And he said \u201cyes\u201d cause they were camouflaged with mud on their faces and they\nhad things over their head. The helmets and regular invasion forces. And he said \u201cwhere\u2019s the\nrest of your people.\u201d And I said \u201cover there in that garage\u2019. He says \u201cok, I didn\u2019t know there\nwere more civilians\u201d he said. I said \u201cyes, but be careful.\u201d I said \u201cThere are sentries in the house\nover there. They see you, they\u2019re going to kill you.\u201d So he called over to where my parents were\nand other people. Had them crawl out. I never went back again. I just showed him where they\nwere. I stayed, he said \u201cdon\u2019t you go back. Stay right here. I\u2019m coming for you.\u201d And that\u2019s\nwhat happened and he brought the civilians out, calling and then running. And he says \u201cyou run\nas fast as you can over all these dead people,\u201d over the corpses that had already started to smell\nand I mean stink horrible and the ants and the worms. Oh it\u2019s just horrible and that\u2019s what we\nsaw. And we passed that and by the time. We reached, we reached the, the American lines, they\nput us on a truck and took us to Santa Ana cabaret where 2000 people were already there. And\nanyway, 2000 people were there. And we stayed there for that night and about two nights. And\nwe were famished. And they had a soup kitchen is that what it was. And we ate the soup that\nthey served us and that was the best thing that we ever ate. I mean we were so hungry that\nanything and everything would have been just wonderful. Of course, I did not even have a period\nbecause all the excitement, no nourishment. Nothing. I mean so I didn\u2019t have to worry about that\nat that point. And so we were laying there with thousands. Like I said it was a dancing hall\nbefore and they called it Santa Ana cabaret. And we met some other people but they came, not\nall, too many of our people. And then we went and said, we walked along someplace else to see\nif we could find shelter elsewhere. And we came to this one man. And he said come upstairs\nand you know itll be ok. And I said \u201cno, I have to get my parents\u201d. He said \u201cbring your parents.\nI don\u2019t care\u201d. So I brought my parents and we stayed there for a night or so and I said, and then\nmy mother and dad said \u201cno we can\u2019t take his hospitality. He doesn\u2019t have enough himself.\u201d So\nwe started walking and we saw a house, a vacant house. Oh maybe a couple or three blocks away\nand we went towards that and we took shelter in there. Well that night it started again. The\nshelling and the firing and a bullet came in through the window, hit the, the iron bars and then\nfell on top of me. It burned me but did not penetrate. And it was on my breast and I threw it off\nyou know. And I thought I was going to, I thought I was shot. I mean very honestly I thought I\nwas shot, but it was just a hot bullet that had expanded its force. So the next morning, we knew\nwe couldn\u2019t stay there because there was a Japanese sen, a guy that used to be a sentry. He had\nstill hold out up there and he was shooting down at the Americans. The Americans didn\u2019t even\nknow he was there until I showed them the bullet. I said I got shot. And they said let me see the\nbullet. And they said that\u2019s a Japanese bullet or German. What do I know and they said I will,\nI'd like to have it. I said if you give it back to me. That\u2019s got to be my souvenir. I never saw it\nagain. So then where do we go from here. Well we didn\u2019t\u2019 really know. So then my sister and I\nwalked. I said well while we are still in that house because we had nowhere else to go. They\nwere trying to shoot him and we were in the, in the fire line ok. But finally the, the shooting\nstopped. I said Eva, you and I. Let\u2019s go and I\u2019Il get, I hear there\u2019s a well not far away. Let\u2019s go\nwash our hair. I can\u2019t stand 1t anymore. we are full of mud. And everything else and dust and\nwhat have you. So we walked to the shelter over there. I mean to the well over there. Got,\nwashed our hair. On the way back we run into a GI. And he says \u201ca white girl. Out here, white\nkids. What happened. I didn\u2019t think any white people were here.\u201d And I said \u201cyeah, yeah we\nhave white people here. Well this is my sister and our name is Mijinski, Margot Mijinski. He\nsaid you Jewish? I said \u201cyes\u201d. I said \u201cyeah so are my parents. I want you to meet them\u201d. So we\nwent back where the house was you know. And he said \u201cyou guys can\u2019t stay here. Come with\nme.\u201d And it turned out he was Jewish too. He was 33 years old. He was invasion forces, armed\nforces 37 Division. And he was the one that gave me my very first book, reading material. And\nthen he somehow, he managed to take us and other people to Caisson City where they will put us\ninto an old school house that we, they converted for refugees. So I don\u2019t know how many, again\na hundred people or more were in this very small school house. And we, they divided, the\npartitions were like sheets. Families were like that. And that\u2019s then I got myself a job from my\ngirlfriend. She saw me.",
        "Q: Was this Ernest Benesch?",
        "A: Yes it was. That was Ernest Benesch. Our savior. He was, he brought us fruits, he brought\nus food, at, ever he could get from the commissary over there and from the mess hall. And he\ngave us some food and K, K rations. I mean he was the very first one to give us something like\nthat. And even some chocolate. I mean he was just wonderful.",
        "Q: How long did you stay in that shelter and how did either the army or some other organization\nhelp you to settle into a more livable situation.",
        "A: We were in that school house for a long time. We then around the corner we found that\nsomebody had an empty almost like a shack. It was horrible, no rugs, we had cement floors. But\nthere were a couple of beds in there so we were there. And from there we, we waited until our\nvisa, then they con, everybody contacted us. The Red Cross was around of course. They gave us\nclothing. We had nothing as you know They gave us clothing. They even gave me my first\nsanitary napkin. And they fed us. I mean we just kind of survived and we couldn\u2019t leave until\n1948 and we were in that very, around the corner from that school house. We were staying there.",
        "Q: You were getting ready to tell me how you got a job and maybe you could tell me just the\nprocess of getting yourself in a position to get to the United States.",
        "A: Ok. I had after liberation, when we are still in that school house I had to go downtown. I\nwasn\u2019t going to just wait for something to happen. And I was walking and all of a sudden\nsomebody said Margot, Margot. And I\u2019m looking around. Who is, who 1s calling me and it was\nmy girlfriend Rosie Helman. And Siggy Helman. Come up here, come up here. I said my\ngoodness. I said you are alive. Oh they were, we just hugged and kissed and cried. I mean that\nwas such a wonderful reunion. You have no idea. And, oh I went upstairs to the Helmans and\nthey had food and they sent some food home with me to that place. And I was able to give my\nparents, my sister, some sausage and a few other things. And they told me that they are opening\nan officers billets and they\u2019d like me to come work for them and that\u2019s what exactly happened.\nThey opened the officers billets. I went to work there as a receptionist. And I was really so\ninnocent and so ignorant of everything. I saw balloons laying there. I thought and I was asking\nthe boy the houseboy to give me them for my sister. And he says no, I\u2019m not going to give you\nthat. I said why not. My sister is only 12 years old. I said I want to give her something that she\nhasn\u2019t had in years. And I said I don\u2019t even know if she ever knows what a balloon looks like.\nHe says no I can\u2019t give you that. I was so upset. When I went upstairs to see the Helmans. I\nslept over there by the way. I only went back home on weekends cause the distance was very far\nand I had to walk. There was no transportation. There was nothing. And so I told the Helmans\nwhat had happened. That these beautiful new balloons were laying there. They wouldn\u2019t even\ngive me one for my sister. And they said no you don\u2019t want that. That\u2019s those rubbers that the\nofficers use when they bring in girls and then it dawned on me what it actually was. But that\u2019s\nhow, to show you how innocent and how ignorant I was. And then, from then on in, I was able\nto bring food to my parents and I met a lot of officers up there, GIs and they took us to dances\nand Rosie and I and Siggy they took us to all these dances. But you know every time there was\nbackfire from a truck, I thought it was an explosion. I dove under the under anything and\neverything I could find for protection. And they would just stand there and laugh. I said look\nit\u2019s a very sad experience for me. Don\u2019t laugh. Because to me I feel like I\u2019m being shot at. And\nit took me a long time to get over this backfire. I always thought that I was being shot. And so\nwe went over there and then the rabbi, the chaplain, we had a Passover at one of the\ncommissaries or whatever. He was able to locate a place; that was our very first Passover. And\nwe, in fact I still have their Passover books, the Hagadah in a bound, what the GIs would carry\nwith them. And that rabbi Felden was the very first chaplain that was in 1946, we had our very\nfirst Passover. And I was so nervous. I was so upset about everything. That I, well I was nervous\nto go to a dance. I would break out in hives. I mean completely from top to bottom. And I was\nitching and I was, and then I found out I was allergic to the shellfish that I was eating at the\nHelmans. | didn\u2019t know what I was supposed to eat. Besides that, I wanted to go back just one\nmore time. My mother had pleurisy before we were liberated. And we talked to this a rabbi like\nperson. Maybe it was Mr. Konigsberg. At this point I don\u2019t\u2019 even know who told us. It\u2019s ok to\neat pork. You got to get meat, you got to eat meat. Otherwise, you\u2019 ll never get over this pleurisy.\nAnd my mother didn\u2019t want to. He said look you\u2019Il making, doing a sin more so by not eating\nthan you would be by trying to survive. The thing 1s now survival. And that\u2019s when finally she\nwould eat. We would try to buy some meat for her, not us, for her but she shared with us of\ncourse. We\u2019d buy just the, the like the hoofs or the head or something because we had to cook\nthat up for her and it was the hardest thing for her to do, to eat that. And then finally we got\nvisas and it was in 1948, in February. And we boarded upon an army transport and women in one\nsection, men in another section lined up for the mess hall to eat. We went over Shanghai because\nwe didn\u2019t have, we didn\u2019t\u2019 have any warm clothes so in Shanghai we got some clothes. And\nthen we made it to our San Francisco where our relatives and aunt Ruth. She in the meantime\nafter her husband had passed away, Mr. Binger, she married Ernest Karliner who also adopted\nmy cousin. And they were waiting for us. They had an apartment just across from them. And\nSO We were, we were taken in over there. And I met my husband in the Golden Gate Park. He\nwas seeing a friend of his. We were walking very first week we arrived. We were walking in the\nGolden Gate Park and my husband saw this friend of his that came from Shanghai. And he came\nup to me, up to the where we were and he says oh how about you. I haven\u2019t seen you since\nShanghai. He\u2019s telling his friend. And the friend said oh let me introduce to you Ernie and\nMargie Mijinski and he said to my husband. Now my husband said to me, you know you look\nlike somebody I know. You look somebody like, somebody I know. I said \u201csure I\u2019ve heard that\nline before.\u201d He said \u201cno I mean it. You look like a Mrs. Karliner. I says Karliner, that\u2019s my\naunt.\u201d And he says my goodness, they\u2019ve been telling me about you for years, that if you ever\ncome to the states, I must meet you. And slowly we got together and about, this was in 1948\nwhen we came. And in 1949 I got married.",
        "Q: Margie, because you had people who could sponsor you in the United States, which I assume\nyou still needed even though you had a visa that was supposed to get you to the United States\nfrom 1938. Why did it take so long?",
        "A: Well because it took so long because my mother had German quota. My dad was Polish\nquota. Even though he never really lived in Poland but he was now Katowice, it was Polish.\nAnd the Polish had a very small quota. And so he said you guys go ahead and we would leave\nhim. In fact, in Germany they offered the children to be taken to England and we refused. I said\nI\u2019m not going without you mom and dad and my sister. I\u2019m not leaving. Oh no you take your\nlittle sister with you. I said no way, I\u2019m not. And that\u2019s we stayed together and when we got to\nSan Francisco, my dad got a job as a janitor. I worked, I was trying to sell advertising which I\nhad in my middle I was, after the war I was selling movie slides advertising. And that\u2019s how I\nwas helping to support my parents. And that\u2019s, and then my husband, he had a bakery in\nOakland. So after we got married, I worked in the bakery. So.",
        "Q: What were the hardest things for you and your family to adjust to when you got to the United\nStates?",
        "A: Well we had to get started. We had nothing. Just what the Red Cross had given us. And so\nwe had to get a life again. But we stayed up in the, with furnished apartment where my aunt\nlived on side. We lived on the other same floor. It was very beautiful apartment. And like I said\nI went looking for a job right away. I got a job through an agency in an insurance company. I\nworked there. They promised me they would promote me, promote me but every time three\nmonths were up they put me into another and wouldn\u2019t give me a raise. And after the second\ntime I said forget it. I\u2019m out of here and I left and I had another job and then we got married and\nI moved to Oakland and we are now in the United States already since 1948.",
        "Q: Was it important to you that Ernie had been through a similar experience. Did that have\nanything to do with your choice of him as your husband?",
        "A: It certainly did. I wanted to marry another Jewish man of my background and he was\nsomebody that I really liked. A very gentle, generous caring person. And we\u2019ve been married\n47 years.",
        "Q: Let me ask you one more question. I know we need to stop. How do you think all of this has\naffected the way that you view your life and the way you have lived your life since all of this\nhappened to you and your family and it was such an unusual experience in so many ways. And\nthe last thing I was going to ask you is how did you find out about the fate of the rest of your\nfamily that had stayed in Germany?",
        "A: Never really did. We had to assume. We tried to contact them then through the Aufbau,\nthrough all the different Jewish organizations and there was absolutely no trace of anybody alive,\nnobody. So we had to assume that they all perished because there is nobody, nobody ever\nresponded. The Jewish committee, the HIAS, the Joint. Nobody was able to locate anybody. And\nas far as it having affected me personally. As I have been getting older, it\u2019s been harder and I\u2019m\nnow in therapy. Under a psychologist because things are, they\u2019re really getting to me. And \u2019ma\nvery nervous person and the therapist feels that this all dates back to my young days when I was\ngrowing up. Not enough food. Leaving my grandmother leaving that I think was the hardest part\nof my whole exodus of Germany, having to leave my grandmother, my aunt, my uncle, but my\ngrandmother was the number one. And then I never got to see her again. So that\u2019s about it.",

    "answers": [
        "A: Gletwitz.",
        "A: It was a rather small town. We had one synagogue and a small community. We went to the\nelementary school which was a Jewish school and I went there from first grade until fifth grade\nand that was in 1938. At, I was in the fifth grade. I had some very happy memories and let me\nstart with saying I also had a sister. She\u2019s born October 19 in 1932. That\u2019s the only sibling that I\nhave. My parents and my, rather my father was born in Germany, in Katowice which later on\nbecame Poland. So when he was about 14 years old he left Poland because he didn\u2019t want to be\nunder the Polish rule. His parents however remained there. My mother was born in a very small\ntown and she had one sister and she lived with us in Gleiwitz. Now my grandparents on my\nfather\u2019s, the parents of my father, they remained in Poland and they had 9 children but 2 of them\ndied before and one was killed early. I don\u2019t remember exactly when, when that child was killed.\nI do however know that they were very orthodox and very, very religious and my grandmother\nwould not light any lights on Shabbos. She would carry a handkerchief pinned to her dress and\nhad a head piece which was like sort of a lace bedekom which is something that they wore. And\nshe wouldn\u2019t even turn on the electricity or anything like that. And she had servants, but these\nservants were not even allowed to do that either. So they had to wait from sundown to sundown\nbefore they could eat warm food.",
        "A: My grandmother\u2019s name was Dirka Miyinski and my grandfather was Louis Mijinski. They\nhad a lot of children but I only knew about a couple of them. I remember one aunt. She had\ntwins. Her name was Erna and I don\u2019t remember her last name. There were two boys, twins,\nboys. Then the other aunt was Anna and she had one child when I was in Germany and there\nwas, this the one Anna lived in Germany. The one I just referred to with Erna, she lived in\nPoland, Katowice. Then there was a George, the brother of my dad who was a couple of years\nolder. He also was in Germany. He had one son. So that boy now lives in New York. The other\npeople that I barely know but my grandmother, my maternal grandmother was born in Germany\nas I said. And her name was Anna Zusman. Her maiden name was Hyman and my her husband\nwas the first Jewish locomotive engineer. And he worked his way up from being a coal boy but\nshoveling coal into the engines. And he just went higher and higher until he became an engineer.\nHe loved trains that much that whenever he was on vacation he would stand at the trestle and\nwatch all the trains go by. He just loved it. And my earliest recollection was of him. He had a\nstroke. I was 5 years old at that time. And he was paralyzed completely. And he could speak\nbut nobody could understand by myself. He talked to me about all the trains that he was running\nand all that information which he just loved. And I had a very close relationship with him. And\nbeing the very first grandchild, I\u2019d say my grandmother Anna spoiled me.",
        "A: His name was Beno Zusman.",
        "A: My father was out of town a lot. As a matter of fact he was gone sometimes for weeks at a\ntime. And my mother and her sister and my grandmother were very close and they would take\ntrips together with us children and by the way my aunt Ruth K, her name now was last name was\nKarliner but before that she was married to a Banger and they used to take us to the mountains\nand we had wonderful times. It was like a resort into the mountains which was resort was called\nReinerts. And I don\u2019t really know what kind of mountains they were, but I do remember having\na wonderful time up there with everyone. Climbing and, and using sticks where you put metals\non them telling you what city you were in which I thought fascinating. And it usually was around\nmy birthday. So they would have to kind of sneak the gifts into a suitcase so that they could\nsurprise me when I woke up on my birthday that they would have a present for me. I surely\ndidn\u2019t expect it because I mean we were so far away from home. But they did that for me. And\ngoing back again to, my sister she was born when I was five like I said. And she was born in our\nhouse. Our regular apartment. We didn\u2019t have a house in this case. But she was born and my\ncousin is the same age and she was born about 14 days prior to my sister. And she didn\u2019t tell her\nhusband that she was going to have the baby that soon. So when he came home, that\u2019s my uncle,\nuncle Herbert was his name. It was aunt Ruth\u2019s husband. He came home and he said what are\nyou doing in bed. And she said oh nothing. I didn\u2019t feel that good. She says, go look at the\ncarriage, the doll carriage that Margie has. And he said what. I\u2019ve seen that carriage and the\ndolls a million times before. And she says go take a look and go look at it again. Well finally to\nget him to do that, I urged him on. So I said uncle come look, come look, look at my Suzy. And\nhe looked in there and there was this child. My doll\u2019s name was Suzy so he didn\u2019t know that it\nwas areal child. But it was so funny because he couldn\u2019t get over it, that this little baby was in\nmy carriage. And he had no idea what had happened. And then my sister came a few, exactly\ntwo weeks later. One was, my cousin was on the third of October, my sister was born on the 19\nof October. But my dad was out of town as usual. And he did have an inkling that when he came\nback there would be a child there. And sure enough. In those days you didn\u2019t go to a hospital.\nYou had a midwife. And then I loved playing with the babies you might say because they were\nlike my own doll. And I was able to hold them and play with them. So that kind of grew because\nwhen I was about six years old, my parents put me in charge, my mother put me in charge of\ntaking care of my sister. And I would, I roll her up and down the streets. But then being a young\nkid, you know you kind of forget about what you\u2019re supposed to be doing. And a girlfriend of\nmine would say hey let\u2019s play hopscotch. So I did and the next thing I know my sister falls head\nover onto the cement, screaming, crying and I was so afraid to go back home. I thought oh my\nI\u2019m going to really get it. I came home because my, they could hear. I guess the whole\nneighborhood could hear my sister. She was really upset and a little hurt but not really\ndrastically. And I came home and she was still screaming and my mother says what happened\nwhat happened. And I said she fell kind of with the carriage on the cement. How could you.\nAnd my grandmother said what do you expect a child. She\u2019s still a child herself. You shouldn\u2019t\npunish her. So I got away with that one too. And later on we, where I was living they had\nalways a fair once a year. And that was run by the gypsies and they were living in these house\nwagons lined up along the plaza there. It was like in the, on Fridays they would have a market\nthere. and the rest of the time, at times they would have a fair. They would have carousels and\nbig wheel and that was a big treat for us. And because my sister was too small, we couldn\u2019t\u2019 take\nher and neither could we take our my cousin because she was the same age. And this was maybe\nwhen they were about three or four years old. And one night I remember very well, my aunt\ngoes home. Her daughter was missing and she got a shock of her life. Where could the child have\ngone to. She was gone. We combed the neighborhood. Everybody was running around and\nfinally we located her oh maybe a half a block away. Somebody had seen her walking as a little\nkid in the middle of evening, dark already and they took her in and they said you wait til your\nmom will come. And sure enough she was sitting in the window looking out and when my aunt\ncame by she said oh there\u2019s my mommy. And that was one of the things I really remember.\nVery, very well. I went to the Jewish school and that, that was a wonderful place. When I first\ngot there however, the very first year they asked us for a physical and they had this big hall and\nyou went from one doctor to the next. One was a doctor for general. Then there was a doctor for\nlooking in the eyes. There was a dentist that looked in your mouth. And of course they wanted us\nto be stripped to the waist because they wanted to take our I guess our vitals. Anyway, I wasn\u2019t\nabout to do that. I was too ashamed to show my body. And they said it\u2019s ok, you can do that.\nAnd I said no. I took my clothes and ran down the stairs and I didn\u2019t want to do it. So then the\nteacher came over to my mother and she said did you know that your daughter ran from school\nand my mother said no, why would she do that. And she said well she didn\u2019t want to undress.\nAnd my mother said, well of course. She\u2019s very shameful of showing her body you know. And I\nnever lived that one down. Ever since then, everybody is always laughing about it. The kids used\nto kind of snicker when they saw me. What are you ashamed of. You\u2019re not developed yet or\nanything like that. But it\u2019s I was only about six years old. And I mean to me my body was kind\nof precious and I wasn\u2019t about to show it off to anybody. And anyway, my sister, Eva, her name\nis Eva Renart. I don\u2019t know if I mentioned it prior to this. She went to kindergarten, also a\nJewish kindergarten and she had a wonderful time as well. And as I think back, we, my parents\nwell that is my mother and father if he was in town, and my aunt and her husband, they went to\nthe temple every Saturday faithfully. Of course in those days you didn\u2019t hire any baby sitters,\nyou used the older child. That was me. And I would have to play house and entertain the young\nones. And that was kind of fun because we played house and I was always the mother and they\nwere the children. And of course they had to behave. Otherwise I would punish them and put\nthem in a corner or something like that. And those are really very, very good memories for me\nbecause I enjoyed what I was doing. And then in see we lived in upper Silesia, so we were\nprotected by the Versailles contract or however you want to call it. I\u2019m not sure exactly the\nwording. But until 1935 Hitler could not touch us. But in 1935 Hitler then said no more Jews to\nleave out of the country. So my dad couldn\u2019t go anymore to the in his business to the Polish\nforests and to the Czechoslovakia Russia and so forth. So the Nazis took him for forced labor.\nAnd he was digging ditches and they were there was water accumulated over there. And he got\nquite ill. So in 1938 we did get, in the early part of 1938 we received an affidavit from our\nuncles. That is my grandmother\u2019s brothers who lived in Battle Creek, Michigan. They posted an\naffidavit but when my dad heard that there, you know he had, I don\u2019t know, he was very smart\nman. He had an inkling that things were going, not going to go so well for the Jews. So he\ndecided rather than waiting in Germany we should go ahead and go to another country that\u2019s\naffiliated with the United States, wait there and then as soon as our visa became valid that they\nwould give it to us, then we could go to America. That was the plan. However, that wasn\u2019t\nexactly what took place.",
        "A: Well my grandparents moved in once my grandfather got the stroke. They could not, my\ngrandmother wasn\u2019t able to take care of him. So we had moved into a place that had three\nbedrooms. And one was occupied by my parents. One was occupied by we rented out one and\nthe other one was my grandparents. And my grandmother and my grandfather had a beautiful\nroom and we enjoyed going in there and talking to them. Oh let me tell you something else that\nhappened. When I was about six years old, I think it was something like that. We had Passover\nand my father always wore the white kitle and he was a very, he came from a very orthodox\nfamily. So he wore the white kitle like I said and my grandfather who had a stroke couldn\u2019t get\nup. So he sat there and asked the children. Of course it was us children, so they were still kind of\ntiny and they were just sitting and like in a little not a playpen exactly but something where they\ncould contain them because they were just crawling around at that point. And all of a sudden I\nsaid you know dad, you look like a beggar. Oh, my dad got so upset at me. How dare I say you\nlook like a beggar and my grandfather, my father was so upset at me, my grandfather being he\ncouldn\u2019t speak very well, start in his own way yelling. Well the women all were in the kitchen\ntrying to bring the food out. When they heard my father yelling and my grandfather trying to\nyell and me crying they dumped all the dishes on the kitchen floor. That was my mother, my aunt\nand my grandmother. They came running. What in the world happened. And when we told them\nwhat happened, well it wasn\u2019t a big deal. But to me it was horrible that my dad would get so\nupset that I said that. Our neighborhood where I lived was mostly Catholic or Protestant. I think\nit was more like Catholic. So the girlfriends that I had in our very immediate neighborhood were\nall Christian kids. So but they never made a difference between my being Jewish and themselves.\nAnd they would call us and say come on and play with me. And I would go out and play with\nthem. And until they very day that we left, I never knew that they would even, have a difference.\nSo to me I was accepted as their equal. There was no discrimination. The schooling had to be in,\nI had to go to a Jewish school because I guess maybe the others wouldn\u2019t accept us. I really don\u2019t\nknow why. But I started the first grade and went all the way up to fifth. Like I said before. And\nthat\u2019s the only way there was. But one of the memories I have that also that I loved to dance.\nAnd do gymnastics. So at a very early age, my mother enrolled me into a school for gymnastics\nand I wanted to become a gymnastics teacher. Or a ballerina. Anything that had to do with dance\nor whatever. And I was pretty flexible and I enjoyed it very much. And then we would put on\nplays, like little dances and so forth and with that we would then entertain our congregation. Or\nwe would go to the old age home and perform over there. It was really a lot of fun and my\nmother made sure I had the most beautiful costumes. One of the ones that I really remember is\nthat I was a butterfly and my girlfriend was the flower. So I could dance around a lot. And we,\nthese are just wonderful memories and I had also of course a lot of Jewish girlfriends, that is\nwhen school would let out. I would go over there and play with them and one of the girls had a\nbicycle. Well I didn\u2019t have one. So she would let me ride the bicycle. Well the first time I got\nonto the bike, I headed right straight for the rose bushes. And I came out of there looking and a\nmess, scratched up from head to toe. You might say. But I didn\u2019t care because I had fun. It\ndidn\u2019t matter. I was learning how to ride the bicycle. I did it the hard way perhaps but I got it.\nAnd let\u2019s see what else. The, one of my girlfriends Hannah Weissenberg, she was my very best\nfriend. And she didn\u2019t live all that far away but not in our immediate area, so only time I could\nplay with her was either right after school or when my mother would take me over there and pick\nme up because we just didn\u2019t do that. And as I said before, there was another girl too that I only\nknow now the last name, Richar, was her name. And they went to Israel as far as I know. But I\ncouldn\u2019t be very sure. People left you know, some had left already. The moment in 1935 they\nwould leave and go. But my two girlfriends that I you know I had really close ties with they were\nin Germany as long as I was. Now there was another girlfriend that I had. Her father was very\northodox. Her name is Miana Shy. And she we found her again in the United States but that\nwas a very strange situation. I didn\u2019t even know she would be here. So but let me go, get back to\nthat later. While I was in school I learned English. However it was not the English that people in\nAmerica talk or in the Philippines. It was Oxford English. The eithers and the neithers and the\nlooking glass and all that sort of thing. Well when I left Germany and I went to another school,\nthe kids all made fun of me. Because I didn\u2019t speak like any of them. And they would snicker\nand laugh and like ridicule me. And I felt really bad about that because that\u2019s the only English I\ndid know. But anyway so in like, we can go back to the time we went and got the visa. My dad\nlike I said kind of saw the writing on the wall and he said we\u2019re now leaving. So in Germany you\nhardly bought any dresses ready-made. Everything had to be made. By material and the\ndressmakers and the dressmakers were a few blocks away of course. And so my mother had\nstarted putting things into suitcase because she knew we had to leave in October and this was\nnow around Rosh Hashanah. And during Rosh Hashanah somebody came in and told my parents\nyou'd better get out now. They\u2019re going to be closing the border to France which is Strasbourg.\nSo we rushed out of the temple, the middle of services, went home, started putting things into the\nsuitcases and then we had to call the government official to put a seal on it. Once it was sealed\nyou could not break the seal unless you were outside Germany. So I remember us rushing\nthrough and getting everything ready and which is what my parents did. Then the official came\nand then we had to leave with ten marks in our pocket.",
        "A: Well the only thing is they did not teach Sunday school or Hebrew. So we had to go to the\ntemple for the lessons from the rabbi and the cantor. And we learned the different, we learned all\nabout the holidays and how to keep a kosher household and all that sort of thing. But basically all\nthey really went into the math which is actually German, math and a little bit of geography of\nGermany. But and the English lessons that I had over there because I knew that eventually\npeople were going to be you know going to different countries and they felt that we should learn\nEnglish. We did however, my Hebrew wasn\u2019t all that great. So my dad said that I have to have\nprivate lessons and Mr. Kamm, K-A-M-M. I remember his name. He gave me private lessons in\nHebrew. Well I became pretty good at it so when my dad would go out of town out of the\ncountry, I would have to do the Havdalah. And I must say it went very well because my mother\nsaid go ahead, do it, do it. And I enjoyed that. Because I was the focus point. I mean I was the\nhead of the household at that point. And let\u2019s see what else. It\u2019s very hard to remember all the\ndifferent things. But, oh yes. Hanukah. Was a wonderful time. And I had as I said before, a lot\nof Christian children around me and our house. Well I would go for Christmas always upstairs\nand see their tree and at midnight they would have all these candles and goodies on the tree. And\nI was like I said I was accepted and I would partake with their Christmas celebrations. Well I\ncame down and talked to my mother and father and I said you know we don\u2019t have anything like\nthat. Why don\u2019t we have a Hanukah bush or something like that. Well they didn\u2019t quite go along\nwith that idea. However, my father surprised us as playing Hanukah man. Instead of Santa Claus\nhe was Hanukah man. And he would knock on the door and of course I didn\u2019t know it was my\nfather at that time. And this man would come in with a very stern voice and would say have you\nbeen good this time and of course both my sister and I said, trembling we said of course, yes,\nyes, we\u2019ve been good children. And he said well ok in that case I guess you deserve a gift. And\nhe would have this pillowcase over his shoulder and that\u2019s how Santa Claus\u2019 way and he\u2019d\nimitate the Santa Claus cause I was impressed by that. And so he was a Hanukah man so he had\nto imitate more or less the Catholics how they, the Christians how they handled things which was\nkind of cute. And I only found out after I was a practically a teenager that was my father cause\nhe never was there and I couldn\u2019t figure out. I mean he was there a couple of minutes. I\u2019d go\nwhere did he go. And then the bell rings and I didn\u2019t put two and two together. So it was really\nneat. I really enjoyed that. And I think that\u2019s I\u2019m trying to remember. It is so, so much happened.",
        "A: The same teachers taught my mother. And so naturally where the mother was taught I had to\ngo and that was how, I never questioned it. It just seemed a natural thing that Miss Stantur was\nmy mother\u2019s teacher and she was, became my teacher. And of course she always compared me\nto my mother. My mother must have been, I was very timid though. I really didn\u2019t do things that\nmost kids, I was very good. But sometimes you know maybe I was quite as good as my mother\nused to be. And she would tell my mother go to my mother and say, oh you know your daughter\ndid this and this and this. And I mean really I was my own person. I couldn\u2019t change me to my\nmother. My mother was very lenient. My father on the other hand, he was very strict. I mean if\nyou didn\u2019t throw the mark, I mean forget it. I mean he would, he was quick with the hand too.\nAnd my goodness whenever he hit, he had big hands. I mean the man was over 200 pounds and\nyeah, I was a little girl. You know and my mother would threaten us every time when he would\nbe out and she\u2019d say I\u2019m making notes. He will know all about what you\u2019re doing so when he\ncomes you will get punishment. And that was about it.",
        "A: To be a good Jew. I mean (no sound)",
        "A: My mother was very lenient and she would get upset with us and she would warn me\nespecially because I was the oldest that if I was not going to behave she was going to make notes\nand when dad would come back, then I would be punished. And that scared me enough that from\nthen on and I was a pretty good girl and we had a lot of fun. I mean I can\u2019t say that any of that\nwas bad. But my grandmother spoiled me. I didn\u2019t like, like for example on Friday afternoons\nfor midday was our big meal. And of course Shabbos was a big, big, big thing in our house so\nduring the noon hours we would have like maybe rice and cinnamon or something, a very light\nmeal. Well I didn\u2019t like that at all, so my grandmother would make me a soup, chicken soup and\nput some things in there so I would have something warm. And then came the evening. I didn\u2019t\nlike the beef because I don\u2019t care for boiled beef. I never did, I don\u2019t know. Well maybe\nnowadays I might but not really. So she would always have like a little squab or I should make\na something that I would like, special vegetables, special this, special that and my parents didn\u2019t\nreally approve of that because this is just spoiling her. And she said well she\u2019s my one and only\nand she, I love her. And my grandmother would, we were always doing things together. In fact\nour friends and relatives, everybody called us the bride and groom because we were always\ntogether. Like I said my grandma and I had a wonderful relationship and when I had to leave\nGermany and leave her behind, that was really one of the hardest things I had to do. I didn\u2019t\u2019\ncare so much about my aunt and uncle that were there who I loved dearly too but my\ngrandmother and I had a wonderful relationship. As a matter of fact, when my grandfather died,\nI moved into the room with her. So the two of us shared a room. And at night she would have\nsome chocolate and of course I had to have it. And none of the others did but I got it. So when I\nwould go like during vacation, during say Easter vacation, Passover vacation, I would go to a\ngirlfriend in Boyden, Germany. That was oh not that far away but it was far enough. For me\nevery distance was far actually. And I would stay there for a few weeks and I would have to buy\nher always the same chocolates that she loved which was a coffee liquor filled chocolate. And\nshe loved those so whenever I went to Boyden, I had a little money saved up. I would buy that\nfor her so I could bring it back to her. And she appreciated it so much. Well, that\u2019s the least I\ncould do for her goodness to me all the time. And, and then my cousin oh she was a little, she\nwould, she did things like let me tell you what she did. Like I told you, she ran away when we\nwere always having a we didn\u2019t have baby sitters in those days, so my auntie put her to bed. But\nnow let me tell you what happened at Passover. Just prior to Passover she was naughty so my\naunt locked her into a little room I mean off the kitchen. I mean not for long. But all of a sudden\nshe hears this crash bang and oh she\u2019s like what has she done now. So she opened up and my\ncousin Suzie had broken every egg that there was for Passover. She had just gotten so upset that\njust kind of stomped on them or threw them about. I don\u2019t really know what she did. But she\ndestroyed every egg. So my auntie had to start from scratch. And, oh go ahead.",
        "A: My well it didn\u2019t really, really come to my attention. However, my mother and my sister and I\nwould go to Katowice to visit my great, my grandparents in Poland. And one time when she\nwent and then came back she got a letter that you have to come to the police station, that you\nwere carrying contraband. And I said what in the world. I wouldn\u2019t carry anything that wasn\u2019t\nlegal. And apparently they had found a sausage that my mother had brought from Poland to\nGermany and that too wasn\u2019t allowed. And so they had a, I mean we were scared that they would\ntake her to a concentration camp or something, that you know going to really punish her and\nthank the, thanks be to God. Nothing really happened. She was able to explain that it was a gift\nfrom my in-laws and that it was just a gift and that she hadn\u2019t even bought it. With German\nmoney or whatever. And that she didn\u2019t\u2019 have any contraband. She had no money that belonged\nto Poland or anything. We knew better than that. So those are things that stuck in my mind that\nshe was so upset and the whole family was upset when that happened. But my girlfriends,\nnobody we didn\u2019t we didn\u2019t really have that big a problem with the stores or anything like that. it\nwas just the government took my father to work in the ditches and my dad was coming home\nvery, feeling not well. He was having pains. I guess kidney, already then problems. And for\nme, really nothing really, really happened that I could remember that was a difference.",
        "A: No I think they tried to shield us from all that. No, I, I don\u2019t\u2019 ever remember them saying\nmuch of anything and we still had our Jewish doctor that we went to. And until the time we left\nthere was really no major problems. In fact one of my Christian girlfriends wanted to come to\nthe depot the railway station and my parents said better not. That\u2019s how close we all were. Cause\nthere was really, like I said, I myself did not feel it. And they kept it from us. They did not want\nto share because this was very disturbing and they didn\u2019t want to put us into that. My sister Eva,\nshe was a very timid person. She was shy and but she loved to eat. Oh boy did she love to eat.\nAnd whenever we would go, we would go visiting people like friends of ours and they would put\nout the coffee and the cake. For the children special little goodies. She would say oh, she\nwouldn\u2019t ask right out you know. And before we left, my mother always gave us something to\neat because she loved to eat. And I was a very poor eater as a matter of fact. And my, my food\nwas they had to put it on a chair with a little stool and they would put a lot of butter on it because\nI didn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t eating enough as far as they were concerned. So I hate the butter. So they\ndidn\u2019t\u2019, they didn\u2019t give me a knife or anything So they always knew where I sat because I\nwould take the butter off on the edge of the plate. And I would go around like that. so that\u2019s why\nI guess maybe my grandmother was spoiling me a little bit With the squab and all that stuff, veal\ncutlets and because I was a very poor eater. Now not my sister. We would go to these people\nand she had the full tummy. And we would go there and she would just look at my mother and\nshe said you know I haven\u2019t had that in a long time. And of course the people would feel so sorry\nfor her and they would say oh poor Eva. Sure, help yourself, take something. It was so\nembarrassing for my mother. She would get so red in the face. She would say like I don\u2019t feed\nher anything, but it wasn\u2019t true at all. She just had a very good appetite. And I was, going back\nto when I was saying, playing house with them you know. My little cousin I told you 1s this little\ndevious person. I mean she was just, I mean she was always into things. And all of a sudden my\nsister would start crying. I said why are you crying, Eva, what happened. Suzie. And I didn\u2019t see\nanything. She said but she did and my cousin was so sneaky, Suzie. She was so sneaky, she\nwould either drop something on the ground on the floor or pretend that she\u2019s picking it up. At the\nsame time she\u2019s pinching my foot or leg or something on my sister or behind my back. I think it\nwas really something. Keeping those two apart was a major, major problem. When I walked\nwith them, I had to keep one on the left and one on the right, I mean at arm\u2019s length. I couldn\u2019t\neven bring them together. But like I said my sister followed me everywhere. Well one time we\nwere a bunch of kids were playing. Down in the we had meadows, very pretty meadows near,\nnearby and oh like across the street and we lived in the newer portion of Gleiwitz. It was a lovely\nplace. And we stepped outside and then there was this big meadow on both sides. Beautiful. So\nkids are you know they take, I learned how to throw knife. Pocket knife. That\u2019s a boys\u2019 game but\nI played with everybody. Wasn\u2019t just girls, it was boys too. I was only maybe ten years old at\nthat time. So I said to Eva I said why don\u2019t\u2019 you run and get me a knife so I can play also. So\nshe runs up the hill and she comes back. While she\u2019s running down, she falls and she cuts\nherself. Oh my goodness. Here she is bleeding. I think that she\u2019s dying because she\u2019s crying like\nyou know there\u2019s no tomorrow. And of course again I had to take her home and again my\ngrandmother said not her. I mean we should have covered in something so she wouldn\u2019t fall\nbecause she was carrying it and running. But she was trying to do me a favor, the, my little sister\nso like I said it was of her I was in trouble more than for my own sake. But hey, that\u2019s all right. I\nmean she was five years younger than I was. I mean after all I was a big sister you know. I had to\nreally do whatever I was supposed to do. But sometimes I\u2019d forget it and did what I, what any\nyoung kid would do. But it matured me. I\u2019d say that much it did. And where, I don\u2019t know now\nwhere.",
        "A: My father as you know was in the lumber business. And when he asked, you know he asked\naround and nobody knew what to do. So when he went to the consulate, American Consulate he\nasked where could I go and practice my profession. They said well I don\u2019t\u2019 know but why don\u2019t\nyou try the Philippines. It\u2019s not a bad place. Why don\u2019t\u2019 you go there and then from there you\ncan come to the states. So with that in mind, jungles and all this when I heard jungles, oh boy\nmy mind went wild. I thought oh boy I could play with the monkeys. I could play with the lions.\nI could play with all, I was animal lover from way back. As a matter of fact, I used to walk a dog\njust to, to be near a dog. I loved animals from way when I was a little girl. And the woman\nwould be happy to give me her dog, the big German shepherd and I would play, but that was my\nprotection and nobody could come near me. So when they said jungle I was all enthused. I\nthought jungle, great. You know I\u2019Il be having the beach right there and then I walk a few feet\nand I\u2019d be living on the outskirts of the jungle. And my dad would go into the jungle. Maybe he\ncould bring me back a wild animal or something like that. Well it didn\u2019t quite turn out that way,\nbut I didn\u2019t know that. We didn\u2019t even know where the Philippines was. All I knew was that you\nhad to go over the ocean and that you had to take a ship and so my parents tried to I guess maybe\nmake it nicer than it really would have been. And I don\u2019t think they really had much of an idea\neither. All, All my dad knew he might have a good job over there.",
        "A: My dad would go into the woods, into the forest and estimate the footage of the trees to be\ncut. He had a wonderful mind. He never used to calculate it for anything. He could just but he\ndidn\u2019t need a calculator. His mind worked so well that all he looked at a tree and he estimated\nand my goodness and that was how it was. I mean he was, he had a fabulous mind. And he knew\nthat if he went into the Philippines he would go into the jungle, would go in and cut some, tell\nthem how to cut the trees and how much footage you\u2019d get out of it. And with that in mind he\ndecided we\u2019 ll go to the Philippines and so there we would wait for our visa to the States and that\nwould be wonderful. Didn\u2019t quite happen.",
        "A: My parents wouldn\u2019t tell us. Didn\u2019t tell me at all. All they said, I guess they were afraid that\nif I made a remark to one of my Christian friends, they all had to somehow belong to the Nazi\nparty or you know things like that, because in those days, when a boy reached a certain age, or a\ngirl for that matter, they had to join the Junge, Jungefrau and, and it was like a Boy Scouts.\nHowever, you\u2019ve seen them in the movies and they had to join. And it really could have been\nvery, very hard on my parents if I said something so they really didn\u2019t want to confide in us too\nmuch because if I, 1f any of us would have said something wrong that when we mentioned the\nfact that we were going to the Philippines, everybody said you\u2019re crazy. Why the Philippines.\nWait here til your visa comes. What\u2019s your rush. And my father said well I don\u2019t like the way\nthings are going. Stores are already a little bit discriminating and I found that all out afterwards.\nNothing was told to us at that point. But people all thought that he was out of his mind. So my\naunt, my uncle, the whole family stayed behind. My grandmother didn\u2019t want to leave because\nshe had a pension from her husband being a locomotive engineer. So she said why should I give\nup everything to go into a country that we know nothing about. I mean if yeah, could I would\nsay I go straight to the United States that\u2019s one thing. But to go into a country. They did say\ntropics. They did say don\u2019t bring any warm clothing. Just get light clothing. So the dresses and\nall that was what we had was just light clothing. And they said that we could take a bicycle. But\nthen we didn\u2019t know also what to pack. My mother had visions of maybe she couldn\u2019t get any\nsoap so she brought boxes of the, like you have here Tide and all that sort of thing. And she took\nthat along. And my dad was in those days we had a very musical family. My dad played the\nviolin. My mother played the piano and my aunt Ruth sang. So we always had a trio but I didn\u2019t\nget to do any of that. So when we talked about leaving, 1t was oh why, why, what is your rush\nyou know. Stay, a little longer. And so my dad said no. And he booked passage on a French\nsteamer. That meant we had to go through France and but when they told us remember when we\nwere in the temple and told us that we had to leave right then and there. We had the suitcases\nsealed and we said our goodbyes and we took off.",
        "A: Yes it was because we went, we had an affidavit. However before we could even get the visa\nto the Philippines we had to put down like $500. That was a lot of money in those days. And that\nshould see us through whatever comes in the next year or so that we would not be a burden to\nanybody. No other government. And with that we were able to get the visa to go to the\nPhilippines. And that was how we finally got that and then we left on a train and went over\nStrasbourg. And my mother started to cry and I thought you know that she\u2019s just upset because\nshe left her family there. And which was very traumatic for her. Because her sister and her were\njust very close. They were just a couple of years apart. And so and my grandmother of course.\nSo then we got past the as we get to Strasbourg, the German government, the officials come up\nand they said let\u2019s open your suitcases. We want to see what you have in there and so my mother\nopened up the suitcase. They broke the seal rather and then she opened up and they kind of went\nthrough it. And then they said everything is ok and close up again and go on. And this was the\nsame train that left our home, town of Gleiwitz. It was going all the way to Paris. Well after we\npassed into France my mother was very hysterical by this time. So I asked her, I said if you\u2019re\nmissing your sister so much, I can be your sister. I\u2019m old enough. I\u2019m 11 years old. And that\nmade her cry even more. But then she told me that while they were sealing and she had\nforgotten to take the money out for the dresses. And those German marks in the clothing. And if\nthey had caught her, she would have been in jail and they would have thrown away the key. I\nmean that was going against every, everything so they just the customs was very strict in those\ndays anyway. Especially the Germans. Only let you take ten marks. Well we\u2019re supposed to\nlive with ten marks, that\u2019s 40 marks the four of us for this was in the early part of September and\nour ship didn\u2019t leave until about, I think almost like three weeks later. So we went, the first time\nwe came into Paris when we got to Paris, the cab driver took us, we said yes take us to a hotel.\nHe drove around and around and around. That was number one. Charged an exorbitant amount.\nThen he took us to this hotel. It was $50, dollars, 50 marks, whatever the currency to francs a\nday. Well that depleted the money that we were able to take from Germany. Thank god for the\nfew dollars. Well pretty soon that money ran out too. And we had to eat and of course we only\nstayed in the hotel one day. We went to another building that about 3 or 4 stories up. And they\ndidn\u2019t even have a toilet up there. All you had to do in France. On each floor they had one, one\nof those things where you kind of squat on a hole. And the only toilet we had was on the ground\nfloor. Well we had never seen anything like this or had even been close to something like that.\nSo it was, that part was really very traumatic for us. How, not to have a toilet. I mean that was\nunheard of in Germany. Anyway so here we were now without money. And we didn\u2019t want to\nbe burdened with the Jewish HIAS or whoever Joint, whoever was there. So my mother\nsomehow made mention in a letter to my grandmother. So she said go to this insane asylum.\nThere is the son of a friend of mine which, the mother always sends money to him. And he will\ngive you the money and I in turn will give her the money in Germany. And that\u2019s what we did\nbut let me tell you. Going to the insane asylum was a horrible feeling. All these people that were\neither crying or singing and pretending to holding a baby and some came up to us and pulling us\nand didn\u2019t\u2019 want us to go and it was just that part was really very bothersome. Then we talked to\nthe man. He sounded as normal as anybody else. As you and I. well the reason he was in the\ninsane asylum was because he had taken a dip in the river Seine and he was naked. It was\nevening and he didn\u2019t think anybody would see him. Well lo and behold, they got him and they\nsaid anybody that does that has to go to the insane asylum. So that was where we got our money.\nAnd then we were in Paris for about ten days I would say. And but we didn\u2019t go and eat all the\ntime. I mean there was no way for us to go and eat. We couldn\u2019t afford it. so we\u2019d buy the bread\nand get some cheese and we\u2019d eat upstairs in the room or whatever we rented.",
        "A: No, these were French Jewish people that we met when we went to buy the bread. This\nhappened to be a Jewish bakery or she just worked there. I really don\u2019t know. AII I know is that\nmy parents went to talk and she spoke German and so that kind of made a bond but the woman\nof course never offered us any money. And then we asked where could we have a good dinner\nor lunch or something but we\u2019d like a kosher restaurant. So she told us where to go for a kosher\nrestaurant. Other times we, it was a treat for us to go like a cafeteria type thing, where you helped\nyourself and you could take your milk or whatever and for us that was something new. We\nnever had anything like that in Germany. SO we stood there like we didn\u2019t know what to do. So\nthe French people came up to us and we didn\u2019t speak French of course which was another\nhardship, so we had to find always somebody that might be able with motions and things like\nthat and I do remember one time though we had gone on a subway. We were going to go\nsomeplace and my father said we\u2019re getting off at the next stop. Well I was the first one at the\ndoor and I jumped out and I look around. As I\u2019m looking the doors are closing and my parents\nare on the subway still. Well here\u2019s this 11 year old kid, doesn\u2019t know any word of French.\nDoesn\u2019t know where she exactly is but I thought well if I go up the stairs and walk backwards,\nback over towards the other station but of course I didn\u2019t know which was way but I kind of had\na hunch. So I was pretty good with locations. So I started walking and I see my mother and my\nfather. My mother was crying. Oh thank God we found you. Thank God we got you back. I said\nwhat\u2019s the big deal. I knew I had to walk towards the station. Yeah but how did you know. I said\nwhat, I don\u2019t know, I just knew it. But anyway so that was quite an ordeal for everybody\nbecause they thought they\u2019d lost me and I thought I\u2019d lost them. What would I do? but as it\nturned out it was fine. So you see, I\u2019m a survivor. From way back. Go ahead.",
        "A: I think my dad. My dad had this he had really special qualities and whenever we would talk\nand we\u2019d get a few times you know when he could sit down and talk to us, I think he was the\nmost important influence on my maturing that quickly and also being having his ideas and things\nlike that. But I don\u2019t know whether it was really all of him. It might be my grandparents too I\nwould say. My grandmother was a very self-sufficient woman. And she did all the how shall I\nsay she did all the planning and everything else. She was the matron. And she whatever she said\neverybody did. She was avery wise woman also. But I\u2019m sorry to say she wasn\u2019t wise enough\nto leave with us. Which I had hoped she might do. But anyways so here we are now in France\nand the time has come for us to go to Marseilles where the ship 1s. Well while we were in France\nthere were no other refugees like ourselves that we had met or seen or anything. We couldn\u2019t\u2019\neven go like I said we, Yom Kippur. We spent Yom Kippur in Paris. But we couldn\u2019t\u2019 even get\nto a temple for some reason. Then I don\u2019t know why. That part I don\u2019t remember. But anyway\neverything was kind of a new, new thing to me so we took the train and went to Marseilles. We\nchecked into somebody must have told us which hotel to check into and we had to wait three\ndays for our vessel, ship to come and was the President Dorme. While we were in Marseilles,\nwe met this young, very young couple. They had just gotten married before they left Germany all\nby themselves. So this lady looked up to my mother as her mother. And she asked my mother a\nlot of questions. How do you do this and what do you do with this. So my mother has kind of\nreared her you might say because she was so lost the poor thing. She had, she didn\u2019t know\nanything and her name was Margot Friedlander. And his name was Heinrich Friedlander. Well\nanyway so we get finally, the ship arrives. And it was a great big passenger ship. Of course to us\nkids who had never seen a steamer, never seen anything. We come from a very small town, as I\nmentioned. And oh in Paris, I saw my first black people. I had never seen anybody but white\npeople because there were, we were too far away from everything. But in Marseilles there were\na number of other nationalities . And when we finally got on board the ship, we realized oh there\nare more children. There was one was Margot Kassel and Biata Zuskind and Biata was a\nsmaller child. And my sister was going to have a birthday on that trip. It would have been\nOctober the 19\". All right. so my mother bought a cake for her at one of the bakeries in\nMarseille and very, didn\u2019t show it to my sister, cause it was only next port would be Port Said.\nAnd her birthday was on the day of Port Said. That we arrived in Port Said. Well I think that\u2019s\nthree days away, board the ship the 16\". And while going down the gangplank into Port Said, all\nthese beggars\n(end file 1)\n(file 2 \u2014 RG-50.106.0052.02.03 \u2014 duration: 01:03:21)",
        "A: Well my sister being very generous at all times, my mother presented her the cake on board\nand we were going to have it for dessert. Well we come across this beggar on the street. My\nsister turns around, runs back up onto board. We didn\u2019t know why she was running back and we\ncalled her and she was already up the gangplank and already gone, comes back with the cake.\nShe\u2019s giving it to the beggar. And my mother just having fits. She just said this was your cake\nEva, what are you giving away? That poor man has nothing to eat. So my mother, what did she\ndo. She took some money. Gave the money to the beggar and took the cake back which we had\nafter all. But that\u2019s how Eva is. She will take off her shirt and give it to you. Very, very soft\nhearted person. Anyway so on board ship we met a lot of other refugees. Like I said Margot\nKassel was my sister\u2019s age and Bi, Biata Zuskind she was a younger, she was about maybe\nthree years old at that time, two or three years old. And things were pretty good but I don\u2019t like,\nI didn\u2019t know any French food. And for me to start eating French food when I\u2019m used to the\nregular kosher German kitchen, you know was quite a change. So I said and I did say something\nto my dad. I don\u2019t remember exactly what, but he said my reply was well I\u2019m going to write to\nmy grandmother because she will have to know how I am treated on here. You are treating me\nnot well at all. I told my dad. Uh oh. That was the wrong thing to say, of course. So he said you\njust dare do that. Make a heart more heavy than she already has. I mean the poor woman has just\nlost a daughter, her granddaughter, granddaughters and now you want to write a letter and tell\nher how miserable things are here. You better not. Well he was right. Of course, I didn\u2019t but\nneedless to say I would never have hurt my grandmother in any, any kind of a way. so I had to\nadjust to the food. But you know I missed my tomatoes. Oh I love tomatoes and pickles and\nthings like that. So there was one gentleman that was in the, working in the kitchen and I\nmentioned it to him. They all spoke some German. And I told him that I really missed having a\nfresh tomato. Guess what. At dinner he brought me a fresh tomato. That was the best meal I can\nremember. And every meal we had wine as well but of course children never drank the wine but\nthe food was so different than what I had known that it took quite an adjustment and then we\nwent from Port Said, we went over to Porti. Oh, Suez Canal. Let me not forget the Suez Canal\nwhich was a very exciting experience. You could see across the bank and you could see\nbuildings. I mean buildings, I would say more like pyramids. And you see the Arabs and I mean\nit was so close. It was just a very thrilling experience and dad said you\u2019d better remember this\nvery well. This may be your last time you\u2019re going to go through Suez Canal. This is something\nthat is very, very important for you to know. So we really stayed on board and looked at\neverything. And then we came to Djibouti and somebody wanted to buy my sister from my\nmother. They said oh she is so cute. My sister had blond hair, blue eyes and curly hair. I mean\nshe was very adorable. And they, the woman wouldn\u2019t give up. She wanted to buy my sister. My\nsister said no, she\u2019s not for sale. And then so then we were afraid that she was going to take her\nSO we were always around her. I mean it was like until we left, you know we had to watch her\nevery second because we really thought that she might kidnap her or something. And then we\nwent to Singapore. Singapore was just beautiful. It was absolutely lovely. But hot. It was so hot\nand we just came from Germany and we are in autumn already in Europe. And we come over\nthere and it was, I mean we were not used to the heat. Of course. But anyway we did take a walk\nand strolled in a little bit on the pier and then it was too much. And we had to turn back to the\nship. So we never really got to see Singapore. And then from there my next recollection was\ngetting to Saigon. Now Saigon my dad bought himself a beautiful one of those tropical helmet\ntype things and he looked really chic and he wore that on deck all the time. But in Saigon we\nstayed there two days. We had French legionnaires on board. And these poor guys didn\u2019t have\nwine or anything so the men at our table took the wine from our table and took it over there to\nthese guys. And they were so happy to have something that like wine for the French. You know\nhow that, it is. So they were so happy. But before I even get that far. Let me say something else.\nFor days, there were, the people, the officers on the ship said \u201cKeep an eye on the back of the\nship. We have a line out. We hope to catch a whale.\u201d Oh boy. With us kids, we were always\nchecking the line that was hanging out of the back of the ship. And we\u2019d see it trailing you know.\nBut nothing is happening, nothing is happening. One day finally there was a big thing, intercom\nand attention, attention. We caught whale. I want most, everybody on board, children first. Let\nthem see the whale. Before we cut the whale open. So oh boy. I mean we were in the lounge as\na matter of fact, in the ladies lounge, washing our hands and everything else. And we run upstairs\nto the deck where the line was. And there was this long fish, dripping water still, black fish, very\nimpressive, big huge thing. And they said well now all the girls, all the kids are here. There\nweren\u2019t that many children on board because this was a luxury liner really and was dropping off\nthe legionnaires to Saigon. And so it was very, very exciting. So we all rushed up there and were\nstanding with bated breath. Now they\u2019re going to cut the fish open, going to see what\u2019s inside the\nfish. And the captain come out and has this big knife and he cuts it open. And you know what\nfalls out. Candies. Oh it was, we had crossed I guess the dateline. I am not sure what exactly\nwhat happened. But it was so thrilling. All these candies fell out and they were green and\ndifferent colors, mainly green that represent the eggs I guess in the whale or whatever. I don\u2019t\nknow. But it was so funny. And, oh he said take all the candy you want. Of course, we kids,\ncandy. We all grabbed hands full and then of course there were other passengers took it too.\nSo this is one of my very memorable experiences we had on the ship. Other than that I mean that\nwas really nothing much happening.",
        "A: No the only people were from Germany and they were the only refugees. And like I said there\nwas only this one young family. And this one family with the daughter Margot and the one with\nZuskind. That was the other one. That I believe was all there was on the ship, as far as Jewish.\nAnd the other ones, I don\u2019t, there were French people going to Singapore, Saigon, really not a\nwhole lot of people but we only knew about ours. And I did not mention this but the men slept\nseparately from the women. So we had in our cabin was this young woman that was just\nmarried, my mother and my sister and I, four of us. And in dad\u2019s cabin there were also four men.\nSo they had for some reason, I don\u2019t know. I guess they didn\u2019t have the facilities to\naccommodate us because we were the refugees but we did pay for the passage already in\nGermany. And I believe the HIAS was helping us. But I\u2019m not quite sure. I never did question\nthem how, when and where and what. All I know is that we had the money that we had to put\ndown in Breslau to the American consulate and vouch that we would never be a burden to any\ngovernment.",
        "A: We did and it all over Juden ok. And by that time we were stateless. We did not have any\nmore a home, so we were considered stateless. And in Singapore, my sister and were always on\ndeck looking around and you know kids, there was nothing more for us to do really. There were\nno movies. If there were, they would have been in French. We would never have understood\nanyways, so us children kind of had to devise our own games and _ talk and do things like that. So\nI was looking into the hold of the ship, I see that our box that we had our furniture in, our\nfurniture. I would say like bicycle and soap that my mother was bringing along and things like\nthat. Oh, the few goblets of crystal. I mean painstakingly wrapped. It was a big wooden box,\nthey called them lifts in those days. And that had broken open. And with all of those natives\nthere, I was so afraid they were going to take it all and we wouldn\u2019t have anything left when we\ngot to the Philippines. So I told my sister, I said you watch while I go run and find dad so he can\nget ahold of the captain to make sure that they get it covered up again. Or nail it together,\nwhatever it takes. Cause I don\u2019t\u2019 want to lose all our stuff. So she was standing on top there\nlooking down. And I found my father pretty soon. And I said come quick, come quick. Look\nwhat\u2019s happened. So he ran and got the captain and they went down in the hold and they were\nable to get our stuff together. But that is how we reached the Philippines. The soap had spilled\nout onto the bicycle. The bicycle had rusted away. So by that time we really didn\u2019t have a\nbicycle. We didn\u2019t\u2019 have much of soap. I mean a lot of stuff was ruined regardless you know.\nBut anyways so that was in Saigon. And on the way from Saigon to Hong Kong came the\ntyphoon. Everybody was sick. Everybody was sick. We couldn\u2019t go to the dining room. And oh\nmy dad\u2019s hat flew away that he just so painstakingly bought in Saigon. Went overboard and it\nwas gone. He was more upset about that than I think anything else because it was such a nice\nhelmet type thing that they wore in the Orient you know. Anyway so we were too sick to eat.\nBut my dad was at the table, eating. I mean we could never understand how could you eat. We\nwere so sick that the doctor had to give us medications because we couldn\u2019t hold food down and\nwe couldn\u2019t eat. I mean it was horrible and I mean, all the passengers were sick. Except my dad\nand this young guy that had just gotten married. The two of them had the whole dining room to\nthemselves. And they had all the food they wanted. And they had to put the plates into containers\nwhich were bolted to the tables. Otherwise they would be sliding this way and sliding that way.\nBut we finally made it into Kowloon which is Hong Kong China. But we had to stay in Kowloon\nbecause that\u2019s where the ship docked. Now we needed shots in Kowloon because we didn\u2019t get\nthe malaria and, and that, whatever the tropical diseases were. So we had to go to this Chinese\ndoctor who had an office in this building. The staircase was so narrow and so dark that we could\nhardly see where we were going. Well my imagination was oh my god he\u2019s going to abduct us\nand we\u2019re not going to go get anywhere and we\u2019re going to be sold as slaves or something like\nthat. Like I said I had a very vivid imagination. And we made it up the stairs. Got our shots,\ncame back down and we were all kind of (sniffs) like this you know. We were kind of crying\ncause it was hurting. And my dad said all right, I had a, I couldn\u2019t take my big doll from\nGermany but I was able to take the smaller version. And I loved that doll. Of course I had to\nname her Suzie also, naturally because I left my Suzie one in Germany so this was also Suzie. So\nhe said how about we buy Suzie a dress. Well that was a big deal so I went with him to, with my\nparents into this beautiful store that had all embroidered things. And I said I showed them the\ndoll and they said we\u2019ve got the thing for you. They gave me this beautiful dress for my doll. Oh\nit was absolutely gorgeous. All kinds of embroidery and all it was so pretty. So now I had a\ndress. And we stayed in a very pretty hotel in Hong Kong and the food, I guess I had gotten used\nto eating almost anything because if you\u2019re hungry you\u2019|l have to eat. And so I did eat French.\nNow I was going to experience Chinese food. Which was again something different, but noodles\nI liked so that was ok. We ate a lot of noodles. And we did take a trip also over to Hong Kong\nwhich is by ferry boat which was kind of exciting for us as well. So we were a few days in, I\ncan\u2019t remember exactly the how many days we were in Hong Kong. But then we were on our\nway to the Philippines on a not with a passenger ship which I thought we would have. No. We\nhad to leave the ship and go on a freighter, a small freighter and there we were all in one cabin\ntogether. But my dad always liked to have the round window, the portholes opened because he\nliked it. So while dad was there and he had his mouth open one of us kids, I guess probably it\nwas me, took a raisin and threw it in his mouth and he thought it was a fly. And he started\ncoughing and screaming and yelling. I swallowed a fly, I swallowed a fly. But then we\nlaughed and he says what happened. What did you guys do. And you know how kids do pranks\nlike that. So we told him, it was only a raisin. Well the next day he was sleeping again, the\nwindow open again. This time a big wave came and he thought we\u2019re drowning. He\u2019s\nscreaming we\u2019re drowning, we\u2019re drowning. Why don\u2019t we all jump. You know he thought for\nsure we were drowning. As it was, a wave had come into the cabin on top of him. And all he\ncould he was breathing. I mean he had been sleeping and all of a sudden he was like d, you know\nbeing drenched with this ocean water. And so that was another experience that we won\u2019t forget,\nbecause he thought for sure we were drowning. Well anyway we make it finally to Manila and\nwe",
        "A: Hmm. Mmm. Ok we left Marseilles around the, I would say the 16\" yeah, 16\" of October and\nwe did not get the, between all that, we did not get to Manila til the 16\", no, 14 of November. I\ndid forget to mention something and now it came at just now I had a loss of memory again but\nit'll get back to me, ok. And we were met at the docks by the Jewish committee and they took us\nto a hotel in the walled city. The walled city is called Intramuros and that is a very old. That\nwas because of the Spaniards and the Spanish were occupying Manila. That was a fortress and\nso this time you know it was very exciting to be living in something like that and, but they\nwarned us don\u2019t leave any food out. Because of the rats that go around these old buildings. Oh\nmy gosh. Now we are afraid of rats as well. I mean I love animals, but I don\u2019t\u2019 think Id like rats.\nSo we would take food upstairs but have to wrap it in linen napkin, very well. And they still got\nto it. So we still all the food we brought upstairs was eaten you know nibbled on during the night\nby these stupid rats. And we only stayed there like 3 days. And then the Jewish committee said\nwe'll give, tell you where you can go and rent something. So we rented the upstairs of a house.\nDownstairs was a Filipino dentist. And upstairs was for us refugees. My parents, other people I\ndon\u2019t even remember their names very well but every room was occupied by a different family.\nAnd one, then we had a single bachelor and he had to sleep outside on the sofa because we just\nran out of room. And this man gets up the next morning and he says he yelled at us. He says you\nkids are playing tricks on me again. Apparently somebody played a trick on him on one of the\nships where he came from. And we don\u2019t know which ship he came on because there were quite\na few refugees at that time, already. Anyhow so he accused us of taking his pants and hiding\nthem. Well we didn\u2019t do that. so everybody started looking for his pants because he said, how I\ncan\u2019t even get out of bed you know. So finally somebody looked down. AII the windows in the\nPhilippines had bars by the way because a lot of robberies took place. So we looked down and\nsure enough on the ground were his pants. And so we kids went and got them. And how in the\nworld did they do that. We asked the dentist downstairs. Oh he said easy. They are on a tree,\nwhich is a ways away but same level as your upstairs, up, apartment is and he said they just take\na fishhook, fish line, hook the pants bring them out, take the money and leave the pants. That\u2019s\nexactly what they did. They took all of his money. They took his papers and everything else but\nthey left his pants. So that was our one experience.",
        "A: A far cry from Germany, a very far cry. There were palm trees, all right with coconuts on\nthem. And the Filipinos would climb up the tree and throw down the coconuts for us. And we\ncould crack them open, but first they had a green hull around them which had to be stripped, but\nthey all carried knives, bolos, you know. And so like hatchet, big hatchet things. Oh very vicious\nlooking deals. And that\u2019s what they used to do. But I could not see any jungle. I mean these were\npaved streets. These were houses. And I thought well maybe when we move further in, you\nknow away from the city area, I might find the jungle. Well it didn\u2019t quite happen that way. We\nonly stayed in there one month because that was no place for us, when they can hook something\nand take things out of there. That was not for us. So then again we have asked the Jewish\ncommittee, where we could go and where we could live. So they said well there is a house. [Il\nshow you but you have to share it with another family. Well no problem, I mean, that\u2019s fine. So\nwe met the Kostenits family, a husband, wife and one daughter. The daughter was just a couple\nof years older than I was. And so that was a beautiful complex. It was, it belonged to I think a\nmayor, Resal. His last name was Resal. I don\u2019t remember his first name. But there are a lot of\nResals over there. There are lot, it\u2019s a very popular name. And this house was very beautiful. It\nhad, downstairs was a hall. Cause it was like a dance hall. Oh it was huge. And then you went\nup the stairs and upstairs were the living quarters \u2014 the kitchen, three bedrooms. One was\noccupied by my parents. One was occupied by the girl, Eva. Kostenits parents. And the other\nroom was for us three girls. And it also had a very long veranda out front. The length of the\nhouse. Of course, also it had bars. Downstairs, upstairs and so forth. The only bar that wasn\u2019t on\nwas in the kitchen because they felt I guess there wasn\u2019t much to steal in the kitchen. So anyway\nSO we moved in with what we had, not a whole lot because like I said the bicycle was already\nruined from the ocean water and everything else so I don\u2019t know. My dad wasn\u2019t able to clean it\nup. There was just no way of rescuing it. My mother\u2019s soap became like soap suds. There was\nhardly anything left of that. But we did have a few clothes that we had brought along and we\nwere able to use them. But since we knew that this was going to be temporary because it was for\ntwo people, we wanted something for ourselves and they wanted something for themselves as\nwell. But what happened is which made us move even faster, was we were sleeping one night\nand I was awoken by a man putting his arms around my neck and putting his face next to me.\nAnd I woke up and I yelled. A boy wants to kiss me. I like I said my imagination, I have very\nvivid imagination. At this time, by that time I was 12 years old. My birthday was in July and you\nknow time passes on. so this was July and I was 12. And but back to this robber. He was taking\na check on what I was wearing and he had been already to somebody else. I don\u2019t remember\nnow. It was my sister or the other gal. both were named Eva so I didn\u2019t know. And so this lady\nnext door in the bedroom said oh go to sleep you had a, you had a dream. You just, go back to\nsleep, go back to sleep. I said no he\u2019s creeping out now. He\u2019s leaving. He\u2019s leaving. Catch him,\nsomebody stop him. You know. And so my parents, by my voice could tell immediately that\nsomething was wrong. So my mom got up and of course she saw the window to the kitchen wide\nopen. The door to the, from the kitchen going down was wide open, things scattered all over the\nplace. And my dad had a very bad habit, of taking his rings off at night. Wedding ring and all.\nWell that was gone. The wedding ring was gone. The watch was gone and that he was very\nupset about. And then we had some eau de cologne that we had brought from Germany. It had a\ngold cap on it, sort of gold metal thing. They took that. They thought that was the real thing. So\nwhat over a period of time, I mean this is how we lost some things. You know robberies. So he\ntook quite a few things with him. He took we had brought coral necklaces, my sister and I. Those\nhe took. Oh a few odds and ends, I mean. At this time I don\u2019t\u2019 even remember what all the man\ndid take, but he was so deft at it that he had gone to this one, and nobody, he was in my parents\u2019\nroom and they didn\u2019t even feel his presence or hear him or that is so very quiet. If he hadn\u2019t\ntouched me I might not have woke up. But he made the mistake of touching me. With that I\nwoke up. And they said had he had I worn earrings he would have probably been able to take\nthem out. I would not have felt it. And the necklace the same thing. He, they do it in one, one\ngrab, feeling for necklace and earrings. And being I\u2019m a light sleeper, that he was able to take it.\nNot, I mean not get to it. Then we called, I guess I didn\u2019t call, we didn\u2019t call the police. We had\nno phone of course. Somebody heard us and commotion and so the people next door that lived\nthere came over and asked what went on and we told them. And so I see this Filipino man\ncoming up the stairs and I\u2019m yelling. I said \u201cthat\u2019s him, that\u2019s him\u201d. At night it you know this is\nnight time we\u2019re talking about. He had on white t-shirt and white shorts. So did this man that was\ncreeping out of the room that had touched me and he too had. So I said \u201cthat\u2019s him, that\u2019s him\u201d.\nAnd they kept saying \u201cno, no, no. No, he\u2019s our houseboy.\u201d I said \u201cthat\u2019s the man, I saw him.\u201d\nBut of course it wasn\u2019t him. But I was so hysterical at that point that, and then of course I was\nafraid to sleep. They had to look under the beds, they had to look everywhere before I would\neven go to bed. I mean I was just so afraid of everything. By then and to this day, I am still. I\nmean this wasn\u2019t the only robbery. I'll get to that later. But to this very day I don\u2019t trust\nanybody. When I had a dog in America, I was fine. We lost our dog. Now I have ADT which 1s\na security system installed. And my husband can\u2019t understand it. He\u2019s from Shanghai. But me, I\nam from the Philippines. And we had so many robberies that I am paranoid about things like\nthat. Anyway, so that was one of the experiences with the robbery. The very first one. Then\nthese people moved out and they moved across to the next house. And then we took another\nfamily in because nobody could afford to pay that kind of rent and my dad still didn\u2019t have a job.\nSo they kept saying \u201cyou'll find one. Don\u2019t worry, you'll find one.\u201d But I went, enrolled as we\nhad to go to school of course. I mean we can\u2019t do without school. So my parents enrolled us into\na parochial school run by the German nuns. They figured because German nuns would be helpful\nin learning, then we could learn to speak English better than we did. So they put me into fourth\ngrade and my sister was very young so she went into first grade. Well, after a while they realized\nthat I\u2019m not, I\u2019m too far ahead because I you know I had already been in the fifth grade in\nGermany. So they put me into fourth first and then they put me into fifth. So that\u2019s what it was.\nInto fourth grade first and then into the fifth. Then before I knew it we were kicked out of school.\nMy mother was called. Come to school. We want to talk to all the parents were called one by\none. And the head, the Mother Superior said to my family, my mother, sorry you have to take\nyour children out. My mother said, why. Well because you\u2019re Jewish. My mother said because\nwe\u2019re Jewish. We just left Germany bruise we were Jewish. Well, we\u2019re being persecuted here\ntoo. Why?",
        "A: We heard that the temples had been burned and that there was a big closings of the stores of\nthe Jewish merchants and that must have come in over the radio to the operator on board ship.\nAnd he passed it along to the refugees that were on board. So we knew how close my dad had\ngotten to not even getting us out of Germany. And that was a very fortunate thing for us that we\nmade it out before all this took place. Oh, they were arresting all the Jewish people but the men\nespecially the men. And taking them to concentration camps. And my uncle, my aunt Ruth\u2019s\nhusband, Herbert Binger was one of the first that they took to the concentration camp, Dachau.\nAnd he was there so that\u2019s how we had heard only through letters, that were in Manila by the\ntime we reached Manila. And I also forgot to mention the fact that when we got off the ship in\nManila, there was a girl that had a cousin waiting on her at the pier or the docks in Manila. And\nshe said to her cousin, she said \u201cHey\u201d she said \u201cwho\u2019s that Chinese lady that, that Chinese girl\nthat\u2019s there with you that came off the ship. She is Chinese.\u201d And my girlfriend said \u201cOh no,\nshe\u2019s one of us.\u201d And I was so devastated when I heard that, I had never forgotten that ever\nsince. It\u2019s been bothering me and I told her about that, the last day that we were here together at\nthe reunion but I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Now back to our moving around to the Santa\nEscolastica school and going to classes over there. And the boy that had, we had to leave the\nschool because this little boy that was in kindergarten, he apparently had either stomped on the\npicture of Jesus or spit on it or both. I\u2019m not exactly sure. But the Mother Superior told my\nmother that she has to take us out of school because we cannot expect, she said \u201cwe cannot\nexpect Jewish children to come and study at the Catholic school. We wouldn\u2019t go to your\nschool.\u201d So my mother said \u201cwell we don\u2019t have a school. There are just a handful of Jewish\nchildren here.\u201d She said, \u201cWell then it\u2019s time you opened one up.\u201d And with that my mother\nwas so upset that she said \u201cyes, ok\u201d. So all of the kids that were in that school. There weren\u2019t all\nthat many. But there were a number of the refugees that were there and we had to leave. But\nwhile I was in classes over there, the children all made fun of my English because my English\nwas the Oxford English and if I said something like looking glass or either or neither, they just\nwould laugh and that would really embarrass me. And then another thing that happened is there\nare So many cats over there and somehow, I didn\u2019t know yet. I learned later on that you had to be\nvery careful where you stepped because if you stepped into some cat do, you would get that\nhorrible smell on you and the whole class would smell badly. And somebody would say \u201chm, I\nsmell something horrible. Margie, did you step into something.\u201d And you know what, I really\nwas the one that did it. So they\u2019d send me out of the class. I had to clean my shoes off. The\nbottom and wherever I stepped into it and then I could return to the class. But I still had a few\nvery ugly experiences over in Santa Escolastica. So when they told us we had to leave I really\nwasn\u2019t all that sorry. To me, that was kind of a new page in my life. I was going on from this bad\nexperience with the German sisters. So we moved, this was Pasay where we were living in that\nbig house and that where we shared with so many people.",
        "A: Yeah, by the way yeah, Pasay is a suburb of Manila. And Pasay had also the Jewish\ncommittee. I think they were located either very close to it or I\u2019m not sure exactly where. But\nthey told my dad that he should use his money up first and not to worry about a job. It\u2019ll come,\nit\u20191l come and my dad said \u201cyeah but I don\u2019t\u2019 want to use everything up. We\u2019ll have nothing to\nlive on anymore.\u201d And they said \u201coh, it\u2019s all right. You\u2019ll find work. You\u2019ll find.\u201d So it was\nover a year later that my dad finally did. But not until we moved to Ermita. But I do want to\nsay one more thing what happened to me while we were living in Pasay. We had this one lady\nthat had a baby and her husband, they were living with us at that time in the big house. And she\nasked my mother if I could go and get her some sanitary napkins. So my mother said yeah she\nshould go. So she gave me some one and she said \u201cwhy don\u2019t you go to the market, over\u201d which\nwas not all that far away. And she said \u201cgo and get me a box of sanitary napkins\u201d. And I went\nahead and I was about 12 years old at the time. And I went over there and I said \u201cI want a box of\nsanitary napkins\u201d. And this Chinese merchant said to me, he says do you know what they are.\nAnd I says \u201cOf course,\u201d I said \u201cit\u2019s a napkin that you wipe your mouth with when you are\ndone\u2019. Well they all were laughing like crazy and I couldn\u2019t understand why they are laughing.\nTo me it was a very serious matter. So when I went home I told my mother, I said \u201cyou know\nthey were laughing but when I, they asked me if I knew what a sanitary napkin was and I didn\u2019t\nknow. All I said is well it\u2019s something that you have to use when you eat your lunch or dinner\nand you wipe your mouth and to be you know. Etiquette, it reminds you to have a napkin. And\nthey roared, they absolutely roared.\u201d And she said \u201coh my goodness\u201d. She said you don\u2019t know\nreally, do you?\u201d I said \u201cwhat should I know\u201d. And she said \u201cWell that\u2019s when you get your\nperiod.\u201d Well I was so embarrassed. From that moment on, when I had to go to the market I\nwent across the street. I passed them so I wouldn\u2019t have to look at them or go near them. It was\nthe most embarrassing moment of my life, I think at that point. It was horrible. Anyway, from\nlike I said from Pasay we did finally move to Ermita because first of all there were no jobs to be\nhad over where we were living in Pasay and there was a nice school with American nuns and I\nthink really that was the main reason that my parents moved to Ermita. There were many other\nsuburbs they could have gone to, suburbs of Manila that they could have gone to. But that so we\nwent over to meet the sisters of Maryknoll. And they were so wonderful. They opened their\narms, took us in. We had to pay which we did too at Santa Escolastica. Nothing is for free. We\neven had to buy uniforms at Santa Escolastica. And now we had to buy uniforms again in\nMaryknoll, at or college. But Maryknoll college uniform was very pretty. It was a wine red full\nskirt with bib like. And underneath you had a beige blouse, short sleeves and it had a wine red\nribbon around the collar which was very pretty. It was kind of a pleated top and down to the\nwaist and then again pleat from the waist down. And we really loved the sisters. It was so\nwonderful. And being we were Jewish we were not required to take religious lessons as we had\nto do in Santa Escolastica. We had to attend all the lessons, but over there they gave me the\nfreedom. If I wanted to, I could sit in the back of the class and just listen. Well I thought that\nwas very interesting for me was the history so I just sat there and listened to all the teachings of\nJesus Christ and the parables and all the things that happened and saints and what have. And\nthen it came. Oh before I go on, I was put into the sixth grade right then and there because I was\nin fifth grade at Santa Escolastica. And they thought that I would fit very well into the sixth\ngrade. So I was in the sixth grade. And they had a test, an examination at the end of the school\nyear and they said would you like to take the examination on, on the religious part of it. I said\nsure. What have I to lose. I mean after all you know I\u2019m not supposed to be here but I\u2019Il take it.\nAnd believe it or not I was on the honor roll, the second person on the honor, I did better than the\nCatholics did. And the sisters told it all over the school. Can you imagine. We have a Jewish girl\nand she got a 98% whereas you kids don\u2019t even get anything. You are barely passing. And so I\nwas really thrilled. And then came the seventh grade. And again I was on the honor roll and\nagain I was on the top in fact this time I was on the first on the honor roll. I was number one\nwhich made me very happy. And it pleased them immensely. Then we graduated from the\nseventh grade. Well that is a big deal. The archbishop has to come in and he has to bless the\nchildren and you had to have special uniforms. White dress and I, well my mother really\ncouldn\u2019t afford to buy a white dress so one of the classmates of mine said oh her sister already\ngraduated and I could fit into her dress. And that\u2019s what happened and I had to go forward and\nkiss the ring. I pretended to kiss it. I didn\u2019t really kiss, I didn\u2019t think 1t was sanitary enough to\nkiss the ring, but I did and from then on I went to high school. And in the first year of high\nschool, I learned Latin and that was a very difficult language. And then the war broke out. And\nthat was the end of it for my school of that time.",
        "A: The very same place. Maryknoll College. They also had a high school. And at that point I\nwas, let\u2019s see 14 years old, 14 years old. It was 1941 and I\u2019m trying to get the figures in my head.\nAnyhow, anyway I didn\u2019t not even complete the high school, the first year of high school\nbecause the war did break out in December.",
        "A: We had by that time, we had joined the congregation. The Temple Emil and we had a\nwonderful person that was I think he wasn\u2019t really a rabbi. He was the father of Rebecca\nKonigsberg because her father was very well educated in the Jewish religion. And he knew all\nthe customs so he was leading the congregation there for a number of years. And we went to\nSunday School. We took Hebrew lessons. We, we learned a lot in that time. And even through\nall the war years, we still were going to that temple until the very end of the occupation. But let\nme not get ahead of it. We moved to Ermita and we had to share again a lower flat like. It had\nseveral bedrooms and we rented it in the beginning, we rented it to American businessmen.\nThen they left. Then we rented it to an American woman with a child and the man was in the\nmilitary. And then they were evacuated because they knew that something was going to happen.\nPeople had an inkling that war was not far away but nobody really talked about it, that this was\nin 1940 I would say. And then white Russians moved in. After they all had left, so we had quite\na turn over, over there, but we always were able to rent it. And before all this, I do want to say\nsomething really cute. We had a black cat. And this cat was like a little dog. It would know\nexactly when we would come from school, at lunch time and would sit at the gate waiting for us.\nAnd it was adorable. That cat was just like a, like a little, it was like, but like a cat, it wasn\u2019t,\nwasn\u2019t a cat. It was like a dog I want to say. And then my mother saw a black cat one day out\nwhile she was shopping for groceries. And she said \u201cmy goodness, that looks like our cat Peter\u201d.\nSo she was feeding this cat Peter all the way to the home and guess what. There was our cat in\nthe window sitting and looking. So she had fed this strange black cat who was very happy to\nreceive the food. That was one of the funny experiences we had during that time. Anyway.",
        "A: My dad got the job after one year, which was 1939. He did get a job with Ford Motors as a\npurchasing agent. And he had to drive the car around and pick up parts and things like that and\nhe really loved the job. It was very nice and he really enjoyed it. And we were very happy to\nfinally have you know some extra money. And in the meanwhile, we got a word that in Manila,\nin, I\u2019m sorry in Shanghai an uncle who had been coming over Manila and we couldn\u2019t keep him\nthere, had gone on to Shanghai. Had pneumonia and passed away and left my aunt with a six\nyear old daughter. That was in 1939. The same age as my sister. So it was a very trying\nexperience for her so we were able to send her money so she would have something to live on.\nAnd then came the news that my grandmother was still in Germany and had to get out. So again\nwe had to send some money and to, into Shanghai and my grandmother got the very last train out\nof Germany, over Siberia to go to Shanghai.",
        "A: Yes, yes it was Anna Zusman that was my grandmother that was left behind. The other ones\nI, like I said I don\u2019t even know you know. I knew they were in Katowice. That\u2019s the last, we had\nsaid our goodbyes over there. And my grandmother in Germany, she by that time everybody had\nto wear the Star of David on their, the yellow star of David, or an arm band. They had to be\nidentified as Jews. And when friends that she had before wouldn\u2019t\u2019 even talk to her. That they\nran across the street or just to get out of the way so they wouldn\u2019t have to greet her. And so",
        "A: Yes we did letters, get letters from my aunt and my grandmothers stating the fact that my\nuncle now was in a concentration camp and he has to get out. Out of Germany because that\u2019s the\nonly way he could get out of the concentration camp. Now my uncle had already years ago had\nTV. He was so he had weak lungs. So when he went into we tried to keep him Manila by the\nway. We tried everything. We went to the HIAS, we went to the Jewish committee. We tried\nevery which way and there was absolutely no way they could, we could keep them over there\nwhich was very disturbing to us because we had hoped that they could stay with us. And as fate\nwould have it. they went to Shanghai and that\u2019s the only place my grandmother, Anna Zusman\ncould go. So perhaps this was the way fate played it on us, that she was saved that way. And she\ndied in Shanghai at, of old age but my aunt said that also she had stomach cancer and nobody\nwanted to really talk about it. And thinking now about the going back to the beginning. I\u2019m\ntrying to remember in sequence how things were going. In Ermita, when we found out that the\nwar was coming. My dad of course was still working on the pier. And then the Japanese started\nbombing us very, very heavily. And there was no difference between military objects or private\npeople. It just didn\u2019t\u2019 matter. And we could always tell when you saw them in morning, early\nhigh up above at around 8:00, that would mean they would bomb us. If they weren\u2019t there at\n8:00 that day they would not bomb. SO this was from December the eighth until oh, into I\nthink it was like February when they finally decided to invade us. And my dad was working like\nI say on the docks and they\u2019re bombing all the time. And then the Americans had to set fire to all\nof the ships\u2019 cargo and everything that was on the docks. They didn\u2019t want to leave anything to\nthe Japanese of course. So the people were told, take whatever you can carry. The ships are open\nto you. The factories are open to you. Grab whatever you can. Make as many trips as you can\nand get all the food or whatever you feel like you\u2019re going to grab and if you can make several\ntrips go for it. So people would pass our house with, carrying things like clothing and just\nmaterials so my mother bought a couple of materials from these people and we bought potatoes\nbecause potatoes did not grow in Manila. They had to be imported. So and we were used to\neating potatoes. So then my dad got a bicycle from the company and they said take whatever you\ncan take. So he just took the bicycle and a few odds and ends. But no, not a whole lot. We\u2019re\nnot, he wasn\u2019t the kind of person to just take. But we did get a few things from the people that\nwere dragging it and then they could go back and get more. This way they had money and at the\nsame time were able to get some groceries or foods, I mean clothing and whatever else we could\npossibly use. One thing we heard about and that was kind of a strange situation. These people,\nthere were four of them. And they were carrying this, they saw this huge heavy box. And they\nfigured there must be something wonderful in that box. So the four, four people are carrying it.\nAnd they took it all the way down to, into our area and along the beach. It was called Dewey\nBoulevard, it was a beautiful, it wasn\u2019t a beach. First it was a street and then there was a beach.\nThat this was Dewey Boulevard with a street that they were walking on and dragging things and\npulling and whatever they could do. And finally got far enough from the fire and opened it up\nand inside was a coffin with a dead person who was on his way to wherever they were going\nnext to be buried. Well needless to say that was the end of that, never got to go to his resting\nplace. And then the fire was going a lot. I mean it was all around. They were trying to burn as\nmuch as they could. But they did not burn homes or anything like that. 1t was just at the pier.\nAnd then pretty soon the Japanese started marching in and the Americans had already left for\nBataan and I think Corregidor and they went kind of away from Manila. And only people left\nwere the civilians. Us. And we were declared open city, a long time ago but the Japanese just\ndidn\u2019t\u2019 care. they bombed us anyway. And that is how some people did get killed, injured et\ncetera. We were safe. We were very, very fortunate that we did not get killed. And my dad being,\nworking with the at the docks for so long, it was a miracle that he wasn\u2019t hit by something or\nother. And\nthe Filipinos treated you any differently because you were Jewish. Whether the Jewish\ncommunity there was treated any worse than any other part of the white immigrant or refugee\ncommunity.",
        "A: No, they treated us very well. I mean they to them Judaism didn\u2019t\u2019 mean anything different.\nWe believed in God. They believed in God. The majority of the people there were anyway\nCatholics and there was, they were very strict Catholics. They would go to Mass and they really\nrespected everybody. And therefore they believed in the Ten Commandments. Honor thy\nparents, love thy neighbors. And they really believed in that.",
        "A: We had a very life. We had our get together. We had, made a lot of friends with other Jewish\nrefugees and we children enjoyed going to Sunday school. We met our peers and we just enjoyed\nit and during the high holidays it was always a wonderful time for us because everybody was\nthere, regardless of whether they were very religious or not and a lot of the people that, there\nwere some, I shouldn\u2019t say a lot. There were some people that came from Shanghai that friends, I\nmade friends with the Helmans. There was Rosie Helman, Siggy Helman and Gloria Helman.\nThose were the children. And Mr. and Mrs. Helman. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember their first names at this\nmoment. They had a boarding house right on Dewey Boulevard overlooking the ocean. And that\nwas a very favorite place for everybody and Rosie and I became very dear friends because she\nwent to the Sunday school and we just all had a very pretty good life considering you know we\nweren\u2019t\u2019 rich or anything like that. We couldn\u2019t take things out of their country so we were, had\nto start fresh, completely fresh as I\u2019ve said before. There was not a whole lot left that we could\nrescue or salvage. We did keep that wooden box that all our stuff came in. And my mother had\npacked away a couple of things, including some crystal because we only lived in one room, the\nfour of us were in one room and rented all out to the other people so we could pay for this flat.\nLike I say we had a hard time because they had to give money for the visa for my grandmother\nand already mentioned for us to be able to buy a popsicle, ice cream. I mean there, the food thing\non a popsicle. Oh that was quite a big deal. We never were able to buy a Coke because those\nwere expensive. Even five centavos we couldn\u2019t have. We had to save every penny to send to\nShanghai. And for the visa for my grandmother. So we were really considered quite poor in those\ndays. So when the war, I mean when the Japanese came in, we had taken, we had gotten a few\nfurnitures of course, and all the people, the Americans had left. Now the Japanese were marching\nin. We heard them coming in during the night. And it was an awful feeling to hear marching. It\nreminded us of the Nazis in Germany. And we were so afraid that they were going to come into\nour homes. And, and just kill us all. We had heard horrible stories of what Japanese can do from\npeople in different areas. They were very sadistic. And the first troops in were mostly Koreans.\nThey had taken them as the foot soldiers and the officers were Japanese and these people, the\nKoreans and the low, low Japanese their uniforms smelled so horrible that you could actually\nsmell them through the windows into the house. And had a terrible stench about them. I don\u2019t\u2019\nknow whether they were able to wash it there or what you know. Because they were in the war. I\nmean they were just waiting and they had to land someplace. But it was very, very hard for us to\nall of a sudden for the Americans to the Japanese. We didn\u2019t know what awaited us. How they\nwere going to treat us, being Jewish and of course our nuns were still at the Maryknoll college\nbut we were not able to go to school because we were afraid to go out into the streets and so\nforth. And of course they were, later we learned they were right away interned in Saint Thomas\nwhich as an internment camp for Americans, for white Russians and people that they suspected\nof being pro-American. So but also then we were afraid we were going to be bombed by the\nAmericans and so 1n a way that is also sort of what happened, but not right away. Not, they\nwere still gathering themselves together and trying to get all the forces that were left because\nthey, a lot of them were in Bataan and they didn\u2019t\u2019 have a lot of communications with them\nbecause the Japanese intercepted everything that went out of the country.\n(file 3 \u2014 RG-50.106.0052.03.03 \u2014 duration: 01:01:04)",
        "A: Before the Japanese took over, we could go to the market and buy beef and you know better\nthings. However no the potatoes before the war were still there because they were imported.\nOnce the Japanese moved in we did not have any fresh food. We did not have any regular\npotatoes. We ate yams or yellow potatoes, the sweet potatoes, I should say. And we didn\u2019t have\nmuch money. In fact money was like going always up, up, up. It was like inflation. Money\nwasn\u2019t worth a thing and so we ate rice. One meal would be the rice soup. Another meal would\nbe the rice. Another meal would be the potato peels , the sweet potato peel and another one\nwould be the regular sweet potato. But my mother became inventive. She would take for\nexample she would take the potato which was an awful sweet potato and she would put vinegar\non it and would put salt on it and it kind of deadened the sweetness. And it was a little bit like a\npotato salad, were trying to imitate that. Then to make, in those days we still had electricity and\nso forth. So my mother would get some coconuts and with (rust?) with the coconut and then\nsqueeze out the cream and from that she would make ice cream and put that into like cubes, into\ncube trays in the freezer. And we would have ice cream. I mean you had to be very inventive.\nYou could take flowers and make a jelly and jam out of it. And later on in the things, I mean\nflour disappeared. We had then we made, we bought bread made of rice flour. We bought bread\nout of just about anything that you could imagine and the matzo. We had no matzo of course so\nwe used sour flour for matzo. Things were really pretty rotten. And the beef came to an end as\nwell because the caribous were, you know there were more no more caribous and the Japanese\nconfiscated a lot of the stuff. So all of a sudden we were having horse meat. But we didn\u2019t know\nit was. It tasted different. Our Dad finally told us because he was in Russia before the war if you\nremember. He would say it tastes sweet and that is horse meat. Well then we didn\u2019t want to eat\nthat any more either. So we stuck to a diet of fish and chicken but chicken was really a delicacy.\nWe couldn\u2019t hardly afford to buy a chicken so we decided we\u2019re going to raise our own and well\nwhere do you keep a chicken, right. There was no, you can\u2019t leave it outside. It might get stolen\nso we put chickens in one of the little rooms like a closet and had a bar across it and they would\nroost right on top of the bars. But then the rats would come and would like to eat those poor\nchickens. You had, you know making a lot of fluttering and screaming and screeching. And we\nwould jump out of bed and we tried to chase the rats away from the where we had the chickens\nbecause like I said they liked to eat chickens too. Then during the winter season we lived in a\nplace where we were downstairs and across the street from us was the house of Japanese where\nthey were torturing Filipinos. Whoever they thought was a group that was against them. And\nthey would do the most horrible things to them. And we would see walking by. It was just awful.\nThey would have men hanging upside down and would make them smoke and they would have\nthem close their nose and mouth and they would have to inhale the smoke. And they would just\nabsolutely and they\u2019d blow up like they would swell up. It was just awful. Or they would pull\nfingernails out and toenails and the water torture. They did everything and anything to get some\ninformation out of them. And that they didn\u2019t do, they couldn\u2019t do. And my dad at that time,\nthere was no more. In the beginning my dad and I were selling automobile parts, in the very\nbeginning of the Japanese occupation because we needed to get some money. So we would buy\nparts from one place and take it and sell it to another place. One of our, my good customers was\nthe cigar company. Hamber, I think it was called cigar company. And they would give me\nwhat they wanted. They needed say X number of piston rings, X number of spark plugs. X\nnumber of fan belts. I mean things like that or even batteries. So I would go and find where I\ncould find some and then bring it to them and sell them. Now I was having a better time of sales\nthan my dad, I guess because I was a girl. Anyway, and that way I was able to support my family\nsome money somehow. And in the meantime, of course the Americans were bombing us.",
        "A: Well we still were in Ermita and the auto parts, people tipped us off who might be wanting to\nsell. Well you had no gasoline. You only had cars there so you dismantled them and sold part by\npart because nobody could drive a car at that point anyway. Gasoline was out of the question so\nyou had to do what you had to do and this is how I found out well these people had this and that\nand so I went and procured it and sold it to them. And we\u2019d separate, my dad and I. He\u2019d go one\ndirection and I\u2019d go someplace else and sometimes we\u2019d meet for lunch or whatever, downtown.\nBut between the bombings, the Americans were flying way up there. And we wanted to say\nhooray, hooray, hooray but we didn\u2019t dare show any kind of an emotion because that would have\nbeen the end. But then that stopped too. And so then my dad used to go to the market, get some\nlinguises, they called them. That\u2019s a sausage and other things that he thought people would need\nand took it into the provinces, way into the interior of Manila, in that bundle into Philippines,\ninterior of the suburbs and further out. Well twice, my poor father was caught. The first time they\nthought he was a guerrilla but he talked his way out of it. The second time he wasn\u2019t so lucky.\nHe, they had him, they hand bound him. They were going to shoot him. I mean they already had\na position to sue. And he said I can show you that I\u2019m a Jewish person. I had the bris, and they\nsaid that doesn\u2019t mean anything. We do too. We had the same operation. Don\u2019t work, that stuff.\nSo he said I can recite the Shema. He said how do we know that that is your prayer. We don\u2019t\u2019\nknow Hebrew. So he was there for hours. They were keep, questioning him. And he kept saying\nI am not a, I am not a spy for the Japanese. I am not. Iam pro-American. We",
        "A: That is correct. They were in the outskirts hiding underground so to speak. Yes, and they,\nwhen they see a white man or what\u2019s he doing in the province, find out he\u2019s German on top of\nthat. Well, that means enemy. And so they really wanted to kill him. And so he said \u201clook, if\nyou\u2019re going to kill me, do it now. Don\u2019t prolong this anymore. I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d He was saying\nthe Shema over and over and over again. And nothing they said, he said or did. He says I have a\nfamily. I have two children. I have a, my wife is there. He said please you know this was in the\nPasay. This, in the meanwhile we had to move Ermita, because Ermita was getting very\nexpensive, so we went back to Pasay. And we rented a downstairs. It was like a basement type\nthing, level to the ground. And that, from there we were making our trips into the city and you\ndidn\u2019t have much. As transportation you mostly had to walk and it was pretty hard. And anyway\nso my dad, this finally somebody else, the big, big macher came from the group. And he said, \u201cI\nbelieve this man. Let him go.\u201d So they said ok, let him go. He was so sure they were going to\nshoot him in the back. And he took his bicycle and started walking. He didn\u2019t dare get on a\nbicycle because he was so weak by that time. He was so exhausted from the interrogations and\nfrom the, the whole way they held him, hand cuffed behind his back and all that. I mean he was\njust a broken man. Well, they let him go. But the man that told him you can go, said, \u201cI will\nwatch you. I will make sure that you are telling the truth. And if you\u2019re not, you\u2019re a dead man.\u201d\nSo he told him where he, where we lived so he says \u201cI\u2019m going to come and check up on you.\u201d\nMy dad came home walking. He never rode the bicycle all the way, miles and miles and miles,\nkilometers over there. And he came home and he always was an old man. He was so broken up\nabout this that we said you\u2019re not going back into that again ever, ever. You cannot do it. And so\nmy poor father, that night, sure enough we spied, we saw somebody outside our window. We\nthought it was somebody going to break in again. And no, it was one of the people that had said\nthey\u2019re going to check up on him were outside our window, looking in. But barely. You had to\njust kind of look in through the slats. But they were there checking up on us. That was the last\ntime he went into the country. We would not let him. I said we\u2019d rather starve. Now we, like I\nsaid, we were at the floor level. In the back was swamp. And they had fish so we would go out\nthere and try to catch some fish for food. And we had those two chickens. But you know we\ndidn\u2019t have heart. We did not have the heart to kill them so we gave them to a neighbor and says\nhere. You take them. We don\u2019t want to eat them. And they\u2019re getting older. You better just use\nthem. Of course they didn\u2019t\u2019 give us any share at all, but the Japanese kept up their atrocities\nsomething awful. And many people didn\u2019t make it back. I mean even some of our Jewish people\nwere taken . They found a short wave radio or sometimes they didn\u2019t find anything. They just\ndidn\u2019t\u2019 like the way you answered them and that was it.",
        "A: Not really patrolling. They had houses. Little like a, it was like you see in England. You\nknow those little guard houses. They had that that set up all over and when you walked by you\nhad to bend down as low as you could because if you didn\u2019t they just slap you left and right. And\nso we learned to do it. But later on we get to the idea, hey wait a minute. We are German. They\ndon\u2019t\u2019 know the difference so we said Allemande, Allemande. German. Deutsch, Deutsch.\nAnd you know it worked. We didn\u2019t\u2019 have to do it anymore. They bowed to us. But they were\nlike I said pretty viscous. And again things became, the water kept rising in that place. Whenever\nit rained. It was rainy season, the piles came loose. And we, whenever we put our feet out ora\nhand out, it would touch water. So we know the water had risen to our bed. And the beds were\nway up there. High up. Everything was up high. And that\u2019s how so we could open the, we had\nwindow open. The water was as high outside as it was inside. So we saw fish floating by and we\ntried to catch those fish. So once in a while we were lucky and we were able to catch the fish. So\nbetween vegetables that were growing out back and fish we didn\u2019t need a whole lot of money.",
        "A: It certainly was. From Pasay, we moved back to Ermita. We just things were getting pretty\nbad. We couldn\u2019t\u2019 stay in that, in a place where the water was coming up all the time. We lost a\nlot of things due to that. The shoes molded away, the blankets and everything else. So that didn\u2019t\nlast. So then we went to Ermita now. It was almost 1945, very close to 1945 when we moved\nback to Ermita. I would say that was probably in the very beginning of 45. And the bombings of\nthe Americans increased. Then came shelling. They had, they dropped leaflets and were telling\nus that they had already come to the outskirts of Manila by dropping leaflets. So we knew the\nend was near. We could just hold out a little bit longer. And we had ok, also we, up until that\ntime we were able to go to the temple. And we were able to go every week to services. But\nwhen the shell, the bombings got worse and worse, it really was very dangerous to be outside.\nAnd there was no place to really hide because there were no air raid shelters in Manila because it\nwas too low. It was water underneath, not far down, we had water. So we couldn\u2019t build any air\nshelters. So you had to hope for the best. That was about it. So then we were again back in\nErmita and then the Japanese had been storing ammunition in between the civilians because\nthey knew that the, if the Americans knew civilians lived there, they would not bomb the\ncivilians. So they very smartly put gasoline, ammunition, anything that was flammable to put in-\nbetween the civilians, like maybe two houses of civilian. The third one would have that. Or five\nhouses of civilians and a big bloc of Japanese. So they were all over the place. And we knew\nmore or less where they were. So we but we, where else can you run. I mean you can\u2019t keep\nrunning so we were at one place. It used to be a dressmaker\u2019s place. That was our very last stand.\nWe were so tired of moving and running away and no matter where we went we were getting\nbombed or getting shelled. It really didn\u2019t\u2019 make any difference.",
        "A: Well the pies came at a very late date also because like I said food was running out. So this\none lady was baking pies and I took it to the hospital where they still had some doctors and\nnurses. And also the people that were discharged from the prisons were there. And there was\none Jewish man that I, basically that was the one I really, really remembered. Because I had\nknown him. His name was Moser. And he was laying on the bed, white. His legs were saw raw\nthat he couldn\u2019t even put his legs together and he was so thin that there was nothing left and he\nlooked almost like what you see nowadays with the concentration camp victims. Exactly that\u2019s\nwhat he looked like. They starved him, they beat him. They did everything you can possibly\nimagine. He could barely talk to us. And I brought a pie over to him and I fed him because I felt\nthat was the only thing I could do. I would explain what happened to that pie later on to the lady\nthat made them, but he had to have some nourishment and I started feeding him small little\npieces and he ate it and his eyes became big and cause he couldn\u2019t really show much emotion at\nthat point. He was just too, too tired of living, too tired of everything. And the pies like I said you\nknow I sold as long as I could. And that stopped as well because the bombing got more severe\nand more severe and by that time, the Americans were already in Intramuros, in that area we\nheard. So it was time to just put an end to this. And so we were in this building that we had taken\nover from the dressmaker. And across the street from us were this red light house, the red light\ndistrict house. And I was standing in the doorway of our place where we were. And all of a\nsudden this Japanese soldier comes in, grabs me and was trying to drag me up the stairs. I am\ncrying, I am yelling and my mother is holding me. My sister is holding my mother and my father\nis holding my, my sister. My mother. Well anyway, one after the other. And I am trying to hold\nonto the bannister and he\u2019s pulling me, he\u2019s much stronger than I am. By this time I had amoebic\ndysentery. And I was very weak and so this, finally dad let go and he says I\u2019m running outside\nand see if I find a, an officer. Lucky, he found an officer. Do you speak English? Do you speak\nGerman? English. Help us, help me. My daughter. She\u2019s not one of those. So he came in and\nhe, I was already on the top of the stairs. And all of a sudden the officer arrived. And yelled\nsomething in Japanese and the, this soldier froze. And I was, I was hysterical by this time. I\nmean I was completely, I was so bad, I couldn\u2019t even walk downstairs. They carried me down\nthe stairs. And I was there and the officer called him to come down. The guy came down, this\nsoldier. He took him and he beat him up. I mean I, after a while I actually felt sorry for this guy.\nNot only did he beat him. He knocked him to the ground and then he kicked him. And he was\nstill apologizing. This, this police, I mean this solider was apologizing to this, to this officer.\nAnyway it was very lucky for me. It was really it was very, one of the fortunate instances. Well\nthen this all was coming to an end. The Japanese were making, going from house to house\ninterrogating or taking people. My dad said goodby already. My mother said goodby to us too.\nAnd said that your aunt is in Shanghai and I want you to go there after the war because if we are\nnot around, you have to be the, you have to be in charge. And he said, again he started saying the\nShema and dad said this is it. I\u2019m sorry, you girls will have to fend for yourself. The Americans\nare not far away. So you know be calm and do what they say. So guess what. They were next\ndoor, avoided our house, went to the next one and you could her people screaming and crying.\nAnd the truck was loading up all these people. And we were scared and next day in the morning\nthey brought some of the women back, not the men. We never saw the men again. And then that\nnight, all of a sudden we hear bombing, shelling and fire starting in our immediate area.",
        "A: Only Filipinos. There were no more white people around. We were just living among\nFilipinos.",
        "A: We think that might have happened because how else I mean we had the same place. I mean\nwe were side by side we\u2019d go from one to the next to the next. I mean you know how, we\nassumed that maybe this officer when somehow word must have spread. Say don\u2019t go there,\nthose are Germans. I don\u2019t know. Maybe the hand of God was over us. What, we don\u2019t\u2019 know.\nWe just don\u2019t\u2019 know. We only know that we were spared. And then that night we had to leave\nthat place and we thought we\u2019ll never come back again. And we hid in about a block away\nwhere still no flames. And we went there. In the morning we heard that that street had not\nburned yet so we cautiously made our way back there and sure it was not burned yet. So my\nfather said now I they next time the flames are going to get closer. We better grab what we\u2019re\ngoing to take if we can carry it.",
        "A: Shelling, the shelling, not the bombing at this point. It was mainly the heavy, heavy shelling.\nBy the Americans. And they just shot into it because the Japanese were intermingled with us and\nthe ammunition and the gasoline and daddy, my father said we don\u2019t want to go up in flames\nand be thrown to smithereens. We just might as well leave while we still can. So that morning we\ngathered all our meager, one photo album, the address for my aunt and the visa, affidavits for\nAmerica. I, my dad told me to take the electric plate over my neck and that was heavy. And the\ndog and the leash. We had a dog. And my sister couldn\u2019t\u2019 carry anything. She was too, I was 17\nat the time. and so my sister she was, what 12. So I don\u2019t know. Maybe they gave her something\nto carry also. And on top of that we had again bought some chickens. Raw, live chickens. And\nthey were making such a racket. So we gave it to somebody. And said we don\u2019t\u2019 want to be, we\ncan\u2019t kill them anyway. Just take them, just go. So we gave them to somebody who I don\u2019t even\nknow who they were. And we went to this apartment house that was down the street and in that\napartment house we went to that apartment building that was standing. That was a very high rise\nbuilding for those days. And in the bottom, or as you walked in from off the street were sandbags\nWell apparently a bomb, a shell had come into there and had not exploded. A great big thing and\none bomb was also in the shaft, elevator shaft. And we figured well let\u2019s lay down there. I mean\nwe've got to get out of the house. At least it\u2019s far enough, even though that explodes it\u2019Il give us\nsome protection with these bags around the building. Well we didn\u2019t expect a shell to come\nright, explode, come right into the, it was like a carport almost. Open on all the sides you see.\nAnd it came right in and exploded and it was phosphorous now. And the explosion of it, threw\nme under a very low table. It was like maybe 5 inches, 6 inches off the floor. It pushed me\nunderneath that and my mother got hit with shrapnel. Our dog ran away at that time and we were\nlooking for the dog afterwards but it was just as well because where we were before had taken\nour dog was barking at all the Japanese. We didn\u2019t know how to keep her quiet. So when this\nexplosion happened, she took off which was probably a blessing. Anyway so we I thought I said\nI think I\u2019m dying. I couldn\u2019t\u2019 breathe because of the phosphor in my lungs, you know. And my\nmother was bleeding from her shrapnel wounds. So we got out of there and went to a maybe a\nblock away to a garage that had burned I mean the garage. A house that had already burned out.\nAll those left were the bottom with hot, hot coals like tiles and things. But where else can we go.\nWe stayed there for just a little bit, maybe one night. That didn\u2019t work very well. So then we\nwent to the school which was Atenao, a parochial school for boys. The building was already\noccupied by a lot of refugees so there was no more room in the building. So the other people\nthat were outside were sitting in ditches that had been placed around the whole parameter of the\nschool. Well that\u2019s where we were when the shots kept coming over our heads. And my mother\nstill had that shrapnel in her but what could we do. There were no doctors, medics, nothing. So\nall we did was we put some bandage on her and that was all we could do. And then we, shell, a\nbig shrapnel fell between my mother and myself. If we had been closer it would have killed one\nof us. Well we figured out that wasn\u2019t a place to stay again. So again we started moving around.\nSo then we spied this, oh that was several blocks away because we knew that this was going to\ngo up and sure enough that night, our house, our place, that whole block went up. In explosion\nbecause a shell had hit there as well and it hit our apartment where we were hiding. It also was\nhitting already close to that place where we were living before. So we had to go further. So we\nwalked and we w",
        "A: The, we had finally come upon this garage that had a roof like I said, three sides but the front\nwas all open. We were in like sardines. We tried to get out of the outside as much as possible.\nBut we barely made it in because a lot of people there already. And there was one Jewish lady.\nShe had her maid there. She had her cushions there. She had everything that it could possibly\ncould think of. She would not move an inch. So we all were trying to help each other, trying to\nget In as many people as we could. Well we couldn\u2019t lic down. I mean it was you just laid to the\nside of yourself. Anyway, and then we were across the street was a whole contingent of\nJapanese. The whole house was occupied by Japanese soldiers. And pretty soon these Japanese\ncame over, wanted the girls. And being that I was very undernourished, underweight, didn\u2019t have\nmuch on me, they didn\u2019t see me. They thought I was just a kid. But there were some girls there\nthat were well endowed. They lined them all up and they said you, you, you, you. Come. Well\none of them was the daughter of optometrist that we knew. And he went up to this soldier who\nsaid you, you, you. He said watch, my daughter. And so he understood. He let the girl go. And\nhe gave him his gold watch. Then he asked for the men to come out. So all the men including\nmy father of course. He was lining them up and we thought oh my god, he\u2019s going to shoot them\nall now. Imean what. So my dad, said German, German. That saved him. So he sent him back to\nus. But the other ones they took along. They didn\u2019t shoot them right in front of our faces. They\njust took them. So that gave us a little bit more room in the garage which is a sad thing to say\nyou know. But that\u2019s when the moment you say German that was it. So then we had no food, no\nwater and at this time we were pretty worn out by running around from one area to another area\nand nothing to eat but we had had with us a little bit of drink. My dad had saved some whiskey in\na bottle. And he said we were going to use this when we are liberated. Well this was an\nemergency. And we had no more water. So when, they, I looked across the ruins and I saw a\nbunch of people. I said looks to me like they\u2019re going for water. I saw them lowering a can on a\nstring. I said that looks to me like that might have been a house. I\u2019m going. So my dad said, no\nI\u2019m going. I said no you\u2019re not. Because you are man. You might get killed. You are staying. I\nsaid I\u2019m going to take my sister, Eva. So she and I had this flask that was used to probably wine\nin there. It was kind of a maybe a five gallon jug, empty. So I said I\u2019m going to go because\nwhatever, we had nothing else. I mean we found it along the way somewhere. I that\u2019s not what\nwe carried because we had nothing, except what we had on our body, the photo album and a\nstamp album and electric plate. And when you throw yourself down, by that time I\u2019d lost the\nelectric plate also already. I didn\u2019t\u2019 have that anymore because that was at least it was heavy and\nhow could you fall on top of that. It was impossible. So I left 1t some time ago. So then I said,\nlet\u2019s go Eva. So we walked over there to the place where I saw those women and they were\nfighting over the water. I mean there were so , maybe 60 and I had no way of even getting close\nto it. So I just stood there and what next. How am I going to obtain water. We needed water. All\nof a sudden shelling started, whizzing right over our heads. Well the Filipinos, these were all\nFilipinos that we are talking about, all lay down flat on the ground. So that they wouldn\u2019t\u2019 be hit.\nAnd I said Eva lay down too. And I said look. She says come on lay down, lay down. I said no I\ncan\u2019t. I have got to get the water while I can. I\u2019m going to do that. So that\u2019s exactly what I did. I\ntook the can that was standing. I lowered it, brought up this filthy looking water. Threw it into\nthe jug. I got a few cans because the bombing, the shelling goes on for a while. I mean once one\nhits, then there are several. And I was standing up. I said to my sister, I said if it hits me, you\ntake the water and you carry it home, carry it to the garage. So I was standing there. And I,\neverything\u2019s fate in my eyes. And that\u2019s what happened. I got the water. The shelling stopped.\nWe didn\u2019t get a whole lot but we got enough to tide us over. So I said come on. Grab the one\nend of it. I grabbed the other end. We stumbled over all the ruins and the burned out things and\nno, nothing was standing anymore. Everything was just flattened. But you know stones and, and\nglass whatever have you. So we made it right back to the garage and my dad took the whiskey\nand put some into the, into the water we had and that we were survived and had water. And then\nthe next day we were, I had to go, we had no toilet. I had to go to the bathroom. I\u2019m outside and\nall of a sudden, this soldier comes up to me and I thought it was a Japanese and I\u2019m already\ngoing like this with my head down and my hands over my head and, and just cowering down. He\nsaid \u201cget up, get up. We are here, we are here.\u201d I jumped up. I said \u201can Americans, you\u2019re\nAmericans. And he said \u201cyes\u201d cause they were camouflaged with mud on their faces and they\nhad things over their head. The helmets and regular invasion forces. And he said \u201cwhere\u2019s the\nrest of your people.\u201d And I said \u201cover there in that garage\u2019. He says \u201cok, I didn\u2019t know there\nwere more civilians\u201d he said. I said \u201cyes, but be careful.\u201d I said \u201cThere are sentries in the house\nover there. They see you, they\u2019re going to kill you.\u201d So he called over to where my parents were\nand other people. Had them crawl out. I never went back again. I just showed him where they\nwere. I stayed, he said \u201cdon\u2019t you go back. Stay right here. I\u2019m coming for you.\u201d And that\u2019s\nwhat happened and he brought the civilians out, calling and then running. And he says \u201cyou run\nas fast as you can over all these dead people,\u201d over the corpses that had already started to smell\nand I mean stink horrible and the ants and the worms. Oh it\u2019s just horrible and that\u2019s what we\nsaw. And we passed that and by the time. We reached, we reached the, the American lines, they\nput us on a truck and took us to Santa Ana cabaret where 2000 people were already there. And\nanyway, 2000 people were there. And we stayed there for that night and about two nights. And\nwe were famished. And they had a soup kitchen is that what it was. And we ate the soup that\nthey served us and that was the best thing that we ever ate. I mean we were so hungry that\nanything and everything would have been just wonderful. Of course, I did not even have a period\nbecause all the excitement, no nourishment. Nothing. I mean so I didn\u2019t have to worry about that\nat that point. And so we were laying there with thousands. Like I said it was a dancing hall\nbefore and they called it Santa Ana cabaret. And we met some other people but they came, not\nall, too many of our people. And then we went and said, we walked along someplace else to see\nif we could find shelter elsewhere. And we came to this one man. And he said come upstairs\nand you know itll be ok. And I said \u201cno, I have to get my parents\u201d. He said \u201cbring your parents.\nI don\u2019t care\u201d. So I brought my parents and we stayed there for a night or so and I said, and then\nmy mother and dad said \u201cno we can\u2019t take his hospitality. He doesn\u2019t have enough himself.\u201d So\nwe started walking and we saw a house, a vacant house. Oh maybe a couple or three blocks away\nand we went towards that and we took shelter in there. Well that night it started again. The\nshelling and the firing and a bullet came in through the window, hit the, the iron bars and then\nfell on top of me. It burned me but did not penetrate. And it was on my breast and I threw it off\nyou know. And I thought I was going to, I thought I was shot. I mean very honestly I thought I\nwas shot, but it was just a hot bullet that had expanded its force. So the next morning, we knew\nwe couldn\u2019t stay there because there was a Japanese sen, a guy that used to be a sentry. He had\nstill hold out up there and he was shooting down at the Americans. The Americans didn\u2019t even\nknow he was there until I showed them the bullet. I said I got shot. And they said let me see the\nbullet. And they said that\u2019s a Japanese bullet or German. What do I know and they said I will,\nI'd like to have it. I said if you give it back to me. That\u2019s got to be my souvenir. I never saw it\nagain. So then where do we go from here. Well we didn\u2019t\u2019 really know. So then my sister and I\nwalked. I said well while we are still in that house because we had nowhere else to go. They\nwere trying to shoot him and we were in the, in the fire line ok. But finally the, the shooting\nstopped. I said Eva, you and I. Let\u2019s go and I\u2019Il get, I hear there\u2019s a well not far away. Let\u2019s go\nwash our hair. I can\u2019t stand 1t anymore. we are full of mud. And everything else and dust and\nwhat have you. So we walked to the shelter over there. I mean to the well over there. Got,\nwashed our hair. On the way back we run into a GI. And he says \u201ca white girl. Out here, white\nkids. What happened. I didn\u2019t think any white people were here.\u201d And I said \u201cyeah, yeah we\nhave white people here. Well this is my sister and our name is Mijinski, Margot Mijinski. He\nsaid you Jewish? I said \u201cyes\u201d. I said \u201cyeah so are my parents. I want you to meet them\u201d. So we\nwent back where the house was you know. And he said \u201cyou guys can\u2019t stay here. Come with\nme.\u201d And it turned out he was Jewish too. He was 33 years old. He was invasion forces, armed\nforces 37 Division. And he was the one that gave me my very first book, reading material. And\nthen he somehow, he managed to take us and other people to Caisson City where they will put us\ninto an old school house that we, they converted for refugees. So I don\u2019t know how many, again\na hundred people or more were in this very small school house. And we, they divided, the\npartitions were like sheets. Families were like that. And that\u2019s then I got myself a job from my\ngirlfriend. She saw me.",
        "A: Yes it was. That was Ernest Benesch. Our savior. He was, he brought us fruits, he brought\nus food, at, ever he could get from the commissary over there and from the mess hall. And he\ngave us some food and K, K rations. I mean he was the very first one to give us something like\nthat. And even some chocolate. I mean he was just wonderful.",
        "A: We were in that school house for a long time. We then around the corner we found that\nsomebody had an empty almost like a shack. It was horrible, no rugs, we had cement floors. But\nthere were a couple of beds in there so we were there. And from there we, we waited until our\nvisa, then they con, everybody contacted us. The Red Cross was around of course. They gave us\nclothing. We had nothing as you know They gave us clothing. They even gave me my first\nsanitary napkin. And they fed us. I mean we just kind of survived and we couldn\u2019t leave until\n1948 and we were in that very, around the corner from that school house. We were staying there.",
        "A: Ok. I had after liberation, when we are still in that school house I had to go downtown. I\nwasn\u2019t going to just wait for something to happen. And I was walking and all of a sudden\nsomebody said Margot, Margot. And I\u2019m looking around. Who is, who 1s calling me and it was\nmy girlfriend Rosie Helman. And Siggy Helman. Come up here, come up here. I said my\ngoodness. I said you are alive. Oh they were, we just hugged and kissed and cried. I mean that\nwas such a wonderful reunion. You have no idea. And, oh I went upstairs to the Helmans and\nthey had food and they sent some food home with me to that place. And I was able to give my\nparents, my sister, some sausage and a few other things. And they told me that they are opening\nan officers billets and they\u2019d like me to come work for them and that\u2019s what exactly happened.\nThey opened the officers billets. I went to work there as a receptionist. And I was really so\ninnocent and so ignorant of everything. I saw balloons laying there. I thought and I was asking\nthe boy the houseboy to give me them for my sister. And he says no, I\u2019m not going to give you\nthat. I said why not. My sister is only 12 years old. I said I want to give her something that she\nhasn\u2019t had in years. And I said I don\u2019t even know if she ever knows what a balloon looks like.\nHe says no I can\u2019t give you that. I was so upset. When I went upstairs to see the Helmans. I\nslept over there by the way. I only went back home on weekends cause the distance was very far\nand I had to walk. There was no transportation. There was nothing. And so I told the Helmans\nwhat had happened. That these beautiful new balloons were laying there. They wouldn\u2019t even\ngive me one for my sister. And they said no you don\u2019t want that. That\u2019s those rubbers that the\nofficers use when they bring in girls and then it dawned on me what it actually was. But that\u2019s\nhow, to show you how innocent and how ignorant I was. And then, from then on in, I was able\nto bring food to my parents and I met a lot of officers up there, GIs and they took us to dances\nand Rosie and I and Siggy they took us to all these dances. But you know every time there was\nbackfire from a truck, I thought it was an explosion. I dove under the under anything and\neverything I could find for protection. And they would just stand there and laugh. I said look\nit\u2019s a very sad experience for me. Don\u2019t laugh. Because to me I feel like I\u2019m being shot at. And\nit took me a long time to get over this backfire. I always thought that I was being shot. And so\nwe went over there and then the rabbi, the chaplain, we had a Passover at one of the\ncommissaries or whatever. He was able to locate a place; that was our very first Passover. And\nwe, in fact I still have their Passover books, the Hagadah in a bound, what the GIs would carry\nwith them. And that rabbi Felden was the very first chaplain that was in 1946, we had our very\nfirst Passover. And I was so nervous. I was so upset about everything. That I, well I was nervous\nto go to a dance. I would break out in hives. I mean completely from top to bottom. And I was\nitching and I was, and then I found out I was allergic to the shellfish that I was eating at the\nHelmans. | didn\u2019t know what I was supposed to eat. Besides that, I wanted to go back just one\nmore time. My mother had pleurisy before we were liberated. And we talked to this a rabbi like\nperson. Maybe it was Mr. Konigsberg. At this point I don\u2019t\u2019 even know who told us. It\u2019s ok to\neat pork. You got to get meat, you got to eat meat. Otherwise, you\u2019 ll never get over this pleurisy.\nAnd my mother didn\u2019t want to. He said look you\u2019Il making, doing a sin more so by not eating\nthan you would be by trying to survive. The thing 1s now survival. And that\u2019s when finally she\nwould eat. We would try to buy some meat for her, not us, for her but she shared with us of\ncourse. We\u2019d buy just the, the like the hoofs or the head or something because we had to cook\nthat up for her and it was the hardest thing for her to do, to eat that. And then finally we got\nvisas and it was in 1948, in February. And we boarded upon an army transport and women in one\nsection, men in another section lined up for the mess hall to eat. We went over Shanghai because\nwe didn\u2019t have, we didn\u2019t\u2019 have any warm clothes so in Shanghai we got some clothes. And\nthen we made it to our San Francisco where our relatives and aunt Ruth. She in the meantime\nafter her husband had passed away, Mr. Binger, she married Ernest Karliner who also adopted\nmy cousin. And they were waiting for us. They had an apartment just across from them. And\nSO We were, we were taken in over there. And I met my husband in the Golden Gate Park. He\nwas seeing a friend of his. We were walking very first week we arrived. We were walking in the\nGolden Gate Park and my husband saw this friend of his that came from Shanghai. And he came\nup to me, up to the where we were and he says oh how about you. I haven\u2019t seen you since\nShanghai. He\u2019s telling his friend. And the friend said oh let me introduce to you Ernie and\nMargie Mijinski and he said to my husband. Now my husband said to me, you know you look\nlike somebody I know. You look somebody like, somebody I know. I said \u201csure I\u2019ve heard that\nline before.\u201d He said \u201cno I mean it. You look like a Mrs. Karliner. I says Karliner, that\u2019s my\naunt.\u201d And he says my goodness, they\u2019ve been telling me about you for years, that if you ever\ncome to the states, I must meet you. And slowly we got together and about, this was in 1948\nwhen we came. And in 1949 I got married.",
        "A: Well because it took so long because my mother had German quota. My dad was Polish\nquota. Even though he never really lived in Poland but he was now Katowice, it was Polish.\nAnd the Polish had a very small quota. And so he said you guys go ahead and we would leave\nhim. In fact, in Germany they offered the children to be taken to England and we refused. I said\nI\u2019m not going without you mom and dad and my sister. I\u2019m not leaving. Oh no you take your\nlittle sister with you. I said no way, I\u2019m not. And that\u2019s we stayed together and when we got to\nSan Francisco, my dad got a job as a janitor. I worked, I was trying to sell advertising which I\nhad in my middle I was, after the war I was selling movie slides advertising. And that\u2019s how I\nwas helping to support my parents. And that\u2019s, and then my husband, he had a bakery in\nOakland. So after we got married, I worked in the bakery. So.",
        "A: Well we had to get started. We had nothing. Just what the Red Cross had given us. And so\nwe had to get a life again. But we stayed up in the, with furnished apartment where my aunt\nlived on side. We lived on the other same floor. It was very beautiful apartment. And like I said\nI went looking for a job right away. I got a job through an agency in an insurance company. I\nworked there. They promised me they would promote me, promote me but every time three\nmonths were up they put me into another and wouldn\u2019t give me a raise. And after the second\ntime I said forget it. I\u2019m out of here and I left and I had another job and then we got married and\nI moved to Oakland and we are now in the United States already since 1948.",
        "A: It certainly did. I wanted to marry another Jewish man of my background and he was\nsomebody that I really liked. A very gentle, generous caring person. And we\u2019ve been married\n47 years.",
        "A: Never really did. We had to assume. We tried to contact them then through the Aufbau,\nthrough all the different Jewish organizations and there was absolutely no trace of anybody alive,\nnobody. So we had to assume that they all perished because there is nobody, nobody ever\nresponded. The Jewish committee, the HIAS, the Joint. Nobody was able to locate anybody. And\nas far as it having affected me personally. As I have been getting older, it\u2019s been harder and I\u2019m\nnow in therapy. Under a psychologist because things are, they\u2019re really getting to me. And \u2019ma\nvery nervous person and the therapist feels that this all dates back to my young days when I was\ngrowing up. Not enough food. Leaving my grandmother leaving that I think was the hardest part\nof my whole exodus of Germany, having to leave my grandmother, my aunt, my uncle, but my\ngrandmother was the number one. And then I never got to see her again. So that\u2019s about it.\n"
