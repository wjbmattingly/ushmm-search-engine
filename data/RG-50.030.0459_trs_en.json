He -- He made his work extremely honestly, you saw the M.D., and In -\n- what I positively know, that he treated people having no money at all, and he never\nasked them to pay, because he knew that they -- they was un -- they were unable to pay.\nHe considered the -- this profession to do something necessary for -- for his -- he --\ncolleagues, for his -- not only for his friends, but for -- for human beings, and he -- I\nremember of a certain Marinka, who was a Gypsy lady, and who -- who didn\u2019t wear\nshoes, and -- but who had -- he was -- she had problem with hi -- with her teeth, and so\nshe -- she knew that he will -- she will not pay, and my father -- my father knew that he\nhad -- can -- he cannot require -- cannot ask any money because she hadn\u2019t.

And -- And then the -- the SS, it was -- the contact with the SS was not\ndirect. The contact was every day, the so-called appelle, you know re -- what it is --\nwhat it was. And -- And so, if -- if one person was missing, they had to start again, to\ncount again, but it took hours, and you can imagine then, it happened to me, that th-the\nfood was so horrible that I became a very gr-great diarrhea, and I couldn\u2019t go out,\nbecause we had to stay there, and I -- I -- I had no solution, so it went. And very bad sign,\nflies were coming -- is wa -- by the way, flies were the only animals we saw, plus the SS\ndogs, but there was no butterfly, nothing, no birds, just flies. And -- And so 1-1-1-it was a\nextreme -- extremely bad, the appelle, and the -- but this has been ordered by the SS. I --\nWhat I don\u2019t understand, the logic of the whole thing, because if somebody was missing,\nit was not sure, and there never was one -- plus one, only minus one, and -- and they had\nto find out where it -- where he was. So it -- it took time. The Jewish commanders, or the\nsous-commandersHndeeipherable} were also quite bad because -- because they -- they --\nthey regularly stole the midare--- the -- the food. You know, I had a couple of times,\ncontact with Mengele, because he came several times to select. And the selections,\nApril 24, 2000\n| which;+ you know what it was, first the -- the cynism, because the first selection took\nplace on September 15\", which was Rosh Hashanah. The second for Yom Kippur, so\nthey -- they apparently knew the Jewish calendar. And then I -- I think that nobody spoke\nof the smiling side of Mengele. Mengele could smile, and he selected the deaths smiling,\nwith rapture, a little bit. And if somebody didn\u2019t obey, then he became very angry. But\nhe -- But otherwise, he was smiling, and -- to make this job. You know, there is\nsomething very perverse in the whole thing. For instance if the -- the\n| Gauleitergauti\u00a2hter, or I don\u2019t know, the commander -- not commander, was something\nlike that, commander -- I -- I -- I don\u2019t know [indecipherable] the military, or\n[indecipherable] the man who -- Frank, a very, very famous and a horrible man of\nHitler, who was the commander of Poland, after having finished his job, he went home\nto play Bach on the piano, because this is German culture. I could tell you something\n| else, which is perhaps not a direct answerfindeeipherable} but the -- to understand this\nmentality, a -- a -- excuse me, but I -- I think I -- I will say it, if you don\u2019t want it, leave it\nout. I had a -- I have a sister-in-law in Berlin, and we -- we went very often to Berlin,\nand I know a -- a -- a good friend in north Germany, who is a chor -- chorus -- choir --\nchoir conductor, and a man who -- with incredible knowledge. And his first wife, or the\ndaughter of a lady who is living -- the lady lived in Bielefeld Vi-Vidafeld, and the\ndaughter said, \u201cYou know, Paris and indecipherable} Berlin is so far. Go to my\nmother, the house is big, and you can -- you can take a rest -- at night.\u201d And we did this\nseveral times. In 1977, when our si_ thi-third boy was born, I -- I examined the boy, of\nApril 24, 2000\ncourse, as a good father, and I considered that his ears were a little bit different of the\nother ears of the family. It wa -- He was born in September, and a couple of months later,\n| we went to Christmas, to Berlin with this station, she -- Madame S.Ess. And do you\nknow, after dinner, kinder -- the children went to bed, and after dinner nobody in\nGermany will sit down with a -- with white wine to gossip, and to [indecipherable] and\n| on this day, Mrs. S.Ess said, \u201cYou know, it was in the period with my -- my husband was _\nin prison.\u201d \u201cYour husband in prison? How?\u201d \u201cMy daughter never told you?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d And,\n\u201cHe was in prison.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause he was a very high SS officer, and his\nspecialtyspecialty was to examine Jewish n-noses and ears.\u201d And Madame -- Madame\nS.Ess, when we arrived, I told her that this is very different from the others, and she\nexamined very carefully the ears, but I don\u2019t know why. And after dinner, I learned that\nnot only her husband was a high officer for racism, but his brother as well. In the\nmeantime, this friend and -- divorced. And it was 1988, I -- I made recordings in Israel,\nwith the Israel symp -- Philharmonic Orchestra, and we called te-each other. \u201cNow what\ndi -- what -- what did you do the last time?\u201d \u201cOh, I# was in Israel. I went to do\nrecording, I -- Mozart flutereet concertos.\u201d \u201cOh, I know very well the Mozart flutereet\nconcertos, because my -- my father-in-law played it very often.\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d I said, \u201cThe --\nThe Nazi?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d And he said, \u201cYes.\u201d Uh-huh. He called Martin, a very, very, very\n| nice man. I said, \u201cMartin, how is it possible to -- to -- to examine Jewish raciesm, and --\nand -- and Mozart?\u201d He answered with one word. \u201cDeutsch.\u201d German. So this Frank\nplayed Bach, they played Mozart, and in the meantime they killed millions. Isn\u2019t it\nApril 24, 2000\nbeautiful? Of course, it happened after the war, but the -- but I think that you -- you\nshould examine all these problems in da -- in the -- it\u2019s totality, and not -- not only the\n| margarine indecipherable} in Auschwitz, because it was bad indecipherable} in then -\n- in -- in -- in -- in -- in -- and very little.

So therefore, I\n| think that what +eu-we are doing -- what you are doing, I am doing now, is finally, this is\nhopeless, and th-th -- it 1s not -- because I cannot tell you -- you -- you ask what was it\nlike. The question is -- has been made in such a way that I understand that you will -- you\ncannot imagine what it was. In -- In no -- I -- I -- I know -- I know no human being\ncapable of imagining such a horror. So this is -- this is not a -- this is not a normal level,\nyou know. So this experience is not transferable. I made this experience, and now I -- it\nbelongs to me, and -- and I -- it is one of my -- my greatest experiences of -- of -- of -- of\nlife. But I cannot transfer it -- it -- it -- is the -- is the film of shi -- of Schindler, cannot\n| be a -- a realistic film, because you cannot find 200-two hundred actors, and to -- to lock\nthem, and let them lose the weight. So this -- you can\u2019t -- you cannot do it. So if you\ncan\u2019t, the pictures you will see will be wrong, and will not correspond to the -- to the\nreality. So this is not feasible. Only if somebody organized a ki -- a camp, and you went\ninto the camp, but I d -- I don\u2019t wish you to go there, so these a -- it\u2019s an initial\ncontradiction in the thing, and -- and I think that what we can, we have to do to -- not to\nlive with every day, but to think of it, to do -- to know that this is not a normal museum,\nthis is a museum of the death, and -- and this -- the whole story is the story of the death,\nand the death is -- the death -- death is horrible, it\u2019s horrible to die with 15 or fi -- 16. It\u2019s\nhorrible to die, to -- I -- I knew a lady whose child, I don\u2019t know, three or four weeks old,\nApril 24, 2000\nhave been -- have -- have -- have been taken away and killed, and not the lady. And the\nlady came back from the camp during this -- during her entire life, hi -- she lived with\nthis -- with this dead baby. So, this is -- So this kind of atris -- of atrocities, if I tell you,\nand you -- you -- you write it down, somebody read it -- reads it, but it\u2019s still a piece of\npaper. So this is not imaginable, you -- you are -- you are asking concrete questions, and\nthis is okay, but as I am not -- you -- you see that I was not able to ex -- to -- to -- to\nspeak of the ambiance of the selected, because -- because it is -- it is -- it is horrible.\nImagine 200 people in a -- in America, waiting on the electric chair together. What will\nthey say? Who would cry, who would shout? So, but this is -- this is -- it cannot happen.",
        "Q: I think you just said a lot.",
        "A: So that\u2019s it?",
        "Q: No. I\u2019m just saying --",
        "A: -- who did it is Primo Levi, but there\u2019s no more Primo Levi. Well, I think I could go\nat SIx.",
        "Q: What time is it?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: At the end of the march, how -- what kind of state were you in physically?",
        "A: Ho, I cannot describe you. We have been sent to a building, completely dark, and from\nthis building, of course by feet to the gareguar -- to the -- to the s -- railway station. Once\nmore, | remember of the tramway in GleiwitzGlivitz, and I was very interested by this __\ntramway, and the whole atmosphere, because i -- the ga -- the war was before",
        "April 24, 2000\n| GleiwitzGhivitz, and the people -- people wanted to go away. So it was as -- fantastic\nmovement in the -- in the -- in the town, to -- to -- to escape, not -- not only the -- not\nprisoners, but normal civilians.\n| Q: S-So you were in GleiwitzGlwitz?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you\u2019 re saying that there\u2019s a sense that the -- the -- the -- that there\u2019s a lot of\nmovement, and -- and -- and really maybe that the war is winding down, or -- or going to\npeak, I guess.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. D-Did you begin to start imagining that you might be liberated?",
        "A: Not there. It was impossible. Of course, everybody li -- to liber -- to be liberated was a\ndream, but we didn\u2019t know how. And what the Germans did, it was -- it made no sense to\ntransport Jewish prisoners, and to lose the war. To -- To use the rail for -- to transport\npeople somewhere, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t know exactly where and how, between\n| GleiwitzGlivitz and Dora NordhausenNorthhausen, | think his number is five -- five\nhours of driving, and we did it in one week, in this open -- opened, coal cars. It made no\nsense, so they paralyzed for one week, a train, the rails, and whatever, to transport us, and\nthey did the same two month later to transport to Bergen-Belsen on April -- we arrive on\nApril 10\", and the British army, the 15\". So it made no sense to send ou -- to send\nsomebody from the Americans, who they -- this was the American territory, I think well\nApril 24, 2000\nwe're -- where we were last time were, to the British territory. It made no sense. So what\nis the advantage to be liberated by the British instead of the Americans? So -- Or -- I --",
        "Q: Can you describe the moment of liberation?",
        "A: Yes. Th-The German there, the -- the HakenkreuzHaakenereise has been put by --\nput down, but you know, I was in a very bad, then I was 4+indecipherable}in very bad\nhealth, and a couple of days are missing, so you know that I remember of the days, a\ncouple of days are missing, because very probably I was in a kind of coma, and instead of\n| -- | -- -- I didn\u2019t die, findeeipherable}a had a big chance, because on perhaps the 10\"\nor the 11\" of May, I asked a -- a ge -- a German soldier, who became prisoner in the\nmeantime, \u201cHow about the war?\u201d And he said, \u201cThe war? The war is finished.\u201d And then\nI understood that I felt out for a -- a good couple of days.",
        "Q: S-So you don\u2019t remember the British soldiers coming in, and --",
        "A: Yes, the British soldiers coming in, yes, but it happened later. The British soldiers\ncame on April 15\", the end of the war on May eighth, and the -- and for me the 10 or\n11, so something is miss -- something was missing, and then I gi -- went out and met\n| people, they saidsays, \u201cOh, you are still alive.\u201d We didn\u2019t -- We -- We didn\u2019t think that\nhe -- we are alive.",
        "Q: What was that like when the -- can you just describe what it was like when the British\nsoldiers came in to Bergen-Belsen?",
        "A: Yes, I think this is the HakenkreuzHaakenereise, and the fact that we realized\nfindecipherable} that it is finished, that this was finished, but the health was bad. So the\nApril 24, 2000\nliberty was there, but the British -- not the British, nobody -- nobody knew how to handle\nth-this kind of -- of -- of -- of living -- living death people, so you can imagine that i -- I -\n- if -- if you lose 50 percent of your weight, approximately, how do you want to oblige\nyour stomach and your body to work? You couldn\u2019t. And they gave fat and meat, and --\nand plenty of things, they -- they gave what they had, but what they -- what they -- but\nwhat they di -- they didn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t resolve, this -- this -- the -- the -- the health situation.",
        "Q: What was wrong with you?",
        "A: I thi -- I think that I had typhus, I think, because the typhus is provoked by -- what\u2019s\nthe name of this small --",
        "Q: Mosquito?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Very small insects.",

        "A: Y -- No.",
        "Q: Lice?",
        "A: Yes, perhaps.",
        "Q: Lice. In the hair?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.\nApril 24, 2000",
        "A: Yes. And I didn\u2019t realize, because I -- in Bergen \u2014 Dora, Bergendera-\u2014we were\nworking -- I was really working on the weapon miracle of Hitler, the Vl Fee \u2014 V2\u00a5Vee\nene-vee-tywe. And I -- I wore these glass bands, glass tapes, and of course i-it provoked\nmy -- my [indecipherable}+ve-were. And I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t realize that the position\nbetween the glass and the -- and the insects. It was horrible. I -- Imagine one sh -- one\nshirt you had 200 - 300. Well -- Well, so I think we could continue this conversation\neternally. I think the most important thing is that I don\u2019t know if the Jewish are really the\nchosen people, maybe. If it is -- If it is so, our experience concerns the huma -- hu -- the\nentire humanity. This is not only a Jewish problem, because people are very inventive,\nand new methods of killing will arrive. And I think that -- that we cannot be -- we cannot\n| agree with Serge KlarsfeldKtassfeld, you know him, a very important journalist, and --\nand especially of Holocaust and the -- and war criminals. I met him once in the air -- the\n| air -- at the airport, and I told him who I was, that I was also in a concentration camp,\netcetera, and I see -- and I ask him, what do you think, w-wouldn\u2019t it be better to -- to try\nto share this experience with other people having the same conditions, or similar\nconditions? And he said, \u201cThey have to find th-the right solution. This is our problem\nnow.\u201d And I think not -- I don\u2019t think that is our problem. I think that is of course our --\nour problem, but if such a horror arrives to a -- to a people, and you see that something\nsimilar, and more cynical arrived in Cambodia when the -- the head of the state started to\nkill his own population, and -- and you -- we -- we see everywhere where we -- in hoot --\nin Bu-Burundi, and the hoot -- Tutsies and Hutus and -- and the -- Kosovo, and\nApril 24, 2000\nwhatever. So I think that this experience should be -- must be strong enough to go over --\nto let understand by other people, that these experience should serve to somehow --\nsomehow to immunize hum -- huma -- the whole humanity, to -- to try to think before\nthey -- they s -- they start such horrors. I think this is -- this must be the message of\n| everybody having survived this -- findecipherable}this horrible period of ya -- of -- of\nhuman history.

So it -- it took time. The Jewish commanders, or the\nsous-commandersHndeeipherable} were also quite bad because -- because they -- they --\nthey regularly stole the midare--- the -- the food.

Mengele could smile, and he selected the deaths smiling,\nwith rapture, a little bit. And if somebody didn\u2019t obey, then he became very angry. But\nhe -- But otherwise, he was smiling, and -- to make this job. You know, there is\nsomething very perverse in the whole thing.

And after dinner, I learned that\nnot only her husband was a high officer for racism, but his brother as well. In the\nmeantime, this friend and -- divorced. And it was 1988, I -- I made recordings in Israel,\nwith the Israel symp -- Philharmonic Orchestra, and we called te-each other. \u201cNow what\ndi -- what -- what did you do the last time?\u201d \u201cOh, I# was in Israel.

The question is -- has been made in such a way that I understand that you will -- you\ncannot imagine what it was. In -- In no -- I -- I -- I know -- I know no human being\ncapable of imagining such a horror. So this is -- this is not a -- this is not a normal level,\nyou know. So this experience is not transferable. I made this experience, and now I -- it\nbelongs to me, and -- and I -- it is one of my -- my greatest experiences of -- of -- of -- of\nlife. But I cannot transfer it -- it -- it -- is the -- is the film of shi -- of Schindler, cannot\n| be a -- a realistic film, because you cannot find 200-two hundred actors, and to -- to lock\nthem, and let them lose the weight. So this -- you can\u2019t -- you cannot do it. So if you\ncan\u2019t, the pictures you will see will be wrong, and will not correspond to the -- to the\nreality. So this is not feasible. Only if somebody organized a ki -- a camp, and you went\ninto the camp, but I d -- I don\u2019t wish you to go there, so these a -- it\u2019s an initial\ncontradiction in the thing, and -- and I think that what we can, we have to do to -- not to\nlive with every day, but to think of it, to do -- to know that this is not a normal museum,\nthis is a museum of the death, and -- and this -- the whole story is the story of the death,\nand the death is -- the death -- death is horrible, it\u2019s horrible to die with 15 or fi -- 16.

So, this is -- So this kind of atris -- of atrocities, if I tell you,\nand you -- you -- you write it down, somebody read it -- reads it, but it\u2019s still a piece of\npaper.
