But I remember when I was in\nthe children home, very, very young, the Germans came in and start shooting the\nkids. And they \u2014 that part left me in such a horror, so when I came to Israel, I\nwould always think about a fox who \u2014 who killed the kids except me. And when I\nmet the [indecipherable] here, I ask her, why they shoot the kids? Why they didn\u2019t\nkill me? So she said, the kids were boys who were circumcised. You were a girl so\nyou were not circumcised, that\u2019s why. So the Germans were looking for\ncircumcised boys to kill them, and they killed them right there at the spot. And\nluckily \u2014 I was wounded also, with one of the shots, and I still have \u2014 I have as \u2014 in\nmy leg, a problem with that. Both legs, yeah.",

And the woman, who was a good friend of her, a Christian wowan \u2014\nwoman, her name was hern \u2014 Helena Westerly. And she had a plan.

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 from the ghetto, with a baby, so to speak?",

And in 1944, she \u2014 she went \u2014\nNovember 8, 2008\nthey were raiding the partisan, the Germans. At one point I do remember that I was\nin a train, I do not know what\u2019s happened exactly. I was on a train and that \u2014 in a\ntrain, a lot of people were there. They couldn\u2019t move, nothing. And I saw people\njumping off the train, escaping. And I was told to be quiet. And then the train got hit\nby a mi \u2014 by a mine or something they threw. The partisan attacked the train, and\nthe train could not go any farther, and I don\u2019t have no more memory after that,\nwhat\u2019s happened. This is one of the things I remember. And I remember I was in the\nwoods with a man, a tall man, and he told me to be behind the tree, to wait for him,\nhe\u2019ll going in the woods, not to move. I stood behind it \u2014 a wide tree so nobody can\nsee me, which I waited there, and the man never came back. So I went to look for\nthe man, and I saw him lay on the floor, with blood in his mouth, and his eyes open.\nSo I start talking to the man to take me with him, and why he doesn\u2019t talk? Why he\nlook at me and doesn\u2019t say nothing? So suddenly a woman come out from the\nwoods, and she told me, this man is dead. I said, what does it mean dead? And she\ntold me, a person that cannot talk, cannot breathe, and cannot speak and can do\nnothing. That\u2019s it. And I ne \u2014I do not know who was that man.",

        "Q: What exactly had happened to her?",
        "A: That she joined the partisan, and the Germans attacked the partisan, and she was\nguarding at the time the partisans, and they shot her. They \u2014 she was fighting with\nthe Germans, and she killed quite a few Germans too, I was told. So it wasn\u2019t like\nshe just went and they killed her. There was a big fight between the partisan and the\nGermans, and she got shot off. She was fighting with them \u2014 against the Germans\ntoo, at the time.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to your \u2014 to your experiences in a nursing home.",
        "A: So, I look at her as a hero.",
        "Q: Yeah, you should.",

And they used to beat me\nup with a stick, a big bamboo stick. They used to go and have the kids surrounding\nme, and especially bef \u2014 during the \u2014 a Christian holiday, they beat me up so hard,\nand they make \u2014 made the kids and every \u2014 the kids were getting present, except\nme. I didn\u2019t get nothing. And they used \u2014 the kids used to make fun, hey, I got this,\nand I got this, and you \u2014 what you got? And that\u2019s it. So they used to beat me up ev\n\u2014 particular almost every day, until they told me if I stop screaming from the pain I\ngot, then they\u2019Il stop beating me. So I had to stop screaming, and then they stopped\nbeating me up with the stick.",
        "Q: Were there other Jewish children as well, or \u2014",
        "A: I do not know, I\u2019m not \u2014 I don\u2019t recall it. I\u2019m the one that was \u2014 happened to me.",

The nun\nused to beat me up. She used to wear the white things, and she used to beat me up\nso hard. So I used to hate the nuns there, yeah.",

        "Q: \u2014 and the other children in the \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, in front of the other children.",
        "Q: How much time did you spend in this home, do you know?",
        "A: I think that was until 1946 or \u201945, I don\u2019t remember exactly.",
        "Q: So you were still very young when you \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, I was very young, yeah.",
        "Q: What happened afterwards, after this experience in \u2014",
        "A: My uncle, Max Pajewski(ph), he\u2019s a brother of my father \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He was fighting during the war against a rush \u2014 against the Germans at the\nRussian front in Russia. And then the war was over. The Russians allow any Polish\nNovember 8, 2008\ncitizen to return back to Poland. So, he was allowed to return back, so he went back\nto the city. And Helena Westerly was looking for him, because they said, Mina\nPajewski(ph) did not come back from Poland \u2014 I mean, from the war. And what\u2019s\ngoing to be with Sonja? My name was Sonja, Sonja Pajewski(ph). What\u2019s going\non with Sonja Pajewski(ph) is still there? And so \u2014 and that nobody came to pick\nher up. So she went to the bazaar places to look for somebody from the family, and\none day she met my uncle there, and she told him that \u2014 that \u2014 where I am, and he\ndidn't even know I was born. And \u2014 because he left the place in 1941, before I was\nborn. And he \u2014 the Russian took me. They move into a remote area, that\u2019s why. So\nmeanwhile, I was born, and all that, and I\u2014 now he found out that I\u2019m \u2014 that he has\na niece there. So he went to the children home, and he told them that he is my\nfather. So they let him to take me out, and he went with me \u2014 he did tell me that he\nbought me a piece of \u2014 a bread with piece of butter \u2014 with \u2014 a bread with butter to\neat, and he says, somebody came and stole the bread from my hands, and I cried.\nNow he did say that I had a lot of bruises all over my body, and I suffer from severe\nmalnutrition, I looked so bad. And he \u2014 we went to Poland, to Warszawa,\nWarsaw. And at that time, I think Slonim became part of \u2014 part of Soviet Union\nalready, I think, at the time. So we \u2014 we went to rush \u2014 he brought me to\nWarszawa, to \u2014 and he\u2019s staying some Jewish place, the Jewish agency helped two\nNovember 8, 2008\nof us, and there was a place they were \u2014 they helped different de \u2014 different\nrefugees, and so they helped me and my uncle. And he told me that I \u2014 I slept in bed\n\u2014 in one bed, because they didn\u2019t have enough beds there. And I again did wee-wee\non the \u2014 you know, pee-pee on the bed, and he got all wet from that. And that\u2019s was\nmy problem at that time. Then he \u2014 he was very sick, so he couldn\u2019t take care of\nme, and he \u2014 he sent \u2014 he gave me to a Jewish agency, and tha-that was to send me\nto Palestine, at the time was Palestine, not Israel yet. So the Jewish agency took\nme and put me in Lodz, in a children home. I do not know where in L\u00e9dz, what city\n\u2014 I like to know all these particular. If you can find out this information, please\nallow me to know that.",
        "Q: Yep.",
        "A: All right. In L\u00e9dz, I was staying sometimes there, and \u2014 until maybe \u201948, and\nthen we \u2014 we traveled from one place to another place. In the middle of the night\nthe \u2014 they brought big truck, military truck came up \u2014 came in, pulled me out of the\nbed, put hand on my mouth and said, don\u2019t talk, be quiet. And they took me and put\nme in that truck, and they told me we going to Palestine. But meanwhile, I don\u2019t \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t remember if they took other kids or not with them. It \u2014 I\u2019m not really\nremember very well. But they took me and they \u2014 we went to different places, I do\nnot know where, what. From one place to another place, again traveled through\nNovember 8, 2008\nEurope again, illegally, just like I did with my mother when my mother escaped\nfrom the ghetto and went and traveled, and somehow went back to the city, I think\nto her husband. That\u2019s why she returned back, because she couldn\u2019t \u2014 nobody help\nher there and she couldn\u2019t do nothing. So she had to return back. But she \u2014 I was in\nBelgium before, and France and other countries, and somehow we return back to\nPoland. I mean, that\u2019s when my mother was still alive. This time I was moving\nfrom one country to another country. And the paper, according to the paper, they\nput me on the ship Sylvania(ph), and they \u2014 we \u2014 to Palestine. In the boat, I had a\nfriend, the name Natala(ph), and she is in Israel today. And she was in my children\nhome too, because I visited Israel in 2004, and we see that we [indecipherable]\ntogether, Natala(ph) and me. And on the boat, I do not know \u2014 the British caught us\non the boat when we were close to Palestine \u2014 everybody was so happy \u2014 the\nBritish caught us and arrested us and put us 1n a prison. So, I think I was about six\nyear old at that time, I became a prisoner of United Kingdom. And I don\u2019t know\nhow long we were, but in a prison for long time. I was freezing, was not much \u2014 I\nremember they put fences there, and we were sleeping in a tent in Israel because\nthere was not enough space, and \u2014 and it was very cold and freezing, and not\nenough food over there to \u2014 and, by the way, on the boat to \u2014 to Israel was not\nenough food to eat also, and every day we ate only fish. And I hated fish so much\nNovember 8, 2008\nbecause all \u2014 every meal was only fish, too, there was no other food to eat, any\nmore left. And that was very tough, and that boat was also \u2014 people were, I think,\nTurkish, Arabs, Turkish were on that boat, too. And they wear the red hat that\nTurkish wear, and I think they were Turkish, and I used to be afraid of them so\nmuch. And somebody was saying on the boat that they stealing the kids, too. So I\nalways frightened from them. Anyway, on the way back in \u2014 back to \u2014 I mean\nPalestine, and then Israel was declared as a state, I was taken out of the prison and\nlater on they send me to a foster family in Israel. And the name of the family,\nGoldschmidt [indecipherable] DDR [indecipherable] near Netanya. And I had\nfoster family, and that was \u2014 life was not easy beginning because I had \u2014 I had to\nget used to new \u2014 to a family life, which I never had family before. And a home I\nhad never had before. And they were very tough, they were Germans from\nGermany. And \u2014 Jewish Germans, and they were very, very tough disciplinary\npeople, and they discipline me with the \u2014 a lot of hitting. I got again a lot of hitting.\nAnd I did, again, pee-pee in the bed. And they hit me for that also. And so the wa \u2014\nlife wasn\u2019t easy. But then first grade I didn\u2019t do good because in the school, first\ngrade, I used all the time to dream about the fox who eated the kids, except me not.\nSo I couldn\u2019t concentrate in the class, and I was \u2014 I didn\u2019t do good in school. So\nthey decided I\u2019m going to be left over, and take the class first grade again. So the\nNovember 8, 2008\nfoster family said no, she cannot. I\u2019m going to sit with her during the summer, and\ndon\u2019t leave her, because she has friends there now, and she used to them. And this\nwill be a crime for her to \u2014 to move to new fr \u2014 kids, and again the same class. So\nmy foster mother sat with me every day, teach me math and teach me to read and\nwrite, and believe me on that, by the end of the summer I took a test for the first\ngrade, I passed it. Second grade I became the best student in the class.",
        "Q: That\u2019s fantastic.",
        "A: Yeah. And from then on I became very, very good student, and I focus on school\nvery much. When I became a \u2014 when I became a \u2014 a 10 year old \u2014 so far they knew\nmy name was Esther Pajewski(ph), but they \u2014 they did not know anything about\nmy family, and they thought everybody died during the war, for me. And I took\ntheir name, their name was Goldschmidt. The father name was Elie Goldschmidt,\nand the mother name was Shoshanna Goldschmidt. Both were from Berlin,\nGermany. They immigrated to Israel in 1939, but they lost all their family in\nGermany. In 1939 they still were able to immigrate to Israel, and that\u2019s why they\nsurvived, this family. And in Israel they worked in agriculture. The \u2014 and they had\na house there, and it was a nice village, I \u2014 the life \u2014 and they were very, very\ndisciplinary people. Everything had to be just right. Everything on time exactly, and\nI got used to all this. If I came five minutes late, was almost like a crime, how you\nNovember 8, 2008\ndid such a thing? You have to be exactly by 12 o\u2019clock for lunch [indecipherable]\nexactly. Well, I got used to all this, and that was very nice. But then I had\nsomething happen at the age 10. I got sick, and they took me to the hospital to take\nx-rays, something happen. And the doctor over there say, you know what? There\u2019s a\ndoctor by the name Dr. Pajewski(ph). Maybe he\u2019II relate to this, because my last\nname Pajewski(ph) was. And they say, well, the do \u2014 the doctor in that hospital in\nNetanya say, you know what? We\u2019|l come talk to him, and see if he related to her.\nA \u2014 after \u2014 within short time, Dr. Pajewski(ph) come with a Jeep to the village, and\nthey \u2014 he wanted to see Sonja Pajewski(ph), which is me. And he came and found\nout that we are family members. And then he contacted my uncle in Italy, the\nbrother of my father was station \u2014 was in Italy at the time. And I think it was 1950.\nAnd \u2014 1950, and then I got a letter from Italy \u2014 they got a letter from Italy, and that\nwas written in Italian. And, that he, my uncle, and he\u2019s happy that I\u2019m alive, and all\nthat. And then sunny \u2014 one day came somebody from United States, a man, that he\nsay he my uncle \u2014 he \u2014 I have an uncle here, and he is \u2014 his name 1s Isaac\nMakowski(ph), a brother of my mother, and he want to meet me. And he came to\nsee how I am, and to meet me finally. Not my uncle, but he send somebody else to\nmeet me there. And tha \u2014 to \u2014 to see I\u2019m alive, he found out that I\u2019m alive. That\u2019s\nhappen after the accident with the \u2014 that \u2014 th-the Dr. Pajewski(ph). So, they\nNovember 8, 2008\ndiscover I have family members. Now became another problem. My uncle in \u2014\nIsaac Makowski(ph), who lives in \u2014 who at that time lived in Brooklyn, New\nYork, in United States, he was not happy with the family that I was living, because\nthey were not religious Jewish. They were nice people, Jewish, but they were not\nOrthodox like he was. He was Hassidic Orthodox Jew. So he contacted\n[indecipherable] my uncle, my other uncle, and \u2014 and he ask him to sign that my\nparents were Orthodox, and they wanted me to be Orthodox. So my case became in\na court, in Israeli court, and it took long time in Israeli court, and finally the Israeli\ncourt decided that I have to be removed for religious reason from \u2014 from\nGoldschmidt, from my foster family. So, after living in the house four and a half\nyears, I was ordered by the court to remove, if not the ca \u2014 the fa-family would be\narrested. So the family had to give me up, and they put me in a \u2014 in a Orthodox\nboarding school in Israel, and that was in a \u2014 and I\u2019m thinking a la \u2014 not Ramat\nGan, that\u2019s was in Benai Brak, very religious place, and they send me to a\nreligious school there, public school, a religious public school there, and to learn the\nreligion. Well, my uncle aimed to bring me to United States, that was in 1953. And\nI refused to come to United States at the time because I hated him for doing what\nhe did. So that came another family, and they told me that my uncle died, and they\nwanted to bring me to their house, to give me a home. I do not know who they\nNovember 8, 2008\nwere. And that family had twins. Babies, two ba \u2014 twins, and I do not know. I found\nout later on that \u2014 that my uncle just send me a letter, that couldn't be that he died.\nSo, it didn\u2019t work out. But then [indecipherable] so it didn\u2019t work out that way.\nAnd then I moved to Ramat Gan, that\u2019s another religious boarding school\nRa\u2019anana. Ra\u2019anana in Ra\u2019anana \u2014 Ra\u2019anana, I\u2019m sorry, in Kfar Batya,\nRa\u2019anana. That\u2019s a boarding school that I lived there, a elementary school, I was\nthere a few years until 19 \u2014 until my first year \u2014 I finished there my first year high\nschool, and then I asked to be moved to kibbutz. I went to Kibbutz Yavne, that\u2019s a\nreligious school, high school, my second year high school in Israel, and I wasn\u2019t\nhappy there. I didn\u2019t like the place. So \u2014 kibbutz life, whatever it was. So I took a\ntest and I got into a school, for lab technician school. That\u2019s a high school\ncombination with a profession with a lab. So we had four year \u2014 four hours a day,\nfive days a week laboratory, and the rest is a\u2014 mainly was concentrate on\nchemistry. That\u2019s how I started my [indecipherable] learning chemistry. Well, it\nstarted in high school. I was very good in math and sciences. And that\u2019s due to my\nfoster family, maybe, they taught me the \u2014 when my foster mother was sitting with\nme every day to teach me, when I was living in their house, and that\u2019s how I got\ngood in all these areas. I now focus a lot on school now, no more \u2014 I didn\u2019t have\nnothing else to focus on, so it was school. I was a very good student, and I lived one\nNovember 8, 2008\nyear in \u2014 in the Kibbutz Yavne. And then I went to Ramat Gan, to another family,\na family that was also Holocaust survivor from Hungary, I forgot the names. And\nthey had the number on their hand. She was one of that that made experiment on\nher, that doctor \u2014",

        "A: Mengele, he made experiment on her so she could never have children. Now,\nher sister had five children, and when her sister had the sixth one, and she bought\nsome \u2014 a nice outfit for the baby, she used to tell me, this, I don\u2019t want to leave it to\nmy sis. I really want \u2014 I\u2019m thinking maybe I could have another chi \u2014 maybe I could\nhave a child one day. I would like to have it for my child. But, that\u2019s how the\nreality. I felt sorry for her. But anyhow, I lived in the house, and I went to the lab\ntechnician school in Ramat Gan every day. And when I finished school, two years\nwas, I got a job in \u2014 in Israel, in the Weizmann Institute. I work there two years in\nIsrael, and after two years \u2014 after two years in Rehovot, Weizmann Institute in\nRehovot, after two years I decided I wanted to come to United States to meet my\nfamily. I never met my family. Meanwhile, my uncle from \u2014 from Italy immigrated\nto United States, and he lived in \u2014 in Detroit, Michigan. So I came to United\nStates, and they send me the visa, my uncle in Brooklyn, a brother of my mother,\nand Isaac Mikowski(ph), and we met in Ellis Isl \u2014 Ellie Island. And I tell you, I do\nNovember 8, 2008\nnot know \u2014 they did not know how I look, I did not know how they look, but\nsomehow we met. I did tell them what I\u2019m going to wear, so they\u2019Il look for a gi\u2014a\ngirl tha-that wearing so and so clothes, and tha \u2014 this, and special for them I would\ndress up in clothes so they can recognize it, not clothes li-like other people,\notherwise they will never know who I am \u2014 where I am, right? So we met, and th-\nthey \u2014 I went to their house. I stay in the house for two months, and we didn't get\nalong, they were too religious, Hassidic. And I \u2014 they found out that I\u2019m not\nreligious [indecipherable]. So they didn\u2019t want to see me, and \u2014 and they wanted\nme to move out of the house, and to \u2014 they will rent for me a room in a family, and\nPll leave them, and they\u2019ll pay for it. And at that time I was already 20 year old. I\ndidn\u2019t want it, so they decided to send me to Michigan, to my uncle who was\nmarried to Italian woman, not Jewish, but she converted, she became Jewish, and it\n\u2014 they\u2019re not religious, so 1t would be good for me. So I went to Detroit, Michigan,\nand I went to a\u2014I went to a midrasha to become Hebrew teacher while I was there\nin the house. But I didn\u2019t get along again with my uncle, Max Pajewski(ph), so I\nstayed very short time with them, and then I contact with the Jewish agency, and\nthey found me a woman that wants somebody to have companionship at night only,\nfor a free room and board. I say, I'll take that deal. No pay, free room and board. So\nI live with that woman and I went to the midrasha to become Hebrew teacher. On\nNovember 8, 2008\nthe side I did a little Hebrew teaching, I was not allowed to work, but I did on the\nside, teaching Hebrew. And so, it give me some money. All right. And then,\nmeanwhile, I \u2014 I went at the same time, I took a test for college, and I went to\nWayne State University to become a chemist. So here a Hebrew teacher and here\u2019s\na chemist.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And meanwhile, I \u2014 I met my husband, was Paul Cohen, and I met him, and we\ngot married a-at the same day when John F. Kennedy was shot. Civil marriage, not\nJewish marriage. And at the same time, the same time, 10 o\u2019clock, the same time\nwhen he got shot. So when we got married I went to the car, and suddenly I\u2019m\nlistening to the news, and I say, oh my God, John F. Kennedy was killed. The\nsame date, the same time, everything. So that\u2019s was a disaster. All right, my\nmarriage also, my marriage lasted 10 years, and then after 10 \u2014 and then I took a\njob, I worked as a \u2014 as a lab technician in a hospital \u2014 in a private lab, and then in a\nhospital in \u2014 in Detroit, Michigan. And then \u2014 but the marriage wasn\u2019t working,\nmy husband was abusive husband, and I had to leave him quick, because he didn't\ntreat me right. So I \u2014I left him, and moved to New York. From New York to new j\n\u2014 New Jersey, I got a job in New Jersey in a hospital as a medical \u2014 as a leptic \u2014\nno, oh, in Michigan I \u2014 I went to internship for medical technology, and I became a\nNovember 8, 2008\nmedical technologist also. And when I move out of Michigan, I got a job in New\nJersey as a medical technologist in one of the hospitals. So I was very happy.\nMeanwhile I used to come to New York, and I met my o \u2014 my other husband,\nRalph Fol, I me \u2014 I met him, and so I went to Dominican Republic to get my\ndivorce, and I divorce my ex-hu \u2014 my ex \u2014 which \u2014 Mr. Cohen \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014I divorced him, and I married my husband, Ralph Fol.",
        "Q: During all these years, had you been in contact with Miss Westerly, or ha \u2014 did\nyou hear anything from her?",
        "A: No, I never knew yet nothing. Remember, at that time, Soviet Union was a\ncommunist country and you couldn\u2019t get in touch. I-I knew this story, that there was\na Christian woman who saved my life during the war. My uncle wrote me a letter. I\ngot this information from my uncle, Isaac Makowski(ph) that there was a woman\nthat saved my life, but they didn't know who \u2014 what\u2019s her name was. And so my\nuncle, Max Pajewski(ph) told me the same story. And what\u2019s happen, in 1999, this\nlearning organization from Israel, they came to \u2014 meanwhile \u2014 meanwhile what\u2019s\nhappened, the Soviet Union was dissolve, I forgot what year \u2014which year, 1990-\nwhat \u2014 \u201999? Something in the 90s, the Soviet Union dissolve. So different\ncountries, Poland, then become Belarussia, so my city Slonim became part of\nNovember 8, 2008\nBelarus now. And so I am \u2014 my uncle went to Belarussia, my uncle Max\nPajewski(ph), he went to Belarus, and to the s \u2014 to s \u2014 to Slonim, with the Slonim\norganization from Israel, and \u2014 to put monument for the dead people who died\nduring the Holocaust. And there is coming a woman by the name Helena Westerly\nlooking for Mr. Pajewski(ph). And she found him, and she ge \u2014 to \u2014 ask him \u2014 she\ntold him who she 1s, and she ask him about Sonja Pajewski(ph). And he told her\nthat \u2014 where I am, that I live in United States, he \u2014 they talked. And he say, please\nask her to write me a letter. She gave her address. So he, when he came back to\nUnited States, he send me a letter and he told me she asked to write her. So I start\nto correspond with her, and in 1999, I\u2014I wrote her a letter, I\u2019m coming to unite \u2014 to\nBelarus to meet you. So, we \u2014 there\u2019s a person by the name Jakob \u2014 he\u2019s living in\nUnited States, Russian, that he is \u2014 he \u2014 he claimed that he 1s a president of the\nBelarusian jewelry \u2014 Jewry. The Jew \u2014 all right. So he helped a lot of things to do\nwith the cemetery of \u2014 of the Jewish cemetery, so they don\u2019t desecrate the Jewish\ncemeteries and other thing. So I got in touch with him, he lives in Brooklyn. I got\nin touch with him, and we arranged for me to go there. I went to Belarus, I said,\nwhen you go to Belarus, I meet him \u2014 now you \u2014 I meet him in Belarus, and which\nI did, and he arranged for me to be on TV in Belarus, which I did, and my name \u2014\nit was [indecipherable] in the newspaper there too, the story of me coming back to\nNovember 8, 2008\nBelarus to meet Helena Westerly, that she saved my life during the war, etcetera.\nAnd so we had \u2014 we been corresponding ever since, and is a \u2014 I remember that\nwoman when I was young, the same face, she was a very fat woman. Now she was\nvery fat. And she seemed to be that her face, the \u2014 the features similar to what she\nwas at the time, because of the fat that she had in her face now. And they \u2014 I ni \u2014 all\nthese years, I had somebody in my neighborhood look like that face, and I used to\nlook at her. Every time she pass by, I would sen \u2014 and stop and just stare at that\nwoman. And then I start to understand why I did. I knew somebody by that \u2014 by \u2014\nthat looked like her. And Helena Westerly, and we became good friends. I look at\nher like somebody important to me, that was important because she did visit at me,\nnot every day, was too dangerous during the war, while it was in a children home\nthere, in Slonim. But, very occasionally. It was too dangerous to come, otherwise,\nthey will be suspicious that she knows me.",
        "Q: When you \u2014 when you m-met Miss Westerly, could she provide you with one\nmore detail \u2014",
        "A: Oh, she did.",
        "Q: \u2014 of your background story, your mother, your background, where you said, this\nis wonderful \u2014",
        "A: She did.\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "Q: \u2014 that I could learn this \u2014",
        "A: She did.",
        "Q: \u2014 after all. After all these years.",
        "A: She did tell me about \u2014 I spoke some German, I knew German from the foster\nfamily because they spoke German. And \u2014 but my German was not that good. But I\nlearn Russian by myself, before I went to Belarus, because I know eastern Europe,\nthey\u2019re all speaking Russian, so what I need to learn Polish? Polish I forgot already,\nwhen I lived in Israel. And when I went to Belarus, I found out that everybody\nthere speak Russian. So I was very pleased that I learned Russian. I was able to read\nand write Russian, but not much, because just \u2014 I learn a little bit for myself to get\nalong, just to be able to move around, so I could [indecipherable] different thing,\nbut not a lot. So with the Russian and the German, we were able to communicate.\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s a \u2014 was a \u2014 a woman there, a \u2014 a \u2014 a daughter of her friend, that\nshe major in English in Belarus, and she became interpreter.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: So, that cost me plenty of money to do interpreter, believe me, they all want\nmoney. They all take opportunity to do that. But that\u2019s okay, it didn\u2019t matter to me.\nI was very happy, so she to \u2014 I had also a lot of thing translated \u2014 I mean, a lot of\nthing on the tape in Polish, on the tape I have that \u2014 that she spoke. Now, she died\nNovember 8, 2008\nMarch 2008, unfortunately, and she never met my daughter. I wanted to bring my\ndaughter there, and she died, it\u2019s too late. But \u2014",
        "Q: Did she tell you something \u2014 was there \u2014 do you remember some things she told\nyou, where you said, oh, thank you s \u2014",
        "A: She explained me certain things, yes \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 she did. When I told her that the \u2014 the kids were shot and not me, and she\nexplaining what\u2019s happen. The kids were Jewish who were circumcised, that\u2019s how\nthey know that they\u2019re Jewish. I was a girl [indecipherable]. She did say I did have\n\u2014 I was [indecipherable] headache a lot, because I did have malnutrition. I suffered\nfrom very severe malnutrition, she say. I look so bad, so when my uncle came to\npick me up, he \u2014 she say he \u2014 it was like seeing a ghost, that\u2019s how bad I looked.\nBut basically \u2014 and when I was a \u2014 a \u2014 now, what I\u2019m doing now, I\u2019m semi-retired\nfrom my full time job, and I teach in college part time chemistry, and I have a\ndaughter who is now 29 year old, from Mr. Fol, not from Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen\ndid \u2014 never had children. Basically, that\u2019s what it is. And I came to the conference\nhere to meet \u2014 maybe to meet some people, to see what is the conference. But I\u2019m\nstill working, teaching 1n college part time. And I just lost my husband, Mr. Fol a\nyear ago.

In 1917, his father,\nIke Fol, his name was Folchuk(ph), he escaped from Russian revolution in 1917,\nhe came to United States, and he was unable to get a job as I \u2014 Ike Folchuk. So he\ncut \u2014 he split his name to Fol, and that\u2019s where the name become Fol, f-o-l.",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "A: Now you know. Because nobody wanted to hire somebody who come from\nRussia [indecipherable] and they call him Russian communist, with the name\nFolchuk(ph). So that\u2019s why he did.",
        "Q: That\u2019s interesting. I had one more question about \u2014 I\u2019m just thinking about your\nbeing on the ship and going to Palestine \u2014",

And they went with me to\nPalestine, and then, after the British arrested us and all that, I never saw them\nagain. So I do not know who was that family, where they went to and who they\nwere, and I would be happy to find out.

We had a lot of feud in the family because what\u2019s happened, taking me from\nGoldschmidt. So it became a feud in the family because of that. So one side don\u2019t\nlike another side because of that. So \u2014 and I\u2019m in between, so I\u2019m \u2014 neither one\ngood friend with me, and this is how the family ended.

        "Q: Yeah, I can imagine.",
        "A: For many years, if you showed me fish, I would run away from it. Because fish\nis one thing, I hated that. And just the word fish 1s \u2014 was enough to hate, be-because\no-of all this. But anyhow, one thing I remember on that boat was, there was a \u2014 like\na \u2014 a big place with water, and they used to go and threw in the \u2014 with a net, some\npeople to the water. And I didn\u2019t understand what ed \u2014 why, and what does it mean?\nSo some people \u2014 now people tell me could be people who came from a\nconcentration camp were afraid to take shower because a \u2014 a \u2014 they were taking\nshower in the gas, and they got killed in concentration camp. So people were afraid\nto take shower because they were thinking that\u2019s what happen again. So maybe they\nthrew them to \u2014 they forced them to wash themself, to throw them to the water. So,\nI do not know, I\u2019m just telling you what I saw. But life on the boat, I had one good\nfriend on the boat, Natala(ph). She came with me to Israel. She was in\n[indecipherable] also, Natala(ph), and that\u2019s all that I know of. But she was a little\nNovember 8, 2008\nbit older than me. And that\u2019s how it is, but I went back to Slonim, and I went also to\nPoland. I went into the archives of the Jewish History Museum, and they got my\npictures in the archive, and on the picture is say, Sonja Pajewski(ph), in Yiddish.\nSo I\u2019m happy, I ha \u2014 that\u2019s the first time I have pictures from \u2014 that I\u2019m a \u2014 little.",

        "Q: To the \u2018nothers, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. But one thing I\u2019m lucky I had the family, because when I arrived to pa \u2014\nto my foster family, how tough they were beginning, and I was very fortunate,\nbecause they \u2014 yeah, I was afraid beginning, because the Palestinians would come\nto \u2014 to the village. We lived in Kfar Yedidya next to Netanya. And they would\ncome at night, the Palestinians, to the village and steal cows, and do all time\nsabotage in a lot of thing. So I would be so afraid. They would send me at \u2014 in the\nevening, purposely in the evening, to bring newspaper from the neighbor, because\nat that time people didn\u2019t have money, and they share a newspaper bet-between\nthree, four different families. So one family read the German newspaper \u2014 the \u2014 the\nnewspaper was in German. So, the all \u2014 the \u2014 the village were all come from\nGermany. They all either Austria or Germany, but they all were German origin\nNovember 8, 2008\nand they all spoke German. And I didn't speak German. I felt very bad that I\ncouldn\u2019t catch the language. And they tried to teach me and I couldn\u2019t catch the\nlanguage. I couldn\u2019t learn one set from the a \u2014 Polish language became th \u2014 and I\nknow only [indecipherable]. Language became very difficult for me to learn. And\nthis was my problem, language. And they \u2014 they would send me to the library, th \u2014\nthe family had the books in German, and they will say, you have to bring a book,\nand they would teach me how to say it in German. And by the time I get there, and I\nsaid book. And I had difficulty say th-the rest of it. So they knew that I have to\nbring a book for them, and that\u2019s how it was. But I got used to all this, but when I\ncame to Israel, they have the \u2014 I remember I was with my friends, the neighbors\nwere my friends, and they were the same age I was, and they \u2014 the plan was, that\ntime, I think, after the war of \u201948, or whatever, I do not know, the plans was there\nfrom the [indecipherable] that everybody tells me, you got to go down on the\nground. So, I was still, at that time, so I went on the ground, until the plane go. So,\nall kind of things that. And then we see that the British, and the British left. Some\nplaces we found a lot of bullets, ammunition that the British left 1-in the \u2014 in our\nareas. So we were the kids that played with those things, and one of the kids got\nwounded from that. So this kind of thing \u2014",

        "A: All right. In L\u00e9dz, I was staying sometimes there, and \u2014 until maybe \u201948, and\nthen we \u2014 we traveled from one place to another place. In the middle of the night\nthe \u2014 they brought big truck, military truck came up \u2014 came in, pulled me out of the\nbed, put hand on my mouth and said, don\u2019t talk, be quiet. And they took me and put\nme in that truck, and they told me we going to Palestine. But meanwhile, I don\u2019t \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t remember if they took other kids or not with them. It \u2014 I\u2019m not really\nremember very well. But they took me and they \u2014 we went to different places, I do\nnot know where, what. From one place to another place, again traveled through\nNovember 8, 2008\nEurope again, illegally, just like I did with my mother when my mother escaped\nfrom the ghetto and went and traveled, and somehow went back to the city, I think\nto her husband. That\u2019s why she returned back, because she couldn\u2019t \u2014 nobody help\nher there and she couldn\u2019t do nothing. So she had to return back. But she \u2014 I was in\nBelgium before, and France and other countries, and somehow we return back to\nPoland. I mean, that\u2019s when my mother was still alive. This time I was moving\nfrom one country to another country. And the paper, according to the paper, they\nput me on the ship Sylvania(ph), and they \u2014 we \u2014 to Palestine. In the boat, I had a\nfriend, the name Natala(ph), and she is in Israel today. And she was in my children\nhome too, because I visited Israel in 2004, and we see that we [indecipherable]\ntogether, Natala(ph) and me. And on the boat, I do not know \u2014 the British caught us\non the boat when we were close to Palestine \u2014 everybody was so happy \u2014 the\nBritish caught us and arrested us and put us 1n a prison. So, I think I was about six\nyear old at that time, I became a prisoner of United Kingdom. And I don\u2019t know\nhow long we were, but in a prison for long time. I was freezing, was not much \u2014 I\nremember they put fences there, and we were sleeping in a tent in Israel because\nthere was not enough space, and \u2014 and it was very cold and freezing, and not\nenough food over there to \u2014 and, by the way, on the boat to \u2014 to Israel was not\nenough food to eat also, and every day we ate only fish. And I hated fish so much\nNovember 8, 2008\nbecause all \u2014 every meal was only fish, too, there was no other food to eat, any\nmore left. And that was very tough, and that boat was also \u2014 people were, I think,\nTurkish, Arabs, Turkish were on that boat, too. And they wear the red hat that\nTurkish wear, and I think they were Turkish, and I used to be afraid of them so\nmuch. And somebody was saying on the boat that they stealing the kids, too. So I\nalways frightened from them. Anyway, on the way back in \u2014 back to \u2014 I mean\nPalestine, and then Israel was declared as a state, I was taken out of the prison and\nlater on they send me to a foster family in Israel. And the name of the family,\nGoldschmidt [indecipherable] DDR [indecipherable] near Netanya. And I had\nfoster family, and that was \u2014 life was not easy beginning because I had \u2014 I had to\nget used to new \u2014 to a family life, which I never had family before. And a home I\nhad never had before. And they were very tough, they were Germans from\nGermany. And \u2014 Jewish Germans, and they were very, very tough disciplinary\npeople, and they discipline me with the \u2014 a lot of hitting. I got again a lot of hitting.\nAnd I did, again, pee-pee in the bed. And they hit me for that also. And so the wa \u2014\nlife wasn\u2019t easy. But then first grade I didn\u2019t do good because in the school, first\ngrade, I used all the time to dream about the fox who eated the kids, except me not.\nSo I couldn\u2019t concentrate in the class, and I was \u2014 I didn\u2019t do good in school. So\nthey decided I\u2019m going to be left over, and take the class first grade again. So the\nNovember 8, 2008\nfoster family said no, she cannot. I\u2019m going to sit with her during the summer, and\ndon\u2019t leave her, because she has friends there now, and she used to them. And this\nwill be a crime for her to \u2014 to move to new fr \u2014 kids, and again the same class. So\nmy foster mother sat with me every day, teach me math and teach me to read and\nwrite, and believe me on that, by the end of the summer I took a test for the first\ngrade, I passed it. Second grade I became the best student in the class.",
        "A: Yeah. And from then on I became very, very good student, and I focus on school\nvery much. When I became a \u2014 when I became a \u2014 a 10 year old \u2014 so far they knew\nmy name was Esther Pajewski(ph), but they \u2014 they did not know anything about\nmy family, and they thought everybody died during the war, for me. And I took\ntheir name, their name was Goldschmidt. The father name was Elie Goldschmidt,\nand the mother name was Shoshanna Goldschmidt. Both were from Berlin,\nGermany. They immigrated to Israel in 1939, but they lost all their family in\nGermany. In 1939 they still were able to immigrate to Israel, and that\u2019s why they\nsurvived, this family. And in Israel they worked in agriculture. The \u2014 and they had\na house there, and it was a nice village, I \u2014 the life \u2014 and they were very, very\ndisciplinary people. Everything had to be just right. Everything on time exactly, and\nI got used to all this. If I came five minutes late, was almost like a crime, how you\nNovember 8, 2008\ndid such a thing? You have to be exactly by 12 o\u2019clock for lunch [indecipherable]\nexactly. Well, I got used to all this, and that was very nice. But then I had\nsomething happen at the age 10. I got sick, and they took me to the hospital to take\nx-rays, something happen. And the doctor over there say, you know what? There\u2019s a\ndoctor by the name Dr. Pajewski(ph). Maybe he\u2019II relate to this, because my last\nname Pajewski(ph) was. And they say, well, the do \u2014 the doctor in that hospital in\nNetanya say, you know what? We\u2019|l come talk to him, and see if he related to her.\nA \u2014 after \u2014 within short time, Dr. Pajewski(ph) come with a Jeep to the village, and\nthey \u2014 he wanted to see Sonja Pajewski(ph), which is me. And he came and found\nout that we are family members. And then he contacted my uncle in Italy, the\nbrother of my father was station \u2014 was in Italy at the time. And I think it was 1950.\nAnd \u2014 1950, and then I got a letter from Italy \u2014 they got a letter from Italy, and that\nwas written in Italian. And, that he, my uncle, and he\u2019s happy that I\u2019m alive, and all\nthat. And then sunny \u2014 one day came somebody from United States, a man, that he\nsay he my uncle \u2014 he \u2014 I have an uncle here, and he is \u2014 his name 1s Isaac\nMakowski(ph), a brother of my mother, and he want to meet me. And he came to\nsee how I am, and to meet me finally. Not my uncle, but he send somebody else to\nmeet me there. And tha \u2014 to \u2014 to see I\u2019m alive, he found out that I\u2019m alive. That\u2019s\nhappen after the accident with the \u2014 that \u2014 th-the Dr. Pajewski(ph). So, they\nNovember 8, 2008\ndiscover I have family members. Now became another problem. My uncle in \u2014\nIsaac Makowski(ph), who lives in \u2014 who at that time lived in Brooklyn, New\nYork, in United States, he was not happy with the family that I was living, because\nthey were not religious Jewish. They were nice people, Jewish, but they were not\nOrthodox like he was. He was Hassidic Orthodox Jew. So he contacted\n[indecipherable] my uncle, my other uncle, and \u2014 and he ask him to sign that my\nparents were Orthodox, and they wanted me to be Orthodox. So my case became in\na court, in Israeli court, and it took long time in Israeli court, and finally the Israeli\ncourt decided that I have to be removed for religious reason from \u2014 from\nGoldschmidt, from my foster family. So, after living in the house four and a half\nyears, I was ordered by the court to remove, if not the ca \u2014 the fa-family would be\narrested. So the family had to give me up, and they put me in a \u2014 in a Orthodox\nboarding school in Israel, and that was in a \u2014 and I\u2019m thinking a la \u2014 not Ramat\nGan, that\u2019s was in Benai Brak, very religious place, and they send me to a\nreligious school there, public school, a religious public school there, and to learn the\nreligion. Well, my uncle aimed to bring me to United States, that was in 1953. And\nI refused to come to United States at the time because I hated him for doing what\nhe did. So that came another family, and they told me that my uncle died, and they\nwanted to bring me to their house, to give me a home. I do not know who they\nNovember 8, 2008\nwere. And that family had twins. Babies, two ba \u2014 twins, and I do not know. I found\nout later on that \u2014 that my uncle just send me a letter, that couldn't be that he died.\nSo, it didn\u2019t work out. But then [indecipherable] so it didn\u2019t work out that way.\nAnd then I moved to Ramat Gan, that\u2019s another religious boarding school\nRa\u2019anana. Ra\u2019anana in Ra\u2019anana \u2014 Ra\u2019anana, I\u2019m sorry, in Kfar Batya,\nRa\u2019anana. That\u2019s a boarding school that I lived there, a elementary school, I was\nthere a few years until 19 \u2014 until my first year \u2014 I finished there my first year high\nschool, and then I asked to be moved to kibbutz. I went to Kibbutz Yavne, that\u2019s a\nreligious school, high school, my second year high school in Israel, and I wasn\u2019t\nhappy there. I didn\u2019t like the place. So \u2014 kibbutz life, whatever it was. So I took a\ntest and I got into a school, for lab technician school. That\u2019s a high school\ncombination with a profession with a lab. So we had four year \u2014 four hours a day,\nfive days a week laboratory, and the rest is a\u2014 mainly was concentrate on\nchemistry. That\u2019s how I started my [indecipherable] learning chemistry. Well, it\nstarted in high school. I was very good in math and sciences. And that\u2019s due to my\nfoster family, maybe, they taught me the \u2014 when my foster mother was sitting with\nme every day to teach me, when I was living in their house, and that\u2019s how I got\ngood in all these areas. I now focus a lot on school now, no more \u2014 I didn\u2019t have\nnothing else to focus on, so it was school. I was a very good student, and I lived one\nNovember 8, 2008\nyear in \u2014 in the Kibbutz Yavne. And then I went to Ramat Gan, to another family,\na family that was also Holocaust survivor from Hungary, I forgot the names. And\nthey had the number on their hand. She was one of that that made experiment on\nher, that doctor \u2014",
        "A: Mengele, he made experiment on her so she could never have children. Now,\nher sister had five children, and when her sister had the sixth one, and she bought\nsome \u2014 a nice outfit for the baby, she used to tell me, this, I don\u2019t want to leave it to\nmy sis. I really want \u2014 I\u2019m thinking maybe I could have another chi \u2014 maybe I could\nhave a child one day. I would like to have it for my child. But, that\u2019s how the\nreality. I felt sorry for her. But anyhow, I lived in the house, and I went to the lab\ntechnician school in Ramat Gan every day. And when I finished school, two years\nwas, I got a job in \u2014 in Israel, in the Weizmann Institute. I work there two years in\nIsrael, and after two years \u2014 after two years in Rehovot, Weizmann Institute in\nRehovot, after two years I decided I wanted to come to United States to meet my\nfamily. I never met my family. Meanwhile, my uncle from \u2014 from Italy immigrated\nto United States, and he lived in \u2014 in Detroit, Michigan. So I came to United\nStates, and they send me the visa, my uncle in Brooklyn, a brother of my mother,\nand Isaac Mikowski(ph), and we met in Ellis Isl \u2014 Ellie Island. And I tell you, I do\nNovember 8, 2008\nnot know \u2014 they did not know how I look, I did not know how they look, but\nsomehow we met. I did tell them what I\u2019m going to wear, so they\u2019Il look for a gi\u2014a\ngirl tha-that wearing so and so clothes, and tha \u2014 this, and special for them I would\ndress up in clothes so they can recognize it, not clothes li-like other people,\notherwise they will never know who I am \u2014 where I am, right? So we met, and th-\nthey \u2014 I went to their house. I stay in the house for two months, and we didn't get\nalong, they were too religious, Hassidic. And I \u2014 they found out that I\u2019m not\nreligious [indecipherable]. So they didn\u2019t want to see me, and \u2014 and they wanted\nme to move out of the house, and to \u2014 they will rent for me a room in a family, and\nPll leave them, and they\u2019ll pay for it. And at that time I was already 20 year old. I\ndidn\u2019t want it, so they decided to send me to Michigan, to my uncle who was\nmarried to Italian woman, not Jewish, but she converted, she became Jewish, and it\n\u2014 they\u2019re not religious, so 1t would be good for me. So I went to Detroit, Michigan,\nand I went to a\u2014I went to a midrasha to become Hebrew teacher while I was there\nin the house. But I didn\u2019t get along again with my uncle, Max Pajewski(ph), so I\nstayed very short time with them, and then I contact with the Jewish agency, and\nthey found me a woman that wants somebody to have companionship at night only,\nfor a free room and board. I say, I'll take that deal. No pay, free room and board. So\nI live with that woman and I went to the midrasha to become Hebrew teacher. On\nNovember 8, 2008\nthe side I did a little Hebrew teaching, I was not allowed to work, but I did on the\nside, teaching Hebrew. And so, it give me some money. All right. And then,\nmeanwhile, I \u2014 I went at the same time, I took a test for college, and I went to\nWayne State University to become a chemist. So here a Hebrew teacher and here\u2019s\na chemist.",
        "A: And meanwhile, I \u2014 I met my husband, was Paul Cohen, and I met him, and we\ngot married a-at the same day when John F. Kennedy was shot. Civil marriage, not\nJewish marriage. And at the same time, the same time, 10 o\u2019clock, the same time\nwhen he got shot. So when we got married I went to the car, and suddenly I\u2019m\nlistening to the news, and I say, oh my God, John F. Kennedy was killed. The\nsame date, the same time, everything. So that\u2019s was a disaster. All right, my\nmarriage also, my marriage lasted 10 years, and then after 10 \u2014 and then I took a\njob, I worked as a \u2014 as a lab technician in a hospital \u2014 in a private lab, and then in a\nhospital in \u2014 in Detroit, Michigan. And then \u2014 but the marriage wasn\u2019t working,\nmy husband was abusive husband, and I had to leave him quick, because he didn't\ntreat me right. So I \u2014I left him, and moved to New York. From New York to new j\n\u2014 New Jersey, I got a job in New Jersey in a hospital as a medical \u2014 as a leptic \u2014\nno, oh, in Michigan I \u2014 I went to internship for medical technology, and I became a\nNovember 8, 2008\nmedical technologist also. And when I move out of Michigan, I got a job in New\nJersey as a medical technologist in one of the hospitals. So I was very happy.\nMeanwhile I used to come to New York, and I met my o \u2014 my other husband,\nRalph Fol, I me \u2014 I met him, and so I went to Dominican Republic to get my\ndivorce, and I divorce my ex-hu \u2014 my ex \u2014 which \u2014 Mr. Cohen \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I divorced him, and I married my husband, Ralph Fol.",
        "A: No, I never knew yet nothing. Remember, at that time, Soviet Union was a\ncommunist country and you couldn\u2019t get in touch. I-I knew this story, that there was\na Christian woman who saved my life during the war. My uncle wrote me a letter. I\ngot this information from my uncle, Isaac Makowski(ph) that there was a woman\nthat saved my life, but they didn't know who \u2014 what\u2019s her name was. And so my\nuncle, Max Pajewski(ph) told me the same story. And what\u2019s happen, in 1999, this\nlearning organization from Israel, they came to \u2014 meanwhile \u2014 meanwhile what\u2019s\nhappened, the Soviet Union was dissolve, I forgot what year \u2014which year, 1990-\nwhat \u2014 \u201999? Something in the 90s, the Soviet Union dissolve. So different\ncountries, Poland, then become Belarussia, so my city Slonim became part of\nNovember 8, 2008\nBelarus now. And so I am \u2014 my uncle went to Belarussia, my uncle Max\nPajewski(ph), he went to Belarus, and to the s \u2014 to s \u2014 to Slonim, with the Slonim\norganization from Israel, and \u2014 to put monument for the dead people who died\nduring the Holocaust. And there is coming a woman by the name Helena Westerly\nlooking for Mr. Pajewski(ph). And she found him, and she ge \u2014 to \u2014 ask him \u2014 she\ntold him who she 1s, and she ask him about Sonja Pajewski(ph). And he told her\nthat \u2014 where I am, that I live in United States, he \u2014 they talked. And he say, please\nask her to write me a letter. She gave her address. So he, when he came back to\nUnited States, he send me a letter and he told me she asked to write her. So I start\nto correspond with her, and in 1999, I\u2014I wrote her a letter, I\u2019m coming to unite \u2014 to\nBelarus to meet you. So, we \u2014 there\u2019s a person by the name Jakob \u2014 he\u2019s living in\nUnited States, Russian, that he is \u2014 he \u2014 he claimed that he 1s a president of the\nBelarusian jewelry \u2014 Jewry. The Jew \u2014 all right. So he helped a lot of things to do\nwith the cemetery of \u2014 of the Jewish cemetery, so they don\u2019t desecrate the Jewish\ncemeteries and other thing. So I got in touch with him, he lives in Brooklyn. I got\nin touch with him, and we arranged for me to go there. I went to Belarus, I said,\nwhen you go to Belarus, I meet him \u2014 now you \u2014 I meet him in Belarus, and which\nI did, and he arranged for me to be on TV in Belarus, which I did, and my name \u2014\nit was [indecipherable] in the newspaper there too, the story of me coming back to\nNovember 8, 2008\nBelarus to meet Helena Westerly, that she saved my life during the war, etcetera.\nAnd so we had \u2014 we been corresponding ever since, and is a \u2014 I remember that\nwoman when I was young, the same face, she was a very fat woman. Now she was\nvery fat. And she seemed to be that her face, the \u2014 the features similar to what she\nwas at the time, because of the fat that she had in her face now. And they \u2014 I ni \u2014 all\nthese years, I had somebody in my neighborhood look like that face, and I used to\nlook at her. Every time she pass by, I would sen \u2014 and stop and just stare at that\nwoman. And then I start to understand why I did. I knew somebody by that \u2014 by \u2014\nthat looked like her. And Helena Westerly, and we became good friends. I look at\nher like somebody important to me, that was important because she did visit at me,\nnot every day, was too dangerous during the war, while it was in a children home\nthere, in Slonim. But, very occasionally. It was too dangerous to come, otherwise,\nthey will be suspicious that she knows me.",
        "A: Oh, she did.",
        "A: She did.\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: She did.",
        "A: She did tell me about \u2014 I spoke some German, I knew German from the foster\nfamily because they spoke German. And \u2014 but my German was not that good. But I\nlearn Russian by myself, before I went to Belarus, because I know eastern Europe,\nthey\u2019re all speaking Russian, so what I need to learn Polish? Polish I forgot already,\nwhen I lived in Israel. And when I went to Belarus, I found out that everybody\nthere speak Russian. So I was very pleased that I learned Russian. I was able to read\nand write Russian, but not much, because just \u2014 I learn a little bit for myself to get\nalong, just to be able to move around, so I could [indecipherable] different thing,\nbut not a lot. So with the Russian and the German, we were able to communicate.\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s a \u2014 was a \u2014 a woman there, a \u2014 a \u2014 a daughter of her friend, that\nshe major in English in Belarus, and she became interpreter.",
        "A: So, that cost me plenty of money to do interpreter, believe me, they all want\nmoney. They all take opportunity to do that. But that\u2019s okay, it didn\u2019t matter to me.\nI was very happy, so she to \u2014 I had also a lot of thing translated \u2014 I mean, a lot of\nthing on the tape in Polish, on the tape I have that \u2014 that she spoke. Now, she died\nNovember 8, 2008\nMarch 2008, unfortunately, and she never met my daughter. I wanted to bring my\ndaughter there, and she died, it\u2019s too late. But \u2014",
        "A: She explained me certain things, yes \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 she did. When I told her that the \u2014 the kids were shot and not me, and she\nexplaining what\u2019s happen. The kids were Jewish who were circumcised, that\u2019s how\nthey know that they\u2019re Jewish. I was a girl [indecipherable]. She did say I did have\n\u2014 I was [indecipherable] headache a lot, because I did have malnutrition. I suffered\nfrom very severe malnutrition, she say. I look so bad, so when my uncle came to\npick me up, he \u2014 she say he \u2014 it was like seeing a ghost, that\u2019s how bad I looked.\nBut basically \u2014 and when I was a \u2014 a \u2014 now, what I\u2019m doing now, I\u2019m semi-retired\nfrom my full time job, and I teach in college part time chemistry, and I have a\ndaughter who is now 29 year old, from Mr. Fol, not from Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen\ndid \u2014 never had children. Basically, that\u2019s what it is. And I came to the conference\nhere to meet \u2014 maybe to meet some people, to see what is the conference. But I\u2019m\nstill working, teaching 1n college part time. And I just lost my husband, Mr. Fol a\nyear ago. And so right now I\u2019m alone, and I\u2019m \u2014 I lost my best friend, I \u2014 he was\nNovember 8, 2008\nmy best friend really, my husband, Ralph Fol.

In 1917, his father,\nIke Fol, his name was Folchuk(ph), he escaped from Russian revolution in 1917,\nhe came to United States, and he was unable to get a job as I \u2014 Ike Folchuk. So he\ncut \u2014 he split his name to Fol, and that\u2019s where the name become Fol, f-o-l.",
        "A: Now you know. Because nobody wanted to hire somebody who come from\nRussia [indecipherable] and they call him Russian communist, with the name\nFolchuk(ph). So that\u2019s why he did.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: We~-no. My uncle, no \u2014",
        "A: The \u2014 during the what was \u2014 they put me with a family \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 1n the \u2014 on the boat, on the ship.\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: And the family told me this way. We have the same last name, Pajewski(ph).\nBut always remember, you are not our daughter.

So I do not know who was that family, where they went to and who they\nwere, and I would be happy to find out. What Id like to know from all this, I want\nto know who were the passengers on [indecipherable] boat, and tell me\ninformation about these passengers. I would like to know if somebody that knew\nwho I was, and \u2014 and my journey from Lo-Lodz \u2014 L\u00e9dz to Palestine, what year, or\nwhen did I left children home in Lo-L\u00e9dz \u2014 L6\u00e9dz is actually L6dz, L\u00e9dz, Poland,\nand \u2014 and how I traveled to go to Palestine. And I want to know also, I\u2019d like to get\nalso, information about the \u2014 the \u2014 the court order about removing me from\nGoldschmidt, my foster family, and by the way, I\u2019m still in touch with my foster\nfamily. Their parents died, but I\u2019m in touch with their son, Suri(ph) Goldschmidt,\nhe is like my brother, I look at him as my brother, and his sister, Newey(ph)\nGoldschmidt, she died about a month and a half ago. They called me up and they\ntold me she died. And that\u2019s basically what is told, and \u2014\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: I was the only chil-child, yeah.",
        "A: The whole family wiped out.",
        "A: The-They killed the whole family. There\u2019s one Dr. Pajewski(ph). He is a\nrelative, he is not very close family, he is a relative. I don\u2019t bother with the family at\nall. We had a lot of feud in the family because what\u2019s happened, taking me from\nGoldschmidt. So it became a feud in the family because of that. So one side don\u2019t\nlike another side because of that. So \u2014 and I\u2019m in between, so I\u2019m \u2014 neither one\ngood friend with me, and this is how the family ended. And, unfortunately, that\u2019s\nwhat\u2019s happened. And \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know who they were.",
        "A: It was a very big ship, oh yeah.",
        "A: They \u2014I did not know what \u2014 oh \u2014",
        "A: They \u2014 they prepared the food there, and every meal was only fish.",
        "A: And I \u2014 for many years I wouldn\u2019t touch fish.",
        "A: For many years, if you showed me fish, I would run away from it. Because fish\nis one thing, I hated that. And just the word fish 1s \u2014 was enough to hate, be-because\no-of all this. But anyhow, one thing I remember on that boat was, there was a \u2014 like\na \u2014 a big place with water, and they used to go and threw in the \u2014 with a net, some\npeople to the water. And I didn\u2019t understand what ed \u2014 why, and what does it mean?\nSo some people \u2014 now people tell me could be people who came from a\nconcentration camp were afraid to take shower because a \u2014 a \u2014 they were taking\nshower in the gas, and they got killed in concentration camp. So people were afraid\nto take shower because they were thinking that\u2019s what happen again. So maybe they\nthrew them to \u2014 they forced them to wash themself, to throw them to the water. So,\nI do not know, I\u2019m just telling you what I saw. But life on the boat, I had one good\nfriend on the boat, Natala(ph). She came with me to Israel. She was in\n[indecipherable] also, Natala(ph), and that\u2019s all that I know of. But she was a little\nNovember 8, 2008\nbit older than me. And that\u2019s how it is, but I went back to Slonim, and I went also to\nPoland. I went into the archives of the Jewish History Museum, and they got my\npictures in the archive, and on the picture is say, Sonja Pajewski(ph), in Yiddish.\nSo I\u2019m happy, I ha \u2014 that\u2019s the first time I have pictures from \u2014 that I\u2019m a \u2014 little.",
        "A: But I so got used to move from one place to another place.",
        "A: Yeah. But one thing I\u2019m lucky I had the family, because when I arrived to pa \u2014\nto my foster family, how tough they were beginning, and I was very fortunate,\nbecause they \u2014 yeah, I was afraid beginning, because the Palestinians would come\nto \u2014 to the village. We lived in Kfar Yedidya next to Netanya. And they would\ncome at night, the Palestinians, to the village and steal cows, and do all time\nsabotage in a lot of thing. So I would be so afraid. They would send me at \u2014 in the\nevening, purposely in the evening, to bring newspaper from the neighbor, because\nat that time people didn\u2019t have money, and they share a newspaper bet-between\nthree, four different families. So one family read the German newspaper \u2014 the \u2014 the\nnewspaper was in German. So, the all \u2014 the \u2014 the village were all come from\nGermany. They all either Austria or Germany, but they all were German origin\nNovember 8, 2008\nand they all spoke German. And I didn't speak German. I felt very bad that I\ncouldn\u2019t catch the language. And they tried to teach me and I couldn\u2019t catch the\nlanguage. I couldn\u2019t learn one set from the a \u2014 Polish language became th \u2014 and I\nknow only [indecipherable]. Language became very difficult for me to learn. And\nthis was my problem, language. And they \u2014 they would send me to the library, th \u2014\nthe family had the books in German, and they will say, you have to bring a book,\nand they would teach me how to say it in German. And by the time I get there, and I\nsaid book. And I had difficulty say th-the rest of it. So they knew that I have to\nbring a book for them, and that\u2019s how it was. But I got used to all this, but when I\ncame to Israel, they have the \u2014 I remember I was with my friends, the neighbors\nwere my friends, and they were the same age I was, and they \u2014 the plan was, that\ntime, I think, after the war of \u201948, or whatever, I do not know, the plans was there\nfrom the [indecipherable] that everybody tells me, you got to go down on the\nground. So, I was still, at that time, so I went on the ground, until the plane go. So,\nall kind of things that. And then we see that the British, and the British left. Some\nplaces we found a lot of bullets, ammunition that the British left 1-in the \u2014 in our\nareas. So we were the kids that played with those things, and one of the kids got\nwounded from that. So this kind of thing \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "A: Yeah, a \u2014a lot of [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, I\u2014 I only remembered \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 I was \u2014 I was two year olds, two.",
        "A: Yeah, how can \u2014 two or two and a half.",
        "A: I just rem \u2014 from the \u2014",
        "A: When I was in a class, sitting in school, first grade \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 always I was thinking about the fox with the black boots, and the black \u2014 the\nblack fox, as animal, because I was afraid from fox, and the fox were always in the\nwoods there, in the \u2014 in the village Kfar Yedidya. So I would think always, the fox\neating all the kids except me. It came in my head as a fox, not as the Germans. So\nNovember 8, 2008\nwhen \u2014 when I met her the first time, I ask her, tell me, what\u2019s happened to the kids,\nwhy they were killed? I realized that something happened with the kids, that\u2019s why\nit\u2019s come as a fox. And she did tell me yes, the kids were shot. And she explain\nabout they were circumcised, and you were a girl, so you didn't have to worry\nabout.",
        "A: I do not know the only girl, there pa \u2014 there [indecipherable] others.",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 I tell you interesting, in the village Kfar Yedidya, there were a few\n[indecipherable] from Poland, and there were \u2014 there were \u2014 she went th \u2014 a lot of\nfamilies in that village took children from Poland at \u2014 to \u2014 to be foster parents. And\nthey became as a family. In my situation, my family took me out of there because of\nthe religion. But these children stayed with them until they \u2014 all the time with them,\nand all the years. They didn\u2019t \u2014 nobody took them out. But later on, when I came\nback to Israel, 2005, I went to reunion in Kfar Yedidya, near Netanya there, and I\nmet all [indecipherable] of people that I went with them to school, and I went \u2014 it\nwas very nice, the reunion. And they\u2019re all about my age, maybe some a little older.\nAnd then I found out like a na \u2014 one neighbor who was from Poland, he was\nNovember 8, 2008\nadopted by the Polish family, only one Polish family in that village. And that was\none Polish family adopted one from Poland, his name was Chaim. And he \u2014 he\nfound out that he has a family too. He send to the newspaper in United States, and\nhere they responded to him, that he had a good family in United States. And then\nhe found out that he have a family all these years in Netanya also, near the village.\nAnd the \u2014 a person who, uncle who looked just like him. So, he was telling me that\nstory. And then somebody else tell me a story that he went \u2014 he \u2014 when he went to\nthe military, he \u2014 he had met a good \u2014 he met a ba \u2014 ha \u2014 had a good friend over\nthere, somebody about his age, and they became very good friends. Later on they\nfound out they were brothers.",
        "A: Yeah, they did not know, because of the war. So, different people had different\nthings happening. And, very interesting. So, that\u2019s a wonderful, wonderful to hear\nin the village, different thing \u2014 different people found their families. But I \u2014 when I\nlive in Kfar Batya [indecipherable] is a boarding school, a very good ed-education\nwas there, and a wa \u2014 I remembered there were people who did not know who they\nwere. None of them knew who \u2014 I have a few people that I knew, they picked them\nup from the woods, and bring them to 1s \u2014 to Israel, but they never knew who they\nwere. They gave them names and everything. They\u2019re little kids with nobody, just\nNovember 8, 2008\nin a wood by themself. So they take and send them to Israel. They figure that\nchildren of Holocaust survivors also. So, otherwise they would die alone in the\nwoods.",
        "A: So, there are people who do not know who they are. That\u2019s how it happened. So,\nthere are a lot of things happen that in a \u2014 I think a \u2014 I think what you\u2019re doing is a\nwonderful thing, take information. I think that information should be left to the next\ngeneration, so they know that there was a Holocaust, whoever deny the Holocaust,\nthey hate Israel, and the one destruction of Israel. That the hol \u2014 that the Holocaust\n\u2014I believe the Holocaust \u2014 the purpose of the Holocaust was to create the state of\nIsrael, because that\u2019s how the state of Israel was created. That\u2019s what I believe.",
