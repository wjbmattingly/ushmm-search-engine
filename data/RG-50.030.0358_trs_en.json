I loved my\npeople, people loved me. Got married. My husband -- when I met my husband, he was college and\nhe studied law. After three years knowing each other -- more than three years -- we got married.\nMy husband finished law and he was a lawyer in Kovno. I had my little boy, Jay, was born in 1935\n-- in June or July, I cannot remember. And we had a very nice living with the neighbors, Christian\npeople, and most of all, the Jewish people. We had a wonderful life. We have everything. Then, I\nhad [Jay] in 1935. In 1935, my husband finished law, and he practiced law. It\u2019s a whole lot to tell\nyou everything the way it was.",
        "Q: Please try.",
        "A: Then my husband couldn\u2019t practice anymore because they have to go five years in court, you\nknow? They because we were Jewish, he was a Jew. So then my husband,\nsomebody recommend him to get some motorcycles, because he had a motorcycle. When he was a\nstudent, he bought a motorcycle, and instead to have a car, you know, he had the motorcycle. I\nknow only a little about the motorcycles. The name was FN, from Belgium, . He\nstarted out with one motorcycle and then for one, he got five. And then he got ten. And then he got\n20. And he sold. And it was just great, wonderful. He went to Belgium there, and then he got\nanother [Aleo] from London, England. And life was really very good and sweet. No worry about\nfood, no worry about clothes, no worry about anything. You really trade and you made. Well, it\nwasn\u2019t so for long.",
        "Q: Now, before you go further, I just want to learn a little bit more about your family life, even\nbefore you got married -- how you were brought up, what you did...",
        "A: Well, I finished high school -- not the high school, I went as a saleslady in the store, selling some\nmerchandise. And I was modelling, I was weighing 105 pounds, so I was modelling some clothes,\ntoo, in the same store. And I made good money, I really did. And I could sell merchandise. I could\nsell everything that was in the store. I used to put on clothes and show them -- I used to sell the -- I\nwas modelling, too. I didn\u2019t have to do anything they thought might be . I didn\u2019t\nhave to help to support the family because my papa was making money. He had, you know, a shoe\nstore and a repair shop, from shoes. So he was making good money, and he support all the children,\nbut he worked. It was a sweet life. And then we had a home -- two-story house. So the three\napartment my papa used to rent, and then the big one, we had been there, all the children, it was\nenough room. It was enough , close. They had a busy, sweet life.",
        "Q: Was this in Kovno or [Slovodka].",
        "A: [Slovodka]. The name of the house was [Belionus] and [Dejeu]. [Dejeu] would bear\nthe big [Yeshiva], 1f you know what a [Yeshiva] is. And that was about --even at the _, the\n[Yeshiva] was there. And we used to go, you know, shoot this or something, if you know about the\nother days. looked like the [Yeshiva] boys used to dance and sing and so on. And\nthen, my mother, may she rest in peace, she used to give the boys each a bath twice a week. And\nthey [could eat]. So it means breakfast, lunch, and dinner. ANd that\u2019s what my mother used to\ngive. Sometimes, if the help was a [serbet]. So at meals, we were good of the help and\nsome people. I didn\u2019t say that we were millionaires. But they were rich, you know.\nIf they were happy, about the \u2014_. _I remember when the one thing that my papa start building the\nsecond floor, I used to go early in the morning -- and we didn\u2019t have the water, like here, but they\nhave a little place they used to carry out the buckets and get the water from about a block away and\nbring home. But no matter what, they were , no matter what, they were before.\nSometimes was maybe hard days, too. But it was a sweet life. Everybody determined. It was\neverybody together. No fights, no rise, no nothing. And then, I had a grandmother, too, with us.\nThat life will never come back. It\u2019s nght, the time is mine, too, but I never can forget. It\u2019s hard to\ndescribe, even in that language that I know so good, it\u2019s hard -- but I think it\u2019s hard to bring out --\nretelling the fear [of the more], the fear for the same thing. It is -- I just couldn\u2019t describe, but I\ndescribe to you one thing about Friday night -- but it was for the Jewish people -- it\u2019s [Labutte].\nBecause it\u2019s Labutte -- everybody got a little house for their self. And Friday night, no matter, you\nreach a middle place [poor people], that Holy [Bible] gave the people life to lead a whole week.\nEven the people who came to [ask], you know, help. You had plenty poor people, but when it came\nFriday night, the candles was light up in the windows. The cakes they were cooking were smelling\nall over. And no matter even -- you know, when the people didn\u2019t have -- they used to [say, \u201cbeing\nin the house,\u201d Hallit].. You know what the [Hallit] is? That they should have for supper, [Hallit],\nbecause that was the main thing, you know. The life of -- the Jewish life, a little -- no\nmatter how many books you can write, it\u2019s hard to describe how beautiful and how lovely it was.\nIt\u2019s so many things to describe about the life in Lithuania -- the holiness, the [Chabas]. My daddy\nused to go to \u2014\u2014_\u2014s, come back from . Everything was prepared. It is unbelievable to\ndescribe to you the happiness that you used to see daddies coming in. The table was set, the\nwas made, and everybody was sitting around the table and eating and enjoy it, the\n[Chabas]. The [CHabas] gave you so much for the whole week. To grow on. And you were\nbrimming again about another Chabas. So that life, no matter what it is, and again, you [have to\ndescribe it], you don\u2019t have, we don\u2019t see. And we will never see it again. Never again. It\u2019s just for\nmy eye I could see . . . candles\u2019 lights, this mirror, the way they were singing, the windows in the\nsummertime was open. It is a life -- I don\u2019t know. I even, I think you need it. I cannot describe the\nbeauty, what it means Friday night at [Chabas]. Everybody used to go, dressed up, [Chabas after],\nyou know, the \u2014_, and they could walk and talking and ~\u2014_\u2014___ each other, and dressed up with\nthe best clothes what they have. But with [Chabas], you used to have -- and it\u2019s quite another\nfeeling. It\u2019s hard, but it was the beauty. The [ Yeshivas], the schools -- you had schools,\nand everything was gone. Nothing was left over.",
        "Q: Now, was most -- most of your activity was in the Slovodka (ph) side.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you go over to Kovno?",
        "A: Well, in Slovodka (ph), then you see in Kovno. You see, in Kovno, I used to work there. Yet,\neveryday I used to work. And after, when I got married, I stopped working, and I had\nmy little boy, my Jay.",
        "Q: I\u2019m trying to get a sense of -- you\u2019re being very good at explaining to me what it felt like and\nwhat it looked like. What else you did -- were there a lot of cultural activities?",
        "A: I used to help a whole lot, you know, some people (ph). I didn\u2019t do too much culture, but you\nsee, I used to help a whole lot the Jewish poor people. For instance, if a girl, a poor girl, had a boy,\nafter awhile forgot about it. And the girl didn\u2019t have no home, no nothing, and she find a boy and I\nwant to marry them off (ph), see now, what I did, I took another lady with me and I went, took my\nfriends and I told them about the cake (ph), and I said, \u201cI need help. That girl didn\u2019t have anything.\u201d\nBut you have to have a dowry, you have to have that and so on. And one thing I want to tell you --\nthat it happened to me -- two young girls. And that\u2019s what I helped them to get married. And they\ngot married and they were leading a sweet life until, you know, the war came. I used to help a\nwhole lot people who need some money, you know, to borrow the money to help to get, to buy\nSinger\u2019s (ph) machine. They didn\u2019t have -- they have to have special. I used to help them. I used\nto give them. And then they used to pay me back. So each time, then, if they need some money, I\nwas on the book. I used to help them with that. And then, I -- then what had happened, I couldn\u2019t\ndo anything in life, like culture or so on, because like I said, my husband was -- he finished law and\nthen he started up with the motorcycles, and we have to make a living, too. So I was occupied with\nthe children -- I had another child, too. [Pause] So, I was in the business with my husband. And it\nwas really a life beautiful. Then when the war broke out, I lost a little dear (ph). I had a little dear\n(ph) and I lost him. Well, honey, it\u2019s a whole lot just to think that, it\u2019s a whole lot to talk. I don\u2019t\nknow, I\u2019m jumping from one thing to the other, and I\u2019m not going exactly the way it should be. I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a question, okay? Before the war, was there much anti-semitism?",
        "A: Anti-semitism? It started up about three years before the war. But it wasn\u2019t so big. It was, but it\nwasn\u2019t the way the war start.",
        "Q: So as a child, as a girl...",
        "A: You see, the problem, what it was in Lithuania, that the Russians came in. And when the\nRussians came in, you see, then it started up a whole lot worse. A whole lot worse because, you\nsee, the Jewish people -- most of the Prolat (ph) people used to go, \u201cOh, oh.\u201d The Russians, they\ngo, \u201cBring us -- I don\u2019t know -- the breath from the sky.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t like that, 1t wasn\u2019t. I'll give\nyou an example. I have an uncle. He had a farm, a big farm. And he was , and among\nthem was a whole lot farmers, farmers. He always used to help them. When they need\nbecause they\u2019re in trouble, or they just need a horse, or they need -- they used to have a cow,\nbecause the little farmers, they was very poor there. And he used to help them because he was very\nbig, had a very big farm. And the farmers knew my mother very well. Of course, she was raised in\nthat farm, and then when she got married, you know, she came to Slovodka (ph). And when the\nfarmer\u2019s people, somebody used to get sick, they used to come to us, and the mother used to help\nthem, to take them to the hospital. She used to cook for them, you know, some food, and take over\nthere. So, with the farmers, was very, very good. And, as I remember, and then later on, I will\ncome, maybe to that point, the way we survived.",
        "Q: We'll get to that. Now, was there much of a change of lifestyle when the Russians came 1n?",
        "A: Yeah, it changed a whole lot. It changed a whole lot. I tell you something -- my husband can\ntell you more than I can tell you -- it changed everything, the whole life. It took the rich people who\nhad, you know, stores and they took him and send him to Siberia. And that was before the war\nstarted up. So the rich people, some of them, they were lucky. They went to America, they went to\nanother place. But here, I could see everything the way it was. The middle-class, didn\u2019t\nbother, but who was in charge in a place like factory people, or you know, the other people, you\nknow, what they had stores, bakeries and so on -- the people went on the first list. And they took\nhim away and they send him to Siberia. I still couldn\u2019t remember what had happened to the\nLithuanian people. I still couldn\u2019t think how people could change -- murders, chilling. When the\nwar broke out, like I told you, the got here and the jail got here. And what had happened\nwithin that time, my husband, he took me and my son and my little girl, and we were running.\nEverybody start running to the RUssians, . We run and they couldn\u2019t reach, they\ncouldn\u2019t see, because the German came here already (ph). So what we have to do? No food, no\nnothing. We turn back home. They come in home. Some Lithuanian people told us, \u201cDon\u2019t go this\nway, go this way.\u201d It\u2019s terrible. They took the Jewish people to the Ninth Fort (ph). They never\ncame back. The children, parents, all the people. , they took the children. They\nkilled them all up there. Fortunately, we were lucky. We took the left , not the right, and\nbecame a home. And when I saw my father -- he was dark complexion -- he was light, like that. In\none night, they killed 200 people, over 200 people. It was , then\nGatvia (ph). And we came back and they told us what had happened. They then took the\nneighbors. The blood on the walls -- some people wrote in Yiddish, \u201cPlease, name Nicole\u201d -- I\ndon\u2019t know how to say it in English. He wrote with the blood of the singer (ph), with big letters. A\nlittle boy from the family, what they knew, he was under the bed. They didn\u2019t see him. He had\nseen what goes on. So that little boy became a life that had to lay there. I just don\u2019t know. It is so\nmany things. So many things. It\u2019s unbelievable. You wouldn\u2019t believe it, and nobody could\nbelieve that people could be such murderers. But murderers -- I judge the same people, the same\npeople who we knew, they used to come to my house and___.._ They asked to help -- the same\nLithuanian people, they slaughtered them. But from one __, from one all the way to the end,\nthey didn\u2019t let . My papa was lucky. He locked windows, you know? And they got up\non the , and it was very quiet. So fortunately, they didn\u2019t murder them. They thought\nnobody\u2019s home. Well, I want to think. Well, then it happened, and the Germans came in. And they\ntook over, you know. Slovodkians (ph), they took, you know Kovno, all Lithuanian. They put us in\nthe ghetto. Our house was on was on -- from the corner from our house, up to the end. I\n_____ made the ghetto, already, that was in August the 15th, I think. Was locked up. You\ncouldn\u2019t take anything with you. They had to leave everything that you had, except, you know, the\nclothes and something else. And we moved into my parents, in their house. And then my husband\u2019s\nfamily, and his sister -- they all were there in the house where we were living. It wasn\u2019t enough\nhome[s] for so many people, I don\u2019t know, 50,000 it was. So we had two ghettos. One was a little\nghetto, and one was the big ghetto. We were in the big ghetto. My husband\u2019s sister, her name was\nDoris, she was married, had a little boy. And she was in the little ghetto. I\u2019m going -- I forgot to\ntell you something. And getting back the way 1 told you we find out -- you know what they did?\nThey took the rabbis. They got in there, they cut off his head and they parade with the rabbi\u2019s head\nin the street. You see, when I am talking, that cannot concentrate. You see, I have to run from one\nto the other. That was terrible. That was murderous --Yet I never thought that the Lithuanian\npeople would do like that. A dog, a cat, got more privacies that a Jew. Well, I'll make short this. . .",
        "Q: No, don\u2019t make short. If you can remember more incidences of the first two months, what you\nwere doing before you moved to the ghetto, I think that would be very helpful.",
        "A: What we were doing?",
        "Q: What you were doing. Did they start passing laws? Did you have to hide? Was there terror in\nthe streets?",
        "A: Oh, that was in ghetto we have to hide ourselves.",
        "Q: Alright, but in the months, you know, between the Germans coming and the ghetto, there was\nmaybe one month? or a month and a half? What...",
        "A: To getting in the ghetto?",
        "Q: Before you moved to the ghetto. What else happened?",
        "A: Oh, they didn\u2019t do nothing, just tried to get ahead a farmer who used to deliver us milk (ph).\nAnd I prepared him -- I knew already that we have to go, you know, in the ghetto -- that he should\nhelp me to bring some potatoes, flours, maybe, you know, oil, or something else. And that left us\nfor a couple of months to go on with the food. It wasn\u2019t easy because we didn\u2019t have anything to\neat. We couldn\u2019t go out. In , you had to go to work, but even if you go to work, you cannot\nbring in anything. So I have to hide. [ll tell you, when I went to work, I had to slice his bread like\nthat, on my half a loaf. And I was looking which is the best one to go in in the ghetto. So,\nI start looking around here and here. And then he came here to me, the police did, you know? The\nGerman guard. \u201cWhat I have here?\u201d I said, \u201cNothing. Perhaps it got here in your pocket. Oh\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cI got to just slice this bread. You know, you wouldn\u2019t believe it, but please believe me.\u201d He\ntook away from me the bread because I have to help out (ph) Jay. He beat me up like an apple, an\napple (ph). He beat me up, here in the back that for three weeks, I couldn\u2019t sleep on my back. And\nthe next day, I have to go to work. It wasn\u2019t an easy life, but still, I was happy. And I had my\nfamily all together. No matter what he had, even then, they used to tell us, some days it\u2019s a good\nday. You can take being in the ghetto. You know? They used to bring in the food, and then all of a\nsudden, they used to take away from you. And here, it\u2019s no food, hunger. Then I used to go work.\nI used to take some -- I tell you -- I used to go to work, I always, my feeling, Ill go find my little\nboy. By being in ghetto, they burned down the hospital, with the children, with the doctors, with the\nnurse, across from the place where we used to live, and there\u2019s a site. They used to take the children\nfrom the windows, the little babies, and threw them on the ground.",
        "Q: Did you see this?",
        "A: Not mine.",
        "Q: But you saw them -- did you see the hospital burn?",
        "A: Oh yes, it was not -- it was across from my old place. I was there. Not in the hospital. And they\nburned up the children.",
        "Q: Did you hear screaming and...",
        "A: I tell you something, that\u2019s what they said. It\u2019s hard for me because I\u2019m coming back. [Pause] I\ndon\u2019t know where I was.",
        "Q: Well, I think you were trying to tell me about life in the ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What kind of -- you were working?",
        "A: [have to go to work.",
        "Q: What kind of work?",
        "A: What kind of work. Digging trenches until I was up to here. If you didn\u2019t finish, they would beat\nyou up. They used to give you a special amount, so much and so much. You have to do it. That\nwasn\u2019t . It was, I think, more people. You used to have good brigades, and you used to\nhave bad ones. A good brigade means that you would go out and you would shop, you know, to get\na package. The bad ones used to be, like, big, old. And one day, I went to work. And we were\nstanding, we were shoveling, you know, sand and mud. They were building a bridge. And we were\nstanding and we were talking. said, \u201cOh, I wish I would have a before\n.\u2019 T said, \u201cWell, I wish we could have Chabas (ph) to feast.\u201d\u201d You know, we were talking.\nWe didn\u2019t talk about anything else. But just to have something that we used to have before the war.\nAnd by talking like that, the German guard got in, and I was standing with the shovel and I didn\u2019t\nwork because we were talking. He hit me with his rifle over my head. I don\u2019t know how many\nstitches I had. I came bleeded up. And then I went, and they took me right away back to the ghetto.\nANd I came to the and the doctor gave me -- they put in some stitches -- they got out the\nhair and put me some stitches and bandaged up my head and the next day I had to go to work. I\nhave to work every single day. Four o\u2019clock in the morning, and then come back 5:00. Back home.\nMy heart, about my little boy, because we used to say, \u201cThey get in and they get us and take away\nthe children.\u201d So, you know, I\u2019m awful sad. I bet it was. But now, I have something to tell you.\nThey got in in the ghetto -- that was August, I think, the 15th or the 20th, I couldn\u2019t remember. In\nSeptember, we had Rosh Hosanna. A day before that, they took out 20 -- 2,000 people to go to the\n, you know. And there was my father, my husband and my older brother. And between\n4:30 and 5:00 -- do you know what it means? -- \u201cGod\u2019s all over the ghetto.\u201d They got\nin and they said, \u201cGet out.\u201d I said, \u201cWhere?\u201d He said, \u201cDo you see all the people here? Go with the\npeople together. Save us little.\u201d It was a nice -- it wasn\u2019t too cold, but you know, in Europe, the\nweather is a little different. And I said, \u201cWait a moment. Let me take for my boy his clothes, his\nlittle coat.\u201d He said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need. He will have there enough.\u201d I had a feeling something is\nwrong. And I had my grandmother and my mother, my sister, Jay, myself, and we have to go for\n. And __ was gone way, way -- hardly could see my --- and I knew, it is a\nselection. Because it was about 5,000 people in that area where we were -- was over 5,000 people.\nI was working. I couldn\u2019t say anything that they said only one thing. \u201c \u00bb God,\nplease, we are poor. Let them help us (ph).\u201d Then they came, big field for us (ph). And everybody\nhas to go forth, in aline. And we get there, to that place -- our neighbors, I see the doctor, the nurse,\nthere. . [knew them. They was ahead of me. ANd I\u2019d seen that if somebody said, \u201cHe\u2019s\na doctor, he\u2019s a nurse, he\u2019s a bookkeeper, he\u2019s from the higher educated people,\u201d left. I said,\n\u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d It\u2019s come by-and-by, asked my name, what I got here. So, I told him about\n. \u201cMy husband, my father and my brother went to the airport. They are\nautomechanics.\u201d And I said, \u201cWe left over.\u201d And he said, . So I told him, \u201cI am a\ndressmaker.\u201d But I was young, I was strong, I wasn\u2019t in tear. He said, . So, to the right\nside. To the right side, I knew that we are alive. The next morning, my father, shall he rest in peace,\nand my husband and my brother said that they already knew of the airport, but it was going good.\nANd he said, \u201cIF they are not here,\u201d he said my life is not anymore. That moment -- it \u2018s hard to\ndescribe, it\u2019s hard to describe -- There you see all the 50 people they took, I think, out of our 2,000,\nand killed them, all of them. At random, like dogs (ph). That was 1941.",
        "Q: How did you know what happened to these people?",
        "A: How? People used to come and tell us. People used to come and tell us this big, big -- how do\nyou Say it, .",
        "Q: [Inaudible]",
        "A: There are people dying to know, there was a . Let\u2019s see, it was a whole lot made out\nwhen they got to the people -- the people have to do their own. And then, they used to kill them.\nAnd add them for the , while they just said to him, \u201cOver my dead body, you go get, you\nknow, my coat.\u201d So, she got trapped anyhow, no matter what it is. And people used to tell us, and\npeople -- not everybody got killed, but some people were still alive and the earth was just ;\nlike that. And who told us? It was some from Lithuanian people, some neighbors, once in a while\nused to come in and to tell us that they\u2019d taken so-and-so. And that\u2019s called the Ninth Port, where\nall the Germans -- even from Germany -- came in -- the boat from German people there. And they\nwas going there, too, and they killed them, all of them. Honey, it\u2019s -- what can I tell you? It was\nhorrible. It was... I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know reason why -- if that would happen right now, I\nreally wasn\u2019t able to make it. But I was young, strong.",
        "Q: When you, or your husband, went to work, and you went to separate places every day, were you\nworried that you wouldn\u2019t come back together?",
        "A: No, uh-uh. The men used to go separate and I used to go separate.",
        "Q: Did you think, when you left your -- when your husband would go to work, that maybe you\nwouldn\u2019t see him again?",
        "A: Yeah, well. That\u2019s the way. And when I used to come back to the ghetto, I didn\u2019t know, and I'd\ngo see my little bby ~~~. ~AndI\u2019d go see the people. And you see, that was the first selection,\nbut it was __, that 1s what Rosh Hosanna. And my husband was working in the airport. He\nmet there a farmer. All the farmers used to come and help to build the airport, you know, sand and\nstonesand \u2014\u2014_s everything. My husband start talking to him, and he asked him if he knew a man\nwho got a brother, his name was Itsak Kolinitzki (ph). \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cYes, I do know him. He\u2019s\nstill alive. He didn\u2019t go to the ghetto.\u201d He said, \u201cYou are sure?\u201d And he told him where, you\nknow, he used to hide himself. And he came home and he told us. I just couldn\u2019t believe it. And\nnow, he would say, \u201cMrs \u2014_\u2014sneeds some medicine.\u201d (ph) Finally, I got in touch with one\nfarmer. And there used to come the farmer, because they used to have the coal, and they used to\ntake us to the Coal Brigade, and the Coal Brigade, I want to go there because I want to get in contact\nwith that man, with that farmer. I took all of the \u2014\u2014.:~: I looked like a , | didn\u2019t\nlook like Jewish. And I was going there to the people, and the people they were nice and -- like I\nsaid, some people, they were good. And I come to that farmer. And when I come to that farmer,\nthat\u2019s the way I got in contact with my uncle, with my uncle the farmer (ph), because his farm was\nransacked, and of course, was the other -- Julius was his name. I then got the -- how did he survive?\nI don\u2019t know. I lost contact to him. Then they had the big selection.",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: In October, I think the 20 or the 28th. It was bitter cold. And things got -- we survived, you\nknow. But they took out close to 10,000 people, and the people got killed.",
        "Q: Can you describe -- did you witness this selection? Were you at this selection? Were you there\nwhen they --",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Can you describe it?",
        "A: The way it was? Well, you see -- my family was with us, together. And my husband , who\nspoke fluently German, and he talk to him. And when he talk to him and explained to him, what is\nhis , what is his occupation, so he told him that he\u2019s a mechanic -- he was a mechanic like I\nam right now a mechanic. So, you see, the working people, like tailor, shoemakers, all different\nkind of people, you know, but they have an occupation, you know? So, once they find out that you\nare a mechanic, you are on the top, they wouldn\u2019t bother you, they know that you are good. So\nthat\u2019s what had happened that we were lucky, the way my husband explained to him. And we\nsurvived.",
        "Q: Can you describe for me something. When all of these people were taken away, when people\nwere going to the left or the mght, what were the people doing? Were they quiet, were they\nscreaming?",
        "A: You know? What [Il tell you. It 1s hard to describe. He became like a stone. It\u2019s nothing he\ncan do. You have to go in that heap. It is fear. Fear and pain. Because you don\u2019t know.\n, or that is your list, that is the list . But fortunately, we were lucky. When my\nhusband told them that he\u2019s a mechanic, and he\u2019s working, [Pause] -- When he told him that he\u2019s a\nmechanic, he told him to go right, so my parents survived, and we survived.",
        "Q: Now, a question. When you went out on these work brigades -- when you went out to work on\nthe work brigades, how did you get chosen to go on one team or another.",
        "A: That wasn\u2019t so easy, hon. If you didn\u2019t go to work, they had the Jewish police. The Jewish\npolice, when there was missing people, they would go on a hunt and see where the people are. I\nwas arrested. I didn\u2019t go to work, I don\u2019t know what had happened. Jay didn\u2019t feel good or\nsomething, and my sister-in-law, her name was Goldie, she didn\u2019t go to work either. So what they\ndid, they took us -- they took us in jail. And we fight with them. And people whom the police\n_____ knew saw we fight with them, so we stopped fighting, so they took us to the police. When\n______were released, my husband came from work and so he start telling the head man, he then\ntook all over (ph), and then they released us. It\u2019s so many things to say.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s take a break right now, okay? We need to take a break.\nEnd of Tape 1.\nTape 2",
        "Q: I wanted to know how you got chosen for a different work group.",
        "A: Oh, that. We used to get up in the morning, 4:00 in the morning. Had a cup of coffee. Had to\nmake coffee, you know I -- You didn\u2019t have anything, no wood, no nothing, so you used to take a\nbig nail, a heavy one, put it into the electricity, and have a little -- something, you know, like a jar --\nand you put it in in the jar, and the water was boiling and you didn\u2019t have coffee, but , we\nused to call it. It is just like something -- and we used to have in the morning, before we went, to\nhave that, and a tiny little slice bread, and go to work. Sometimes we didn\u2019t have the bread. So, at\nleast to have warm inside. And I used to go out, I used to see the Bad (ph) Brigade, but you can\u2019t\nget because there was a whole lot people, but I knew them. But fortunately, I used to be lucky.\nFortunately, they used to pull me out from the Good brigade, and take me to the Bad brigade. What\nmeans a Good brigade? A Good brigade means you can work hard, it\u2019s no different. What it is,\nyou are young, you are healthy, and then you take something to run in, around the people there\nbecause ___ uSed to be, and sell them something -- like a sleep, a place (ph), a something,\nwhatever you had. And for that, you used to get some food. So at least -- or used to have some\nbread. Butter? We didn\u2019t know what it means, butter. No butter, no milk, no nothing. But at least,\nwhen you had the bread, you see, the coffee, like I explained to you, it\u2019s okay, you can make it.\nWho knew what it means, meat? Nothing. You didn\u2019t have nothing. But potatoes was very good,\nyou know. A potato you can mix up with something else or you have to have. And you make\nsomething, add meal from that (ph). I remember one time, that they said you can bring in food.\nWell, the Good brigade -- when you used to have -- I used to take off my Star of David. I looked\nlike a . And I was gone from one place, from one door to the other. Until, you know, they\nused to give us something. Some people said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any,\u201d but they just potato\npeels. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, too.\u201d I used to take potato peels. Whatever we could get to bring home.\nPotato peels, they wouldn\u2019t bother you so much -- unless (ph) they used to think that you have\nsomething else.",
        "Q: Now, what would happen if you got caught bringing this food back?",
        "A: Terrible, terrible. They used to send you in jail. That -- you were lucky. If they send you to jail.\nBut some was good for me, you know, who was the brigade commanders (ph), you know, with the\nGerman guards. There was already good ones who let you go to do -- some of them was murderers.\nThey didn\u2019t. If they had caught you -- it didn\u2019t hurt me so much the way they beat me up for the\nbread -- I didn\u2019t kill the pain, but I killed the pain for the hunger, to be hungry. For not having, but\nfor taking away the bread from me. You see what I mean? You didn\u2019t kill no pain. But pain was\nhunger, no food to eat. Starving. So when we used to go the brigade, we used to have a Good\nbrigade, so at least you used to get some clothes to change for food. So, when I used to come to the\nChristians there that knew me already, so they used to give me something to eat, a slice bread, it was\nokay, with some water.",
        "Q: Now, did these Christians -- did they think you were just a poor farmer girl or what?",
        "A: Hmm-mm. The Christians?",
        "Q: Yeah. When you went to get something from them.",
        "A: Well, I used to come back -- they didn\u2019t give you for free. But we were lucky that they gave us,\nfor the clothes, what they had, because they figured, they said, that the ghetto -- the models (ph)\nfrom the clothes. Because why\u2019? Clothes you could have. They didn\u2019t take away. They took away\nfrom you the books, the paintings, the grand things. But clothes, as much as you could, you could\ntake it in. The furniture, everything, you have to give. So you see? So when you used to have\nsomething to change, why not? They used to give you, you know? So they used to have a\n, you see. It means that you used to have a good day with the food, but what you got,\nyou are happy. I was running, smiling, I have something. But the worst thing was if you came to\nthe ghetto, to the brigade, you know. So, if you had a good brigade, then you go through. If you\nhave Bad brigade, you\u2019re in trouble.",
        "Q: And how did you know which one you were in?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s what happened to me. I was looking for a good brigade. I knew where the good\nbrigade was. And I was moving from one place to the other, and that\u2019s what I got caught, and that\u2019s\nwhat I got beat up. But it didn\u2019t, like I said, it didn\u2019t bother me, it didn\u2019t hurt me, you know, the\nway I was beated up, but it hurt me why I lost the bread. It\u2019s rich people, known people, in\nLithuania, they didn\u2019t have nothing to eat. My husband -- he\u2019ll tell you tomorrow about it -- the\nway we used to help them -- from the same, what we had, you split in half -- half for us and half for\nthem. And... I was young, I was strong, it was in the family. She lost a husband, she was with a\n______, with her father and mother and I remember a young girl, a lady. She was married and her\nhusband got killed. I think by the 550 people.",
        "Q: Oh, tell me about that, will you?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: You forgot to tell me about that.",
        "A: Yeah. The 550 people. It was across from our house. And my husband wasn\u2019t there, and I was\nrunning to look for him that he shouldn\u2019t come home. And all -- a whole lot friends, educated\npeople -- they asked just for the educated people because they had to find out and -- |\ndon\u2019t know how to say in English, but that\u2019s okay, you can find out. So, everybody, just for two\ndays\u2019 walk, or three days\u2019 walk, so they was exactly across from our house. And there was about\n550 young people. And they took all the people and killed them. Believe it. Five hundred and fifty\ncareer __. Friends of friends, lawyers, doctors . . . it was unbelievable. People couldn\u2019t believe\nthat that could happen. And in two days, it was finished. Where they took him to the Ninth Fort.\nThe Ninth Fort, my husband, the \u2014\u2014\u2014_s asked _ him about it, \u201cPlease do it.\u201d\u201d. He could tell you\neverything the way it happened. They had been killed -- I don\u2019t know how many German people\nfrom Germany killed. So when you go, ask him. He could tell you more about tt.",
        "Q: When did this action take place?",
        "A: That it happened when we got in and the ghetto, was August, the 20, I think. And that had\nhappened before -- in a week, or two weeks later, when we got in in the ghetto. Then they took all\nthe educated people, and they said they had to send them to the city order and to straighten out all\nthe paperwork. \u201cPlease, and we need some help.\u201d And that\u2019s the way they took her husband. And\nthey took them, and two days later, it was finished. We knew, somebody told us. Well. . .",
        "Q: Let me ask you a question. Back to the work.",
        "A: Again?",
        "Q: When you went to work, who watched over your children?",
        "A: My little girl -- I lost her before I got in the ghetto. My mother, she used to take care of my little\nboy. See, that\u2019s why I could go to work, because I know he\u2019s in good hands. But still, the fear --\nbecause we used say in the other little cities, you know? -- they used to kill the children and take\nthem away from the parents, and so on. So as long as I had my mother, my father, I was strong.\nBut the fear inside I had . . . if I had come home, I hope I could find my little boy.",
        "Q: What happened to your daughter?",
        "A: To my little girl? She died. She died before I got in the ghetto.",
        "Q: She was sick?",
        "A: Yes. She was only four months old. And the way we were running and coming back, the way I\ntold you before? And it was no help from doctors and so on and so she passed away. During in the\nghetto, a lifetime, I used to run -- I used to get orders from the farmers, from the Christian people,\nwhat they need. \u201cCan you bring me so-and-so? I'll have for you a nice package.\u201d I used to run in\nthe ghetto, look at somebody had something, what they ask. And I used to ask him, how much does\nhe want? And he used to tell me the price, how much they want to have. I used to go there to the\npeople, the Christian people, who order, and I used to get, you know, a package or money, whatever\nitis. But the main thing it is that they want to have, you know -- food. So, it wasn\u2019t too hard to run\nand to go and to sell it to the people and bring for the people who needs the food. And now we had\nenough food for a couple days, probably, enough bread and so on. I stopped talking about the\nfamily, you know. But she had her parents, and she went herself. Her name was Bergma, Celia\n(ph). No food, no clothes, no -- even no water. So one day, they said that you can take in some\nwood, in the ghetto. You know what I did? I brought her -- you know, the wood -- and I gave to\nher and I told her (ph), go ahead, you go have hot water, you can have something to cook on. It\nwas a risk to go out. It was really a risk. You think that the -- the Christian people, they used to say,\n\u2018Please try to be careful. Try to be careful because you never know what can happen to you.\u201d But\nwhen hunger -- when you\u2019re hungry, you don\u2019t have nothing to heed. Nothing can stop you. I\ndidn\u2019t care. Let them shoot me. Let them kill me. As long I am alive, I'll try to have something,\nthe main thing was, you see, my Jay. It wasn\u2019t easy. But the hardest thing in the world was for me\nwhen I lost my people.",
        "Q: How did that happen?",
        "A: Well, nothing hard when I had my people -- my parents, my brothers, my sister. And in ten\nminutes, I lost them, in ten minutes. They had to have some people for _\u2014_, for Estonia. I don\u2019t\nknow how many people -- 500 or 600 people. I find out later, instead, they should go and get one\nperson, they said, the singles (ph). It would take them a whole lot to get the people, so they took\nbigger families. So, what they did, they took my family. Five people in ten minutes. Right before I\ntear them out of my arms, they was already gone. [Crying] I couldn\u2019t do nothing. I couldn\u2019t do not\na thing because the police and the German guards, and I didn\u2019t thought that that could happen to\nthem. It was about ten or eleven o\u2019clock in the morning. Since then, I didn\u2019t see them anymore.\nMy last -- please forgive me, I\u2019m sorry. But do you know what it means to lose your family in ten\nminutes? I never could forget. And I shall never forget. At night, you cannot sleep, you\u2019ve got the\ndreams. It\u2019s awful. It\u2019s awful, it\u2019s painful.",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Do you remember when this happened? When did this happen?",
        "A: In October of 1943. Between that time, there was a city with the name Shabut (ph), and there\nwas a number of Jewish people. And the people of Shabut (ph), that was, at that time, from October\nuntil December. They took the children from the parents out there. And somebody came to tell us\nthat the children from Shabut (ph) had been taken away from the parents. Children, little ones, until\nup to 12 years. Twelve years, they can still go on at the work \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014. - So I said to my husband,\nwhat he should do, before I find out about the farmer, that my uncle is still alive. I got in contact\nwith the farmer, Martinez (ph), that was his name. ANd, like I told you, my uncle used to help them\na whole lot. So, they want to pay back to him, to help him. He was out in 82 places doing things.\nEighty-two places. The only thing that it was to get in contact 1s somebody had to contact them that\nwe should survive if it was with Jay, or maybe to send Jay alone. I finally got in contact with that\nJultus Schmitt (ph), with him that was his neighbor. And I used to send him some medicine, too.\nAnd then I used to send for him, for the farmer, he wants a suit I used to bring him, a suit. I used to\nrun away, like I told you. I used to make my work, my work is finished, then I used to take off my\nStar of David, and used to run. I used to go. There was a coal brigade. There was, not too far from\nthe coal brigade, a neighbor. And that man used to come to that neighbor. They knew each other.\nSo when I got in over there, I used to find him. When I found him, first I have to finish my work.\nFour women has to finish to shovel the coal from the -- what you call it? -- train. So they used to\nhave -- oy, like a choo choo train. So when I finish my work, and everything already finished, they\ndidn\u2019t bother you, as long you finished at the coal brigade (ph). Then I went with him and I got in\ncontact with him. And I told him about the baby. And I said, \u201cPlease, immediately, try to get my\nuncle and tell him about the teddy (ph). And please, he should help us to get out from the ghetto.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the way I got in contact with my uncle. And I was in the brigade. And then, I had a nice,\ngood package. He brought me some -- like, eggs, and he got a few pieces of butter, and bread, and\nflour. And when I got that, it was already late. The coal brigade was already gone. And I was left\nover by myself. Now, what should Ido? Where shouldI _? It\u2019s no place. No place where to\ngo and what to do. I was fortunately lucky. It was there go slow (ph), you know -- what you call it?\nIt was a brigade, but they used to make -- go slow, allthe \u2014\u2014_, and they used to take up from the\ngarden.",
        "Q: Cabbage?",
        "A: Right. So that brigade was the latest. And fortunately, I was lucky that somebody told me you\ngot one more brigade coming. And that brigade, when I said, \u201cSee me,\u201d they grabbed me right\naway and they brought me in the ghetto. And I came to safety. It happened there at the coal\nbrigade, was easy to make a Pekel (ph), they way they said, you know, a package. So it was a good\nday. Everybody from the women that finished. And some people used to know already that some\npeople got clothes or something, you know. They made some packages -- good for us (ph).And all\nof a sudden, the guard from Gestapo came in to see what\u2019s going on by the coal brigade. Had seen\ntheir packages. And he asked, \u201cWhose package is this one?\u201d One girl got up and she said, \u201cIt\u2019s\nmine.\u201d She said, \u201cTake the package.\u201d \u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014. Who she did, nobody knows. I had seen what had\nhappened to her, so I already run away. I didn\u2019t look to him. And that arrogant Gestapo, what\nhappened to her. I just don\u2019t know. Because why? She had a package. That was wrong. That was\nwrong. The life in ghetto is worse than a dog in the street. Four o\u2019clock in the morning, they used\n. They used to call up to get dressed and get out and take them in a special place, special\nfield. Cold, bitter cold, to test what the people gonna do. Having my little boy, before you dressed\nhim -- here you couldn\u2019t see here in the clothes. I used to put up everything in his little bed that he\nused to be -- put up everything that in the morning, if it should rain, I should have right away for\nhim, to dress him, and to be outside. How many people have there been -- in there room? No, less\nthan that -- eight -- I think about eighteen or nineteen, maybe more. People there were sleeping on\nthe floors. There was no beds, no sofas. But at least we had a pillow. And we had, you know, a\n, whatever. It\u2019s -- who can describe the horrible things in the ghettos. No ink can write, no\nwriter can write up what we had to do during the three years. But one thing that 1t was to me, as I\ntold you, that was my people there.",
        "Q: Let me ask you two questions, okay? You okay?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When you were living in the ghetto, did you still have Chabas (ph)? Did you still celebrate the\nholidays?",
        "A: The holidays?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Could you practice your religion while you were in the ghetto?",
        "A: Yeah, we used to have the holidays. But each holiday, when it used to come, the Gestapo gave\nyou right away a holiday -- taking people, sending them to the Ninth Fort, to kill the people there, to\ntake off their bodies from the . . . from the caves. We never had a holiday that we should enjoy.\nBecause each holiday, when it used to come, always used to be bitter because they used -- they\nalways gave you such a rough time. Used to take our peoples, they used to kill the people, they\nused to hang the people. Honey, I cannot tell you, just in the three hours, what they did. Before they\nwent to the airport, they took 2,000 people -- and it was Rosh Hosanna -- and some people didn\u2019t\nwant to go because it was the holidays. And what do you think they did? They killed them. They\nkilled them to show them that you must go to work, it\u2019s no holidays. So you asked me about\nholidays -- each holiday, no matter what, when used to come, always was bitter, full with tears, full\nof fear, full of pain. You cannot describe, even in Yiddish, which I know so good, I wouldn\u2019t be\nable to describe it. But I went through, and so many people went through. But, I was fortunately\nlucky. Iam alive. There have been other people -- no more.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a little more about the ghetto life. Were there -- other than your working, were\nthere other activities going on in the ghetto? Were there -- was that -- how did the children go to\nschool?",
        "A: I think the children -- activities there was, but for the children, they used to have school. That\u2019s\nwhat they had, but they didn\u2019t know. It was all secretly, you see? But they used to have for the\nchildren a school. And it was teachers, and that was, but they didn\u2019t know. The Gestapo didn\u2019t\nknow. But we had activities -- I don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t know. Because you see, I was a slave. I\nwas a Slave. I used to go out in the morning, come back, see everybody\u2019s okay. Tired. Thinking\nwhat tomorrow will be. Will you have to get up early in the morning -- 4:00. So, I don\u2019t know too\nmuch about the activities, I\u2019m honest with you. But I know that they have a school for the children.\nAnd then, it wasn\u2019t too many. It was already each time, each quarter of the year, like three months,\nsix months. Each time something had happened and they had an excuse. Something had happened\nand they used to take out. That happened, that sort of thing happened. (ph)",
        "Q: Were there workshops inside the ghetto where people were --",
        "A: Yeah, inside the ghetto was the workshop, too. And some of them were going outside, and the --\nbut not everybody was lucky to get in there, you know? It wasn\u2019t a whole lot people. I don\u2019t know,\nI\u2019ve never been there. Because like I said, I was beating with myself, running here and there. But it\nwas -- they used to make for the shoulders, you know, like gloves and socks and all different things,\nyou know, there. In Europe, used to be very cold. And more things, you know, for the Gestapo.\nThey used to come and want this suit, or a uniform to make and so on. THey used to tell them to\nmake it. And that way we survived, because the workmanship, the working people. And that the\nway I survived because I told them that I am not a saleslady, not that, but I am a dressmaker.",
        "Q: Who was in charge of all of the workers? Was it the Gestapo? Was it the --",
        "A: No, the Jewish people inside. The Gestapo was outside. The Gestapo had __, like -- how do\nyou Say it -- the Gestapo didn\u2019t come near to the ghetto, but they had their own building. And when\nit used to come to selection, the first thing was the Gestapo.",
        "Q: The Gestapo ran the selection.",
        "A: The Gestapo used to come in the ghetto, oh yeah. They used to come into the ghetto. I\nremember one thing that had happened with a man. I couldn\u2019t remember too close, but my Jay will\nremember -- the way they hang some two people or more. And they took out all the people who\nwas inside, that they should come and see the way it happened.",
        "Q: Now, tell me a little bit about the administration in the ghetto. There was a unirat (ph)?",
        "A: The unirat (ph).",
        "Q: Yeah. How was that chosen? Did you know them?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. I know. I know that . We all participated (ph). Tova [ph}? He studied with\nmy husband, together. He was in the unirat (ph). And then was , Dr. Gerschon (ph). He\nwas from Shabut (ph) and he came here because he got married, for a girl, you know, who\u2019s from\nKovno. And then more people -- they was very active. And they came in, you know, when it was\nthe big selection, the 10,000 people, like I told you. They asked, Gestapo asked -- Dr. Elkis (ph)\nwas a famous doctor in. -~They want to have so many, so many people. And Dr. Elkis (ph)\nsaid, \u201cI will not give you, I will not select people. Go ahead and do by yourself. So when we got\nout, it was in October 28th, I think, in the big field. And then you have to have luck -- who\u2019s alive\nand who\u2019s dead. And then they took out close to 10,000 people and they killed them, all of them. I\nthink -- I don\u2019t know -- one survived, but I know that all of them got killed because they didn\u2019t let\nnobody stay at home, and everybody has to go out. And Dr. Elkis (ph) didn\u2019t want to have on his\nconscience that here, that is your life, and that 1s your dead. And then the unirat, you know, they\nused to have some trouble there. But they used to do something for them -- they gave them a year\n(ph), a present, or something, I don\u2019t know. The people trouble as they was in Gestapo, you know,\nbut you go into the Gestapo, it is good-bye. You are not coming back to the ghetto, you are not\ncoming back alive. So we used to help them. There was -- I forgot, I tell you. It\u2019s\nalready 50 years away. And you cannot remember. And my memory is not anymore what it used\nto be before.",
        "Q: Were the people on the unirat (ph), were they good people?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: The members of the unirat, were they good people?",
        "A: They were Lithuanian.",
        "Q: The people who served on the unirat (ph), the members of the unirat(ph) . . .",
        "A: In the unirat (ph)?",
        "Q: Yeah. Were they good people?",
        "A: Oh, well, you know. It was a hard job, but it -- I don\u2019t want to say anything else. They were\nrough. The police was rough. The Jewish police was very rough. It was hard. I want to tell you\none more thing -- the way I got with my uncle. The day we run away from the ghetto --",
        "Q: Okay, but let me just -- I want you to tell me about that, but I just want to sort of finish the ghetto\npart of my questions. There\u2019s some things I\u2019m really curious about.",
        "A: Well, listen, for somebody, they were good. For somebody they were bad. You have to have\nvitamin tea, you know what it means? For . If you didn\u2019t have yellows, if you had yellow\ntea -- say, you have bad people and they are rough to...",
        "Q: When you went to jail, was that the Jewish jail?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: When you said you had to go to the jail that time -- you were sent to the jail, remember?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was that a Jewish police in the jail?",
        "A: I don\u2019t follow.",
        "Q: Okay, remember you told me that one time you were sent to the jail, to the prison.",
        "A: Oh, in prison.",
        "Q: Was that a Jewish police?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Ohh.",
        "A: Jewish police. I beat him up, too. And they took me in jail, my sister-in-law and myself. And I\nwas working every single day. Every single day I was working. Get up early in the morning -- rain,\ncold, snow. No matter what it is, you have to go.",
        "Q: Now, this unirat (ph) -- were they in charge of the working...",
        "A: The unirat was in charge for the Gestapo. You see, the unirat, they used to lead, like a\ngovernment. And they used to get orders. They used to know when there came up a selection.\nThey used to be the first ones to find out. And that\u2019s what it was. And if something was wrong,\nthey used to call the police. The police was rough, tough. Very rough. Some of them were...",
        "Q: Do you think that sometimes they helped the people? Did they warn you about the actions?",
        "A: No. They never did. But I know -- well, the last action, what it was, a selection, the last one.\nNobody knew. Because they were so good that they said, \u201cYou can take in food, as much as you\ncan.\u201d They allowed you to bring in food. And by getting the food, I had a funny feeling, because\neach time, when they used to say, \u201cYou can bring food in the ghetto,\u201d Not to be afraid, you know,\nbut they come to help (ph). In the next two days or three days, a selection. And that\u2019s what I\nremember -- that when I had food brought, heavier than I was -- a pekel (ph), the way we used to\nsay it -- and I said to myself, I hope everything will be okay. And in the next two days, it was\nselection. So there was, you know, like a government in ghetto. ANd in charge was Dr. Elkis (ph),\na . Like I told you, and the few of them, what I know. But nothing could help you. Just\nyou have to find out for yourself what you can do.",
        "Q: Do you think that the life was different for a woman in the ghetto than it was for a man?",
        "A: I think it was mostly the same thing. The women . And for the men, they used to\ntake him, you know, to hard labor, different things to do. But for the women, the same thing, no\ndifferent. No difference. I used to do all the hard work, all the hard work. That was my --like I said\n-- my luck. When I used to have a good brigade, they used to push me out. You don\u2019t know what it\nused to be in the morning, on a big field, and to have the brigades, one goes to here, and one goes\nthere. And all of a sudden, you got in in the good brigade, they pulled you out. And how many\ntimes I was beated up from the police.",
        "Q: The Jewish police.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was there -- for a woman, was it different because maybe in addition to doing the hard work,\nyou also were more responsible for the children?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t care for the children. You see, if they lost their husband, and she was by herself\nwith a child, they didn\u2019t bother her. But who\u2019s with a family, you have to go to work.",
        "Q: Were any women in the ghetto pregnant?",
        "A: Oh, yes, indeed.",
        "Q: And they were allowed to have their children?",
        "A: Many people got pregnant and they had to make abortion. And it had to be quiet. Nobody\nshould know. Because if they go find something, you get killed. Like, they took away in 19-- when\nthey got into the ghetto, that was I think in September. And all the frills, what you had -- all the\ngold and silver and diamonds -- should be turned in to the Gestapo. If one -- if they go find out that\none didn\u2019t turn in, ten families from the family where you are will be killed. And you know what\nmy father did? My mother, as they got, you know, some fears (ph), he took apart and he wound it\nup -- and they didn\u2019t kill them. I had my purse I gave away, too, to that to the -- like I told you, to\ngood Christians. But then they changed. They changed. They wasn\u2019t the same anymore. If you\nwent there to get the clothes, you know what they did? They killed you. They killed you after the\nLiberation. And they told me I shouldn\u2019t go and ask for the clothes because you'll get killed. I said,\n\u201cWell, Hitler didn\u2019t kill me, to heck with them.\u201d",
        "Q: Were you aware, in the ghetto, of any people who were sort of in an underground group of\nresistance?",
        "A: Oh, there was underground people, too.",
        "Q: Did you know them?",
        "A: Some of them I already did, you know, like the partisan (ph). And the last one, whom I knew,\nhe\u2019s already dead.",
        "Q: But at the time, did you know about them?",
        "A: At the time, I tell you, I knew that they exist -- a partisan group. But I wasn\u2019t there. I wasn\u2019t\ninvolved. My husband wasn\u2019t involved. Because at that time, I had my people, and I had my\nfamily. You see, Jay, myself, and... but after Liberation, then was time to talk. YOu could talk.\nBecause you were afraid of your own shadow, that somebody should know or not. Darling, I tell\nyou something. It is so much, so much. I didn\u2019t finish. I want to tell you another thing. You\nfinished with the ghetto?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Pll go to my uncle. We got Jay, my husband and myself. We got already that man who came to\npick us up and to take us in -- 1t was about 60 or 70 kilometers -- 100 kilometers from\nthat place where my uncle was.",
        "Q: How did you get out of the ghetto?",
        "A: That\u2019s what I want to tell you. So, and a month later, when I lost my people, they told us that\nthey . They took the children away from the mothers. And we didn\u2019t know when to save\nJay\u2019s life. I didn\u2019t care for myself. And \u2014__, he said, \u201cEdna, what happen to Jay will happen to\nus. If Jay\u2019s gone, all of us will go. Don\u2019t look for some other places where to leave him.\u201d So then\nhe give me a push to go see my uncle again. And when they came already to that point, the way\nthey were talking and everything was set up, we cut the wires -- -- and Jay walked out\nfirst. And he went across the street there, and we told Jay, \u201cHere and here,\u201d and it was gone. Here\nand here in that place. We\u2019ll be there in another half hour, maybe. Please don\u2019t call, don\u2019t scream,\ndon\u2019t say anything. Jay was waiting there for us -- there was another man who will pick us up. It\ntook us about a half hour to go out on the wires. And you have to watch the guard. When the guard\nwas away, and everything was quiet, we got through the wires, and we came to where Jay was. And\nthat man,his name was Martinez (ph). And he took us there where my uncle was. What I did, I\ntook Martinez (ph) a jacket. You know, he scout (ph). Igaveitto \u2014\u2014_, to my husband, and his I\ngave to Martinez (ph) because he is a Prussian (ph). And if he didn\u2019t look like a Jewish person, and\nwhen we were driving, we took Jay in that wagon. On top of that, we put up straw that you\nshouldn\u2019t see that the child is there. And I had -- from a Christian, I had somebody years ago, a\nlittle jacket, you know, a little coat, and put on a scarf, and both of us looked like Prussian (ph)\npeople, like farmers. And sure enough, we drove up. It was about 30 miles from Kovno. And they\nstopped us. My heart was beating. And I said, that is the end. And what had happened, he said,\n\u201cHave you got eggs for sale? Have you got something else for sale?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d That man,\nMartinez (ph), himself, he said, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t have anything for sale.\u201d \u201cOh, well, good-bye.\u201d But\nthat was a lucky moment. Finally, where should we go? So that farmer was very nice and he took\nus in to his house -- raining, cold, you know. We came in. He didn\u2019t took us right away to his\nhouse, but he took us to his brother-in-law\u2019s house. And Jay was there under the straw, and all of a\nsudden, he starts saying, \u201cMama, Daddy -- Mama, Daddy.\u201d And the farmer, his brother-in-law said,\n\u201cWhat do I hear? I hear a voice.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cGo away. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking\nabout.\u201d Lucky number again. And we brought there, then we came to his house. We came to his\nhouse and was there for 39 days. The time was up. We find out that some people -- a lawyer from\na ghetto -- it means my uncle\u2019s nephew is here hiding. He told us we have to go and not delay\nbecause we are in trouble. Gestapo, you know, the police, you know from over there -- the German\npolice -- they was looking for the people. And there was, across from them, somebody left a little\nboy or a girl, to hide them. They killed him. It\u2019s so many things, I tell you. It happened so fast,\nwhere to start. And then, we came to his house. And by going back, to another farmer, he said,\n\u201cPlease, get in, all of us, in one place.\u201d Like this. ANd we looked, a big storm. And we heard not a\nfire from that place. The Germans was running to look around. And we were sitting there for an\nhour. Cold, bitter cold, just like that. That it shouldn\u2019t look like we are Jewish people. That, see,\nthat we are hiding. And they didn\u2019t find us. That was another lucky number.",
        "Q: Let me stop here for a minute.",
        "A: It\u2019s finished. It\u2019s 4:00.",
        "Q: Okay.\nEnd of Tape 2.\nTape 3",
        "Q: So you were in hiding for a long time, huh?",
        "A: For nine months.",
        "Q: Did you move around a lot or did you stay 1n one place the whole time?",
        "A: Oh, no. You have to move. Right now, I\u2019m coming -- can I say?",
        "Q: Please.",
        "A: So then, he told us, he said, \u201cGet all together in one place, that it should look like a big rock.\u201d\nHe himself, I shall never forget, got down on the ground, and lay down and he said, \u201cThey are\ncoming.\u201d It means the German police -- I don\u2019t know who it was. After everything was over, he\nsaid to me, \u201cYou know, where should I take you?\u201d I told him, \u201cYou know? Take me to\nPashkovski (ph).\u201d He said, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll take you there. But say anything to them that I brought\nyou.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He brought us there and he was waiting until we go inside. We got in\nthere and knocked on the door. The dogs was barking and barking and barking and barking and I\ndidn\u2019t know what it was. And I knocked on the door. He got back. He got scared when he\u2019s up\nseeing me (ph). I said, \u201cDon\u2019t get scared. Do you know Heika (ph)?\u201d That\u2019s the way they used\nto call her. \u201cYes.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m Heika\u2019s (ph) daughter.\u201d \u201cHow did you come here?\u201d I said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know when I used to be a little girl, I used to come here and we got, you know, some\nfish, and we go fishing and so on?\u201d \u201cOh, yeah. So what you hear? How did you come? How\ndid you know?\u201d I said, \u201cI know the place very good. I could come and I could go.\u201d \u201cWho\nbrought you here? What you got here?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I have a person who took me here, not to\nyour place. But I knew exactly which way to go -- to the right, or to the left, or so on.\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cPlease let me in.\u201d He looked at me and he said, \u201cOkay, go in. You are sure nobody\nbrought you here?\u201d I said, \u201cIf somebody would\u2019ve brought me here, I would have told you.\u201d\nBUt I told him to remind him, \u201cYou don\u2019t remember me, but you remember my mother. Do you\nremember when -- Mrs. Preskovski (ph) -- when she worked there, in hospital, you know, my\nmother, the way I told you, my mother used to cook and come to be with them and give them\nsome food and so on.\u201d He said, \u201cYes, it\u2019s true.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou used to come to our house\nwith the horses and buggy.\u201d He said, \u201cYes. Ah-ha. So you are Heika\u2019s (ph) daughter.\u201d I said,\n\u201cYes. And that is my husband. And that is my son.\u201d I said, \u201cPlease let me in for a couple days\nuntil I get in contact with my uncle.\u201d And my uncle told all the farmers where he is and where\nhe is located -- not all of them, but a few of them., like that Martinez (ph). He knew everything.\nAnd he said, \u201cLet me tell you something\u201d -- All to the farmers .. . \u201cIf you want to get me out,\u201d\nhe said, \u201clet me tell you one thing. Not one of you will be left alive.\u201d Because it was not\nallowed to keep Jewish people. So he was in 82 places. Each time in another place, each time.\nThe way people running from one place to the other. So, when it happened, that case. And he\nlet us stay until -- I think six days or seven. And he starts looking around, why the dogs was\nbarking. Why the dogs was barking. Something was wrong in their house. He said, \u201cI cannot\nkeep you anymore.\u201d I said, \u201cPut us in the potatoes bin,\u201d you know, where the yeast is. Nothing\ndoing. He got in contact with my uncle. And my uncle took us to another place. To .\nAnd by working over there, we were working -- I don\u2019t know, a good while -- until we came to\nthat farm. And poor farmer, very poor farmer, but very good people. Very good people. They\nshare with us whatever they had. And my uncle used to come every week and to bring us some\nbread, milk for my -- for Jay. And so on, because they didn\u2019t have anything. They didn\u2019t have a\ncow. They got only one pig, or two, and two sheeps. When we came there, my uncle came. And\nhe said, \u201cHere is that place. Try to be as long as you can.\u201d And the farmers, already, was afraid,\nthat in case somebody will give him out. So all the farmers will get killed. So they were\nwatching already. You see, they was watching -- they was watching him that nobody should\ngive him out, in case or now they\u2019re all in trouble. He came over there. And my uncle used to\ncome there. But we have to have a hiding place. Because we heard that, you see, the Germans\nare losing. And that, to make a hiding place to be was impossible. And what had happened,\nthere was two potato pits. And my husband made out a grave, and he made a tunnel to go in\nfrom one to the other. And it was no air to breathe. He made just a little bitty hole, that even\nyou couldn\u2019t match up a light, a match to light up. We were there for nine months. The rest of\nmy tale is the truth. Whatever had happened with my husband, he can tell you tomorrow. I fear\nnot the Liberation. We didn\u2019t have no clothes, no nothing. Darling...",
        "Q: How did you live in that hole for so long?",
        "A: How did -- it wasn\u2019t only us. It my uncle. He had two children, his wife, his sister-in-law\nwith a child. And other people came in, you know. We had maybe about 20 people hiding there.\nYou couldn\u2019t work, you couldn\u2019t . We were like dead people on the floor. You\ncouldn\u2019t stand. And at night, when it was already dark, when they used to go out and catch fresh\nair. We were there for nine or eight months in that grave.",
        "Q: How did you get food?",

        "Q: So the people hiding with you, there was different relatives.",
        "A: Yes. You see, that was the farmers, the way I told you, that my uncle used to live in peace\nwith them. He used to help them a whole lot. And my grandmother, shall she rest in peace, she\nused to help them, too. And that what they liked. ,1n Lithuanian. And that\u2019s why\nthey liked him, and that\u2019s why they helped him to survive. It\u2019s unbelievable.",
        "Q: What did you do all day?",

As long we had, you know, the corn put\nit up, you know, hay, we used to be on top. Then, it start coming up lower and lower and lower.\nAnd it was no place left to go. That was the last place, take it or leave it, like somebody said.\nAnd my husband said they were looking there and said, \u201cYou know, maybe the potato peaks (ph)\nwill be just right because one wasn\u2019t far from the other.

The good Lord maybe saved our\nlives, by going from one ___ to the tunnel, and not having no support, whatsoever, fall down\nand you can, you know, get killed. So that saved our life.

He had a little lamp, you know, with a little, little, very little light. And\npeople inside, in the house, we didn\u2019t know. And all the friends were locked up, sleeping. They\nhad a dog. And the dog start running here and there, and he was barking, and we didn\u2019t know\nwhat it was. Jonas was the name of her son. It was on a Saturday night.

        "A: Well, no. There wasn\u2019t, because there was, you see, just a farm. In the little farms, there was,\nyou know, plenty of Germans. In each town, you had, you know, Germans, and then the\nLithuanians. The murderers.",

And he was beloved by the people.\nThey liked him because he helped them. If he would be a bad farmer, that farm would be\ndifferent. But he used to help everybody who needs some help.

        "Q: Must have been exciting, yes?",
        "A: Yes it was excitement, but excitement with fears. Fear. Pain. What mend the pain? I will\nnot say anymore. I hope I could -- I hoped always I was living this for... maybe I go see my\npeople back. But I never did. And that was really again, perhaps you, too. Pray in full. You\ncouldn\u2019t run away from yourself. Everything you ever had in your life. Hard labor didn\u2019t bother\nme. Didn\u2019t bother me. Hard labor -- I used to forget about my problems.

And some of them\n-- I don\u2019t know how you tell them, how they get out -- that here is the bunkers. So what they did,\nsome of them got out and they killed them.

        "Q: Was Jay in school? Did he go to school?",
        "A: Jay? No, that\u2019s another point. Jay, I think, went to school just for a year, and then they run\naway. They have to run away because our life was very dangerous -- very, very dangerous\nbecause of the communists. My husband will tell you more.",

        "A: Oh, yes. That you could do it. They didn\u2019t -- they wasn\u2019t against you. But they were against\n-- they didn\u2019t have any democracy the way we have here. There, everything that you used to do\nis under the government. Here, democracy means you can do what it please you. You can build\nwhat you want. You can build a business and make money. Pay the tax, the government\nwouldn\u2019t bother you. And you gradually start growing and growing and growing, if you are not\nlazy. If you work, you make. You don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t make. Over there, it\u2019s no democracy.\nYou ask me right now about the Communism. I didn\u2019t want to say anything, but Ill have to\nbring up and to tell you what had happened, why we have to run away. As you know, I was in\nbusiness. I didn\u2019t know that much (ph) about the Communism. In our place, where we used to\nlive, was a George (ph) from the marines (ph). It was a captain over the eight . You\nknow, you heard about . They were rough and tough. The way I used to buy the\nmachines and different things -- and a knitting machine -- somebody want to have a knitting\nmachine. And I found somebody who had a good knitting machine. And a machine that you\ndon\u2019t have to buy the merchandise, you know, but you can make your own wool, you know.\nOkay, they got that machine, and the man gave us some money. And my uncle was there, still\non the farm. And what he gave me was a hog, you know, a cow, a life, and some money -- and\nsome different, you know, food I couldn\u2019t remember. I had potatoes and flour and so on. But as\n(ph) I\u2019m coming back, the girls from concentration camp was alive. But they come back, they\ndidn\u2019t find no children, no husband, no nobody. So where they used to come? To the Ipps, you\nknow -- in Lithuanian, Ipp-es. What I did, I didn\u2019t have too much at that time. So I had the\npotatoes, the potatoes and bread. And I had a big kettle. Put it up, peeled the potatoes with\nonion, pepper -- and it smells, 1t was so good -- and bread -- and I was feeding them with that.\nWhat had happened to me at that time -- when I got that cow, in that place where we used to live\n, there was the officer and the George (ph). And more, you know, from them. We\ntook that cow in the , and we slaughtered it. And we -- like in a butcher shop -- we\nforgot to clean up the place. What had happened, all of a sudden that officer has to come down,\nand he had seen what he take. And he came to me, and he said, \u201cDo you know, because I respect\nyour husband --\u201d I said, \u201cThat would change you?\u201d And he said he could send me out (ph) for\nhard labor for five years. What he did. I said, \u201c (even though it was his name), I don\u2019t\nknow. I have been living in a democracy country, you can do whatever it please -- you can do\nwhatever is good.\u201d I said, \u201cWe will take it out right away and we go clean it up.\u201d I think my\nhusband wasn\u2019t at that time at home. They send him, I think to Beluge (ph), in Lithuania. And I\nsaid, \u201cPlease, don\u2019t mention it. Don\u2019t bring any harm to us. Hitler didn\u2019t kill us. Please.\u201d And\nhe used to come. I used to make the , different things, the Russian food. But I could\ntell, and he was burning. But we got right away a person who came in and cleaned it up and\ngave them away everything that was there left. And he cleaned up and it was beautiful. He said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know that that is not allowed in Russian to do?\u201d I said, \u201c law (ph), how\nshould I --\u201d (You couldn\u2019t call them , you couldn\u2019t call them .) I said, \u201cHow\nshould I know? Please remember one thing. We are raised in a democracy country.\u201d I said, \u201cDo\nyou see, I don\u2019t have any clothes. I want to get something to put on for me. You see my coat?\nWhat I was wearing is here with holes in my elbows.\u201d I said, \u201cI have to do something. This is\nnot making anything. I even don\u2019t have any coal to heat up the apartment.\u201d I said, \u201cPlease\nunderstand. Right now, I see the regulations, \u201cI said, \u201cfrom the Russian government. If you\ncould teach me more, a little about that life, I promise you, I go follow exactly what you go say.\u201d\nAnd I was crying. I was strong, but I start crying because I was afraid for Jay. And now it\u2019s\neasy to have respect, you know. But that particular sd Siberian (ph) -- where would be my\nlittle Jay? And then I have more children who had lost their mothers. And I kept them in my\nplace. I had about four. He said, \u201cOkay. I will tell you what you can do.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat can I\ndo to make a living?\u201d I said, \u201cCan I bake and sell, you know, some little cakes, you know.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cYes, you can do it.\u201d We made a little kitchen -- a stove, a little stove. And the wood was\nso big, like that. And in that little stove, I used to bake and make cookies. Different things. And\nthen I used to take that to the lady that runs the restaurant. And she used to sell them, and I was\nmaking a little money. When \u2014___ came back, he told him the whole history, the way I did.\nFinally, we became good friends. And I told him, I said, \u201cI go follow all the instructions. But\nyou will tell (ph).\u201d And that is no monkey business with them. They can send you away that\nyou don\u2019t know where you are. And they can -- you don\u2019t know what you are anymore. And\nthat was the life of them. Siberia. It came to a moment, that was enough. It was no life. It was -\n-no life. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s come back, maybe about 100 people, or 200 people. Jay was -- at\nthat time, he was going to school. They had the school for the children.",
        "Q: A Jewish school. A Jewish school?",
        "A: Yiddish. Yes, a Yiddish school. And he was going there with some people who survived,\nyou know, the way we did survive. . It\u2019s moment. The day my husband\ntold me about the cookies and the candies. That somebody called my husband that he\u2019s against\nthe government. And they have to see outside, onthe \u2014_\u2014=s, you know, that they have to do\nsomething to send him away in Siberia or to punish him, whatever he was doing. ANd that was\nalready bitter. That was already bad. That was before, but I want to say something else. I\ncouldn\u2019t handle any more. I couldn\u2019t produce any more. The cookies was no life -- to stay and\nto cook all day, and then to sell it to make nothing. Finally, I sold the house that we had. And I\nran back to the George (ph). And I had the -- I knew some people who want to sell the house,\nand they need some money to go ina . It\u2019s a pity-case or something, you know.\nAnd I help them. But with the help, I shouldn\u2019t do it. Because if they would caught me, they\nwould send me to Siberia anyhow. My husband knew that the George (ph). And he introduced\nme to him. When he introduced me to him, I became a lawyer. I start doing the papers, you\nknow, to sell the papers. A thousand in one night. That\u2019s the way I want to tell you. And I\nbecame -- I used to sell the house. I didn\u2019t have no trouble. I had the secretary. She knew me\nalready. I had the people who want to buy. And a happy people who wants the money to get out\nfrom Kovno to go into free world. So 1made money. The truth. I made money, I didn\u2019t have to\nwork hard. But, each time I used to have something else to wear. I didn\u2019t wear the same clothes.\n[Crying] Everything that I was doing was fear. Fear and painful. We made some money. I\nmade it. And it came the moment where we have to leave everything that again I had. And on\nour way, 12:00 at night. To make a long story short, I ran, not to the door, but I open up a\nwindow and jumped out of the window -- jumped out with Jay through the window. In the back\nyard, was there a truck, you know? And he took us to vendors (ph). Between three\nand four months, it took us to get in Berlin. And from Berlin, we got in in the American zone\n(ph). Four months, I forgot my name. Jay said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s my name.\u201d That\u2019s another\nthing -- cannot go on the same name each time. Each time, wherever we went, it was no flowers.\nThey took out my husband from the train. We didn\u2019t know about it. But they took my\nhusband because he was wearing boots. And all of a sudden, they have seen that he got a watch.\nI thought it\u2019s the end. But he said, \u201cLet me go. You want my boots? Here are the boots. In\nanother place, you\u2019ve got your watch. Let us go out.\u201d We had been in Nobody\u2019s Land for four\nor five days. Snow, bitter cold. Jay got sick. It 1s just unbelievable, unbelievable what people\ncan go through -- maybe because I was younger. Well, to make a long story short, it was in\nMunich, and they had there, my husband had a job. Then I want to come to America to see my\nsister and my aunt that was my mother\u2019s sister. I wrote them a letter that I want to come to\nAmerica and I need your help. Didn\u2019t took no time. And I told them I don\u2019t want to be any\nmore on the bloody earth. And we got the papers. I didn\u2019t know what to do, which way to turn\nand which way to go. In Israel, you couldn\u2019t go because it\u2019s no place with no certificate. So,\nfinally, when we came here, people were warm, people were nice. But I didn\u2019t have the\nlanguage. I didn\u2019t know nothing. And my husband has to start out life from the beginning.",

        "Q: I think I told you what it\u2019s like in [Munich]. Life in [Munich] was when you had seen the\npeople, what you thought they already did. And all of us hadn\u2019t yet seen them. Survivors. It\u2019s\nmoment that I think, there Iam. In seventh heaven? Or in another world? Or I\u2019m dreaming.\nYou can\u2019t tell reality. It 1s to describe you moments like that -- the other people thought the\nsame way. Oy, you thought that you are dead. You are alive. I said, Yes, Iam here. It is things\nthat you couldn\u2019t believe. You couldn\u2019t believe and you see some friends -- , that\nthey are still come out from the ghettos, from the concentration camps. You feel like one family.\nThat\u2019s the way you felt when you have met the people from the concentration camps. We were\nlooking at each other and saying, \u201cIs that the truth?\u201d We are still alive. We couldn\u2019t believe our\nown self anymore. And then we used to get together once in a while with some people, you\nknow, whom we knew. They used to be in the -- what you call it -- in other places, just like this.\nIt\u2019s unbelievable. It\u2019s really unbelievable. Tears from happiness that the people are alive. What\nyou used to talking to people. What you used to do in Munich. In Munich, it was only one\nthing. How did you survive? How did you survive in places like that -- like in the concentration\ncamps. No food, lice, no showers, no bread. And that was the main talk, about that. You\ncouldn\u2019t talk about something else, but each time, \u201c\u201cWhat happened to you? How did you\nsurvive? What happened to them?\u201d And everybody used to tell you the biography of the war,\nthe concentration camps, of the life, what they had there. And I know -- we were in the ghettos.\nIt was the same thing, but not so horribly, like in the concentration camps. So fortunately, we\nwere in ghetto. So that was the life in Munich.",

But\nwhen the girls come back, you know, and we were on the train and in Kovno, they used to tell us\neverything. And I know what life was, and 1 know what my life was. So when we were in\nMunich, it\u2019s no idle question. Just to go -- just to talk about the passing time from your life and\nnow to look forward for your future. And we didn\u2019t want to stay anymore in Munich. It was\nenough. I couldn\u2019t. Each day was for me horrible. We used to hear Germans marching and\nback. And sometimes, she used to get in a fight with the Nazis. So the only place it was, to go\nto America.",

He\u2019ll go to Washington, Uncle Bennish (ph), may he rest 1n peace, he went to\nPhiladelphia. And we came to Richmond. And it is a , a life from the beginning.\nSeeing people -- my sister. I didn\u2019t know my aunt. Her name was Bessie. I think I found the\nbiggest diamond in the world -- having a family. I lost my family, as you know. But I found\nanother family. They were so nice to us. They were so good to us. Alright, I didn\u2019t know the\nlanguage. None of us knew the language. But Jay was young, and he picked up the language in\nno time, just like that. You had to see it (ph) to make a living. We were resting for a week. And\nhe said, \u201cYou know, Edna, I wouldn\u2019t go to college back. I wouldn\u2019t study any more law.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cWhy?\u201d He said, \u201cAnd I love law.\u201d He said he had to be born here. You had to learn the\nlanguage fluently. \u201cI cannot take it anymore, to be a lawyer here, and to waste my time and not\nto be successful.\u201d So what had happened, he said, \u201cYou know why? Ithink we goup |\nstation.\u201d I looked at him. He said, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be for long.\u201d So we opened up a\nstation. I couldn\u2019t stay home. The doctor told me to get out from the house because I could lose\nmy mind. I was by myself. And he told him, \u201cTake her out from the house, no matter what it is.\nShe should meet the public, she should meet the people.\u201d And it was true. I met people. I was\nthere in the station. I was pumping gas. I was talking to the people. I do it, all the work, what in\na service station has to be done. And the people didn\u2019t come, you know, for a whole lot gas, like\nten gallons, 15 gallons. They used to come, \u201cOh, two gallons. A dollar, a dollar and eight.\u201d\nAnd you have to do the work that they should come back, you know, to clean the windshields\nand everything. And this is the way that they came in. And they came in and they said, \u201cId like\nto fill up, I think, with gas.\u201d Oh, I said that\u2019s a kind person there. Do you know what I did? I\ndidn\u2019t know how to pump the gas. So instead, to stop the nozzle from the gas -- it shouldn\u2019t go\nin anymore because it was filled up -- I pressed the nozzle, and the gas flewup _\u2014.-~ Well, I\ntold my husband, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not a service operator. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Oh, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d I\nlost a customer. I asked him, you know, with my language at that time, I didn\u2019t know even how\nto say even \u201cthank you.\u201d Used to say, \u201cSank ye, sank ye.\u201d",

The people...\u201d I used to go out, always with a smile, and\ntalk to the people. And I used to cry. All of a sudden, the customer came in -- from the\ncustomers I made good friends -- he said, \u201cMrs. Ipson, did somebody hurt you?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d I said,\n\u201cOh, no. Ihave a cold. And that\u2019s why my tears are running.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to\nhear.\u201d I said, \u201cBut Iam okay.\u201d I wiped up my tears and start smiling. It was alright. Another\nepisode I want to tell you. A yellow cab was not too far from our station. And two insurance\npeople met each other and they observed me, the way I was working. And one said to the other,\n\u201cThat woman doesn\u2019t have no problems whatsoever.\u201d He said, \u201cWhy? Take a look at her,\nalways with a smile, smiles, smiles. If she would have problems, she wouldn\u2019t smile.\u201d The\nother insurance man said, \u201cLet\u2019s betting ten dollars that she got problems, too.\u201d He said,\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s bet in ten dollars, and we\u2019ll go to the lady, we\u2019ll go ask her what problems she\nhave, she doesn\u2019t have.\u201d So they came in and they asked me, \u201cListen, my dear lady.\u201d [He] said,\n\u201cWe'd like to ask you a question.\u201d I said, \u201cIf I be able to answer in English, Pll be glad to\nanswer.\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s not hard.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cDo you have problems?\u201d [He] said, \u201cI\nhave talked to my friend and I told him that you don\u2019t have no problems whatsoever because all\nday long, when I see you with the people just smiling.\u201d I said, \u201cLook, my dear friend, if I would\ntold you my problems, what I had, the biggest tractor trailer wouldn\u2019t take from one corner to the\nother.\u201d The other man said, \u201cTen dollars.\u201d And that\u2019s what I know that they got in. It\u2019s a\nwonderful country. It\u2019s beautiful. People used to ask me, \u201cHow can you say that you are\nhappy?\u201d I said, \u201cI am happy. Do you know what freedom means?\u201d I said, \u201cYou can do\neverything that it please you. It\u2019s a democracy country. You can work, just work. Pay tax. Pay\neverything. It\u2019d be for you and it would bea _\u2014\u2014_\u2014soo ff the government. If you don\u2019t want to\nwork, you don\u2019t pay the tax, you\u2019re in trouble. You don\u2019t have nothing.

        "A: [Slovodka]. The name of the house was [Belionus] and [Dejeu]. [Dejeu] would bear\nthe big [Yeshiva], 1f you know what a [Yeshiva] is. And that was about --even at the _, the\n[Yeshiva] was there. And we used to go, you know, shoot this or something, if you know about the\nother days. looked like the [Yeshiva] boys used to dance and sing and so on. And\nthen, my mother, may she rest in peace, she used to give the boys each a bath twice a week. And\nthey [could eat]. So it means breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

But they were rich, you know.\nIf they were happy, about the \u2014_. _I remember when the one thing that my papa start building the\nsecond floor, I used to go early in the morning -- and we didn\u2019t have the water, like here, but they\nhave a little place they used to carry out the buckets and get the water from about a block away and\nbring home. But no matter what, they were , no matter what, they were before.\nSometimes was maybe hard days, too. But it was a sweet life. Everybody determined. It was\neverybody together. No fights, no rise, no nothing. And then, I had a grandmother, too, with us.\nThat life will never come back. It\u2019s nght, the time is mine, too, but I never can forget. It\u2019s hard to\ndescribe, even in that language that I know so good, it\u2019s hard -- but I think it\u2019s hard to bring out --\nretelling the fear [of the more], the fear for the same thing. It is -- I just couldn\u2019t describe, but I\ndescribe to you one thing about Friday night -- but it was for the Jewish people -- it\u2019s [Labutte].\nBecause it\u2019s Labutte -- everybody got a little house for their self. And Friday night, no matter, you\nreach a middle place [poor people], that Holy [Bible] gave the people life to lead a whole week.\nEven the people who came to [ask], you know, help. You had plenty poor people, but when it came\nFriday night, the candles was light up in the windows. The cakes they were cooking were smelling\nall over. And no matter even -- you know, when the people didn\u2019t have -- they used to [say, \u201cbeing\nin the house,\u201d Hallit].. You know what the [Hallit] is? That they should have for supper, [Hallit],\nbecause that was the main thing, you know. The life of -- the Jewish life, a little -- no\nmatter how many books you can write, it\u2019s hard to describe how beautiful and how lovely it was.\nIt\u2019s so many things to describe about the life in Lithuania -- the holiness, the [Chabas]. My daddy\nused to go to \u2014\u2014_\u2014s, come back from . Everything was prepared. It is unbelievable to\ndescribe to you the happiness that you used to see daddies coming in. The table was set, the\nwas made, and everybody was sitting around the table and eating and enjoy it, the\n[Chabas]. The [CHabas] gave you so much for the whole week. To grow on. And you were\nbrimming again about another Chabas. So that life, no matter what it is, and again, you [have to\ndescribe it], you don\u2019t have, we don\u2019t see. And we will never see it again. Never again. It\u2019s just for\nmy eye I could see . . . candles\u2019 lights, this mirror, the way they were singing, the windows in the\nsummertime was open. It is a life -- I don\u2019t know. I even, I think you need it. I cannot describe the\nbeauty, what it means Friday night at [Chabas]. Everybody used to go, dressed up, [Chabas after],\nyou know, the \u2014_, and they could walk and talking and ~\u2014_\u2014___ each other, and dressed up with\nthe best clothes what they have. But with [Chabas], you used to have -- and it\u2019s quite another\nfeeling. It\u2019s hard, but it was the beauty. The [ Yeshivas], the schools -- you had schools,\nand everything was gone.

        "A: I used to help a whole lot, you know, some people (ph). I didn\u2019t do too much culture, but you\nsee, I used to help a whole lot the Jewish poor people. For instance, if a girl, a poor girl, had a boy,\nafter awhile forgot about it. And the girl didn\u2019t have no home, no nothing, and she find a boy and I\nwant to marry them off (ph), see now, what I did, I took another lady with me and I went, took my\nfriends and I told them about the cake (ph), and I said, \u201cI need help. That girl didn\u2019t have anything.\u201d\nBut you have to have a dowry, you have to have that and so on. And one thing I want to tell you --\nthat it happened to me -- two young girls. And that\u2019s what I helped them to get married. And they\ngot married and they were leading a sweet life until, you know, the war came. I used to help a\nwhole lot people who need some money, you know, to borrow the money to help to get, to buy\nSinger\u2019s (ph) machine. They didn\u2019t have -- they have to have special. I used to help them. I used\nto give them. And then they used to pay me back. So each time, then, if they need some money, I\nwas on the book. I used to help them with that. And then, I -- then what had happened, I couldn\u2019t\ndo anything in life, like culture or so on, because like I said, my husband was -- he finished law and\nthen he started up with the motorcycles, and we have to make a living, too. So I was occupied with\nthe children -- I had another child, too. [Pause] So, I was in the business with my husband. And it\nwas really a life beautiful. Then when the war broke out, I lost a little dear (ph). I had a little dear\n(ph) and I lost him. Well, honey, it\u2019s a whole lot just to think that, it\u2019s a whole lot to talk. I don\u2019t\nknow, I\u2019m jumping from one thing to the other, and I\u2019m not going exactly the way it should be. I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "A: Anti-semitism? It started up about three years before the war. But it wasn\u2019t so big. It was, but it\nwasn\u2019t the way the war start.",
        "A: You see, the problem, what it was in Lithuania, that the Russians came in. And when the\nRussians came in, you see, then it started up a whole lot worse. A whole lot worse because, you\nsee, the Jewish people -- most of the Prolat (ph) people used to go, \u201cOh, oh.\u201d The Russians, they\ngo, \u201cBring us -- I don\u2019t know -- the breath from the sky.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t like that, 1t wasn\u2019t. I'll give\nyou an example. I have an uncle. He had a farm, a big farm. And he was , and among\nthem was a whole lot farmers, farmers. He always used to help them. When they need\nbecause they\u2019re in trouble, or they just need a horse, or they need -- they used to have a cow,\nbecause the little farmers, they was very poor there. And he used to help them because he was very\nbig, had a very big farm. And the farmers knew my mother very well. Of course, she was raised in\nthat farm, and then when she got married, you know, she came to Slovodka (ph). And when the\nfarmer\u2019s people, somebody used to get sick, they used to come to us, and the mother used to help\nthem, to take them to the hospital. She used to cook for them, you know, some food, and take over\nthere. So, with the farmers, was very, very good. And, as I remember, and then later on, I will\ncome, maybe to that point, the way we survived.",
        "A: Yeah, it changed a whole lot. It changed a whole lot. I tell you something -- my husband can\ntell you more than I can tell you -- it changed everything, the whole life. It took the rich people who\nhad, you know, stores and they took him and send him to Siberia. And that was before the war\nstarted up. So the rich people, some of them, they were lucky. They went to America, they went to\nanother place. But here, I could see everything the way it was. The middle-class, didn\u2019t\nbother, but who was in charge in a place like factory people, or you know, the other people, you\nknow, what they had stores, bakeries and so on -- the people went on the first list. And they took\nhim away and they send him to Siberia. I still couldn\u2019t remember what had happened to the\nLithuanian people. I still couldn\u2019t think how people could change -- murders, chilling. When the\nwar broke out, like I told you, the got here and the jail got here. And what had happened\nwithin that time, my husband, he took me and my son and my little girl, and we were running.\nEverybody start running to the RUssians, . We run and they couldn\u2019t reach, they\ncouldn\u2019t see, because the German came here already (ph). So what we have to do? No food, no\nnothing. We turn back home. They come in home. Some Lithuanian people told us, \u201cDon\u2019t go this\nway, go this way.\u201d It\u2019s terrible. They took the Jewish people to the Ninth Fort (ph). They never\ncame back. The children, parents, all the people. , they took the children. They\nkilled them all up there. Fortunately, we were lucky. We took the left , not the right, and\nbecame a home. And when I saw my father -- he was dark complexion -- he was light, like that. In\none night, they killed 200 people, over 200 people. It was , then\nGatvia (ph). And we came back and they told us what had happened. They then took the\nneighbors. The blood on the walls -- some people wrote in Yiddish, \u201cPlease, name Nicole\u201d -- I\ndon\u2019t know how to say it in English. He wrote with the blood of the singer (ph), with big letters. A\nlittle boy from the family, what they knew, he was under the bed. They didn\u2019t see him. He had\nseen what goes on. So that little boy became a life that had to lay there. I just don\u2019t know. It is so\nmany things. So many things. It\u2019s unbelievable. You wouldn\u2019t believe it, and nobody could\nbelieve that people could be such murderers. But murderers -- I judge the same people, the same\npeople who we knew, they used to come to my house and___.._ They asked to help -- the same\nLithuanian people, they slaughtered them. But from one __, from one all the way to the end,\nthey didn\u2019t let . My papa was lucky. He locked windows, you know? And they got up\non the , and it was very quiet. So fortunately, they didn\u2019t murder them. They thought\nnobody\u2019s home. Well, I want to think. Well, then it happened, and the Germans came in. And they\ntook over, you know. Slovodkians (ph), they took, you know Kovno, all Lithuanian. They put us in\nthe ghetto. Our house was on was on -- from the corner from our house, up to the end. I\n_____ made the ghetto, already, that was in August the 15th, I think. Was locked up. You\ncouldn\u2019t take anything with you. They had to leave everything that you had, except, you know, the\nclothes and something else. And we moved into my parents, in their house. And then my husband\u2019s\nfamily, and his sister -- they all were there in the house where we were living. It wasn\u2019t enough\nhome[s] for so many people, I don\u2019t know, 50,000 it was. So we had two ghettos. One was a little\nghetto, and one was the big ghetto. We were in the big ghetto. My husband\u2019s sister, her name was\nDoris, she was married, had a little boy. And she was in the little ghetto. I\u2019m going -- I forgot to\ntell you something. And getting back the way 1 told you we find out -- you know what they did?\nThey took the rabbis. They got in there, they cut off his head and they parade with the rabbi\u2019s head\nin the street. You see, when I am talking, that cannot concentrate. You see, I have to run from one\nto the other. That was terrible. That was murderous --Yet I never thought that the Lithuanian\npeople would do like that. A dog, a cat, got more privacies that a Jew. Well, I'll make short this. . .",
        "A: What we were doing?",
        "A: Oh, that was in ghetto we have to hide ourselves.",
        "A: To getting in the ghetto?",
        "A: Oh, they didn\u2019t do nothing, just tried to get ahead a farmer who used to deliver us milk (ph).\nAnd I prepared him -- I knew already that we have to go, you know, in the ghetto -- that he should\nhelp me to bring some potatoes, flours, maybe, you know, oil, or something else. And that left us\nfor a couple of months to go on with the food. It wasn\u2019t easy because we didn\u2019t have anything to\neat. We couldn\u2019t go out. In , you had to go to work, but even if you go to work, you cannot\nbring in anything. So I have to hide. [ll tell you, when I went to work, I had to slice his bread like\nthat, on my half a loaf. And I was looking which is the best one to go in in the ghetto. So,\nI start looking around here and here. And then he came here to me, the police did, you know? The\nGerman guard. \u201cWhat I have here?\u201d I said, \u201cNothing. Perhaps it got here in your pocket. Oh\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cI got to just slice this bread. You know, you wouldn\u2019t believe it, but please believe me.\u201d He\ntook away from me the bread because I have to help out (ph) Jay. He beat me up like an apple, an\napple (ph). He beat me up, here in the back that for three weeks, I couldn\u2019t sleep on my back. And\nthe next day, I have to go to work. It wasn\u2019t an easy life, but still, I was happy. And I had my\nfamily all together. No matter what he had, even then, they used to tell us, some days it\u2019s a good\nday. You can take being in the ghetto. You know? They used to bring in the food, and then all of a\nsudden, they used to take away from you. And here, it\u2019s no food, hunger. Then I used to go work.\nI used to take some -- I tell you -- I used to go to work, I always, my feeling, Ill go find my little\nboy. By being in ghetto, they burned down the hospital, with the children, with the doctors, with the\nnurse, across from the place where we used to live, and there\u2019s a site. They used to take the children\nfrom the windows, the little babies, and threw them on the ground.",
        "A: Not mine.",
        "A: Oh yes, it was not -- it was across from my old place. I was there. Not in the hospital. And they\nburned up the children.",
        "A: I tell you something, that\u2019s what they said. It\u2019s hard for me because I\u2019m coming back. [Pause] I\ndon\u2019t know where I was.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: [have to go to work.",
        "A: What kind of work. Digging trenches until I was up to here. If you didn\u2019t finish, they would beat\nyou up. They used to give you a special amount, so much and so much. You have to do it. That\nwasn\u2019t . It was, I think, more people. You used to have good brigades, and you used to\nhave bad ones. A good brigade means that you would go out and you would shop, you know, to get\na package. The bad ones used to be, like, big, old. And one day, I went to work. And we were\nstanding, we were shoveling, you know, sand and mud. They were building a bridge. And we were\nstanding and we were talking. said, \u201cOh, I wish I would have a before\n.\u2019 T said, \u201cWell, I wish we could have Chabas (ph) to feast.\u201d\u201d You know, we were talking.\nWe didn\u2019t talk about anything else. But just to have something that we used to have before the war.\nAnd by talking like that, the German guard got in, and I was standing with the shovel and I didn\u2019t\nwork because we were talking. He hit me with his rifle over my head. I don\u2019t know how many\nstitches I had. I came bleeded up. And then I went, and they took me right away back to the ghetto.\nANd I came to the and the doctor gave me -- they put in some stitches -- they got out the\nhair and put me some stitches and bandaged up my head and the next day I had to go to work. I\nhave to work every single day. Four o\u2019clock in the morning, and then come back 5:00. Back home.\nMy heart, about my little boy, because we used to say, \u201cThey get in and they get us and take away\nthe children.\u201d So, you know, I\u2019m awful sad. I bet it was. But now, I have something to tell you.\nThey got in in the ghetto -- that was August, I think, the 15th or the 20th, I couldn\u2019t remember. In\nSeptember, we had Rosh Hosanna. A day before that, they took out 20 -- 2,000 people to go to the\n, you know. And there was my father, my husband and my older brother. And between\n4:30 and 5:00 -- do you know what it means? -- \u201cGod\u2019s all over the ghetto.\u201d They got\nin and they said, \u201cGet out.\u201d I said, \u201cWhere?\u201d He said, \u201cDo you see all the people here? Go with the\npeople together. Save us little.\u201d It was a nice -- it wasn\u2019t too cold, but you know, in Europe, the\nweather is a little different. And I said, \u201cWait a moment. Let me take for my boy his clothes, his\nlittle coat.\u201d He said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need. He will have there enough.\u201d I had a feeling something is\nwrong. And I had my grandmother and my mother, my sister, Jay, myself, and we have to go for\n. And __ was gone way, way -- hardly could see my --- and I knew, it is a\nselection. Because it was about 5,000 people in that area where we were -- was over 5,000 people.\nI was working. I couldn\u2019t say anything that they said only one thing. \u201c \u00bb God,\nplease, we are poor. Let them help us (ph).\u201d Then they came, big field for us (ph). And everybody\nhas to go forth, in aline. And we get there, to that place -- our neighbors, I see the doctor, the nurse,\nthere. . [knew them. They was ahead of me. ANd I\u2019d seen that if somebody said, \u201cHe\u2019s\na doctor, he\u2019s a nurse, he\u2019s a bookkeeper, he\u2019s from the higher educated people,\u201d left. I said,\n\u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d It\u2019s come by-and-by, asked my name, what I got here. So, I told him about\n. \u201cMy husband, my father and my brother went to the airport. They are\nautomechanics.\u201d And I said, \u201cWe left over.\u201d And he said, . So I told him, \u201cI am a\ndressmaker.\u201d But I was young, I was strong, I wasn\u2019t in tear. He said, . So, to the right\nside. To the right side, I knew that we are alive. The next morning, my father, shall he rest in peace,\nand my husband and my brother said that they already knew of the airport, but it was going good.\nANd he said, \u201cIF they are not here,\u201d he said my life is not anymore. That moment -- it \u2018s hard to\ndescribe, it\u2019s hard to describe -- There you see all the 50 people they took, I think, out of our 2,000,\nand killed them, all of them. At random, like dogs (ph). That was 1941.",
        "A: How? People used to come and tell us. People used to come and tell us this big, big -- how do\nyou Say it, .",
        "A: There are people dying to know, there was a . Let\u2019s see, it was a whole lot made out\nwhen they got to the people -- the people have to do their own. And then, they used to kill them.\nAnd add them for the , while they just said to him, \u201cOver my dead body, you go get, you\nknow, my coat.\u201d So, she got trapped anyhow, no matter what it is. And people used to tell us, and\npeople -- not everybody got killed, but some people were still alive and the earth was just ;\nlike that. And who told us? It was some from Lithuanian people, some neighbors, once in a while\nused to come in and to tell us that they\u2019d taken so-and-so. And that\u2019s called the Ninth Port, where\nall the Germans -- even from Germany -- came in -- the boat from German people there. And they\nwas going there, too, and they killed them, all of them. Honey, it\u2019s -- what can I tell you? It was\nhorrible. It was... I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know reason why -- if that would happen right now, I\nreally wasn\u2019t able to make it.

        "A: No, uh-uh. The men used to go separate and I used to go separate.",
        "A: Yeah, well. That\u2019s the way. And when I used to come back to the ghetto, I didn\u2019t know, and I'd\ngo see my little bby ~~~. ~AndI\u2019d go see the people. And you see, that was the first selection,\nbut it was __, that 1s what Rosh Hosanna. And my husband was working in the airport. He\nmet there a farmer. All the farmers used to come and help to build the airport, you know, sand and\nstonesand \u2014\u2014_s everything. My husband start talking to him, and he asked him if he knew a man\nwho got a brother, his name was Itsak Kolinitzki (ph). \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cYes, I do know him. He\u2019s\nstill alive.

I took all of the \u2014\u2014.:~: I looked like a , | didn\u2019t\nlook like Jewish. And I was going there to the people, and the people they were nice and -- like I\nsaid, some people, they were good. And I come to that farmer. And when I come to that farmer,\nthat\u2019s the way I got in contact with my uncle, with my uncle the farmer (ph), because his farm was\nransacked, and of course, was the other -- Julius was his name. I then got the -- how did he survive?\nI don\u2019t know. I lost contact to him. Then they had the big selection.",
        "A: In October, I think the 20 or the 28th. It was bitter cold. And things got -- we survived, you\nknow. But they took out close to 10,000 people, and the people got killed.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: The way it was? Well, you see -- my family was with us, together. And my husband , who\nspoke fluently German, and he talk to him. And when he talk to him and explained to him, what is\nhis , what is his occupation, so he told him that he\u2019s a mechanic -- he was a mechanic like I\nam right now a mechanic. So, you see, the working people, like tailor, shoemakers, all different\nkind of people, you know, but they have an occupation, you know? So, once they find out that you\nare a mechanic, you are on the top, they wouldn\u2019t bother you, they know that you are good.

When my\nhusband told them that he\u2019s a mechanic, and he\u2019s working, [Pause] -- When he told him that he\u2019s a\nmechanic, he told him to go right, so my parents survived, and we survived.",
        "A: That wasn\u2019t so easy, hon. If you didn\u2019t go to work, they had the Jewish police. The Jewish\npolice, when there was missing people, they would go on a hunt and see where the people are. I\nwas arrested. I didn\u2019t go to work, I don\u2019t know what had happened. Jay didn\u2019t feel good or\nsomething, and my sister-in-law, her name was Goldie, she didn\u2019t go to work either. So what they\ndid, they took us -- they took us in jail. And we fight with them. And people whom the police\n_____ knew saw we fight with them, so we stopped fighting, so they took us to the police. When\n______were released, my husband came from work and so he start telling the head man, he then\ntook all over (ph), and then they released us. It\u2019s so many things to say.\nTape 2",
        "A: Oh, that. We used to get up in the morning, 4:00 in the morning. Had a cup of coffee. Had to\nmake coffee, you know I -- You didn\u2019t have anything, no wood, no nothing, so you used to take a\nbig nail, a heavy one, put it into the electricity, and have a little -- something, you know, like a jar --\nand you put it in in the jar, and the water was boiling and you didn\u2019t have coffee, but , we\nused to call it. It is just like something -- and we used to have in the morning, before we went, to\nhave that, and a tiny little slice bread, and go to work. Sometimes we didn\u2019t have the bread. So, at\nleast to have warm inside. And I used to go out, I used to see the Bad (ph) Brigade, but you can\u2019t\nget because there was a whole lot people, but I knew them. But fortunately, I used to be lucky.\nFortunately, they used to pull me out from the Good brigade, and take me to the Bad brigade. What\nmeans a Good brigade? A Good brigade means you can work hard, it\u2019s no different. What it is,\nyou are young, you are healthy, and then you take something to run in, around the people there\nbecause ___ uSed to be, and sell them something -- like a sleep, a place (ph), a something,\nwhatever you had. And for that, you used to get some food. So at least -- or used to have some\nbread. Butter? We didn\u2019t know what it means, butter. No butter, no milk, no nothing. But at least,\nwhen you had the bread, you see, the coffee, like I explained to you, it\u2019s okay, you can make it.\nWho knew what it means, meat? Nothing. You didn\u2019t have nothing. But potatoes was very good,\nyou know. A potato you can mix up with something else or you have to have. And you make\nsomething, add meal from that (ph). I remember one time, that they said you can bring in food.\nWell, the Good brigade -- when you used to have -- I used to take off my Star of David. I looked\nlike a . And I was gone from one place, from one door to the other. Until, you know, they\nused to give us something. Some people said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any,\u201d but they just potato\npeels. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, too.\u201d I used to take potato peels.

        "A: Terrible, terrible. They used to send you in jail. That -- you were lucky. If they send you to jail.\nBut some was good for me, you know, who was the brigade commanders (ph), you know, with the\nGerman guards. There was already good ones who let you go to do -- some of them was murderers.\nThey didn\u2019t. If they had caught you -- it didn\u2019t hurt me so much the way they beat me up for the\nbread -- I didn\u2019t kill the pain, but I killed the pain for the hunger, to be hungry. For not having, but\nfor taking away the bread from me. You see what I mean? You didn\u2019t kill no pain. But pain was\nhunger, no food to eat. Starving. So when we used to go the brigade, we used to have a Good\nbrigade, so at least you used to get some clothes to change for food. So, when I used to come to the\nChristians there that knew me already, so they used to give me something to eat, a slice bread, it was\nokay, with some water.",
        "A: Hmm-mm. The Christians?",
        "A: Well, I used to come back -- they didn\u2019t give you for free.

They didn\u2019t take away. They took away\nfrom you the books, the paintings, the grand things. But clothes, as much as you could, you could\ntake it in. The furniture, everything, you have to give. So you see? So when you used to have\nsomething to change, why not? They used to give you, you know? So they used to have a\n, you see. It means that you used to have a good day with the food, but what you got,\nyou are happy. I was running, smiling, I have something. But the worst thing was if you came to\nthe ghetto, to the brigade, you know. So, if you had a good brigade, then you go through. If you\nhave Bad brigade, you\u2019re in trouble.",

But it didn\u2019t, like I said, it didn\u2019t bother me, it didn\u2019t hurt me, you know, the\nway I was beated up, but it hurt me why I lost the bread. It\u2019s rich people, known people, in\nLithuania, they didn\u2019t have nothing to eat. My husband -- he\u2019ll tell you tomorrow about it -- the\nway we used to help them -- from the same, what we had, you split in half -- half for us and half for\nthem. And... I was young, I was strong, it was in the family. She lost a husband, she was with a\n______, with her father and mother and I remember a young girl, a lady. She was married and her\nhusband got killed. I think by the 550 people.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: Yeah. The 550 people. It was across from our house. And my husband wasn\u2019t there, and I was\nrunning to look for him that he shouldn\u2019t come home. And all -- a whole lot friends, educated\npeople -- they asked just for the educated people because they had to find out and -- |\ndon\u2019t know how to say in English, but that\u2019s okay, you can find out. So, everybody, just for two\ndays\u2019 walk, or three days\u2019 walk, so they was exactly across from our house. And there was about\n550 young people. And they took all the people and killed them. Believe it. Five hundred and fifty\ncareer __. Friends of friends, lawyers, doctors . . . it was unbelievable. People couldn\u2019t believe\nthat that could happen. And in two days, it was finished.

        "A: That it happened when we got in and the ghetto, was August, the 20, I think. And that had\nhappened before -- in a week, or two weeks later, when we got in in the ghetto.

See, that\u2019s why I could go to work, because I know he\u2019s in good hands. But still, the fear --\nbecause we used say in the other little cities, you know? -- they used to kill the children and take\nthem away from the parents, and so on. So as long as I had my mother, my father, I was strong.\nBut the fear inside I had . . . if I had come home, I hope I could find my little boy.",
        "A: To my little girl? She died. She died before I got in the ghetto.",
        "A: Yes. She was only four months old. And the way we were running and coming back, the way I\ntold you before? And it was no help from doctors and so on and so she passed away. During in the\nghetto, a lifetime, I used to run -- I used to get orders from the farmers, from the Christian people,\nwhat they need. \u201cCan you bring me so-and-so? I'll have for you a nice package.\u201d I used to run in\nthe ghetto, look at somebody had something, what they ask. And I used to ask him, how much does\nhe want? And he used to tell me the price, how much they want to have. I used to go there to the\npeople, the Christian people, who order, and I used to get, you know, a package or money, whatever\nitis. But the main thing it is that they want to have, you know -- food. So, it wasn\u2019t too hard to run\nand to go and to sell it to the people and bring for the people who needs the food. And now we had\nenough food for a couple days, probably, enough bread and so on. I stopped talking about the\nfamily, you know. But she had her parents, and she went herself. Her name was Bergma, Celia\n(ph). No food, no clothes, no -- even no water. So one day, they said that you can take in some\nwood, in the ghetto. You know what I did? I brought her -- you know, the wood -- and I gave to\nher and I told her (ph), go ahead, you go have hot water, you can have something to cook on. It\nwas a risk to go out. It was really a risk. You think that the -- the Christian people, they used to say,\n\u2018Please try to be careful. Try to be careful because you never know what can happen to you.\u201d But\nwhen hunger -- when you\u2019re hungry, you don\u2019t have nothing to heed. Nothing can stop you. I\ndidn\u2019t care. Let them shoot me. Let them kill me. As long I am alive, I'll try to have something,\nthe main thing was, you see, my Jay. It wasn\u2019t easy. But the hardest thing in the world was for me\nwhen I lost my people.",
        "A: Well, nothing hard when I had my people -- my parents, my brothers, my sister. And in ten\nminutes, I lost them, in ten minutes. They had to have some people for _\u2014_, for Estonia. I don\u2019t\nknow how many people -- 500 or 600 people. I find out later, instead, they should go and get one\nperson, they said, the singles (ph). It would take them a whole lot to get the people, so they took\nbigger families. So, what they did, they took my family. Five people in ten minutes. Right before I\ntear them out of my arms, they was already gone. [Crying] I couldn\u2019t do nothing. I couldn\u2019t do not\na thing because the police and the German guards, and I didn\u2019t thought that that could happen to\nthem. It was about ten or eleven o\u2019clock in the morning. Since then, I didn\u2019t see them anymore.\nMy last -- please forgive me, I\u2019m sorry. But do you know what it means to lose your family in ten\nminutes? I never could forget. And I shall never forget. At night, you cannot sleep, you\u2019ve got the\ndreams. It\u2019s awful. It\u2019s awful, it\u2019s painful.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: In October of 1943. Between that time, there was a city with the name Shabut (ph), and there\nwas a number of Jewish people. And the people of Shabut (ph), that was, at that time, from October\nuntil December. They took the children from the parents out there. And somebody came to tell us\nthat the children from Shabut (ph) had been taken away from the parents. Children, little ones, until\nup to 12 years. Twelve years, they can still go on at the work \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014. - So I said to my husband,\nwhat he should do, before I find out about the farmer, that my uncle is still alive. I got in contact\nwith the farmer, Martinez (ph), that was his name. ANd, like I told you, my uncle used to help them\na whole lot. So, they want to pay back to him, to help him. He was out in 82 places doing things.\nEighty-two places. The only thing that it was to get in contact 1s somebody had to contact them that\nwe should survive if it was with Jay, or maybe to send Jay alone. I finally got in contact with that\nJultus Schmitt (ph), with him that was his neighbor. And I used to send him some medicine, too.\nAnd then I used to send for him, for the farmer, he wants a suit I used to bring him, a suit. I used to\nrun away, like I told you. I used to make my work, my work is finished, then I used to take off my\nStar of David, and used to run. I used to go. There was a coal brigade. There was, not too far from\nthe coal brigade, a neighbor. And that man used to come to that neighbor. They knew each other.\nSo when I got in over there, I used to find him. When I found him, first I have to finish my work.\nFour women has to finish to shovel the coal from the -- what you call it? -- train. So they used to\nhave -- oy, like a choo choo train. So when I finish my work, and everything already finished, they\ndidn\u2019t bother you, as long you finished at the coal brigade (ph). Then I went with him and I got in\ncontact with him. And I told him about the baby. And I said, \u201cPlease, immediately, try to get my\nuncle and tell him about the teddy (ph). And please, he should help us to get out from the ghetto.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the way I got in contact with my uncle. And I was in the brigade. And then, I had a nice,\ngood package. He brought me some -- like, eggs, and he got a few pieces of butter, and bread, and\nflour. And when I got that, it was already late. The coal brigade was already gone. And I was left\nover by myself. Now, what should Ido? Where shouldI _? It\u2019s no place. No place where to\ngo and what to do. I was fortunately lucky. It was there go slow (ph), you know -- what you call it?\nIt was a brigade, but they used to make -- go slow, allthe \u2014\u2014_, and they used to take up from the\ngarden.",
        "A: Right. So that brigade was the latest. And fortunately, I was lucky that somebody told me you\ngot one more brigade coming. And that brigade, when I said, \u201cSee me,\u201d they grabbed me right\naway and they brought me in the ghetto. And I came to safety. It happened there at the coal\nbrigade, was easy to make a Pekel (ph), they way they said, you know, a package. So it was a good\nday. Everybody from the women that finished. And some people used to know already that some\npeople got clothes or something, you know. They made some packages -- good for us (ph).And all\nof a sudden, the guard from Gestapo came in to see what\u2019s going on by the coal brigade. Had seen\ntheir packages. And he asked, \u201cWhose package is this one?\u201d One girl got up and she said, \u201cIt\u2019s\nmine.\u201d She said, \u201cTake the package.\u201d \u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014. Who she did, nobody knows. I had seen what had\nhappened to her, so I already run away. I didn\u2019t look to him. And that arrogant Gestapo, what\nhappened to her. I just don\u2019t know. Because why? She had a package. That was wrong. That was\nwrong. The life in ghetto is worse than a dog in the street. Four o\u2019clock in the morning, they used\n. They used to call up to get dressed and get out and take them in a special place, special\nfield. Cold, bitter cold, to test what the people gonna do. Having my little boy, before you dressed\nhim -- here you couldn\u2019t see here in the clothes. I used to put up everything in his little bed that he\nused to be -- put up everything that in the morning, if it should rain, I should have right away for\nhim, to dress him, and to be outside. How many people have there been -- in there room? No, less\nthan that -- eight -- I think about eighteen or nineteen, maybe more. People there were sleeping on\nthe floors. There was no beds, no sofas. But at least we had a pillow. And we had, you know, a\n, whatever. It\u2019s -- who can describe the horrible things in the ghettos. No ink can write, no\nwriter can write up what we had to do during the three years. But one thing that 1t was to me, as I\ntold you, that was my people there.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The holidays?",
        "A: Yeah, we used to have the holidays. But each holiday, when it used to come, the Gestapo gave\nyou right away a holiday -- taking people, sending them to the Ninth Fort, to kill the people there, to\ntake off their bodies from the . . . from the caves. We never had a holiday that we should enjoy.\nBecause each holiday, when it used to come, always used to be bitter because they used -- they\nalways gave you such a rough time. Used to take our peoples, they used to kill the people, they\nused to hang the people. Honey, I cannot tell you, just in the three hours, what they did. Before they\nwent to the airport, they took 2,000 people -- and it was Rosh Hosanna -- and some people didn\u2019t\nwant to go because it was the holidays. And what do you think they did? They killed them. They\nkilled them to show them that you must go to work, it\u2019s no holidays. So you asked me about\nholidays -- each holiday, no matter what, when used to come, always was bitter, full with tears, full\nof fear, full of pain. You cannot describe, even in Yiddish, which I know so good, I wouldn\u2019t be\nable to describe it. But I went through, and so many people went through. But, I was fortunately\nlucky. Iam alive. There have been other people -- no more.",
        "A: I think the children -- activities there was, but for the children, they used to have school. That\u2019s\nwhat they had, but they didn\u2019t know. It was all secretly, you see? But they used to have for the\nchildren a school. And it was teachers, and that was, but they didn\u2019t know. The Gestapo didn\u2019t\nknow. But we had activities -- I don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t know. Because you see, I was a slave. I\nwas a Slave. I used to go out in the morning, come back, see everybody\u2019s okay. Tired. Thinking\nwhat tomorrow will be. Will you have to get up early in the morning -- 4:00. So, I don\u2019t know too\nmuch about the activities, I\u2019m honest with you. But I know that they have a school for the children.\nAnd then, it wasn\u2019t too many. It was already each time, each quarter of the year, like three months,\nsix months. Each time something had happened and they had an excuse. Something had happened\nand they used to take out. That happened, that sort of thing happened. (ph)",
        "A: Yeah, inside the ghetto was the workshop, too. And some of them were going outside, and the --\nbut not everybody was lucky to get in there, you know? It wasn\u2019t a whole lot people. I don\u2019t know,\nI\u2019ve never been there. Because like I said, I was beating with myself, running here and there. But it\nwas -- they used to make for the shoulders, you know, like gloves and socks and all different things,\nyou know, there. In Europe, used to be very cold. And more things, you know, for the Gestapo.\nThey used to come and want this suit, or a uniform to make and so on. THey used to tell them to\nmake it. And that way we survived, because the workmanship, the working people. And that the\nway I survived because I told them that I am not a saleslady, not that, but I am a dressmaker.",
        "A: No, the Jewish people inside. The Gestapo was outside. The Gestapo had __, like -- how do\nyou Say it -- the Gestapo didn\u2019t come near to the ghetto, but they had their own building. And when\nit used to come to selection, the first thing was the Gestapo.",
        "A: The Gestapo used to come in the ghetto, oh yeah. They used to come into the ghetto. I\nremember one thing that had happened with a man. I couldn\u2019t remember too close, but my Jay will\nremember -- the way they hang some two people or more. And they took out all the people who\nwas inside, that they should come and see the way it happened.",
        "A: The unirat (ph).",
        "A: Oh, yeah. I know. I know that . We all participated (ph). Tova [ph}? He studied with\nmy husband, together. He was in the unirat (ph). And then was , Dr. Gerschon (ph). He\nwas from Shabut (ph) and he came here because he got married, for a girl, you know, who\u2019s from\nKovno. And then more people -- they was very active. And they came in, you know, when it was\nthe big selection, the 10,000 people, like I told you. They asked, Gestapo asked -- Dr. Elkis (ph)\nwas a famous doctor in. -~They want to have so many, so many people. And Dr. Elkis (ph)\nsaid, \u201cI will not give you, I will not select people. Go ahead and do by yourself. So when we got\nout, it was in October 28th, I think, in the big field. And then you have to have luck -- who\u2019s alive\nand who\u2019s dead. And then they took out close to 10,000 people and they killed them, all of them. I\nthink -- I don\u2019t know -- one survived, but I know that all of them got killed because they didn\u2019t let\nnobody stay at home, and everybody has to go out. And Dr. Elkis (ph) didn\u2019t want to have on his\nconscience that here, that is your life, and that 1s your dead. And then the unirat, you know, they\nused to have some trouble there. But they used to do something for them -- they gave them a year\n(ph), a present, or something, I don\u2019t know. The people trouble as they was in Gestapo, you know,\nbut you go into the Gestapo, it is good-bye. You are not coming back to the ghetto, you are not\ncoming back alive. So we used to help them. There was -- I forgot, I tell you. It\u2019s\nalready 50 years away. And you cannot remember. And my memory is not anymore what it used\nto be before.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: They were Lithuanian.",
        "A: In the unirat (ph)?",
        "A: Oh, well, you know. It was a hard job, but it -- I don\u2019t want to say anything else. They were\nrough. The police was rough. The Jewish police was very rough. It was hard. I want to tell you\none more thing -- the way I got with my uncle. The day we run away from the ghetto --",
        "A: Well, listen, for somebody, they were good. For somebody they were bad. You have to have\nvitamin tea, you know what it means? For . If you didn\u2019t have yellows, if you had yellow\ntea -- say, you have bad people and they are rough to...",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t follow.",
        "A: Oh, in prison.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Jewish police. I beat him up, too. And they took me in jail, my sister-in-law and myself. And I\nwas working every single day. Every single day I was working. Get up early in the morning -- rain,\ncold, snow. No matter what it is, you have to go.",
        "A: The unirat was in charge for the Gestapo. You see, the unirat, they used to lead, like a\ngovernment. And they used to get orders. They used to know when there came up a selection.\nThey used to be the first ones to find out. And that\u2019s what it was. And if something was wrong,\nthey used to call the police. The police was rough, tough. Very rough. Some of them were...",
        "A: No. They never did. But I know -- well, the last action, what it was, a selection, the last one.\nNobody knew. Because they were so good that they said, \u201cYou can take in food, as much as you\ncan.\u201d They allowed you to bring in food. And by getting the food, I had a funny feeling, because\neach time, when they used to say, \u201cYou can bring food in the ghetto,\u201d Not to be afraid, you know,\nbut they come to help (ph). In the next two days or three days, a selection. And that\u2019s what I\nremember -- that when I had food brought, heavier than I was -- a pekel (ph), the way we used to\nsay it -- and I said to myself, I hope everything will be okay. And in the next two days, it was\nselection. So there was, you know, like a government in ghetto. ANd in charge was Dr. Elkis (ph),\na . Like I told you, and the few of them, what I know. But nothing could help you. Just\nyou have to find out for yourself what you can do.",
        "A: I think it was mostly the same thing. The women . And for the men, they used to\ntake him, you know, to hard labor, different things to do. But for the women, the same thing, no\ndifferent. No difference. I used to do all the hard work, all the hard work. That was my --like I said\n-- my luck. When I used to have a good brigade, they used to push me out. You don\u2019t know what it\nused to be in the morning, on a big field, and to have the brigades, one goes to here, and one goes\nthere. And all of a sudden, you got in in the good brigade, they pulled you out. And how many\ntimes I was beated up from the police.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t care for the children. You see, if they lost their husband, and she was by herself\nwith a child, they didn\u2019t bother her. But who\u2019s with a family, you have to go to work.",
        "A: Oh, yes, indeed.",
        "A: Many people got pregnant and they had to make abortion. And it had to be quiet. Nobody\nshould know. Because if they go find something, you get killed. Like, they took away in 19-- when\nthey got into the ghetto, that was I think in September. And all the frills, what you had -- all the\ngold and silver and diamonds -- should be turned in to the Gestapo. If one -- if they go find out that\none didn\u2019t turn in, ten families from the family where you are will be killed. And you know what\nmy father did? My mother, as they got, you know, some fears (ph), he took apart and he wound it\nup -- and they didn\u2019t kill them. I had my purse I gave away, too, to that to the -- like I told you, to\ngood Christians. But then they changed. They changed. They wasn\u2019t the same anymore. If you\nwent there to get the clothes, you know what they did? They killed you. They killed you after the\nLiberation. And they told me I shouldn\u2019t go and ask for the clothes because you'll get killed. I said,\n\u201cWell, Hitler didn\u2019t kill me, to heck with them.\u201d",
        "A: Oh, there was underground people, too.",
        "A: Some of them I already did, you know, like the partisan (ph). And the last one, whom I knew,\nhe\u2019s already dead.",
        "A: At the time, I tell you, I knew that they exist -- a partisan group. But I wasn\u2019t there. I wasn\u2019t\ninvolved. My husband wasn\u2019t involved. Because at that time, I had my people, and I had my\nfamily. You see, Jay, myself, and... but after Liberation, then was time to talk. YOu could talk.\nBecause you were afraid of your own shadow, that somebody should know or not. Darling, I tell\nyou something. It is so much, so much. I didn\u2019t finish. I want to tell you another thing. You\nfinished with the ghetto?",
        "A: Pll go to my uncle. We got Jay, my husband and myself. We got already that man who came to\npick us up and to take us in -- 1t was about 60 or 70 kilometers -- 100 kilometers from\nthat place where my uncle was.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I want to tell you. So, and a month later, when I lost my people, they told us that\nthey . They took the children away from the mothers. And we didn\u2019t know when to save\nJay\u2019s life. I didn\u2019t care for myself. And \u2014__, he said, \u201cEdna, what happen to Jay will happen to\nus. If Jay\u2019s gone, all of us will go. Don\u2019t look for some other places where to leave him.\u201d So then\nhe give me a push to go see my uncle again. And when they came already to that point, the way\nthey were talking and everything was set up, we cut the wires -- -- and Jay walked out\nfirst. And he went across the street there, and we told Jay, \u201cHere and here,\u201d and it was gone. Here\nand here in that place. We\u2019ll be there in another half hour, maybe. Please don\u2019t call, don\u2019t scream,\ndon\u2019t say anything. Jay was waiting there for us -- there was another man who will pick us up. It\ntook us about a half hour to go out on the wires. And you have to watch the guard. When the guard\nwas away, and everything was quiet, we got through the wires, and we came to where Jay was. And\nthat man,his name was Martinez (ph). And he took us there where my uncle was. What I did, I\ntook Martinez (ph) a jacket. You know, he scout (ph). Igaveitto \u2014\u2014_, to my husband, and his I\ngave to Martinez (ph) because he is a Prussian (ph). And if he didn\u2019t look like a Jewish person, and\nwhen we were driving, we took Jay in that wagon. On top of that, we put up straw that you\nshouldn\u2019t see that the child is there. And I had -- from a Christian, I had somebody years ago, a\nlittle jacket, you know, a little coat, and put on a scarf, and both of us looked like Prussian (ph)\npeople, like farmers. And sure enough, we drove up. It was about 30 miles from Kovno. And they\nstopped us. My heart was beating. And I said, that is the end. And what had happened, he said,\n\u201cHave you got eggs for sale? Have you got something else for sale?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d That man,\nMartinez (ph), himself, he said, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t have anything for sale.\u201d \u201cOh, well, good-bye.\u201d But\nthat was a lucky moment. Finally, where should we go? So that farmer was very nice and he took\nus in to his house -- raining, cold, you know. We came in. He didn\u2019t took us right away to his\nhouse, but he took us to his brother-in-law\u2019s house. And Jay was there under the straw, and all of a\nsudden, he starts saying, \u201cMama, Daddy -- Mama, Daddy.\u201d And the farmer, his brother-in-law said,\n\u201cWhat do I hear? I hear a voice.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cGo away. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking\nabout.\u201d Lucky number again. And we brought there, then we came to his house. We came to his\nhouse and was there for 39 days. The time was up. We find out that some people -- a lawyer from\na ghetto -- it means my uncle\u2019s nephew is here hiding. He told us we have to go and not delay\nbecause we are in trouble. Gestapo, you know, the police, you know from over there -- the German\npolice -- they was looking for the people. And there was, across from them, somebody left a little\nboy or a girl, to hide them. They killed him. It\u2019s so many things, I tell you. It happened so fast,\nwhere to start. And then, we came to his house. And by going back, to another farmer, he said,\n\u201cPlease, get in, all of us, in one place.\u201d Like this. ANd we looked, a big storm. And we heard not a\nfire from that place. The Germans was running to look around. And we were sitting there for an\nhour. Cold, bitter cold, just like that. That it shouldn\u2019t look like we are Jewish people. That, see,\nthat we are hiding. And they didn\u2019t find us. That was another lucky number.",
        "A: It\u2019s finished. It\u2019s 4:00.\nTape 3",
        "A: For nine months.",
        "A: Oh, no. You have to move. Right now, I\u2019m coming -- can I say?",
        "A: So then, he told us, he said, \u201cGet all together in one place, that it should look like a big rock.\u201d\nHe himself, I shall never forget, got down on the ground, and lay down and he said, \u201cThey are\ncoming.\u201d It means the German police -- I don\u2019t know who it was. After everything was over, he\nsaid to me, \u201cYou know, where should I take you?\u201d I told him, \u201cYou know? Take me to\nPashkovski (ph).\u201d He said, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll take you there. But say anything to them that I brought\nyou.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He brought us there and he was waiting until we go inside. We got in\nthere and knocked on the door. The dogs was barking and barking and barking and barking and I\ndidn\u2019t know what it was. And I knocked on the door. He got back. He got scared when he\u2019s up\nseeing me (ph). I said, \u201cDon\u2019t get scared. Do you know Heika (ph)?\u201d That\u2019s the way they used\nto call her. \u201cYes.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m Heika\u2019s (ph) daughter.\u201d \u201cHow did you come here?\u201d I said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know when I used to be a little girl, I used to come here and we got, you know, some\nfish, and we go fishing and so on?\u201d \u201cOh, yeah. So what you hear? How did you come? How\ndid you know?\u201d I said, \u201cI know the place very good. I could come and I could go.\u201d \u201cWho\nbrought you here? What you got here?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I have a person who took me here, not to\nyour place. But I knew exactly which way to go -- to the right, or to the left, or so on.\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cPlease let me in.\u201d He looked at me and he said, \u201cOkay, go in. You are sure nobody\nbrought you here?\u201d I said, \u201cIf somebody would\u2019ve brought me here, I would have told you.\u201d\nBUt I told him to remind him, \u201cYou don\u2019t remember me, but you remember my mother. Do you\nremember when -- Mrs. Preskovski (ph) -- when she worked there, in hospital, you know, my\nmother, the way I told you, my mother used to cook and come to be with them and give them\nsome food and so on.\u201d He said, \u201cYes, it\u2019s true.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou used to come to our house\nwith the horses and buggy.\u201d He said, \u201cYes. Ah-ha. So you are Heika\u2019s (ph) daughter.\u201d I said,\n\u201cYes. And that is my husband. And that is my son.\u201d I said, \u201cPlease let me in for a couple days\nuntil I get in contact with my uncle.\u201d And my uncle told all the farmers where he is and where\nhe is located -- not all of them, but a few of them., like that Martinez (ph). He knew everything.\nAnd he said, \u201cLet me tell you something\u201d -- All to the farmers .. . \u201cIf you want to get me out,\u201d\nhe said, \u201clet me tell you one thing. Not one of you will be left alive.\u201d Because it was not\nallowed to keep Jewish people. So he was in 82 places. Each time in another place, each time.\nThe way people running from one place to the other. So, when it happened, that case. And he\nlet us stay until -- I think six days or seven. And he starts looking around, why the dogs was\nbarking. Why the dogs was barking. Something was wrong in their house. He said, \u201cI cannot\nkeep you anymore.\u201d I said, \u201cPut us in the potatoes bin,\u201d you know, where the yeast is. Nothing\ndoing. He got in contact with my uncle. And my uncle took us to another place. To .\nAnd by working over there, we were working -- I don\u2019t know, a good while -- until we came to\nthat farm. And poor farmer, very poor farmer, but very good people. Very good people. They\nshare with us whatever they had. And my uncle used to come every week and to bring us some\nbread, milk for my -- for Jay. And so on, because they didn\u2019t have anything. They didn\u2019t have a\ncow. They got only one pig, or two, and two sheeps. When we came there, my uncle came. And\nhe said, \u201cHere is that place. Try to be as long as you can.\u201d And the farmers, already, was afraid,\nthat in case somebody will give him out. So all the farmers will get killed. So they were\nwatching already. You see, they was watching -- they was watching him that nobody should\ngive him out, in case or now they\u2019re all in trouble. He came over there. And my uncle used to\ncome there. But we have to have a hiding place. Because we heard that, you see, the Germans\nare losing. And that, to make a hiding place to be was impossible. And what had happened,\nthere was two potato pits. And my husband made out a grave, and he made a tunnel to go in\nfrom one to the other. And it was no air to breathe. He made just a little bitty hole, that even\nyou couldn\u2019t match up a light, a match to light up. We were there for nine months. The rest of\nmy tale is the truth. Whatever had happened with my husband, he can tell you tomorrow. I fear\nnot the Liberation. We didn\u2019t have no clothes, no nothing. Darling...",
        "A: How did -- it wasn\u2019t only us. It my uncle. He had two children, his wife, his sister-in-law\nwith a child. And other people came in, you know. We had maybe about 20 people hiding there.\nYou couldn\u2019t work, you couldn\u2019t . We were like dead people on the floor. You\ncouldn\u2019t stand. And at night, when it was already dark, when they used to go out and catch fresh\nair. We were there for nine or eight months in that grave.",

        "A: Oh, yes. He used to come at night, about 10:00, when it used to get dark. So he used to come\nat night. He used to be with us for three hours, four hours. And that poor fellow used to go back\nto his place.",
        "A: Yes. You see, that was the farmers, the way I told you, that my uncle used to live in peace\nwith them. He used to help them a whole lot. And my grandmother, shall she rest in peace, she\nused to help them, too. And that what they liked. ,1n Lithuanian.

The good Lord maybe saved our\nlives, by going from one ___ to the tunnel, and not having no support, whatsoever, fall down\nand you can, you know, get killed. So that saved our life.

And the dog start running here and there, and he was barking, and we didn\u2019t know\nwhat it was. Jonas was the name of her son. It was on a Saturday night.

I had potatoes and flour and so on. But as\n(ph) I\u2019m coming back, the girls from concentration camp was alive. But they come back, they\ndidn\u2019t find no children, no husband, no nobody. So where they used to come? To the Ipps, you\nknow -- in Lithuanian, Ipp-es. What I did, I didn\u2019t have too much at that time. So I had the\npotatoes, the potatoes and bread. And I had a big kettle. Put it up, peeled the potatoes with\nonion, pepper -- and it smells, 1t was so good -- and bread -- and I was feeding them with that.\nWhat had happened to me at that time -- when I got that cow, in that place where we used to live\n, there was the officer and the George (ph). And more, you know, from them. We\ntook that cow in the , and we slaughtered it. And we -- like in a butcher shop -- we\nforgot to clean up the place.

And he came to me, and he said, \u201cDo you know, because I respect\nyour husband --\u201d I said, \u201cThat would change you?\u201d And he said he could send me out (ph) for\nhard labor for five years. What he did. I said, \u201c (even though it was his name), I don\u2019t\nknow. I have been living in a democracy country, you can do whatever it please -- you can do\nwhatever is good.\u201d I said, \u201cWe will take it out right away and we go clean it up.\u201d I think my\nhusband wasn\u2019t at that time at home. They send him, I think to Beluge (ph), in Lithuania. And I\nsaid, \u201cPlease, don\u2019t mention it. Don\u2019t bring any harm to us. Hitler didn\u2019t kill us. Please.\u201d And\nhe used to come. I used to make the , different things, the Russian food. But I could\ntell, and he was burning.

If you\ncould teach me more, a little about that life, I promise you, I go follow exactly what you go say.\u201d\nAnd I was crying. I was strong, but I start crying because I was afraid for Jay. And now it\u2019s\neasy to have respect, you know. But that particular sd Siberian (ph) -- where would be my\nlittle Jay? And then I have more children who had lost their mothers. And I kept them in my\nplace. I had about four. He said, \u201cOkay. I will tell you what you can do.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat can I\ndo to make a living?\u201d I said, \u201cCan I bake and sell, you know, some little cakes, you know.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cYes, you can do it.\u201d We made a little kitchen -- a stove, a little stove. And the wood was\nso big, like that. And in that little stove, I used to bake and make cookies. Different things. And\nthen I used to take that to the lady that runs the restaurant. And she used to sell them, and I was\nmaking a little money. When \u2014___ came back, he told him the whole history, the way I did.\nFinally, we became good friends.

        "A: Yiddish. Yes, a Yiddish school. And he was going there with some people who survived,\nyou know, the way we did survive. . It\u2019s moment. The day my husband\ntold me about the cookies and the candies. That somebody called my husband that he\u2019s against\nthe government.

The cookies was no life -- to stay and\nto cook all day, and then to sell it to make nothing. Finally, I sold the house that we had. And I\nran back to the George (ph).

But with the help, I shouldn\u2019t do it. Because if they would caught me, they\nwould send me to Siberia anyhow. My husband knew that the George (ph). And he introduced\nme to him. When he introduced me to him, I became a lawyer. I start doing the papers, you\nknow, to sell the papers. A thousand in one night. That\u2019s the way I want to tell you. And I\nbecame -- I used to sell the house. I didn\u2019t have no trouble. I had the secretary. She knew me\nalready. I had the people who want to buy. And a happy people who wants the money to get out\nfrom Kovno to go into free world. So 1made money. The truth. I made money, I didn\u2019t have to\nwork hard. But, each time I used to have something else to wear. I didn\u2019t wear the same clothes.\n[Crying] Everything that I was doing was fear. Fear and painful. We made some money. I\nmade it. And it came the moment where we have to leave everything that again I had. And on\nour way, 12:00 at night. To make a long story short, I ran, not to the door, but I open up a\nwindow and jumped out of the window -- jumped out with Jay through the window. In the back\nyard, was there a truck, you know? And he took us to vendors (ph). Between three\nand four months, it took us to get in Berlin. And from Berlin, we got in in the American zone\n(ph). Four months, I forgot my name. Jay said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s my name.\u201d That\u2019s another\nthing -- cannot go on the same name each time. Each time, wherever we went, it was no flowers.\nThey took out my husband from the train. We didn\u2019t know about it. But they took my\nhusband because he was wearing boots. And all of a sudden, they have seen that he got a watch.\nI thought it\u2019s the end. But he said, \u201cLet me go. You want my boots? Here are the boots. In\nanother place, you\u2019ve got your watch. Let us go out.\u201d We had been in Nobody\u2019s Land for four\nor five days. Snow, bitter cold. Jay got sick. It 1s just unbelievable, unbelievable what people\ncan go through -- maybe because I was younger. Well, to make a long story short, it was in\nMunich, and they had there, my husband had a job. Then I want to come to America to see my\nsister and my aunt that was my mother\u2019s sister. I wrote them a letter that I want to come to\nAmerica and I need your help. Didn\u2019t took no time. And I told them I don\u2019t want to be any\nmore on the bloody earth. And we got the papers. I didn\u2019t know what to do, which way to turn\nand which way to go. In Israel, you couldn\u2019t go because it\u2019s no place with no certificate. So,\nfinally, when we came here, people were warm, people were nice. But I didn\u2019t have the\nlanguage. I didn\u2019t know nothing. And my husband has to start out life from the beginning.\nTape 4",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t surprised to know what was going on there. We knew already, in the ghettos. But\nwhen the girls come back, you know, and we were on the train and in Kovno, they used to tell us\neverything. And I know what life was, and 1 know what my life was. So when we were in\nMunich, it\u2019s no idle question. Just to go -- just to talk about the passing time from your life and\nnow to look forward for your future. And we didn\u2019t want to stay anymore in Munich. It was\nenough. I couldn\u2019t. Each day was for me horrible. We used to hear Germans marching and\nback. And sometimes, she used to get in a fight with the Nazis. So the only place it was, to go\nto America.",
        "A: How long in Munich? From 1945 -- about three years, I would say, close to three years.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t work there. My husband was working.",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t involved because I said Jay has to go to school, have to take him to school and\nhe comes back. And I wasn\u2019t involved in anything. Just to watch out that there should be\nsomething to eat.",
        "A: Where?",
        "A: Oh, it was a whole lot people in Munich, but it was a whole lot in the camps, you know. The\n_____ camps.",
        "A: Oh, yes. He was the transport , later, of all the trucks, and the cars, and to give everybody,\nyou know, who\u2019s coming in if they need a vehicle, to help them. And he had about, I don\u2019t\nknow, about 15 people, chauffeurs, you know, where you have to take them in different places,\nin Boslin (ph), and \u2014\u2014\u2014.:_ I don\u2019t know, in different places, they used to have for the\n, you know? He was working and he helped them to give them some trucks. The\npeople who want to -- not to wait for any papers, but to go out without papers, and to fight, you\nknow, to come to Israel. So the used to take care of some displaced people. And he\nused give them the trucks and the gears (ph) and everything. He had a big position to do. He\ncan tell you more about it.",
        "A: What I learn?",
        "A: The first stop was New York.",
        "A: How did I got here? I had my brother -- I had a brother, too. He was in Washington. And\nmy sister was in Richmond, and my aunt. And by coming here, to Richmond, the United Jewish\nAppeals, they used to have the people who helped you. And I was afraid, with the job was that\nthe neighbors, so nervous and accepting, they used to come and tell me, \u201c Don\u2019t get upset. Take\nit easy. Take it easy.\u201d",
        "A: From New York.",
        "A: Let finish. If not, I'll forget.",
        "A: When I came to New York, my uncle in Philadelphia, his name is the same thing -- my\nfather\u2019s brother. They was reading the paper, he read the paper -- the , a Jewish paper -\n- and they find out that the Ipp -- Ipp was our name -- , Edna Ipp, and Jay Ipp. And he\nfind out and he came. My husband said, \u201cEdna, do you have a few dollars? Call them up and\ntell them that you are coming.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat you talking? We gonna need that dollar tomorrow\nto eat.\u201d So he said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s your family.\u201d So that the way it happened. So my uncle got in\ncontact with Richmond. My brother got in contact with Philadelphia. And it was going around\nalready for a whole day. Telephone calls here and there and here and there. And finally, my\nuncle came from Philadelphia. And my brother came from Washington. And you would see a\npicture -- that day, I was sitting and knitting a haddock (ph), and all of a sudden, I opened my --\nsomebody said, \u201c .\u2019 They are there. I opened up my eyes and I recognized my brother.\nAnd when I have seen him, he said, \u201cEdna, please. You choking me up. Let me loose. Let me\ngo away.\u201d And then, we are going to Richmond. My brother told me, \u201cI will take care.\u201d He\nsaid they found that they had to come to America, then they\u2019 II find that they had to come to\nRichmond. He\u2019ll go to Washington, Uncle Bennish (ph), may he rest 1n peace, he went to\nPhiladelphia. And we came to Richmond. And it is a , a life from the beginning.\nSeeing people -- my sister. I didn\u2019t know my aunt. Her name was Bessie. I think I found the\nbiggest diamond in the world -- having a family. I lost my family, as you know. But I found\nanother family. They were so nice to us. They were so good to us. Alright, I didn\u2019t know the\nlanguage. None of us knew the language. But Jay was young, and he picked up the language in\nno time, just like that. You had to see it (ph) to make a living. We were resting for a week. And\nhe said, \u201cYou know, Edna, I wouldn\u2019t go to college back. I wouldn\u2019t study any more law.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cWhy?\u201d He said, \u201cAnd I love law.\u201d He said he had to be born here. You had to learn the\nlanguage fluently. \u201cI cannot take it anymore, to be a lawyer here, and to waste my time and not\nto be successful.\u201d So what had happened, he said, \u201cYou know why? Ithink we goup |\nstation.\u201d I looked at him. He said, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be for long.\u201d So we opened up a\nstation. I couldn\u2019t stay home. The doctor told me to get out from the house because I could lose\nmy mind. I was by myself. And he told him, \u201cTake her out from the house, no matter what it is.\nShe should meet the public, she should meet the people.\u201d And it was true. I met people. I was\nthere in the station. I was pumping gas. I was talking to the people. I do it, all the work, what in\na service station has to be done. And the people didn\u2019t come, you know, for a whole lot gas, like\nten gallons, 15 gallons. They used to come, \u201cOh, two gallons. A dollar, a dollar and eight.\u201d\nAnd you have to do the work that they should come back, you know, to clean the windshields\nand everything. And this is the way that they came in. And they came in and they said, \u201cId like\nto fill up, I think, with gas.\u201d Oh, I said that\u2019s a kind person there. Do you know what I did? I\ndidn\u2019t know how to pump the gas. So instead, to stop the nozzle from the gas -- it shouldn\u2019t go\nin anymore because it was filled up -- I pressed the nozzle, and the gas flewup _\u2014.-~ Well, I\ntold my husband, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not a service operator. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Oh, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d I\nlost a customer. I asked him, you know, with my language at that time, I didn\u2019t know even how\nto say even \u201cthank you.\u201d Used to say, \u201cSank ye, sank ye.\u201d",
        "A: And I was working hard. But then, it wasn\u2019t hard. It was so easy. It was so wonderful. I\nsaid, \u201cThe country, it\u2019s so beautiful. The people...\u201d I used to go out, always with a smile, and\ntalk to the people. And I used to cry. All of a sudden, the customer came in -- from the\ncustomers I made good friends -- he said, \u201cMrs. Ipson, did somebody hurt you?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d I said,\n\u201cOh, no. Ihave a cold. And that\u2019s why my tears are running.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to\nhear.\u201d I said, \u201cBut Iam okay.\u201d I wiped up my tears and start smiling. It was alright. Another\nepisode I want to tell you. A yellow cab was not too far from our station. And two insurance\npeople met each other and they observed me, the way I was working. And one said to the other,\n\u201cThat woman doesn\u2019t have no problems whatsoever.\u201d He said, \u201cWhy? Take a look at her,\nalways with a smile, smiles, smiles. If she would have problems, she wouldn\u2019t smile.\u201d The\nother insurance man said, \u201cLet\u2019s betting ten dollars that she got problems, too.\u201d He said,\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s bet in ten dollars, and we\u2019ll go to the lady, we\u2019ll go ask her what problems she\nhave, she doesn\u2019t have.\u201d So they came in and they asked me, \u201cListen, my dear lady.\u201d [He] said,\n\u201cWe'd like to ask you a question.\u201d I said, \u201cIf I be able to answer in English, Pll be glad to\nanswer.\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s not hard.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cDo you have problems?\u201d [He] said, \u201cI\nhave talked to my friend and I told him that you don\u2019t have no problems whatsoever because all\nday long, when I see you with the people just smiling.\u201d I said, \u201cLook, my dear friend, if I would\ntold you my problems, what I had, the biggest tractor trailer wouldn\u2019t take from one corner to the\nother.\u201d The other man said, \u201cTen dollars.\u201d And that\u2019s what I know that they got in. It\u2019s a\nwonderful country. It\u2019s beautiful. People used to ask me, \u201cHow can you say that you are\nhappy?\u201d I said, \u201cI am happy. Do you know what freedom means?\u201d I said, \u201cYou can do\neverything that it please you. It\u2019s a democracy country. You can work, just work. Pay tax. Pay\neverything. It\u2019d be for you and it would bea _\u2014\u2014_\u2014soo ff the government. If you don\u2019t want to\nwork, you don\u2019t pay the tax, you\u2019re in trouble. You don\u2019t have nothing. But work, hard work,\nmakes your life sweet.\u201d I would say, \u201cYou know why? Because I didn\u2019t have time to think\nabout my passing time.\u201d And \u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014sS*became a lawyer. After all year, he came in and he start\nup in the service station. And it really helps me. But then I start thinking here, we are in a\nwonderful country, we make a living. We go something. And from the service station,\nwe gotin,andawhole __ business. After my bill pass, nice business. And we made. And\nmy husband, on top of that, he was working for the community. He was a member of B\u2019nai\nB\u2019rith (ph). He was a member in Temple. He was a member from the association, from the Job\nAssociation. He was a president. He was a . He is, even now, a clever, clever man. He\ndid so much for the community in Richmond. I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t bore the papers with me,\nthe write-ups.",
        "A: My sister, nobody --",
        "A: Oh, am I religious?",
        "A: Oh, my religion?",
        "A: Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. I always prayed, and always had the prayer of my lips that God\nshould help us. It\u2019s -- we used to go in Temple, we belonged to several temples, not the one I\u2019m\nin now, but the first temple was . And the Jewish tradition, nobody could take that\naway. That is up today. And we raise up Jay in the same way. And not because Jay is my son,\nbut he\u2019s really a very good leader. He just left the Temple as president. His beautiful awards\nfrom . He lead in Temple so good, and he was in other organizations, president -- was\npresident of B\u2019nai B'rith (ph). He was president for =~. ~The whole family was very active\nin America.",
        "A: No. No. BUt let me tell you something, and that is true. When my uncle used to come every\nweek, and when he didn\u2019t come in time, and I didn\u2019t see him the next day or the third day --\nbecause I believed in him -- I don\u2019t know how to say, in God? -- so when he used to come, he\nused to give us so much hope. And he used to talk about the religion. About the kind things.\nDeep in my heart, nobody can take away my name, Jew. And when I am here, I am going\neverywhere -- is my name. I\u2019m Jewish. I\u2019m not ashamed. Some children, they were ashamed to\ntell them that they are Jewish people. Here in America, in the temple where my husband was\npresident -- and they have their lecture -- and somebody from the children said, \u201cOh, let\u2019s get up.\nMy friend doesn\u2019t know that I am Jewish.\u201d And now, when I heard it, 1 really jumped up. I said,\n\u201cWhat to be afraid. Here is a wonderful country. Here is a democracy country. Here is\nbeautiful. You go to bed, you don\u2019t have to be afraid that in four or five hours that the\nwill came and you have to go out in bitter cold, 4:00 in the morning. And then, because they\nwant to know how the Jewish people will behave.\u201d It is unbelievable for people when you said,\n\u201cWhat means democracy?\u201d Under Hitler, I told you what it is. Under the Russian people, you\nare not a person, you are just like I said. You have to go the way the government says. But your\nown ideas or something, you couldn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t have. But here, it\u2019s wonderful. You know\nwhat I called here? It\u2019s a paradise. We got out from hell and come to a paradise.",
        "A: You never could forget. No matter, each time when we are sitting and talking -- and even\nwhen you have company and you start talking, and you come up right away with the pacing\n____. Youcannot forget any. That\u2019s what we appreciate. That\u2019s why we are so grateful to\nAmerica. Because we found the place where to live in freedom. I\u2019m not afraid anymore when I\ngo to bed that somebody will come and get rescued out. Do you know, honey, what is the\nmeaning of that? No, people wouldn\u2019t know, because it is the worst thing in the world when you\nfall asleep after a hard day of labor, and all of a sudden, the starts running, crying,\ncalling you, \u201cGet up!\u201d And in ten minutes, you have to be dressed up and get out. But here, it\u2019s\nnot anymore. Here is peace. Here is freedom. Here is wonderful.",
        "A: That peace -- I tell you something -- that freedom, who can describe to you the way I can\ndescribe democracy (ph). Like, somebody said to me -- this was the right up in the paper, in the\ngasoline station, when I was working. And one came in and said, \u201cLook, if I go give you a\nmillion dollar and go back .. .\u201d I said, \u201cAnd if you will give me all the jewelry from the Queen\nElizabeth and tell me to go back, I will tell you, \u2018Keep that. And I want my comfort here.\u2019 I am a\ncitizen already.\u201d After the citizen papers, when I got them.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s more things -- let\u2019s finish it -- there\u2019s more things, you know, to do. But,\nlike I said, it\u2019s a wonderful country.",
        "A: Very -- I\u2019m happy to be here. We arrange, we accomplish (ph). So, I figure that\ncouldn\u2019t study any more law, that he worries to the end (ph). I said, what -- but with his\nknowledge, my health, we could age andbe \u2014___ -- and not only for ourselves, but for the\ncommunity. I got to bring you that lettuce, but here\u2019s your receipt (ph). Well, 1t was working\nproduce (ph). And now I have to tell you something. When _\u2014siwaspresidentin Temple _,\nin 1967, Ipsak Rabin (ph) --he invite Ipsak (ph) Rabin to come here to Richmond because he\nwant to raise some bonds, Israeli bonds. And Ipsak Rabin (ph) came to Richmond and raised the\nmoney, I don\u2019t know, $45,000. At that time, that was a whole lot money. And when he asked\nquestions to -- my husband, he could tell you what had happened. So we took\npictures at that time. And I had Ipsak Rabin (ph), my husband, and myself. And the Jewish\ncommunity, when they killed -- and they killed him, they asked me if I have something. I said,\n\u201cT think I do. I think I have a picture from Ipsak Rabin (ph).\u201d They said, \u201cYou do?\u201d And I told\nhim everything. And Jay will tell you the same thing, what had happened. Anyhow...",
