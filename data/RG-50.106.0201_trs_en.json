        "A: That\u2019s right. I went to a public school.",
        "Q: I was going to ask you about your school.",
        "A: But you know this was only a village school. It had only four classes for eight grades. And\nwhen I finished my fifth grade, my mother felt that I was a smart girl, that I should go to high\nschool. So she inquired the next city to our, where we were was called Pilsen, Michaela comes\nfrom and so she went to a school a German school and the principal said I have to write a little\nexam which I did.\nAnd I went there to school but even so it only was 18 kilometers from our village. I couldn\u2019t do\nthat. You know there was no transportation and the horse and buggy I couldn\u2019t do that twice a\nday. So my mother found a family where I was boarding. That means when I was 12 years old, I\nalready left home. But you know I used to go to school and give lectures on the Holocaust and I\nwould tell the children that at 12 years of age, I would be already on my own and they said oh\nhow horrible. And I would say well it wasn\u2019t so horrible. I became very self-sufficient and I had\nto look after myself and I felt very important.\nAnd well I was taught from when I was very young to be self-sufficient. My mother would send\nme on a train when I was six years old to visit an uncle and aunt who had no children in southern\nBohemia. And I wasn\u2019t afraid at all. They put me on the train and I was the whole day on the\ntrain and on the other side my uncle would be waiting for me and I had absolutely no fear. You\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nknow when you grow up in a village, it is different like in the city because in the village you\ndon\u2019t have \u2014 well we did have burglars, they burgled our store but I wasn\u2019t afraid. First of all\nthere was maybe one or two cars and one of them was when our doctor from the next village.\nAnd he came through the village like a crazy guy so you\u2019d say go away, go away quickly\nbecause the gonzerit [ph] is coming. You know even the chickens and the geese were running\naway on the street. You know in front of our house was a pond. And as children we would go\nswimming there. Nobody taught us. We just went in the water and started first with one leg down\nand then we just lifted the other leg and that\u2019s how we were swimming.\nAnd in winter it froze over and we would be skating on it. But I was, I didn\u2019t have a really\nproper skate. My mother had a pair of skates. Can you imagine from the turn of the century.\nThey were iron skates and you attached them to your shoes you know like you had a key and you\nhad to turn it. And I would put them on in front of our house and by the time I was at the pond I\nlost them about three times. But my brother, he was very good at it and he won the special skate\nand he told my mother you buy me, Kanotski [ph]. And these are already good skates and they\nhad little, like little teeth in the front. And as a matter of fact one day he fell into the water.\nBecause we had inns and the inns would take the ice from the pond, from the summer so that the\nbeer would be cold in their cellar. And overnight it would freeze over and let\u2019s say there was a\nlittle snow so you couldn\u2019t tell where they took out the snow, the ice. And one day my brother\ncrossed the pond and he fell in and we were standing in the window, my mother and I. We were\nabsolutely going crazy because you could see him going up and down and up and down. And\nthen a young man came and he lie down on the ice and he rescued him but he had pneumonia\nand pleurisy because he was in that icy water.",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in the town or among your friends. You said you \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no. Because you have to understand that we didn\u2019t have a radio because we didn\u2019t\nhave electricity. So nobody had radios. My mother I think was the only person who got a\nnewspaper. So they really didn\u2019t know what was going on around them. And with a German\nspeaking village, the people lived there probably I don\u2019t know 300 years, 400 years something\nlike that.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "Q: What language did you speak at home?",
        "A: German.",
        "Q: German. Ok. And did you have a large extended family? You mentioned some relatives.",
        "A: Yes, my mother was, she had \u2014 there were ten siblings, five girls and five boys and my father\nthere were five boys from the first marriage and then there were two girls from the second\nmarriage. My grandfather married his niece, probably at that time it was allowed. I don\u2019t know.\nBut she was his brother\u2019s daughter. And he said that she was so beautiful that nobody else would\nbe able to have her but him. And he had five sons with her.",
        "Q: So you would go visit all these relatives?",
        "A: No they would come to visit us because we lived in the village and they lived in \u2014 like five of\nthem lived in Prague and so on. So during the summer we always had visitors.",
        "Q: Was your family a Zionist family?",
        "A: No, you know living in the village and my mother took us to Pilsen. That was, as I said the\nnext big town or city. And she would take us there for Hanukah and the holidays so we would\nyou know be able to know what it means to be Jewish. And for Sukkot, we didn\u2019t have a sukkah\nbut we put branches in, from the trees the branches. Of, behind all the pictures. This was that, so\nwe knew it was Sukkot. And my mother which was very unusual knew how to doven, you know\nshe knew how to read Hebrew because at that time women really didn\u2019t know anything. And to\nlearn something about being Jewish, she engaged a rabbi from another town. It took him two\nhours by bus to come and teach us and of course we didn\u2019t like him very much because he was\nlimping. And you know children are very cruel and because he was different right. And we\nalways were somewhere. They had to look for us 1n the village where we were. So he was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nteaching us some Hebrew and he was teaching us the Sh\u2019ma and so on. So I knew that I was\nJewish that you know \u2014",
        "Q: Hitler came into power in 1933 and you were only eight years old. Obviously you didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: At that time you know Czechoslovakia was a very wonderful country. There was no\ndifference between religions. Everybody went to the same school. And it was really wonderful\nand the first president of Czechoslovakia was a man by the name of Masaryk. He was very\nforward looking. As a matter of fact he took his, he married an American. Her name was Guise.\nAnd he incorporated in his name, her name so his first name was Tomas and then it was Gari and\nthen it was Masaryk. And he was very, I mean he was a socialist but he was as far as being\nJewish, there was a process. One Jewish man was accused of black libel and he defended this\nman. I mean he was a fantastic man. The only thing he was already older. He was during the\nFirst World War he was a legionnaire and of course he was in touch with the United States and\nEngland and so on. And this is when Czechoslovakia became a country in 1918 because before it\nwas part of Austro-Hungary but that was many, many, many years.",
        "Q: When did you first starting hearing about a man named Hitler? Do you remember your first\ntime you heard of him?",
        "A: Well the thing is when I was in Pilsen, the family I lived with every Friday night we would\ngo to another family visiting and they always were listening to the radio and the conversation\nalways was about Germany, about a name named Hitler. But where I lived there were considered\nGermans. There was a man by the name of Hans Henline and he formed a party. And so I knew\nabout the Henline party. And in our village there only were probably three people who belonged\nto the party. And they didn\u2019t live in \u2014 these were young people who went to school, university\nstudents who went to school in Prague. And they brought it, they talked about it but nobody else\ndid. And so of course in 1937 I already was aware that there was a man by the name of Hitler.",
        "Q: You were 12 years old then?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: I was 12 years old.",
        "Q: OK and you were still going to school away from home?",
        "A: Yes and I came home during the summer and that\u2019s when it all started, 1938. And of course\nyou know Czechoslovakia wasn\u2019t supposed to be occupied and, but Hitler had never \u2014 and you\nknow they mobilized and of course people from my village who were German, they also were\nmobilized. They all went to the army. And then October Hitler decided yes, of course. No, that\nwas like this. In the spring of 1938 Hitler occupied Austria.",
        "Q: Right, the Anschluss.",
        "A: And he promised of course he had the meeting with Chamberlin in the summer of 1938 and\nhe said that he would not enter Czechoslovakia. Of course he was a liar. And you know what\nhappened. And so first of October the Germans started crossing the border, you know from\nBavaria and Saxony. But they said that our little village would not be occupied because we had a\nfew Czech citizens and so my mother was worried, what\u2019s going to be but they said it\u2019s not\ngoing to be occupied.\nBut during the night from the 7 to the 8\"\" of October somebody knocked on the door and it was\nan officer from the Czech army because they had some of the soldiers that were billeted in our\nvillage. And so he said that he could buy some petrol for the truck and my mother said what do\nyou need petrol for the truck now in the middle of the night and he said that we are leaving\nbecause the Germans are going to occupy your little village. So she was very upset and she asked\nhim whether they would take us along and he said yes they would. So in the morning.",
        "Q: This is the three of you, your mother, your brother and you.",
        "A: Yes so and we had a maid. Of course she was crying bitterly, you know because she was so\nattached to us. And oh yes, the people that assembled in front of our house. And they yelled at\nmy mother and they said, they called her by her first name because they all worked together then.\nMy mother\u2019s name was Elsa and they said Elsa what are doing. Why are you leaving? We are\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nnot going to do anything to you and she said but I have children and I have to protect my\nchildren. So the officers sent a truck and the soldiers put things from our store on the truck and\nthey didn\u2019t take anything from the house. Only things from the store. And she asked them\nwhether they would take me along because we had some relatives in a \u2014 well a bigger village\nnear Pilsen. It was called Shemashna [ph]. And they should take me there. So I went. I was\ntwelve and a half year old. No I was 13 by that time, put me on the truck with the soldiers and I\narrived at my relatives.",
        "Q: But your mother and brother were still with you right?",
        "A: No they still were, I was the first one to leave.",
        "Q: Oh you were in a separate.",
        "A: I was separate and these relatives had no idea that I was coming and I really didn\u2019t know them\nand so I said well we are running away because we are being occupied so they took me in and\nthe soldiers would, the things they had on the truck, they put in a barn and then my mother and\nbrother came in the afternoon. But during the night the soldiers came back and they stole all our\nstuff.\nAnd so my mother got in touch with some of her brothers and sisters in Prague and they said\nwell you have to come to Prague. And so I don\u2019t know how long we stayed with these relatives.",
        "Q: Do you remember at that time being very frightened when you had to leave your home?",
        "A: Well it was, it was you know you live \u2014",
        "Q: You were 13 years old.",

        "Q: Did you take anything special with you when you went with the soldiers.",

        "Q: The three of you.",
        "A: The three of us and some relatives waited for us on the train. And we went to an uncle and\naunt that they decided what they\u2019re going to do with us. And so I was \u2014",
        "Q: How long had you stayed in that before you got to Prague, how long did you stay in that \u2014",
        "A: With the people in Shemashna.",

And then I went to Prague and they said that my uncle and\naunt, it was the oldest brother of my mother, that they would take me in and I would stay with\nthem. And my mother went to live with her -- she had a little sister and a bachelor brother who\nlived together and she went to live with them. And my brother went to live with a cousin.",
        "Q: So you all lived in separate places?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",

I would like that\nshe should be able to go to school. And she says no problem. She can come tomorrow. But I\ndidn\u2019t speak Czech. But you know when you are 13 years old, believe you me you learn a\nlanguage one, two, three. And my aunt was very smart. She engaged a girl who was a year older\nthan me who was smart. And she taught me the grammar because Czech grammar is like French.\nYou know you have seven cases. It is not like English. And in English it\u2019s easy to learn. There is\nno grammar to it, because the words they are all the same. The endings are all the same. There is\nonly one article, whereas in Czech you have three and seven cases and then the words change.",

I went back to the school in 1999 and I went there and\nI said that you know I was on the march of the living and I, what I was doing and perhaps they\nwould be interested that the students should hear me.

Some\nwere crying and some were Heil-ing and I didn\u2019t know what was going on. You know it was \u2014\nand then I came home and of course my uncle and aunt were very upset and but I was allowed to\ncontinue my school, my class. My year. The Germans let us stay and finish the school year. But\nthere were things. Every day was something different. The first thing you had to give up all your\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nradios. You had to give up your jewelry and I had a little ring and my mother gave it to me I\nthink for my ninth birthday or something like that. Had a little ruby stone. And my aunt said you\nbetter give me that ring because you don\u2019t want to be punished because you didn\u2019t give up your\nring. I had to give my ring which was dramatic a little bit. And then you were not allowed to go\nto the park. You were not allowed to go on the sidewalk. You were not allowed to go to the\nmovies, not to the theater. You could only shop at certain hours because they, probably the end\nof the day when there wasn\u2019t very much left. That\u2019s when we were allowed to go shopping.\nOn the streetcar we were, I think I had to go the last car and so on.",

It was a Youth Aliyah school and she made me go\nthere. I mean it was a most wonderful school. And there I learned a great deal and our teachers\nwere not very much older because they were university students and they couldn\u2019t go to school\nso they and they were Zionists and so they were teaching us and we were preparing to go to\nPalestine.",

        "A: Oh we were Zionist. I belonged to a Zionist organization. As a side thing I want to tell you\nthat there was a young man by the name of Hanan Backri who was with me in that Zionist\norganization. And I, then when the war broke out I you know we all went to somewhere else and\nI never heard from him again. I didn\u2019t know where he was and I received a newspaper from\nPrague, it\u2019s called Iresh Chodesh. And one day there was a little ad and he was, there was a\nman was looking for another man and he signed himself Hanan Backri and I said to myself there\nare not that many Hanan Backri\u2019s around and there was his address in Israel and I wrote to him\nand I said you know I think I know you. And you know me. That belonged to the cell at Lavan\nand anyway within ten days I got a phone call from him. I was so excited. He said yes, yes that\u2019s\nme. And unfortunately a few, I was in touch with him all the time. And when I went on the\nmarches at Lavan the last time in 204, I met him with his wife in Jerusalem and I was now in\ncontact with him emailing. But his email stopped. And I sent him a wish for Rosh Hashanah and\nI didn\u2019t get an answer and I started phoning him and there was nobody there. The phone was\nringing, ringing, ringing. So yesterday I phoned Israel. I phoned Beit Terezin and I asked about\nhim and they were telling me that a few days ago he had, was his funeral. So he was in my fotsa\n[ph] in the Zionist organization. So we were ardent Zionists and we wanted to live on a kibbutz\nand we wanted to do all the work and we were very excited.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",

I\u2019m not quite sure. And he didn\u2019t survive.\nHe was a fellow -- you will have his book I\u2019m sure there. It\u2019s, his son found his book. His diary\nwas found in Terezin. And it was published and I\u2019m sure you must have it. The story of Gunda\nRedleigh. He was the one who put the names together for the transport from Terezin to Poland so\nhe had a terrible job. So 1f you are interested, I am sure you can find it in your library. And \u2014",
        "Q: So you weren\u2019t able to go to England. So then what happened?",
        "A: Well I continued going to school and we hoped to go to Palestine. But then in the fall of 1940\nas I told you that Eichmann, that the Jews could leave. He grants us visas. So some people then\ngot visas and went to England. Very few. Some, America had only had quotas so they didn\u2019t\ntake us. And Mr. Roosevelt didn\u2019t want us because he was running for a second term so he\ncouldn\u2019t use us. And some, a few people went to Cuba, to Guatemala, to Quito you know and\nSouth America. And they would go to a priest and the priest would give them a paper that they\nare Catholic and that\u2019s how they got to South America. And since Eichmann couldn\u2019t get rid of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nus so he had to find a place where to send us. So he found this place called Terezin or\nTheresienstadt in the northeast of Prague. Before that he couldn\u2019t wait that long. So in October\n1941 the first transports were sent, five of them, a thousand persons each to the Lodz ghetto.\nThat was the beginning. And then they sent a young, about 450 young men to Terezin to prepare\nthe camp you know to make bunks and the kitchen had to be \u2014 because it was a, 1t was a military\ntime and so they prepared it and then the first transport to Terezin went in December 41. So then\nwe knew that we will be moved. But you know nobody had any idea what it was like, where we\nare going to go, what\u2019s going to be and you know I didn\u2019t go \u2014 the school stopped. And anyway\nit was a very uneasy time.",
        "Q: So you just stayed home with your relatives.",
        "A: No, my relatives are fed up with me. Because after school, my school was til 6:00 and we\nhad a long day because we had to accomplish a lot and because I belonged to a Zionist\norganization I still went to a\u2014 you know a get together from the Zionist organization and Jews\nhad to be home by 8:00 and I would, you know I didn\u2019t want to \u2014 you know we had nice band\nwith all these young people. We learned how to sing Hebrew songs. We learned how to march\nand you know everything was Zionist they\u2019re doing, preparing to go to Palestine.",
        "Q: Did you wear a uniform or anything?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: Just your regular clothes?",
        "A: My regular clothes and I started running home like crazy because I couldn\u2019t wait for a street\ncar because that was too slow because I had to be home before 8:00. Because if they would have\ncaught me they could put me into jail. And my poor uncle and aunt they were on pins and\nneedles because it was five to eight and I still wasn\u2019t home. And so I arrived maybe one minute\npast eight and my poor uncle was standing already in the door. My aunt must have given orders\nthat he should give me a, give me one you know. And so they decided that they cannot take this\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nbecause it\u2019s you know \u2014 and doing terrible things to them. And you know I\u2019m 14 years old or 15.\nYou know you want to be with the young people and you don\u2019t take these things so serious. And\nso they asked my mother that she should find a place to send me somewhere. So my mother went\nto the Jewish community and the social services and says I have a daughter and I cannot keep\nher. Perhaps you have a place where you could place her. So they did place me with young\nwomen. It was a women\u2019s shelter. But most of them, they\u2019re a little older and they were not of\nvery good repute. And they did things which I really didn\u2019t like and I felt, I went to school from\nthere. But I felt that it wasn\u2019t the right place for me. So I myself, already at that time was very\nself-sufficient I tell you. And I went to the social services and I told them. Listen, this is not a\nplace for me. These girls are doing things which --",
        "Q: Were they Jewish girls?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: They were all Jewish.",
        "A: Yeah they all were refugees. They mostly were from Carpatha Russia, which is now Ukraine.\nAnd I went there and he says well we have now a home for young girls and boys and we will\nplace you there. And these were children from a town called Ostrova, where their fathers were\nsent to Poland to work. The Jewish fathers. You know. They took all the Jewish men and they\nsent them into what\u2019s called Nisco. And so the children were sent to Prague and there was, we\nwere in two apartment house, in two different apartments. Like a large apartment. In one were\nthe girls and then the other one were the boys. And we just got our food there. But the food was\nhardly any food. And I got extremely thin. And they became worried, so they found two families\nwhere I went for lunch, two lunches a week so I shouldn\u2019t get so skinny. And that\u2019s when I still\nwent to school. And so then I was sent to another home. You know how you are being shuttled\nfrom one end, from one place to another. And the transports were going already. And my mother\nand my brother, even so, my brother lived in an orphanage and my mother lived with her sister\nbut when the transport was called, my mother and brother went together with, in August of 42\nthey went to Terezin. And I went to Terezin on the ninth of September I believe, 1942, with\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\ntransport BS and my number was 992. I remember that very well. And I worked then. I came\nthere. I knew someone a young man and I worked in the hospital, a nurse, as a nurse\u2019s aide. My\nmother worked also as a nurse and as a matter of fact we had typhoid and she worked in the\nhospital where the children had typhoid. And my brother he was very young then. He was 15. He\nwas making toys for children. Wooden toys. I mean not for the children from Terezin. The\nGermans took all these things out. They were \u2014 they said, took it to Germany. And you know in\nTheresienstadt 1t was again we were the young people and I was already 18, no 17. And we\nwould get together in the loft. We had lofts. You know the Germans kind of didn\u2019t know that we\nhad these lofts and we would get together and we would, there would be somebody who would\nread poetry. And somebody would sing. I mean it was like what young people are doing. And\nbut the thing was that people started to leave you know. And nobody knew where these people\nwere going and people \u2014 oh yes, a lot of people came from Germany and German Jews were told\nthat they are going to be sent to a bath, you know like serene bath, house bath you know to a spa\nand they were allowed to bring their mattresses along. And so they arrived and they said so\nwhere is the spa where because they lied to them. And there were loads of old people and they\nstarted dying out very fast. And we, the young ones, we kept on going. We had, we did our\nthing even when the only thing we were afraid, that we would be sent away and nobody knew\nwhere you\u2019re going to be sent. They sent you a little piece of paper and you said they said you\nhave to be at 8:00 at this place and a family. And so my mother was one, got a little paper once.\nAnd because she was a nurse, she was looking after people who had typhoid so they took her out\nagain. That was what Gunda Redlich was doing. And then one day she, again she came to me\nand she said she was called up again and that was September 43 and at night came my brother to\nsee me and he says you know what I am going voluntarily with mother because I cannot let her\ngo by herself. You know my mother wasn\u2019t that old. My mother was in her early 50s. You know\nthat was 43. That means she was 53 years old. And but he said he couldn\u2019t let her go by herself.\nAnyway so they left and I this is the famous DM transport where I suppose you know that all of\nthem was killed on the eighth of March 1944. But my mother died, she got diarrhea and when\nsomebody got diarrhea they died from dehydration and my mother died on the fourth of January\n1944.\nAnd my brother who was in this DM transport, the whole transport was called up and they were\nkilled, all of them close to 4000 Czech Jews were killed on the eighth of March 1944. And so\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nwe were, we were left in that \u2014 in Birkenau and we were waiting when are going to be called up\nbecause you see when you arrived in Birkenau, in Auschwitz, Birkenau. You had to sign a paper\nthat after six months it\u2019s going to be special treatment. And our six months would be up very\nsoon. So we knew this is what\u2019s going to happen to us. But in the meantime the Germans sent in\nmore prisoners from Terezin to day to be at that familial camp to fill it up and then what we\ndidn\u2019t know was the invasion of Europe, you know in 1944 when British and went to Dunkirk\nand the Canadians and so on, they started invading Europe. We didn\u2019t know that. So one day, I\nmean, you know there were always rumors and there were rumors that there\u2019s going to be a\nselection. See in our camp there was never a selection like in the men. Where the men where in\nD camp there were always selections. And they always took out the people who were old or sick\nor couldn\u2019t work anymore and they took them out and they gassed them. That happened. I don\u2019t\nknow how often during the week, but it happened very often.",
        "Q: Can we go back a little bit in time and tell me going from Terezin to Auschwitz for you, can\nyou tell me about that.",
        "A: Yeah that was, that was terrible because I had high fever. I had a tonsillitis and so forth. They\ncouldn\u2019t care less and they put you in these cattle cars and without water, without toilets.",
        "Q: And when was this, what was the date that you left Terezin.",
        "A: On the 15\" of December 43.",
        "Q: 15\" of December.",
        "A: Yes that was a transport DR. And we were one and then the next day came another transport\nthat was \u2014",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about that journey from Terezin. You said you were sick.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t very much with it because I was faced with you know with (inaudible) in this cattle\ncar. There was nowhere, there were no benches, no nothing. I was standing, trying sit or\nsomething and they always, in they always moved you during, they always moved you during\nthe night. They put you late, late afternoon. They put you on the trains and then you traveled and\nyou had no \u2014 you know we tried to look out that knew that, knowing of course we had no idea\nwhere we were going. And then we arrived in the morning. And the doors opened and they\nstarted, the Germans started yelling.",
        "Q: How long was the journey?",
        "A: It must have been overnight.",
        "Q: Just overnight. And were you with friends, your age?",
        "A: No, there was \u2014",
        "Q: Who were you with?",
        "A: All kinds of people. I don\u2019t have no idea. I have absolutely no idea who was with me. In that\ntrain. And so we jumped, they yelled us to get out, get out and we just jumped out and we saw\nyoung boys in pajamas running around and they would say, they would yell, say like don\u2019t go on\nthe trucks. Don\u2019t go on the trucks, because if you go on the trucks you will go to heaven. But you\nknow you are completely -- you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with you. You have absolutely no\ncontrol about your thoughts or anything because it\u2019s just, it\u2019s like a strange land and they put you\non the trucks and you go. And so they drove us from there into the camp and we landed in that\nfamily camp. And so they divided the girls separate and the women separate and the men\nseparate and I landed up in this house or block number 11. And there were about 800 women in\none of these houses, these blocks. And we had these bunks, three story high bunks and about\neight, where eight women would like on one, on shelf kind of. And since then you were young\nso you could climb up so you were up there and of course when you are up there which was good\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nbecause you had air and when you were old and sick you were on the bottom and it was pitch\ndark and it was like hell there.",
        "Q: What were you wearing? What did you wear?",
        "A: What did I wear. I, oh yes, I know what I wore. Now you reminded me. I bartered, you\nknow we bartered. In camps you barter for things. And I bartered with someone for a man\u2019s suit.\nI don\u2019t remember what I gave but I landed up with a man\u2019s suit. It was a very nice brown man\u2019s\nsuit and there were women who were working in where they had sewing machines. They were\nsewing so they did things on the side you know for a piece of bread or something. I don\u2019t know\nhow many slices of bread I gave her for that. But she made me a beautiful suit, a jacket, she\nturned it upside down or inside out. And I had a lovely jacket and from the pants she made me a\nskirt. And then I found somewhere a piece of fur and somebody made me a cap. A fur hat and I\nhad a fur collar so I looked really snazzy and in that thing I came to Auschwitz. Now I remember\nthat. I sometimes forget things already.",
        "Q: This was your clothes in Terezin you think.",
        "A: This was, yes, yes. You know we as girls, we wanted to look nice in Terezin. Most of the girls\nwore plaid skirts. These skirts were made from blankets. I don\u2019t know where we got these\nblankets but we had and we wore these --",
        "Q: So that\u2019s what you wore, that new suit you had \u2014",
        "A: That new suit, oh yes. I --",
        "Q: You wore that to Auschwitz?",
        "A: That was very f, I was very fashionable.",
        "Q: I\u2019m saying that\u2019s what you were wearing when you got to Auschwitz.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: That\u2019s what I was wearing, yes. And so we were there a little while and then they took us out\nto another block and there we, girls sitting, Polish girls sitting at little tables and we had to sit\ndown at the little tables and that\u2019s where we, they tattooed us and I got my number and my\nnumber is 70663. And my number is very much on my forearm because that jacket had very tight\nsleeves and I couldn\u2019t move my sleeve up. Normally the number is near the elbow but number is\nvery low down because I couldn\u2019t move up the sleeve.",
        "Q: What was that like for you? I mean here you are what, 18 years old, and getting a tattoo, what",
        "A: You are in a trance. You are not, you are not there. When you arrive in Auschwitz, it was like\nyou know you went from one, you were like a, like a marionette. You know where they put you,\nthere you went. And you had no idea what was going on with you because like I say it was like\nbeing in a trance.",
        "Q: Did they take off your hair, did they shave \u2014",
        "A: Wait a minute. So when we, we had the numbers we again lined up in front of the block and\nall the women were, the men were in different blocks and the women were in different blocks.\nAnd they started marching us to outside of the camp to a building. We had no idea what this\nbuilding was. When we arrived in that building we had to get undressed and the only thing we\nwere allowed to keep were our stockings. And they put something on our hair in case we had\nlice I suppose and they put us under the shower. Now you, we had no idea that these were gas\nchambers because this was -- you could use this as a shower place or as a gas chamber because\nthe only thing, the difference was when they wanted to kill the people there were little openings\nin the ceiling and through those ceilings they put in the canisters of Zyklon B and the pebbles\nwould slowly come down and the people would suffocate. You know but this our, it\u2019s around,\nbut we had no idea. So then we took a shower and we were allowed to keep our stockings and\nthere was a bench and they put the stockings there and when it came time for me to get my\nstockings, they weren\u2019t there. I was hysterical because it was December and I had no stockings.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nSo of course they took away our shoes. They took away our clothes, the shoes and everything.\nAnd but I found another pair, I don\u2019t know whose it was. Probably this person took mine so she\nleft this. And they moves us to another room where there was a girl and she threw at us clothes.\nLiterally. She had a, you know she had a big bundle of, and she would throw it. And whether\nyou were tall or small or whatever, these horrible clothes. And I think we had, she gave us a little\ncoat or something. And instead of shoes we got these pantofels. You know the wooden clogs.\nBut that was really a savior because if we would have been standing in leather shoes would have\nbeen even worse. If they\u2019re wooden at least we didn\u2019t have frozen toes because you know we\nwere standing outside for hours being counted in the morning and in the afternoon. And then\nthey started moving, then they marched back to the camp and I was on that block 11. And we\nwere not allowed to go out for \u2014 there was a quarantine of 14 days so \u2014",
        "Q: You\u2019re still talking about still the family camp?",
        "A: That was in the family camp, yeah. But we were a quarantine of 14 days but as you know we\nfound out things, what it was like where we were. You know I mean there\u2019s always somebody\nwho comes in \u2014 the girl who brought the soup that -- and we would try to talk to them. I found\nout that the previous transport with my mother and brother is also there so I found out where my\nmother was. And when we were allowed to, after the 14 days, when we were allowed to walk\naround in the camp, I went to look for my mother and she was on block 27. So that was quite far\naway and you know having only those clogs and in Poland it\u2019s very \u2014 the mud is unbelievable\nbecause it\u2019s clay. You sink into it like you had to take a step, take your pantofel and put it down\nand then your foot and so on. I did find my mother and she was in a terrible state already. She\nhad diarrhea. How do I know she had diarrhea? Because anybody you saw with a white mouth,\nyou know they gave out a powder against diarrhea so I knew that already that she was not well.\nSo I said well I have to do something. So I volunteered to carry the soup, because if you carried\nthem \u2014 they were in barrels. It was heavy like hell. And the two girls were carrying the soup,\none in the front and one in the back. We had like poles and over the poles there was some bands\nand those you put over your shoulders and that\u2019s how you walked. That\u2019s how you carried this.\nBut the thing was when we went to pick up those barrels, you could scrape out the left over soup.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nThat was, so I said I\u2019m going to go and carry the soup. At least I will be able to give to my\nmother a little soup. Unfortunately she got so very ill and she died a few days later.\nSo I stopped carrying the soup. And we didn\u2019t do anything. We did not go to work. We just sat,\nsitting there and most of the time we were standing outside being counted because they counted\nus in the morning and they counted us in the afternoon and we had to stand there and they had to\ncalculate whether everybody was there. They had to actually count because the dead ones, people\nwere put in the back of the block of the house. They went in the back and they counted the dead.\nAnd if the figures weren\u2019t right, they started counting again so we sometimes were standing there\nfor hours.",
        "Q: How supportive were the young women to each other?",
        "A: We made, you know, we made friends but you know you became friendly with the person\nwho lied next to you. To me this girl whom I never saw in my life and her name was Judy\nSeltzman and so she became my friend. And I mean I knew some other people from the \u2014 but\nwhat we did was, you know we didn\u2019t go to work so you spent the whole day in that house. And\nyou were sitting there and very often we were cooking. You know imaginary cooking. And\nacross from me there was a lovely lady. Her name was Mrs. Morgenstern. She was older. Her\nson was a very nice young man. And so we were making strudels and we were making all kinds\nof things and one would say my mother did this and another would say no, no, no. My mother\ndid that. And so we were cooking. And we also pretended to take a bath. How wonderful it\nwould be. Oh yes and I also want to tell you that young women, they\u2019re very conscious of\nhygiene. And we went into the bath house, every morning, got undressed and washed ourselves\ncompletely. It was cold water. We had no towels but we washed ourselves and, but you know we\ndidn\u2019t care we were naked because nobody could see us. It was such a, it was like a fog because\nfrom our warm bodies and that cold place, it was all foggy. You could hardly tell who was who.",
        "Q: Did you get your period in \u2014",
        "A: Well that was our luck. It is in a way. The period stopped because before that it was horrible.\nYou had nothing. It was just terrible. But now we are paying for it because most of people who\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nlose their period when they are young, you get osteoporosis much faster. Like the runners, the\npeople, the women who are runners. Actually they lose their period also. So one good thing, we\nlost the period.",
        "Q: How was that handled in Terezin?",
        "A: Yeah, well you know if you ask me what we did, I can\u2019t remember. Some things just escape\nyou. And probably \u2014I don\u2019t know. We probably took some, some pieces of cloth or something.\nI cannot, I don\u2019t want to make up any stories, because, but I can\u2019t remember exactly. I will not\ntell.",
        "Q: You said you were standing around because you weren\u2019t working.",
        "A: No, we weren\u2019t working. Anyway it came the seventh of March.",
        "Q: This is 44.",
        "A: Yes, 44. And they called out all the numbers from the previous, from the September\ntransport. And they had to line up until they had everybody. They moved them over to the camp\nA. We were B. And they put them in the camp B, A. And I saw my brother there. And I had a\npair of mittens and I called to him and I said would you like to have my mittens. I thought I\nwould throw them over the wire.",
        "Q: Had you had any contact with him before that in Auschwitz?",
        "A: Very. No, very little. I went to \u2014 after my mother died, I went on the way down, I stopped at\nhis block. He was in block 16, I believe.",
        "Q: Block 16 you say.",
        "A: I think so. I\u2019m not quite sure but I think it was. And I went, you couldn\u2019t go in. You had to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nsay you want to speak to \u2014 so I told the guy who was standing at the door and I said I\u2019d like to\nspeak to Hanush Epstein. And he called him and he came out and I told him that mother died.\nAnd he didn\u2019t stay one word to me. He just turned around and he walked away because he was\nso attached to her. And I never saw him very much because he was painting the chimney. But\neverybody knew him. He was a very beautiful child and people were just taken by him. And I\nnever thought so. That day you know he was on the other side. I saw him and I called to him and\nI said I have those mittens. Would you like those mittens. And he said to me where I am going I\ndon\u2019t need any mittens. And during the night from the seventh to the eighth they took them by\ntruck you know and they killed them all that night. And you could hear them singing. They were\nsinging. They were singing the Hatikvah. And they were singing the Czech national anthem.\nAnd so we knew that we had three more months to live. But as I told you, in the meantime they\nsent another I think 7,500 people to fill up the camp. And then one day there was rumor that\nthere\u2019s going to be a selection because as I said we never had a selection. That was end of June, I\nbelieve. You know because don\u2019t forget, we had no calendar. We, what we did is we made little\nmarks on our bunk and, to see how many more days we have to, you know til we die you know.\nKind of we scratched them out. And so if there were rumors because 1n camps there always are\nrumors and that there\u2019s going to be a selection. And sure enough, because Mengele used to work\nin our camp. He did his research on dwarves and twins in our camp.\nSo there came, you know there came the order that we have to line up. It was at the end of the\ncamp, like near the, near where the tracks are now. And you had to get undressed completely\nand you put your clothes on your right arm because the left arm had the numbers and so you\nwent one after the other. And Mengele decided who is going to live and who is going to die. And\nyou know fate is unbelievable and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so a fatalist. Because I suffered from psoriasis\nand just at that time I was completely free of it. I didn\u2019t have any blemish on my body and so\nwhen I went through so he chose me to live. Because he just moved with his thumb if you had\nknown what he was doing and they were at the, men they were watching. And when he made one\nsign you lived and they took you and they wrote down your number. And the ones he \u2014 destined\nfor death, they didn\u2019t need to write down the number. And so we didn\u2019t know what was going\non. And then we got dressed and we went back to our bunk.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to Mengele. Had you seen him before that day or was that the only time?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: No, we used to see him. He used to come to the camp.",
        "Q: And so you saw him before. Did you know who he was or what he \u2014",
        "A: Yes, we knew that was Dr. Mengele.",
        "Q: And did you know what he was doing, did you \u2014",
        "A: What he was doing. That he was doing. In our camp he was doing research on dwarves and\ntwins.",
        "Q: I\u2019m saying, but you knew that.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did you know that?",
        "A: Well you know, we knew a lot of stuff but \u2014",
        "Q: How did you get information?",
        "A: For instance we got information, there were young Polish boys who lived in the men\u2019s camp,\nin camp D. And they have the roofers. They were fixing the roofs of the houses and because\nthey could go from one camp to the other, they were very knowledgeable. They knew what was\ngoing on. And they would tell us all the news. And also there were the craziest thing is. You\nknow there was one camp that was all gypsies. That was the D camp. And the gypsies had better\nfood than we had. And they brought the food from the gypsy camp to the hospital to give it to the\npeople who were sick. Now that\u2019s sick, isn\u2019t it. You know you make, yes, people \u2014 but you bring\nfood from the gypsy camp to give people who are sick. I mean this is absurd isn\u2019t it. So they,\nbecause they were moving from one camp to the other, they knew all the \u2014 they knew the news\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nwhat was going on. They were like our postman. And so we knew a lot of things which were\ngoing on.\nAnd this also was the time already when all the H \u2014 they built the railroad into the camp because\nwhen we came it wasn\u2019t there. So they built that railroad so the trains could come straight into\nthe camp. And we saw these big rail -- these trains arriving every day. And the camp next to\nours, the C camp was empty but then started filling up with girls. And these were the Hungarian\ngirls who they left, kept alive. We would talk to them. I mean probably spoke German to them. I\ndon\u2019t remember because I don\u2019t know Hungarian. And we could kind of talk because the camp \u2014\nthe division was only wire so you saw what was going on next door and I mean we didn\u2019t go\nnear the wire, because the wire were electrified you know. You could touch it and off you went.",
        "Q: How did you keep yourself going? You had lost your mother and your brother and you\u2019re a\nyoung woman. How did you keep yourself going at that time?",
        "A: You had this, this tremendous will to live. You had to, you wanted to show them that, that\nyou are going to live. You are going to outlive them. And you did everything possible to stay\nalive. Like staying clean helped you, you know. And all, we were discussing all kinds of books\nand you know we were all very intelligent people so we were talking about Tolstoy and\nDostoevsky and Schiller and Goethe and all these things. We somehow wanted to, you know in\nHebrew say Doske [ph], you know what that means. We are going show you. We are going to\nlive. We will manage to survive. So anyway, so when he chose us the next day we were called,\nall our numbers were called out of the girls who were chosen. And we were marched to the\nwomen\u2019s camp and when we came to the women\u2019s camp, the orchestra was welcoming us. They\nplayed for us. But there is a book, this girl wrote a book about her being the conductor in the\nwomen\u2019s camp. Yes, she was conducting there and they are playing very nicely and we were\nmarching in. And they put us up in different bunks there. But the girl who was there, they didn\u2019t\nlike us because we had hair. We are the only prisoners whom they didn\u2019t shave. So already that\nwe were different. And so they already didn\u2019t like us. They were shaven because they, most of\nthem came 1942 from Slovakia and Poland so they were there already, this is 1944. So they were\nalready there a long time.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nAnd when we wanted to go for instance into the wash room you know to get washed. There was\na girl standing with the laboir [ph] and she, she let the water strike at us. I mean they didn\u2019t like\nus because they also knew already that we are not going to stay there. And can you imagine they\nbeing there since 1942. Now it\u2019s 1944. And that we are going to be shipped out and they just,\nthey were not. I can understand it. They were jealous of us. And so we were there a few days. I\ndon\u2019t know how long. I tell you what. I think it was the end of June and I think that we left a\nweek later. Now I have literature from Hamburg. And there they write that we arrived between\nthe 16\" and 17\" of July. But I think we came there sooner than that. I\u2019m not quite sure.",
        "Q: So you were sent to Hamburg?",
        "A: Yes so, so anyway so they put together, they divided us and they added to us some Hungarian\ngirls. And we were standing always in silence. They moved us around and we moved around\nbecause we wanted to be with certain girls and we didn\u2019t want to be divided and so on. So there\nwas always a big doing on and they didn\u2019t do anything to us. Anyway they divided us. Part of us\nwent to Hamburg and part of us went to Shtutthof [ph]. And they added some Hungarian girls\nbut I don\u2019t know if ever anybody told you that. Before we left we were examined internally.\nBecause perhaps we were hiding some gold or something. So and then we got brought to the\ntrain and when we were brought to the train and we saw that there were not only SS men but\nsoldiers. But first of all it was a relief that we left, we were going out of Auschwitz because\nnobody in their right mind ever could fathom that that would happen.\nSo they put us on the train and we were, again there was nowhere to sit you know. Just the train.\nBut we stopped quite often because there were air raids because we drove, we didn\u2019t know where\nwe were going. We drove through the whole of Germany from southern Poland we went all the\nway to Hamburg. So when we arrived at that place the next day and I do think it was my\nbirthday. And it wasn\u2019t the 16\" or 17\". I believe it was my birthday. And so we found out that\nwe were in Hamburg. And they put us up in a warehouse. I found out just a few years ago that it\nused to be a tobacco warehouse. Right now I have a picture of it because I told you, I got in\ntouch with Hamburg and they sent me pictures. I have pictures of all the places we were. And\nthere they write that we arrived between the 16\" and 17\" but I\u2019m quite sure we came there a little\nearlier. And it was clean. And the bunks were only two stories. Like one on upper and one lower\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nso that wasn\u2019t \u2014 before we had three stories. And they were smaller ones. Only about two\ntogether and we each had our own little bed, kind of. And the soup was better. And there was no\ngas chamber, you know. I mean we were in heaven.\nAnd but the first night the whole house started to shake and we didn\u2019t know what it was. It was\nan air raid. And some girls yelled to the others who were up there. Don\u2019t move. What are you\nmoving. The whole thing shakes. We had no idea that the bombs are falling all around us. And\nso we started going to work. At first they put us on a shift and I mean we went to different\nplaces. Mostly oil companies, we were cleaning up. You know that\u2019s what we were doing first,\nto clean up. But I remember they brought me to this place and my first job was to wash windows\nand I have said to the fellow, could I have some newspaper and he said what do you need\nnewspaper for? I said well to wash the windows you will see. And when I was finished they\ncouldn\u2019t believe it, what a good job I did. And we got a little better soup. And there were other\npeople working there but we found out later on were Dutch people and French people, not they\nweren't -- they were in work camps. And they were also working in these factories. To clean up\nafter the air raids, but you know just to clean up.\nAnd the air raids were continuous. During the night and during the day like we would go in the\nmorning and there were houses standing nicely and on the way back there was nothing. You\ncould see the bathtub was hanging on and the stove was on the other hand hanging there. I mean\nthey did a real good job I can tell you. And but the British knew and the Americans knew where\nwe were. That there were a group of women. They\u2019re not going to bomb us.",
        "Q: The warehouse.",
        "A: Where we stayed and even where we worked. And so we were there a few weeks. And I just\nfound from Hamburg, I got this literature and it says let me tell you. We went to place called\nNiue Graden and we arrived there on the 13\" of September and we left there on the 8\" of\nFebruary. So we were there the whole winter. We went to work. People worked all over, but my\ngroup went to work in a sand pit because they built little houses because don\u2019t forget the people\nof Hamburg, they had nowhere to live. And so we were building little houses and so I was in a\ngroup where we\u2019re working in a sand pit. And so we each got a shovel and started shoveling the\nsand and we had a little train that you know little wagons and they put sand there. And we had a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nforeman who was an old German, skinny guy who was very decent. And he saw that I seemed to\nbe a good worker. And it\u2019s funny when they see that you are a good worker, they always kind of\nfind you a good job. So he stopped me and he said you are going to be the switcher. So I became\nthe switcher on the train and you know there was a fellow who was the driver of the train and I\nwas the switcher. And the driver, he was a communist and he had to go to the police, I believe\nevery night or once a week so that he didn\u2019t run away or something like that. But the air raids\nwere unbelievable and so when the air raids were, the thing was we had to watch out where the -\n- it was called flak. That anti-aircraft. You know it splinters, it splinters and if that caught you,\nyou were dead. So when the train, when these little wagons were empty we would turn them\nupside down. We could do that and we would hide under, yes and you could hear ping, ping,\nping, you know how these things are falling on it. So we were there for a while until I told you til\nthe second, til the eighth of February. And then they moved us again.\nOh by the way, Niue Graden it\u2019s today a shopping center. And I had a friend. Her name was\nRuth Pinchovsky and she, that name afterwards oh she married a fellow, Fayon and you know\nshe was fighting with Hamburg that they shouldn\u2019t allow to put a shopping center there. But\nanyway, I have a picture of the shopping center, a part of the shopping center and there is a tablet\nwhere it says that we were there. That\u2019s what I read from.\nAnd anyway so they moved us to a place called Tiesstack on the eighth of February right.",
        "Q: How do you spell that?",
        "A: Tiesstack, T-I-E-S-S-T-A-C-K. And I was chosen to work right outside of camp. I was\nmaking big bricks with holes you know. Like I had a helper. She was mixing the cement with a\nstone and then I would put it in the form and bang it down and make it so solid and then you put\nout this form. You lift it out and you had this brick. But you had to work hard otherwise it would\nfall apart. And then somebody came and they put it in the, it would be dried and they would\nmake new houses. And it\u2019s a strange thing. I remember most everything but I could not tell you\nwho was living with me in that room where I was. What it was like. They sent me from\nHamburg a picture of that place. It doesn\u2019t say anything to me. I remember that there was a\ndining hall which was a long hall and I remember exactly where I was working. But I couldn\u2019t\nremember that place what it looked like or who was with me. Because very shortly after that one\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nday we went from work, which was around, I say you know that it was in, still in February but\nnobody wants to believe me. We went from work and we were standing to go in and as we were\nstanding the siren sounded and they told you that the flyers were already crossing the Channel\nand that was called a full alarm. And we told the guard who was a soldier and he was a nice guy.\nHe was a decent guy. He was kind of heavy rotund and we called him puppy and we said puppy\nlook, there\u2019s an air raid. Can\u2019t we go in. and he says you know I cannot let you go in because you\nhave to be counted.\nAnd as we were standing there it became a full alarm. That meant the flyers really are already\nover the city and the bombs started to fall. And it killed puppy but of course he wasn\u2019t killed by\nthe bomb but he was quite killed by the flak. The girl next to me, her name was Tuli Klasa, she\nwas killed and I started running like crazy to the dining hall. And to this day nobody wants to\nown up whose plane it was. Do you know? They used to fly over us. It was in the spring of 45,\nwhen they were bombing Dresden to hell. So they were going over us every day. And because\nnear us was a power station and this was like you know at that time radar didn\u2019t work so well.\nBut this was a point they knew they had to fly over in order to go to the, on the way to Dresden.\nAnd, but the camp was gone and because the camp was gone, they had to move us. And they left\nus there a few days. There was like a factory and we were sleeping there on some benches or\nwhatever it was. More outside. Because also luck was that we were the only ones who were in\ncamp. The others, because it was early like must have been 4:30 so the girls still didn\u2019t come\nback from work. They worked outside of camp except we were near the camp. Yet nobody,\nonly a few people was hurt and a few people was killed. Otherwise everybody would have been\ngone. And it was one plane which went in, got into trouble and had to let go. In order to save the\nplane and themselves they had to get rid of the bomb. And they fell on us. And I tried to find out\nabout this plane. I wrote to a number of war museums in England and they don\u2019t know anything\nabout it. I wrote to the war museum in Washington and there was such a clever guy who said\nsent me back an email. I should go to my home office. Like Montreal would be in the United\nStates and I could go to the office. He had no idea what I was talking about. So til this day\nnobody wants to own up and I went to the war museum in Ottawa and I spoke to an officer and I\nsaid I\u2019d like to know what happened to that plane because the camp was gone and because the\ncamp was gone, we were moved to Bergen Belsen. And there half of the girls who would have\nsurvived died there of typhoid. So anyways after a few days we went to the train and as we were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nwaiting for the train there was an air raid. We were sitting there on the grass and we just didn\u2019t\nmove. I mean we are not afraid of air raids. And we couldn\u2019t go anywhere because \u2014 and then the\ntrain came and they put us on the train and early in the morning we arrived. We didn\u2019t know\nwhere it was. And we had to carry some jackets or something. Air force, it was heavy like hell.\nAnd we schlepped it to this camp and then we arrived in the morning.",
        "Q: What day was this, do you know?",
        "A: That I don\u2019t know. I am saying the things that I am saying but nobody wants to corroborate it\nwith me that it was sometimes in end of February. And they said it isn\u2019t so but my figure I\u2019m\nsure it\u2019s so. And when we arrived they had a block there and there was nothing. There were no\nbunks no nothing and we had to lie on the floor and it was terrible because one was lying on top\nof the other and when you had to go the bathroom you had to step one bathroom. The toilet\ndidn\u2019t work and we had no water. We had no toilet. There was nothing. It was complete chaos\nthere. I mean most of the people were dead. It was typhoid was \u2014",
        "Q: This is Bergen Belsen you\u2019re talking about.",
        "A: Bergen Belsen yes. It was horrendous. We hardly got anything to eat and water was, there\nwas no water. As I told you, the toilets didn\u2019t -- I mean you couldn\u2019t even go. You know we\nwent around the houses. It was terrible because \u2014 it was just awful.\nAnd then one day there was a huge tent. And we didn\u2019t know the tent was full of corpses. And\nthey made us drag those corpses to a mass grave because they wanted you know, they knew that\nthey had to, that they\u2018re going to lose so they wanted to clean it up kind of. So we did that and\nwhen, certain hours they said enough and so we just dropped the corpse and went back and you\nsaw like a row of corpses lying there and you know you become so not feeling. You know you\nbecome so nothing. You know, you know that it\u2019s goes on, this is what you\u2019re going to be like\nand you fight on.\nAnd then the Germans ran away. And then they brought in Hungarian soldiers. And they didn\u2019t\ngive us anything to eat either. So we went, tried to find some food and the Germans had storage.\nYou know they stored potatoes and turnips and things like that under straw. Like earth and straw\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nand it was like, like big graves you know but a huge thing. So we went there to dig it up and\nthese damned Hungarians they started shooting and they killed girls. And you know what, it\u2019s a\nfunny thing. I\u2019m the only one who remembers that. When you will read anything about Tiesstack\nthey don\u2019t talk that Hungarians were there, but they were there. Anyway and then they left. And\nthen there was no one. There were just a few of us who still were able to walk around. And they\nwere (sound skip) including myself and we felt that Red Cross must be coming. You know\nsomebody must be coming so we wanted to prepare for that. We found a little table. Believe you\nme it was a little table. And it was hard for us to carry that little table.\nWe carried it on the main road to the entrance of the camp. And as we were standing at the\nentrance somebody started shooting at us and the girl next to me was shot at but the bullet went\ninto \u2014 she had a blouse with a, with a pad and it went into the pad, but nothing happened to her\nand as we were standing there a huge tank arrived with a white star. Who the hell knew what it\nwas? You know we have no idea what it was. And then the turret opened and there was this\nyoung man and he said that the division of all the allies came to liberate us. He said it in\nGerman. Atdalem Aleit Mezhde [German expression \u2014 ph] he said and they started driving in\nand the soldiers came walking. And I spoke a little English already at that time. And he told, the\nfirst thing he told me is that Roosevelt died. Because Roosevelt died on the 12\" and we were\nliberated on the 15\".\nAnd I like an idiot was crying. I never cried throughout my whole three years but I cried. So\nnow when I give a lecture, | tell the children that I am ashamed of my tears because Mr.\nRoosevelt could have saved thousands of Jews and he didn\u2019t do anything so that\u2019s why I\u2019m\nashamed of my tears.\nAnyway so this British army came in. This was the first camp they liberated and they saw the\nhorror because most people were dead and there were thousands of them. And they got in touch\nwith their head office and the first thing they did, they put up showers. So at least we could get\nwashed. And there was a town not far from where we were. It was called Bergen, which was an\narmory town. Of course the German soldiers were not there anymore and that they changed into\na hospital town. And they tried to take us all the sick people first so I was, you know I wasn\u2019t\nsick. I was walking around. So you should have seen. They put down on the ground, the\nsoldiers put down a stretcher. Before you knew there were ten naked ladies lying there because\nyou were not allowed to take any of their clothes because it was full of lice. Right.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nAnyway so I was one of the last ones going out. And we\u2019re coming to Bergen and there was a\nsquare and I was put up with some other girls in one of these buildings. And there was a kitchen\nand I don\u2019t know how smart I got, said \u2019'm going to go and work in the kitchen. So I worked in\nthe kitchen. And I stole some butter and I put it in my chest and I ran home because I wanted to\nbring it to the girls butter. And before I came it was running down. Anyway, so then the Red\nCross started coming and they had clothes for us because after all we had nothing and I got a\nleather jacket. It was an old leather jacket, but it was a leather jacket. I got Eisenhower jacket.\nYes, oh yes, but my director on our own before we were liberated, there was nobody, we\ncouldn\u2019t walk around and there were warehouses. You have no idea what the Germans had\nwarehouses full of what do you call it, attach\u00e9 cases. You know these leather attach\u00e9 cases that\nofficers always used and you see films, they always had these attach\u00e9. A whole building full of\nattach\u00e9 cases. A whole building full of jackets, flyers. You know for the air force. Beautiful\njackets. And then there was old clothes and all kinds of junk. And I found myself a pair of pants.\nIt was they were huge. So I put a, I think some kind of a just string around it because I weighed\n46 pounds at that time.",
        "Q: 46 pounds?",
        "A: Yes. And I\u2019m five, eight.",
        "Q: You\u2019re five, eight and you weighed 46 pounds.",
        "A: And anyway I found those pants and then I found the leather jacket. Not, the Red Cross\ndidn\u2019t give me, there I found a leather jacket. And so the Red Cross there and when we were\nliberated they tried to give us clothes and so on. And then the British soldiers were very nice.\nAnd there was a movie house and you only were allowed to go to a movie if you had an escort.\nAnd you had to go with a soldier. And I found myself a soldier and his name was Goldberg and\nhe says he was Jewish and that he came from Edinburgh, Liverpool, I don\u2019t remember what.\nSomewhere. And he became my friend, kind of. And they said when they said if we know of any\npeople you want to write to, you could. So I raised my hand and they said you want to write to\nsomeone. I said yes. I have an uncle in Canada and they said but do you know his address. I said\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\ndamn well I know the address. And that is, 12, it\u2019s 1448 Bishop Street Montreal. And they\nlooked like I was nuts. You know how could I remember an address in Canada. So I did write\nhim a letter and my uncle got it. It was the first letter arrived from someone who was in a\nconcentration camp and I believe it was even published in a newspaper. And so my uncle knew\nthat I was alive. And after \u2014",
        "Q: Can I ask you this first? When you realized you were liberated, did you have any emotional\nfeeling? Did it mean anything?",
        "A: Oh wow. That\u2019s all I can say. Yeah I mean it was unreal. It was absolutely unreal but the\nthing was that we had so many friends who were sick and we tried to find them. And to find\nsomeone because there were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them lying in these places\nthere. I had a lady how she got through, how Mengele didn\u2019t take her was unbelievable. She was\nmuch older and she was, looked older, she had hardly any teeth. And not a nice looking woman\nbut heart of gold. She would do the dirtiest work and she would get a little extra soup and she\nwould give me a little bit, bread or a little something you know to help me. So I went looking\nfor her. It took me days to find her amongst, you know because there were no lists. You only\nwent from bed to bed to bed to bed. And I did find her and she told me you know what. I have a\nson in Czechoslovakia and he, she told me where he lived and his name and after the war, I did\nfind him. And he got her though. I never saw her again but anyway \u2014",
        "Q: Was there any, did you have any sense of celebration when you were liberated? Did you feel -",
        "A: Oh we celebrated. I can tell you. We had party. Yes, even dancing.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. You know we had, there were young men and the soldiers. And the funny thing\nwas there were some French Canadians. They said they\u2019re from Canada. They spoke French.\nYou couldn\u2019t understand it. How come they spoke French in a flyer. And also \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "Q: You did feel liberated? Truly liberated?",
        "A: OhI mean it was something, you can\u2019t describe it. That you made it, you know. You are the\nones who made it. These horrible people couldn\u2019t get you down. And you really made it. And\nSO \u2014",
        "Q: Then you were talking about your relative in Montreal.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you wrote to him and he got the letter?",
        "A: Yeah, he got the letter. And we were allowed to go into the villages you know so we went\ninto the villages and we didn\u2019t set the houses on fire and we didn\u2019t beat anybody up. And we\nwere so happy to be alive that we just went into the houses. We looked around and we didn\u2019t\nsteal anything. It was amazing that it didn\u2019t occur to us that we would take anything. And this 1s\nwhat I tell the young people that here we were and who, they did such terrible things and we\nwent into the villages and we didn\u2019t do anything to anybody. We didn\u2019t steal. We didn\u2019t burn\ndown the houses. We just looked in awe to all these things. And then I remember we had a big\nparty on the square and we were kind of dancing and so on. Anyway, there was a girl whom I\nknew already from my Zionist days and she said that her h, she got in touch with her husband\nand he\u2019s coming. And she will go home with him. And so I said to her, Eva, can I go with you.\nShe said sure. So I went with her. And then Ruth Bondy, you might know the name. She\u2019s a\nwriter. She lives in Israel. She went with us on that. So we went on that rickety track and we\ndrove through whole of Germany. Hamburg all the way to the Czech border. That\u2019s a long way.\nAnd we came there and we went into the inn and they didn\u2019t know what to do with us. They\nwere so happy for us. And the next day we drove to the Czech border. We got off the truck and\nwe stood there and we sang the Czech national anthem.\nAnd then we drove into Prague. And this young man with whom I\u2019m still friends he said ok girls.\nThis is Slatege [ph], and this girl who was my friend, I called her Chinda. I didn\u2019t know her.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nOrkin was her name but we call her Chinda. And the two of us, we looked at each other and we\nsaid so where we are going. So there was a young woman standing there and she saw that we\ndidn\u2019t have where to go. She said what are you going to do girls? And we said we don\u2019t know.\nShe said you know what. I got my apartment back. I even find my husband. You can come to us.\nSo she and she left and she gave me the address. And she left and I knew exactly where it was.\nAnd so the two of us you know we traveled very light.\nWe didn\u2019t have a penny to our names. We did have a few clothes you know. Not much but a\nlittle something. And we went on the street car and we had no money so a soldier paid for us and\nthat\u2019s how I started my life again.",
        "Q: And so you stayed in Prague for how long?",
        "A: Well since I got in touch with my uncle, I did not want to stay in Czechoslovakia and I came\nto Canada in 49. Even then it took four years for me to get a visa.",
        "Q: What did you do in those four years that you \u2014",
        "A: Oh so I had a very good friend in Terezin. He was my boyfriend but it was a really girl boy,\nnot, not lovers. He was a very good boy and he said and again I have to emphasize that all what\nwe needed to know, we had to memorize and so he gave me his mother\u2019s name because his\nfather went illegally to Palestine. In 1940. And gave me his mother\u2019s name and her address.\nAnd so when I came to Prague and first of all we had to, to go to eat we went to habitat. You\nknow a Catholic charity. And to the nuns we went. The nuns fed us lunch. We were lined up.\nThere were people from all over the place. And I came with my leather jacket and next to me\nthere were two young men and they said would you like to barter it for a coat and I said yeah\nsure, if you have a nice coat. So they said ok tomorrow for lunch, you come and we bring you\nthe coat. So they came and I gave them my jacket and they gave me the coat.\nAnd so I started looking for this lady and when I came to the address, the super told me that they\nmoved and he gave me the address but there was a building in the center of Prague where all the\npeople like me would gather. And they would tell us, give us information where we could get a\nlittle money and how we could get food and so on. And in the foyer there were pictures and they\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nsaid this is my brother. He was there. This is my mother. She was there. And amongst the\npictures I found the picture of this young man, my friend. I knew already that he is not back yet.\nAnd so I went to his family and I told them who I was and they were very kind to me. And the\ngentleman already knew that he was not alive, but the mother still didn\u2019t know. She still was\nwaiting for him. He died in Buchenwald in January 45. And so if they would ask me to come for\nmeals and I would go there for meals and then they realized that he\u2019s not coming back so and I\nsaid I don\u2019t have anybody and I told them that I have an uncle in Canada, that I want to go to\nCanada. I won\u2019t stay.\nAnd so they took me in. And I lived with them and the gentleman was very practical and he said\nto me, since you want to go to Canada you better go and start learning English so I was, since I\nhad somewhere to stay. It didn\u2019t cost me anything and I went to, 1t was called the Institute for\nmodern languages. And I went every day and by the end of the year the, like you know winter,\nin the fall and the spring. I wrote my university exam and then I looked for a job.\nAnd he thought that he would open a little store for me like a flower shop. Is that he would\nfinance it and I would be running it. And nothing came of it. And then he had a friend who\nopened a store and they hired me. You know what I had for sale? Three bales of clothes. That\nwas my inventory and one day I came and somebody broke in. So that was the end of my job.\nAnd I went to the Jewish community and I got a job which was a horrible job. Back in the place\nwhere I was once, where I lived it was above the synagogue. There was a big hall and there were\nclothes brought back from Terezin which was a horrible thing. And we went through them and\nput them like the better ones aside and so with people like me could get some clothes.\nAnd also we had the divisions from America. People from America sent, were sending parcels\nand so we had there and there were blankets. They were not wool blankets but there are blankets.\nAnd you know what, we stole them, a lot of them. And I had from one of the blankets made a\ncoat. It was, it\u2019s made of blankets. It was a brown and I had a beautiful brown winter coat. And I\ndidn\u2019t stay there too long. And I was hired to work in the, we had a newspaper which is now\nIresh Chodesh. At that time it was called the Biesnik [ph]. And I was working there with a lady.\nWe did the addresses you know. We had little plates and we put the addresses on and I also was\n\u2014 would retype the articles people wrote by hand and I would type them so the proofreader had\nan easier time to do that.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nBut what happened was my mother\u2019s cousin whom I called uncle was brought back from Israel\nand he became chief rabbi of Prague. And his name was Gustav Sicher so you know I was kind\nof a high ranking (both talking) there. And one day I went downstairs and I met a man and the\nman knew that I knew English and he said listen I have a good job for you. Would you like to\nwork for this American Joint. I said well, why not? So he sent me there. I had to go and I worked\nfrom the American Joint and my salary was twice what I had and I didn\u2019t have much work. I\nfilled out little pieces of paper and I went to the bank to get thousands of dollars because in order\nto emigrate, you had to pay in dollars. Now we provided the people with dollars. And so I\nwaited til \u2014 yes, and my visa didn\u2019t come through. It took you know four years. And they were\nlooking for girls in Australia. There was a shortage of young girls. So I had a relative who was\nworking in immigration for the Jewish community. And she says you know what. Why don\u2019t\nyou make out an application for a visa for you? You know you\u2019re not getting the visa to Canada\nso you might as well try to go to Australia. And one day I got the visa for Australia and the next\nday I got the visa for Canada. So I didn\u2019t go to Australia. That\u2019s too far away.",
        "Q: So then you went to Canada?",
        "A: I came to Canada to my uncle. Yes and he always wrote to me that I should learn to become\na hair \u2014 he had a hair dressing salon that I should learn to be a manicurist or something like that\nand I would tell him yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean well I knew that I didn\u2019t want to do that. Anyway\nso, but he paid for my fare and I went by train to Belgium to Ostend and from Ostend I went to\nDover.\nAnd then by train I went to London and this relative who said I should apply to, for Australia.\nShe had friends and she told them that I was coming. And she went with me on the train to \u2014 she\nwanted I should smuggle through for her a ring. And I refused. I said on account of a ring I\u2019m\nnot going to be put in jail. I\u2019m sorry. I cannot do that. But these people waited for me at the\nstation in London. And the first thing they asked me was I brought Czech salami. I did have\nsome Czech salami. And they lived in St. John\u2019s woods. How do you like how I remember all\nthat?",
        "Q: Wonderful. How long did you stay in London?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: Well just a week. I wanted to see London before I go to --. So I came to St. John\u2019s Wood and\nthey, the first thing they offered me was I want a rum and coke. What did I know what the rum\nand coke was? I said yes. So I took a few sips and then they told me that the apartment was too\nlittle, that I cannot stay with them there. They arranged for me to stay somewhere else.",
        "Q: Then you got to Montreal?",
        "A: Just one second. I went, they put me up in a hostel from the Jewish community. It was like\nback being in Terezin. It was a huge hall for women and underneath that was a huge hall for\nmen and the food was served on metal plates, just like camp. It was such a shock to me. You\nhave no idea. And I had a cake in my valise and there was a little boy and he knew that I had\nthis cake and during the night he would say mademoiselle, gateau, mademoiselle s\u2019il vous plait,\ngateau. He was from Egypt. Because at that time the Jews from Egypt and India who wanted to\ngo to Palestine had to go through London. So these were the people who I stayed with.\nAnd but I wanted to see London so I took off in the morning and by myself but on the way back I\nalways had problems. Obviously some man would follow me. Because it was in Old Gate East\nwhich 1s a very bad part of London. That\u2019s where the London Tower is. And I was smart. I said\nto a policeman I would, would you please take me home because I am being bothered by a man\nwhere they don\u2019t leave me alone and that\u2019s how I managed to go out and go back in and so on.\nAnd then I took a train to Liverpool and I went on the Empress of France where I was deathly\nsick to Canada.",
        "Q: And then what did you do in Canada?",
        "A: Well I, yes and all these ladies who were on the train, on the boat were there. Mothers of war\nbrides you know. I was deathly sick and they took me to the doctor and since my name was\nEpstein, he said to me oh you must be a relative of Sir Jacob and I happened to know just by\naccident because I always was interested in art I happened to know that he was a famous\nsculptor. And I said yes, of course. And I was, I got better treatment kind of. And so they always\nsaid how will you know your uncle? I said I don\u2019t know. So we come to Montreal and \u2019'm\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nstanding up there on the boat and I look down and I said there he is. That\u2019s my uncle. Yes.\nAnyway that\u2019s how it was.",
        "Q: So you got to Montreal and then you met your husband just very quickly.",
        "A: I was married in 1950.",
        "Q: Was he from Europe or was he from \u2014",
        "A: He came from Lithuania in 1923. His family, his father was here before the First World War\nand then he came, he went back. No, before the turn of the century I must say.",
        "Q: And his first name?",
        "A: His name was Sidney.",
        "Q: Sidney Ivry. Did you have a family, did you have children?",
        "A: At the beginning we couldn\u2019t have children so I adopted a girl. She was 17 months old. Her\nname is Elsa and then four years later I became pregnant and I had a son and his name is Victor.\nBut Elsa is not very nice and she doesn\u2019t talk to me now. She is 60 years old and she has two\nchildren and they have, I have two grandchildren from her and five great grandchildren but I\ndon\u2019t see them. Anyway that happens. What can you do? And my son has three daughters and he\nlives in California. He lives in Orinda, just outside of San Francisco.",
        "Q: Can I ask you some questions, just general questions now?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Just to finish up. Did you work when you \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: When I came here yes, I worked. In, but first in the beauty parlor which I despised because\nthe ladies who came there, there were real bosquey type and they were talking about their birdies\nand their doggies and then after what I experienced, these things were so banal. And I told my\nuncle that I really didn\u2019t like it. So he knew somebody at Bell Telephone. You know Bell\nTelephone is a big company. And I was the \u2014 you know in Europe you learn how to do design,\nyou know construction. So I thought I could to draw plans and things like that. So I went there\nand I had to pass an exam. Everything was fine. I could answer everything except when it came\nto feets and ounces because after all I learned everything in the metric system and so I failed.\nAnd so I got a job in a, in an office where I did invoices. And that\u2019s where I met my husband.",
        "Q: Ok, let me ask you some general questions. What are your thoughts about Germany today?",
        "A: Well I say the people who were born after the war they are not responsible for it. I, I don\u2019t\nlike, when for instance I go to a store, not now it\u2019s not so obvious. But years ago I would stand in\nline and I would see a German, I would immediately turn around. And when I saw a person who\nwas about my age, I had very bad feelings, because I knew he must have been somewhere, you\nknow. And of course I, a friend of mine, he a little bit out there, but he says eventually\nforgive but one never forgets. I really don\u2019t forgive them either because for instance the guards\nin Auschwitz, nothing happened to them. They went home and they got married and they are\ngrandfathers now or whatever. Nothing happened. You know they caught the tops, but the\nregular soldiers there who did that dirty work and kicked us and beat us and helped us into,\npushed us into the gas chambers, he went home like nothing would have happened.",
        "Q: Did you tell your children your life story?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How old were they when you told them?",
        "A: OhI told them gradually. They always, first of all I had the number you know so I had to, I\ncouldn\u2019t say well I put it there for, for nothing you know. I had to tell them who put it there.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "Q: When your children were the age that you were during the war, did that bring back a lot of\nmemories for you?",
        "A: No. No. You know what. It\u2019s much worse now. Right now because I live by myself and I\u2019m\nnot well. It haunts me much more than before. When I was young I was busy, bringing up a\nfamily you know. You know having children and doing things and school work and all that. I\nbelonged to a Zionist organization. I belong to what do you call, Hadassah. I belonged to\nHadassah and I was very active. I was a president. I was a this and I was a that. And you know\nalways working for Israel. But the war years were pushed aside because I was busy living.",
        "Q: Do you feel that you\u2019re a different person? You would have been a different person today if\nyou hadn\u2019t gone through what you went through?",
        "A: Oh certainly.",
        "Q: In what way would you \u2014",
        "A: Well first of all I would have been a professional person because you can hear I\u2019m no\ndumbbell. And I would have become some, who knows what. And so my life would have been\ndifferent. And I wouldn\u2019t have been a different person as a person because that\u2019s what you are.\nWhether you know you are kind or miserable so I still, like I like to help people now. I\u2019m sure I\nwould have liked to help people then also. And but I would have been, I can tell I\u2019m sure I\nwould have been quite an outstanding person. I was very talented as far as art was concerned. I,\nwhen my children were small I took art classes and I went back to university. I took, my major\nwas don\u2019t laugh, German literature. And fine arts. But then when I tell it to somebody German\nbecause I think yes, I studied Thomas Mann and Heinrich Mann and Kafka and Heine and after\nall these are all Czech Jews. But Heine was not, but Rilke and so you know and I, I did\nextremely well. I finished with magna cum laude. And then I was teaching pre-school art for 13\nyears.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "Q: Is your husband still alive?",
        "A: No my husband died in 96.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry. And I understand that you do a lot of speaking to \u2014",
        "A: I used to. Right now you know I \u2014 yes I did it for 25 years. But I published a book. You have\nthe book now in the library because I sent you one.",
        "Q: And the name of your book?",
        "A: It\u2019s 1 Am Their Voice. I felt that six million people lost their voice so I tried to, a\npresumption on my part, but I thought that \u2014 and it\u2019s not about me. The book is not about me.\nit\u2019s quite different. It is letters, poems and drawings from children I spoke to. So it is, you know\nthere are so many books written about people. They write their stories and you know what, the\nsad part is nobody is reading it. Young people they are on their texting business you know. So\nmy book 1s different because it shows how young people really can feel with you, the\nunderstanding and, and want to, you know are really very sensitive. So if you will read it. The\npoems are outstanding. They are written by 12 year old kids and I couldn\u2019t write poems like\nthat. I had an idea that since I\u2019m not so well, it would have taken some time , to find somebody\nto put these poems to music. Maybe sometime somebody will do that because they\u2019re absolutely\nwonderful.",
        "Q: Are you angry that you had to go through what you did and have the losses that you have and\nother people your age living over here did not have to go through that? Are you angry about\nthat?",
        "A: No. No, no, no I\u2019m not angry about that. You know as I said I\u2019m a fatalist. You know it just\nhappens that I was born in Lichtenstein and I wasn\u2019t born in Washington, DC or I wasn\u2019t born in\nwho knows where.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",

        "A: All of the above.",
        "Q: All of the above.",
        "A: And yet I speak fluently Czech, even though my mother tongue is German. I probably speak\nbetter Czech than German now because I don\u2019t speak and I have a cleaning lady who speaks\nCzech so I speak Czech to her. And what nobody can get over is that I speak so well Czech\nwithout mistakes you know. Czech is quite a difficult language.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial? Do you remember?",
        "A: I saw Eichmann sometimes. He came to Auschwitz you know to inspect everything.",
        "Q: You did see him?",
        "A: Yes, well you know probably cause you know you were, he just was passing by kind of. And\nthe thing is of course, I was in Prague when Heydrich was killed.",
        "Q: Oh yes.",
        "A: And you know what they did because they knew that they on bicycles. So they woke you up\nin the middle of the night. The police came and said do you know how to ride a bicycle and I\nwould say yes. Do you own a bicycle? I said no. They look. And do you know what they did.\nAfter that they sent a thousand Jews right after Eichmann did that, a thousand Jews immediately\nto Poland to death. A thousand. And the funny part is that the initial of that transport is A, A, H\nand we call it Authentat of Heydrich. It just happened that way. Like Iam DS but that transport\nin May was A, A Ha, if you look at that it\u2019s a thousand people from Prague that went directly.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "Q: And were you aware of the town that was destroyed after Heydrich was killed? Lidice?",
        "A: Lidice, yes, we knew about Lidice. It\u2019s a terrible thing that Lidice and do you know that\nsome of the children from Lidice came to Terezin. And some of the children were small. I don\u2019t\u2019\nknow how many but I was told. I never saw them. And you know I had a gym teacher. We were\ntalking about did I remember teachers. His name was Fredy Hirsch.",
        "Q: Oh yes, well known. Yes.",
        "A: But he was my gym teacher. And do you know what happened. There came a transport of\nchildren and they put them not too far from Terezin. And because he was so fond of children he\nwent there to look what, how it\u2019s going and the SS found him there and that\u2019s how they sent him\nto Auschwitz. Otherwise he might have survived. And you know he committed suicide and\nFreddy he was such a fantastic guy. And you know he was gay but there was never ever any\nsuspicion that he would mistreat anybody. Never. And he was my gym teacher and all the war\nyears we went to gym and we had a place. It was the only place we could go which was of course\nHigibor and there we would be able to run and he had a table you know. He was standing on the\ntable. And he would be whistling so you know we were doing gym. He was so handsome.\nThere\u2019s a little book about him, a young girl who did a research. It was for her doctorate or\nsomething. She wrote about him. and I have this book. And you know Wexler, you know the\none who ran away. Yes, so they went to Fredy, already when the whole transport was in the A\ncamp. And they went to Fredy and say listen Fredy we really want to be make a, you know we\ndon\u2019t\u2019 want that we all go to hell tomorrow. Let\u2019s do a something. You know to disrupt the\nwhole thing.\nAnd he said to them, give me I don\u2019t know how many hours he gave them and they came back\nand he was dead. A doctor gave him some pills and he swallowed them and he died. He was such\na handsome man, but there was never any, any, anything that he would go after the boys. Never.\nAnd you know he looked after the children in Terezin. They had, as a matter of fact, today I send\nyou through the Holocaust center, ten year old kids wrote a newspaper and somebody gave me a\ncopy. It\u2019s not some of it is not very clear but anyway they made copies for me here at the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nHolocaust center and they send it to Michaela and you will be able to see it\u2019s like a newspaper.\nThe hand writing of these ten year old kids and yet and I went through all the lists because I have\nthe book from Terezin so I can tell when they were born and I can tell which transport.

        "Q: Are you more comfortable around other survivors?",
        "A: No, to me it doesn\u2019t make any difference but Hungarians bother me, sorry to say. You know\nbecause I left in 1938 my home and they left in 1944. They had six years to the good. They did\nto, they killed so many of them. And you know what when they tell the story, they say that\nwhen, that Mengele was the one who did the selection at the train so I always tease them. I said\ntell me, did he introduce himself or did he \u2014 how did you know he was Mengele because there\nwere so many other SS men who did the selection. But they say because that\u2019s the name they\nknow.

        "A: Yes. It doesn\u2019t have to happen to the Jews. It can happen to another, to another nation that\nthere is crazy guy and says all these people are no good. But we Jews have a \u2014 but they can\u2019t get\nrid of us you know. We are here a long time and there are so many pogroms, and so many, so\nmany things they\u2019ve done to us and we are still here. I believe that the Jews in Bohemia are\nSpanish Jews. And my family are Spanish Jews because if you would see the pictures of my aunt\nand you would say my goodness, gracious. Look at them, big black eyes and the huge black hair\nand I have \u2014 on one side my family, from my grandfather\u2019s side, I can go back to 1752. And the\nother one to 1715. And as a matter of fact, I was telling Michaela that there is book out,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\ninteresting author, written by a woman by the name of Butchkova, about the Jews in my area.\nAnd the first ones arrived there in 16 something. So I wrote to her an email and I thought you\nknow to thank her for all the work she did for all the digging and uncovering all these facts about\nall the Jews. And she\u2019s not Jewish. But one thing I want to know is where did they come from?\nAnd I also was at the main archives in Prague and where they did research for me and they said\nthat my family they can date back to 1715. But where they came from, they cannot tell.",

        "Q: Do you feel more Jewish because of what you went through? Do you think that your\nexperience made you feel more \u2014",
        "A: No, no I was very Jewish to begin with. My mother was very Jewish. Yes. Oh yes. You\nknow we always like for instance, when my children were small I, when I went to synagogue, I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nalways walked and it wasn\u2019t around the corner and it was in honor of my mother because when\nwe went to our little synagogue, we had to go through woods and fields and meadows and we\nalways walked you know. The only thing on Yom Kippur when Admile, the fellow who looked\nafter the horses, he came there with the horses to take us home, but my mother would never\nwalk. Would never drive, never. And so I did the same thing. I always walked with my children\nto shul. And my children went to a Jewish school. My son spoke very well Hebrew. And he\nstudied Tenach and all that. Yes.\nBut you know now he\u2019s far away and he\u2019s 1n a surrounding which 1s not very Jewish. He does go\non the holidays to a temple. Because the woman he married, they belong to temple. As a matter\nof fact my son where he worked after 28 years, I was sick and he got divorced. Everything at the\nsame time. It was very hard on me.",
        "Q: Do you feel that you\u2019re two different people because of what you went through \u2014 someone on\nthe inside and different than the one on the outside.",
        "A: No. No, no. I never hide who I am. I, you know, this is who I am. I had the misfortune to\nlive in Europe in a horrible time and but I\u2019m a fatalist and it was my fate that I didn\u2019t have\npsoriasis and Mengele chose me to live and otherwise I would have been dead a long time ago.\nAnd right now I\u2019m sick and I\u2019m very much alone and that is worse than anything else you can\nimagine.\nI am always by myself and I have a friend whom I played bridge twice a week and he\u2019s getting\non and he\u2019s now 92. And he is now in a residence, but in a very beautiful residence. And I phone\nhim and he cries. He doesn\u2019t stop crying. He says you know what. When I was young I did all\nthese things and now this, it doesn\u2019t leave me and I\u2019m just a wreck. And so it comes back more\nthan before. It haunts us much more. And this is the bad part. And you see, a person like you can\nunderstand it. But how could you tell that to your neighbor. You know how would they know\nwhat you feel like. So you are there and you just, you have to keep on fighting. And hoping that\nyou are not going to die by yourself. That\u2019s all I\u2019m worried about.\nI have a lifeline so but the thing is that I still try to, as a matter of fact, now I\u2019m doing research\non Mrs. Albright. Mrs. Albright lies. You know that I met her cousin.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes, I met her cousin in, Dasha, I met her cousin in 1998 I believe because this friend of\nmine whom I told you. He was in Prague at the same time and he was standing in a hotel and I\nphoned him and he says come on over. I have a visitor here. Come on over. So I went to the\nhotel and her cousin Dasha was there and we talked, you know but nothing much. You know like\nvisiting in a hotel. You talk about the city or whatever it was. Because he comes from the same\ntown as Dasha, and he knew her as a young girl and her parents. Her father was their family\ndoctor. And so he says I have to go now. He says I have to go now too \u2014 and so she left and we\nwent downstairs and we crossed the Mensa square and I said to her, tell me, how can she say that\nshe didn\u2019t know she was Jewish. So she said to me, my mother, her daughter said, mommy when\nshe looks in the mirror, doesn\u2019t she see who she is? You know. I tell you. I cannot understand it.\nShe came back to Prague in 1947. That means she was ten years old. Her cousin Dasha who was\nolder came back at the same time from England and her cousin Dasha, her parents weren\u2019t there.\nThey were all killed. And her grandparents. Didn\u2019t she ask what happened to uncle so and so? I\nmean even you are ten years old. You know the bad person is her father. I hate him because he\nwas such a bureaucrat. He didn\u2019t want that anything should interfere with his climb. He wanted\nto become ambassador. You know being a Jew he was afraid. Maybe they wouldn\u2019t promote him\nyou know. So they all became, they all were baptized in England. I mean she\u2019s such a smart\nwoman.\nNot only that, she was teaching history so didn\u2019t she teach history what was going on in Europe.\nDidn\u2019t she know? I mean how could, if I would meet her I would say Mrs. Albright you are such\na smart person but you are such a damn liar.\nAnyway what I am doing now research on, in her books, if you seem to have the book, on page\n276 there is an article, by (sound skip) by the name of Eugena Smolkova that she was in\nAuschwitz and she was pulled out by an SS man and that\u2019s how she survived. You know went to\nHamburg. This is a bloody lie. Because we were not, we were not in the showers, we were\nselected in the camp. And when she arrived she went to Niue Graden which is a lie too because\nwe went from Auschwitz, we went first to Hamburg, Freihaven, and then we went to Niue\nGraden. So the whole thing doesn\u2019t make sense. And not only that, you know I have the book\nwhere everybody is listed who went to camps, to, from Terezin right?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I cannot find her. They cannot find her in beit Terezin so we don\u2019t know who she 1s. She\nwrites there that no, that she, her daughter is working for a Mrs. Albright. So I told your friend\nMichaela, I said why don\u2019t you ask this daughter which transport she went to Auschwitz.\nBecause we cannot find her. Her name is Eugena Smolkova. We cannot find her anywhere. So\nthis is my latest thing and I want to write to the publisher. And I don\u2019t want to say they should\nchange it now, but in case there\u2019s a reprint. Either you leave the whole thing out or say the truth\nhow it is, because Eugena Smolkova can\u2019t be found to go to Auschwitz.",

So we, so on the\nholidays we went to a next, to a next door village and there was a synagogue but soon after there\nwere not enough people so we didn\u2019t, we stopped going there and we stopped going, we started\ngoing to another one in another village and that was called Sheruby [ph]. And there we went to\nthe synagogue on the holidays. We kept the holidays.",
        "A: Well we baked our own and you know we - it\u2019s very funny. Your friend Michaela asked me\nhow I called the bread for Shabbat, the challah and I would say we called it barsay [ph] and she\nsaid yes, that\u2019s how they called it.",
        "A: Yes. My mother had the store opened but I wasn\u2019t allowed to do anything. I liked to do, when\nI was a little girl I liked to do handicrafts and she would never allow me to do any handicraft.\nShe would say you have the whole week. You can do things, but on Shabbat you don\u2019t do that.",
        "A: No it was a little village of 80 houses.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: There were, there were two other Jewish families.",
        "A: Well the one was an older couple and the younger one they had one child. And he was born\nprobably in 1935 or something. But he was a small baby that I remember him.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. I went to a public school.",
        "A: But you know this was only a village school. It had only four classes for eight grades. And\nwhen I finished my fifth grade, my mother felt that I was a smart girl, that I should go to high\nschool. So she inquired the next city to our, where we were was called Pilsen, Michaela comes\nfrom and so she went to a school a German school and the principal said I have to write a little\nexam which I did.\nAnd I went there to school but even so it only was 18 kilometers from our village. I couldn\u2019t do\nthat. You know there was no transportation and the horse and buggy I couldn\u2019t do that twice a\nday. So my mother found a family where I was boarding. That means when I was 12 years old, I\nalready left home. But you know I used to go to school and give lectures on the Holocaust and I\nwould tell the children that at 12 years of age, I would be already on my own and they said oh\nhow horrible. And I would say well it wasn\u2019t so horrible. I became very self-sufficient and I had\nto look after myself and I felt very important.\nAnd well I was taught from when I was very young to be self-sufficient. My mother would send\nme on a train when I was six years old to visit an uncle and aunt who had no children in southern\nBohemia. And I wasn\u2019t afraid at all. They put me on the train and I was the whole day on the\ntrain and on the other side my uncle would be waiting for me and I had absolutely no fear. You\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nknow when you grow up in a village, it is different like in the city because in the village you\ndon\u2019t have \u2014 well we did have burglars, they burgled our store but I wasn\u2019t afraid. First of all\nthere was maybe one or two cars and one of them was when our doctor from the next village.\nAnd he came through the village like a crazy guy so you\u2019d say go away, go away quickly\nbecause the gonzerit [ph] is coming. You know even the chickens and the geese were running\naway on the street. You know in front of our house was a pond. And as children we would go\nswimming there. Nobody taught us. We just went in the water and started first with one leg down\nand then we just lifted the other leg and that\u2019s how we were swimming.\nAnd in winter it froze over and we would be skating on it. But I was, I didn\u2019t have a really\nproper skate. My mother had a pair of skates. Can you imagine from the turn of the century.\nThey were iron skates and you attached them to your shoes you know like you had a key and you\nhad to turn it. And I would put them on in front of our house and by the time I was at the pond I\nlost them about three times. But my brother, he was very good at it and he won the special skate\nand he told my mother you buy me, Kanotski [ph]. And these are already good skates and they\nhad little, like little teeth in the front. And as a matter of fact one day he fell into the water.\nBecause we had inns and the inns would take the ice from the pond, from the summer so that the\nbeer would be cold in their cellar. And overnight it would freeze over and let\u2019s say there was a\nlittle snow so you couldn\u2019t tell where they took out the snow, the ice. And one day my brother\ncrossed the pond and he fell in and we were standing in the window, my mother and I. We were\nabsolutely going crazy because you could see him going up and down and up and down. And\nthen a young man came and he lie down on the ice and he rescued him but he had pneumonia\nand pleurisy because he was in that icy water.",
        "A: No, no, no. Because you have to understand that we didn\u2019t have a radio because we didn\u2019t\nhave electricity. So nobody had radios. My mother I think was the only person who got a\nnewspaper. So they really didn\u2019t know what was going on around them. And with a German\nspeaking village, the people lived there probably I don\u2019t know 300 years, 400 years something\nlike that.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",

        "A: Yes, my mother was, she had \u2014 there were ten siblings, five girls and five boys and my father\nthere were five boys from the first marriage and then there were two girls from the second\nmarriage. My grandfather married his niece, probably at that time it was allowed. I don\u2019t know.\nBut she was his brother\u2019s daughter. And he said that she was so beautiful that nobody else would\nbe able to have her but him. And he had five sons with her.",
        "A: No they would come to visit us because we lived in the village and they lived in \u2014 like five of\nthem lived in Prague and so on. So during the summer we always had visitors.",
        "A: No, you know living in the village and my mother took us to Pilsen. That was, as I said the\nnext big town or city. And she would take us there for Hanukah and the holidays so we would\nyou know be able to know what it means to be Jewish. And for Sukkot, we didn\u2019t have a sukkah\nbut we put branches in, from the trees the branches. Of, behind all the pictures. This was that, so\nwe knew it was Sukkot. And my mother which was very unusual knew how to doven, you know\nshe knew how to read Hebrew because at that time women really didn\u2019t know anything. And to\nlearn something about being Jewish, she engaged a rabbi from another town. It took him two\nhours by bus to come and teach us and of course we didn\u2019t like him very much because he was\nlimping. And you know children are very cruel and because he was different right. And we\nalways were somewhere. They had to look for us 1n the village where we were. So he was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nteaching us some Hebrew and he was teaching us the Sh\u2019ma and so on. So I knew that I was\nJewish that you know \u2014",
        "A: At that time you know Czechoslovakia was a very wonderful country. There was no\ndifference between religions. Everybody went to the same school. And it was really wonderful\nand the first president of Czechoslovakia was a man by the name of Masaryk. He was very\nforward looking. As a matter of fact he took his, he married an American. Her name was Guise.\nAnd he incorporated in his name, her name so his first name was Tomas and then it was Gari and\nthen it was Masaryk. And he was very, I mean he was a socialist but he was as far as being\nJewish, there was a process. One Jewish man was accused of black libel and he defended this\nman. I mean he was a fantastic man. The only thing he was already older. He was during the\nFirst World War he was a legionnaire and of course he was in touch with the United States and\nEngland and so on. And this is when Czechoslovakia became a country in 1918 because before it\nwas part of Austro-Hungary but that was many, many, many years.",
        "A: Well the thing is when I was in Pilsen, the family I lived with every Friday night we would\ngo to another family visiting and they always were listening to the radio and the conversation\nalways was about Germany, about a name named Hitler. But where I lived there were considered\nGermans. There was a man by the name of Hans Henline and he formed a party. And so I knew\nabout the Henline party. And in our village there only were probably three people who belonged\nto the party. And they didn\u2019t live in \u2014 these were young people who went to school, university\nstudents who went to school in Prague. And they brought it, they talked about it but nobody else\ndid. And so of course in 1937 I already was aware that there was a man by the name of Hitler.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: I was 12 years old.",
        "A: Yes and I came home during the summer and that\u2019s when it all started, 1938. And of course\nyou know Czechoslovakia wasn\u2019t supposed to be occupied and, but Hitler had never \u2014 and you\nknow they mobilized and of course people from my village who were German, they also were\nmobilized. They all went to the army. And then October Hitler decided yes, of course. No, that\nwas like this. In the spring of 1938 Hitler occupied Austria.",
        "A: And he promised of course he had the meeting with Chamberlin in the summer of 1938 and\nhe said that he would not enter Czechoslovakia. Of course he was a liar. And you know what\nhappened. And so first of October the Germans started crossing the border, you know from\nBavaria and Saxony. But they said that our little village would not be occupied because we had a\nfew Czech citizens and so my mother was worried, what\u2019s going to be but they said it\u2019s not\ngoing to be occupied.\nBut during the night from the 7 to the 8\"\" of October somebody knocked on the door and it was\nan officer from the Czech army because they had some of the soldiers that were billeted in our\nvillage. And so he said that he could buy some petrol for the truck and my mother said what do\nyou need petrol for the truck now in the middle of the night and he said that we are leaving\nbecause the Germans are going to occupy your little village. So she was very upset and she asked\nhim whether they would take us along and he said yes they would. So in the morning.",
        "A: Yes so and we had a maid. Of course she was crying bitterly, you know because she was so\nattached to us. And oh yes, the people that assembled in front of our house. And they yelled at\nmy mother and they said, they called her by her first name because they all worked together then.\nMy mother\u2019s name was Elsa and they said Elsa what are doing. Why are you leaving? We are\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nnot going to do anything to you and she said but I have children and I have to protect my\nchildren. So the officers sent a truck and the soldiers put things from our store on the truck and\nthey didn\u2019t take anything from the house. Only things from the store. And she asked them\nwhether they would take me along because we had some relatives in a \u2014 well a bigger village\nnear Pilsen. It was called Shemashna [ph]. And they should take me there. So I went. I was\ntwelve and a half year old. No I was 13 by that time, put me on the truck with the soldiers and I\narrived at my relatives.",
        "A: No they still were, I was the first one to leave.",
        "A: I was separate and these relatives had no idea that I was coming and I really didn\u2019t know them\nand so I said well we are running away because we are being occupied so they took me in and\nthe soldiers would, the things they had on the truck, they put in a barn and then my mother and\nbrother came in the afternoon. But during the night the soldiers came back and they stole all our\nstuff.\nAnd so my mother got in touch with some of her brothers and sisters in Prague and they said\nwell you have to come to Prague. And so I don\u2019t know how long we stayed with these relatives.",

I would like that\nshe should be able to go to school. And she says no problem. She can come tomorrow. But I\ndidn\u2019t speak Czech. But you know when you are 13 years old, believe you me you learn a\nlanguage one, two, three. And my aunt was very smart. She engaged a girl who was a year older\nthan me who was smart. And she taught me the grammar because Czech grammar is like French.\nYou know you have seven cases. It is not like English. And in English it\u2019s easy to learn. There is\nno grammar to it, because the words they are all the same. The endings are all the same. There is\nonly one article, whereas in Czech you have three and seven cases and then the words change.",

You know it was \u2014\nand then I came home and of course my uncle and aunt were very upset and but I was allowed to\ncontinue my school, my class. My year. The Germans let us stay and finish the school year. But\nthere were things. Every day was something different. The first thing you had to give up all your\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nradios. You had to give up your jewelry and I had a little ring and my mother gave it to me I\nthink for my ninth birthday or something like that. Had a little ruby stone. And my aunt said you\nbetter give me that ring because you don\u2019t want to be punished because you didn\u2019t give up your\nring. I had to give my ring which was dramatic a little bit. And then you were not allowed to go\nto the park. You were not allowed to go on the sidewalk. You were not allowed to go to the\nmovies, not to the theater. You could only shop at certain hours because they, probably the end\nof the day when there wasn\u2019t very much left.

And there I learned a great deal and our teachers\nwere not very much older because they were university students and they couldn\u2019t go to school\nso they and they were Zionists and so they were teaching us and we were preparing to go to\nPalestine.",
        "A: Yes. And we were planning to go illegally to Palestine. So we studied all the regular subjects,\nbut we studied Hebrew, Jewish history and it was like that very, I mean we learned more than a\nregular school. It was like a university.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",

And unfortunately a few, I was in touch with him all the time. And when I went on the\nmarches at Lavan the last time in 204, I met him with his wife in Jerusalem and I was now in\ncontact with him emailing. But his email stopped. And I sent him a wish for Rosh Hashanah and\nI didn\u2019t get an answer and I started phoning him and there was nobody there. The phone was\nringing, ringing, ringing. So yesterday I phoned Israel. I phoned Beit Terezin and I asked about\nhim and they were telling me that a few days ago he had, was his funeral. So he was in my fotsa\n[ph] in the Zionist organization.

So some people then\ngot visas and went to England. Very few. Some, America had only had quotas so they didn\u2019t\ntake us. And Mr. Roosevelt didn\u2019t want us because he was running for a second term so he\ncouldn\u2019t use us. And some, a few people went to Cuba, to Guatemala, to Quito you know and\nSouth America. And they would go to a priest and the priest would give them a paper that they\nare Catholic and that\u2019s how they got to South America.

And then they sent a young, about 450 young men to Terezin to prepare\nthe camp you know to make bunks and the kitchen had to be \u2014 because it was a, 1t was a military\ntime and so they prepared it and then the first transport to Terezin went in December 41.

And so I arrived maybe one minute\npast eight and my poor uncle was standing already in the door. My aunt must have given orders\nthat he should give me a, give me one you know. And so they decided that they cannot take this\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nbecause it\u2019s you know \u2014 and doing terrible things to them. And you know I\u2019m 14 years old or 15.\nYou know you want to be with the young people and you don\u2019t take these things so serious. And\nso they asked my mother that she should find a place to send me somewhere. So my mother went\nto the Jewish community and the social services and says I have a daughter and I cannot keep\nher. Perhaps you have a place where you could place her. So they did place me with young\nwomen. It was a women\u2019s shelter. But most of them, they\u2019re a little older and they were not of\nvery good repute. And they did things which I really didn\u2019t like and I felt, I went to school from\nthere. But I felt that it wasn\u2019t the right place for me. So I myself, already at that time was very\nself-sufficient I tell you. And I went to the social services and I told them. Listen, this is not a\nplace for me. These girls are doing things which --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah they all were refugees. They mostly were from Carpatha Russia, which is now Ukraine.\nAnd I went there and he says well we have now a home for young girls and boys and we will\nplace you there. And these were children from a town called Ostrova, where their fathers were\nsent to Poland to work. The Jewish fathers. You know. They took all the Jewish men and they\nsent them into what\u2019s called Nisco. And so the children were sent to Prague and there was, we\nwere in two apartment house, in two different apartments. Like a large apartment. In one were\nthe girls and then the other one were the boys. And we just got our food there. But the food was\nhardly any food. And I got extremely thin. And they became worried, so they found two families\nwhere I went for lunch, two lunches a week so I shouldn\u2019t get so skinny. And that\u2019s when I still\nwent to school. And so then I was sent to another home. You know how you are being shuttled\nfrom one end, from one place to another. And the transports were going already. And my mother\nand my brother, even so, my brother lived in an orphanage and my mother lived with her sister\nbut when the transport was called, my mother and brother went together with, in August of 42\nthey went to Terezin. And I went to Terezin on the ninth of September I believe, 1942, with\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\ntransport BS and my number was 992. I remember that very well. And I worked then. I came\nthere. I knew someone a young man and I worked in the hospital, a nurse, as a nurse\u2019s aide. My\nmother worked also as a nurse and as a matter of fact we had typhoid and she worked in the\nhospital where the children had typhoid. And my brother he was very young then. He was 15. He\nwas making toys for children. Wooden toys. I mean not for the children from Terezin. The\nGermans took all these things out. They were \u2014 they said, took it to Germany. And you know in\nTheresienstadt 1t was again we were the young people and I was already 18, no 17. And we\nwould get together in the loft. We had lofts. You know the Germans kind of didn\u2019t know that we\nhad these lofts and we would get together and we would, there would be somebody who would\nread poetry. And somebody would sing. I mean it was like what young people are doing. And\nbut the thing was that people started to leave you know. And nobody knew where these people\nwere going and people \u2014 oh yes, a lot of people came from Germany and German Jews were told\nthat they are going to be sent to a bath, you know like serene bath, house bath you know to a spa\nand they were allowed to bring their mattresses along. And so they arrived and they said so\nwhere is the spa where because they lied to them. And there were loads of old people and they\nstarted dying out very fast. And we, the young ones, we kept on going. We had, we did our\nthing even when the only thing we were afraid, that we would be sent away and nobody knew\nwhere you\u2019re going to be sent. They sent you a little piece of paper and you said they said you\nhave to be at 8:00 at this place and a family. And so my mother was one, got a little paper once.\nAnd because she was a nurse, she was looking after people who had typhoid so they took her out\nagain. That was what Gunda Redlich was doing. And then one day she, again she came to me\nand she said she was called up again and that was September 43 and at night came my brother to\nsee me and he says you know what I am going voluntarily with mother because I cannot let her\ngo by herself. You know my mother wasn\u2019t that old. My mother was in her early 50s. You know\nthat was 43. That means she was 53 years old. And but he said he couldn\u2019t let her go by herself.\nAnyway so they left and I this is the famous DM transport where I suppose you know that all of\nthem was killed on the eighth of March 1944. But my mother died, she got diarrhea and when\nsomebody got diarrhea they died from dehydration and my mother died on the fourth of January\n1944.\nAnd my brother who was in this DM transport, the whole transport was called up and they were\nkilled, all of them close to 4000 Czech Jews were killed on the eighth of March 1944. And so\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nwe were, we were left in that \u2014 in Birkenau and we were waiting when are going to be called up\nbecause you see when you arrived in Birkenau, in Auschwitz, Birkenau. You had to sign a paper\nthat after six months it\u2019s going to be special treatment. And our six months would be up very\nsoon. So we knew this is what\u2019s going to happen to us. But in the meantime the Germans sent in\nmore prisoners from Terezin to day to be at that familial camp to fill it up and then what we\ndidn\u2019t know was the invasion of Europe, you know in 1944 when British and went to Dunkirk\nand the Canadians and so on, they started invading Europe. We didn\u2019t know that. So one day, I\nmean, you know there were always rumors and there were rumors that there\u2019s going to be a\nselection. See in our camp there was never a selection like in the men. Where the men where in\nD camp there were always selections. And they always took out the people who were old or sick\nor couldn\u2019t work anymore and they took them out and they gassed them. That happened. I don\u2019t\nknow how often during the week, but it happened very often.",
        "A: Yeah that was, that was terrible because I had high fever. I had a tonsillitis and so forth. They\ncouldn\u2019t care less and they put you in these cattle cars and without water, without toilets.",
        "A: On the 15\" of December 43.",
        "A: Yes that was a transport DR. And we were one and then the next day came another transport\nthat was \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t very much with it because I was faced with you know with (inaudible) in this cattle\ncar. There was nowhere, there were no benches, no nothing. I was standing, trying sit or\nsomething and they always, in they always moved you during, they always moved you during\nthe night. They put you late, late afternoon. They put you on the trains and then you traveled and\nyou had no \u2014 you know we tried to look out that knew that, knowing of course we had no idea\nwhere we were going. And then we arrived in the morning. And the doors opened and they\nstarted, the Germans started yelling.",
        "A: It must have been overnight.",
        "A: No, there was \u2014",
        "A: All kinds of people. I don\u2019t have no idea. I have absolutely no idea who was with me. In that\ntrain. And so we jumped, they yelled us to get out, get out and we just jumped out and we saw\nyoung boys in pajamas running around and they would say, they would yell, say like don\u2019t go on\nthe trucks. Don\u2019t go on the trucks, because if you go on the trucks you will go to heaven. But you\nknow you are completely -- you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with you. You have absolutely no\ncontrol about your thoughts or anything because it\u2019s just, it\u2019s like a strange land and they put you\non the trucks and you go. And so they drove us from there into the camp and we landed in that\nfamily camp. And so they divided the girls separate and the women separate and the men\nseparate and I landed up in this house or block number 11. And there were about 800 women in\none of these houses, these blocks. And we had these bunks, three story high bunks and about\neight, where eight women would like on one, on shelf kind of. And since then you were young\nso you could climb up so you were up there and of course when you are up there which was good\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nbecause you had air and when you were old and sick you were on the bottom and it was pitch\ndark and it was like hell there.",
        "A: What did I wear. I, oh yes, I know what I wore. Now you reminded me. I bartered, you\nknow we bartered. In camps you barter for things. And I bartered with someone for a man\u2019s suit.\nI don\u2019t remember what I gave but I landed up with a man\u2019s suit. It was a very nice brown man\u2019s\nsuit and there were women who were working in where they had sewing machines. They were\nsewing so they did things on the side you know for a piece of bread or something. I don\u2019t know\nhow many slices of bread I gave her for that. But she made me a beautiful suit, a jacket, she\nturned it upside down or inside out. And I had a lovely jacket and from the pants she made me a\nskirt. And then I found somewhere a piece of fur and somebody made me a cap. A fur hat and I\nhad a fur collar so I looked really snazzy and in that thing I came to Auschwitz. Now I remember\nthat. I sometimes forget things already.",
        "A: This was, yes, yes. You know we as girls, we wanted to look nice in Terezin. Most of the girls\nwore plaid skirts. These skirts were made from blankets. I don\u2019t know where we got these\nblankets but we had and we wore these --",
        "A: That new suit, oh yes. I --",
        "A: That was very f, I was very fashionable.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: That\u2019s what I was wearing, yes. And so we were there a little while and then they took us out\nto another block and there we, girls sitting, Polish girls sitting at little tables and we had to sit\ndown at the little tables and that\u2019s where we, they tattooed us and I got my number and my\nnumber is 70663. And my number is very much on my forearm because that jacket had very tight\nsleeves and I couldn\u2019t move my sleeve up. Normally the number is near the elbow but number is\nvery low down because I couldn\u2019t move up the sleeve.",
        "A: You are in a trance. You are not, you are not there. When you arrive in Auschwitz, it was like\nyou know you went from one, you were like a, like a marionette. You know where they put you,\nthere you went. And you had no idea what was going on with you because like I say it was like\nbeing in a trance.",
        "A: Wait a minute. So when we, we had the numbers we again lined up in front of the block and\nall the women were, the men were in different blocks and the women were in different blocks.\nAnd they started marching us to outside of the camp to a building. We had no idea what this\nbuilding was. When we arrived in that building we had to get undressed and the only thing we\nwere allowed to keep were our stockings. And they put something on our hair in case we had\nlice I suppose and they put us under the shower. Now you, we had no idea that these were gas\nchambers because this was -- you could use this as a shower place or as a gas chamber because\nthe only thing, the difference was when they wanted to kill the people there were little openings\nin the ceiling and through those ceilings they put in the canisters of Zyklon B and the pebbles\nwould slowly come down and the people would suffocate. You know but this our, it\u2019s around,\nbut we had no idea. So then we took a shower and we were allowed to keep our stockings and\nthere was a bench and they put the stockings there and when it came time for me to get my\nstockings, they weren\u2019t there. I was hysterical because it was December and I had no stockings.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nSo of course they took away our shoes. They took away our clothes, the shoes and everything.\nAnd but I found another pair, I don\u2019t know whose it was. Probably this person took mine so she\nleft this. And they moves us to another room where there was a girl and she threw at us clothes.\nLiterally. She had a, you know she had a big bundle of, and she would throw it. And whether\nyou were tall or small or whatever, these horrible clothes. And I think we had, she gave us a little\ncoat or something. And instead of shoes we got these pantofels. You know the wooden clogs.\nBut that was really a savior because if we would have been standing in leather shoes would have\nbeen even worse. If they\u2019re wooden at least we didn\u2019t have frozen toes because you know we\nwere standing outside for hours being counted in the morning and in the afternoon. And then\nthey started moving, then they marched back to the camp and I was on that block 11. And we\nwere not allowed to go out for \u2014 there was a quarantine of 14 days so \u2014",
        "A: That was in the family camp, yeah. But we were a quarantine of 14 days but as you know we\nfound out things, what it was like where we were. You know I mean there\u2019s always somebody\nwho comes in \u2014 the girl who brought the soup that -- and we would try to talk to them. I found\nout that the previous transport with my mother and brother is also there so I found out where my\nmother was. And when we were allowed to, after the 14 days, when we were allowed to walk\naround in the camp, I went to look for my mother and she was on block 27. So that was quite far\naway and you know having only those clogs and in Poland it\u2019s very \u2014 the mud is unbelievable\nbecause it\u2019s clay. You sink into it like you had to take a step, take your pantofel and put it down\nand then your foot and so on. I did find my mother and she was in a terrible state already. She\nhad diarrhea. How do I know she had diarrhea? Because anybody you saw with a white mouth,\nyou know they gave out a powder against diarrhea so I knew that already that she was not well.\nSo I said well I have to do something. So I volunteered to carry the soup, because if you carried\nthem \u2014 they were in barrels. It was heavy like hell. And the two girls were carrying the soup,\none in the front and one in the back. We had like poles and over the poles there was some bands\nand those you put over your shoulders and that\u2019s how you walked. That\u2019s how you carried this.\nBut the thing was when we went to pick up those barrels, you could scrape out the left over soup.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nThat was, so I said I\u2019m going to go and carry the soup. At least I will be able to give to my\nmother a little soup. Unfortunately she got so very ill and she died a few days later.\nSo I stopped carrying the soup. And we didn\u2019t do anything. We did not go to work. We just sat,\nsitting there and most of the time we were standing outside being counted because they counted\nus in the morning and they counted us in the afternoon and we had to stand there and they had to\ncalculate whether everybody was there. They had to actually count because the dead ones, people\nwere put in the back of the block of the house. They went in the back and they counted the dead.\nAnd if the figures weren\u2019t right, they started counting again so we sometimes were standing there\nfor hours.",
        "A: We made, you know, we made friends but you know you became friendly with the person\nwho lied next to you. To me this girl whom I never saw in my life and her name was Judy\nSeltzman and so she became my friend. And I mean I knew some other people from the \u2014 but\nwhat we did was, you know we didn\u2019t go to work so you spent the whole day in that house. And\nyou were sitting there and very often we were cooking. You know imaginary cooking. And\nacross from me there was a lovely lady. Her name was Mrs. Morgenstern. She was older. Her\nson was a very nice young man. And so we were making strudels and we were making all kinds\nof things and one would say my mother did this and another would say no, no, no. My mother\ndid that. And so we were cooking. And we also pretended to take a bath. How wonderful it\nwould be. Oh yes and I also want to tell you that young women, they\u2019re very conscious of\nhygiene. And we went into the bath house, every morning, got undressed and washed ourselves\ncompletely. It was cold water. We had no towels but we washed ourselves and, but you know we\ndidn\u2019t care we were naked because nobody could see us. It was such a, it was like a fog because\nfrom our warm bodies and that cold place, it was all foggy. You could hardly tell who was who.",
        "A: Well that was our luck. It is in a way. The period stopped because before that it was horrible.\nYou had nothing. It was just terrible. But now we are paying for it because most of people who\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nlose their period when they are young, you get osteoporosis much faster. Like the runners, the\npeople, the women who are runners. Actually they lose their period also. So one good thing, we\nlost the period.",
        "A: Yeah, well you know if you ask me what we did, I can\u2019t remember. Some things just escape\nyou. And probably \u2014I don\u2019t know. We probably took some, some pieces of cloth or something.\nI cannot, I don\u2019t want to make up any stories, because, but I can\u2019t remember exactly. I will not\ntell.",
        "A: No, we weren\u2019t working. Anyway it came the seventh of March.",
        "A: Yes, 44. And they called out all the numbers from the previous, from the September\ntransport. And they had to line up until they had everybody. They moved them over to the camp\nA. We were B. And they put them in the camp B, A. And I saw my brother there. And I had a\npair of mittens and I called to him and I said would you like to have my mittens. I thought I\nwould throw them over the wire.",
        "A: Very. No, very little. I went to \u2014 after my mother died, I went on the way down, I stopped at\nhis block. He was in block 16, I believe.",
        "A: I think so. I\u2019m not quite sure but I think it was. And I went, you couldn\u2019t go in. You had to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nsay you want to speak to \u2014 so I told the guy who was standing at the door and I said I\u2019d like to\nspeak to Hanush Epstein. And he called him and he came out and I told him that mother died.\nAnd he didn\u2019t stay one word to me. He just turned around and he walked away because he was\nso attached to her. And I never saw him very much because he was painting the chimney. But\neverybody knew him. He was a very beautiful child and people were just taken by him. And I\nnever thought so. That day you know he was on the other side. I saw him and I called to him and\nI said I have those mittens. Would you like those mittens. And he said to me where I am going I\ndon\u2019t need any mittens. And during the night from the seventh to the eighth they took them by\ntruck you know and they killed them all that night. And you could hear them singing. They were\nsinging. They were singing the Hatikvah. And they were singing the Czech national anthem.\nAnd so we knew that we had three more months to live. But as I told you, in the meantime they\nsent another I think 7,500 people to fill up the camp. And then one day there was rumor that\nthere\u2019s going to be a selection because as I said we never had a selection. That was end of June, I\nbelieve. You know because don\u2019t forget, we had no calendar. We, what we did is we made little\nmarks on our bunk and, to see how many more days we have to, you know til we die you know.\nKind of we scratched them out. And so if there were rumors because 1n camps there always are\nrumors and that there\u2019s going to be a selection. And sure enough, because Mengele used to work\nin our camp. He did his research on dwarves and twins in our camp.\nSo there came, you know there came the order that we have to line up. It was at the end of the\ncamp, like near the, near where the tracks are now. And you had to get undressed completely\nand you put your clothes on your right arm because the left arm had the numbers and so you\nwent one after the other. And Mengele decided who is going to live and who is going to die. And\nyou know fate is unbelievable and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so a fatalist. Because I suffered from psoriasis\nand just at that time I was completely free of it. I didn\u2019t have any blemish on my body and so\nwhen I went through so he chose me to live. Because he just moved with his thumb if you had\nknown what he was doing and they were at the, men they were watching. And when he made one\nsign you lived and they took you and they wrote down your number. And the ones he \u2014 destined\nfor death, they didn\u2019t need to write down the number. And so we didn\u2019t know what was going\non. And then we got dressed and we went back to our bunk.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: No, we used to see him. He used to come to the camp.",
        "A: Yes, we knew that was Dr. Mengele.",
        "A: What he was doing. That he was doing. In our camp he was doing research on dwarves and\ntwins.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well you know, we knew a lot of stuff but \u2014",
        "A: For instance we got information, there were young Polish boys who lived in the men\u2019s camp,\nin camp D. And they have the roofers. They were fixing the roofs of the houses and because\nthey could go from one camp to the other, they were very knowledgeable. They knew what was\ngoing on. And they would tell us all the news. And also there were the craziest thing is. You\nknow there was one camp that was all gypsies. That was the D camp. And the gypsies had better\nfood than we had. And they brought the food from the gypsy camp to the hospital to give it to the\npeople who were sick. Now that\u2019s sick, isn\u2019t it. You know you make, yes, people \u2014 but you bring\nfood from the gypsy camp to give people who are sick. I mean this is absurd isn\u2019t it. So they,\nbecause they were moving from one camp to the other, they knew all the \u2014 they knew the news\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nwhat was going on. They were like our postman. And so we knew a lot of things which were\ngoing on.\nAnd this also was the time already when all the H \u2014 they built the railroad into the camp because\nwhen we came it wasn\u2019t there. So they built that railroad so the trains could come straight into\nthe camp. And we saw these big rail -- these trains arriving every day. And the camp next to\nours, the C camp was empty but then started filling up with girls. And these were the Hungarian\ngirls who they left, kept alive. We would talk to them. I mean probably spoke German to them. I\ndon\u2019t remember because I don\u2019t know Hungarian. And we could kind of talk because the camp \u2014\nthe division was only wire so you saw what was going on next door and I mean we didn\u2019t go\nnear the wire, because the wire were electrified you know. You could touch it and off you went.",
        "A: You had this, this tremendous will to live. You had to, you wanted to show them that, that\nyou are going to live. You are going to outlive them. And you did everything possible to stay\nalive. Like staying clean helped you, you know. And all, we were discussing all kinds of books\nand you know we were all very intelligent people so we were talking about Tolstoy and\nDostoevsky and Schiller and Goethe and all these things. We somehow wanted to, you know in\nHebrew say Doske [ph], you know what that means. We are going show you. We are going to\nlive. We will manage to survive. So anyway, so when he chose us the next day we were called,\nall our numbers were called out of the girls who were chosen. And we were marched to the\nwomen\u2019s camp and when we came to the women\u2019s camp, the orchestra was welcoming us. They\nplayed for us. But there is a book, this girl wrote a book about her being the conductor in the\nwomen\u2019s camp. Yes, she was conducting there and they are playing very nicely and we were\nmarching in. And they put us up in different bunks there. But the girl who was there, they didn\u2019t\nlike us because we had hair. We are the only prisoners whom they didn\u2019t shave. So already that\nwe were different. And so they already didn\u2019t like us. They were shaven because they, most of\nthem came 1942 from Slovakia and Poland so they were there already, this is 1944. So they were\nalready there a long time.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nAnd when we wanted to go for instance into the wash room you know to get washed. There was\na girl standing with the laboir [ph] and she, she let the water strike at us. I mean they didn\u2019t like\nus because they also knew already that we are not going to stay there. And can you imagine they\nbeing there since 1942. Now it\u2019s 1944. And that we are going to be shipped out and they just,\nthey were not. I can understand it. They were jealous of us. And so we were there a few days. I\ndon\u2019t know how long. I tell you what. I think it was the end of June and I think that we left a\nweek later. Now I have literature from Hamburg. And there they write that we arrived between\nthe 16\" and 17\" of July. But I think we came there sooner than that. I\u2019m not quite sure.",
        "A: Yes so, so anyway so they put together, they divided us and they added to us some Hungarian\ngirls. And we were standing always in silence. They moved us around and we moved around\nbecause we wanted to be with certain girls and we didn\u2019t want to be divided and so on. So there\nwas always a big doing on and they didn\u2019t do anything to us. Anyway they divided us. Part of us\nwent to Hamburg and part of us went to Shtutthof [ph]. And they added some Hungarian girls\nbut I don\u2019t know if ever anybody told you that. Before we left we were examined internally.\nBecause perhaps we were hiding some gold or something. So and then we got brought to the\ntrain and when we were brought to the train and we saw that there were not only SS men but\nsoldiers. But first of all it was a relief that we left, we were going out of Auschwitz because\nnobody in their right mind ever could fathom that that would happen.\nSo they put us on the train and we were, again there was nowhere to sit you know. Just the train.\nBut we stopped quite often because there were air raids because we drove, we didn\u2019t know where\nwe were going. We drove through the whole of Germany from southern Poland we went all the\nway to Hamburg. So when we arrived at that place the next day and I do think it was my\nbirthday. And it wasn\u2019t the 16\" or 17\". I believe it was my birthday. And so we found out that\nwe were in Hamburg. And they put us up in a warehouse. I found out just a few years ago that it\nused to be a tobacco warehouse. Right now I have a picture of it because I told you, I got in\ntouch with Hamburg and they sent me pictures. I have pictures of all the places we were. And\nthere they write that we arrived between the 16\" and 17\" but I\u2019m quite sure we came there a little\nearlier. And it was clean. And the bunks were only two stories. Like one on upper and one lower\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nso that wasn\u2019t \u2014 before we had three stories. And they were smaller ones. Only about two\ntogether and we each had our own little bed, kind of. And the soup was better. And there was no\ngas chamber, you know. I mean we were in heaven.\nAnd but the first night the whole house started to shake and we didn\u2019t know what it was. It was\nan air raid. And some girls yelled to the others who were up there. Don\u2019t move. What are you\nmoving. The whole thing shakes. We had no idea that the bombs are falling all around us. And\nso we started going to work. At first they put us on a shift and I mean we went to different\nplaces. Mostly oil companies, we were cleaning up. You know that\u2019s what we were doing first,\nto clean up. But I remember they brought me to this place and my first job was to wash windows\nand I have said to the fellow, could I have some newspaper and he said what do you need\nnewspaper for? I said well to wash the windows you will see. And when I was finished they\ncouldn\u2019t believe it, what a good job I did. And we got a little better soup. And there were other\npeople working there but we found out later on were Dutch people and French people, not they\nweren't -- they were in work camps. And they were also working in these factories. To clean up\nafter the air raids, but you know just to clean up.\nAnd the air raids were continuous. During the night and during the day like we would go in the\nmorning and there were houses standing nicely and on the way back there was nothing. You\ncould see the bathtub was hanging on and the stove was on the other hand hanging there. I mean\nthey did a real good job I can tell you. And but the British knew and the Americans knew where\nwe were. That there were a group of women. They\u2019re not going to bomb us.",
        "A: Where we stayed and even where we worked. And so we were there a few weeks. And I just\nfound from Hamburg, I got this literature and it says let me tell you. We went to place called\nNiue Graden and we arrived there on the 13\" of September and we left there on the 8\" of\nFebruary. So we were there the whole winter. We went to work. People worked all over, but my\ngroup went to work in a sand pit because they built little houses because don\u2019t forget the people\nof Hamburg, they had nowhere to live. And so we were building little houses and so I was in a\ngroup where we\u2019re working in a sand pit. And so we each got a shovel and started shoveling the\nsand and we had a little train that you know little wagons and they put sand there. And we had a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nforeman who was an old German, skinny guy who was very decent. And he saw that I seemed to\nbe a good worker. And it\u2019s funny when they see that you are a good worker, they always kind of\nfind you a good job. So he stopped me and he said you are going to be the switcher. So I became\nthe switcher on the train and you know there was a fellow who was the driver of the train and I\nwas the switcher. And the driver, he was a communist and he had to go to the police, I believe\nevery night or once a week so that he didn\u2019t run away or something like that. But the air raids\nwere unbelievable and so when the air raids were, the thing was we had to watch out where the -\n- it was called flak. That anti-aircraft. You know it splinters, it splinters and if that caught you,\nyou were dead. So when the train, when these little wagons were empty we would turn them\nupside down. We could do that and we would hide under, yes and you could hear ping, ping,\nping, you know how these things are falling on it. So we were there for a while until I told you til\nthe second, til the eighth of February. And then they moved us again.\nOh by the way, Niue Graden it\u2019s today a shopping center. And I had a friend. Her name was\nRuth Pinchovsky and she, that name afterwards oh she married a fellow, Fayon and you know\nshe was fighting with Hamburg that they shouldn\u2019t allow to put a shopping center there. But\nanyway, I have a picture of the shopping center, a part of the shopping center and there is a tablet\nwhere it says that we were there. That\u2019s what I read from.\nAnd anyway so they moved us to a place called Tiesstack on the eighth of February right.",
        "A: Tiesstack, T-I-E-S-S-T-A-C-K. And I was chosen to work right outside of camp. I was\nmaking big bricks with holes you know. Like I had a helper. She was mixing the cement with a\nstone and then I would put it in the form and bang it down and make it so solid and then you put\nout this form. You lift it out and you had this brick. But you had to work hard otherwise it would\nfall apart. And then somebody came and they put it in the, it would be dried and they would\nmake new houses. And it\u2019s a strange thing. I remember most everything but I could not tell you\nwho was living with me in that room where I was. What it was like. They sent me from\nHamburg a picture of that place. It doesn\u2019t say anything to me. I remember that there was a\ndining hall which was a long hall and I remember exactly where I was working. But I couldn\u2019t\nremember that place what it looked like or who was with me. Because very shortly after that one\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nday we went from work, which was around, I say you know that it was in, still in February but\nnobody wants to believe me. We went from work and we were standing to go in and as we were\nstanding the siren sounded and they told you that the flyers were already crossing the Channel\nand that was called a full alarm. And we told the guard who was a soldier and he was a nice guy.\nHe was a decent guy. He was kind of heavy rotund and we called him puppy and we said puppy\nlook, there\u2019s an air raid. Can\u2019t we go in. and he says you know I cannot let you go in because you\nhave to be counted.\nAnd as we were standing there it became a full alarm. That meant the flyers really are already\nover the city and the bombs started to fall. And it killed puppy but of course he wasn\u2019t killed by\nthe bomb but he was quite killed by the flak. The girl next to me, her name was Tuli Klasa, she\nwas killed and I started running like crazy to the dining hall. And to this day nobody wants to\nown up whose plane it was. Do you know? They used to fly over us. It was in the spring of 45,\nwhen they were bombing Dresden to hell. So they were going over us every day. And because\nnear us was a power station and this was like you know at that time radar didn\u2019t work so well.\nBut this was a point they knew they had to fly over in order to go to the, on the way to Dresden.\nAnd, but the camp was gone and because the camp was gone, they had to move us. And they left\nus there a few days. There was like a factory and we were sleeping there on some benches or\nwhatever it was. More outside. Because also luck was that we were the only ones who were in\ncamp. The others, because it was early like must have been 4:30 so the girls still didn\u2019t come\nback from work. They worked outside of camp except we were near the camp. Yet nobody,\nonly a few people was hurt and a few people was killed. Otherwise everybody would have been\ngone. And it was one plane which went in, got into trouble and had to let go. In order to save the\nplane and themselves they had to get rid of the bomb. And they fell on us. And I tried to find out\nabout this plane. I wrote to a number of war museums in England and they don\u2019t know anything\nabout it. I wrote to the war museum in Washington and there was such a clever guy who said\nsent me back an email. I should go to my home office. Like Montreal would be in the United\nStates and I could go to the office. He had no idea what I was talking about. So til this day\nnobody wants to own up and I went to the war museum in Ottawa and I spoke to an officer and I\nsaid I\u2019d like to know what happened to that plane because the camp was gone and because the\ncamp was gone, we were moved to Bergen Belsen. And there half of the girls who would have\nsurvived died there of typhoid. So anyways after a few days we went to the train and as we were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nwaiting for the train there was an air raid. We were sitting there on the grass and we just didn\u2019t\nmove. I mean we are not afraid of air raids. And we couldn\u2019t go anywhere because \u2014 and then the\ntrain came and they put us on the train and early in the morning we arrived. We didn\u2019t know\nwhere it was. And we had to carry some jackets or something. Air force, it was heavy like hell.\nAnd we schlepped it to this camp and then we arrived in the morning.",
        "A: That I don\u2019t know. I am saying the things that I am saying but nobody wants to corroborate it\nwith me that it was sometimes in end of February. And they said it isn\u2019t so but my figure I\u2019m\nsure it\u2019s so. And when we arrived they had a block there and there was nothing. There were no\nbunks no nothing and we had to lie on the floor and it was terrible because one was lying on top\nof the other and when you had to go the bathroom you had to step one bathroom. The toilet\ndidn\u2019t work and we had no water. We had no toilet. There was nothing. It was complete chaos\nthere. I mean most of the people were dead. It was typhoid was \u2014",
        "A: Bergen Belsen yes. It was horrendous. We hardly got anything to eat and water was, there\nwas no water. As I told you, the toilets didn\u2019t -- I mean you couldn\u2019t even go. You know we\nwent around the houses. It was terrible because \u2014 it was just awful.\nAnd then one day there was a huge tent. And we didn\u2019t know the tent was full of corpses. And\nthey made us drag those corpses to a mass grave because they wanted you know, they knew that\nthey had to, that they\u2018re going to lose so they wanted to clean it up kind of. So we did that and\nwhen, certain hours they said enough and so we just dropped the corpse and went back and you\nsaw like a row of corpses lying there and you know you become so not feeling. You know you\nbecome so nothing. You know, you know that it\u2019s goes on, this is what you\u2019re going to be like\nand you fight on.\nAnd then the Germans ran away. And then they brought in Hungarian soldiers. And they didn\u2019t\ngive us anything to eat either. So we went, tried to find some food and the Germans had storage.\nYou know they stored potatoes and turnips and things like that under straw. Like earth and straw\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nand it was like, like big graves you know but a huge thing. So we went there to dig it up and\nthese damned Hungarians they started shooting and they killed girls. And you know what, it\u2019s a\nfunny thing. I\u2019m the only one who remembers that. When you will read anything about Tiesstack\nthey don\u2019t talk that Hungarians were there, but they were there. Anyway and then they left. And\nthen there was no one. There were just a few of us who still were able to walk around. And they\nwere (sound skip) including myself and we felt that Red Cross must be coming. You know\nsomebody must be coming so we wanted to prepare for that. We found a little table. Believe you\nme it was a little table. And it was hard for us to carry that little table.\nWe carried it on the main road to the entrance of the camp. And as we were standing at the\nentrance somebody started shooting at us and the girl next to me was shot at but the bullet went\ninto \u2014 she had a blouse with a, with a pad and it went into the pad, but nothing happened to her\nand as we were standing there a huge tank arrived with a white star. Who the hell knew what it\nwas? You know we have no idea what it was. And then the turret opened and there was this\nyoung man and he said that the division of all the allies came to liberate us. He said it in\nGerman. Atdalem Aleit Mezhde [German expression \u2014 ph] he said and they started driving in\nand the soldiers came walking. And I spoke a little English already at that time. And he told, the\nfirst thing he told me is that Roosevelt died. Because Roosevelt died on the 12\" and we were\nliberated on the 15\".\nAnd I like an idiot was crying. I never cried throughout my whole three years but I cried. So\nnow when I give a lecture, | tell the children that I am ashamed of my tears because Mr.\nRoosevelt could have saved thousands of Jews and he didn\u2019t do anything so that\u2019s why I\u2019m\nashamed of my tears.\nAnyway so this British army came in. This was the first camp they liberated and they saw the\nhorror because most people were dead and there were thousands of them. And they got in touch\nwith their head office and the first thing they did, they put up showers. So at least we could get\nwashed. And there was a town not far from where we were. It was called Bergen, which was an\narmory town. Of course the German soldiers were not there anymore and that they changed into\na hospital town. And they tried to take us all the sick people first so I was, you know I wasn\u2019t\nsick. I was walking around. So you should have seen. They put down on the ground, the\nsoldiers put down a stretcher. Before you knew there were ten naked ladies lying there because\nyou were not allowed to take any of their clothes because it was full of lice. Right.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nAnyway so I was one of the last ones going out. And we\u2019re coming to Bergen and there was a\nsquare and I was put up with some other girls in one of these buildings. And there was a kitchen\nand I don\u2019t know how smart I got, said \u2019'm going to go and work in the kitchen. So I worked in\nthe kitchen. And I stole some butter and I put it in my chest and I ran home because I wanted to\nbring it to the girls butter. And before I came it was running down. Anyway, so then the Red\nCross started coming and they had clothes for us because after all we had nothing and I got a\nleather jacket. It was an old leather jacket, but it was a leather jacket. I got Eisenhower jacket.\nYes, oh yes, but my director on our own before we were liberated, there was nobody, we\ncouldn\u2019t walk around and there were warehouses. You have no idea what the Germans had\nwarehouses full of what do you call it, attach\u00e9 cases. You know these leather attach\u00e9 cases that\nofficers always used and you see films, they always had these attach\u00e9. A whole building full of\nattach\u00e9 cases. A whole building full of jackets, flyers. You know for the air force. Beautiful\njackets. And then there was old clothes and all kinds of junk. And I found myself a pair of pants.\nIt was they were huge. So I put a, I think some kind of a just string around it because I weighed\n46 pounds at that time.",
        "A: Yes. And I\u2019m five, eight.",
        "A: And anyway I found those pants and then I found the leather jacket. Not, the Red Cross\ndidn\u2019t give me, there I found a leather jacket. And so the Red Cross there and when we were\nliberated they tried to give us clothes and so on. And then the British soldiers were very nice.\nAnd there was a movie house and you only were allowed to go to a movie if you had an escort.\nAnd you had to go with a soldier. And I found myself a soldier and his name was Goldberg and\nhe says he was Jewish and that he came from Edinburgh, Liverpool, I don\u2019t remember what.\nSomewhere. And he became my friend, kind of. And they said when they said if we know of any\npeople you want to write to, you could. So I raised my hand and they said you want to write to\nsomeone. I said yes. I have an uncle in Canada and they said but do you know his address. I said\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\ndamn well I know the address. And that is, 12, it\u2019s 1448 Bishop Street Montreal. And they\nlooked like I was nuts. You know how could I remember an address in Canada. So I did write\nhim a letter and my uncle got it. It was the first letter arrived from someone who was in a\nconcentration camp and I believe it was even published in a newspaper. And so my uncle knew\nthat I was alive. And after \u2014",
        "A: Oh wow. That\u2019s all I can say. Yeah I mean it was unreal. It was absolutely unreal but the\nthing was that we had so many friends who were sick and we tried to find them. And to find\nsomeone because there were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them lying in these places\nthere. I had a lady how she got through, how Mengele didn\u2019t take her was unbelievable. She was\nmuch older and she was, looked older, she had hardly any teeth. And not a nice looking woman\nbut heart of gold. She would do the dirtiest work and she would get a little extra soup and she\nwould give me a little bit, bread or a little something you know to help me. So I went looking\nfor her. It took me days to find her amongst, you know because there were no lists. You only\nwent from bed to bed to bed to bed. And I did find her and she told me you know what. I have a\nson in Czechoslovakia and he, she told me where he lived and his name and after the war, I did\nfind him. And he got her though. I never saw her again but anyway \u2014",
        "A: Oh we celebrated. I can tell you. We had party. Yes, even dancing.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. You know we had, there were young men and the soldiers. And the funny thing\nwas there were some French Canadians. They said they\u2019re from Canada. They spoke French.\nYou couldn\u2019t understand it. How come they spoke French in a flyer. And also \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: OhI mean it was something, you can\u2019t describe it. That you made it, you know. You are the\nones who made it. These horrible people couldn\u2019t get you down. And you really made it. And\nSO \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, he got the letter. And we were allowed to go into the villages you know so we went\ninto the villages and we didn\u2019t set the houses on fire and we didn\u2019t beat anybody up. And we\nwere so happy to be alive that we just went into the houses. We looked around and we didn\u2019t\nsteal anything. It was amazing that it didn\u2019t occur to us that we would take anything. And this 1s\nwhat I tell the young people that here we were and who, they did such terrible things and we\nwent into the villages and we didn\u2019t do anything to anybody. We didn\u2019t steal. We didn\u2019t burn\ndown the houses. We just looked in awe to all these things. And then I remember we had a big\nparty on the square and we were kind of dancing and so on. Anyway, there was a girl whom I\nknew already from my Zionist days and she said that her h, she got in touch with her husband\nand he\u2019s coming. And she will go home with him. And so I said to her, Eva, can I go with you.\nShe said sure. So I went with her. And then Ruth Bondy, you might know the name. She\u2019s a\nwriter. She lives in Israel. She went with us on that. So we went on that rickety track and we\ndrove through whole of Germany. Hamburg all the way to the Czech border. That\u2019s a long way.\nAnd we came there and we went into the inn and they didn\u2019t know what to do with us. They\nwere so happy for us. And the next day we drove to the Czech border. We got off the truck and\nwe stood there and we sang the Czech national anthem.\nAnd then we drove into Prague. And this young man with whom I\u2019m still friends he said ok girls.\nThis is Slatege [ph], and this girl who was my friend, I called her Chinda. I didn\u2019t know her.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nOrkin was her name but we call her Chinda. And the two of us, we looked at each other and we\nsaid so where we are going. So there was a young woman standing there and she saw that we\ndidn\u2019t have where to go. She said what are you going to do girls? And we said we don\u2019t know.\nShe said you know what. I got my apartment back. I even find my husband. You can come to us.\nSo she and she left and she gave me the address. And she left and I knew exactly where it was.\nAnd so the two of us you know we traveled very light.\nWe didn\u2019t have a penny to our names. We did have a few clothes you know. Not much but a\nlittle something. And we went on the street car and we had no money so a soldier paid for us and\nthat\u2019s how I started my life again.",
        "A: Well since I got in touch with my uncle, I did not want to stay in Czechoslovakia and I came\nto Canada in 49. Even then it took four years for me to get a visa.",
        "A: Oh so I had a very good friend in Terezin. He was my boyfriend but it was a really girl boy,\nnot, not lovers. He was a very good boy and he said and again I have to emphasize that all what\nwe needed to know, we had to memorize and so he gave me his mother\u2019s name because his\nfather went illegally to Palestine. In 1940. And gave me his mother\u2019s name and her address.\nAnd so when I came to Prague and first of all we had to, to go to eat we went to habitat. You\nknow a Catholic charity. And to the nuns we went. The nuns fed us lunch. We were lined up.\nThere were people from all over the place. And I came with my leather jacket and next to me\nthere were two young men and they said would you like to barter it for a coat and I said yeah\nsure, if you have a nice coat. So they said ok tomorrow for lunch, you come and we bring you\nthe coat. So they came and I gave them my jacket and they gave me the coat.\nAnd so I started looking for this lady and when I came to the address, the super told me that they\nmoved and he gave me the address but there was a building in the center of Prague where all the\npeople like me would gather. And they would tell us, give us information where we could get a\nlittle money and how we could get food and so on. And in the foyer there were pictures and they\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nsaid this is my brother. He was there. This is my mother. She was there. And amongst the\npictures I found the picture of this young man, my friend. I knew already that he is not back yet.\nAnd so I went to his family and I told them who I was and they were very kind to me. And the\ngentleman already knew that he was not alive, but the mother still didn\u2019t know. She still was\nwaiting for him. He died in Buchenwald in January 45. And so if they would ask me to come for\nmeals and I would go there for meals and then they realized that he\u2019s not coming back so and I\nsaid I don\u2019t have anybody and I told them that I have an uncle in Canada, that I want to go to\nCanada. I won\u2019t stay.\nAnd so they took me in. And I lived with them and the gentleman was very practical and he said\nto me, since you want to go to Canada you better go and start learning English so I was, since I\nhad somewhere to stay. It didn\u2019t cost me anything and I went to, 1t was called the Institute for\nmodern languages. And I went every day and by the end of the year the, like you know winter,\nin the fall and the spring. I wrote my university exam and then I looked for a job.\nAnd he thought that he would open a little store for me like a flower shop. Is that he would\nfinance it and I would be running it. And nothing came of it. And then he had a friend who\nopened a store and they hired me. You know what I had for sale? Three bales of clothes. That\nwas my inventory and one day I came and somebody broke in. So that was the end of my job.\nAnd I went to the Jewish community and I got a job which was a horrible job. Back in the place\nwhere I was once, where I lived it was above the synagogue. There was a big hall and there were\nclothes brought back from Terezin which was a horrible thing. And we went through them and\nput them like the better ones aside and so with people like me could get some clothes.\nAnd also we had the divisions from America. People from America sent, were sending parcels\nand so we had there and there were blankets. They were not wool blankets but there are blankets.\nAnd you know what, we stole them, a lot of them. And I had from one of the blankets made a\ncoat. It was, it\u2019s made of blankets. It was a brown and I had a beautiful brown winter coat. And I\ndidn\u2019t stay there too long. And I was hired to work in the, we had a newspaper which is now\nIresh Chodesh. At that time it was called the Biesnik [ph]. And I was working there with a lady.\nWe did the addresses you know. We had little plates and we put the addresses on and I also was\n\u2014 would retype the articles people wrote by hand and I would type them so the proofreader had\nan easier time to do that.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nBut what happened was my mother\u2019s cousin whom I called uncle was brought back from Israel\nand he became chief rabbi of Prague. And his name was Gustav Sicher so you know I was kind\nof a high ranking (both talking) there. And one day I went downstairs and I met a man and the\nman knew that I knew English and he said listen I have a good job for you. Would you like to\nwork for this American Joint. I said well, why not? So he sent me there. I had to go and I worked\nfrom the American Joint and my salary was twice what I had and I didn\u2019t have much work. I\nfilled out little pieces of paper and I went to the bank to get thousands of dollars because in order\nto emigrate, you had to pay in dollars. Now we provided the people with dollars. And so I\nwaited til \u2014 yes, and my visa didn\u2019t come through. It took you know four years. And they were\nlooking for girls in Australia. There was a shortage of young girls. So I had a relative who was\nworking in immigration for the Jewish community. And she says you know what. Why don\u2019t\nyou make out an application for a visa for you? You know you\u2019re not getting the visa to Canada\nso you might as well try to go to Australia. And one day I got the visa for Australia and the next\nday I got the visa for Canada. So I didn\u2019t go to Australia. That\u2019s too far away.",
        "A: I came to Canada to my uncle. Yes and he always wrote to me that I should learn to become\na hair \u2014 he had a hair dressing salon that I should learn to be a manicurist or something like that\nand I would tell him yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean well I knew that I didn\u2019t want to do that. Anyway\nso, but he paid for my fare and I went by train to Belgium to Ostend and from Ostend I went to\nDover.\nAnd then by train I went to London and this relative who said I should apply to, for Australia.\nShe had friends and she told them that I was coming. And she went with me on the train to \u2014 she\nwanted I should smuggle through for her a ring. And I refused. I said on account of a ring I\u2019m\nnot going to be put in jail. I\u2019m sorry. I cannot do that. But these people waited for me at the\nstation in London. And the first thing they asked me was I brought Czech salami. I did have\nsome Czech salami. And they lived in St. John\u2019s woods. How do you like how I remember all\nthat?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: Well just a week. I wanted to see London before I go to --. So I came to St. John\u2019s Wood and\nthey, the first thing they offered me was I want a rum and coke. What did I know what the rum\nand coke was? I said yes. So I took a few sips and then they told me that the apartment was too\nlittle, that I cannot stay with them there. They arranged for me to stay somewhere else.",
        "A: Just one second. I went, they put me up in a hostel from the Jewish community. It was like\nback being in Terezin. It was a huge hall for women and underneath that was a huge hall for\nmen and the food was served on metal plates, just like camp. It was such a shock to me. You\nhave no idea. And I had a cake in my valise and there was a little boy and he knew that I had\nthis cake and during the night he would say mademoiselle, gateau, mademoiselle s\u2019il vous plait,\ngateau. He was from Egypt. Because at that time the Jews from Egypt and India who wanted to\ngo to Palestine had to go through London. So these were the people who I stayed with.\nAnd but I wanted to see London so I took off in the morning and by myself but on the way back I\nalways had problems. Obviously some man would follow me. Because it was in Old Gate East\nwhich 1s a very bad part of London. That\u2019s where the London Tower is. And I was smart. I said\nto a policeman I would, would you please take me home because I am being bothered by a man\nwhere they don\u2019t leave me alone and that\u2019s how I managed to go out and go back in and so on.\nAnd then I took a train to Liverpool and I went on the Empress of France where I was deathly\nsick to Canada.",
        "A: Well I, yes and all these ladies who were on the train, on the boat were there. Mothers of war\nbrides you know. I was deathly sick and they took me to the doctor and since my name was\nEpstein, he said to me oh you must be a relative of Sir Jacob and I happened to know just by\naccident because I always was interested in art I happened to know that he was a famous\nsculptor. And I said yes, of course. And I was, I got better treatment kind of. And so they always\nsaid how will you know your uncle? I said I don\u2019t know. So we come to Montreal and \u2019'm\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nstanding up there on the boat and I look down and I said there he is. That\u2019s my uncle. Yes.\nAnyway that\u2019s how it was.",
        "A: I was married in 1950.",
        "A: He came from Lithuania in 1923. His family, his father was here before the First World War\nand then he came, he went back. No, before the turn of the century I must say.",
        "A: His name was Sidney.",
        "A: At the beginning we couldn\u2019t have children so I adopted a girl. She was 17 months old. Her\nname is Elsa and then four years later I became pregnant and I had a son and his name is Victor.\nBut Elsa is not very nice and she doesn\u2019t talk to me now. She is 60 years old and she has two\nchildren and they have, I have two grandchildren from her and five great grandchildren but I\ndon\u2019t see them. Anyway that happens. What can you do? And my son has three daughters and he\nlives in California. He lives in Orinda, just outside of San Francisco.",
        "A: Sure.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: When I came here yes, I worked. In, but first in the beauty parlor which I despised because\nthe ladies who came there, there were real bosquey type and they were talking about their birdies\nand their doggies and then after what I experienced, these things were so banal. And I told my\nuncle that I really didn\u2019t like it. So he knew somebody at Bell Telephone. You know Bell\nTelephone is a big company. And I was the \u2014 you know in Europe you learn how to do design,\nyou know construction. So I thought I could to draw plans and things like that. So I went there\nand I had to pass an exam. Everything was fine. I could answer everything except when it came\nto feets and ounces because after all I learned everything in the metric system and so I failed.\nAnd so I got a job in a, in an office where I did invoices. And that\u2019s where I met my husband.",
        "A: Well I say the people who were born after the war they are not responsible for it. I, I don\u2019t\nlike, when for instance I go to a store, not now it\u2019s not so obvious. But years ago I would stand in\nline and I would see a German, I would immediately turn around. And when I saw a person who\nwas about my age, I had very bad feelings, because I knew he must have been somewhere, you\nknow. And of course I, a friend of mine, he a little bit out there, but he says eventually\nforgive but one never forgets. I really don\u2019t forgive them either because for instance the guards\nin Auschwitz, nothing happened to them. They went home and they got married and they are\ngrandfathers now or whatever. Nothing happened. You know they caught the tops, but the\nregular soldiers there who did that dirty work and kicked us and beat us and helped us into,\npushed us into the gas chambers, he went home like nothing would have happened.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: OhI told them gradually. They always, first of all I had the number you know so I had to, I\ncouldn\u2019t say well I put it there for, for nothing you know. I had to tell them who put it there.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: No. No. You know what. It\u2019s much worse now. Right now because I live by myself and I\u2019m\nnot well. It haunts me much more than before. When I was young I was busy, bringing up a\nfamily you know. You know having children and doing things and school work and all that. I\nbelonged to a Zionist organization. I belong to what do you call, Hadassah. I belonged to\nHadassah and I was very active. I was a president. I was a this and I was a that. And you know\nalways working for Israel. But the war years were pushed aside because I was busy living.",
        "A: Oh certainly.",
        "A: Well first of all I would have been a professional person because you can hear I\u2019m no\ndumbbell. And I would have become some, who knows what. And so my life would have been\ndifferent. And I wouldn\u2019t have been a different person as a person because that\u2019s what you are.\nWhether you know you are kind or miserable so I still, like I like to help people now. I\u2019m sure I\nwould have liked to help people then also. And but I would have been, I can tell I\u2019m sure I\nwould have been quite an outstanding person. I was very talented as far as art was concerned. I,\nwhen my children were small I took art classes and I went back to university. I took, my major\nwas don\u2019t laugh, German literature. And fine arts. But then when I tell it to somebody German\nbecause I think yes, I studied Thomas Mann and Heinrich Mann and Kafka and Heine and after\nall these are all Czech Jews. But Heine was not, but Rilke and so you know and I, I did\nextremely well. I finished with magna cum laude. And then I was teaching pre-school art for 13\nyears.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: No my husband died in 96.",
        "A: I used to. Right now you know I \u2014 yes I did it for 25 years. But I published a book. You have\nthe book now in the library because I sent you one.",
        "A: It\u2019s 1 Am Their Voice. I felt that six million people lost their voice so I tried to, a\npresumption on my part, but I thought that \u2014 and it\u2019s not about me. The book is not about me.\nit\u2019s quite different. It is letters, poems and drawings from children I spoke to. So it is, you know\nthere are so many books written about people. They write their stories and you know what, the\nsad part is nobody is reading it. Young people they are on their texting business you know. So\nmy book 1s different because it shows how young people really can feel with you, the\nunderstanding and, and want to, you know are really very sensitive. So if you will read it. The\npoems are outstanding. They are written by 12 year old kids and I couldn\u2019t write poems like\nthat. I had an idea that since I\u2019m not so well, it would have taken some time , to find somebody\nto put these poems to music. Maybe sometime somebody will do that because they\u2019re absolutely\nwonderful.",
        "A: No. No, no, no I\u2019m not angry about that. You know as I said I\u2019m a fatalist. You know it just\nhappens that I was born in Lichtenstein and I wasn\u2019t born in Washington, DC or I wasn\u2019t born in\nwho knows where.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: All of the above.",
        "A: And yet I speak fluently Czech, even though my mother tongue is German. I probably speak\nbetter Czech than German now because I don\u2019t speak and I have a cleaning lady who speaks\nCzech so I speak Czech to her. And what nobody can get over is that I speak so well Czech\nwithout mistakes you know. Czech is quite a difficult language.",
        "A: I saw Eichmann sometimes. He came to Auschwitz you know to inspect everything.",
        "A: Yes, well you know probably cause you know you were, he just was passing by kind of. And\nthe thing is of course, I was in Prague when Heydrich was killed.",
        "A: And you know what they did because they knew that they on bicycles. So they woke you up\nin the middle of the night. The police came and said do you know how to ride a bicycle and I\nwould say yes. Do you own a bicycle? I said no. They look. And do you know what they did.\nAfter that they sent a thousand Jews right after Eichmann did that, a thousand Jews immediately\nto Poland to death. A thousand. And the funny part is that the initial of that transport is A, A, H\nand we call it Authentat of Heydrich. It just happened that way. Like Iam DS but that transport\nin May was A, A Ha, if you look at that it\u2019s a thousand people from Prague that went directly.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: Lidice, yes, we knew about Lidice. It\u2019s a terrible thing that Lidice and do you know that\nsome of the children from Lidice came to Terezin. And some of the children were small. I don\u2019t\u2019\nknow how many but I was told. I never saw them. And you know I had a gym teacher. We were\ntalking about did I remember teachers. His name was Fredy Hirsch.",
        "A: But he was my gym teacher. And do you know what happened. There came a transport of\nchildren and they put them not too far from Terezin. And because he was so fond of children he\nwent there to look what, how it\u2019s going and the SS found him there and that\u2019s how they sent him\nto Auschwitz. Otherwise he might have survived. And you know he committed suicide and\nFreddy he was such a fantastic guy. And you know he was gay but there was never ever any\nsuspicion that he would mistreat anybody. Never. And he was my gym teacher and all the war\nyears we went to gym and we had a place. It was the only place we could go which was of course\nHigibor and there we would be able to run and he had a table you know. He was standing on the\ntable. And he would be whistling so you know we were doing gym. He was so handsome.\nThere\u2019s a little book about him, a young girl who did a research. It was for her doctorate or\nsomething. She wrote about him. and I have this book. And you know Wexler, you know the\none who ran away. Yes, so they went to Fredy, already when the whole transport was in the A\ncamp. And they went to Fredy and say listen Fredy we really want to be make a, you know we\ndon\u2019t\u2019 want that we all go to hell tomorrow. Let\u2019s do a something. You know to disrupt the\nwhole thing.\nAnd he said to them, give me I don\u2019t know how many hours he gave them and they came back\nand he was dead. A doctor gave him some pills and he swallowed them and he died. He was such\na handsome man, but there was never any, any, anything that he would go after the boys. Never.\nAnd you know he looked after the children in Terezin. They had, as a matter of fact, today I send\nyou through the Holocaust center, ten year old kids wrote a newspaper and somebody gave me a\ncopy. It\u2019s not some of it is not very clear but anyway they made copies for me here at the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nHolocaust center and they send it to Michaela and you will be able to see it\u2019s like a newspaper.\nThe hand writing of these ten year old kids and yet and I went through all the lists because I have\nthe book from Terezin so I can tell when they were born and I can tell which transport. I made a\nlist. So of all these children who wrote in that little newspaper, one survived. You know there\nwere 15,000 children in Terezin and from the 15,000, 50 survived.",
        "A: No, to me it doesn\u2019t make any difference but Hungarians bother me, sorry to say. You know\nbecause I left in 1938 my home and they left in 1944. They had six years to the good. They did\nto, they killed so many of them. And you know what when they tell the story, they say that\nwhen, that Mengele was the one who did the selection at the train so I always tease them. I said\ntell me, did he introduce himself or did he \u2014 how did you know he was Mengele because there\nwere so many other SS men who did the selection. But they say because that\u2019s the name they\nknow. And I always said don\u2019t say that because you know we have deniers and if they find out\nthat you are telling a lie, that\u2019s not very good.",
        "A: No, no. No. Not so, none whatsoever. I can only say \u2014",
        "A: Yes. It doesn\u2019t have to happen to the Jews. It can happen to another, to another nation that\nthere is crazy guy and says all these people are no good. But we Jews have a \u2014 but they can\u2019t get\nrid of us you know. We are here a long time and there are so many pogroms, and so many, so\nmany things they\u2019ve done to us and we are still here. I believe that the Jews in Bohemia are\nSpanish Jews. And my family are Spanish Jews because if you would see the pictures of my aunt\nand you would say my goodness, gracious. Look at them, big black eyes and the huge black hair\nand I have \u2014 on one side my family, from my grandfather\u2019s side, I can go back to 1752. And the\nother one to 1715. And as a matter of fact, I was telling Michaela that there is book out,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\ninteresting author, written by a woman by the name of Butchkova, about the Jews in my area.\nAnd the first ones arrived there in 16 something. So I wrote to her an email and I thought you\nknow to thank her for all the work she did for all the digging and uncovering all these facts about\nall the Jews. And she\u2019s not Jewish. But one thing I want to know is where did they come from?\nAnd I also was at the main archives in Prague and where they did research for me and they said\nthat my family they can date back to 1715. But where they came from, they cannot tell.",
        "A: From Germany?",
        "A: Yeah, very little, yes.",
        "A: You tell me what interests you.",
        "A: My grandchildren, I want to say that they should never forget where they came from. But you\nknow what my granddaughter just got married and I could not go to the wedding because it was\nin San Francisco and I wasn\u2019t up to go, but she married a non-Jew and but he \u2014 they had a\nhuppah and he broke the glass and so on.",
        "A: No, no I was very Jewish to begin with. My mother was very Jewish. Yes. Oh yes. You\nknow we always like for instance, when my children were small I, when I went to synagogue, I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012\nalways walked and it wasn\u2019t around the corner and it was in honor of my mother because when\nwe went to our little synagogue, we had to go through woods and fields and meadows and we\nalways walked you know. The only thing on Yom Kippur when Admile, the fellow who looked\nafter the horses, he came there with the horses to take us home, but my mother would never\nwalk. Would never drive, never. And so I did the same thing. I always walked with my children\nto shul. And my children went to a Jewish school. My son spoke very well Hebrew. And he\nstudied Tenach and all that. Yes.\nBut you know now he\u2019s far away and he\u2019s 1n a surrounding which 1s not very Jewish. He does go\non the holidays to a temple. Because the woman he married, they belong to temple. As a matter\nof fact my son where he worked after 28 years, I was sick and he got divorced. Everything at the\nsame time. It was very hard on me.",
        "A: No. No, no. I never hide who I am. I, you know, this is who I am. I had the misfortune to\nlive in Europe in a horrible time and but I\u2019m a fatalist and it was my fate that I didn\u2019t have\npsoriasis and Mengele chose me to live and otherwise I would have been dead a long time ago.\nAnd right now I\u2019m sick and I\u2019m very much alone and that is worse than anything else you can\nimagine.\nI am always by myself and I have a friend whom I played bridge twice a week and he\u2019s getting\non and he\u2019s now 92. And he is now in a residence, but in a very beautiful residence. And I phone\nhim and he cries. He doesn\u2019t stop crying. He says you know what. When I was young I did all\nthese things and now this, it doesn\u2019t leave me and I\u2019m just a wreck. And so it comes back more\nthan before. It haunts us much more. And this is the bad part. And you see, a person like you can\nunderstand it. But how could you tell that to your neighbor. You know how would they know\nwhat you feel like. So you are there and you just, you have to keep on fighting. And hoping that\nyou are not going to die by yourself. That\u2019s all I\u2019m worried about.\nI have a lifeline so but the thing is that I still try to, as a matter of fact, now I\u2019m doing research\non Mrs. Albright. Mrs. Albright lies. You know that I met her cousin.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: Yes, I met her cousin in, Dasha, I met her cousin in 1998 I believe because this friend of\nmine whom I told you. He was in Prague at the same time and he was standing in a hotel and I\nphoned him and he says come on over. I have a visitor here. Come on over. So I went to the\nhotel and her cousin Dasha was there and we talked, you know but nothing much. You know like\nvisiting in a hotel. You talk about the city or whatever it was. Because he comes from the same\ntown as Dasha, and he knew her as a young girl and her parents. Her father was their family\ndoctor. And so he says I have to go now. He says I have to go now too \u2014 and so she left and we\nwent downstairs and we crossed the Mensa square and I said to her, tell me, how can she say that\nshe didn\u2019t know she was Jewish. So she said to me, my mother, her daughter said, mommy when\nshe looks in the mirror, doesn\u2019t she see who she is? You know. I tell you. I cannot understand it.\nShe came back to Prague in 1947. That means she was ten years old. Her cousin Dasha who was\nolder came back at the same time from England and her cousin Dasha, her parents weren\u2019t there.\nThey were all killed. And her grandparents. Didn\u2019t she ask what happened to uncle so and so? I\nmean even you are ten years old. You know the bad person is her father. I hate him because he\nwas such a bureaucrat. He didn\u2019t want that anything should interfere with his climb. He wanted\nto become ambassador. You know being a Jew he was afraid. Maybe they wouldn\u2019t promote him\nyou know. So they all became, they all were baptized in England. I mean she\u2019s such a smart\nwoman.\nNot only that, she was teaching history so didn\u2019t she teach history what was going on in Europe.\nDidn\u2019t she know? I mean how could, if I would meet her I would say Mrs. Albright you are such\na smart person but you are such a damn liar.\nAnyway what I am doing now research on, in her books, if you seem to have the book, on page\n276 there is an article, by (sound skip) by the name of Eugena Smolkova that she was in\nAuschwitz and she was pulled out by an SS man and that\u2019s how she survived. You know went to\nHamburg. This is a bloody lie. Because we were not, we were not in the showers, we were\nselected in the camp. And when she arrived she went to Niue Graden which is a lie too because\nwe went from Auschwitz, we went first to Hamburg, Freihaven, and then we went to Niue\nGraden. So the whole thing doesn\u2019t make sense. And not only that, you know I have the book\nwhere everybody is listed who went to camps, to, from Terezin right?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 29, 2012",
        "A: I cannot find her. They cannot find her in beit Terezin so we don\u2019t know who she 1s. She\nwrites there that no, that she, her daughter is working for a Mrs. Albright. So I told your friend\nMichaela, I said why don\u2019t you ask this daughter which transport she went to Auschwitz.\nBecause we cannot find her. Her name is Eugena Smolkova. We cannot find her anywhere. So\nthis is my latest thing and I want to write to the publisher. And I don\u2019t want to say they should\nchange it now, but in case there\u2019s a reprint. Either you leave the whole thing out or say the truth\nhow it is, because Eugena Smolkova can\u2019t be found to go to Auschwitz.",
