        "A: They changed completely. They weren't the same.",
        "Q: Do you remember how you all felt about this?",
        "A: How I felt? Terrible. My father, they took him to the Polish Army. My mother was left\nwith five children and we didn't have to eat much, and I remember a German man came\nto our house and he said in German \"Vvielleicht meine Frau und Kinder, sie leiden auch,\"\nlike their children suffered too. He told my mother you're so young and you're beautiful.\nLeave here, take your children and go, but my mother had a mother that she had red eyes\nand she was old and she wouldn't leave her mother. She had a sister one sister she was\nthe most beautiful girl in the whole city but blonde hair. She was only 18 years old and\none sister had two children and my mother wouldn't leave her sister. So, they didn't leave\nso she sent away her sister, the 18 year old with white blonde hair but me and my brother\n\u2014 my brother is in Israel now, he's younger, four years, than me and a sister two years\nyounger \u2014 she sent us away to the Russian side, so the border we couldn't go through so\nat night we went through because it was already closed, the border. We had a very hard\ntime getting through there. We came to Lomza. It was in Poland, a place where my\nmother left. She was wearing a green scarf and she was crying. I said, \u201cMommy don't\ncry. We're going to see each other. It's not going to take long.\u201d Who knew for the rest of\nmy life I'd never see her again? We left and my aunt brought us there. She brought us to\nLomza. My father wasn't there. My father was in the army and he came back home so I\nwas praying that my mother's going to come. Then my father came alone and my aunt\ngave us away in an orphanage and she left to bring my mother, to bring the whole family\nhere and she gave us to an orphanage, and I was crying every single day. Every single\nday, \u201cWhere's my mommy? I don't have my mommy. I want my mommy.\u201d I was young.",
        "Q: How old were you?",
        "A: I was at that time about ten years old and my brother was little. He was about four years\nyounger than me and my sister was two years younger than me and we're all in an\norphanage in Lomza and we were crying.\nI was crying the most because when I was young I used to go up to mother like this\nholding her by her dress. I was very attached to my mother. So, what happened, my\n; \u201cMaybe my wife and children are suffering, too\u201d (German)\nfather came by himself, for my aunt was there and she never came back.",
        "Q: Did you find out what happened?",
        "A: She wanted to pass the border but they wouldn't let her, a few times. My father was afraid\nto leave us and I was crying so much when I saw just my father. I said, \u201cNo it can't be\nthat my father came alone.\u201d My father a few times he went again to bring my mother but\nhe couldn't pass the border. That, we were separated. We were separated and the war\nstarted again. We went from Lomza to Lakhva \u2014 with my father.",
        "Q: You never found out any more?",
        "A: Yes, I found out. It was one man that my father thought \u2014 Zalewski\u2019 was his name \u2014 that\nhe is the biggest antisemite, the other people, he thought they were nice. And he helped\nmy mother. He helped the brother put her in a ghetto and they brought her food and they\nwere helping her. It's the only person that we thought was the biggest antisemite \u2014 he was\nhelping my mother. We went to Lakhva to a small town and I went to the Russian school\nthere. I was very good in school, and my father was so proud of me. \u201cThe war is going to\nfinish and we're going to see your mother and everybody is going to come together.\u201d My\nfather wrote to Stalin a letter that he should let my mother come and if the war wouldn't\nhave started my mother would have come with the children. All the family would come.\nBut the war started and the Germans came, and we again are in trouble, run away from\nthe Germans. So, when the Germans came it started being a lot of trouble.",
        "Q: What year is this do you remember?",
        "A: What year he Germans came? I think it's '41 or '42. I can't remember the dates, but I\nknow when it started the ghetto, 1t was in September because the ghetto started and my\nfather was \u2014 they made him in the committee, then we started listening and hearing. I\nwanted to run off from the ghetto. So we had people that were police in the ghetto \u2014\nJewish people, young guys. So I started running out of the ghetto to steal bread \u2014 because\nI was a tomboy \u2014 to bring some bread, not steal, bring some bread to the house. We\nshould have something to eat. I just didn't eat by myself and I brought bread when I ran\nout of the ghetto. I gave to lots of people. I say, \u201cIf I'm going to be hungry and if I'm\ngoing to die, if they're going to die, if I'm going to live, I want them to live too. Why\nshould I live and they should die?\u201d So, I gave to everybody a piece to that, and a piece to\nthat, and then one time I wanted to run out and a policeman \u2014 like a Jewish policeman, he\nwas for us good and he wasn't for the Germans \u2014 he said, \u201cYou know somebody is going\nto catch you and they're going to kill you.\u201d One time it happened that before the ghetto\nstart, a German man with a blind eye came and he said, \u201cDoes Jews live here?\u201d and I said\n\u201cno.\u201d And he went in and Jews were living there and he came out and he was beating me\nso much. He was beating me like he wanted to kill me. Then he was gone, so I run away\n* Stanislaw Zalewski\nand I came to a neighbor of ours under the bed I was laying and when he came he said,\n\u201cWhere is the maid? Ich will sie totschlagen.\u201c\" He would have killed me. Because for\nthem to say a lie is the worst thing that you could do. That's before the ghetto started. I\nwas so beaten I couldn't see. I couldn't walk for weeks. That much he beat me. And then I\nstarted with the ghetto.",
        "Q: Let me just stop you for a second. I want to hear a little bit about how the ghetto came\ninto being, I mean if you remember what life was like in Lakhva and how long you were\nthere before you were confined.",
        "A: In Lakhva, the people were very nice. They were very good. Like when we came the\nRussians were still there. So, the neighbors, they brought butter milk and that brought\nbread. That became, we were like strangers there, and everybody brought something else.\nMe, my father and my sister when we came, and my brother and my sister and my father.\nThey were so friendly. It really was very, very nice. I had a friend. She's still in New\nYork next door, like the next house, and we became very close friends.",
        "Q: Were most of the people you associated with in Lakhva Jewish or everybody?",
        "A: Mostly Jewish, in Belorus also, but the Belorus people weren't as bad as \u2014 they became\nbad when the Germans came, but they weren't as bad. Like my mother's sister had\nbeautiful things. She was young. I gave it away it somebody and when I came back after\nthe war she wouldn't give me nothing back. They were takers. They didn't like Jews.\nNobody did.",
        "Q: Did you go to school in Lakhva?",
        "A: Yes. I went to the Russian school.",
        "Q: How long were you in Lakhva before the ghetto was formed?",
        "A: I can't remember. The ghetto was formed in 1942 probably.",
        "Q: I can give you that date but I'm trying to figure out how long you were there. Was it\nweeks, was it months?",
        "A: It was a few months, not too long, a few months, and then they started the ghetto.",
        "Q: The ghetto I believe was formed in 1942?\n*<T want to kill her\u201d (German)",
        "A: I think it was 1942. I can't remember that, like my memory got completely \u2014 especially\nthat time, I have no memory of that. I can't remember the dates at all.",
        "Q: So, you were in Lakhva several months before the ghetto?",
        "A: In the ghetto before the Germans came, several months, yes.",
        "Q: Weren't the Germans there for a while before the ghetto?",
        "A: Yes. The Germans came. I was in Lakhva maybe more than a year, maybe a year and half\nor two before \u2014 I think maybe a year and half. I can't remember how long when the\nGermans came. I don't even remember which year they came. I can't remember, but my\nmemory slipped completely about that.",
        "Q: So, when the Germans came to Lakhva, did they form the ghetto immediately?",
        "A: Not long after, a few months.",
        "Q: What was the ghetto like?",
        "A: A few families were in one house, they lived in one house, like three or four families. We\nhad like \u2014 we made, it wasn't beds, it was like they made they put like wood on the top\nand on the bottom something like that to sleep and there were a few families living\ntogether in the ghetto, and then we started hearing that they are going to kill the Jews.\nWhen they're going to kill the Jews then somebody came and they said to my father that,\n\u201cT think it's going to happen in the next few days.\u201d So, when they started talking about\nburning everything, like all the things we have, we should burn. Nobody should have it.\nNot the Belorus, not the Germans, should get nothing that we have. We started putting\ngasoline when we knew that the next day we're going to get killed. So we saw everybody\nwhat they were standing. I went out, I remember, very early in the morning and I saw the\nGermans pulling up with guns, with all kinds of things, they were holding like this, you\nknow, everything, and they were pointing at the ghetto. My father was running out of the\nhouse and I didn't know what he said. \u201cYou wait here. Don't go anyplace. We have to be\ntogether now.\u201d And they started burning. It wasn't just my father, it was lots of people. I\nreally can't remember their names, but Lopatyn\u201d was one of these. His name should be\nforgotten really. I remember even how he looked, and then there was other people too.\nThey burned everything. They started burning and there was smoke, and I saw there was\na bridge not far from us and I saw friends of mine sitting with the feet holding like this,\nand they were taking them to a cemetery to shoot them.\n> Dov Lopatyn (1900-1944), head of Lakhva Judenrat and former Zionist leader.\nAnd my father said like that \u201clet's run.\u201d Before we were running, I was near water. The\nwater was death, they called the water death like \u201csmierc\u201d in Polish. And I saw the\nGermans. They were fighting with the Jews with knives and with ax and there as one man\na Rev-Zionist , the same party as Begin, and he was holding an ax on a German over the\nhead in the water, and the German killed him right away and they went to a doctor. And I\nsaw this, and I was standing with my father and my brother and my sister with their\nhands like this. My father said, \u201cDon't go away. We have to be with each other. Maybe\nwe'll run away.\u201d So, it was burning and here I saw something that I took so much\nrevenge, I said to myself, \u201cI'm going to die anyway in a few minutes. It's going to now.\u201d\nYou didn't think you're going to survive, you're going to live. Who's going to live?\nNobody thought they were going to live, but at least before I die I'm going to have\nrevenge, and I saw that Rochczyn\u2019 \u2014 a man, he was belonging to the party like Begin and\nhe gave with the ax over the head. So, a man, a doctor was there. He was from Warsaw\nhimself, he came like we came, in the wartime, running away from the Germans. So, they\ntold him like that, \u201cWe're going to save all your family if you're going to save that\nGerman.\u201d He says, \u201cYou could kill me too because I don't give a damn anymore because\nI'm not going save him \u2014 he could die.\u201d But Rochczyn right away they shot him. He got\nkilled in the water, but they were fighting with knives, with anything they had, they said,\n\u201cWe're not going to let ourselves just take to the death just like that.\u201d They took only the\nweak.",
        "Q: What did you do to get your revenge?",
        "A: What I did? I was running with my father. We were running away because we saw\npeople running, we run too. It was open, the ghetto, they opened the doors there. We\nstarted running, and there was gardens there, beautiful gardens that people made when I\ntook up, I was my mouth was so wet like I thought I was going to die right away, so I got\na pickle there, I bent down and I got a pickle, and all the four of us together, and I took\nthat pickle in my mouth and I was holding for ten kilometers were running. It was a place\n\u2014 Prypec, they called. Then I found my friend there with a bullet in it and the blood was\ngoing. Fanny Eisen.",
        "Q: Your friend from next door in the ghetto?",
        "A: Yes, she's in New York now. I took off my shirt and I bandaged her. We didn't know\nwhat we were doing. We run again and we left her there, because there was lots of people\nthere, lots of \u2014 we saw so many people there running away from the ghetto.",
        "Q: Was she with her family also?\n\u00b0 Union of Zionists Revisionists; militant political Zionists movement founded and led by\nVladimir Jabotinsky.\n\" Itzak Rochezyn (1915-1942),Jewish resistance fighter.",
        "A: She was running away by herself, but you know we didn't even know what we were\ndoing because we were like crazy people. My father, we were running right, one after the\nother. My father said \u201ccome\u201d and my sister got winded when we were running, and I\nthought she was running after us because there were woods and trees, and I thought she\nwas running after me, and I looked in the back and I didn't see my sister anymore. I saw\nmy brother and my father. I said \u201cWhere is my sister?\u201d So, she was there, so I said to the\npeople that were running with us \u2014, a whole bunch of people, many people \u2014 I said, \u201cIf\nyou're not going to go after my sister, I'm going to scream so loud that all the Germans\nare going to come and kill us too, because I don't want to leave her, I'm not going to see\nmy sister.\u201d Everybody was running back because they were afraid that I'm going to\nscream, and I was a very tomboy. I used to bring food to the ghetto and I used to do such\nthings that a child that age would never do, now especially. The kids, we had to be grown\nup before we grew up so we run back and we didn't find my sister anymore and I was\ncrying for months. We run away, lying in the woods at night.\nIt was the time of the Jewish holidays and it was cold at night and I didn't have nothing, a\nlittle dress, and I threw away my shoes so I had bare feet. Everybody had nothing to wear\nand it was cold and we couldn't make a fire at night because the Germans would come\nand see us. So, quite a few people were running away from there. We run, we run, we\ndidn't know where we were running. We went into a White-Russian house to take a piece\nof bread because we didn't have nothing to eat. I still had my pickle.",
        "Q: You were living in the woods?",
        "A: In the woods. All these years, till the war is finished, we were living in the woods.",
        "Q: Can I go back a little bit. When the ghetto was formed, how long do you remember, not\ndates, but how long you were there until you burned the ghetto down and left? Do you\nhave a sense, was it months?",
        "A: Just a few months, not long.",
        "Q: Did you have pretty much what you needed? Was there enough food?",
        "A: There was nothing, there was nothing. It was just a piece of bread we got like a small\npiece of bread a day. No, people were hungry. That's why I ran out of the ghetto to bring\nsomething but they didn't let me after.",
        "Q: Was it initially fairly easy for you to get out?",
        "A: Well, I was little, so I just went out. I took out, we had to wear a star in the front and the\nback and I took off the star and I went out. I thought, \u201cIf I'm going to do that they're\ngoing to kill me.\u201d And I knew they would.",
        "Q: Was there school? Were there any activities?",
        "A: Nothing, no school nothing. No.",
        "Q: Were people getting sick?",
        "A: Yes, I had typhus. I got typhus and I told my father, \u201cPapa you go because I'm not going\nto live anyway. So, at least you and my brother is going to be alive.\u201d But he wouldn't\nleave me. But after, we got separated.",
        "Q: Let me just before we get to that, now your father was on the Jewish council in the\nghetto, is that right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember how that happened, what he did?",
        "A: They were just having meetings and I think the meetings were discreet that they were\nafraid to talk about it, what they talked. That's why they burned. When he said, when they\nwent to burn the ghettos, they said, \u201cWait, don't go nowhere.\u201d",
        "Q: How did your father get selected to be on the Jewish council?",
        "A: I think because he was very smart, because he had a mouth to talk. I think he could have\neven been a president, but not in Poland he didn't have a chance to be anything.",
        "Q: How many people were on the council? Was it men and women?",
        "A: Men.",
        "Q: How many?",
        "A: I can't remember now. It was lots. I think five, six, seven people.",
        "Q: Do you know if your dad had any special responsibilities or roles as a member of the\ncouncil?",
        "A: I don't think anybody \u2014 any \u2014 too many responsibilities. They only had the responsibility\n\u2014 like everybody used to get a piece of bread. They brought in bread to the ghetto like a\npiece, a few ounces of bread they should give everybody you know like they used to\ncome to bring the bread, to take the bread in the committee, like they had to give\nsomething like a few ounces of bread a day. That's all.",
        "Q: So they were involved in distributing?",
        "A: Something like that, yes.",
        "Q: Was there a Jewish police group?",
        "A: Yes, there was a Jewish police group, yes. They keep the ghetto, they keep the people\nthat they shouldn't run out. They shouldn't do anything that they should get killed. They\nprotected the people.",
        "Q: So, the council and the police \u2014",
        "A: Worked together.",
        "Q: They worked together and they had to answer to the Germans but \u2014",
        "A: They answered to the Germans that they kept that their people shouldn't get killed. That\ntime I think they didn't know that they're going to take all the Jews and kill them. They\nthought it was going to be a ghetto and soon the war is going to stop. It's not going to be\nforever. Nobody knew it was going to be so many years.",
        "Q: Do you think they followed all of the German orders or \u2014",
        "A: They followed the orders. If they followed the orders they wouldn't burn the ghetto. They\nwould have gone like sheep and died but I don't think anybody of these people \u2014 these\npeople were different kind of people. They heard lots of things and they say, \u201cNo,\nnobody is going to kill us like a sheep, we're not sheep, we're people we are human\nbeings and we're not going to go just like that. Nobody is going to kill us, nobody is\ngoing to kill us without a fight. We're going to die anyway but at least we're going to\nhave a fight. We're going to do something about it.\u201d",
        "Q: Were you aware of any political organizations, movements?",
        "A: No, I was too young to be aware of these things.",
        "Q: So, did people have weapons?",
        "A: No, nothing. Only they took ax and knives. They didn't have anything. They didn't have\nno ammunition at all. If they would have ammunition it would be different. I think half of\nthe Germans would be killed.",
        "Q: Is that why they decided to burn the ghetto?",
        "A: They decided to burn the ghetto for one reason. That they shouldn't see like it was such a\nsmoke that you wouldn't see where a German is \u2014 where a Jew is. The Germans they\ndidn't see the people, that's why we were able to run. That's the only reason we were able\nto tear up, it was like the ghetto was closed with wires, and we were able to open these\nwires. The first person that opened these wires, died, but then the people started running\nbecause it was opened. It was like a wire like you could hurt yourself. It wasn't like\nelectric, but you could hurt yourself.",
        "Q: Do you know how long people had thought about doing this?",
        "A: I don't know how long they talked, but I know the last few days when they said they're\ngoing to kill the Jews that they were talking about it.",
        "Q: You don't know if it had been planned for a while?",
        "A: No, I don't think it was planned for a while. They didn't know, when they knew they were\ngoing to kill the Jews, they knew a day before, but the Germans thought the Jews were\ngoing to go. They couldn't know when they're going to get killed because they're going to\nkill them anyway like everybody is going to go like a sheep. Every place they went like\nsheep, so they're going to go here like sheep, too. But the only thing they didn't think was\nhere that these people are different kind of people. These people will not go like sheep.\nThey won't let themselves get killed like that. They'll fight and they'll do everything they\ncould to make them impossible to do something, to just take the people to the graves.",
        "Q: Why do you think that your community acted so differently?",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 I think that there were many like a Rev-Zionist. They came from the party that\nwas Begin's not like any other party. These people are very tough. These people wouldn't\nlet themselves, like that Rochczyn. You know I still see him. He had glasses on. I see him\nhow he looks. I'll never forget his face, that beautiful face that \u2014 he took an ax. He was\ntaking an ax and giving the German over the head you can't imagine in that moment how\nas a child I felt that you don't just let yourself get killed, but you kill back. You do\nsomething about it. I felt that in a few minutes I'm going to fall down anyway.\nThey're going to shoot me, because they were shooting, but I didn't care if I'm going to\ndie, because that time you don't care. You haven't got anything to think about that you're\ngoing to survive. Nobody does. You think well I'm going to die. At least I'm going to die\nknowing that a German got killed even if it's one or two or three that somebody \u2014 that\nthey just didn't go like sheeps.",
        "Q: So this was a real spiritual turning point for you?",
        "A: That was something that I felt so good inside even though I knew I'm not going to live. I\ndidn't think that now I'm going to sit now and talk to somebody about it. That I'll be able\nto tell my story, never.",
        "Q: When it was decided that you were going to burn the ghetto down, and \u2014 I don't know \u2014\nwho's idea this was?",
        "A: It was a few people, and I think it has a lot to do with these Zionist people, a lot. These\npeople were tough.",
        "Q: So, there was a strong relationship between the Zionist movement and the council?",
        "A: Oh yes, definitely, for sure.",
        "Q: When it was decided to burn the ghetto down, did you know immediately what you were\ndoing?",
        "A: I think we knew. My father said, \u201cWait a minute, I need gasoline.\u201d You know like\nnaphtha \u2014 we didn't have electricity there like we had very little electricity, so they put\nthe lamps with \u2014 just a little bit we had, but it was enough. The old ghetto was burned.\nThere was nothing left of it. Nothing in one house, nothing, because I was there after the\nwar. I came after the war there and there was nothing left at all. But you know, even after\nthe war when we came I was proud to come there. I lived there over a year. They took\naway my father to the army. I met my father back when they took him away to the\nRussian army. I lived there for a year for sure and I gave him my brother to the\norphanage because I didn't have any money and I went to the orphanage after the war. I\ntook my brother and I went on the train and they told me \u201cdo you have a ticket?\u201d I didn't\nhave a piece a bread even to eat and I was very young. I said, \u201cWhat kind of ticket. I went\nthrough a war, and I was sitting in the woods for so many years, do you think I have\nmoney to buy a ticket? You can kill me if you want, but I'm not going to give you\nnothing. I'm going to take my brother and go and if you want to take me off of that train,\nyou'll have to kill me first.\u201d So, they let me through. I took my brother to Pinsk after the\nwar in an orphanage. I only wanted that they dress him up and I should be able to see him\nagain from that orphanages, from the Russians and I'll bring him back home because he\ndidn't have nothing to wear. He didn't have nothing to eat, so I brought him there.",
        "Q: You were a brave little girl?",
        "A: I had to be.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a bit about what happened when you were in the woods. We started to\ntalk about that earlier. You were there for years. Who else was out there?",
        "A: There were Russian people there. There were lots of partisans around us. I was living\nthere. I couldn't find my father, but I found him after.",
        "Q: Let's go back to where you lost your sister, did you ever find her again?",
        "A: No, after the war I found out that they killed her. They found her and they killed her, the\nGermans.",
        "Q: While you were running to the woods, okay. When you went to the woods, did you notice\nthe local people on the way. Were they helpful?",
        "A: Everyone helped one another, especially the Jewish people.",
        "Q: What about the farmers or whoever lived along there?",
        "A: The farmers, if they would see us, they would give us to the Germans. We couldn't let\nnobody see us.",
        "Q: So the local people \u2014?",
        "A: The place where we used to live, there were lots of partisans there, so you know the\npartisans did something. They took everybody from the house to the partisans, like every\nman that was let's say somebody had a son, somebody had a husband, so they couldn't go\nand squeal because they would squeal on their own. So, we were able to live around there\nto be hidden.",
        "Q: I'm a little confused. When you say the people where you used to live everybody was\npartisans, where are you talking about?",
        "A: When we lived in the woods, they went into these little towns, like in the country houses,\nand they took \u2014 the partisans took from each family a member, two members \u2014 like if\nsomebody had two sons \u2014 to the partisans.",
        "Q: As hostages?",
        "A: Not hostages, they should fight for the Russians.",
        "Q: They were all willing to do that?",
        "A: Yes, they were willing to do that. Let's say the mother is not going to squeal, not going to\ngo to the Germans and say \u201cmy son is a partisan.\u201d So, we were around these people,\nhidden around these people.",
        "Q: So, the Russian partisans were able to pull a lot of the local communities 1n?",
        "A: Oh, yes. They took a lot of communities in.",
        "Q: Then they were loyal to you because their families were involved?",
        "A: Yes. They used to hide us. They used to keep us. They were afraid like I was by a\nUkrainian woman and she used to think of me like her child.",
        "Q: So when you said earlier the local people would have shot you, not all of the local\npeople?",
        "A: No, not all, but these places where we were, these people wouldn't do it because of these\nmen that they took away, they mobilized these people. They say, \u201cyou're going to come,\nyou're going to fight for us.\u201d The partisans were around all over. So, they couldn't do it,\nthey wouldn't do it.",
        "Q: Were there many partisan groups?",
        "A: Around us? We saw many, but they saved a lot of Jews too.",
        "Q: Did they all cooperate with each other?",
        "A: Yes. They weren't bad people.",
        "Q: So, there were many partisan groups that worked individually but supported each other?",
        "A: Yes, in the woods. I think they saved so many Jewish people, so many people, like so\nmany children. They did a lot of things for the Jews. They didn't care if you were a Jew\nor not. They didn't know the difference. They didn't know the difference even, what's a\nJew and what's not a Jew. Like one child asked the father, \u201cAm I a Jew too?\u201d He was\nJewish like he didn't know.",
        "Q: Were there a lot of other kids there? Were there men, were there women, what was the\nage range?",
        "A: There were lots of kids, lots.",
        "Q: Who took care of you all?",
        "A: We took care of ourselves.",
        "Q: Were there women who started trying to take care of you because your mother wasn't\nthere?",
        "A: I met a Ukrainian women. She took care of me. Then when time passed by, like maybe\ntwo years I didn't see my father and my brother and we found him after.",
        "Q: So, you all got separated?",
        "A: We got separated, yes.",
        "Q: How long were you in the woods before you got separated?",
        "A: Maybe seven months something like that.",
        "Q: Were you still with your friend?",
        "A: I met my friend after. Somebody told me my friend is living not far from me and I went\nover. I walked with somebody, a man that he was a journalist before the war but he was\nin the partisans and I asked him, \u201cplease, could you take me?\u201d He was a Jewish man. I\nsaid, \u201cCould you take me to see, I think I heard that my friend is living in that place, so\nand so\u201d \u2014 I don't remember the name of the place, but it wasn't far. We had to walk\nmaybe an hour, hour and half. He said, \u201csure, come with me.\u201d I went there and the father\nwas sitting there and he said \u201cI'm going to take Feigele (ph). I found out she's alive and\nI'm going to bring her \u2014 she's with people. She's by people.\u201d So, I said, \u201ccould I come\nwith you?\u2019 He says \u201csure.\u201d When I came over there she was full of lice, you know, and\nyou know what we did, we took ashes. We didn't have any soap, and we take the ashes\nand we put in a piece of cloth by Christian people, like Russian people and we put some\ncloth and we had warm water, you didn't have water. You had to bring water from\noutside. We didn't have water in the house. We made her we put her in something to\nmake her a box and took her out from these and then we went back with her and I took\nher out and I had lice all over my hands. We washed her once and another time with\nwater and then the woman gave us something to dry her. These people didn't have\nanything to dry her and she got dressed up with something that she had. She didn't have\nnothing to wear. Then her father took her back and we were sleeping at night and she\ndreamed her grandmother said that Germans were running after us and they were going\nto kill us, and I had a dream too and I woke up and I was screaming. I says, \u201cYou know\nthey're going to kill us again.\u201d The whole nights, all these years I have dreams. I always\nwake up with dreams that they they're going to kill my family. I have three children now,\nthat they're going to kill my children and I'm going to be alone again. I'm going to have\nnobody. So, that time, we both fell asleep and we dreamed that we're running and we're\nrunning and they're going to kill us. Somebody's going to kill us. They're running after\nus. She said, \u201cI have such a dream that they're going to kill us again,\u201d and I said, \u201cyes, I\nhave the same dream.\u201d We woke up in a sweat. I stayed with her for a few days and I\nwent back where I was, where that Ukrainian woman, she took care of me very much.",
        "Q: Do you think when you look back on this that life was different for girls and for women\nthan it was for the men and the boys?",
        "A: I think so. A woman wasn't \u2014 I think by the Russians a woman was more than it was by\nthe Poles or someplace else. But I think that it was a difference, like they thought a\nwoman can do nothing, men could do more. Even no matter how aggressive you were\nand how much you were able to do so a woman is not much, she can do as much as a\nman.",
        "Q: You were a tough kid. Did you feel that your responsibilities were the same as the boys\nyour age or that you were treated differently?",
        "A: I didn't think at that time how I was treated. I just felt \u201cI'm going to survive and I'm going\nto look where my father is.\u201d I didn't think about anything. I didn't think how they're going\nto treat me how they treat me. I knew I had to survive and I'm going to do everything\npossible to do it.",
        "Q: When you were with the partisans did everybody have certain responsibilities?",
        "A: We had the responsibility to help in the garden. Like I was with the Ukrainian woman,\nwe went \u2014 I wanted to milk the cows, I learned how to milk. I went to the fields with the\npotatoes. It wasn't like now they have tractors. I worked. I helped them. I loved to do it. I\nloved it.",
        "Q: Were the boys working in the fields also?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Everybody?",
        "A: Everybody.",
        "Q: So everyone worked together?",
        "A: Together, yes.",
        "Q: Do you know if when they made certain decisions whether the women were included in\nmaking decisions or whether it was much the way \u2014?",
        "A: I think the men only, not the women. They told the women what to do. I don't think the\nwomen made any decisions all together.",
        "Q: Women filled a very traditional role?",
        "A: Yes. Even the Russians, they thought \u201cA Jew can't even fight. He doesn't even know how\nto fight. How a Jew could fight.\u201d But, the Jews \u2014 they gave them guns and they were\nfighting.",
        "Q: So, even in the partisan groups, they were very good to the Jews but they wanted to make\ntheir own decisions and they didn't include the Jews in these?",
        "A: No, they took the Jews to fight also, but they didn't \u2014 I don't think they thought a Jew\ncould fight as much as a non-Jew. I don't believe that they thought that.",
        "Q: So, from the way that these groups were organized, was most of the decision making\ndone by the Soviets?",
        "A: Yes, the Soviets, but I don't think they made a difference between a Jew and a non-Jew.\nThe only thing they thought was that the people by themselves, not in the more like\nsomebody was a lieutenant, or they run away from the army or something, they run away\nfrom the Germans, I don't think they thought about the Jew being different. I don't\nbelieve feeling even then by Ukrainian women that I was a Jew. She didn't think of me as\na Jew. She thought of me as a little girl that's run away from a ghetto and she wants to\nsurvive and she wants to help me.",
        "Q: I understand that, what I'm trying to figure out is initially when you joined these\npeople, was there a structure in place where the non-Jews were making the decisions and\nthey were basically hiding you and you were helping them but it was their movement, or\nwas everybody \u2014",
        "A: No, I think the men made the decision mostly, the Soviet men.",
        "Q: The Soviet men, or Soviet and Jewish men?",
        "A: I think there were a lot of Jewish men that they made decisions too. They were\nlieutenants or like big shots. They made decisions too.",
        "Q: Now, let me ask you a slightly different question. Were you \u2014 did you come from a\nreligious family?",
        "A: No, not a religious but non not religious either. We ate kosher in the house \u2014 like even\nnow, I'm not going to eat pork. I can't even if I want to.",
        "Q: So when you were in the woods, and you were in the woods for several years?",
        "A: We had to eat whatever they had, but I never ate pork. If I knew in the woods that's Yom\nKippur \u2014 one time a friend, he is now in Montreal but he went to Toronto to live \u2014 he\npassed by. When he told, \u201ctoday is Yom Kippur,\u201d he passed by like he didn't have\nnothing to wear and I saw him and I didn't even believe he's alive. And he passed by and\nhe said to me, \u201ctoday is Yom Kippur.\u201d I didn't eat. I didn't want to eat anything even\nthough we didn't have much to eat, we were hungry most of the time. We were in the\nwater and that Ukrainian woman said to me that the Germans were on the top.\nThey were shooting. They surrounded us, the Germans, and we were lying in the water\nvery deep like in the time that was in the woods already, and we're lying. She said to me,\n\u201cMake with your feet like this because otherwise the feet will fall off. They came off,\u201d\nshe said, \u201cmake with your feet, just work with them, just like exercise with them, do\nsomething, because otherwise you're going to lose your feet.\u201d Up there they were\nshooting us with airplanes and around they were shouting, the Germans were running. In\nthe middle of that the partisans came and they started fighting with the Germans. You\nknow they were going like, how could I say it in English \u2014 even if I\u2019m so many years,\nsince I was 18 years old in Canada \u2014 na shtyki\u2019, they were going with big knives like this\none on one. They didn't care. They said, \u201cwe're going to get killed, we're going to get\nkilled,\u201d and we were lying in the water and all of sudden from nowhere they came and\nthey saved probably our lives at that time.",
        "Q: Were there other holidays that you were aware of?",
        "A: No. I didn't even know which day it was. We didn't have calendars, we didn't have\nnothing.",
        "Q: So religion wasn't that important to you while you were hiding out?",
        "A: It wasn't not important, I wasn't aware of anything. You don't think about anything. You\nonly think that you have to survive and if you had a piece of bread or if you have\nsomething \u2014 you know what I was praying. I was sitting down and I was praying, \u201cIf I'm\n* with bayonets (Russian)\ngoing to be able to live, and if I'm going to survive, am I going to have bread on the table\nas much as I want to eat. I should be able to eat enough. Is that going to happen? I want\nto be warm. I don't want to be cold anymore. I should be able to just be in a warm, lie\ndown in a warm oven.\u201d Because they had ovens that they were baking and cooking there\nyou know, \u201cand I should like down there just to feel the warmth and just have bread. Am\nI ever going to have that? Is it ever going to happen to me?\u201d",
        "Q: You had no idea?",
        "A: No.\nTape #2",
        "Q: I want to hear a little bit more about what your life was like when you were in the woods\nbecause now we think you were probably in the woods for three years, right?",
        "A: A few years, yes. About two years I think I ran away in '42, from '42 to '45. It was quite a\nfew years, yes.",
        "Q: Was there a typical day?",
        "A: I think every day we were scared. Every day we were running someplace out. Everyday\nwe were struggling to have something to eat because it was very bad with food. I was like\na toothpick, you know. It was such hard times that it's very hard to describe times like\nthat. We were from one place to another. Even that one I was running, if not that I knew\nthat the partisans were around I wouldn't have survived, never. Sometimes they used to\ngive us to eat, they used to give us to eat \u2014 but most of the time we sometimes we used to\nsteal a piece of bread because we didn't have any, that woman even. Many times we went\nto her house when we knew the partisans were around, in the winter, in the house. We\nwent to her garden. She was to me like a mother, couldn't be better.",
        "Q: When you were out picking vegetables or potatoes, whose garden was it?",
        "A: Sometimes their gardens.",
        "Q: Gardens?",
        "A: Sometimes we used to make a fire, a small fire in the daytime. At night we were afraid.\nWe used to take and bake them inside, with the ashes and bake them and eat them.\nSometimes we used to eat raw, especially at night we were afraid to make a fire so we\nwere freezing.",
        "Q: Were these anybody's gardens?",
        "A: Everybody's. We used to pass by. Sometimes we used to steal a chicken, burn the\nfeathers and make it. I can't even describe how the used to make it. That woman used to\nmake it.",
        "Q: You were on the move all the time?",
        "A: All the time. Moved from one place. Not even three days in one place, sometimes we\nused to stay a few days in one place, make ourselves go and bring something. We would\nbring some bread from the partisans and bring some potatoes and bring something we ate,\nand we stayed a few days and then we heard the Germans are coming and we run again.\nWe run from one place to another. We never were in one place. We didn't stay too long in\none place. We couldn't.",
        "Q: Did you stay with one group of partisans?",
        "A: No, we didn't stay with a group of partisans. We stayed with lots of people. We went\nfrom one group to another one.",
        "Q: But they all treated you nice?",
        "A: They treated me nice. They treated us good.",
        "Q: How many were in your group running?",
        "A: The only time I thought, \u201cIf I'm going to get killed there, it's not going to be as a Jew, it's\ngoing to be as a human being, as a person.\u201d I was with these people, and I met the\npartisans in the woods.",
        "Q: Did that make you feel any better?",
        "A: Yes, even if you get killed, at least you're not going to get killed because you're a Jew.\nFor what? Because you're Jewish. Because you happen to be born a Jew. The only time\nthat I can think of that.",
        "Q: It made a lot more sense to you?",
        "A: It made a lot more sense.",
        "Q: Were you in constant fear?",
        "A: Yes, all the time.",
        "Q: Now, when you were running because you said you were moving quite a bit, how many\npeople would normally be traveling with you?",
        "A: There were lots of Jewish kids that ran away without their parents. They didn't have their\nparents. They didn't have their mothers, they didn't have the fathers. There were lots.\nThere were about 20 people. Sometimes more, sometimes we met other people on the\nway. Everybody was in different groups, we met different kinds of groups of people in\nthe woods living there like gypsies. The gypsies were living there. They taught me how\nto draw cards, how to \u2014 even though I never believed in it, because the gypsies were\nrunning from the Germans too. They were living in the woods. And they were very nice,\nvery, very nice people, but they were liars. You could never believe anything, but they\nwere living in the woods.\nLots of times we were with gypsies. Sometimes for weeks. We used to make a tent, like a\ntent from wood and we used to sleep there. Like if you make from wood something you\nknow like even if an airplane passes by they don't see it because it's only wood. So, we\nmade like that. These people that were together that we met, every time we met\nsomebody else we were never together with the same people. We always go that you're\ngoing to be here, I'm going to go someplace else because you are afraid you're going to\nstay in one place they're going to get to know that somebody is going to tell on you. But\nwhen I met my father it was different. At that time was like even before the liberation. I\nthought I was liberated already\u2014",
        "Q: I want to get to that, but let me ask you a few more questions about your life in the\nwoods. There were some people who were always with you for long periods of time?",
        "A: Yes, children mostly that run away from the home. Lots of kids after the war \u2014 I have one\nfriend in Israel that she survived. She was there and another one was in New York, but\nshe's in Israel too. She and her brother and her father were there too.",
        "Q: Were these kids about your own age? Were there many adults taking care of you?",
        "A: About my own age, yes. Sometimes without adults, they were by themselves. They went\nto the partisans to get some bread, to get something to eat. They used to give us to eat.\nThey used to go to the partisans and they used to ask, because they weren't far away and\nwe knew it, otherwise we wouldn't be able to survive. So, the only place we were able to\nget to eat, because if you went into a house, to have something to eat and you still some\npeople used to tell they are going to tell on us. Even these people that they weren\u2019t \u2014 they\ndidn't take these in the, in the partisans. You know, like depends on the district you were.\nMany district it took these people to the partisans. You know, like their sons and their \u2014\nyeah?",
        "Q: So you all stuck together, the kids?",
        "A: Yes, but we weren't together at the same time, all the time. We went away and then we\nmet again. We were going because we were afraid. I was especially afraid to stay in one\nplace. I was mostly with that woman, that Ukrainian woman. Wherever she went I was\ngoing with her. She was afraid. Her sons were in the partisans and if they would catch her\nthey would kill her.",
        "Q: Did you get involved in any fighting? I know the Germans were trying to clear that area?",
        "A: No. I was too young for these things.",
        "Q: But you were very aware of fighting all around you?",
        "A: Of course, all the time.",
        "Q: Like what?",
        "A: Like we passed by and we saw a church burning. The people, they put wood, they put\nnails with wood around and we passed by and we heard from fire \u2014 people are screaming\nfrom a big fire, and we couldn't even go near there. The Germans, they put nails in wood\nand they closed it up around and they burned these people, a full church of people. It\nwasn't a church, it was like a house because they didn't believe in churches. They didn't\nbelieve in God, the Russians. It used to be a church but then it was something else.\nI don't know what. They passed by near there, not far. We were in the woods and there\nwas a like one place in the middle of nowhere and they were burning. We heard them\nscreaming.",
        "Q: Do you have any other really outstanding memories of dodging the gunfire or trying to\nkeep safe from the fighting?",
        "A: Keep safe from the fighting, I don't know. So many memories I have but I don't know\nwhere to start. We were always running from something. We were always running from\nfighting.",
        "Q: How did all of this end, and how did you find your father?",
        "A: I was running in the woods, that was before liberation, maybe a few months. They were\nrunning, all of a sudden we come to a place, I see my father and my brother. My father\nwas there working and you know he was repairing shoes for the partisans and that way he\nwas survived and they were sending him to fight. He was fighting, with guns, they were\ngoing to little towns where the Germans were and they were fighting. That's why they\nwere able to keep my brother in the partisans with my father. They were there. When I\nmet him, everything changed. After that, liberation was maybe a few months after, was\nthe liberation and I met my father. He survived with the partisans, really.",
        "Q: So when you saw your father and your brother \u2014",
        "A: You can't imagine. I thought they died already, because when we run away from the\nhouse and I got typhus and I told my father, \u201cPapa leave me because I'm not going to\nlive, you see I'm so sick.\u201d So, my father says, \u201cif I'm going to leave you what is my life\ngoing to be all about? I'm not going to be able to live.\u201d All of sudden we were separated.\nI don't even know how. I can't even explain to you how because when you run,\neverybody runs. You run and all of a sudden there's trees and woods and you don't see\neach other. You don't see where you go. You get separated. I was going with people. I\nwas running. When you're running you don't look where you're going. I thought my\nfather was after me, just like I thought my sister is behind me when I couldn't find her\nanymore. My sister, she died. They killed her after. And she said she would have been\nmy sister was running with me, she said \"Zina, look the blood on my face.\u201d That was\nonly an ear that was wounded and then I run back and I never found her and I thought\nthis happened to my father, the same thing.",
        "Q: So when you saw your father and brother, it must have been like a miracle?",
        "A: It was a miracle. It was such an emotion, I thought to myself, \u201cMy God, I'm not alone in\nthis world. I have my father. I have my brother.\u201d You know I didn't see him after the war.\nI got married I was about 15-1/2 years old and I went to Canada and my father went to\nIsrael. I saw him after 22 years, I didn't see my father and I came to see my father. I think\nhe died from a broken heart. A year later I saw him for the first time. I wasn't able to\nafford, because my husband didn't make a lot of money. I married a man who was 16\nyears older than me. I didn't have such a great life, a very, very hard life. I went to Israel\nafter 22 years being in Canada, I went to Israel to see my father and a year later he dies\nfrom a stroke because I think he lost a wife and three children and he loved my mother\nvery much. He died from a broken heart. That's the only thing I could say, so you could\nimagine that after the war, after I met my father how it was such an emotion to me. I\nthought to myself, \u201cI'm alone in the whole world and here I have somebody. I have a\nbrother, I have my father.\u201d That was unbelievable. I can't even say what happened to me\nat that time. I felt I'm just like somebody else, too. A lot of kids run away. They had their\nfather, they had a sister or a brother. Some were alone. They didn't have nobody.",
        "Q: What happened to this Ukrainian woman?",
        "A: I don't know. After I met my father, I left her in a very nice way. We were going away in\nanother side my father was. I stayed with my father already. We said goodbye to each\nother crying and I never saw her again. I don't know what's happened to her, but I'm sure\nshe survived. I know she had two sons in the Partisans and one died. One got killed. I\nremember their names and I remember how they looked even. She was really special. I\ndon't know if not for her I would be able to survive. I wouldn't be able to live.",
        "Q: What happened after you reunited with your father and brother?",
        "A: After I was with them, I didn't leave them for a moment. I was afraid that if I'm going to\nleave them that they're going to disappear and something is going to happen to them. So,\neven when we're sleeping \u2014 we're sleeping one here and on the floor, in the woods, I was\nafraid I'm going to lose them. I'm not going to be able to find them anymore, so I was\nafraid to leave for a second. Wherever they were I think I was near. I was afraid to leave\nthem. You know, I was very scared. I was a very scared child. You know that even after\nthe war, and the war finished, we were in a camp with my husband, because I married\nyoung in Germany in Hess-Lichtenau\u2019, and I went one time out and I saw a movie. It was\nmy life exactly what I went through in the ghetto, in the woods, with everything. I\nfainted. I fell down on the floor and I fainted and you know for two years I was dizzy. I\ncame to Canada and I was afraid to leave a door closed, because my door was closed I'd\nleave it open. I thought I was going to faint. I was afraid to be alone in the house. My\ndoor was open like anybody could have gone in, if it would be the violence like now, and\nkill me. I was afraid. I came to Canada with a little baby. I was about 18 years old and I\ncame to Canada.",
        "Q: I'm going to get to that but let me just go back. So, when you were with your father and\nbrother, you stayed close to them and you were still out in the wood fighting for a while?",
        "A: Yes, a little while. The liberation was maybe two weeks after, that's all, so we still had\nvery bad time that time, like we were in the water again, for the second time we were\nleaving in the water. Under the water, the Germans were around on the airplanes on the\ntop and they were shooting, and we were lying down in the water again, you know like I\nwould have froze up my feet, my arms. Also, my father was talking like that woman. He\nsaid, \u201cDo something, do something with your feet. Do something with your arms because\nthey're going to fall off.\u2019 About three days later, the liberation was after that, but that\ntime I thought for sure now we're going to die because the airplanes were like this, over\nour heads and the Germans were all around. That time my father was involved with the\npartisans.",
        "Q: You were hiding in the river?",
        "A: In the water, it wasn't a river. It wasn't a river, it was like \u2014it wasn't quick sand, but it\nlooked like quick sand.",
        "Q: Like a swamp?",
        "A: Like a swamp, yes. It is very hard to describe that even. It's impossible, because nobody\ncould understand it.\n\u201d Hessisch-Lichtenau",
        "Q: That you would be hiding in swamps?",
        "A: Dirty, filthy, no food, nothing to eat for days. For days we didn't have a piece of bread.\nThat was after I met my father already, but at least I knew we were together and if we're\ngoing to die, it's going to be all of us. At least we're going to be in one place.",
        "Q: Can you describe liberation?",
        "A: Yes, I could describe liberation because I couldn't believe it. They started screaming that,\n\u201cyou're liberated, you're liberated, we are liberated,\u201d you know, \u201cthe Russians are here,\nwe are liberated,\u201d you know. I was screaming, I was yelling, I was jumping, you know,\nand I was holding my father and my brother like this, like all around and I said \u201cMy God,\nwe are liberated. Can you believe that?\u201d My father at that time was maybe 40 years old,\n42 or something like that.",
        "Q: You saw the Russian troops coming?",
        "A: Yes, the Russians, they came with their music playing. The Russians always \u2014 even when\nwe were in the woods we would hear the Russians. They would always say, \u201csing and\ndance because you never know tomorrow what's going to be.\u201d They are not afraid of\nanything.\nThey're not afraid of nothing, and I told a woman that I wanted to run. She said, \u201cWhat\nare you afraid of something? So, if you're going to die, you die one time. You don't die\ntwice.\u201d I said, \u201cYou know I'm afraid to be in one place all the time.\u201d",
        "Q: You're used to running?",
        "A: I'm used to running, that's right, run. I think I was tough \u2014 I don't think I'd be able to go\nthrough the same thing now. In the mind and I'm thinking now I wouldn't be able to\nsurvive, I don't think so.",
        "Q: Well, you did what you had to do?",
        "A: I was terrible.",
        "Q: Did the Russians treat you well upon liberation?",
        "A: Yes, very well, but after they took away my father into the army right away and left me\nand my brother alone. Like I told you before, they took him to the orphanage, without\nanything. Without any bread without anything. I didn't have nothing to eat after the war,\nnothing.",
        "Q: How long were you with your father and brother after liberation?",
        "A: After liberation, maybe a few weeks. With my brother I was with him all the time, but I\ngave him to the orphanage because I wanted him to go to school. I wanted him to have\nsomething. And I went myself too to school after the war.",
        "Q: Where were you?",
        "A: Lakhva. I came to Lakhva.",
        "Q: Where were you liberated?",
        "A: I came to the Russian side.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry \u2014 where were you liberated?",
        "A: I was liberated near Mazyr. It's a town near Russia there because we were running. We\nrun away so far that we didn't know where we were running. So, we\u2019re liberated around\nthere. Right away we came to that place. It's a big city and they took away my father to\nthe army, and they took my brother and I went to Lakhva to the place \u2014 because I knew\nlots of Jews are there. When I came, I met lots of my friends, lots of people that I was in\nthe woods together who were living in the same house. You see the house the Germans\ntook away and then the Russian people moved in. So, they were Jewish houses, so we\nmoved into the houses. They all lived there. Then I stared \u2014 when I was living there I\nthought to myself, \u201c\u201cWhat am I going to do with my brother? He hasn't got a pair of shoes.\nHe's got bare feet, with nothing on his feet. What am I going to do with him? How ts he\ngoing to go to school?\u201d At that time four years younger than me. I was about 14 years\nold, so he was about ten, so \u201cwhat am I going to do with him?\u201d I have to dress him up at\nleast so I said to my brother, \u201cyou know what\u201d \u2014 in Pinsk there was a big city, there is an\norphanage there and somebody gave me the address. I said, \u201cyou know we'll go together.\nWe'll go on the train.\u201d He said to me, \u201cHow are you going to go on the train?\u201d I said\n\u201cYou don't worry how I'm going to go. I'm going to go, don't worry.\u201d So I told you when\nI went on the train, \u201cyou could kill me because I don't have a ticket.\u201d So I went and got\nhim into the orphanage. Then my father wrote me that he's coming back from the army.\nThen, you know what I did? I went and I stealed him from the orphanage. I told him I'm\ngoing for a walk with him. When I took him out and we went back on the train the same\nthing \u2014 I didn't have any money so I went without money like that. So, I was standing at\nthat time, when they came to control the tickets, you know, the middle [indecipherable]\nthere is a platform. I went to the platform with him and I stood there. When the ticket\ncontrol passed by I went back to the train and that's the way I came back from Lakhva\nfrom Pinsk. It didn't take long. It took maybe an hour. But there an hour,,,. And I brought\nhim back, and we went to my father to Lodz, to Poland. Then I met my husband there.",
        "Q: You met your first husband there?",
        "A: My first husband, in Lodz.",
        "Q: How long were you in Lodz?",
        "A: Not long. I was in Lodz and then my husband says he wants to go to the German side, to\nGermany because from Germany we could go to Canada or Israel. We didn't think to go\nto Canada, but one time when I had my baby and we were standing for milk in a place\nand they said, \u201cYou register for Canada but you're not going to be able to go,\u201d they told\nmy husband, \u201cbecause you have a little baby and that baby's a few months old.\u201d And he\nsaid, \u201cLet me register and maybe we'll see,\u201d because he was a tailor and they needed\ntailors. Then they called us to the UNRRA\u201d. We came to Canada in 1948.",
        "Q: Where did you leave your father and your brother? Where did you leave them behind?",
        "A: In Lodz. My father went before to Germany. He left us behind when I got married\nbecause my father didn't want me to get married. My father said to me, \u201cyou're too\nyoung\u201d and he said to me \u201cyou could be a lawyer.\u201d I said, \u201ca woman a lawyer?\u201d He said,\n\u201cWhat's wrong with women?\u201d You see my father was modern, even in these years. My\nfather thought, \u201cWhat's wrong with women? You're more smart than any man I know.\nWhy can't you be a lawyer.\u201d He wanted me to go because I was very good in school. I\nwent to school and I used to make two grades in one year. So, he told me I have to go to\nschool to study and make something of myself. What I'm going to make I want it to be\nadvocate. He said, \u201cwoman, a girl,\u201d he said \u201cwhat's wrong with girls? There's nothing\nwith girls. A girl could be a lawyer, too. They more smart than men are, some women.\u201d\nSo, I didn't listen to him and I said, \u201cPapa I'm going to go away if you're not going to let\nme get married.\u201d I fell in love with my husband. He was in a Polish uniform. It was after\nthe army, and he was 16 years older than me, but I didn't know it at that time. If I knew I\nwould get scared.",
        "Q: He was in the Polish army?",
        "A: After the war, he was in the Russian army and then he went into the Polish army.",
        "Q: He was Jewish?",
        "A: Yes.\n'\u00b0 United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration",
        "Q: So, you left your father and brother in Lodz?",
        "A: No, my father went to Germany before. My father went to Germany and he said that,\n\u201cYou're going to come after.\u201d So, we went after. We didn't come to the same place. My\nfather was in Ulm, and I was in Hess-Lichtenau, near Kassel.",
        "Q: But you traveled from Lakhva to Lodz with your father?",
        "A: No. I traveled \u2014 yes, from Lakhva to Lodz with my father and brother, yes. Then when\nwe met we didn't separate anymore but then I separated when I got married and my father\nwent before me to Germany and then we came to our organization, through a Zionist\norganization we came to Germany. He was like in the army, the Zionist organization\nfrom the army we came to Germany.",
        "Q: Were you living freely all this time or did you ever live in a camp?",
        "A: In a camp, I was in an UNRRA camp in Germany.",
        "Q: For how long?",
        "A: How long? Until I came to Canada. We came to Germany in 1947. We came to Canada\nin '48 so it was about a year and a half I think. I had my baby in '47, my son is born in\n1947 in Germany.",
        "Q: Until that you were living freely, until you got to Germany?",
        "A: In the camp, yes.",
        "Q: But in Poland you were not in a camp?",
        "A: No, we were in a house living there. Also Jewish houses that the Jewish people used to\nlive. I remember the address.",
        "Q: After the war, your new husband was part of the Polish army?",
        "A: They took him I don't know how it happened but they took him to the Polish army. He\nwas in the Russian army and then they took him to the Polish army. I don't know how,\nbecause he was Russian at the time from the war. So, they took him in Russia to the army\nand then they took him to the Polish army.",
        "Q: Was it at all difficult getting over to Canada?",
        "A: It was difficult, yes. It was very difficult. We thought because with a baby we wouldn't be\nable to \u2014 they wouldn't let us come. My baby was very sick and we came to a place\nbefore, I forgot the name of the place in Germany before we came to Canada. We were\nliving all people together in one place. The people that were supposed to go to Canada,\nand my son got sick and his stomach was loose all the time, all the time. One time I\ndreamt my husband's father, which I never knew in my life, when I described to my\nhusband he told me that he looked like that, and I dreamed that he gave me a jar of fish\nand he told me, \u201cGive that to your child a little bit. Then you're going to talk about me, so\nlong live my child,\u201d because his name is after him, Jack, you know his name 1s Jack,\nJankel in Jewish.\nAll of a sudden on the day after a doctor an American doctor came in. I couldn't speak\nEnglish at all. So, I showed him that the diapers that he goes every minute, so he gave\nhim medication and that doctor helped him. I thought the child was going to die, because\nhe was screaming nights. Everybody was mad at me because the child was screaming,\nand I was so young at that time. So, he gave him a medication. After that dream, all of\nsudden the child got well and we came to Canada after that. We came to Canada in 1948,\nNovember the 16. I don't remember the liberation day, but I remember when I came to\nCanada.",
        "Q: Was the adjustment in Canada at all difficult for you?",
        "A: It was very difficult. It was difficult because we didn't have anything. We came and didn't\neven have a dollar in my pocket. I didn't know how it looked, a dollar. My father had\nfamily in the United States, in Troy, New York, so they sent us the first 50 dollars. I\ndidn't even know how American money looked like. I didn't know what to do with that 50\ndollars. Then my husband couldn't find a job, and when he found a job they paid him 35\ndollars, and 35 dollars \u2014 39 dollars a week and I had a room and I had to pay 35 dollars a\nmonth for the room. Then we got \u2014 my aunt came and they gave us 700 dollars so I paid\nkey money, 700 dollars to move into an apartment in Montreal just for a broken stove and\nnot a refrigerator, an icebox, and a little table and chairs, I paid 700 dollars key money.\nWe could have bought a house at that time. The money that she gave me, I was happy to\nmove into a house because we lived in a room, don't stay here and don't make electricity\nand you're burning too much that. Then she made me wash the walls \u2014 her walls, like I\ndidn't understand. I thought that was the way it had to be. No matter how tough I was\nwhen I had to be, I was very different then.\nI let myself be used by a woman. They couldn't understand. What do I have to do for\nthem. Let them do a little bit for me. We were very much used by these people.",
        "Q: So, when you got to Canada people took advantage of you?",
        "A: A lot of advantage. They took for a stove, for Jewish people, a broken stove with a little\ntable, 700 dollars from us and we didn't have nothing. We came with nothing. Absolutely\nwith nothing and we struggled. All our lives, it was very hard. He wasn't a business man,\nhe was a tailor and he worked very hard for his money and it was a hard life. We had a\nvery hard life.",
        "Q: It must have gotten easier?",
        "A: I think now it's easier a little bit, but we're getting older.",
        "Q: Perhaps you felt that after everything you had been through, at least you were safe?",
        "A: Yes, we live in a free country, and I don't think that born American people or born\nCanadian people they know what it means freedom. Freedom means all the money in the\nwhole world can't buy that. Nothing. That's the most important thing. Not money, not\nanything but health and freedom. The only thing I felt, I'm free and I can do whatever I\nwant to do, even if I don't have nothing but I have my freedom. I could go wherever what\nI want to go. I could do what I want to do and I appreciated it very much.",
        "Q: All those years that you were hiding, fighting, running, did you ever want to just give up?",
        "A: No, never.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: I felt I had to take revenge one day for everything that has happened, for all these people\nthat I saw my friends that I loved them so much. I went to school with them together, get\nkilled. I saw them shot, falling down on the floor, and it started in the ghetto. I saw them\nlying dead. I said no. I have to live and take revenge, and you know what, right now I\ndon't feel like I want revenge. I just want one thing. I don't want this thing to happen\nagain to our people, to any people. But I don't want revenge anymore. At that time, I just\nfelt that I have to take revenge and I have to live just for that.",
        "Q: When you were liberated did you still want revenge?",
        "A: Yes, yes. I wanted to revenge, I wanted to revenge from these Polish people that took\naway everything from us that they were worse than the Germans. I wanted revenge. I\nthink I lived for it, just to get revenge.",
        "Q: Did you ever get revenge?",
        "A: I don't think so. The only revenge I have that \u2014 I don't know. I don't think I had any. I felt\n\u2014 after I didn't feel that. The only thing I had revenge 1s when I saw our country that we\nhave a country. That we are people just like anybody else, and Israel was like in 1947,\n1946, when I saw that we have a country I said, \u201cNow I have everything that I ever\nfought for, that we're going to have a country. We're going to be able to be just like\nanybody else. Even to be respected in other countries, we need our country, and I love\nthat country.\u201d I think that was my revenge, that I knew we were fighting for something.\nEven I didn't fight for Israel I fought for something that I lived to see, and it's important\nto me. I think it should be important to all of us that country we have.\nIt's the dearest thing that I feel we have, especially now that we're getting peace, and it's\ngoing to be peace there, I hope so.",
        "Q: Was there some reason why you didn't immigrate to Israel instead of Canada?",
        "A: I don't know. We wanted to go to Israel, but it came out like that, like we stayed in a\nplace to get some milk for the baby and all of a sudden they arranged it for Canada. It just\nhappened, it just happened but I really wanted to go to Israel. I didn't think of Canada at\nall.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you want to add that you think we need to know that you need to\nremember that I haven't asked you about?",
        "A: I don't know. If you ask me I can remember. I don't even know what I want to add\nbecause it's very hard for me.",
        "Q: Let me just ask you, prior to the Germans entering Lakhva, did you all have any idea\nwhat was happening at all?",
        "A: No, no we didn't. The religious Jews in Lakhva, the rabbis, they said that in Lakhva one\nrabbi died and he said there's not going to be any blood shedding in Lakhva, never. It's\nnot going to be. We shouldn't fight with the Germans. We shouldn't fight and no matter\nwhat happens we have to stay put. But the Zionist people didn't think like that. They\ndidn't believe in that, what the rabbi said. And they didn't listen to the rabbis. If they\nwould have listened to the rabbis all these Lakhva people \u2014 a few people are alive. From\nthe old ghetto there were a few thousand people that maybe a hundred people are alive,\nmaybe. I'm not even sure of that, so it wouldn't even be these people alive, if they would\nhave listened to the rabbis.",
        "Q: Did the Zionists have more information?",
        "A: No, they didn't have information, they had guts. They said, \u201cIf somebody fights me, I'm\nnot going to put one cheek and let the other one. I'm not going to let it happen. We have\nto fight back.\u201d And they said it to the rabbis and the rabbis were screaming, \u201cNo, don't\nfight.\u201d So, they didn't listen. They just said that we have to fight.",
        "Q: Did anybody know what was going on in Europe at the time?",
        "A: Nobody, not the small people. Maybe the big people knew it, but not the small people,\nnot the ordinary people. Nobody knew, nobody. They only knew these people when they\nfought back, they knew that, \u201cIf somebody gives me, if somebody is going to shoot me,\nI'm not going to let myself. It's not going to happen, because I'm going to fight back, even\nif I don't have ammunition, I'm going to take eggs, I'm going knives. I'm going to take\neverything I have with everything I could even I'm going to die just the same, but I'm not\ngoing to let myself get killed just like that without a fight.\u201d",
        "Q: Why do you think so few communities fought back?",
        "A: I don't know because there was nobody organized it. They had to have somebody\norganize these things. If they would have had somebody who organized these things, I\nthink people were afraid and they didn't think. They just went like sheep.",
        "Q: Do you think any of this could have been avoided?",
        "A: It couldn't have been avoided, but they could have fought back. They could have\nprepared themselves if they would know it. I think people should have prepared\nthemselves. Like I was little, and I was happy when I saw that mensch\u2019 \u2019. I was there, saw\nit, when they were giving the German with an ax. I felt so good inside and when they\nasked the doctor to help them. They're going to kill my brothers and my sisters and\neverybody and you're telling me you're going to keep my family safe if I'm going to save\nyou? No, I'm not saving anybody. You could kill me too, so they shot the doctor too. It\nmeans that some people had guts. They didn't just want to give up. If they're going to\nthrow away their lives at least they're going to do it for something. They're going to go\nwith a reason, with a fight.",
        "Q: It's just hard to understand why some communities were much, much stronger this way\nthan others?",
        "A: I think because they had somebody like Rochczyn there. If they would have more like\nthese, like now in Israel. How has Israel survived? Because there were these people, they\nwere there. That's why. These were part of these people. They learned to be like that.\n\" person (Yiddish); a decent person, someone of noble character.\nThey learned not to give up without a fight and we never have to give up without a fight\nif we have to survive.",
        "Q: So strong leadership?",
        "A: That's right.",
        "Q: Anything else when you look back at this time in your life. What do you think about?",
        "A: When I look back, I wish I could have said to everybody in all these ghettos, \u201cDon't let\nyourself just go like sheep to the grave. Fight back. Don't let yourself, don't go to the\ngraves just like that. If you go to the grave let it be written \u2014 let 1t be said that you were\nfighting and you didn't give up, but you were fighting for something that you believed\nthat, you have to fight, not to go like a sheep but to go like a person, like a human being,\nto fight back.\u201d I believe it now, too.",
        "Q: Thank you.",
        "A: I never give up even now, no matter hard you know. We had hard times. Like now, I\nmarried my husband. He was very sick. He was twice in a hospital. He had surgery after I\nmarried him. He had a surgery by-pass and then five times since we live in a house now.\nOne year he was five times with infections. He went through a lot, so I never gave up. I\nnever said \u201che's going to die,\u201d and I was sitting and talking to him and I said, \u201cYou're not\ngoing to die. You'll see. You're going to pull through it because you have to. You have to.\nYou have to.\u201d I was saying to myself, \u201cNo he's not going to die. It's not going to happen\nto him because we're going to fight and we're going to survive.\u201d It's just like anything\nelse. I'm a fighter now too. I always believe when I go to sleep at night it's like a nice\nletter that's going to come. I live day by day like that like it's going to come a letter\ntomorrow, something good is going to happen. Like I'm waiting for the next day, every\nsingle day in my life I'm waiting for something good to happen. Even if it's not going to\nhappen, I still believe that it will happen. I never believe that it's going to be an ordinary\nday. I believe that it's going to be the most beautiful day tomorrow.",
        "Q: Is that the way you felt when you were in hiding?",
        "A: I always felt like that. I think I was born like that.",
        "Q: Just tell me briefly, how did you meet Joseph, your current husband?",
        "A: I knew him a long time because \u2014 I met my current husband a long time ago but I didn't\nknow him, but a few years ago, when he moved in with his wife \u2014 I used to live on the\nfourth floor and he moved into my apartment on the third floor. He moved 1n with his\nwife and his wife had Alzheimer. She was very sick. I saw them and I knew them and I\nsaid \u2014 I opened the door and I let him in \u2014 I said, \u201cThese are two old people I'm going to\nlet them in, let the door open. They're carrying parcels. They moved into that apartment.\u201d\nThen I heard from far his wife said, \u201cThat's Zina.\u201d I said, \u201cThat's Icek?\u201d And I call him\nIcek, because his name 1s Icek and not Joseph. I said, \u201cMy God, he looks so old and that\nman is not so old.\u201d He was about 63 years old at that time. I said, \u201cMy God, what has\nhappened to them?\u201d At that time, his sister in law came \u2014 and I used to go a few times to\nhis house to have coffee there with his wife too. His wife didn't know nothing because\nshe was very sick, Alzheimer. She was still a young woman because she died at 63 years\nold.\nSo, I came up to the house and I was \u2014 I saw \u2014 when his wife died, his sister-in-law came\nand she stayed by me upstairs, instead of staying in a hotel, I gave her my apartment\nbecause my husband was dead already. She says, \u201cYou know what, you two are so good\nfor each other, you're going to marry him.\u201d And I didn't even think about it because first\nof all, his wife just died. I'm going to think that I'm going to marry him? I said, \u201cYou're\ncrazy. Anja (ph), why are you talking like that?\u201d That was Erwin's wife, and I knew\nErwin since 1951, very well. I said, \u201cYou're crazy, don't talk like that.\u201d But every single\nday that his wife died, I started asking him to go for a walk because he was very\ndepressed and he was talking about his wife all the time and we were going and walking\na lot, and talking. Then, I fell in love with him after, and the same thing happened to him\nI think. So, I never believed that in that age I'm going to fall in love with somebody,\nbecause I think I love him more than my life because after that he was so sick a few times\nhe was in the hospital. Quite a few times, and I stood by him and I always gave him faith.\nWhen he was in the hospital with a by-pass and this is the second one, because 15 years\nago he had one bypass and this was the second one. He thought he was not going to live\nbecause the doctor told him that that by-pass is not going to be able to make a by-pass. I\ntold him, \u201cDon't believe the doctor what he says. I heard many doctors. They talk to the\npatient and they die before the patient dies, so don't listen. You'll see that you're going to\nbe alive and you're going to be able to have the operation.\u201d A few days later he came and\nhe says, \u201cYou know, what we're going to try to operate.\u201d He was so happy, just like he\nwas going to go to dance, and I said to him like that, \u201cBefore you go to the operation,\nhave faith, believe that you're going to live and after you're going to see we're going to\nbuy the most beautiful things for the house. You're going to sell all the old junks you\nhave and we're going to buy the nicest things. You're going to see you're going to have\nthe most beautiful life. Just believe it.\u201d He was six weeks in the intensive care and I was\nsitting every single day and talking like that. \u201cJust believe it, you'll see, you're going to\nhave a good life.\u201d Just like I thought in the time of the war. I didn't think I was going to\nlive but I still didn't want to believe it because I think I'm a survivor.",

I can't remember the dates, but I\nknow when it started the ghetto, 1t was in September because the ghetto started and my\nfather was \u2014 they made him in the committee, then we started listening and hearing. I\nwanted to run off from the ghetto. So we had people that were police in the ghetto \u2014\nJewish people, young guys. So I started running out of the ghetto to steal bread \u2014 because\nI was a tomboy \u2014 to bring some bread, not steal, bring some bread to the house. We\nshould have something to eat. I just didn't eat by myself and I brought bread when I ran\nout of the ghetto. I gave to lots of people. I say, \u201cIf I'm going to be hungry and if I'm\ngoing to die, if they're going to die, if I'm going to live, I want them to live too. Why\nshould I live and they should die?\u201d So, I gave to everybody a piece to that, and a piece to\nthat, and then one time I wanted to run out and a policeman \u2014 like a Jewish policeman, he\nwas for us good and he wasn't for the Germans \u2014 he said, \u201cYou know somebody is going\nto catch you and they're going to kill you.\u201d One time it happened that before the ghetto\nstart, a German man with a blind eye came and he said, \u201cDoes Jews live here?\u201d and I said\n\u201cno.\u201d And he went in and Jews were living there and he came out and he was beating me\nso much. He was beating me like he wanted to kill me. Then he was gone, so I run away\n* Stanislaw Zalewski\nand I came to a neighbor of ours under the bed I was laying and when he came he said,\n\u201cWhere is the maid? Ich will sie totschlagen.\u201c\" He would have killed me. Because for\nthem to say a lie is the worst thing that you could do. That's before the ghetto started. I\nwas so beaten I couldn't see. I couldn't walk for weeks. That much he beat me. And then I\nstarted with the ghetto.",
        "A: In Lakhva, the people were very nice. They were very good. Like when we came the\nRussians were still there. So, the neighbors, they brought butter milk and that brought\nbread. That became, we were like strangers there, and everybody brought something else.\nMe, my father and my sister when we came, and my brother and my sister and my father.\nThey were so friendly. It really was very, very nice. I had a friend. She's still in New\nYork next door, like the next house, and we became very close friends.",
        "A: Mostly Jewish, in Belorus also, but the Belorus people weren't as bad as \u2014 they became\nbad when the Germans came, but they weren't as bad. Like my mother's sister had\nbeautiful things. She was young. I gave it away it somebody and when I came back after\nthe war she wouldn't give me nothing back. They were takers. They didn't like Jews.\nNobody did.",
        "A: Yes. I went to the Russian school.",
        "A: I can't remember. The ghetto was formed in 1942 probably.",
        "A: It was a few months, not too long, a few months, and then they started the ghetto.\n*<T want to kill her\u201d (German)",
        "A: I think it was 1942. I can't remember that, like my memory got completely \u2014 especially\nthat time, I have no memory of that. I can't remember the dates at all.",
        "A: In the ghetto before the Germans came, several months, yes.",
        "A: Yes. The Germans came. I was in Lakhva maybe more than a year, maybe a year and half\nor two before \u2014 I think maybe a year and half. I can't remember how long when the\nGermans came. I don't even remember which year they came. I can't remember, but my\nmemory slipped completely about that.",
        "A: Not long after, a few months.",
        "A: A few families were in one house, they lived in one house, like three or four families. We\nhad like \u2014 we made, it wasn't beds, it was like they made they put like wood on the top\nand on the bottom something like that to sleep and there were a few families living\ntogether in the ghetto, and then we started hearing that they are going to kill the Jews.\nWhen they're going to kill the Jews then somebody came and they said to my father that,\n\u201cT think it's going to happen in the next few days.\u201d So, when they started talking about\nburning everything, like all the things we have, we should burn. Nobody should have it.\nNot the Belorus, not the Germans, should get nothing that we have. We started putting\ngasoline when we knew that the next day we're going to get killed. So we saw everybody\nwhat they were standing. I went out, I remember, very early in the morning and I saw the\nGermans pulling up with guns, with all kinds of things, they were holding like this, you\nknow, everything, and they were pointing at the ghetto. My father was running out of the\nhouse and I didn't know what he said. \u201cYou wait here. Don't go anyplace. We have to be\ntogether now.\u201d And they started burning. It wasn't just my father, it was lots of people. I\nreally can't remember their names, but Lopatyn\u201d was one of these. His name should be\nforgotten really. I remember even how he looked, and then there was other people too.\nThey burned everything. They started burning and there was smoke, and I saw there was\na bridge not far from us and I saw friends of mine sitting with the feet holding like this,\nand they were taking them to a cemetery to shoot them.\n> Dov Lopatyn (1900-1944), head of Lakhva Judenrat and former Zionist leader.\nAnd my father said like that \u201clet's run.\u201d Before we were running, I was near water. The\nwater was death, they called the water death like \u201csmierc\u201d in Polish. And I saw the\nGermans. They were fighting with the Jews with knives and with ax and there as one man\na Rev-Zionist , the same party as Begin, and he was holding an ax on a German over the\nhead in the water, and the German killed him right away and they went to a doctor. And I\nsaw this, and I was standing with my father and my brother and my sister with their\nhands like this. My father said, \u201cDon't go away. We have to be with each other. Maybe\nwe'll run away.\u201d So, it was burning and here I saw something that I took so much\nrevenge, I said to myself, \u201cI'm going to die anyway in a few minutes. It's going to now.\u201d\nYou didn't think you're going to survive, you're going to live. Who's going to live?\nNobody thought they were going to live, but at least before I die I'm going to have\nrevenge, and I saw that Rochczyn\u2019 \u2014 a man, he was belonging to the party like Begin and\nhe gave with the ax over the head. So, a man, a doctor was there. He was from Warsaw\nhimself, he came like we came, in the wartime, running away from the Germans. So, they\ntold him like that, \u201cWe're going to save all your family if you're going to save that\nGerman.\u201d He says, \u201cYou could kill me too because I don't give a damn anymore because\nI'm not going save him \u2014 he could die.\u201d But Rochczyn right away they shot him. He got\nkilled in the water, but they were fighting with knives, with anything they had, they said,\n\u201cWe're not going to let ourselves just take to the death just like that.\u201d They took only the\nweak.",
        "A: What I did? I was running with my father. We were running away because we saw\npeople running, we run too. It was open, the ghetto, they opened the doors there. We\nstarted running, and there was gardens there, beautiful gardens that people made when I\ntook up, I was my mouth was so wet like I thought I was going to die right away, so I got\na pickle there, I bent down and I got a pickle, and all the four of us together, and I took\nthat pickle in my mouth and I was holding for ten kilometers were running. It was a place\n\u2014 Prypec, they called. Then I found my friend there with a bullet in it and the blood was\ngoing. Fanny Eisen.",
        "A: Yes, she's in New York now. I took off my shirt and I bandaged her. We didn't know\nwhat we were doing. We run again and we left her there, because there was lots of people\nthere, lots of \u2014 we saw so many people there running away from the ghetto.\n\u00b0 Union of Zionists Revisionists; militant political Zionists movement founded and led by\nVladimir Jabotinsky.\n\" Itzak Rochezyn (1915-1942),Jewish resistance fighter.",
        "A: She was running away by herself, but you know we didn't even know what we were\ndoing because we were like crazy people. My father, we were running right, one after the\nother. My father said \u201ccome\u201d and my sister got winded when we were running, and I\nthought she was running after us because there were woods and trees, and I thought she\nwas running after me, and I looked in the back and I didn't see my sister anymore. I saw\nmy brother and my father. I said \u201cWhere is my sister?\u201d So, she was there, so I said to the\npeople that were running with us \u2014, a whole bunch of people, many people \u2014 I said, \u201cIf\nyou're not going to go after my sister, I'm going to scream so loud that all the Germans\nare going to come and kill us too, because I don't want to leave her, I'm not going to see\nmy sister.\u201d Everybody was running back because they were afraid that I'm going to\nscream, and I was a very tomboy. I used to bring food to the ghetto and I used to do such\nthings that a child that age would never do, now especially. The kids, we had to be grown\nup before we grew up so we run back and we didn't find my sister anymore and I was\ncrying for months. We run away, lying in the woods at night.\nIt was the time of the Jewish holidays and it was cold at night and I didn't have nothing, a\nlittle dress, and I threw away my shoes so I had bare feet. Everybody had nothing to wear\nand it was cold and we couldn't make a fire at night because the Germans would come\nand see us. So, quite a few people were running away from there. We run, we run, we\ndidn't know where we were running. We went into a White-Russian house to take a piece\nof bread because we didn't have nothing to eat. I still had my pickle.",
        "A: In the woods. All these years, till the war is finished, we were living in the woods.",
        "A: Just a few months, not long.",
        "A: There was nothing, there was nothing. It was just a piece of bread we got like a small\npiece of bread a day. No, people were hungry. That's why I ran out of the ghetto to bring\nsomething but they didn't let me after.",
        "A: Well, I was little, so I just went out. I took out, we had to wear a star in the front and the\nback and I took off the star and I went out. I thought, \u201cIf I'm going to do that they're\ngoing to kill me.\u201d And I knew they would.",
        "A: Nothing, no school nothing. No.",
        "A: Yes, I had typhus. I got typhus and I told my father, \u201cPapa you go because I'm not going\nto live anyway. So, at least you and my brother is going to be alive.\u201d But he wouldn't\nleave me. But after, we got separated.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They were just having meetings and I think the meetings were discreet that they were\nafraid to talk about it, what they talked. That's why they burned. When he said, when they\nwent to burn the ghettos, they said, \u201cWait, don't go nowhere.\u201d",
        "A: I think because he was very smart, because he had a mouth to talk. I think he could have\neven been a president, but not in Poland he didn't have a chance to be anything.",
        "A: Men.",
        "A: I can't remember now. It was lots. I think five, six, seven people.",
        "A: I don't think anybody \u2014 any \u2014 too many responsibilities. They only had the responsibility\n\u2014 like everybody used to get a piece of bread. They brought in bread to the ghetto like a\npiece, a few ounces of bread they should give everybody you know like they used to\ncome to bring the bread, to take the bread in the committee, like they had to give\nsomething like a few ounces of bread a day. That's all.",
        "A: Something like that, yes.",
        "A: Yes, there was a Jewish police group, yes. They keep the ghetto, they keep the people\nthat they shouldn't run out. They shouldn't do anything that they should get killed. They\nprotected the people.",
        "A: Worked together.",
        "A: They answered to the Germans that they kept that their people shouldn't get killed. That\ntime I think they didn't know that they're going to take all the Jews and kill them. They\nthought it was going to be a ghetto and soon the war is going to stop. It's not going to be\nforever. Nobody knew it was going to be so many years.",
        "A: They followed the orders. If they followed the orders they wouldn't burn the ghetto. They\nwould have gone like sheep and died but I don't think anybody of these people \u2014 these\npeople were different kind of people. They heard lots of things and they say, \u201cNo,\nnobody is going to kill us like a sheep, we're not sheep, we're people we are human\nbeings and we're not going to go just like that. Nobody is going to kill us, nobody is\ngoing to kill us without a fight. We're going to die anyway but at least we're going to\nhave a fight. We're going to do something about it.\u201d",
        "A: No, I was too young to be aware of these things.",
        "A: No, nothing. Only they took ax and knives. They didn't have anything. They didn't have\nno ammunition at all. If they would have ammunition it would be different. I think half of\nthe Germans would be killed.",
        "A: They decided to burn the ghetto for one reason. That they shouldn't see like it was such a\nsmoke that you wouldn't see where a German is \u2014 where a Jew is. The Germans they\ndidn't see the people, that's why we were able to run. That's the only reason we were able\nto tear up, it was like the ghetto was closed with wires, and we were able to open these\nwires. The first person that opened these wires, died, but then the people started running\nbecause it was opened. It was like a wire like you could hurt yourself. It wasn't like\nelectric, but you could hurt yourself.",
        "A: I don't know how long they talked, but I know the last few days when they said they're\ngoing to kill the Jews that they were talking about it.",
        "A: No, I don't think it was planned for a while. They didn't know, when they knew they were\ngoing to kill the Jews, they knew a day before, but the Germans thought the Jews were\ngoing to go. They couldn't know when they're going to get killed because they're going to\nkill them anyway like everybody is going to go like a sheep. Every place they went like\nsheep, so they're going to go here like sheep, too. But the only thing they didn't think was\nhere that these people are different kind of people. These people will not go like sheep.\nThey won't let themselves get killed like that. They'll fight and they'll do everything they\ncould to make them impossible to do something, to just take the people to the graves.",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 I think that there were many like a Rev-Zionist. They came from the party that\nwas Begin's not like any other party. These people are very tough. These people wouldn't\nlet themselves, like that Rochczyn. You know I still see him. He had glasses on. I see him\nhow he looks. I'll never forget his face, that beautiful face that \u2014 he took an ax. He was\ntaking an ax and giving the German over the head you can't imagine in that moment how\nas a child I felt that you don't just let yourself get killed, but you kill back. You do\nsomething about it. I felt that in a few minutes I'm going to fall down anyway.\nThey're going to shoot me, because they were shooting, but I didn't care if I'm going to\ndie, because that time you don't care. You haven't got anything to think about that you're\ngoing to survive. Nobody does. You think well I'm going to die. At least I'm going to die\nknowing that a German got killed even if it's one or two or three that somebody \u2014 that\nthey just didn't go like sheeps.",
        "A: That was something that I felt so good inside even though I knew I'm not going to live. I\ndidn't think that now I'm going to sit now and talk to somebody about it. That I'll be able\nto tell my story, never.",
        "A: It was a few people, and I think it has a lot to do with these Zionist people, a lot. These\npeople were tough.",
        "A: Oh yes, definitely, for sure.",
        "A: I think we knew. My father said, \u201cWait a minute, I need gasoline.\u201d You know like\nnaphtha \u2014 we didn't have electricity there like we had very little electricity, so they put\nthe lamps with \u2014 just a little bit we had, but it was enough. The old ghetto was burned.\nThere was nothing left of it. Nothing in one house, nothing, because I was there after the\nwar. I came after the war there and there was nothing left at all. But you know, even after\nthe war when we came I was proud to come there. I lived there over a year. They took\naway my father to the army. I met my father back when they took him away to the\nRussian army. I lived there for a year for sure and I gave him my brother to the\norphanage because I didn't have any money and I went to the orphanage after the war. I\ntook my brother and I went on the train and they told me \u201cdo you have a ticket?\u201d I didn't\nhave a piece a bread even to eat and I was very young. I said, \u201cWhat kind of ticket. I went\nthrough a war, and I was sitting in the woods for so many years, do you think I have\nmoney to buy a ticket? You can kill me if you want, but I'm not going to give you\nnothing. I'm going to take my brother and go and if you want to take me off of that train,\nyou'll have to kill me first.\u201d So, they let me through. I took my brother to Pinsk after the\nwar in an orphanage. I only wanted that they dress him up and I should be able to see him\nagain from that orphanages, from the Russians and I'll bring him back home because he\ndidn't have nothing to wear. He didn't have nothing to eat, so I brought him there.",
        "A: I had to be.",
        "A: There were Russian people there. There were lots of partisans around us. I was living\nthere. I couldn't find my father, but I found him after.",
        "A: No, after the war I found out that they killed her. They found her and they killed her, the\nGermans.",
        "A: Everyone helped one another, especially the Jewish people.",
        "A: The farmers, if they would see us, they would give us to the Germans. We couldn't let\nnobody see us.",
        "A: The place where we used to live, there were lots of partisans there, so you know the\npartisans did something. They took everybody from the house to the partisans, like every\nman that was let's say somebody had a son, somebody had a husband, so they couldn't go\nand squeal because they would squeal on their own. So, we were able to live around there\nto be hidden.",
        "A: When we lived in the woods, they went into these little towns, like in the country houses,\nand they took \u2014 the partisans took from each family a member, two members \u2014 like if\nsomebody had two sons \u2014 to the partisans.",
        "A: Not hostages, they should fight for the Russians.",
        "A: Yes, they were willing to do that. Let's say the mother is not going to squeal, not going to\ngo to the Germans and say \u201cmy son is a partisan.\u201d So, we were around these people,\nhidden around these people.",
        "A: Oh, yes. They took a lot of communities in.",
        "A: Yes. They used to hide us. They used to keep us. They were afraid like I was by a\nUkrainian woman and she used to think of me like her child.",
        "A: No, not all, but these places where we were, these people wouldn't do it because of these\nmen that they took away, they mobilized these people. They say, \u201cyou're going to come,\nyou're going to fight for us.\u201d The partisans were around all over. So, they couldn't do it,\nthey wouldn't do it.",
        "A: Around us? We saw many, but they saved a lot of Jews too.",
        "A: Yes. They weren't bad people.",
        "A: Yes, in the woods. I think they saved so many Jewish people, so many people, like so\nmany children. They did a lot of things for the Jews. They didn't care if you were a Jew\nor not. They didn't know the difference. They didn't know the difference even, what's a\nJew and what's not a Jew. Like one child asked the father, \u201cAm I a Jew too?\u201d He was\nJewish like he didn't know.",
        "A: There were lots of kids, lots.",
        "A: We took care of ourselves.",
        "A: I met a Ukrainian women. She took care of me. Then when time passed by, like maybe\ntwo years I didn't see my father and my brother and we found him after.",
        "A: We got separated, yes.",
        "A: Maybe seven months something like that.",
        "A: I met my friend after. Somebody told me my friend is living not far from me and I went\nover. I walked with somebody, a man that he was a journalist before the war but he was\nin the partisans and I asked him, \u201cplease, could you take me?\u201d He was a Jewish man. I\nsaid, \u201cCould you take me to see, I think I heard that my friend is living in that place, so\nand so\u201d \u2014 I don't remember the name of the place, but it wasn't far. We had to walk\nmaybe an hour, hour and half. He said, \u201csure, come with me.\u201d I went there and the father\nwas sitting there and he said \u201cI'm going to take Feigele (ph). I found out she's alive and\nI'm going to bring her \u2014 she's with people. She's by people.\u201d So, I said, \u201ccould I come\nwith you?\u2019 He says \u201csure.\u201d When I came over there she was full of lice, you know, and\nyou know what we did, we took ashes. We didn't have any soap, and we take the ashes\nand we put in a piece of cloth by Christian people, like Russian people and we put some\ncloth and we had warm water, you didn't have water. You had to bring water from\noutside. We didn't have water in the house. We made her we put her in something to\nmake her a box and took her out from these and then we went back with her and I took\nher out and I had lice all over my hands. We washed her once and another time with\nwater and then the woman gave us something to dry her. These people didn't have\nanything to dry her and she got dressed up with something that she had. She didn't have\nnothing to wear. Then her father took her back and we were sleeping at night and she\ndreamed her grandmother said that Germans were running after us and they were going\nto kill us, and I had a dream too and I woke up and I was screaming. I says, \u201cYou know\nthey're going to kill us again.\u201d The whole nights, all these years I have dreams. I always\nwake up with dreams that they they're going to kill my family. I have three children now,\nthat they're going to kill my children and I'm going to be alone again. I'm going to have\nnobody. So, that time, we both fell asleep and we dreamed that we're running and we're\nrunning and they're going to kill us. Somebody's going to kill us. They're running after\nus. She said, \u201cI have such a dream that they're going to kill us again,\u201d and I said, \u201cyes, I\nhave the same dream.\u201d We woke up in a sweat. I stayed with her for a few days and I\nwent back where I was, where that Ukrainian woman, she took care of me very much.",
        "A: I think so. A woman wasn't \u2014 I think by the Russians a woman was more than it was by\nthe Poles or someplace else. But I think that it was a difference, like they thought a\nwoman can do nothing, men could do more. Even no matter how aggressive you were\nand how much you were able to do so a woman is not much, she can do as much as a\nman.",
        "A: I didn't think at that time how I was treated. I just felt \u201cI'm going to survive and I'm going\nto look where my father is.\u201d I didn't think about anything. I didn't think how they're going\nto treat me how they treat me. I knew I had to survive and I'm going to do everything\npossible to do it.",
        "A: We had the responsibility to help in the garden. Like I was with the Ukrainian woman,\nwe went \u2014 I wanted to milk the cows, I learned how to milk. I went to the fields with the\npotatoes. It wasn't like now they have tractors. I worked. I helped them. I loved to do it. I\nloved it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Everybody.",
        "A: Together, yes.",
        "A: I think the men only, not the women. They told the women what to do. I don't think the\nwomen made any decisions all together.",
        "A: Yes. Even the Russians, they thought \u201cA Jew can't even fight. He doesn't even know how\nto fight. How a Jew could fight.\u201d But, the Jews \u2014 they gave them guns and they were\nfighting.",
        "A: No, they took the Jews to fight also, but they didn't \u2014 I don't think they thought a Jew\ncould fight as much as a non-Jew. I don't believe that they thought that.",
        "A: Yes, the Soviets, but I don't think they made a difference between a Jew and a non-Jew.\nThe only thing they thought was that the people by themselves, not in the more like\nsomebody was a lieutenant, or they run away from the army or something, they run away\nfrom the Germans, I don't think they thought about the Jew being different. I don't\nbelieve feeling even then by Ukrainian women that I was a Jew. She didn't think of me as\na Jew. She thought of me as a little girl that's run away from a ghetto and she wants to\nsurvive and she wants to help me.",
        "A: No, I think the men made the decision mostly, the Soviet men.",
        "A: I think there were a lot of Jewish men that they made decisions too. They were\nlieutenants or like big shots. They made decisions too.",
        "A: No, not a religious but non not religious either. We ate kosher in the house \u2014 like even\nnow, I'm not going to eat pork. I can't even if I want to.",
        "A: We had to eat whatever they had, but I never ate pork. If I knew in the woods that's Yom\nKippur \u2014 one time a friend, he is now in Montreal but he went to Toronto to live \u2014 he\npassed by. When he told, \u201ctoday is Yom Kippur,\u201d he passed by like he didn't have\nnothing to wear and I saw him and I didn't even believe he's alive. And he passed by and\nhe said to me, \u201ctoday is Yom Kippur.\u201d I didn't eat. I didn't want to eat anything even\nthough we didn't have much to eat, we were hungry most of the time. We were in the\nwater and that Ukrainian woman said to me that the Germans were on the top.\nThey were shooting. They surrounded us, the Germans, and we were lying in the water\nvery deep like in the time that was in the woods already, and we're lying. She said to me,\n\u201cMake with your feet like this because otherwise the feet will fall off. They came off,\u201d\nshe said, \u201cmake with your feet, just work with them, just like exercise with them, do\nsomething, because otherwise you're going to lose your feet.\u201d Up there they were\nshooting us with airplanes and around they were shouting, the Germans were running. In\nthe middle of that the partisans came and they started fighting with the Germans. You\nknow they were going like, how could I say it in English \u2014 even if I\u2019m so many years,\nsince I was 18 years old in Canada \u2014 na shtyki\u2019, they were going with big knives like this\none on one. They didn't care. They said, \u201cwe're going to get killed, we're going to get\nkilled,\u201d and we were lying in the water and all of sudden from nowhere they came and\nthey saved probably our lives at that time.",
        "A: No. I didn't even know which day it was. We didn't have calendars, we didn't have\nnothing.",
        "A: It wasn't not important, I wasn't aware of anything. You don't think about anything. You\nonly think that you have to survive and if you had a piece of bread or if you have\nsomething \u2014 you know what I was praying. I was sitting down and I was praying, \u201cIf I'm\n* with bayonets (Russian)\ngoing to be able to live, and if I'm going to survive, am I going to have bread on the table\nas much as I want to eat. I should be able to eat enough. Is that going to happen? I want\nto be warm. I don't want to be cold anymore. I should be able to just be in a warm, lie\ndown in a warm oven.\u201d Because they had ovens that they were baking and cooking there\nyou know, \u201cand I should like down there just to feel the warmth and just have bread. Am\nI ever going to have that? Is it ever going to happen to me?\u201d",
        "A: No.\nTape #2",
        "A: A few years, yes. About two years I think I ran away in '42, from '42 to '45. It was quite a\nfew years, yes.",
        "A: I think every day we were scared. Every day we were running someplace out. Everyday\nwe were struggling to have something to eat because it was very bad with food. I was like\na toothpick, you know. It was such hard times that it's very hard to describe times like\nthat. We were from one place to another. Even that one I was running, if not that I knew\nthat the partisans were around I wouldn't have survived, never. Sometimes they used to\ngive us to eat, they used to give us to eat \u2014 but most of the time we sometimes we used to\nsteal a piece of bread because we didn't have any, that woman even. Many times we went\nto her house when we knew the partisans were around, in the winter, in the house. We\nwent to her garden. She was to me like a mother, couldn't be better.",
        "A: Sometimes their gardens.",
        "A: Sometimes we used to make a fire, a small fire in the daytime. At night we were afraid.\nWe used to take and bake them inside, with the ashes and bake them and eat them.\nSometimes we used to eat raw, especially at night we were afraid to make a fire so we\nwere freezing.",
        "A: Everybody's. We used to pass by. Sometimes we used to steal a chicken, burn the\nfeathers and make it. I can't even describe how the used to make it. That woman used to\nmake it.",
        "A: All the time. Moved from one place. Not even three days in one place, sometimes we\nused to stay a few days in one place, make ourselves go and bring something. We would\nbring some bread from the partisans and bring some potatoes and bring something we ate,\nand we stayed a few days and then we heard the Germans are coming and we run again.\nWe run from one place to another. We never were in one place. We didn't stay too long in\none place. We couldn't.",
        "A: No, we didn't stay with a group of partisans. We stayed with lots of people. We went\nfrom one group to another one.",
        "A: They treated me nice. They treated us good.",
        "A: The only time I thought, \u201cIf I'm going to get killed there, it's not going to be as a Jew, it's\ngoing to be as a human being, as a person.\u201d I was with these people, and I met the\npartisans in the woods.",
        "A: Yes, even if you get killed, at least you're not going to get killed because you're a Jew.\nFor what? Because you're Jewish. Because you happen to be born a Jew. The only time\nthat I can think of that.",
        "A: It made a lot more sense.",
        "A: Yes, all the time.",
        "A: There were lots of Jewish kids that ran away without their parents. They didn't have their\nparents. They didn't have their mothers, they didn't have the fathers. There were lots.\nThere were about 20 people. Sometimes more, sometimes we met other people on the\nway. Everybody was in different groups, we met different kinds of groups of people in\nthe woods living there like gypsies. The gypsies were living there. They taught me how\nto draw cards, how to \u2014 even though I never believed in it, because the gypsies were\nrunning from the Germans too. They were living in the woods. And they were very nice,\nvery, very nice people, but they were liars. You could never believe anything, but they\nwere living in the woods.\nLots of times we were with gypsies. Sometimes for weeks. We used to make a tent, like a\ntent from wood and we used to sleep there. Like if you make from wood something you\nknow like even if an airplane passes by they don't see it because it's only wood. So, we\nmade like that. These people that were together that we met, every time we met\nsomebody else we were never together with the same people. We always go that you're\ngoing to be here, I'm going to go someplace else because you are afraid you're going to\nstay in one place they're going to get to know that somebody is going to tell on you. But\nwhen I met my father it was different. At that time was like even before the liberation. I\nthought I was liberated already\u2014",
        "A: Yes, children mostly that run away from the home. Lots of kids after the war \u2014 I have one\nfriend in Israel that she survived. She was there and another one was in New York, but\nshe's in Israel too. She and her brother and her father were there too.",
        "A: About my own age, yes. Sometimes without adults, they were by themselves. They went\nto the partisans to get some bread, to get something to eat. They used to give us to eat.\nThey used to go to the partisans and they used to ask, because they weren't far away and\nwe knew it, otherwise we wouldn't be able to survive. So, the only place we were able to\nget to eat, because if you went into a house, to have something to eat and you still some\npeople used to tell they are going to tell on us. Even these people that they weren\u2019t \u2014 they\ndidn't take these in the, in the partisans. You know, like depends on the district you were.\nMany district it took these people to the partisans. You know, like their sons and their \u2014\nyeah?",
        "A: Yes, but we weren't together at the same time, all the time. We went away and then we\nmet again. We were going because we were afraid. I was especially afraid to stay in one\nplace. I was mostly with that woman, that Ukrainian woman. Wherever she went I was\ngoing with her. She was afraid. Her sons were in the partisans and if they would catch her\nthey would kill her.",
        "A: No. I was too young for these things.",
        "A: Of course, all the time.",
        "A: Like we passed by and we saw a church burning. The people, they put wood, they put\nnails with wood around and we passed by and we heard from fire \u2014 people are screaming\nfrom a big fire, and we couldn't even go near there. The Germans, they put nails in wood\nand they closed it up around and they burned these people, a full church of people. It\nwasn't a church, it was like a house because they didn't believe in churches. They didn't\nbelieve in God, the Russians. It used to be a church but then it was something else.\nI don't know what. They passed by near there, not far. We were in the woods and there\nwas a like one place in the middle of nowhere and they were burning. We heard them\nscreaming.",
        "A: Keep safe from the fighting, I don't know. So many memories I have but I don't know\nwhere to start. We were always running from something. We were always running from\nfighting.",
        "A: I was running in the woods, that was before liberation, maybe a few months. They were\nrunning, all of a sudden we come to a place, I see my father and my brother. My father\nwas there working and you know he was repairing shoes for the partisans and that way he\nwas survived and they were sending him to fight. He was fighting, with guns, they were\ngoing to little towns where the Germans were and they were fighting. That's why they\nwere able to keep my brother in the partisans with my father. They were there. When I\nmet him, everything changed. After that, liberation was maybe a few months after, was\nthe liberation and I met my father. He survived with the partisans, really.",
        "A: You can't imagine. I thought they died already, because when we run away from the\nhouse and I got typhus and I told my father, \u201cPapa leave me because I'm not going to\nlive, you see I'm so sick.\u201d So, my father says, \u201cif I'm going to leave you what is my life\ngoing to be all about? I'm not going to be able to live.\u201d All of sudden we were separated.\nI don't even know how. I can't even explain to you how because when you run,\neverybody runs. You run and all of a sudden there's trees and woods and you don't see\neach other. You don't see where you go. You get separated. I was going with people. I\nwas running. When you're running you don't look where you're going. I thought my\nfather was after me, just like I thought my sister is behind me when I couldn't find her\nanymore. My sister, she died. They killed her after. And she said she would have been\nmy sister was running with me, she said \"Zina, look the blood on my face.\u201d That was\nonly an ear that was wounded and then I run back and I never found her and I thought\nthis happened to my father, the same thing.",
        "A: It was a miracle. It was such an emotion, I thought to myself, \u201cMy God, I'm not alone in\nthis world. I have my father. I have my brother.\u201d You know I didn't see him after the war.\nI got married I was about 15-1/2 years old and I went to Canada and my father went to\nIsrael. I saw him after 22 years, I didn't see my father and I came to see my father. I think\nhe died from a broken heart. A year later I saw him for the first time. I wasn't able to\nafford, because my husband didn't make a lot of money. I married a man who was 16\nyears older than me. I didn't have such a great life, a very, very hard life. I went to Israel\nafter 22 years being in Canada, I went to Israel to see my father and a year later he dies\nfrom a stroke because I think he lost a wife and three children and he loved my mother\nvery much. He died from a broken heart. That's the only thing I could say, so you could\nimagine that after the war, after I met my father how it was such an emotion to me. I\nthought to myself, \u201cI'm alone in the whole world and here I have somebody. I have a\nbrother, I have my father.\u201d That was unbelievable. I can't even say what happened to me\nat that time. I felt I'm just like somebody else, too. A lot of kids run away. They had their\nfather, they had a sister or a brother. Some were alone. They didn't have nobody.",
        "A: I don't know. After I met my father, I left her in a very nice way. We were going away in\nanother side my father was. I stayed with my father already. We said goodbye to each\nother crying and I never saw her again. I don't know what's happened to her, but I'm sure\nshe survived. I know she had two sons in the Partisans and one died. One got killed. I\nremember their names and I remember how they looked even. She was really special. I\ndon't know if not for her I would be able to survive. I wouldn't be able to live.",
        "A: After I was with them, I didn't leave them for a moment. I was afraid that if I'm going to\nleave them that they're going to disappear and something is going to happen to them. So,\neven when we're sleeping \u2014 we're sleeping one here and on the floor, in the woods, I was\nafraid I'm going to lose them. I'm not going to be able to find them anymore, so I was\nafraid to leave for a second. Wherever they were I think I was near. I was afraid to leave\nthem. You know, I was very scared. I was a very scared child. You know that even after\nthe war, and the war finished, we were in a camp with my husband, because I married\nyoung in Germany in Hess-Lichtenau\u2019, and I went one time out and I saw a movie. It was\nmy life exactly what I went through in the ghetto, in the woods, with everything. I\nfainted. I fell down on the floor and I fainted and you know for two years I was dizzy. I\ncame to Canada and I was afraid to leave a door closed, because my door was closed I'd\nleave it open. I thought I was going to faint. I was afraid to be alone in the house. My\ndoor was open like anybody could have gone in, if it would be the violence like now, and\nkill me. I was afraid. I came to Canada with a little baby. I was about 18 years old and I\ncame to Canada.",
        "A: Yes, a little while. The liberation was maybe two weeks after, that's all, so we still had\nvery bad time that time, like we were in the water again, for the second time we were\nleaving in the water. Under the water, the Germans were around on the airplanes on the\ntop and they were shooting, and we were lying down in the water again, you know like I\nwould have froze up my feet, my arms. Also, my father was talking like that woman. He\nsaid, \u201cDo something, do something with your feet. Do something with your arms because\nthey're going to fall off.\u2019 About three days later, the liberation was after that, but that\ntime I thought for sure now we're going to die because the airplanes were like this, over\nour heads and the Germans were all around. That time my father was involved with the\npartisans.",
        "A: In the water, it wasn't a river. It wasn't a river, it was like \u2014it wasn't quick sand, but it\nlooked like quick sand.",
        "A: Like a swamp, yes. It is very hard to describe that even. It's impossible, because nobody\ncould understand it.\n\u201d Hessisch-Lichtenau",
        "A: Dirty, filthy, no food, nothing to eat for days. For days we didn't have a piece of bread.\nThat was after I met my father already, but at least I knew we were together and if we're\ngoing to die, it's going to be all of us. At least we're going to be in one place.",
        "A: Yes, I could describe liberation because I couldn't believe it. They started screaming that,\n\u201cyou're liberated, you're liberated, we are liberated,\u201d you know, \u201cthe Russians are here,\nwe are liberated,\u201d you know. I was screaming, I was yelling, I was jumping, you know,\nand I was holding my father and my brother like this, like all around and I said \u201cMy God,\nwe are liberated. Can you believe that?\u201d My father at that time was maybe 40 years old,\n42 or something like that.",
        "A: Yes, the Russians, they came with their music playing. The Russians always \u2014 even when\nwe were in the woods we would hear the Russians. They would always say, \u201csing and\ndance because you never know tomorrow what's going to be.\u201d They are not afraid of\nanything.\nThey're not afraid of nothing, and I told a woman that I wanted to run. She said, \u201cWhat\nare you afraid of something? So, if you're going to die, you die one time. You don't die\ntwice.\u201d I said, \u201cYou know I'm afraid to be in one place all the time.\u201d",
        "A: I'm used to running, that's right, run. I think I was tough \u2014 I don't think I'd be able to go\nthrough the same thing now. In the mind and I'm thinking now I wouldn't be able to\nsurvive, I don't think so.",
        "A: I was terrible.",
        "A: Yes, very well, but after they took away my father into the army right away and left me\nand my brother alone. Like I told you before, they took him to the orphanage, without\nanything. Without any bread without anything. I didn't have nothing to eat after the war,\nnothing.",
        "A: After liberation, maybe a few weeks. With my brother I was with him all the time, but I\ngave him to the orphanage because I wanted him to go to school. I wanted him to have\nsomething. And I went myself too to school after the war.",
        "A: Lakhva. I came to Lakhva.",
        "A: I came to the Russian side.",
        "A: I was liberated near Mazyr. It's a town near Russia there because we were running. We\nrun away so far that we didn't know where we were running. So, we\u2019re liberated around\nthere. Right away we came to that place. It's a big city and they took away my father to\nthe army, and they took my brother and I went to Lakhva to the place \u2014 because I knew\nlots of Jews are there. When I came, I met lots of my friends, lots of people that I was in\nthe woods together who were living in the same house. You see the house the Germans\ntook away and then the Russian people moved in. So, they were Jewish houses, so we\nmoved into the houses. They all lived there. Then I stared \u2014 when I was living there I\nthought to myself, \u201c\u201cWhat am I going to do with my brother? He hasn't got a pair of shoes.\nHe's got bare feet, with nothing on his feet. What am I going to do with him? How ts he\ngoing to go to school?\u201d At that time four years younger than me. I was about 14 years\nold, so he was about ten, so \u201cwhat am I going to do with him?\u201d I have to dress him up at\nleast so I said to my brother, \u201cyou know what\u201d \u2014 in Pinsk there was a big city, there is an\norphanage there and somebody gave me the address. I said, \u201cyou know we'll go together.\nWe'll go on the train.\u201d He said to me, \u201cHow are you going to go on the train?\u201d I said\n\u201cYou don't worry how I'm going to go. I'm going to go, don't worry.\u201d So I told you when\nI went on the train, \u201cyou could kill me because I don't have a ticket.\u201d So I went and got\nhim into the orphanage. Then my father wrote me that he's coming back from the army.\nThen, you know what I did? I went and I stealed him from the orphanage. I told him I'm\ngoing for a walk with him. When I took him out and we went back on the train the same\nthing \u2014 I didn't have any money so I went without money like that. So, I was standing at\nthat time, when they came to control the tickets, you know, the middle [indecipherable]\nthere is a platform. I went to the platform with him and I stood there. When the ticket\ncontrol passed by I went back to the train and that's the way I came back from Lakhva\nfrom Pinsk. It didn't take long. It took maybe an hour. But there an hour,,,. And I brought\nhim back, and we went to my father to Lodz, to Poland. Then I met my husband there.",
        "A: My first husband, in Lodz.",
        "A: Not long. I was in Lodz and then my husband says he wants to go to the German side, to\nGermany because from Germany we could go to Canada or Israel. We didn't think to go\nto Canada, but one time when I had my baby and we were standing for milk in a place\nand they said, \u201cYou register for Canada but you're not going to be able to go,\u201d they told\nmy husband, \u201cbecause you have a little baby and that baby's a few months old.\u201d And he\nsaid, \u201cLet me register and maybe we'll see,\u201d because he was a tailor and they needed\ntailors. Then they called us to the UNRRA\u201d. We came to Canada in 1948.",
        "A: In Lodz. My father went before to Germany. He left us behind when I got married\nbecause my father didn't want me to get married. My father said to me, \u201cyou're too\nyoung\u201d and he said to me \u201cyou could be a lawyer.\u201d I said, \u201ca woman a lawyer?\u201d He said,\n\u201cWhat's wrong with women?\u201d You see my father was modern, even in these years. My\nfather thought, \u201cWhat's wrong with women? You're more smart than any man I know.\nWhy can't you be a lawyer.\u201d He wanted me to go because I was very good in school. I\nwent to school and I used to make two grades in one year. So, he told me I have to go to\nschool to study and make something of myself. What I'm going to make I want it to be\nadvocate. He said, \u201cwoman, a girl,\u201d he said \u201cwhat's wrong with girls? There's nothing\nwith girls. A girl could be a lawyer, too. They more smart than men are, some women.\u201d\nSo, I didn't listen to him and I said, \u201cPapa I'm going to go away if you're not going to let\nme get married.\u201d I fell in love with my husband. He was in a Polish uniform. It was after\nthe army, and he was 16 years older than me, but I didn't know it at that time. If I knew I\nwould get scared.",
        "A: After the war, he was in the Russian army and then he went into the Polish army.",
        "A: Yes.\n'\u00b0 United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration",
        "A: No, my father went to Germany before. My father went to Germany and he said that,\n\u201cYou're going to come after.\u201d So, we went after. We didn't come to the same place. My\nfather was in Ulm, and I was in Hess-Lichtenau, near Kassel.",
        "A: No. I traveled \u2014 yes, from Lakhva to Lodz with my father and brother, yes. Then when\nwe met we didn't separate anymore but then I separated when I got married and my father\nwent before me to Germany and then we came to our organization, through a Zionist\norganization we came to Germany. He was like in the army, the Zionist organization\nfrom the army we came to Germany.",
        "A: In a camp, I was in an UNRRA camp in Germany.",
        "A: How long? Until I came to Canada. We came to Germany in 1947. We came to Canada\nin '48 so it was about a year and a half I think. I had my baby in '47, my son is born in\n1947 in Germany.",
        "A: In the camp, yes.",
        "A: No, we were in a house living there. Also Jewish houses that the Jewish people used to\nlive. I remember the address.",
        "A: They took him I don't know how it happened but they took him to the Polish army. He\nwas in the Russian army and then they took him to the Polish army. I don't know how,\nbecause he was Russian at the time from the war. So, they took him in Russia to the army\nand then they took him to the Polish army.",
        "A: It was difficult, yes. It was very difficult. We thought because with a baby we wouldn't be\nable to \u2014 they wouldn't let us come. My baby was very sick and we came to a place\nbefore, I forgot the name of the place in Germany before we came to Canada. We were\nliving all people together in one place. The people that were supposed to go to Canada,\nand my son got sick and his stomach was loose all the time, all the time. One time I\ndreamt my husband's father, which I never knew in my life, when I described to my\nhusband he told me that he looked like that, and I dreamed that he gave me a jar of fish\nand he told me, \u201cGive that to your child a little bit. Then you're going to talk about me, so\nlong live my child,\u201d because his name is after him, Jack, you know his name 1s Jack,\nJankel in Jewish.\nAll of a sudden on the day after a doctor an American doctor came in. I couldn't speak\nEnglish at all. So, I showed him that the diapers that he goes every minute, so he gave\nhim medication and that doctor helped him. I thought the child was going to die, because\nhe was screaming nights. Everybody was mad at me because the child was screaming,\nand I was so young at that time. So, he gave him a medication. After that dream, all of\nsudden the child got well and we came to Canada after that. We came to Canada in 1948,\nNovember the 16. I don't remember the liberation day, but I remember when I came to\nCanada.",
        "A: It was very difficult. It was difficult because we didn't have anything. We came and didn't\neven have a dollar in my pocket. I didn't know how it looked, a dollar. My father had\nfamily in the United States, in Troy, New York, so they sent us the first 50 dollars. I\ndidn't even know how American money looked like. I didn't know what to do with that 50\ndollars. Then my husband couldn't find a job, and when he found a job they paid him 35\ndollars, and 35 dollars \u2014 39 dollars a week and I had a room and I had to pay 35 dollars a\nmonth for the room. Then we got \u2014 my aunt came and they gave us 700 dollars so I paid\nkey money, 700 dollars to move into an apartment in Montreal just for a broken stove and\nnot a refrigerator, an icebox, and a little table and chairs, I paid 700 dollars key money.\nWe could have bought a house at that time. The money that she gave me, I was happy to\nmove into a house because we lived in a room, don't stay here and don't make electricity\nand you're burning too much that. Then she made me wash the walls \u2014 her walls, like I\ndidn't understand. I thought that was the way it had to be. No matter how tough I was\nwhen I had to be, I was very different then.\nI let myself be used by a woman. They couldn't understand. What do I have to do for\nthem. Let them do a little bit for me. We were very much used by these people.",
        "A: A lot of advantage. They took for a stove, for Jewish people, a broken stove with a little\ntable, 700 dollars from us and we didn't have nothing. We came with nothing. Absolutely\nwith nothing and we struggled. All our lives, it was very hard. He wasn't a business man,\nhe was a tailor and he worked very hard for his money and it was a hard life. We had a\nvery hard life.",
        "A: I think now it's easier a little bit, but we're getting older.",
        "A: Yes, we live in a free country, and I don't think that born American people or born\nCanadian people they know what it means freedom. Freedom means all the money in the\nwhole world can't buy that. Nothing. That's the most important thing. Not money, not\nanything but health and freedom. The only thing I felt, I'm free and I can do whatever I\nwant to do, even if I don't have nothing but I have my freedom. I could go wherever what\nI want to go. I could do what I want to do and I appreciated it very much.",
        "A: No, never.",
        "A: I felt I had to take revenge one day for everything that has happened, for all these people\nthat I saw my friends that I loved them so much. I went to school with them together, get\nkilled. I saw them shot, falling down on the floor, and it started in the ghetto. I saw them\nlying dead. I said no. I have to live and take revenge, and you know what, right now I\ndon't feel like I want revenge. I just want one thing. I don't want this thing to happen\nagain to our people, to any people. But I don't want revenge anymore. At that time, I just\nfelt that I have to take revenge and I have to live just for that.",
        "A: Yes, yes. I wanted to revenge, I wanted to revenge from these Polish people that took\naway everything from us that they were worse than the Germans. I wanted revenge. I\nthink I lived for it, just to get revenge.",
        "A: I don't think so. The only revenge I have that \u2014 I don't know. I don't think I had any. I felt\n\u2014 after I didn't feel that. The only thing I had revenge 1s when I saw our country that we\nhave a country. That we are people just like anybody else, and Israel was like in 1947,\n1946, when I saw that we have a country I said, \u201cNow I have everything that I ever\nfought for, that we're going to have a country. We're going to be able to be just like\nanybody else. Even to be respected in other countries, we need our country, and I love\nthat country.\u201d I think that was my revenge, that I knew we were fighting for something.\nEven I didn't fight for Israel I fought for something that I lived to see, and it's important\nto me. I think it should be important to all of us that country we have.\nIt's the dearest thing that I feel we have, especially now that we're getting peace, and it's\ngoing to be peace there, I hope so.",
        "A: I don't know. We wanted to go to Israel, but it came out like that, like we stayed in a\nplace to get some milk for the baby and all of a sudden they arranged it for Canada. It just\nhappened, it just happened but I really wanted to go to Israel. I didn't think of Canada at\nall.",
        "A: I don't know. If you ask me I can remember. I don't even know what I want to add\nbecause it's very hard for me.",
        "A: No, no we didn't. The religious Jews in Lakhva, the rabbis, they said that in Lakhva one\nrabbi died and he said there's not going to be any blood shedding in Lakhva, never. It's\nnot going to be. We shouldn't fight with the Germans. We shouldn't fight and no matter\nwhat happens we have to stay put. But the Zionist people didn't think like that. They\ndidn't believe in that, what the rabbi said. And they didn't listen to the rabbis. If they\nwould have listened to the rabbis all these Lakhva people \u2014 a few people are alive. From\nthe old ghetto there were a few thousand people that maybe a hundred people are alive,\nmaybe. I'm not even sure of that, so it wouldn't even be these people alive, if they would\nhave listened to the rabbis.",
        "A: No, they didn't have information, they had guts. They said, \u201cIf somebody fights me, I'm\nnot going to put one cheek and let the other one. I'm not going to let it happen. We have\nto fight back.\u201d And they said it to the rabbis and the rabbis were screaming, \u201cNo, don't\nfight.\u201d So, they didn't listen. They just said that we have to fight.",
        "A: Nobody, not the small people. Maybe the big people knew it, but not the small people,\nnot the ordinary people. Nobody knew, nobody. They only knew these people when they\nfought back, they knew that, \u201cIf somebody gives me, if somebody is going to shoot me,\nI'm not going to let myself. It's not going to happen, because I'm going to fight back, even\nif I don't have ammunition, I'm going to take eggs, I'm going knives. I'm going to take\neverything I have with everything I could even I'm going to die just the same, but I'm not\ngoing to let myself get killed just like that without a fight.\u201d",
        "A: I don't know because there was nobody organized it. They had to have somebody\norganize these things. If they would have had somebody who organized these things, I\nthink people were afraid and they didn't think. They just went like sheep.",
        "A: It couldn't have been avoided, but they could have fought back. They could have\nprepared themselves if they would know it. I think people should have prepared\nthemselves. Like I was little, and I was happy when I saw that mensch\u2019 \u2019. I was there, saw\nit, when they were giving the German with an ax. I felt so good inside and when they\nasked the doctor to help them. They're going to kill my brothers and my sisters and\neverybody and you're telling me you're going to keep my family safe if I'm going to save\nyou? No, I'm not saving anybody. You could kill me too, so they shot the doctor too. It\nmeans that some people had guts. They didn't just want to give up. If they're going to\nthrow away their lives at least they're going to do it for something. They're going to go\nwith a reason, with a fight.",
        "A: I think because they had somebody like Rochczyn there. If they would have more like\nthese, like now in Israel. How has Israel survived? Because there were these people, they\nwere there. That's why. These were part of these people. They learned to be like that.\n\" person (Yiddish); a decent person, someone of noble character.\nThey learned not to give up without a fight and we never have to give up without a fight\nif we have to survive.",
        "A: That's right.",
        "A: When I look back, I wish I could have said to everybody in all these ghettos, \u201cDon't let\nyourself just go like sheep to the grave. Fight back. Don't let yourself, don't go to the\ngraves just like that. If you go to the grave let it be written \u2014 let 1t be said that you were\nfighting and you didn't give up, but you were fighting for something that you believed\nthat, you have to fight, not to go like a sheep but to go like a person, like a human being,\nto fight back.\u201d I believe it now, too.",
        "A: I never give up even now, no matter hard you know. We had hard times. Like now, I\nmarried my husband. He was very sick. He was twice in a hospital. He had surgery after I\nmarried him. He had a surgery by-pass and then five times since we live in a house now.\nOne year he was five times with infections. He went through a lot, so I never gave up. I\nnever said \u201che's going to die,\u201d and I was sitting and talking to him and I said, \u201cYou're not\ngoing to die. You'll see. You're going to pull through it because you have to. You have to.\nYou have to.\u201d I was saying to myself, \u201cNo he's not going to die. It's not going to happen\nto him because we're going to fight and we're going to survive.\u201d It's just like anything\nelse. I'm a fighter now too. I always believe when I go to sleep at night it's like a nice\nletter that's going to come. I live day by day like that like it's going to come a letter\ntomorrow, something good is going to happen. Like I'm waiting for the next day, every\nsingle day in my life I'm waiting for something good to happen. Even if it's not going to\nhappen, I still believe that it will happen. I never believe that it's going to be an ordinary\nday. I believe that it's going to be the most beautiful day tomorrow.",
        "A: I always felt like that. I think I was born like that.",
        "A: I knew him a long time because \u2014 I met my current husband a long time ago but I didn't\nknow him, but a few years ago, when he moved in with his wife \u2014 I used to live on the\nfourth floor and he moved into my apartment on the third floor. He moved 1n with his\nwife and his wife had Alzheimer. She was very sick. I saw them and I knew them and I\nsaid \u2014 I opened the door and I let him in \u2014 I said, \u201cThese are two old people I'm going to\nlet them in, let the door open. They're carrying parcels. They moved into that apartment.\u201d\nThen I heard from far his wife said, \u201cThat's Zina.\u201d I said, \u201cThat's Icek?\u201d And I call him\nIcek, because his name 1s Icek and not Joseph. I said, \u201cMy God, he looks so old and that\nman is not so old.\u201d He was about 63 years old at that time. I said, \u201cMy God, what has\nhappened to them?\u201d At that time, his sister in law came \u2014 and I used to go a few times to\nhis house to have coffee there with his wife too. His wife didn't know nothing because\nshe was very sick, Alzheimer. She was still a young woman because she died at 63 years\nold.\nSo, I came up to the house and I was \u2014 I saw \u2014 when his wife died, his sister-in-law came\nand she stayed by me upstairs, instead of staying in a hotel, I gave her my apartment\nbecause my husband was dead already. She says, \u201cYou know what, you two are so good\nfor each other, you're going to marry him.\u201d And I didn't even think about it because first\nof all, his wife just died. I'm going to think that I'm going to marry him? I said, \u201cYou're\ncrazy. Anja (ph), why are you talking like that?\u201d That was Erwin's wife, and I knew\nErwin since 1951, very well. I said, \u201cYou're crazy, don't talk like that.\u201d But every single\nday that his wife died, I started asking him to go for a walk because he was very\ndepressed and he was talking about his wife all the time and we were going and walking\na lot, and talking. Then, I fell in love with him after, and the same thing happened to him\nI think. So, I never believed that in that age I'm going to fall in love with somebody,\nbecause I think I love him more than my life because after that he was so sick a few times\nhe was in the hospital. Quite a few times, and I stood by him and I always gave him faith.\nWhen he was in the hospital with a by-pass and this is the second one, because 15 years\nago he had one bypass and this was the second one. He thought he was not going to live\nbecause the doctor told him that that by-pass is not going to be able to make a by-pass. I\ntold him, \u201cDon't believe the doctor what he says. I heard many doctors. They talk to the\npatient and they die before the patient dies, so don't listen. You'll see that you're going to\nbe alive and you're going to be able to have the operation.\u201d A few days later he came and\nhe says, \u201cYou know, what we're going to try to operate.\u201d He was so happy, just like he\nwas going to go to dance, and I said to him like that, \u201cBefore you go to the operation,\nhave faith, believe that you're going to live and after you're going to see we're going to\nbuy the most beautiful things for the house. You're going to sell all the old junks you\nhave and we're going to buy the nicest things. You're going to see you're going to have\nthe most beautiful life. Just believe it.\u201d He was six weeks in the intensive care and I was\nsitting every single day and talking like that. \u201cJust believe it, you'll see, you're going to\nhave a good life.\u201d Just like I thought in the time of the war. I didn't think I was going to\nlive but I still didn't want to believe it because I think I'm a survivor.\n"
